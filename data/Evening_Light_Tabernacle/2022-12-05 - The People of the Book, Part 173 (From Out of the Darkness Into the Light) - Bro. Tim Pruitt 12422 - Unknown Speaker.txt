this service to you and us into your hands now in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you if you'll turn with me to Matthew chapter 4 and verse 13 we want to welcome you today in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ and just say it's a privilege to be in the house of the Lord today and amen thank you for coming and for being here and amen it makes something a real special day when when the saints of God get together and amen and see some of you that have been in sickness and you're back whole again and we thank the Lord for that and I want to thank you for your prayers I appreciate that as um we have suffered You In the Flesh as all men do it's just the lot that we have as humans but one day all our troubles are gonna be over amen and we look forward to that but until until then we persevere until then we overcome until then we put another foot forward amen we progress we move on Amen Matthew chapter 4 verse 13 and leave it Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zebulun and Neptune that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by azaias the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of Neptune by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people that sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region in the shadow of death light is sprung up amen looking back over the congregation seeing sister Lily back there these ought to resonate to her today sitting in the in the in the region and shadow of death light has sprung up amen we're glad to have you in church her dad brother brother Kenneth back there has been also suffered in Great Waves this had to have um some type of device put in the heart but he's here today in the service of the Lord those who've sat in the in darkness and they saw great light and to them which sat in the region in the shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand if we would read on and hear we would see that next he calls disciples skip down the verse 23 after calling different disciples the Bible said in Jesus when about all Galilee teaching and in their synagogues and preaching the gospel that's the good news of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people and his Fame went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments and those that were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the palsy and he healed them and then I'd like to look down in First Peter chapter 2 and verse 9. and read from here as well a man as you're finding your place in the Bible I want to read about you and who you are but you are a chosen generation that word generation actually means Offspring you are chosen Offspring God has chose you for this time for this moment for this hour for this very day of his visitation amen for you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood in a holy nation A peculiar people that you should force so forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light amen God bless you as you are seated we're going to speak today from out of the darkness into the light and of course we have been dealing with Abraham and because it's a prophecy of the last days so we will also refer to Abraham and what was happening in that day because it is a parallel to what is happening in our day of Prophecy for our day written in the scripture for our time and we want to make sure we see every part of this word that has been spoken of us because it was prophesied as somebody and so then somebody is the interpretation of it when God prophesies then there is someone who will be the interpretation of that prophecy and so it tells us that in Genesis 18 1 the Lord appeared unto Abraham in the plains of mammary and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and then in verse 9 it said and they said unto him where does Sarah thy wife and behold he said behold in the tent you know Sarah was I'm sitting here in the tent of her darkness and God was appearing he was calling Sarah to come out of the tent of darkness and despair into the Glorious light of the word that was being revealed in that moment and of course God always has a word for every generation for every time and God has a word for us today even for evening like Tabernacle or whoever wherever you are today around the world as you're listening in God has a word for you today because God's word is current and God's word is also precise it discerns the very thoughts and the Very intents of the heart and goes down Beyond even when you don't see you have a need it goes down and reveals your need and brings that out into the light so that you can say yes God I do have need of that and so again we so we we have read of Sarah in the tent there as he sat in her time of Despair a time of darkness in her old age as a forgotten woman it seems but God never forgets any of his promises God is an ontime God and he does things in certain ways because you would think oh my as he said I had this child when he was when she was young and and could have enjoyed him now for um he's uh nearly 90 years old she could have enjoyed him now for maybe 70 years and it would have been a wonderful time of spending look at all the time that she lost but you see God had a purpose and a plan one thing God was doing was showing his omnipotence he was showing his power of what he could do with that not just an old decrepit woman but what he could do with an old incredit Church that had long forgotten her promises that looked like the Lord had delayed his coming and had held back the promises of God and so again we we see again Israel being a woman who was similar to Sarah she was an old woman having given a promised son a son that had been promised for many years that a messiah would come it had come all the way from the book of Genesis from the earliest of prophecies that there would come a a serpent Bruiser who would correct what the serpent had done and he would be the seed of a woman and she would come forth and and yet now this old woman Israel has been waiting and waiting and waiting and went through her trials and devastations and troubles and now as the Bible said she was a people that was sitting in great Darkness she was a people who was sitting in the in the region and the shadow of death but in that moment light was springing forth because the Israel as Sarah of old was bringing forth that promised son The Offspring of God was coming forth it would be God incarnate it would be one that it would be the greatest visitation of God to mankind where God would come and take on flesh and here he would he would walk there in the land of zebulun in the land of nebulon by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan in the Galilee of the Gentiles and people who were sitting in great darkness and they begin they begin to see a great light those who were sitting in the region the shadow of death light was springing up and it was bringing the light by teaching in their synagogues and by preaching the gospel of the kingdom and by healing all manner of sicknesses and and all manner of diseases among the people and those with diverse disease and torments and those that were possessed with Devils those that were lunatic those that had the palsy that were paralytic and he healed them this was this was what happens when the promised son comes amen he he arises with healing in his wings with Deliverance in Genesis 18 1 the Lord appeared I think those words are powerful the Lord appeared because we are also in the day of his appearing amen and when he appears the spirits of Darkness flee amen Abraham is in the tent of the and he was in the door of his tent in the light well yet Sarah is sitting in the Gloom and the Darkness of her tent and so she's sitting in the region under the shadow of death and because it looked like she would just die childless that Ishmael would be the promised son that surely none of this that was promised would ever be her promise that it would only be sort of in a kind of a way you know through a hate guard that this would be but it was never going to ever be her personal promise and she's sitting in the region under the shadow death and yet in that moment her visitation was happening in that moment the one in the beginning who said let there be light was standing there by her tent door amen and again he was there to separate light from Darkness let me tell you he's the same kind of God today he is the same kind of God that would appear suddenly either to Abraham and Sarah and call Sarah out of her chant he is here this morning right here in this church to walk these aisles to speak to your heart to call you out of your tent of despair of the tent of Darkness where you're in the unbelief that you have dealt with the sickness that has been there way too long the barrenness that you have experienced way too long and it looks like it will never happen but today is a day of visitation today things are changing and I want to prophesy today things are changing and they're changing because he has appeared because when he appears good things happen when he appears life changed when he appears and losses saved when he appears the sick is healed whether you are lunatic or paralytic or whether no matter what's your condition or how bad it is whether he appears things happen [Applause] marriages are healed homes are reunited the Blind Eye Has Come open the death begins to hear the blind eyes begin to see when he appears he comes as the one who stood in the beginning who said let there be light and when he spoke things begin to happen when Jesus began to speak things began to happen people who sat in darkness begin to see light the good news of the Gospel was a man that no matter what your condition and how long have you been there and how severe the case that when the gospel is preached when the word Goes Forth in power it breaks the chains of darkness and it's sexy children of God pray to serve him foreign the tent was under this shadow of death but today was a different day oh if we could only realize we're in the last day and it's a different day yeah it's a day of Sodom yes it's a day of evil yes it's a day of great Darkness yes it's a great day of great despair in the world among the Nations and people are truly sitting under the shadow of death our nation is a country sets under the shadow of death the world and its governments are setting under the shadow of death people are in the region and the shadow of death people families are dying homes are dying everything else is going on but in that moment he's appearing in that moment the light bringer is coming the day star is rising amen the light is coming forth to dispel the darkness and to open up the eyes of the Blind and let them see scriptures that have been lay of dormant in the word for many many years now to come to life today is a new day where light is appearing I wanted to say to you today it doesn't matter to despair it doesn't matter that whether you've been forgotten maybe your father abandoned you maybe your mother didn't care for you maybe your wife has left you maybe your children has forsaken you maybe your husband and you are in disagreement or maybe there are trouble of every kind man maybe your children are straight away from God or maybe there's sickness in the home it don't really matter what the disparagus the solution is all the same amen if you noticed there there was lunatic and paralytic and there was blind and there was crippled and there was every kind of a disease in all manner of things but it didn't matter the problem the solution was the same the gospel the word was bringing Liberty and I want you to know he's here to liberate you today no matter how long you've been in this situation no longer no matter how often you've been forgotten maybe how long the promise has been delayed it doesn't matter the solution is the same here's a prayer his appearance today is a new day he's calling you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light the Lord is appearing in his final climax before the rapture and through the teaching and the preaching it's followed by healing all manners of sickness all manner of disease among the people those that were with various diseases those suffered severe pain the demon possess those having seizures and the paralyzed and he healed them amen I I want you to notice the preaching is followed by this oh brother Tim but we're not in the days of tent revivals and brother Tim brother Tim this is not the hour of Divine Healing meetings that brother Tim this is not the hour of of gray to revivals and and healing campaigns and that's not where the emphasis is let me tell you the emphasis is on the word and when the gospel is preached amen The Lunatic a man is set free a man come on now amen no matter what the situation is the paralyzed the set the demon possess it doesn't matter the situation or how hard your case is because when he comes he'll declare there is nothing too hard for God your case is not an unusual case your case is not an unfixable case your case is not something that that even though doctors can't fix it man has no solution you don't have a solution but God's got the solution all right so when the preaching of the word Goes Forth it is followed by healing all manner of sickness oh but that ain't our day it is our day oh but this is not our visitation that is our visitation come on Sarah you got to quit disbelieving and come out of the tent of Despair it'll start saying this is my day this is the day God called me to live in amen if David overcome in his day and he killed Goliath I'm going to overcome in my day and I'll kill my Goliath amen if Samson overcoming his day amen I'm going to give my strength to God and let him anoint me and with that anointing to slay every Giant move every Gate of Hell now if this is appearing as in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so I want you to notice you can either look at yourself as being in the days of lot or the days of the coming it depends on how you want to look at it well we're in the days of lot what about the days of his coming you see when he comes he comes to focus Focus you on what is important and relevant to you and the days of Sodom is not relevant to you you are not Sodom amen you don't have to fix his politics you don't have to worry with the news that man you're not going to pitch the world in the system so quit trying quit worrying about it Focus now on who's here focus on the one who is present the one who's calling you come out of the darkness you've sat there too long Jesus said whoever follows me will never walk in darkness did you hear it but will have the light of life he asserts that he is the light to the world in John 9 and 5 during the during the miracle of the healing of the blind at Birth he says when I'm in the world I am the light of the world well you said brother Tim that'd be wonderful if he was here that's exactly what he's trying to tell you he's not here in the nail scarred Jesus but he's here in the power of His word he's here in the form of his holy spirit and it's just as powerful as when he walked to shores of Galilee amen and he has proven to us he is here in the world by his holy spirit he has proven it by Signs by Wonders by Miracles by healings and by revelation in Sarah's dwelling there was darkness and Gloom but God was there appearing to bring her from the shadow of death to push back the Demons of unbelief that held her bound had to let the light of God's word shine upon her and to shine upon her then dead and lifeless womb every one of you have got a womb is called his soul and that soul is to bring forth a life and that life is to be Jesus Christ and there she must bring forth the promised son and so must the church we must we must bring forth the promised son it is it is a most pertinent is the most relevant it is the most important thing that could ever be I I know like Israel they had given up I know like Sarah she had given up but you know in the moment when it's everybody seems to give up that's when God comes on the scene Sarah was missing her visitation she was sitting in the darkness of her tent and I'm going to just say you must not miss yours even today you must not miss yours he's coming and he's not too busy to hear your heart cry he cares for you he understands your situation this is a God that would become so personal that through a prophet that he would use him to call people's name their address and where they were from and all about the details of their lives because God wanted you to know he was a personal God he wanted you to know that he cares about and knows where you live what your address is what your name is he knows about your situation he saw you back there when you were scared he saw you back there when whence that happened to you as a child he saw all of that he knew that but he's also got the solution I just want to give you a word of warning don't miss your visitation in the beginning and before Eden God created the heavens of the Earth and the Earth was void it was full of emptiness Darkness covered the face of the Earth that continued and I don't know how long it continued could have invent millions of years that it was in that shape we don't know but nevertheless when God spoke he said let there be light and this is this is exactly what God was doing to Sarah he was bringing light up on her darkened heart and where she was sitting with her Despair and discouragement this is exactly what what happened when Jesus started appearing among them he was bringing those who were in despair in darkness into a Marvelous Light showing them showing them that I'm an on-time God showing them I'm the Healer I'm the solution to every problem that there is nothing no problem that you have too hard for me now in the beginning God showed himself as the separator of light from Darkness for God's word separates light from Darkness it is the preaching of the word that separates a lot of times you know when we preach and you think well that's hard preaching or that was preaching on Holiness or or that was preaching against sin or that was preaching about what I was doing or how I was living or whatever what is that it's the gospel going forward separating light from Darkness amen dispelling the darkness trying to be to bring the light of the Holiness of God into your life as I said how long the Earth Set Dark and empty we don't know but when God got ready to use it he had to separate light from Darkness when God got ready to use Sarah he had to bring her from the darkness of the tent into the light of his presence he had this separated from the dark spirits of fear and unbelief when God gets ready to use any group or any individual he has to separate light from Darkness and he did it then by the spoken word and anytime he sends his word he separates the light from the darkness he clear his word clears back all the atmospheres of unbelief so you can start believing that's what the preaching of the word does that's why faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God because when word is preached in faith what happened to his spells unbelief items dispels doubt which you know everybody believes well the Bible is true well the message is true yeah God sent a prophet yeah I believe Jesus is the son of God but you see it's never been personal to you and it's got to be conversional to every individual even on a even even when it comes down to Healing you can know all the scriptures in the Bible by his stripes I'm Healed you know all this but you know he was wounded from my transgression all the promises that lays in the word of God you can know them all but it's got to become personal to you but God will become your word and this message has got to become your message now this is what his word does it clears back all the atmospheres of unbelief this is why this son of man Christ the word was manifested he comes to destroy the works of the devil men and women who were Bound by sin who were tormented who were oppressed who were in drugs or alcohol or in sexual sins of fornication or pornography or an adultery those that were obsessed or possessed with anxieties those that are caught in unbelief of the ages of false trinities of gods of those who were snared by denominational half-truths of people Barren and unable to bring forth the promised son this this is why the son of man is manifested this is why the word comes to bring Deliverance amen I'm looking at a bunch of men and women who in your life you met this one you stood in the presence of him he dispelled the half truths the denominates no Darkness he dispelled the unbelief that held you some of you maybe you never was a smoker Drinker liar cusser maybe you lived in a religious home but your own self-righteousness held you bound and you had to realize I need a savior I'm a sinner because when he when you stand in his presence it reveals the darkness of the heart it reveals why you're kind of laughing at the promise and say how could that be for me it's true for others I can never be successful I can never make it I can never do it why you know my greatest you know you got young men who's the greatest ambition is to be a drug dealer or they could be you know make the high dollars and drive the fancy car and you know and I can make more money than this and what I can sweat and honest work and that's their ambition that some of you that was some of your ambition you sat in that kind of Darkness amen but the light of Lights came by your way and it dispelled that darkness and it brought you out and it gave you a better life to live that when you live some of you were bound with every kind of sin maybe you've been married two or three times and you had all this kind of situation in your life but the lightbringer came I need to spell that Darkness he forgave you of your sins amen and he treats us he man at the same time young people you don't do that I mean you live for for one marriage one life one wife one man to serin the tent the word meant nothing to her literally the word that had been given was not hers personally it was just its promises were passed I'm too old I'm 90. I'm Way Beyond barren these promises are not mine that's the way a lot of people get in their times of Despair back in the tent sitting in the darkness well you know it can happen for so and so but it can't happen for me yeah the you know I you know we we've had bad marriages for how many you know my daddy and Mom fought and fight mother fought and fight all the time all the time and and my my parents they did and how do you expect me to be in a difference foreign I can't you're going to go right down the same Trail you make the same bad choices you do the same thing unless you ever realize there's one that is present who can dispel that darkness and what's been through of a generational curse for years and years breaks and stops right there with your life because today I'd come into His presence today my life is going to be different today my life has changed discern the tent God would never be real to her in real to Abraham oh yeah God was real Abraham Sarah in the tent to Sarah in the tent you know God would never be real to her it was just for somebody else the promised son would never come she might as well just be content with Ishmael she never dreamed she could be young again sitting in this tent all her mind was on how much inflation was my Social Security isn't going to make it and I'm not going to agree I have enough to buy groceries and pay the rent and the light bills and Minden are really high and the troubles that we have is getting worse and worse and there's no future for young people and there's no future for for nothing else and you know see you know and the church sits back you know we can never have those days again we can never feel the spirit of God again we can never feel young again we we can never do that those days have passed and you sit back in your dreams and yet you can never dream never allowed to dream of being young again being healthy being well there's some of you even in your life you've given up on being healthy you're giving up on being well this is just my lot this is just my life just the way it is I can never be any different and you sit right there in your despair convinced that this is just the way it's got to be you look at your marriage and you say well you know most of them don't make it when mine's just running the same course and we can't get along and and you know we'll never have a happy home and you're there in that despair of I can never it's never for me it's not meant for me or maybe you're single I'll never be married there's nobody for me there's nothing for me and you sit back in the despair in your tent or maybe it's somebody else sitting I can never have a good job I never can be successful or as a young person I could never overcome this problem you sit back in your tent and you wonder why me why can others be blessed why can others get through the blessings of God and how come it always happens to me the way it is well you know why why couldn't I've been born a certain way or born in a certain family or been a certain way or you know how come I I got this trashy family I got how come I couldn't had something better why didn't I get a better start well I'll tell you what you can have your better start today amen because you are in your hour of visitation and no matter how decrepit and old and weary and hopeless and deceived I want you to know it ain't hopeless Hallelujah when you put my God in the equation there ain't nothing there ain't nothing hopeless God appears on the sea in the most in opportune moment to pull you out of that Darkness into His Marvelous Light because you are a chosen people [Applause] chosen of God not to stay in your tent and despair all your life that you don't know my problem my God does and there ain't nothing bigger than my God but you don't know my situation but my God does if we can just get you to start having the right mental attitude toward the promise of God Amen the word of God he will germinate in that kind of atmosphere where you start believing of things are possible to them that believe this is why the son of man was this and Sarah he was demonstrating he knows her name calling her out God was showing us in this last day when Sodom Darkness covered the land when many churches are unbelief clouded us as we sulked in our tents that the fullness of the word would come and show his power it showed us the power over blind eyes over deaf ears over crippled conditions it's power over cancer his power over Roman dogmas of false trinities and baptisms amen the Bible said in Ephesians 5 13 whatsoever that make manifest is light so light manifests his power over darkness and when light is sprung up among those in Jesus day who sat in the region of death unto the shadow of Darkness I know when the light sprung up it called an ordained men to cast Satan out amen it was not just Jesus going forth Healing The Sick but he was calling men to do the same thing Hallelujah I want you to know it's God it's calling a church in this last day I'm not talking about a building and I'm not sure talking about a certain sect I'm talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ and God is calling men and women The Cow Speaking out Genesis the seeds were already there God had planted the seed it was as the atmosphere had to be right atmospheres have to be right for the seed to come forth the light would manifest the seed that was there but until that light came and it sat in the Darkness in the time of void and darkness until the light came it could not bring forth and manifest what was in the seed the same with the word of God the word of God is a seed amen and it could lay dormant for centuries but when the light shines upon it it has to manifest is that right amen I mean come on that you know how many years did did it set in the Bible the whole the Virgin shall conceive and that word late dormant for centuries until finally the light Shone on that scripture by the presence of God shining up on that scripture and all of a sudden that light that word became irrelevant that word became Power that one lay in that word all those years begin to manifest and out of it came a forerunner and out of it came a savior and out of it came a gospel and out of it came deliverance and out of it came the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Michael's light showed on the word that had been dormant for years and years and years for he says it's in the evening time it shall be light this is the hour of light I want to get it to you this morning this is the hour of light oh but brother Tim I see Darkness come out of the tent amen do you say I don't see nothing but just about to come out of the tent you've got to walk in the light you gotta see who is here Among Us you got to see that that is when he comes he changes the whole situation now so the word is a seed and it can lay dormant for centuries but when light shines upon it it has to make manifest that's the way Christ shining upon the word makes the word do what it's supposed to do life can only come by the word of God May manifest or displayed so in other words you see the the word of God can be there without life Until It's Made manifest and when it made manifest it goes into action and things begin to happen now for example as long as it is lays in the book The Bible like this it can still be questioned now you say brother Tim you know the Bible can be questioned oh what do you mean it could be questioned it's a you know the question can be is it a word for a past age that's a question is it applicable for me because he was spoken to David and the prophets and to Israel but is it mine so as long as it lays in there just in the book it can still be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is a light on the word the word said so and then when it comes to past light bringing Life Light brings life hey man now you can put the you can put the seed grain of God or the seed grain of wheat you can plant it down in the basement but it will never bring forth the intended crop oh yeah you can water it and it'll Sprout and you know you can you can have sprouts but for it to ever produce grains of wheat it's got to have the right atmosphere and that atmosphere has to change from glory to glory understand it cannot remain the same now so again there has to be a change and and that's what we're saying this morning you know the atmosphere to germinate life might have been there and you might have had that 20 years ago but it's time for the atmosphere to change where you can manifest any and every promise of God where it can bring healing to you heal into your home healing to your marriage healing to your Christian walk whatever it is that it can bring healing Deliverance now so as long as Sarah remained in darkness of the tenth even with hearing the word she scoffed and doubted the word of the messenger but when she was brought out into the light the demon of doubt that it held her for years now that said I can't do it it'll never be me I I can never be the real that real kind of Christian I can you know it just can't happen for me I I can never be that in the character of Christ I can never Manifest this this is too hard this I'm unable and as long as she she laid their sin I can't do it it'll never be me or maybe it might be you where your your sickness just went on for years and I can never be whole I could never I you know and you sit there in that depression that's a demon of despair I want you to understand depression is a demon it is a shadow of death and you'll listen to that depression until you become that depression come on hey man you've got to have a different attitude than that you've got to come out and say I can I will I do believe you've got to come out and say but healing is mine Deliverance is mine Jesus paid for them and I've got son or I'm God's daughter I don't have to live this way the rest of my life but I'm too old Sarah was 90. I don't know how old you are Abraham was honored that swell up in the Auntie a little bit ten more years why are we putting limits on God why don't you be the best you can be right here where God has you in this moment this time why can't you be a testimony to the world it can be preached about Through the Ages like Sarah was and where that she was conceived because she judged him faithful instead of saying I can't do it he said he can certain instead of saying I'm unable she said he can and said my problem's too great my Situation's too hard my children will never believe it you know that too much unbelief I popped in a pumpkin and they've had too much contrariness and problems and they've seen too much but brother it's that kind of people that God takes and changes their lives and makes a trophy out of his grace amen all you can look at that and look at your children and say they're going to be a bigger trophy of the grace of God hallelujah amen there'll be one who declares that God can do the impossible that he contains the situations I can never bring forth the son of promise but when the messenger the son of man called her out of the tent it exposed her Darkness and it brought her into the light and then the word was manifested and when it's manifested it proves it was the light Hallelujah you know Acts 2 and 4 might be dormant for you may not be real in your life but it's been Vindicated in mind Hallelujah because why you see it's been manifested I look over here and I see other men and women that it's manifested we know Acts 2 is real that the Holy Ghost does come because we've tasted it we haven't we've experienced it it's changed our life we are new creatures in Christ somebody help me preach amen so you see it's displayed since light manifested it may be Dormer than you but it can be alive today the sun is God's spoken word and all natural life comes from the sun a spiritual life can only come from the son in him as light and in him is no Darkness because he's god-spoken light Jesus is god-spoken word for in the beginning what's the word the word was with God and the Word was God and it takes the light of God to strike the word to make it live here in the Bible is what he spoke now let the light shine on it come on amen he said it would be in the last day a bride without spotter recall Hallelujah I don't care how long this leg dormant here how many other ages could not qualify I don't care how many recalls and blemishes were in the past this is a new day this is when the son of man comes this sign upon the word and bring out a pride without spotter recall without a blemish the light will bring every word of the Bible to its right position in its season and this is the season you can keep saying this ain't the season I'm past the season you know I ate the season of child Baron is over the season of The Promise is over the season of healing is of a ceiling of Miracles is over see the sea the season of of the Holy Ghost that's over with and it may be for you but there's somebody it's meant for there is a Sarah on Earth Hallelujah the standing in the presence of the son of man and he's doing everything he can to change her attitude toward it saying the promises to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our Gods will call amen it's for you could you imagine somebody refusing to say that there's such a thing as a son well praise God I can look out to back today and I can see it Shining there's been a few days I wondered if there was one dark and Cleary and rainy days you know I I can remember the first time I flew God prepared me when I was 18 years old and I went to a meeting there to to be with those in a church dedication in the Anniston Alabama and I flew from from Shreveport over there landed in Atlanta in in the midst of nine tornadoes we went round and around and around you talk about flying the friendly Skies it was not friendly but one thing I found that no matter how stormy it was no matter how dark it was no matter how many tornadoes was on the ground and the winds were blowing and all this trouble up where I was was above the clouds and the Sun was shining and I want you to know somewhere up above your despair somewhere up above your clouds somewhere about that unbelief the sun is shining Hallelujah just waiting for the Winds of the Holy Spirit to blow the clouds back and let the sun shine is there you may not see it because of your despair but it's there where I was it was a pretty day a bumpy ride but a pretty day I want to say today where I'm at it's a pretty day this is a good day amen this is a wonderful day this is the best Days of Our Lives amen it's only going to get better for us Hallelujah because the promised son is on the way it ain't going to get worse for you as a Christian come on it's going to get better a better Day's coming a visitation is coming Lord the holy spirit is coming Marvin's Power is coming why it's the day for it but can you imagine somebody going down into a dark basement and refuse to to accept the benefit of a god-given light there's something wrong with him he don't want his warm health-given raise he don't want it don't want the light to walk in he'd rather set in darkness something's mentally wrong with him oh there ain't no sun do today today this ain't the season for it it is the season for the light this is the day of the coming of the son of man this is the day where the light is shining in its fullness this is the day where God is here in his power oh well we don't have the power like they had in the 40s and 50s beat me tell me is that right no it's not right how could that be right amen when he's the same yesterday today and forever he is there and he'll meet your expectations he will come to you in that very moment of time breaking through your shadows of doubt and unbelief in the spirit of Darkness where you can see a great light is shining something wrong go back under the shade of a tent of a profession of a fate and shuts the door so well there's no such thing as that days of Miracles this past no such thing as Divine Healing there's none of these things that was just for the apostles or their favorite thing today but that was just for the for the prophet those men are spiritually crazy did you hear what I said something's wrong with them that he pulled a curtain down and reject the holy spirit that could come upon them Amanda said if you abide in me and my words abide in you then let the Light Shadows on the word ask what you will and it shall be given to you I mean there's something wrong that you would reject the god-given sources that God has given us to live by his word said to just shall live by faith how many is righteous amen then you'll live by faith men shall not live by bread alone but by every word not part of the word that's why we believe in an open book around here oh brother Tim you're just trying to you know work up some gifts and miracles and signs and wonders and then no we want every word of God amen we're just we're saying there you know I don't care whether others are denying it others are neglecting it we're not neglecting any truth of God's word we shall see miracles for we are Miracles the miracle has started in my life and because of that miracle I can believe for other miracles hallelujah amen when a man will just refuse portion of the word whether it's altered calls the prayer lines of the baptism of the Holy Ghost or Withers doctrinal things like the seven Thunders or the Revelation contains in the seals or just as simple as one God truth of the Bible there's something wrong with that person a person had to be spiritually crazy to believe in two Lords amen are three gods or Trinity of two of gods come on somebody amen you climb down in your basement and refuse to let the light shine when God's light is shown in this day and shown this as a one God Bible and we are one God keeper amen and there's one Lord one faith and one baptism one God and Father of us all come on somebody amen when it's written in the word through baptism and that we can receive the Holy Ghost that's what's given in the book of Acts amen how could we go down in the basement and say it can't happen you'd have to be spiritually crazy go down the basement or hide in the tent and refuse to see the light of God's word and say well but we don't need Miracles today I don't know who you are you must be some superhero of some kind but this old boy needs miracles and I don't care who you are you need a miracle amen well we don't need well that was only for a season can you imagine people say that was only for a season well exactly what season is this well this is the wheat grain brother Tim where the life is in the Grain and and so it's the maturity of the word okay great I'm so glad to have that because if it's the maturity of the word and the fullness of the word and the grain of the word has all the word in it Hallelujah some Miracles are in it and healings in it and deliverance and salvation is it and if it ain't that you don't have the full word you got a Greener at his eight off half of it in kotlin at the full word of God we got grain where's the other half and some rat's belly saying days of Miracles have passed is not the season for God to move like that I want you to know the word is always in season come on amen this is it this is you say well it's not the season I just want to ask and I wonder when will be the season well Sarah ended up well the seasons passed you know I I've been in menopause for how many years and you know I might move my womb straight you know it's just that that season's past well maybe it was but the word still got to be fulfilled come on and he had to choose you to do it you're a chosen generation he happened to choose you to manifest the word of God in this last day he happened to select you to call you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light amen this is so when will be the the season for it I want Jesus understand this is the day of restoration amen he said I will restore saith the Lord all the years that the canker worm the Palm warmed the caterpillar the Locust I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh but you gotta come out from under that tent that dark basement of unbelief and judge him faithful who has promised but just because you don't believe in the powers of God don't run don't mean that the word you know does it doesn't mean what it says the what you know and the man that runs down into the musty dirty filthy basement of man's ideas and refuses a warmth in the life-giving Rays of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ which is the same yesterday today and forever then there's got to be something wrong with that person he would rather live in the musty Darkness than to live in the light of God and of the Bible that said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever The Works that I do so you do also before I go to my father you see there's something wrong with that person without a question that has to be something wrong when the Bible said that there's something wrong with your experience when you say you love God and refuse his word come on you see the church is in its condition today and things can't be done as God promised because you won't walk in the light amen the Bible said walk in the light as he is the light in the blood of Jesus Christ God's son cleanses us from all sin so you see sin is unbelief and if we're walking in the god-given light of the hour then God takes that word that's given for that hour and he vindicates it for signs will follow them that believe if this is a true word then Mark 16 20 has to be an action when they went forth preached everywhere and the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following the true message is when light shines on the word I'd like to I'd like this this scripture Revelation 10 1 to be immortalized in our hearts where he said and I saw another Mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow is upon his head his faith where is it where the son and his feet as pillars of Fire notice I want you to notice his faith when God comes when the light comes it has transforming power his face his countenance the countenance of this one we're talking about the son of man the standard in the front of Sarah's tent his face is as it were the Sun we're talking about brightness worrying there is no Darkness that's what this message is there is no darkness in this message Hallelujah this is when the true light comes on water baptism it's when True light shines upon the godhead is when True Light opens up Seven Seals and we hear what the Thunder's letter it's when True light comes when light comes into a darkened soul it changes that Soul where that that Soul desires the things of God it'll take a woman with with short bobbed hair and it'll make her wear long hair come on why because light comes upon the scripture it'll take a man with long hair and they'll take him and cause him to go to the barber shop and get it cut off because light has come into the soul that made the word of God a reality God doesn't want me looking like a woman he wants me to look like a man oh well brother Tim I'm trying to look like Jesus well if you want to look like Jesus with Jesus in that day would come on Paul said to the manners to have short hair come on cut hair the woman's have uncut hair so we know that in the days that that's what Christians did that's what Christians do today and Jesus would like all men of that day would take their hair and with a knife and they would have to cut it they didn't have Barbers like we got and cut it all the way around and cut it all the way around cut it all the way around Jesus didn't have a hair down to his waist Jesus was different he was different he was a man he didn't look like a woman he didn't dress like a woman and when the Holy Ghost comes it'll make a man look like a man that just like a man it'll make a woman look like a woman a lady and dress like a lady is that right because it's the Holy Ghost comes and it shines upon the darkened soul and light shines takes every worldly spirit away from you you quit desire and be like the world and the things of the world quit painting your fingernails and your toenails and make them look like white navy bean holes and call yourself a Christian come on Amen how in the world are you gonna identify yourself as a son or daughter of God when you're looking like the world amen that's all sacrifice fresh preaching but it's the word of God and if light goes in on the inside of your soul it'll break your life subject to the word of God you'll look holy he'll dress holy you'll act holy the painter come from off your face [Applause] I heard a preacher say here the other day said well you know I think a woman ought to wear a paint even a barn needs painting well my wife never was a barn and she never needed painting amen she was beautiful the way God made her I want you to know you're beautifully and wonderfully made you don't need the world's paint on your face to make you beautiful to make you attractive amen what a make you attractive is with the character of Christ comes in your life you want to amen don't try to vamp a man try to get a character on the inside of you that's my family would say that's the daughter of God I want that kind of a wife I want that kind of a woman same way with you as a man don't go kick your hair up and put a perm in it and act like some something like that come on you don't act like that we're Sons and Daughters of the great king of glory we belong to God we don't belong to the world we don't look like the world we don't dress like the world when light comes it attacks the demons that love Darkness that that fear that anxiety that depression it has to flee Paul said the word didn't come in or the gospel didn't come in word only it came in power and much assurance and since Christ is the same anytime the gospel is preached it comes in power and with much assurance we sought demonstrated again and again and we will still see it demonstrated today the word preach actually demonstrates itself it'll go forth like a flaming sword right into the consciousness of men and it'll set the captive free everywhere Believers went you see the word the gospel word god confirmed it with signs following and the sick were healed and Devils were cast out and then spoke in new tongues that was the word in action and that word will never fail in the mouths of believing Christians amen we're to speak at where did US play it we're to wave it in the face of the devil amen we are the people of the Kingdom we we sat under that region and the shadow death and where we sat light has now sprung up just as he did in Genesis we said let there be light and there was light now so you see could you could you realize today that men of Darkness will say but we don't need the word Vindicated can you imagine that people actually saying the word doesn't need vindicating well you see brother Tim it's already Vindicated so we don't need it Vindicated I want to just go on record that's a lie of the devil and that is the excuse of a powerless religion amen could you imagine the apostles saying the word don't need vindicating could you imagine him saying Jesus Vindicated it when he opened the eyes of the Blind and healed the leopards and raised the Lazarus from the dead so the word don't need vindicating anymore do you see they were not vindicating whether or not Jesus was a Believer they were Vindicated they were believers Hallelujah have signs followed them they spoke with new tongues they laid hands on the sick and they recovered what was it because the word that they were preaching had to be Vindicated and the same thing has to happen today if we preach it's got to be Vindicated science has got to follow healing's got to be there Miracles has got to be there Deliverance has got to be there the Holy Ghost has got to be there oh the word don't need been the king brother Tim has already been Vindicated well why did God send a prophet it was already vindicating Jesus ministry so why did we meet brother Branham why did we need a prophet God Vindicated it again still needs vindicating and when it's Vindicated in your life it vindigates you as a believer is that right amen the word today you said but the word today brother Tim has already been Vindicated yeah it was Vindicated that brother Branham it Vindicated that brother Branham was a prophet and that the seventh angel messenger he he was dead and and and and what he and it's let me just say this way it's not brother Branham that needs vindicating it's you that needs vindicating amen these silence shall follow them that believe yeah it worked in brother brown but what about your life amen they shall speak with new tongues that needs to be Vindicated come on somebody they shall cast out devils but then we we don't need Devil's cast out every person who comes to Christ has to have the devil cast out of it you have a demon setting on your throne from the moment you're born you're born in sin and sheep and iniquity brought into this world speaking lies and you need that devil cast out of your life and let the Holy Spirit come and be the King on the throne of your heart salvation is casting out Devils Divine Healing is casting out devils not your devil is casting out that devil of unbelief that devil is holding you back that maybe today is not the day maybe today is not the moment maybe today for me maybe this is not my hour these signs of if these signs shall don't follow a church then that church is not true believers because these are among believers the Jews of 2000 years ago went into their basement of unbelief yet reading the quotes of Moses but Moses words became a glare that just blinded them instead of Illuminating them why did the Jews reject the Messiah because they were living in the glare of a an age past they were in the glare of Moses age and that's the very reason that this message that Jesus Christ is still the same is turned down is because people are living in class of other ages amen they living under a mirage a mirage is something that's believed to be true or real but is actually false it's a false light a glare is a false conception of the True Light a mirage is when a layer of heated atmosphere takes the light and it bends it making the sky that should be in the heavens appear to be on the earth and makes it as a pretty blue Lake and you look out there and you say oh this is a beautiful Lake out here and I'm starving to death for water if I can just get to that Lake right now and it's a mirage and it comes when a layer of heated atmosphere takes the light and bends it and when you get atmospheres of unbelief taking the light the message of the hour you can even take quotes and bend it instead of and instead of what's supposed to be on top is on the bottom and you have an illusion and you're calling it the truth and then and it is real but it belongs up here and if you got it down there and it's not real it's a false light and it's leading you to death instead of light and so there again Sarah was sitting there or you said brother Tim she wasn't done this yet she had a glare of oh my revelation of Ishmael of Hagar but I'll never be able to do this or this she's living in that glare other thoughts light a false hope people are hiding the basement of their darkness and refuse to see the word manifest among them you can take quotes and you can do anything with them but any quote that points away from the bride being the final voice to the final age of people who can say there's nothing too hard for the Lord that he's the same yesterday today and forever let me identify it it's a glare amen God has been in the process of restoration since the Lutheran age and God is still in the process of restoration a man said to brother Brandon said well you know he heard him preached he said while the book of Acts as scaffold work you know and and uh when when the scaffold when the work is completed you take down the scaffold so we don't need a book of Acts because he was only there for the building up of the church and the original church is not for us today and brother Brad said I went and shook his hand and said I'll agree with you it is a scaffold work but said the building's not complete foreign the book of Acts is still in action hallelujah amen and I know he's still in action I've seen it in action amen and we still need that scaffold work to get right up to every promise of God come on it's the Holy Ghost it's the power of God and the salvation now so Luther you know would have would go to husk he'd make a denomination out of the first word of restoration to just shall live by faith Wesley had two words of sanctification second definite work of Grace Pentecost had the third word the restoration of gifts but the entire seed has to come forth amen now so one one without justification one without sanctification another would have the restoration again but the entire seed has to come forth now they denominated died on this and today denominated and died on that but there's something that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the life that's in there it has to produce itself in a bride so therefore let me just say this is our where the entire seed we're not just staying at justification we're not just staying that with sanctification we're not just staying at restoration again we're having the entirety of the sea every promise of God lays in the seed and this is his eight age brother Branham said and Paul Morgan came home and caterpillar let me use just a few quotes before we bring this down to close and I want to kind of emphasize just wake up for the next 10 minutes do you good Sarah I've let you have your nap time to wake up the son of man's outside your tent listen he said and close to what I want to tell you the ever presence of the Living God is the lifeline of any church or any bunch of people that every presence of the Living God to perform and to do and to act and to live with the people as he did in the beginning if the presence of the Living God brought a Pentecost with power with signs and wonders and brought a people so full of the holy of the glory of God to they shouted and spoke with other languages and went and martyrs for the faith let us earnestly contend for that Faith until death shall set us free earnestly contend for it he goes on to say if there if God brought with his first Branch out of that vine was a Pentecostal Branch with power and visions and Revelations and healing and sanctification the Holy Spirit the next Branch will be the same thing it certainly every time the vine puts forth a branch it'll be exactly like that one like the first place again he said the martyrs stood there without a bat of an eye and he knew where he was standing he knew who he had believed he was able knowing this God can raise him up at the last day because he promised it and before he would bow to any man-made old dirty rag satellite he's calling him doctors of the church he'd die on a stump Hallelujah and he said let me die in the same place if God doesn't come in my generation I'll die on the stump where the canker worms ate to it believe in that Jesus Christ and his church in his word is the same yesterday today and forever I may not be able to produce it out in all these branches because of the old sap lines out here of denomination and Creed Cuts me off and drops me like a hot potato that may be true but I'll Stand loyal to that stump and I'll cry that hour will come God will restore his church to his original condition Hallelujah but I want you to understand brother Branham didn't have to dial this stuff he pointed to a God who said I will restore and there is a bride who has come out of that stuff and right now she has got her branches up in the light and the evening light is signing on it and fruit is coming on that tree Hallelujah and she's producing the original fruits of the tree when it was first planted because she's predestinated now glare won't do that the evening light is the only thing that will produce it and it's the same as the Morning Light the evening light and The Morning Light is the same what God did in the beginning God is doing now what he did in Groom form he's doing now in Bradford come on somebody amen this is where we're at amen the evening light brings even results amen is promised to bring forth the mature fruit amount of mature tree with ripened fruit ah brother Tim that's why we don't want shouting speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit because that's gray and green and you know we're really ripened we're really yeah we're really ripened we're really over ripe fruit oh mature Church is one who produces The Man Child Christ is an immature church that's void of the power of God in an amateur Church and man you don't expect fruit but in a mature Church you should expect mature fruit if the next election knowledge and sophistication is not mature that's how they did it in the green stage of Luther and Wesley but only when the church's atmosphere turns back to Acts 2 again only then we'll be we be the mature seed that was the grain so therefore in order to have the full ripen we've got to have the same Holy Spirit working in the same manner as it did in Acts 2. because that's what produced the morning light produced to ripened tree and so the evening light does the same thing so there has to be the atmosphere of Acts 2 again as brother Branham says this and and just to show you this he said it takes the spirit of God to bring life that life must not come out of just an intellectual Revival it's got to come out of the Bible a word Revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls and quickens you get the same results you got in Acts too amen exactly it always has and it always will be because the spirit of God conditions the atmosphere well we don't want that atmosphere brother Tim we we want an atmosphere that produces a character that came what else is going to produce this character amen the spirit of God conditions the atmosphere and it brings it back to Acts 2 that produces Sons and Daughters of God who have the character of The King see a word results brings the same results of Acts 2 it always will and it always has and it always will but the problem is men take the message the pure great the pure wheat the unadulterated word okay can I can say it anyway different do we grain and it run it down in the basement of Baptist theology saying you receive the Holy Ghost upon believing would you believe the message or when you accept this Doctrine you have run down and you have taken the wheat grain down into the a Baptist basement come on amen you see and yeah it may there may be some good people come out of that it's Baptist and Lutheran and Presbyterian glare that says that we're we receive the Holy Ghost without knowing it what we get it today we don't know it brother Tim come on you think I'm joking but I've heard message preachers actually see that we get the Holy Ghost today and we don't know we got it well that's not the conditions it was in Acts 2. everybody knew these were drunk on new wine everybody knew these were under an anointing everybody knew come on somebody amen that their lives were changed it took those who were scared and afraid to mentality and made them out of the real Believers and said this is that which the prophet Joel spoke of I'll pour out my spirit in the last day by the Light by the light is that you receive the Holy Ghost as an experience an experience of Acts 2 something happens the Breath of God fills you and you receive overcoming power to live and overcoming life now neither do we accept the Azusa Street glare of the confusion of tongues and you have the Holy Ghost that's how too is a mirage it's a false life but nevertheless it takes the right atmosphere to bring life healing or Miracles and for all the words to be manifested an atmosphere comes because of the strength of the Sun now I want to get to you your scripture or where you find yourself in the Bible in the last day is right here revelation 10. and when he comes his face is as the light of the Sun no Darkness the expression of God today is in the full strength of the light now again you cannot ripen even real word in a basement you cannot take it down into baptism Presbyterian or Catholic theology or even Pentecostal Azusa Street theology you've got to bring it to the atmosphere of Acts 2. and only then will it bring forth life for a harvest now so the glare of another age that says the days of Miracles has passed now that may have been true in Luther's age somebody with me the days of Miracles may have been passed maybe all the Miracles they had was looking back to the book of Acts but that's not where we're living are you with me amen Baptist time you know where where that where that that all they got was the light of of water baptism that might have been okay in the Baptist hour and they could say days of Miracles have passed and we don't have Divine healer but that's not true today we have matured past that come on Church even the Souza sweep up matured past that and if you don't have Miracles and signs and wonders then you're not even Victorious Azusa Street you are green green green green Green without Miracles our bodies won't change amen without faith we can't please God without healing we're robbed to the signs that follow them that believe for they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover without tongues we don't have the language of Heaven it's a false light that says we don't need miracles oh it's not the season for it without faith to believe for healing we can't have faith for the change of body this is not the hour of less faith this is our of more faith now listen I'm going to try to close on this I preached one time last month I won't make it all up today but you hang with me just for a little bit more because I want you to see clearly we have been brought out of the darkness don't go back in the basement we have been brought out of Darkness into light if I could bring this to an applicable way of even you in your personal life don't go back in the Darkness I can never make it I can never overcome I can never I can never I can never get over this sickness I I could never have my children say I can never get past that this is where we got to come to say there is nothing too hard for the Lord nothing but it looks impossible we're not talking about looks Sarah looked impossible now brother Brandon priests his sermon called there is a man here and I want you to notice he didn't say coming he said here I want to declare he has not left there is a man here present that can turn on the light and he preached it and part of his sermon he dealt with how that in England at that time this was 1963 and you can go and read about it that in England there was a great robbery that took place because of a false light and there was a train that was loaded with with gold and money of all kinds British pounds and and the what the thieves actually did was they used lights to slow down the train and to stop it and finally you know it come to a stop this is The Great Train Robbery of 1963 in England this gang of men they they robbed a male train I I at that time 2.6 million British pounds I I but today it's somewhere like 50 million in today's money and brother Branham took note of it because it was one of the greatest robberies that the world had ever known of up to that time and it happened when this train field of millions of British pounds was stopped by false light it went from green to red now I just want to stop and hear and interject when brother Branham was here I want you to know we had a train loaded down with goodness can anybody doubt that amen my you know it was filled with a load of abundance and it was headed toward Glory it had enough gold to save the Lost come on somebody it contained enough wealth to clothe and and throw a party for every prodigal it would heal every sick person it would cast out Devils it would change our bodies it would Rapture the church it was loaded down with goodness can you say Amen that was the Train the light was green and we were on our way you know going right down and then robbers started throwing red lights to stop the train bear with me for a moment but red lights like we don't need the supernatural you see that I take away from the prophet and who he is only he could be John 14 12 with John 14 12 is forever believer amen so we don't need we don't want that anymore so we'll just take that off the train and you can't have visions because only the prophet had that what the Bible said you don't hear what the Bible said I'll pour out my spirit Above All Flesh and my sons and my daughters have prophesied and all men some dreams and young men shall see visions yeah Hallelujah that's what's supposed to be on the train but the robbers put a red light we don't need Divine Healing it's just not the age and the season for that anymore you see it's the word age this is not the age for tent revivals well I'm not trying to get Sarah into a tent I'm trying to get Sarah out of the tent to the light we are no way trying to bring back the 40s and the 50s don't even accuse us of that amen we're not even trying to have 10 revivals my goodness we built a church amen we we we just want to see the bride's portion as it was said in perfect faith I'm trying to get the church into a place where we can really see Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger it's laying right at the door we see it we we want to see more of it we want it just to flow that it'll be a help to us and let's flow out to others hallelujah amen that ought to be the attitude of the church brother Brandon preaches his imperfect Faith how many wants perfect faith well that's how to reach for you you can't have perfect Faith only brother Branham had perfect Faith so that's not even for you you see that was for him you see that's a robber [Applause] amen that's a line sign that's a red light put in your way Amen brother Brandon never said those things he said we want to see Apostolic times amen we wanted to have such a flow well Robert say what but a supernatural experience with God we'll take that away too you don't need that and they probably they've robbed the train their healing was stopped Miracles were stopped come on now amen I I'm talking about we're actually robbers have stood by the track and put a red light to stop the moving of the Holy Ghost to stop the flow of apostolic time to stop and they're still doing it they'll get into pulpits and they will try to stop it amen and their healing was stopped Miracles were stopped Supernatural birth gave way to intellectual conceptions come on Buster Andy isn't that true Brothers you've been there hadn't you raised your hands your witness says what I'm preaching about right now what happened men put a stop God didn't his light was Green his life was the promises for you but men took the light listened they took the pure word that took the grade of the word and read it down to the basement and refused to let the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost come upon the promise of the Lord to manifest what the truth of it was all right oh we have a more excellent way yeah we're being robbed this you see we we don't lay hands on the sick are you spiritually crazy are you spiritually crazy enough to believe that well we have something greater you see we have perfect love and it's a better way well there's a lot of sickness healing I sure wish you'd use that love well we but we have a more excellent way I'd like to read the more excellent way would you like to read it with me in First Corinthians 2 28 12 28 and God set some in the church first apostles secondary prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles Gifts of healers helps governments diversities of tongues or all Apostles are all prophets or all teachers or all workers of Miracles I have all gifts of healing do all Spirit of tongues do all interpret it no that's among Believers every person doesn't have that but covet earnestly the best gifts actually he tells you twice covet desire strongly desire the best gifts and yet I want to show you a more excellent way so then Paul goes into First Corinthians 13 and you can put verse 1 up there and he goes to show that I could speak with tongues of men and angels and not have charity the basic element of God God is love I have become as astounding price or tickling sound and then he goes on to say in other words I'm just a bunch of noise I can have that and not have God and though I have the gift of Prophecy look at that and I understand all Mysteries uh oh that throws all of you horn Rim glasses out come on you're about to message nerds that have all the knowledge and understand all Mysteries looking at us to your horn Rim glasses saying we got it all and do I have all faith that I can move mountain and have not the love of God the very basic element of God I am nothing you see the more excellent way is not to have is not a church without prophecy without understanding mystery without having knowledge though without having faith without having you know the gifts of the Spirit without Heaven tongue that is not the more excellent way the more excellent way is to have the love of God the holy ghost in your life with all of that and you don't have the more excellent way without the other so the more excellent way is not the Holy Ghost without faith and Gifts of healing or Gifts of Prophecy or love which is the Holy Ghost yet with yet with no with no understanding of mystery the more absolute way is having the nature of God with faith in a move mountains come on how many third pull believers well guess what in the third pull you move mountains you say to this mountain be moved come on that's the third pole word without that you're not in the third pool amen the more excellent way is having the nature of God with the faith and the moon mountains with Miracles with signs and wonders and also to know the Mysteries and have all knowledge so don't tell me we have a more excellent way that excludes God's gifts because let's go back let's go back to where we started reading First Corinthians 12 28. let's go back to there for a moment I'm trying to bring this down and God placed in the church first of all apostles first thing he did was Call of 12. and then second Prophets third teachers and then Miracles and then Gifts of healing and helping and guidance and different kinds of tongues so the more excellent way then would have to include Prophets teachers apostles come on don't give don't get rid of that which you don't want amen because if you've got to get rid of the gifts to have the more perfect way hell then you've got to also get rid of tongues to have the more perfect way you also got to get rid of prophets teachers Apostles helps Miracles all of it but if you have the more perfect way you have God in the ministry in the prophetical gift God calling man God calling the elect come on somebody God moving in the church that's the more perfect way it's the more excellent way now so there again is the glare of a false light that says we have a more excellent way by not having the signs that follow them believe but you know signs don't follow us but we got a more excellent way no you don't well do we don't speak with tongues but we because we got a more excellent way no you don't we don't have healing anymore and I can't Revival that's all passed you know because we got more excellent weight no you don't if you have the excellent way you have god with that so the train was loaded but when they got down to the end after being robbed all that was left on the train was a glare of a false light left only with a false illusion and when you have a false illusion then you pretend listen to me now you pretend the Holy Spirit comes down when I push play as if the Holy Ghost is bottled up and confined in a machine that's a mirage they pretend the token is there because they can show the devil a cassette that's a mirage that is a mental illusion others are just as bad they're traded the old-fashioned born-again experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for a Baptist easy believe in a a Baptist approach to Salvation the Holy Ghost without an experience and that is a false light some Churches are actually agrees me to say this but they actually pretend they can turn this service over to brother Branham we are now going to turn this service over to God's servant and Prophet brother Branham and they pretend that he's now preaching from the pulpit and you expect sane people to believe that you're in a basement that's mental and spiritual insanity they pretend to actually pretend listen setting up a speaker like this and piling up some hankies there getting brother branham's voice to play over the thing is now did everybody get their hanky that brother Brandon prayed over that's spiritualism brother bradham's not here to pray over our prayer prayer cloths amen God still got a Ministry on Earth God placed you in the church Apostles prophets teachers God put them there I tell you what you cannot take him out God put them in there but robbers do do you realize would take the broken bread somebody breaks it in front of the speaker makes it in front of the speaker takes the sip of the wine brother branham's voice is played over the speaker and we eat the communion bread and we drink the wine and and then the leader gets up sobbing and crying isn't it wonderful to have had God's Prophet to serve communion to us pretending so they pretend he's serving them communion they pretend they and others bring it down pretend they have the Holy Ghost just by embracing certain doctrines some pretend the Holy Ghost comes when they raise the hand you raise your hand you know preacher says raise your hands you want to accept Christ I want to say raising your hand is good you made a move for God you accepted Christ as your savior but follow through on receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see again again the others pretend like I said they have the Holy Ghost when they Embrace certain Doctrine is still living with dirty lives and when something they you know like disbelief the sign comes along the cow that cast out on the message they'd Fall Away they go back into darkness again you see it pretend to believe in healing but there's little or no manifestations of it hiding in the basement refusing the light living the glare had they been robbed and the train that was bound for Glory is sitting on the side and nothing in it by false light that's what the glares will do it'll give you a false light but I'll tell you what that's not the train I'm riding on this train I'm on has got healing in it this train I'm on has got miracles in it this train I'm always got the Holy Ghost in it this tree now I'm gonna come on somebody that's got the joy of the Lord everybody we can blow the horn we can shout all the way hey man we've got it we're loaded Hallelujah because the prophet of God looted the street from glory and we're not letting it robber on our train with some folks like this that can't happen anymore because we have been called out a Darkness into His Marvelous Light because we are a chosen generation a royal priesthood who gives praise to his name and you do it even when you don't feel like it you don't have to wait for a certain Revival to come by because you're a priest amen and you are offering spiritual sacrifices unto him and you come into church and whether you're here on the front or you're back in the mezzanine you get in the service and you put your heart into the service and you give a praise unto God and you worship God with all your heart with all your soul let the musicians come have you been
