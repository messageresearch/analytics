[30:47] age where there is a great

[30:54] because uh our own skills our own ways
[30:59] would not match the enemy amen but thank
[31:03] God we have a great God hallelujah
[31:06] hallelujah so I bring you greetings from
[31:09] my family my
[31:10] congregation and uh churches that are uh
[31:16] Associated uh with our little Ministry
[31:18] which most of them have met by uh bir
[31:22] Timothy also bir Tim during uh the youth
[31:28] Camp way back when uh they they've been
[31:32] a blessing to our young people and until
[31:36] now amen so we're looking forward that
[31:39] in in the future we will have them once
[31:41] again so God bless you this evening so I
[31:46] pray that uh the Lord will make his way
[31:49] as he always do amen so uh without
[31:54] further Ado I would like to read a
[31:56] portion of the scripture
[32:00] so it's it's really uh hard to think of
[32:04] what to
[32:05] preach especially knowing uh we have a
[32:10] great uh minister of the Gospel message
[32:13] gospel amen and uh we have great respect
[32:16] for uh brother Tim uh his ministry has
[32:21] inspired uh a lot of uh ministers Even
[32:25] in our country and all over the world
[32:27] world so may the Lord uh keep him
[32:32] blessed and healthy all the time
[32:36] Hallelujah till the Lord comes so God
[32:38] bless you let's read our uh starting
[32:41] scriptures this evening in the book of 2
[32:47] Samuel 2 Samuel
[32:50] 11 verse
[32:54] 1 it says
[32:56] here and it came to pass after the year
[33:00] was
[33:02] expired at the time when kings go forth
[33:05] to
[33:06] battle that David sent joab and his
[33:10] servants with him and all Israel and
[33:14] they destroyed the children of Ammon and
[33:17] besieged Raba but David tarried still at
[33:25] Jerusalem amen so let's read another
[33:28] scripture in the book of Ephesians
[33:30] chapter 6 10 and
[33:36] 11 it says
[33:38] finally my brethren be strong in the
[33:41] Lord and in the power of His
[33:44] might put on the whole armor of God that
[33:46] she may be able to stand against the Ws
[33:49] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[33:52] flesh and blood but against
[33:55] principalities against powers against
[33:58] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[34:00] against spiritual wickedness in high
[34:04] places Hallelujah let's bow our heads in
[34:06] prayer dear heavenly father we commit
[34:09] this service into your Mighty hands we
[34:11] commit this words Lord we need you and
[34:14] uh set your servant aside Lord and have
[34:17] your own way speak to each and everyone
[34:20] heart this evening Lord God as we put
[34:23] our full confidence in you Amen in Jesus
[34:27] Christ's wonderful F name and everybody
[34:29] say amen God bless you you may now be
[34:31] seated
[34:34] hallelujah amen
[34:36] so I know this is a very familiar
[34:39] portion of the scripture but what else
[34:41] is uh not familiar with the bride amen
[34:45] because in his mind amen we were in him
[34:49] before the foundation of the world and
[34:51] uh uh it's just a matter of uh bringing
[34:55] us out of our spiritual amnia and that's
[34:58] the very reason we realize we know who
[35:01] we are and uh uh we we believe the Lord
[35:06] has also uh revealed our position in his
[35:10] body amen so in this scripture we see
[35:14] that uh this
[35:18] is David is a man of war from his youth
[35:22] uh youth days and uh all throughout his
[35:26] life he's been fighting battles so he's
[35:29] not uh uh he's not new to battle but at
[35:32] this portion of the scripture amen this
[35:34] is a different kind of
[35:37] War because it
[35:40] says uh in in in verse one it says after
[35:43] the year was expired at the time when
[35:47] kings go forth to battle Yeah amen so we
[35:51] know that in in in wars in in in in many
[35:55] battles amen uh there's certain
[35:58] time and we're so familiar with this
[36:00] that uh uh the Kings or the heads of the
[36:05] state or Nation just stay in their
[36:09] Throne they stay in the palace they stay
[36:12] and they send all their armies to fight
[36:15] the battle and uh believing their
[36:18] strength will uh bring home the victory
[36:22] so the king's just uh waiting in his
[36:27] throne
[36:28] and uh just uh getting some reports
[36:31] updates on what's going on in the field
[36:34] amen but this is a different war in the
[36:37] sense that it says this is the time when
[36:41] even Kings joined the war
[36:45] yeah amen so that David's but uh uh in
[36:50] this situation where where Kings should
[36:52] go for to battle amen David sent joab
[36:56] and his servants with him and all Israel
[36:59] and they destroyed the children of Ammon
[37:01] and besieged Raba so uh at least they're
[37:04] still winning but they could not have
[37:07] full control of the kingdom of their
[37:11] enemy amen so they're just getting a
[37:16] little little grounds advancing little
[37:19] by little so and that should not be but
[37:22] said is here but David carried still at
[37:25] Jerusalem so he did not join the force
[37:28] amen he stayed in his kingdom he stayed
[37:31] in his Palace and and probably you know
[37:34] knowing David is not he's not a coward
[37:37] King and he was also willing to go to
[37:42] war amen but the the the Bible said
[37:45] David
[37:47] tared amen so if you look at the meaning
[37:51] you know if we we look uh of that verse
[37:55] uh Ted amen it it
[37:58] means to Lodge to stop
[38:02] over pass the night
[38:05] remain or
[38:08] delay
[38:09] amen uh another meaning is to
[38:13] complain so that's the meaning of tar
[38:16] amen so uh so he tared so that means he
[38:20] stayed he was supposed to be in the in
[38:22] the war joining his own Army but he
[38:25] tarried in Jerusalem
[38:28] Hallelujah and so this is where the
[38:31] problem
[38:33] came that's right so he sent his armies
[38:36] and he was just right
[38:39] there uh and the enemy just
[38:44] flooded into the
[38:47] palace
[38:51] yes so
[38:54] now it came now in verse two and it came
[38:57] to pass as in an evening tide that David
[38:59] arose from off his bed and walk upon the
[39:01] roof of the King's house and from the
[39:03] roof he saw a woman washing herself and
[39:06] the woman was very beautiful to look
[39:10] upon amen so maybe David just wanted to
[39:15] he he just delayed this uh uh his
[39:18] interest in going to war and just have
[39:20] to some kind of you know air and he went
[39:23] up and the enemy knew so the main the
[39:28] main thing here is that David was not in
[39:32] his rightful
[39:34] position at that particular time that's
[39:37] right so God always meets us in our post
[39:42] of
[39:44] Duty and the enemy just wants us to be
[39:49] just a little bit just probably an
[39:52] inch that we should be away from our
[39:55] rightful position or our post of Duty
[39:58] and he right there can attack us and
[40:01] this is what we see in this situation
[40:03] that in the evening tide uh uh David so
[40:06] he he rose from the from his bed amen
[40:09] and he saw him he looked down and he saw
[40:11] something down there and then in verse
[40:13] three and David sent an inquired after
[40:15] to the woman and one said is not this B
[40:18] Sheba the daughter of ilam the wife of
[40:20] UAH the he so notice that you know all
[40:24] the demons you know the greatest battle
[40:26] ever for brother bam said the battle is
[40:28] here in the m so that's why that evening
[40:32] I could say that David was not able to
[40:35] have a good sleep because in the morning
[40:39] he was still thinking of what he
[40:42] saw last night amen so then he inquired
[40:48] and who is that woman and David sent and
[40:49] inquired after the woman and one said is
[40:51] not this but shba the daughter of ilam
[40:55] the wife of Uriah the tight amen so just
[41:00] right
[41:02] there David knew that it was not good
[41:06] for him to get a woman married to
[41:10] another man so just right there when
[41:14] when when when the one who answered this
[41:16] inquiry he said the wife isn't he this
[41:18] the wife of Uriah the
[41:21] he amen but you see because David was
[41:26] already already not on his rightful
[41:29] position so now the devil is taking
[41:33] advancing more and more and taking full
[41:37] control amen of David and David was
[41:40] fighting his own
[41:42] battle because he was out of his
[41:45] position amen and so now he didn't stop
[41:48] there and in verse where he said and
[41:49] David sent Messengers and took her and
[41:51] she come in unto him and he lay with her
[41:53] for she was purified from her
[41:55] uncleanness and she returned unto her
[41:58] house and the woman conceived and sent
[42:00] and told David and said I am with child
[42:03] so David did not stop watching David did
[42:05] not stop you know just thinking of that
[42:07] woman amen he asked but he did not stop
[42:11] after he heard that this woman was
[42:14] married even to his own
[42:18] Soldier so he kept amen moving forward
[42:24] and and and and the situation was
[42:25] getting worse and worse worse and worse
[42:28] until that woman amen and and and uh uh
[42:32] uh woman uh that woman
[42:36] conceived amen now there is a
[42:39] result amen of something and now David
[42:43] has to answer for what he
[42:47] did amen but listen in verse six and
[42:50] David sent joab saying Send Me Uriah the
[42:53] heite and joab sent Uriah to David and
[42:56] when Uriah was come unto him David
[42:58] demanded of him how joab did and how the
[43:00] people did and how the war prospered
[43:03] amen so in eight and David said to Uriah
[43:06] go down to thy house and wash thy feet
[43:09] and URI departed out of the King's house
[43:11] and there followed him a mess of meat
[43:13] from the King but Uriah slept at the
[43:15] door of the King's house with all the
[43:16] Servants of his Lord and went not down
[43:18] to his house and me I could see how
[43:21] Uriah was so loyal and faithful to his
[43:25] King amen so so David wanted to make a
[43:30] remedy of the situation amen I hope
[43:33] we're going to see that he he asked
[43:35] Uriah to come home and stay with his
[43:39] wife that's right amen because you know
[43:42] in that way David would be able to
[43:46] justify amen the situation right amen it
[43:51] would appear in his kingdom that he did
[43:54] nothing wrong right amen but God did not
[43:57] allow it amen and out of his out of
[44:01] uriah's loyalty he stayed with this King
[44:05] and he said but Uriah slept at the door
[44:06] of the King's house with all the
[44:08] Servants of his Lord and went not down
[44:09] to his house and when they had told
[44:12] David saying Uriah went not down to his
[44:14] house David said unto Uriah CEST thou
[44:17] not from thy Journey why then did thou
[44:20] not go down unto thine house so as if
[44:24] David was concerned to you
[44:27] IAH amen why don't you miss your wife
[44:31] you've been in the war all along amen
[44:34] and you did not even see your own wife
[44:37] amen so hypocrisies coming
[44:41] in just a little space that David gave
[44:47] to the demon now the situation was
[44:51] getting worse and David said to youah I
[44:53] here today and tomorrow we let thou
[44:55] depart so you UAH AB in Jerusalem that
[44:58] day and the tomorrow and when David had
[45:00] called him he did eat and drink before
[45:02] him and he made him drunk and at even he
[45:04] went out to Lion his bed with the
[45:06] Servants of his Lord but went not down
[45:07] to his house and it came to pass in the
[45:10] morning that David wrote a letter to
[45:12] joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah
[45:15] and he wrote in the letter saying set
[45:17] you Uriah in the Forefront of the
[45:20] hottest battle and retire ye from him
[45:23] that he may be smitten and die and it
[45:25] came to pass when joah observed the city
[45:28] that he as anuah into a place where he
[45:30] knew that Valiant men were amen so we're
[45:35] not new in this portion of the scripture
[45:37] we know what have happened David wanted
[45:41] so from that
[45:44] little out of his post of Duty his
[45:49] situation seems to be out of Remedy
[45:53] that's right and the more he wanted
[45:57] to make things right the more he wanted
[46:00] to uh uh to to make that error that Sin
[46:05] appear to be nothing the more he is at
[46:09] the brink of being
[46:12] exposed Hallelujah so uh he wanted to
[46:16] justify and later on he he became
[46:19] hypocrite and then later on he want he
[46:21] committed a
[46:23] murder amen right
[46:28] now we're living in the day and
[46:30] age it's like we said this is the King's
[46:33] battle because everything is coming into
[46:36] full
[46:37] maturity denominations are coming into
[46:40] full maturity politics are coming into
[46:43] the its full maturity brother bam said
[46:46] politics is rotten to the core amen your
[46:50] uh
[46:51] presidential uh your
[46:54] presidential uh election is coming amen
[46:59] and uh I made the statement one time you
[47:03] know just just like you know whatever
[47:05] happens in your election
[47:09] amen it it is coming to a fulfillment of
[47:13] the
[47:16] prophecy if the if Cala
[47:20] wins then the prophecy of having a
[47:25] literal woman president
[47:27] will be
[47:30] fulfilled and if Donald
[47:33] wins then it must be the last
[47:41] Trump so nothing is left in this
[47:46] generation amen so everything is coming
[47:49] Amen to maturity but let me tell you
[47:52] this evening if politics is going into
[47:54] maturity denominations are coming into
[47:56] maturity there is also one that is
[47:59] coming into full maturity and that is
[48:02] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:04] hallelujah amen we're come we have come
[48:07] into that into that point where we
[48:09] realize who we are amen and what the
[48:12] Lord is doing in our generation amen we
[48:15] have come we have access Amen to
[48:18] everything that God has promised in this
[48:20] generation and the only thing that we do
[48:22] is just believe amen that what he had
[48:25] accomplished is is already made
[48:28] available in this generation Hallelujah
[48:31] so now uh I remember uh brother timoth
[48:34] is preaching right there in in uh in
[48:37] Virginia and and and uh uh he he
[48:40] preached about being certain in this
[48:42] uncertain time amen so we we're living
[48:46] Amen in in this age where everything is
[48:50] uncertain everything is you know uh uh
[48:54] uh you know
[48:55] even people people today are being
[48:59] confused even in their own
[49:02] gender amen so but there's a group PE of
[49:07] people that is so
[49:09] certain because the Lord has given us a
[49:12] message in this generation and the
[49:14] prophet of God said they men all along
[49:16] in Through the Ages God has
[49:19] predestinated a certain group of people
[49:22] Amen to recognize the day that they're
[49:25] living amen and and and thank God we're
[49:27] part of it now in the message the
[49:29] greatest battle ever fought and brother
[49:32] bham said the great hour of church is at
[49:34] hand that was in 1962 it was at hand
[49:37] there amen but let me tell you it's here
[49:40] now amen so the great hour of church
[49:43] charge is at hand soldier with armors
[49:46] gleaming colors Streaming Faith and
[49:48] doubt is setting yourself in array in
[49:50] this Tabernacle this morning he said
[49:52] doubt on one side faith on the other
[49:55] soldiers and at your post of Duty
[49:59] hallelujah our captain the Morning Star
[50:01] leads on he never goes back he never
[50:04] don't know the word Retreat he doesn't
[50:07] have to retreat amen certainly he said
[50:11] so he said the greatest battle ever
[50:13] fought she is going
[50:16] on he's right in here now she is going
[50:22] on right in here now yes sir between
[50:25] life and death between sickness and
[50:28] health between faith and doubt oh my
[50:30] between Liberty and bondage the battle
[50:33] is on Shine Your spear soldiers Palace
[50:37] up the armor God is getting his soldiers
[50:39] ready amen God anoints his army amen so
[50:44] we can we can only live by the kind of
[50:47] anointing we have amen we can only live
[50:50] by the kind of inspiration we have we
[50:53] cannot go beyond that Hallelujah and so
[50:56] now in this in this day and age we're
[50:57] living in this uh uh age where you know
[51:02] the uh uh uh the religious spirit amen
[51:06] the the uh all this you know in this age
[51:10] of uh uh
[51:12] lukewarmness amen is
[51:16] creeping not only in the denomination
[51:20] real but also creeping in into the
[51:23] circles of the message movement
[51:27] hallelujah amen so now uh uh uh we have
[51:32] come also to the point amen that Jud
[51:35] says in this message have come out amen
[51:38] people who who declared they believe the
[51:41] sign but now they disbelieve the sign
[51:43] already and trying to fight it trying to
[51:45] to refute everything trying to discredit
[51:48] the prophet discredit all the
[51:50] testimonies amen but let me tell you
[51:52] they're too late hallelujah it's been
[51:55] too late already
[51:57] Hallelujah and I'm thinking of Rebecca
[52:00] amen thinking of Rebecca when when she
[52:03] met elizer and and and and uh uh elizar
[52:07] described Isaac and and and even without
[52:10] physically seeing each other but because
[52:13] amen H uh uh Rebecca had an experience
[52:17] and she believed the messenger the one
[52:21] that was being sent by Abraham knowing
[52:25] Isaac very well amen he he he was able
[52:28] to present amen Isaac as if he's just
[52:31] right there amen she just believe what
[52:34] the messenger said amen and no one sto
[52:37] her amen so uh now you think when when
[52:42] Isaac and Rebecca got
[52:45] married and somebody will say oh that
[52:48] eliser is a false
[52:52] messenger what will Rebecca
[52:55] say you're too late I'm already married
[52:58] to
[52:59] Isaac I'm already won with Isaac you're
[53:02] too late amen hallelujah before me amen
[53:05] so now I have all these things and also
[53:07] we have come amen even our technology is
[53:11] has come you know we have this AI amen
[53:14] uh uh uh by by by by by its uh title
[53:19] itself it speaks for itself artificial
[53:24] intelligence amen so where will it bring
[53:28] you
[53:31] amen it ends in everything that is altif
[53:34] artificial that's but thank God we have
[53:37] our own AIS we have Almighty
[53:41] intelligence amen that is before the
[53:44] foundation of the world Amen so now
[53:47] everything so now let's
[53:50] see
[53:52] uh after all these things now
[53:57] David he had everything he had position
[54:01] he had wealth and uh
[54:06] uh he had
[54:09] power but David despite of all these
[54:12] things he come to a point when he was
[54:15] out of his position he lost
[54:18] something so that's why when we think of
[54:21] that song that he wrote in Psalm 51: 1-3
[54:26] when he said to the chief musician the
[54:28] psalm of David when Nathan the prophet
[54:31] came unto him after he had gone into
[54:33] BBA have mercy upon me oh God according
[54:38] to thy loving kindness according unto
[54:41] the multitude of thy Tender Mercies
[54:43] blout out my
[54:46] transgressions amen so and eventually
[54:50] later on we will see in verse 10 David
[54:53] said create in me a clean heart oh God
[54:55] and renew do a right Spirit Within Me
[54:59] cast me not away from thy presence and
[55:01] take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore
[55:04] unto me the joy of thy salvation and
[55:07] uphold me with thy free
[55:11] spirit
[55:13] Hallelujah we may have all the
[55:14] information of this message the message
[55:17] is searchable wherever you go you go
[55:19] online you can search you want to look
[55:21] for something amen and you can get any
[55:24] information regarding this message of of
[55:26] the hour
[55:28] Hallelujah but you come to church with
[55:30] long
[55:32] face amen you come to church without
[55:35] Joy amen because there is something
[55:38] wrong
[55:40] somewhere hallelujah amen so the reason
[55:44] why people could not express themselves
[55:48] amen the Bible said here amen restore
[55:51] unto me the joy of thy salvation amen
[55:56] David David knew he was a man after
[55:58] God's Own Heart David knew that God will
[56:02] not give him up but somewhere in his
[56:05] heart he didn't feel the joy he had no
[56:09] pre spirit amen before you know when he
[56:13] sit down and and and and and you know
[56:15] touch uh his heart and all the demons
[56:19] are being driven
[56:20] out but now the demons are no longer
[56:25] afraid
[56:26] yeah right because the demons knew that
[56:30] David was out of his
[56:33] position amen so when he wrote this song
[56:36] in verse one he made mention why he
[56:39] wrote that song he knew he was out of
[56:43] his position but now thank God Amen so
[56:46] uh uh you see
[56:48] God is only waiting for something and
[56:51] God always correct the error amen by
[56:55] sending being a
[56:58] messenger
[57:00] Hallelujah the prophet of God what
[57:02] happened to David amen it can happen to
[57:05] anyone amen it can it can happen he said
[57:09] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[57:11] and when David sinned before God God
[57:15] made David reap for what he sold and
[57:18] will never come short of
[57:22] that how many believes you're son of
[57:24] daughter of God this evening amen amen
[57:28] we are not excused said what happened to
[57:31] David when he was out of his
[57:35] position amen you we we saw what
[57:38] happened and brother bam said it can
[57:40] happen to anyone whether it's an
[57:43] individual whether it's a
[57:45] church whether it's a community or a
[57:49] nation God will require Judgment of sin
[57:53] yeah hallelujah amen so that's why when
[57:57] God calls us for a certain position to
[57:59] do to accomplish something we better get
[58:02] there right away and we should not miss
[58:05] any opportunity and then we give our
[58:08] best Hallelujah and so now all all these
[58:12] things have happened but but you see he
[58:15] started with little thing and in
[58:17] Ephesian Church age let me read this he
[58:19] said now the very name Ephesus as a
[58:22] strange compound meaning aimed at and
[58:25] relax
[58:26] yeah the high aspirations of this age
[58:29] had begun with the very name Ephesus and
[58:33] fullness of this or began with the
[58:35] fullness of the spirit the depth of God
[58:37] whereby they were aiming at the High
[58:39] Calling of God began to give way to a
[58:42] less watchful attitude a less Ardent
[58:44] following of Jesus Christ begin to
[58:46] manifest itself as an omen that in the
[58:49] future ages the physical vehicle called
[58:52] The Church would sink to an openness of
[58:56] the depth of Satan it become relaxed and
[58:59] was
[59:00] drifting already the age was backsliding
[59:03] it had left its first love the tiny seed
[59:05] planted in that Ephesian age would one
[59:08] day grow in the spirit of error until
[59:11] the foul birds of the air would rose in
[59:13] its branches so in offensive to human
[59:16] reasoning would that little plant appear
[59:18] to that new EVE the new church that
[59:20] again she would be deceived by Satan the
[59:24] Ephesian AE had presented to her the
[59:27] opportunity for God's best and for a
[59:30] while she prevailed and then relaxed and
[59:33] in that unguarded moment Satan planted
[59:37] the seed of complete
[59:41] ruination just from a little
[59:44] relaxation that's right amen just
[59:47] missing a simple
[59:50] opportunity everything was lost amen so
[59:55] every time so I remember uh you know in
[59:59] in our country during during World War
[1:00:01] II uh uh there was a US general named
[1:00:06] macartur is General macartur I don't
[1:00:09] know if there is their veterans here we
[1:00:12] appreciate uh so during World War II
[1:00:16] when our country was uh being concered
[1:00:20] by Japanese Imperial
[1:00:24] Army and the the war was getting harder
[1:00:28] and harder and and and there was an
[1:00:31] order for General marur to leave the
[1:00:34] Philippines at the peak of the war he
[1:00:37] had to leave the Philippines in order to
[1:00:39] support Australia during that time I'm
[1:00:42] not mistaken in
[1:00:43] 1942 and uh during that time while he
[1:00:47] was leaving his heart was broken but he
[1:00:50] had to follow order but he made a
[1:00:52] statement and he very popular in the
[1:00:54] Philippines that he said
[1:00:56] but he said I shall
[1:00:59] return amen so if you say that even in
[1:01:01] the young student in the Philippines I
[1:01:04] shall return it is a tou with General
[1:01:07] MacArthur so in 1942 and then he
[1:01:10] supported the war in Australia and then
[1:01:13] after 3 years in
[1:01:14] 1945 amen General marur went back to the
[1:01:18] Philippines and he made an announcement
[1:01:21] and not not shall I shall return and he
[1:01:23] said I have returned burn and in 1945
[1:01:28] amen the the city of Manila the the
[1:01:31] entire Philippines was being taken back
[1:01:34] amen but and so in in in in in one of
[1:01:38] the provinces where where General marur
[1:01:40] first landed that's in Tacloban late and
[1:01:43] then they have this place and they built
[1:01:45] monuments you have their General
[1:01:47] macartur going down to the ship and that
[1:01:50] reminds and in that Monument there is a
[1:01:53] portion of our former president that
[1:01:55] said amen now it is good amen it we we
[1:01:59] we appreciate I'm just repacing it uh uh
[1:02:01] General marur fulfilled in this spot his
[1:02:05] promised to the Filipino people to
[1:02:08] return
[1:02:10] indeed General macartur have returned
[1:02:13] fulfilling his promise but at the L part
[1:02:16] he said amen but during the three
[1:02:20] years amen of bitterest fighting amen
[1:02:26] our former president appreciated the
[1:02:29] Filipino guilia and the American
[1:02:33] soldiers because during those three
[1:02:36] years of serious battle amen this
[1:02:39] Filipino guilia and US soldiers amen
[1:02:42] they were not afraid the Death March and
[1:02:44] all these things amen everything

[1:05:29] cannot uh do everything but we we trust
[1:05:33] the Lord for everything so it says here
[1:05:36] in we we we try in Ephesian AG had
[1:05:38] presented to her the opportunity for
[1:05:41] God's best and for a while she prevailed
[1:05:43] and then relaxed and in that unguarded
[1:05:46] moment Satan planted the seed of
[1:05:49] complete ruination Hallelujah so but we
[1:05:53] see we're fighting the same devil
[1:05:56] amen now what brought back David is the
[1:05:59] same thing that will bring us
[1:06:01] back amen that we should always be on
[1:06:05] guard amen you may be a musician you may
[1:06:09] be a deacon trusty in the church or you
[1:06:13] may be just sitting there you're not
[1:06:17] just a visitor but you are part of the
[1:06:19] body we have a portion to
[1:06:22] accomplish Hallelujah remember the time
[1:06:25] you know
[1:06:26] you know it when you go to church you
[1:06:29] have your I don't know but you have your
[1:06:32] seats uh maybe some of you have favorite
[1:06:35] seats amen and just remember during the
[1:06:39] time when you are on your
[1:06:41] seat Hallelujah we have our position we
[1:06:46] have our rightful post of Duty amen and
[1:06:49] so now you see now let's move forward in
[1:06:52] 2 Samuel chapter 12 and the Lord sent
[1:06:56] Nathan unto
[1:07:00] David let's proceed to verse five and
[1:07:04] David's anger was greatly kindled
[1:07:06] against the man and he said to Nathan as
[1:07:09] the Lord leaveth the man that had done
[1:07:11] this thing shall surely die you know
[1:07:14] what Nathan said it he she he made a
[1:07:17] parable you know David what can you say
[1:07:20] Amen uh there is somebody there's a
[1:07:23] family very poor family
[1:07:26] and then uh H uh that they have uh this
[1:07:29] little thing a lamb amen but somebody
[1:07:32] who so powerful took the lamp
[1:07:35] amen and
[1:07:38] David was
[1:07:40] mad amen and he said the man that had
[1:07:44] done this thing shall surely
[1:07:48] die amen and that was him
[1:07:55] you know this is something that's why we
[1:07:58] see even for a man after God's Own Heart
[1:08:02] when he is so
[1:08:05] overpowered by the multitudes of
[1:08:09] devils he can manifest a life that
[1:08:13] should not be
[1:08:15] manifested so a pull pleds
[1:08:20] hypocrite right in front but that's the
[1:08:23] purpose of the prophet
[1:08:26] Amen to shake him up amen and so all
[1:08:29] these things we we we have we fully know
[1:08:32] this the rest of the story amen and in
[1:08:34] verse 12 for thou did it secretly but I
[1:08:37] will this do this thing before all
[1:08:40] Israel and before the son and David said
[1:08:42] unto Nathan I have sinned against the
[1:08:46] Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord
[1:08:48] also ha put away thy sin Thou shalt not
[1:08:52] die
[1:08:54] amen we know that David was not was was
[1:08:57] was
[1:08:58] forgiven but thank God in this
[1:09:00] generation we're not just
[1:09:03] forgiven we're
[1:09:06] Justified as if he have we have not done
[1:09:09] it in the first place because the blood
[1:09:12] of the Lord Jesus Christ still works
[1:09:16] today Hallelujah it has power in it it's
[1:09:20] been 2,000 years ago amen where where
[1:09:23] where his blood was dropped at the at in
[1:09:25] Calvary but it remains powerful until
[1:09:28] now there is always room at the cross
[1:09:31] amen when anyone amen anyone who wants
[1:09:34] to go back amen H H there is always a
[1:09:37] way amen and and and this is something
[1:09:39] that was not given to
[1:09:41] others
[1:09:44] amen that's right I remember
[1:09:47] Sarah and the wife of
[1:09:54] lot if we
[1:09:56] balance what they did Sarah
[1:10:00] made
[1:10:02] worse act against God he made God a
[1:10:07] liar he didn't she didn't trust God Amen
[1:10:12] but M Lord just look back yeah
[1:10:17] amen but there is something different
[1:10:19] with
[1:10:21] them because
[1:10:23] God had a covenant
[1:10:26] with
[1:10:28] Abraham but to lot there was
[1:10:33] none

[1:14:10] and sometime in June he called me said
[1:14:12] pastor Danny I'm here in the Philippines
[1:14:15] you know what happened he was kicked out
[1:14:18] by the
[1:14:19] denomination because he got so excited

[1:15:07] same amen so now so you see we we we're
[1:15:11] doing uh all these things and we just
[1:15:13] have to stay in our post of Duty
[1:15:17] sometimes we think of something so I'm
[1:15:19] thinking this is the brother that that
[1:15:20] the Lord will be using amen but look
[1:15:22] what have happened amen so I said amen H
[1:15:26] and he said I I still want to get that
[1:15:29] uh uh 2year missionary Visa but I will
[1:15:31] still preach the message I said you
[1:15:33] cannot do that amen because brother Bram
[1:15:36] said we need to be honest in everything
[1:15:38] that we do and by our honesty you know
[1:15:41] God will provide a way and here is the
[1:15:44] way this is God's way we have many
[1:15:46] outreaches in the Philippines if you in
[1:15:48] desire Ministry you can help in the
[1:15:51] ministry at least you're still in the
[1:15:52] Philippines with your family and now he
[1:15:55] he he followed my advice and he's
[1:15:57] working helping with us now going back
[1:15:59] to our subject now amen so you see David
[1:16:03] was out of his place yeah and so the
[1:16:07] demons amen number one he was now
[1:16:10] fighting his own battle number two he
[1:16:12] wanted to remedy The Situation Number
[1:16:15] Three the situation get worse amen and
[1:16:19] number four amen he committed a
[1:16:23] crime it was a premeditated murder that
[1:16:28] have happened Hallelujah but now how
[1:16:31] could how how how could he uh uh correct
[1:16:34] the things all this mess that he was in
[1:16:37] there's nothing he could do amen but he
[1:16:41] got the
[1:16:42] password and that password was to repent
[1:16:46] and say Lord I have sinned against you
[1:16:50] he went down and commit everything unto
[1:16:53] the Lord and now it's the the Lord
[1:16:55] making it right for his
[1:16:58] glory we do not in any way justify what
[1:17:03] David did I just want to drive my point
[1:17:06] here amen that after the thing was being
[1:17:09] corrected and David went back to what he
[1:17:13] was supposed to do amen you know uh what
[1:17:18] have happened you know David then uh
[1:17:23] went to war and in that war in no time
[1:17:27] he said in in in in uh in 2 Samuel 12:
[1:17:31] 29 he said now and David after he
[1:17:34] repented after the Lord has made
[1:17:36] everything amen correct amen and David
[1:17:40] gathered all the people together and
[1:17:42] went to rabba and fought against it and
[1:17:45] took
[1:17:47] it it was so fast right amen so when
[1:17:52] when he realized and he accepted that he
[1:17:55] committed an error he committed a
[1:17:58] serious offense against God he
[1:18:00] transgressed amen the word of God and he
[1:18:03] realized he was out of his position but
[1:18:06] when that thing was corrected already
[1:18:08] now he he he uh he wore his his battle
[1:18:12] robe amen and and took his Chariot and
[1:18:15] went to war in verse 29 and David
[1:18:18] gathered all the people together and
[1:18:20] went to rabba and fought against it that
[1:18:22] should be his position that's Hallelujah
[1:18:25] so our position should be should always
[1:18:27] be in the battle when we receive this
[1:18:30] message brother bam said we're not going
[1:18:32] on a holiday we're going on a war we are
[1:18:35] an enlisted Army of the Living God
[1:18:38] hallelujah and remember the battle is
[1:18:42] serious amen we have come to the point
[1:18:45] amen that the batt is so serious because
[1:18:47] everything goes so matur this in this is
[1:18:50] the age where we hear that people when
[1:18:52] something happen when a disaster
[1:18:54] happened amen there is a similar
[1:18:56] statement that people always use they
[1:18:58] say oh we didn't see this happen before
[1:19:02] yeah why because every disaster is going
[1:19:05] worse and worse Amen in politics oh we
[1:19:09] didn't see it happened
[1:19:11] before amen
[1:19:15] hallelujah in our problems in the
[1:19:18] challenges that we fight oh we didn't
[1:19:21] see this happen we never expected this
[1:19:24] come our way Hallelujah but think of the
[1:19:28] greatest enemy greatest challenge
[1:19:31] greatest struggle this evening think of
[1:19:34] the worst sickness this evening let me
[1:19:37] tell you God is able because the king
[1:19:41] Hallelujah this is not your battle he
[1:19:43] said this is not your battle this battle
[1:19:46] is mine and thank God we are on The
[1:19:48] Winning Side Hallelujah and so now he
[1:19:51] said now David gathered all the people
[1:19:55] he's no longer in his spiritual
[1:19:57] Amnesia amen and he didn't want to T
[1:20:01] again he immediately said God he
[1:20:04] gathered all the people together and
[1:20:06] went to rabba and fought against it and
[1:20:08] took it and immediately invery and he
[1:20:11] took their king's
[1:20:14] crown Hallelujah he got the king's crown
[1:20:18] from off his head the way there up was a
[1:20:20] talent of gold with the precious stones
[1:20:22] and it was set on David's head and he
[1:20:24] brought for the spoil of the city in
[1:20:26] great abundance amen so when everything
[1:20:30] was right what what makes it right
[1:20:32] number one he realized his position he
[1:20:36] should be in the war yeah
[1:20:39] Hallelujah he should be in the
[1:20:44] war and he fought the War and he
[1:20:48] overcome it
[1:20:50] Hallelujah but you know
[1:20:55] in
[1:20:56] Revelation chter
[1:20:58] 9:1 they had a king over them which is
[1:21:02] the Angel of the bottomless pit whose
[1:21:05] name in the Hebrew tongue is abadon but
[1:21:07] in the Greek tongue had his name
[1:21:10] apolon Hallelujah this is another
[1:21:13] Revelation
[1:21:15] 9911 amen that the enemy the king amen
[1:21:20] hallelujah so that's why brother bam
[1:21:23] made mention in this generation
[1:21:25] about about a rider in the P seal he
[1:21:29] said
[1:21:30] notice this Rider is nothing but Satan's
[1:21:37] Superman an incarnate devil his educated
[1:21:42] genius now I hope you got your ears open
[1:21:45] they were trying one of his children out
[1:21:47] not long ago in television cast to see
[1:21:49] if it wasn't smarter than the next manth
[1:21:51] to run for presidency but however
[1:21:55] he's got a lot of wisdom so has
[1:21:59] Satan so Satan has
[1:22:03] Superman in this
[1:22:06] age amen but if we a Superman we have a
[1:22:10] supernatural
[1:22:12] God hallelujah we have a supernatural
[1:22:15] God we just have to
[1:22:17] realize where we should be in our
[1:22:20] rightful position amen before
[1:22:25] I read few more scriptures I just want
[1:22:28] to relate this portion in the Book of
[1:22:30] Judges how important our rightful
[1:22:33] position
[1:22:35] is notice in Judges chapter 20 in verse
[1:22:38] 12 he said and the tribes of Israel sent
[1:22:41] through men through all the Tribe of
[1:22:43] Benjamin saying what wickedness is this
[1:22:45] that is done among you now therefore
[1:22:48] Deliver Us the men the children of
[1:22:50] billar bad which are in GI that we may
[1:22:53] put them to death and put away evil from
[1:22:55] Israel but the children of Benjamin
[1:22:58] would not hearken to the voice of their
[1:23:00] Brethren the children of Israel but the
[1:23:03] children of Benjamin gathered themselves
[1:23:05] together out of the Cities unto gbea to
[1:23:08] go out to battle against the children of
[1:23:10] Israel and the children of Benjamin were
[1:23:13] numbered at the time out of the Cities
[1:23:16] 20 and 6,000 men that Drew sword beside
[1:23:19] the inhabitants of GI which were
[1:23:22] numbered 700 chos men among all these
[1:23:26] people there were 700 chosen men
[1:23:28] left-handed everyone could sling stones
[1:23:31] at un hair breath and not miss and the
[1:23:33] men of Israel beside Benjamin were
[1:23:35] numbered 400,000 men that Drew sword and
[1:23:39] these were Men of War 18 and the
[1:23:42] children of Israel arose and went up to
[1:23:45] the house of God and asked counsel of
[1:23:47] God and said which of us shall go up
[1:23:50] first to the battle against the children
[1:23:52] of Benjamin and the Lord said Judah
[1:23:55] shall go up
[1:23:56] first before going to war they seek the
[1:24:00] counsel of the
[1:24:02] Lord they even asked God how we
[1:24:06] should place our soldiers who shall go
[1:24:09] up
[1:24:10] first and God said Judah shall go up
[1:24:15] first and the children of Israel rose up
[1:24:18] in the morning and encamp against GI and
[1:24:21] the men of Israel went out to battle
[1:24:23] against Benjamin and the men of Israel
[1:24:25] put themselves in a ray to fight against
[1:24:26] them at Gea and the children of Benjamin
[1:24:29] came forth out of GI and destroyed down
[1:24:32] to the ground of the Israelites that day
[1:24:36] 202,000 men now
[1:24:39] listen they did the right
[1:24:43] thing they knew they're going to
[1:24:48] war they knew they had to seek the
[1:24:50] Council of God if they are going to
[1:24:52] fight and God said go
[1:24:55] fight how are we going to arrange our
[1:24:58] soldiers our army who shall go first God
[1:25:01] said Judah shall come first so they
[1:25:05] obeyed every counsel of God and they had
[1:25:09] this full confidence that they're going
[1:25:11] to win the battle because they got God's
[1:25:17] word but it happened the other way
[1:25:19] around because on the first day they
[1:25:22] were destroyed down to the ground ground
[1:25:24] of the Israelites that day 20 and 2,000
[1:25:31] men how would you
[1:25:34] react others would say Lord we ask
[1:25:38] you
[1:25:40] Lord we seek your
[1:25:42] will Lord we prayed we open OB even
[1:25:47] obeyed how we will arrange the Army amen
[1:25:50] but said but we lost 22,000 men
[1:25:55] thousands of women thousands of mother
[1:25:58] lose their sons thousands of
[1:26:01] widows happened after obeying your will
[1:26:05] Lord amen but they did not do it instead
[1:26:09] in verse 22 and the people of the men
[1:26:11] Israel encouraged themselves and set
[1:26:14] their battle again in array in the place
[1:26:16] where they put themselves in Array the
[1:26:18] first day and the children of Israel
[1:26:21] went up and wept before the Lord until
[1:26:23] even and asked councel of the Lord
[1:26:25] saying shall I go up again the battle
[1:26:27] against the children of Benjamin my
[1:26:29] brother and the Lord said go up against
[1:26:31] him and the children of Israel came near

[1:27:20] said it doesn't matter what situation we
[1:27:23] have
[1:27:24] it's not the circumstances around us but
[1:27:27] it is our
[1:27:29] reaction on the things that's going on
[1:27:33] Amen don't question God simply because
[1:27:36] things are not going the way we are
[1:27:39] expecting amen as long as we know Lord
[1:27:42] this is your will Lord this is your
[1:27:44] advice Lord this is your message amen we

[1:28:11] for good amen because we love God Amen

[1:28:22] verse 26 then all the children of Israel
[1:28:24] and all the people went up and come unto

[1:29:42] he accomplished that already by his
[1:29:45] stripes we were healed hallelujah it's

[1:32:43] God the Earth builts out in TRS it's the
[1:32:46] Son of God and now he is here to the

[1:32:57] they looked up at him he said I am the
[1:32:59] Son of God I've just died at Calvary for

[1:33:06] of Destruction he had to witness to the
[1:33:09] lost that he was the son of God and them
[1:33:12] screaming for Mercy he had to shut the
[1:33:14] door CU they had spurn mercy and they

[1:33:47] when I took the life of the prophets I
[1:33:49] was sure I had you and I behead the John
[1:33:52] but now I've got you amen I can hear him
[1:33:57] as he rattles the scary key there of
[1:34:00] hell and Death on his side the keys that
[1:34:02] kept people shut up in for all those
[1:34:05] years he rattled it Jesus said I am the

[1:34:28] of everyone of them Sinners and now

[1:34:48] and hang it on his side and start to
[1:34:50] Glory he start for the heavens and me in

[1:34:58] cake amen and and and took the key amen
[1:35:01] and and give him a healthy kick and slam
[1:35:03] the door amen and he said from now on I

[1:35:08] him he said wait a minute there's
[1:35:09] another group over here had been job
[1:35:11] Abraham Isaac Sarah why Heaven wouldn't
[1:35:15] be heaven without Sarah and Abraham in
[1:35:17] it hardly there they were over here in
[1:35:19] Paradise they couldn't go in the
[1:35:21] presence of the father they lived under
[1:35:23] the burn sacrifice all they knew how to
[1:35:25] do they were Justified but it couldn't
[1:35:27] divorce sin it could take sin amen it
[1:35:31] happened before amen by the Bloods of
[1:35:34] goats and Bulls of animals amen but how
[1:35:37] much more it is the blood of the son of
[1:35:41] the Living God the Lamb of God that
[1:35:43] takes away all the sins of the world we
[1:35:45] have him Hallelujah and so now amen he
[1:35:49] went down
[1:35:51] there don't get me wrong
[1:35:54] but I can say you know that the first
[1:35:57] Revival happened in
[1:36:05] hell when the king went down
[1:36:08] there and took the keys of
[1:36:11] death and one by one the doors
[1:36:15] open now you take yourself they've been
[1:36:19] bound in
[1:36:21] Hadis amen everyone that di they were
[1:36:24] they were there
[1:36:25] waiting for the coming
[1:36:28] King waiting for somebody to lose them
[1:36:32] because that's not their place they
[1:36:34] should be under the altar of the Lord
[1:36:37] amen and so when he came down there
[1:36:39] Hallelujah he called Abraham he called
[1:36:42] Sarah he called job he he called
[1:36:44] everyone of them Hallelujah and what
[1:36:46] would you feel and I could feel how amen
[1:36:50] when job saw amen that when he said that
[1:36:53] hundreds or thousands of years ago he
[1:36:55] said I know my redeemer leave it and now
[1:36:58] job was right there this is my redeemer
[1:37:01] he's really alive he came down to pick
[1:37:03] me up you think job will not jump you
[1:37:05] think job will will just sit down right
[1:37:07] there when he realized his own Redeemer
[1:37:10] came down to get him and put him under
[1:37:13] the
[1:37:14] altar
[1:37:15] hallelujah amen hallelujah so don't get
[1:37:19] me wrong when I say that because I mean
[1:37:22] something have happened happened and not
[1:37:24] only that you know 2 thou or or 6,000
[1:37:27] years
[1:37:29] ago through the serpent
[1:37:33] Amen in God's
[1:37:36] Eden
[1:37:38] Satan took the
[1:37:42] woman that's in God's
[1:37:44] Eden amen but nothing happens by
[1:37:47] accident God permitted that to happen to
[1:37:50] show his power that he's able to bring
[1:37:54] everything back in its rightful
[1:37:58] position Hallelujah so let it go and let
[1:38:01] Satan and for the span of 6,000 years
[1:38:05] amen from the time in the Garden of Eden
[1:38:09] where the woman the men
[1:38:12] fell Hallelujah 6,000 years and all
[1:38:17] through those years until now Amen
[1:38:21] brother Brandon preached amen about and
[1:38:24] and he described amen this is Satan's
[1:38:31] Eden the prophet declared that this
[1:38:34] world has far become Satan's
[1:38:39] Eden but it happened for a
[1:38:42] purpose so that what happened in the
[1:38:45] garden of
[1:38:46] God where Satan took the
[1:38:49] woman now after 6,000 years of of
[1:38:53] establishing his kingdom here on Earth
[1:38:56] to make this Satan's Eden once again
[1:39:01] Hallelujah he came with his full
[1:39:04] power amen I remember brother brandham
[1:39:07] when he was just right there Amen in the
[1:39:11] mountain and when he raised his hand
[1:39:14] something fell into his hand and he felt
[1:39:17] something and he said it's not aching
[1:39:21] sword
[1:39:23] yes it's the king
[1:39:28] sword
[1:39:29] hallelujah it's the king
[1:39:31] sword and now that same King
[1:39:35] sword is in the hand of the Bride which
[1:39:39] is the revealed word of the
[1:39:41] hour Hallelujah it fits very well in our
[1:39:46] hand but you see I like what brother
[1:39:49] brandham said and probably I'm closing
[1:39:51] in this portion I like when brother bham
[1:39:53] said when he mentioned that he said now
[1:39:57] I was standing there in prayer and
[1:39:58] something happened and now something
[1:40:00] fell in my hand now I know if you don't
[1:40:03] understand spiritual things it may seem
[1:40:05] very strange but something struck in my
[1:40:08] hand when I looked it was a sword and
[1:40:11] the handle was made of pearl the
[1:40:13] prettiest Pearl I ever seen and the
[1:40:15] guard I guess it's keep you hands your
[1:40:18] hands from being Lance you know while
[1:40:19] you're the people were dwelling was gold
[1:40:22] and the same ne's blade wasn't too long
[1:40:25] but it was just razor sharp and it was
[1:40:28] glistening silver and it was the
[1:40:30] prettiest thing I ever seen it just pit
[1:40:33] my hand exactly and I was holding it I
[1:40:36] said isn't that pretty I look at it and
[1:40:39] I thought but you know I always afraid
[1:40:42] of a sword I was kind of glad that he
[1:40:44] lived out of the days that they used
[1:40:46] them because I'm afraid of a knife what
[1:40:49] would I do with that and while holding
[1:40:50] it my hand in my hand a voice from
[1:40:53] somewhere said that is the King's sword
[1:40:57] and then it left me I wondered what it
[1:40:59] meant this that is the king sword and I
[1:41:02] thought if would have said a king sword
[1:41:04] it might have been that I would have
[1:41:05] understood it but it said the king sword
[1:41:09] so my I may not have this right but I
[1:41:11] thought there's only one the king that's
[1:41:14] God and his sword is this sharper than a
[1:41:18] two-edged sword he abide in me and my
[1:41:20] words you see and he said now in the
[1:41:24] last part said I don't understand one
[1:41:27] word of it but or one principle of
[1:41:29] jewelling but the best of my
[1:41:31] understanding the knife striking across
[1:41:33] and then finally the swords if they lock
[1:41:36] the enemy and you lock the swords like
[1:41:38] this then it takes the Str strength of
[1:41:40] the man jeweling because his sword would
[1:41:43] be pointed to my heart and mind to this
[1:41:46] but they locked as are knives striking
[1:41:48] each other and then they strike and then
[1:41:51] the swords come together and the the one
[1:41:53] that can shove the other one down the
[1:41:55] sword straight to the heart and let me
[1:41:57] close with this statement and he said so
[1:42:00] it takes even though the sword be the
[1:42:04] word it takes the hand of strong
[1:42:08] faith to hold it there to bring it to
[1:42:11] the
[1:42:12] heart of the enemy
[1:42:17] Hallelujah we have the sword we have the
[1:42:21] word we have the promise
[1:42:24] 2,000 years ago he accomplished what he
[1:42:27] had to do that's right and this is not
[1:42:29] just a story this is a
[1:42:32] reality if it happened 2,000 years ago
[1:42:36] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:42:39] forever he is going to do what he had
[1:42:42] done 2,000 years ago it's here it's
[1:42:45] available but it takes the hand right of
[1:42:49] somebody who say he believes amen and it
[1:42:52] takes yeah there's no question about the
[1:42:55] word but how about the hand that holds
[1:42:58] it amen it has and it should have enough
[1:43:02] Faith to struck Into the Heart of the
[1:43:05] enemy Hallelujah and say Satan you are
[1:43:09] defeated yes and as brother Ron spener
[1:43:12] always say boo
[1:43:14] devil Hallelujah aren't you glad this
[1:43:16] evening we have the revealed word of the
[1:43:19] hour we have the manifestation amen We
[1:43:22] Believe Hallelujah that what he had done
[1:43:25] before amen is the same thing that he's
[1:43:28] doing today hallelujah thank God for the
[1:43:31] revealed word of the hour hallelujah
[1:43:33] thank God that when he went down amen
[1:43:35] 2,000 years ago the enemy has been
[1:43:38] defeated already we're fighting a
[1:43:41] defeated
[1:43:42] enemy Hallelujah we are standing on the
[1:43:45] side of a Victorious King who came down
[1:43:48] not just on Earth 2,000 years ago he
[1:43:51] came down to Hell Hallelujah so that
[1:43:54] those Souls that were in prison amen
[1:43:57] were being released they were being
[1:43:58] liberated and they were you know uhh
[1:44:01] went went back amen and and and and that
[1:44:04] uh uh there were tombs that were opened

[1:44:16] they came up came up up again amen and
