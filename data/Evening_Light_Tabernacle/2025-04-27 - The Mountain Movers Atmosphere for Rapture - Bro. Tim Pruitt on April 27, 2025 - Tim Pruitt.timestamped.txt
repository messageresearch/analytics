[32:56] Atonement, changed, delivered, set free.
[33:00] I see what God's done for
[33:05] [Music]
[33:06] you. I watched you break through.
[33:11] [Music]
[33:14] [Applause]
[33:23] Hallelujah. There's nothing like
[33:25] watching that happen. God comes down and

[36:59] Amen. Let's just worship the Lord
[37:01] together. Brother Phil leads us in this
[37:04] song.
[37:14] And one day I'm
[37:16] going to take a step towards my
[37:21] theophony. And one day I'm going to take
[37:25] another
[37:27] step into my
[37:30] theop. And one day I know that that
[37:34] final step oh is going to set me free.
[37:40] Not the
[37:41] off. Oh, I hear it calling
[37:46] me. Can't you hear it calling? Come
[37:49] up a little
[37:51] higher into the perfect world. Oh, come
[37:57] up a little
[37:59] higher into the agath love. Oh, come up
[38:06] a little higher.
[38:08] Soaring through the
[38:10] heavenly might
[38:13] theophony. Oh, I hear it come with
[38:18] me. Oh, and don't you worry, little
[38:23] children should knock on your door.
[38:27] Don't you know
[38:29] that? Oh, it's just a doorway. Oh, and
[38:32] it leads to that
[38:34] heaven. Oh, over there.
[38:38] There's no heartache. There's no sorrow,
[38:41] grief, nor pain. Oh, just perfect love.
[38:45] Oh, peace and joy beyond
[38:50] compare. And one day I'm gone to take a
[38:55] step towards my
[38:58] theop. And one day I'm going to take
[39:02] another
[39:03] step into my
[39:05] Theopathy. And one day I know that that
[39:10] final step, oh, it's going to set me
[39:14] free. Oh, might
[39:16] the Oh, I hear it calling
[39:20] [Music]
[39:22] me. Over the next hill. Well, I look.
[39:27] Oh, I can see complete victory up around
[39:31] the next curve in the road. That old
[39:35] devil, he's got to flee. Cuz God's army,
[39:39] she's
[39:40] marching, marching onward to slay that
[39:44] old enemy up around the next curve. I
[39:48] see King Jesus coming for
[39:52] me. Oh, and one day I'm going to take a
[39:57] step towards my
[40:00] the one day I'm going to take another
[40:05] step into my
[40:08] the one day I know that final step he's
[40:14] going to set me free. Not the
[40:18] offering. Oh, I hear him calling
[40:22] me. Oh, and just over the next hill.
[40:27] Well, I look. Oh, I see a series of
[40:31] victories up around
[40:34] the road. That old devil, he's got the
[40:39] flee. Cuz God's army is marching,
[40:42] marching onward to slay that old
[40:46] enemy around the next curve. I see King
[40:50] Jesus come for
[40:53] me. Oh, and one day I'm going to take a
[40:58] step towards my theop.
[41:02] And one day I'm going to take another
[41:06] step into my theop. And one day I know
[41:13] that final step. He's going to set me
[41:17] free. My
[41:19] theophony. Oh, I hear it calling
[41:23] me. Oh, and can't you hear it calling?
[41:26] Come up a little
[41:29] higher into the perfect word. Oh, come
[41:34] up a little
[41:36] higher into the agape love. Oh, come up
[41:43] a little higher. Soaring through the
[41:47] heavenly my
[41:49] theophony. Oh, I hear it calling me. Oh,
[41:54] and can't you hear it? Hear it calling.
[41:56] Come up a little
[41:59] higher into the perfect word. Oh, come
[42:05] up a little
[42:07] higher into the agot they love. Oh, come
[42:12] up a little higher. Soaring through the
[42:17] heavenly mighty
[42:20] off. Oh, I hear him calling me.
[42:30] the Lord.
[42:32] Glory.
[42:33] Hallelujah.
[42:35] Amen. Praise the
[42:37] Lord. Can you hear him calling you this
[42:40] morning? Come up a little higher. You've
[42:43] been earthbound too long. It's time to
[42:45] sail in the heavenlies where all things
[42:48] are possible to them that believe. Amen.
[42:53] Hallelujah. Amen. The theophony, what is
[42:57] that? It's that word body. It's what we
[43:01] bypassed. We didn't get to go into that
[43:03] form when we come down here to be
[43:05] tempted and tested and tried by sin
[43:08] because of what Adam did. But oh,
[43:11] hallelujah.
[43:13] Amen. We're headed back to the original
[43:16] thought that God had us before the
[43:18] foundation of the world. And I want to
[43:21] take another step toward it this
[43:23] morning. Amen. I want to step it a
[43:25] little higher till I just step into that
[43:28] agape love into that
[43:31] atmosphere where heaven comes down and
[43:34] the spirit of God moves and where all
[43:36] things are possible to them that
[43:39] believe.
[43:40] Amen. And amen. God bless you. Amen.
[43:44] Ain't it good to be back together again?
[43:47] I hope you had a wonderful Easter. we
[43:49] did down at camp. And if you didn't
[43:51] stream the services, well, they're there
[43:53] for you to do and it would be a
[43:55] blessing. I know. And brother Ron wrote
[43:58] me this morning and said he felt really
[44:00] good. So, we're so thankful for that,
[44:04] what the Lord's done for him and doing
[44:06] for him. And I believe he'll finish the
[44:08] work. He goes for some bobsies this week
[44:11] on his kidneys. So, just remember that
[44:14] in prayer. We just believe between now
[44:16] and then it'll all be good.
[44:18] Amen. Just one step away. That may be
[44:22] the way you are this morning. Just one
[44:23] step away from your miracle. What you
[44:26] need in your life. Amen. That you can
[44:28] take another step. Maybe you're sick.
[44:31] Well, you can hold before you then the
[44:33] vision of a perfectly healed body and
[44:36] step by step walk into it. Amen. Maybe
[44:39] you're filled with complexes and
[44:41] problems and situations in your life.
[44:43] Well, I tell you what you can do. Hold
[44:45] before you a perfect man. in the stature
[44:48] of the fullness of Christ and step by
[44:51] step you walk into it. Amen. Move a
[44:55] little higher with him today. God bless
[44:57] you and so thankful to be gathered
[45:01] together. We are want to welcome this
[45:04] morning especially our brother Jason,
[45:07] sister Shanica Green. They're here right
[45:09] back there. Raise your hand so everybody
[45:11] know who we're talking about. Way high.
[45:13] Come on. They want to know who that is.
[45:15] Amen. God bless you.
[45:17] They're going to be sojouring with us
[45:20] and u they uh well we couldn't say
[45:24] anything about it till they officially
[45:25] done it. So you know we you've seen them
[45:28] from service to service time to time but
[45:31] they're not visitors anymore. So we're
[45:33] going to put a sword in their hand and
[45:35] we're going to say hey whatever talent
[45:38] you got use it for God. Amen. We ain't
[45:41] going to take no backsliding stuff
[45:43] hiding in a few somewhere sitting down
[45:46] doing nothing. We're going to see them
[45:47] work for the kingdom of God. Amen. Not a
[45:50] minister anymore. Going to put your
[45:52] shoulder to the wheel. Move on. Amen.
[45:56] That's what we do. Amen. God bless you.
[46:00] Let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11 and
[46:03] we're going to look at verse five for
[46:05] our scripture reading this morning. And
[46:07] I'll tell you, um, you know, if
[46:11] you you today, I hope you're prepared
[46:14] for the service of God and your your
[46:19] physical bellies are are full enough
[46:21] that you can last a little bit and we'll
[46:24] get through this sermon this morning.
[46:27] Amen. If I hear too much growling, well,
[46:29] I'll just uh I'll just rebuke the
[46:34] devil. Amen. Oh, isn't God good to us?
[46:37] He gives us so many blessings. And we're
[46:41] undeserving, of course, but you know,
[46:44] he's not looking at us. He's looking at
[46:47] our
[46:48] sacrifice. And because of that, we're
[46:51] perfect through him.
[46:54] Um looking at Hebrews 11:5, remembering
[46:57] our theme now, who art thou, oh great
[47:00] mountain, thou shalt become a plain, and
[47:03] the headstone shall be brought forth
[47:05] with shoutings, crying, grace, grace
[47:09] unto it. By faith, Enoch was translated
[47:12] that he should not see death and was not
[47:16] found because God had translated him.
[47:18] For before his translation, he had this
[47:21] testimony that he pleased God. How many
[47:24] wants Enoch's testimony that you please
[47:26] God? Amen. But without faith, it is
[47:31] impossible to please him. For he that
[47:33] cometh to God must believe he is, not
[47:37] was, will, not will be, not future tense
[47:40] or past, but the present tense, I am
[47:43] God. and that he is a rewarder of them
[47:47] that diligently seek him. Oh, that men
[47:51] might seek the Lord. God bless you. Can
[47:53] be seated. Going to be speaking on the
[47:57] atmosphere for
[47:59] rapture. Amen. What a wonderful song to
[48:02] come out on. My theophony is calling
[48:05] me. And you know, step out a little
[48:08] higher into that agopa love. And I think
[48:11] that'll go exactly with what we're
[48:12] speaking on
[48:14] today. Rapture faith is an atmosphere of
[48:18] power and authority. A people
[48:22] uh that have that rapture faith are
[48:25] people that know their God and
[48:28] understand their position in him. And
[48:30] those that know their God, the Bible
[48:32] said, will do exploits.
[48:35] So we we were told even in the sermon
[48:38] where brother Brandham preached on
[48:40] perfect faith. He said you know what he
[48:42] was trying to get the church was into a
[48:46] place or to move into a realm where we
[48:49] see apostolic times again the power and
[48:52] the works of the early church moving
[48:54] among us. And he declared that it's
[48:57] laying right at the door. I I pray it'll
[49:00] open to you today, you know, to open to
[49:03] all of us that uh where that we walk
[49:07] into that realm where that we see
[49:11] scripture fulfilled in our lives and and
[49:14] apostolic times again. We see only
[49:16] glimpses of it right now. But we desire
[49:20] or we should desire a greater flow. A
[49:23] flow so strong that it'll not only bless
[49:25] us but it'll pour out through us to
[49:29] others. But how are we going to do it?
[49:32] It's going to be by climbing higher in
[49:35] the realms of faith. And this is why I
[49:39] continue to preach uh that you are to
[49:42] move mountains, that you are to get the
[49:44] obstacles out of your way where we can
[49:47] believe God for a rapture. You know,
[49:50] Enoch pleased God. How did he please
[49:52] God? The Bible said by faith. And we
[49:55] we're going to need the same rapturing
[49:58] faith that Enoch had. His faith pleased
[50:01] God. And we must walk in an atmosphere
[50:05] where all things are possible.
[50:08] You know, after God has confirmed his
[50:09] word, it would be a sin for us to
[50:13] disbelieve. We should believe in all
[50:16] things and all miracles and and believe
[50:19] that there is nothing impossible with us
[50:21] as believers. Now, sin doesn't mean just
[50:25] go out and drink or living wild again.
[50:28] No, that sin is deeper than that. To sin
[50:31] is to disbelieve. And Jesus said, "Go
[50:34] and sin or disbelieve no more." And you
[50:37] know that's the whole heart of this. And
[50:39] you know, brother Brandon believed um
[50:43] what one of the issues of the day was.
[50:45] It was that so many believers don't know
[50:48] who they
[50:49] are. That positionally they don't know
[50:52] their position in Christ. We heard a
[50:54] tremendous message Wednesday night on
[50:56] that. and uh of having faith in our
[50:59] position and our calling and they the
[51:03] problem is that too many forget their
[51:05] identity. It happens often you know when
[51:08] we get sick or we we're oppressed by the
[51:10] devil that we forget who we are and and
[51:14] we begin to look at our own selves and
[51:16] our own problems and our our weaknesses
[51:19] instead of looking at what we are
[51:22] offering a perfect sacrifice.
[51:25] And we and we forget that what that
[51:27] perfect sacrifice has made is because
[51:30] you are sons and daughters of the living
[51:32] God. And I'm not talking about someday.
[51:35] I'm talking about right now. Too often
[51:38] we're waiting on something great to come
[51:40] when not realizing the greatest gift has
[51:42] already been given to you. And that's
[51:44] the Holy Ghost. Is Christ in you, the
[51:47] hope of glory. The Bible says that now
[51:51] we are the sons of God. Not that we will
[51:53] be, we are now.
[51:55] And I want to just say that that means
[51:57] we're not beggars that are crawling in
[51:59] the dust and begging for a spiritual
[52:03] handout. But we are sons and daughters
[52:05] of the king. And the Bible said we are
[52:08] now sitting together in heavenly places
[52:11] in Christ Jesus. And he meant right now,
[52:15] not future, not one day, not in the
[52:17] millennium. There is a throne in the
[52:19] millennium and we will be enthroned with
[52:21] Christ. But right now, we are seated
[52:24] together in heavenly positions in Christ
[52:27] Jesus th enthroned with him. And let me
[52:31] tell you what, when that kind of faith
[52:33] gets rooted in the church, when it gets
[52:36] really down under the fifth rib, you
[52:38] know the the devil, he can't stay any
[52:41] longer. He has to flee. He loses his
[52:43] crown. He has no hold over our lives.
[52:47] Amen. Oh, to be that church. Brother
[52:49] Brandham talked about that Satan, you
[52:52] know, didn't know what to do with
[52:54] because they so completely were trusting
[52:57] and in the will of God. And let me tell
[53:00] you something again and knowing our
[53:02] position, we remember Satan has no legal
[53:06] rights over a bornagain believer. None.
[53:11] None whatsoever. So we're not spiritual
[53:14] beggars. We have received the riches of
[53:16] his grace. For when a man or a woman
[53:19] gives her heart to Christ, God hands to
[53:22] them a whole stack of blank checks
[53:25] signed with the name that's above all
[53:28] names, Jesus. And he says, "Here, fill
[53:31] them out." Amen. I tell you, you know, I
[53:34] wonder today, are we afraid, too? Don't
[53:36] be afraid. Amen. The check is good. The
[53:39] deposit was made. Heaven, the bank of
[53:43] heaven is full of the riches of his
[53:45] grace. He is even coming down with
[53:48] double favor upon your life. Amen. Oh,
[53:51] we don't need to be afraid to fill them
[53:53] out. But whatsoever things you desire
[53:57] when you pray, you believe that you
[53:59] receive them and you shall have them.
[54:02] That's a promise. That's not a maybe,
[54:06] not a someday. Amen. But you you need to
[54:09] believe it. You need to receive it
[54:11] today. You need to walk in that perfect
[54:14] faith as Lena did. As his faith became
[54:17] mature, it went from faith to faith
[54:21] until it became a rapturing
[54:24] faith. No doubt it started off just like
[54:27] every one of us, a little tiny flame
[54:30] within our soul. But it began to grow
[54:34] until it changed from just a small
[54:38] little uh seed, a tiny seed of faith
[54:42] until it became a mighty blowing
[54:45] rapturing
[54:47] faith. Now, Brother Brandham told us, he
[54:49] said, "You've got to create an
[54:52] atmosphere, and your faith will do it."
[54:55] So in order for the word of the rapture
[54:58] to be come to life, that faith that was
[55:00] once delivered to the saints had to be
[55:03] restored. And I want to tell you, this
[55:06] message came to produce faith. It was to
[55:11] turn your heart back to believing again.
[55:15] Not believing less for things, but
[55:17] believing more. Amen. Expecting greater.
[55:21] You remember um you know they were all
[55:23] in the upper room with one accord and
[55:26] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[55:29] as of a rushing mighty wind. What
[55:31] happened? The atmosphere was right.
[55:34] Amen. It takes the atmosphere to do
[55:38] anything. You know the regular procedure
[55:40] to hatch out a a chick is to put them
[55:43] under a hen. You know, get that egg in
[55:45] the right atmosphere and it'll hatch.
[55:48] And and remember they even found out
[55:50] with incubators they can do the same
[55:52] thing you know with an incubator it's
[55:54] the
[55:56] atmosphere. Amen. It's the atmosphere
[55:58] and if you you get a person in the right
[56:01] atmosphere that it'll produce a newborn
[56:05] babe. Oh my. And brother Brandman said
[56:08] let this little handful of people
[56:11] sitting in here get in the perfect
[56:13] atmosphere and watch what take place.
[56:16] There will not be a feeble man or woman
[56:19] in our midst. The cripples will walk,
[56:21] the blind will see, the deaf will hear,
[56:23] the dumb will speak without prayer or
[56:25] anything. It's the atmosphere. He said
[56:28] that's how 25,000 were healed in one
[56:31] prayer in Africa. When they seen the
[56:33] Lord do something, it created the
[56:37] atmosphere and they stepped right into
[56:40] it. Amen. Like the pool when the water
[56:43] was running straight. Let me tell you, I
[56:45] believe the atmosphere has been
[56:48] created. But you got to get out of the
[56:51] doldrums of where you are and out of the
[56:54] atmosphere of Leodysia and move out into
[56:57] a heavenly realm. Amen. Where the
[57:00] atmosphere has been created where heaven
[57:03] can come down into a soul. Oh, I love to
[57:07] see it when heaven comes down and souls
[57:10] come to God and surrender their life to
[57:12] him. I love it when the atmosphere gets
[57:15] right and those that are sick are healed
[57:18] and depression leaves and spirits run
[57:21] out of the building. Amen. I love to see
[57:24] it when the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[57:26] comes and takes over a man or woman
[57:29] until they don't know what to do with
[57:31] themselves anymore.
[57:33] So surrender to God.
[57:36] I remember brother Brandham talking
[57:38] about this in calling Jesus on the scene
[57:41] when he spoke at right here in Louisiana
[57:43] down at Denim Springs and he said, "We
[57:46] just witness one of the greatest
[57:47] revivals I believe the world has ever
[57:50] seen these last 10 or 15 years. It's
[57:54] been a revival not just like the days of
[57:56] Bill Billy Sunday or the days of the
[57:59] West revival or the days of the Westland
[58:02] revival or Moody revival. It's been a
[58:05] worldwide sweeping affair around the
[58:09] world. Great healing services and great
[58:12] revival fires has burned on practically
[58:16] every heel there is in the world right
[58:18] now way over than the lands of Africa
[58:21] down in China, Japan. This gospel is
[58:24] being preached and people are being
[58:26] healed this right this very minute
[58:29] around and around the world. It's been
[58:31] one of the greatest revivals because I
[58:35] believe it's one of the last this world
[58:37] will see a world sweeping revival. But
[58:41] now in the last few years, it's
[58:43] quietened down. You don't notice the
[58:46] enthusiasm in the people that it used to
[58:49] be. Oh, brother Tim, we don't want to be
[58:52] enthused. Listen, Brother Brandham told
[58:53] us we should never lose our enthusiasm.
[58:57] Oh, he said, "I remember the privilege
[58:59] by the Holy Spirit to spearhead that
[59:02] revival that started when that angel of
[59:04] the Lord appeared on the river and said
[59:06] that about many years ago and to see it
[59:09] happen and see it set ministers hearts
[59:11] of fire everywhere and revival broke
[59:14] out. Why you could just simply listen,
[59:17] you could just simply walk into a
[59:19] building and people would just get out
[59:22] of their CS and stretchers and walk away
[59:24] healed. You didn't even have to say a
[59:26] word.
[59:27] I remember one night in Vanelia,
[59:29] Illinois. I walked into a meeting.
[59:30] Hadn't been no more in the meeting over
[59:32] five minutes and there wasn't a feeble
[59:34] person around the place anywhere.
[59:36] Wheelchairs pushed out and piled up. The
[59:38] blind was seeing the deaf and dumb
[59:40] speaking and the spirit of God was
[59:43] present and he just healed the whole
[59:45] group of them. Now, that's when you can
[59:48] do
[59:49] something when revival is going on. But
[59:54] you let the revival fire die down. then
[59:56] you can hardly the people are still
[59:58] Christians but they're not revived into
[1:00:01] that spirit that great atmosphere that
[1:00:04] does something said it's just like a
[1:00:06] forge in a blacksmith's shop you you got
[1:00:09] to get the iron hot before you go to
[1:00:10] pounding on on the anvil if you don't
[1:00:13] you'll never get it straightened out and
[1:00:16] that's what it takes to have a revival
[1:00:18] is everybody under the heat of the Holy
[1:00:21] Spirit that's brought down the powers of
[1:00:23] God and revival
[1:00:26] moving. There's where prayer meetings
[1:00:28] are going day and night, every minute,
[1:00:30] everywhere. Why the people would even
[1:00:32] leave the ground. Well, you know, we we
[1:00:34] we reached a time we said, "Well, but
[1:00:37] brother Tim, revival is over." And
[1:00:39] people just don't feel it. And and and
[1:00:43] that's true, especially for the world.
[1:00:46] They'll never have
[1:00:47] another. Amen. But but don't forget,
[1:00:51] restoration is revival.
[1:00:53] How many believes in restoration? Well,
[1:00:56] if you believe in restoration, you got
[1:00:58] to believe in revival. They're one in
[1:00:59] the same thing. Amen. But but also it's
[1:01:03] a fact that the prophet for the last
[1:01:04] days that as he said must bring a
[1:01:08] message from God that have forerun the
[1:01:10] second coming of the Lord for by his
[1:01:12] message with the hearts of the children
[1:01:14] be turned back to the Pentecostal
[1:01:15] fathers and with the restoration of the
[1:01:19] word will
[1:01:21] come. the restoration of the
[1:01:24] power. Amen. Oh, step up then into a
[1:01:30] perfect word. Amen. Word that's only
[1:01:34] letter isn't a perfect word.
[1:01:38] It's got to be in spirit and in truth.
[1:01:42] Amen. Without the spirit with the with
[1:01:45] the letter, the letter just kills.
[1:01:49] But when the spirit of comes with the
[1:01:52] letter and the word and the spirit
[1:01:54] comes, it gives two wings to fly. Amen.
[1:01:57] You can fly in the heavens where all
[1:01:59] things are possible to them that
[1:02:01] believe.
[1:02:03] Amen. I just say this. If the coming of
[1:02:07] an angel bringing a gift to divine
[1:02:09] healing produced an atmosphere where the
[1:02:12] sick were healed
[1:02:14] spontaneously, how do you expect the
[1:02:16] dead in Christ will rise? Amen. You know
[1:02:19] what? Won't it be in power? Amen. If the
[1:02:22] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:02:25] dead dwell in you, that's the atmosphere
[1:02:27] of heaven, right? It'll quicken or make
[1:02:30] alive your mortal body. So you see, the
[1:02:34] only thing that'll make the dead in
[1:02:35] Christ rise is the quickening power of
[1:02:38] the Holy Ghost. Amen. The only thing
[1:02:41] that'll make a dead church rise or dead
[1:02:45] Christian rise. Amen. There's too many
[1:02:48] dead Christians in the church and they
[1:02:51] ain't breathed in a long time. We need
[1:02:53] to be calling 911 on heaven. Amen.
[1:02:56] Because we need the rescue squad to come
[1:02:58] out with the angels of God to come down
[1:03:00] in attendance because too many are dead
[1:03:03] to breathe their last breath. It's time
[1:03:05] for the breath of the Holy Ghost to
[1:03:07] breathe in the lives of men and women
[1:03:09] until they're filled with the uncction
[1:03:12] of the power of God.
[1:03:15] You know, brother Bradam envisioned the
[1:03:17] rapture this way. You can hear it in the
[1:03:20] message, the countdown. You know, how
[1:03:22] many times did he preach that? He showed
[1:03:24] that we were not to be
[1:03:29] earthbound, but we to be spiritual
[1:03:32] atmospheres exploring the
[1:03:35] heavenlies. Amen. You know, he preached
[1:03:38] that we have moved beyond earthbound
[1:03:41] existence into the skies. He said even
[1:03:44] Isuza Street took off in a in an
[1:03:46] airplane flying higher than the age
[1:03:49] other ages. But now is the time we are
[1:03:52] to be spiritual
[1:03:54] astronauts going to the realms that are
[1:03:57] previously unknown to other ages. I hear
[1:04:02] him in his prayer as he prayed in
[1:04:03] Countdown. Father, so many things could
[1:04:07] be said right here. Maybe the church
[1:04:08] wouldn't understand, but I pray you'll
[1:04:11] give them such a crave for it, Lord,
[1:04:13] that they'll come and see we are in the
[1:04:15] end time, the astronaut age. I pray,
[1:04:18] Father, they'll realize it isn't trying
[1:04:20] to condemn what they had. It's only
[1:04:22] trying to give them more rapturing
[1:04:24] grace. That's what we're doing today.
[1:04:27] We're not trying to condemn what you
[1:04:29] got. We're trying to lift you a little
[1:04:31] higher. Amen. even around as other maybe
[1:04:35] are listening. I'm not trying to con
[1:04:37] condemn your church or condemn another
[1:04:40] message group. No, I want to see you
[1:04:42] lifted a little higher. Amen. I want to
[1:04:45] see you reach for the realms of the
[1:04:47] heavenly. He said it's only trying to
[1:04:50] give them more rapturing grace for the
[1:04:54] hour will come when we will have to have
[1:04:58] rapture power not only to heal the body
[1:05:01] but to change it in a moment in a
[1:05:03] twinkling of an eye. Christ will be so
[1:05:06] real in their bodies till he can change
[1:05:09] it. Amen. By his great death what he
[1:05:13] purchased. May they take this today that
[1:05:16] token that I spoke of hold it before
[1:05:19] them and walk into this
[1:05:22] atmosphere where visions, powers and
[1:05:25] worlds beyond known and and and God oh
[1:05:29] God where the great mysteries of God is
[1:05:32] unfolded in those seven seals and made
[1:05:35] known to man. Oh, brother Tim, we're in
[1:05:38] the seven seals. Well, I'll tell you
[1:05:39] what. You know, we got the mystery.
[1:05:41] Yeah. But it's where visions and powers
[1:05:45] and worlds
[1:05:47] beyond where the seven seals are
[1:05:51] opened. These mysteries did of truths
[1:05:54] did not come by the intellectual
[1:05:58] abilities of man. Wasn't an intellectual
[1:06:02] and man anointing. It was under an eagle
[1:06:04] anointing to go back into the very mind
[1:06:08] of God and bring forward the things that
[1:06:10] were written in the word of
[1:06:12] God. We look around even as we think of
[1:06:16] the countdown. We look and see what
[1:06:19] fallen man, fallen sons of God, man in
[1:06:23] his fallen state, what they've
[1:06:25] accomplished. We're living in a super
[1:06:29] world. Amen. And if you would if you
[1:06:31] could transport somebody here from 150
[1:06:34] years ago, uh, you know, they they would
[1:06:37] their mind would be
[1:06:40] blown. Amen. I mean, they they only knew
[1:06:44] horse buggy and walking and and and
[1:06:46] horseback riding. They they knew
[1:06:48] nothing. Amen. They knew nothing of
[1:06:51] automobiles. They knew nothing of of of
[1:06:53] of, you know, of the progress that we
[1:06:55] have made today. They wouldn't we we
[1:06:58] would be superhuman to them.
[1:07:01] Supernatural. Not just natural people,
[1:07:04] but
[1:07:05] supernatural to them. And I'm only
[1:07:08] talking about the natural realm. We're a
[1:07:11] people that's a supernatural class
[1:07:14] beyond the the normal, the natural.
[1:07:18] value. We're listen man was that way for
[1:07:21] how many
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:25] millenniums falling behind a
[1:07:28] oxtart, you know, going walking here,
[1:07:32] getting on an old sailing ship and
[1:07:34] letting the wind blow them somewhere
[1:07:36] when they hoped they would wind up where
[1:07:37] they wanted to
[1:07:39] go. You know how how different we are
[1:07:43] today. Amen. Now, brother Bradom told us
[1:07:46] the natural types of spiritual. So, look
[1:07:49] what man has accomplished. He's
[1:07:51] accomplished. He's created automobiles.
[1:07:53] He discovered radio. He harnessed
[1:07:55] electricity. He split the atoms. He
[1:07:57] launched jet planes into the skies. And
[1:08:00] we just look how
[1:08:02] rapidly the science has advanced. And
[1:08:06] even even lately, we've had we've had
[1:08:08] people just normal people going into
[1:08:11] outer space, not astronauts, so to
[1:08:14] speak, but normal people being caught up
[1:08:17] into realms that others had never
[1:08:20] experienced before. But the church is
[1:08:23] too often stuck. You know, it's clanging
[1:08:26] clinging just to outdated creeds and
[1:08:30] traditions of man and afraid to step
[1:08:33] into the full revelation of God's word.
[1:08:37] When God is calling us to go deeper, to
[1:08:40] unfold his word, not not just the
[1:08:42] letter, but the word in power. Amen. Not
[1:08:46] not to stay stuck in yesterday's shadows
[1:08:49] or in the glare of the light of another
[1:08:52] day.
[1:08:53] Oh, there's too many in the message
[1:08:55] today that are walking in a
[1:08:57] glare in the past, in the memory of the
[1:09:01] years gone by of where one day that God
[1:09:04] once moved and too many are walking. And
[1:09:08] don't get offended. And please, you
[1:09:10] know, if you're listening this, don't
[1:09:12] clip this part of the sermon without
[1:09:14] getting the rest of
[1:09:15] it. You know, you know, you know, you're
[1:09:19] a gossiper when you do that. You know,
[1:09:22] you're you I I I tell you that the
[1:09:25] Bible's got some things to say about you
[1:09:27] that aren't too
[1:09:29] good. You're s of discord. You're one of
[1:09:33] those that God hates. Amen. But too many
[1:09:36] are walking in yesterday's light of God
[1:09:39] sent a
[1:09:40] prophet. And and it's true. God did send
[1:09:43] a prophet. But but I I want to say that
[1:09:47] was yesterday's light.
[1:09:52] Oh yeah. We still love that truth. We
[1:09:55] still rejoice in that truth. And it was
[1:09:58] brought to us. It brought us to where we
[1:10:00] are today. Amen. That you know, we
[1:10:03] couldn't have got here today without
[1:10:05] that. Amen. That was the shout.
[1:10:09] Amen. That was the shout. That was a
[1:10:12] message coming forth in this day. Amen.
[1:10:15] But friends, we have moved beyond that.
[1:10:18] I I don't mean we have forgotten that. I
[1:10:22] don't mean we have neglected that. I'm
[1:10:24] talking about we have advanced.
[1:10:27] Amen. To where that now the voice is in
[1:10:31] the bride.
[1:10:36] Hallelujah. Yes. It was in the prophet.
[1:10:39] It was in the ministry. It gave us 1100
[1:10:42] sermons. It it established a message. It
[1:10:45] brought the doctrines.
[1:10:47] But now you've got to give voice to it.
[1:10:54] Amen. You know, I tell you what, you
[1:10:57] could just read the
[1:10:59] accounts. You could read the accounts
[1:11:02] where he he would say in the message
[1:11:04] influence, he said, just your presence
[1:11:07] to walk in with the people. While the
[1:11:10] people get up out of cs and stretchers
[1:11:12] and walk around, you just lay your hands
[1:11:15] on them. Give me a glass. somebody um
[1:11:18] lay your hands on them and my that just
[1:11:21] sent them a whirl. And I've seen lines
[1:11:23] where there's been four or 500 people
[1:11:26] come through the lines deaf, dumb,
[1:11:29] blind, crosseyed. Not one of them
[1:11:31] failed, but what was healed? Every one
[1:11:33] of
[1:11:34] them. He said, "Try it
[1:11:36] today. See, there's no
[1:11:39] fire." In Rome, when the fires went out
[1:11:42] in the temple at Vista, the people went
[1:11:44] home. Now there is no revival fire to
[1:11:48] back it up. See that's just it. And
[1:11:51] after a while I'm quoting you. And after
[1:11:54] a while if the world's still standing
[1:11:57] are we is the world still standing? Is
[1:12:00] it now after a while? Amen. They start
[1:12:04] living in the glare again.
[1:12:09] So you see I I'm not just saying
[1:12:11] that God's prophet said after a
[1:12:15] while they start living in the glare
[1:12:21] again. I didn't say that the prophet
[1:12:24] did. And since it's true it's happening
[1:12:29] everywhere. Amen. It's the spirit of the
[1:12:32] age.
[1:12:33] You see,
[1:12:35] Leoa are going right
[1:12:37] on and they've never missed Christ. They
[1:12:41] don't recognize he ain't
[1:12:45] there. I I read your Bible, Revelation
[1:12:48] chapter 3, the last age. Christ is on
[1:12:51] the
[1:12:53] outside and they hadn't missed
[1:12:56] him. Amen. They never missed him.
[1:12:59] They're living in a glare. They still
[1:13:00] quote the quotes. They're still saying
[1:13:02] sing about him, but he's missing from
[1:13:05] the
[1:13:06] church. There's hardly even a fragrance
[1:13:09] of him left. It's a mirage of the past
[1:13:13] where God used to do those things but
[1:13:16] not
[1:13:17] now. You know, you you see we reason
[1:13:22] that was only for that phase of the
[1:13:25] divine healing movement. I just wanted
[1:13:28] to just bring it back to you again. This
[1:13:32] message began with the
[1:13:37] supernatural and it will end with a
[1:13:40] supernatural resurrection and a rapture,
[1:13:44] brother. It won't be an intellectual
[1:13:46] knowledge. It'll be quickening power
[1:13:50] at work.
[1:13:52] Now sometimes people will say all the
[1:13:54] signs and wonders are only for the
[1:13:55] vindication of the of the message and
[1:13:58] once the message the word has come we
[1:14:00] don't need vindication anymore. So the
[1:14:02] days of miracles has ceased. So then
[1:14:05] Christ is no longer the
[1:14:07] same. You're no longer believing that he
[1:14:10] is and he's a rewarder of those that
[1:14:13] diligently seek him. So you see they
[1:14:17] become like Eve believing that God won't
[1:14:19] keep his word. And when we do that, we
[1:14:22] give we give ear to the voice of the
[1:14:27] serpent. But you see as I I want to
[1:14:30] share this away with you as brother
[1:14:33] Brandham in brother Brandham's words he
[1:14:35] says today they have nerve to say where
[1:14:39] wonder what happened to the God of the
[1:14:41] Bible. Where is that God? And he answers
[1:14:45] why you choked him out by your creeds.
[1:14:48] You choked him out by your traditions.
[1:14:51] You tried to place him back in history.
[1:14:54] He's a God of
[1:14:56] history. And what he's waiting on today,
[1:14:59] that same God of history where that when
[1:15:02] Moses called on him at the Red Sea, the
[1:15:04] God of history rose up and made a way.
[1:15:06] And when Joshua called on the God of
[1:15:08] history at Jordan, he rose up and made a
[1:15:11] way. And when Daniel called on him and
[1:15:13] the lion's den and the Hebrew and the
[1:15:15] Hebrew children, the fiery furnace, he
[1:15:17] made a way. He's still the same God of
[1:15:21] history. And he's waiting for his people
[1:15:25] to call him up out of
[1:15:28] history. That same God remains God. He's
[1:15:31] God forever. But our
[1:15:35] traditions, we've taught it away from
[1:15:38] the people.
[1:15:41] And this is what has happened. But he
[1:15:44] said what we must do is to bring that
[1:15:47] living faith back to the people. Bring
[1:15:51] God
[1:15:53] back. How many wants God in our
[1:15:56] midst? Amen. That we welcome and receive
[1:16:00] the word, the living word, and the
[1:16:03] spirit and the power of the word.
[1:16:06] But he said in testimony on the sea, he
[1:16:09] said in this date, in this kind of
[1:16:11] atmosphere like that, he said, "We're
[1:16:14] getting to find out miracles aren't
[1:16:16] taking
[1:16:17] place in no more like they were. The
[1:16:21] sick will go home sick." And it isn't
[1:16:24] because of God. It's because of the lack
[1:16:27] of the revival among the people. There's
[1:16:30] no revival. Well, they just sit and
[1:16:32] listen and they go home and say, "Well,
[1:16:34] that was pretty
[1:16:35] good. Are you listening
[1:16:38] even?" Amen. He said, he said, "If
[1:16:41] because of lack of revival among the
[1:16:44] people, there's no revival." They just
[1:16:46] sit and listen and go home and say,
[1:16:49] "Well, that was pretty good." Uh, but
[1:16:53] there's not that zeal. There's not that
[1:16:55] something in the people that should be.
[1:16:59] Well, no wonder he called out to Leoa,
[1:17:02] be zealous.
[1:17:05] No other age does he have to admonish
[1:17:07] like that. But he says to this age, be
[1:17:10] zealous and willing to repent.
[1:17:15] Amen. You see, something must change.
[1:17:18] And I'm going to just say this because
[1:17:21] and and and why I preach the way I do
[1:17:23] and why that I'm bringing out some of
[1:17:26] the things. Maybe sometimes I will
[1:17:28] reiterate them and reinforce them with
[1:17:31] other scriptures or other quotes or
[1:17:33] another sermon or another another
[1:17:36] viewpoint is
[1:17:38] because I want to raise your
[1:17:42] expectations. I want to raise your
[1:17:44] expectation beyond a denominational
[1:17:48] bitchwarmer, beyond that of a
[1:17:52] spectator or even beyond that of an
[1:17:54] imitator.
[1:17:57] or an
[1:17:58] impersonator. I want to raise your
[1:18:01] expectations where that you as an eagle
[1:18:03] no longer are earthbound, but you leave
[1:18:06] the old dirty nest and out of your
[1:18:09] comfort zone and get into a place where
[1:18:11] that you see all things are possible. To
[1:18:14] them that
[1:18:15] believe and we begin to come together
[1:18:18] with an
[1:18:20] expectancy, God's going to move. God's
[1:18:23] going to save. God's going to deliver.
[1:18:26] God's going to heal. Devils are going to
[1:18:29] be cast out. Amen. The sick will will
[1:18:32] not go home sick, but there's going to
[1:18:34] be healing in the house. Deliverance in
[1:18:37] the house of God. Come on. It's promise.
[1:18:39] These signs shall follow them that
[1:18:42] believe. Are we believers anymore? If we
[1:18:45] are believers, then in my name they
[1:18:47] shall cast out devils. In my name, they
[1:18:50] will speak with new tongues. Hallelujah.
[1:18:59] They'll even take serpents up. I'm not
[1:19:02] even talking about literal ones, but
[1:19:04] spiritual ones, and cast them
[1:19:08] out. But listen, brother
[1:19:11] Brandon, this is a parting
[1:19:14] words. Parting words. Isn't it amazing?
[1:19:19] those last few sermons that he
[1:19:22] speaks and he speaks of you know I I you
[1:19:26] know modern events made clear by
[1:19:29] prophecy and you know walking with them
[1:19:32] on the way to Emmas and then he speaks
[1:19:34] of
[1:19:35] leadership one saved and one lost is
[1:19:38] like happened with Jesus on the cross
[1:19:40] you know one saved one lost like with
[1:19:43] Moses you know and and Pharaoh two two
[1:19:46] sons of Egypt there one saved one lost
[1:19:49] and won't let that he comes down and he
[1:19:53] preaches the rapture and then things
[1:19:55] that are to
[1:19:58] be and he ends his entire ministry
[1:20:02] closes it because it was a ministry of
[1:20:05] Christ being portrayed in this day
[1:20:08] closes it with
[1:20:12] communion and then the last words
[1:20:15] imparted to
[1:20:17] us as a messenger to
[1:20:20] Leodysia would would say impart the last
[1:20:27] words to the last
[1:20:30] age. He says you know the hour will soon
[1:20:33] arise when right among us the Holy
[1:20:36] Spirit will speak out like it did in
[1:20:39] Ananas of fire. Remember that hour is
[1:20:43] arriving now. You just remember that God
[1:20:47] is going to dwell among his people.
[1:20:50] That's what he wants to do. Now, well, I
[1:20:53] tell you if that is the words I I
[1:20:55] wonder, would we let him?
[1:20:58] Would we let him? Amen. I asked the
[1:21:00] bride around the world, minister,
[1:21:03] friends, all of you around the world,
[1:21:05] will we let him?
[1:21:07] Amen. Every little display of the
[1:21:10] supernatural gets attacked.
[1:21:13] Preachers are skittish and paranoid of
[1:21:15] it. They shy away from anything of the
[1:21:18] Holy
[1:21:22] Spirit. They want to dismiss the Holy
[1:21:25] Ghost as
[1:21:26] emotionalism. They want to deny the
[1:21:28] gifts of the Holy Ghost. They want to
[1:21:32] discredit it every way. And they go on a
[1:21:34] witch hunt to try to find any little
[1:21:37] flaw, any little excuse why not to
[1:21:40] believe.
[1:21:41] when God's wanting to dwell among his
[1:21:44] people. But we are living in the final
[1:21:46] days. How many believes that? And this
[1:21:49] is the hour where God's glorious church
[1:21:52] has got to stand tall, radiant, and
[1:21:55] bold. Amen. And mirroring the very
[1:21:58] mighty angels coming down in Revelation
[1:22:01] 10 whose face was as a sun. And we've
[1:22:04] got to reflect that same glory shining
[1:22:07] as the sun. But instead, we hear people
[1:22:10] say, "Ah, I'm in the message." We don't
[1:22:14] believe that Pentecostal trash. We don't
[1:22:17] want those tongues speaking Acts 2:38,
[1:22:19] youngans. And preachers will actually
[1:22:22] practice spiritual birth control to make
[1:22:25] sure it doesn't happen. And they will
[1:22:27] literally tie the tubes of the church to
[1:22:30] keep her from bringing forth those kind
[1:22:32] of Acts 2:38 tongue-speaking children.
[1:22:36] Come on now. That's a tragedy. Amen.
[1:22:39] What a what a distraction from our true
[1:22:42] identity. You see, it's not supposed to
[1:22:44] be that
[1:22:45] way. God isn't to be confined to a
[1:22:49] message label
[1:22:51] or a sublabel of of the message, a
[1:22:54] peruse or a third pull or whatever. He
[1:22:56] He's pouring out in wave after wave
[1:23:00] after wave. And it's not supposed to be
[1:23:03] one small touch, one isolated baptism,
[1:23:07] one single revelation. No, it's baptism
[1:23:10] after baptism. It's revelation after
[1:23:13] revelation. It's power upon power. It's
[1:23:16] glory upon
[1:23:18] glory. Oh, we should be so far up the
[1:23:21] road now. The church prepared and
[1:23:23] watching and waiting, expecting that
[1:23:27] great translation.
[1:23:33] We ever once should be screaming with
[1:23:35] one accord. How many believes we should
[1:23:38] be in one accord and all with one voice
[1:23:41] saying, "Let the fire fall."
[1:23:45] Amen. Let the Holy Ghost come down. Let
[1:23:48] heaven rain among us.
[1:23:54] It's not supposed to be
[1:23:56] confined to the seven seals.
[1:24:00] seals. The seven seals opened the book
[1:24:02] and all its inheritance. It placed and
[1:24:05] the power of every mystery and every
[1:24:07] Bible prophecy at our
[1:24:11] fingertips, but instead we linger back
[1:24:14] in the past. We're rehearsing old forms
[1:24:17] and saying, "Let's go back." And I just
[1:24:20] say,
[1:24:24] "No, come on.
[1:24:27] What if I said to you, "Let's just all
[1:24:28] be
[1:24:29] Amish." Menites, get you a horse and
[1:24:32] buggy. Turn off your electricity.
[1:24:37] Somebody needs to say
[1:24:39] no. That's
[1:24:41] insanity. Amen. You know, most of us get
[1:24:45] in a panic if we just think we're going
[1:24:47] to go off the
[1:24:48] grid. We ain't going to have
[1:24:50] electricity. Oh my. What would I do
[1:24:52] without it?
[1:24:55] How would I grow food? What would I do?
[1:24:57] How would I do this? How, you know, and
[1:24:59] then all of a sudden you get in this
[1:25:00] survival
[1:25:03] mentality? I don't want to go
[1:25:06] backwards. I don't want to take this
[1:25:08] church backwards. I want to go forward.
[1:25:12] Oh, no. I don't want to take us back to
[1:25:14] Zuza Street. Don't misunderstand me. I I
[1:25:18] ain't satisfied just flying a little bit
[1:25:20] off the ground. I want to go in the
[1:25:21] heavens. I want rapturing power this
[1:25:24] hour. I want to move in the rounds that
[1:25:27] has been prophesied of a people in this
[1:25:30] last
[1:25:34] day. I want you to listen carefully as I
[1:25:38] just kind
[1:25:39] of take the words of the prophet of
[1:25:43] God. If I put them in my own words,
[1:25:46] pardon me here, but you ministers that
[1:25:48] was in the ministers meeting, I shared
[1:25:50] this with you.
[1:25:52] But we're coming into a
[1:25:55] time, just like Paul said, where there
[1:25:57] are prophecies, they will fail. And
[1:26:01] where there are tongues, they will
[1:26:03] cease because there's something that's
[1:26:06] even greater than that that will
[1:26:08] remain. And that is love. It's the
[1:26:12] essence of God's nature, divine love,
[1:26:17] the atmosphere of of what was so
[1:26:20] tangibly felt and noticed beyond the
[1:26:24] curtain of time when the prophet of God
[1:26:27] was so blessed to go there and bring us
[1:26:29] back the report of it. And the time is
[1:26:33] coming and it's almost here when the
[1:26:36] saints will gather and an atmosphere of
[1:26:39] holy love of the Holy Ghost will just
[1:26:41] flood the room and no one will have to
[1:26:44] touch anyone. Not even a prayer line or
[1:26:47] laying on of hands. There won't there
[1:26:50] won't be none of that needed for the
[1:26:52] body change.
[1:26:54] The presence of the Holy Ghost will be
[1:26:57] so thick, so yet so tender, yet so
[1:27:01] powerful that everything wrong will be
[1:27:04] made right and sickness will be healed
[1:27:07] and insane minds restored and hearts
[1:27:12] will be made whole just by the presence
[1:27:15] of God alone.
[1:27:19] Hallelujah. Yeah. But right now, we lay
[1:27:22] hands on the sick. We anoint with oil
[1:27:25] and we pray. That's how we minister
[1:27:29] under this present
[1:27:31] anointing. But there's a day
[1:27:33] coming. How many believes it? There's a
[1:27:37] day coming when Christ God's church will
[1:27:39] be so refined, so filled with the Holy
[1:27:42] Ghost that the Holy Ghost will be just
[1:27:45] simply moved from the through the people
[1:27:47] just like he did on the day of
[1:27:49] Pentecost. Miracles will break out
[1:27:51] without anyone laying hands on them. And
[1:27:54] healing will pour forth and the lame
[1:27:56] will walk and the blind will see and
[1:27:58] miss and limbs will be restored. And the
[1:28:00] atmosphere will be
[1:28:02] charged with the glory of God.
[1:28:07] Oh, I know. We've had a day of
[1:28:08] fanaticism and
[1:28:11] impersonations, and these impersonators
[1:28:13] took gifts and turned them into a
[1:28:16] spectacle.
[1:28:18] They took them and made them into a
[1:28:19] fundraising tool and a
[1:28:22] performance that left a bad taste in
[1:28:25] everybody's mouth because that's never
[1:28:27] what the gifts of God are for. The gifts
[1:28:30] were given to bring the gospel and faith
[1:28:33] to the people. It was not to build names
[1:28:36] or not to build empires or make
[1:28:38] kingdoms.
[1:28:41] We know that even a man could have, you
[1:28:44] know, standing behind the pull pit could
[1:28:46] work great miracles and signs and
[1:28:48] wonders, even preach under the anointing
[1:28:51] and not be saved. Even devils, you know,
[1:28:55] will will will perform under that under
[1:28:59] that to to to do wonders. The Bible
[1:29:02] calls them lion signs and wonders
[1:29:05] because even if they're true wonders and
[1:29:07] signs because they're false, it makes
[1:29:09] them lion
[1:29:11] signs. And so he said, "Many will come
[1:29:13] to me in that day and say, Lord, Lord,
[1:29:15] have we not cast out devils in your name
[1:29:17] and done many mighty works?" And I'll
[1:29:19] say, "Depart from me. I never knew you."
[1:29:21] Why? Because it's not about the works.
[1:29:24] It's about the heart. It's about being
[1:29:26] known of him.
[1:29:29] Amen. It's important. God can
[1:29:31] say, "I know
[1:29:35] you." Come on. Oh, he knows everybody.
[1:29:38] Not in this
[1:29:39] way. This is a personal personal
[1:29:45] relationship. Amen. To be known of God.
[1:29:48] Oh, yeah. So, yeah, I understand gifts
[1:29:52] are wonderful. They're necessary and
[1:29:53] they're given to every man to profit the
[1:29:55] body. But the time is coming. Listen to
[1:29:59] me closely. When even those gifts will
[1:30:02] fade in comparison to something
[1:30:05] greater, when that which is perfect,
[1:30:08] love comes in its fullness. It ain't
[1:30:11] here
[1:30:14] yet. Amen. the gifts, you know, but
[1:30:18] however, when that perfect love comes in
[1:30:22] his fullness, the gifts, as brother
[1:30:25] Baptist used, brother Bradom's word,
[1:30:27] will simply be laid on the mantle, as it
[1:30:29] were.
[1:30:32] And the church then will not be ruled by
[1:30:35] charisma or by performance but by the
[1:30:39] pure holy presence of God's love as our
[1:30:43] bodies are transformed by its power in a
[1:30:47] moment in a twinkling of an eye. We're
[1:30:50] talking about a baptism. I I'm talking
[1:30:52] about the atmosphere of
[1:30:55] there of divine love of perfection comes
[1:31:02] down until it so permeates not just the
[1:31:06] soul of man but even changes our
[1:31:11] bodies. But right now we're still in the
[1:31:14] day of
[1:31:16] preaching. This is the hour to reach the
[1:31:20] lost. It's the hour to preach the gospel
[1:31:23] with
[1:31:24] fire. Amen. It is the time to call
[1:31:28] sinners to
[1:31:29] repentance, to bring them to the life of
[1:31:32] Christ. And that's what signs and
[1:31:34] wonders confirm that they follow the
[1:31:36] preaching of the
[1:31:37] word. I I hope you you get that signs
[1:31:42] follow the preaching of the word.
[1:31:45] Amen. and the Lord went with them
[1:31:48] performing signs and
[1:31:51] wonders. So you see, if we're really
[1:31:53] preaching the
[1:31:55] word, we don't have to seek signs and
[1:31:59] seek wonders. They just follow.
[1:32:04] But if the word's really not being
[1:32:05] preached and it's just a dead letter,
[1:32:08] it'll be dead works
[1:32:10] and it'll be a faithless bunch of
[1:32:12] people.
[1:32:15] But right now, we're in the day of
[1:32:16] preaching. This is the hour to reach the
[1:32:18] lost, to preach the gospel, to call
[1:32:21] sinners, to bring them to life of
[1:32:25] Christ. This is a time where we lay
[1:32:28] hands on the
[1:32:31] sick. How many believes in that?
[1:32:35] Amen. Where we have prayer
[1:32:37] lines. That's what we have right now.
[1:32:41] But we're pressing towards something
[1:32:43] that's even greater than that.
[1:32:46] Where there won't be another prayer
[1:32:48] line. Come on, somebody. Where there
[1:32:51] won't be hands laid on the sick. Amen.
[1:32:53] This right now is a time where we need
[1:32:57] gifts of
[1:32:59] healing. The other day in a prayer line
[1:33:02] there at camp, Sister Jennifer Mason
[1:33:05] came in the prayer line suffering with
[1:33:08] with with I think it's rheumatoid
[1:33:10] arthritis. I'm not sure what her
[1:33:11] diagnosis is, but she's been taking
[1:33:13] different medications for that that you
[1:33:15] know that'll ruin your body
[1:33:17] actually because they have side
[1:33:20] effects hurting so bad that she couldn't
[1:33:24] do nothing but sit down, you know, and
[1:33:26] get back up again and try a little more.
[1:33:28] You know what it is to suffer like that,
[1:33:30] right? coming in the prayer line the
[1:33:33] other day. Amen. As she stood there, I
[1:33:36] knew about her situation, but I just
[1:33:37] rebuked the thing. Amen. And you know
[1:33:40] what? The devil left her.
[1:33:45] [Applause]
[1:33:48] She said, "I was expecting a healing,
[1:33:51] but what I got was a miracle."
[1:33:54] Amen. I walked from that prayer line, no
[1:33:57] pain. I've been without pain. Amen. Why?
[1:34:00] Because today is still the day of prayer
[1:34:03] lines, gifts of healing, workings of
[1:34:09] miracles. Right now, in this time, we
[1:34:11] need gifts of healing. We need words of
[1:34:14] prophecy. We need a word of knowledge
[1:34:17] and the gift of wisdom to go with it.
[1:34:20] But we're nearing the finishing
[1:34:22] line. Amen. The church is nearly
[1:34:25] anchored, is nearly ready. And when she
[1:34:29] will when she's finally in position, oh
[1:34:32] hallelujah, the Holy Spirit himself will
[1:34:35] take full control and the sick will be
[1:34:39] healed and the blind will see and the
[1:34:41] lame will walk. Not because we touched
[1:34:43] them, but because he touched the whole
[1:34:48] body.
[1:34:50] And we will stand together not in
[1:34:52] division, but in one great glorious
[1:34:55] unity, soaked in the love of God. as
[1:34:58] that heavenly atmosphere sweeps down and
[1:35:02] changes our bodies.
[1:35:07] And then, my friend, we will not need
[1:35:11] gifts to
[1:35:12] discern. We will know as we are
[1:35:15] known. And then when we are changed, we
[1:35:19] will know all things because we will be
[1:35:22] fully the word when the theophony
[1:35:25] glorifies the body.
[1:35:27] And in that form, we know all things. So
[1:35:30] no need for
[1:35:31] prophecy because we already know. And we
[1:35:34] won't even notice anybody speaking in
[1:35:38] tongues because everybody will be
[1:35:41] talking heaven's language.
[1:35:44] Amen. And we won't need a gift of
[1:35:47] interpretation because there won't be
[1:35:48] nobody that don't understand.
[1:35:52] And then we won't need gifts of healing
[1:35:54] because everybody will be healed from
[1:35:57] head to toe to be sick no more. No more
[1:36:01] divine healing.
[1:36:03] No more divine healing. But then divine
[1:36:07] health,
[1:36:09] never to get sick again.
[1:36:14] And won't be no old people there either.
[1:36:17] Only young people will be there. for old
[1:36:20] age will fade away as we had the most
[1:36:23] glorious grand and youth camp ever.
[1:36:27] H is ready. Hallelujah. I'm ready for
[1:36:31] that theophony to step out, unite
[1:36:34] together and glorify this small body and
[1:36:38] it come into a glorious youth camp
[1:36:42] that we never dismiss from.
[1:36:52] and a youth that never
[1:36:56] fades the message
[1:36:59] expectation. Brother Brandon said all
[1:37:01] one accord, one place. They were
[1:37:04] blessing God for the Holy Ghost which
[1:37:06] had never come
[1:37:07] yet. And they believed that it was
[1:37:10] because God was going to keep his
[1:37:12] promise. Well, what about the rapture
[1:37:14] promise?
[1:37:17] Amen. Well, can't we believe that
[1:37:19] promise? Amen. And when they kept
[1:37:22] blessing God until that atmosphere got
[1:37:26] just right, then there came a sound from
[1:37:29] heaven like a rushing mighty wind and it
[1:37:32] filled all the house where they were
[1:37:34] sitting. See, the atmosphere got right.
[1:37:39] He said, "Well, couldn't we get an
[1:37:40] atmosphere here that every crippled,
[1:37:42] every blind person, every sick person,
[1:37:44] everything all with one accord believeth
[1:37:46] until the sick?" Well, I seen it in Wood
[1:37:48] River where there wasn't one person
[1:37:50] left. They just piled up the crutches,
[1:37:52] the wheelchairs, the CS, and I was
[1:37:53] standing on the platform preaching like
[1:37:55] this and they began to raise up and
[1:37:56] throw them to the corners. He said, "The
[1:37:58] atmosphere got
[1:38:00] right." Hallelujah. Listen, we got a
[1:38:03] promise in the word for those that are
[1:38:06] alive and remain. The atmosphere is
[1:38:09] going to get right. Hallelujah. Heaven's
[1:38:12] atmosphere will blend with the earth
[1:38:15] atmosphere. And we will step into that
[1:38:17] as they step out of that and they unite
[1:38:20] with their bodies and we are changed in
[1:38:22] a moment in a twinkling of an eye.
[1:38:27] The atmosphere gets right. But sadly,
[1:38:30] there's too many, even preachers, who
[1:38:34] has never lived in that
[1:38:37] atmosphere. You're going to have to have
[1:38:39] the atmosphere within your soul before
[1:38:42] you'll ever experience the rapture
[1:38:45] atmosphere. That's what the Holy Ghost
[1:38:48] is. It's when that atmosphere there
[1:38:51] comes down into here, which sets you in
[1:38:54] heavenly places or your position of
[1:38:57] sunship. Now, Too many have never lived
[1:39:00] there. I mean, it's kind of like non. He
[1:39:02] was a great fellow, but he was a he was
[1:39:04] a leper. And that's the way it is with a
[1:39:07] lot of people today. They're they're
[1:39:08] good people. Even stand in the pulpit.
[1:39:11] Great men, but you know, they they
[1:39:15] listen to man's theology instead of of
[1:39:18] of the Holy Ghost. And they they're
[1:39:22] still a leper.
[1:39:24] Yeah. they're still a leper because they
[1:39:26] have a form of
[1:39:28] godliness and yet deny the power
[1:39:30] thereof. Yet they can be influential
[1:39:32] speakers and and forceful and actually
[1:39:36] I'm telling you I'll tell them myself
[1:39:38] right now. I'm not making any secret.
[1:39:40] I'm
[1:39:41] quoting and he and he says and and the c
[1:39:45] and they he said the influential
[1:39:47] speakers forceful but still never knows
[1:39:51] what it is to be born again or to
[1:39:55] believe in the supernatural and cannot
[1:39:57] understand it because he cannot come in
[1:40:00] the kingdom of God. And they will
[1:40:02] explain it away through reasons every
[1:40:04] time why he's never lived in this
[1:40:09] atmosphere. But a man ever comes in
[1:40:13] there, he has to become a son or
[1:40:15] daughter of God. Then his nature is like
[1:40:17] God. He believes the supernatural.
[1:40:22] You might be a great man, even a great
[1:40:24] message believer and approach the
[1:40:26] prophet and you know and want and and
[1:40:29] want a a miracle in your life or want
[1:40:31] something or or maybe want recognition
[1:40:34] or whatever. But let me tell you, you're
[1:40:36] still a
[1:40:37] leper, still steeped in
[1:40:40] unbelief, you got to come into the
[1:40:43] atmosphere because you know non had
[1:40:46] never lived in that atmosphere.
[1:40:48] But when he come into atmosphere of
[1:40:51] obedience and he obeyed what the prophet
[1:40:53] of God said and went and dipped those
[1:40:56] seven
[1:40:58] times, you know, we got about seven
[1:41:00] church ages worth of unbelief to wash
[1:41:02] off of us.
[1:41:04] Amen. What Alexander Campbell said of
[1:41:07] the days of miracles is pass and mo
[1:41:09] Baptist theology or formalities or or
[1:41:12] loosen or this or that. Leave it all
[1:41:14] behind. Wash it away. Amen. until all
[1:41:18] the leprosy is gone and you're clean.
[1:41:25] Yet even now we try to educate people
[1:41:27] into the message until they have a
[1:41:30] degree in understanding deep mysteries
[1:41:33] yet lacking the life of
[1:41:36] Christ. Yet they claim to be having a
[1:41:38] word revival.
[1:41:40] I truly wish it was a word
[1:41:42] revival because it's truly instead an
[1:41:46] intellectual
[1:41:48] revival. And the message, broken
[1:41:51] sisters, brother Brandham tells us,
[1:41:53] education can never bring life. And let
[1:41:55] me just say this, we're not even talking
[1:41:58] about biology and science and all that
[1:42:00] stuff. We're talking about educating
[1:42:02] ourselves into the
[1:42:04] message. It's not to be an
[1:42:06] education or an acquired knowledge. is
[1:42:10] to be a revelation that comes only
[1:42:13] supernaturally. Without the Holy Ghost,
[1:42:15] you cannot understand the kingdom of
[1:42:18] God. You might be able to read it and
[1:42:22] verbally express it and maybe do a
[1:42:24] better job than I can and yet not have
[1:42:28] revelation, but you see, education can
[1:42:30] never bring life. It takes the spirit of
[1:42:32] God to to bring life. And that life must
[1:42:35] not come out of just an intellectual
[1:42:37] revival.
[1:42:39] It's got to come out of the Bible. Word
[1:42:42] revival. And that word is the same
[1:42:45] yesterday, today, and forever. And when
[1:42:48] it falls today and quickened, you get
[1:42:51] the same results that they did in Acts
[1:42:53] chapter 2. Exactly. It always has. It
[1:42:56] always will be because the spirit of God
[1:42:59] that it's the spirit of God that
[1:43:01] conditions the atmosphere. It takes
[1:43:04] atmospheres to do
[1:43:06] things. And he said, "That's the reason
[1:43:09] you men are taught. Bring your children
[1:43:11] here." And he says, "Certainly, that's
[1:43:13] right." Now, he's referring to the youth
[1:43:15] meetings that were going on at that time
[1:43:17] in the in the businessmen's convention.
[1:43:21] He said, "I was glad to see my daughter
[1:43:24] come in, sit down just a few minutes
[1:43:27] ago." What was he why was he glad? I
[1:43:31] want to get her in a
[1:43:36] atmosphere. I want her to receive the
[1:43:39] baptism of the spirit and that's why
[1:43:42] she's here in the meeting. That's the
[1:43:44] purpose of it. Oh, how often I've taken
[1:43:48] weapons from message preachers around
[1:43:50] for having youth camp where the purpose
[1:43:53] is to get our young people filled with
[1:43:55] the
[1:43:56] spirit. You know, I I I am not denying
[1:43:59] it can happen in a home church, but
[1:44:02] sadly too often the atmosphere isn't
[1:44:04] there. It isn't right in order for
[1:44:09] somebody to be born
[1:44:10] again. Amen. It takes atmosphere. You
[1:44:14] see how important it
[1:44:16] is. We don't have to have youth camp
[1:44:18] once a year.
[1:44:21] Amen. We can have the atmosphere of the
[1:44:24] Holy Ghost every service.
[1:44:27] It will come with the same kind of
[1:44:30] expectation. God, we're going to see
[1:44:32] heaven move. God, we're going to see
[1:44:35] souls saved, filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:38] The whims of the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:44:40] flow through this building, through this
[1:44:43] place, through the
[1:44:45] hearts. I'll tell you right now, Baptist
[1:44:48] atmosphere won't produce a rapture.
[1:44:51] Isuza atmosphere won't produce a
[1:44:53] rapture. It
[1:44:56] didn't. Let me go a little further. Even
[1:44:59] the charged atmosphere of the healing
[1:45:01] movement didn't produce a rapture.
[1:45:04] It came
[1:45:06] close because it produced supernatural
[1:45:09] healings. It came close because heaven
[1:45:13] came close. It opened the portals of
[1:45:16] heaven and an angel stepped out of the
[1:45:19] dimensions of eternity into time and
[1:45:22] charged the atmosphere.
[1:45:25] From that healing from the body was for
[1:45:28] the body was manifested. From that
[1:45:32] healing for the
[1:45:33] soul came down from that heavenly realm
[1:45:37] as as the token was poured out. Until
[1:45:39] today we have the same experience that
[1:45:43] they had on the day of
[1:45:45] Pentecost. And from that more angels
[1:45:47] poured into this dimension. Yeah. Even
[1:45:51] seven of them. And the seals were open.
[1:45:53] And we're that we're now preaching from
[1:45:55] an open
[1:45:57] book. But God's not
[1:46:00] through. Come on. Don't put a period on
[1:46:03] what God's done. That's
[1:46:05] denominationalism. Every moves ever
[1:46:06] there's ever been, they denominated when
[1:46:09] they put a period. I want to tell you to
[1:46:11] again, God is not through.
[1:46:13] Amen. In the last day, he pours out his
[1:46:17] spirit. Not just on a prophet, but on
[1:46:20] all flesh. Until sons and daughters
[1:46:23] prophesy.
[1:46:24] Why? Because they have eaten the book.
[1:46:26] They are charged with heaven's
[1:46:28] atmosphere. And I'll tell you, he said
[1:46:30] to them as he saw them coming, "Watch
[1:46:32] out, Satan.
[1:46:35] There's a group rising who believe the
[1:46:37] word who will take that word and cast
[1:46:40] you out."
[1:46:45] People that have taken the book
[1:46:48] ignant as spoke of in Revelation chapter
[1:46:51] 10. But once again in the last days, the
[1:46:55] word again is in a people's
[1:46:58] mouth. It is a sharp two-edged sword
[1:47:01] cutting both ways. of people that are so
[1:47:04] saturated
[1:47:06] uh and under the
[1:47:08] influence, so filled with the Holy
[1:47:11] Ghost, influenced by the mighty
[1:47:14] angel, that walking, talking word bride,
[1:47:17] fulfilling all the word concerning the
[1:47:20] virgin until at last from that heavenly
[1:47:24] atmosphere, the dead in Christ will step
[1:47:27] out. And as they do, we will step in and
[1:47:31] we will be enveloped in a crowd of
[1:47:33] glory. And we will be changed in a
[1:47:35] moment, in a twinkling of an
[1:47:37] eye. But it only be those that are born
[1:47:41] of that heavenly
[1:47:43] atmosphere. Why? Because they're not
[1:47:45] born of a
[1:47:46] creed, but they're born of the Holy
[1:47:49] Ghost. They know who he is, and they
[1:47:52] know who they are.
[1:47:56] Brother Brandon would always and often
[1:47:59] quote Dr. Bosworth, oh, Daddy
[1:48:03] Bosworth. He was a faith healer all the
[1:48:06] way back from the early 20s. And he
[1:48:10] would tell, "You can take a hen egg, put
[1:48:12] it under a puppy, and it'll hatch a
[1:48:15] chicken." Why? It's an egg and got the
[1:48:19] right atmosphere. And he said, "I don't
[1:48:22] care if you're Methodist, Baptist, Pres.
[1:48:24] appearing in the right
[1:48:26] atmosphere, it'll hatch out a newborn
[1:48:29] child of God. Claim the word. It's the
[1:48:32] atmosphere that does it. No matter what
[1:48:33] denominational tag you
[1:48:36] have, and I don't care how long you've
[1:48:38] been in the
[1:48:40] message. Amen. The only way it won't
[1:48:42] work if you hadn't been with that
[1:48:45] mate. Then your egg is
[1:48:47] unfertile. Amen. But if you take a
[1:48:49] fertile egg and you get it in the right
[1:48:51] atmosphere, do you hear me? Even light,
[1:48:54] Amen. We have a responsibility to let
[1:48:56] the light shine.
[1:48:58] Amen. Until the atmosphere gets right.
[1:49:02] Hallelujah. And we're newborn children
[1:49:05] of God are birthed into the kingdom of
[1:49:07] God. And they break out of that shell.
[1:49:11] There's some of you need to break out of
[1:49:13] the shell of your complex, the shell of
[1:49:15] your doubt, the shell of your sins,
[1:49:18] shell of your unbelief, the shell of
[1:49:20] some kind of church creed, and break out
[1:49:22] of it. It ought to be somebody today,
[1:49:25] and they're going to knock and keep on
[1:49:27] knocking. They're going to ask and keep
[1:49:29] on asking. They're going to peck a hole
[1:49:31] and get a breath of another atmosphere
[1:49:34] until they break out into that heaven's
[1:49:37] atmosphere. and they're no longer in the
[1:49:39] stinky egg of sin anymore.
[1:49:47] But no wonder the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:49] Ghost is lacking in so many
[1:49:52] churches. It is because the atmosphere
[1:49:55] is not conditioned for
[1:50:01] it. I'm telling you, we need to work. We
[1:50:05] need to
[1:50:06] work on getting the atmosphere condition
[1:50:10] for a
[1:50:11] rapture. For all too often the
[1:50:13] expectation is not there. The faith to
[1:50:17] pull down the supernatural is not there.
[1:50:20] Praise and real worship has been
[1:50:22] substituted for formalism.
[1:50:26] Instead of the Holy Spirit, anointed
[1:50:28] sermons have been replaced with lectures
[1:50:31] and psychology and are the product of
[1:50:34] intellectual knowledge instead of the
[1:50:36] Holy Ghost
[1:50:37] anointing. I'm just going to say, you
[1:50:40] know, you know, you you may be a great
[1:50:42] man, you may have great knowledge, may
[1:50:44] have great skills, you may be an ortor
[1:50:47] of the best quality. You may have won
[1:50:49] the debate
[1:50:51] classes, but unless you're not only
[1:50:54] filled with the Holy Ghost, but you're
[1:50:55] called to position and you're anointed
[1:50:57] with the Holy Ghost, you have no
[1:50:59] business trying to handle the word. It
[1:51:02] takes men that are anointed by the Holy
[1:51:05] Ghost. Not people that have just been
[1:51:07] trained up and think, well, I'll be a
[1:51:09] preacher. You can't be a preacher.
[1:51:11] You'll mess up everything. You'll bring
[1:51:14] intellectualism into the pullpit and
[1:51:16] into the church.
[1:51:18] What we need is heavenborn men, God
[1:51:22] sent, God called, God ordained, God
[1:51:25] anointed men who know God. They have met
[1:51:29] God. They have met the bill of fire.
[1:51:31] They know they're called. They know
[1:51:33] they're ordained and step in the pull
[1:51:35] pit and call heaven down until when
[1:51:38] heaven comes down, the sick are healed,
[1:51:40] the souls are saved,
[1:51:43] people are
[1:51:44] delivered. You see, if it takes the
[1:51:46] right atmosphere for people to be filled
[1:51:48] with the Holy
[1:51:49] Ghost, it's going to take the right
[1:51:52] atmosphere for
[1:51:56] rapture. Do you really think? Come on
[1:51:59] now. Do you really think the rapture is
[1:52:02] going to take place in a whole hum
[1:52:05] lukewarm leodysian spirit?
[1:52:10] Do you really think it's going to take
[1:52:12] place? You know, one day, you know,
[1:52:15] you're just going along complacent,
[1:52:18] backslid, cold,
[1:52:21] indifferent, lukewarm, formal,
[1:52:24] powerless, and all of a sudden,
[1:52:29] bam.
[1:52:31] No, that's not the way the rapture is
[1:52:33] going to happen.
[1:52:37] We shouldn't be going
[1:52:39] down. We should be going up.
[1:52:43] You see this? You see Leodysia is that
[1:52:46] spirit that made God say in Revelation
[1:52:48] 3:16, "So because you are lukewarm or
[1:52:51] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[1:52:54] out of my mouth. You will not represent
[1:52:56] me or speak for
[1:52:59] me." Right? And this modern church age,
[1:53:02] this leodyian age is rich in comfort but
[1:53:06] bankrupt in
[1:53:08] power. And we have traded the fire of
[1:53:11] the original of
[1:53:14] Pentecost. Oh, I know people don't like
[1:53:16] that word. I'm going to say it again.
[1:53:18] You've traded the fire of the original
[1:53:21] Pentecost for
[1:53:22] quotes to fight each other and made it
[1:53:26] into a powerless religion. But the bride
[1:53:29] of Christ will not go down in spiritual
[1:53:31] apathy. She will rise in power. She will
[1:53:35] rise in holiness. She will have the fire
[1:53:38] of God. Come on. Brother Brandham told
[1:53:40] us this bride will not be a Leo to see.
[1:53:44] She will be on fire for God.
[1:53:49] I want to ask you
[1:53:51] today, what kind of atmosphere are you
[1:53:54] producing?
[1:53:57] Let me bring it down to the
[1:54:00] individual. I've talked about the
[1:54:03] church, but I want to bring it down to
[1:54:07] you. There are people. They're kind.
[1:54:11] They're moral. They're good people. But
[1:54:14] they care atmosphere so dry, so empty,
[1:54:18] it actually suffocates the spirit.
[1:54:23] Too bad they bring that atmosphere to
[1:54:25] church and they're not willing to
[1:54:31] change. You know, it's it's okay, you
[1:54:34] know, if you're dry and and and
[1:54:38] empty and and backslid. Come on, church.
[1:54:44] But don't let that permeate the church.
[1:54:50] Don't come stuck in the
[1:54:52] mud. Get ready to be changed.
[1:54:58] Hallelujah. Amen. You know people who
[1:55:01] kind moral caring atmosphere that are so
[1:55:05] dry, so empty till it just suffocates
[1:55:09] the
[1:55:10] spirit. It sucks it right out of the
[1:55:13] room.
[1:55:16] But the bride of Christ will be made of
[1:55:18] people who when they walk into the room,
[1:55:22] the very air shifts as the winds of the
[1:55:26] Holy Ghost starts moving. And as it
[1:55:28] does, faith rises and joy awakens and
[1:55:31] the presence of God dies and draws near.
[1:55:33] Why? Because they carry the atmosphere
[1:55:37] of heaven.
[1:55:40] Jesus said, "Where two or more gather
[1:55:42] together in my name, there I am in the
[1:55:46] midst."
[1:55:48] Hallelujah. When when you really gather
[1:55:51] in the right atmosphere, it's going to
[1:55:53] bring him down.
[1:55:56] Somebody help me preach now. Amen. Boy,
[1:56:00] aren't you willing to get ready of that
[1:56:02] old dry and starchy
[1:56:06] and
[1:56:07] firm ways that you've been in and a
[1:56:11] backsliding condition where you're
[1:56:14] sucking the air out of the room and
[1:56:17] where instead of doing that you breathe
[1:56:20] in the winds of heaven and heaven come
[1:56:23] down into the soul and the glory
[1:56:25] hallelujah come out of your life.
[1:56:29] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:32] Hallelujah. I feel like preaching now.
[1:56:34] Amen. Until the heavens come down, until
[1:56:38] the glory cloud fills the building,
[1:56:41] until we're transfigured and changed in
[1:56:43] his presence, and we're not the same
[1:56:45] anymore. And Leodysia is a far off
[1:56:49] memory. But where is present is a living
[1:56:52] God who is the same yesterday, today,
[1:56:55] and forever.
[1:57:01] When the presence of the Lord comes
[1:57:03] down, it bursts the supernatural. Faith
[1:57:06] begins to rise and chains begin to fall
[1:57:10] and healings begin to manifest. Why?
[1:57:12] It's the
[1:57:14] atmosphere that makes the
[1:57:16] difference. I'm saying, "Oh church, oh
[1:57:20] God, oh God, waken your church." Amen.
[1:57:25] Bring back the oldfashioned soul
[1:57:27] shaking, devil chasing, prayer meeting
[1:57:30] and saints of God who know how to call
[1:57:32] heaven down. Wake us up to a spiritual
[1:57:35] reality. Wake us up to a heavenly
[1:57:37] atmosphere that burst sons and daughters
[1:57:40] into the kingdom of God.
[1:57:45] The Bible said, "Except a man be born
[1:57:47] again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:57:50] God." Because when you're truly born
[1:57:51] again, you see the kingdom in
[1:57:57] power. Birth requires an
[1:58:01] atmosphere. Just like a baby needs the
[1:58:03] warmth of the
[1:58:05] womb. Revival needs the heat of prayer.
[1:58:08] We're talking about
[1:58:12] restoration. Come on. Amen. We're
[1:58:15] talking about restoration. It needs the
[1:58:16] heat of prayer. needs the fire of the
[1:58:19] Holy
[1:58:20] Ghost. Like I said, too many don't
[1:58:23] believe in revival, but revival is
[1:58:24] restoration. And God said, "I will
[1:58:26] restore."
[1:58:29] Acts chapter 3 speaks of a time of
[1:58:32] refreshing. How many is ready for it?
[1:58:35] Amen. in the times of refreshing that
[1:58:37] comes from the presence of the Lord when
[1:58:39] he shall send Jesus Christ whom heaven
[1:58:43] must receive until the times of
[1:58:45] restitution of all things which God has
[1:58:47] spoken by the mouth of all his holy
[1:58:49] prophets since the world began. And I
[1:58:51] could preach until now till the
[1:58:53] millennium starting all the way from
[1:58:55] Eden all the way down and just showing
[1:58:57] you the mouth of all the holy prophets
[1:58:59] that spoke of
[1:59:00] restoration and restitution.
[1:59:08] That
[1:59:09] means what that
[1:59:11] means? What that
[1:59:14] means is the rapture takes place in the
[1:59:17] time of
[1:59:19] refreshing. Put that scripture up. Acts
[1:59:22] 3:19. Look at this. Repent ye therefore
[1:59:27] and be converted that your sins may be
[1:59:30] blotted out. When the
[1:59:34] Somebody read it with me. Times of what?
[1:59:38] Refreshing shall come from the presence
[1:59:41] of the Lord. Now to prove they didn't
[1:59:44] have the presence, they didn't have the
[1:59:49] refreshing. Come on. Amen. No, they
[1:59:52] claimed the
[1:59:54] presence but didn't have the refreshing.
[1:59:59] Watch now the when the your sins and we
[2:00:02] got seven church ages of false creeds
[2:00:04] doments that had to be blotted out. When
[2:00:07] the times of refreshing shall come from
[2:00:09] the presence of the Lord. Look at the
[2:00:11] next verse. And he shall send Jesus
[2:00:14] Christ which was before priest unto you.
[2:00:19] Next verse. when the which the whom the
[2:00:22] heavens must
[2:00:25] receive. Jesus cannot come back until
[2:00:29] the times
[2:00:30] of
[2:00:33] restitution. Amen. Come on.
[2:00:36] Restitution, which is a refreshing,
[2:00:39] which is a revival, which is restoration
[2:00:43] of all things which God has spoken by
[2:00:47] the mouth of all his holy prophets.
[2:00:50] Since the world began, all the word
[2:00:52] prophesied of this and here we are. Come
[2:00:56] on. That means the rapture takes place
[2:01:00] in the time of
[2:01:03] refreshing that is a result of the
[2:01:05] outpouring of his
[2:01:07] presence and that will bring
[2:01:13] Jesus. Do you want Jesus to come back?
[2:01:17] Then if you want Jesus to come back,
[2:01:20] you're going to have to start creating
[2:01:22] an atmosphere
[2:01:24] for him to come in.
[2:01:32] As Daddy Bosworth said, you put a hen
[2:01:35] egg in the right atmosphere, even under
[2:01:38] a dog, it'll hatch. Why? Because it's
[2:01:40] not the vessel. It's about the
[2:01:45] atmosphere. It ain't about the vessel.
[2:01:47] It ain't about evening
[2:01:49] light. It ain't. You got to come here to
[2:01:52] get it. All you have to do is wherever
[2:01:55] your church is, get the atmosphere
[2:01:57] right. That's all you have to do. Come
[2:02:00] on. And likewise, when the church
[2:02:03] carries an atmosphere of Holy Ghost
[2:02:05] power, people are healed. The lost are
[2:02:08] saved. The dead in spirit come alive.
[2:02:12] Not through dead cold creeds and stiff
[2:02:14] theology, but through the living,
[2:02:16] moving, breathing presence of God. Amen.
[2:02:21] For where the spirit of the Lord is,
[2:02:22] there is
[2:02:26] liberty. Let me just share with you some
[2:02:29] thoughts in my own words. And I got this
[2:02:30] from wisdom versus faith. You can go
[2:02:33] listen to it yourself. This is a great
[2:02:34] sermon, but I'm not going to read the
[2:02:36] quotes. I'm just going to just tell you
[2:02:38] what he said in my own words.
[2:02:41] Have you ever been to church where the
[2:02:44] pastor was stiff and cold and
[2:02:48] skeptical and the the congregation
[2:02:51] reflects it? Now, some of them may not
[2:02:52] be cold or stiff. They might be just
[2:02:57] skeptical. Well, the congregation
[2:02:59] reflects it. But you step into a place
[2:03:02] where the preacher preaches
[2:03:05] faith, where saints pray and come
[2:03:09] believing, and where the Holy Spirit is
[2:03:12] welcome. You'll find an
[2:03:14] atmosphere where miracles are normal and
[2:03:18] the supernatural is expected.
[2:03:22] These signs have followed them to
[2:03:24] believe. Friends, that's not a dead
[2:03:25] theology. That's a living promise.
[2:03:29] When Satan throws his atmosphere of of
[2:03:32] fear and and sickness and sorrow and
[2:03:35] depression, that's when we're to rise
[2:03:39] as kings and priests and cast out every
[2:03:42] imagination. Amen. With the sword of the
[2:03:45] spirit and cast down those fears and
[2:03:47] crush those doubts and destroy those
[2:03:50] besetting sins, hurl down every lie with
[2:03:53] the truth of the
[2:03:55] word. Amen. We can say he was, you said,
[2:03:59] "Well, brother Tim, I made some
[2:04:01] transgressions. I made some mistakes."
[2:04:03] He was wounded for your transgressions.
[2:04:07] You said, "Well, I even knew better and
[2:04:09] I did anyway." And he was bruised for
[2:04:11] your iniquities.
[2:04:15] Oh, brother Tim, I know I deserve this
[2:04:17] weapon and that's why I get it. And the
[2:04:19] chastisement, the weapon for your peace
[2:04:22] was upon him. And by the stripes that he
[2:04:24] took, you are delivered.
[2:04:28] My God ain't out to punish you. My God
[2:04:30] ain't out to send you to hell. My God
[2:04:33] isn't out there to destroy you. My God
[2:04:35] is out there to revive you, to restore
[2:04:38] you, to bring a refreshing from the
[2:04:41] presence of God. He's not out there to
[2:04:43] condemn you of your sins. He's out there
[2:04:45] to lift you up out of your sin. To give
[2:04:48] you a victory in your heart, a joy in
[2:04:50] your soul, a dance in your step.
[2:04:54] That's what he's for.
[2:04:58] [Music]
[2:04:59] Hallelujah. He was wounded for our
[2:05:03] transgression. I made mistakes and he
[2:05:05] was wounded for it. I did what was
[2:05:08] wrong, but he was bruised for it. I
[2:05:10] should have got a weapon, but he took my
[2:05:13] weapon and by his stripe I am delivered.
[2:05:20] Delivered. Healed. Delivered.
[2:05:26] Somebody shout
[2:05:29] glory.
[2:05:31] Hallelujah. Victory is already written
[2:05:34] in your blood. You don't need to beg for
[2:05:37] power. You need to use the power that's
[2:05:40] already given.
[2:05:43] Hallelujah.
[2:05:49] He said, "Behold, I give you
[2:05:51] power to tread over on
[2:05:54] serpents and
[2:05:57] scorpions." Don't stop there. And all
[2:06:00] the power of the
[2:06:02] enemy. And let me add the final word.
[2:06:05] And nothing nothing shall by any means
[2:06:09] harm you.
[2:06:17] Oh, Brother Tim, we need some members in
[2:06:18] this church. We need more, you know. We
[2:06:21] need fresh members. No, we need to
[2:06:23] revive what we got. We need a Holy Ghost
[2:06:27] revival in the ones we already have.
[2:06:30] Oh, Brother Jim, I tell you what,
[2:06:32] brother Jim, my evening light is on
[2:06:34] fire. We need a greater fire.
[2:06:37] I'm blowing on it this morning. The
[2:06:39] winds of the spirit is moving. Want to
[2:06:41] blow on it. He wants a bigger fire in
[2:06:43] your soul. He wants to consume the old
[2:06:46] self.
[2:06:48] I hear brother Brandon say it one time.
[2:06:51] He said, "And one day there'll come
[2:06:52] another
[2:06:53] phoenix, the coming of the Lord
[2:06:56] Jesus." And I thought, "Oh my, wonder
[2:06:59] what these guys in Phoenix are thinking.
[2:07:02] One day they're going to come another
[2:07:04] phoenix. You know, Phoenix so blessed
[2:07:05] coming another. You know, heaven's going
[2:07:07] to be just like
[2:07:10] Phoenix. You
[2:07:13] know, they didn't say that because maybe
[2:07:17] they're
[2:07:18] idiots, because they were ignorant. You
[2:07:21] know what a phoenix was? A phoenix was a
[2:07:25] bird in Greek mythology.
[2:07:29] And the old phoenix was this was he was
[2:07:32] actually a a supernatural bird, you
[2:07:36] know, and he would get old and decrepit
[2:07:39] and get where he couldn't fly and we'd
[2:07:42] be all beat down and
[2:07:46] earthbound and he couldn't move, you
[2:07:48] know, and he's crusted over and his
[2:07:50] vision is gone and he's
[2:07:55] dying. Are you with me?
[2:07:58] Sounds like modern church, don't it?
[2:08:01] Amen. A phoenix might sound like you.
[2:08:05] But that's not the end.
[2:08:07] As that phoenix was coming right down to
[2:08:10] that final
[2:08:11] moment, there was a fire that would bust
[2:08:15] out of his inner being and it would
[2:08:17] consume the old bird. And out of that
[2:08:20] fire would fly a brand new
[2:08:23] bird, healthy, well, healed, delivered.
[2:08:28] Someday there's coming another phoenix.
[2:08:31] It's the coming of the Lord Jesus where
[2:08:34] the fire of God gets so in the hearts of
[2:08:37] men and women until the Holy Ghost will
[2:08:39] strike a people until the old bird is
[2:08:42] burned and they're filled with the fire
[2:08:46] of the living God. Hallelujah.
[2:08:55] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:09:09] Glory. Maybe you feel the penis
[2:09:14] part.
[2:09:16] Weary, tired.
[2:09:18] wore out
[2:09:21] blinded. Sounds like
[2:09:24] Samson. But one day he reached back and
[2:09:26] said, "The power is being restored.
[2:09:31] I feel it. My covenant with God is
[2:09:34] coming back. I'm beginning to believe.
[2:09:39] I'm beginning to believe again.
[2:09:42] Amen. This high faith is moving in my
[2:09:44] heart. Take me over there to those two
[2:09:47] poles. Take me over there where Satan
[2:09:50] has his kingdom. Let me put my hands on
[2:09:54] each side. I might have been blinded, my
[2:09:56] eyes put out and I've been I've been
[2:10:00] made a slave, whatever. But oh, today
[2:10:04] let that old Samson
[2:10:05] die with the Philistines.
[2:10:09] Amen. But out of it, let it come a
[2:10:11] mighty triumph where he said, "I will
[2:10:15] restore," sayaith the Lord.
[2:10:20] There ought to be a people out today
[2:10:21] crying like Samson did just once
[2:10:29] more. Well, Brother Tim, I I just wish
[2:10:33] that was the message. I just wish that
[2:10:35] was promised.
[2:10:37] Well, this prompted brother Brandham to
[2:10:39] say things like this, and you'll
[2:10:40] recognize it from from what shall I do
[2:10:43] with Jesus called Christ? But I'm going
[2:10:44] to just pay it in my own
[2:10:46] words. And I want to try to capture the
[2:10:49] thought and bring it to you. He would
[2:10:52] talk about its uniting time of God and
[2:10:55] his bride coming
[2:10:56] together. And he said, I can say this
[2:10:59] with with deepest reverence and holy
[2:11:02] fear before God. I believe the bride of
[2:11:05] Christ is already called out. I believe
[2:11:07] she's sealed into the kingdom of God by
[2:11:10] the Holy Ghost. I believe the mechanics
[2:11:13] is already in place. Yeah. The word, the
[2:11:16] faith, the
[2:11:17] revelation. Now, she's waiting for the
[2:11:21] dynamics that quickening power that'll
[2:11:23] lift her off of this earth and the glory
[2:11:25] and the rapture. I believe it with all
[2:11:27] my heart.
[2:11:29] We and I'll just say we we may not know
[2:11:32] every detail of it or how he will do it
[2:11:34] but we know one thing. He will do
[2:11:37] it. Come on. His word won't fall to the
[2:11:40] ground. The dynamics of this end time
[2:11:43] church will be a Holy Ghost explosion.
[2:11:48] Amen. Not just a little blessing. No, a
[2:11:51] refilling. A fresh baptism of the fire.
[2:11:55] What we've had so far has been a
[2:11:57] foretaste. But the
[2:11:59] headstone that we've been reading about
[2:12:01] every service, the headstone, Jesus
[2:12:04] Christ himself is coming down. And when
[2:12:06] the head and the body are joined
[2:12:08] together, glory to God, the full power
[2:12:10] of Pentecost will strike the bride and
[2:12:13] she'll raise like a heavenly astronaut
[2:12:16] with resurrection power.
[2:12:19] Amen. The living and the dead will rise
[2:12:22] together.
[2:12:25] The graves will burst open.
[2:12:28] Maybe not literally pushing over
[2:12:30] tombstones, but somehow someway those
[2:12:33] bones will raise because they were once
[2:12:36] filled with quickening power. Every one
[2:12:39] of them that had the Holy Ghost that are
[2:12:42] laying out there in the graveyard, amen,
[2:12:44] that they were filled with quickening
[2:12:46] power. And that quickening power, Amen,
[2:12:49] will find those bones and will hit those
[2:12:53] bones again. And out of the grave that
[2:12:55] will come.
[2:12:57] Do you believe it? Oh, however it
[2:13:00] happens, the dead in Christ will come
[2:13:02] forth in glorified bodies, and we which
[2:13:06] are alive and remain. Amen. We will be
[2:13:09] changed in a moment, and a twinkling of
[2:13:12] an eye.
[2:13:16] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. I believe
[2:13:19] it can happen this morning. Amen. too
[2:13:22] many out too many times people people
[2:13:24] have made the church a morg and a
[2:13:26] graveyard it's time to raise the dead
[2:13:29] and I'm not talking about saying church
[2:13:33] dismissed you'll get that tomorrow
[2:13:35] that's not what I'm talking about
[2:13:37] sometimes that'll raise the dead by
[2:13:38] saying church dismissed I ain't talking
[2:13:41] about that I'm talking about the Holy
[2:13:43] Ghost coming in with quickening power
[2:13:46] moving in the lives and hearts of men
[2:13:48] and women and they're filled with the
[2:13:50] uncction of the Holy Ghost And the Holy
[2:13:52] Ghost coming over those bones.
[2:13:56] Amen. Oh, son of man. Oh, prophet. Can
[2:13:59] those bones live?
[2:14:02] Yeah. Can they live? Lord, you know. I
[2:14:04] don't know. They look too dry. They look
[2:14:06] too scattered. They look too much
[2:14:08] problem. Sometimes I even give up on
[2:14:11] them. But oh, son of man,
[2:14:13] prophesy. Prophesy to the wind. Prophesy
[2:14:18] to the Holy Ghost. Say, "Come fill this
[2:14:20] host. Come fill every man, woman, boy,
[2:14:22] and girl. Come fill every person in this
[2:14:25] church until dry bones get up out of
[2:14:28] that condition and flesh come on them
[2:14:31] and the spirit of the living God comes
[2:14:33] in and they become a mighty army against
[2:14:36] the devil.
[2:14:38] Hallelujah.
[2:14:46] What are we to do? Just simply become
[2:14:48] parts of the machine of his body. the
[2:14:50] members of his body being formed and
[2:14:52] shaped in his
[2:14:54] image, watching him unite himself with
[2:14:58] us, moving among us with his works and
[2:15:02] love gifts, pouring out his presence,
[2:15:05] handing out tokens of affection before
[2:15:08] that great wedding supper of the lamb.
[2:15:11] So to quote the prophet, we're watching.
[2:15:15] We're waiting. And I say we're yearning
[2:15:18] for that
[2:15:19] moment. We have been assured by Malachi
[2:15:24] 4. How many believes in Malachi 4? So
[2:15:28] let me emphasize it by repeating it. The
[2:15:31] dynamics of this church will be a mighty
[2:15:34] refilling of the Holy Ghost. What we've
[2:15:37] had so far is just a small measure.
[2:15:40] Just a foretaste while the headstone
[2:15:44] Christ himself is coming down to
[2:15:46] perfectly unite with his
[2:15:48] body. But listen, he is not coming down
[2:15:52] rejecting. He's coming down with what?
[2:15:55] Saying grace, grace, favor upon favor,
[2:16:00] blessing upon blessing, power upon
[2:16:04] power.
[2:16:05] Hallelujah. But when that head and body
[2:16:08] come together, the full power of the
[2:16:11] Holy Spirit will strike the church like
[2:16:12] lightning. She'll rise in resurrection
[2:16:15] power. Not just the living, but even the
[2:16:18] dead in Christ who've been rested for
[2:16:20] seven ages shall rise in the beauty of
[2:16:22] his holiness clothed in immortality to
[2:16:25] take a glorious flight into the
[2:16:27] skies. Oh, I need another witness,
[2:16:31] brother Tim. Israel in the church. I
[2:16:34] truly believe before the church can have
[2:16:37] a rapture, it's got to have rapturing
[2:16:41] faith. We can't even have faith for
[2:16:44] divine healing, let alone rapturing
[2:16:48] faith. Like he said, and I've read it
[2:16:50] before earlier in the sermon, but our
[2:16:54] traditions, we've taught it away from
[2:16:56] the people. What we must do is bring
[2:16:59] that living faith back to the people and
[2:17:01] bring God back because the sick are
[2:17:04] going home sick. And it isn't because of
[2:17:08] God. It's because a lack of the
[2:17:12] revival. Amen. But we got to have a
[2:17:16] faith that changed and quickened this
[2:17:18] body to be taken away. And he says, "I
[2:17:21] believe," and I'm quoting, "There's a
[2:17:23] church on its road, a power of a living
[2:17:27] God that men will speak the word here
[2:17:30] and there and it'll flash like
[2:17:33] lightning." And a church is coming out,
[2:17:35] not a
[2:17:36] psychologist, not some of this make
[2:17:39] believe put on, but a real true genuine
[2:17:42] anointed Holy Ghost called out church.
[2:17:45] So he tells us the dynamics is the Holy
[2:17:48] Spirit. And I just want to say he's
[2:17:52] here.
[2:17:55] Amen. He's coming for a mighty
[2:17:58] crescendo. That was him in the divine
[2:18:01] healing move. That was him opening up
[2:18:04] seven seals and revealing the mysteries.
[2:18:06] Every But he's here now and he's coming
[2:18:09] for a mighty crescendo. He's moving now.
[2:18:12] He's working now. And even when you
[2:18:14] don't feel it, he's still working. And
[2:18:16] even when you don't see it, he's still
[2:18:18] working. He hasn't stopped working.
[2:18:21] Amen. He'll never stop working. He's
[2:18:24] working today. He's moving in a
[2:18:26] ministry. He's raising faith in your
[2:18:28] heart because that's God working.
[2:18:30] Getting people to
[2:18:33] believe. Because when they believe,
[2:18:37] nothing can stand before their prayers,
[2:18:40] not even cancer.
[2:18:50] Oh
[2:18:52] my. I just want to
[2:18:56] say he's preparing a bride right now.
[2:19:00] There's a people for his name's sake.
[2:19:02] I'm going to say this. We're not of the
[2:19:05] falling
[2:19:06] world. Amen. We are
[2:19:10] predestinated not to fall. Eve was made
[2:19:14] where she could
[2:19:15] fall. But once you're sealed with the
[2:19:18] Holy
[2:19:19] Ghost, you are sealed to the day of
[2:19:22] redemption, meaning you're predestinated
[2:19:25] not to fall. Amen. That means we as a
[2:19:29] church are not going to be part of the
[2:19:32] falling. We are predestinated not to
[2:19:36] fall. Therefore, we are ascending.
[2:19:40] We are for ordained to be victorious.
[2:19:44] We've been given the greatest weapon
[2:19:46] ever given, the Holy Spirit himself. And
[2:19:48] it's not a feeling. It's not an emotion.
[2:19:49] It's not a theology. It's a person.
[2:19:52] Jesus Christ in spirit form living on
[2:19:55] the inside of us. All we got to do is
[2:19:58] climb up the king's highway and ascend
[2:20:00] and rise into the heights of glories.
[2:20:04] Raptured up into a glorious atmosphere
[2:20:07] where all things are possible. Amen. Do
[2:20:10] you believe it this morning? Let the
[2:20:11] musicians come. Amen. Let the musicians
[2:20:15] come. Let's worship the Lord
[2:20:18] together.
[2:20:20] [Applause]
[2:20:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:20:27] Satan is a bluff. He's a defeated foe.
[2:20:30] Jesus spoiled principalities and powers
[2:20:33] made to show them open. And he's not
[2:20:35] afraid of you. No, not afraid of me.
[2:20:39] He's not afraid of your name or your
[2:20:41] title or your position. But he is afraid
[2:20:43] of the blood of Jesus Christ and the
[2:20:46] word of your testimony. You may feel
[2:20:49] weak and unworthy and unqualified, but
[2:20:52] when you present not your worthiness,
[2:20:54] but you but not that you're perfect, but
[2:20:57] when you present the blood of Jesus
[2:21:00] Christ, that perfect sacrifice, let me
[2:21:03] tell you, demons tremble. Hell backs off
[2:21:06] because Satan knows he can't cross the
[2:21:09] bloodline.
[2:21:12] Hallelujah. I tell you this morning, he
[2:21:14] can't cross the bloodline. Present the
[2:21:17] blood, the token with your prayer. He's
[2:21:21] got to give way to the name of Jesus
[2:21:23] Christ. Would there be a people this
[2:21:25] morning stand on their feet and say to
[2:21:27] hell, "Hell, give way to the name of
[2:21:30] Jesus Christ. Gates of hell, give way.
[2:21:35] I'm coming through. I'm going to have
[2:21:37] victory in my life. I'm setting the
[2:21:40] clothes of unbelief and putting on the
[2:21:43] clothes of gladness. I'm going to have
[2:21:45] joy unspeakable and full of glory. Let
[2:21:48] the world be without revival. I am a
[2:21:50] restored person. I am a part of the
[2:21:53] revival in this last day. Glory to God
[2:21:56] in the highest. Raise your hands to him
[2:21:59] and give him praise right now. Give him
[2:22:01] glory. All you people, come on. You
[2:22:04] ought to know how to praise God. Let the
[2:22:06] shouts of the king, the glory of God.
[2:22:08] Let the glory cloud fill this building
[2:22:10] today. Hallelujah.
[2:22:18] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[2:22:21] Lord. Come on. Don't give up. Don't not
[2:22:22] just a little bit. You're a high priest
[2:22:24] now. Offer a sacrifice of praise. Say,
[2:22:27] "I don't feel like it. Do it anyhow.
[2:22:30] Break out of your unbelief right now.
[2:22:32] Move into the heavenly realms.
[2:22:35] Let the Holy Spirit charge your mortal
[2:22:38] being. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:22:41] Glory to his name. Amen.
[2:22:47] Hallelujah.
[2:22:49] Hallelujah. Let the redeemed of the Lord
[2:22:51] say so. Why don't you say I'm healed?
[2:22:55] Why don't you declare I'm delivered? Why
[2:22:57] don't you declare my children are coming
[2:22:59] home? Why don't you declare, Amen, at
[2:23:02] least be there and her offspring with
[2:23:04] her? Why don't you declare, "Oh, the
[2:23:06] complexes is gone." Amen. The unbelief
[2:23:09] is leaving. I'm rising higher.
[2:23:12] Hallelujah. Declare it this morning.
[2:23:15] Declare it for your life. Declare it for
[2:23:17] your
[2:23:18] heart.
[2:23:20] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[2:23:22] Lord. Get rid of that unforgiven spirit.
[2:23:25] Get rid of that
[2:23:26] unbelief. Quit holding on to the grudge
[2:23:29] that's hold you down for years and
[2:23:30] years. Get rid of it. Surrender your
[2:23:33] life right now. Give it all to Jesus.
[2:23:38] Hallelujah. Get the monkey off your back
[2:23:41] this morning. Amen. You've held it too
[2:23:44] long. Something complex. Want to destroy
[2:23:47] your marriage, want to destroy your
[2:23:49] home. God wants you.
[2:23:51] God wants to heal you. God wants to
[2:23:54] bring
[2:23:56] deliverance.
[2:23:58] Hallelujah.
[2:24:00] Amen. Amen. Play softly that soft real
[2:24:03] softly. Glory to his name.
[2:24:09] I just want you to worship him just for
[2:24:10] a
[2:24:11] moment. Thank you,
[2:24:14] Jesus.
[2:24:16] Hallelujah. Let the Holy
[2:24:18] Spirit as it blow straight. Come on. You
[2:24:22] can't do like this and
[2:24:24] fly. You can't just hold it in. You have
[2:24:28] to start spreading those
[2:24:32] wings. The winds of the spirits, boy,
[2:24:34] don't resist it. Don't Don't hug up real
[2:24:37] close and make yourself small and and
[2:24:40] don't let him move
[2:24:42] you. Break
[2:24:45] out. Take those feeble hands that hangs
[2:24:47] down. Lift him
[2:24:50] up. Go to praise in the name of the Lord
[2:24:52] your God. And as the Holy Spirit moves,
[2:24:55] as the wind blows, jump off of that old
[2:24:58] low limb you've been
[2:25:00] on. Amen. Get out of those doldrums
[2:25:03] you've been in.
[2:25:05] Amen. Leave that old unbelief and the
[2:25:07] chattering of that old squirrel behind
[2:25:09] saying days of miracles are passed,
[2:25:11] you'll never do it. You can have the
[2:25:13] Holy Ghost. The promise is unto you. Can

[2:25:31] call. That's how long it lasts. As long
[2:25:34] as he's still calling, he's poured it
[2:25:37] out. Amen. Moving to the
