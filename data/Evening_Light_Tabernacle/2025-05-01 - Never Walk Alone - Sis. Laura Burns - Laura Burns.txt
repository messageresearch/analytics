========================================

If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have doubted you. I wish I could tell my younger self just to have faith. There's so many mountains you have moved and valleys you have led me through. And it's only by your grace I'm standing here today. I'm a witness to your faithfulness in every storm, in every step looking back. Never once did you let me go. And no matter what the future holds, you're working it for my good. I know you are faithful and I never walk alone. My life is full of miracles. The stories that I could tell. All that you've healed and all that you've done, I can't forget. So even if my life doesn't go the way I planned or how I hoped, our history has shown. You've never failed me yet. I'm a witness to your faithfulness. In every storm, in every step, looking back. Never once did you let me go. And no matter what the future holds, you're working for my good. I know you are faithful. And I've never walked alone. So I've never walked alone. Nothing and no one can separate me. [Music] Oh, you go behind me and before me. Oh, cuz nothing and no one can separate me. No, cuz every moment I know you're with me. And no matter what the future holds, you're working for my good. I know you are faithful. And I never walk alone. I never walk [Music] alone. Oh, I never walk alone. [Music] [Applause]
