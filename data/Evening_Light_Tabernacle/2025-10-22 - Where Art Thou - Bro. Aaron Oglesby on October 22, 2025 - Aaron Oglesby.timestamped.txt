[27:03] That's how we come tonight, Lord.
[27:07] Asking forgiveness.
[27:10] [Music]
[27:12] Cry to the church in this age was
[27:15] repent.
[27:18] God, give us hearts that turn quickly to
[27:21] you,
[27:23] casting aside any idol, anything that
[27:26] we've let come close to us that would
[27:30] interfere our worship.
[27:32] Lord, as we bow our hearts and slip a
[27:36] hand up to you this evening, would you,
[27:39] Lord, as we reach out to you, would you
[27:41] reach back tonight,
[27:44] Lord? Even maybe if you're not looking
[27:46] our way, we could reach out and touch
[27:48] the hem of your garment. Something
[27:50] that's been troubling us for years would
[27:53] God, it would just be taken away in a
[27:55] moment.
[27:58] Lord, we'd realize that in your
[28:01] presence, we're clean.
[28:03] In your presence, Lord, you've made us
[28:06] holy.
[28:10] Lord, there's been sacrifices made
[28:13] [Music]
[28:14] just to be in your house tonight.
[28:17] There's people that have struggled
[28:20] today, but they've made it.
[28:24] They're asking you, maybe like Samson,
[28:27] they've placed their hands on the
[28:29] pillars.
[28:31] They can't see their way out, but
[28:33] they're saying, "Once more, Lord,
[28:36] would your presence come this evening?
[28:41] Lord, not only here but
[28:44] maybe in an airport or an airplane
[28:47] somewhere between here in Europe as our
[28:50] pastor.
[28:53] He's looking to you for a word to speak
[28:56] to a group of people that he's not
[28:58] around every day.
[29:00] Maybe not the sheep of his pasture,
[29:03] but they're your sheep, Lord.
[29:07] Give him words to speak and be with our
[29:10] brother Timothy, Lord, as he travels.
[29:12] Give him comfort, Lord, and peace in his
[29:15] heart.
[29:17] Put words in his mouth, Father.
[29:21] Lord, as brother Aaron comes this
[29:22] evening, Lord, may we not look at a man,
[29:26] though we love the man of God,
[29:28] but may we look beyond the badger skin
[29:31] this evening,
[29:33] Lord, and pull from the holiest of
[29:35] holies what our need is, what the cry of
[29:38] our heart is, Lord.
[29:40] Maybe one needs to know you more.
[29:44] Maybe one's holding up a cup and saying,
[29:46] "God, just give me a drink."
[29:50] Maybe one's hungry this evening and
[29:53] they're asking for the bread of life to
[29:55] come and fill their hungry soul. Lord,
[29:58] we're all at different stages in
[30:00] different degrees, but we're all on that
[30:03] narrow path.
[30:06] Lord, we want to make it to heaven.
[30:09] We want to sit in your throne,
[30:13] Lord, in a place where you've called us
[30:15] to be. So Lord, don't let our we don't
[30:18] want to get our eyes so focused on the
[30:20] future that we fail in the present. But
[30:23] Lord, help us to worship you in spirit
[30:26] and in truth this evening. Those that
[30:28] have come with needs and burdens, Lord,
[30:32] you're the burden bearer.
[30:35] Lift their needs this evening, we pray,
[30:38] committing this service to you and the
[30:41] specials that'll be sung.
[30:44] We love you tonight. Maybe you just want
[30:46] to express that from your heart just for
[30:48] a moment. How we love you, Lord. Lord,
[30:52] allow us to be worshippers.
[30:55] True worshippers, Lord. Could set aside
[30:58] our own feelings and set aside our own
[31:01] doubts and our own misunderstandings and
[31:04] realize that you're the great King of
[31:05] glory that has desired that we would
[31:08] come and gather in your house of worship
[31:11] this evening and worship you in spirit
[31:13] and in truth.
[31:16] We love you Lord.
[31:19] [Music]
[31:20] Hallelujah.
[31:22] Give F.
[31:25] [Music]
[31:31] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[31:33] Just start playing that if you could.
[31:36] Amen. The brothers wouldn't mind
[31:38] receiving the offering this evening.
[31:40] Give us unto the Lord is he's given to
[31:43] you.
[31:45] [Music]
[31:46] Amen. Brother Sam and the girls have a
[31:49] special tonight. So if they can get
[31:50] ready, we'll just sing a little bit of
[31:52] this.
[31:56] When the music fades,
[32:01] all is stripped away.
[32:04] And I simply come,
[32:07] [Music]
[32:12] longing just to bring
[32:16] something that's of worth
[32:20] that will bless your heart.
[32:25] I'll bring you more. I'll bring you more
[32:29] than a song.
[32:32] Cuz the song in itself is not what you
[32:37] have required.
[32:40] Can you change the verse?
[32:43] You search much deeper within
[32:48] way things appear. You're looking into
[32:53] my heart.
[32:59] I'm coming back.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; And it's all about you.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; It's all about you, Jesus.
[33:15] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've
[33:20] made it. It's all about you.
[33:26] It's all about you, Jesus.
[33:32] King of endless world.
[33:36] No one could express
[33:40] how much you deserve.
[33:46] [Music]
[33:48] Though I'm weak and cold,
[33:52] all I have is yours.
[33:56] Every single breath.
[34:01] [Music]
[34:03] I'll bring you more than a song.
[34:08] for a song in itself is not what you
[34:13] have required.
[34:16] He's searching.
[34:18] You search much deeper within
[34:23] through the way things are. You're
[34:27] looking into my heart.
[34:32] I'm coming back.
[34:36] to the heart of worship
[34:41] where it's all about you
[34:44] Lord. It's all about you Jesus
[34:50] [Music]
[34:56] where it's all about you.
[35:01] It's all about you, Jesus.
[35:05] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[35:12] It's all about you.
[35:15] [Music]
[35:16] It's all about you, Jesus.
[35:21] I'm sorry for the things I waited.
[35:28] And it's all about you.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; It's all about you, Jesus.
[35:36] God bless you tonight.
[35:40] [Music]
[35:53] Well, Abraham
[35:57] prayed for the day
[36:00] [Music]
[36:02] God would give
[36:06] him a son.
[36:10] Blessed Isaac
[36:14] was his name.
[36:18] The greatest gift
[36:22] he'd ever known
[36:27] that came the day.
[36:31] Who would have dreamed?
[36:35] God would say,
[36:38] "You got to give him back to me."
[36:43] And on this mountain,
[36:47] you must prove
[36:51] that it's you and Isaac.
[36:55] For it's me and you.
[37:00] When I lay
[37:04] my eyes down
[37:08] &gt;&gt; with a broken heart,
[37:12] but my father's round
[37:15] [Music]
[37:16] and on this
[37:20] where he lay
[37:25] just to find that it wasn't him. God
[37:28] wanted me.
[37:32] Now most of us,
[37:36] I dare to say
[37:40] we've got an Isa
[37:43] [Music]
[37:44] standing in God's way.
[37:48] But it's on this altar
[37:52] you too can prove
[37:56] that it's not your Isaac that God wants.
[38:01] He wants you.
[38:05] When I lay
[38:08] my eyes down
[38:12] with a broken heart,
[38:16] but my father's proud
[38:20] and on this
[38:25] where he lay
[38:29] just to find that it wasn't him. God one
[38:34] with me.
[38:35] [Music]
[38:38] &gt;&gt; All to Jesus
[38:42] I
[38:44] surrender
[38:46] all
[38:48] to him I freely
[38:52] give.
[38:54] I will ever
[38:58] love and I'll trust him in his presence
[39:06] daily
[39:08] live.
[39:10] I
[39:12] surrender
[39:14] all.
[39:19] I surrender
[39:23] all
[39:26] [Music]
[39:28] to thee my blessed
[39:33] savior
[39:35] I
[39:37] surrender.
[39:39] [Music]
[39:42] When I lay
[39:46] my eyes down
[39:50] with a broken heart,
[39:54] but my father's crown
[39:58] and on this altar
[40:02] where he lay
[40:07] just to find that it wasn't you God
[40:11] wanted me
[40:15] on this altar
[40:18] where he lay
[40:23] just to find that it wasn't him. God
[40:27] won't be me.
[40:31] [Music]
[40:42] Amen. Why don't we stand together this
[40:43] evening? Key of G, if you could, as we

[44:19] [Applause]
[44:24] &gt;&gt; I give myself away.
[44:28] [Music]
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's willing to do that
[44:34] tonight? to just give yourself away to
[44:36] his will and his purpose so that you can
[44:38] be used. Amen. Let's pray together.
[44:41] Father, Lord, how grateful we are for
[44:43] this opportunity, Lord, to be in your
[44:45] presence, Lord, another opportunity to
[44:47] gather, Lord. I pray we not take it for
[44:49] granted, but may we just, Lord, use
[44:51] every moment of it, Lord, to glorify
[44:53] you, draw closer to you, Lord. May we
[44:55] lock in just now and allow you to speak,
[44:57] Father. Lord, I recognize my own
[45:00] inabilities, Lord. And Lord, have
[45:02] nothing that I could say or do that
[45:03] would benefit your people. But Father,
[45:05] if I can step aside tonight and allow
[45:06] you to speak, Lord, I believe tonight,
[45:09] Lord, that we can be blessed in your
[45:11] presence and touched by your word. And
[45:12] Lord, may your word take its effect
[45:14] tonight, we pray. Father, Lord, I pray
[45:16] you'll be with Brother Joe, Brother Tim,
[45:18] Brother Timothy, Lord, as they're out
[45:19] tonight, Lord, use them for your glory.
[45:21] I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God
[45:26] bless you this evening. It's good to be
[45:28] in the house of God. And if you have
[45:30] your Bibles and you'd like to turn with
[45:32] me to Genesis 3 and verse 7. Genesis 3
[45:36] and verse 7. And Amen. I appreciate your
[45:40] prayers. I know some of you, you know,
[45:41] I've been dealing with a some things. I
[45:44] have a a surgery scheduled for Tuesday.
[45:47] I have four four stones in my right
[45:49] kidney. One really large one about a
[45:52] half inch that they're going to go in
[45:54] and uh and hopefully take care of. and
[45:56] we're just believing everything's going
[45:57] to go well. Amen. But we're just going
[46:00] to we're here tonight trusting the Lord
[46:02] to give us strength and be with us and
[46:04] and we'll give you all we got tonight.
[46:06] Amen. Amen. If we see here Genesis
[46:09] chapter 3 and verse 7, I want to speak
[46:12] to you on a little a question tonight.
[46:15] Where art thou? Where art thou? The
[46:19] Bible says here, "And the eyes of them
[46:21] both were opened, and they knew that
[46:23] they were naked, and they sewed fig
[46:26] leaves together, and made themselves
[46:28] aprons. And they heard the voice of the
[46:31] Lord God walking in the garden in the
[46:33] cool of the day. And Adam and his wife
[46:35] hid themselves from the presence of the
[46:36] Lord God amongst the trees of the
[46:39] garden. And the Lord God called unto
[46:42] Adam, and said unto him, Where art
[46:45] thou?" And he said, 'I heard thy voice
[46:47] in the garden and I was afraid because I
[46:50] was naked and I hid myself. We also want
[46:53] to read from Matthew chapter 14
[46:57] verse 22. Matthew 14:22.
[47:00] We're going to read down through verse
[47:02] 31. It says, "And straightway Jesus
[47:04] constrained his disciples to get into a
[47:06] ship and to go before him unto the other
[47:09] side while he sent the multitudes away.
[47:12] And when he had sent the multitudes
[47:13] away, he went up into a mountain apart
[47:15] to pray. And when the evening was come,
[47:18] he was there alone. But the ship was now
[47:21] in the midst of the sea, tossed with
[47:23] waves, for the wind was contrary. And in
[47:26] the fourth watch of the night, Jesus
[47:28] went unto them walking on the sea. And
[47:30] when the disciples saw him walking on
[47:32] the sea, they were troubled, saying, It
[47:34] is a spirit. And they cried out for
[47:36] fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto
[47:38] them, saying, Be of good cheer. It is I.
[47:41] be not afraid. And Peter answered him
[47:44] and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
[47:47] come unto thee on the water. And he
[47:49] said, Come. And when Peter was come out
[47:51] of the ship, he walked on the water to
[47:54] go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind
[47:56] boisterous, he was afraid and beginning
[47:59] to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save
[48:02] me. And immediately Jesus stretched
[48:04] forth his hand and caught him and said
[48:06] unto him, "Oh, thou of little faith,
[48:09] wherefore did thou doubt?" Amen. I just
[48:12] pray that the Lord will add his blessing
[48:14] to the reading of the word as you take
[48:16] your seats tonight.
[48:22] Where art thou?
[48:25] Where art thou? As we look at this
[48:27] tonight, I I want us to to recognize
[48:30] that that is an applicable question to
[48:33] your life, regardless of where you're at
[48:35] tonight. It's not a condemnation. It's
[48:38] not an accusation. It's just an
[48:41] opportunity to be honest with yourself
[48:43] and with God. No matter how far we've
[48:46] come in our journey, no matter where
[48:48] you're at on the ladder, how low, how
[48:50] far, how high, we all still have farther
[48:53] to go. And a lot of times in order to
[48:56] recognize where we need to go, we need
[48:57] to recognize where we're at. Where are
[49:00] we as an individual? Even even born
[49:02] again and and sealed with the spirit,
[49:04] there are moments and times in our life
[49:07] that we need to stop. We need to look
[49:08] and we need to listen and and take
[49:11] account and take inventory and answer
[49:13] the question that God asked tonight.
[49:16] Where art thou? Where are you? And it's
[49:19] a call to an honest heart, for an honest
[49:21] moment. Am I allin? Uh is my life lining
[49:25] up? Where am I? Born again and on fire.
[49:29] Born again and in a slump, justified,
[49:32] sanctified. Am I stagnant? A am I
[49:36] walking with the Lord tonight? Do I do I
[49:38] have wrong feelings towards people? Do I
[49:40] have excuses? Am I progressing? A am I
[49:44] am I free tonight?
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Am I free how I'm supposed to be? And I
[49:48] ask it again, where art thou? Where do
[49:51] you find yourself tonight? And and even
[49:54] going beyond the individual as a church
[49:56] tonight, we should take inventory. And
[49:58] what are we producing? Uh
[50:01] what what are we patterning after? Are
[50:03] are we fulfilling the role that God has
[50:05] called us to fulfill at Evening Light
[50:07] Tabernacle? Are are the works of Christ
[50:09] being manifested? Is the new birth being
[50:11] preached? Um are lives being changed?
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Evening Light Tabernacle, where art
[50:17] thou?
[50:18] You know, and it's not my job to preach
[50:20] to the entire message community tonight.
[50:22] I'm here to preach to you. But but I
[50:24] would ask that question worldwide. Where
[50:26] are we?
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Where are we? What what are we doing?
[50:30] And and and if we if we look back before
[50:32] the beginning, before man and even
[50:34] before Eden, there there was God and God
[50:37] dwelt alone. And and I I guess we would
[50:40] say he, Brother Brandon would tell us he
[50:41] wasn't even God then because God is an
[50:43] object of worship. He was just a great
[50:45] eternal spirit. and and at some point he
[50:48] creates the angels that that worship him
[50:50] every day. But but there was more that
[50:52] God wanted to do there. There was
[50:55] attributes of himself that he wanted
[50:57] expressed. Amen. And he wanted
[50:59] manifested and and he begins to create
[51:02] the earth and and eventually he'll he'll
[51:05] create sons and daughters and and he'll
[51:07] place them on that earth so that he
[51:09] could have a relationship with them.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wanted a family. He wanted
[51:15] someone to love him and and someone that
[51:18] loved to be with him and and somebody
[51:20] that he could fellowship with and have
[51:22] relationship with. And the prophet of
[51:24] God would say that the earth was nothing
[51:26] but a complete chaos.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; He says right here, he says, "And then
[51:31] this world was was in that condition.
[51:33] The the spirit of God moved upon the
[51:36] face of the water and the entire picture
[51:38] was changed from a total chaos to a
[51:42] garden of Eden." That is transforming
[51:45] power of God that can take something
[51:48] that's nothing and make something
[51:50] wonderful out of it. God's transforming
[51:54] power. I love that tonight. Don't you?
[51:56] The the the the the transforming power
[51:59] of God that when something looks
[52:00] hopeless or something looks out of
[52:02] control, all it takes is is the
[52:04] transforming power of God to move on
[52:06] that situation tonight. Amen. And the
[52:09] scripture says it was dark and without
[52:12] form and void and and the spirit of God
[52:15] moved and God said, "Let there be."
[52:20] &gt;&gt; And that mass of nothing began to come
[52:22] subject to the word that God spoke. And
[52:26] it moved and and that mass began to come
[52:28] and and move around the sun. And it
[52:30] began to to orbit around the sun. and
[52:33] and out of that chaos comes an Eden
[52:37] because of God's power to transform. And
[52:40] I'm thankful for all that tonight. I I I
[52:43] marvel at the power of creation and and
[52:45] the creation story. And and it's amazing
[52:48] that that God did that and he created
[52:50] the earth and he brought the chaos into
[52:53] a perfect Eden and earth. But I'm also
[52:55] thankful tonight that it's that his
[52:57] transforming power wasn't all just for
[52:59] for this earth, but it was for this
[53:01] earth right here. It was It was for this
[53:04] chaos right here. It was for this
[53:06] trouble that was going on right here.
[53:08] God's power to transform works in this
[53:11] earth tonight. Amen. Amen. This mess, no
[53:14] matter how messed up it is and how out
[53:16] of control it seems, it doesn't matter
[53:18] how dark, it doesn't matter how far it's
[53:21] wandered. What we need is for the same
[53:23] thing that happened there in Genesis. We
[53:25] need the spirit of God to move tonight.
[53:27] And one moment in his presence, one
[53:30] moment in your situation can take all of
[53:32] that chaos and produce an Eden out of it
[53:35] in just that amount of time. Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we would just yield our
[53:40] thinking and and yield our hurts and and
[53:43] let go and let God begin to move off
[53:46] across the face of our lives tonight.
[53:48] Let him move tonight because when God
[53:52] moves, things don't stay the same.
[53:54] When God moves, things take place. When
[53:57] God moves, things happen and he can
[53:59] restore order and he can bring
[54:01] deliverance and he can bring the peace
[54:03] that your heart desires. Wherever you're
[54:06] at tonight, what do I need, brother? You
[54:08] need God to move in your life.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he can bring you in in into an
[54:14] Eden again where you have fellowship
[54:16] with God. You mean Eden, brother Aaron?
[54:18] Everything's going to be perfect. No,
[54:19] no, no. I don't mean that. But an Eden
[54:22] condition where you and God once again
[54:24] can have fellowship. An Eden condition
[54:27] where you and God can walk together in
[54:29] the cool of the heen evening and and you
[54:32] can love him and he can love you and
[54:33] there's nothing between you and your
[54:36] God. That's an Eden condition tonight.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Once again in relationship with God
[54:42] where he comes down and walks with you
[54:44] where where you share your heart and he
[54:46] shares his love and wisdom and
[54:48] leadership. That's what made it Eden. It
[54:52] was God's presence that made it Eden. It
[54:55] was the fact that he was there and the
[54:57] presence of God and the ability to
[54:59] fellowship with him. He says in the
[55:02] beginning when God made the man to
[55:04] worship him and live, God taken care of
[55:06] him and fed him. Man had a perfect
[55:09] fellowship with God. There was nothing
[55:11] wrong. God came down in the evening and
[55:13] talked to Adam and Eve. What a beautiful
[55:16] picture. They was in the presence of the
[55:19] omnipotent powers of God which which
[55:21] held them in control and guided them by
[55:23] his spirit. There was nothing could harm
[55:26] them. Now in the beginning when God come
[55:28] down in the evening and talked to Adam
[55:31] and Eve in the cool of the day, his
[55:32] great voice whispered to them and they
[55:35] had fellowship
[55:37] loved one another. How the moving of the
[55:39] spirit went through the bushes, the
[55:41] lions come up, the tigers, all of them,
[55:43] and they worshiped the Lord. Man was
[55:45] conscious at all times that his presence
[55:49] was with him.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Conscious at all times. And that's
[55:52] something that was lost down through the
[55:54] ages as the atmosphere has become
[55:56] clogged with demons and and and this
[55:58] world has been given over to Satan's
[56:01] Eden that even though we know and even
[56:03] though we have faith that consciousness
[56:05] that God is always there was robbed
[56:07] away. But notice what he said there. He
[56:10] says they had fellowship. That's what
[56:14] God had longed for all along was that
[56:16] fellowship. Perfect fellowship. That's
[56:18] what he wanted. Someone to love. Someone
[56:21] to walk with and talk with. Someone to
[56:23] share all of this with. Relationship.
[56:27] Listen tonight. This isn't about
[56:29] theology. It isn't about knowing the
[56:32] scriptures better than other people. If
[56:34] that's all you get out of out of your
[56:36] Christian walk, then you've missed it
[56:37] completely. It is about relationship.
[56:41] It's about fellowship. It's about God
[56:43] once again having somebody that he can
[56:46] commune with on a daily basis.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; That was the desire of his heart and
[56:51] that's what he still wants tonight. He
[56:53] He doesn't want you here out of duty
[56:55] even though it is our duty. But that's
[56:57] not the only reason you should be here
[57:00] out of a law. He doesn't want your
[57:02] prayers out of a have to. What kind of
[57:05] relationship is that?
[57:08] What kind of relationship is it really?
[57:10] or a friendship. If if when your friend
[57:12] drops by, you look out the front door
[57:14] and you're like, "Oh,
[57:17] honey, they're here again."
[57:20] Or when they call, you you you answer
[57:22] about every third one
[57:25] and you talk to them because you have to
[57:27] and you try not to get trapped by them
[57:29] after service. What kind of friendship
[57:31] is that
[57:33] &gt;&gt; if you only talk to them because you
[57:35] have no other choice? What kind of
[57:36] relationship is it if your spouse only
[57:39] spoke to you out of a have to? Or what
[57:42] if we spoke to our spouses and each
[57:44] other the way we speak to God sometimes
[57:47] and just make him an errand boy?
[57:50] Think about how much you talk to God.
[57:53] And what is it you say to him? How much
[57:55] time you telling him? How do you spend
[57:57] telling him how wonderful he is, how
[57:59] lovely he is, how mighty he is, how
[58:02] awesome he is, how much you love him.
[58:05] the same way it should be in a spousal
[58:07] relationship.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; But what if we talk to each other the
[58:10] way we talk to him sometimes? Lord,
[58:12] watch over and keep us. Lord, provide
[58:14] for us. Lord, take care of us. I pray
[58:15] you give us traveling mercies. Lord,
[58:17] bless this food. Do this. Do this. Do
[58:19] this. Y'all try that in the morning.
[58:24] Go make me some biscuits.
[58:26] You know how I like my coffee. Go do
[58:29] this. Go do that. What kind of
[58:31] relationship would you have?
[58:35] just take it and not even to be comical
[58:37] and realize sometimes how we speak to
[58:39] God to where everything is Lord do this
[58:42] do this do this instead of taking time
[58:44] to say Lord I'm so thankful I appreciate
[58:47] you so much I love you so much you've
[58:50] been so good to me you've been better to
[58:52] me than what I even deserve Lord Lord
[58:54] you're wonderful you're awesome you're
[58:56] mighty you're the deliverer you're the
[58:58] way maker you're my everything and I
[59:00] just want to come tell you Lord that I
[59:02] love you
[59:04] He wants that relationship and that
[59:07] fellowship. That's why he made in Eden.
[59:10] That's why he wanted sons and daughters.
[59:12] They were on speaking terms with God.
[59:16] And we know how that eventually the
[59:17] serpent came and and he began to twist
[59:20] the word of God. He began to talk to Eve
[59:23] and and bring questions on what God had
[59:26] said. And and young people, old people,
[59:29] everybody listen to me. The serpent
[59:31] always comes with a question.
[59:34] It always starts with a question and it
[59:37] always starts with a twist. But but did
[59:39] he really mean that?
[59:42] Surely that was for a time gone by and
[59:44] well maybe that quote means this and
[59:47] surely a loving God wouldn't do that.
[59:49] And yay hath God said. Listen it once
[59:54] again. It's evening time. This isn't
[59:57] time to be fellowshipping with the ser
[59:59] serpent. It's not time to be arguing
[1:00:01] with the serpent. It's not the time of
[1:00:03] day to be constantly feeding on on the
[1:00:06] things of the tree of knowledge of good
[1:00:08] and even evil. It's evening time. What's
[1:00:10] that mean? That's when God has come down
[1:00:12] once again. This is the time we should
[1:00:14] be fellowshipping with him more than
[1:00:16] ever. Listening to his word more than
[1:00:18] ever, feeding with him more than ever,
[1:00:21] walking in relationship and in prayer
[1:00:23] more than ever.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; It's not time to be fellowshipping with
[1:00:29] the serpent. Think about if if Eve would
[1:00:32] have recognized, not that there was ever
[1:00:33] a good time to be talking to the
[1:00:36] serpent, but what if she had recognized
[1:00:38] what time is it? Where am I?
[1:00:42] Where art thou? Oh, it's almost evening
[1:00:45] time. I I should be walking with Adam
[1:00:47] and God through the garden right now.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Why am I here? Why am I having this
[1:00:52] conversation? Look, a lot of doubts and
[1:00:55] worries and the gossip of unbelief can
[1:00:57] be avoided if you'll just avoid the
[1:00:59] conversations that go with it.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; If you'll just avoid those conversations
[1:01:03] of doubt and lending your mind to those
[1:01:05] things. It's time to cast down
[1:01:07] imagination. It's evening time. Let's
[1:01:09] get our mind back on the word of God and
[1:01:12] fellowshipping with him and walking with
[1:01:14] him and talking with him.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; If you're fellowshipping with him and
[1:01:18] walking with him, you don't have time
[1:01:20] for the serpent to get your ear.
[1:01:24] He don't have opportunity to get you get
[1:01:26] your ear. And we but we know how that
[1:01:28] they fail by listening to the lie of the
[1:01:30] serpent.
[1:01:31] But really tonight, what I want us to
[1:01:33] really focus in on is the failure
[1:01:38] after the fall.
[1:01:40] The failure after the fall. Because
[1:01:44] I I don't care how big of a fall it is,
[1:01:48] how little of a fall, how if it's
[1:01:50] backsliding, I if it's just a little
[1:01:52] lukewarmness or or just you got yourself
[1:01:54] into a situation you shouldn't have
[1:01:56] because you failed to seek his
[1:01:58] leadership. No matter what it is
[1:02:00] tonight, no matter where you are, he is
[1:02:03] the answer.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's simple, brother
[1:02:06] Aaron. We all know that." No, but
[1:02:08] listen, he is the answer.
[1:02:11] Because even though we all know that, we
[1:02:13] never turn to him.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Our first instinct is to always run away
[1:02:18] from him.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Genesis 3 and8 tells us here
[1:02:25] says, "And they heard the voice of the
[1:02:27] Lord God walking in the garden in the
[1:02:28] cool of the day. And Adam and his wife
[1:02:30] hid themselves from the presence of the
[1:02:32] Lord God amongst the trees of the
[1:02:33] garden. And the Lord God called unto
[1:02:35] Adam and said unto him, "Where art
[1:02:37] thou?" He said, "I heard thy voice in
[1:02:39] the garden. and I was afraid because I
[1:02:41] was naked and I hid myself. He was the
[1:02:44] only one that could truly help them. And
[1:02:48] yet, he's the only one that can help us.
[1:02:50] And yet, in those moments of our
[1:02:52] greatest need, we're afraid of the one
[1:02:54] thing that can save us.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; The one thing. This is the one that made
[1:03:00] you. This is the one that formed you.
[1:03:03] This is the one who loves you. This is
[1:03:04] the one who wants to help. And he's
[1:03:06] going through the garden. He's crying,
[1:03:08] "Adam,
[1:03:09] Adam, wherefore art thou, Adam?
[1:03:13] I'm here to fellowship, Adam. It's the
[1:03:16] cool of the evening. I'm I'm here to
[1:03:18] bless you tonight, evening light
[1:03:20] tabernacle.
[1:03:21] I'm here for you like I've always been.
[1:03:25] I'm here. Where are you? I'm here to
[1:03:26] fellowship."
[1:03:29] And Adam runs and from him and he hides
[1:03:32] from him. He begins trying to cover up
[1:03:34] instead of exposing it.
[1:03:39] church. That's a hard thing to do. But
[1:03:40] if you'll expose it right when it
[1:03:42] happens,
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; if you'll deal with it right when it
[1:03:45] happens,
[1:03:47] then it doesn't have the opportunity to
[1:03:48] grow and get worse and compound and take
[1:03:50] a stronghold in your life.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; But in that moment, he he runs away from
[1:03:55] it.
[1:03:57] Why do we do it?
[1:04:00] He brought us out of chaos and he gave
[1:04:02] us life and he gave us fellowship and
[1:04:04] and as soon as we begin to struggle and
[1:04:06] we begin to fail, we try to hide it and
[1:04:08] we begin rejecting his cause. And the
[1:04:11] first thing we do is we begin to break
[1:04:13] off fellowship.
[1:04:18] We get bitter about something and we let
[1:04:20] it take root. We say or do something
[1:04:22] that we shouldn't have and we let some
[1:04:24] things slip in unchecked. And the first
[1:04:26] place that it shows is in your
[1:04:29] fellowship with him and with his people.
[1:04:33] You used to love to come to church to
[1:04:36] worship him and to commune with him. And
[1:04:38] you talked to him during the day and you
[1:04:40] listened to messages on your way to
[1:04:42] work. You prayed during the day. You
[1:04:45] prayed at night. You had communion.
[1:04:48] And then something happened and some
[1:04:51] root somewhere got in that wasn't dealt
[1:04:53] with. some besetting sin or some cycle
[1:04:56] that haunts you and you start to cut him
[1:05:00] out of your days.
[1:05:02] The only one that can save you.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; The only one that can help you.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; The one that's literally searching for
[1:05:09] you going, "I'm right here. I'm right
[1:05:11] here. I'm here to forgive you. I'm I'm
[1:05:13] here to help you. I'm here to deliver
[1:05:14] you." And we're hiding from it and we're
[1:05:16] running from it and we're cutting him
[1:05:18] out. And you start to draw back from him
[1:05:21] and you give him less. and he moves in a
[1:05:24] service and you hide
[1:05:27] and he asks for fellowship and prayer
[1:05:29] and communion and you don't give it
[1:05:33] and he misses that communion.
[1:05:36] He longs for it and he misses your
[1:05:39] worship and he misses that relationship
[1:05:42] and he cries out, "Where art thou?
[1:05:46] Didn't I save you? Didn't I die for you?
[1:05:49] Where art thou?
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; What have I done? Why am I being cut
[1:05:53] off?
[1:05:54] Why won't you fellowship with me? Why
[1:05:56] won't you talk with me? Why won't you
[1:05:58] worship me?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Where art thou?
[1:06:03] We do the exact opposite of what we
[1:06:05] should be doing. In those moments, as
[1:06:08] hard as it is, and I know I've been
[1:06:09] there, but those are the moments to
[1:06:10] press in more, to cry out more, to
[1:06:13] worship more, to pray for more, to seek
[1:06:15] for more, to press the battle harder,
[1:06:18] not to hide, but to acknowledge where
[1:06:21] you are. To have an honest heart with
[1:06:23] God and seek for more of God. Adam
[1:06:26] should have been running through the
[1:06:27] garden saying, "Father, Father, Father,
[1:06:31] where are you? I need you. I've fallen
[1:06:33] and you're the only one that can help
[1:06:34] me. I need you, Lord. I failed and you
[1:06:38] are my only hope.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "And here he was. Here was the
[1:06:43] searchings of God walking, running up
[1:06:45] and down through the garden, screaming
[1:06:47] for his lost boy. The father hunting,
[1:06:50] searching for the son. It should have
[1:06:52] been the son
[1:06:54] searching for the father.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Don't make him come looking for you in a
[1:06:59] service.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; He shouldn't have to come looking for
[1:07:04] him. You should come here seeking him.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; God, I need you in this service. God,
[1:07:09] here's where I'm at. I'm not hiding it.
[1:07:12] You know my failures. You know my flaws.
[1:07:14] You know my struggles. And I'm here for
[1:07:16] you to deal with it in my life. But I'm
[1:07:19] going to worship you tonight. I'm going
[1:07:20] to praise you tonight. I'm going to open
[1:07:22] up all the things that have been hidden.
[1:07:24] And I'm going to allow you to fix me.
[1:07:27] He's the only one that can fix you.
[1:07:30] Willpower won't do it. Rules won't do
[1:07:32] it. Religion won't do it. But Jesus
[1:07:34] Christ can do it tonight when the spirit
[1:07:37] of God begins to move on your life.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; We should show up looking for him,
[1:07:46] seeking after him, being honest with
[1:07:49] him. Lord, I'm right here and here are
[1:07:53] my problems.
[1:07:55] I'm right here, Lord. Listen, all he's
[1:07:57] looking for is an honest heart.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Just an honest heart. I always look at
[1:08:04] Ananiah and Safh, you know, when and
[1:08:07] they came in and y'all know the story in
[1:08:08] the book of Acts and they had sold a
[1:08:10] piece of land
[1:08:13] and instead of coming in and saying you
[1:08:15] you got to understand, it's an
[1:08:17] interesting situation.
[1:08:20] They gave to the Lord and were killed.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; They would have been better off not
[1:08:27] giving.
[1:08:30] But the reason is because they wouldn't
[1:08:33] be honest. See, those before them came
[1:08:35] and gave all. They came and they became
[1:08:38] great men through the book of Acts. But
[1:08:41] then they came and for whatever reason,
[1:08:44] they wanted to keep some of it or needed
[1:08:46] to keep some of it. And if they had just
[1:08:48] came and said, "Peter, I sold some land.
[1:08:52] We kept this much because we had some
[1:08:54] things, but I want to give you this
[1:08:55] offering.
[1:09:00] Let me tell you what God hates is he
[1:09:02] hates when you pretend you've given
[1:09:04] everything.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; God, I've given you my all. I've given
[1:09:08] you my everything. Why am I going
[1:09:10] through this? Why am I struggling with
[1:09:11] this? I completely repented. I gave you
[1:09:14] my everything. And he's sitting there
[1:09:15] going, "No, you haven't.
[1:09:17] No, you haven't." God would rather you
[1:09:19] say, "Lord, I'm struggling with this and
[1:09:21] I'm struggling to give you this and
[1:09:23] here's where I'm at and I got this
[1:09:25] problem and God, I'm being honest with
[1:09:27] you. I need you tonight.
[1:09:30] I haven't given you everything. I
[1:09:31] recognize that. I need you to move in my
[1:09:34] life. I need you to help me. Don't
[1:09:37] pretend you've given everything
[1:09:40] when you haven't.
[1:09:42] That you haven't laid everything down
[1:09:44] when you're holding some of it back.
[1:09:51] This isn't
[1:09:53] It's an interesting thing because when
[1:09:54] you start talking about repentance,
[1:09:56] people automatically think that means
[1:09:57] you've fallen away and backslid.
[1:10:00] This isn't taking your Holy Ghost away
[1:10:02] at all. This isn't taking your
[1:10:04] experience away at all or taking your
[1:10:06] victories away at all. We got to get
[1:10:07] past that thinking that every little
[1:10:09] mistake and every little failure, I'm
[1:10:11] serpent seed.
[1:10:13] I knew I didn't get it. I guess I didn't
[1:10:16] get nothing. Listen to admit need and to
[1:10:19] admit shortcomings to make things right.
[1:10:22] To acknowledge error to acknowledge I
[1:10:24] didn't consult him before I made this
[1:10:26] decision. Those things do not disqualify
[1:10:29] your testimony.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; That does not disqualify you as a
[1:10:34] Christian. It doesn't mean you didn't
[1:10:36] get it or you don't got it. You're
[1:10:38] listening to the whisper of the serpent
[1:10:40] because that's his message. You don't
[1:10:43] have it. Look at your failure. God don't
[1:10:45] say that. He says, "I see your failure
[1:10:47] and I got some blood for you. I see your
[1:10:49] failure and I got something to help you.
[1:10:51] I see your failure and I'm lifting you
[1:10:53] up tonight because you're mine. Because
[1:10:55] you're called, because you're chosen. I
[1:10:57] know you can't make it, son. That's why
[1:10:59] I'm here to give you my spirit. Because
[1:11:01] through me, you can overcome.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:08] You are a child of the living God. You
[1:11:10] are made to fellowship. You You are made
[1:11:13] for relationship. You're made to
[1:11:15] overcome and Satan's trying to keep you
[1:11:18] hiding in the trees like Adam and Eve
[1:11:21] with with a covering instead of running
[1:11:23] to Jesus and repenting.
[1:11:26] Repenting, listen, repentance is not a
[1:11:29] one-time thing that you do. Repentance
[1:11:32] is part of your Christian walk. Listen
[1:11:37] to your prophet. And God, I repent of
[1:11:41] everything and knowing that we could not
[1:11:43] live in ourselves, Lord. But we're
[1:11:45] sinners to begin with. And daily,
[1:11:49] somebody say, daily.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Daily I trust in thee, knowing that
[1:11:55] daily I sin.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Knowing that daily things happen to me
[1:12:00] and in my life that you would not be
[1:12:03] pleased with.
[1:12:07] and I confess my wrong and accept thee,
[1:12:10] my Lord, as my own soul lays at the
[1:12:12] altar this morning at this little
[1:12:14] tabernacle prostrate here, Lord.
[1:12:18] He says, now we was talking on the word
[1:12:20] backsliding this morning. When you do
[1:12:23] that, you're backslid. Yes, sir. You've
[1:12:25] got to repent. Is that right? Now, I
[1:12:28] don't mean to say you went out in the
[1:12:29] world and you did this and that, but you
[1:12:32] done something.
[1:12:36] I don't care how holy, how pure, how
[1:12:38] perfect you are. I'm going to put it in
[1:12:40] his words. You done something.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; We've all sinned and fall short of the
[1:12:47] glory of God. I'm not making excuses for
[1:12:50] you to live in sin. And when he says
[1:12:52] he's sin, we're not talking about you.
[1:12:53] You you you know what I'm talking about.
[1:12:55] We're not talking about out smoking,
[1:12:57] drinking, committing adultery. We're
[1:12:58] talking about the everyday failures of a
[1:13:01] human being in life.
[1:13:04] Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; He says, "You've got to repent and die
[1:13:09] daily to live in Jesus Christ." So every
[1:13:12] daily, every day, you've got to die
[1:13:14] every day to live in Jesus Christ.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; So quit letting the devil tell you that
[1:13:20] because you got some things that you
[1:13:22] need to repent of that you aren't saved
[1:13:24] and filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:27] He's keeping you from the freedom and
[1:13:29] the liberty that comes when you make
[1:13:33] things right and lay those burdens down.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; I know you've been there where you
[1:13:37] carried something and it beat on you and
[1:13:39] it beat on you and it beat on you and
[1:13:41] you carried it and you carried it and it
[1:13:43] wore you down and you didn't feel good
[1:13:45] enough and you didn't feel right. You
[1:13:46] felt condemnation and all the time that
[1:13:49] was the devil just trying to get you to
[1:13:51] hold on to it cuz all you got to do is
[1:13:53] step out from the bushes. Quit hiding
[1:13:55] and say, "God, I'm right here. Here it
[1:13:57] is. I'm giving it to you." And then
[1:13:58] there's freedom that comes with that.
[1:14:01] There's rejoicing that comes with that.
[1:14:03] The burden is taken away from you. He's
[1:14:05] saying, "Quit hiding tonight. Just admit
[1:14:07] where you are, and I'm here to take care
[1:14:09] of you. I'm here to forgive you
[1:14:11] tonight."
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:15] Genesis 3 and8 again they heard the
[1:14:18] voice of the Lord God walking in the
[1:14:20] garden in the cool of the day and Adam
[1:14:22] and his wife hid themselves.
[1:14:29] The one thing that can help us.
[1:14:32] The one thing that can break us out of
[1:14:34] this slump. Maybe you're in a slump. The
[1:14:37] one thing that can get us right and here
[1:14:39] we are hiding
[1:14:41] covering with religion.
[1:14:44] hiding ourselves from what? The presence
[1:14:47] of the Lord. The thing they had longed
[1:14:49] for, the thing that they had
[1:14:50] fellowshipped with, and here they are
[1:14:52] hiding from it. Oh God, I don't want to
[1:14:56] hide myself tonight. I don't want to
[1:14:58] hide in my goodness. I don't want to
[1:15:00] hide in anything I've ever done. Or I'm
[1:15:02] a preacher. I'm a deacon. I'm a singer.
[1:15:04] I never miss a church service. You
[1:15:06] better not be hiding in any of that
[1:15:07] tonight. You better not be hiding in
[1:15:09] family name or past works or even
[1:15:11] anything other than the blood of Jesus
[1:15:13] Christ, the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:15] If you're going to hide in anything, you
[1:15:17] better be hid in him tonight.
[1:15:18] Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hide ourselves in him. The
[1:15:22] scripture says, "Keep me as the apple of
[1:15:24] the eye. Hide me under the shadow of thy
[1:15:27] wings. Not I'm hiding myself from him,
[1:15:30] but Lord, I'm running to you tonight so
[1:15:32] you can hide me. For in the time of
[1:15:34] trouble, he shall hide me in his
[1:15:36] pavilion. In the secret of his
[1:15:38] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[1:15:41] set me upon a rock. Deliver me, oh Lord,
[1:15:44] from mine enemies. I flee unto thee to
[1:15:47] hide me.
[1:15:50] Oh Lord, let your presence surround me.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Let me be hid in your presence. Not
[1:15:56] hiding from your presence tonight. Hide
[1:15:58] me from my enemies. Forgive me of my
[1:16:00] trespasses. set me upon a rock. You
[1:16:03] know, we read the story sometimes and
[1:16:06] and we get it so twisted and we think
[1:16:08] that God was looking for Adam and Eve to
[1:16:10] punish them.
[1:16:12] You don't think God knew where they
[1:16:14] were?
[1:16:15] You don't think God knew what they had
[1:16:17] done?
[1:16:20] But just as they had sinned on free
[1:16:21] moral agency, they had to come to him on
[1:16:24] free moral agency. Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Do you not think he could have carried
[1:16:29] out the punishment of death without ever
[1:16:31] seeing them and just saying dead?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; But the reason he was looking for them,
[1:16:36] the reason he was calling them was
[1:16:38] because he wasn't looking to judge them.
[1:16:40] He was looking to provide a lamb for
[1:16:42] them. And he's saying, "Where art thou?
[1:16:44] I know the punishment. I know what's
[1:16:46] about to happen. The sentence is death.
[1:16:48] Where are you, Adam? Where are you?" He
[1:16:50] was seeking him in love so that he could
[1:16:52] kill a lamb and wrap him in those bloody
[1:16:55] garments. Why is he calling to you
[1:16:57] tonight? Not to condemn you, not to
[1:16:59] judge you, but he's looking to wrap you
[1:17:01] in the blood of Jesus Christ. And he's
[1:17:03] saying, "Where art thou? Where are you?"
[1:17:05] I say, "Lord, I'm right here, Lord. I've
[1:17:08] stumbled and I've struggled and I failed
[1:17:09] over and over again, but I'm here to
[1:17:12] accept the blood of the lamb. Wrap me in
[1:17:14] it, Lord. Wrap me in your forgiveness
[1:17:17] tonight."
[1:17:19] Hallelujah.
[1:17:21] He knew the penalty of it and he was
[1:17:23] seeking Adam so he could provide a lamb
[1:17:26] for Adam.
[1:17:27] Don't he Don't you think he knows where
[1:17:29] you're at tonight? Don't he think he
[1:17:32] knows your failures tonight? He just
[1:17:35] wants you to step out with his honest
[1:17:36] heart and and say, "Lord, I'm right
[1:17:38] here. Lord, this is how far I've made
[1:17:41] it. Maybe I should be farther. Maybe I
[1:17:44] should be up there. Lord, I but this is
[1:17:46] where I'm at."
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where I'm at and I'm
[1:17:50] asking you to come, Lord, and wrap me in
[1:17:52] your love and restore me back to that
[1:17:54] fellowship. This is how I'm struggling.
[1:17:57] He doesn't want to judge you tonight. He
[1:17:59] wants to give you mercy tonight. He
[1:18:02] knows what the judgment's coming.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; But this isn't that tonight. He's still
[1:18:06] on the mercy seat. He's still calling.
[1:18:09] He's still drawing. He's calling you so
[1:18:11] that he can forgive you, that he can
[1:18:13] wrap you in his arms, wash you in his
[1:18:15] forgiveness. And he wants to pour more
[1:18:17] of his life into you so that you can
[1:18:21] progress, so that you can overcome.
[1:18:23] Brother Aaron, I was filled with the
[1:18:24] spirit years ago. That's wonderful. Be
[1:18:26] filled again. Seek more tonight. Lord, I
[1:18:29] listen. I never take people's testimony
[1:18:31] away from them. I never do. If they say,
[1:18:33] "Brother Aaron, I thought I I thought I
[1:18:35] had it, but then I did this." That don't
[1:18:37] mean go back and say, "I didn't have
[1:18:38] nothing." Just say, "Lord, thank you for
[1:18:40] what you did, but tonight I need more.
[1:18:43] Lord, thank you for what you've done in
[1:18:44] the past, but tonight I need a
[1:18:46] refilling. Thank you for that, but I
[1:18:47] need another step, Lord. I'm struggling
[1:18:49] in this area of my life. Pour out more
[1:18:51] tonight, Lord, and fill me fresh and a
[1:18:54] new once again.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; It's our only hope, and it's our only
[1:18:59] approach. It's our only way to overcome.
[1:19:02] It's our only way to rapture is through
[1:19:04] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; It's the only thing. The life of that
[1:19:08] blood coming back on us is the only
[1:19:11] thing that'll take you out of here. He
[1:19:13] says here, "And God provided an approach
[1:19:15] there for Adam in the Garden of Eden and
[1:19:17] through the shedding of the blood of the
[1:19:19] innocent to appropriate an approach to
[1:19:21] him. Then Adam could once more come
[1:19:24] through the shed blood of the lamb to
[1:19:26] the approach and talk face to face again
[1:19:29] with God through the blood through the
[1:19:32] approach that God provided for him."
[1:19:36] Amen. Now, notice the shedding of blood
[1:19:38] brought Adam back in fellowship to talk
[1:19:42] face to face with God once again. That
[1:19:45] was the whole point originally,
[1:19:46] relationship, fellowship. God's bringing
[1:19:49] that back around. And that's what he
[1:19:50] wants once again in this day. He wants
[1:19:52] the life of that blood to come into you
[1:19:54] and to restore fellowship and
[1:19:56] relationship with you and God.
[1:20:00] But too many times
[1:20:02] instead of the life of that blood, we
[1:20:04] begin hiding behind our religion.
[1:20:07] And we actually get comfortable there in
[1:20:09] our religion. And we hide from the
[1:20:11] presence of God so long that it becomes
[1:20:14] the norm for us.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; No fellowship, no worship, no communion.
[1:20:21] I didn't say you wasn't at church.
[1:20:24] I didn't say you didn't tell people you
[1:20:25] was a believer, but no fellowship, no
[1:20:29] worship, no communion, just duty. I'm
[1:20:33] there every Sunday and Wednesday, but do
[1:20:35] you fellowship between Sunday and
[1:20:37] Wednesday? Do you worship when you're
[1:20:40] here? Is there relationship in your
[1:20:42] life? But we feel safe because we come
[1:20:45] to church. We feel hidden and covered
[1:20:47] and wrapped up in the traditions of
[1:20:49] church. But I'm going to tell you
[1:20:51] something and you know this and I know
[1:20:53] this from my own personal experiences.
[1:20:55] There is no victory as a church member.
[1:20:58] There is no overcoming power as a church
[1:21:01] member. Amen. And because you're hidden
[1:21:03] and not exposed,
[1:21:06] then the failures begin to stack up and
[1:21:09] they stay hidden and they grow and they
[1:21:12] compound and you get more issues and
[1:21:14] more bitterness and more coldness.
[1:21:16] Listen,
[1:21:18] he's inviting you tonight to step out
[1:21:20] from behind that covering.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I'm right here and run to
[1:21:24] him with all of your might and try to
[1:21:26] fight to get to him because we got to
[1:21:28] have the power. We got to have God's
[1:21:31] power to transform, not man's power to
[1:21:33] reform. Your reformation will not keep
[1:21:36] you." I'm thankful if you're trying to
[1:21:38] do better. I'm thankful that you're
[1:21:39] trying. Listen, I'm gonna go ahead. I'm
[1:21:41] always open and honest. I tried and
[1:21:42] tried and tried for years and failed and
[1:21:45] failed and failed for years. And I'd
[1:21:47] come to an altar and I'd do good for
[1:21:49] three months. And then I'd come to the
[1:21:50] altar and do good for six months. And
[1:21:52] then sometimes I'd come to the altar and
[1:21:53] do good for a day. But I was trying and
[1:21:55] I wasn't laying things down and I was
[1:21:57] pretending I gave all and I was acting
[1:21:59] the part. But if you ever get to the
[1:22:01] place that you say, "Lord, I'm a
[1:22:02] failure. I'm no good. I'm nothing. And
[1:22:05] without you, I can't make it." and you
[1:22:07] lay it all down and you surrender
[1:22:09] everything and his life comes into your
[1:22:12] life and you experience the new birth.
[1:22:14] Then there's no devil in hell can stop
[1:22:16] you. There's nothing can stand before
[1:22:18] you. There's nothing can keep you from
[1:22:20] overcoming because your nature has been
[1:22:22] changed.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; There's power in the new birth. There's
[1:22:26] no power in being a church member.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would deal with this
[1:22:32] over and over and over again throughout
[1:22:34] his ministry. You can you can just type
[1:22:37] in two words afraid of and go through
[1:22:40] that search. How that humans are always
[1:22:43] afraid and they run from the very thing
[1:22:46] that can bring them salvation. They're
[1:22:48] always afraid of what they need. Three
[1:22:51] scriptures here. One we've read several
[1:22:53] times. I heard thy voice in the garden
[1:22:55] and I was afraid. The voice of God.
[1:22:59] Matthew 14, we'll just read 26. And when
[1:23:01] the disciples saw him walking on the
[1:23:03] sea, they were troubled, saying, "It is
[1:23:05] a spirit." And they cried out in fear.
[1:23:09] And when even was now come, his
[1:23:11] disciples went down into the sea, and
[1:23:13] entered into a ship, and went over the
[1:23:14] sea toward Capernium. And it was now
[1:23:17] dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
[1:23:19] And the sea rose by a great wind that
[1:23:21] blew. And when they had rode about five
[1:23:23] and 20 or 30 furlongs, they see Jesus
[1:23:25] walking on the sea drawing nigh unto the
[1:23:28] ship and they were
[1:23:30] afraid.
[1:23:33] Listen to me. Don't ever let yourself or
[1:23:36] your family or this church become a
[1:23:39] place that is afraid when Jesus comes
[1:23:42] calling.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Afraid when the spirit of God begins to
[1:23:45] move. Listen, I I I know it's something
[1:23:48] that we deal with often and it's not to
[1:23:51] call anybody out. It's not to correct
[1:23:53] other churches or other ministries.
[1:23:55] That's not our job. But as we travel and
[1:23:58] we see certain movements and we see
[1:24:00] certain spirits trying to creep in and
[1:24:02] and we see ministry going a certain way
[1:24:04] and doctrines begin to take hold and
[1:24:07] what we understand is is that eventually
[1:24:09] you're going to come in contact with it.
[1:24:12] Whether it be through streaming or
[1:24:13] visiting or meetings or whatever or just
[1:24:16] because it's the spirit of the age and
[1:24:18] spirits aren't contained by walls.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of the age to be okay
[1:24:23] with being a church member and not going
[1:24:26] all the way to the new birth.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of the age and it's a
[1:24:30] spirit that moves exactly like those
[1:24:33] denominational spirits that operates
[1:24:35] under the guise of protecting you. Every
[1:24:39] denomination that was ever formed formed
[1:24:41] to protect the word of truth they had.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; And they formed and said, "We're we got
[1:24:45] to protect this." And they wouldn't move
[1:24:47] on.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And we got to protect this. And they
[1:24:49] wouldn't move on. And under the guise of
[1:24:52] protection, walls are built. And they're
[1:24:53] not your protection, but they entrap
[1:24:55] you.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Protect you from fanaticism,
[1:25:00] protect you from being deceived as to
[1:25:02] what the Holy Ghost really is. Well, we
[1:25:05] don't want you to shout and jump and
[1:25:07] dance and and be deceived and think you
[1:25:10] got the Holy Ghost because that's not
[1:25:11] the Holy Ghost. So, in order to protect
[1:25:13] you from that, we're just not going to
[1:25:14] shout and jump and dance.
[1:25:17] Wh What's wrong with it? We're
[1:25:19] protecting you.
[1:25:21] We're protecting you from fanaticism and
[1:25:23] protecting you from worship that is out
[1:25:25] of order. So, we would do away with
[1:25:27] freedom of worship and the moving of the
[1:25:29] spirit to protect you
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; so that you don't get out of order.
[1:25:34] we're going to protect you. And the
[1:25:36] spirit tries to move in and it uses fear
[1:25:39] as a reason to tamp down on the moving
[1:25:41] of the spirit. And it does so to keep
[1:25:43] people from the one thing that can save
[1:25:46] them in this day, the Holy Ghost, the
[1:25:48] new birth, the token. You must have it.
[1:25:51] And in order to get it, you need to be
[1:25:52] in the right atmosphere to receive it.
[1:25:54] And I'm not going to tamp down on
[1:25:56] anything that's going to keep people
[1:25:58] from receiving the new birth.
[1:26:03] But what I'm afraid of is that more and
[1:26:05] more people are just message believers
[1:26:07] and not born again believers
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; hiding behind God sent a prophet covered
[1:26:15] behind by by a belief system no real
[1:26:18] fellowship no real relationship no birth
[1:26:22] and then we see Jesus there in
[1:26:24] Revelation 3 20 and he's standing
[1:26:26] outside the door and he's knocking and
[1:26:29] he's looking for somebody to suffer.
[1:26:31] with him. You ever noticed that? To sit
[1:26:34] down with and fellowship, somebody to
[1:26:37] break bread with, somebody to have a
[1:26:38] relationship with,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; somebody to fellowship with him, but
[1:26:42] they're hiding inside the house with the
[1:26:44] door locked and he isn't welcome. And
[1:26:46] this is a where art thou moment in the
[1:26:49] New Testament.
[1:26:51] Think about it. I You go back to the
[1:26:53] very beginning and you can see him
[1:26:54] running through Eden searching and he's
[1:26:57] saying, "I've done so much. I I I've
[1:26:58] made an Eden out of the chaos. I created
[1:27:01] sons and daughters to fellowship with me
[1:27:03] and to have relationship with me and and
[1:27:05] now they're hiding from me. Where art
[1:27:08] thou? And then he goes through all the
[1:27:10] trouble in this day and restores all the
[1:27:12] truth so that you can have the true new
[1:27:14] birth from the book of Acts. And he's
[1:27:17] done so much and he brought a bride out
[1:27:19] of chaos and he's restored everything
[1:27:21] that was lost. And he brings a people
[1:27:23] back to a place of fellowship. And many
[1:27:25] have abandoned that relationship in that
[1:27:28] true fellowship of the birth for I
[1:27:31] believe the message.
[1:27:33] And they've become ashamed of his
[1:27:35] presence.
[1:27:36] They're ashamed to have him in their
[1:27:38] midst. And so they've locked the door
[1:27:39] and he's having to stand there knocking.
[1:27:42] Where art thou?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Why am I not welcome in your churches?
[1:27:47] They don't want to see him come walking
[1:27:49] on the water. They don't want to see him
[1:27:52] walking up to their ship. They're afraid
[1:27:54] of him as he runs through Satan's Eden
[1:27:56] crying, "Where art thou? Will somebody
[1:27:59] praise me? Will somebody worship? Will
[1:28:01] somebody let me in? Somebody let me
[1:28:04] fellowship?
[1:28:05] Somebody let me have relationship?
[1:28:07] Somebody let me save? Somebody let me
[1:28:10] heal. Somebody let me fill you with my
[1:28:12] precious Holy Spirit. Somebody
[1:28:15] where art thou?"
[1:28:18] Don't be afraid of it. Evening like
[1:28:19] tabernacle.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Jesus walking on the water
[1:28:23] tonight.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, when he begins to move and joy
[1:28:27] breaks out and people's hearts and
[1:28:28] people shout and people dance. That's
[1:28:30] Jesus walking on their water.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; You wasn't in the boat with them. You
[1:28:34] don't know the situation. That boat was
[1:28:37] going under. The sail was broke. But
[1:28:39] Jesus came walking on the water.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; And they're overjoyed. They were saved.
[1:28:43] They were delivered. How dare I rob
[1:28:46] their joy from them?
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Take their shout from them.
[1:28:54] That's Jesus moving on the people. It's
[1:28:57] not out of order. Listen, you're a
[1:28:59] prophet. One night on a storming ocean
[1:29:01] when all hopes was gone and the little
[1:29:02] boat was about to sink, the disciples
[1:29:04] saw Jesus come walking on the water and
[1:29:06] they got scared because they thought he
[1:29:08] was a spirit. Isn't that just like
[1:29:10] people today? He was the only thing that
[1:29:12] could help him. He was their only hope
[1:29:14] and yet they were afraid of him. And
[1:29:17] today, oh listen to me. He says the only
[1:29:20] hope there is today is a thing that
[1:29:23] people are afraid of. That's an old time
[1:29:25] St. Paul's revival and the Bible Holy
[1:29:28] Ghost back again.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Pay close attention to this line. Don't
[1:29:33] think it'll make you misbehave yourself.
[1:29:36] That's the devil's business to keep you
[1:29:39] afraid of Christ.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; But it's the only salvation left for any
[1:29:43] nation is the Lord Jesus and the power
[1:29:46] of his resurrection. But people are
[1:29:47] afraid of it. Oh, but they run and they
[1:29:50] dance. What? Why are you taking up the
[1:29:52] devil's business?
[1:29:57] That's the devil's business. He says,
[1:30:01] he says, "What are they afraid of? The
[1:30:03] new birth. That's the reason we got
[1:30:05] grandchildren in the church. Afraid of
[1:30:07] the new birth. Afraid of the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:09] Afraid of the power of God. Afraid it'll
[1:30:11] make them wash some of the makeup off of
[1:30:13] you or something. That's what's the
[1:30:14] matter. God sent us an old time revival.
[1:30:17] Bring forth the Holy Ghost. And there's
[1:30:19] plenty of it.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; I'm just leaning on the authority of a
[1:30:24] prophet right now. Oh, all of a sudden
[1:30:26] they heard the sound of a rushing mighty
[1:30:27] wind. Here comes the inoculation. He
[1:30:30] inoculated 120 brother. They went into a
[1:30:33] fit.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; They went into a fit when he inoculated
[1:30:42] them. fell out in all kinds of shines.
[1:30:44] They jumped and danced and spoke in
[1:30:46] tongues and run through the streets, but
[1:30:47] they was inoculated. That's why they're
[1:30:49] afraid of. You're afraid of the serum.
[1:30:52] It'll make you act funny, but oh my,
[1:30:55] what a feeling. What a safety it gives
[1:30:57] you when you're inoculated. I just want
[1:30:59] to be inoculated. I just want to have
[1:31:02] the serum in my body, in every fiber of
[1:31:04] my being. If it makes me act like a
[1:31:07] fool, if it makes me act like a drunk, I
[1:31:09] don't care. What a feeling. What a
[1:31:13] feeling to know you're inoculated in
[1:31:15] this day.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:18] Afraid of it.
[1:31:21] I ask again, where are we?
[1:31:24] We've rejected him and accepted theology
[1:31:27] and psychology.
[1:31:29] He made us to be filled with the spirit,
[1:31:31] not filled with theology.
[1:31:34] He made us to move in the winds of the
[1:31:36] spirit. And we're letting old spirits
[1:31:39] and old ideas that the devil's used for
[1:31:42] thousands of years repackage itself as
[1:31:44] message theology and sit it out there
[1:31:47] and we're swallowing it.
[1:31:50] We're allowing it to be preached as the
[1:31:52] truth. Listen, you must be born again
[1:31:57] just like they were on the day of
[1:31:58] Pentecost.
[1:32:00] Jesus himself said, "You must be born
[1:32:03] again. You must be."
[1:32:08] That's the main place the devil's
[1:32:10] attacking this message. Maybe he hasn't
[1:32:12] moved you on the doctrine. Maybe he
[1:32:15] hasn't moved you on the message. Maybe
[1:32:16] you'll stand up for this message with
[1:32:18] all your heart. That's awesome. That's
[1:32:20] commendable.
[1:32:22] But if he can back you off the new
[1:32:24] birth,
[1:32:25] if he can get you right there, then he
[1:32:27] has you in a place that you cannot
[1:32:29] rapture.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Let's be clear. You will not rapture
[1:32:32] without the new birth.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; You will not rapture without the token.
[1:32:36] And you can't get the token outside the
[1:32:37] message. But just because you're in the
[1:32:39] message doesn't mean you got the token.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; It means you got access to it. But he
[1:32:43] needs an honest heart. He needs somebody
[1:32:45] to go, "God, I got to have it. I don't
[1:32:47] care what I got to do, where I got to
[1:32:49] go. I just got to have you tonight, Lord
[1:32:52] Jesus. Hallelujah. It's just like in
[1:32:56] Samuel
[1:32:58] when God said to Samuel, he said to him,
[1:33:00] he said, "Don't worry, Samuel. They
[1:33:01] haven't rejected you. They've rejected
[1:33:04] me. They're not denying the doctrines of
[1:33:06] the message. They're not saying William
[1:33:08] Brandon wasn't a prophet. They're not
[1:33:09] saying those things, but they're
[1:33:11] rejecting the life of Christ."
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; And he can sit there and say to the
[1:33:15] seventh angel, "It's not your fault.
[1:33:18] They're not rejecting you.
[1:33:20] They're rejecting me.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; They're rejecting my life. They're
[1:33:25] rejecting the leadership of the Holy
[1:33:27] Spirit. Prophet of God says they're
[1:33:28] ashamed of the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:30] Spirit. They're ashamed of the moving of
[1:33:32] God's Holy Ghost. They're too classical.
[1:33:34] That makes them join the church. They do
[1:33:36] that because they're afraid of the new
[1:33:39] birth.
[1:33:40] Afraid.
[1:33:42] Where art thou?
[1:33:45] They're hiding behind their religion.
[1:33:47] just another set of religious values and
[1:33:49] message theology. And in that place, we
[1:33:52] feel safer, hidden, covered. But I'm
[1:33:56] telling you tonight, that won't work.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Your religion is no better than anybody
[1:34:02] else's religion.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; The only thing that makes you above
[1:34:05] anybody else is the grace, unmmerited
[1:34:09] grace of God that has given you access
[1:34:11] to the new birth, the baptism of the
[1:34:13] Holy Ghost. And until you receive that,
[1:34:15] brother Aaron, I'm a believer. I said it
[1:34:18] before and I know it sounds harsh, but
[1:34:20] all that does is put you on the same
[1:34:22] level as the devil.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; He is a believer. He's a believer of
[1:34:28] this message.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; There ain't no way you could convince
[1:34:31] him it ain't the truth.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Well, I I believe it with all my heart.
[1:34:36] So does he.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you what's different is
[1:34:40] he has no future. He can't be born
[1:34:42] again. He's going to hell. and he thinks
[1:34:44] he's taking you with him. But I got news
[1:34:46] for him tonight. You are bloodbought.
[1:34:48] You are bloodwashed. You are a
[1:34:50] predestinated seed. You are a seed gene
[1:34:52] of God. That's the difference. You're
[1:34:54] not going to stop at believing. But
[1:34:55] you're going to say, "Lord, I believe
[1:34:57] and I receive and I want everything that
[1:35:00] you have for my life. I'm opening myself
[1:35:02] up tonight with an honest heart saying,
[1:35:04] "Fill me fresh and a new Lord Jesus."
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:12] These quotes kind of shocked me
[1:35:16] because it made me realize it's a lot
[1:35:18] more serious than what we think. It's
[1:35:21] not as simple as, well, they just see it
[1:35:23] different and we're all under the same
[1:35:25] glorious message, so we're all going to
[1:35:26] be there. They all left under Moses's
[1:35:29] message, too, following a pillar of fire
[1:35:31] and they all went through the Red Sea
[1:35:32] and they all ate mana in the wilderness.
[1:35:34] They all looked on the brass serpent and
[1:35:36] they didn't all get there.
[1:35:39] But these quotes,
[1:35:41] I'll just be honest, they were
[1:35:42] mind-blowing to me.
[1:35:45] He says, "Why? He's the same Christ
[1:35:47] yesterday, today, and forever. His power
[1:35:49] cannot fail because he's God. God's
[1:35:51] divine order of the earth, the Holy
[1:35:52] Spirit today is just the same as he
[1:35:55] was." To reject Jehovah was a penalty.
[1:35:58] To reject Jesus was a penalty. And to
[1:36:02] reject this, now what's he talking
[1:36:03] about? What people call fanaticism.
[1:36:07] And what people call foolishness is the
[1:36:11] Holy Ghost.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; He said to speak a word against it would
[1:36:14] never be forgiven in this world to come.
[1:36:16] This right here, it's more of a penalty
[1:36:19] to reject what people call fanaticism.
[1:36:23] To reject the Holy Spirit today than it
[1:36:26] would be to reject Jesus Christ or the
[1:36:29] Father.
[1:36:31] That's right.
[1:36:34] Now, if a man rejected God in the days
[1:36:36] of the fatherhood under Moses and the
[1:36:38] law, well, he was put to death. If he
[1:36:40] disobeyed God, broke his command. When
[1:36:42] Jesus came, he said, "Now, whosoever
[1:36:43] speaks a word against the son of man, it
[1:36:45] shall be forgiven him. But whosoever
[1:36:47] speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will
[1:36:48] never be forgiven him in this world,
[1:36:50] this world or the one to come." So, to
[1:36:52] reject the Holy Spirit tonight is more
[1:36:54] serious than to reject God the Father in
[1:36:56] the days of Moses or to reject Jesus
[1:36:59] Christ when he was walking in flesh.
[1:37:09] Think about that.
[1:37:13] So I say this very solemnly and humbly
[1:37:15] and not to pick on anybody.
[1:37:18] So even
[1:37:20] if you're unsure and you look at people
[1:37:23] the way they worship and the way they
[1:37:24] react and the way they do things in
[1:37:26] service when if I were you even if it's
[1:37:30] not for you I would keep my mouth shut
[1:37:32] about it. That's all That's all I'm
[1:37:34] saying.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; But I would also encourage you to accept
[1:37:39] it.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Accept the jump. No. Accept the shout.
[1:37:43] No. That's the way they're worshiping.
[1:37:45] And if God leads you to do that, great.
[1:37:48] Accept what's making them jump.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Accept what's making them shout.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Except that we're never all going to
[1:37:56] worship the same. This ain't even a
[1:37:57] sermon about worship. It's about
[1:37:59] receiving God when he moved through the
[1:38:01] place. That's what it's about. About
[1:38:04] being open and honest with God when he's
[1:38:06] calling on your heart and drawing you.
[1:38:08] But to stand there and to mock or make
[1:38:11] fun or knock down the moving of the
[1:38:14] spirit is a very serious thing. Brother
[1:38:17] Brandham says he was the word and when
[1:38:19] they rejected him, they rejected the
[1:38:21] word. And when they did reject him, they
[1:38:22] finally crucified him. And that's what
[1:38:24] they done today. rejected the word of
[1:38:25] God and accepted their creeds and has
[1:38:28] crucified publicly before their
[1:38:30] congregation the working of the Holy
[1:38:32] Spirit and they're guilty.
[1:38:35] And I indict them in the name of Jesus
[1:38:39] Christ.
[1:38:41] They mock the praise. They criticize the
[1:38:44] shouting. They criticize the rejoicing.
[1:38:46] They criticize the altar cause. Why?
[1:38:49] They're afraid.
[1:38:51] They're afraid that it might not be him,
[1:38:54] that it might be a workup, that it might
[1:38:56] be an emotion.
[1:38:59] He says, "And today, the Methodists, the
[1:39:00] Baptist, the Luther, the Pentecostal
[1:39:02] everywhere around, if you don't watch
[1:39:03] out, friends, the real cornerstone,
[1:39:05] you'll reject it. And the cornerstone in
[1:39:07] the building of this supernatural house
[1:39:09] is the Holy Spirit. You're afraid of it.
[1:39:12] You're afraid of fanaticism."
[1:39:17] I know we got a lot of old scarecrows in
[1:39:19] mockery. In other words, he says, "I
[1:39:21] know there's a lot of it." I'll just use
[1:39:22] this word, fake.
[1:39:28] I don't think there's anybody in this
[1:39:29] ministry or this church that don't
[1:39:31] acknowledge that.
[1:39:33] There's a lot of it. Fake. I won't use
[1:39:37] the word fake. That's harsh. Emotion.
[1:39:40] Worked up.
[1:39:42] Got excited. You went because they went.
[1:39:45] I read in the Bible where all the ladies
[1:39:48] went because Miriam went. Moses didn't
[1:39:50] have a problem with it. She went and
[1:39:52] says and they all followed her.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; So that's I'm fine. But what I'm saying
[1:39:56] is I understand. But how many of y'all
[1:39:58] are going to refuse a paycheck this week
[1:40:00] because you know there's fake money out
[1:40:02] there.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not taking a $100 bill from you
[1:40:07] because somewhere somebody's got fake
[1:40:09] ones.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; That's stupid.
[1:40:16] I'm not willing to tamp down the ones
[1:40:19] that are fake or emotional or however
[1:40:22] you want to say it because I don't
[1:40:23] criticize people's worship.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Whatever word you want to use, I'm not
[1:40:27] willing to get rid of that and lose the
[1:40:30] real too.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; I ain't willing to do it.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I'll take a little wildfire if it means
[1:40:36] there's some real fire moving in there.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Every single time I'll take it.
[1:40:42] He's trying to give us the token and
[1:40:45] people are worried about the reaction of
[1:40:47] the person receiving the token. He's
[1:40:50] trying to bless and heal and deliver and
[1:40:52] we're worried about how they might act
[1:40:53] when they get healed and blessed and
[1:40:55] delivered. Afraid of what might come
[1:40:57] with it. Afraid of a fake. Afraid of a
[1:40:59] workup.
[1:41:01] Just like when they saw Jesus coming,
[1:41:02] and I'm not going to read the whole
[1:41:03] thing, but straightway Jesus spake unto
[1:41:06] them, saying, "Be of good cheer. It is
[1:41:08] I. Be not afraid." And how many times
[1:41:11] have we seen that? Lives changed, people
[1:41:14] healed, people delivered. And that's God
[1:41:16] saying, "It's me. Oh, that was me. Don't
[1:41:19] be afraid." And yet still there's that
[1:41:21] Peter in the back going, "If it's you.
[1:41:29] I wonder what he was going to do if it
[1:41:30] wasn't him."
[1:41:32] I guess just go back to being afraid. I
[1:41:34] don't know. It's me. It's Jesus. I'm
[1:41:37] walking on water. I'm delivering. I'm
[1:41:40] healing. I'm saving. I'm filling with
[1:41:42] the Holy Ghost. Yeah, but them people
[1:41:44] shout, "Lord, if it's you,"
[1:41:48] they're worried it might not be him.
[1:41:51] He says, "It's me. Look at the lives
[1:41:54] that are being changed. Look at the
[1:41:56] victories."
[1:41:57] But they're afraid of him. Afraid of
[1:41:59] what service might look like if they let
[1:42:01] the people get free.
[1:42:03] I'm afraid of what services look like
[1:42:05] when we don't get free. All right.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid of what life looks like
[1:42:09] without the Holy Spirit.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; All I know is the storm didn't cease
[1:42:13] until he got in the boat.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; So, quit being afraid and say, "Jesus,
[1:42:17] come get in the boat. Come on. I may not
[1:42:20] understand it. I don't know how you're
[1:42:21] walking on water. This is kind of scary.
[1:42:24] I don't know why you're doing what
[1:42:25] you're doing. I don't know why they're
[1:42:26] dancing the way they're dancing. I don't
[1:42:27] know why they're doing all that, but I
[1:42:29] want you in the boat. If it's you, Lord,
[1:42:31] come on in. I want the storms to cease.
[1:42:34] I want a body change. I want a rapture.
[1:42:36] So I will accept you tonight however you
[1:42:39] come to me.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Church, I ain't after a workup.
[1:42:48] I I ain't after a run and a jump with no
[1:42:50] life behind it.
[1:42:53] But I know that that that if it's fake
[1:42:55] or it's a workup or it's just emotion
[1:42:56] that there's some real there, too. And
[1:42:59] the bogus is only there to scare you
[1:43:01] away from the real. And if we tamp down
[1:43:04] and say, "Well, there's no more of
[1:43:05] that." Then you lose the real two.
[1:43:08] He says, "We're stopping too much for
[1:43:10] little social things. We're stopping too
[1:43:12] much intolerant with the world. We're
[1:43:14] stopping too much.
[1:43:17] We're stopping too much to see if we
[1:43:19] don't get a little too fanatically.
[1:43:22] I'm scared of He says, I love this
[1:43:25] quote. I'm more scared. I'm more afraid
[1:43:28] of a person that's afraid
[1:43:31] than I am the person that's a fanatic.
[1:43:35] I'm more afraid of the person that's
[1:43:37] afraid
[1:43:38] than I am the person that's a fanatic.
[1:43:40] That's right. I'd rather have a little
[1:43:42] wildfire than no fire at all. Sure, I
[1:43:44] would. I'd rather be around a fire
[1:43:46] that's popping and jumping anytime if
[1:43:49] the world's cold. Why would he say that?
[1:43:52] I'm more afraid of the people that are
[1:43:53] afraid. Why? because he knew what people
[1:43:56] who are afraid would do with worship.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; He knew what people who were afraid
[1:44:00] would do. They'll go formal and they'll
[1:44:02] attack worship and they'll try to return
[1:44:04] it to a box, a denominational box that
[1:44:07] is dead.
[1:44:09] And he knows that they'll try to control
[1:44:11] it. Listen, I want the fire of God to
[1:44:14] burn through this place every single
[1:44:17] service. And if that means a little
[1:44:18] wildfire breaks out in here, so be it.
[1:44:21] We'll deal with that. But I'm not going
[1:44:22] to put out the fire of God. I can study
[1:44:25] the church down through the Bible and
[1:44:27] see what happens when there's no fire.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; I can look at churches around the
[1:44:31] country and see what happens when
[1:44:32] there's no fire. I can read the Bible
[1:44:35] and see what happens when there's no
[1:44:37] fire. People aren't changed. The church
[1:44:39] becomes a habitation of every unclean
[1:44:41] and hateful bird. Demons go unchecked.
[1:44:44] But I can also see what happens when the
[1:44:47] fire of God's in the place. Brother
[1:44:49] Brandham says when God shows up, he
[1:44:50] usually shows up in fire.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; So I see when the lions tried to eat
[1:44:54] Daniel, the fire held him back. When the
[1:44:56] Red Sea tried to stop the children of
[1:44:58] Israel, the pillar of fire parted it.
[1:45:00] When they tried to burn up the three
[1:45:02] huboo children, the fire of God came in
[1:45:05] and pushed back the fire of the enemy.
[1:45:06] Why? My God is a consuming fire. I want
[1:45:10] him to consume this place. I'm not
[1:45:13] afraid of wildfire, but I'll tell you
[1:45:14] what, animals are afraid of the fire.
[1:45:16] Demons are afraid of the fire. Sickness
[1:45:18] is afraid of the fire. Your trouble
[1:45:20] tonight is afraid of the fire. I say,
[1:45:23] "Welcome the fire of God. Don't run from
[1:45:25] it. Don't be afraid of it. Say, "Pour it
[1:45:27] out, Lord. Let your fire consume me
[1:45:31] tonight. Consume this congregation."
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say, "Brother Aaron, I've
[1:45:38] drifted and I'm cold. I'm going the
[1:45:42] wrong way." that same fire
[1:45:46] met Saul on the road down to Damascus.
[1:45:51] And in a moment coming in contact with
[1:45:54] that fire, he went from a persecutor
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; to an apostle.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; He went from one going to try to kill
[1:46:01] the gospel to the first messenger of the
[1:46:03] age. One moment in his presence can
[1:46:06] change your life forever.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Aaron? I'm
[1:46:09] saying run to him tonight with all your
[1:46:11] heart. Don't run from that fire. Don't
[1:46:13] run from that voice calling you tonight.
[1:46:15] Where art thou? Run to him with
[1:46:17] everything you've got. Fight to get to
[1:46:19] him. Push through every hindrance. Run
[1:46:22] through every complex. Run through every
[1:46:24] besetting sin tonight. And say, "I got
[1:46:26] to get to Jesus. Where art thou? I'm
[1:46:28] right here, Lord. I'm right here. And I
[1:46:30] recognize I need you."
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Let him in your boat tonight.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; You want victory in your life? Let him
[1:46:38] in your boat tonight.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:41] I'm closing.
[1:46:44] Brother Brown says, "Someone said not
[1:46:45] long ago, I'm afraid to receive the Holy
[1:46:47] Ghost. I'm afraid it would make me speak
[1:46:49] in tonesues like them others. I don't
[1:46:51] care if I spoke in tonesues, talk in
[1:46:52] tones, crowed in tonesues,
[1:46:55] or anything else. I want the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:58] That's the main principle. I don't care
[1:47:00] what level it is. I'll meet God on his
[1:47:02] level. What he wants to say is right.
[1:47:05] There's where I want to stand. The new
[1:47:07] birth that changes a man, changes a
[1:47:10] woman, changes their desires, changes
[1:47:12] their appetites.
[1:47:14] We can't keep it from the people. We
[1:47:17] can't encourage them to hide from it.
[1:47:20] We've got to fan the flames.
[1:47:22] Musicians, you can come.
[1:47:25] Just want to read this last quote to
[1:47:26] you.
[1:47:28] It's so powerful when you go through the
[1:47:29] message of the hour and recognize where
[1:47:31] he stood on these things. These aren't
[1:47:33] our opinions at Evening Like Tabernacle.
[1:47:37] He says, 'We've bound the Holy Spirit
[1:47:39] with our organizations and traditions.
[1:47:41] We can't have Holy Ghost revival. I know
[1:47:44] that's scorching hot with the weather,
[1:47:45] but it's the truth. How can we have a
[1:47:47] Holy Ghost revival when you're so bound
[1:47:49] and starchy? Form of godliness. The
[1:47:51] Bible said they have form of godliness,
[1:47:53] but deny the power thereof. The power of
[1:47:55] what? The power of the organization, the
[1:47:57] power of the world, the power of the
[1:47:58] church, the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:01] That's the secret place in the church.
[1:48:03] And when the church adopts educated
[1:48:04] preachers, big buildings and finery
[1:48:06] instead of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost,
[1:48:08] they better be in the mission again.
[1:48:10] Amen. Truth. How you going to have a
[1:48:12] revival of the Holy Ghost and people
[1:48:14] quench it and bound it and are afraid of
[1:48:16] it? That's where the trouble lies. The
[1:48:19] Philistines is on thee. But the one
[1:48:22] blessed hope we have. While Samson was
[1:48:24] in jail, here's the only hope that I
[1:48:26] have this morning to wind up my message
[1:48:29] is this. While Samson was bound, a new
[1:48:32] shock of hair grow out.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; God sent us another church just before
[1:48:36] the end time that the power of the Holy
[1:48:38] Ghost can come into her
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; in the denomination in the
[1:48:42] demonstrations of the spirit. Mark 16
[1:48:44] can follow the church. Acts 2:4, Acts
[1:48:46] 2:38, all of it will be following right
[1:48:48] along with the church. Signs, wonders
[1:48:50] accompany the apostles. Great signs of
[1:48:52] his resurrection accompany them. while
[1:48:54] we're in prison. Surely God's growing a
[1:48:57] crop somewhere for the last great kill.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, what's he talking about right there?
[1:49:03] In Samson's death,
[1:49:06] he took out more Philistines than he did
[1:49:07] in his whole life.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; He's saying there's going to be one more
[1:49:11] kill. Every devil of hell has been
[1:49:13] gathered into Leodysia. And Satan thinks
[1:49:16] it's for your destruction. And he says,
[1:49:18] "I got a church. I got a crop. I got a
[1:49:20] people." They're not afraid of the Holy
[1:49:22] Spirit. They're not running from it, but
[1:49:24] they're embracing it. And they're here
[1:49:26] for the final kill. We're taking them
[1:49:28] out. We're taking them out. We're
[1:49:31] leaving here with every devil defeated,
[1:49:33] every devil under our feet. We will
[1:49:35] conquer more devils in our departure
[1:49:38] than we did the whole time we were here.
[1:49:41] We're at the point of the last great
[1:49:44] kill.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, run to him tonight with all of your
[1:49:47] heart.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm right here, Lord.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not hiding from you,
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Lord. I've failed. I've struggled. I've
[1:49:53] got bitterness. I've got unforgiveness.
[1:49:55] But I'm laying that aside and I'm
[1:49:56] saying, "It's me, Lord.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; It's me standing in the need of prayer.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Where art thou?
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Where art thou? You're going to ignore
[1:50:05] him? You're going to hide from me? Or
[1:50:07] you just going to acknowledge, I'm right
[1:50:08] here?
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm right here.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; And I know you're the only one that can
[1:50:14] help me.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; You're the only one that can save me.
[1:50:17] You're the only one that can deliver me.
[1:50:19] Father, Lord, we're not going to hide
[1:50:22] from you. We're not going to make
[1:50:24] excuses, Lord. Lord, but we're just
[1:50:26] standing here tonight going, "Lord, we
[1:50:28] need you, Lord. I'm not hiding in the
[1:50:30] garden no more. I'm not hiding behind
[1:50:32] religion. I'm not hiding behind I
[1:50:34] believe this message, but Lord, I got to
[1:50:37] have you.
[1:50:39] Lord, I've stumbled. I got to have you.
[1:50:41] I've failed. I got to have you. Lord,
[1:50:44] I've come short. I got to have you. I'm
[1:50:47] not going to hide and let this build and
[1:50:49] compound and get worse and worse and
[1:50:50] worse. I'm here right now saying, "Lord,
[1:50:54] it's me. You called and I've answered.
[1:50:58] Where art thou? I'm right here, Lord.
[1:51:01] I'm right here." What's he calling you
[1:51:03] for? To judge you? No. Just to wrap you
[1:51:07] in his forgiveness.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Just to say, "I love you. I made you for
[1:51:12] relationship. And all I'm trying to do
[1:51:13] is bring you back into relationship. All
[1:51:15] I'm trying to do is bringing you back
[1:51:16] into fellowship. All I'm doing tonight
[1:51:19] saying, "Come back. My arms are open. I
[1:51:21] got a bloody lamb. I'm going to wrap you
[1:51:24] in the robe of righteousness. I'm going
[1:51:25] to trade your sins for my righteousness.
[1:51:28] I'm going to fill you with the spirit.
[1:51:29] I'm going to refill you. I'm going to
[1:51:31] pick you up where you fell down. Oh,
[1:51:32] hallelujah. Quit listening to the devil.
[1:51:34] You're not defeated. You're not
[1:51:36] defeated.
[1:51:38] Just get up.
[1:51:40] I'm going to tell you right now. I've
[1:51:41] said it before, but I just feel it right
[1:51:43] now. Nobody remembers that fighter
[1:51:46] getting punched in the seventh round.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; They remember who won.
[1:51:51] They remember whose hand was raised.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. And I got punched. I got
[1:51:56] knocked down. I got hit in the first
[1:51:57] round, second round, third round, fourth
[1:51:58] round. I keep getting hit. Oh, praise
[1:52:00] the Lord. But you keep getting up. You
[1:52:02] keep coming back to the middle of the
[1:52:04] ring. You keep answering the bell. Why?
[1:52:06] You're called to overcome. I don't
[1:52:09] remember who got punched. I remember who
[1:52:11] the champion is. I remember who won the
[1:52:13] fight. Who's the winner? You are the
[1:52:16] winner. You're the overcomer of the age.
[1:52:19] You're called. You're chosen. You're
[1:52:21] forgiven. And you're going to rapture.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Quit listening to the lie of the devil.
[1:52:26] Oh, I can't make it. You're going to
[1:52:27] make it. You're going to be there. You
[1:52:29] and your offspring with you. Just press
[1:52:32] the battle. Fight to get to him. He's
[1:52:35] calling you tonight. What's he calling
[1:52:37] me to? Relationship. You mean he doesn't
[1:52:40] He's not calling me cuz he's angry. No,
[1:52:43] he knows where you're at. He knows what
[1:52:44] you did. He knows your struggle. He's
[1:52:46] calling you cuz you're a free moral
[1:52:48] agent. You got to be willing to say,
[1:52:50] "I'm right here, Lord."
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Yeah, you are. I knew
[1:52:54] where you were.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; I just wanted you to love me.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; I just wanted you to fellowship. I just
[1:53:01] want to love you tonight."
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Church, keep pressing the battle. Have
[1:53:05] an honest heart. Be open with God. And
[1:53:08] don't be hindered by your own failures
[1:53:10] and fears and complexes. God loved you
[1:53:13] and died for you knowing those things.
[1:53:16] He knew every mess up. He knew every
[1:53:19] failure. And he said, "Yeah, that one's
[1:53:22] mine.
[1:53:23] That one.
[1:53:26] That one."
[1:53:28] Do you see how often he messes up? Yeah.
[1:53:31] He's going to need some mighty strong
[1:53:32] blood.
[1:53:34] But I know somebody.
[1:53:37] There's a lamb slain before the
[1:53:38] foundation of the world for me in my
[1:53:42] mess up and my failures. And tonight he
[1:53:46] says, "What sin? What sin?
[1:53:50] Where art thou?" I can tell you where
[1:53:52] I'm at. I'm in the Lamb's book of life.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; That's where I see myself tonight. I see
[1:53:59] myself in eternity. I know one thing I
[1:54:02] don't see. I don't see myself going
[1:54:03] down. I don't see myself giving up.
[1:54:06] Where art thou even like tabernacle?
[1:54:08] We're right here. We're still standing.
[1:54:10] We're still fighting. We are the victors
[1:54:12] of the age. Hallelujah. Blessed be the
[1:54:16] name of the Lord. God bless you tonight.
[1:54:21] You alone are all I need.
[1:54:29] For you are my

[1:54:42] I need.

[2:06:49] And what's the message to the church at
[2:06:51] this age?
[2:06:55] Quickly.
[2:06:58] And God said, "That's a man after my own
[2:07:01] heart."
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; I mean, David was loaded. He did not
[2:07:05] have the Holy Ghost, friends. We do. And
[2:07:08] God said, "That's a man after my own
[2:07:10] heart." Because he turned completely.
[2:07:13] Amen. May we be that kind of people.
[2:07:15] Amen. Have a wonderful week. We'll see
