[21:10] ask for prayer also remember Sister
[21:13] Margaret Coleman as well as Sister
[21:15] Barbara Whistler they're both in a care
[21:17] facility both of them very frail and
[21:20] fragile
[21:22] condition amen but I know the Lord knows
[21:25] their heart I know they would love to be
[21:28] here
[21:29] tonight amen let's just pray that the
[21:31] Lord would surround them where they are
[21:33] and any others that are shut in tonight
[21:35] sick tonight maybe streaming at home and
[21:38] their heart's desire is to be here I
[21:40] believe God can meet that desire if you
[21:42] have a need you want to lift to the Lord
[21:44] as brother Tim comes let's go to him in
[21:49] prayer praise the Lord and good to be in
[21:52] the house of the Lord tonight I want to
[21:54] say thank you for praying for me while I
[21:56] was away and um was just come back home
[22:00] from brother Ron
[22:02] Spencer's and um you know I
[22:05] I did something that
[22:09] um that was reminiscent to me of what
[22:12] happened with brother Kenneth
[22:15] Middleton some years
[22:18] back he had got a report from a doctor
[22:21] that there was nothing more they could
[22:23] do for him no more operations no more
[22:25] stance no more no more anything that it
[22:29] was end of life and they couldn't help
[22:30] him
[22:32] anymore and he was there in the hospital
[22:35] and in uh pretty Dar streets at that
[22:38] moment in time
[22:41] and I was praying about it in the
[22:44] morning and ask the Lord God you're
[22:48] going to have to do something you're
[22:50] going to have to do something I mean
[22:51] doctors can't do anything more and if
[22:54] you don't do something he's going to
[22:56] die and so Lord I you know we're we're
[23:00] at a that moment you're going to have to
[23:02] move and God spoke back to me so clearly
[23:06] said I've already done my part you go do
[23:09] yours I went and laid hands on him and
[23:11] prayed for him he lived three or four
[23:13] more years after that God extended his
[23:18] life and you know when we speak about
[23:21] brother Ron I just want you to
[23:23] understand you know the doctors have
[23:25] given a new report on him they found
[23:28] cancer in both eyes that they believe is
[23:30] coming
[23:31] from somewhere in his perhaps from his
[23:34] brain and and maybe something active
[23:37] there there's further tests that are
[23:40] coming and so on like that but you know
[23:42] while I was there he walked two miles on
[23:45] a
[23:46] treadmill while I was there we had a
[23:50] great great time fellowshipping and and
[23:53] enjoying one another's company brother
[23:55] Donnie Reagan as you know came over and
[23:58] and encouraged him and helped him too
[24:03] and it was really good that I went
[24:04] because no sooner then I got there he
[24:07] got a phone call telling him about his
[24:09] situation and so I was right there with
[24:12] him during those times to just try to
[24:15] give him comfort and consolation just a
[24:18] buddy to be with
[24:19] him and um God willing they're going to
[24:22] mark off something on their bucket list
[24:24] they're going to do this this next
[24:27] weekend and go away for a cruise and I
[24:30] think he plans to preach Saturday night
[24:32] and then leave Sunday morning to to go
[24:34] away for little Cru so you know he is
[24:39] he's continuing to fight the fight of
[24:42] faith and believe the Word of Promise
[24:45] he's continuing to put faith into
[24:48] action and that's what we have to do in
[24:51] these times we just can't lay down and
[24:53] quit amen we're looking for the
[24:56] miraculous and I I believe God is moving
[24:59] I believe he's moving around the world I
[25:02] believe that prayers are being answered
[25:04] in fact the matter is while the mass
[25:06] prayer went forth um they took brother
[25:09] Ron's little granddaughter Zoe back to
[25:11] the to the allergist because of a whole
[25:14] list of problems that she was having and
[25:17] he declared her allergy free it wasn't
[25:20] even a need for it we heard from others
[25:22] that wrote in said brother Tim uh you
[25:26] know as you prayed as you prayed there I
[25:29] was listening on the internet and God
[25:32] healed me of a generational curse that
[25:35] had been on my life and brought her
[25:37] Deliverance so I believe there were many
[25:39] many things that was done I believe
[25:41] God's doing some things and I believe he
[25:43] wants to do something for us tonight
[25:46] brother Aaron and sister Lydia are going
[25:48] over to North Carolina so they've left
[25:50] already traveling that way for meetings

[44:41] amen
[44:42] amen God bless you tonight let's turn to
[44:45] Romans chapter 4 and verse
[44:50] 19
[44:54] amen don't think I think it's
[44:56] coincidence that we sang that song right
[44:58] there at the end as I was s just bowing
[45:01] my head to pray and caught what's
[45:04] highlighted here in the
[45:06] scripture I just had to say wow amen
[45:10] Romans 4: 19 and being not weak in faith
[45:14] he considered not his own body now dead
[45:17] when he was about a hundred years old
[45:19] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[45:22] and he staggered not at the promise of
[45:25] God through unbelief but was strong in
[45:28] the faith giving glory to God to God be
[45:32] the glory giving glory to God and being
[45:35] fully persuaded that what he had
[45:37] promised he was also able to perform
[45:41] amen God bless you you can be
[45:44] seated amen I just want to thank you for
[45:47] your prayers for me while I was away and
[45:51] and also since I've been back um I'll
[45:54] I'll maybe show some things things on
[45:56] Sunday of the trip I was going to do it
[45:57] tonight but for time's sake we'll wait
[46:00] till Sunday maybe to show a little bit
[46:02] there and uh but God did some wonderful
[46:05] things and some great things we we'll
[46:08] say we had about 450 or so 500 young
[46:12] people and and elders and different ones
[46:14] pastors that that gathered together and
[46:17] and came together there in Uganda and
[46:20] and God moved very wonderfully and very
[46:22] Mighty mightily and we thank him there's
[46:24] so many testimoni and things that are
[46:26] coming from those meetings and a lot of
[46:29] strength that came from them and they're
[46:31] giving all the glory unto God and and so
[46:34] then we come back of course sick in our
[46:35] body we actually started feeling some
[46:37] things as we were leaving there and you
[46:40] know they just eat different food and
[46:42] drink different things and as far as
[46:44] their water stuff in it things like that
[46:46] try to stay away from different things
[46:47] as much as you can but but uh it still
[46:50] gets to you somehow maybe it comes
[46:51] through your skin I don't know how it
[46:53] gets to you but anyway you got sick in
[46:55] your your body and so Saturday we was
[46:57] just really really sick and and then
[47:00] Sunday it just turned right around and
[47:02] my we sure enjoyed even though we'd Lov
[47:05] to have been here we sure enjoyed the
[47:07] service that we heard that that God came
[47:09] down and moved Among Us and amen I I
[47:12] believe there is power in the atmosphere
[47:15] amen and I I believe we need to fight
[47:17] for the right atmosphere in every
[47:19] service Amen to go that God can have the
[47:21] glory and the honor and uh actually uh
[47:25] I'd like to speak tonight on on the
[47:27] expression of Faith the expression of
[47:30] faith and I I just want to read the
[47:31] scripture again and Abra speaking of
[47:34] Abraham and being not weak in faith he
[47:36] considered not his own body now dead
[47:40] when he was about a hundred years old
[47:42] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[47:45] but he staggered not at the promises of
[47:47] God through unbelief but was strong in
[47:50] the faith giving glory to God and being
[47:54] fully persuaded that what he promised he
[47:56] was able also to perform you know as
[47:59] Believers we start out in faith believe
[48:02] in God's promise but we don't want to
[48:04] just start in faith but we want to stay
[48:07] in faith amen but we must stay in faith
[48:11] and stand in faith until the answer is
[48:14] manifested you know Abraham believed
[48:16] God's promise and stayed there until it
[48:18] manifested it wasn't easy it wasn't
[48:21] quick you know it took 25 years or more
[48:24] or so around there it was a battle but
[48:26] while he waited he glorified God Amen
[48:30] while he waited he praised him and
[48:32] thanked him as if it was already done he
[48:35] praised God for the promise instead of
[48:38] just praising God for the progress amen
[48:41] so many times we want to praise him when
[48:43] we see progress you know we see a a
[48:46] better doctor's report or we see uh the
[48:49] symptoms going away or we then we can
[48:51] want to praise God but God Abraham did
[48:53] not praise God for the progress he
[48:56] didn't see any progress 25 years later
[48:58] there was no progress as we read there
[49:00] was still the deadness of his own body
[49:03] and the deadness of Sarah's womb but
[49:05] amen he praised God Amen for the promise
[49:08] and that's what we as Believers have to
[49:10] do we we're not looking at progress and
[49:12] whether it's happening or whether it
[49:14] isn't happening whether it's getting
[49:15] better or it isn't getting better
[49:17] whether symptoms are leaving or they're
[49:19] not leaving amen I'm not looking at that
[49:22] that's not why I'm praising God I'm
[49:24] praising God cuz he gave the promise and
[49:26] he's able to perform that which he says
[49:29] amen amen we you know we see a change in
[49:32] a in a situation and then we'll praise
[49:34] him but AB Abraham didn't consider what
[49:37] he saw he what he saw was the deadness
[49:39] of Sarah's womb what he saw was his own
[49:42] failures and his own mistakes what he
[49:45] saw was his own body getting older day
[49:48] by day but he continued to give God
[49:51] glory and he maintained or expressed
[49:54] that Faith by by Praise amen that praise
[49:57] amen not not not not speaking of his
[50:01] circumstances or speaking of his issues
[50:03] or or speaking of the situation around
[50:06] him now we can go through hundreds of
[50:07] quotes brother brandham used Abraham
[50:09] many times in in his in his ministry of
[50:12] how he would come to Sarah and he said
[50:14] do you feel any different well praise
[50:16] God it doesn't matter anyhow to be a big
[50:18] bigger miracle today that it was
[50:20] yesterday amen what was he doing he was
[50:22] not praising amen the progress or what
[50:25] was happening there in his sight or what
[50:27] he could see but he was going back to
[50:30] what God had spoke and what God had
[50:32] promised and I believe that's somewhere
[50:34] we can stand here tonight that that no
[50:36] matter what we see or what's going on
[50:38] around us this bride now is 2,000 years
[50:41] old and seem like things are going a
[50:43] little bit further a little bit longer
[50:46] than we expected but that doesn't matter
[50:48] amen what matters is God made the
[50:50] promise that he wouldn't leave us that
[50:52] he wouldn't forsake us that he would
[50:54] change our bodies amen God made that
[50:56] promise therefore we can praise the
[50:59] promise and not the progress amen you
[51:01] know Philippians 4 said rejoice in the
[51:04] lord always amen you know I like the way
[51:07] it says that it says rejoice in the lord
[51:10] always it doesn't say rejoice in the
[51:12] Lord when things are going good and when
[51:15] amen the progress report is right and
[51:17] the doctor's report is right and
[51:19] everything's Rosy and everything's great
[51:21] it says rejoice in the lord always in
[51:25] another words take pleasure in him
[51:27] Delight in him and again I say rejoice
[51:30] the same word is in Psalms 37 and ver4
[51:33] we're going to go through quite a few
[51:34] scriptures tonight delight yourself in
[51:37] the Lord and He will give you the
[51:39] desires or the petitions of your heart
[51:42] so as you praise him God will give amen
[51:45] the Praises go up and the glory comes
[51:47] down amen the Praises amen leaves your
[51:51] lips and many times you don't feel like
[51:53] praising him but that doesn't matter
[51:55] many many times you don't act like
[51:56] things around you the circumstances are
[51:59] are not circumstances that that that you
[52:01] know would would make you want to praise
[52:03] or make you want to uh thank God or make
[52:06] you want to give all you got but that
[52:08] doesn't matter amen what matters is you
[52:10] praise Him anyhow and you lift your
[52:13] voice and and you give him glory and you
[52:16] give him honor Amen in verse 5 in
[52:18] Philippians 4 it says let your Gentle
[52:20] Spirit be known into all people for the
[52:23] Lord is near don't be anxious or worried
[52:26] about anything but in everything and by
[52:29] prayer and petition with
[52:33] Thanksgiving amen not just prayer but
[52:37] prayer with
[52:38] Thanksgiving amen not just asking but
[52:41] saying God you're great not just asking
[52:45] to be healed but saying God I want to
[52:47] thank you for my healing not just asking
[52:50] that your child will come home but I
[52:52] want to thank you that they're on their
[52:53] way I may not see the progress I might
[52:56] not see things moving it doesn't matter
[52:59] what matters is you gave me the promise
[53:01] and I'm going to praise the promise amen
[53:03] the and said continue to make your
[53:06] request known unto God and then the
[53:09] peace of God Amen was transcends all
[53:13] understanding that peace which stands
[53:15] guard over your heart and your mind in
[53:17] Christ Jesus it is yours amen he said in
[53:20] John 14 verse 27 the peace that I Leave
[53:24] You my perfect peace I give unto you not
[53:27] as the world gives do I give it to you
[53:30] let not your heart be troubled nor Let
[53:32] It Be Afraid let my perfect peace calm
[53:36] you in every
[53:39] circumstance Hallelujah and if you want
[53:41] this peace then you got to praise
[53:44] Him hallelujah amen because you can
[53:47] Praise Him it doesn't matter what a
[53:49] doctor says it doesn't matter what
[53:51] somebody else says it doesn't matter
[53:53] what your own mind says it doesn't
[53:56] matter what's going on around you you
[53:58] can praise him and have peace there's
[54:01] peace that'll guard your heart and and
[54:03] and and make a Garrison around it amen
[54:05] will calm you in every circumstance and
[54:08] this peace will encourage you and
[54:10] strengthen you for every challenge I
[54:12] want to go through some Amplified and
[54:14] they can follow if they they want to in
[54:16] Proverbs 14 and verse 26 it says in the
[54:19] reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord
[54:23] there is a strong confidence
[54:27] Hallelujah in the reverent and
[54:30] worshipful worshipful fear of the Lord
[54:34] there is a strong confidence and his
[54:37] children shall always have a place of
[54:45] Refuge Hallelujah that no matter what
[54:48] you're facing you're still in the
[54:51] Refuge no matter what you're going
[54:53] through you're still at peace no matter
[54:56] what it's happen cuz this peace is not a
[54:58] peace that the world gives cuz if it's a
[55:01] peace that the world gives then the
[55:03] world can take it away amen the world
[55:05] gives you peace by offering a peaceful
[55:08] climate or offering a peaceful Nations
[55:10] and and we're not at war no more that
[55:12] can be just that can last just so long
[55:15] amen but what happens when the world
[55:16] gives peace the world can also take away
[55:19] peace but if God gives you peace then
[55:22] the world can't take it away so it
[55:24] doesn't matter what's going on around
[55:26] you or all the issues or the trouble you
[55:28] can still be at peace there can be a
[55:31] refuge you can go into in the time of
[55:34] trouble right oh and another one in
[55:38] Psalms 108 verse1 he says oh God my
[55:41] heart is fixed in other words it's
[55:44] steadfast in the confidence of faith I
[55:48] will
[55:49] sing yes I will give
[55:51] Praises even with my glory all the
[55:55] faculties and powers of the one created
[55:57] in your in in your image so again it's
[56:01] the faith and Praises are mixed together
[56:05] they're tied together amen praises and
[56:07] Faith are tied together the UN Psalms 64
[56:11] and10 the
[56:13] uncompromisingly righteous shall be glad
[56:16] in the Lord and shall trust and take
[56:19] refuge in him and all the upright in
[56:22] heart shall glory and offer praise in
[56:25] other words the righteous the faithful
[56:27] shall be glad in the Lord and shall
[56:30] trust in him and offer up praise in
[56:33] Psalms 40 and verse three and he hath
[56:36] put a new song in my mouth it is a song
[56:38] of praise to our God many shall see and
[56:42] fear and put their trust and confidence
[56:46] and Reliance in the
[56:48] Lord that's right Hallelujah in Psalms 5
[56:52] and verse 11 let all those who take
[56:55] refuge and put their trust in you
[56:57] rejoice let them ever sing and shout for
[57:01] Joy because you make a covering over
[57:03] them and defend them let those who love
[57:06] your name be joyful in you and be in
[57:09] High
[57:13] Spirits maybe I need to read that one
[57:16] more time hang on just a
[57:23] minute Hallelujah
[57:25] let those who take refuge and put their
[57:29] trust Faith their trust their faith in
[57:34] you
[57:35] rejoice let them ever sing and shout for
[57:39] Joy because you make a covering over
[57:42] them and defend
[57:45] them Hallelujah and you defend them let
[57:49] those also who love your name be joyful
[57:52] in you and be in high my
[57:56] [Applause]
[57:57] spirits cuz the spirit that we have
[58:00] received is not of this world therefore
[58:03] is not dictated by what this world says
[58:06] or what this world does or the
[58:08] atmosphere this world has this Spirit
[58:10] comes from
[58:12] above Hallelujah therefore you can be in
[58:15] High Spirits in hard
[58:18] times you can rejoice in the hardest of
[58:21] the difficult of circumstances when you
[58:24] don't know if it's going to get any B
[58:26] better it does not matter I'm going to
[58:29] praise His promise I'm going to praise
[58:31] His word I'm going to praise a god who's
[58:34] not just able but more than able to
[58:37] fulfill his
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:41] word Psalms 56 and verse 3 and 4 says
[58:45] the time when I am afraid I will have
[58:48] confidence and put my trust and Reliance
[58:51] of You In You by the help of God I will
[58:55] praise His
[58:58] word Hallelujah by the help of God I
[59:01] will praise his word on God I lean and
[59:04] rely and confid confidently put my trust
[59:07] I will not fear for what can man or who
[59:09] is flesh who is flesh that can do unto
[59:12] me and and in Psalm 71 and 5-8 says For
[59:15] You Are My Hope Oh Lord God you are my
[59:18] trust from my youth and the source of my
[59:21] confidence upon you have I learned and
[59:24] relied
[59:25] from birth you are he who took me from
[59:28] my mother's womb and you have been my
[59:30] benefactor from that day my praise is
[59:34] continually of you I am as a wonder and
[59:37] surprise to many but you are my strong
[59:40] Refuge my mouth shall be filled with
[59:43] your praises and your honor all the
[59:51] day Hallelujah now I want to go to to a
[59:54] very famous scripture and one I think is
[59:57] very ought to be one that's I guess I
[1:00:01] don't know how to say it but to the
[1:00:02] bride one that she takes heart in
[1:00:04] because it's the Rapture scripture where
[1:00:06] brother Brandon pulled the Rapture from
[1:00:08] psalms 27 and verse one the Lord is my
[1:00:12] light and my
[1:00:14] salvation Whom Shall I
[1:00:18] Fear come on
[1:00:20] somebody sugar diabetes cancer Devils
[1:00:24] who Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is my
[1:00:28] strength of Life of whom shall I be
[1:00:31] afraid when the wicked even my enemies
[1:00:33] and my foe came to eat my flesh they
[1:00:36] stumbled and fell though a host should
[1:00:39] encamp against me my heart shall not
[1:00:41] fear though War shall rise against me in
[1:00:45] this will I be confident so don't sound
[1:00:48] like a good day for David he's got Wars
[1:00:50] he's got enemies he's got things that's
[1:00:52] trying to make him fear but you can
[1:00:54] still say I'm going to stand I'm going
[1:00:56] to be confident I will not fear cuz one
[1:01:00] thing I have desired of the Lord and I
[1:01:02] will seek after that I may dwell in the
[1:01:04] house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:01:07] life to behold the beauty of the Lord to
[1:01:09] inquire in his Temple for in the time of
[1:01:13] trouble he'll hide me in his Pavilion in
[1:01:16] the secret of his Tabernacle he shall
[1:01:19] hide me and he'll set me upon a rock and
[1:01:22] now shall my head be lifted up above my
[1:01:24] enemies roundabout therefore will I
[1:01:27] offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of
[1:01:31] Joy I will sing and I will sing praises
[1:01:35] unto the Lord so right there with the
[1:01:38] confidence and the won fear and I'm
[1:01:41] going to stand and he's put me on a rock
[1:01:43] I'm going to offer a sacrifice of
[1:01:46] Joy did you catch that a sacrifice of
[1:01:50] Joy just because you made it to his
[1:01:52] Tabernacle doesn't mean it's going to be
[1:01:54] easy to offer up a praise but you have
[1:01:57] to sacrifice something you have to
[1:01:59] sacrifice your pride you got to
[1:02:01] sacrifice what you think you got to
[1:02:03] sacrifice your time you got to sacrifice
[1:02:06] tomorrow or maybe the next day and all
[1:02:08] that let it all go I'm going to praise
[1:02:11] God cuz I have been brought to this
[1:02:14] place the devil's tried to kill me a
[1:02:16] host is encamped about me but God is for
[1:02:20] me who can be against
[1:02:23] me
[1:02:25] hallelujah it's a sacrifice of praise
[1:02:28] it's a sacrifice of
[1:02:32] Joy thank
[1:02:35] you what does a priest do brother BR
[1:02:38] said he said makes a sacrifice it's a
[1:02:41] spiritual sacrifice that's what Sons and
[1:02:43] Daughters do which are Kings and Priests
[1:02:46] they're making sacrifices offering to
[1:02:49] God spiritual sacrifice the fruit of our
[1:02:53] lips giving praise to to him you say
[1:02:55] well I don't feel like praising that's
[1:02:57] the time to make the
[1:03:01] sacrifice that's
[1:03:04] awesome it ain't a sacrifice unless it's
[1:03:07] a
[1:03:09] sacrifice I don't mean to make it stupid
[1:03:11] simple but that's exactly what it is it
[1:03:13] ain't a sacrifice unless it's a
[1:03:16] sacrifice and listen you come on a
[1:03:18] Wednesday night that's a sacrifice but
[1:03:20] don't just come into His Temple and just
[1:03:22] sit here and twidle your thumb
[1:03:24] but say God I want to give you praise
[1:03:27] because I'm still here the devil's been
[1:03:30] after me all week and he's tried to
[1:03:32] torment my mind he tried to come against

[1:05:40] sacrifice of
[1:05:42] praise that's a reaction to what's
[1:05:45] already
[1:05:48] happened but what about praising him

[1:06:16] taught to praise God before they saw the
[1:06:20] answer if isra to be taught that we got
[1:06:22] to be taught that Psalms 106 and verse1
[1:06:26] praise ye the Lord oh give thanks unto
[1:06:28] the Lord for he is good how many can say
[1:06:30] amen for his mercy endureth forever who
[1:06:33] can who can utterly utter the mighty
[1:06:36] acts of the Lord who can show forth all
[1:06:39] his praise I'll just listen to that
[1:06:41] wonderful song on the podcast the half
[1:06:43] hasn't been
[1:06:45] told we can stand here for hours with
[1:06:47] testimonies and I can tell you even what
[1:06:50] I even know from what happened in ugand
[1:06:52] and half still hasn't been told
[1:06:56] this God is a great
[1:06:57] God he's greater than our Humanity he's
[1:07:00] greater than our human thinking and we
[1:07:02] think sometimes that where is the
[1:07:04] Miracles where God's doing them all over
[1:07:06] the place it's only going to be on the
[1:07:08] other side that we truly see Amen in the
[1:07:11] back back parts and the things behind
[1:07:14] the scene and what was going on and how
[1:07:16] Angels were moving and Angels were
[1:07:18] touching and Angels were delivering and
[1:07:20] God was moving when we didn't even
[1:07:22] realize it amen as that song says even
[1:07:24] when I don't see you I know you're
[1:07:26] working cuz you promised it that's his
[1:07:29] [Applause]
[1:07:32] promise blessed are they that keep
[1:07:35] judgment and he that does righteous at
[1:07:37] all times remember me oh Lord with favor
[1:07:40] for thou bearest un thy people visit me
[1:07:42] with thy salvation that I may see the
[1:07:44] good of thy
[1:07:47] chosen yeah that's a good thing Lord I
[1:07:49] want to see the good of thy
[1:07:51] chosen that I may rejoice in the
[1:07:54] gladness of thy nation that I may Glory
[1:07:56] With Thine inheritance we have sinned
[1:07:59] with our fathers we have committed
[1:08:00] iniquity we have done wickedly our
[1:08:02] fathers understood not thy wonders in
[1:08:05] Egypt they remembered not the multitude
[1:08:07] of thy mercies but provoked him at the
[1:08:09] Red Sea yeah even at the Red Sea
[1:08:12] nevertheless he saved them for his
[1:08:14] name's sake that he might make his
[1:08:17] mighty power be known he rebuked the Red
[1:08:19] Sea also and it was dried up so he led
[1:08:23] them through the as through the
[1:08:24] Wilderness and he saved them from the
[1:08:26] hand of him that hated him and redeemed
[1:08:29] them from the hand of the enemy and the
[1:08:31] waters covered their enemies and there
[1:08:33] was not one of them
[1:08:37] then then believe they his words and
[1:08:41] they sang his
[1:08:43] Praises when they saw the dead Egyptians
[1:08:46] I know we love to use that story it's a
[1:08:48] powerful story of maram picking up the
[1:08:50] tambourine and I believe when we see our
[1:08:53] enemies that dead we ought to Rejoice
[1:08:56] but we don't have to wait to see them
[1:08:58] dead before we do Rejoice amen I believe
[1:09:01] what happened why was the tambourine
[1:09:03] before the Red Sea it ought have been
[1:09:04] playing and saying thank you God you
[1:09:07] saved me from being a slave you bringing
[1:09:09] me to a Promised Land it doesn't matter
[1:09:12] what's in my way you'll make a way where
[1:09:14] there seems to be no way but they turn
[1:09:16] to their and if they would have kept
[1:09:18] that praise they would have built a
[1:09:20] throne and the Red Sea would have opened
[1:09:27] but they built they took him off the
[1:09:30] throne and they put their groanings and
[1:09:32] their moanings and their upsets and
[1:09:35] their
[1:09:36] frustrations and all of that and God
[1:09:39] said what what are you doing well wasn't
[1:09:42] there any Graves that we could be buried
[1:09:43] in
[1:09:45] Egypt how quickly they
[1:09:49] forgot let's don't be that kind of
[1:09:52] people we're hear so you got to war
[1:09:54] against that cuz we tend to forget very
[1:09:57] quickly what God has done because why
[1:10:00] why does Satan try to cover that up
[1:10:01] because he knows what God has done God
[1:10:04] will
[1:10:06] do amen and so he he wants you to he
[1:10:09] don't want you to remember all those
[1:10:11] things because if you remember it as
[1:10:13] shamgar did and different ones down
[1:10:15] there they remembered hey I'm a son of
[1:10:18] son of Abraham Isaac and Jacob their God
[1:10:21] is my God he moved on their behalf he'll
[1:10:24] move on my behalf amen he doesn't want
[1:10:26] you to see or remember what God has done
[1:10:29] cuz he knows what God done he does amen
[1:10:31] and when he does it he's powerless
[1:10:34] before him oh Hallelujah but the Red Sea
[1:10:37] open and they picked it up and then when
[1:10:39] they saw all these things then they
[1:10:41] begin to praise
[1:10:43] him oh it's easy it's easy to praise him
[1:10:47] when you get a clean doctor's report
[1:10:50] come on now but what about praising them
[1:10:53] before you
[1:10:55] do it's easy to praise him oh look my
[1:10:59] son's come back look at him he's serving
[1:11:02] God but what about praising him before
[1:11:04] they
[1:11:05] [Applause]
[1:11:07] do come on somebody it's easy to praise
[1:11:10] God when the fever's left and the
[1:11:12] stomach feels better and things are
[1:11:14] happen it's easy to do that but what
[1:11:16] about before they do amen God wants your
[1:11:20] praise before you see the Promise
[1:11:24] fulfilled that is a real sacrifice cuz
[1:11:27] you're sacrificing your own human
[1:11:29] thoughts what will people think how what
[1:11:31] would if it don't happen it ain't up to
[1:11:33] me to make it happen it's up to God to
[1:11:35] fulfill his word and I what it's up to
[1:11:38] me is to praise him until he
[1:11:41] [Applause]
[1:11:45] does they had to see at first to
[1:11:49] believe right before this great Victory
[1:11:52] they were complaining and crying crying
[1:11:53] and moaning and cursing God but when he
[1:11:59] nevertheless oh my God I got to read
[1:12:01] that one again to you I guess cuz some
[1:12:03] of y'all didn't catch
[1:12:07] that our fathers understood not thy
[1:12:10] wonders in Egypt they remembered not the
[1:12:13] multitude of thy mercies but provoked
[1:12:15] him at the sea even at the Red Sea
[1:12:18] nevertheless he saved
[1:12:22] them
[1:12:24] nevertheless he saved them for his
[1:12:26] name's sake amen you may have been
[1:12:29] crying out and moaning and groaning but
[1:12:32] nevertheless God's word is going to be
[1:12:36] fulfilled nevertheless he's going to
[1:12:39] find somebody that'll believe him
[1:12:41] somebody that'll hold on to the
[1:12:47] promise he saved them for his name's
[1:12:50] sake because he said he would he said
[1:12:52] I'm going to take take you out and I'm
[1:12:54] going to take you
[1:12:55] in that was his promise they should have
[1:12:58] praised him for that promise instead of
[1:13:00] moaned at him for the Red Sea cuz he
[1:13:02] already promised I'm he didn't just say
[1:13:03] I'm taking you out of Egypt he said I'm
[1:13:06] going to take you out but I'm going to
[1:13:07] take you into the land that's flowing
[1:13:08] with milk and
[1:13:09] honey so there was promises there if
[1:13:12] they would have listened and and and got
[1:13:13] a real revelation of it they wouldn't
[1:13:15] have worried about the Red Sea they
[1:13:16] wouldn't have worried about bitter
[1:13:18] Waters they wasn't have worried about no
[1:13:19] food and God already apparently had it
[1:13:21] all taken care of
[1:13:24] yes cuz if he didn't he might have
[1:13:26] warned him about it but he didn't even
[1:13:27] warn him about it he didn't tell him I'm
[1:13:29] going to take you out of a land but
[1:13:31] before you get to this land that's
[1:13:32] flowing with milk and honey there's
[1:13:34] going to be a red sea there's going to
[1:13:35] be dry there's going to be bitter Waters
[1:13:38] there's going to be problems there's
[1:13:39] going to be enemies there's going to be
[1:13:41] no food there's going to be no water but
[1:13:43] don't worry about it I'm going to take
[1:13:44] you into he didn't give them the whole
[1:13:46] road map he just told him this is where
[1:13:48] I'm taking you
[1:13:50] to that's all that we got in this day we
[1:13:53] God I'm going to take you into a Rapture
[1:13:56] I'm going to take you into a body change
[1:13:58] he don't tell you about the trials he
[1:14:00] don't tell you about the sicknesses he
[1:14:02] don't tell you about the trouble you're
[1:14:03] about to go through he don't tell you
[1:14:05] about none of that cuz he's already got
[1:14:07] the answer for it all he's looking for
[1:14:09] somebody that'll praise him no matter if
[1:14:12] they go through a trial if they go
[1:14:14] through a sickness if they go through a
[1:14:16] trouble they know God's with me yes sir
[1:14:20] and nevertheless he's going to save me
[1:14:23] he's going to move me cuz he has to do
[1:14:25] it for his
[1:14:27] reputation I will save I save them for
[1:14:30] my name's sake it was putting his
[1:14:32] reputation on the
[1:14:37] line let me tell you his reputation is
[1:14:40] on the line and God don't let his
[1:14:42] reputation be
[1:14:44] tarnished amen he he has a reputation of
[1:14:47] a Healer he's not going to let that
[1:14:49] reputation be tarnished he's got a
[1:14:51] reputation of a deliverer he's not g to
[1:14:53] let that reputation be tarnished oh
[1:14:56] praise the Lord then they believed and
[1:14:59] went and when believe with belief came
[1:15:02] praise that's right yes and if they had
[1:15:06] have kept the praise they would have
[1:15:08] kept their faith
[1:15:10] amen
[1:15:12] amen may I need to say it again if they
[1:15:14] had have kept the praise they would have
[1:15:16] kept their
[1:15:19] faith they would have maybe walked
[1:15:21] straight to the walls of Jericho
[1:15:24] yes but they went from praise again to
[1:15:28] complaining moaning
[1:15:33] worrying but God brings them he said
[1:15:36] listen they got to the point they got so
[1:15:37] moaning and so groaning God said I'm
[1:15:39] done with this generation I'll raise up
[1:15:42] a new
[1:15:44] generation and that's what he did he
[1:15:46] brought a new generation into the
[1:15:48] promised land amen I want to pick it up
[1:15:50] in Joshua 6 and verse one amen we know
[1:15:53] the we know the story Joshua going
[1:15:55] across and looking at the walls of
[1:15:57] Jericho he had seen them some 40 years
[1:15:59] before he knew what they were and so
[1:16:01] he's like God how are you going to do
[1:16:03] this I'm looking for the answer and
[1:16:05] while he's praying about it an angel
[1:16:07] comes down with a sword
[1:16:09] drone and he said who are you are you
[1:16:12] for us or against it he said no but I am
[1:16:15] the captain of the Lord's host and I
[1:16:17] have come down to give you the battle
[1:16:19] plan and we know the battle plan it says
[1:16:21] in Joshua 6 and verse one and Jericho
[1:16:24] was straightly shut up because of the
[1:16:26] children of Israel none went out and
[1:16:28] none come in and the Lord said unto
[1:16:30] Joshua see I have given you the land I
[1:16:33] given you to thy hand Jericho and the
[1:16:36] King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor
[1:16:39] and you shall Compass the city all you
[1:16:41] Men of War and go about the city once
[1:16:44] thus shalt thou do six days and seven
[1:16:47] priest shall bear before the ark seven
[1:16:49] trumpets of the Ram's Horn and the
[1:16:50] seventh day you shall Compass the City
[1:16:53] seven times and the priest shall blow
[1:16:55] the trumpets and it shall come to pass
[1:16:58] when they make a long blast with the
[1:17:00] Rams Horn then you shall hear the sound
[1:17:03] of the trumpet and all the people shall
[1:17:05] Shout with a great
[1:17:07] shout and then the walls of the city
[1:17:11] will fall flat and the people shall
[1:17:13] Ascend up here every man straight before
[1:17:16] him verse 15 and it came to pass on the
[1:17:19] seventh day that they Rose early about
[1:17:21] the dawn of the day and compass pass the
[1:17:23] city after the same matter seven times
[1:17:25] only on that only on that day they can
[1:17:28] pass the city seven times and it came to
[1:17:30] pass at the seventh
[1:17:33] time at the seventh seventh at the
[1:17:36] seventh time when the priest blew with
[1:17:39] the trumpets Joshua said unto the people
[1:17:43] shout for the Lord hath given you the
[1:17:46] city so the people shouted when the
[1:17:48] priest blew the trumpets and it came to
[1:17:51] pass when the people heard the sound of
[1:17:53] the trumpet and the people shouted with
[1:17:55] a great shout that the walls fell
[1:17:59] down Hallelujah so that the people went
[1:18:02] into the city every man straight before
[1:18:05] them and they took the city he showed
[1:18:08] them that he would fight as they
[1:18:14] praised that's why I don't understand
[1:18:16] anybody that don't believe in shouting
[1:18:18] or don't believe in praising God don't
[1:18:21] believe in glorifying God he listen it's

[1:27:36] Judah one time and Hezekiah he tried to
[1:27:40] give what he could of his own he tried
[1:27:43] to give him gold you can read about it
[1:27:45] in Second Kings 18 tried to give him
[1:27:47] gold and silver even scraped it off the
[1:27:50] doors tried try to bease this guy and to
[1:27:54] not attack but he still he still kept
[1:27:56] coming still making his threats and then
[1:27:59] he came he said don't listen to your God
[1:28:01] he can't save
[1:28:04] you don't that sound like our enemy he
[1:28:07] can't do
[1:28:09] that well he can but I don't know if
[1:28:12] it's his
[1:28:14] will well his will is his word therefore
[1:28:17] he can cuz it's in his
[1:28:21] word amen he can't do anything for you
[1:28:25] you're too far gone there's nobody to be
[1:28:28] to defend you there's nobody to help you

[1:28:37] will your God and he sends out his
[1:28:39] threats and he's coming to carry them
[1:28:41] out and so this time instead of Hezekiah
[1:28:44] turning to what he good he could do he
[1:28:47] turned to his God that's
[1:28:49] why 2 Kings 19 14 Hezekiah received the
[1:28:53] letter amen from the king of Assyria and
[1:28:56] Hezekiah went up to the house of the
[1:28:58] Lord and spread it out before the Lord

[1:29:10] going to do he's going to take my life
[1:29:12] and he spread it before the Lord and
[1:29:14] Hezekiah prayed and he said oh Lord God
[1:29:17] of Israel which dwelleth between the
[1:29:19] cherubims Thou Art God
[1:29:23] Thou Art the god even thou alone of all

[1:29:41] Lord and it goes on down yeah there he
[1:29:43] he said truth he said their Idols were
[1:29:45] then there their gods couldn't save them
[1:29:47] their gods are made of man they're made
[1:29:49] of wood and they're made of stone and
