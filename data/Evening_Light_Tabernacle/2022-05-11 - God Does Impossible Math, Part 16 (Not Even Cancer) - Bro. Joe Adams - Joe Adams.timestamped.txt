[33:59] them tonight
[34:00] amen if you have your bibles we're going
[34:02] to have you turn to first john
[34:04] 5 and verse 13 and as you're turning
[34:06] there
[34:08] just want to give a special happy
[34:09] birthday to sister maryland back in the
[34:11] back
[34:13] amen
[34:16] and then we want to also give happy
[34:18] birthday to brother jude
[34:20] so we got we got
[34:23] we got them in all ages tonight
[34:25] we got them just hitting teenage years
[34:27] and we got them hitting
[34:29] i don't know what you want to call it
[34:30] sister maryland but we're thankful that
[34:32] you're still with us and we'll sure
[34:33] appreciate your testimony through the
[34:35] years and
[34:36] what a mighty god we serve we look here
[34:39] and i want to speak to you once again on
[34:41] god does impossible math this is part 16
[34:44] and i spoke sunday on nothing will stand
[34:46] before your prayer and tonight i want to
[34:48] speak to you on not even cancer
[34:50] so we know if you're familiar with the
[34:52] message you're familiar with this quote
[34:53] or the quotes that brother branham uses
[34:55] when the angel lord met him but we want
[34:57] to finish it through the night and and i
[34:59] would if we would dedicate a sermon to
[35:01] anybody i wouldn't say it would be to
[35:03] any one person but i would say to be
[35:05] those who are in the battle of cancer
[35:07] not only spiritual cancer but also
[35:08] physical cancer but we believe nothing
[35:11] will stand before the believer's prayer
[35:14] not even cancer okay so that's what
[35:16] we're going to focus on tonight and we
[35:18] find here says these things have i
[35:20] written unto you that believe on the
[35:22] name of the son of god that you may know
[35:24] that you have eternal life and that you
[35:26] may believe on the name of the son of
[35:28] god and this is the confidence that we
[35:30] have in him that if we ask anything
[35:33] according to his will
[35:35] he heareth us
[35:37] so god's ears are not deaf that he
[35:39] doesn't hear
[35:40] but he understands he hears the faintest
[35:43] hearts cry your faint whisper to god
[35:46] he's mindful of it he hears it he says
[35:48] if and if we know that he hear us
[35:51] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[35:53] the petitions that we desired of him and
[35:56] we look here in john 15 and verse 7 as
[35:58] well
[36:00] john 15 and verse 7 if you abide in me
[36:03] and my words abide in you
[36:05] then ask what you will and it shall be
[36:07] done unto you
[36:09] these are promises to the believer
[36:11] let me put it like that these are your
[36:13] promises
[36:14] don't just put it off on a believer
[36:16] because sometimes we want to tag that
[36:18] somebody else maybe that super spiritual
[36:19] person in the church but this is your
[36:21] promise as a son and daughter of god he
[36:24] says whatsoever you ask you ask anything
[36:27] and it'll be done unto you herein is my
[36:29] father glorified that you bear much
[36:32] fruit so shall you be my disciples as a
[36:34] father hath loved me
[36:36] so how have i loved you continue in my
[36:38] love if you keep my commandments you
[36:41] shall abide in my love even as i have
[36:43] kept my father's commandments and abide
[36:45] in his love these things have i spoken
[36:48] unto you
[36:49] that my joy might remain in you and that
[36:51] your joy might be full god bless you
[36:54] this evening we'll let you have your
[36:55] seats tonight
[36:58] go ahead and get our timer started
[37:00] just a wonderful wonderful day today
[37:02] just been in the presence of the lord
[37:03] and just thankful again for the
[37:06] opportunity that god has made for us to
[37:08] be able to stand behind this pulpit and
[37:10] to be able to go off on the field full
[37:12] of time it's just a tremendous blessing
[37:14] my everybody keeps looking at him and
[37:15] says man you're a brand new man
[37:17] you know when all that pressure is off
[37:19] of you to make you a brand new person
[37:21] you know the bible says to to enjoy the
[37:24] liberty wherewith he has made us free so
[37:26] we thank we thank the lord for that but
[37:27] in the message where i think pentecost
[37:29] failed we're going to kind of pick back
[37:31] up where we ended on sunday he said he
[37:34] wants us to ask and believe that our
[37:37] joys would be full he wants you to ask
[37:40] abundantly
[37:42] okay ask for big things a lot of times
[37:44] we come to god and we bring the little
[37:46] things but he says ask for big things
[37:48] don't limit your faith to some little
[37:51] mustard seed get on out here in some
[37:54] kind of faith and move out into big
[37:56] things
[37:58] can we move out into big things tonight
[38:00] now we're speaking on not even cancer oh
[38:02] i will assume that's a pretty big thing
[38:05] so i want to make sure that we're all in
[38:06] this together that's why we spoke sunday
[38:08] and we built it on faith because it
[38:10] takes faith to believe and if you have
[38:12] belief and you have faith in the word of
[38:14] god then nothing will stand before your
[38:16] prayer and the prophet says move on out
[38:18] to big things big things is just as easy
[38:21] to receive as little things he goes you
[38:25] just have to believe see that's the key
[38:27] is you just got to believe
[38:29] whatever your need is tonight you just
[38:30] got to believe no matter how big how
[38:33] small you just got to believe he said
[38:35] that's all he says and you got faith
[38:38] now we discussed that on sunday every
[38:40] man he has got a deal from a measure of
[38:42] faith so there's not one of us here
[38:43] tonight that lacks faith he says we got
[38:46] faith just know exactly how to use it
[38:48] and it'll be all right he goes you can
[38:50] put it right to work and it'll be just
[38:53] fine so we all have faith but we just
[38:55] got to know how to use the faith that's
[38:57] been entrusted to us and i believe
[38:59] tonight how do we do that by hearing the
[39:01] word of god by allowing ourselves to
[39:03] come into his presence and faith cometh
[39:06] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[39:08] god now in the message of inspiration
[39:10] brother man tells us god wants us to ask
[39:12] for big things
[39:15] he didn't just say it once he said it
[39:17] multiple times he don't run out of
[39:19] blessings up there
[39:22] oh my the god that we serve doesn't run
[39:24] out of blood he goes you can't ask god
[39:27] for too much
[39:29] see could you imagine a little fish
[39:31] about this long swimming out in the
[39:33] ocean say i better drink of this water
[39:35] sparingly it may dry up
[39:37] you know some of us that's how we do our
[39:39] faith well we better not ask god this
[39:41] because god can only do so much but we
[39:44] find that god can do amazing things he's
[39:47] the inexhaustible fountain of life he
[39:49] said it would be more reasonable for
[39:51] that little fish or that ocean to drop
[39:54] on that little fish than it would to be
[39:55] to think that we can exhaust to god's
[39:58] blessings there's nothing that we can
[40:00] ask but what god can't provide because
[40:02] he's the inexhaustible fountain of life
[40:04] and he says all heaven belongs to you
[40:09] in ephesians 3 and verse 20 it says now
[40:11] unto him that is able to do exceeding
[40:14] abundantly above all that we can ask or
[40:17] think according to the power that
[40:19] worketh within us
[40:21] so the word exceeding abundantly or that
[40:23] phrase means more than necessary god can
[40:26] do more than what is necessary for your
[40:28] trial god can do more than what is
[40:30] necessary for your need it also means
[40:32] supremely it means much more than all it
[40:35] means superior extraordinary or
[40:38] extraordinary surpassing uncommon more
[40:41] imminent more remarkable more excellent
[40:44] so we find today church that god is able
[40:47] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[40:50] that we can even fathom in our finite
[40:53] human minds and the thing that we need
[40:55] to do tonight on a wednesday night is to
[40:57] let our faith loot to believe god let
[41:00] your faith lose tonight to believe that
[41:02] he'll still heal the sick to believe
[41:03] that still that he'll deliver those who
[41:05] are bound notice nothing will stop god's
[41:08] promise there's not one thing not one
[41:11] trial that you go through that can ever
[41:13] stop what god had promised god put it in
[41:15] his word you ask anything in my name
[41:17] that's a promise to the believer and
[41:19] there ain't enough devils in hell can
[41:21] stop that believer from reaching that
[41:23] promise because the devil can't stop
[41:25] what god has already promised and i'm
[41:26] here to tell you tonight god is here we
[41:29] witness god move and god is here to move
[41:31] for you tonight
[41:34] nothing can stand before your prayer
[41:39] your prayer not even cancer
[41:43] see god can do more than is necessary he
[41:45] can do much more than all he can do
[41:47] extraordinary more imminent more
[41:48] remarkable more excellent than you as a
[41:50] believer can even ponder in your mind
[41:54] now some of you are intellectual giants
[41:58] some of you are simple people but no
[42:00] matter where you are in your
[42:01] intellectual bandwidth god can do more
[42:03] than you can even fathom
[42:06] because he's god he's infinite
[42:09] and i love this because you know the
[42:11] thing is
[42:12] you can't put limits on god
[42:14] so we find god can do these things the
[42:17] question is will you let him do it
[42:21] so we know that god can god promise that
[42:24] he can god promise that he will the
[42:26] question is will you let him do it and
[42:29] all that depends on your faith are you
[42:32] willing to let your faith lose tonight
[42:34] to trust god that he said i'll do what
[42:37] you asked of me
[42:39] you got prodigals out there you call
[42:41] them on the scene
[42:42] i'll do what you ask of me but you got
[42:44] to ask it in faith
[42:47] now he tells us in the message faith is
[42:49] the substance this is 1947 and this is
[42:51] where we're going to bring and it's our
[42:52] capstone quote tonight he says now there
[42:55] was an angel came to me in a room and
[42:57] told me that way back back before i was
[42:59] born was before ordained to have a gift
[43:02] of divine healing he came and he told me
[43:05] in a room one night that god had sent
[43:07] the gift and it was a gift of divine
[43:09] healing for the people notice who it was
[43:11] for it wasn't for brother branham
[43:14] it's your gift
[43:16] god sent the gift for you tonight
[43:19] okay and he says and if i could get the
[43:21] people to believe me believe me and
[43:24] would be sincere when i prayed nothing
[43:27] would stand before the prayer
[43:30] he didn't say my prayer it
[43:32] only pertains to brother branham but
[43:34] nothing will stand before thee prayer
[43:38] he says therefore speaking face to face
[43:40] with the supernatural being i believe
[43:42] with all my heart and if i can get you
[43:45] to believe me with all your heart he
[43:48] said that's what moves god and then
[43:51] you're healed see your faith has saved
[43:53] you see what i mean your faith to
[43:56] believe has saved you not what you
[43:58] worked up to and thought in your mind
[44:00] but what you really know the evidence of
[44:02] things not seen
[44:05] see this quote to me is not about
[44:07] physical healing
[44:09] i believe we can apply this to anything
[44:11] any situation that we face as a believer
[44:14] if we can believe nothing will stand
[44:16] before our prayer
[44:18] whatever you ask if you can believe and
[44:20] have faith god will bring it to pass and
[44:23] notice he says your belief in what god
[44:26] said pulls god or moves god toward you
[44:29] so we find that your faith pulls god to
[44:32] your need
[44:33] it pulls god to intercede on your behalf
[44:36] your faith to believe and trust that he
[44:38] will do what he said he'd do that's what
[44:40] moves god to respond to your situation
[44:43] and every person here your situation is
[44:45] unique and different from somebody else
[44:48] but god is yet the same he still moves
[44:51] he still operates he still moves
[44:54] according to his word and all he wants
[44:56] you to do tonight is believe and that's
[44:58] why we took sunday and we built a
[45:01] foundation on faith so you know that
[45:03] you're a believer and god has promised
[45:05] you in the word and nothing can move you
[45:07] off of it so why not believe tonight not
[45:10] only that god can but god will
[45:14] and we find though that is a believer we
[45:16] face hard times now i know this is
[45:18] probably very foreign to some of you you
[45:20] never had a bad day right
[45:23] okay this let's have class participation
[45:25] tonight
[45:26] psalms 34 and verse 17 says the
[45:28] righteous cry in the lord heareth
[45:33] and delivereth them out of all their
[45:35] troubles
[45:36] oh man come on amen let's say that again
[45:39] the righteous cry and the lord heareth
[45:42] and delivered them out of all their
[45:45] troubles they should be a resounding
[45:47] amen
[45:48] otherwise there's no trouble that can
[45:50] take you down god will deliver you out
[45:53] of all your troubles out of all your
[45:56] afflictions out of all your trials on
[45:59] all your calamities the righteous cries
[46:01] they cry out to god they make their
[46:03] petition known and god hears your
[46:05] petition and not only does he hears but
[46:08] he delivers you out of all of them
[46:12] the lord is now unto them that are
[46:13] broken heart and save us such that are
[46:15] of a contrite spirit
[46:17] many are the afflictions
[46:21] of the righteous but the lord delivereth
[46:24] him out of them all he's reiterating
[46:27] god's here to tell you tonight i see
[46:29] your affliction
[46:30] but i'm also the liver
[46:33] so many are the afflictions and if you
[46:35] look that word affliction up it means
[46:38] bad it means evil it means unpleasant it
[46:42] means giving up excuse me given a pain
[46:44] on happiness misery but it also means
[46:47] malignant
[46:49] and the word malignant is malignant see
[46:52] in that word if you look it up it means
[46:54] tending to produce death
[46:57] so many are the afflictions the
[46:58] malignancies
[47:01] and when we when we hear the word
[47:03] malignancy or malignant
[47:05] we think cancer we think the threat to
[47:07] human life we think death because we put
[47:10] it all together you hear somebody they
[47:12] get a bad doctor's report they got
[47:13] cancer first thing you think of is death
[47:15] you don't think oh well how precious is
[47:17] that god's gonna deliver no that's not
[47:19] the first thought that you have you
[47:20] think immediately i'm gonna die
[47:24] but brother baby says now when you get
[47:26] the holy ghost you attend to a lot of
[47:28] obstacles how many can testify that
[47:32] well i use well we'll just we'll back
[47:33] that off many are the afflictions of the
[47:36] righteous but god delivereth him out of
[47:39] them all god brings you right up
[47:41] facing with it so he can show you his
[47:44] power and his goodness
[47:48] so we as a believer we have a promise
[47:50] we're not promised promising flowers at
[47:51] ease
[47:53] that's not why we're here tonight we're
[47:54] promised afflictions
[47:56] oh praise god everybody sign up
[47:59] no but we're also promised you may face
[48:01] those afflictions god will bring you to
[48:02] it but god also take you through it god
[48:05] will deliver you from him he'll not let
[48:07] one thing destroy you so you must
[48:09] believe them no matter what the
[48:10] afflictions you're facing whether it be
[48:12] a physical affliction a mental
[48:14] affliction a financial affliction a
[48:16] spiritual affliction god will deliver
[48:19] you you will not be overcome by the
[48:21] affliction you will not be overcome by
[48:23] the malignancy you will not be overcome
[48:25] by the pain of the situation you will
[48:27] not be overcome by the unhappiness you
[48:29] will not be overcome by the misery of
[48:31] the trial you will not be overcome
[48:34] but god will deliver nothing will stand
[48:37] before your prayer not even malignancy
[48:41] not even cancer
[48:44] so let's look at this for a minute let's
[48:46] find out what is cancer
[48:48] i'm breaking back into my teaching gift
[48:51] yeah i got a lot of text messages about
[48:53] that by the way
[48:56] here in god provide a way of healing a
[48:58] cancer in the natural rims would be a
[49:01] scavenger
[49:02] a buzzard eat dead things
[49:05] a cancer comes from a bruise notice a
[49:07] bruised cell now as i bring this out i
[49:09] want y'all to parallel this i want you
[49:10] to think scriptural or not scripture but
[49:12] i want you to think spiritual and
[49:14] natural a lot of times we want to put it
[49:16] all on the natural we fail to look at
[49:18] the spiritual aspect
[49:20] and the spiritual application of it you
[49:22] can get a cancer in your spirit
[49:25] okay
[49:27] you can get a cancer in your spirit
[49:28] sitting right here at even like
[49:29] tabernacle you can get a cancer in your
[49:31] spirit
[49:32] but not even cancer
[49:35] i don't care what form he comes in
[49:37] whether it be natural whether it be
[49:38] spiritual not even cancer will stand
[49:39] before the believer's prayer
[49:42] notice now see a bruised cell usually is
[49:44] where it comes from the cell is bruised
[49:47] all mashed up the cell is backslidden if
[49:50] something happens in there that fails to
[49:53] get the function of the blood to the
[49:54] right to it right he says and through
[49:57] there satan the author of death which
[49:59] god is the author of life satan the
[50:02] author of death puts a demon in there
[50:04] called a devil a demon called cancer
[50:06] cancer is not its name medical science
[50:08] just give it that name the word cancer
[50:10] comes from the word crab and then it
[50:12] means with legs and things it runs out
[50:15] and it's like other diseases they've
[50:16] given their medical terms then this
[50:18] little cancer comes in there first it is
[50:21] a spirit
[50:23] then it gets into a backslidden cell
[50:26] or a bruised cell or a cell that's not
[50:29] operating right now notice listen what
[50:31] brother bam says here he goes oh i like
[50:33] to preach the gospel now for five
[50:35] minutes he goes that's what happens in
[50:37] the church notice he brings the natural
[50:39] then he also flips real quick to the
[50:41] spiritual aspect of it that's what
[50:43] happens in the church when he gets
[50:45] someone failing to operate with the
[50:47] church someone failing and pulling off
[50:49] and getting indifferent that's a cancer
[50:51] in the church it's a devil in that
[50:53] person that's right and it causes the
[50:55] whole church to be sick the best thing
[50:58] to do is have a spiritual operation then
[51:00] he jumps right back but in this this
[51:03] little cell backslid the cancer come in
[51:06] no it's the cancer it lays there first
[51:09] it's in a spirit
[51:10] then it begins to form a tiny little
[51:13] cell of its own
[51:15] and the little cell becomes first
[51:17] couldn't call he goes i can't call the
[51:18] big word of it but first is it form of
[51:21] life it's cancer it's painless notice
[51:22] it's a little cell then it begins to
[51:24] form a little life of its own and he
[51:26] said in the first phase it's painless
[51:29] he said no one even knows what's
[51:30] happening
[51:32] you don't even know that you have it
[51:36] see the same thing flows in the
[51:38] spiritual aspect take somebody who's got
[51:40] a wounded spirit
[51:42] doesn't know but a little spirit a demon
[51:44] will attach to that
[51:46] and a little crab will begin to draw out
[51:47] and begin to pull back and then begin to
[51:49] get a complex and begin to get this and
[51:51] they begin but see the person doesn't
[51:53] even know it they don't want it it's
[51:54] just there because of a bruised spirit
[51:56] or a bruised cell and that's what
[51:58] brother brad i'm saying it's painless
[52:00] he says no one knows it's happening and
[52:03] now this little cell is born it must
[52:06] feed notice in order to feed it has to
[52:09] feed on your bloodstream just like you
[52:11] feed on the bloodstream when you was in
[52:12] your mother's womb you fed on the
[52:15] substance that she ate and so forth so
[52:18] does this cancer feed on the substance
[52:20] of your body it's one little cell then
[52:22] it grows and it gets begins to feed and
[52:25] another cell breaks out and another cell
[52:27] breaks out and another cell breaks out
[52:29] and after a while is sell on sale sell
[52:33] on cell tumor cataract whatever it may
[52:36] be it grows bigger bigger bigger larger
[52:38] spreading out the more cells and more
[52:41] cells
[52:43] here goes the first thing you know it
[52:44] begins to zap or sap
[52:47] so much blood till this young lady
[52:49] begins to feel sick
[52:51] so notice it's been there for a while
[52:53] and it's beginning to build up and get
[52:55] into spread
[52:56] but as it begins to spread then it
[52:58] begins to draw the blood and begins to
[53:01] pull the life out of the host and it
[53:03] begins to make them feel sick
[53:08] he says what is it it's also poison it's
[53:11] death it runs into every little fiber of
[53:14] the body that it can down into the
[53:16] tissue stretching its legs down weeding
[53:19] out like roots of a tree going all
[53:21] around wrapping through the intestines
[53:23] up through the spine he said the doctor
[53:26] comes along opens them up there's
[53:28] nothing can be done the man to the best
[53:30] of his knowledge is saying everything
[53:32] that he knows there it is so the patient
[53:34] up it's finished it's all there's
[53:36] nothing can be done you can't take that
[53:39] person all apart we couldn't find it
[53:42] anyway anyhow if we could there it is
[53:44] the patient's hopelessly
[53:46] helplessly gone then as far as a doctor
[53:49] is concerned
[53:52] so this is the stage in the progression
[53:55] of cancer
[53:59] and the patient is hopeless
[54:02] the patient is helpless
[54:05] because you can't take the patient and
[54:06] continue to open them up and dissect and
[54:09] eradicate every sale it takes something
[54:12] greater than a physician
[54:15] now i'm being told
[54:17] and i tried to find this out today but
[54:19] i'm just gonna i've been told that when
[54:21] brother biscuit brother bisco met with
[54:22] brother branham and brother branham
[54:24] begin to tell him about the story of how
[54:26] the angel visited him what we just spoke
[54:28] about when the angel visited him and
[54:30] gave him the commission of divine
[54:31] healing
[54:33] he said you'll take this gift of divine
[54:34] healing to the people
[54:36] and if you can get the people to believe
[54:38] you
[54:40] then nothing will stand before your
[54:42] prayer
[54:43] and brother branham asked the angel what
[54:45] about cancer
[54:46] and his reply was not even cancer
[54:52] so i don't believe that god sent an
[54:54] angel
[54:55] on a personal mission to tell brother
[54:57] branham
[54:59] that nothing will stand before his
[55:01] prayer not even cancer and then when he
[55:03] left the scene all of us were a null and
[55:05] void
[55:07] but i believe the same commission the
[55:09] same promise the same visitation that
[55:12] that angel visited with a prophet came
[55:15] to him and assured him that nothing will
[55:17] stand before his prayer it's the same
[55:19] angel that we've been witnessing here at
[55:21] even like tabernacle coming to you and i
[55:23] too many of us here tonight and he's
[55:25] witnessed again that nothing will stand
[55:27] before the prayer of the bride no matter
[55:29] how dark it is no matter what the
[55:31] afflictions you're facing no matter what
[55:33] we're going through nothing will stand
[55:35] before the believer's prayer not even
[55:39] cancer
[55:41] notice now
[55:43] i believe also that this angel began to
[55:45] tell brother ben exactly
[55:47] how to get your need met first was to
[55:50] get to people to believe
[55:52] see that's the key
[55:54] because if we can't get you to rise up
[55:55] in faith there's nothing that god can do
[55:57] for you god can't do anything but what
[55:59] you first confess that he's done it so
[56:01] that takes faith right but he also says
[56:04] now he puts it back on the ministry or
[56:06] on the prophet on the ministry he says
[56:08] you must be sincere when you pray
[56:11] so otherwise you've got to have feeling
[56:13] for the people you've got to have
[56:14] empathy for the people put yourself in
[56:16] their place and then when you begin to
[56:19] pray nothing will stand before your
[56:21] prayer because one they believe two you
[56:24] begin to intercede you put yourself
[56:26] there as if you're facing the same
[56:28] affliction and no doubt you want to be
[56:30] healed no doubt you want to be delivered
[56:32] no doubt you want to be set free and we
[56:35] find when that takes place when the
[56:37] believer believes and a man begins to
[56:39] pray and he prays with sincerity god
[56:41] begins to move and there's nothing we'll
[56:44] stand before the prayer
[56:47] now we find here in first corinthians 5
[56:49] and verse 7.
[56:51] first corinthians 5 and verse 7.
[56:55] the bible says purge out therefore the
[56:58] old leaven
[57:00] that we may be or that ye may be a new
[57:03] lump
[57:05] you got to watch how you say that word
[57:06] lump right you can offend somebody today
[57:08] with that
[57:11] some of you got that joke some of you
[57:12] didn't that's okay
[57:16] he says now as you are 11. he's let me
[57:19] go back and read it again purge out
[57:20] therefore the old 11 that you may be a
[57:23] new lump as you are unleavened for even
[57:26] christ our passover is sacrificed for us
[57:29] therefore
[57:31] let us keep the feasts not with old
[57:33] leaven
[57:34] neither with leaven of malice and
[57:36] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[57:39] of sincerity and truth
[57:44] this scripture is going to play a part
[57:45] later on during this service so just
[57:47] hang tight with it so this word purge
[57:50] here means to cleanse out
[57:52] thoroughly cleanse or clean thoroughly
[57:56] otherwise we can't have any of our
[57:58] man-made ideas
[58:01] okay we got to
[58:02] thoroughly cleanse out so to keep the
[58:05] feast
[58:07] we are to keep the feasts we are to do
[58:09] it but we're not to do it with the old
[58:10] 11 man's ideas man traditions we want to
[58:13] be a new love we want to be unleavened
[58:15] in the way that we continue to keep our
[58:16] worship pure and to keep our services
[58:19] pure and and have the spirit and the
[58:21] truth is not to allow malice to come in
[58:23] not to allow wickedness to come in not
[58:25] to allow ourselves to be entangled
[58:27] without the affairs of the world and not
[58:29] to allow man's ideas to persuade us this
[58:31] way or that way and we find you know
[58:34] paul tells them now he goes keep the
[58:36] feasts but do it not with the old leaven
[58:39] but neither with the leaven of mouth so
[58:41] he begins to identify what's going on in
[58:43] that church there's malice in that
[58:45] church there's wickedness in that church
[58:47] but i want you to come back to the
[58:49] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[58:52] and paul is trying to urge the believer
[58:54] come back to sincerity believe what i'm
[58:56] preaching to you believe what i told you
[58:58] i met god i met him on the road he
[59:00] changed my life he opened my eyes and i
[59:03] could see who i am and that's what he's
[59:04] trying to say to you tonight is come
[59:06] back to the bread of the unleavened
[59:08] bread of sincerity and truth not just
[59:11] one and not have the other but we got to
[59:13] have both
[59:14] but first we got to eradicate malice and
[59:17] that word malice means malignancy cancer
[59:22] the word malistaire means malignancy
[59:24] cancer ill will desire to injure
[59:27] depravity evil trouble but the word
[59:30] sincere means we got to be free from
[59:32] pretense or deceit we got to be free and
[59:35] we got to have genuine feelings
[59:38] we want to be sincere in our worship i
[59:41] don't want to just come to worship
[59:42] because that's what's expected of us
[59:45] no we come to worship because we're
[59:46] believers
[59:48] and we're free from all these things
[59:50] that's trying to pull us down satan
[59:51] trying to get in there the bible will
[59:53] tell us in hebrews 12 and verse 1 let us
[59:55] lay aside every weight otherwise let us
[59:58] lay aside every burden every encompass
[1:00:02] lay it all aside that we may do what
[1:00:04] that we may run the race that is set
[1:00:06] before us each of you here tonight have
[1:00:08] a race to run but don't run it with
[1:00:10] malice don't run it with wickedness
[1:00:12] don't run up with encompasses of this
[1:00:14] life don't run it with ill will towards
[1:00:15] somebody else no run this race with
[1:00:17] sincerity of the word
[1:00:19] hey god hand picked you in this hour
[1:00:22] not everybody here is hearing this
[1:00:24] message
[1:00:25] i'm not just speaking about this message
[1:00:27] tonight but not everybody
[1:00:28] has been able to grasp
[1:00:30] and understand the message of malachi 4.
[1:00:33] revelations 10 7 and 8.
[1:00:37] luke 17
[1:00:39] 30. these things are special only a
[1:00:41] unique class of people
[1:00:43] can receive it
[1:00:45] now we find in exodus
[1:00:47] 12 and verse 3 and the 10th day of the
[1:00:49] month
[1:00:50] they shall take them every man a lamb
[1:00:52] according to the house or their father
[1:00:54] is a lamb for a house
[1:00:56] then we drop down in verse six and
[1:00:58] they're going to kill this lamb in the
[1:00:59] evening
[1:01:00] verse seven take the blood strike it on
[1:01:02] the two side posts in the upper door
[1:01:04] post of the house we spoke about that on
[1:01:06] sunday how we applied the blood blood
[1:01:08] being the word we apply it with hyssop
[1:01:10] he was representing faith that's what
[1:01:12] we're to do but also we find here that
[1:01:15] in verse 8 and they shall eat the flesh
[1:01:17] in that night roasted with fire and
[1:01:20] unleavened bread
[1:01:24] this unleavened bread is sincerity and
[1:01:27] truth the word
[1:01:28] not mixed with man's ideas
[1:01:31] notice
[1:01:32] israel killed the lamb applied the blood
[1:01:34] with hyssop and they also took of the
[1:01:36] unleavened bread this was emblematic of
[1:01:37] purity so let us be sincere and true in
[1:01:41] our worship
[1:01:43] when we walk through these doors we come
[1:01:45] to worship god we don't come just to see
[1:01:47] somebody or to be seen but we come to
[1:01:49] worship god for what he has done for us
[1:01:54] let us be sincere let us be true let us
[1:01:56] be faithful and i believe that no
[1:01:58] christian can have or give evidence of
[1:02:00] sincerity who is not willing to put away
[1:02:02] all sin
[1:02:04] and sin is unbelief no christian can
[1:02:06] have malice and ill will in his heart
[1:02:08] and claim to be a true worshiper of god
[1:02:11] no christian can have want somebody to
[1:02:13] get a recompense of their of their
[1:02:15] injury oh they harmed me so i'm gonna i
[1:02:17] want them god to get even with them we
[1:02:19] can't have that we're to let those
[1:02:20] things go you know but we are to purge
[1:02:22] out that old leaven
[1:02:24] if we plan on seeing god moving in our
[1:02:26] midst and it's going to we got to remain
[1:02:27] pure in our worship we we're going to
[1:02:30] see god in our midst and we're going to
[1:02:32] see miracles we're going to see healings
[1:02:33] we want to see the things that take
[1:02:35] place then we can't come within the
[1:02:37] encumbrances to our worship
[1:02:41] we can't mix in our own unbelief and
[1:02:43] expect to receive from god
[1:02:45] we can't mix our own ideas and expect to
[1:02:48] receive we can't mix psychology
[1:02:54] in with it and expect to receive from
[1:02:56] god we can't mix man's ideas programs
[1:02:59] and expect to receive we must face what
[1:03:03] we're facing with the unleavened bread
[1:03:05] of sincerity and truth we have the truth
[1:03:09] this message is the truth god's word is
[1:03:12] true and every man is alive so no matter
[1:03:14] what it looks like no matter what we're
[1:03:15] facing we are to purge out the old
[1:03:18] leaven
[1:03:19] and keep the feast
[1:03:20] the worship our worship
[1:03:23] with the unleavened bread of sincerity
[1:03:26] and truth
[1:03:27] now we find as we begin to jump a little
[1:03:29] bit here i'm going to go to romans 4 and
[1:03:31] verse 16.
[1:03:34] it says therefore it is a faith that it
[1:03:37] might be by grace to the end
[1:03:39] the promise might be sure to all seed
[1:03:41] not to that only which is of the law but
[1:03:43] also that which is of the faith of
[1:03:44] abraham who is the father of us all as
[1:03:46] it is written i have made thee a father
[1:03:48] of many nations
[1:03:49] before
[1:03:50] him who he believed even god who
[1:03:52] quickened the dead and calleth those
[1:03:54] things which were not as though they
[1:03:55] were notice
[1:03:57] who against hope believed in hope verse
[1:04:00] 19 and being not weak in faith he
[1:04:02] considered not his own body now dead
[1:04:05] neither yet the dennis of sarah's womb
[1:04:07] he staggered not at the promises of god
[1:04:08] through unbelief but he was strong in
[1:04:10] faith giving glory to god and being
[1:04:12] fully persuaded
[1:04:14] what he had promised he was also able to
[1:04:17] perform so abraham had to believe for
[1:04:20] the impossible
[1:04:22] now i know many you may be getting tired
[1:04:23] of my series on god does impossible math
[1:04:25] but it's real to me because i was
[1:04:27] thinking about it pondering about it
[1:04:28] earlier today that word math is we think
[1:04:31] about an equation god always has the
[1:04:33] answer to the equations you and i can
[1:04:36] write the equation out like right here
[1:04:38] and it may take us hours to kind of to
[1:04:40] arrive at the answer and sometimes god
[1:04:43] allows certain things to take place
[1:04:44] because he knows he's going to get to
[1:04:46] the answer but things got to line up
[1:04:50] and i believe just like we faced with
[1:04:51] abraham abraham was holding on for 25
[1:04:54] years he was given a promise and the
[1:04:56] bible says man shall not live by bread
[1:04:57] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:04:59] out of the mouth of god abraham wasn't
[1:05:01] relying just on the physical substance
[1:05:03] that he took in the land abraham was
[1:05:05] living off the promise that god gave him
[1:05:08] abraham i'm going to visit you abraham
[1:05:10] you're going to have a son by sarah and
[1:05:12] you're going to call his name isaac and
[1:05:14] months went by 9 months nothing year
[1:05:16] went by nothing 5 10 15 20 25 years but
[1:05:21] finally abraham the bible says he
[1:05:23] staggered not at the promises of god he
[1:05:25] believed in hope he stood firm on the
[1:05:28] foundation of the word he wasn't just
[1:05:30] believing for his own physical substance
[1:05:32] he was believing for the spiritual that
[1:05:34] god gave the promise and no matter what
[1:05:36] our faith god will enter my word god
[1:05:38] will honor his faith god will honor if i
[1:05:40] just keep believing god will bring it to
[1:05:42] pass and we saw abraham a man who was
[1:05:44] tired in his body and he ignored the
[1:05:46] deadness of his life he ignored the
[1:05:48] deadness of sarah's womb and he believed
[1:05:50] and gives hope
[1:05:52] he believed when everybody else said
[1:05:53] abraham you're acting a fool why are you
[1:05:55] believing this
[1:05:56] because god said it
[1:05:59] and nothing will stand before my prayer
[1:06:01] i believe god i believe his word i
[1:06:03] believe his commission to me and he
[1:06:05] stood there and god made it manifest
[1:06:10] abraham was living
[1:06:12] not just on substance alone but on the
[1:06:14] promise of the word of god and church
[1:06:16] that's what we've got to live on we've
[1:06:18] got to live on this world we gotta live
[1:06:19] on thus saith the lord
[1:06:22] each of us today
[1:06:24] we can choose right here tonight to
[1:06:26] either accept the word or reject the
[1:06:28] word
[1:06:30] see abraham had to believe here he was
[1:06:32] an old man
[1:06:34] 25 years old his life dead
[1:06:37] no strength
[1:06:39] but god tells him i'm going to nurse you
[1:06:41] back to health
[1:06:42] think about this abraham's old age
[1:06:44] didn't stand in the way of the promise
[1:06:47] his deadness of his body didn't stand
[1:06:48] the way of the promise sarah's womb
[1:06:50] didn't stand in the way of the promise
[1:06:52] god gave him a promise i'm going to
[1:06:54] nurse you come here abraham and nurse
[1:06:56] from el shaddai the breast of god all
[1:06:58] that you have need of abraham i'm here
[1:07:02] you don't have to live just on physical
[1:07:04] substance alone but by every word that
[1:07:06] proceeds out of the mouth of god and
[1:07:08] brother man will tell us he says now no
[1:07:10] matter what it looks like we don't look
[1:07:12] at what we see we look at what we don't
[1:07:14] see is that right see the word means to
[1:07:16] look there doesn't mean it means to
[1:07:18] understand so you have to accept it by
[1:07:20] faith and then when it comes into you
[1:07:22] you understand it you accept healing the
[1:07:24] same way stay right with it not what you
[1:07:27] look at but it's what you believe what
[1:07:29] you understand to be the truth what
[1:07:31] you're looking at the unseen then stay
[1:07:34] with it
[1:07:36] god's formed abraham's body
[1:07:40] god formed sarah's body god allowed them
[1:07:42] to get old
[1:07:44] wrinkled dried up milk veins gone
[1:07:47] everything gone
[1:07:49] only to provide or to perform a
[1:07:51] supernatural event in their life
[1:07:53] foreshadowing what he was going to do in
[1:07:54] our lives
[1:07:58] but like abraham we got
[1:08:00] we got to judge god faithful like sarah
[1:08:02] like abraham stagger not at the promise
[1:08:04] of god not being weak in faith but
[1:08:06] believe being fully persuaded
[1:08:08] that nothing will stand before the
[1:08:10] believer's prayer
[1:08:13] surely god if he could do this for
[1:08:15] abraham and abraham believed and abraham
[1:08:19] his body be turned back and he manifest
[1:08:21] a promised son
[1:08:22] surely the same god that did that for
[1:08:24] abraham
[1:08:25] would also for us destroy any enemy
[1:08:27] that's trying to destroy your life
[1:08:30] the bible says in second thessalonians 1
[1:08:32] 6 seeing it is a righteous thing with
[1:08:35] god to recompense tribulation to them
[1:08:37] that trouble you
[1:08:39] god's going to get even with your enemy
[1:08:43] some of you need to write that down
[1:08:44] god's going to get even with my enemy
[1:08:47] nothing will stand before my prayer
[1:08:50] notice now he says that sickness
[1:08:53] whatever you have if that is pulling on
[1:08:56] you
[1:08:56] it's going to try try to put everything
[1:08:59] in your mind to keep you from believing
[1:09:00] that this is the truth he says this
[1:09:03] which is coming now and me speaking to
[1:09:05] you is trying to get you to believe that
[1:09:07] it is the truth you see now here's the
[1:09:10] warfare
[1:09:12] see if you will believe it he says the
[1:09:15] holy spirit will pronounce the blessing
[1:09:17] satan has to leave it has to be so you
[1:09:20] see every service there's a spiritual
[1:09:21] warfare satan is trying to get you not
[1:09:23] to believe
[1:09:24] and yet god is trying to get you to
[1:09:26] believe by what by preaching the gospel
[1:09:28] by preaching faith by preaching the word
[1:09:31] and so we find he does these things and
[1:09:32] he does supernatural things within the
[1:09:34] body of the local body and even
[1:09:37] the church itself for the main purpose
[1:09:39] to get the people to believe why don't
[1:09:41] we see the healing of sister atlanta and
[1:09:43] different ones in our church is to get
[1:09:45] you to believe and trust god for no
[1:09:47] matter what you're facing
[1:09:50] don't make any difference whether you
[1:09:51] have a prayer card or not say we don't
[1:09:53] pass out prayer cards how many you ever
[1:09:54] been healed in this service
[1:09:56] in the church come on raise your hand
[1:09:57] you've been healed how many you've been
[1:09:59] delivered
[1:10:00] i mean you've been set free
[1:10:02] what is that did you have a prayer card
[1:10:05] no but god honored your faith and that's
[1:10:07] the way god moves god's not looking for
[1:10:09] he says many more
[1:10:10] are healed out there than ever that
[1:10:12] comes up here it's because of the faith
[1:10:14] they begin to believe and up here he
[1:10:16] begins to manifest this one and that one
[1:10:18] tell them what their issue is and see
[1:10:19] the sign and see this and and go back
[1:10:21] and discern the heart and everything but
[1:10:23] it was for a purpose was to get you out
[1:10:26] there to believe that god was on the
[1:10:28] platform and i'm going to tell you
[1:10:29] tonight god is on the platform he shows
[1:10:32] up for every service we don't just say
[1:10:35] that as cliche where two or three will
[1:10:37] be gathered in my name i'll be there god
[1:10:39] is there every service he's there but
[1:10:41] yet every service the devil's there and
[1:10:43] try to pull you back and try to give you
[1:10:45] unbelief and there's a spiritual warfare
[1:10:47] but you've got to yield yourself to
[1:10:49] faith and believe and respond to the
[1:10:51] word don't sit there like a bump on the
[1:10:53] lawn and expect god to do something when
[1:10:55] you're not putting nothing out put
[1:10:57] something out in the service believe god
[1:10:59] take god and his word say amen to the
[1:11:01] word yes lord
[1:11:08] now he says now if
[1:11:10] we are if you can get the people to
[1:11:12] believe you
[1:11:13] not believe notice now not believe me as
[1:11:16] a man
[1:11:17] but believe the message i'm telling you
[1:11:20] there it is
[1:11:22] see
[1:11:23] get the people the angel tell me if you
[1:11:26] can get the people to believe you not
[1:11:27] believe me as a man but believe the
[1:11:30] message i'm telling you
[1:11:31] so he says now watch the order of it
[1:11:33] this is in led by the spirit 1950 he
[1:11:36] says listen at the order of it ministers
[1:11:38] especially now here it is now listen
[1:11:41] close
[1:11:43] if you get the people to believe you he
[1:11:45] said and be sincere when you pray
[1:11:48] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:11:51] see that's why we preach faith
[1:11:54] that's why we preach a living god that's
[1:11:56] why we preach a god that still heals
[1:11:58] that's why we preach about a god that
[1:12:00] still does miraculous is to elevate your
[1:12:03] faith we preach
[1:12:04] jesus christ both mechanics and dynamics
[1:12:08] but you've got to believe
[1:12:10] see the order of it is first is for the
[1:12:12] believer to believe
[1:12:15] and then us as a ministry to be sincere
[1:12:17] when we pray
[1:12:19] so we find now our thought tonight is
[1:12:22] not even cancer
[1:12:25] you're probably wondering bro joe you're
[1:12:26] going all around debbie's house i know
[1:12:28] there's not a debbie here
[1:12:30] oh maybe there is
[1:12:34] well you didn't used to be here
[1:12:39] anyway we're going around debbie's house
[1:12:41] kind of nice house by the way with a
[1:12:42] beautiful view on the back porch
[1:12:46] but we want to look at tonight and we're
[1:12:47] going to hone down
[1:12:49] not even cancer so cancer was one of the
[1:12:51] greatest threats to life in the 1940s
[1:12:54] 30s earlier beyond medical science
[1:12:56] didn't have the means or the
[1:12:57] capabilities at that time to treat a
[1:13:00] cancer patient it wasn't until the
[1:13:02] mid-1940s
[1:13:04] that science began to try to treat
[1:13:06] cancer patients and they treated them
[1:13:07] with penicillin and sulfur so when
[1:13:10] someone was diagnosed with cancer they
[1:13:11] were
[1:13:12] they were a dead man walking
[1:13:15] they knew it was a death sentence they
[1:13:16] were going to die it was just a matter
[1:13:18] of time
[1:13:20] and that's why the prophet of god will
[1:13:21] ask the angel what about cancer
[1:13:25] but see because cancer was the greatest
[1:13:27] threat to life
[1:13:29] the greatest hindrance was cancer
[1:13:33] but we find here in mark 9 and verse 23
[1:13:36] jesus said unto him
[1:13:38] if thou canst believe
[1:13:40] all things are possible to him that
[1:13:43] believeth
[1:13:45] all things
[1:13:47] uh matthew 21 and 21 jesus answered said
[1:13:49] unto them verily i say unto you if you
[1:13:52] have faith and not doubt you shall not
[1:13:54] only do this which is done in the fig
[1:13:56] tree but also if you shall say unto this
[1:13:58] mountain to be thou removed and be thou
[1:14:00] cast into the sea it shall be done and
[1:14:02] all things
[1:14:04] whatsoever you ask in prayer believing
[1:14:07] you shall receive
[1:14:09] see god doesn't put limits on what
[1:14:11] you're able to ask
[1:14:13] doesn't put limits there he says all
[1:14:16] things all things are possible to them
[1:14:18] that believe therefore the only thing
[1:14:21] that limits god is you
[1:14:24] you are the limiter to what your need is
[1:14:27] but if you can let your faith loose
[1:14:30] tonight there's no limits to what god
[1:14:32] can do for you tonight
[1:14:34] the bible says in hebrews 11 verse 6 but
[1:14:36] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:14:39] him that's why it's paramount that we
[1:14:41] have faith that's why it's paramount
[1:14:43] that we preach faith
[1:14:45] it's one thing to preach the deep
[1:14:47] mysteries of the word but we also got to
[1:14:49] mix that or mix it or to intermingle
[1:14:51] that with with this very simple
[1:14:53] faith-based preaching because we're all
[1:14:56] on different levels
[1:14:58] we have some bays we have some older we
[1:15:00] have some in the middle i like the deep
[1:15:02] things of god i like the faith of god i
[1:15:04] like it all
[1:15:05] but we it takes all of it that's why i
[1:15:07] believe we've got a world a well-rounded
[1:15:09] ministry here because you get all the
[1:15:11] angles
[1:15:12] and we're all our focus is to get you to
[1:15:15] believe that god will do the impossible
[1:15:17] there's nothing that god can't do if
[1:15:20] you'll release your faith to him and let
[1:15:22] him to do it tonight
[1:15:23] he says now there was an angel sent from
[1:15:25] the presence of god he said if you can
[1:15:27] get the people to believe you would be
[1:15:29] sincere when you pray nothing shall
[1:15:31] stand before your prayer not even cancer
[1:15:35] and they asked brother branham does
[1:15:36] everybody get well brother branham he
[1:15:38] said everybody that truly believes gets
[1:15:41] wells thousands have been healed
[1:15:44] now when they lifted that brazen uh
[1:15:46] serpent in in the wilderness there not
[1:15:48] everybody got healed but those that
[1:15:50] looked on it those that believed that
[1:15:52] when they looked at it because they were
[1:15:53] bit by a serpent they were healed but
[1:15:55] those that refused said oh that's just
[1:15:57] hogwash they died
[1:15:59] and we find at the pool of bethesda
[1:16:01] those that had faith to get so close to
[1:16:03] the water because they knew when the
[1:16:05] angel came down and he troubled the
[1:16:07] water if they could get in they'd be
[1:16:08] made well so it's not for everybody but
[1:16:11] it's for whosoever will believe all
[1:16:13] things are possible tonight if it means
[1:16:16] lifting up on a brazen serpent the
[1:16:17] brazen serpent never prayed for anybody
[1:16:19] the pool of bethesda never prayed for
[1:16:21] anybody but god sent down ministry today
[1:16:24] sincere ministers that are preaching the
[1:16:26] anointed word to do what to get you to
[1:16:29] believe so that you can't have your
[1:16:31] prayer met
[1:16:32] so that god can minister to your need
[1:16:34] and you can go away victorious
[1:16:38] see man is god's agent today god gives
[1:16:41] gifts to man now of course god operates
[1:16:44] by the holy spirit through man man is
[1:16:46] god's agent
[1:16:48] not a tape player
[1:16:50] man is god's agent
[1:16:52] man god anointed man to preach the
[1:16:55] gospel to elevate the faith to get the
[1:16:57] people to believe so nothing would be
[1:16:59] impossible with you and your prayer
[1:17:04] he said the thing of it is now
[1:17:06] the thing is is to get the people to
[1:17:09] believe that this is the truth
[1:17:12] you got to get the people to believe my
[1:17:14] responsibility for the heirs
[1:17:16] responsibility the responsibility of
[1:17:18] this ministry and every god ordained
[1:17:20] ministry is to get the people to believe
[1:17:24] that's our responsibility your
[1:17:26] responsibility is to believe
[1:17:29] and then we do that by preaching the
[1:17:30] word of god
[1:17:32] now listen what brother brown says here
[1:17:34] in the angel in the commission this is
[1:17:35] 1950. he goes i'm going to pray for you
[1:17:38] you believe
[1:17:39] i believe with all my heart and lay
[1:17:42] hands over on them and pray for them and
[1:17:44] ask the blessing in the name of the lord
[1:17:45] jesus passed him on he goes now they're
[1:17:48] supposed to go away rejoicing believing
[1:17:51] that they're going to get well the
[1:17:52] cripple's supposed to believe that
[1:17:53] they're going to walk the blind is
[1:17:55] supposed to believe that they're going
[1:17:56] to see
[1:17:58] so he was telling you you have a
[1:18:00] responsibility sometimes we get in a
[1:18:03] prayer line and we want our hearts to
[1:18:04] serve but that wasn't the commission the
[1:18:06] commission was if you can believe he
[1:18:08] could just pass you on through and you
[1:18:10] as to go through believing that if you
[1:18:12] had blind eyes you can be able to walk
[1:18:13] out and see if you were crippled you're
[1:18:15] going to walk out there on the other
[1:18:16] side that's your responsibility our
[1:18:19] responsibility is to preach the word
[1:18:21] with sincerity and when we pray for you
[1:18:23] to enter in and to believe that god is
[1:18:26] going to do what god said he will do and
[1:18:27] we will see the needs of the people met
[1:18:30] and you saw time after time after time
[1:18:33] god god came by and god done so much for
[1:18:36] brother branham and brother branagh's
[1:18:37] ministry but it wasn't just for brother
[1:18:39] branham it's for those that are standing
[1:18:41] for this message those that are standing
[1:18:43] for this gospel god is the same god he
[1:18:45] didn't cease to be god when brother
[1:18:47] branham went off the scene he's as much
[1:18:49] god for you tonight we got evidence in
[1:18:51] the land church that god is a healer and
[1:18:53] god is a miracle worker that god is a
[1:18:55] savior that god can bring the prodigals
[1:18:57] home we have seen it we have witnessed
[1:19:00] it hey god is still moving and nothing
[1:19:02] will stand before your prayer
[1:19:04] not even the greatest threat to life
[1:19:08] cancer can't stand before you
[1:19:10] [Applause]
[1:19:13] notice now
[1:19:16] brother says now
[1:19:18] regardless of what they have
[1:19:22] regardless of what they have
[1:19:24] he
[1:19:25] designated
[1:19:27] see god who is my judge knows
[1:19:29] he designated cancer
[1:19:32] he said nothing if you can get to people
[1:19:34] to believe you and be sincere when you
[1:19:37] pray
[1:19:37] nothing shall stand before your prayer
[1:19:40] not even cancer if you get the people to
[1:19:44] believe you
[1:19:45] not believe you as a man
[1:19:47] that's what we feel many of us we put
[1:19:48] our faith in a man and it's not man that
[1:19:51] we put our faith in but it's in the word
[1:19:52] of god
[1:19:53] believe that the message that he's
[1:19:55] teaching or the message that he's
[1:19:57] preaching the message that is coming for
[1:19:59] believe that it is the truth and then he
[1:20:00] said he designated cancer
[1:20:04] see he designated cancer
[1:20:06] my my my time is flying by i gotta speed
[1:20:08] up here
[1:20:10] now let's just see
[1:20:12] how fast cancer has to leave in the
[1:20:14] presence of god how many would like to
[1:20:15] see that just for a
[1:20:16] minute okay good
[1:20:19] problem says now
[1:20:21] let me get there
[1:20:24] he said you can get the people to
[1:20:25] believe and be sincere when you pray
[1:20:27] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:20:28] there'll be nothing no matter what
[1:20:30] disease you have it won't stand before
[1:20:32] the prayer if you will believe he says
[1:20:37] they got to believe they got to testify
[1:20:39] they got to confess it and god will
[1:20:40] bring it to pass so we find here
[1:20:43] let me find out where i was where i
[1:20:45] wanted to go here
[1:20:47] how fast this is in 1951 the second
[1:20:50] miracle he said bring the lady all right
[1:20:51] sister what do you think about it you
[1:20:53] believe put your put your handkerchief
[1:20:55] in your other hand and lay your hand on
[1:20:56] mine
[1:20:58] what does that look like to you strange
[1:21:00] looking sight there isn't it it's cancer
[1:21:03] come here just for a moment you know
[1:21:05] when the angel lord met me
[1:21:07] that was the first thing he said
[1:21:10] to not even cancer will stand before the
[1:21:12] prayer do you believe it he goes i want
[1:21:13] you to repeat this and watch my hand
[1:21:16] repeat this as i say from from your
[1:21:19] heart
[1:21:21] he says lord jesus
[1:21:22] now
[1:21:23] i want you to watch he says seeing the
[1:21:25] moving of the hand lord jesus the lady
[1:21:26] repeats after brother branham i believe
[1:21:28] you i accept you as my healer i believe
[1:21:31] that there was a supernatural being
[1:21:33] that said these things to brother
[1:21:35] branham i believe
[1:21:36] his presence is here now i accept my
[1:21:39] healing now what happened something
[1:21:42] changed there didn't it the vibration
[1:21:44] stopped didn't it your faith has made
[1:21:46] you whole sister your cancer is dead
[1:21:49] it's gone god bless you
[1:21:53] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:21:57] brother branham didn't heal her
[1:22:00] he just elevated her faith
[1:22:03] see the sign
[1:22:05] that she saw in his hand wasn't what
[1:22:07] healed her her faith to believe that
[1:22:09] that supernatural being that met him in
[1:22:11] the cave or met him in that little room
[1:22:13] and gave him the commission that he had
[1:22:15] and if he could get her to believe
[1:22:17] because he knew he was going to be
[1:22:18] sincere when he prayed nothing would
[1:22:19] stand before that prayer and it was just
[1:22:21] a matter of minutes
[1:22:23] and cancer left
[1:22:24] so in order for this to work we got to
[1:22:27] believe
[1:22:28] the ministry has to be sincere we can't
[1:22:30] mix it with our own ideas but it's got
[1:22:32] to be the unleavened bread
[1:22:35] of sincerity and truth so sincerity
[1:22:39] plays a major major major major role in
[1:22:43] what we get from god
[1:22:45] sincerity plays a major role in the
[1:22:48] binding of the enemy sincerity
[1:22:52] can we go a little further
[1:22:54] i'm kind of liking this teaching brother
[1:22:59] i'm doing good
[1:23:01] that's from a teacher y'all he's just
[1:23:03] telling me what i want to hear
[1:23:05] notice here this is in the paradox and
[1:23:07] we're going to i'm trying to tie some
[1:23:08] things together because
[1:23:10] we find that the unleavened bread is
[1:23:12] sincerity and truth and and we find that
[1:23:14] in order
[1:23:16] for nothing to stand before your prayer
[1:23:17] you got to believe and we got to be
[1:23:19] sincere
[1:23:20] and brother branham here we find him he
[1:23:22] goes it seemed like everybody was afraid
[1:23:24] i said what's everybody afraid of and
[1:23:26] the voice came and said there is such
[1:23:29] danger in these days this great hideous
[1:23:31] thing that that is death when it strikes
[1:23:34] you and i heard the weeds smashing down
[1:23:36] and i look excuse me and here come a
[1:23:38] monster snake crawling through the weeds
[1:23:40] and i thought now knowing that this is a
[1:23:42] vision then
[1:23:43] he says then i shall see what this
[1:23:44] animal is or this beast is and it
[1:23:46] crawled up on the highway and as soon as
[1:23:48] i got sidom i knew it was the mamba a
[1:23:51] mama is an african snake which is the
[1:23:53] most deadly bite of all there is see
[1:23:55] there's nothing as poison as a mamba the
[1:23:58] snake of course represents death
[1:24:01] so here he is he goes into a vision and
[1:24:04] he sees this mama the greatest threat
[1:24:06] the greatest the threat to life in
[1:24:09] africa is the black mamba and we find
[1:24:11] that the mama like cancer is the most
[1:24:13] deadly bite and it's instantaneous debt
[1:24:15] as soon as it strikes you and he finds
[1:24:17] now he goes now the snake of course
[1:24:19] represents sin and we know that there's
[1:24:21] only one sin and that's the sin of
[1:24:23] unbelief so that's the thing brother
[1:24:25] brahma is trying to get us away from is
[1:24:27] get away from your unbelief because
[1:24:28] you'll never get anywhere with god if
[1:24:30] you have unbelief but if you can believe
[1:24:32] then all things are possible if you can
[1:24:34] believe
[1:24:37] see there was an overwhelming fear of
[1:24:38] the mama and today there's an
[1:24:40] overwhelming fear of cancer
[1:24:43] and if you've been bitten by the chance
[1:24:45] of recovery of zero
[1:24:48] he says now then it comes to mama he's
[1:24:50] death he's so fast you can't see him he
[1:24:52] goes over the top of the weeds and
[1:24:54] propels himself
[1:24:55] with the back of his tail and just and
[1:24:57] he's gone and he's gone he hits you in
[1:24:59] the face usually stands up high and
[1:25:01] strikes hard and when he hits you you
[1:25:03] just got a few breaths to your finish it
[1:25:06] don't only paralyze it gets into your
[1:25:08] bloodstream it gets it gets the nerves
[1:25:10] everything you just die in just a few
[1:25:12] seconds he says them native boys track
[1:25:14] boys
[1:25:16] you can say mama and they'll butt their
[1:25:17] heads together and scream because this
[1:25:19] death just is a few seconds when one
[1:25:22] hits you
[1:25:23] notice the parallel to cancer
[1:25:26] somebody get cancer and that's the first
[1:25:28] thing they just oh my goodness
[1:25:31] i'm not going to make it
[1:25:32] i'm going to die i've got to get my
[1:25:34] house in order i got to get these things
[1:25:36] he said he was on the highway and i
[1:25:37] looked at him and he looked angry at me
[1:25:40] and he licked his tongue out and here he
[1:25:42] come but when he got right close he
[1:25:44] would run up fast and then he would get
[1:25:46] slower and slower and just quiver and
[1:25:48] stop then something will hold him off
[1:25:52] he couldn't bite me he would run turn
[1:25:55] around on the other side try another
[1:25:56] approach from this side and he would get
[1:25:58] back and he would start and he had
[1:25:59] switched right toward me get slower and
[1:26:01] slower and sore and then stop and then
[1:26:03] shake like that and move back he
[1:26:05] couldn't strike me he goes then he
[1:26:07] turned and he looked at my friend and
[1:26:09] the way he went after my friend and i
[1:26:11] seen my friend just jumping in the air
[1:26:13] over him and over him and over him
[1:26:15] trying the best that he could he was
[1:26:16] striking at him he says i said oh if it
[1:26:19] ever would hit him it'll be instant
[1:26:20] death and no wonder everybody is so
[1:26:24] scared because when the thing hits you
[1:26:26] it's instant death
[1:26:28] he said it was just striking at him and
[1:26:30] i threw my hands and i said oh god have
[1:26:32] mercy on my brother i said if this
[1:26:34] serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him
[1:26:38] i don't know if brother branham saw it
[1:26:40] but i just can't help but to see
[1:26:42] the unbelief in this day
[1:26:44] the unbelief in this day and what is it
[1:26:46] trying to do he couldn't get the
[1:26:48] couldn't get the prophet he believed the
[1:26:49] word he just got up to him and it just
[1:26:52] slowed down and just came to a halt but
[1:26:54] it's those in our day now they're
[1:26:56] running they're trying to jump over some
[1:26:57] trying to believe and it's bit so many
[1:26:59] that's turned away and ran
[1:27:02] so many have died and gone away and we
[1:27:04] find this thing just come at him and yet
[1:27:06] he's he and brother battle just cries
[1:27:07] out he goes and he goes if if this
[1:27:10] serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him
[1:27:13] he goes then
[1:27:15] the serpent turned to me
[1:27:17] and i said that and i looked and it
[1:27:19] looked at me again and the voice came
[1:27:21] from above and said you have been given
[1:27:23] power to bind him
[1:27:25] the worst or any
[1:27:30] and i said god what must i do he said
[1:27:34] there's one thing that you must do
[1:27:37] you must be more sincere
[1:27:41] more sincere
[1:27:43] the days of play in church are over
[1:27:46] the days of just going through the
[1:27:48] motions are over we must be more sincere
[1:27:52] if we plan on binding the serpent
[1:27:54] keeping unbelief out of our home keeping
[1:27:56] unbelief out of our marriages keep
[1:27:58] unbelief out of our children keep
[1:28:00] unbelief off the job keep unbelief out
[1:28:02] of the church keep unbelief we have to
[1:28:05] be more sincere
[1:28:08] i said well god give me more sincerity
[1:28:10] and let me let me have sincerity and i
[1:28:12] raised up my hands to him again and
[1:28:15] there was a great something came over me
[1:28:17] and just lifted me up seemed like that
[1:28:19] my whole body was just charged with
[1:28:20] something and i looked at the serpent
[1:28:23] and then he started towards me and he
[1:28:25] couldn't do it yet and i said satan in
[1:28:27] the name of the lord jesus christ i'll
[1:28:29] bind you
[1:28:31] and he said then the serpent the blue
[1:28:33] smoke flew out of him he curled up made
[1:28:35] that sign like an s a capital s made
[1:28:38] backwards the and sign notice and which
[1:28:40] means this one or anything below him
[1:28:44] because he was the worst
[1:28:47] blue smoke fell out of him and his tail
[1:28:50] choked his own self to death around his
[1:28:52] head and when he made that backwards s
[1:28:53] that sign and as a conjunction you see
[1:28:56] choked it to death and the brother was
[1:28:58] free he says no now i say notice this
[1:29:01] he didn't bind him in the name of a
[1:29:02] message believer
[1:29:04] he didn't bind him in the name of a
[1:29:05] denomination he didn't bind him in the
[1:29:07] name of the greatest preacher or his
[1:29:09] favorite preacher he bound him in the
[1:29:11] name of the lord jesus christ and when
[1:29:13] the serpent was bound everything beneath
[1:29:17] him or below him was bound
[1:29:20] everything he goes i went over there and
[1:29:22] i mashed on and i found out i wanted to
[1:29:25] find out about it because it was a
[1:29:26] vision and i hit on the thing and it
[1:29:28] turned like that and it looked like a
[1:29:29] handle of a glass handle on the pitcher
[1:29:31] and just made a solid crystal and i
[1:29:32] think well how quick
[1:29:34] that blue smoke was life and everything
[1:29:36] had left all the elements and it turned
[1:29:38] the glass and then the voice came to me
[1:29:40] again and said
[1:29:41] you can also unbind him
[1:29:45] you can also unbind him so within the
[1:29:48] believer tonight is the power to bind
[1:29:50] the serpent and within the believer
[1:29:53] tonight is also the power to unbind the
[1:29:55] serpent
[1:29:57] i said satan that i may know i unbind
[1:30:00] you and when i did he started coming to
[1:30:01] life again wiggling and i said i bind
[1:30:03] you in the name of jesus christ and when
[1:30:06] it did the smoke flew out of him again
[1:30:08] and he choked himself right back again
[1:30:10] and turned the crystal
[1:30:12] so notice not only do we have the power
[1:30:14] to bind but we also have the power to
[1:30:16] unbind how do we unbind the serpent i'm
[1:30:19] glad you asked
[1:30:20] jesus said if you ask the father
[1:30:22] anything in my name i will do it
[1:30:24] and he asks us not to doubt
[1:30:28] but when you pray to believe that you
[1:30:30] receive what you ask and it will be
[1:30:32] given to you even if you could say unto
[1:30:34] this mountain be moved and not doubt in
[1:30:36] your heart but believe that what you
[1:30:37] have said will come to pass you shall
[1:30:39] have whatever you said father we know
[1:30:40] that this is the truth we watch it day
[1:30:42] by day there is no fault in your word
[1:30:44] it's because we can't be at that spot
[1:30:47] sometimes our faith won't move us up
[1:30:49] there we flustrate and doubt
[1:30:54] but your doubt is what unbinds the
[1:30:56] serpent
[1:30:57] that's why we preach faith that's why he
[1:30:59] said if you can get the people to
[1:31:01] believe now notice you bind the serpent
[1:31:04] then you bound everyone beneath him
[1:31:07] you bind the serpent you bind every
[1:31:10] other demon below him because he's the
[1:31:12] greatest threat
[1:31:14] and you do that with sincerity
[1:31:17] now when brother branham faced the
[1:31:18] mainly the maniac at oregon we all
[1:31:20] familiar with the story but we're going
[1:31:22] to tell it because i'm preaching and i
[1:31:23] got a few more minutes left so that's
[1:31:25] all great so we find here here he is
[1:31:27] preaching to an audience of 6 600
[1:31:29] million or 600 people he's got a
[1:31:31] platform full of preachers
[1:31:33] this maniac just broke some man's jaw
[1:31:35] broke his shoulder walks out on a
[1:31:36] platform threatening brother brown's
[1:31:38] life all the men on the platform leave
[1:31:41] brother said it was 250 men on the
[1:31:42] platform every minister ran because they
[1:31:45] knew this man was a maniac and what he
[1:31:46] had just done
[1:31:48] here he says i weigh 128 pounds this man
[1:31:50] made may weigh 275 to 300 pounds and he
[1:31:53] said he came out and he began to
[1:31:55] threaten and he began to threaten and he
[1:31:57] goes there's 600 600 people sitting
[1:31:59] there besides what was out in the street
[1:32:01] everybody was breathless he goes i
[1:32:03] weighed 128 pounds and he turned around
[1:32:06] and he said you better know he goes you
[1:32:08] better brother man said you better know
[1:32:09] what you're talking about when you when
[1:32:11] you face that he goes tonight i'll prove
[1:32:13] that there's nothing to you but you're a
[1:32:15] hypocrite notice this man was making a
[1:32:17] challenge
[1:32:20] he was making a challenge brother never
[1:32:22] said a word
[1:32:23] he says tonight because you made this
[1:32:25] challenge now he was he was thinking
[1:32:27] about this man and he says in different
[1:32:28] places here and i want to try to get to
[1:32:30] where i want to what i really want to
[1:32:31] hone into tonight but brother brown says
[1:32:34] you know if you can have sincerity you
[1:32:36] can have love for the people
[1:32:39] he said this man didn't know me
[1:32:42] because this man was probably a father
[1:32:44] and he probably had a wife and he
[1:32:45] probably had children back home and he
[1:32:47] you know he's not against me and he had
[1:32:49] a love for this maniac
[1:32:52] and so we find love and hatred was about
[1:32:54] to be in a battle a warfare
[1:32:57] and he says now he goes and about then i
[1:32:59] heard something talking it was myself
[1:33:02] and it said because that you have
[1:33:03] challenged the spirit of god tonight
[1:33:06] you'll fall over my feet
[1:33:09] see he says in the presence of almighty
[1:33:11] god no matter what it is he's the lord
[1:33:13] in the very present help in a time of
[1:33:15] trouble don't be afraid stand on your
[1:33:18] ground when god moves god is god
[1:33:24] now i believe sister jessica and sister
[1:33:26] lydia witnessed that this past camp
[1:33:28] meeting when we had a girl who was
[1:33:30] possessed with the devil and they took
[1:33:31] her to the back and i was able to i was
[1:33:34] not able but i went back with her and
[1:33:35] they called the two sisters to come back
[1:33:37] there with us and it took everything in
[1:33:39] our power three human beings to hold her
[1:33:42] down and to keep her contained she was
[1:33:44] one supernatural strength
[1:33:47] and she was arching back and moaning and
[1:33:49] beginning to foam at the mouth like a
[1:33:51] a rabie dog i mean it was just an awful
[1:33:53] sort and after an hour of just working
[1:33:55] with her and working with her and
[1:33:56] working with her finally getting her
[1:33:57] come to herself brother matt came in
[1:33:59] brother mcgary came in and we found god
[1:34:02] began to move and god began to deal with
[1:34:04] her and we got her to a place where she
[1:34:06] exposed everything that was going on but
[1:34:08] not only that she had to get to a place
[1:34:09] of repentance
[1:34:13] and then another testament i believe
[1:34:15] brother tim told you guys just the other
[1:34:17] day the one on sunday morning i go over
[1:34:18] there and begin to pray for her and that
[1:34:20] devil i just began to say a little
[1:34:22] simple prayer you know go back in and
[1:34:23] just try and i just you know hey this
[1:34:25] spirit of fear and torment you know it
[1:34:27] can't stay and as soon as i did the
[1:34:29] thing because it spoke out i don't like
[1:34:31] you i don't like you i said well good i
[1:34:35] don't like you either
[1:34:37] the feelings are very mutual
[1:34:39] but i already dealt with this young lady
[1:34:41] before and i've already dealt with the
[1:34:43] spirit on her before but this was a
[1:34:44] little bit different but notice this
[1:34:46] spirit now was trying to get his bluff
[1:34:48] in by speaking out of her
[1:34:50] the other one you couldn't get her to
[1:34:52] say anything she was just just
[1:34:54] uncontrollable just arching and
[1:34:56] everything but yet you got to know like
[1:34:58] the prophet of god you've got to know
[1:34:59] where you stand when you face off with
[1:35:01] those things now if i wouldn't have have
[1:35:03] the holy ghost that thing would have
[1:35:04] looked at me and said you're a hypocrite
[1:35:06] and done whatever it wanted to do with
[1:35:07] me but it looked at me and says i don't
[1:35:10] like you you know how confident i felt i
[1:35:14] said oh buddy well get ready because
[1:35:16] you're about to come out
[1:35:18] because i know my position as a son of
[1:35:20] god and not only that i know my
[1:35:22] commission that we should cast out
[1:35:24] devils she wanted to be free she didn't
[1:35:26] want this thing to harbor inside of her
[1:35:28] and we began to pray and we cast that
[1:35:30] thing out and she went back into service
[1:35:32] and she was completely fine worshipped
[1:35:34] the lord gave testimony the next week
[1:35:36] but see because these signs are still
[1:35:38] following believers
[1:35:40] and when this enemy made it uh made a
[1:35:42] boast or made a challenge to brother
[1:35:44] branham he didn't make a challenge to
[1:35:45] brother branham that chief of that devil
[1:35:48] made a challenge to the holy spirit and
[1:35:50] the holy spirit and brother battle
[1:35:52] accepted the challenge and it says
[1:35:53] you'll fall over my feet he says i'll
[1:35:56] show you whose feet off all over and he
[1:35:58] went to swing at brother branham and he
[1:35:59] began to turn around and turn around and
[1:36:01] he fell over his feet pinned to his feet
[1:36:03] and the little policeman said is he
[1:36:05] healed is he delivered he said no he
[1:36:07] worships that thing because he thinks
[1:36:10] he's right
[1:36:12] notice he worships it he couldn't get
[1:36:15] free because he thinks he's right if he
[1:36:17] would have ever repented and said i'm
[1:36:19] wrong he would have been delivered
[1:36:21] that's why you got to get him to
[1:36:22] repentance that's why you got to get
[1:36:24] them to the holy ghost that's why you
[1:36:25] got to get them free not only to expose
[1:36:27] what's there but to get them to say i'm
[1:36:29] sorry god i'm sorry for my actions then
[1:36:32] they could be free
[1:36:35] brother says when that man when that
[1:36:38] maniac when that chief devil when he was
[1:36:41] defeated
[1:36:42] the tribe the chief of the tribe of that
[1:36:45] tribe of demons when he was defeated he
[1:36:48] says everybody he said the chief man
[1:36:50] defeated just just begin to raise up out
[1:36:52] of the wheelchairs out of the cars out
[1:36:54] of the stretchers everything else to
[1:36:56] walk see what was it he said the meeting
[1:36:59] was over everybody was healed and walked
[1:37:01] out while when satan was defeated the
[1:37:03] whole audience believed with one accord
[1:37:05] and went out now satan is defeated in
[1:37:07] one case he said he's the same today
[1:37:09] he's defeated in every case and if we
[1:37:11] can defeat cancer and cancer has been
[1:37:14] defeated then you can divide the cancer
[1:37:16] the worst are in it nothing will stand
[1:37:18] before the believer's prayer not even
[1:37:21] cancer
[1:37:23] but it takes sincerity
[1:37:26] sincerity binds the serpent and when you
[1:37:28] bind the serpent everything below it is
[1:37:31] defeated
[1:37:32] everything you can put your foot on it
[1:37:34] as a son and daughter of god and tread
[1:37:36] on serpents
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:41] see
[1:37:42] and he said the greatest devil and the
[1:37:44] chief of all devils is unbelief and
[1:37:46] there's only one sin
[1:37:49] and there's no other sin but unbelief
[1:37:51] he said that chief of that tribe of
[1:37:53] demons made a challenge and lost
[1:37:56] he said you see and that's when the
[1:37:58] spirit of god struck the building and
[1:38:00] everything was healed
[1:38:03] because the chief
[1:38:05] the main one was bound
[1:38:08] but it took sincerity
[1:38:10] he loved the man
[1:38:13] but the man the spirit in the man made a
[1:38:15] challenge to his god
[1:38:17] and his god accepted the challenge and
[1:38:20] i'm here to tell you god is here to
[1:38:21] accept the challenge on your behalf
[1:38:23] tonight
[1:38:24] god is here to accept the challenge he
[1:38:27] says the devil made a chalice and the
[1:38:28] holy spirit challenged him back
[1:38:30] oh i'm so glad to know that i'm so glad
[1:38:32] god sent us a prophet that i put this in
[1:38:34] here so that we as a believer when we
[1:38:36] face our most difficult moments and the
[1:38:37] devil's making a challenge to your
[1:38:39] family he's making a challenge to your
[1:38:40] home he's making a challenge against
[1:38:42] your kids you got a promise that there's
[1:38:43] a holy ghost in the land today there's
[1:38:45] the holy ghost is being preached in the
[1:38:46] church and he will accept that challenge
[1:38:48] i'm going to have a young person that's
[1:38:50] going to rise up a little to see and
[1:38:52] they're going to believe me and they're
[1:38:53] going to take me at my word
[1:38:57] i'm declaring to you tonight is the
[1:38:58] church of the living god we have been
[1:39:00] given the authority

[1:39:10] the worst
[1:39:11] or any

[1:39:16] not even cancer i want the musicians to
[1:39:17] start making their way back
