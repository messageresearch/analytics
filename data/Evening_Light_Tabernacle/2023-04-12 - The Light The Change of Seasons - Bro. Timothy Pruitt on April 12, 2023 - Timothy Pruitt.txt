moments that we have need of in the situations uh this many may know but sister Ruth had a MRI yesterday and she's been having some severe hormone imbalances that the doctors were figuring come from the pituitary gland in her brain it was certain that she would have a growth there and so they sent for her for in for the MRI but they didn't find nothing there but they did fine on the other side of her brain an audited he called an oddity she's being referred to a neurosurgeon for further tests so we just appreciate your prayers in this time and I know he's faithful it doesn't matter if you're in a valley or a mountain or wherever you're at he's faithful and doesn't matter if you're swell or you're sick or you're poor or you're rich he's faithful amen and we're thankful to serve a god like that let's just bow our heads together amen just ask the Lord to come and take preeminence over this service father Lord we come to you today Lord so thankful Lord that we can call you Faithful not just words but Lord we've experienced how faithful you really are and we know Lord you're with us and the hard times you're with us in the good times you're with us through every situation of Our Lives Lord we ask father you just be with us in each step of the journey Lord we know you're in control you know or you're uh you're more than able for any situation that we may face Lord you already saw it coming before it ever happened and Lord we just ask now that you give direction and Lord wisdom we pray we commit this service to your hands Lord no doubt if I'd ask for uh hands to be lifted they've been lifted all over this building Lord knowing Lord that you are mindful of every need and you know and you're there for every situation now we ask father you'll just come and take complete control tonight this this evening Lord and touch hearts and touch lives and Minister father strengthen us we pray Lord we heard just a few moments ago that we are warriors Lord and Lord we're here to report for Duty we ask the Lord that you would come and take preeminence of this service we pray [Music] turn to Genesis 1 if you would in your Bibles got a ton of scriptures to go through tonight so I'm not going to expect you to keep up uh we're just going to go through them pretty quickly if you what if you can hit that's fine but Genesis 1 and also Genesis 8. in Ecclesiastes 3 I'd like to read as we open this service amen how many can say God is good all the time amen all the time praise the name of the Lord it says here in Genesis 1 14 and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years and let them be for lights and the firming of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so God made two great lights a great light to rule the day and a lesser light a greater light to rule the day and a lesser light to rule the night and he made the Stars also Genesis 8 22 says while the Earth remaineth seed time and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night shall not cease Ecclesiastes 3 and verse 1 it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away Stones a time together the stones together a time to embrace a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep a time to Cast Away a time to rent and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace amen will let you be seated this evening I'd like to speak to you on the light the change of seasons amen this word season as we read here in Ecclesiastes 3 is a certain time or a time set appointed by God for its being and continuance or for some something's being or continuance which no human intellect can alter Amen in other words what God has said in place there's nothing a man can do about it it's a season it's a declaration a certain time or appointed time the day that we are in today as we see as the evening Shadows are falling will give place tonight and as through the night as it would go it again it'll turn today is it summer it'll be winter is it winter stay a while it'll be summer again but every purpose has its time and every time has its purpose the clearest Sky will become clouded and the most clouded Sky will clear up and the sun will burst from behind the clouds those things which seem to be just usual everyday occurrences are in the council and foreknowledge of almighty God punctually determined or in other words us a certain time that is determined and the Very hour of them is fixed it neither can be anticipated or can be delayed a moment amen there's a time to be born as we read in a time to die these are determined by the Divine counsel and as we're born and if time tarries we must die at the time appointed as he would say in Acts 17 and verse 26 and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and has determined the times before appointing and the bounds of their habitation so our time on Earth is already set by God amen Satan cannot add another moment to it or take a moment from it amen God has placed that there you know some observe that here is a time to be born in the scripture that we read there's some of some some Scholars look at and said here's a time to be born and a time to die but no time to live but his time is so short that that time is not even worth mentioning and of course soon as we are born we begin to die but as there is time there is a time to be born and a time to die so there is a time to rise out of the grave again a set time when those that lie in the grave shall be remembered he said it in jobs 14 and verse 13 He said oh that thou would has hide me in the grave and thou would just keep me secret until thy wrath be passed that thou would have support me a set time and remember me amen there's a time for men to plant a time of year as we're coming into the springtime as a time of planting and even in our lives we go through these things and we'll get through too there's a time in our life for planting there's a time in our life we're harvesting there's a time that Amen to be that it'll grow that things uh that have been planted will be grown will grow fruitless and useless and there in those times is to be plucked up you know we can continue down the verse but the point is everything has a time and has a season and in your life there's a higher power orchestrating when things happen and just as the son orchestrates on the earth when summer comes or when winter is decreed amen has set a certain time in a certain season and that excuse me that son is setting now that decree so also is there a higher power orchestrating when you go through seasons of your life just as the lights in heaven have dictated the season on Earth your father in Heaven is also dictating and changing the seasons in your life so in order to fully experience God's peace you know throughout the many storms of life we must discern and accept and appreciate the perfect timing of God God fulfills his will in each individual's life in his own perfect time now I want you to understand there is a time but it's not our time it's God's time amen God is in control so God fulfills his will and each individual's life in his own perfect time so we have to give ourselves to God's timing amen God knows the time that we're in and the time that we need to be in amen and so as we see in this Earth We're very aware of Four Seasons there's winter and there's spring and there's summer and there's fall uh you know as we say in Louisiana sometimes you can go through all four seasons in one day but you know all of those have a certain purpose and a certain thing that happens and I I got to study in a little bit on these seasons yeah and you know winter is what we're just coming out of is a lot a lot known as a lot of jury times and a lot maybe a lot of rainy times and a lot of cold times and and it's marked as being a long and dreary season and and and some people kind of like parts of the winter but many times it gets very long and bearing upon your heart but you know it is also I didn't realize this until looking at it is a time that inner growth happens in trees and plants amen God is even in those long dreary moments amen accomplishing something inside that may not see out on the outside you know we love to see the blooms and the fruit but amen if we didn't have that inner growth in our life you would never see the blooms you'd never see the fruit and so it represents a time of an examination of a heart or an examination of our motives or you find yourself in a winner and a dreary time it's a time that you set aside your life to examine your motive and examine your heart as a time of allowing God to make changes in us it's a time for a strengthening up and a maturing Springtime is a wonderful time of the year many of us love it it's marked as a time of cleansing you know we're at the time of spring cleaning a restoration from the difficult days of Winter the soil rotates as the refreshing rains it's a time of transition it's a time of but it's also still a time of pruning and regrowth it represents a time of joy and glory after a time of being dormant and going through hardships but there's also in that a time of pruning this is a time when God is shaping and molding you in your life summer is marked as a time of extreme dryness and extreme heat there's a need in this time for more water than usual to better sustain life and strength and the top of the ground begins to crack from the heat it represents a time of spiritual dryness a time of needing more spiritual food than usual to stay replenished true Christians come out this season though stronger Others May stumble sometimes permanently in this stage but true Christians will come out of here stronger than ever before amen because those roots begin to grow deeper and deeper searching for that water that is in the earth amen fall you know is marked as a time of harvest but it's also a time of pruning and preparation for winter it leaves leaves fall from the trees it's also a time of transition it represents a time of harvest when the Christians bear their fruits but more correction and shaping from God is required to prepare the individual for The Long Winter season ahead but maybe you find yourself in Winter right now but don't worry there'll be another spring amen whatever you find yourself maybe you find yourself in a drive time and or in a dreary time or whatever time amen don't worry those seasons are going to change again in your life but just know that no matter what season you're in God is in that season God is there and he's working all things according to his good and so therefore we allow the season that you're in right now you must allow it to run its full course you can't stop it you can't you can't take days off of it nor will you add days to it it's all in God's Time by God is a good god and it's always his intentions his intention to bless you despite what season you find yourself facing hard times will bring forth good character in your life if you allow the god to perform his perfect will in your life so we are not to attempt to change the season but we are to allow the season to change us we allow God to change our lives no matter what we're in if we were to stay in that mindset that no matter what time we're in God is moving and God is walking with us and this time that I am in is decreed by almighty God this is where Paul was saying Philippians 4 11 he said that I've learned in whatever state I am there with to be content I know both how to be a base I know how to abound whether in and in all things I've instructed both to be full or to be hungry both to abound or suffer need I can do all things with through Christ with strength in me so what is our source of power if it's not Christ where do we get our source of power from amen amen so it comes from him our our strength comes from him our life comes from him and so the seasons of your life many times may become unbearable but don't carry your burdens don't carry your burdens they're far too heavy you must hand them over to the Lord and learn to trust God's promise and God's timing and his power will give you strength no matter what season you find yourself in amen so therefore by submitting yourself to God you can trust him to bring you through every trial you can trust him to bring you through every circumstance you can trust him in your sickness you can trust him in your health you can trust him in your poverty you can trust him when you need him or when you don't feel like you need him you trust him no matter what amen because he will exalt you in due time is what Peter said he said humble yourself before unto the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time in other words in the right time the season will change amen but it's easy to get discouraged when facing a difficult season in life and how quickly we begin to think that the season we're in will last for eternity or we seem to be stuck in a hard place but if we believe we're in the hands of the one who decreed the seasons then no matter what season we're in he's in control amen therefore sometimes God is not not doesn't change your situation because he's trying to change your heart amen we remember there's different seasons of our life and we must let God do what he wants to do in each one of these Seasons Charles Spurgeon said it like this he said the seasons change and you change but the Lord abides the same forevermore and the streams of his lover deep and Broad and full as ever no matter what season you're in hallelujah amen God is in Sovereign control he's in control over ourselves the Lord God does as he pleases amen he alone is completely Sovereign there isn't anything else anything that happens to us in life that ever catches God by surprise amen I want the devil to know this was already together before I heard the news yesterday or the day amen nothing catches God by surprise this should give us so much comfort especially in times of great difficulty he not only is fully aware of whatever difficult season of life you're in amen but he has allowed it for his glory he has allowed it for his glory Psalms 135 says he does whatever pleases him throughout all of Heaven and Earth and in the deepest Seas saw Isaiah 46 10 says declaring the end from the beginning and from the anxious time things which have been done not been done saying my purpose will be established and I will accomplish all my good pleasure [Music] amen I will accomplish all my good pleasure Hallelujah Daniel 4 35 says this all the inhabitants of the Earth are accounted as nothing but he does according to his will in the host of the heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and no one can ward off his hand or say to him what have you done come on now what have you done job would say it like this we were were he to snatch away who could constrain him who could say to him what are you doing Hallelujah because he knows what he's doing he didn't get all the way to 2023 and get some Alzheimer's or some forgetfulness and forget what he's doing no he knows what he's doing and he's in control of every season and every situation of your life Psalms 29 10 says it like this the Lord sits enthroned over the flood amen when the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord sits upon the flood that's enough right there to just have a good old dance you may feel like the enemy is flooding over your life but don't forget who's sitting over the flood who's in control of that enemy has come against you the Lord sits and Throne of the flood the Lord is enthroned as king forever the lord giveth strength to his people and the Lord blesses his people with peace First Chronicles 29 12 says wealth and honor come from you you are the ruler of all things excuse me in your hand our strength and power to exalt and give strength to all now our God we give thanks praise your glorious name so he has power in his hand over every life amen if he says one says furthermore because we are united with Christ we have received an inheritance from God for he chose us in advance and he makes everything work out according to his plan so every season of your life is working according to his plan it might not be your plan but it's his plan it might not be what you was expecting amen what you was looking for but it's what he has decreed but God Is With Us in every season of our life I want to I want to drive this home he loves you so completely therefore his love out of his love he will never leave you he will never abandon you when you face difficult times you will never face them along he will walk with you through the darkness he will rejoice with you through the good times God does not send us on a hard path to find our way without him he is with you every moment and he's helping you every step Isaiah 43 says it like this I am the Lord your Holy One the creator of Israel your king thus saith the Lord who makes a way to the sea and a path through Mighty Waters Joshua 1 9 says have not not commanded you be strong and courageous do not tremble or be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go yeah Hallelujah so it doesn't matter where you're at he's with you doesn't matter if you're in Winter he's with you summer he's with you doesn't matter what season you find yourself in fear not I am with you be not dismayed for I am your God I will strengthen you I will help you I will uphold you with my right hand amen for such as God our God is forever and ever he will guide us until death Psalms 118 says the Lord is with me I will not be afraid what can mere mortals do to me amen the Lord is with me he is my helper I look and triumphed on my enemies hello somebody amen David was facing a physical enemy he was facing a physical Goliath and physical Philistines and physical whatever kind of demons that would anoint men to try to take his land amen we're not facing physical enemies we're facing a spiritual enemy therefore we fight a spiritual warfare so let's put it in our language the Lord is with me I will not be afraid what can any devil do to me what can any devil do to me the Lord is with me he is my helper and I look at triumph over my enemy oh come on now yeah that'll change your attitude in your season no matter what season you're in the enemy wants to come in those dreary times and say you're alone you're by yourself you know nobody cares for you nobody understands look at all this enemy well I want you to start looking at that enemy not with defeated eyes I want you to start looking with triumphantize and say I'm going to come out of this I'm going to move to another place God is in control and God has me in his hands behold God is my helper the Lord is a sustainer of my soul time is in God's hands far too often we get frustrated with God because we're not it's not happening on our timeline we think that we know better than he does and we get impatient therefore get an impatient begins to lead to depression and anxiety and we begin to speak the devil's language I just want to die I want to live I want to live because I know there's a great thing about to happen upon this Earth and I plan on being a part of it amen amen so but we get the depression comes in anxiety but God is in perfect control of what is happening including the timing of the Season you're in amen Ecclesiastes 3 11 says he has made everything beautiful in its time or his time Amen in his time and he has also said eternity in the human heart yet no one can fathom what God has done from the beginning to the end but he has made everything beautiful in his time but you need to look at yourself and quit looking at yourself with some withering plant and start looking at yourself at what God planted there that was a seed ordained for life amen you might be going through a dry season and fill all weather but don't worry rains are coming [Applause] amen what you need to start looking at is not the season around you but start looking at the seed that's on the inside of you that was placed there before the foundation of the world and it was ordained for life and there ain't nothing the devil can do about it he can't cut it one day short [Applause] you say well I don't feel very beautiful he said he has made everything beautiful in his time Psalms 31 says my times are in your hands deliver me from the hands of my enemies from those who pursue me let your faith shine upon your servant and Save Me In Your unfailing Love have a cook 2 and verse 3 says for the vision is yet for the appointed time but if it's a vision of God it will come to pass and you can line every devil up you want to and they'll not be able to stop it from coming to pass amen they tried it at the grave amen Resurrection morning they tried to seal it they tried to line them all up put an encampment around them but a vision that spoke I'll not suffer my Holy One Amen to seek corruption he said you Reign you destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up again amen and a vision has spoke over that body and every devil is trying to hold him in hell but when it came time for that Vision to come to life there wasn't a devil that could do anything about it there was a word that had spoken let me tell you there's a word spoken for every one of your lives come all children of God and Devils can try to Camp down and they can try to clamp down all they want to but the vision shall come to pass will be a bride without spot without wrinkle foreign 6 says for there is a proper time and procedure for every Delight though a man's trouble is heavy upon him if no one knows what will happen who can tell him when it will happen man's got it all figured out we ain't got nothing figured out but he does as we read in Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes 3 there's a time for everything and a season for every purpose so God's purpose will be fulfilled it doesn't matter how dry you feel doesn't matter how dreary you feel feelings has nothing to do with it churches go through seasons people go through seasons of life but God as in control of every season so if we'll quit looking at the situations around us and and all the things that's going on around us but but brother Timothy I'm waiting so long you know many times we find ourselves in a season of waiting we're waiting on the Lord to redeem us for my art to help us in a hard situation or uh you know maybe waiting for some Financial boost we're often Waiting for God for many things but it's in those seasons of waiting God is there he is using those times just to speak as if as effectively as he uses the good times or any time he is transforming us into the likeness of Christ and the times of waiting are not wasted amen the times of waiting are not wasted they are part of the process his process but as in times of waiting man we get discouraged and we're like well it ain't for me no it's time you just wait on the Lord and say God I'm still here amen he said amen he said him that knocketh and keep on knocking you might be still waiting but I'm still here knocking it's to him that seeketh and keep on seeking amen you might have salt but you need to keep on seeking amen waiting upon the Lord that is not a wasted moment so Isaiah 58 says the Lord will guide you continually so it doesn't matter it continually giving you the water when you're dry huh well praise the Lord restoring your strength you will be like a well-watered garden like an Ever flowing spring well I don't feel that way it doesn't matter what you feel like it's what his word said psalms 27 said wait for the Lord but be strong let your heart be strong but yes wait for the Lord Psalm first Samuel 12 says now stand here and see the great thing that the Lord is about to do but what if we walk away just before the moment you don't know when your season is going to change you don't know when the author is going to pick up the pen and write another line in your life or flip a chapter over you don't know but you have to wait and say God I'm waiting upon you I'm looking for you I'm asking for you to move you hadn't moved yet but I'm still here and I'm still knocking at your door and saying God I need you amen say listen Daddy's a mama's don't you ever give up on your children you don't know when the author is going to flip the script you don't know when the chapter is about to change you don't know amen when the season is about to change and they go from being a drug head to a believer in Jesus Christ you don't know when that moment is but you stay there until that moment comes 37 7 says Be Still in the presence of the Lord and wait patient for patiently for him to act don't worry about evil people who prosper and fret about their wicked wicked schemes you hear that well Fox News said this and this said who cares the good news what did it say amen because he said here in Philippians 1 verse 6 he said for I'm sure of this very thing that the one who began the work in you will perfect it unto the day of Jesus Christ Psalm 62 says God the one and only I'll wait as long as he says everything I hope for comes from him so why not he's a solid rock under my feet breathing room for my soul and impregnable counts Castle I am set for life put that up Mercy Jesus I know this is a different translation Psalm 62 5. God the one and only I'll wait as long as he says everything I hope for comes from him so why not wait he is a solid rock under my feet he's breathing room for my soul an impregnable Castle I am set for life amen glory to God we are set for life and not you say well I want to be set for life I want to have so much in the 401K I want so much in my back listen he ain't talking about that life he's talking about the eternal life I'm looking at a people that are set for life amen demons may be holling and people may be making all kind of evil plans but I'm sick for life he said well the American currency is about to go extinct I ain't worried about it I'm set for life see well there's wars and rumors of wars let them have it and blow this place up I am set for life is there anybody else set for life Hallelujah are you set for the eternal life amen major a major major uh announcement and got your ticket and you're holding the token in your hand amen that's what has set you for life it ain't so much in a 401k let me tell you he can evaporate just like that half of people's 401ks evaporated in the last couple of years it can be gone but the life I want to be set for is that life Luke 1 4 45 and said blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told unto her from the Lord do we have any she's here that's believers the Bride of Jesus Christ blessed is she that believe for there shall be a performance Hallelujah Exodus 14 says the Lord will fight for you and all you have to do is keep still amen but there's something to remember when seasons change and seasons of life change no matter how much chaos surrounds her you must stand firm on the word God is faithful he keeps all promises he is always with us he will never abandon us he is our anchor he is our strength he never changes and he is changing us into something better hallelujah amen don't forget he's always there Psalms 95 and verse 4 in one hand he holds deep caves and caverns and in the other hand he grafts the high mountain Deuteronomy 31 says be strong and courageous do not be afraid or terrified for the Lord your God goes with you he will never leave you or forsake you Hebrews 6 says we have this hope as an anchor for the soul firm and secure Jesus Christ Hebrews 13 8 is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Isaiah 43 says behold I will do a new thing and now it shall spring forth shall you not know it I'll even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert in other words he's in the mountains he's in the Seas he's in the rivers he's in the deserts he's where there's no water he's where there is water he's where you're on a mountain top and you can't do nothing but shout the glories of God but he's also down in the valley and all you can see is great impossible heels all around God is still there this is what are you trying to show Psalms 91 and verse 1 says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide in the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him what I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The snower Snare of the Fowler and from the noise of pestilence so in other words when the snare is there he's there when the pestilence is there he's there he will cover thee with his wings and under his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thou shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the air that flies by day nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor the destruction that wasted at noon day so and the terror he's there if when The Heirs are flying he's there amen when the pestilence is walking around in darkness he's there when destruction is all around he's there a thousand may fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come neither because he's there Philippians 4 19 and said with all his abundant wealth through Christ Jesus my God will supply all thy needs so when you're needy he's there another thing to remember is in every season his Love Remains the Same just because you're in a winner does not mean God don't love you just because you're in dry times of life that doesn't mean God doesn't love you love you and when you're in the spring and everything's beautiful and flowers are blooming and the birds are singing that doesn't mean God loves you more his Love Remains the Same but you know that is that's the first thing the devil wants to come at you with when you go through a dry time or a dreary time or a hard time or a financial well God must not love you like he loves everybody else look at them prospering he's got a he must they must really if he must really favor them and love it no he's just teaching you something he's working something out in your life it's a season you're in but it don't mean it's going to stay that way you know I've been in a dry time I see all these others been jab jumping and shouting and carrying on what about me that what does God love them more no God loves you just the same but what he's wanting to show you is amen listen one of the one sermon I got was in a real crazy place I had to say amen's on a Wednesday real early in my Ministry I was struggling I was struggling to uh find something to preach and so brother Aaron called me and said hey let's go to lunch he was in school at the time I think and so let's go to lunch and I said well I said man I ain't I ain't got nothing to preach tonight what he said I know he said I know how it is with study your mind gets all he said the best thing to do is walk away and come back I don't know about that so I said okay yeah well I'm hungry let's go so we go to the Chinese restaurant there and at Homer in Louisiana when they had one and we're eating there and we eat our dinner we get the little fortune cookie yeah hey brother Branham got one off a cigarette pack and I popped open that thing and you know what it said it said no one knows the worth of water until the well is dry it's in your dry time that you realize how important water is n't it's in your dry times you realize how important it is to be under the gusher of the Holy Ghost it's in your dry times well it's talking about that's where that sermon went to is with David amen he drank from that well of Bethlehem and he drank and he was there as a child he was there all kinds of times of his life but it was in those moments that it was surrounded and blocked off by Philistines that he realized hey if I could just give one more drink if I could have just one more taste of that water it was in that moment he realized the worth of that water that's why God allows you to go through sickness so you'll understand what is how much it's worth to be well [Applause] that's why it allows you to go through times of need and Times of hunger so you'll know what it's like to be on the other side and the worth of it all listen God has a purpose for everything [Applause] yeah God's love will never dwindle nor is it based on your performance Hallelujah God's love doesn't show partiality it doesn't falter God's love is eternal as he is God is love He Loves Us purely completely and perfectly Lamentations three says the Lord's unfailing love and mercy still continues fresh as the morning and sure as the sun rises somebody need to hear that tonight when you get up in the morning you see that Sunrise you need to think of the scripture he has unfailing love and his Mercy is going to still continue Hallelujah fresh as a morning and sure as the sun rise how many ever doubts that the sun's gonna rise so quit doubting that God loves you because the scripture says it says sure as the sun rise Psalms 36 says that your love Lord reaches to the heavens your faithfulness to the skies your righteousness is like the highest mountains and your Justice is like the great deep you Lord preserve both people and animals how Priceless is your unfailing love oh God people take refuge in the shadow of your wings First John 3 1 says see what great love the father has lavished on us that we should be called the children of God and that is what we are the reason the world doesn't know us is that it did not know him first John 4 7 says dear friends let us love one another for love comes from God and everyone that loves has been born of God and knows God first John 4 16 said we ourselves know and believe the love which God has for us God is love and those who live and love live in Union with God and God lives in Union with them there is no fear in love but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment the one who fears is not made perfect in love Galatians 2 says I have been crucified with Christ and I don't no longer live but Christ lives in me the life that I now live in the body I live by the faith of the Son of God who love me and he gave himself for me Jeremiah 31 3 says the Lord has appeared of old unto me saying yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee to me myself scripture says no one shows Greater Love than he that lays his life down for his friend we know what he did that's what he did for us he laid his life down God but God is good in every season and in every season God is good he cares for you in every season even if this season of life herein is hard he is carefully chosen what sort of season it is not because he's punishing you but because he loves you and he wants you to grow so therefore in every season it's safe to put our trust in God Philippians 2 and verse 13 says for it is God who is at work in you it is God who is at work in you both the will and the work for his good pleasure so when it's your season to come forth nothing can stop it when it's your season to change nothing can do anything about it it's in God's hands it's in God's decree amen and if you are a child of God in the seed of God Amen just like he did amen when he saved your soul and it was a decree over your life you know what that decree was of over that season of your life to come to him he said all that the father giveth me shall come that was decree in a season over your life a time over your life that you may have laid in the muck a long time and you may have laid under dirt a long time a man laid out there in sin a long time but there was a decree for a certain season of your life to come forth oh my about this time I wish I had voice to preach amen but listen no man can come to me except the father draw him and I will raise him up at the last day amen I will raise him I will pull him I will call him in his time and in his season this is out of the church age book he said but as many as received them to him gave you power to become sons of God even them that believed on his name which were born not of the blood nor the will of Flesh nor the will of man but of God Ephesians 1 4 said according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will so it's according to the good pleasure of his will amen see Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their Brides today a bride doesn't simply decide she's going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it's the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for a bride John 15 16 says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you Hallelujah so now according to the word the bride was chosen you were chosen to be decreed in a certain season at a certain time amen and there's nothing the devil could do about it he couldn't stop you if he wanted to he couldn't turn you around if he wanted to he couldn't make you quit if he wanted to amen he God has said all that God has giveth me shall come so just as the sun begins to draw upon the grass seed that is laid dormant for you for months and months and seemed to be dead and withered away and no life but the sun in a certain season begins the size a certain way and it begins to warm up the atmosphere and things begin to change all of a sudden now that ground pops out that grass it may have been stomped over by cows it may have been Bush Hogs it may have been torn apart but that sun has decreed it's going to live pulls it right out of the ground Lord glory to God you may be in a season of your life and it may seem to be all withering away and all going down to nothing but let me tell you your season is about to change the sun is Rose where there's a son of righteousness in the road with healing in his wings and he has decreed all the father hath given me shall come why are you coming you can't help it there's something pulling you from another atmosphere why are you becoming who you are you can't help but there's something pulling you from another atmosphere there's a drawing there's something taking place he said in Romans 9 and verse 11 that the purpose of God according to election might stand he said he can't read it no other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God so there's a season or a Time for every time for every season or purpose so God has a purpose and he has one purpose was take a bride of his own chosen you are here fulfilling the purpose of God it ain't your choosing no more than any of you could choose when you was born if it's going to be blonde-headed black-headed redheaded couldn't choose that you couldn't choose if he was going to be five foot eleven or four foot two you couldn't choose it hey Mitch has got to be saved too you couldn't choose it is what it is it does not matter you could not choose it okay maybe it's more problems say little people they got to be saved too but I find that little people come with big personalities and the Napoleon complexes and all kinds of stuff and they know everything know all about it I don't know why I went there but I did they got it all figured out now you got nothing figured out I don't care if you're seven foot eleven you ain't got nothing figured out God is the only decreeing it in his season he says watch carefully he said before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God because that's an object of worship and there was no one to worship he was only known as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind Hallelujah don't you understand God when he created the Earth he was creating him a garden listen the trees and all that are wonderful and they're beautiful in the mountains and this that and the other but you know the seeds that he really wanted to plant was his own seeds and he was planting them all out this one I'm going to put in this season and this one I'm going to put in this season oh that's going to be real good right there you know why because he's going to be born in a certain Nation a certain character and I'm going to be able to mold it just right and I'm going to be able to tear Satan's kingdom down look at all these seeds I've spread out there in laodicea the devil's made it so hard to live and so unrighteousness all around amen but I put them there for a certain purpose there's something on the inside of them that's that Eternal seed Drive of life on the inside of them they're going to come forth I don't care come on Devils open it all up bring them all down do whatever you want to they're still going to live to serve me that's that's above it he planned his garden no different you would sell on plant corn here I'm gonna plant taters here I'm gonna put this over here I'm gonna put Joe Adams right here I'm gonna put this one right here Paul you're gonna be over there Moses you're right here they all come up in their decreed season and there wasn't nothing Satan could do to stop them coming or to stop them while they were here Hallelujah anyhow he's a down to the century as we could go we can find Moses Jeremiah John the Baptist each one of these were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in its season then we come to Jesus to love us he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be now it says that he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with them in this mind and thoughts before there ever was a world before there ever was a speck of Stardust God had you in his mind so what makes you think if he's been thinking about you way back then he's going to forget about you now he can't forget about you he said no more than a mother could forget her suckling babe they're forgetting about him now but he said I can't forget about you because your names is engraved in the palms of my hand he said even our natural birth is based upon election the female ovaries produced many many eggs the male's firm it produces Millions amen and there's one predestinating life ordained or maybe two or whatever Korean twins trip whatever it is there's only a few that are ordained there's an intelligence behind all of it or other words what would determine whether it's going to be a boy or a girl blonde or brunette light or dark but with these thoughts in mind think about Joshua and Caleb one out of a million we heard about Caleb so wonderfully at camp but what was it it was an expression of God's thought in a season God knew in that season there was going to be Anakin's there he knew there was going to be a mountain there so you know what he did he said I need me a Caleb I need somebody that's going to stand when everybody else walks away I need somebody that's going to stand no matter how it seems to be everybody's turned against them and everybody's walking a different direction it don't matter give me my mountain he says your Jesus told them in the New Testament your fathers did he man in the wilderness and they're all dead those parents that died were necessary were necessary as forefathers of the people whom Jesus was speaking to but they perished yet they were the election of God naturally as Jacob or Joshua and Caleb were spiritually but to go on these elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which should be expressed in flesh in their due season but these the same elect are called by another name I'll try to finish here therefore it is a promise forward therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end promise might be sure is all seed not only that which is of the law but that which is also the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all Romans 9 7 says neither because they're talking about Jacob and Esau Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated and we know that we know what happened for the children being not born neither have done any good or evil but the purpose of God according to election might stand not it works but him to calleth it was said the Elder to serve the younger as the rent and Jacob have a love Esau have a hated Galatians 3 16 now to Abraham and his sea were the promises made and the seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is in Christ Galatians 3 29 and if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so according to Romans 4 16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he said Abraham who is a father of us all therefore he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but to rather finalize it he said identify the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed of children the children of promise and the promises it had to do with election and the chosen of God and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the Royal Sea are the elect of God they are the predestinated for known of God and we're in his mind and in his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed each fourth came forth in the designated decreed season and as each member came forth it became expressed and it took its place in the body thus this for the Bride is a literal spoken word seed bride so you will come forth let me tell you devil you can't keep us from coming forth there will be a body change [Applause] he said well when did I become seed when I had an altar no no you was already seen therefore you could be reborn for only this seed can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we can be quickened in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken but you know a seed or we can call them a son or a daughter of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son in fact a lot of true Christians are like the story of the baby eagle that was hatched out under a hen you know the ego is a type of a True Believer or the farmer took an egg from Eagle's Nest placed it under a hen but in due time all the eggs in the hen hatched out the baby chicks got along fine with the other the other hand but the little eagle he couldn't figure out what all the clucking and scratching for food and the manure pie was all about he managed to make a living but he's pretty confused about it all but in another season one day in another day from way up in the air mother Eagle that laid that egg spied that little Eagle on the ground and she swooped down with tremendous speed and screamed to the top of a voice for him to fly up to meet her he had never heard an eagle cry before but when he heard that first scream when he heard that first scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch out towards it but he was afraid to try and another mother that again that mother screams had a rise in the wind and follow me and he screamed back I'm afraid once more she's screamed out try with all you got try with all you got and beating those wings he hurled himself into the air answering the Cry of his mother he saw it off into the blue skies you see he always was an eagle he always was an eagle oh he might at one time acted like a chicken for a little while but he never could be satisfied but once he heard in that time in that season another cry from another rail something began to Quicken on the inside of him that's who I am that that's where I belong I never belonged here this world is not my hope I'm passing away through let me tell you Church in due season we're going to hear a trumpet sound and the dead in Christ is going to rise glory to God Amen devils are going to try to stop it they're going to try to build atmospheres to stop it they're going to try to do everything they can to keep her from happening but they won't do it because all of a sudden it is season in this time Dirk's going to be in a move and out of those old Graves gonna step some new bodies I'll continue next time on the light the season of change once a true son hears the cry of the spirit of the word ain't know that Earthly stuff going to satisfy him any longer because there's a seed on the inside those power is I sing that song I Feel the poor I hear the call laughs [Music] whatever season you're in [Music] don't worry it's about to change [Music] the devil's going
