[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] Try to make them all think I'm strong.
[0:13] Yeah, the face I keep putting on says I
[0:16] ain't tired. But these tears stained
[0:20] eyes ain't lying cuz hard. Nobody told
[0:25] me life could be so hard. A weary soul
[0:29] with a worn out heart that's barely
[0:32] beating. But every time I get that
[0:36] feeling, I hit my knees with my hands
[0:40] held high, saying, "Dear Lord Jesus, you
[0:44] know I can't do this on my
[0:48] own. I can't do this on my
[0:52] own. Lord knows I tried, but I'm good at
[0:56] falling down. Thank God you're good at
[0:59] picking me up off the ground. The
[1:02] world's going to try to break me, but I
[1:05] know the one who makes me
[1:13] [Applause]
[1:16] strong. Strong like my daddy always told
[1:20] me.
[1:21] So there's a place you can always go
[1:25] when you've got nothing. And then he
[1:28] handed me the one thing that's strong.
[1:33] It doesn't matter how old it gets.
[1:37] There's power in the words that's read
[1:40] in this old Bible. And when I'm
[1:44] desperate for
[1:46] revival, I hit my knees with my hands
[1:50] held high, saying, "Dear Lord Jesus, you
[1:54] know I can't do this on my
[1:57] own. I can't do this on my
[2:02] own. Lord knows I tried, but I'm good at
[2:06] falling down. Thank God you're good at
[2:08] picking me up off the ground. The
[2:11] world's going to try to break me, but I
[2:15] know the one who makes
[2:18] me
[2:24] strong. Oh,
[2:33] strong. I'm strong when I've got
[2:36] nothing.
[2:37] I'm strong even when I'm
[2:40] weak. Cuz the strong arms of my
[2:44] Savior are holding on to
[2:48] me. I hit my knees with my hands held
[2:53] high, saying, "Dear Lord Jesus, you know
[2:57] I can't do this on my
[3:00] own. I can't do this on my own.
[3:05] Lord knows I've tried, but I'm good at
[3:08] falling down. Thank God you're good at
[3:11] picking me up off the ground. The
[3:14] world's going to try to break me, but I
[3:18] know the one who makes me
[3:26] strong. Oh, you make me strong.
[3:34] [Music]
[3:34] [Applause]
[3:36] Oh, this world ain't going to break me.
[3:40] Cuz I know the one who makes
[3:44] me strong.
[3:47] [Applause]
