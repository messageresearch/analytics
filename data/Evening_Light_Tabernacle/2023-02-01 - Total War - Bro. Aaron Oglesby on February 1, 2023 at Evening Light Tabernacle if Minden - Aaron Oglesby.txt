Lord we stand here Lord humbled in your presence recognizing our own insufficiencies Lord asking that you would come and speak Lord these people have come out on this cold rainy night Lord and they didn't come to see or hear from me but Lord they came to hear from almighty God Lord and I believe Lord that that's exactly what will happen if we can yield ourselves Lord because you promised to be in our midst you promised Lord that you would come I'm asking you now to break the bread of life Lord to move me out the way Lord and to speak words of life Lord we each one have our own battles and our struggles but Lord we stand here tonight knowing that you'll never leave us or never forsake us so Lord tonight may we just walk for a while with you may you speak to us and strengthen each one Lord in our time of need we thank you father in Jesus name we pray if you have your Bibles with you we're going to get directly into the word and start in Deuteronomy the seventh chapter in the first verse Deuteronomy the seventh chapter and the first verse and it says when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whether thou goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before Thee the Hittites and the gergisites and the amorites and the Canaanites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites Seven Nations greater and mightier than thou and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee Thou shalt Smite them and utterly destroy them Thou shalt make no Covenant with them nor show Mercy unto them and I pray the Lord I add His blessings to the word as you take your seats we see here the Lord is is speaking of what he's going to do as it relates to the taking of the land of promise and I like here how he speaks in no uncertain terms but it is extremely straightforward almost as if this goes without saying I shouldn't even have to tell you this almost is the tone in which he's speaking in and he says when I bring you into the land there there is no wondering here not if and maybe if everything goes right and if we stick according to the plan he says when when I bring you into the land and then again in verse 2 he says and when the Lord shall deliver them before thee this is how our God operates tonight and I think we need to start operating in a not well if I'm Healed and if this happens and if my son returns and if my daughter and if we but when my son returns and and when my healing is manifested and when because says it's a certainty and it's a thing that is going to take place and and when our God speaks his word or whenever he he makes a promise that word is going to come to pass no matter what he has to do in order to bring it to pass he will move Heaven he will move Earth but he's not going to speak a word and allow it to return unto him void he's going to do whatever it takes he told Abraham there in the scripture that his seed would sojourn in a Strange Land for for 400 years but after that they would be delivered in that and that they had a land that they would go to and that it was going to be theirs and now there's an awful lot of things if as you look through the scriptures that lined up in the way of that Deliverance but that Deliverance had already been spoken and so it didn't matter that things came and lined up in the way things came and lined up in the way of their Journey to the promised land it came in lined up in the way of them actually possessing the promised land when they got there but let's listen and to put it in these terms Our God doesn't play games okay when he puts Something In Motion when he starts a war he don't play War he's going to war to win once he has spoken there's nothing off limits as to what he will do listen Pharaoh thought that he could stop them from leaving but it already been spoken they would be delivered so Pharaoh comes and lies up himself against almighty God and his kingdom is totally destroyed the Red Sea got in the way and thought it could do something but God looked at the Red Sea through Angry Eyes and the Red Sea had to roll back they needed water on the journey so water flowed from a rock they needed food on the journey so food rained down out of Heaven it didn't matter what stood in their way God had already spoken so he would do whatever it took to bring it to pass they reached the Jordan and the Jordan was in flood stage but guess what it rolled back and they strolled across it on dry ground Jericho stood in their way but Jericho's walls had to fall what am I telling you to night I don't know what you're facing but it's gonna move I don't know what's standing in your way but it's got to go because there's already been a word spoken over you there's already been a word spoken over this bride there will be a Rapture there will be Victory and God's gonna do whatever he has to do to bring it to pass you say but but you don't understand my problems they're really stacking up and the odds don't look so good hey I can relate but let's go back to the scripture here because God tells them there are seven different nations there and all seven of them are greater than you in other words he says not only are there seven of them but even if there was only one that one would whoop you but there are seven of them that could whoop you and they're all waiting on you these Seven Nations are greater and mightier and thou know listen here's one thing I love the strength of your enemies only magnifies the strength of our god it only serves to show how strong our God is the battle you're in is only going to bring glory to God it's only going to magnify how strong he is because he is going to bring you through that and as soon as he lets them know we touched on this last time as soon as he lets them know that they can't defeat them that they're too strong that there's seven of them and that this is impossible he follows that out by going but when I deliver them done to you but when you are victorious when I come and fight the battle when I do these things church is not it but it is when our promises are going to be fulfilled and I say tonight that he will withhold no resource he will leave no stone unturned and he will employ whatever force is necessary to ensure that everything that he has said about you and everything that he said about this bride will come to pass well brother Aaron is it going to be easy not a chance not a chance that it's going to be easy because we are in a battle we are in a constant War but the Lord said I'm going to deliver the enemy into your hands so it's not going to be easy but just don't be found running away don't be found laying your weapon now just be found fighting tonight and he says he will deliver the enemy into your hands and then it says you got a job to do Thou shalt Smite them he's going to deliver them but Thou shalt Smite them brother Branham says remember we are not on a picnic but we're in a battlefield many people think that when they become a Christian that that's all they need to do that that settles it forever as they are a Christian and everything's going to come easy don't ever get that in your head he says for I become a Christian to fight the good fight of faith I become a Christian to get in the battle lines he says no Satan will constantly punch at you now listen to this for those of us who get the wowzy wowzy Woos and think I'm the only one going through this and I'm the only one and I'm the only one here's the prophet of God saying Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on the Earth wow where's the good news constantly punch at you he says just remember that you'll never I know this is almost depressing you'll never have a Time because a battle did you ask to come to Christ to go on a picnic well you're sure going to be surprised because it's a constant battle I've been on the field for 31 years and I fought every inch of the way that's right Israel had to fight every inch of the way Palestine was given to them but they had to fight every inch of the way to get it so listen I hate to be a downer tonight but things ain't fixing to get better things ain't fixing to get easier but the same God that said I'm gonna deliver it into their hands the enemy is the same God tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't left us fighting alone it may not get easy but you're gonna win you're gonna be victorious you are going to overcome things aren't getting easier but that's okay because he's pouring out exactly what we have need of he's given us the strength to take another step he's given us the strength to overcome he's given us the strength to keep on fighting I'm thankful tonight that we serve a god of Total War and that's what I'm going to speak to you all tonight for a little bit is Total War Total War it is his attitude towards battle it is his attitude towards attaining Victory and he wants it to be your attitude as well whatever it takes whatever it takes listen he didn't stop short and send somebody else to do his bidding he said it's going to take my life then I'll give my life he says their healing is going to take Stripes then I'll take the stripes he was willing to do whatever it took to bring Victory and he wants a people who are willing to do whatever it takes to attain that victory of people that won't back up a people that won't give in of people that in the most dark and evil age when people are ridiculed and people are making fun of even people in your own rakes are calling you fanatic you say that's okay I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get to the other side I'm going to do whatever it takes to get there I'm totally sold out I'm totally invested because I want a total Victory and I'm telling you you're in a war and if you want to win it it must be Total War he wants a people totally committed totally surrendered willing to do whatever it takes willing to do whatever he commands even when we do not understand even when what He commands Cuts Us in the process [Music] whatever it takes tonight you can't allow anything to get in the way of you and total and complete victory what did he say there at the end of the opening verse he said Thou shalt Smite them and utterly destroy them Thou shalt make no Covenant with them nor show Mercy unto them listen you read this and I'll tell you it's time tonight to recognize that we're not playing games that we're not playing church this devil that we're fighting isn't taking it easy on you he isn't taking it easy on your family he isn't it taken easy on this church I think it's time that we sit that we quit sitting back and trying to out strategize the devil I say it's time that we quit sitting back and trying to out think him and out debate him I say it's time that we get ourselves ready for battle that we go on the offensive that we Smite him that we destroy him that we make no peace with him and we show him no mercy because tonight this is total Wars what we're dealing with here it's time we quit trying to to learn how to live with devils and start destroying devils it's time that we quit making treaties with the Enemy quit letting down the bars to make sure you know that some people aren't uncomfortable in the church time we keep the standards where they've always been quit trying to teach people how to overcome and get them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is total war quit trying to make peace through coping and cut his head off I don't need to cope with my depression I don't need to cope with the Enemy I don't need to cope with anxiety what I need to do is say This Is War there will be no peace there will be no treaty and take his head off tonight [Music] it's time to take the gloves off and go on the attack give him no peace give the enemy no peace give him no resting place give him no foothold and destroy the works of the devil brother Branham would say here what we need is old-fashioned God sent heaven-born preachers who will tell the truth regardless who it hurts like John who said the ACT is laid to the root of the tree and every tree that not bringeth forth good fruits is hewn down and cast Into the Fire we need preachers prophets like that who will bombard and use the judgments of God for ammunition to tear up this wicked condition that we're living in you can never rid sin by patting it on the back you can never rid sin by educating people our programs has become demolished and have failed there's only one remedy for sin and it's Christ is that remedy and not Christ through intellectual confession but through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to a new life and a regeneration that's the only remedy for sin only remedy for our nation is the only remedy for our church it's the only remedy for the people Total War he said there in verse 2 to utterly destroy and we see that word a lot as we actually read about the conquest of the Promised Land destroy destroy means to put an end to the existence of that don't sound like patented that don't sound like you need to to deal with this and cope with this to put an end to the existence of by damaging or attacking now I want you to think about the thing that's been hindering you and holding you and attacking your family maybe generation after generation and think about that as we look through these synonyms it says to consume it to crush it to dismantle it to end it to eradicate it to get it to kill it to shatter it to smash it to wipe it out that sounds like something I'd like to do to the things that have come against me I don't want to keep dealing with it I don't want to face it day after day I want to eradicate it I want to wipe it out I want to give no quarter to the enemy but tonight I want to destroy him completely brother Brown says but when he come and fought against them and taken from the people then God told him Israel vowed to God if he would deliver the king into his hands that he'd utterly destroy the land and that's a type today if God will give you the spirit the Holy Spirit utterly destroy sin out of your life move on nothing can stop the church they may call you fanatic they may call you simply to pack a Bible they may say that you're a Holy Roller or whatever they do nothing's going to stand in God's Church's way she's moving towards Canaan if you don't go God's going to take them that will go that's right that church there's nothing it's an irresistible Force that's right and God will move everything he said he will move everything so tonight nothing is too big that's hindering you nothing is too big that's hindering you no cancer no devil no family trouble there is nothing in between you and the Rapture that God will not move out of the way if you're willing to stand and declare war on it stand on your faith and not back up he will move it he said nothing's too big I say we ought to get ready for things to move not if when things are going to move now I understand that sometimes we get blindsided by things I understand that sometimes we don't see things coming so there's not necessarily a way that we can go attack that thing when we don't even know it's in existence yet I get that but for far too long I believe that we have fought a defensive War and we tried to counter-attack the devil or defend against his attacks and true we must I know the Bible says that we have to withstand the Wows of the enemy his attacks sure that's something that we must do I get that but Joshua wasn't sitting over there in his Camp defending his Camp making sure it was guarded good going have we taken the promised land yet is it ours yet make sure you defend the camp real good so they don't get in tomorrow is it do we got it yet well no you hadn't got it because you hadn't went and took it yet no you hadn't got your joy back because you hadn't went and took it yet you hadn't got your piece back because you hadn't went and took it yet you hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet because you're sitting around in a defensive position get up take the promise of the of the word and go get your promise and go possess your promise and go get what it is you have need of it's time to go on the offensive and quit sitting back letting the devil attack and attack and attack and attack it's time we start lobbing some of those Rockets right back at him it's time to load up your weapon it's time to pick up your sword and it's time to go get him boy it's time to get after him tonight and quit fighting a defensive War Joshua was on the attack I believe we should be on the attack tonight I believe we should be tearing stuff up tearing stuff down oh that's his stronghold tear it down that's in my way tear it down I'm gonna let nothing stand between me and my complete victory when's the last time the devil said about you he don't give me no rest when's the last time that was the devil's testimony about you when's the last time he said I don't know what to do with that guy I don't know what to do with that woman that's what I like about a offensive services not because you get offended I mean offensive in the way that you were on the attack I love offensive services I love services that put us on the top see defensive Services teach you how to cope with things defensive Services teach you how to live with it you know how to maybe not give up and hang in there for a little while hey and that's Noble to be sure that's fine if that's what you want to do but I like to go on the offense and say today on this day I'm gonna take your head off on this day you'll know there's a God in Israel on this day I will have my Deliverance on this day you will die listen Saul was a son of Kish and he fought a defensive battle and he said you know what David those days are over we just got to be defensive you know what we can't do that anymore as we mature Goliath will leave the valley no he won't well as we mature we'll grow out of this you don't have to deal with him today listen don't feed me that defense wins championships garbage if you want to win you got to score more points than the other team it's time to go on the offensive and say by his stripes we are healed come up here if you got a devil we'll lay hands on you we'll cast him out come to the Altar and get filled with the Holy Ghost it's time to go on the attack to go on the offensive so we can have it it's ours I'm going to get it tonight I believe in being offensive it's time to take back what is yours it's not going to change what you just digging in and sitting in your tent you got to be willing to go take it it's time for Total War Deuteronomy 12 1. these are the statutes and judgments which you shall observe to do in the land which the Lord God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it all the days that you live upon the Earth ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the Nations which you shall possess served their gods sounds like we shouldn't be going to places where they serve their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every Green Tree you shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their Groves with fire and you shall hewed down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place this doesn't sound very friendly nor does it sound very defensive but he's telling you you go do this and this is total war and you destroy it all you wipe out their names you wipe out their altars you completely destroy because if you don't it will be a thorn in your side Total War we're going to delve into a little bit of History right here I hate to shock you like that you know the American Civil War is such a fascinating study that goes much deeper than the surface level that is taught in schools and textbooks there are wonderful and Godly men on both sides and there were horrible Dreadful men on both sides but two Central characters today just to compare and to contrast for a moment General Robert E Lee and General William Tecumseh Sherman General Lee was considered the greatest and boldest strategist in the war many of his battle plans are still studied today in places like West Point he was bold he was Swift and he was daring and yet he was a gentleman even to his enemies now on the everyday basis that's a good thing you know they would say about brother Brown that you couldn't tell his enemies from his friends but this ain't everyday life we were talking about this was War when they invaded the north up into Pennsylvania the Army had strict instructions from Robert E Lee do not interfere with the lives of civilians do not damage the property of civilians these people are not our enemies we are not at war with these people we want them to see that we mean them no harm as a matter of fact there were stories that I'm sure like many down through time and down through history get fudged a little bit or or maybe exaggerate embellished Through Time but supposedly there were men that he had court-martialed for tearing wood off of a fence to build themselves a fire to keep from freezing to death because he said you will not touch anything that doesn't directly related to the Army and then there was Sherman on the other side of things other men had tried to outmaneuver the southern armies others had had the gentleman's approach they had fought a pretty War they had fought a poetic War a war of pageantry a war without altar calls a war without prayer lines a war without casting out Devils a war where sin isn't called out just the pageantry and forms of church services in a battle plan that doesn't offend that doesn't destroy anybody's ideas because that's that's their ideas let's leave that alone let's not bother that we don't want to offend or make enemies they fought a war that wouldn't get messy that wouldn't step on people's toes and officially in the United States government it was called the policy of conciliation in other words it was a limited War it says this policy meant where you are to respect the private property even of those actively working against you it's the idea that most of those people on the enemy side really aren't our enemies or let me bring it down to where we can understand what we're talking about tonight that's really not something we should worry about that's just a family trait that's really not something we should worry about that's just my ideas I'm allowed to have my own personal opinions so let's leave that alone because it really doesn't have anything to do with the war I'm just turned a little bit towards the negative I'll eventually grow out of this foreign and Sherman realized that in all of this the war wasn't getting won because it didn't matter how much they outstrategized and planned Robert E Lee would whoop them every single time and he recognized this war is going to go on and on and on and on so in 1863 he began to apply what he called the hard hand of War in central Mississippi in the Meridian campaign and for the first time Sherman would order his troops to wage a war of Destruction he believed that by doing so would remove all hope from the enemy I like that I think it's time that we remove all hope from the enemy to where they realize it don't matter what you throw at me it don't matter how you attack me it don't matter what you bring at my family you are not gonna win you might as well give up all hope because I won't quit I Won't Back Down I'm not going away I'm not retreating I'm not surrendering I'm going to win this war so no matter what you do you might as well give up any hope of winning because at the back of the book no matter how you come at me I go up and you go down at the back of the book I'm in eternity and you are in hell you can't win this war and tonight we are going to declare Total War and we are going to remove all hope you ever had of taking me but in order to do that you're going to have to be willing to die to self die to your own thinking and tear up whatever you've got to tear up and let him know I'll fight you wherever I'll fight you however but you have no hope Sherman's goal was to make Georgia howl I instantly thought of the brother Brian I'm saying why is the devil howling because we got the answer to his question he said he wanted to make Georgia how he says now listen to this we are not only fighting hostile armies but a hostile people we must make old and young rich and poor feel the hard hand of War we cannot change the hearts and minds of those people but we can make war so terrible and make them so sick of war that Generations would pass away before they would ever again appeal to it Sherman contended that the United States and its Representatives had the right to remove and Destroy every obstacle come on now every obstacle if need be take every life every acre of land every particle of property everything that to us seems proper that all who do not Aid are enemies and we will not account to them for our Acts I say it doesn't matter tonight what other people think about our war it doesn't matter tonight how you think we ought to conduct our war I'm saying I will tear down whatever I have to tear down I will preach what we have to preach we will say the Holy Ghost can have Liberty here we will preach healing we will preach being filled with the Holy Ghost we will preach the gift we will preach whatever and we will not give account to you for how we conduct our war but we will be victorious we will overcome because we're willing to do whatever it takes you can perpetuate War perpetuate War perpetuate War but I am in it to win it tonight a minute to do whatever we have to do I say tear it up if it's in your way tear it up if you need to burn it burn it down tonight light it a fire light your soul on fire get your house on fire do what you gotta do but win This Is War and it must be Total War [Applause] what all should we burn down anything that hinders any idea any ism any Doctrine any division that would stand between me and my full inheritance I'm going to destroyed Deuteronomy 20 16. they just laid out High there to treat all the people and all the cities on the way to the promised land now it gets to the cities that are in the Promised Land in other words cities built on top of your inheritance what are you supposed to do to the things that are on your inheritance but of the cities of these people wish the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth anything that has stood in your inheritance anything that has tried to stop you anything that has tried to hinder you or made you think you couldn't make it cast it down and destroy it tonight verse 17 but Thou shalt utterly destroy them namely the Hittites and the amorites in the Canaanites and the parasites the hibites and the jebusites as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee pardon me brother Brandon would say listen and we're going to get into some things here he says listen destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you he says he'll do it he says bring back the old-fashioned meetings you know leave Delilah alone leave the world alone that thing that Woos you off into little things that you shouldn't and little things troubles come up in the church and you won't stand correction because you don't have to you can drop off to another church and things like that in the early days when a man didn't cope up with the word of God they packed him out dead it says bring us back to Pentecost not Hollywood Showmanship but a wholehearted turn to God is what we need once more oh Lord once more he says again let me say this my friend you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you you know people don't have a problem with this statement as a matter of fact everybody in here is like man yeah it's exactly right destroy that devil destroy that enemy before he destroys me but see what they have a problem with is recognizing what the enemy is that's where the problem comes they toy with things they toy with unbelief they toy with complexes they toy with self-righteousness they toy with their ideas of how things should be not recognizing that those things that you're toying with want to destroy you see that's the thing about Total War and that's what Sherman was willing to do that none others were willing to is he was willing to look at things that look so simple and so insignificant and say burn that Barn down why it's just a barn it belongs to yeah it belongs to Bob over here but what Bob's doing is he's raising cattle and housing in that barn and those cattle are feeding the army so to you it looks like a barn but what it is is it's something the enemy is using against us to defeat us Burn It Down and he was willing to make to call out what we would call the uncomfortable enemies we can all say the devils and that's not uncomfortable but Total War recognizes the uncomfortable enemies it recognizes that things we had let lay around are benefiting the enemy and it says it's time to burn it all brother Branham says after a while when Joshua took the land God told him utterly destroy everything there is don't leave nothing now you talk about uncomfortable why could you imagine some of them Israelite women picking up a little baby oh isn't it cute look at it it ain't even got teeth yet Joshua said kill it the mother said oh I'm a mother I can't kill that baby and he said hand it here oh talk about uncomfortable but this is total war he says why it might look cute now but it'll grow up and be just like its Daddy you can't baby sin it's got to be handled not with gloves on but bare-handed oh it can't be that bad brother Aaron why can't I have just my opinions about these things why Why Can't This well how come that's considered so bad why can't we do these things oh yeah now we're getting to the uncomfortable that total war will call out see everybody wants to kill the devil the obvious enemy but people don't like Total War because Total War makes you deal with self now this isn't the way I wanted it to go tonight but the more I studied it just wouldn't come out of this channel so we're going to be here for a minute it makes you deal with self listen you have two great enemies the devil and yourself and if you put anybody else on that list I'll be the first to tell you got real problems but it's the devil and yourself and it's a pretty tough battle for which one of those is number one those are the enemies that fight against you you know everybody believes the quote destroy your enemy before it destroys you but then they don't want to identify where the main enemy lies and when you can't identify it as the enemy then you baby it we baby the flesh we want to be comfortable I started to say something about eating a lot and I decide we want to eat foods that we like we want to do what we want to do we don't want to be told what to do some of us have real problems with authority we just do and we baby it and we make excuses for why we can't do things and excuses for why we can't overcome excuses for why we can't be in church excuses for why our family can't be lined up and live in a Christian Life excuse after excuse and then we don't want to take accountability and recognize what the enemy is you won't identify it and so you let it live you don't destroy your own ideas and you let it live and you feed it and since it can't be you then others become the problem because it can't be you so then you have a list that's the devil and other people and somehow you leave yourself off that list this is total war now so others become the problem and you take aim at others instead of the two enemies that you should be fighting against so the devil gets a break because you're so busy at this one and hang grenades over there and the devil's sitting there going get him boy get him and he's encouraging you and he's whispering in your ear yeah he said that about you I know how he thinks about you and he told so and he's feeding it why because all the ammunitions going in the wrong place and he's loving it he ain't taking a single shot he's got you fighting your brother because you can't identify for a minute I need to die I need to die to self see we have to apply Total War to us brother Brown says God said utterly destroy the thing amen hallelujah what we need today and he stops and he says you're a baby and around with a whole lot of things you ought to be destroying I'm gonna read that again because I can't say that to you but he can you're a baby and around with a whole lot of things you ought to be destroying see there's a reason God demands that you killed these things not that he wants to hurt you he's because he wants to save you he don't want these things to rise up and overtake you down the road he's telling you kill it all lay down your thinking lay down your ideas lay down yourself lay down your human nature so that you can have more of him more of eternal life more of that glorious presence but as long as you're holding on to this it's gonna rise up and it's gonna kill you anything not dealt with now I was up later try to destroy destroy we'll rise up again you will see it again it always comes back I want to look at it for a minute here in Samuel first Samuel 15 1. and we're gonna try to get through the rough stuff as fast as we can but just bear with me because this is this was heavy on me it says Samuel also said unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people it's a man with a powerful position over Israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord thus saith the Lord of hosts I remember that which amalek did to Israel how he laid weight for him in the way when he came up from Egypt now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have I want you to pay close attentions to how God gives him very clear instructions there was no room for I think so's and I felt like and maybe we should have handled it this way this time lord utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass this is total war this is destruction but this is what will bring total Victory you can't have total Victory without Total War because a limited war never will wipe out everything but a total war will and Saul gathered the people together and numbered them into lame 200 000 footmen and ten thousand men of Judah and Saul came to the city of amalek and laid weight in the valley skipping down to verse 7. and Saul smote the amalekites from havilah until the cometh until they come as to sure that is over against Egypt and he took agag the king of the amalekites a lot oh there's trouble Brewing and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword look at this it's almost in a roundabout way it's almost an Eden like situation he just disobeyed a little bit I mean he went to battle because God told him to he slew a malachite he risked his life because God told him to I've been serving the lord 30 years God don't care if you ain't doing what he asked you to do you might have been doing it wrong for 30 years he went to battle next verse go back I don't know this just hits me in the midst of absolute victory in the midst of freedom in the midst of the spirit being poured out in a church service in the midst right there when you could have complete Victory we let the enemy live this one's having Victory this one's having Victory this one's having Victory this one's running and shouting and you leave and you take agag with you and you say that was powerful that was a service there was a there was a malachite slain there was victory in the house of God as you walk out with a gag come on now this is the opportunity to end it all this is the opportunity for total Victory and we're going to see here in a minute if we have time Lord willing how this decision would hinder Israel for years and years and generation after generation in the midst of deliverance we spare the enemy why do we do that because we think what we're holding on to has some kind of value we think our opinion matters brother Aaron are you saying that towards the lake no I'm saying that towards me brother Joe brother Tim we can't do nothing until we lay our opinions down God can't speak to us as long as we're looking at going well I think this and I think that now that's all of us our opinions when it comes to the word of God look I understand you're saying we're not allowed I'm talking about when it comes to the word of God our opinions don't matter we have no thought coming that's exactly right and let me drive that point home we're dealing with this we feel like that something we could keep has value and it says but Saul and the people spared a gag and the best of the sheep and of The Oxen and of the fatlings and the Lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them direct disobeying a word from the Lord but everything that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly now see once again it's easy for all of us to see the devil and go we need to destroy that we need to destroy that that smile that's vile that's vile we need to destroy that I see where that's wrong so that needs to be destroyed but I don't really know about these sheep what's wrong with these what's wrong with this what's wrong with the music I listened to when my mom and daddy ain't around what's wrong with this what's wrong with these things we destroyed all the evil stuff but we're just holding on to some of this little the problem is those things they saved alive were a link back to the vial and the refuse that song is a link back to that movie is a link back to that conversation you shouldn't be having is a link back to where you were supposed to be victorious we're supposed to cut down all those links we are supposed to separate those things we are not to lay our head in the lap of Delilah those things are a link they may not be violent refused but they are a link to that attitude is a link to that ism is a link to that idea is a link to destroy it let's see about destroying the obvious what they did is they satisfy their religious conscience but you don't satisfy what God has asked you to do you've only satisfied your conscience in the matter verse 10 then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel saying it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king for he has turned back from following me and hath not performed my Commandments and it Grieves Samuel and he cried unto the Lord all night now notice right here just quick as I moved on before I move on to fail to do any of it is to fail in all he says he failed to do it he did not perform my Commandments verse 12 and when Samuel Rose early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to Carmel and behold he set him up a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him now what's the attitude of a person in this place I'll just go ahead and say it what's the attitude of a person with a self-righteous religious spirit what's his attitude we've already been told by the word of God that he did not do what he was supposed to do Saul said unto him blessed be thou O Lord glory and church service Hallelujah blessed be the Lord oh he's religious he is glad to be here or glad to be streaming are glad to be doing whatever he's doing other than doing what the Lord told him to do I have performed the Commandment of the Lord really because that's not what the Bible said notice his self-righteousness look what I've done for God look at how it prospers look at me I I mean he didn't even mention the armies he didn't mention none that look what I have done I did this and God used me and God worked through me me me me me me me and Samuel said what meaneth then this bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of The Oxen which I hear and Saul said they have brought them wait a minute where does they come from it was all about me but now it's they they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and the rest we have utterly destroyed just like God told us to I'm still holding on to this I'm still holding on to that I'm still holding on to this this Grudge this bitterness this unforgiveness but I have the Holy Ghost no no you're saying I can't ever have a grudge I'm not saying that I'm saying the Lord will deliver you of it you won't hold it and it won't hinder you and it won't destroy your family and destroy this one and destroyed that one you all while going along going look what I've done listen sometimes things I don't know I just feel to do this this is going to take up some time but sometimes things come into our life and we can't help it brother Tim this cup this bottle of water is not very heavy but if I hold it for an hour it's going to get heavier if I hold it all day this arm's gonna begin to hurt and if I hold it long enough without setting it down it's going to paralyze my arm to I can't move it because it's been stuck you ever slept in one position all night woke up you can't hardly move it yeah it don't matter how heavy it is you need to set it down and give it to God before it paralyzes your faith before it paralyzes your walk before the next thing you know you're so paralyzed that all you can do is look at the faults of everybody else you can't even turn and look back at Jesus you can't even go back to the Cross Where Mercy and Grace and forgiveness is because you've held something so long because you wouldn't identify the enemy that now you are paralyzed they have brought them from the amalekites still trying to defend his actions still trying to deflect blame then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord had said to me this night and he said unto him say on and Samuel said when thou was little in thy own sight which thou not made the head of the tribe of Israel and the Lord anointed thee King over Israel and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then did thou not obey the voice of the Lord but did fly upon the spool and did evil in the sight of the Lord notice how God interprets what has happened and how his interpretation is so much different than how Saul interpreted it now look at Saul when we and it's a very dangerous thing and I don't throw this around Loosely but when you get a self-righteous or a religious spirit on you you will even stand in the face of the man of God and argue with him he says and Saul said unto Samuel yea I have obeyed the voice of the Lord wow I have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought a gag the king of of amulet and have utterly destroyed the amalekites he got so lifted up and so consumed with this religious spirit that even when he was pointed back to the word he would argue with it and he's in a very dangerous place here when he gets to where he evalues his own opinion over what the prophet says you're in a dangerous place you did not do as God said well that's your opinion this is your opinion on it I don't like it I have obeyed the Lord verse 21. but the people took the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in gilgal one thing I want you to notice is that Sauls will always Master failure behind worthy causes and worthy arguments they're good sheep and it's for the church service it's for sacrificing I did this so we could have better services that's not what God asked you to do it matter if it's not what God told you to do but he'll take and mask it behind this worthy argument oh and all the while everybody else is to blame listen when you get to the place when you get to the place that all you're focused on is others and what they are doing wrong instead of taking that energy and directing it into how you can grow and where you need to repent you can always Trace that back to a religious spirit it just is what it is and the thing is it doesn't do it will do no good for me to recognize it it will do no good for brother Joe to recognize it it'll do no good for brother Tim to recognize it until you're willing to declare Total War on that Spirit it will consume you you have to be willing to go I recognize the enemy I recognize it it is upon me and I have to do what I have to do listen I had to kill the old man I was this ain't for everybody else we've all had to do it I that man had to die my ideas had to die how my family thought had to die or I could never grow in the Lord I could never become filled with the Holy Ghost I had to lay those things down and say Lord I surrender all I leave it here I lay it here and I want what you want you say oh this you're attacking me no I'm telling you what every Christian that has ever come to Christ has had to do every single one had to lay self down recognize myself is not worth anything there's nothing we're sparing there's nothing we're saving my ideas are trash everything the way I used to think is trash and all I want Lord is you all I want is more of you to fill me Lord I want you to use me and I want more of you but I've got to Lay All of Me Down that's a everybody's sermon is what that is I couldn't come and say this is just how I am this is how my family is that all had to die then I could be free then I could be filled then I could have total victory in my life and Samuel said hath the Lord as great delight and bird offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King skip with me down to verse 32s I'm gonna try to hurry then said Samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites and a god came unto him delicately and agag said surely the bitterness of death is passed now what it means here when it says delicately is it actually means he came stately carrying himself as a king who should be respected he comes walking in as a king who should be respected and says surely the bitterness of death is over surely you know yes we fought yes I brought depression upon your family yes I tried to take your life yes I've tried to kill you and destroy you and bring anxiety and tear the church apart I know I've done all those things but surely now that those things are in the past you're going to let me Live Another Day next verse Total War and Samuel said as thy sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and Samuel hewed a gag into pieces before the Lord and gilgal what should I do with this depression brother Aaron Hewitt into pieces what should I do with this attitude you went into pieces what about this Rebellion you went into pieces don't tolerate it don't tolerate it anymore it wants to destroy you you've got to say I recognize what this is I will not be talking and letting it live with me another day but tonight I will deal with the thing I will Hewitt in two pieces don't let it Live Another Day strife and grudges and complexes and unbelief and secret sins Hewitt into pieces God will provide total victory but you have to carry it all the way out you can't stop short because wherever and whatever you stop short on will return we're gonna go into that for just a minute as we begin to bring this to a close procrastination with the devil won't work you can't hesitate to do all that the word has told you to do you can't have mercy on the devil for even a moment if you know you need to deal with it deal with it tonight because every day you leave it it grows stronger every day you hold it it holds you tighter it's paralyzing you not vice versa if temper is hindered you deal with it if lust is hindered you deal with it bitterness has hindered you deal with it unforgiveness has hindered you deal with it quit letting it lay there because if we'll fast forward Into the Book of Esther we'll find that Haman is a direct descendant of the amalekites that's the amalekites that Saul was supposed to destroy and he even carries the name of their King agag look in Esther three and one after these things did King of hazarus promote Haman the son of hamaditha the agagite he even carries the name of their King he is a direct descendant you say they slaughtered them all they killed every one of them but Jewish writings say that the leniency showed by Saul to King agag actually made it possible for Haman to appear because had he been killed one day sooner or the day that he was supposed to die then the great Peril which the Jews had to undergo what the hands of Haman would have been averted because it was in that one day that agag's lineage was able to continue leniency for a day and it was passed on to the Next Generation for the Next Generation to fight you know sometimes I think it's pretty selfish we won't deal with things because you're intentionally passing that thing and why I don't want my kids to deal with it then deal with it I don't want to hinder my grandkids than deal with it take care of the thing and quit showing it leniency before it gets passed on but I'm telling you tonight you don't have to be a saw none of this was to say you have to be a Saul because if you stay there right in the Book of Esther what you're going to find is that there's a Mordecai you can find a mordecai there who the Bible tells us in Esther 2 5 was a descendant of Kish he's a descendant of Kish and so what God is doing here is he's allowing an opportunity for someone to be a cycle breaker what he's saying is your granddaddy was supposed to do it and he's couldn't do it and he failed and your daddy was supposed to do it and he couldn't do it and failed but I ain't giving up on you I'mma give you your chance it's your time to deal with it it's your time to declare war Maybe daddy couldn't maybe Mama couldn't but now it's your turn to go to battle it's your turn to say this will hinder my family no more this will bring us down no more it's your turn it's your opportunity God hasn't given up on you it's your opportunity it's your turn to deal with the situation to say I'm not just gonna fight the comfortable enemies but I'm declaring Total War on anything that stands between me and my inheritance it dies here brother Brown says oh destroy that thing pick up that little old jebusite baby say he's so cute he grins so little so sweet he's a little heavy baby I'll just tell you the Bible says destroy that fellow not pet him and babe him he will raise up and be just like Daddy and the first thing you know you go to petting your sickness around and petting your little petties around and things like that because your neighbor don't believe in healing and your neighbor don't believe in the Holy Ghost destroy that thing let's go over and take the land Hallelujah he says there's the promised land she's flowing with milk and honey but before you get there you're gonna go through all these hivites and Canaanites and everything but don't you bow down to one of them you destroy the things as you come to them stop building fire on the enemy's altar wished I was twice my size right now maybe I'd feel twice as good oh I like that maybe I don't want to be twice my size but I could handle feeling twice as good he says I wish I was twice my size I'd feel twice as good churches we bring this to a close what is Total War for Total War is for total victory and it's right there before us we're standing right there at the final push the final battles and we're not going to get there by petting Devils we're not going to get there by letting things live this is at the culmination of it all and he fought a total war so that you could be totally redeemed he fought a total war so you could be totally healed so you could be totally filled that you could be totally delivered he fought a total war so that you could have total freedom and he's looking for a people that's willing to be totally committed all in that's willing to fight a total war like I said we're not worried about how people think we should fight our war it's our battle it's our war to win if it's in your way tonight Burn It Down if it's hindering you burn it down we're called to destroy the works of the devil I call this church to go on the offensive to quit sitting back and taking the punches to quit sitting back and allowing the Devil to come time after time but to take the word take your prayers take committal to God take the Holy Ghost take those weapons that God put in Your Arsenal gear up tonight and head out to battle gear up tonight and head out there to destroy anything that would stand in your way not sitting back and waiting you the Bible says right there and we're going to close with this the Bible tells us that the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail and many times I understand that that we feel like that means as they come against us they won't Prevail but gates are a defensive position gates are in walls that is a defensive position so what it's saying there is obviously you're supposed to be on the attack because when you come up against the Gate of sickness it will not Prevail when you come up the gate of depression it will not Prevail when you come and attack a gate of anxiety it will not Prevail he has no stronghold that can Prevail against you if you'll take the sword of the word if you'll go out in Courage and you'll stand there and say this is total war I'm fighting anything and everything that stands in my way in the way of my family in the way of my joy in the way of my peace in the way of total Victory what is total Victory the body change it's not just a down payment anymore but it's total war for total victory for the Rapture listen what does Total War do it settles the question oh let me tell you what church on Rapture morning there'll be no question who the Victor was there'll be no question who won the battle it's Rapture Day it's victory day it's going home day total war for total victory I say I want Total victory tonight I want Total victory tonight and I will wage total war on my enemies Hallelujah a few musicians can come tonight Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord but thanks be to God which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ church is calling us to go on the offensive if it's in your way Burn It Down it's time we tear some stuff up we've been too long worried about you know not upsetting this and not doing that if it's in the way of me and the Rapture I'm gonna go ahead and tell you just being real I don't care what you think or anybody in this building thinks I sure don't care what somebody outside this building thinks I'm gonna do whatever I have to do because me and my family are going to be there me and my family are going to make it and I sure ain't gonna miss it to spare a few feelings I just ain't gonna do it because I'm gonna be there I'm gonna make it I'm going to overcome I'm gonna take a Rapture I'm going to have a body change my sons are going to have a Rapture my daughter is going to have a Rapture my wife my family we're leaving nothing behind because we're gonna be willing to do whatever it takes leave nothing in your way don't worry about what people think if you've got to try out the god you try out to God you do what you got to do but don't miss it don't miss it for nothing take the
