========================================

We are always facing battles and it's hard to keep the pace cuz Satan never lets up in his fight for winning place. But I have the Lord to guide you every step along the way. So when Satan comes against me, you will always hear me say, "That's no heel for a climb. It's no battle for a child of God. Satan's already been defeated and the victoryy's been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary when he died for you and me. So now Satan, get behind me, for I claim the victory. Every time I try to do a little something for the Lord, Satan tries to block my path and keep me from my goals. But I don't care how high the heels seem to be today. I'll take my savior by the hand and he'll help me when I say, "Oh, that's no heel for climb. No battle for child of God." Satan's already been defeated and the victory's been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary when he died for you and me. So now Satan, get behind me for I claim the victory. That's no heel for a climber. It's no battle for a child of God. Satan's already been defeated and the victory's been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary when he died for you and me. So now Satan get behind me for I claim the victory. [Music] So now Satan get behind me for I claim the victory. [Applause]
