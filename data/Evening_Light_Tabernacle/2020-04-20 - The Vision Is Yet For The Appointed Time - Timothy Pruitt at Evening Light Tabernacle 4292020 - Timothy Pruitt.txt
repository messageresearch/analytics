as lord thank you for bringing sister Karen home from the hospital Lord and being merciful during this time father or we're just looking for complete restoration once again Lord we thank you for these things in Jesus name was turning up our Bibles if you would to Habakkuk to Habakkuk 2 and verse 2 hey man it's good to be in the house of the Lord and to speak to you tonight just pray these things can be a blessing as we was getting ready for Sunday amen these things were a heart but the Lord knows the timing of everything and so amen were just resting in that Habakkuk 2 and verse 2 and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry Amen we'll let you be seated this eden-like to speak to you on the vision is yet for an appointed time the vision is yet for an appointed time we know the Word of God will be fulfilled in his time and his season and it has an appointed time it's a it's not time as what we would think of is maybe days or years or months because God's Word is not depending necessarily on time or it is not is not needful of time it's an eternal thing and so you know many times we put a time or a time limit on what God says or how what we think or how he thinks God is going to bring things to pass but it's not our words is not or our thinking is not what we have or what we're trying to do is God's Word and the vision we're speaking of is not our vision for or what we would like to happen or how we would like it to happen or what time we would like it to happen you know we can have a thought and we can bring it into fulfillment but our thoughts can change and we can make that the fulfillment different than the original thought but not God what he sees or what he says or what he thinks he brings to pass exactly how he said he would do it and when you know when we have thought or hey you know have a thought it may take years to bring it to pass or months or days or there may be something that rises up and stops it but not God amen because what he says he will bring to pass and so time has no bearing on it nothing can stop him remember the Brennan would say it like this he said when a vision speaks for when a vision is ready for fulfillment he said all Devils in hell and all his forces cannot stop it amen it will come to pass the time is there the spoken word of God is ready to come to pass and nothing can stop it so and but when you know when God pronounces a blessing upon somebody or a blessing upon something it don't have to happen just in the spur of the moment you know as I said I had this ready for Sunday brother Tim mentioned this very very thought here are this very story here in his sermon Sunday but talking about those two ladies that came to the prayer line and one came for a Gorder and one had a stomach trouble and and the vision spoke to them and told him who they were and what they were going through and and told him exactly what had taken place and then it spoke and said thus saith the Lord you're healed now the healing didn't take place right it at thethe event right at that time or how that person may have wanted it or thought it or expected it to take place but if the word had spoken and there was nothing that could stop it from coming to pass and no doubt doubt tried to garrison and fear try to come or or the next symptom when it arose if he in the following days or weeks that it would get worse and and seemingly nothing was taking place but the Word of God had spoke and there wasn't a snuff symptoms it wasn't enough demons there wasn't enough power to hold that word from coming to pass and so you know as they would go home we know the story and I recounted again other woman had the growth and the woman who had the stomach issue you know she's been one of them when she went away she said well if the man was able to tell me all about me and what I was going through it and how it would be I believe it will be that way and so she went away believing and maybe it was five or six weeks later amen they come to a meeting and here was their testimony that that woman with the stomach trouble and she couldn't eat at all she would vomit up everything that she would heat him and every time she would confess I'm healed I'm healed and and the neighbors begin to rise up and say well you know you need to quit saying all that because you're bringing a reproach on the name of our Lord Jesus he's better be careful he said she said but look I have that tape and it was not him that said that part it was the Lord that called it out it was the Lord that Senate so she kept with it week's passing time past to mourn go but one morning the children went to school and and her husband went to work and she was washing the dishes and here she was standing there all of it wants a real cool feeling went over her she thought she never thought nothing about it but in a few moments she got real hungry and she picked up some toast and ate it she ate some other things that were left over some eggs that was their bowl of oats who was there and just having a jubilee and she got her big cup of coffee in and just really went to town having a good time with it and she waited a little while nothing happened and she said mom I'm feeling so good I need to go testify to my neighbor and she runs down there and the neighbors shout and she'd got up that morning was combing her hair and realized that not her throat was gone just vanished and she was shaking out the sheets trying to find it and they both begin to rejoice what was it the presence of the supernatural had come to visit them and nothing could hold it back he met here he had come the healing angel walking through the neighborhood and I believe he's still the healing angel tonight I I believe he's still watching over his word and fulfilling his word and it may seem like nothing has happened it may seem like things are going in the wrong directions and and way you know Church is going in the wrong direction what we thought was going in the wrong direction what were you figured how we figured was going the wrong way but it might be those very moments that we're in our homes and we're having the things and all of a sudden the feeling just sweep over us amen something takes place and and we haven't before we realize it we've had a visitation of an angel I believe that God is still visiting his people I believe God is still fulfilling his word amen circumstances doesn't change it symptoms doesn't change the diseases doesn't change it nothing can stop the fulfillment of God's Word amen amen I believe it's going to be like that one of these morning when things are going on the husband's went to work the children are on just normal days is going all normal things are happening normal things are taking place in a normal life on there but just another day but all of a sudden something that begin to change and we look over there and there's not old grandpa there's young grandpa there's not old daddy there's young daddy it's not an old sick for a woman that put up putting the grave or young person they got putting the gray but it's a new body sitting there and will be changed and you couldn't put enough Devils to line it up to keep it from happening it's going to take place and I'm going to be there holding the line believing for their body change hey man you know you can tell you said when Jesus come to the gates of hell this is another quote he says he and the Prophet said that he said I am he that the Prophet said would be here and it came to pass see God's Word is infallible thousands of years had passed four thousand years had passed but I'm here and my Bloods on Calvary there see God's Word it's still just as real he and he asked the question why didn't you repent and they were lost and doomed he said so will it be when they come to the Lord again God's Word will be infallible what he said take would take place will take place and there's nothing can stop it there's nothing can stop it no hindrance can stop it no matter how much time changes can no how no no matter how time changed no matter how people change no matter how preachers changed no matter how teachers changed God's Word will remain the same it's going to come to pass he will be here he will come in his glory with all of his angels God's Word said so hallelujah hallelujah you know he was speaking about when in India there and that blind man came up there and it came up for prayer and he saw him just standing right over him and he meant whirling in a vision right above them and he was looking around and laughing looking at his hands with his hands up he's at all my nothing's gonna stop it then hallelujah have you higher have you been seen in the vision hey man have you been seen in the vision of God's Word amen I believe that we haven't been seen in the vision of God by with our heads down and our bowed down and depression and fear and cancer I want you to understand in God's very vision depression is not there in God's vision cancer is not there in God's vision sugar diabetes or high blood pressure or whatever demon you want to name tonight in that vision of God's mind before the foundation of the world none of that is there Amen he would ask job job's vision was an ass cheap jokes vision was his wife turning against him jokes vision was all distorted jobs vision was hauled down and depressed and word and houses happened to me Amen but God came and said I want you to look at a different vision I want to look want you to look at something that's beyond the ash heap that's beyond the problems that you're facing come on somebody that's beyond all the things that's going on around you it's beyond all of that where were you Joe when this morning star saying for joy was there any cancer there wasn't any sugar diabetes was there any balls there Joe wasn't any problems there Joe was there any of that there joke no there were in my mind there were sons of God shouting for joy Oh hallelujah amen that's the vision that God has and that's a vision that's going to come to pass and it has taking place and then enough devils that can keep you down hallelujah he's trying to put depression after depression and fear and anxiety and every kind of spirit and every kind of sickness upon you but ain't enough Devils that keep that from coming to pass he saw you shouting he saw you with joy in your heart he saw you walking in his mind healed delivered set free Amen a body without seeing a body without shame or sickness a body that came passing away and there's nothing nothing nothing that can stop it Oh hallelujah he said when that happens the devil's came put enough demons out oh yes like we said before yeah Amen hail ain't got enough if he had enough he had already put it out but heshes put it all he's got out and he still don't have enough he can't stop it a man Jesus said Amen when the word he said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said when you know it's the word of the Lord speaking that's why I could say to the woman had the big tumor and to the lady with cancer here the other night because it was a vision it compared with the word he's the same yesterday today and forever there's the vision hello somebody there's the vision he's the same yesterday today and forever by his stripes I'm healed there's the vision he men you say well somebody could see me healed amen and see me delivered and see me and run and see me walking see me whatever see me this then I can believe he's already sought you there this is the vision by His stripes you are held dust saith the Lord it has to happen nothing can stop it but the Word of God hasn't a win because it had no beginning its eternal with God and we anchor our self there the word is anchored there in you you are eternal with the word it's got to come all these things all these this world has got to come to an end all these things that are shaken no matter how big they're building a pillar has got to fall down all things is not of or against this word or contrary to it will move it has to give place because the word is coming triumphantly there's nothing can stop it God has done said so Oh glory to God when he speaks heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never fail hide that word in your heart and take that word and let it grow keep it in your mind keep it in your heart God's Word will never fail because he said it wouldn't fail hey man mark 11:22 as he said verily verily I say unto you have faith don't doubt if you say to this mountain be moved when that absolutists come to you when you're noted with that spirit that becomes comes beyond all scientific control out there before there was an atom or a molecule the one that spoke everything to existence when your soul is anchored to that there's nothing can stop it that's right say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said it will come to pass you can have what you said if that ain't an absolute to hold on to I don't know what it is but we have that absolute tonight he said I remember times when the Lord told me about certain things was going to happen and then I moved up to see it laying right there before me oh what a feeling hallelujah but can we not rejoice before even get there because his words said it's the vision that's already spoke we ought to be like that sister has he said she said eyes he saw spoke those things to her and he said I told her what her name was checked we haven't heard what our name is Emmys heard what your name is a man not timidly Prewitt Andrew touched her Michael Dexter bride hey man we've heard what our name is he's told us if I need he's told us of the answer amen he said what happened is she said she looked at Ensenada not oh no man could tell me that no man could tell me the things that you told me that has to be God and if God said I'm healed I'm gonna walk off here rejoicing well hallelujah Amen it's time we turned our faith to the things of God's Word and we begin to believe it as if it's already happened just like blaming just like Abraham did he hoped against hope people leave things that were not as though they were because God said so God said you're gonna have a son so he bruh have turned from his thoughts and his thinking as impossibilities and from his vision and how he thought he's going to bring it to pass and turn it to God and say God is beyond my control it's beyond what I can do it's beyond what I can think of what I can comprehend I'm placing that in your hands and God brought it to pass hallelujah I remember he meant with hand-drew my son Andrew when he was born he meant fighting for his life standing there watching the doctor had it delivered him actually was the pediatrician had come in there and it was fighting for his life there in Minden for they shipped him to Shreveport and he's trying to get oxygen to him and I was looking at him turning blue and purple everything else and just crying out to God asking God to move on the scene Amen in my vision wasn't very good right there and the devil had come in and told me hey he began to speak to me and said you know you must have done something really bad for you to be going through this you must have really really done something gods I'm angry at she's mad at you that's why you're going through they say all these thoughts running through my mind and that was what my look my thoughts were going as I was looking at I'm thinking God amen forgive me if I've done something but moved on don't let an innocent baby suffer because of what I done but I beginning to realize is I found out later as I would turn on a oh station going down the road as I would go to Walmart to pick up a few things and there was a preacher that was reading the scripture and all I heard was abraham believed in God and it just went through me like a like I've been hit upside the head with a gong or something there's woo woo woo abraham believed in god i said that's exactly right and he's my father and if abraham believed you I can believe you and Abraham planted false and I got false words you still brought forth your promise and then all of a sudden it hit me again Amen I said the Scriptures begin to come to my mind and as God began to speak to me so what you need to look he's under you're under the New Covenant and I looked and I began to look in the Old Covenant under blood of bulls and goats Abraham's folks were listed but under the New Covenant there ain't a fault listed no hallelujah Amen I said and the same covenant applies to me and my vision begin to change I begin to realize I wasn't under this we're going through this because of punishment I was going through this because God was wanting to move on the scene for my behalf and to give me a testimony then I could have my own personal experience with God and God can fight my battle oh it's good to tell somebody about God fighting somebody else's battle I've enjoyed telling sister Linda's testimony it's a wonderful testimony remember there's nothing like seeing God worked for you God come and change your vision or what you're looking at or how you're looking at something and begin to turn you back to something that's eternal by His stripes Andrews healed and God came on the scene and it changed the whole situation around to a healthy young man today a man and this is where well the Brennan was walking up to this boy in Finland and he said but when a vision speaks the situation is already under control that's some powerful words right there and what we need to realize it says brother Tim talked about stories and things being Abraham's story or this story that's good if along a great-great great-great-grandfather but what about us is we have been spoken a vision by His stripes were healed I want to tell somebody tonight the situation is already under control God said so that is not my words that wasn't Isaiah word that wasn't a man's words that was God's words and the situation is already under control no glory he already knows about it before you got there before cancer came he already had the answer he already knew about it he saw it before it ever got there or sugar diabetes or high blood pressure or whatever you're going through tonight he already saw it before he got there and the situation is already under control because there's a word that's already has been spoke over you Oh hallelujah and this word was spoke before cancer was before any kind of disease was or any kind of depression or anxiety there is another word and in a man's word that'll fall to the ground and not be fulfilled but it's God's word that has to come to pass hallelujah it cannot fall to the ground this testimony was vision was seeing some several years before of the lapping rocks and the heels of the little boy that is going to be raised from the dead and it gets to it employee realized that he's walking in a vision oh my god many times today you are at the all day today you've been walking around many of you didn't realize the whole day you've been walking in a vision things are taking place God is moving hey man he said when I realized where I was like I said there's nothing that can stop it the situation is under control faith that was in my heart was anointed he's at all if I could only explain that said but only thing I had to do is speak the word and the little boy rose from the dead hallelujah but we get impatient we wanted to happen when we wanted to happen we wanted to come and we wanted to come how he wanted to come what we expected what we wanted how we want it to be and many times we we're trying to turn the knobs and and line it all up let God do it Isaiah 40 and verse 28 says hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting God I mean that right there is enough to make anybody shout the ever lasting God this God gon outlast your problems this God is going to hell last your issues and your situations he'll be with you when the problems over with the Lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary though he's the Lord a man of war he's been fighting for almost 6,000 years and he ain't tired yet come on somebody he ain't down yet he's not he's not depressed about it he's not worried about it he's not all of a sudden in 2020 of scratching his head oh hell nah I got myself in the mess I got people in the mess what am I gonna he has got it all planned out and he's not weary but he's moving everything according to his understanding and there's no searching of his understanding because he sees the end to the bill of the beginning to the end all the in-between he sees all of it and he's not worried about any of it we get to it and then we get worried about he saw it before you have years before you ever got there your tomorrow he's already got it next week he's already got it he giveth power to the faint who Laura to them that have no might he increases strength even the use shall faint him you weary and the young man shall utterly fail those that are dependent upon their own strength and said I got this I can do this on my own ain't nobody I got this ah I got this they're gonna follow sighs they're gonna fall weary and they're going to utterly fall but they the wait they they're wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength not them renewing their strength the Lord shall renew their strength the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall mount up with wings as Eagles all glory to God if I understand correctly that's the anointing that we're under is an eagle anointing and God is getting ready to snatch this bride out of here they that wait upon the Lord meaning of trying to give dates and times that God is going to come by this time God is going to do this by this time yea hath God said yea hath God said and they make God to be the biggest liar I ever seen in my life but it wasn't God speaking it was man speaking trying to lift his own self up come on somebody but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint well glory to God Psalms twenty-five one says under the Oh Lord do I lift up my soul o my god I trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph for me over me yet let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed which transgress with our calls show me thy ways o Lord teach me thy paths lead me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the God of my salvation all day do I wait all the day some 2714 says wait on the Lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait I say on the Lord Romans 8:24 says we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope but what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for but if we hope for that which we that we see not then do we with patience wait for it because we know it's worth waiting for Alleluia do you know how it is when you get a you get something in the mail you know expecting and get a little antsy about it but Amen if you know it's worth waiting for something you've been wanting that well you know you have a certain amount of confidence in the delivery system and things and I know things get a little hairy even nowadays but you don't have to have no worry with this delivery system this delivery system amen the ups and us beYOU know States Postal Service and the FedEx and Amazon and all those things are being limited and and calls the issues with shipping and all kinds of things delays and things are taking place amen but I want you to understand it means that some packages may not ever get to some package get lost and they only know where they came from where or where they're at they get lost you don't you're like how how do you lose something but somehow it happens lose luggage on the airline that happens but listen when God's Word is moving down the pipe things are coming things are moving it's going to be fulfilled it's not hindered by coronavirus or cancer or spirits of Hell it will come to pass and good things happen to those that wait for it amen you know he says you know he says their heavy hearts today he said I see I see stretchers and cots some of their sleeves up from the infections and their arms others I've heard that I've lost love it's a sinful and wicked world but yet all all yet all these things has to be mastered in the Lord Jesus who told us that all things working or working together for the good to them that love God and we're consoled this morning to believe that many of these things are to bring us to our knees and we like to think of the Scriptures that they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as an eagle in other words you're going to have victory over that issue amen you're not going to go down and defeat but I'm going to give you victory over that just wait upon it they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they that walk will not faint as the poet said teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait he said I'd let us today as we're waiting to hear from glory hallelujah I mean he's waiting to hear from glory and from the mouth of our Savior to the Holy Spirit that we will wait patiently to hear his voice speak loving things to us through his word speak pardons for our sins speak healings for our sicknesses and may we leave this building this morning rejoicing and saying like those that came from Emmaus did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us but we truly believe that he is a risen Lord as he was they found him that day and he is again in the midst of his people and we shall not be weary and our hearts will not grow faint but let us renew our strength each hour and do God grant it today Lord Jesus what a prayer I said then remember if he is his word is true and if he required you to meet certain circumstances and you did he's obligated to bring it to pass don't back off I don't care what happens don't back off of it but then preach that the other day hold the line don't back off so oh I'll never got never get healed I never got here he said that's weak don't believe that if everything's confessed and you've met God refined requirement you hold there's nothing gonna move it you hold he is and in you're sure and they they wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings of the needle they shall run and not be weary when you met his requirements that brings your faith to a showdown and God will come and meet your needs you know he loves to test us he loves to see the reaction of your faith I can't ever forget myself just said this other day I believe but just so struck me a brother Giovanni in New York been praying for those believers there whether you've on carry on the church was actually supposed to be there in the next weekend or so to minister for them but with the circumstances we've had to postpone it but his wife searching for a child and seeking for a child and constantly as Hannah agonizing day and night he takes her to the pastor with a dish full and does that his wits and some pastors talk with her several times I remember the story correctly and said did she I finally asked her this question sister what if he don't answer what if he don't give you a child then what said she just kind of hung her head all of a sudden her eyes come up direct and looked him direct and I said I was still loving serving anyhow her response moved the master he's wanting to know sometimes how you're going to react are you going to wait patiently or you gonna get all agitated and aggravated and just move off when the answer was on the way I remember my father's told this about Lydia being so sick with some kind of virus stomach virus you she was a little kid the high drayton i sucking in he's rocking her in a chair and praying Ford asked him God to be merciful he said also they looked down them over lo black eyes was looking at him and she just loves a little girl said daddy ain't God good it moved the heart of the master within a moment or just a little while she was completely healed God is looking for our reactions how are we going to respond what are we going to do how is our faith gonna act react is it gonna react and are we going to react with doubt or fear anxiety or depression or worrier follow away or what are we going to do are we going to stand there and say don't God slay me oh I'm gonna trust him though he take a knee Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord no matter what takes place I'm gonna stand on the promises of God I'm not gonna back up from it what God said God will - it's his word is not mine when you met in his requirements he said don't run off like a coward God can't use that there's no way for him to use it there's no way for him to answer you when you run off he only answers faith then all of a sudden you run off from it from the promise and he can't answer but real true faith I stand there being sure God is and you're certain that he is and if God asks this thing to be done to confess your sins and so forth and you've done it and your request has been made and everything is certainly your core request will be granted did you hear me tonight your requests will be granted hallelujah oh my he goes on he says see when you come to that moment where you can wait upon the Lord you shall renew strength you shall mount up with wings as an eagle he'll snatch you out of that cancer he'll snatch you out of that situation he'll snap that problem I think that you seemed so unbearable for you to bear god I move on the scene in a moment it don't take but a moment with him moving because when he moves he moves hallelujah sometimes they don't tape it just that's nothing but the truth all sudden there's something response on your heart say yes Lord no matter what I'm standing here no matter what I'm still knocking come on now have we give up knocking and we stop knocking every stop asking and we stopped requiring Western saying God move change the singing move on the scene come right now it's yours right now he said when you can do that and you can lay hold on the promise and you wait for word he said wait upon thee for wait upon him for the salvation for the baptism of Holy Ghost for the joy of your heart for the healing of your body for every redemptive blessing that he died for at Calvary wait for it and gotta bring it to pass hallelujah today the wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength not our vision God your vision not what we want what you want he said I love that he said that's what I've had to do all my life and I'm happy I had to do it I wait every day in every hour just on what he will do I have no abilities of my own no education to depend on I just have to depend on him an hour by hour I'm waiting on him to see what he will tell me to do he says try not to get frustrated to get frustrated when hundreds of calls are sick and died he said if you get all frustrated then God can't use you just sit still he's big enough to tell you he's big enough to tell you just keep on speaking terms with him he'll tell you what to do when you get there it's best to just carry out a commission and then let him tell us what to do after we get there just keep walking with Jesus just keeping one day at a time through Jesus that's all I'm asking from you the scripture says again they that wait upon the Lord let me go on down here he said see he said Lord nothing in my arms I bring simply to that cross I clean you promised it Lord that's the kind of condition the reason people think that I I'm an isolationist but in the room and over the side of the desert that's the condition you got to get into before you walk into this pulpit here because Satan is always dropping little imps to try to upset something oh yeah you must be trying you must be right holding on to the cross not trusting in your own ability not trusting in your own thoughts not leaning to your own ever light not not leaning to your own understanding but leaning on the everlasting arms claiming no intelligence claiming no mind of your own you're just opening yourself up and letting the Holy Spirit speak that's the condition God wants his church in oh I thought that was the prophet of God that's the condition God wants his church in and then the next sentence get in that condition hallelujah not our own ideas not what we want not our own intelligence not our own understanding but I'm leaning on the everlasting arms get in that condition get in that moment because Satan is always there to drop his little imps and say hi you just made that up he ain't gonna do what he said huh it's impossible i bla bla bla he's got all kind of bla bla bla bla bla and that's all it is is a bunch of bla bla bla bla but God's Word says and what God's Word says shall come to pass God might try and he will every Sun that cometh to God will be tried chasing but if we walk up and say I believe Jesus Christ as the Son of God he died for my sins rose on the third day wounded for my transgressions bruised for my nickel tees say what are you doing you're putting yourself in the vision you're seeing yourself in the vision oh it's all okay to say sister he was bruised for sister Elena's I can see that yeah he was he was wounded for a sister Mariah's oh yeah I can see that our sister cares yeah I can see that but he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my what are you doing you're seeing yourself in the vision hallelujah he don't do no good to see so-and-so in the vision that's great that's wonderful but what about yourself can you put yourself there he did hallelujah yes say yes Lord that was me all glory to God you say yes Lord that's me I accept it right now I accept he was wounded for my changes he was bruised for my iniquity and by your stripes God tests us we'll go through things but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength your strength will be the strength other words a strength will be given to you to fulfill the Word of God and it won't be your strength it won't be what you can manufacture it'll be his strength placed inside of you to say your sword accepted you know they just put out brother Michael different ones on the team has been putting out these different clips different sections or what's the name for them looking for episodes episodes the brother had bisko's testimony this is here recently the green checkered shirt come out it's powerful the venom in this quote to become with us to fulfill all righteousness a wonderful service wonderful sermon he's looking at going on a on a hunting trip and he tells about how that he was going to kill this these had trophies it was a big chocolate-colored a member of correctly chocolate-colored trophy and then a bear big silver shining bear huge mammoth animal and in there he also saw something that seems so to us or to what we would think very insignificant a green checkered shirt and it seems like out of all of that why would that be so important why how would that have such significance but something there stood out and he's going there and he speaks about how would they he saw these little hands that reach down to hold the tape and he hears a voice says it's 42 inches and he go getting so that's all he tells us tell us about it and go watch that clip is very very wonderful but as we know where they had he giving his testimony talked about he slipped he's gone that trip he he had had this green checkered shirt and he he thought well you know it's had a rip or some kind of tear in and it seemed like he didn't have much use anymore and he asked his wife just to get him a new one and but she saw him still you notice of course there was other things that you can hear the testimony of that hindered her Benna to go get her him a new him a new shirt but she saw that where she could fix it but not realizing that she was fixing it she was holding in her hand something that had been seen in a vision just going about everyday life and and making decisions but holding something that had to be in his place at a proper time and had to be in a bag on a certain trip and a certain place and and God's timing working these things out because God had already seen the months ahead or whatever it was did you hear that sometimes we think God only and don't even know what we're doing today God do you know what I'm going through today do you see he already is way interview God do you realize what I'm suffering with you he's already way ahead of you here she is puts this thing back in the bag mins and puts it back he don't even realize it until he's walking out and falls in the creek gets wet gets it in the cold and so he goes a brother man run back and change reaches in his shirt what does he pull his bag was he pulled out this green checkered shirt he's like I told my wife to throw this away and here it is and so he puts it on and even him not realizing what's taking place what's going on just going everyday about like another another day you know things accidents happen things happen things go on and he's moving right in a vision things are taking place right in the vision I want you to understand your everyday life is taking place right in a vision God's already saw this he's already seen it now you may not foretell every day you get to how he did that day or he's done other days he may but they meant but no matter what God's already seeing the day that you're in and the day that you're getting to and the weeks ahead in the months ahead years ahead if he tears whatever God already knows about it but it's so struck me as I got to thinking about this worthless checkered shirt you know you know I'm not trying I'm not at all trying to make brother ed to be the devil or anything like this he was doing what we need us would do get rid of an old shirt this ragged and torn but that shirt had been seen in a vision but the same in the same aspect the same kind of thought the devil wants to take something that seemingly has no value or to make it of no value or to tear it apart and rip it apart and throw it in a waste bin somewhere and say it is nothing but it has to be at a certain place home I remember me I was a green checkered shirt one time a man been tore up ripped up and we rented for the garbage can so to speak but somebody that rich and mercy reach down to where I was and picked me up and began to mend my life back and made me renewed me again to where I could be in my place in my part in a vision and I want you to understand they ain't enough Devils in hell that can throw you in a trash can somewhere or destroy your life or to take you down to something ain't enough Devils that can take you out you've already been seen walking in a vision homework Christian soldiers marching as to war amen we have been seen overcoming and Satan's very own easy hallelujah and some of you he's tried to water and throw in a trash can somewhere but God rich in mercy picked you up and said no he's not destined for a trash can he's not destined for hell that wasn't made for him and was made for you devil that was made for you devil but for this one he's in a vision this one's in a vision this one's in a vision not the world vision not vision not my vision God's vision and he places here in this time for such a time as this I say gird up your Lord sharpen your sword it's time we stand as soldiers of the cross and realized I have been seen here thousands of years eternity ago I have been seen here and while I'm here I'm gonna have me a shout and spell I'm gonna have me a joyful because also what has been seen here it's demons destroyed sickness defeated Devils washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah I believe that there's a power here upon this earth that will protect every checkered shirt hallelujah everyone that's ever been seen there by the vision of Almighty caught and I've been seen there you you you all
