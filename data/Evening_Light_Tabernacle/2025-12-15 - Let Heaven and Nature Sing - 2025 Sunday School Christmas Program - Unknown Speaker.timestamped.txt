[27:18] &gt;&gt; He is great and will be key.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; I will set [music] aside some hay
[27:27] &gt;&gt; just for his stay. Here's a manger for
[27:30] him to lie down.

[29:21] census,
[29:23] everything's booked. But on the bright
[29:25] side, we've got a room with an amazing
[29:27] view. Just look at the hills and the
[29:29] stars. It's [music] beautiful.
[29:32] I see. It is beautiful, but it would be
[29:35] a lot more enjoyable if I didn't have to
[29:38] see it through [music] the cracks in the
[29:39] walls.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Mary. How about when we get
[29:42] back to Nazareth, I'll build you a
[29:43] lovely home with no cracks [music] in
[29:45] the walls.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; That sounds nice. I think I'm just going
[29:49] to sit and rest for a bit.

[29:56] comes tonight.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, it will. And this swaddling cloth
[30:00] will be a fine blanket, too.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; It says someone knew we were coming and
[30:05] provided all we would need. He's Jehovah
[30:08] Gyra, isn't he?

[42:50] of all.
[43:12] That's the story of how Jesus was born.
[43:14] God became man to save us from our
[43:16] [music] sins. He was the lamb of God,
[43:18] the ultimate sacrifice.
[43:22] It's like my memory verse. John [music]
[43:24] 3:16. For God so loved the world, he
[43:27] gave his only begotten son. For whoever
[43:30] believes in him shall not perish but
[43:31] have eternal life.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right, little brother.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:54] &gt;&gt; N
[43:58] John 1:9 tells the true light which
[44:01] [music] lightth every man that cometh
[44:03] into the world.
[44:06] He was in the world and the world
[44:08] [music] was made by him and the world
[44:09] knew him not.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; He came unto his own and his own
[44:14] received [music] him not.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; But as many as receive him to them give
[44:20] he power to become the sons of God even
[44:23] to them that believe on his name.
[44:27] John 113 which were born not of the
[44:29] blood nor of the will of flesh nor of
[44:31] the will of man but of God.
[44:35] And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[44:37] among us. And we beheld his glory, the
[44:39] glory [music] as of the only begotten of
[44:41] the father, full of grace and truth.

[47:58] &gt;&gt; Wow, that was amazing.
[48:02] Whoa, we got little lambs, sheepies,
[48:06] shepherds,
[48:07] my goodness, kings, angels, a mouse.
[48:12] Oh, a a cow and a goat and a donkey. Did
[48:17] I guess it? And a chicken and a pig. My
[48:21] word, I tell you. and Joseph and Mary
[48:24] and
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, we uh I tell you what, y'all
[48:29] did awesome. Just really awesome. Let's
[48:32] give them a hand, everybody. [applause]
[48:34] Yeah. We're really proud of them. Really
[48:38] proud of these teachers, too. All of the
[48:40] time and energy that they put into this.
[48:44] My goodness. I tell you, I know that's
[48:46] hours and hours. And we want to thank
[48:48] you very much for this tonight. and all
[48:52] of you parents, what you put into your
[48:53] children. And these are just little
[48:55] glimpses of what um the love gifts that
[48:59] God has given us through his son Jesus
[49:02] Christ. And as we have this play, it's
[49:06] all about Jesus. And that's what this
[49:09] time of the year is about is Jesus.
[49:13] Because we don't celebrate as the world
[49:15] does. We don't bring in the paganism of
[49:18] the world, but we do it as the prophet
[49:21] did. And we remember this time of the
[49:25] year, a day set aside to honor and
[49:28] remember the Lord's birth. We know he
[49:31] wasn't born on Christmas Day on December
[49:34] 25th. We realize there's paganism that
[49:37] is around us, but that's not what we do.
[49:40] We are we are showing forth the light in
[49:44] this evening time.
[49:46] to show forth that there is a truth to
[49:49] Christmas that God did send a love gift
[49:52] to the world. And so, thank you for
[49:54] coming out today. Thank you for being a
[49:57] part of this. And thank you teachers,
[49:59] all that you've done, you young people.
[50:01] God bless you. We love you. Let's just
[50:03] pray. Talk to the Lord. Father, we thank
[50:06] you tonight for your goodness to us,
[50:09] your grace in our lives. We thank you,
[50:12] Lord, for the love gift that you sent to
[50:14] the world. that you did. You gave your
[50:17] only begotten son that whosoever would
[50:20] believe in him would not perish but have
[50:23] everlasting life. So we are asking Lord
[50:26] a special blessing on these children,
[50:28] upon these parents, upon these teachers,
[50:31] upon grandparents, everybody that is
[50:33] here, friends, loved ones that have
[50:36] come, Lord, to enjoy this little moment
[50:39] and to realize that everything that we
[50:41] have comes because of that love gift
[50:45] where you gave your life for us. Thank
[50:47] you Lord that you condescended
[50:50] throughout the eternals and came down
[50:53] into our world to be one of us to give
[50:57] your life for a ransom paying the price
[51:00] of redemption and given them us the gift
[51:04] of your own spirit. I ask your blessings
[51:07] now upon the food refreshments that we
[51:09] will take in Jesus name. Amen.
[51:14] So, we have a little bit of refreshments
[51:16] that are there in the fellowship hall
[51:18] and you're welcome to join us there.
[51:20] Thank you very much. God bless you.
[51:25] [applause]
