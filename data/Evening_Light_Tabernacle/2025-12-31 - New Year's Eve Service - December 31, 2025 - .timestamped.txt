[9:50] pray together.
[9:53] Let's bow our heads.
[9:56] Gracious father,
[9:58] as we come into the house of the Lord
[10:00] this evening, as David said, I was happy
[10:03] when they said, "Let us go into the
[10:04] house of the Lord."
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're a happy people to be called
[10:08] by your name.
[10:10] We're a happy people, Lord, to see the
[10:12] light of this revelation that you have,
[10:15] Lord, poured down in this generation,
[10:17] Lord. This restoration of the word, dear
[10:20] God. This [music] Lord, light piercing
[10:23] the darkness, Lord. We rejoice in it. We
[10:26] walk in it. We live in it, Lord. We
[10:29] thank you, Lord God, for what you have
[10:31] done for us. We thank you for the
[10:33] victories of the past, Lord. We're
[10:36] looking forward to the mark of the high
[10:38] calling in Christ. As we're breaking
[10:40] into a new year, Lord Jesus, we
[10:42] consecrate ourselves, Lord. Sanctify our
[10:46] hearts, Lord, that we might walk, Lord,
[10:49] with new zeal, Lord, with new fire,
[10:52] Lord, with new faith, from glory to
[10:54] glory, from faith to faith, Lord. We
[10:57] pray that you lift us higher, dear God.
[11:00] Our hearts are under anticipation.
[11:02] Our souls are under expectation, Lord.
[11:06] Lord, we look for your return. We look
[11:08] for the manifestation of your word in
[11:10] our lives. Lord, I pray, dear God, that
[11:14] you'll bless every hungry heart, Lord,
[11:16] that you saw the needs in the building.
[11:18] [music] We pray, Lord God, that you'll
[11:21] Lord move upon every prayer request,
[11:23] every hand lifted, every heart, Lord,
[11:25] every prayer. We pray, dear God, you
[11:27] move among your pe people. May the shout
[11:30] of the King be of the camp, Lord. a
[11:33] rejoicing to know that you stand by your
[11:36] word and you back your word. Lord, I
[11:38] pray in Jesus' name for the [music]
[11:40] needs, Lord. Those that were sick, so
[11:42] many, those of the flu, those that are
[11:44] in need. Lord, you have always supplied
[11:46] the needs of your people. You gave them
[11:48] mana from heaven, quails from heaven.
[11:51] You gave healing, Lord, in the Old
[11:53] Testament. And Lord, this is a greater
[11:55] covenant. And you are the God of the
[11:58] covenant. I pray Lord God, may the
[12:00] spirit of God move mightily. Raise up
[12:02] those that are sick. Raise up those Lord
[12:05] that are weary. Father, I pray dear God,
[12:08] may we burst forth in this new year in
[12:11] the faith of the son of God. May your
[12:13] blessing and the power of the Holy
[12:15] Spirit rest upon your people as we
[12:18] commit our souls to thee now. In [music]
[12:20] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen and
[12:24] amen.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you want just give the
[12:28] Lord a hand clap of praise. [applause]

[12:41] offering.

[26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to just stand to your
[26:21] feet just a moment.
[26:27] We have just a few minutes aotted to
[26:29] speak. And I just want to share this as
[26:30] we close out 2025.
[26:34] We'll look here in 2 Timothy 4 and verse
[26:36] 6. It said, "For I am now ready to be
[26:38] offered
[26:40] &gt;&gt; and the time of my departure is at hand.
[26:43] I have fought a good fight, and I have
[26:45] finished my course, and I have kept the
[26:47] faith.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Henceforth, there is laid up for me a
[26:50] crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
[26:52] the righteous judge, shall give to me at
[26:54] that day, and not to me only, but unto
[26:57] all them also.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; You're included in Paul's statement.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; To them that love his appearing. So, you
[27:05] can have your seats this evening. I just
[27:06] kind of want to take a minute and if I
[27:08] would give us a little subtopic
[27:11] reflecting back to move forward and we
[27:14] find Paul as he's at the end of his life
[27:16] he begins to look over his life his
[27:18] ministry and no doubt he recalls the
[27:21] time where he sat at the feet of Galia
[27:23] and learned the words of God and maybe
[27:25] the times he wasted the years
[27:27] persecuting the church you know maybe
[27:30] the time he recalled when he was in era
[27:32] and didn't see the fulfillment of the
[27:34] word but he would say at the end of his
[27:36] life, at the end of his journey, I have
[27:38] fought a good fight.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; You know, Paul had fought a many a
[27:41] battle just like each of us, we have
[27:43] fought many battles and he reflects back
[27:46] and he says, I have kept the faith.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; You know, Paul would tell us in 2
[27:52] Corinthians 11 and 24, he rec he
[27:55] recounts the times of his struggles. You
[27:58] know many times we want to testify the
[28:00] good things of God and we should and but
[28:03] also there's some difficulties along the
[28:05] journey that we face and Paul would tell
[28:07] us of the Jews five times received I 40
[28:10] stripes save one thrice was I beaten
[28:13] with rods once was I stoned thrice I
[28:15] suffered shipwrecked and night and day
[28:17] have I been in the deep in journeyings
[28:19] often in perils of waters in perils of
[28:22] robbers in perils of my own countrymen
[28:24] in perils of the heathen in perils of
[28:27] the city, in perils of the wilderness,
[28:29] in perils of the sea, in perils among
[28:31] false brethren. Woo! Man,
[28:34] &gt;&gt; anybody want to be a Paul?
[28:36] &gt;&gt; In weariness and painfulness, and
[28:38] watchings often, in hunger, and thirst,
[28:41] in fasting often, in cold, AND IN
[28:43] NAKEDNESS, BESIDES ALL THOSE THINGS are
[28:46] without, that which cometh upon me
[28:48] daily, the care of all the churches.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; And he says, "But who is weak, I'm not
[28:54] weak. Who is offended? I burn not. If I
[28:58] must glory, then I will glory in the
[29:00] things that concern MY INFIRMITIES.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; PAUL LOOKING BACK OVER his years, he
[29:05] would say maybe like this, I see clearly
[29:08] now what I what I couldn't see in the
[29:11] moment.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; The power that was sustaining me was
[29:16] never my own power,
[29:18] &gt;&gt; but it was God's power.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; And he would recall, I've been hungered.
[29:22] I've been in abundance. I've been with
[29:24] crowds that LISTEN TO ME PREACH EAGERLY.
[29:26] I'VE BEEN WITH MOBS THAT DRAG ME AWAY. I
[29:29] planted churches with trembling hands. I
[29:31] trusted THE SPIRIT OF GOD THAT WOULD
[29:33] NEVER THAT I COULD DO that he could do
[29:35] things that I never could. Transformed
[29:38] hearts and knit communities together,
[29:40] raise up leaders from ordinary MEN AND
[29:42] WOMEN WHOSE ONLY STRENGTH WAS CHRIST
[29:45] LIVING IN THEM. PAUL RECALLED THE GREAT
[29:47] THINGS THAT GOD HAD DONE THROUGH HIS
[29:50] MINISTRY.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[29:53] But what did Paul cherish the most? It
[29:55] wasn't the miles, Brother Craig, that he
[29:57] traveled. It wasn't THE FANTASTIC
[29:59] SERMONS THAT HE PREACHED, BUT IT WAS the
[30:01] faces of brothers and sisters.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; It was the faces of those that listened
[30:05] eagerly TO HEAR AND THEY HUNG ON TO
[30:08] EVERY WORD THAT PAUL PREACHED. AND HE
[30:10] WOULD BEGIN TO ESTABLISH THE GENTILE
[30:12] CHURCH.
[30:14] IT WAS THE FACES OF THOSE THAT GOD HAD
[30:17] ENTRUSTED TO HIS CARE, their faith,
[30:19] THEIR PERSEVERANCE, THEIR LOVE,
[30:22] and there were his crowning and his joy.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; And Paul was saying, "It was not the
[30:28] fruit of my clever words that did this,
[30:31] but it's been the power of God
[30:33] &gt;&gt; throughout time."
[30:35] And no doubt here he is toward the end
[30:38] of his life sitting in a Roman cell,
[30:40] parchment before him, chains resting on
[30:43] his wrist. Maybe he can hear the sounds
[30:46] of the city distant in the city there.
[30:49] And he reflects not on fame. He reflects
[30:53] not on accomplishments,
[30:55] the numerous churches that he was able
[30:57] to establish. He reflects not on the
[30:59] miles that he traveled, but on one
[31:01] simple truth. It was never my strength
[31:05] that carried me,
[31:07] &gt;&gt; but it was always his.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; And when any man thinks that it's him,
[31:11] &gt;&gt; right,
[31:12] &gt;&gt; doing it, then he's away from God.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; He remembers the road to Damascus WHERE
[31:18] HE WAS AMBUSHED BY GRACE and he turned
[31:20] from unbelief TO BELIEVING. AND I TRUST
[31:22] that each of you remember that moment.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; You can reflect back to that time where
[31:28] grace ambushed your life
[31:30] &gt;&gt; and you made a turn and you made A
[31:32] CHANGE. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE NIGHT THAT
[31:34] GOD SPOKE to me
[31:36] &gt;&gt; when I was going 120 miles the wrong
[31:38] direction and he said, "Turn your car
[31:40] around.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; I've never been the same since, church."
[31:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why do you share that?"
[31:46] Because I've never been the same.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; It's a part of who I am.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; No doubt. He remembers all night prayer
[31:53] meetings, nights spent in prayer tears
[31:55] that were shed over loved ones. He
[31:58] remembers the beatings, the shipwrecks,
[31:59] the hunger, the loneliness. And yet over
[32:02] all of it, one theme arises, and that's
[32:04] God's power was made perfect
[32:07] &gt;&gt; in my weakness.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; See, Paul recognized he was a man of
[32:11] weakness, but he also recognized that
[32:13] the God that he served was not weak.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; And I believe if Paul could speak to the
[32:18] church today, his reflection might sound
[32:21] a little bit like this. I was not the
[32:24] hero of my own story. Good.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Christ was
[32:30] &gt;&gt; beautiful.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; I planted,
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Apollos watered,
[32:34] &gt;&gt; but God gave the increase.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Every step I took, EVERY SERMON I
[32:40] PREACHED, every soul that was
[32:42] transformed, it wasn't me, but it was
[32:44] Christ in me,
[32:46] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; And I want you to recall and remember
[32:51] this. It's what we do for Christ
[32:54] &gt;&gt; that lasts. You may go a lot of places.
[32:57] You may do a lot of things in this life,
[32:59] but it's what you do for Christ that
[33:01] counts.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; And Paul is there waiting and he's
[33:07] &gt;&gt; he he he says one thing. I have fought a
[33:10] good fight
[33:12] &gt;&gt; and I have finished my race.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; But through the ups and through the
[33:18] downs, he says, I have kept the faith.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; And through his ups and his downs, he
[33:22] remained steadfast. And I believe just
[33:25] for a minute now is if we look back when
[33:28] we started 2025, brother Murphy Wong was
[33:32] here and he ministered to us on look and
[33:34] live and he made a comment. People are
[33:36] so easy to forget what God has done.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; And I say even the light tabernacle
[33:43] church of the living God, may we never
[33:45] forget what God has done in our lives,
[33:48] &gt;&gt; where he has brought us from
[33:51] &gt;&gt; and where he has taken us to. Amen.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; As we reflect back, I believe we can say
[33:56] like Paul, I fought a good fight.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; There's been a lot of battles along the
[34:01] journey, but I'm still standing.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; We've kept the faith. Satan has done
[34:06] everything he could to destroy us, but
[34:08] we're here tonight.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; As a testimony of God's grace and his
[34:12] mercy.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham and brother
[34:17] Craig, you shared this quote Sunday and
[34:19] he says, "Now, today as As we face the
[34:24] new years, I want to think not like the
[34:27] past, but I want to look to the future.
[34:30] As Paul said, forgetting those things
[34:31] that were in the past, I pressed toward
[34:33] the mark. See the high calling. NOW,
[34:36] WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PLACE the message
[34:38] today as though through a rearview
[34:39] mirror. It would take too long. See the
[34:42] things that the Lord has did. And you
[34:44] all are acquainted with the great things
[34:46] that our Lord has been doing and some of
[34:48] the mightiest things that I've ever seen
[34:49] in my life. just passing. He said just
[34:52] in the passing of the last few MONTHS
[34:54] AND BUT NOW WE'RE THANKFUL FOR WHAT he's
[34:57] has been, but we're looking forward.
[35:00] We're looking where we're headed for and
[35:03] into this 19 and 64.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; I would say into this 20 and 26.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; And brother B makes a couple statements.
[35:11] You you know, if you can't drive a car
[35:13] looking in the rearview mirror, you're
[35:15] going to wreck up.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; But you know what? You must glance back.
[35:20] And you're ever going to determine where
[35:22] you are, then you have to reflect back
[35:24] on where you started.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; And each of you here tonight, whether
[35:28] you're young, whether you're old, you
[35:31] have a starting point.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; You have a place where your candle got
[35:36] lit. I can recall that, you know,
[35:38] Brother Bam shares a testimony of that
[35:40] that colored sister there and she'd say,
[35:41] "I'm not what I ought to be.
[35:44] I'm not what I want to be, but praise
[35:47] God, I'm not what I used to be.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; CHURCH, WE'RE REFLECTING BACK TO look
[35:53] forward
[35:55] &gt;&gt; in 2025. Many of you realize and and
[35:58] understand that I've done a lot of
[35:59] preaching out there in the state of
[36:00] California amongst the Hispanic people.
[36:02] Over the last two years, I've spent a
[36:04] lot of time out there building their
[36:06] confidence and their trust that a lot of
[36:08] the churches there broke away from the
[36:09] return ministry movement. done a lot of
[36:11] things with question and answers and
[36:13] services, blending into their culture,
[36:16] you know, devouring their wonderful
[36:18] authentic Mexican food and different
[36:19] things of that nature. But at the end of
[36:22] 24, at the beginning of 25, I preached
[36:24] in Phoenix, Arizona for brother Elas
[36:27] Nahara. And Sister Jana,
[36:30] she came to that meeting. And it was in
[36:32] that meeting that she fully walked away
[36:34] from her Pentecostal denomination and
[36:37] fully embraced the message. And a few
[36:39] short months after that, brother Timothy
[36:41] and brother Tim would go there and they
[36:43] would hold some meetings there and and
[36:45] just a tremendous outpouring of God's
[36:47] grace. And brother Tony Mahias, who was
[36:49] an apostolic preacher, uh his his
[36:52] children, they all go to the church
[36:53] there in West Cavina, he walked away
[36:55] from the apostolic denomination and
[36:57] received the message fully and has been
[36:59] a an ardent uh labor amongst the
[37:02] brothers there to preach the gospel and
[37:04] to, you know, to embrace the message.
[37:06] And it's been through various
[37:08] ministries, brother Ray Muse, Brother
[37:10] Andrew Glover, Brother Andrew Spencer,
[37:12] Brother Flint Tape, Brother Aaron
[37:13] Oglesby, Brother Tim, BROTHER TIMOTHY,
[37:16] THAT GOD has began to open the eyes of
[37:19] the Hispanic culture of the Hispanic
[37:20] people there and bring them into the
[37:22] opening of the word
[37:25] &gt;&gt; the way that brother Brandham intended.
[37:27] The youth are catching the inspiration
[37:29] and God has done such tremendous things
[37:31] even among brother Johnny's children
[37:34] there. And toward the latter part of 25
[37:37] back in October, I traveled to Mexico
[37:39] with brother Johnny. And it was during
[37:41] these meetings that their divine healing
[37:44] happened. As I was preaching the the
[37:46] word, this one got healed and brother
[37:48] Johnny's mom got healed in the meeting
[37:50] and several pastors came to the altar in
[37:53] tears. Realized that there's more to
[37:55] this message than what they knew.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; And they begin to embrace and hunger for
[37:59] it. And in 25, I did my first wedding
[38:02] ever. And it was a Mexican wedding. I'm
[38:05] going tell you, it's unlike anything
[38:06] you've ever been a part of. But it was
[38:07] great. We baptiz or we we married
[38:10] brother Gio Avala with sister Odrina and
[38:13] there and then 25. One of the greatest
[38:15] things that I would say that took place
[38:17] was I had the honor of baptizing my
[38:20] son-in-law after preaching. He come to
[38:23] me in the back. He says, "I know I don't
[38:25] have it. What do I need to do to get
[38:27] it?" I said, "Well, were you baptized?"
[38:30] He says, "Yes, I've been baptized when I
[38:31] was eight." I said, "There's a lot of
[38:32] water under that bridge. You're welcome
[38:34] to get rebaptized." And he said, "I want
[38:36] to do it." So his dad and I, Brother
[38:38] Brad Powell and I baptized Wesson. And a
[38:40] couple months ago, God filled him with
[38:42] the Holy Ghost.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "The things that I'm telling
[38:46] you tonight, these are not the things of
[38:48] any one man. These are not the things
[38:49] that man can do, but this is the work of
[38:51] God."
[38:52] &gt;&gt; And I want to just end with this as I
[38:54] share 1 Corinthians 3:6. Paul again, I
[38:57] have planted.
[38:59] Apollos watered, but God gave the
[39:02] increase.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; So then, neither is he that plantth
[39:06] anything, neither he that waterth, BUT
[39:08] IT'S GOD THAT giveth the increase. Now
[39:10] he that planth and he that waterth,
[39:12] they're one. And every man shall receive
[39:14] his own reward according to his own
[39:16] labor. For we are laborers together,
[39:19] &gt;&gt; brothers. We are laborers together.
[39:22] We need each other as much as we need
[39:25] each of you here. And and Paul will say,
[39:28] "And you are God's husband husbandry and
[39:31] you are God's building according to the
[39:32] grace of God which is given unto me as a
[39:35] wise master builder. I have laid a
[39:38] foundation another buildeth their own.
[39:40] But let every man take heed how he
[39:42] buildth their upon. For other foundation
[39:45] can no man lay than that is laid, which
[39:47] is Christ Jesus." And in verse 21,
[39:50] therefore let no man glory in men, for
[39:52] all things are yours, whether Paul or
[39:55] Apollos or Cphus or the world or of life
[39:58] or death or things present or things to
[40:00] come, they're all yours and you are
[40:02] Christ and Christ is God's. So I'm
[40:05] honored to stand here with these
[40:07] brothers today, Brother Tim, Brother
[40:08] Timothy, Brother Aaron, and other great
[40:10] men like Brother Craig, and different
[40:12] men around the world that are standing
[40:13] for this message. I'm honored to stand
[40:16] with each of you [clears throat] and
[40:18] call you my brother and sister, but more
[40:20] importantly to call you my friend.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; I recognize that when we go out on the
[40:25] field and we visit the various churches
[40:26] we go, we don't go along. You go with
[40:28] us. You're praying for us, praying for
[40:30] successful meetings. And until we leave
[40:33] this world, I want us to take a moment
[40:34] just to reflect back of when your
[40:37] journey got started.
[40:39] recount the great victories, the
[40:41] difficult struggles, but also the
[40:43] recollections of how far you have come.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; And I want to say thank you for your
[40:48] love and your support through the years.
[40:50] You have been longsuffering watch a
[40:52] young man mature into a preacher.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; A lot of flubs, a lot of Joe isms, a lot
[40:57] of mistakes, but you've been merciful
[40:58] and graceful to allow this man to become
[41:02] what God has desired to use him. I want
[41:04] to thank you for your prayers. I want to
[41:06] thank you for your text and your
[41:07] encouragement as the ministries bless
[41:09] you throughout times in your life. And
[41:12] as we close out 2025,
[41:15] may we end this year the way we started
[41:17] it. As brother Murphy Wong said, look
[41:19] unto Jesus, the author and the finisher
[41:22] of our faith. Sister Jessica, if you
[41:24] would come and have your song.
[41:27] Look and live. We're going to keep
[41:30] looking forward to his coming
[41:32] &gt;&gt; until these bodies are changed.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church.

[47:34] that you can use.
[47:37] [music]
[47:43] [applause]
[47:59] Hallelujah. Have you enjoyed the evening
[48:01] so far?
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoyed the what brother Joe
[48:05] [music] had to say this evening and
[48:08] expecting each one. Amen. [music] And
[48:10] it's
[48:13] it's reminded me of this song I've had
[48:14] on my heart for several days, several
[48:17] weeks now. And if you know it, I'd just
[48:20] love for you to sing [music] it with me.
[48:22] I think sometimes it's wonderful to stop
[48:25] and reflect on what the Lord has done
[48:26] for us.
[48:28] Amen.
[48:30] Man, he's been so good to us.
[48:34] I remember [singing]
[48:37] how you provided,
[48:41] how you held [singing] me
[48:44] through the night.
[48:48] And I remember
[48:52] how you sustained me [singing]
[48:56] when you stepped in
[48:59] to save my [singing] life.
[49:03] And if I knew then
[49:06] [music]
[49:07] what I know now,
[49:11] I would be [music and singing] still
[49:14] and let you work it out.
[49:18] [singing]
[49:18] Oh Jesus,
[49:22] I was tossed in the water, [singing]
[49:26] but [music] I never went under.
[49:29] You [singing] were [music] always on
[49:32] time,
[49:35] Jesus.
[49:37] When I [singing] went through the fire,
[49:41] you were right there beside me.
[49:44] [singing] You were always [music] on
[49:48] time.
[49:50] You were always, always,
[49:54] always [singing and music] on time.
[49:58] You were always
[50:00] always
[50:02] always [singing and music] on time.
[50:08] And I [singing and music] remember
[50:12] how you car
[50:16] [music] when I [singing] could not
[50:20] take a step. [music and singing] Oh, and
[50:22] I remember how you love me. I remember
[50:27] how you love me [music]
[50:31] when I could [singing] not
[50:35] love [music]
[50:35] myself. If I knew then or if I knew then
[50:40] [singing]
[50:42] what I know now,
[50:45] [music] I would be still and let you
[50:49] work it out.
[50:53] Oh Jesus, [music and singing]
[50:56] I was tossed in the water,
[51:00] but [music] I never went under.
[51:02] [singing]
[51:04] You were always on time.
[51:09] And [music and singing] Jesus,
[51:11] when I went through the fire,
[51:15] you [music] were right there beside me.
[51:19] You were always [music]
[51:21] [singing] on time.
[51:24] You were always always
[51:27] [singing and music]
[51:29] on time.
[51:31] You were always [music and singing]
[51:34] always always
[51:36] on time. There's never been a day, never
[51:40] [music and singing] been a minute, never
[51:42] been a moment that you weren't in. Never
[51:46] been a time that you [singing] didn't
[51:48] see me through God. So I worship. Oh,
[51:52] can we stand and sing it? There's never
[51:54] been a [music and singing] day, never
[51:56] been a minute, never been a moment that
[51:59] you weren't [singing] in me. Never been
[52:02] a time that you [music] didn't see me
[52:04] through God. So I [singing] worship you.
[52:08] There's [music] never been a day, never
[52:11] been a minute, never been a moment that
[52:14] [music and singing] you weren't in it.
[52:16] Never been a time that you didn't see me
[52:19] through God. So I worship [singing]
[52:22] you. [music]
[52:23] There's never been a day, never been a
[52:27] minute, never been a moment.
[52:29] [singing and music]
[52:31] Oh, think about it. Never been a time
[52:33] that you didn't see me through God.
[52:35] [music]
[52:36] So I worship [singing]
[52:38] you
[52:40] and Jesus.
[52:43] I was tossed in the water [singing]
[52:47] but I never went under.
[52:51] You were always on [music and singing]
[52:55] time.
[52:57] Jesus,
[53:00] when I went through the fire,
[53:02] [music and singing]
[53:04] you were right there beside me. You
[53:08] [singing]
[53:09] were always
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, just tell them, [music] Lord,
[53:13] [singing] you're always
[53:18] [music]
[53:18] always on time.
[53:22] You [singing] were always
[53:24] always
[53:27] [singing] on time.
[53:31] [music]
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you found him to be always on
[53:34] time?
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Through the fire, through the flood,
[53:38] [music] times when you didn't know how
[53:39] you were going to make it,
[53:41] &gt;&gt; but he was always right on time. Amen.
[53:44] We thank him for that. [music] That he's
[53:46] so mindful of us, watching over and
[53:50] keeping us. Amen. Amen. Ain't it good to
[53:53] serve the Lord?
[53:54] &gt;&gt; It's brought us through another year,
[53:56] &gt;&gt; 2025, moving [music] into 2026.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; I tell you,
[54:02] seemed unimaginable. You know, Brother
[54:04] Tim was in the back talking about he
[54:05] said, "You remember the year 2000? How
[54:08] everybody's going crazy." And that just
[54:10] seems like a a blink.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Things are going faster and faster and
[54:15] seems crazier and crazier. I'm thankful
[54:17] tonight [music]
[54:18] we have promises from a faithful God.
[54:21] And no matter how crazy things get, I'm
[54:23] so glad to be serving him
[54:25] &gt;&gt; going into 2026. I'm glad to be doing it
[54:28] with you. Amen.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, we're
[54:32] going to read one verse of scripture
[54:33] tonight.
[54:35] Amen. God is [music] so good to us. If
[54:38] you'll look in Ecclesiastes 3 and verse
[54:41] one. Ecclesiastes 3 and verse one.
[54:46] We're just going to read this one verse
[54:47] here. Says, "To everything there is a
[54:51] season, a time to every purpose under
[54:56] the heaven." Amen. You can have your
[54:58] seats this evening. And just want to
[55:00] speak for just a moment. If I would were
[55:02] to title this tonight, I would just say
[55:05] constant through the seasons. Constant
[55:08] through the seasons. And if if you were
[55:10] to read on down through that verse, it
[55:12] would just, you know, for the sake of
[55:13] time, I didn't read it that chapter, but
[55:15] it goes on and describes so many
[55:17] different things that says there's a
[55:18] time for for everything. And and
[55:21] basically what we learn is that seasons
[55:22] and times and things are always
[55:25] changing. And and we know that the
[55:27] calendar turns and and with that seasons
[55:30] change and seasons within a year, you
[55:32] know, spring and summer and fall and
[55:34] winter, but but even seasons within our
[55:36] lives are are constantly changing and
[55:39] our lives are are moving and and seasons
[55:42] of I guess we would say celebration come
[55:45] come and go. We we have a Thanksgiving
[55:47] and then we move into Christmas and and
[55:50] there's different seasons throughout the
[55:51] year where there's celebrations and
[55:53] things like that. And and you know, like
[55:55] I said, we've just come through
[55:56] Thanksgiving and now through the
[55:58] Christmas season and and it's times of
[56:00] the year really that when it comes to
[56:03] God and and and and his faithfulness,
[56:05] the the world has completely disregarded
[56:08] those things from those seasons. They
[56:10] they've kind of turned them into a time
[56:12] of realry for the sake of realry and and
[56:15] they've forgotten what those things are
[56:17] are truly about. And there's there's no
[56:19] worship involved. And there's there's
[56:21] nothing nothing sacred anymore about
[56:24] those times. But but to a believer, the
[56:27] importance of the season we've just come
[56:29] through really cannot be overstated.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say, "If there
[56:35] had been no Christmas, there would be no
[56:38] resurrection."
[56:39] &gt;&gt; How many are thankful for the
[56:41] resurrection?
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Had there been no
[56:43] Christmas, there'd be no resurrection.
[56:45] If there had been no Christmas, there
[56:46] had been no love.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; There had been no peace. there been no
[56:50] hereafter for the believer if there had
[56:53] been no Christmas. And so for for the
[56:56] season that we've just come through and
[56:58] and the Christmas time, it's it's it's
[57:00] extremely important because we recognize
[57:02] why it's important. We recognize why
[57:05] we're stopping and pausing and
[57:07] worshiping and and giving God God glory.
[57:10] So with the truth of Christmas and the
[57:13] re and and the realization of what it
[57:15] really means, it becomes a time of
[57:17] worship unto us. Amen. And it's a time
[57:21] to pause and to remember.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like brother Joe said, it's a
[57:26] time to pause and and to remember and
[57:28] and to give thanksgiving for for all
[57:31] that God has done in our life. And and
[57:33] remembering that he came in flesh so
[57:36] that he could give his life.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, he came as Emanuel so that he
[57:40] could be the kinsman redeemer. so so
[57:43] that his life could come back into your
[57:46] life so that you could then be an
[57:48] overcomer in the day that we live in.
[57:50] Amen. I I'm I'm thankful as you look
[57:53] back that that God made a way for the
[57:55] Old Testament saints and he made a
[57:56] covering, but we recognize that it was
[57:59] just foreshadowing what was to come and
[58:01] and we no longer have to go year after
[58:03] year after year and sacrifice after
[58:05] sacrifice because he came as Emmanuel,
[58:09] because he came to be a kinsman and and
[58:11] he walked like us and he and and he
[58:13] talked like a man and he faced human
[58:15] battles and he overcame as a human and
[58:17] therefore the spirit that was within him
[58:19] could come back on you and tonight.
[58:21] Amen. And and so because of that, what
[58:24] we've just come through is a wonderful
[58:26] time.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; It's a marvelous time. It's a It's a
[58:30] time of family. It's a time of worship.
[58:33] And and during this time, it seems like
[58:35] just human nature. It seems like we
[58:37] think about him more.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; We think about the gift that he gave
[58:42] more and we and we pause and we talk
[58:44] about it and and that's all good and and
[58:46] that's great and and I love it. But I
[58:49] want to challenge us as we enter into
[58:51] 2026
[58:53] that we don't need a day or a season to
[58:56] be thankful and to remember.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; We don't have to wait till to to to
[59:02] certain times of the year and and you
[59:04] don't let the closeness that you feel
[59:06] and and and the love that we feel and
[59:09] all that comes with this season just be
[59:11] like some sort of seasonal decoration
[59:13] that gets put away when the season
[59:15] changes.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; This isn't a seasonal relationship. It
[59:19] wasn't a seasonal gift. It wasn't a
[59:21] seasonal thing we received in this day,
[59:23] but it's something of eternal value.
[59:25] It's it's something of eternity. And
[59:27] it's something we can be thankful for
[59:28] and praise him for every single day of
[59:31] the year. Amen. And and and and maybe
[59:35] the season that was set aside to honor
[59:37] the birth of Christ may may have come to
[59:39] an end, but I believe that our praise
[59:42] and our worship and our adoration should
[59:44] be constant through the seasons.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be constant. And and as
[59:49] we come through 2025 and and this
[59:51] holiday season ends, you you know, it
[59:54] seems like every time we reach this
[59:55] point in the calendar that that folks
[59:57] kind of go into a bit of a drag,
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; they kind of go into those January,
[1:00:02] February blues.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; But don't let your relationship with him
[1:00:08] go there.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Don't don't hit this time of year and
[1:00:12] and and hit a drag. Don't let your
[1:00:14] passion for him go into a lull, but but
[1:00:18] make it a purpose tonight as we enter
[1:00:20] into 2026 and purpose in your heart that
[1:00:23] I'm going to give him more than ever.
[1:00:25] I'm going to serve him more than ever.
[1:00:27] I'm going to surrender more of who I am.
[1:00:29] Amen. What do I need to do, brother
[1:00:31] Aaron, TO HAVE A CLOSER WALK? LAY DOWN
[1:00:33] more of yourself TONIGHT AND SAY, LORD,
[1:00:35] I WANT MORE OF YOU GOING INTO 2026. I'M
[1:00:39] going to be more aware of him AND
[1:00:41] REMEMBER HIM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not waiting for a Thanksgiving day
[1:00:46] or a Christmas season. THOSE THINGS ARE
[1:00:48] WONDERFUL, BUT BUT I'M GOING TO REMEMBER
[1:00:49] HIM IN FEBRUARY and January and on
[1:00:52] Tuesday and on Monday and every day OF
[1:00:54] THE WEEK. LORD, YOU'RE WORTHY OF IT ALL
[1:00:56] EVERY SINGLE day of my life. Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Our worship isn't contained to a season.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Our worship isn't contained to a day,
[1:01:05] but I want my life to praise him every
[1:01:07] day. I want my life to thank him every
[1:01:10] day that he came and he took on flesh.
[1:01:13] Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; We can never thank him enough and and
[1:01:15] praise him enough and and and and you
[1:01:18] know that same remembrance that that we
[1:01:21] speak of around Christmas because you
[1:01:23] know we we say it's time to remember and
[1:01:25] and we pause and we pause and and and
[1:01:28] and we thank him for the wonderful love
[1:01:30] gift and we slow down and it seems like
[1:01:32] we begin to draw closer and think on him
[1:01:35] and his life. But what I'm saying is
[1:01:37] let's hit pause more regularly.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Let's hit pause all year long and
[1:01:42] remember him and honor him and thank him
[1:01:44] every day because seasons change
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Seasons change but God is constant.
[1:01:52] Seasons change but Jesus Christ is the
[1:01:54] same yesterday, today and forever. Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; The years change but what he did by
[1:02:01] coming in flesh and dying for us was an
[1:02:03] eternal gift. It was an eternal
[1:02:06] sacrifice and it's not contained to
[1:02:08] dates or seasons. Prophet of God says
[1:02:10] Jesus Christ his own son that that he
[1:02:13] spared not to provide an eternal
[1:02:15] sacrifice for every generation that
[1:02:18] would follow Jesus Christ. Every
[1:02:20] generation after that would never have
[1:02:22] to look again for a sacrifice. Amen. But
[1:02:25] God provided everything the human race
[1:02:28] had need of in Jesus Christ. It was good
[1:02:31] in 2025. It's gonna be good in 2026.
[1:02:35] Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Calendars change,
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; but God doesn't.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus Christ is the same. So, so
[1:02:43] as we stand here on the brink of 2026
[1:02:47] and we look ahead, let's look ahead with
[1:02:50] a renewed zeal.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Let's look ahead with a renewed
[1:02:53] dedication and a constant remembrance.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; A constant thanksgiving because he isn't
[1:02:59] seasonal. He isn't a seasonal God, but
[1:03:02] he's with us every moment of every day.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Even as we begin to enter into the
[1:03:08] unknown, and you say, "What's the
[1:03:09] unknown, brother?" Tomorrow,
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; it's unknown.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; 2026, really, it's unknown. And as we
[1:03:18] begin to enter into that, don't enter
[1:03:19] into it fearfully.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Don't enter into it with trepidation and
[1:03:24] and and with all kind of worries and
[1:03:26] stress. But let's go forward knowing
[1:03:27] that the calendar has changed, but the
[1:03:30] promises have not.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; The calendar HAS CHANGED, BUT GOD'S word
[1:03:34] is still true. God is still true. HE'S
[1:03:36] STILL FAITHFUL. HE'S GOING TO SHOW UP
[1:03:38] FOR YOU RIGHT ON TIME, JUST AS HE ALWAYS
[1:03:41] HAS. THE CALENDAR is changing, but the
[1:03:43] truth is not changing IN 2026. AMEN.
[1:03:47] GOD'S GOING TO KEEP HIS WORD. GOD'S
[1:03:49] GOING TO FULFILL HIS PROMISES. GOD'S
[1:03:51] STILL GOING TO HEAL, AND HE'S STILL
[1:03:53] GOING TO SAVE. AND HE'S STILL GOING TO
[1:03:54] DELIVER. AND HE'S STILL GOING TO CALL
[1:03:55] YOUR LOVED ONES BACK. HE'S STILL GOING
[1:03:57] TO DO IT. HE'S STILL GOING TO HAVE A
[1:03:59] BRIDE WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE OR ANY
[1:04:02] SUCH THING. HE'S GOING TO HAVE A
[1:04:03] RAPTURE. IT MAY NOT HAPPEN IN 2026, BUT
[1:04:06] IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AMEN. God is going
[1:04:09] to keep his word.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's ahead in this year,
[1:04:16] but I know I'm not going into it
[1:04:17] empty-handed.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going into this year with promises
[1:04:22] in hand.
[1:04:23] I'm going into this year with his word
[1:04:26] on my lips. I'm going into this year
[1:04:28] with with faith in my heart. There's
[1:04:30] many things that we're holding on for.
[1:04:32] You know what you're holding on for. You
[1:04:34] know what promises you're holding on
[1:04:36] for. There there's many miracles that
[1:04:37] we're expecting to be fulfilled.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; And yet, there's many trials
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; and many twists and turns that we don't
[1:04:46] see coming just ahead.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; I don't say that to to scare you or
[1:04:51] worry you. If you've lived even a little
[1:04:52] bit, you know that's going to happen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; You know there's things coming that that
[1:04:57] that you don't know about and and and
[1:04:59] and you're going to have trials and
[1:05:01] things in 2026.
[1:05:03] But I can look forward tonight with
[1:05:05] courage.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; I can look forward tonight with courage
[1:05:08] and boldness knowing that I do not walk
[1:05:10] into this year alone. I do not walk into
[1:05:13] these battles alone. I walk into 2026
[1:05:16] anointed.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; I walk into 2026 just like David. There
[1:05:20] may be a valley and there may be a
[1:05:22] giant, but I've been anointed to rule
[1:05:24] and reign. There may be a valley and
[1:05:26] there may be a giant that I have to
[1:05:28] face, but I've been called in this day
[1:05:30] to be an overcomer.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; I have promises for 2026. Amen. Do you
[1:05:34] have promises for 2026? Well, they were
[1:05:37] given by an unfailing God and an
[1:05:39] unchanging God. So, that God is going to
[1:05:41] bring them to pass. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And whatever I face, whatever you face,
[1:05:47] you can face them knowing and sure that
[1:05:49] you're going to come out victorious.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; But brother Aaron, what what ABOUT WHAT
[1:05:54] ABOUT WHAT IF I DON'T SEE SOMETHING
[1:05:56] COMING AND IT JUST CATCHES ME OFF GUARD?
[1:05:58] That's going to happen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; That's going to happen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; David did not wake up looking for a
[1:06:04] Goliath that day.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; He did not wake up thinking, "Today I'm
[1:06:10] going to cut off the head of a giant."
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:14] What was he doing? He was just door
[1:06:15] dashing for his brothers.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; He was minding his own business,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; bringing groceries.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; But he was walking with God all the
[1:06:26] time.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; When you're at school, walk with God.
[1:06:29] When you're doing your yard work, walk
[1:06:31] with God. When you're washing dishes,
[1:06:32] walk with God. When you're cooking
[1:06:34] dinner, walk with God. And when Goliath
[1:06:36] shows up, you ain't going to have to
[1:06:37] worry one thing about it. BECAUSE IF
[1:06:39] YOU'RE WALKING WITH GOD, YOU'RE going to
[1:06:41] be victorious. Amen. In 2026. Amen.
[1:06:45] Amen. I don't know what Goliath IS GOING
[1:06:47] TO SHOW UP in in in in 2026, but when he
[1:06:50] does, you're not going to be afraid.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE AFRAID BECAUSE YOU CAN LOOK
[1:06:54] BACK AND SEE THE LINES OF 2024 AND HOW
[1:06:57] GOD BROUGHT YOU THROUGH AND THE BEAR OF
[1:06:59] 2025 AND HOW GOD BROUGHT YOU THROUGH.
[1:07:02] AND IF IT WAS good in 24 and IT WAS GOOD
[1:07:04] IN 25, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO BRING down
[1:07:06] Goliath in the year 2026. Amen. Because
[1:07:09] we're overcomers.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; We're overcomers. That's what we do. And
[1:07:13] we're not going to go down in defeat.
[1:07:15] Our God is constant through the seasons.
[1:07:19] Amen.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; He never leaves us. He never forsakes
[1:07:22] us.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Like to close tonight with a few
[1:07:24] scriptures. Deuteronomy 31:6.
[1:07:29] This is words for us as we go into this
[1:07:31] new year. Be strong and of good courage.
[1:07:35] Fear not,
[1:07:37] nor be afraid of them, for the Lord thy
[1:07:40] God, he it is that doth go with thee. He
[1:07:43] will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Psalms 23 and4. Yay, though I walk
[1:07:50] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:07:52] death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
[1:07:55] with me.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[1:07:59] Isaiah 41:10.
[1:08:01] Fear thou not, for I am with thee.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I
[1:08:08] will strengthen thee. Yay, I will help
[1:08:10] thee. Yay, I will uphold thee with the
[1:08:12] right hand of my righteousness.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; The last words that Matthew would record
[1:08:17] in his gospel, Matthew 28:20, lo, I am
[1:08:21] with you always, even until the end of
[1:08:24] the world.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Church, he's constant.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; He's with us every moment of every day.
[1:08:30] constant through the seasons.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Let's live for him like never before in
[1:08:34] 2026.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Let's seek him more
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; in 2026.
[1:08:40] And I leave you with what brother
[1:08:41] Brandham would say to his congregation
[1:08:43] one night during this same season. We
[1:08:46] want to say we appreciate you so much.
[1:08:49] We want to wish you a merry Christmas
[1:08:51] and the best of the new year. God be
[1:08:53] with you and give you new things.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who wants that? Lord, give me give
[1:08:59] me new, deeper, greater than I've ever
[1:09:01] had before.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "God bless you, be with you,
[1:09:04] and give you new things, more of the new
[1:09:06] life that you're seeking and hungering
[1:09:08] for." That's what I'm doing myself. I'm
[1:09:12] hungering for more of God.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you in the new year.
[1:09:17] [applause]
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask Sister [music] Jessica in the
[1:09:26] choir to come. And oh, I want to see him
[1:09:32] look upon [singing]
[1:09:33] his face [music]
[1:09:36] there to sing forever
[1:09:40] of the Savior's grace. [music]

[1:10:21] Oh,

[1:10:25] one more time. Oh, I want to see him.
[1:10:29] Oh, I want to see [music]
[1:10:31] him. Look upon his face.
[1:10:36] Dare [music and singing] to sing forever
[1:10:40] of his saving grace. [music]
[1:10:44] And on [singing] the streets of glory,
[1:10:48] let me lift my voice
[1:10:51] for [music and singing]
[1:10:52] my past home at last ever to [music]
[1:10:57] rejoice. [singing]
[1:11:09] [music]
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; I was lost in shame. [singing and music]
[1:11:26] Could not get past my flame until he
[1:11:29] called my name. I'm so [singing] glad he
[1:11:32] changed [music] me. Darkness held me
[1:11:34] down. But Jesus pulled me out. I am no
[1:11:38] longer [singing] found. I'm so glad he
[1:11:42] changed me. See, I [music]
[1:11:44] now a new creation [singing] in Christ.
[1:11:49] The old has gone there to life.
[1:11:54] I live [music and singing]
[1:11:55] by faith by sight.
[1:12:00] There is [music and singing] a name
[1:12:02] that's written down in glory and it's
[1:12:05] mine.
[1:12:07] Yes, he's mine.
[1:12:09] [music]
[1:12:10] I [singing] met the author of my story
[1:12:14] and he's mine.
[1:12:16] Yes, he's mine.
[1:12:18] [music] And it left me [singing] blind.
[1:12:21] But Jesus opened my eyes. [music] Now I
[1:12:24] see the light. I'm so glad he changed
[1:12:27] me. Now I'm [music and singing] walking
[1:12:29] free. I've got the victory and it's all
[1:12:33] over me.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he changed me. Say I
[1:12:39] now a new creation [singing and music]
[1:12:41] in Christ.
[1:12:44] The old is gone there.
[1:12:48] I live by faith [singing] on my side.
[1:12:51] [music]
[1:12:54] There is a [singing] name that's written
[1:12:57] down in glory. [music] And it's mine.
[1:13:01] Yes, it's mine.

[1:13:10] Yes, he's mine. [music and singing]
[1:13:12] There is a name that's written down in
[1:13:15] glory and he's [music and singing] mine.

[1:13:37] am because the I am tells [singing] me
[1:13:39] who I am. I am who I am because [music]
[1:13:42] the I am tells me who I am. I am who I

[1:13:48] who I am.
[1:13:51] [music]
[1:13:53] written name that's [singing] written

[1:14:30] And he's mine. [music]
[1:14:32] Yes, he's [singing] mine.
[1:14:34] And he's mine.
[1:14:37] Yes, he's [music] mine.
[1:14:42] Oh, Jesus [singing]

[1:14:55] Everywhere I go, [music]
[1:14:58] everywhere [singing]
[1:15:00] I'll be. Oh, Jesus
[1:15:04] [music and singing] is mine. Oh yes,
[1:15:07] he's mine. Jesus
[1:15:11] is mine. [music and singing]
[1:15:14] Jesus
[1:15:17] is [music and singing] mine.
[1:15:21] Everywhere I go,
[1:15:24] everywhere [music and singing] I'll be.
[1:15:27] Oh, Jesus
[1:15:30] is mine. [music and singing] The empty
[1:15:32] side
[1:15:33] of Jesus
[1:15:35] [music]
[1:15:36] is mine. [singing]
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus
[1:15:42] [music]
[1:15:43] is mine. [singing]
[1:15:47] Everywhere I go, [music]
[1:15:50] everywhere [singing]
[1:15:51] I'll be, oh Jesus
[1:15:56] is
[1:15:58] [singing and music]
[1:16:00] hallelujah.
[1:16:02] Hallelujah. [music]
[1:16:04] Aren't you glad Jesus is yours tonight?
[1:16:07] Amen. Aren't you glad that he's been
[1:16:10] with you throughout this past year?
[1:16:12] Aren't you glad you have the assurance
[1:16:15] he'll be with you every hour?
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the year to come.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; For he said, "I'll never leave you or
[1:16:22] forsake you."
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; What a promise that is.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; What a glorious promise. Amen. How we
[1:16:29] love the Lord tonight.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; We appreciate him.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to go to the book of
[1:16:36] Ecclesiastes also verse chapter um 3 and
[1:16:41] verse 14. So we'll just we'll just pick
[1:16:44] up on that same chapter where brother
[1:16:46] Aaron left off. He said, "I know that
[1:16:50] whatsoever God doeth, it shall be
[1:16:53] forever.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing can be put to it,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; nor anything taken from it." and God
[1:17:02] doeth it that man should fear before
[1:17:06] him.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[1:17:10] Tonight we are standing here at the edge
[1:17:14] of time. Not just a new year, you know,
[1:17:18] but we are right here where we're we're
[1:17:21] we're facing from time into eternity.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; And there's a blending of the seasons.
[1:17:29] But we're not here to announce something
[1:17:31] new. We are we are here to recognize
[1:17:33] what God has already done.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And because we serve a God who doesn't
[1:17:40] experiment
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; and he doesn't revise his word and what
[1:17:44] he begins, he finishes. And what he
[1:17:47] finishes is stands forever.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; It cannot be changed.
[1:17:52] And as we close one year and we step
[1:17:54] into another, we're not gathering here
[1:17:57] tonight just to turn the the page of a
[1:18:00] calendar.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; But we are here to discern a divine
[1:18:04] moment of where we are standing here
[1:18:07] realizing that God works in seasons and
[1:18:10] when a season closes, he doesn't lo
[1:18:14] leave a bunch of Lucians behind.
[1:18:16] And and of course as we remember the
[1:18:19] words of the prophet that we have
[1:18:21] focused upon in this past year as we
[1:18:25] will reflect back and also think of
[1:18:28] where God has led us in this past year
[1:18:30] through the word. Zechariah said that he
[1:18:33] shall bring forth a headstone thereof
[1:18:36] with shoutings crying grace grace unto
[1:18:39] it. Amen. And
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; we can realize that the favor THAT GOD
[1:18:43] HAS SHOWN us in the year past that that
[1:18:45] favor will continue in our lives.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And and because God will not end his
[1:18:52] work in confusion.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; He ends it with a capstone.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And that capstone of course is not a
[1:18:59] program. It's not a movement. It's not
[1:19:01] an idea. It is Christ himself
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; returning to his church as a head as a
[1:19:07] word, as life. And and when the capstone
[1:19:11] comes, it doesn't come to an unfinished
[1:19:15] building.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; It comes to something that has been
[1:19:18] measured and aligned and brought to
[1:19:20] maturity.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; AND SO TONIGHT, IT'S NOT ABOUT EMOTION.
[1:19:24] It's not about hype. It's about
[1:19:26] recognition.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; It's recognition that God has been
[1:19:30] speaking to us this year.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; It's a recognition that something has
[1:19:35] been closing. a recognition that the
[1:19:37] same God that began this work is now
[1:19:41] bringing it into completion.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; As Paul said in Philippians, he said,
[1:19:46] "Being confident of this very thing,
[1:19:48] that he that begun a good work in you
[1:19:51] will perform it to the day of Christ."
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; And and that work is not just in the
[1:19:58] church ages, but it's in you. So let
[1:20:03] every HEART TONIGHT JUST QUIETEN
[1:20:04] THEMSELVES BEFORE God and and LET OUR
[1:20:07] MINDS NOW BECOME SUBJECT TO THE word and
[1:20:09] let's lay aside the the noise of of time
[1:20:14] and listen at what the spirit has been
[1:20:17] saying to us
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; because we're facing a new year and
[1:20:22] we're not stepping into uncertainty.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; We are actually stepping into
[1:20:27] fulfillment.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are words of promise that
[1:20:32] God will fulfill in this year to come.
[1:20:35] And as we reflect ON WHAT GOD HAS SPOKEN
[1:20:38] throughout this past year,
[1:20:41] I I just trust he'll give us eyes to see
[1:20:44] and ears to hear and hearts to believe
[1:20:47] because what God does cannot be undone.
[1:20:52] And this past year, as you know, I've
[1:20:54] been speaking on mountain movers. And no
[1:20:57] doubt there are mountains still in your
[1:21:00] life. Each one of you can probably think
[1:21:02] of mountains, maybe insurmountable
[1:21:04] mountains that you can't climb that must
[1:21:08] be moved.
[1:21:10] And and so so yet we look ahead
[1:21:13] realizing that we still have a promise.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Whatever mountain in your way,
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. it before you it shall become a
[1:21:22] plane.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he is going TO BRING FORTH
[1:21:26] THE FINISHING STONE,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; the capstone crying grace, grace.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; And and as we began in n and in actually
[1:21:35] 2025, we we began with speaking on the
[1:21:40] coming capstone. As Zachchariah said,
[1:21:43] the capstone is brought forth with
[1:21:45] shoutings of grace, grace unto it. And
[1:21:49] we've had a lot to shout about and
[1:21:51] rejoice about. Amen. But we know that
[1:21:55] THE CAPSTONE IS NOT JUST A DOCTRINE. It
[1:21:58] is Christ himself.
[1:22:00] He is returning to his church as as the
[1:22:03] head, the the full word restored with
[1:22:07] his original power, with its original
[1:22:10] manifestations.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; NOW THE MYSTERIES SEALED TO THE AGES
[1:22:15] have been opened. And the seven thunders
[1:22:19] did not add us to us a new gospel, BUT
[1:22:23] IT KEPT THE RESTORATION. IT PEELED BACK
[1:22:26] LAYERS OF confusion
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; and brought THE TO LIGHT THE word that
[1:22:32] had been hidden through the ages
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; AND BROUGHT IT BACK INTO full
[1:22:37] manifestation
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; so that WE CAN PLAINLY SEE NOW and know
[1:22:43] EXACTLY WHAT THE APOSTLES PREACHED. SO
[1:22:46] THAT WE ARE NOW PREACHING THE SAME
[1:22:48] GOSPEL.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT
[1:22:52] HERE in portion but it is here in
[1:22:56] fullness
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; to bring FORTH THE CAPSTONE.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; A full bride, a people who know their
[1:23:02] God, a people who do exploits, WHO WILL
[1:23:06] FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE AND COMPLETE the
[1:23:10] work that has been promised. NOW OF
[1:23:12] COURSE WE KNOW THAT NOT ONLY WAS THERE
[1:23:15] CAPSTONE THAT CAME OF THE MYSTERIES
[1:23:17] BEING REVEALED WHICH WERE THE SEVEN
[1:23:20] THUNDERS BUT THE SAME CAPSTONE is also
[1:23:23] placed upon the individual believer
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; NOT AS AN INTELLECTUAL SCENT NOT AS
[1:23:29] EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT BUT AS A BAPTISM OF
[1:23:32] THE HOLY GHOST THAT is the capstone of
[1:23:36] every believer. It is the head coming to
[1:23:38] you, the individual, THE LITERAL LIGHT
[1:23:41] OF JESUS Christ returning into his
[1:23:44] people.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Making Christ in you the hope of
[1:23:49] glory.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we spoke again on the capstone
[1:23:53] of the ages. AND THAT CAPSTONE OF ALL
[1:23:56] THE AGES, OF ALL THE CHURCHES, is the
[1:23:59] living bride.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL HAVE A PEOPLE HERE AT THE END
[1:24:04] time alive and remain. WHO WILL BE THE
[1:24:07] MANIFESTATION OF EVERY PROMISED WORD OF
[1:24:10] GOD THAT SPOKE OF A BRIDE.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BEFORE THE PHYSICAL BODILY
[1:24:16] RETURN OF CHRIST, THERE MUST BE A BRIDE
[1:24:19] ON EARTH WHO MATCHES HIM.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; The scripture declares that they which
[1:24:24] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:24:27] together WITH THEM. THE THAT BRIDE IS
[1:24:31] that living bride. SHE IS A CAPSTONE
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; OF THE CHURCH AGES. SHE IS NOT AN
[1:24:37] ORGANIZATION. SHE IS NOT MAN-MADE.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE is a living word field people.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; She is the living bride. And as a living
[1:24:49] bride, SHE IS THE VOICE OF THE
[1:24:53] RESURRECTION.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That was again another sermon
[1:24:57] titled the living bride, the voice of
[1:25:00] the resurrection. YOU SEE, THE LIVING
[1:25:03] BRIDE IS NOT SILENT.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T SHUT her up.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; SHE IS [screaming] THE VOICE OF THE
[1:25:09] RESURRECTION.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE LIVES, SHE LIVES ALSO.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS JESUS STOOD BEFORE THE TOMB
[1:25:17] OF LAZARUS AND SPOKE LIFE BECAUSE HE'S A
[1:25:20] RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE, SO IS THE
[1:25:23] BRIDE UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST. SHE
[1:25:26] WILL SPEAK AGAIN. AMEN.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; SHE BECOMES THE FINAL PROPHECY CALLING
[1:25:32] THE DEAD IN CHRIST TO GATHER THEIR
[1:25:34] BODIES AND REUNITE WITH THEIR THEOPHIES.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE BIBLE SAID THE HOUR IS COMING
[1:25:41] WHEN THE DEAD SHALL hear the voice of
[1:25:43] the son of God and they that hear shall
[1:25:47] live.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; And that voice is in the bride of
[1:25:51] Christ. Let me just show I just want to
[1:25:54] bring back for for your attention again
[1:25:57] three very important quotes that I
[1:26:00] shared during that time from what is the
[1:26:03] Holy Ghost or what the Holy Ghost was
[1:26:05] given for. He said, "The same Holy
[1:26:07] Spirit that saved THE LUTHERAN, THAT
[1:26:10] SANCTIFIED the Methodists, that baptized
[1:26:12] the Pentecostals, IS NOW SETTING IN
[1:26:15] ORDER THE COMING OF the Lord Jesus WHEN
[1:26:18] IT'LL BE SO POWERFUL THAT BODY will come
[1:26:21] into this group of of church and that'll
[1:26:25] draw the rest of them from the grave.
[1:26:27] There'll be a resurrection."
[1:26:30] THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY GHOST IS FOR.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE DIDN'T JUST GIVE US THE HOLY
[1:26:37] GHOST TO PERPETUATE
[1:26:39] ANOTHER church age, BUT OH NO, THE HOLY
[1:26:42] GHOST IS GIVEN SO IT'LL DRAW [screaming]
[1:26:45] THE REST OF THEM FROM THE GRAVE.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT THERE WILL BE A resurrection
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; again. And Elijah, the meal offering, he
[1:26:54] says that during the days of Luther, we
[1:26:57] live by justification. During the days
[1:26:59] of Wesley, we live by sanctification.
[1:27:02] The church becoming the minority. In the
[1:27:04] days of Pentecost, we've lived down
[1:27:06] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:27:09] restorations of the gifts. Now we're
[1:27:11] really in the minority coming, the
[1:27:14] coming of the son of God. Here they
[1:27:16] believed by faith. Here they SHOUTED
[1:27:18] UNDER SANCTIFICATION. HERE THEY SPOKE IN
[1:27:21] tongues as a gift. But now the negative
[1:27:24] and the positive. The cap is coming on
[1:27:27] the pyramid. And it's the end time when
[1:27:30] Christ and HIS CHURCH IS SO MUCH ALIKE
[1:27:34] TILL IT'S GOING TO CALL THE DEAD.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FROM THE METHODIST BY
[1:27:39] LUTHERAN and all of those BACK THERE.
[1:27:41] AND THERE WILL BE A RESURRECTION. AND
[1:27:43] THEM THAT FELL ASLEEP IN the first,
[1:27:46] second, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH, AND
[1:27:49] SEVENTH WATCH WILL ARISE ONE OF THESE
[1:27:52] DAYS to meet Jesus in the sky. The hour
[1:27:55] has arrived, friends. The coming of the
[1:27:58] Lord is at hand.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, in confirmation of the
[1:28:04] commission, he says, "Then Jesus IS SO
[1:28:08] CLOSE TO COMING to earth until now, his
[1:28:12] power has begun to catch the people and
[1:28:16] winding them up and getting them ready
[1:28:18] for the bride, getting them ready to be
[1:28:20] caught up in the rapture. A church THAT
[1:28:23] HAVE FIT JUST EXACTLY TO BE TAKEN UP
[1:28:26] THROUGH ITS POWER WILL DRAW ALL OF THEM,
[1:28:30] THE REST OF them that's born again out
[1:28:32] of the earth. Jesus is coming.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm ready to give voice to that
[1:28:41] word. Aren't you?
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU SEE, THEN WE SPOKE ABOUT THEN
[1:28:47] THE LIVING BRIDE BEING THE FINAL
[1:28:50] PROPHECY.
[1:28:52] NOW THE FINAL VOICE IS NOT A new
[1:28:55] revelation. It's not a new gospel. It's
[1:28:58] a actually it's a prophetic echo of the
[1:29:02] original word.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; JUDE SAID THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE
[1:29:07] DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE PROPHESIES AGAIN BY believing
[1:29:13] and manifesting what was spoken at the
[1:29:16] beginning. I'm glad to declare to you
[1:29:18] tonight, we don't have a different
[1:29:20] gospel than what Paul preached.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; We don't have a new message.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that the Bible didn't bring,
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; but what we believe can be found right
[1:29:31] here in the covers of this book.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; It is it is the new covenant. And we are
[1:29:37] we are recipients of that covenant. And
[1:29:40] so AGAIN, AS WE SPOKE ABOUT THAT, THEN
[1:29:43] IF WE ARE THE LIVING BRIDE AND WE ARE
[1:29:45] THE VOICE AND THE FINAL PROPHECY, THEN
[1:29:47] WE ARE ADOPTED SONS WHO ARE THE
[1:29:50] CONQUERORS OF THE AIR FOR WE WILL MEET
[1:29:52] him in the air.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Well, YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM SHARED
[1:29:56] WITH US THAT THAT the that the
[1:29:59] atmospheres between us and God had
[1:30:01] become dark with demon powers because of
[1:30:04] sin. AND MY JESUS CAME DOWN THROUGH
[1:30:07] THAT, BROKE THROUGH THAT, DOWN THROUGH
[1:30:09] THE POWERS OF DARKNESS, CAME DOWN AND
[1:30:11] AND GAVE HIS LIFE, ASCENDLED BACK, MADE
[1:30:14] A WAY FOR US.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the way, the truth, and
[1:30:18] the life."
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, as the word comes to
[1:30:23] fullness, sons move from childhood into
[1:30:27] adoption, mature placement.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not a child bride he's
[1:30:34] marrying.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. She is a mature elect lady.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Paul described this as coming unto a
[1:30:42] perfect man. Unto how HOW PERFECT UNTO
[1:30:45] THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE OF THE
[1:30:48] fullness of Christ.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THESE SONS DO NOT MERELY
[1:30:53] SURVIVE THE ATMOSPHERE OF the age. They
[1:30:56] conquer it.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; AND I'M LOOKING AT CONQUERORS TONIGHT.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OVERCOMERS IN THIS AGE THAT WILL
[1:31:04] CONQUER SIN, CONQUER UNBELIEF, CONQUER
[1:31:07] THE DARKNESS OF THE AGES, BREAK THROUGH
[1:31:09] THE LIGHT. AMEN. DISPEL THE DARKNESS,
[1:31:12] TAKE THE SWORD OF THE WORD AND PRESS
[1:31:15] THROUGH THE ENEMY. COME ON, CHURCH. WE
[1:31:17] ARE A PEOPLE WHO ARE CONQUERORS.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT LEAVING OUT OF HERE DEFEATED.
[1:31:23] WE ARE LEAVING HERE A BRIDE, OVERCOMER,
[1:31:26] VICTORIOUS.
[1:31:28] AMEN. WITHOUT SPOT OR WITHOUT A WRINKLE
[1:31:31] OR WITHOUT A BLEMISH.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. People that ascend in faith
[1:31:36] and authority, they're casting down
[1:31:39] demonic strongholds,
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; overcoming Satan, for they overcome him
[1:31:45] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:31:48] of their testimony, and they love not
[1:31:50] their lives unto the death.
[1:31:53] So we are in the adoption age
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; and so this being the adoption age
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; where full sons are manifested
[1:32:04] because we have received the full word.
[1:32:08] Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Creation itself waits for this
[1:32:12] unveiling.
[1:32:14] It has been LONGING FOR THAT TIME. AND
[1:32:16] HERE WE ARE AT THE CLIMAX
[1:32:20] AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID WHEN FULL SONS
[1:32:23] OF GOD ARE MANIFESTED.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; That'll take every power away from THE
[1:32:28] DEVIL.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; WHAT AN AGE.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT A CALLING.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO AS ADOPTED SONS, WE ARE
[1:32:37] ASCENDING.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; I'm using some of my titles now.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; ADOPTED SONS, ASCENDING. WE'RE WE ARE
[1:32:45] NOT GOING TO DECLINE.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT A PART OF THE FALLEN WORLD.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; WE ARE A PART OF THE PEOPLE THAT ASCEND.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS THESE SONS ASCEND SPIRITUALLY,
[1:32:57] SATAN AND HIS ANGELS ARE CAST DOWN.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, WE'RE ALSO LIVING IN THE
[1:33:02] CASTING DOWN OF SATAN AS A BRIDE RISES
[1:33:06] TAKING HER position
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; in heavenly places.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it? They recognize and
[1:33:14] they operate in their legal rights
[1:33:17] [snorts]
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; that has been given to them by the
[1:33:19] mighty angel.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; You wasn't handed this by Bible school.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; You wasn't given this to BY THEOLOGIANS.
[1:33:28] THE MIGHTY ANGEL HAS ANOINTED YOU AND
[1:33:31] HANDED YOU AN OPEN BOOK THAT WE HAVE ATE
[1:33:35] AND WE HAVE DIGESTED
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; AND NOW IT IS THE TIME TO SPEAK IT.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. PEOPLE THAT WILL SPEAK TO
[1:33:44] THEIR MOUNTAINS.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; A PEOPLE THAT WILL SPEAK TO
[1:33:47] DIFFICULTIES.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; A PEOPLE THAT WILL RISE UP WITH A FAITH
[1:33:52] LIKE NONE OTHER IN ANY OTHER AGE. A
[1:33:55] PEOPLE WITH RAPTURING GRACE AND
[1:33:57] RAPTURING FAITH.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; A people who brings heaven's atmosphere
[1:34:03] down to earth,
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; love, faith, holiness, power,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; and the resurrection
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; and rapture.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; How are we going to do this? My next
[1:34:15] title,
[1:34:17] adopted sons, the power of the blood.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Their authority isn't self-confidence.
[1:34:25] It's the blood
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; cleansed, justified, redeemed.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we can move mountains by
[1:34:33] FAITH IN HIS NAME. WHY? BECAUSE WE'RE
[1:34:35] UNDER THE BLOOD.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; IF MOSES COULD DO IT UNDER THE BLOOD OF
[1:34:39] BULLS AND GOATS, WHAT ABOUT YOU AND I
[1:34:42] WHO HAVE COME UNDER THE TOKEN,
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; THE VERY BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OPERATING IN POWER AND AUTHORITY
[1:34:49] OF the word.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in doing so, we are clearing
[1:34:54] the channels.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Clearing the channels between us and God
[1:34:59] by and making a way to meet him in the
[1:35:03] air, heaven's atmosphere.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; You see, by the blood, the channels are
[1:35:08] cleared. There's nothing between the
[1:35:11] soul and the savior.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; The way has been opened for the bride to
[1:35:15] ascend.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Clearing out unbelief, every demon
[1:35:19] power that opposes him. Therefore, WE
[1:35:23] KNOWING THAT TAKE OUR POSITION AS KINGS
[1:35:27] AND PRIESTS.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; AGAIN, ADOPTED SONS as kings and
[1:35:32] priests. We reign AS KINGS. WE RULE
[1:35:35] ATMOSPHERES.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. LISTEN, I KNOW THAT TRAGEDIES
[1:35:41] HAPPEN. I KNOW THAT TROUBLES COME. But I
[1:35:44] I I KNOW THAT WE WE HAVE A LOT OF
[1:35:46] DIFFICULTIES. But I'm telling you right
[1:35:49] now, you were called of God to change
[1:35:51] the atmosphere.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are a creator
[1:35:56] yourself.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; And you can choose the atmosphere that
[1:36:00] you walk in. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE WORLD
[1:36:02] IS LIKE.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE THE ATMOSPHERE OF SATAN'S
[1:36:06] EDEN. You can create an atmosphere
[1:36:08] around you, YOUR HOME, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR
[1:36:11] CHURCH. COME ON. AN ATMOSPHERE OF FAITH
[1:36:14] AND BELIEVE HIM. AN ATMOSPHERE OF POWER,
[1:36:17] A ATMOSPHERE THAT DEMONS CANNOT TROD IN.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Because he hath made us kings and
[1:36:28] priests.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; It was in us that made us this.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Our authority is not self-made.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Our authority comes handed to us by the
[1:36:38] mighty angel himself.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know what that brings
[1:36:43] again? Another one, the atmosphere for
[1:36:47] rapture.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; You see, their faith creates a rapture
[1:36:53] atmosphere.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Their faith climaxes in the GREATEST
[1:37:00] DIVINE healing movement
[1:37:03] OF ALL.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; THE CHANGE OF THE BODY.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN YOU CAN STACK UP EVERY MIRACLE.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH me now? every miracle that
[1:37:15] HAPPENED IN THE 40S AND 50S AND AND AND
[1:37:18] ON DOWN THROUGH THE MINISTRY AND GREAT
[1:37:20] AND WONDERFUL MIRACLES AND STACK THEM
[1:37:22] all up and it pales in comparison
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; to the miracles that are laying before
[1:37:27] us.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. For we shall all be changed in a
[1:37:33] moment in a twinkling of an eye.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Missing limbs restored.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. EYEBALLS RESTORED.
[1:37:42] COME ON, SOMEBODY. THE OLD THE GRAY HAIR
[1:37:46] drift away and come back and and the the
[1:37:49] ages 21 years old again.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SICKNESS NO MORE.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; GLORIFIED BODIES.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS THE THEOPHONY COMES TO UNITE
[1:38:01] WITH THE WITH THE BODY AND GLORIFIES IT.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; OH MY, I'm about ready to step into it.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like that tonight?
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to try on try on my new
[1:38:13] clothes.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Let me PUT ON A GLORIFIED BODY.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Not one that stooped with age. Not one
[1:38:20] THAT IS GRAY AND NOT ONE THAT HAS HIS
[1:38:22] ACHES AND PAIN. But one THAT IS ETERNAL
[1:38:25] IN the heavens, united with that
[1:38:27] eternity, that thought of God.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; For we shall all be changed
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; in a moment,
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; in a twinkling of an eye.
[1:38:38] You talk about a massive divine healing
[1:38:41] move.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; As I think about, you know, brother
[1:38:45] Bossworth knew about and exercise mass
[1:38:48] prayers and there would be mass
[1:38:50] healings.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; We're about to receive a mass healing.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Not one or two get healed.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; But every living member of the bride of
[1:39:00] Christ.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So therefore, we are possessors of
[1:39:06] the heavenlies, possessing heavenly
[1:39:09] places in Christ JESUS WITH THE ABILITY
[1:39:12] TO BRING heaven down to earth.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND OF COURSE, WHAT IS IT? WE ARE
[1:39:20] THE WE ARE COMPLETING THE HARVEST CYCLE.
[1:39:24] YOU REMEMBER I I SPOKE ON THE two loaves
[1:39:26] and how that at Pentecost that it was it
[1:39:30] was not a sheath waved like this.
[1:39:34] We get the wrong idea. We think of of a
[1:39:36] gathering like that. Oh, no. That's not
[1:39:38] what what it was at Pentecost. It was
[1:39:41] not a sheath taken like that. It was a
[1:39:43] sheath that had been taken and now had
[1:39:46] been refined into flour
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; and now had made loaves of bread.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so again we come now to two
[1:39:59] loaves. You know there at at the first
[1:40:02] harvest uh there there was two loaves.
[1:40:06] Jews and Gentiles.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; We come here to the LAST HARVEST AND AND
[1:40:11] AND LOOK WHAT IT IS. TWO GROUPS OF
[1:40:14] PEOPLE SEALED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; AND AND THE BREAD THIS TIME IS THE TYPE
[1:40:20] CHANGES. AND AND WE KNOW un unleavened
[1:40:23] bread is considered holy and righteous
[1:40:25] and whatever. And many times leaven
[1:40:28] represents sin, but in this case, IN
[1:40:31] THIS TYPE, IT DOESN'T REPRESENT SIN and
[1:40:33] unbelief cuz there ain't no sin and
[1:40:35] unbelief in this bride.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; THEOLOGIANS WILL TELL YOU, "OH, THE
[1:40:41] LOAVES HAVE LEAVEN IN IT BECAUSE WE
[1:40:43] CAN'T overcome sin."
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT WHY THE LOAVES have leaven in
[1:40:48] it. THE LEAVEN DOES NOT REPRESENT SIN.
[1:40:52] IT REPRESENTS THE QUICKENING POWER OF
[1:40:55] THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT GIVES THE LIFT. THAT'S
[1:41:00] WHAT MAKES US THE BREAD. THAT'S WHAT
[1:41:03] MAKES US THE LOAF.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; So we Where does this happen? Again,
[1:41:10] another sermon title, the climax of the
[1:41:13] harvest. I'm going right back. The year
[1:41:16] in and review coming right on in. The
[1:41:20] seed planted at Pentecost, buried
[1:41:22] through the dark ages, sprouted in the
[1:41:25] reformation, now returns to full drain
[1:41:28] for the harvest.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; But there again, we have we change our
[1:41:33] focus just a little bit and we speak
[1:41:35] about the great separation, the two
[1:41:39] vines, because the wheat and the tear
[1:41:42] mature together.
[1:41:44] And the true and false vines both bear
[1:41:47] fruit, but one is gathered for the
[1:41:50] garner and the other for the burning.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; And so we are also in a time of
[1:41:56] separation.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Now that brings us to Leodysia, the last
[1:42:02] age being the rapturing age BECAUSE THE
[1:42:05] BRIDE IS RAPTURED out of the seventh
[1:42:09] church age.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Now I'm just telling you friends, this
[1:42:12] is where we're at. We're in the seventh
[1:42:14] age.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Where the bride is raptured,
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; called out in this age
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; now. And and of course, if we're going
[1:42:22] TO DO THAT, YOU REMEMBER I I TOOK and I
[1:42:25] took you all the way from time to
[1:42:28] ETERNITY
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; AND WE STARTED BACK WHERE TIME began and
[1:42:33] where so when sin entered into the
[1:42:35] picture and and time has has been and
[1:42:38] and come through the times of Israel and
[1:42:41] the old covenant, the times of the
[1:42:42] Gentiles and and bring it into the new
[1:42:45] covenant and coming right on down into
[1:42:47] the seven church ages and all of that
[1:42:50] and time will continue right on even
[1:42:54] into the millennium
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; which is the seventh day.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; But then it CEASES AFTER THE WHITE
[1:43:00] THRONE JUDGMENT
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; as eternity fully dawn and we go into
[1:43:06] the eighth day of the new heavens and
[1:43:09] the new earth. Friends, we have just
[1:43:12] begun
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; discovering the great things of God.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But you know when
[1:43:21] Leodysia also comes the most deceiving
[1:43:24] age.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; It is the most deceptive age of Matthew
[1:43:28] 24:24 that and many will miss this hour
[1:43:32] and enter into tribulation. Multitudes
[1:43:35] will be will go into that. BUT YOU KNOW
[1:43:39] FOR US WE HAVE A DIVINE VACCINE
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; THAT INOCULATES US
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; FROM EVER HAVING TO go through the
[1:43:46] tribulation. Amen.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR THAT?
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT IS CALLED THE ETERNAL
[1:43:53] PRESCRIPTION.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; OH YES.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHAT WHERE YET GOD RESTORES
[1:43:59] what was lost. The new birth RETURNS
[1:44:02] EXACTLY as Peter preached it. Repent and
[1:44:05] be baptized every one of you. And you
[1:44:08] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:44:10] Ghost.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; For this promise is to you even you in
[1:44:14] this last age of Leodysia. Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is he doing? Remember I
[1:44:20] came back from brother Biscos where I I
[1:44:23] spoke his service on of the of the arrow
[1:44:27] of deliverance and and I spoke of how
[1:44:30] that we must now take the bow in our
[1:44:32] hands. And I spoke of a sermon CALLED
[1:44:35] AND I SOUGHT for a man that God IN THIS
[1:44:39] AGE IN THIS TIME is is birthing men of
[1:44:44] responsibility.
[1:44:46] husbands, fathers, LEADERS WHO WILL GIVE
[1:44:49] THE WORD PREEMINENCE,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; WHO WILL GIVE MAKE THE WORD FIRST IN
[1:44:54] THEIR LIVES.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; I SPOKE THEN ABOUT HOW WE MUST BREAK THE
[1:44:59] CYCLE OF REVIVAL AND DEATH. THAT THESE
[1:45:02] SONS THAT HAVE BEEN CALLED, THESE MEN OF
[1:45:05] RESPONSIBILITY THAT GOD IS SEEKING FOR
[1:45:09] HERE, THEY BREAK THE HISTORIC CYCLE OF
[1:45:11] REVIVAL FOLLOWED BY DEATH. THEY DON'T
[1:45:14] SETTLE DOWN INTO FORM. They remain in
[1:45:17] life.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Remember, we're going to BE THE LIVING
[1:45:21] BRIDE, ALIVE [screaming] AND REMAIN.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; NOT A DEAD CHURCH.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; COME ON. NOT AN EMOTIONLESS CHURCH.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT A POWERLESS CHURCH,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; BUT A LIVING BRIDE.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; And then and what will we do? We will
[1:45:39] pull down strongholds.
[1:45:41] And as we pull down strongholds, we cast
[1:45:44] down imaginations and every high thing
[1:45:47] that exalts itself against the word of
[1:45:49] God.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We stand blameless before him in
[1:45:53] his sight. Therefore, we we cast down
[1:45:57] imaginations.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; So now then we begin to speak then about
[1:46:00] the seal of God and its evidence because
[1:46:03] the shield is not an emotion. Neither
[1:46:07] are is it intellectualism.
[1:46:10] It is Christ living in us.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; It is present truth believed and
[1:46:15] manifested.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; THEN I SPOKE ABOUT THE THE ANOINTING and
[1:46:19] the seal. How that the bride MUST HAVE
[1:46:22] BOTH. SHE MUST HAVE THE ANOINTING to do
[1:46:26] exploits.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But she has TO HAVE THE SEAL FOR
[1:46:32] eternal pers.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING WILL COME AND GO. RIGHT.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THERE UPON ELIJAH, UPON MOSES,
[1:46:40] UPON JEREMIAH, UPON AND IT WOULD ASCEND
[1:46:43] AND IT WOULD COME UPON THEM AND IT WOULD
[1:46:45] LEAVE. That's
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; The anointing would come upon even false
[1:46:49] ones like
[1:46:52] Zechariah or um yeah or the one there at
[1:46:56] the temple that that prophesied of of
[1:46:58] his death.
[1:47:01] Are you with me?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. COME UPON ONES LIKE BALUM, LIKE
[1:47:05] UPON JUDAS. THE ANOINTING WOULD GIVE
[1:47:08] POWER FOR EXPLOITS.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SEAL, AMEN, SEALS YOU TO THE DAY
[1:47:14] OF REDEMPTION.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR IT ABIDES FOREVER. BUT WE NEED
[1:47:20] BOTH.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; WE NEED THE ANOINTING TO DO EXPLOITS,
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; BUT WE NEED THE SEAL TO KEEP US IN THE
[1:47:29] HOUR of temptation. Yes.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we anointed, sealed, and
[1:47:36] adopted.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; We've been anointed for service, sealed
[1:47:40] for eternity, and adopted as sons.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; And that brings us now
[1:47:48] to the invisible union
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; because that's what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:47:52] By receiving the fullness of the spirit,
[1:47:54] the bride moves or enters into an
[1:47:58] invisible marriage covenant.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Christ in union with the church.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; AND IN DOING SO, HE PRODUCES she
[1:48:07] produces wordborn children.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS HIS WIFE, SHE RECEIVES A SEED.
[1:48:13] SHE BRINGS FORTH WORD-BORN CHILDREN. NOT
[1:48:16] DENOMINATIONALISM.
[1:48:18] AMEN. BUT ACTS 2:38 believers
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; to quote BROTHER BRANDHAM HE SAID
[1:48:23] BABBLING SCREAMING YOU KNOW YELLING
[1:48:25] SHOUTING ACTS 238 YOUNGSTERS TONGUE
[1:48:28] SPEAKING
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; come on HE SAID IT'S THE ONLY TIME THE
[1:48:31] WORD CAN BRING FORTH THEY LIVE THE SAME
[1:48:34] LIFE THAT WAS MANIFESTED ON THE DAY OF
[1:48:37] PENTECOST.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR HE SAID AS THE FATHER HATH
[1:48:41] SENT ME SO SEND I YOU. HOW DID THE
[1:48:44] FATHER send him? The father that sent
[1:48:46] him went in him. Amen.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; So he said, "I'm going to send you the
[1:48:49] same way."
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad we're not in this
[1:48:53] Leodysian age and Satan's Eden alone.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the God who sent us
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; is in us.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; And I'm looking here tonight upon
[1:49:04] wordborn children,
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; children of the word.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; So what was spoke in 2025
[1:49:12] was not just random.
[1:49:15] It was one continuous
[1:49:18] revelation. The capstone coming down and
[1:49:20] a bride rising up.
[1:49:23] And this is this is the closing of an
[1:49:28] age.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; And church, we are not we're not just
[1:49:33] merely just reviewed a year. We have
[1:49:36] actually stood beneath a capstone.
[1:49:40] And the SCRIPTURE SAID JESUS CHRIST IS
[1:49:43] THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[1:49:45] TODAY, FOREVER.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT GOD WAS YESTERDAY,
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; HE IS still
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HE IS TONIGHT, HE WILL BE WHEN
[1:49:55] time is no more.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; And the word that we have heard this
[1:49:59] year was not random. IT WAS NOT
[1:50:02] SCATTERED. It was progressive. It was
[1:50:04] with with purpose. It was preparing us.
[1:50:07] Amen.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "But let patience have a
[1:50:11] perfect work, that you may be perfect,
[1:50:14] an entire
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; wanting or lacking nothing."
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; And God's truly been patient with us. Oh
[1:50:21] yeah.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; The reason we're here in 2025,
[1:50:25] as I reflect,
[1:50:27] you know, I thought as a boy preacher,
[1:50:30] you know, brother Brandon reaching a
[1:50:32] milestone himself saying, "You're now
[1:50:35] with as a minister having 33 years of
[1:50:38] ministry." And I remember very very much
[1:50:42] the year I marked that 33rd year.
[1:50:47] And now, February the 1st, in this year
[1:50:51] to come,
[1:50:53] I will have ministered as long as
[1:50:56] brother Brandham lived,
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; 56 years.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, God has been
[1:51:05] longsuffering.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; I wanted him to come 56 years ago. Yes,
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; I looked and preached that he would
[1:51:17] come.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; And as I've said, he's come for many.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; There's been many that has laid in front
[1:51:24] of this pulpit,
[1:51:26] you know, that we have laid and planted
[1:51:28] his seeds in the garden.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; He's come for many,
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; but one day he's coming for all of us.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; And we stand at a threshold.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; And God has been very patient. bringing
[1:51:44] us from faith to faith.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; We have waited on some of you. Some of
[1:51:49] you weren't even born,
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; but your names were in the book
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; and had to be manifested on the earth
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; and you're here.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; One day, the last one will come in.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember these things as
[1:52:08] we bring this year to a close.
[1:52:13] The prophet said in Daniel 12:4, "Seal
[1:52:15] the book even to the time of the end."
[1:52:20] But in Revelation 22:10,
[1:52:23] John is later heard saying, "Seal not
[1:52:27] the sayings of this prophecy
[1:52:30] of this book, for the time is at hand."
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; We are in the hour of the unsealing.
[1:52:38] Amen.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; It has been opened. And I want to just
[1:52:44] say what was once sealed has now been
[1:52:47] opened. And with that opening comes
[1:52:50] responsibility.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Hear me now. What
[1:52:57] what we have heard comes with
[1:52:59] responsibility. And you cannot unhear
[1:53:03] what you have heard.
[1:53:05] AND WE CANNOT RETURN TO FORM WHEN LIFE
[1:53:08] HAS been revealed.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And we cannot live on yesterday's mana
[1:53:13] in a day of full grain because Jesus
[1:53:15] said, "Unto whom much is given, much is
[1:53:17] required."
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; So tonight, God is not just calling us
[1:53:22] some to some excitement.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; He's calling us to alignment.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just to noise and emotion, but
[1:53:29] to obedience to line with his word to
[1:53:32] say, "Oh God, let me measure up. I must
[1:53:36] flip the capstone
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; that is coming down."
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the capstone has come, then
[1:53:44] every stone beneath it must line up with
[1:53:47] it.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And if Christ is the head, then nothing
[1:53:51] else can rule but him.
[1:53:54] And if the bride is being made ready,
[1:53:56] then we must live as those who are
[1:53:59] expecting him.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you like I did with
[1:54:05] this church in 1977.
[1:54:09] When 1977 dawned and of course there was
[1:54:13] a lot of misunderstanding, a lot of
[1:54:15] ideas and many had said, "Well,
[1:54:20] this is the year." Brother Brandham said
[1:54:24] and of course he we didn't have
[1:54:26] everything that he said but you know
[1:54:28] there was a lot of misconceptions that
[1:54:30] was caused by it
[1:54:33] and I stood there that year as a young
[1:54:36] man 1977
[1:54:40] and I was like what
[1:54:43] 20 23 4 I don't know something like that
[1:54:48] but just as a young pastor standing ing
[1:54:51] in the church.
[1:54:53] And as I did, you know, I I told him, I
[1:54:56] said, "Church, you know, I don't know
[1:54:59] when he's coming."
[1:55:03] And yet we we got things that are people
[1:55:06] expecting and they're saying and and
[1:55:08] somebody even preach this year, well, if
[1:55:11] if Jesus doesn't come this year, Brother
[1:55:13] Bam's a false prophet. AND ALL KINDS of
[1:55:16] sayings that were went out and many
[1:55:19] would actually throw away their books
[1:55:21] and their tapes.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; So, well, it didn't come to pass the way
[1:55:27] they thought it would. And of course,
[1:55:29] you know, Brother Brandham said himself,
[1:55:30] I I don't say, don't go away from here
[1:55:32] and say, I said he's coming in 77.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know when he's coming. It could
[1:55:37] be a hundred years from now.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; I pray not.
[1:55:43] But nevertheless,
[1:55:45] as we think about it, as I stood that
[1:55:49] year, I gave this admonition to you, the
[1:55:52] church. We don't know when he's coming,
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; but we're going to live today
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; as if he's coming today.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; That's the way I want you to face the
[1:56:07] year ahead.
[1:56:09] So as we leave this place tonight, let
[1:56:13] us carry more than just a memory. Let's
[1:56:17] carry revelation.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Let's carry responsibility and
[1:56:21] expectation.
[1:56:23] Walk deeper into the purpose of God and
[1:56:25] sto stand fast. Hold the word. Stay
[1:56:27] under the blood. Create the right
[1:56:30] atmosphere.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Remain in the spirit. And may the God
[1:56:34] who began the work finish it
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; until our faith becomes sight and time
[1:56:41] gives way to eternity and the bride is
[1:56:43] changed to meet the Lord. God bless you.
[1:56:47] [applause]
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Wonderful words.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ask brother Phil and the choir
[1:57:02] to come. Let's just sing that song.
[1:57:05] You're worthy of it all. Let's just
[1:57:06] worship the Lord together.
[1:57:10] Amen.
[1:57:14] Key of G, I think.
[1:57:19] Amen.
[1:57:26] You are worthy of [singing and music] it
[1:57:28] all.

[1:59:09] your throne.
[1:59:13] And [singing] all the elders [music]
[1:59:17] cast their crown before the lamb
[1:59:23] of God [music and singing]
[1:59:25] and
[1:59:26] you're worthy of it all.
[1:59:31] I want you to lift your hands to him and
[1:59:32] sing [music] it. Oh, you're [singing]
[1:59:34] worthy of it all.
[1:59:38] [music]

[1:59:45] and to you [music] are all things.
[1:59:49] You [singing] deserve the glory.
[1:59:53] You are worthy.

[2:00:14] things
[2:00:15] and to you are all things.
[2:00:19] You [singing and music] deserve the
[2:00:21] glory.
[2:00:36] You'll sing this with us. [music]

[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; And Lord [singing] bless you
[2:01:06] and keep you
[2:01:10] and make his [singing] face shine upon
[2:01:13] you and be gracious to you. The Lord
[2:01:19] turn his
[2:01:22] face toward you
[2:01:26] and give you peace.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you

[2:13:56] Just so thankful for an opportunity,
[2:13:59] Lord, to be in your house once again in
[2:14:01] these last few moments of this year
[2:14:03] moving into another. Lord, as we've
[2:14:05] heard today, we look back looking at all
[2:14:08] you've done for us and how much you've
[2:14:10] been there for us. [music] How many
[2:14:12] times you healed us and delivered us,
[2:14:14] set us free, and Lord, knowing that the
[2:14:17] same God was that was with us yesterday
[2:14:19] is the same God that'll be with us
[2:14:20] tomorrow.
[2:14:22] Lord, we're looking, Father, for more
[2:14:24] deliverance and healings. And as we
[2:14:26] heard, Lord, of our pastor speaking,
[2:14:28] Lord, the greatest divine healing
[2:14:30] campaign to ever take place is the
[2:14:32] change of these bodies. And Lord, what a
[2:14:35] year, Father, for it to come, Lord.
[2:14:36] We're looking for that. We're in
[2:14:38] anticipation [music] for it. Ask you to
[2:14:40] bless each member of this church,
[2:14:42] Father, that is here, Lord. Lord, that
[2:14:44] can be a part, Father, God, that you
[2:14:46] would just be with them in this coming
[2:14:48] year, Father. May they see more of Jesus
[2:14:51] in their lives and more of you, Lord,
[2:14:53] and more of your presence, more of your
[2:14:56] life living through them in their homes
[2:14:58] and their families, Father. Lord,
[2:15:00] tonight we just want to make a prayer,
[2:15:02] an offering of Lord, a a prayer that you
[2:15:05] would just go out and get those last
[2:15:07] loved ones, Lord. And Lord, our our sons
[2:15:09] and daughters that are out there that
[2:15:11] the devil snared away, God, tonight, may
[2:15:13] you just begin to move in supernatural
[2:15:15] ways and break the yolks off their
[2:15:18] lives, Lord, and set them free. Oh God,
[2:15:21] we're just looking for that, Lord. Lord,
[2:15:24] as these last few come in, Lord, they
[2:15:26] may come in broken. They may come in
[2:15:28] scarred, but Lord, I I know as a parable
[2:15:30] it said, "Go into the highways and the
[2:15:32] byways. [music] My table's going to be
[2:15:34] full."
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're looking for that, Father.
[2:15:37] We're looking, Father, for your presence
[2:15:39] to be more real. And, Lord, more
[2:15:42] abundant and more powerful than ever
[2:15:44] before. We invite you into our lives a
[2:15:48] fresh and a new. Lord, we rededicate our
[2:15:51] lives a fresh and renew, a new Lord. We
[2:15:53] just give ourselves to you completely.
[2:15:55] [music] Surrender, Lord, for your will
[2:15:57] and for your way, Lord, for the food
[2:16:00] that's provided. We ask you to bless it.
[2:16:02] For the nourishment to our body, the
[2:16:04] strength we get from it, we give it back
[2:16:06] to you in Jesus [music] name. Amen. God
[2:16:10] bless you. Amen. We'll let you be
[2:16:12] dismissed and go to the fellowship hall
[2:16:14] and enjoy some time of fellowship
[2:16:17] together. Amen. Let's just go in the joy
[2:16:20] of the Lord.
