people to have the have our gathering like this and seeing young men young women that have been raised up nurtured in the things of God and you know what Greater Hope could you have as a young person to to to than to know Jesus and to know what he does in your life and how he changes you and makes you into a new creation and h a son or daughter of God and then you know with the blessings that flows you know the greatest thing you could ever have is salvation then the next greatest thing is to have a wonderful mate and that all only comes by Jesus don't come out from out in the world it comes by Jesus so you know and then then the blessings just flow from their own and on and on and on and they just pass from one generation to another generation and you want to you know even even maybe your children are all grown and raised and you say well brother Tim they're all grown and raised and I don't need Church oh yes you do you need to come and worship the Lord together and and then encourage others to do the same amen so God bless you for assembling together Jo Joshua 5 verse 1 we're going to read today a few of the verses of scripture and I'm going to be speaking on rolling away the reproach rolling away the reproach so Joshua chapter 5 and verse one read this together with me as we either on the board as you're looking or there in your Bibles or however and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on this side of Jordan Westward and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the Sea heard that the Lord had dried up the Waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until we were passed over that their hearts melted and neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of Israel and at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and Joshua made him Sharp knes and circumcised the children of Israel at the heel of the foreskins and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcised for the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were Men of War which came out of Egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord unto whom the Lord swear that he would not show them the land which the Lord uh swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stad them Joshua was circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they Abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off of you wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal un this day amen God bless you as you're seated know I I spoken to you about crossing over into the Holy Ghost which is our promised land it's the land of our inheritance and how we have been positioned there and I I thought today many of the songs that we we sung you know even uh point out to us our position our place and what we're called for far in this day and hour and um you know and and of course um I have spoke to you about you know con continuously about crossing over into the Holy Ghost and his promises and and and why why is this because it is as it was in the days of Noah the Bible says that we should reckon that day and of course we see the marriage the given in marriage we see the evil in the land and you know that the hearts of men on evil continually we see all of that but we also know that there in that day was a message and that message was get in the ark and of course today the ark we must get into is not this church it's not a certain group of people but it is the ark is the Holy Ghost and that is the message today so as Noah would scream out in his day there's going to be rain that will fall from Heaven we are saying there is fire that is about to fall from heaven and God has given us a way out of this all through and over the Judgment into a Rapture into a millennium ahead so you know the whole message of God is get in the ark amen and of course again the ark is the Holy Ghost now it is so important that that in the the second seal as the Angels were breaking the mystery of God that God would charge the people through the messenger you who have not been filled with the Holy Ghost I command you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ fall to your knees and don't get up until the Holy Spirit has Sanctified you thoroughly and filled you with his love and his goodness until your soul is So Satisfied in the presence of God that your whole desire is to serve him and walk with for him and work with him all the rest of your life now you know he could have just said you know you don't need the Holy Ghost we got something greater the seals are open but that ain't what he said he said that here as that you who have not been filled Fall on Your Knees and receive it it is it is of course imperative even it to to to know what God has charged us to do in this day and a prophet is charging us as the seals are open you know make sure you have that token now you say but well brother Tim this is all mot to me it really it doesn't apply I'm already in the land well I I'm just saying to you get deeper in it amen possess it all and dispossess your enemy you see I I I want to look at the the apostle judee's word in chapter 1 verse 20 he said but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourself in the love of God looking for the mercies of our Lord Jesus Christ un eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments spotted by the flesh oh yeah so again you know stay in the word faith comes by hearing and the hearing the word of God build yourself up under your on the Most Holy Faith exercise your faith prepare yourself for battle amen amen get ready to dispossess your enemy get ready to possess every promise of God Amen oh let me tell you you you need to look into the word of God today and say I am who he says I am I can do what he says I can do amen whatever the word says that's what I'm going to do it amen praying in the Holy Ghost notice here here is a commission to every one of you are spirit filled pray in the Holy Ghost have you ever prayed have you ever prayed until the Holy Ghost just took you over have you ever prayed in the spirit allowing the spirit to intercede proed through you pray in effectual fervent prayers that avails much this is an important part of possessing your land amen being able to defend your position or or deep or dispossess the enemy it's important that you know how to pray you know how to pray powerful atomic bombs of prayer brother bradam said it's the most powerful weapon there is that is that is on the face of the Earth is prayer he said it's more powerful than an atomic bomb I I wonder is the church using it are they afraid of of of what the world will say or what others will say or are they afraid to use what God has given them are we effectively using our prayers keep yourself in the love of God we're admonished keep yourself in the love of God forgive giving one another holding no grudges amen letting it go old ODS let them go hard feelings let them go this is all about dispossessing your enemy loving one another as Christ loved the church amen seeing God move you know and and and believing God for for your family for that which is lost so well I've got the Holy Ghost brother Tim I've already got it I've got everything you're preaching about we get it in your marriage Amen Let It Come let there come an atmosphere of godliness about you and positive Faith filled words that come out of your mouth amen many of you need to say God retrained my mouth I I've been uttering things that are unbelief I've been uttering things of what I see or what I hear or the circumstances around me rather than that using Faith filled words I can overcome I can Rise Above This I can have a happy home I can have God move on my behalf I can walk in health and healing you see again it has to come something to change that the Holy Ghost change the atmosphere about you where you quit seeing things in a negative light and see things in a positive light look at for Mercy learning to live to give and show Mercy one of the most Harless spirits that I've ever I've seen among message followers is wanting to condemn everyone else to Hell amen I'll tell you what if you knew what hell was about you wouldn't want nobody to go there not even your worst enemy in fact the matter is brother brandom said you know there is no mortal no matter what they have done that can condemn another that's right he said I tell you he said no man no mortal cannot condemn another and even Jesus when he was given opportunity to condemn he said neither do I condemn you that's just go and S no more the Bible said of some have compassion making a difference amen here in the Holy Ghost you can have compassion and make a difference you make a difference in a in a young person's life or somebody else's life lifting a bird and helping in a situation and the Bible says others save and I think this is really applicable to us because the fire is about to fall he said others safe pulling them out of the fire and hating even the Garment that is spotted by the flesh hating even the Garment refusing to wear the Garment spotted by flesh not just shunning evil but shunning even its appearance how do I overcome brother Tim and things how do I win the battle it's not just by shunning the evil but a shunning even the appearance of it you walk away as far as you can you you you refuse to walk you know along with in in in the past with unbelievers you hold yourself up through yet having compassion and mercy and inviting them to come and walk with you now in our reading Israel types of believer and they have left the Wilderness haven't come through as we would say the believer coming through justification and sanctification and up to the isua street tasting of the Holy Ghost at Caden but now Joshua has directed them into the land of promise and the and the Jordan has rolled back and and and and of course in this crossing the Jordan represents death now here every denomination when as as we see everything comes to his Jordan everything is coming to his Jordan every system of man every Kingdom of man everything is coming to its Jordan every denomination has come to its Jordan God no longer uses them God used them for time and they were a blessing for time but that's not his method today of his message amen is the the message for the Rapture is it doesn't come through denominational trumpets so every denomination comes to its Jordan ever create of man every man's idea and every man's theology has to come to his Jordan you just can't bring it in with you not in be in the land and this is what we are in this church age you cannot bring Leo Deo with you you cannot bring its lukewarmness you cannot you cannot rely upon its riches am man you you understand it's rich es will not get you in a Rapture there's only one thing and that's a gold that is Tried by fire and so again you you see we're in this church age that every system of man has come to his Jordan and has died in the wilderness and we have arrived to the Holy Ghost and its fullness you say oh brother Tim that that that is that isn't something everybody knows no that is this has not been true to this age since the first age there was a departing from the faith and only in this day has a God brought us back to the fullness of the Holy Ghost each other age received its portion of the spirit that would be justified by faith or Sanctified or have the gifts of the Spirit as a Zeus street but only in this age in this time has God brought a people back to the fullness so tell me is there ever been a time to preach the Holy Ghost like right now because right now is being pour out in his fullness not portions of the spirit not even something of anointing on your spirit realm but something within the soul something that seals to the day of redemption so it represents every believer where Jordan represents whereever believer comes where you die to self and with self road back then you pass through the Jordan through and leaving sin and unbelief behind that must stay in the wilderness it don't fit in the Holy Ghost and the land of the spirit remember the divine order now there was a divine order of bringing them across God had commanded Joshua to take the ark representing the word on the shoulders of the Levites and to pass through this Jordan you see again God had an ordained way and he ordained that through preaching of the word that man might be saved amen the Paul said it pleased God to the foolishness of what we preach to save those who believe so so again uh how was it that the Jordan is crossed it is crossed by the word on the shoulders of the levite making the way across the preaching of the word will get you to the altar through to death to S to come to your Jordan Amen to realize Sin is Sin and wrong is wrong amen and to condemn you of the of the evil in the past so it can die yeah I mean condemn it that it will die because you cannot bring sin across into the Holy Ghost and it takes the preaching of the word to do that you remember in the in the scripture even to return the word as we have had the return of the word in this day again we didn't get a new word a new word didn't come it was the return of the word and the same gospel that Paul preached returned to the church David had brought David what had a desire to bring the ark back to put it back in its place to bring it to Jerusalem because you know everywhere that the ark was the blessings flowed and because of the battle because of kabad being written over the doors of the hearts because that the glory of the Lord had Departed CA that the ark had been taken down to the villain Steins it had been moved out of his place and I'll tell you what we have went for years and years and years with the word out of its place we have went through centuries and ages and times with the word of God being on his place this is the day it returns Hallelujah do you realize where you're at you're in the day where the word is put back in his proper place and God is given pre Eminence you're you're you're in the you're in the day and the age where the truths of the Bible that have been misplaced are not placed in the proper place now I want you to think of this David did it he wanted the word returned but he actually brought death because he tried to bring the ark the same way the Philistines did that's right you see he used their example they made a they made an ox and a card with and pulled by oxen or by by some cows and and here they were they take it taken these and put the Ark on it and put offerings in it all of that because judgment had struck them because they had the Ark of God Amen let me tell you here is stayed right down at the edge of Israel and had not been put in the proper place and David said the words got to be put back in the proper place that ought to be the desire of every Christian today Lord every word put right in its proper place whether it's Holiness let it be in its proper place amen whe whether it's healing let it be put in his proper place you know when the healing is put in this proper place then that Miracles take place when the gifts of the Spirit are put in the proper place God Speak amen God reveals himself but David there tried to bring the ark like the Philistines did and God had an ordained way to bring it right that's right and he failed to consult the word he failed to consult the prophet amen the prophet would have told him the word amen and so here he comes along with his own homemade new Ox card and bringing along and and they're dancing and they're shouting and they're rejoicing and everything before the ark and a man a sincere man reached out to steady the ark when it's when the oxin stumbled and he died you see it shows it will bring death for those not anointed of God to handle the ark you you you have to be careful with this you you got to realize even today only the anointed of God only the anointed of God can handle the ark it takes a man called it takes a man set apart it takes a man consecrated it takes a man who is a Nazarite to God Amen dedicated to God anointed by the spirit not somebody who just decides I'm going to be a preacher but somebody called of God and ordained of God to be used of God that's why we must have God called men that's right now death didn't come because David rejoiced and danced before the Lord that's not the reason death Came Death came because he didn't consult the word for how to bring the ark he copied the way the Philistines had sent the ark and back on a new Ox cart pulled by by some auction and David David would would would Stu and you know because of aza's death and they call it the breach of Aza you know and and there he went back and and and somehow no doubt Consulting with the prophet what did I do wrong what did we do to displease God what did we do to cause death to a man why did this happen and the Prophet come back to him said you didn't bring it God's ordained way I've got a way to have the word brought and the word must be restored by being carried on the shoulders of the Levites amen now it's the word that must be carried notice not Creeds of men a lot of men carry something and they're carrying a lot of things to the pulpit this morning but the Creeds of man Dogma set forth by man man's idea none of that will open Jordan amen it will none of that will open the promised land and all his promises but any true Minister will carry the word opening up the Jordan into the Holy Ghost a Creed a Creed or a dogma of saying I believe the message will not get you across Jordan preaching psychology the study of the Mind the science of Personality won't get you into the Holy Ghost it it won't even fix your marriage or your kids but a good dose of the Holy Ghost will Amen brother Tim what book should I read why why don't you read start with this one right here husbands love your wives as Christ love the church amen wives be obedient to your husband as un to the Lord why don't you just start with that why don't you just start with just letting the love of God so perminate your heart until it changes the atmosphere in your life and your home oh the only way you can come through Jordan of death to self and the Holy Ghost is by following the word carried by true Ministry and I just want to say there is a true Ministry I you know i' I've had to say I I've had to say to someone who who told me well I don't believe in the ministry I don't I don't believe in Preachers I don't believe in pastors I ain't found one that's true everyone that's going astray and I looked back and I said you can't say that and be a believer it's impossible that's impossible if you're a Believer you have to believe what God Said and God said God said I said in the church Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors some people can't be Pastor they evidently aren't cheap they sit right there and with the in the hearing of the ear that is still uncircumcised cannot hear what the spirit is saying amen but you see again again I don't care how many false Ministries rise up there has to be a true one somewhere amen it's it's impossible for it not to as I spoke to this brother about it you know and he said well I don't believe in Preachers I don't believe in pastors ain't never one of them I ain't never found one that's right I have never found one that stay true I've always seen them Sway and pulled away and I said well then you got a problem bigger than not thought you have a problem with your God your God is a little bitty weak God and a powerless God because if he's not able to keep a Man true to him and have someone to preach the unadulterated word he ain't God he ain't big enough but I want you to understand that God has raised up men in this hour just like he's raised up a bride in this hour men who will be true to the word the word still must be carried on the shoulders of ministers Jesus commissioned us to do it he showed but that the word preached by the ministry would open the river of death to self and make an entrance into the land of the promise true preachers are going to help you across Jordan they're going to make a way across Jordan they'll make altar calls available amen that preach sermons with conviction with power to change lives amen because they will stand in the middle of the river of Jordan amen with their feet planted in and see the waters part so you can cross Hallelujah I want you to consider the last words and the last instructions that Jesus gave to his disciples he said in Mark 16:15 he said go to all the world and preach the gospel to all creation this is what his whole desire was the instructions that he had was to give a commission and let me just say this is the Great Commission and brother Bram told us clearly denominations cannot fulfill this he said they can't agree on one scripture much less all of the scripture and all the Seven Seals have been open I'm quoting you from the invisible Union you can go read it yourself and and he said you know there the the seals have been opened and he said now now the Great Commission can be fulfilled do you realize we are the people that must fulfill the commission that we must finish the job Hallelujah not just preachers every one of us there's a bride not preachers amen God's not taking a bunch of preachers and them only he's taking a bride of people without spot or wrinkle and I'm talking about you and we have a commission to fulfill Luke 24:47 said that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem so again here was the instructions the last words of Jesus that repentance and remission of sin should be preached amen this is a important part of the word to do is preach repentance preach remission of sins preach their a god rich in Mercy preach there's a God of Grace that is bigger than your problem bigger than your past bigger than your sinsu but he instructed them not to preach until they were endued with powerful on high that don't you go don't you do anything till you're endued with powerful on high but when you get the Holy Ghost and preach because God doesn't want men preaching without the Holy Ghost yeah I've heard men brag and say I can I'm I can preach without the anointing well I don't want to hear it it's worthless amen it's just only puffed up ideas of man if you can preach without the anointing it's worthless we must have the anointing every service has got to be anointed every sermon has to be anointed amen every prayer an anointed prayer amen you know and we ought to be a people come together and say God whatever happens in this service let the anointing fall don't let us have a song without the [Applause] anointing I thought I thought today as I come to church and I just pushed the button and listening to some I guess they call it gospel great or something I thought well maybe maybe I can maybe I can enjoy a song from this as I go to church and I I heard Ling you know leaning on the Everlasting Arms and then they broke out into another and you know I I thought it was a a great song you know as it did but then it turned off just to be a see how you could show off how great your voice was reach the highest notes and you know everybody to admire how great a singer this was and you know all of that that's not glorifying God that's not worship come on worship is when a song gets anointed when we get moved by the spirit and and the Holy Ghost falls down upon us amen I believe in anointed musicians I believe we got them I believe in anointed singers I believe we have them amen I believe the song service was anointed this morning with an anointed anointed song leader amen I believe the whole service needs to be anointed and I believe the preacher needs to be anointed but also believe the congregation needs to be anointed and I say God let the anointing let don't remain just here on the pulpit but let it flow out all the way from the front all the way to the back pew when Peter preached he opened up the path the path through the Jordan over into the Holy Ghost he was given the key to do so that's right the key to back in the days of Joshua was the priest take the word put it on the shoulders and it'll open up a path this same key was used by Peter you don't believe it let me tell you when they come out of the upper room and they were empowered for on high the first thing that happened was a sermon was preached an anointed sermon and it was so anointed 3,000 got the Holy Ghost outwards Hallelujah they all come under that anointing verse 14 of chapter 2 of Acts says but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice well I don't believe in shouting well you just got in the wrong crowd amen you get filled with the Holy Ghost The Voice gets lifted up oh yeah I realized Jesus taught in the streets didn't look his voice but also realized that he stood at the feast and cried shouted If any man thirst let him come to me and drink Hallelujah and here Peter an anointed preacher steps out on the anointing and he lifts up his voice and said you men of Judea and all that dwell in Jerusalem be this known to you and hearken unto my words for these are not drunken as you supposed see and this is the third hour of the day but this is that which the prophet Joel has spoken listen he pointed right to the word amen here he is carrying the word this is out I'm going to explain what has happened you don't understand what is happening but let me tell you I can show you by the scripture and the scripture opened up understanding and opened up Jordan for many men and women that day and they were filled with the spirit of God what do Peter doing he's shouldering the word and as he shoulders the word then the question is asked what shall we do Brethren what shall we do men and Brethren and here he comes back again with prophetic words that are just as prophetic today repent amen leave your sin behind you amen come down through death to sth cross over this Jordan and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promis is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even right now to 2023 even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and he's still calling and you think his sermon was short it wasn't and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this un generation and they that gladly received the word were baptized and the same that were added to them was about 3,000 Souls you think it stopped there did preach and stopped there they hung it up from there no at the house of Cornelius Souls were saved when the word was preached while Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that believe amen oh my the preachers today would stand in the pull pit and preach fa Faith filled words words that will drive out sin and unbelief where the spirit of God will fall upon the people amen here again he said in in Romans 10:13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved it is through the preaching of the word that men shall call verse verse 14 Romans 10:14 now how then shall They Call On Him whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard amen and how shall they hear without a preacher you see God is an ordained way to get across this Jordan and the way the ordained way is the word carried on the shoulders of the levite and he says and how can they hear without a preacher well they ain't not I'm right you've got a problem your problem's with God you need to get it fixed amen amen and how shall they preach except they be sent that's so there again they have to be sin of God to be able to preach we don't want men just getting up and saying whatever comes to their mind or their own ideas come on we want men that are sent ordained called charged filled with the spirit knows how to cast Satan out amen hallelujah amen knowing their charge they have an ordained charge lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen and how shall they preach except to be sent as written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they've not all all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who have believed our report you see no matter how much the preacher preaches the report has to be believed and the effect on it is going to be on you believe in it if you believe the report then the arm of the Lord will be revealed to you it's easy for you as man just to fall on the doctor's report amen come on Amen but let's look at what was his report yes his report here is amen by his stripes you were healed so therefore what report are you going to believe so then faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God preached so it didn't say that it did say that that's exactly what it was talking about preaching the word and faith comes by hearing the word when it's preached amen the whole object of getting people together like this this morning is that Faith would rise to the level of the promise so there could be Deliverance in the house of God Amen look at the example of the Ethiopian unich he was a man of great position under Queen Candace who was in charge of all of her treasure and this man had come to Jerusalem and he had a scroll and he was reading from the book of Isaiah as he rode along in his Chariot and an angel comes and appears to Phillip who's an evangelist the Bible calls him an evangelist and led him to take a a desert route and and as he is walking along he's he he joins there along the trail with a man this unic he's from Ethiopia and he's reading he's reading and the and from Isaiah and the angel directs Phillip to join him in his Chariot so Philip running up to him heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah and said do you really understand what you're reading now listen he was re he was hearing the words of the prophet he was reading the recording amen he was rehearsing the recording of the prophet of God and he didn't understand what he was reading until a preacher preached that why we don't need them brother you might need them more than you think I know you know that that really goes against the grain because a lot of people don't think I need a preacher I don't need a pastor they'll show up when they want to attend when they want to pretend when they want to amen but I tell you what this this man realized he said how how can I understand it unless someone guides me so he invites philli to get up on the Chariot with him and the place that he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his Sher so he opened not his mouth and in his humiliation his judgment was taken away who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth so he looks over there at Philip he said you know this this man this prophet he speaking is this of himself or some other man and then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached to him jesusall Hallelujah am this would lead to the man's conversion it would open up the Jordan for him and lead him into the land of the Holy Ghost to the man said here's water what is hinder I want to be baptized right now amen and here he gets baptized and immediately the spirit of God picks Phillip up and transport him I don't know how many miles away to another place Hallelujah that's the way the gospel started that's the way the gospel has to End Amen now brother bradam tells us and spoken words in the original seed he goes over this and he said although an angel directed Phillip to the unic he did not preach to the angel did not preach to the unic he sent a preacher amen well God don't use Angels no more yes he does don't use him for you because you don't believe but he still uses Angels amen but God never committed I want you to get this he never committed his preaching and his gospel to an angel I'm quoting to a prophet of a prophet right now brother Brandon amen God came down below angels and committed to man which are Sons he never committed it to Angels you say well if an angel was preaching that God didn't ordain angels to preach the gospel he ordained men to preach the gospel he never said to the angels I'll be with you and in you he said to men I'll be with you and in you he never said to Angels the things I do you'll do also he said to men the things I do you'll do also the gospel comes by preaching of the word god manifests himself through human beings amen the only eyes that God has on Earth is mine and yours the only hands he has is our hands God working in his people God in his Universe God in his word God in his son God in his people amen I actually took that from two different places sources but listen this in the message look he said God could have chose to preach the gospel by the Sun by the Moon by the Stars by the wind or by nature but he chose men to preach the gospel and that's where the voice of God will come from so brother Tim can it come from Jeffersonville yeah if men preach it amen can it come from two son yeah when men preach it the gospel must be preached into all the world so the end can come amen you you know here here we come the devil has done his job to take every gift from the church and now has attacked the ministerial gifts and say there ain't no more because why is God's way of speaking to his church the voice of God will come from the unic have been to Jerusalem we know to to worship he had been with all the great rabbis but he but he but he couldn't understand the scripture so here he studying the prophecy of Isaiah and even though an angel directed Philip to unic The Germ of Life had to come through the body through Phillip now so what's now he said here's a son Philip had the germ the message the word that's how a child can be born Philip laid his hands upon Him Philip baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ there came forth the spirit of God now The Germ had to come from the body what body Christ's body correct and philli was a member of that body oh that's why it's so important the body realize as we have the germ of life amen to impart to those an angel can't do your job again spok in words Original Seed he said the same thing took place in Acts 10:48 Philip was on the housetop an angel direct him to cornel's house but where did the word come from the body an angel come and said don't worry don't call nothing unclean just go on don't think nothing and while Peter spoke these words not the angel not the Cardinal while Peter spake these words what he was the body he had the word the word took hold oh brother oh my the angel directed it but life come through the body of Christ Hallelujah life comes through the body oh it's important then that the body be filled with the spirit that an atmosphere of the spirit of God is there where people can cross their Jordan Paul on his way to Damascus same thing a vision directed him but ananas had the germ he had the word the prophet ananas saw Vision said go up and lay your hands on him and said brother Saul the Lord appeared to you in the road coming down how did he know he had the word the word the Lord came to the prophet he prophesied laid hands on him he come he has set me up here I might I might lay my hands upon you and you would be healed and receive the Holy Ghost receive your sight the scales fell off of his eyes he Rose he and was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and and went to study the angel directed it that's right but ananas had the seed germ it takes the spirit of God to give eternal life Hallelujah it has to come through the body amen now said well brother Tim that's the problem we don't you know we don't have prophets anymore or you know every every preacher of the Gospel is a new testament Prophet by the way that's a quote every preacher of the Gospel is a new testament Prophet I I don't know I don't know you know I don't know what people are expecting Brother Joseph to be other than a preacher because that's the only kind of prophet he could be amen a preacher a lonely preacher one of them that's you know that's uh that's scorned and and disbelieved in and said has nothing to say that's all he can ever be is a preacher every new every preacher is a new testament Prophet every anointed man of God preaches under the anointing under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost he actually prophesies while he preaches amen if you can receive it as God speaking to you this morning if the word is being preached and says you're healed you can receive that and say I'm Healed why cuz God just spoke by the anointing of God and he said a pastor in the pull pit is is as more Authority than an angel from heaven hallelujah amen you said well they're not needed well okay we'll find out if you're word bride or not if you're a word bride you'll believe all the word philli was sent to the unic this is f from signs of his coming certainly Lord he was sent there by an Angel but it took Philip's hands we realize a vision came to Paul on his road to Damascus but it took anan's hands the church that called out the elected one Peter was sent by Vision to Cornelius but it took the Apostle not the vision not the angel God I pray that you'll wake the people up and let them see the promises here it was given to the church whosoever sends you remit to them they're remitted Lord we know there's many of them that claim it but they're unauthorized Apostles because they're unscriptural now you see for believers to be filled the germ of Life the Holy Ghost has to pass through the body a church isn't necessary it has to pass through the body the Assembly of Believers isn't necessary a pastor isn't necessary it has to pass through the body God has to have a body of Believers with preachers who believe to pass on the germ of life amen when you see people in you know that and a church full of people that are not spirit filled you know there's a problem either the body is is dead or the preacher is dead or both we need live Ministry amen we need live Ministry live Ministry is Anointed Ministry called Ministry set apart Ministry God hiding himself in Simplicity brother Bram said he could have ordained a son if he wanted to deliver him he could have ordained a wind to deliver him he could have ordained an angel to deliver him but Hallelujah God can do whatever he wants to do well how do you know brother Brandon God won't leave his program that's the reason we know that this day has got to be simple God always works in Simplicity God in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preached the gospel but he ordained men for that purpose and he never changes it he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of men he ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being it was man and when he brought Deliverance to the people down there he sent a simple human being born of a simple family and a bunch of slaves speaking to Moses and he said oh what God God he is unfolding himself in Simplicity amen so let's look at Joshua 3:1 17 and the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people somebody say all all the people were passed clean over Jordan now remember what has happened the Jordan is at its flood stage it's impossible across it and God has an ordained way to get it open he wants to open the promised land now remember the Holy Ghost to the believer and what's he do he puts the word on the shoulders of the Levites and they step into the muddy Jordan and it opens and all the children of Israel pass over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over Jordan you see I want to just point it this way the Holy Ghost must be preached until all the people are crossed over not half the people not some of the people not just the elders but to the last little one every one of them yeah amen and that's why I'm standing here in this Jordan today making a path doing the best I can to make sure that every last one of you get over into the Holy Ghost don't want to leave none of you behind in the other side in the wilderness then Joshua said now while the water is held back while a priest are in Jordan I want every every tribe get a stone and make a Memorial I'm not leaving this Jordan you said until men and women roll up a memorial stone that they can point to and say it's right here that I crossed over Hallelujah that's what every man and woman needs to do come on as you're passing through pick up a stone of confession place it on the other side and look back every time the devil said you're not in the Holy Ghost you're not in the land the promise is not yours you look back right here right here is a stone right here I crossed over right here now devil you get out of my land you're the Intruder I'm not leaving Jordan until men and women roll up a moral Stone you know you have you have people screaming at you today get out of that Jordan people don't need an experience all they need to do is just have a mental idea they've crossed over a confession of Faith you know I can confess all Faith they want to they on the other side of Jordan a cross get on over on the other side amen now let let me go back over Satan has put every gift on the Shelf did you hear what I said Satan has put every gift of God on the Shelf whether it be tongues interpretations or Divine Healing or faith or working a Miracles or or inter you know whether it be prophecy all of them word of knowledge they have all been put on the Shelf Satan has done a great job putting it on the Shelf said well brother Tim where are the gifts well the devil put them on the Shelf here okay can you show them to me well no uh I don't I don't believe we have them I go to I

have it they're out of business it was for yesterday yesterday's menu won't do me no good I've got to have fresh manner [Applause] today Satan has put every gift on his shelf now he wants to put the ministry on the Shelf saying we don't need them anymore some of you in this right here today you got the ministry on the Shelf too you only want him when you need him you decide you need a little church today you'll show up you don't need church till next Sunday you don't show up God never make nothing out of you till you get saved what kind of Salvation death to that old self amen Satan has put every gift on his shelf he now wants to put the ministerial gifts on the Shelf saying we don't need them anymore even though the souls at Pentecost had recorded words of the prophets they still needed a preacher to tell them the way across J even though the unic had the recording of the Prophet life had to come from the body through Philip's preaching Faith had to come to the unic by hearing the word preached if Satan can get the gifts of ministry on the Shelf he'll have this bride defeated but I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to to stand right here in this Old River Jordan and say to the weary to the Wilderness wander come on home there is a path through here there is a real Holy Ghost and you can experience you can have it for yourself you can know that you know that you know that you know for that day you shall know that I'm in the father and the father me and I in [Applause] you I hear the MERS say ain't nobody in this church wants me nobody believes in me you know people sometimes get so ate up with guilt and Sorrows of your past don't stay there ain't nobody here wanting you to stay there amen ain't no real believer believer does what I just read you're in the Holy Ghost what are you do do you show Mercy on some have compassion even pull them out of the fire do anything you want to see people saved that's the way it is in this church we want to see people saved we God's not willing that any should perish why should we be willing if I can help a man that I know that's going to go through the tribulation for purging and wind up as a foolish virgin if I can help him get there I'm going to help him get there so should you of someh have compassion making a difference well nobody wants me nobody believes in me I know you just eat up with your guilt and the Sorrows of your past I'm just saying don't stay there none of us want you to stay there God doesn't want you to stay there and if we have the spirit of Christ we'll show Mercy we're standing in the Jordan that's what I'm doing this morning I'm saying I don't care how how you are if you're weary of sin if you're tired of the Wilderness Journey if you're tired of just going around and around the mountain if you're still just going back and trying to get Justified and forgiven again and and get you know there and Sanctified again and you know get a little taste of the Holy Ghost come on in there's more for you none of us want you to stay there we stand in the Jordan that's where this church stands today we stand in the middle of Jordan saying come on over to The Winning Side come on over this Jordan I tell you what you do if you'd like to be accepted in the blood forgiven of your sins then do what Isaiah 55:7 says let the wicked forsake his way that's the first thing forsake that old way denounce that old way leave that old way behind come on and the unrighteous man is thoughts nobody loves me God don't love me Church don't love me nobody wants me forsake those thoughts Amen Let Him return to the Lord and He will have mercy upon him if I can get you this come to Christ you'll have mercy upon him and to our God for he will what abundantly paron Hallelujah he's a God full of grace and mercy amen he's the father that says to the protocol come on home I've been looking for you I've been waiting for [Music] you there's been no parties without you come on in then we'll celebrate and the Holy Ghost lazen every promise brother brandham said about the restoration of the Bride tree you'll find this in palor canor P caterpillar but he said if God doesn't come in my generation I'll die on the stumps I'll die on the stump where the cankerworms eat it to believing that Jesus Christ Christ and his church and his word is the same yesterday today and forever I might not be able to reduce it out there in all these branches because the old sap lines of here the denomination and Creed cut me off and dropped me like a hot potato that may be true but I'll Stand loyal on the stump and cry that the hour will come God will restore his church to its former condition so brother Bram said if I if he don't come in my generation I'm going to stand right right here on this stump yeah and I'm going to say here the brid tree was a down but God said I will restore and if he doesn't do it now he's going to do it and I'm going to stand there and preach it and believe it until I see it amen true preachers will do the same they'll die on this stump believing and pointing to a living God who is the same yesterday today and forever you'll hear it in their desires as they pray you'll hear here and when they preach we will see the word returned and there are ministers Levites determine to shoulder it and let David's dance and rejoice before it amen ain't no true Levi carrying the word and it's being returned and Davids are dancing before them and rejoicing and shouting are going to say don't do that that's all out of order boys you know this is not what to do now this is not how dignified message Believers are no if we're returning the word Let The Davids dance let the people Rejoice why the word's coming back it's something to be happy about it's something to shout about don't try to stop it and shut it up they tried to do that with Jesus and he said if they hold her peace the rocks will cry out God's able to these stones to raise children Abraham John the Baptist said you won't believe God's going to have somebody who will amen but it can't be carried on the oxcarts of denominational theories of receiving the Holy Ghost by a dried eyed confession it can't come on oxcarts of psychology listen I believe God's training men for this hour to take the full inheritance why would you preach this brother Tim because I believe this message has been the message that has brought us over Jordan into the Holy Ghost to possess it all and as God listen brother Brandon said as God leads his people through great trials to purge them and sometimes it takes years to do it and as far myself I believe that right now God is training such men to meet the front line men who are going through and at times shook from their feet sometimes look like the whole things have fallen but yet in the midst of it all they know that Living God and they keep their face forward keep moving on that's where we are we're like Joshua being reckless in our calling amen we need more light we just call for it amen we called for we called for the moon to stay in this place and the Sun that was pretty reckless Faith he dared to believe God's word God you've ordained us to take this land and we're we're in this battle and we need more light oh God as long as we're here let the light shine brother bradam said and while we now we're determined to do all we can while the evening lights are shining Grant it Lord this is as he preaches the church Jesus May during this meeting cause men and women to take a new hold newly may you may may you raise up speakers with tongues interpreters of tongues may you raise up gifts of Prophecy raise up preachers and pastors evangelists and so forth that the church might be edified raise up missionaries to go in the field Yonder and bring forth this glorious Gospel wherever the word can shall go may it fall into good ground bring it forth a h hundredfold for we believe that we're at the End of the Age the consummation is near so now that we've crossed over it is the hour to roll away the reproach so Israel following the word carried by the Levites he crossed over Jordan into the land into the inheritance of the Lord and the first thing that happens is that at the that the reproach of Egypt has to be rolled away by coming into Covenant with God through circumcision the cutting off of the blesh notice the first thing into the new land is a rededication a new Consecration and enter into a covenant come on and at that time the Lord said to Joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time time so God had given this Covenant to Abram Abraham and his seed and cision was the sign of his Covenant I want you to stop for a moment as we talk about the Old Testament and then we'll go into the new because there is a circumcision of the New Covenant that is also must be or is required so in Genesis 7:11 and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your forkin and it shall be a token or sign of the Covenant bet me and you it's 1711 babe it's my granddaughter up there in case you wonder who I was calling babe so ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin it shall be a token of the Covenant betst me and you and so this is my Covenant which you'll keep between me and you and your seed after you every male child among you shall be circumcised look here now the requirement then look at what would happen if they don't verse 14 and the uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that so shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my Covenant now this is pretty serious right it's an act that must be kept it must be followed here if they're not they are not in Covenant with God and they and they are cut off so this commandment clearly states that circumcision acts as an outward physical sign of the Covenant between God and his people it was required to be in the Covenant in the Old Testament and for the New Testament there is also circumcision required now when God made this Covenant it was during the time of the giving of this Covenant which circumcision would be the sign of that God there would change Abraham and Sarah's name he would literally put a letter of his own name within their name signifying that the only way the supernatural birth of the son could come is by God coming down and becoming one with Abraham Abraham you can't do it you see ishmail was the child of his flesh and of his strength but Isaac was the child of the supernatural power of God and the only way an old man like that could do it is God to come down in him now when we enter into the Covenant at the new births we are to be circumcised at heart and God comes to dwell empowering you with the supernatural to live an overcoming life and there our name is changed from that of her Sinner and we are positioned as a Son of God once your name your identity was sinner now your identity is son you're recognized as God's child and in Covenant with him so circumcision was required sign of the Old Testament but under the New Covenant there was a new circumcision that was M that made the required physical circumcision completely unnecessary and obsolete now Paul had to deal with the church that beli the physical circumcision was a sign of the Covenant with God so you know they had big fight in the in the New Testament Church requiring them for physical circumcision because they they had these judaizers who were still the Bible said in Acts chapter 15 who were still Pharisees that believed that couldn't rightly divide the word of Truth and here even Paul and even Peter was trying to tell them listen it's not circumcision of the flesh that is needed we got a new circumcision today and it's the circumcision of the heart now Paul would say in Romans 4:3 for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness so Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness and he had that Faith before he was circumcised so the physical act of circumcision did not make him righteous his faith did but as a sign of his faith that he was in Covenant with God he received the act of circumcision now so before circumcision Abraham believed God and was declared righteous but after believing Abraham must have this sign of circumcision or be cut off trying to say I'm trying to get you something the same is true of the new birth now notice every child born in the family had to be circumcised let me just say every child born in the Kingdom Come on must be circumcised sir he must be born of Faith by believing but then after believing he must receive from God the sign of circumcision which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and any child without the circumcision the sign of the Holy Ghost is cut off yes none of them will go into Rapture cut off now brother Brandon was ask you know about that but you know we have faith there was a group of men come to him said but we have believed on the Lord and he said you know what more can a man do that than believe and he you know that Abraham was justified by faith and Abraham believed God and it was imputed him for for righteous what so what can a more that a man can do but believe and he said he he made it clear you certainly must believe you must confess with your mouth that Christ has raised from the dead and through his death has cleansed you from sin but then God gave him the Seal of circumcision to confirm his faith and when a man believes on the Lord Jesus Christ God gives him the baptism of the Holy Ghost to seal that he has recognized his Rapture righteous faith and give him the Seal of the Holy Ghost and if you say you believed and you've never received the Holy Ghost yet then God hasn't recognized your faith but God gave Abraham a sign of recognition of his faith by circumcision and he gives you a sign of the recognition of your confessed faith in him when he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost to seal it as a finished work how long until the day of your Redemption not to the next Revival but until the day you're redeemed from this Earth so let's look here Romans 2 and verse 28 for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly now we got a lot of Jews today anti-semitic ISM all that stuff going on in the world today but those are not the real Jews neither is that circumcision which is outward of the flesh but he is a Jew somebody with me which is one inwardly and the circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God so now I we're talking about Israel they're Jews but you're the real Israel they Seed of Abraham but you are the Royal Seed of Abraham and the way it is is because you are Seed of Abraham inwardly not tracing by your natural birth but by a spiritual birth and everyone that is Born Again is circumcised amen what not of the physical but of the heart and of the spirit look at Colossians 2 and verse 10 and you are complete in him Colossians 2:10 which is the head of all principality and Power in whom also you are circumcised amen hallelujah with a circumcision made without hands putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ so you are circumcised with a circumcision made without man's hands what man's hands that circumcise you that's the natural but you are circumcised in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ you see it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost that cuts sin and the world off of you now I want to get something to you you may not realize this when we're preaching this but this is so different in this Covenant you know the in the in the Old Testament the woman could not be saved except by Union with the man could not be in the Covenant because it was circumcision and she had to be joined in her H to her husband in order to receive it so the female could not be circumcised so therefore the husband was the atonement for her because they're one but in this last days it's totally different God has poured out his Spirit and the women are circumcised in the heart just like the man that's Hallelujah so it's all inclusive whether your husband believes or is an unbeliever doesn't have anything to do with you amen you have your own experience with God and are circumcised by the spirit in the heart it's a circumcision not made with hands and every child born to Kingdom must have the putting off the body the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the Seal of the Covenant no one can dwell in the promised land of the Holy Ghost without being circumcised it is the Seal of God am now every child every child every man every woman in the Kingdom must have righteousness imputed to him by faith and then be circumcised by receiving the Holy Ghost so it is not enough to say well I believe well then has God accepted your faith because when he accepts your faith he seals you to the day of redemption are you with me amen it's it's important to understand you you know that th this is what God requires now look I I want you to understand here that that they were Crossing Jordan and to the rest of the Holy Ghost and and here the reproach of Egypt was being removed and the Bible says in Deuteronomy 4:20 he brought you forth out of the iron furnace even out of Egypt to be to him a people of inheritance as this day listen sin was going to burn you up but God brought you out of that and he called you out of Egypt and brought you out of the slavery of sin and he removes you from the iron furnace of the fires of Hell of death and destruction of sin into a land of freedom and you're not slaves anymore you're land owners and a slave is not a land owner come on somebody a slave has no rights a slave belongs to another amen you are free born Hallelujah you're not slaves anymore you're hearing the new life and the reproach the reproach of being slaves and burning in the fires of Egypt you burned in your sex sins you burned in your adulteries you burned in your iniquities you burned in your your habits but now you have been delivered and brought out of the fiery furnace into the land of an inheritance the inheritance of the Saints amen the circumcision of Abraham it resulted in a promised son remember that's what his inheritance was he didn't inherit the land he was told your seed will inherit this but you you're going to get inheritance and it'll be a child right so you see the circumcision of Abraham resulted in receiving a a promised child now The Inheritance in the Book of Joshua in the crossing of Jordan was to receive the promised land of the abrahamic Covenant and required that the people be circumcised in Covenant with god with their reproach of Egypt cut off buddy there was a mass circumcision that took place in other words there was a can can I bring it up to date there was a lot of people got filled with the Holy Ghost they got in the message they come across come on Amen they they might have had their portion in Egypt they might have had their portion there that might have had their circumcision and that was their portion there but when they entered in these had not these had not got their birth under them they had not entered into Covenant under them they are over here in the new land and underneath this word they enter into a covenant with God hallelujah now who's going to possess the land circumcised Sons those who have cut all the world cut off his sin his unbelief cut off who's going to possess the land those who are no longer slaves those who are circumcised who the spirit the Holy Ghost has circumcised cut off and claimed them and filling them with deity as I said it wasn't angels that he said that I'll be in you and you and me it you he said I'll be in you and you and me amen you will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover not an angel oh God we need an angel to come down we need Sons to recognize their position in the land in the Holy Ghost and I'm a filled son I'm a I'm a called son I'm an ordained son I'm an aned son and he has anointed me to preach the gospel to cast out Devils he's anointed me to heal to Open the Eyes of the blind he promised he would do this that he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh until Sons and Daughters prophesy sister it's as important that the word of God is spoke out of your lips as much it is your husband or any other brother is it's important that you speak his word amen anointed until Sons see Visions listen listen under listen under this Covenant even men are bride of Christ under this Covenant even women are sons of God when we say sons of God we're all inclusive because in him there is neither male nor female and you are circumcised in him and my sons and my daughters they shall prophesy oh men will dream dreams and young men will see vision and all my handmaids all my daughters and my sons I'll pour out my spirit he promised he would do this pour out it's the word kenos not as if God was pouring something out of himself like you know you vomit something up you know something com that that's not you it's something come out of you wasn't you but literally God pouring himself into his people that's what it means when God pours out his spirit it's not not a third person it's not another person it's not a subservient person is not a a smaller person is not a minor person it's God hallelujah it's he himself being poured out into his people that's why in this land comes the bride coming to Christ started out with the groom coming this is now the bride coming we're going to have a meeting in the air yes but not before there's a bride coming and this bride has to be all the word God in morphe what is it is him changing his mask as with Abraham God coming to him doing what he couldn't do by the flesh bringing forth a son of the Supernatural and to bring the Rapture to bring Jes Jesus back the promised son it takes the pouring out of God's spirit again that's why circumcision is needed which is the pouring out of God's spirit it it cuts off the reproach of denomination of Egypt you see like like I said we are circumcised as we read circumcised with the circumcision made without hands putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ look at Jeremiah 6:10 To Whom Shall I speak and give warning that they may hear behold their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hear hearken behold the word of the Lord is unto them as a a reproach they have no Delight in it amen come on you can tell the uncircumcised they'll sit like a bum on the law they'll sit as Stone Face as they can they won't respond to the word they don't welcome it there come on Amen it shows you're uncircumcised come on if you're in Covenant with God Amen you ought to be able to least clap your hands raise your hand to God sing from the from the depths of your heart give praise unto God and not get mad when somebody ask you to do it in fact of the matter it ought to be shame that you have to be asked amen it ought to be coming out spontaneously amen even so come Lord Jesus Come into this service welcoming the word come on Amen going before it with Dancing with shouting welcoming the word amen we want it in this place we want it restored we want it here well brother Tim I I'm I'm just I'm just not a I'm I I'm just not responsive okay you're a stone but God's able out of stones to raise children Abraham amen well how you don't like that well okay let's see if we like this scripture remember here the word of the Lord's a reproach to these they have no Delight in it and their ear is uncircumcised they'll listen to tapes they'll listen to preaching of the word and their ears uncircumcised they don't listen they don't hear it or it's twisted by the time it gets there look at verse Acts 7:51 you stiff neck oh what if you had this for a preacher use stiff neck and uncircumcised and Harden ears you always do you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do you amen what's he do you're stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ear right you resist the Holy Ghost now this is what happens with the uncircumcised ear the Holy Ghost is resisted now God required Abraham and his seed to be circumcised as a sign for the believer he gives you the Holy Ghost is a sign the Holy Ghost circumcises the heart the ears of The Believer by cutting off the Surplus flesh all the things of the world the love of the world the pride of life the love of the Flesh and it puts you in love with Jesus with an Undying Love Now you know when you are uncircumcised in heart and ears you have difficulty having faith C faith comes by so if you got an uncircumcised ear then you are only hearing what circumstances says and not what the word says all right need some holy ghost on your ears faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word preached receiving the word brings understanding and obedience that's right the uncircumcised ear will hear the word of God and either flat out denied or doubted uncircumcised ears will hear the word of God but they hear it imperfectly usually because they're only hearing what they want to hear or they hear with such strong Prejudice that they reject the truth the uncircumcised ear will hear the Bible say are you ready for this that the Believers will speak with new tongues and will dismiss it as workings of the devil or something out of date or something God used to do but no longer does because it was actually for another day that's what the circumcised ear uncircumcised ear will hear the uncircumcised ear will hear days of Miracles as pass but what does the word say these signs shall follow them that believe to the end of the world in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new Tong they will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's Jesus last commission to his church his last commission the last thing that fell from his sacred lips as he departed this Dimension from for heaven stop here just a minute you know I just with brother Donnie and his family and there I was on my way to church just before she passed away sister Erica passed away and first I got a call from brother Donnie while I was still at the house and he said pray brother Tim pray right now she's in such bad pain and you know she just riding in bed and pray brother Tim pray so I pray he said I'm on my way to the hospital he got the hospital and I'm driving to church and he said brother Tim pray I'm going to put your on speaker phone pray and we prayed the pain subsided and let down and she became peaceful and one by one her family came in that day and she was able to give them some of her last words she as a mother she imparted some of the most precious things the last thing she would want to say to her children took them each one one at a time and even nieces and family members brought them in one by one and spoke with them had a wonderful day those those precious moments now let's go back 2,000 years ago Jesus is leaving the Earth his physical presence will no longer be there be the last time he's seen in fact of the matter he can't come back to the earth oh yeah he could come right now if he want no he can't he can walk down these aisles he can't his word says He can't and he can't cross over his word even for the Rapture he won't come to the Earth we will meet him in the air amen his feet his precious feet will not come to the Earth until till he comes down on the Mount of Olives and he Cleaves and two and the great armag getting battle is one that's right that's his word he can't come so here's his last moments to speak lip to ear with his with his beloved disciples and as he departs it's like a person dying you know they're leaving this world their last words last things are so important to leave with their loved ones but here Jesus was not dying but he was leaving the earth going to the heavens and so he said some things that that would be precious for was to leave is something precious to hold on to whatever you do hold on to this and he says these signs shall follow them that believe Amen in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongue they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's right last words last words go and preach into all the world last words how dare an uncir cze ears to hear that that was only for the 12 apostles or to bring that forward how dare and uncircumcised here to believe that was only for the prophet the seventh angel messenger for his time for his era that we in a different day my Lord left us can I say it make it personal the my Lord left me his last words to cherish to believe and to practice that's and God by his spirit is trying to cut off all that unbelief and restore our hearing from Heaven that we are redeemed Sons restored Sons following his footsteps as sons of God Amen like the second Adam walking walking like the first Adam walked with God in Eden and say be thou plucked up be planted over here when a tree didn't look right the wind was blowing said Peace by be still and it happened and he controlled it animals and everything on Earth he was God of the earth he had control and power in him and when a you say well that was Adam so let me just say when a spirit's born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it on his lips I know you're out there right now I'm ready Brother D I'm ready I'm going to speak some squirrels I I they want you to speak to that problem in your life to that unbelief that's been holding on that Shadow of Doubt that's been hanging over that atmosphere of Darkness hallelujah amen amen I I I don't know I don't know I'll be honest with you I quit eating squirrels a long time ago if you want tree rats that's your business but I've had all I want have had all the want of armadilla pawsum raccoon I figure out I need to eat all that you need another squirrel that's fine but what you really need is salvation in your house salvation in the house of God people believing and speaking the word amen that and believing it there and and re act to the word that Souls run to the Altar and are saved come on we need an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost AM where he moves in such a way brother that that the word is comes and saturates us with his presence and life comes into the body amen we need the word to be in the body where the sick can't stay stay there that Darkness has to leave dark Spirits has to go amen ever Mountain brother Brandon said when a man Spirit fills Spirit born man in faith takes the word into his heart and place it upon his lips why that's the same as deity he speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man I wonder today if you can say the Bible speaks of uncircumcised lips so then lips can be circumcised what about cutting off the utterance of unbelief coming out of your lips that negativity that doubt listen you don't have to continue living under a shadow the rest of your life this is where the Shadows have to go come on church amen you know every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man because his lips are circumcised I admittedly it isn't the Millennium yet where everything is subject to us but even right now even right now Church the demons have to obey our Command and when we lay hands on the sick they shall recover we are a people with circumcised lips we will not speak doubt that's right we will not we will not speak um utterances of depression we will confess the word we will speak the word and let it flash like lightning and watch Satan fall when Adam fell he operated in the shadow of death and and darkness redeemed Sons don't operate under death and fear and and oppression redeem Sons operate under the covering of the blood of Jesus Christ with a token sign of the Holy Ghost that daring Covenant with God as his representative acting in his name with power and authority over demonic Realms but uncircumcised years only hear what they regard from their doubt as against the gifts and moving of the spirit why they have no heart for it that's right right their heart is weighed down with doubt and fear it won't happen because it's not happening because of lukewarmness and complacency of unbelief then they dismiss it as something that it's just simply not for us it's just out of season so they make excuses uncircumcised ears hear the word of God imperfectly it is not hearing the word of faith it does not hear what the spirit says when the word is heard by the ear of the uncircumcised they can't believe it they become stiff neck and resist the Holy Ghost and even latch out against those who like St insist that God is the same yesterday today and forever uncircumcised lips speak the word of God imperfectly or incorrectly it just says well you know it's is not the season for miracles the gifts are now laid on the Shelf yeah the devil did that healing is a minor and we have the word now that's a lie if you had the word you'd have healing you can't have the word and not have healing you can't have the word and not come on and there not be prophecies and tongues and gifts of the Spirit and shouting and dancing and rejoicing you can't have the word and I do thatall you show me you show me where the prophet of God condemned he condemned them for doing it you know W without having the spirit of God and there they were they they were impersonating and living the wrong kind of life sure he condemned that but friends what he was against was not the the moving of the spirit of God he was against people shouting and dancing under emotion and not having the spirit and rejecting the word we are not word rejectors we're word receivers we have been circumcised by the word cleansed healing is only a minor when it's compared to Salvation of the Soul otherwise it's the very heart of God to heal he took whippings and stripes for your healing can I say that again he took whippings and stripes for you healing why even in the Old Testament he revealed himself in the name Jehovah Rafa The God Who heals the healing God God Is A Healer by name and he's a Healer by Nature it is the very nature of God I've already said it said it again the very nature of God to heal he says in Exodus 15:26 I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians for I am the Lord who heals you I am Jehovah Rafa that was the Old Testament look at the new Matthew 816 they brought unto him many that were possessed with the Devils oh if we could bring them to Jesus today and he cast out the spirits with his word and he healed all that was sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet sayth himself took our infirmities and bear our sicknesses h Hallelujah the uncircumcised lip will say well it's a word now so we don't need speakers in tongues we don't need healing we don't need one emotion in the church that's not the word the word never says that the word says if he's a savior he's a Healer the word said he ascended on high and gave gifts unto the unto men no word does it say he took them away uncircumcised men will take them away but God never will the word says that any religion without emotion is dead and should be buried amen I want to pass out a bunch of Shel to a lot of preachers around the message today to bury your old dead religion amen because if it's a real religion it'll have emotion in it it'll be something to shout about no wonder people ain't shouting in the churches today they ain't nothing been preached in a long long time that would cause anybody to shout amen but let it come where the word is preached there'll be shouting there'll be rejoicing when the word is returned there'll be dancing when the word is returned there'll be healing when the word is returned the circumcised year will he to said yes Lord [Applause] amen but uncircumcised lips give uncircumcised sounds if the trumpet sounds from un from the circumcised lip then faith will come by hearing the word preached amen there would be faith for miracles there would be faith for healing but it must fall upon circumcised ears that understand it and accept it Jesus dealt with people who gave lip service to it but their heart was uncircumcised like Cain the truth remains a mystery to them and they can't and and then they just say well you just take it or leave it you can't just take it or leave it either will God will become Supernatural to you or you won't go into Rapture either one or the other amen they won't take the circumcision Mark of God and the ears and the heart and instead the word becomes filtered through unbelief and when the Holy Ghost circumcises the ear it changes the way you hear things you have an ear to what the spirit says and the spirit says what the word says the uncircumcised here will hear preaching of signs following and say well that was for day going by or our pastor our church don't believe it that way or they don't believe in Emotion we just accept the Holy Ghost by faith no you can't amen you must start there believing and accept by faith but then you must receive something for crying out loud the Holy Ghost is not Faith the Holy Ghost is a person you can believe all you want too you can believe the moon is made out of cheese if you want to believe that you can call that Faith that's not real faith faith is based on the word faith is well we just accept the Holy Ghost by faith well that's an intellectual conception when you accept it by faith something happens when the Holy Ghost ghost comes the person of the Holy Ghost comes in like a rushing Mighty Wind and joy Bells starts ringing in your Souls making this man circumcising the heart and cutting off the doubts and dissolving the fear and when your heart gets happy
