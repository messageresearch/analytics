[1:00:48] and they said so do as thou said
[1:00:52] and abraham
[1:00:53] hastened into
[1:00:54] the tent unto sarah and said make ready
[1:00:58] quickly three measures of fine meal and
[1:01:01] knead it make cakes upon the heart and
[1:01:04] abraham ran into the herd and fetched um
[1:01:08] calf tender and good and gave it to the
[1:01:10] young men
[1:01:12] and he hastened to dress it and he took
[1:01:14] butter and milk and the calf which he
[1:01:16] had dressed and set it before them and
[1:01:19] they stood by them under and he stood by
[1:01:21] them under the tree
[1:01:23] and they did eat amen god bless you can
[1:01:26] be seated
[1:01:28] i want to welcome each one of you today
[1:01:30] in the wonderful name of jesus christ
[1:01:32] and to say it's a privilege to be here
[1:01:34] and gather together with you today
[1:01:37] we

[1:02:17] you know you you won't be an observer no
[1:02:19] more we're going to hand you a sword
[1:02:22] amen we get in the battle and we fight
[1:02:25] the good fight of faith
[1:02:27] oh my it's always good to be in the
[1:02:29] house of the lord and
[1:02:30] thanking god for all this goodness
[1:02:33] we saw um
[1:02:34] wednesday night a young brother come to
[1:02:37] the lord and surrender his life and many
[1:02:39] others down at the altar and we're
[1:02:41] thankful for the lord for that and he
[1:02:43] was a visitor from north carolina
[1:02:45] there a brother to brother manuel walker
[1:02:48] that um was also here and
[1:02:51] and uh they've been down doing a little
[1:02:53] bit of uh helping me a little bit on a
[1:02:56] little project that we have for the
[1:02:57] upcoming meetings to to host ministers
[1:03:01] and so on um
[1:03:03] now and in the future so it's um
[1:03:06] you know it's it was just a wonderful to
[1:03:07] see the lord just move upon a young
[1:03:09] man's heart
[1:03:11] and we can see that when you get in the
[1:03:13] presence of god
[1:03:14] lives are changed
[1:03:16] as he said i the young man told me he
[1:03:18] said i
[1:03:19] i don't believe in coincidence i do
[1:03:21] believe that the lord had this
[1:03:23] orchestrated but i never expected to get
[1:03:26] what i got
[1:03:27] amen so we thank the lord for what he
[1:03:29] did for us
[1:03:31] also we got um little jackson oglesby
[1:03:34] that wants to be baptized today in the
[1:03:36] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:03:39] and you know jackson is uh he's a
[1:03:42] special little guy
[1:03:43] not only special he's my grandson but
[1:03:46] you know he's uh been a
[1:03:48] really special little young man since he
[1:03:50] was born and has a real love for the
[1:03:53] lord and he may be young
[1:03:55] and a child yet but he um he really
[1:03:58] loves the lord and i i know grandma had
[1:04:02] him uh during the ohio camp meeting and
[1:04:04] they stayed up uh late and and watched
[1:04:08] the whole things and no he didn't sleep
[1:04:10] he got down on his knees and praying
[1:04:13] during the whole prayer line and all the
[1:04:15] way till about 12 1 in the morning so
[1:04:18] you know he just has a real sincere
[1:04:20] heart for god
[1:04:22] and so that's what we want to see is our
[1:04:25] young people come to know the lord jesus
[1:04:28] and i pray if you don't know him today
[1:04:30] you'll come to know him and to know him
[1:04:33] is to love him
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:36] and to to serve him
[1:04:38] now this morning i'm going to be
[1:04:40] speaking on the soul
[1:04:42] desire
[1:04:44] the soul's desire we're speaking about
[1:04:47] the feast
[1:04:48] with elohim
[1:04:50] and um you know as we have been on this
[1:04:53] subject of abraham of course you know
[1:04:55] brother branham almost preached on
[1:04:57] abraham nearly every sermon that he
[1:04:59] preached he would at least mention if he
[1:05:01] didn't preach the whole sermon on
[1:05:03] abraham in his life because
[1:05:05] it's a prophecy of the last day
[1:05:09] and so
[1:05:10] um here we are finding that that elohim
[1:05:13] comes the almighty god comes and
[1:05:16] and he
[1:05:18] he visits abraham under the tree at
[1:05:22] mamrie
[1:05:23] and while he is there we have read where
[1:05:25] abraham feeds him under the tree
[1:05:28] and then we see in the last verse that
[1:05:31] he that he stood there given his full
[1:05:34] attention
[1:05:35] to
[1:05:36] to those as they were were feeding and
[1:05:40] eating
[1:05:41] and i thought about how
[1:05:43] important this is in our day and hour
[1:05:46] seem like
[1:05:47] whether it be advertisement or some
[1:05:50] movie or some
[1:05:52] uh thing out even a billboard along the
[1:05:55] side everybody and everything's wanting
[1:05:58] a part of your mind
[1:06:00] they're wanting to come somehow another
[1:06:02] implant a thought of influence within
[1:06:06] you
[1:06:07] and and so it's very important on what
[1:06:10] you feed upon
[1:06:12] and i thought you know as we followed up
[1:06:14] on the ohio camp and
[1:06:16] and the experiences that you had and the
[1:06:20] things that god did and i i just want to
[1:06:22] instruct you as a pastor about feeding
[1:06:26] your experience
[1:06:28] on the word of god
[1:06:30] and so we we have seen here that this is
[1:06:33] an appearing of christ
[1:06:35] um that he appears to abraham and it was
[1:06:39] christ it was before he took on the
[1:06:41] flesh of jesus but it was it was the
[1:06:44] spirit of god and the here he comes and
[1:06:46] takes on flesh 16 elements and
[1:06:50] steps down into a body that he has made
[1:06:53] and and when he does some he is hungry
[1:06:57] and he is is dusty from walking upon the
[1:07:00] earth and he needs his feet washed
[1:07:03] and and of course um abraham sees him
[1:07:06] and the first thing that he is set upon
[1:07:09] is showing him some hospitality
[1:07:12] giving him food and seeing to his
[1:07:16] comfort and welcoming
[1:07:18] and i just want to say that we have been
[1:07:21] in this appearing
[1:07:23] since the message came
[1:07:26] this is what we are in we are in the
[1:07:28] time of the lord's appearing
[1:07:30] but i want you to understand where that
[1:07:33] he's appearing in
[1:07:34] remember brother branham would tell us
[1:07:37] that that there would be a forerunner in
[1:07:39] this last day and that as john the
[1:07:42] baptist was sent to vorun the first
[1:07:44] coming of christ
[1:07:45] he was sent with a message to forerun
[1:07:48] the second coming of christ but in this
[1:07:50] he says the fourth second forerunner
[1:07:53] will do the same as the first forerunner
[1:07:55] but this time
[1:07:56] pointing to a word born bride
[1:08:01] so i want you to understand the coming
[1:08:03] of christ when we're looking for his
[1:08:05] coming we remember that he comes in
[1:08:08] in on word form to a prophet and a
[1:08:12] message is given to us and that is
[1:08:14] ordered to get a bride and for that to
[1:08:17] take on flesh
[1:08:19] and so then his the second aspect of his
[1:08:22] coming is a bride coming
[1:08:24] because it would be no use for him to
[1:08:26] come
[1:08:27] unless there was a people made ready
[1:08:30] and so the word is given to us to make
[1:08:33] us ready to prepare us to meet the
[1:08:36] bridegroom and i'll just tell you as a
[1:08:38] pastor i want you ready to meet the
[1:08:41] bridegroom
[1:08:42] and of course he says he he tells us
[1:08:45] here that um
[1:08:47] again an unveiling of god
[1:08:50] he gives us some more insight upon this
[1:08:53] and he talks about how god would descend
[1:08:56] and he would appear to moses and and um
[1:08:59] and then that would be god manifested a
[1:09:03] god in portion to moses and then and
[1:09:06] then finally the fullness of god would
[1:09:08] come after being manifested through all
[1:09:11] the prophets and the psalms and the
[1:09:12] songs of solomon and all of that that
[1:09:15] now it would be all manifest in jesus
[1:09:18] and jesus is the fullness of the godhead
[1:09:22] bodily
[1:09:24] amen so when he came there it was the
[1:09:27] same god but he was just changing his
[1:09:30] mask as it was
[1:09:32] and so um
[1:09:33] the only thing he changed his mask he
[1:09:36] never changed his word he never changed
[1:09:39] his nature
[1:09:40] so whether it's god in portion or god in
[1:09:44] in fullness he is always the same
[1:09:46] yesterday today and forever
[1:09:49] and he only changes his forms he would
[1:09:52] change from noah to moses and james
[1:09:54] foreign from moses to david from david
[1:09:57] to joseph until finally the fullness of
[1:10:00] all the prophets and all of the psalms
[1:10:03] and all of the songs of david all of
[1:10:06] these the wisdom of solomon everything
[1:10:08] become all encapsulated in jesus christ
[1:10:13] and so
[1:10:14] there jesus would be the fullness then
[1:10:18] of all the prophets of psalms the wisdom
[1:10:21] of solomon on down right into jesus
[1:10:24] christ now he's been doing the same
[1:10:27] thing since
[1:10:28] the beginning of the church ages but
[1:10:31] this time god has been taken on
[1:10:34] different kinds of veils he showed he
[1:10:36] would would come and develop the flesh
[1:10:39] of man on the day of pentecost
[1:10:42] now in the reformation he would come
[1:10:44] through luther and wesley it would be
[1:10:47] god again revealing himself and taking
[1:10:50] on a veil he would use his church to
[1:10:53] reveal himself through and then finally
[1:10:56] it comes out again to the complete or
[1:10:59] the fullness of the godhead all that was
[1:11:02] in luther and wesley the justification
[1:11:05] there the sanctification there the
[1:11:06] baptism of the holy ghost of the azusa
[1:11:09] street revival all of that would be
[1:11:11] encapsulated
[1:11:13] in a bride people in this last days it
[1:11:16] comes out into the complete
[1:11:18] but before it comes to complete a
[1:11:20] prophet rises again
[1:11:23] and he foreshadows that and he reveals
[1:11:26] what's been left off so the church won't
[1:11:28] be without
[1:11:29] understanding and then he fades off the
[1:11:32] scene for he says as john did i must
[1:11:36] decrease he must increase
[1:11:39] now where he's going to increase is in
[1:11:41] the bride of christ until the actual
[1:11:45] consummation where he comes in a
[1:11:48] physical form and we are caught up to
[1:11:51] meet him in the air
[1:11:52] now understand then then how he's going
[1:11:55] to be in his people in this last day
[1:11:58] it'll be the same jesus
[1:12:01] in bright form it'll be the same power
[1:12:04] the same church the same word
[1:12:07] all encapsulated in a body called the
[1:12:10] bride of christ
[1:12:11] and it'll be the word that was in luther
[1:12:14] in wesley and all of the portions of
[1:12:17] scripture that had been illuminated now
[1:12:20] come alive in a people in the last day
[1:12:24] and finally he comes right down to where
[1:12:27] as it was seed at the wheat a seed that
[1:12:30] was planted on the day of pentecost now
[1:12:33] comes to harvest time and it comes back
[1:12:35] seed again when you get the seed you
[1:12:38] can't go any further than the seed other
[1:12:40] than take it into the garner into the
[1:12:43] rapture all right so you see there there
[1:12:46] again he is he has moved as it was like
[1:12:49] from luther to wesley to pentecostal the
[1:12:52] the tongues and the lips and to the eyes
[1:12:54] of the prophetic of malachi 4 and but
[1:12:57] then finally there's nothing else left
[1:13:00] but for him to step into it now so
[1:13:04] that's the last thing there is where the
[1:13:07] body is complete and he steps into that
[1:13:10] body and that's what god is doing in
[1:13:12] this last day is stepping into a bright
[1:13:15] body
[1:13:16] now so he can use your flesh just as
[1:13:19] well as he could create something back
[1:13:21] there
[1:13:22] when he when he appeared to abraham
[1:13:24] remember he would gather the dust and he
[1:13:26] would step into a body and appear to
[1:13:29] abraham
[1:13:30] under the tree of mammary when he did he
[1:13:33] would he would eat he would be washed
[1:13:35] and man there would be dust upon his
[1:13:37] clothes
[1:13:38] it's somebody with me but now you see he
[1:13:41] doesn't have to do that anymore create a
[1:13:44] body like that he creates one by the
[1:13:47] baptism of the holy ghost by cleansing
[1:13:50] the people god comes and dwells in that
[1:13:53] body
[1:13:54] so you see we ought to say here today
[1:13:56] god used my dust
[1:13:59] come and dwell in
[1:14:01] amen come use my body let my body be the
[1:14:05] temple of the holy ghost to dwell in
[1:14:07] place of god
[1:14:09] so the angel of the lord is here that
[1:14:11] same pillar of fire
[1:14:13] jehovah god in your flesh
[1:14:16] and in my flesh
[1:14:18] amen now so the son of man which is
[1:14:22] christ
[1:14:23] is being revealed in bride
[1:14:26] body
[1:14:27] now i'm getting this down to you because
[1:14:30] i want you to understand
[1:14:32] we're not talking about so much an
[1:14:34] external appearing now
[1:14:37] where that under a tree here comes a
[1:14:40] man in flesh
[1:14:43] and
[1:14:44] and abraham calls him lord
[1:14:46] and he entertains him
[1:14:49] but i want you to see where that it's
[1:14:52] going to be entertained is not out here
[1:14:55] under a tree somewhere
[1:14:57] somewhere external but now god has come
[1:15:00] internal
[1:15:04] and where the entertainment's going to
[1:15:06] take place where he's got to be fed is
[1:15:09] the inward man
[1:15:16] now then we have brought it from out
[1:15:18] there to in here
[1:15:22] because he's using my dust
[1:15:25] so god dwells in you
[1:15:27] the bible said if you don't have the
[1:15:29] spirit of christ you're none of his
[1:15:32] so the spirit of jesus christ comes to
[1:15:35] dwell in you by the baptism of the holy
[1:15:37] ghost
[1:15:38] let me just go through some scripture
[1:15:40] here for ephesians 3 16
[1:15:42] that he would grant you according to the
[1:15:44] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:15:47] by with his might by his spirit in the
[1:15:50] inner man
[1:15:52] so where is the strengthening come food
[1:15:56] strengthens the individual the diet
[1:15:58] look straightened with but with might by
[1:16:01] his spirit where
[1:16:04] in the inner man that christ may dwell
[1:16:08] in your hearts by faith
[1:16:12] so who's dwelling in you
[1:16:15] christ dwelling in you
[1:16:18] let's go again to ii corinthians 4 and 6
[1:16:21] for god who hath commanded the light to
[1:16:24] shine out of darkness has shined in your
[1:16:27] hearts to give the light of the
[1:16:29] knowledge of the glory of god in the
[1:16:31] face of jesus christ but we have
[1:16:34] this treasure jesus christ in earth and
[1:16:37] vessels
[1:16:38] not that that the excellency of the
[1:16:40] power may be of god and not of us
[1:16:44] so again he is the treasure
[1:16:47] in this earthen vessel
[1:16:52] and he should be treated with all and
[1:16:54] respect
[1:16:56] as a treasure
[1:16:59] so christ lives in us earth and vessels
[1:17:03] as a precious treasure revealing the
[1:17:06] glory of god to us from within
[1:17:10] so you see the difference between the
[1:17:12] old testament and the new testament they
[1:17:14] have an external religion
[1:17:16] but ours is an internal religion
[1:17:20] it's where god comes into the heart and
[1:17:22] dwells and the nature of god lives on
[1:17:25] the inside of you
[1:17:27] and when it does it has the same desires
[1:17:31] that god has
[1:17:34] now galatians chapter 1 and verse 15
[1:17:37] for he said when he pleased god who set
[1:17:40] me apart from my mother's womb and
[1:17:42] called me by his grace
[1:17:44] and
[1:17:45] and
[1:17:46] to reveal his son
[1:17:48] in me notice where christ had to be
[1:17:52] revealed in
[1:17:54] here's where the revealing of christ
[1:17:56] takes place
[1:17:57] it's more than a doctrine
[1:18:00] it's more than a teaching or a book of
[1:18:03] creeds or dogmas of man
[1:18:06] it is absolutely the revealing of christ
[1:18:10] in
[1:18:10] you remember again as christ and you
[1:18:14] that's the hope of glory
[1:18:17] without christ in you there is no hope
[1:18:19] for you in glory
[1:18:22] amen now we might think this verse
[1:18:24] should read it pleased god to reveal his
[1:18:26] son to me
[1:18:28] but in the greek the original language
[1:18:30] this unmistakable a preposition there of
[1:18:33] ends so the verse reads to reveal his
[1:18:36] son in
[1:18:37] me
[1:18:38] here's where the revelation of christ
[1:18:41] has got to be is in you
[1:18:45] so god's plan is to reveal his son and
[1:18:48] us
[1:18:49] rather than to us
[1:18:52] because if it's just to us it's still an
[1:18:55] external religion
[1:18:57] it's it's law it's not grace when it's
[1:19:00] grace is something a work in the inward
[1:19:03] man
[1:19:05] now again galatians 2 20 it is no longer
[1:19:09] i who live but christ who lives in me
[1:19:13] so paul is very explicit christ is
[1:19:16] living on the inside of me
[1:19:18] and because he lives in us the christian
[1:19:22] life is not a matter of trying to behave
[1:19:26] like jesus
[1:19:28] but instead of allowing him to live in
[1:19:31] us and through us
[1:19:33] it's no longer you trying it's him
[1:19:36] living out of you
[1:19:38] now so so paul would say to the christ
[1:19:41] lives in me it's a marvelous statement
[1:19:44] of what it means to be a christian
[1:19:46] the almighty god can dwell within you
[1:19:50] reside within your soul
[1:19:53] so now think about how the bible puts
[1:19:55] this in revelation 3 20 and here's a
[1:19:58] verse to our age
[1:20:00] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:20:05] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:20:08] door i will come in to him
[1:20:12] and i will do what i did with abraham
[1:20:16] i will shut with him

[1:20:41] and you will open up the door i will
[1:20:44] come in
[1:20:46] and i will sup with you
[1:20:49] and you with me
[1:20:51] so this laodicea this age is offered the
[1:20:55] same visitation
[1:20:58] that abraham had
[1:21:04] amen i want you to get the stop now
[1:21:06] because this time he's coming to your
[1:21:09] tent
[1:21:11] he's passing by your tent he's coming to
[1:21:14] your door
[1:21:16] and you know if you can hear his voice
[1:21:20] my goodness there's every kind of noise
[1:21:22] out there today of every kind of voices
[1:21:25] that there is the voices of politics the
[1:21:27] voices of sin the voices of reason the
[1:21:30] voices of education the voices of men's
[1:21:33] ideas and
[1:21:35] religious views and everything but if
[1:21:37] you can hear my voice
[1:21:42] i'll come in
[1:21:43] and i'll sup with you
[1:21:45] and you with me
[1:21:47] remember i want to share this with you
[1:21:49] from the voice of the sign
[1:21:51] a sermon that he said his voice will
[1:21:53] speak one day a sign will come and what
[1:21:56] will it do the laodicean sign must be as
[1:21:59] it was then
[1:22:01] there will be a voice speak to us in the
[1:22:03] last day remember laodicea's sign jesus
[1:22:07] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:22:10] and when he was put out of the church
[1:22:12] there in laodicea we find his put out
[1:22:15] again on the outside
[1:22:18] and look the voice says if any man will
[1:22:20] cooperate
[1:22:22] if anybody will let me in i'll come in
[1:22:25] and we'll suck with them and they with
[1:22:26] me i'll come in and i'll be in them
[1:22:30] standing on the outside of the rank of
[1:22:33] the churches knocking trying to get in
[1:22:36] remember i told you that as brother
[1:22:38] branham preached the sermon the
[1:22:39] laodicean church age he emphasized there
[1:22:43] jesus with dirty feet
[1:22:45] the unwelcome christ the unentertained
[1:22:48] christ
[1:22:49] remember the meanest man in santa maria
[1:22:52] or the meanest man in town
[1:22:55] is is not the prostitute trying to get
[1:22:58] to christ
[1:22:59] it is the pharisee
[1:23:01] the religious one
[1:23:04] who's sitting there in the pew and
[1:23:06] refusing to wash his feet
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:15] so he said come in
[1:23:17] if any man will open the door just like
[1:23:19] those on the road to emmaus
[1:23:21] come in and abide with us let's break
[1:23:24] bread together
[1:23:25] they had this stranger walking with them
[1:23:27] after the resurrection it was christ
[1:23:30] revealed to them the bible said in
[1:23:32] another form
[1:23:35] amen he is here but he's in a different
[1:23:38] form
[1:23:39] you know you're looking for the man
[1:23:41] walking down the the aisle today as
[1:23:44] the man
[1:23:45] with nail scarves that's not where he's
[1:23:48] that's not the way he's appearing he's
[1:23:50] appearing in his people
[1:23:52] amen right here in this church right
[1:23:55] here among you right here coming to your
[1:23:57] tent knocking at your door
[1:24:04] now you can be the greatest sinner in
[1:24:05] the city
[1:24:07] you don't need not to be religious to do
[1:24:09] that
[1:24:10] and turn him down
[1:24:12] refuse to wash his feet
[1:24:14] refuse to entertain him refuse to feed
[1:24:16] him
[1:24:20] we're going to have some real serious
[1:24:21] things here
[1:24:23] sup he says reveal myself to them i'll
[1:24:26] reveal that i'm the same yesterday today
[1:24:28] and forever
[1:24:30] so you see the sup he is going to reveal
[1:24:33] some things to you he's going to show
[1:24:36] you i'm alive i'm the same yesterday
[1:24:38] today and forever i'm not a dead god i'm
[1:24:41] a living god and i can give you power
[1:24:44] over the flesh and over the works of the
[1:24:46] devil i'll give you strength in your
[1:24:48] time of uh where you where you're
[1:24:50] falling short and you're unable i'll
[1:24:53] come and i'll be the strength giver on
[1:24:55] the inside of you
[1:24:57] now so you see jesus when he was here
[1:25:01] when he was departing he asked for one
[1:25:03] thing from the father
[1:25:06] if you'll read this in john chapter 17
[1:25:09] he asked for one thing in his prayer to
[1:25:11] the father you know that but what that
[1:25:12] one thing was
[1:25:14] after he had given his sacrifice he had
[1:25:16] paid the price of redemption he had
[1:25:19] given his life he lived in the path he
[1:25:22] walked for
[1:25:23] you know he asked for one thing that
[1:25:26] where i am
[1:25:28] they may be awesome
[1:25:31] in other words he asks for your
[1:25:33] fellowship
[1:25:36] and this is what god is asking of every
[1:25:38] one of you today
[1:25:40] as a believer
[1:25:42] he is asking and designing one thing and
[1:25:45] that's fellowship
[1:25:48] remember this is a bride groom
[1:25:51] relationship
[1:25:52] a groom and a bride and as they as they
[1:25:56] are lovers together he's bringing her to
[1:25:59] himself and whispering the love secrets
[1:26:02] he's telling her about our future home
[1:26:06] he's telling about things that are to be
[1:26:09] he's telling about the rapture and how
[1:26:12] you're going to get to that home he's
[1:26:14] telling you about who is his melchizedek
[1:26:17] and your theophany
[1:26:18] all of these things he's whispering love
[1:26:21] secrets
[1:26:23] but you've got to be in love with him
[1:26:26] to be interested in what he's saying
[1:26:31] because he's not whispered this to his
[1:26:34] flirters
[1:26:35] you'll never get it just flirting around
[1:26:41] now
[1:26:43] so he asked in his prayer for your
[1:26:45] companionship forever
[1:26:50] then how much in return should we
[1:26:53] desire him
[1:26:57] like i tell like i told jeremiah the
[1:27:00] young man that came to the altar
[1:27:02] i said you know what did not come
[1:27:03] seeking god
[1:27:04] you might have thought you did but you
[1:27:06] weren't
[1:27:07] god was seeking you
[1:27:09] it was never adam in the garden after
[1:27:12] the sin saying god god where are you it
[1:27:14] was god saying adam adam where are you
[1:27:18] you see it is never man seeking god is
[1:27:22] god seeking you
[1:27:24] and dare to think about that the
[1:27:26] almighty god would seek you out
[1:27:31] that he wouldn't pass you by
[1:27:33] but he would come by your tent
[1:27:36] and knock at your door
[1:27:39] waiting for an invitation
[1:27:42] for you to invite him in
[1:27:46] and not just in
[1:27:49] but sup with him
[1:27:53] brother branham preached sermon's own
[1:27:55] door in the door and he said you get
[1:27:57] inside there's a lot more doors it's got
[1:27:59] to be open
[1:28:00] door of pride
[1:28:02] all kinds of doors
[1:28:04] you've got to let him in
[1:28:07] now so again
[1:28:09] paul would say in galatians 4 9 4 19 my
[1:28:13] children with whom i travail again at
[1:28:15] birth
[1:28:16] until christ is formed
[1:28:19] in you
[1:28:20] so look christ
[1:28:22] lives with us from the moment we're
[1:28:24] filled with the holy spirit but there's
[1:28:26] still there's got to be a growth within
[1:28:30] you see day by day we've got to give him
[1:28:32] the opportunity to grow and and to be
[1:28:35] formed in us
[1:28:37] and as we do christ will be able to
[1:28:39] express himself more
[1:28:41] more fully through our daily life
[1:28:44] brother branham would illustrate it like
[1:28:46] this he used this illustration he said
[1:28:48] like a button he said just like a little
[1:28:51] button when a man is saved that little
[1:28:54] much of him is god
[1:28:56] it's a like a little light that comes in
[1:28:58] you and you quit doing what is wrong
[1:29:01] now if you can take all the malice and
[1:29:03] envy and strife and unbelief how that
[1:29:06] little button like of light and the
[1:29:09] power of god will keep growing and
[1:29:11] growing and growing crowding out
[1:29:13] unbelief
[1:29:14] and you'll do it by sanctified
[1:29:18] by a sanctified consecrated life and not
[1:29:21] by exhortation of bodily exercise but
[1:29:24] the holy spirit moving through you
[1:29:27] so you see in every facet of life
[1:29:31] whether it's business
[1:29:32] whether it's study or whether it's war
[1:29:36] there is no safety but in advance
[1:29:41] amen to stand still is to go back
[1:29:44] to quit trying is to lose ground
[1:29:48] to slack in the pace before the finish
[1:29:50] line is to lose the race
[1:29:52] [Applause]
[1:29:54] but one sure sign
[1:29:57] and i want you to get this
[1:29:59] one sure sign of a christian a real true
[1:30:02] christian
[1:30:03] is a deep longing
[1:30:05] and a steady effort
[1:30:07] to know more of him
[1:30:15] i want you to think of it
[1:30:17] i told a young man
[1:30:19] who was
[1:30:20] he had found a girl that that he thought
[1:30:23] he liked and you know found that she was
[1:30:26] worldly and wasn't doing what was right
[1:30:28] and had was rebellious and so on and you
[1:30:31] know maybe found some undesirable things
[1:30:34] there and realized she needed the holy
[1:30:36] ghost she backed away
[1:30:39] now she's
[1:30:41] had an experience with god and he's gone
[1:30:43] again to seek
[1:30:45] and define maybe this might be someone
[1:30:48] i'd be interested in because has the
[1:30:50] holy ghost
[1:30:51] i said you know
[1:30:53] the baptist had
[1:30:55] their evidence
[1:30:56] of being filled with the holy ghost when
[1:30:59] i believed on the lord
[1:31:02] the pentecostals have their evidence of
[1:31:04] when they receive the holy ghost says i
[1:31:07] spoke in other tongues
[1:31:09] i said but you see we we of course must
[1:31:13] believe and we do believe in speaking in
[1:31:15] other tongues
[1:31:17] but what we're looking for is more than
[1:31:19] one thing
[1:31:21] and you young people when you're looking
[1:31:23] for us a mate
[1:31:25] you want to find
[1:31:26] the holy ghost and that person
[1:31:29] and you're looking for more than one
[1:31:31] thing well they shouted and they
[1:31:33] screamed down at the altar and they
[1:31:34] spoke in other tongues that's good well
[1:31:37] they believed on the lord and they
[1:31:39] believe the message and they they accept
[1:31:41] all the true doctrines that's good but
[1:31:44] you're looking not just for one or two
[1:31:46] things
[1:31:47] when we look at a tree and try to
[1:31:50] discern what it is we look at the bark
[1:31:53] it's got to have a certain kind of bark
[1:31:55] it's got to have a certain kind of
[1:31:57] leaves it's got to have a certain kind
[1:31:59] of fruit
[1:32:02] you can call it a peach tree all you
[1:32:03] want to but if it's got acres on it it's
[1:32:05] not a peach
[1:32:08] you see we are looking for more than one
[1:32:11] thing we're looking we're looking that's
[1:32:13] what you're looking for in your life
[1:32:15] you're looking for more than i came to
[1:32:17] the altar and i spoke in other tongues
[1:32:19] and i shouted or i screamed and i'll
[1:32:22] tell you i got i wept until the the
[1:32:25] altar was wet let me tell you i know
[1:32:28] from experience i can go back to my very
[1:32:30] early days
[1:32:32] in ministry in the old church where i'm
[1:32:34] talking about the old old church when i
[1:32:37] was about 18 19 years old and preaching
[1:32:40] there the young girl there came to the
[1:32:43] to there got into conviction came under
[1:32:46] the altar and went all over that altar
[1:32:49] up and down sorry for all of her sins
[1:32:52] only to go right back out
[1:32:56] into sin all over again
[1:32:59] never did come back to church never did
[1:33:01] go on with god
[1:33:04] you see repentance is a lot more
[1:33:07] than just saying i'm sorry
[1:33:10] repentance is turning from
[1:33:16] you can see a lot of crocodile tears
[1:33:19] sometimes even sincere tears a lot of
[1:33:22] them they're sincere because they got
[1:33:23] caught
[1:33:25] sincere because you know and they're
[1:33:26] crying and because of all the heartache
[1:33:29] and trouble that sin brings and sin
[1:33:32] brings heartache
[1:33:37] and people can cry over that
[1:33:40] and go right back into their sins
[1:33:42] what we want to see is change lives
[1:33:47] amen it's like brother branham said i
[1:33:49] don't care how much you jump i just what
[1:33:51] kind of life did you live after you
[1:33:53] jumped
[1:33:54] nothing wrong with the jumping
[1:33:56] nothing wrong with the shouting
[1:33:59] but go and live the right kind of life
[1:34:01] and that's because christ dwells in you
[1:34:05] now so you keep pressing on it's like he
[1:34:07] said in the messiah when a man is
[1:34:09] converted it's like a little white
[1:34:11] button starts in his heart and when he's
[1:34:14] born of the spirit of god that part is
[1:34:16] god
[1:34:17] that's god's spirit dwelling in him and
[1:34:18] if he can let it grow
[1:34:21] and take all the root out of the roots
[1:34:23] of bitterness
[1:34:25] and press god's way through him again
[1:34:28] he can come back in the same condition
[1:34:30] that he was in the garden of eden
[1:34:33] jesus said mark 11 24 verily verily i
[1:34:37] say unto you if you say to this mountain
[1:34:39] be moved and don't doubt your heart but
[1:34:40] believe what you said will come to pass
[1:34:42] you can have what you said that puts
[1:34:46] that puts him right back in supreme
[1:34:49] again it puts him right back in that
[1:34:52] condition
[1:34:54] so i'm just going to say i don't care
[1:34:56] how long you've been in the message i
[1:34:57] don't care how long you've been a
[1:34:58] christian there's still a place of
[1:35:01] growth in your life
[1:35:04] amen you should be
[1:35:06] leaving the things that are in the past
[1:35:09] and pressing toward the mark for the
[1:35:11] prize of the high calling
[1:35:14] never slacking back never a running back
[1:35:17] never a retreat
[1:35:19] as i preached sunday we've got to ascend
[1:35:22] ascension hill we've got to possess
[1:35:26] what others have failed to possess
[1:35:30] now ii corinthians 4 16 for which cause
[1:35:33] we faint not that though our outward man
[1:35:36] perish
[1:35:37] and you're going to get depressed
[1:35:40] worried
[1:35:41] fretful
[1:35:42] afraid
[1:35:44] sick
[1:35:45] weary of it all
[1:35:47] but the inward man
[1:35:50] is to have a renewing day by day
[1:35:56] so your inward man needs renewing
[1:35:59] that inward man is christ and he needs
[1:36:02] feeding and he's coming by
[1:36:05] and he's wanting to sup with you
[1:36:08] he's coming to abide in you
[1:36:12] and he must be entertained
[1:36:15] what am i trying to say you've got to
[1:36:17] entertain the christ that is in you
[1:36:23] now
[1:36:24] again you know many times people think
[1:36:27] glory that god you know i got so
[1:36:30] inoculated with the holy ghost there at
[1:36:32] the altar and i'll tell you the holy
[1:36:34] spirit moved all over me i danced i
[1:36:36] shouted i cried i spoke in heavenly
[1:36:39] languages i did all kinds of things
[1:36:42] i got the inoculation brother tim well
[1:36:44] you know brother branham believed in
[1:36:46] booster shots
[1:36:51] amen he believed in booster shot he said
[1:36:54] i'm so glad to be inoculated oh how the
[1:36:56] son of god took his own life and
[1:36:58] injected into my life injecting your
[1:37:00] life and he comes down and energizes
[1:37:03] with his presence you know when you get
[1:37:05] a serum every once in a while you get
[1:37:07] inoculated but you have to get a booster
[1:37:11] and what this city needs in the
[1:37:13] pentecostal church today is a booster
[1:37:15] hallelujah don't boost it on saying
[1:37:17] we'll make a few more organizations
[1:37:18] that'll ruin your prescription go right
[1:37:21] back and take a booster of the very same
[1:37:23] thing to come at the first place the
[1:37:25] same baptism by the same experience the
[1:37:28] same holy ghost amen glory to god
[1:37:31] forever and ever
[1:37:32] amen glory and power in the resurrection
[1:37:34] of christ he shouted and he said did the
[1:37:37] things that i do shall you do also
[1:37:39] because you're inoculated amen
[1:37:41] inoculated with resurrection power oh
[1:37:44] what a foretaste of glory divine amen i
[1:37:47] guess you think i'm noisy but it's just
[1:37:49] that way i guess you think you'd get
[1:37:52] noisy too inoculated branded so glad
[1:37:54] that i know where i belong
[1:37:57] in the house of god
[1:38:00] so not only do you need an inoculation
[1:38:04] you need your regular boosters
[1:38:10] and i'm asking you not as till biden
[1:38:14] of a vaccine that don't work
[1:38:17] but i'm talking about a vaccine that's a
[1:38:19] sin cure
[1:38:21] amen don't you realize you need a new
[1:38:23] booster of it today
[1:38:26] amen a fresh inoculation a fresh
[1:38:29] experience
[1:38:30] of freshness of the holy ghost in your
[1:38:32] life
[1:38:34] so you see it's like in the days of
[1:38:36] israel when he poured out the manna and
[1:38:38] he gave them food
[1:38:40] for for their weary bodies there it gave
[1:38:43] a manna bread from heaven that bread
[1:38:45] from heaven would actually tight christ
[1:38:49] and so think of it if it types christ
[1:38:51] that they would just gather enough as
[1:38:53] what was needed for the day
[1:38:56] right and if they
[1:38:58] let it just go over
[1:39:00] a day it would breed worms and stink
[1:39:05] is that right
[1:39:07] now god gives his children new bread
[1:39:10] every day his mercies are new every
[1:39:14] morning
[1:39:17] he gives you he wants you to have a word
[1:39:21] for the day
[1:39:23] every day
[1:39:24] so well i had a great experience last
[1:39:27] wednesday night oh no you should have
[1:39:30] had several more experiences since then
[1:39:35] because what you got wednesday night now
[1:39:38] has wiggletales and worms and stinks
[1:39:41] you've got to have a fresh experience
[1:39:44] today
[1:39:47] i know we don't like to hear that but
[1:39:49] it's the truth
[1:39:50] you look and see what happened to
[1:39:52] religion they just camped down at the
[1:39:54] same old thing and they are they looking
[1:39:56] here and said look luther gave us manna
[1:39:59] and what it is is wiggletails in it
[1:40:02] worms it stinks
[1:40:04] it don't save from sin it don't nourish
[1:40:07] the body
[1:40:10] amen well i'm presbyterian i'm baptist
[1:40:12] or you know i you know i'm pentecostal
[1:40:16] you know it's just a it's just old
[1:40:18] handmade loaf of bread and it's just
[1:40:20] this filthy and made up with the hands
[1:40:22] of man
[1:40:23] but when you can get the testimony fresh
[1:40:28] amen this morning in prayer the holy
[1:40:31] spirit baptized my soul freshly
[1:40:35] that's the kind of experience that
[1:40:37] children of god should have
[1:40:40] listen knowledge and nominational life
[1:40:43] where you have a wednesday experience
[1:40:45] and a sunday experience
[1:40:47] but every day is a walk with god
[1:40:52] now so you see it's it's angel's food
[1:40:55] fresh from heaven that's why christians
[1:40:58] should always read their bible
[1:41:04] amen for the holy spirit feeds on the
[1:41:06] word of god
[1:41:09] so if you're going to feed the inner man
[1:41:11] what are you going to feed him the word
[1:41:15] amen and so the food is the word of god
[1:41:18] i mean we're not going out here and
[1:41:20] killing the calf and dressing it okay
[1:41:22] make some unleavened bread sarah and
[1:41:24] come on we're gonna sit this down before
[1:41:26] you no we got to stand there
[1:41:29] watching the holy spirit within us be
[1:41:32] fed on the word of god
[1:41:34] [Applause]
[1:41:38] because christ lives on the word the
[1:41:40] holy spirit loves the word amen
[1:41:43] now
[1:41:45] brother branham would well i'm just
[1:41:46] going to use some of his for my examples
[1:41:49] because he was a godly man a righteous
[1:41:51] man a prophet of god
[1:41:54] and he says i really wish to read from
[1:41:56] the bible
[1:41:58] he said i just love reading the word
[1:42:00] the holy spirit feeds on the word
[1:42:03] jesus said it's written man shall not
[1:42:06] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:42:08] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:42:11] and if you just take it each day not
[1:42:14] just as a routine but oh i'd say to make
[1:42:17] it that your heart craves for it
[1:42:21] see the soul's desire
[1:42:23] to step down each day and read so much
[1:42:25] of it you'd be surprised what it would
[1:42:28] do to your spiritual growth
[1:42:32] what
[1:42:33] reading my bible yes
[1:42:37] oh i wish i had the time i've got it
[1:42:39] right here before me of what really
[1:42:41] being able to take the word of god
[1:42:43] personally for you
[1:42:45] because i want you to understand it's a
[1:42:47] love letter
[1:42:49] it might have been written to
[1:42:51] generations about generations before but
[1:42:54] it is a personal word directly to you if
[1:42:57] you'll take it in the right mental
[1:42:59] attitude
[1:43:00] that this is for me this is the word of
[1:43:03] god to me
[1:43:04] and you'll take it literally for
[1:43:06] yourself
[1:43:09] are you with me so you take it just
[1:43:11] every day you know it's it's sheep food
[1:43:13] you know again
[1:43:15] there's all kinds of examples cheap food
[1:43:18] eagle food all kinds of a dove food you
[1:43:22] know again because god would liken his
[1:43:25] people to eagles to lambs
[1:43:29] to doves
[1:43:31] and every one of them have an appetite
[1:43:35] and they only eat certain things
[1:43:38] a real a real eagle there he's called a
[1:43:41] ripper with the beef
[1:43:43] he wants fresh food
[1:43:46] i'm not talking about these vulture
[1:43:47] types i'm talking about because vultures
[1:43:50] and eagles are two different things when
[1:43:52] you're a real eagle you want something
[1:43:54] that's living
[1:43:56] that's why we are typed as eagles in the
[1:43:59] bible especially in this age in the
[1:44:01] eagle age
[1:44:03] we have to have the fresh kill meat of
[1:44:05] the word
[1:44:06] and when we do you see it's a it's alive
[1:44:09] the heart is beating in it and when when
[1:44:12] the eagle rips on that carcass there the
[1:44:15] blood flows and it gets all over him
[1:44:19] he's called a ripper with the beat
[1:44:21] that's what the literal name for eagle
[1:44:23] is and he rips his food
[1:44:26] he doesn't eat what is dead
[1:44:28] and what is going by
[1:44:30] and what do others vulturize on of an
[1:44:33] aged past he's got to have fresh food
[1:44:36] for today and it's got to be alive
[1:44:39] it's got to have some power in it it's
[1:44:42] got to have flowing blood in it
[1:44:46] it can't stink because it's been left
[1:44:48] over from another age
[1:44:51] but it's the word of the hour
[1:44:53] the same way with the duh but
[1:44:56] has no gall so therefore it what does it
[1:44:59] do it eats only pure things the corn and
[1:45:03] the weed and the seeds and things like
[1:45:05] that you know you will not catch it
[1:45:08] on a carcass of an animal
[1:45:12] amen you won't find it on dead and
[1:45:14] rotten things its diet is pure
[1:45:18] and you're a dove your your diet has got
[1:45:20] to be pure
[1:45:22] a man a lamb he's not a pig a pig would
[1:45:25] eat anything
[1:45:27] but you see a dog a lamb he eats sheep
[1:45:31] food
[1:45:32] we're going to talk about that here in a
[1:45:34] minute but right now you see we're to
[1:45:36] feed the flock of god you know not with
[1:45:38] man-made theology
[1:45:40] but you feed them on the word because
[1:45:42] that's where sheep grow from
[1:45:45] you see you feed them the word and of
[1:45:48] course he said feed me to peter feed my
[1:45:50] sheep and feed my lambs because lambs
[1:45:54] and sheep eat two different
[1:45:56] things one of them is the young of the
[1:45:59] sheep and it it it
[1:46:01] it eats uh the milk of the word
[1:46:04] there's a necessity to not just preach
[1:46:07] and then minister do it a lot of times
[1:46:09] just preach way over the head of people
[1:46:12] you know we're way overhead of the lambs
[1:46:14] but you know when you're preaching you
[1:46:16] got to throw out a little lamb food too
[1:46:20] sure preach the deep mysteries and the
[1:46:22] deep things of god but get it where the
[1:46:24] young people can get it to and
[1:46:26] understand and walk out of here with
[1:46:29] something in their heart that it changed
[1:46:31] them
[1:46:32] somebody with me now
[1:46:34] now so in the in the bible we find that
[1:46:37] jesus was the hidden manner
[1:46:40] christ is the church's manner and that
[1:46:43] man in the old testament was what come
[1:46:45] down from heaven fresh every night and
[1:46:48] the new testament the bible speaks of
[1:46:50] hidden man
[1:46:51] so what is a hidden manner jesus christ
[1:46:54] is a hidden manner here in a little
[1:46:56] while the world will see me no more but
[1:46:58] you're going to see me
[1:47:00] i'm going to appear to you for i will be
[1:47:03] with you and i will be in you to the end
[1:47:06] of the world
[1:47:07] is that right so it's hidden manna and
[1:47:09] that's where every day comes a new
[1:47:11] blessing something new coming down from
[1:47:14] god a hidden manna coming from god out
[1:47:17] of heaven
[1:47:18] christ revealing himself on a daily
[1:47:21] basis
[1:47:24] not a denominational life
[1:47:28] of easter and sunday
[1:47:30] or just a wednesday on sunday or just to
[1:47:33] sunday just sunday or just as some do
[1:47:36] one sunday
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:47] let me tell you something
[1:47:52] if you're finding yourself always
[1:47:54] missing church
[1:47:58] i would look for a spiritual problem
[1:48:02] well i i've been i've been sick a lot
[1:48:04] brother tim i i have this ache in pain
[1:48:07] ron spencer takes away every excuse
[1:48:11] you could ever have
[1:48:15] and where are you going to stand on a
[1:48:16] day like that
[1:48:20] i would check my appetite
[1:48:23] i would see why is it that my inner man
[1:48:26] is not requiring more have i dwarfed him
[1:48:29] has it become a
[1:48:32] is he is he somehow another you know
[1:48:34] where i really ain't putting the effort
[1:48:37] for us anymore
[1:48:39] i tell you what if you were if you're
[1:48:41] sick and i'm not talking about coming
[1:48:42] here with covered in flu and all kinds
[1:48:44] of junk like that were contagious but if
[1:48:46] you're if you've got a a chronic illness
[1:48:50] i'd come to the house of god and i'd
[1:48:52] come expect it
[1:48:54] that the healer is in the house
[1:48:57] and i was gonna leave out of here better
[1:48:59] than worse
[1:49:07] you see man shall live by every word
[1:49:09] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:49:11] so brother bradley would tell you how
[1:49:13] can you stay home and be just as good a
[1:49:15] christian as you could be at church he
[1:49:17] said you can't do it
[1:49:20] read the word the holy spirit feeds on
[1:49:22] the word the bible is god's spiritual
[1:49:25] diet to his church and the holy spirit
[1:49:27] is the one who brings it to you and
[1:49:29] places it in the heart and with
[1:49:31] thanksgiving you water it
[1:49:33] [Music]
[1:49:35] and every divine promise will produce
[1:49:37] exactly what god said it would do
[1:49:40] that's why i would like you to read the
[1:49:41] word
[1:49:42] that is personally to you
[1:49:49] now
[1:49:52] you see what the devil wants to do
[1:49:54] he wants to separate you
[1:49:58] like a burning coal is burning bright
[1:50:01] take it out in the midst of the flames
[1:50:05] and it dies
[1:50:09] like a deer
[1:50:11] there you know where
[1:50:14] you know that like a deer you know he
[1:50:16] get a little deer out by itself
[1:50:18] that's the one the wolves work on
[1:50:22] there's a lesson if he can catch the
[1:50:23] deer away from the herd
[1:50:25] that's what the devil wants to do
[1:50:28] so you young lady he wants you to go out
[1:50:31] with a boy that's not a christian
[1:50:34] young man he wants you to go out with
[1:50:36] some little painted up jezebel
[1:50:39] you know he's somebody that's not a
[1:50:41] christian that's where he wants to carry
[1:50:43] at you he wants to catch you
[1:50:46] set a trap for you
[1:50:48] and you and now i'm coming down and this
[1:50:51] is the prophet's word to you old man or
[1:50:53] woman
[1:50:55] maybe you won't identify with that
[1:50:57] but you old man or woman when you
[1:50:59] separate yourself believers people say i
[1:51:02] can stay at home and be just as good a
[1:51:04] christian as i can at church you can't
[1:51:08] the bible said forsake not our siblings
[1:51:11] ourselves together that much more as we
[1:51:13] see the time approaching so if you're a
[1:51:16] christian you long to want to go where
[1:51:18] other christians are and fellowship with
[1:51:20] other christians you can't stay away
[1:51:23] from church and live the same life
[1:51:28] you can't do it
[1:51:29] so well i'm hungry and you never go to
[1:51:31] the table
[1:51:32] you've got to go feed on the word of god
[1:51:35] and fellowship with one another
[1:51:37] but when you get yourself singled out
[1:51:41] and
[1:51:42] away from the rest
[1:51:45] making yourself a little different won't
[1:51:48] associate with them because
[1:51:51] they believe this or want to associate
[1:51:53] with diet you're on dangerous ground
[1:51:57] keeping away from church
[1:51:59] find one of your choice remain there be
[1:52:02] a christian brother at all that's the
[1:52:04] way to be a real christian then we got
[1:52:06] fellowship
[1:52:08] protection people love you and pray for
[1:52:10] you and he said that's the success of my
[1:52:12] people my meetings is because people
[1:52:15] pray
[1:52:16] amen all that we get to have more
[1:52:18] success than even the night tabernacle
[1:52:21] because of people praying
[1:52:24] people calling on claude lord we need
[1:52:27] you to move
[1:52:29] we need to speak out of heaven today we
[1:52:32] need you to reveal yourself you see the
[1:52:34] holy spirit of the is the holy ghost in
[1:52:37] you it feeds on the word of god
[1:52:41] you see it actually takes control of
[1:52:44] your body and it brings your your body
[1:52:47] to church
[1:52:50] so that it can be fed on the word of god
[1:52:52] it craves the word
[1:52:55] and that the holy spirit is in you it
[1:52:57] feeds on the word it doesn't feed on
[1:52:59] television
[1:53:01] it doesn't feed on true story magazines
[1:53:04] and love books and you know the people
[1:53:07] calling yourself christians you wrap
[1:53:08] yourself up in
[1:53:10] you see
[1:53:11] though those things are
[1:53:13] influences i preached a sermon many
[1:53:16] years ago
[1:53:17] on the the influence from hell and i
[1:53:20] showed them out of hollywood where where
[1:53:22] the wave of sin was coming
[1:53:25] brother branham would call it in 1954
[1:53:28] the invasion of the united states
[1:53:31] and he said it would start in hollywood
[1:53:33] and it was spread out to the nation
[1:53:35] and you look now where that people are
[1:53:37] of one mind
[1:53:39] you wonder how in one generation that
[1:53:42] you can change the mind of the masses
[1:53:45] where it's acceptable now for same-sex
[1:53:47] marriage
[1:53:49] where you can change the minds of people
[1:53:52] to think that young people young
[1:53:54] children can change from a boy to girl
[1:53:57] or girl to boy
[1:53:59] you wonder how it can be done it's been
[1:54:01] done with mass media from the vision of
[1:54:05] hell
[1:54:08] amen but god's in a vision in this day
[1:54:12] amen it's not a television it's a
[1:54:15] prophet who told discipline
[1:54:18] and that vision there was to transform
[1:54:21] you by the renewing of your mind
[1:54:25] to become a word bride a word people
[1:54:33] now
[1:54:34] so what are you feeding on
[1:54:36] you see
[1:54:37] a lot of things
[1:54:39] about jesus said we're looking for the
[1:54:41] whole man what are your desires
[1:54:44] what was your desires what was what was
[1:54:47] you before christ came in what what are
[1:54:50] you now
[1:54:52] what was your desires then what are your
[1:54:53] desires now
[1:54:57] you see this is what we're looking for
[1:54:59] we're looking for a nature
[1:55:03] well change
[1:55:03] shouted and run out i'm looking for
[1:55:05] nature change
[1:55:08] that's what god's looking for
[1:55:11] so you look
[1:55:12] at the magazines that you're reading
[1:55:15] and listen to what's
[1:55:19] brother bratton would use these terms
[1:55:21] himself in magazines and radio
[1:55:24] and ah you know
[1:55:26] of rock and roll and boogie woogie the
[1:55:28] music you listen to
[1:55:31] he said i can tell what kind of spirit
[1:55:32] you got
[1:55:36] anymore it is in magazines and
[1:55:38] newspapers are almost absolutely
[1:55:41] absolute
[1:55:42] obsolete i'll get it right in three
[1:55:44] times
[1:55:46] but it's it's about you know there you
[1:55:49] just about don't see a newspaper anymore
[1:55:51] don't read one it's it's all there on
[1:55:54] your phone or on your tablet or on your
[1:55:56] computer or whatever else
[1:56:00] but i wouldn't just say what are you
[1:56:01] feeding on
[1:56:06] you know you get some feeding on the
[1:56:07] news too much
[1:56:09] and you know what you'll do you'll get
[1:56:11] so so up angry of everything that is
[1:56:14] going on things that you can't even fix
[1:56:18] and that you really shouldn't worry
[1:56:20] about fixing because what we should be
[1:56:23] doing is preparing to leave here not
[1:56:26] preparing to stay here
[1:56:31] you see what are you feeding on what
[1:56:34] kind of music are you listening to
[1:56:37] you see what kind of what kind of music
[1:56:40] you see spirits travel on words
[1:56:44] those words will come in songs those
[1:56:47] words will come in things that you read
[1:56:49] it comes in the eye gate and it pollutes
[1:56:51] the soul
[1:56:53] and i'll tell you if you have the holy
[1:56:55] spirit in it'll grieve the holy spirit
[1:57:00] now
[1:57:01] let me just tell you i preached the
[1:57:03] sermon again many years ago i guess i'm
[1:57:05] going back in the memory something today
[1:57:07] but preached a sermon on divine in your
[1:57:09] energy
[1:57:11] and i talked about it when you pick up a
[1:57:13] book and you read a book
[1:57:15] there
[1:57:16] the words that you pick up from there
[1:57:19] energizes your spirit
[1:57:22] and when you when you read a book and
[1:57:24] energy is transferred to you
[1:57:28] it's something that your spirit feeds
[1:57:31] upon
[1:57:32] an electrician will study a book to
[1:57:35] become an electrician
[1:57:37] the books the doctors and nurses digest
[1:57:40] help them become doctors and nurses
[1:57:43] books on psychology transforms a regular
[1:57:47] person into
[1:57:49] a psychologist
[1:57:51] so even books on sex and violence
[1:57:55] positions the mind toward immorality
[1:57:59] [Applause]
[1:58:01] and what you're seeing you see
[1:58:04] is in television is books on steroids
[1:58:08] now i don't really need to preach about
[1:58:10] television so most of you don't have one
[1:58:12] you got rid of that years ago but you
[1:58:14] got youtube in this place
[1:58:19] and every kind of thing right there
[1:58:23] now if books do this
[1:58:26] one and can transform
[1:58:29] can transform a man a regular man into a
[1:58:32] doctor through his studies
[1:58:37] what can the bible do
[1:58:41] [Applause]
[1:58:43] it's divine energy
[1:58:46] it didn't come from the s-u-n it came
[1:58:48] from the s-o-n because all life comes
[1:58:51] from that sun
[1:58:53] and that energy can be transferred from
[1:58:55] you to you from the very words of god
[1:59:00] jesus said my word is spirit and my word
[1:59:03] is life
[1:59:06] so his words are spirit
[1:59:09] and when you read them they become
[1:59:12] spirit
[1:59:13] and when they become spirit is the
[1:59:15] quickening power
[1:59:18] to energize you to righteousness
[1:59:21] so if books do this
[1:59:23] what about video games
[1:59:28] that are turning youth into killing
[1:59:29] machines
[1:59:32] and i i i know the the video industry is
[1:59:35] in denial but other studies show that
[1:59:37] violent
[1:59:38] media concludes that violent video game
[1:59:41] exposure was linked to
[1:59:43] increased aggressive behaviors thoughts
[1:59:46] and emotions
[1:59:49] but it's a waste of a life
[1:59:54] i know i know young men that are there
[1:59:57] and men that have wasted their career
[2:00:00] because of addiction
[2:00:02] to video games
[2:00:04] i know of young people that have wasted
[2:00:07] their studies at a college because of an
[2:00:10] addiction to video games i know i know
[2:00:14] of marriage troubles
[2:00:16] that have come because of people being
[2:00:19] addicted
[2:00:23] to video games
[2:00:25] and when you get that addiction
[2:00:28] there it has got a purpose to transform
[2:00:31] you into something as a child of wrath
[2:00:34] rather than a son of god
[2:00:38] it is satan's design for this evil age
[2:00:42] to get into your mind
[2:00:46] to and therefore transform you into
[2:00:50] an angel of death instead of an angel of
[2:00:53] light
[2:00:55] studies show that children become numb
[2:00:57] to violence
[2:00:59] they imitate violence they show
[2:01:01] aggressive behavior they have emotional
[2:01:04] behavior and learning problems that can
[2:01:06] be influenced by these violent images
[2:01:10] sad to say there's too many of our young
[2:01:13] people
[2:01:14] that are watching those things
[2:01:19] the holy spirit doesn't feed on that
[2:01:26] you see the great man abraham lincoln
[2:01:29] has said he had two books and they
[2:01:31] influenced his life at an early age and
[2:01:34] one of them was the bible the other was
[2:01:36] pilgrim's progress
[2:01:38] and it molded a character
[2:01:41] so this is why we can say just let me go
[2:01:43] to your house see what kind of pictures
[2:01:45] you got on the wall
[2:01:47] go to your home your office what kind of
[2:01:49] music is playing
[2:01:52] look at what you read and you can tell
[2:01:54] pretty much about your inward man
[2:01:58] amen and because of that you see homes
[2:02:02] are not what they should be families are
[2:02:04] not what they should be a family altar
[2:02:07] is not it's not there where that family
[2:02:09] is called to prayer
[2:02:12] the bible should be read
[2:02:16] come on i'm talking about healthy
[2:02:18] families
[2:02:19] and i'll tell you young men if you start
[2:02:22] now and this becomes a pattern for your
[2:02:24] life that you set with your family
[2:02:26] you'll find a you'll have a godly family
[2:02:30] so today it ain't wait till i get
[2:02:32] married to start it it's right now you
[2:02:35] start your walk with god and begin to
[2:02:37] build a relationship with christ
[2:02:41] you see movies and music do the same
[2:02:43] thing as the violence
[2:02:46] rap music will make young people
[2:02:48] will make them move towards sex and
[2:02:50] violence and evil
[2:02:52] rock and roll has moved a whole
[2:02:54] generation toward rebellions
[2:02:57] because spirits move on songs
[2:03:01] and words the lyrics of those songs
[2:03:04] you see again you
[2:03:07] you can you can see what it has done it
[2:03:09] is shaped and molded to society until
[2:03:12] america is no longer a christian nation
[2:03:17] but she now takes on the very nature of
[2:03:19] the beast
[2:03:21] and it's because of what she has spread
[2:03:23] upon
[2:03:25] rap music will move children young
[2:03:28] people or anybody toward evil for lord
[2:03:31] for you say brother tim i i young man
[2:03:35] said to me brother tim i just love
[2:03:37] country music because it tells you about
[2:03:40] life the way it really is i said not my
[2:03:42] life
[2:03:45] not my life
[2:03:47] i meant tears in the beer and you know
[2:03:50] and and the wife has left me and the
[2:03:52] children you know we're left alone and
[2:03:55] you know we're
[2:03:56] you know all of the sorrows of life with
[2:03:58] country music
[2:04:00] remember i'd like to do is take that
[2:04:02] country music and play it backwards one
[2:04:04] time
[2:04:06] the man quits drinking
[2:04:08] starts working has a home
[2:04:10] has a marriage
[2:04:13] goes to church come on we keep playing
[2:04:15] that old country music backward we'll
[2:04:18] have some real christians
[2:04:21] same thing with your rock and roll and
[2:04:23] your rap you can turn it around and say
[2:04:26] i've got some different kinds of life
[2:04:29] the life that i now live is not after
[2:04:32] the flesh but if after christ the son of
[2:04:35] god he lives in me but look what has
[2:04:38] happened hollywood has pushed the gay
[2:04:40] agenda until it's now so common it's
[2:04:44] taught in our school it's forced upon
[2:04:46] little children that a boy can become a
[2:04:48] girl or a girl can become
[2:04:51] be a boy
[2:04:52] and it's because of the immorality that
[2:04:55] the world has fed upon until the whole
[2:04:58] thing is sodom and gomorrah
[2:05:03] look at the difference
[2:05:04] between how abraham treated the angel of
[2:05:08] god and sodom treated it
[2:05:13] the bible wanted to tell you it said
[2:05:15] that the sodomite said let us have those
[2:05:18] men that come to you
[2:05:20] that we will know them in other words
[2:05:23] that we can have sexual relation with
[2:05:25] them
[2:05:27] you see they had become so evil they
[2:05:29] would pervert angels
[2:05:31] we are here in a day and hour where
[2:05:33] satan and sin is so evil
[2:05:37] that it pervert pervert the very word of
[2:05:40] god
[2:05:41] i listened to a song the other day
[2:05:44] you know they don't know they don't know
[2:05:46] that jesus i know let me tell you the
[2:05:48] jesus that is being preached in the
[2:05:50] world today is a jesus that is a gucci
[2:05:53] washy wishy wishy washy jesus they don't
[2:05:56] care how you live he just loves
[2:05:58] everybody and he loves you in your sins
[2:06:01] and wants you just to come as you are
[2:06:04] and just stay that way that ain't the
[2:06:06] jesus of the bible
[2:06:09] amen that jesus in the bible planted a
[2:06:11] whip and drove them out of the temple
[2:06:13] and mount zara and he delivered the
[2:06:16] people
[2:06:16] [Applause]
[2:06:18] i mean you don't come to christ and
[2:06:20] remain in your sins you've got to be
[2:06:21] chains in his presence
[2:06:24] but you see god made two different
[2:06:26] covenants he made a covenant with two
[2:06:29] different plans he weighed one for the
[2:06:30] man he made one for the woman they're
[2:06:32] two different all together
[2:06:34] this is why the bible teaches a man
[2:06:37] should have short hair a woman in other
[2:06:39] words cut hair and and a woman should
[2:06:42] have uncut hair because they're under
[2:06:45] two different covenants this is why the
[2:06:46] bible is clear it's an abomination to
[2:06:48] god for a woman to put on a garment that
[2:06:51] pertains to a man he's not even seen not
[2:06:54] to even look like a man it also says
[2:06:56] that a man's not to put on a woman's
[2:06:57] garment
[2:07:00] amen they're all together different
[2:07:02] women and men were trying to women try
[2:07:04] to be like man and man becomes so
[2:07:06] specified he's like a woman
[2:07:09] amen even in the generations past uh
[2:07:12] brother branham spoke he said i saw a
[2:07:14] boy
[2:07:15] in cincinnati he looked like miss
[2:07:16] kennedy the hair was was out way like
[2:07:19] that he said god wants a man to look
[2:07:21] like a man and he wants a woman to look
[2:07:24] like a woman but he said the reason that
[2:07:26] they're doing it and this he said the
[2:07:29] jezebel system of the devil has got the
[2:07:32] whole world in corruption not a sound
[2:07:34] place at all it's all putrified swords
[2:07:36] swords of cancer malignancy of the devil
[2:07:39] that's eating the very core out of the
[2:07:41] systems that they got set up there satan
[2:07:43] is a vulture feeding upon his own
[2:07:46] kingdom he is the devil
[2:07:48] he is impure he is the father of a lie
[2:07:52] and he feeds on the flesh of his own
[2:07:54] people
[2:07:59] and it's something today when we see the
[2:08:02] struggle
[2:08:03] and young people pick up ever not just
[2:08:05] young people but a lot of others pick up
[2:08:08] every fad that comes along
[2:08:11] every fad that comes along
[2:08:13] that's why even in his generation the
[2:08:16] prophet of god would scream out against
[2:08:18] the duck tale the hairdos on the guys
[2:08:21] with the collars turned up because of
[2:08:23] the spirit that was going through the
[2:08:25] country writing on elvis's music
[2:08:30] when it was affired and identified with
[2:08:32] rock and roll i preached against goatees
[2:08:34] why because it's an identification of
[2:08:37] that music rock and roll
[2:08:40] you see you don't think brother branham
[2:08:42] recognized that yes he did he
[2:08:45] he stood right there and he preached
[2:08:47] about elvis lookalikes
[2:08:50] he preached about identifying yourself
[2:08:53] with the world and the facts that are
[2:08:55] going along is somebody with me
[2:08:57] amen you see where they they get where
[2:09:00] men will get so wound up in the cage of
[2:09:03] sin so they can't get out
[2:09:06] and yet they're hunting for something
[2:09:08] but the soul desire
[2:09:10] should desire god more than anything
[2:09:15] amen i'll just read this some
[2:09:16] identification brother adam went to the
[2:09:18] whole sermon of identified with christ i
[2:09:21] know today this is
[2:09:23] modern man even modern message people
[2:09:26] don't want to hear this kind of message
[2:09:28] but in identified with christ you see if
[2:09:30] we take men men you catch them on the
[2:09:32] street or in their business the old man
[2:09:34] wants to be a teenager he'll cut his
[2:09:36] hair off on the flat top and make a duck
[2:09:38] tail in the back he wants to be a
[2:09:39] teenager the teenager wants to be like
[2:09:41] one of these rock and roll kings where
[2:09:43] they wind up in sin and disgrace
[2:09:47] man seems to be unsatisfied he's running
[2:09:50] everywhere they'll listen to radio for
[2:09:52] jokes and things these jokesters pull
[2:09:54] they'll go out and try to mimic or act
[2:09:56] like those people take a little boy i
[2:09:58] know it he's like he's got to be polite
[2:10:01] nor hop along cassidy or the commercial
[2:10:03] world gets a hold of it makes millions
[2:10:05] of dollars out of it he goes on talks
[2:10:08] about it he said you know they take that
[2:10:10] as a standard of life as an example and
[2:10:13] little fellas run out become gangsters
[2:10:15] and robbers women turn to be prostitutes
[2:10:18] and street walkers and delinquent people
[2:10:21] men turn out to be gamblers and lovers
[2:10:23] of pleasure more than lovers of god
[2:10:25] churches try to impersonate the other
[2:10:27] church the big church and what would
[2:10:30] just seem there's no satisfaction among
[2:10:33] people what makes them
[2:10:35] it's it's for a cause it's a nature god
[2:10:37] gives them a nature and they got a
[2:10:39] nature that makes them want to have
[2:10:42] something to identify themselves with
[2:10:45] they must have something they want to be
[2:10:47] like an objective in life they want to
[2:10:49] be a movie star a cowboy or something on
[2:10:52] that idea it's here on the radio coming
[2:10:55] home this little humorous here when when
[2:10:58] some great italian man at denver was
[2:11:00] trying to play a hop along cassidy with
[2:11:03] something with a loaded gun instead of
[2:11:05] that he's going to be a chester the rest
[2:11:06] of his life he shot his kneecap off
[2:11:10] there you are they're trying to
[2:11:11] something find something to identify
[2:11:14] themselves with and the reason they're
[2:11:16] doing is because there's something in
[2:11:18] them that god made of that but god made
[2:11:22] them an example to be identified with
[2:11:25] that and that was when he made jesus
[2:11:28] christ become your savior that's the
[2:11:31] example that's what people should want
[2:11:33] is to be identified with jesus
[2:11:36] to be like him
[2:11:40] amen you see you are to be a new
[2:11:42] creature
[2:11:43] in christ ii corinthians 5 17 therefore
[2:11:48] if any man be in christ
[2:11:50] he is a new creature
[2:11:52] all things are passed away behold all
[2:11:56] things become new
[2:11:58] you see people call themselves holy
[2:12:00] ghost field and you can see there's a
[2:12:02] buzzard living on the inside of them
[2:12:05] because it's still eating on the on the
[2:12:07] violence of the world
[2:12:09] the world still has an attraction to
[2:12:12] them
[2:12:13] you see you need the holy ghost in there
[2:12:15] and when the holy ghost comes in there
[2:12:18] then that soul desire has changed and
[2:12:21] you got an appetite for the things of
[2:12:23] god
[2:12:24] amen hallelujah you see
[2:12:28] you see
[2:12:29] again you you will realize you cannot
[2:12:32] love the world or the things of the
[2:12:34] world let me just go to this brother
[2:12:36] branham we'll talk about this in the
[2:12:37] message first preach a whole sermon on
[2:12:40] thirst which is so desire
[2:12:42] he said you neglect to read the bible
[2:12:44] believe the bible and the holy spirit to
[2:12:47] feed him on that you will die
[2:12:52] jesus said in john 4 3
[2:12:54] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:12:56] every word not just part of it
[2:12:59] we take a little here little there he
[2:13:01] said i call that a bible hitchhiker
[2:13:03] hacker in other words somebody get on
[2:13:05] here but to get off there
[2:13:07] they believe this but won't believe that
[2:13:10] amen you got to take it all word by word
[2:13:12] man shall live by every word
[2:13:15] again if you neglect to feed the holy
[2:13:18] spirit the word of god jesus said every
[2:13:20] word shall be by the holy spirit and
[2:13:23] listen now if you try to feed it the
[2:13:25] wrong thing
[2:13:27] if it's a genie one holy spirit in you
[2:13:29] it'll know the difference and remember
[2:13:32] the word of god is what the holy spirit
[2:13:34] feeds on
[2:13:35] it don't feed on enthusiasm
[2:13:38] it don't feed on education it don't feed
[2:13:40] on church going it doesn't feed on
[2:13:42] theology there's a lot of difference
[2:13:44] between an inspired something or a
[2:13:46] theological standpoint and that's what
[2:13:49] we're trying to say friend we've
[2:13:50] transformed the message so many times in
[2:13:53] just a theological
[2:13:55] intellectual
[2:13:57] thinking
[2:13:59] without inspiration
[2:14:01] without the anointing
[2:14:05] amen until it's just a theology
[2:14:08] that's not the way the word is to come
[2:14:10] the word is to be spirit and light
[2:14:14] it is to be inspired anointed and with
[2:14:17] quicken and power to change a life
[2:14:21] amen oh my
[2:14:23] but you know we've had men like in the
[2:14:25] days of elisha so many of them that you
[2:14:28] know when eliza went to the school of
[2:14:30] the prophets and they want to entertain
[2:14:31] the prophet there was a lot of them that
[2:14:34] come in there and it's kind of gathering
[2:14:35] up some food and one went out together
[2:14:37] got a lot full of wild gourds thinking
[2:14:40] it was something good and it was poison
[2:14:42] there was death in the pot
[2:14:44] there's been a lot of things that has
[2:14:46] gone on in the message
[2:14:48] that has brought some death in the pot
[2:14:51] am i contaminated with one idea another
[2:14:53] idea one of the one of the biggest
[2:14:55] contamination is a baptist idea i'll
[2:14:58] just believe the message and you got the
[2:14:59] holy ghost that is a wild gourd
[2:15:02] it's death in the pond it'll kill our
[2:15:04] young people
[2:15:06] amen we've got to have the power of god
[2:15:09] amen now jesus when he was here they
[2:15:12] tried to feed him something one day he
[2:15:13] said well i've got some meat that you
[2:15:15] don't know
[2:15:16] know about
[2:15:17] they said well did somebody feed you you
[2:15:19] know somebody brought him something to
[2:15:21] eat he said my will my meat what gives
[2:15:24] me strength what my diet is is to do the
[2:15:27] will of the father of him that sent me
[2:15:30] and to finish his work
[2:15:33] if there ever was a thing we should be
[2:15:35] doing in this hour we should be
[2:15:37] consecrated on one day finishing the
[2:15:39] work
[2:15:41] we are the finishers
[2:15:43] we're the last writers in the race
[2:15:46] we've got to put everything we've got
[2:15:48] into it and our strength will come by
[2:15:50] doing the will of the father and the
[2:15:53] will of the father is the word of the
[2:15:55] father
[2:15:57] amen it should be our zeal it should be
[2:15:59] our burden
[2:16:01] amen
[2:16:02] why your capacity for the words that
[2:16:04] have no limits
[2:16:09] for those needing adoption one thing
[2:16:11] brother branham said about them he said
[2:16:13] they fill up real quick they're like a
[2:16:14] little bottle
[2:16:15] they've got a little bitty capacity for
[2:16:17] the word of god
[2:16:19] so they want a 15 20 minute sermon

[2:16:53] things that have changed and transform a
[2:16:56] life something that they give you an
[2:16:58] absolute that when the storms are coming
[2:17:00] you know that you know that you know who
[2:17:03] you are and where god has placed you in
[2:17:05] this house

[2:18:20] more of this so i can finish up
[2:18:23] you know how it is sometimes you know
[2:18:25] you got a plate full but you just need
[2:18:27] something of that other little dish
[2:18:29] there to bring it back and kind of you
[2:18:32] know to finish that gotta finish the
[2:18:33] meal but you want everything there got a
[2:18:36] certain taste certain flavors are trying
[2:18:38] that's what brother brandon said i like
[2:18:40] to mince and eat and mince and eat you
[2:18:43] know just take of it sit at the table
[2:18:46] and he said you know i like to stay a
[2:18:49] long time
[2:18:51] he said i i saw brother neville the
[2:18:53] other day preached about 45 minutes and
[2:18:55] saw him look at the clock and said yeah
[2:18:57] brother neville you're getting it also
[2:18:59] 45 minutes that's not long enough to get
[2:19:01] started he's just getting interested i'm
[2:19:03] just getting stirred up to a place i was
[2:19:05] feeling pretty good and he cut it off
[2:19:07] what a shame
[2:19:10] amen not but you see the holy spirit
[2:19:13] it takes the word of god to feed the
[2:19:16] hungry soul
[2:19:18] and eating accompanies fellowship
[2:19:22] so the holy spirit likes to eat and
[2:19:24] fellowship with the believer
[2:19:28] amen so we're all gathered around the
[2:19:30] great table
[2:19:31] and i want you to know god has provided
[2:19:34] so much for this age
[2:19:36] amen you've got an abundance to eat
[2:19:39] you don't just have luther's
[2:19:41] justification or wesley sanctification
[2:19:43] or acts 2 4 of azusa street you've got
[2:19:46] the whole menu
[2:19:48] the seven course menu the seven seals
[2:19:50] are open the mysteries are revealed the
[2:19:53] the seals are taken off the book and the
[2:19:55] entire word of god is available to you
[2:20:00] can you imagine you don't ever have to
[2:20:02] run out of anything to preach
[2:20:05] amen there's always a bunch more i know
[2:20:08] you thought i would have been just even
[2:20:10] a month ago been through with this on
[2:20:12] abraham and here here i am right here
[2:20:14] why it don't run out
[2:20:17] it man it doesn't run out there's always
[2:20:19] more
[2:20:21] they've been god revealing of the
[2:20:23] bounties of his blessing that seven
[2:20:25] courts menu
[2:20:27] now
[2:20:28] as we're thinking about this
[2:20:31] sometimes you wonder
[2:20:32] and i want you young people to think of
[2:20:34] this
[2:20:35] because you want to ask sometimes
[2:20:37] how
[2:20:38] can a christian
[2:20:40] get deeper in the love of god
[2:20:44] how
[2:20:45] what can i do brother tim
[2:20:48] here's the answer
[2:20:50] read the word
[2:20:52] and pray
[2:20:56] what that simple
[2:20:59] that hard
[2:21:03] amen
[2:21:07] read the word
[2:21:09] and pray
[2:21:12] you see in our day in our age
[2:21:16] satan's got your time taken up
[2:21:23] he's got your mind filled with every
[2:21:26] kind of thing
[2:21:30] and so as i said it's easy it's very
[2:21:34] simple read the word and pray this is a
[2:21:36] question ask brother brown how can i get
[2:21:39] deep in love with god read the word and
[2:21:40] pray
[2:21:41] he says it twice for emphasis
[2:21:45] just that simple
[2:21:46] but that hard
[2:21:50] because you're going to have to will to
[2:21:52] do the will of god
[2:21:57] now he says how many reads the word
[2:21:59] daily and i'm not going to ask for your
[2:22:01] hands because too many christians have
[2:22:03] never even read their bible
[2:22:10] just start in right in and make a habit
[2:22:12] of reading a chapter every night and
[2:22:13] before you go to bed in a chapter every
[2:22:15] morning just as you get up it don't take
[2:22:17] no time until you know the holy spirit
[2:22:20] feeds on the word of god is good for you
[2:22:22] to read
[2:22:24] and then he said people just simply read
[2:22:26] it join church and let it go at that
[2:22:28] they don't sit down and read the holy
[2:22:30] spirit feeds on the word of god jesus
[2:22:32] said man shall not live by bread alone
[2:22:34] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[2:22:36] the mouth of god so when you get saved
[2:22:39] the best thing to do
[2:22:42] is sit down with your bible
[2:22:44] and constantly read it
[2:22:49] that builds you
[2:22:51] you see what god did it's not like
[2:22:54] reading some novel
[2:22:55] you're reading so you can hang your soul
[2:22:59] on every punctuation of it
[2:23:02] because it's the word of god
[2:23:04] and every time god says anything you
[2:23:06] know how i punched him that weighed it
[2:23:08] with an amen that's right that's right
[2:23:10] so how that's how we should punctuate
[2:23:13] all of god's word with the name man when
[2:23:15] god says thou shalt and thou shalt not
[2:23:18] and so forth you say man not say well i
[2:23:21] would this way ought to be this way but
[2:23:24] just say amen to it
[2:23:28] and water it with praise
[2:23:30] and when the word is preached from the
[2:23:32] pulpit do like rebecca did she watered
[2:23:35] the camels
[2:23:37] the camels represented the power the
[2:23:40] beast represented the power
[2:23:43] and then she watered with praise the
[2:23:45] camels that was going to take her to her
[2:23:47] bridegroom
[2:23:48] so when you're in the house of god what
[2:23:50] are you to do you're going to say amen
[2:23:52] to the word you're to rejoice in truth
[2:23:56] amen you you got to water it
[2:24:00] with thanksgiving as the holy spirit
[2:24:02] goes out breaks across the crowd and
[2:24:05] there is it moves there you move with it
[2:24:07] and you water it
[2:24:12] there's a lot we can say on that but i'm
[2:24:14] running out of time and there's some
[2:24:15] things that i still want to get to
[2:24:19] and i say in our service today
[2:24:22] remember
[2:24:23] a lot of this i'm doing because as a
[2:24:25] shepherd i am to watch for your souls
[2:24:29] because i must give an account
[2:24:32] and i must give an account to preach to
[2:24:33] you the whole counsel of god
[2:24:37] so we don't want to just feed you an
[2:24:38] educational program and you know i teach
[2:24:41] you the dudes and the don'ts you know we
[2:24:44] we want to we want to have the the
[2:24:46] preaching of the gospel of the power the
[2:24:48] resurrection of jesus christ
[2:24:51] so as we're looking at this
[2:24:53] as we're talking about this we want to
[2:24:56] just realize that even in our service
[2:25:00] you know realize what you're feeding on
[2:25:02] realize it's the word of god
[2:25:05] and then you're to water it
[2:25:06] you respond to it
[2:25:08] you are to give your attention to it
[2:25:11] you are to have the hallelujahs and the
[2:25:14] amens and raising your hands and and
[2:25:16] clapping your hands and worshiping
[2:25:18] you're not applausing a man
[2:25:20] you're applausing the word of god you're
[2:25:22] saying it's right
[2:25:25] hey man i don't want your applause i
[2:25:27] want you to plunge him
[2:25:29] and his word
[2:25:31] you know you're feeding on the world
[2:25:33] it's not some dead carrying that come
[2:25:35] from ages passes right here is the fresh
[2:25:38] matter of the word of god
[2:25:40] amen what what do you think though
[2:25:43] brother brad i'm talking about mossback
[2:25:44] christians
[2:25:47] because christians
[2:25:49] get so long in the
[2:25:50] waters they turn green
[2:25:57] they sit so still
[2:25:59] so there
[2:26:00] so long
[2:26:03] until they're really
[2:26:05] not in it really anymore
[2:26:07] they're just growing moss
[2:26:09] i don't see you getting moss on your
[2:26:11] backs
[2:26:13] i want to see it alive in your life
[2:26:16] the holy spirit moving within you i want
[2:26:19] to see it pour out his spirit on all
[2:26:22] flesh
[2:26:24] come on somebody i'm a woman well upon
[2:26:26] my sons and on my daughters
[2:26:28] i'll pour out my spirit
[2:26:30] amen i want to see where our thoughts
[2:26:32] are on until their spiritual dreams
[2:26:34] again until military young men see
[2:26:37] visions
[2:26:38] old men drink dreams about whether god
[2:26:41] is speaking in his word and the flowing
[2:26:44] of the holy spirit through the church
[2:26:47] the gifts of the spirit working in in
[2:26:49] the body
[2:26:51] but i wonder how many christians are
[2:26:54] living a denominational life
[2:26:57] they just come to church regularly but
[2:26:59] through the week they're filling up on
[2:27:01] movies
[2:27:02] video games
[2:27:04] facebook junk
[2:27:06] youtuber makes it available where you
[2:27:08] can gum your soul up with every kind of
[2:27:10] nonsense
[2:27:12] i went to adopters i went to a doctor's
[2:27:14] office this past week and two employees
[2:27:17] were were talking about how tired they
[2:27:19] were they'd stayed up late watching a
[2:27:21] movie
[2:27:22] so it was supposed to be based on a true
[2:27:25] story but it was terrible and it was
[2:27:27] awful
[2:27:29] but i've watched it and i can't i can't
[2:27:31] already get my eyes open this morning
[2:27:33] can't hardly do my work i was way up and
[2:27:35] uh way up late
[2:27:38] i i i wanted to say just because it was
[2:27:41] a true story don't mean it's fit to
[2:27:43] watch
[2:27:46] well it's a true story that don't mean
[2:27:48] it's something you ought to be feeding
[2:27:50] on
[2:27:51] looking at
[2:27:53] it really happened to sowing so well as
[2:27:55] a soil so it might have but that
[2:27:57] shouldn't be what you're feeding on
[2:28:00] amen
[2:28:01] now
[2:28:03] you're to be married to christ
[2:28:07] can you imagine
[2:28:09] at nighttime and i'm trying to bring
[2:28:10] this down to close and i will here in a
[2:28:12] few
[2:28:15] but i'm going to mince and eat just a
[2:28:17] little more
[2:28:18] amen
[2:28:19] you're a farmer you're a mechanic
[2:28:21] preacher whatever you are
[2:28:23] you come into your little home you're
[2:28:25] longing to get there
[2:28:27] you open your door and your
[2:28:29] sweet little wife greets you and
[2:28:32] she's all prettied up and cleaned up
[2:28:34] walks over kisses you and cheek said dad
[2:28:36] you're tired
[2:28:38] sets you down in a chair sets online on
[2:28:41] your lap puts your arms around you and
[2:28:43] pets you
[2:28:44] seems like you're not tired
[2:28:46] it just picks you up
[2:28:49] it's something that god gave you
[2:28:51] for a purpose
[2:28:52] it's a part of you
[2:28:54] it's a true wife
[2:28:56] but what if
[2:28:59] those lips have kissed another man that
[2:29:01] day
[2:29:04] or some other time
[2:29:05] what if you're conscious of that
[2:29:07] what if them arms was has hugged another
[2:29:10] man
[2:29:11] she'd be an abomination on your lap
[2:29:15] that kiss would burn like a judas kiss
[2:29:20] those arms you'd rather they wouldn't be
[2:29:21] around you
[2:29:23] she might be all prettied up
[2:29:25] her hair curly
[2:29:27] her eyes may be
[2:29:29] pretty eyes and her cheeks rosy
[2:29:32] her skirts iron be so pretty
[2:29:35] but if that real genuine godly love and
[2:29:38] respect and confidence isn't there
[2:29:40] she'd be better off staying off your lap
[2:29:44] you don't want nothing to do with her
[2:29:46] she's an endeavor
[2:29:49] no matter how pretty she makes herself
[2:29:51] she's still wrong until she's proven to
[2:29:53] be a genuine
[2:29:55] real sweetheart loving nobody else but
[2:29:57] you
[2:29:58] no other kiss from her lips but yours no
[2:30:00] other arms
[2:30:02] that has held her but yours
[2:30:04] and you know it
[2:30:06] what a feeling
[2:30:08] what a consolation
[2:30:10] you see that's a husband and wife
[2:30:13] which is the type of the church
[2:30:16] when you go to church
[2:30:18] you can have the best views there is in
[2:30:20] the city
[2:30:23] you can have the best organs and best
[2:30:25] music you might dress the best you might
[2:30:28] sing like mockingbirds
[2:30:30] but if you're kissing and flirting with
[2:30:32] the world
[2:30:34] that kiss
[2:30:35] on the cheeks of christ
[2:30:37] is a judatarian kiss
[2:30:42] he looks upon you and he sees
[2:30:45] the wedding ring is gone
[2:30:48] the tablet is missing
[2:30:50] divine's love is gone it's just a form
[2:30:53] finds loyalty is gone you've committed
[2:30:55] fornications with the world
[2:31:01] you're watching things you shouldn't
[2:31:03] watch
[2:31:04] participating and feeding on things you
[2:31:06] should never be feeding them
[2:31:09] watching dirty television programs
[2:31:13] and brother branham would call that 1957
[2:31:15] dirty
[2:31:16] television programs and he said you're
[2:31:19] committing adultery
[2:31:22] against the god of heaven
[2:31:28] brother tim we don't do none but just
[2:31:29] watch reruns
[2:31:34] ah it's just harmless now you know this
[2:31:37] is baby stuff brother tim
[2:31:40] committing adultery
[2:31:42] against the god of heaven
[2:31:46] you're either believing to be a prophet
[2:31:47] or you don't
[2:31:50] you either believe he was a spiritual
[2:31:51] man or he wasn't
[2:31:53] you could say well my opinion you can
[2:31:55] just go ahead and exalt your opinion all
[2:31:57] that you want to
[2:31:59] but he said you're committing adultery
[2:32:01] and the coming of the lord is at hand
[2:32:08] if you were in danger then you're in
[2:32:10] danger now
[2:32:12] but he's knocking
[2:32:15] laodicea don't want him
[2:32:18] he's put out of his own church
[2:32:21] like david they anointed one by god but
[2:32:23] refused by the people they'd rather have
[2:32:25] a soul instead
[2:32:27] a man to rule over them
[2:32:30] i'm going to close with this
[2:32:32] this is found from the song of solomon
[2:32:35] and
[2:32:35] i'm using a different a little bit
[2:32:37] different translation for easy reading
[2:32:39] so i won't refer to the chapter and
[2:32:41] verses but if you go and read uh
[2:32:44] the song of solomon five
[2:32:48] it tells about how that
[2:32:51] you know the the the the bridegroom
[2:32:54] the husband comes home
[2:32:58] and
[2:32:58] and he's knocking
[2:33:00] he's wanting him
[2:33:03] and she says listen my beloved is
[2:33:06] knocking she recognizes it it's the lord
[2:33:08] knocking
[2:33:10] remember laodicea this age i stand at
[2:33:13] the door and i knock
[2:33:16] and he is saying open to me
[2:33:20] open to me my sister my darling my dub
[2:33:23] my flawless ones he gives all these
[2:33:26] names
[2:33:27] these sweet names is standing at her
[2:33:29] door
[2:33:31] and and he's calling for his maiden but
[2:33:34] but the sound of the voice
[2:33:36] was not enough to persuade her to open
[2:33:40] she just kept laying there
[2:33:44] she hears his voice but she don't make a
[2:33:47] move
[2:33:48] she recognizes it's him
[2:33:51] but she just keeps laying in bed
[2:33:56] the appeal of his presence simply
[2:33:58] knowing he solder out and if you just
[2:34:00] think about it you didn't see god god
[2:34:03] sought you
[2:34:07] and here he sought you out and at your
[2:34:09] door that should have been enough to
[2:34:11] persuade this this wife this maiden to
[2:34:15] go open the door
[2:34:18] just hearing his voice
[2:34:20] the voice of a beloved
[2:34:23] the sound of his call should have been
[2:34:25] enough
[2:34:27] to get her to rise
[2:34:30] and jesus said
[2:34:32] you heard it
[2:34:33] if any man will hear my voice
[2:34:37] there's been the voice of god in this
[2:34:39] last day
[2:34:41] you have the bible
[2:34:42] you've got genesis to revelation
[2:34:45] but you've also got the message to the
[2:34:48] laodicean from the seventh church age
[2:34:50] messenger
[2:34:52] and there's so much for you to feed them
[2:34:56] if you will hear the voice open the door
[2:35:01] listen to me
[2:35:03] open for me that should have been enough
[2:35:06] for him for her to open the door and
[2:35:08] then he praises his maiden you know with
[2:35:11] all of these really warm and soft
[2:35:14] complimentary turn the terms you know
[2:35:16] open to me my sister
[2:35:19] my darling my dove
[2:35:22] my flawless one
[2:35:25] amen
[2:35:26] and so he he gives a an appeal of tender
[2:35:30] names he's calling her my beloved
[2:35:33] i chose you before the foundation of the
[2:35:35] world
[2:35:36] i knew you before that you were ever
[2:35:38] born and i called you to be a bride in
[2:35:41] the end time all of these things that he
[2:35:44] speaks of you know you're blameless and
[2:35:46] you're sinless and you've been lost and
[2:35:48] you're my undefiled you're my you're my
[2:35:51] love of my life and you're standing at
[2:35:52] the door and he's knocking amen
[2:35:57] and yet
[2:35:58] with all of the things that he said
[2:36:02] it didn't get her to open the door
[2:36:07] and then
[2:36:08] he uses another persuasion
[2:36:11] my head is drenched with jew
[2:36:15] my hair with the dampness and the night
[2:36:19] i'm uncomfortable
[2:36:21] i'm standing out here in the cold
[2:36:25] i'm damp with the dew
[2:36:27] of the night
[2:36:29] i went to calgary for you
[2:36:32] paid the price of redemption
[2:36:34] i've given my all to you
[2:36:38] open the door
[2:36:43] but with all of this
[2:36:45] you'd think that would warm her heart
[2:36:47] it
[2:36:48] didn't she didn't open the door
[2:36:53] for the beloved and let him in
[2:36:55] in fact to the matter is
[2:36:59] with everything that he's done his voice
[2:37:02] his compliments
[2:37:05] his his speaking of his own discomfort
[2:37:08] my hair is wet my my back i i'm filled
[2:37:11] with the dew of the night i've been out
[2:37:13] i've been toiling for you i've done all
[2:37:15] of this for you
[2:37:17] open the door for me let me in
[2:37:22] now listen this is not a stranger
[2:37:25] this is the husband coming home
[2:37:30] and here as it is she only makes excuses
[2:37:36] she's comfortable in her bed
[2:37:38] she's at ease in zion
[2:37:41] so he can't come in she can't be
[2:37:43] bothered with the inconvenience of
[2:37:44] dressing herself preparing herself for
[2:37:47] sleep again she said i've washed my feet
[2:37:49] how can i defile them
[2:37:52] i've taken off my robe once i put it on
[2:37:54] again i've washed my feet do i need to
[2:37:56] soil them again
[2:37:59] she's not willing to be inconvenienced
[2:38:04] now i told you already reading your
[2:38:06] bible and praying making a time morning
[2:38:10] and night for this word of god
[2:38:12] but how many don't want to be
[2:38:15] inconvenient
[2:38:20] she did not appreciate
[2:38:22] maybe the unexpected visit
[2:38:25] i don't know
[2:38:27] maybe come in a lot later than she had
[2:38:29] expected of him and she was annoyed
[2:38:34] maybe it was her effort just to control
[2:38:37] the relationship
[2:38:41] i'll let you have as much of
[2:38:43] of me as i want to
[2:38:45] i'm not giving my whole self
[2:38:49] why should i run as soon as he knocks i
[2:38:52] can i he can wait a little while this
[2:38:54] can wait
[2:38:58] whatever the specific reason
[2:39:00] she refused just to promptly rise
[2:39:03] and open the door
[2:39:05] and the bible said
[2:39:07] that because iniquity shall abound
[2:39:10] the love of many shall wax cold
[2:39:15] the bible tells you about losing your
[2:39:18] first love
[2:39:21] i want you to think about it her problem
[2:39:23] though you know was not that she didn't
[2:39:25] go to the door she
[2:39:27] eventually she did
[2:39:30] but she went slowly and reluctantly she
[2:39:33] was making excuses all the way
[2:39:36] her attitude showed an insistent spirit
[2:39:39] you know she was thinking about her
[2:39:41] comfort and not at all about the
[2:39:43] bridegroom's desires
[2:39:46] the soul desire
[2:39:50] now
[2:39:53] maybe the girl felt resentment toward
[2:39:55] the bridegroom
[2:39:57] perhaps he had delayed his coming
[2:40:00] the bible tells us
[2:40:01] this will be a part of the end time
[2:40:03] process
[2:40:05] men will say the lord has delayed his
[2:40:07] coming so with part of his coming is a
[2:40:09] delay and in that delay people get weary
[2:40:14] slothful
[2:40:16] lazy
[2:40:17] sleepy
[2:40:22] the girl maybe felt resentment towards
[2:40:25] her bridegroom
[2:40:26] he delayed his coming
[2:40:29] she's not more interested in her sleep
[2:40:32] her needs
[2:40:33] her comfort
[2:40:34] rather than his needs and his comfort
[2:40:40] it reminds me of how we have become more
[2:40:42] interested
[2:40:43] in terran until he comes instead of his
[2:40:46] coming
[2:40:49] we started out with the emphasis being
[2:40:51] on his coming
[2:40:53] but we are winding up with
[2:40:57] being more
[2:41:00] interested in the terrying process
[2:41:03] of waiting
[2:41:05] of doing this and doing that and living
[2:41:07] life just like it's gonna go on for
[2:41:09] another thousand years it won't
[2:41:12] this is laodicea the last age
[2:41:18] look all around you the end time is
[2:41:20] everywhere
[2:41:26] my beloved has put his hand by the latch
[2:41:28] of the door he's rattling the lights
[2:41:32] he's trying to get her attention
[2:41:35] trying to wake her up come open to me
[2:41:38] the maiden could hear the beloved put
[2:41:41] his hand on the lights and the mechanism
[2:41:43] of the door is a clear and final
[2:41:45] indication of his desire to enter and to
[2:41:48] be with her but was only going to be at
[2:41:50] her invitation
[2:41:52] i want you to get this
[2:41:54] he would not break the door down
[2:41:57] he would not bust the lights
[2:42:00] it can only be
[2:42:02] at her invitation
[2:42:04] god is waiting on you
[2:42:07] like abraham to run to meet him to stand
[2:42:11] by him unto the tree to see to his every
[2:42:15] need
[2:42:16] [Music]
[2:42:18] i hope you get it
[2:42:24] he insisted she open it
[2:42:27] not him force it
[2:42:31] the husband refused to force himself
[2:42:34] upon his maiden and will only enter at
[2:42:36] her invitation he will not break down
[2:42:39] that door
[2:42:42] finally she rises
[2:42:44] and she says i arose and i to open for
[2:42:48] my beloved
[2:42:51] she had delayed a long
[2:42:52] time delayed out of self-interest
[2:42:56] self-indulgence
[2:42:58] maybe
[2:42:59] connect something connected with her
[2:43:00] resentment of
[2:43:02] it didn't happen when i thought or i've
[2:43:04] been disappointed along the way or
[2:43:08] and he she finally gets up
[2:43:11] and she goes to the door
[2:43:13] and when she does
[2:43:14] she feels there on the door handle
[2:43:17] her hands dip with myrrh
[2:43:21] and she noticed the latch of the doors
[2:43:23] been anointed with a sweet perfume
[2:43:27] he had left her a love note
[2:43:32] and then went away
[2:43:36] left her a love note just the smell of
[2:43:38] him
[2:43:40] was all that was left
[2:43:43] and she looks for him and she can't find
[2:43:45] him
[2:43:46] you see there will come a day when men
[2:43:49] will look for god and never find him
[2:43:52] that's why jesus said seek you
[2:43:54] seek me while you may
[2:43:58] amen you know right now today is the day
[2:44:00] of salvation you never put it off
[2:44:04] you never put god off
[2:44:07] you don't push him out of your life you
[2:44:09] put him first place
[2:44:11] i rose to open for my beloved my hands
[2:44:14] dripped
[2:44:15] and with my my fingers were flowing with
[2:44:18] myrrh on the handles of the boat bolt
[2:44:21] i opened for my beloved but my beloved
[2:44:23] head left
[2:44:25] he was gone
[2:44:28] and my heart sank at his
[2:44:30] departure i looked for him
[2:44:34] i didn't find him
[2:44:36] i called for him
[2:44:38] and he didn't answer
[2:44:41] all you need to know is bible
[2:44:45] god said himself
[2:44:47] to those that he calls
[2:44:50] he said there'll come a time
[2:44:52] i'll call
[2:44:53] i won't call anymore you'll call
[2:44:57] and i won't answer
[2:45:00] i called but he gave me no answer
[2:45:03] now the rules are reversed
[2:45:06] first it was him calling she wouldn't
[2:45:08] answer
[2:45:11] now it's her calling he won't answer
[2:45:17] she had foolishly waited too long
[2:45:21] want you to get the start
[2:45:24] now then she goes out in the streets
[2:45:28] wandering
[2:45:30] in the night seeking
[2:45:32] for her lover
[2:45:34] when she should have been in the safety
[2:45:36] of her own home
[2:45:37] and in the arms of her beloved and under
[2:45:40] his protection but instead
[2:45:43] he is outside of his own church laodicea
[2:45:46] i stand at the door knock
[2:45:49] and the watchmen find her
[2:45:52] and the watchmen of the city found me
[2:45:54] and struck me and they wounded me
[2:45:57] and the and and and you know there again
[2:46:00] she didn't find her her beloved neither
[2:46:02] did she find help from the watchmen and
[2:46:04] the keepers of the wall actually took
[2:46:07] her veil away from her
[2:46:10] not only was she unsuccessful in finding
[2:46:12] but
[2:46:13] those
[2:46:14] they you know didn't that that did find
[2:46:17] her they didn't sympathize with her
[2:46:18] enough and she felt they mistreated her
[2:46:24] and i really wonder
[2:46:26] when i when i review the scripture
[2:46:29] if because of her guilt and her shame
[2:46:32] and her neglect
[2:46:33] of turning him away
[2:46:35] and letting him stand outside drenched
[2:46:38] with drew with
[2:46:40] do and thinking only of her own comfort
[2:46:44] now she don't interpret the correction
[2:46:47] of the watchman
[2:46:48] as a beating
[2:46:52] many
[2:46:53] look at the message now
[2:46:55] and the messenger
[2:46:56] has been too harsh
[2:46:59] too hard
[2:47:01] too judgmental
[2:47:03] too unloving
[2:47:05] too unsymptomed sympathetic
[2:47:08] and here she corrected by the watchmen
[2:47:11] she feels wounded by them
[2:47:14] the watchmen say why did you do this
[2:47:18] how could you have turned him away
[2:47:21] your laziness after god is your crying
[2:47:24] sin
[2:47:25] and this perceives treatment by the
[2:47:28] watchmen reflects the girl's guilt and
[2:47:30] the sense of failure at the slowness of
[2:47:32] the response to your husband
[2:47:36] and is in correction by the ministry
[2:47:38] because of your failure to worship him
[2:47:41] not for not dressing with holiness to
[2:47:43] please him
[2:47:44] listening to his voice
[2:47:47] watson have a responsibility
[2:47:50] and sometimes you feel like i walk out
[2:47:52] of church and i got a real beauty listen
[2:47:54] you should have never quit listening to
[2:47:57] his voice
[2:47:59] you should never be wandering out there
[2:48:01] dressed the way you are looking the way
[2:48:03] you are acting the way you are or coming
[2:48:06] to church and refusing to worship him
[2:48:13] then you get angry and all the watchmen
[2:48:16] beat me he beat me he said something
[2:48:19] about because i wouldn't respond he beat
[2:48:22] me he beat me listen it's our
[2:48:24] responsibility we're watchmen
[2:48:28] send the girl back to the house
[2:48:31] get back there in your position
[2:48:33] he's going to come again
[2:48:35] and when he comes again this time don't
[2:48:37] turn him away
[2:48:40] open up the door for him
[2:48:42] fellowship with him and he with you
[2:48:49] see it's a reflection of your own guilt
[2:48:51] and the sense of failure
[2:48:54] and your neglect of the bridegroom by
[2:48:56] letting him stand out drenched with dew
[2:49:00] begging to come in
[2:49:03] now listen
[2:49:07] the greater
[2:49:09] the dignity of the person offended the
[2:49:11] greater is the offense
[2:49:14] let me say that again so you can wrap
[2:49:16] your minds around it
[2:49:18] the greater the dignity of the person
[2:49:21] offended
[2:49:22] the greater is the offense
[2:49:27] if i would hit one of my brothers
[2:49:29] they're all adults
[2:49:31] and i would hit them in anger not joking
[2:49:34] but in anger
[2:49:35] it would be a great offense
[2:49:39] if i were to hit my daddy
[2:49:42] it would be even greater
[2:49:46] it would be a greater offense
[2:49:48] if i hit a police officer
[2:49:52] greater still if an anger
[2:49:55] i would hit the president
[2:49:58] could you imagine
[2:50:00] get an audience with with mr biden and
[2:50:03] slap him
[2:50:06] that would be a great offense
[2:50:09] you know
[2:50:10] the world's got in england a new king
[2:50:14] to hit the king
[2:50:16] would be a great offense
[2:50:18] to it king solomon would have been a
[2:50:20] great offense
[2:50:22] but the greatest offense
[2:50:26] if i was to hit an anger the lord of
[2:50:29] glory jesus christ
[2:50:32] and in his death people turn a blind eye
[2:50:34] and spit on him and
[2:50:36] similar to how the bride so to speak
[2:50:39] turned her nose up at her beloved
[2:50:41] knocking at the door and didn't open his
[2:50:44] voice
[2:50:46] see how the offense gets greater
[2:50:48] depending on the dignity and the
[2:50:50] worthiness and the regard of the person
[2:50:54] brother father police officer president
[2:50:56] solomon king of kings to the king of
[2:50:58] kings the lord of lord jesus christ
[2:51:01] and all sin is evil
[2:51:04] yet sin against our great god is the
[2:51:06] greatest of evils
[2:51:08] to turn him away
[2:51:10] when he's knocking
[2:51:12] is the worst
[2:51:14] offensible sin
[2:51:17] no wonder the watchmen beat her
[2:51:20] no wonder they sent her home get back to
[2:51:22] your position look what your slothmates
[2:51:24] has done look what you're in serious and
[2:51:26] serious kind done and the maiden goes
[2:51:29] and says daughters of jerusalem
[2:51:32] now she regrets it
[2:51:34] she's suffering because of her previous
[2:51:37] action her her slothfulness she's she
[2:51:40] says if you find him tell him i'm love
[2:51:42] sick
[2:51:44] now she's loved sick
[2:51:46] but not all in the sense you know that
[2:51:48] she was and like the earlier solomon uh
[2:51:51] the chapters of the song of solomon
[2:51:53] chapter two but priests previously she
[2:51:56] was overwhelmed by his love but here she
[2:51:58] was aching at his absence
[2:52:01] oh
[2:52:02] he's gone
[2:52:05] you see in our spiritual life there are
[2:52:07] some sicknesses that we get
[2:52:10] sin sickness
[2:52:14] when the soul hates sin and wants
[2:52:16] nothing to do with it
[2:52:19] self-sickness
[2:52:21] when the soul comes to hate
[2:52:23] self-indulgence and self-seeking and
[2:52:25] self-exalting and self-reliance on every
[2:52:28] sort
[2:52:30] love sickness
[2:52:31] of the first type when the believers so
[2:52:34] deeply moved by the love of god that
[2:52:36] they can hardly
[2:52:37] bear it for themselves see she become
[2:52:40] lovesick
[2:52:41] this is what i want you to do get so
[2:52:43] love sick that you're sick of sin
[2:52:47] so love so love sick with god until
[2:52:50] you're sick of your own self and your
[2:52:53] selfishness and your pride
[2:52:57] love's sick until
[2:52:59] when he's missing from your life when
[2:53:01] you don't hear him
[2:53:03] you feel distance
[2:53:05] and even deserted
[2:53:07] and you long for renewal of closeness
[2:53:12] the bible said as the
[2:53:14] as the deer
[2:53:16] pantheth
[2:53:18] for the water brook
[2:53:20] so thirsteth my soul
[2:53:23] after the o god
[2:53:26] i want you to bow your heads with me his
[2:53:28] musicians come
[2:53:33] and i want you to look at your own life
[2:53:36] he knocks
[2:53:39] or you open it
[2:53:42] he comes down he's calling you all kinds
[2:53:45] of wonderful names
[2:53:47] my bride my chosen my elect my people
[2:53:51] my sons my daughters
[2:53:55] he gives you all these enduring
[2:53:57] endearing terms
[2:54:00] trying to get you to open
[2:54:05] he speaks
[2:54:06] over and over and over again
[2:54:10] his voice
[2:54:11] the voice of god in this last day ought
[2:54:14] to bring you to a new level of sincerity
[2:54:17] dedication
[2:54:19] consecration
[2:54:21] and i'm asking you
[2:54:23] look at yourself
[2:54:26] are you really feeding the inner man
[2:54:29] on the right things
[2:54:34] what about it are you slow to respond to
[2:54:37] him
[2:54:40] sitting in a service or are you do you
[2:54:43] just let it pass you by and
[2:54:45] oh i've heard all this kind of things
[2:54:47] before
[2:54:48] go ahead and give me the key of e flat
[2:54:50] you know what i want to play
[2:54:56] [Music]
[2:54:58] what about you
[2:55:00] [Music]
[2:55:02] he knocks
[2:55:04] are you making excuses
[2:55:08] you remember there there was an
[2:55:10] invitation to come to a wedding in the
[2:55:11] bible
[2:55:12] once said well i bought a i bought a uh
[2:55:16] land and i got to go and see it another
[2:55:19] i bought a yoke of oxen i've got to go
[2:55:21] do this
[2:55:24] it wasn't bad things
[2:55:27] buy a yoke of oxen i married a wife
[2:55:30] all these excuses that they gave not to
[2:55:32] come to the wedding supper
[2:55:35] that wasn't bad things it wouldn't be a
[2:55:37] bad people
[2:55:39] but it was bad to turn down
[2:55:42] his invitation there was nothing more
[2:55:45] important
[2:55:49] than him
[2:55:50] [Music]
[2:55:56] i wondered today do you really realize
[2:56:00] who you're pushing out of your life
[2:56:04] the greater the dignity of the person
[2:56:06] the greater offense
[2:56:09] to think that god would come and knock
[2:56:11] at your door to give you an opportunity
[2:56:14] say i want to deliver you
[2:56:17] i want to bring you into a new
[2:56:19] relationship

[3:18:12] [Music]
[3:18:21] foreign
[3:18:37] [Music]
[3:18:39] amen
[3:18:41] praise the lord that's the truth we want
[3:18:43] to see him and to look upon his face and
[3:18:46] you know we want to be
[3:18:48] there in that number and uh we want to
[3:18:51] to go we want our children to go with us
[3:18:54] and of course you know we're here to
[3:18:56] obey the lord and and all that he said
[3:18:59] and all that he said for us to do
[3:19:02] the bible said he that believeth and is
[3:19:04] baptized shall be saved
[3:19:06] he that believeth not shall be condemned
[3:19:09] it also says and peter said it this way
[3:19:12] he said
[3:19:14] that as as
[3:19:17] as noah there was uh
[3:19:19] the the world was baptized with water he
[3:19:22] said so are we to be baptized and he
[3:19:24] goes on to explain
[3:19:26] that baptism doth now save us
[3:19:29] not in putting away the filth of the
[3:19:31] flesh
[3:19:32] but in the answer of a good conscience
[3:19:36] toward god
[3:19:37] so we're here today part of salvation is
[3:19:40] calling on the name of the lord
[3:19:42] and as he told
[3:19:44] uh saul on the road to damascus when he
[3:19:48] was struck down by the bill of fire and
[3:19:50] he said who art thou lord he said i am
[3:19:52] jesus
[3:19:54] and
[3:19:54] so then he was instructed to go and
[3:19:58] and to ananias and his eyes would be
[3:20:01] open
[3:20:02] and he was to be baptized calling on the
[3:20:04] name of the lord and the name of the
[3:20:06] lord had just been revealed to him as
[3:20:09] jesus
[3:20:10] so
[3:20:11] all that we do in word or deed we are to
[3:20:14] do
[3:20:15] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[3:20:18] this is the commission that god gave us
[3:20:21] all through the bible no one was ever
[3:20:23] baptized in any other way
[3:20:26] than in the name of jesus christ it is
[3:20:28] the name above all names that at the
[3:20:30] name of jesus every knee has to bow and
[3:20:33] every tongue confess that he
[3:20:35] is lord
[3:20:37] so we're taken on the name of our lord
[3:20:39] and just as a wife takes on the name of
[3:20:44] her husband so does the church a type of
[3:20:46] the wife is to take on the name of her
[3:20:49] husband jesus christ
[3:20:51] all of these things are true when a son
[3:20:54] is born into a family our child is born
[3:20:56] in the family takes his father's name
[3:20:58] we are taking on the name of the one we
[3:21:01] are born from when we're born again
[3:21:04] we receive of that name
[3:21:07] so we're coming bringing jackson here
[3:21:09] today as i explained to you
[3:21:12] he's a young man but he's given his
[3:21:14] heart to the lord and he sincerely wants
[3:21:16] to serve the lord so today we are going
[3:21:20] to take and baptize him in the name of
[3:21:22] the lord jesus
[3:21:24] so jackson
[3:21:26] the lord jesus sent me into the world to
[3:21:28] preach the gospel
[3:21:30] now he commissioned his disciples in
[3:21:32] matthew 28 19 to go into all the world
[3:21:35] and to preach the gospel baptizing them
[3:21:38] in the name
[3:21:40] of the father and of the son and of the
[3:21:42] holy ghost
[3:21:43] in obedience to that divine command
[3:21:46] i baptize you in the name of the lord
[3:21:49] jesus christ
[3:21:52] thank you lord
[3:22:04] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[3:22:10] hallelujah

[3:22:26] more than ever that i've heard that's
[3:22:27] coming and so we're gonna
[3:22:29] have quite a quite a bit here among us
[3:22:31] and we're looking forward to that a lot
[3:22:34] of expectation and things that are and
