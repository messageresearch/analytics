[38:43] Theron and there's a number of our folks

[39:00] world
[39:01] I'm glad that with our sister churches

[39:07] could be like Daniel was who who got
[39:11] separated from all his friends and and
[39:14] fellow church members and served God
[39:16] alone in his generation but God has
[39:19] blessed us in a mighty mighty way amen
[39:23] that we can have fellowship with one
[39:25] another
[39:26] amen and just this assembling of
[39:29] ourselves together to come together and
[39:33] share today our lick of fire with one
[39:36] another in words of encouragement with
[39:38] one another is always very very
[39:40] important and part of the Christian duty
[39:42] a man so good to be in the house of God
[39:46] together let's sing the song it's a is
[39:49] always my theme and I want us to sing it
[39:52] that today is Jesus on the inside
[39:54] working on the outside because really if
[39:57] we don't accomplish that having Jesus on
[40:00] the inside and changing our lives we
[40:03] have accomplished nothing
[40:05] by coming to the church or being
[40:07] religious or or anything if it ain't
[40:10] Jesus on the inside and working on the
[40:13] outside we have failed what we've been
[40:16] called to do hey man so let's listen
[40:19] sing it together now well it's Jesus
[40:22] song
[40:23] [Music]
[40:31] [Music]
[40:45] [Music]
[41:14] [Music]
[41:28] [Music]
[41:48] [Music]
[41:50] we got to display our token Amen that
[41:55] the blood of Christ has been applied to
[41:56] our lives and they you know and we can
[41:59] talk about it all we want to well it's
[42:01] on the inside but it's got to show on
[42:03] the outside amen god bless you let's
[42:06] turn to Galatians chapter 3 and verse 23
[42:09] for our scripture reading this morning
[42:11] and we have some things we're going to
[42:14] be minister known I'm going to take this
[42:17] I'm going to call this part the age of
[42:20] life and we're talking about the AIDS of
[42:23] time that we're living in and that it is
[42:27] the age of the personal life of Jesus
[42:30] Christ amen that's what's got to be
[42:33] displayed not not a profession of faith
[42:36] not a work of sanctification not even a
[42:40] demonstration of a gift of the Spirit
[42:43] but the very personal life of Christ
[42:47] being on display and this is this must
[42:51] take preeminence over everything and one
[42:55] thing that you seek for with all your
[42:57] life with all your heart is to have his
[43:00] life on display in yours amen whether
[43:04] you're a young person or whether you're
[43:06] an older person whether you're in
[43:08] middle-age whether you're young married
[43:11] whether you're at the time of marriage
[43:13] it doesn't matter what age or stage of
[43:15] life you're in you must display Christ
[43:19] to this generation this time amen so
[43:23] Galatians chapter 3 and verse 23 but
[43:26] before faith came we were kept under the
[43:30] law and I may take just a moment and
[43:32] explain some of these verses as we go
[43:34] along but as Paul was dealing with the
[43:37] Galatians who were actually new
[43:41] Christians but now they were being
[43:44] pulled back by the Judaizers Judaizers
[43:47] back into circumcisions keeping certain
[43:52] days and rituals or whatever and Paul is
[43:55] trying to show them
[43:57] that that that was a time of the law
[44:01] what we were under the schoolmaster to
[44:04] bring us to Christ to show us the need
[44:06] for Christ so he would use different
[44:10] things for example the Sabbath day rest
[44:11] to show you there was a rest coming and
[44:15] when you have entered into the Holy
[44:17] Ghost you have entered into that Sabbath
[44:20] rest so that's our true keeping of the
[44:22] Sabbath amen circumcision again which
[44:26] would be a show within the flesh God
[44:29] claiming the seed life and and that that
[44:32] of course spiritually happens by the
[44:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost where that we
[44:37] are circumcised by the new birth so but
[44:41] before faith came we were kept under the
[44:43] law shut up unto the faith which should
[44:46] afterwards be revealed wherefore the law
[44:50] was our schoolmaster now these are key
[44:53] statements the law the schoolmaster to
[44:57] bring us unto Christ now some of you
[44:59] have your message student you know right
[45:01] now brother Branham taught us that the
[45:04] tutor was the Holy Ghost well sure he is
[45:07] the holy the tutor or the schoolmaster
[45:09] is the Holy Ghost using the law to
[45:12] convince you of the sin in other words
[45:15] showing you that you cannot keep it on
[45:18] your own and the manna and convincing
[45:20] you you're doing this wrong you're doing
[45:22] that wrong is showing you the law and
[45:24] that you're still a law breaker so you
[45:27] you need the Holy Ghost in to set you
[45:30] free from the bondage of sin so he's a
[45:33] schoolmaster to bring us to Christ so
[45:37] it's the convicting power of God that we
[45:40] might be declared righteous are
[45:43] justified by faith but after that faith
[45:46] is come we no longer are we are no
[45:50] longer under a schoolmaster so we're no
[45:53] longer under the law Amen because now
[45:56] Christ has come and so we're not under
[45:58] the law and it's rules and regulations
[46:00] rather there's a law of God within our
[46:03] hearts Amen that causes us to keep the
[46:05] word for you are all the children
[46:08] God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many
[46:12] of you um as have been baptized into
[46:17] Christ have put on Christ and there is
[46:19] neither Jew nor Greek there is neither
[46:22] bond nor free there is neither male nor
[46:25] female for you are all one in Christ
[46:29] Jesus
[46:29] and if you be Christ and then you are be
[46:33] you are you Abraham's seed and heirs
[46:37] according to the promise
[46:40] now we're going right now down into
[46:42] verse one now I say he says after I've
[46:46] established this this is what I'm saying
[46:49] that the heir as long as he is a child
[46:52] now when are you a child when you're
[46:54] under the schoolmaster a man before
[46:58] Christ comes and so he is type in this
[47:02] as the heir now before Christ comes you
[47:06] know yet you're you're potentially heir
[47:08] of everything but you differ nothing
[47:11] from a servant though he be Lord of all
[47:15] so potentially he's Lord of all but as a
[47:18] child he can't come and choose his full
[47:21] inheritance and participate in the
[47:24] inheritance are you with me alright but
[47:27] is under tutors and governors unto the
[47:30] time appointed of the Father now he's
[47:32] actually taken the Greek Roman law of
[47:35] adoption of how a child now is to be
[47:39] child trained and he comes to that age
[47:41] of maturity where he can be now about
[47:44] father's business and doing the father's
[47:47] work and acting in the father's name so
[47:49] is even but is under tutors and
[47:52] governors into the time appointed of the
[47:55] Father even so we when we were children
[47:59] were in bondage under the elements of
[48:03] the world see because we were we're
[48:05] still sinners we were still working with
[48:08] this not even though potentially we were
[48:11] children of God we're still in bondage
[48:14] under the elements of the world but when
[48:17] the fullness of time was come
[48:20] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[48:23] made under the law to redeem them that
[48:26] were under the law that we might receive
[48:28] the adoption of sons and because you are
[48:33] sons God has sent for the spirit of his
[48:38] son into your hearts crying Abba Father
[48:42] and wherefore thou art no more a servant
[48:46] but a son and if a son then heir of God
[48:51] through Christ a man reaches a point in
[48:55] your life you're no longer a servant but
[48:59] a son and use the son all the time but
[49:02] you differed nothing from a servant
[49:04] though you were Lord of all potentially
[49:07] but when Christ come by the power of the
[49:10] Holy Ghost in your life then you are no
[49:13] more a servant among the relationship
[49:16] changes and the kingdom is handed over
[49:19] to you
[49:20] and man and you're an heir of God
[49:22] through Christ everything that God has
[49:25] is yours hey man that all comes by the
[49:29] new birth god bless you you can be
[49:31] seated I want to remind you that well
[49:35] you know as what our theme has been is
[49:37] the people of the book have returned to
[49:40] the land of the book and let me remind
[49:43] you again why we have returned here why
[49:46] have we come back to the land of the
[49:49] book how come we come back to this
[49:51] promised land of the Holy Ghost that is
[49:54] so that we might see the Messiah it is a
[49:59] rapture age as a rapture time and so to
[50:02] be able to to receive this rapture
[50:05] there's got to be a people in their
[50:07] homeland
[50:08] amen now so so we have returned to this
[50:12] homeland for the rapture of the Bride of
[50:15] Christ this is the ultimate of the very
[50:18] reason why become we have not come to
[50:20] establish churches that will be
[50:22] different from the Methodists Baptists
[50:24] or Presbyterians we have not come here
[50:26] so that um we could have a little place
[50:29] that just preaches
[50:32] different doctor than everybody we have
[50:34] come here to see the Messiah we have
[50:38] come we have returned to this place for
[50:41] the rapture of the Bride of Christ amen
[50:44] to see Jesus return and he he's got to
[50:48] have a people who have made himself
[50:50] ready he's got to have a people who are
[50:53] positioned in their the land of the
[50:56] promise and are ready for him to come
[50:59] Nepal is showing the Galatians that
[51:01] there was a freedom in Christ that moved
[51:05] the church from servanthood to sonship
[51:09] now that ought to be the goal of every
[51:11] person is to leave servanthood behind
[51:15] and become a full-fledged son of God
[51:18] amen
[51:20] now there were others of course in that
[51:23] time that we're trying to provoke the
[51:24] gospel and to bring them back in the
[51:27] bondage under the law now I just want to
[51:31] get back to you for a moment Nepal when
[51:34] we're done we talk about these men and
[51:37] he would even talk about his stance and
[51:39] he was saying I can't preach any other
[51:42] revelation than what I preached and he
[51:45] said no one can add to this and no one
[51:47] can take away from it if you look with
[51:50] me in Galatians 1 8 you'll see he become
[51:52] emphatically says it twice we won't read
[51:55] but the incidences but right there in
[51:57] the same chapter he says though we are
[52:00] an angel from heaven preach any other
[52:03] gospel unto you that which we have
[52:05] preached unto you let him be accursed
[52:09] amen
[52:10] so he becomes very very clear and
[52:13] emphatic that nothing else can be
[52:16] preached but what I preached and he said
[52:19] because what I preached to you is the
[52:21] unadulterated Word and it can't be
[52:23] changed and he was separating law from
[52:27] grace and of course here was the people
[52:29] of the past age that was trying to
[52:31] confuse the Galatians with the past
[52:34] ideas and doctrines and trying to
[52:37] intermingle it and mix it with what Paul
[52:40] was preaching and
[52:41] and Paul was had separated law in
[52:44] Grayson he said I can't preach you any
[52:46] other gospel and if anybody know we and
[52:50] he includes himself or if an angel from
[52:52] heaven comes and preach any other gospel
[52:54] than what I preach to you let him be
[52:57] accursed now you see and I'm quoting
[52:59] this now from the church's book on this
[53:01] scripture
[53:02] it was the Apostles who brought the
[53:05] original word to the people and that
[53:08] original word could not change even a
[53:12] dot or a dash it and Paul knew it was
[53:16] God who spoke it who had spoken it to
[53:19] him so he said even if I come and try to
[53:24] give a second revelation and try to make
[53:28] one little change and what I gave
[53:31] originally let me be accurst you see
[53:35] Paul knew that the first revelation was
[53:38] correct and God can't give a verse
[53:41] revelation and then a second revelation
[53:43] if he did he would be changing his mind
[53:46] so now he can't give me original church
[53:49] and Christ be our high priest and his
[53:52] blood be what is necessary to cleanse us
[53:55] from sin and we get down to the end here
[53:58] and we don't need a high priest and so
[54:00] the blood is replaced for some
[54:02] make-believe faith that we claim to have
[54:05] to end and so again again Paul knew what
[54:10] he had preached was correct and let me
[54:13] tell you that's got to be the gospel
[54:15] that we preach today it is not cannot be
[54:19] something added to or taken away from so
[54:22] Paul knew the first revelation was
[54:24] correct
[54:24] God can't give a first revelation and
[54:27] then a second revelation if you did he
[54:30] would be changing his mind he can't give
[54:33] a revelation and then add to it as he
[54:35] did in the Garden of Eden when he
[54:37] promised the seed to the woman and then
[54:40] later designated that the seed had to
[54:42] come through Abraham and then later said
[54:44] it would come by the same bloodlines and
[54:46] David but it was the same revelation it
[54:49] only gave the people more
[54:51] information to help them receive and
[54:53] understand it but the word cannot be
[54:57] changed
[54:58] I'm not gods that kind of a God whatever
[55:01] he said that's the way it stands amen
[55:05] times don't change it personal opinions
[55:07] don't change it even a prophet can't
[55:10] change it
[55:10] the Apostle Paul himself couldn't change
[55:13] it it is our absolute remember that the
[55:17] Bible is our absolute now brother
[55:20] Branham never one time ever said he was
[55:23] our absolute he said the Bible the Word
[55:26] of God is our absolute
[55:29] amen now of course we believe that
[55:32] brother Branham preached the Bible so
[55:34] therefore we can take what he said but
[55:36] again ever revelation of ours has got to
[55:39] have scriptural foundation
[55:42] it cannot be contrary to the word and if
[55:46] you give some ideas from and you want to
[55:48] take and cherry-pick your quotes and
[55:50] come up with some different idea if it
[55:52] don't come along with what's in the
[55:54] Bible if it comes to conclusions the
[55:57] Bible didn't make from Genesis to
[56:00] Revelation for example blood it takes
[56:03] blood all the way from Genesis all the
[56:06] way through revelation all the way to
[56:08] the impact God will only redeem papa
[56:13] there is no redemption of any kind
[56:16] except by blood hey man hey man now uh
[56:22] well you know again from the church
[56:25] Facebook I'd like to share this it's
[56:27] just skipping down a little bit in the
[56:29] page one of these days there's gonna
[56:31] come a prophet to the Laodicean Church
[56:34] age and you will know if he's a real one
[56:37] sent from God or not oh yes you will for
[56:40] if he is of God he will be in that word
[56:45] exactly as God gave it to Paul he will
[56:50] not deviate from that word for a moment
[56:53] not by one eye
[56:55] odor in that last age when there will be
[56:59] many false prophets appearance watch and
[57:02] see how they keep telling you that if
[57:04] you don't believe them and what they say
[57:06] you know is that you you'll be lost in
[57:08] other words you don't get my revelation
[57:10] you don't have my take on things if you
[57:12] can't see it this way you're gonna be
[57:14] lost you're gonna miss the rapture and
[57:16] he said he said there'll be many false
[57:19] prophets that will come he meant but he
[57:22] said if when that last a prophet comes
[57:25] he on the scene he if he's truly that
[57:29] prophet he will be crying out get back
[57:32] to the word or you're lost
[57:36] he won't build on private revelation or
[57:39] interpretation but on the word amen and
[57:43] amen now that's what your trumpet had to
[57:45] say about a man he realized himself he
[57:49] could not bring another message that
[57:51] Paul didn't bring a man or another
[57:54] gospel that Paul didn't didn't bring you
[57:56] said well but now brother Tim we got
[57:58] more then Oh what Paul had no we've got
[58:01] exactly what Paul preached hey man we
[58:06] cannot deviate it not one iota so what
[58:11] we we got the understanding of the book
[58:13] of Revelation yeah the book of
[58:15] Revelation wouldn't even written to Paul
[58:16] Paul didn't even know it he was gone
[58:19] before it was even written hey man so it
[58:23] was left for this endtime people but not
[58:26] to bring us on another gospel that Paul
[58:27] didn't bring but to bring us back to
[58:31] show us how the church got off the track
[58:33] and bring us back to Paul's gospel
[58:36] once again hey man now so again let me
[58:41] just get it clear the only place a
[58:43] rapture is going to be is if you are in
[58:47] the homeland of the Holy Ghost of this
[58:51] Bible are you with me back in the word
[58:53] again
[58:55] and that's gotta be your measured line
[58:57] not your experience or jumping or
[59:00] shouting or dancing or are we I believe
[59:03] the message or I've got a profession of
[59:06] faith or I believe God sent a prophet
[59:07] but your your you've got to have your
[59:11] faith firmly
[59:13] I am the Word of God amen so his story
[59:18] it's coming right back to this Bible
[59:20] again back to the homeland again like we
[59:23] said that's the only place the rapture
[59:25] is going to be the rapture will not be
[59:28] for anyone outside of the homeland let's
[59:32] just look at this thought just as a type
[59:35] now just as Abraham wanted Sarah to be
[59:39] buried in DES and the homeland he had
[59:43] been given the land so he when Sarah
[59:46] died he buried her in the Cave of
[59:49] Machpelah right and my brother branham
[59:52] could tell us exactly why he said
[59:54] because you had been in that land and
[59:57] Joe was buried in that lamb and so Jove
[1:00:00] at the revelation that I know that my
[1:00:03] Redeemer liveth remember Joe was before
[1:00:06] Abraham is not there in the Bible
[1:00:07] his words chronologically his place but
[1:00:10] actually Jobe predated Abraham are you
[1:00:14] with me and Joe had a revelation you
[1:00:17] know that in my flesh I will see God so
[1:00:20] he knew that the Messiah would be coming
[1:00:23] to that land and Jobe was buried in that
[1:00:27] promised land
[1:00:28] and he wanted also Sarah buried in that
[1:00:31] promised land now what does that type
[1:00:34] show us that type shows us that everyone
[1:00:37] who is buried in Christ will be a part
[1:00:41] of that resurrection every one of us who
[1:00:45] are in Christ will be a part of that
[1:00:48] rapture there will be no rapture for
[1:00:50] anybody outside of that promised land
[1:00:55] amount now so everyone was to be buried
[1:00:59] in the promised land and we know that
[1:01:03] everyone that is buried in Christ will
[1:01:06] be in that resin
[1:01:07] correction and in this case it will not
[1:01:09] be anyone raptured who is not in Christ
[1:01:13] amen you have to be in the promised land
[1:01:15] to see the Messiah those who remain
[1:01:18] behind like those coming from Egypt
[1:01:22] those who stayed in Egypt died there
[1:01:24] those who died in the world of
[1:01:26] wilderness
[1:01:27] you know Jesus was safe there everyone
[1:01:29] dead a man those who stayed at caters
[1:01:33] Barnea and died in the wilderness going
[1:01:35] around the mountain over and over and
[1:01:37] over again around the mountain never
[1:01:39] entered into the promised land they died
[1:01:41] there amen jesus said there everyone
[1:01:45] dead
[1:01:45] are you with me Amen now now again I
[1:01:49] just want to say you you must not just
[1:01:53] be in the stage of coming into the land
[1:01:58] for the rapture you must be in the
[1:02:02] promised land and the promised land the
[1:02:06] years the Holy Ghost and of course
[1:02:09] that's the same as the word because the
[1:02:12] word in the Holy Ghost is the same so
[1:02:14] you see we must be in the word but that
[1:02:17] is the Holy Ghost we must be in the Holy
[1:02:19] Ghost but that is the word you can't
[1:02:22] have the Holy Ghost not being the word
[1:02:24] and you can't be in the word and not
[1:02:25] have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:27] all right now so you see as we said you
[1:02:32] know those who remain behind outside you
[1:02:36] know looking into the promised land
[1:02:38] just on the stages of the journey into
[1:02:41] the Holy Ghost will not go in the
[1:02:45] rapture then you know where that place
[1:02:48] is you if you're not in the land
[1:02:51] you're not rapture ready amen
[1:02:54] you're gonna have to be in the land
[1:02:56] you're gonna have to be in the Holy
[1:02:58] Ghost now how many would like to go on
[1:03:02] the rapture
[1:03:04] hey ma'am now to do so you're gonna have
[1:03:08] to have more than a portion of the
[1:03:10] Spirit amen you're gonna have to have
[1:03:13] more than a confession of faith and a
[1:03:17] confession of faith is a work of the
[1:03:20] Holy Spirit that leads you to embrace
[1:03:23] the knowledge of Christ and his message
[1:03:25] but it is yet but a portion and
[1:03:29] sanctification which again is a work of
[1:03:32] the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost
[1:03:34] wooing you and calling you and
[1:03:37] convincing you of wrongdoing and and
[1:03:40] tell you you know get rid of this and
[1:03:41] that out of your life you know
[1:03:43] sanctification which again work of the
[1:03:45] Holy Ghost we're by the professor by the
[1:03:50] possessed by the knowledge of the word
[1:03:52] begins to be lost
[1:03:53] it's still just a work of the Holy
[1:03:57] Spirit is the Holy Spirit wooing and
[1:03:59] calling you saying come on in but you're
[1:04:03] not in man you you're making step toward
[1:04:08] it but they're not in the lap a man is
[1:04:11] calling you there but you're not there
[1:04:13] yet
[1:04:14] all right you say brother Tim that's me
[1:04:16] today well I tell you you you've got a
[1:04:18] choice you can take another step toward
[1:04:20] the promised land you can move on in
[1:04:24] come on and then we're calling for
[1:04:26] immigrants to make their allele and then
[1:04:30] that Aliyah means a homecoming to come
[1:04:33] in a rector enough we're going up on
[1:04:36] decision rising higher thoughts calling
[1:04:39] you to make your Aliyah today to come
[1:04:42] into that Promised Land
[1:04:43] come on home come on you're weary those
[1:04:46] that have been distressed those that are
[1:04:49] been cast down those that have been
[1:04:51] abused whatever you are you you know
[1:04:54] come on there there's refuge there is
[1:04:57] peace there is joy there is prosperity
[1:05:01] there
[1:05:02] ever blessing in the homeland come on in
[1:05:06] the homeland that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:05:10] is calling hey ma'am and if you're in
[1:05:13] the homeland then the Holy Spirit is
[1:05:16] calling you take some more of it get
[1:05:19] more than what you got yeah you're there
[1:05:22] you're in the homeland but you know face
[1:05:24] your giants and then take your
[1:05:27] possession are you with me now so so
[1:05:31] again again let's take it one step
[1:05:33] further we talked about confession of
[1:05:35] faith or justification and
[1:05:36] sanctification which is again a work of
[1:05:39] the Holy Ghost I'm a you know but and
[1:05:42] then to be baptized by the spirit that
[1:05:45] one is so overjoyed that they speak in
[1:05:50] other languages is still but a work of
[1:05:54] the Spirit it is not the Holy Ghost it
[1:05:58] is a gift of the Holy Ghost so you don't
[1:06:02] to get to have tongues are you with me
[1:06:05] is there is to receive his gift but
[1:06:09] we're not about receiving a gift today
[1:06:11] we're talking that you must have the
[1:06:14] very person the very life of Christ in
[1:06:17] your life amen now so joy again you know
[1:06:25] that it's two is a portion now person
[1:06:28] can do all of this you mean justified
[1:06:32] and sanctified or
[1:06:33] speak in other tongues and dance and
[1:06:35] shout and still not have the indwelling
[1:06:37] of the Spirit of God you see it's like
[1:06:41] you know conception in the womb is faith
[1:06:45] and the growth of the baby and
[1:06:47] sanctification in the womb but it must
[1:06:50] receive the breath of God again you know
[1:06:54] that the dry bones that I preach them
[1:06:56] out here the other day of you weeks ago
[1:06:58] you know I did just have the sinew bring
[1:07:01] them together or just have the flesh
[1:07:03] come upon them doesn't make them alive
[1:07:06] remember breathe o breath of God breathe
[1:07:09] upon deed that comes
[1:07:11] damn that become a mighty army that's
[1:07:14] what we're preaching about amount of
[1:07:17] people receiving that life so they can
[1:07:20] be a mighty army so you can defeat the
[1:07:26] demons in your life
[1:07:28] hey ma'am you can defeat the demons in
[1:07:32] its pledge of families through the years
[1:07:36] and then you can defeat the enemy and
[1:07:40] you can walk in victory that's what
[1:07:45] that's what our goal is not just to be a
[1:07:47] church but to be a victorious church
[1:07:49] what without spot or wrinkle one that is
[1:07:53] united with him now so person can do all
[1:07:58] of this and not out that indwelling of
[1:08:00] the Spirit of God is like I said like
[1:08:02] conception faith you know that's where
[1:08:04] it's conceived growth of the baby and
[1:08:07] sanctification like in the womb but it's
[1:08:10] got to receive the breath of God and
[1:08:11] being dwell by the spirit and this birth
[1:08:14] is more than a conception in the womb
[1:08:18] it's more than just accepting Jesus as
[1:08:21] your personal Savior and making the
[1:08:22] confession with your mouth and start
[1:08:24] your your belief it's more than
[1:08:27] believing in the saying you know I
[1:08:30] really think the message is right what
[1:08:32] you got the Holy Ghost know you have a
[1:08:34] work of the Holy Spirit that is teaching
[1:08:36] you to believe amen now so the birth
[1:08:42] takes place though when life comes in to
[1:08:46] the soul and overshadows and quickens
[1:08:49] the seed that is in yourself now this is
[1:08:53] why brother Branham would tell you the
[1:08:55] real gift is your soul because if you
[1:08:58] don't have a seed germ of life on the
[1:09:00] inside no matter how much the rain of
[1:09:02] the Holy Spirit comes
[1:09:04] there ain't nothing inside there to
[1:09:05] quicken but praise God I can see people
[1:09:08] right here in this building today that
[1:09:11] have been quickened by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:12] proven there was a seed on the inside of
[1:09:15] them amen now so when this birth takes
[1:09:20] place when light comes into the
[1:09:22] and quickens our and the seed within the
[1:09:26] soul it does it live what life is the
[1:09:29] literal life of Jesus Christ so this is
[1:09:34] what we're preaching about is the age of
[1:09:36] that literal life of Jesus Christ not a
[1:09:41] tongue a gift not a not a cleansing the
[1:09:45] washing of sanctification not a
[1:09:47] justification a giving you of a new set
[1:09:50] of beliefs but more than that the
[1:09:53] receiving of the very life the very life
[1:09:58] that was in Jesus the very spirit that
[1:10:01] was in Jesus comes and indwells you a
[1:10:06] map now of course it starts with faith
[1:10:10] you're not going to get anything from
[1:10:12] God unless you start believing you're
[1:10:16] not only got to believe the Bible said
[1:10:18] he that cometh to God must believe that
[1:10:21] he is a man now why is it important to
[1:10:26] know that he is because if you believe
[1:10:28] he was but not today then you got the
[1:10:31] Holy Ghost yesterday and not today but
[1:10:34] we got to believe that it's for us today
[1:10:36] that he is that he'll keep its word that
[1:10:40] he's ever-present hey man that he's
[1:10:43] right there come on somebody there's a
[1:10:46] man and and that he is a rewarder of
[1:10:49] those that diligently seek Him so if
[1:10:54] you'll seek Him diligently he's going to
[1:10:56] reward you so he that come to God must
[1:10:59] believe that he is and I'm gonna be
[1:11:02] rewarded for believing and the reward
[1:11:05] for believing is receiving his life in
[1:11:07] the mind amen
[1:11:10] now again we we take this back to a
[1:11:15] little statement brother Branham said at
[1:11:17] birth pains
[1:11:18] he said now her messenger is promised in
[1:11:22] Malachi the fourth chapter he promised
[1:11:24] to do it and the message is to bring
[1:11:27] back the word bring the people back to
[1:11:30] the word birth is to be she is to be
[1:11:34] doing
[1:11:34] of a new birth from according to Malachi
[1:11:38] 4 so I want you to understand that the
[1:11:42] new birth of Malachi 4 is something that
[1:11:44] turns the heart hey man it doesn't work
[1:11:50] in the heart not something that you just
[1:11:53] jump about not something you just shout
[1:11:56] about though you may do all of that but
[1:11:59] whatever it does it turns the heart a
[1:12:01] man and when the hardest turn then the
[1:12:06] nature of God is projected toward God
[1:12:09] and for his word amen
[1:12:13] now so the new birth according to
[1:12:15] Malachi 4 it turns a heart away from sin
[1:12:18] and unbelief back to faith and that is
[1:12:22] more than a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:25] that just happens on your spirit round
[1:12:27] then see you're a three-part beat you
[1:12:31] are you have a body you have a spirit
[1:12:34] human spirit and then you have a soul
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:39] now a lot of people get it where is that
[1:12:43] on their spirit and and they jump in the
[1:12:46] shower rejoice because that's where the
[1:12:48] human emotions lay and you can feel the
[1:12:51] Holy Ghost and that causes you to react
[1:12:54] it should cause you to react and I'll
[1:12:56] just say this you know sometimes people
[1:12:59] are worried about getting it on the
[1:13:00] spirit if you don't get it in your
[1:13:01] spirit you'll never get it in yourself
[1:13:04] hey man there's got to come through that
[1:13:07] Inlet and man has got to come to this
[1:13:10] hearing or seeing receiving a man
[1:13:13] through there through the outward man
[1:13:15] into the inward man of the Spirit the
[1:13:18] mind of the other person it must be
[1:13:21] accepted in the womb of the mind and
[1:13:24] then come into the self hey man so you
[1:13:29] see that again it is more than just
[1:13:32] coming down on your spirit round that
[1:13:35] this is what it is so deceiving in this
[1:13:37] age it is because people can actually
[1:13:40] get the Holy Ghost on their spirit
[1:13:43] and their soul remain unchanged this is
[1:13:47] why we could have men like on you know
[1:13:52] hey Alan who could who could cast out
[1:13:55] Devils have a tremendous prayer line and
[1:13:58] many times be drunk on alcohol while he
[1:14:03] is doing this is because if it was it
[1:14:07] could get on his spirit and anointing
[1:14:10] there and there he would pray even for
[1:14:12] the sick and God without her faith and
[1:14:15] the epitope me you know brother Brendan
[1:14:18] said about until he said God would honor
[1:14:21] that faith he said even if I was a
[1:14:23] hypocrite and that's what people don't
[1:14:25] understand a lot of times that God who
[1:14:28] responds to faith for healing it's faith
[1:14:31] and when God sees faith if you're a
[1:14:34] prostitute God will heal you but that
[1:14:39] itself don't save you there's a many
[1:14:40] people get healed that are never saved
[1:14:44] now so you see um again it's more than
[1:14:48] it's more than just something on your
[1:14:51] spirit ground that causes you to even
[1:14:54] make an intellectual response or
[1:14:56] profession to accept and believe you you
[1:15:00] know listen church i was i've watched on
[1:15:03] some films of a billy graham and make an
[1:15:06] altar call what is an anointing Tim
[1:15:12] twenty thousand moved down from the
[1:15:15] stands all in unison coming to accept
[1:15:18] Christ as a personal Savior and you say
[1:15:20] that wasn't anointing that was anointed
[1:15:23] a man wasn't a call of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:27] yes it was a call of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:30] hey ma'am but but again again you know
[1:15:33] they come and only went so far just to
[1:15:36] respond to accept Christ as our personal
[1:15:39] Savior and believe on Him as Lord and
[1:15:43] make a confession with their mouth but
[1:15:46] you see they fail to understand that you
[1:15:49] receive the Holy Ghost not when you
[1:15:51] believe but after you believe
[1:15:54] and that's what a lot of message guys
[1:15:57] had come along and made the same mistake
[1:15:59] they thought by embracing the truth of
[1:16:02] the message and acknowledging the Word
[1:16:04] of God was right and sympathizing with
[1:16:06] in the agreein and magazine yeah it
[1:16:09] makes more sense than anything and I
[1:16:12] know it's right and I know it's the
[1:16:13] truth
[1:16:14] but you see it's gotta be more than that
[1:16:16] it's gotta change it you there's a many
[1:16:22] of our young men that are raised up in
[1:16:25] church can sit on a barstool and out
[1:16:27] debate all of others other people in the
[1:16:30] bar they're not saved they just got
[1:16:33] knowledge and the knowledge didn't give
[1:16:37] them salvation the knowledge just puffed
[1:16:39] them up and they got a little more
[1:16:41] understanding that then the next guy um
[1:16:43] can can even win the debate but they're
[1:16:46] not saying we're not talking about being
[1:16:49] able win debates we're about being saved
[1:16:52] that no debater can take it away from
[1:16:54] you
[1:16:57] hey ma'am now you know you know I'm
[1:17:02] myself I'm not the smartest cookie on
[1:17:04] the tray and there's a lot of men cannot
[1:17:06] argue me here out debate me that doesn't
[1:17:09] mean anything I've got a revelation in
[1:17:11] my heart that the devil can't take away
[1:17:15] that all the arguments and the better
[1:17:18] the better way of presenting something
[1:17:21] can never change my mind I know because
[1:17:23] it happened to me amen I know because
[1:17:28] something changed me now again you see
[1:17:32] it's more than a baptism of the Holy
[1:17:35] Ghost that gives you an intellectual
[1:17:38] response or it's more than an emotional
[1:17:41] response
[1:17:41] rejoicing and shouting and dancing or
[1:17:44] speaking in tongues it's got to be the
[1:17:46] quickening of the sea gene of God that
[1:17:51] turns your life around now this is where
[1:17:57] it is so close that it would receive the
[1:18:01] very life you know where many times
[1:18:04] people are looking out here and saying
[1:18:05] how the Catholics
[1:18:07] they're there so they're not so close it
[1:18:09] would to see the very let the
[1:18:13] denomination they're not so close it
[1:18:15] would deceive the very elect if it were
[1:18:17] possible where is the real deception you
[1:18:21] just put up Matthew 24:24 but remember
[1:18:26] if we remember it so close because we're
[1:18:30] we're in the time we're in the time of
[1:18:33] of the grain and in that stage there's
[1:18:37] another stage they're called the shock
[1:18:39] and it's looked so much like the grain
[1:18:43] that you can mistake it for the grain
[1:18:49] your mouth now but it's the time their
[1:18:53] self-worth so close that people can
[1:18:57] actually sit on message pews and be
[1:19:03] deceived now I'm not trying to I'm not
[1:19:08] trying to shake you I'm not trying to
[1:19:09] remove your anchor I'm trying to get you
[1:19:12] to realize hey you know I I just need to
[1:19:16] move further in God hey Mount Matthew
[1:19:21] 24:24 for there shall arise false
[1:19:24] Christ's now he didn't say false Jesus's
[1:19:27] he says false Christ's Christ means
[1:19:30] Anointed One there shall rise people
[1:19:32] that are anointed now what makes it so
[1:19:36] confusing
[1:19:36] it's just like aaand it he was not
[1:19:39] healing by the devil he was healing by
[1:19:42] the power of Christ so you see they can
[1:19:45] absolutely actually be truly anointed
[1:19:49] but unchanged on the inside they can
[1:19:53] actually speak in genuine Holy Ghost
[1:19:55] tongues and not have the person of
[1:19:58] Christ on the inside they can actually
[1:20:03] prophesy and it come to pass campuses
[1:20:06] did
[1:20:08] amen Balaam did prophesy and he come to
[1:20:13] pass and still be an anointed by the
[1:20:19] true spirit yet be false heed see
[1:20:23] anointed ones at the end time this is
[1:20:27] this is where it gets really really
[1:20:29] tricky I want you to get this now
[1:20:34] because this shut looks so much like the
[1:20:38] grain you we come at this stage where
[1:20:42] there's two parts and one looks so real
[1:20:46] and is not real
[1:20:47] and the other is real grain and it's the
[1:20:53] only one gonna go in the gardener this
[1:20:56] shucks gonna be burned with unquenchable
[1:20:58] fire
[1:20:59] amen and let me just say let me just say
[1:21:02] um there's been many shock city no
[1:21:05] message pews why do you think why do you
[1:21:08] think they pulled away from the grain
[1:21:10] what do you think that went right back
[1:21:12] out into the world what do you think
[1:21:15] that but we made him deacons and
[1:21:17] trustees and preachers and so now they
[1:21:20] deny the message because they look so
[1:21:24] real that it was so difficult to tell
[1:21:28] him apart that churches would even elect
[1:21:31] them as the Deacons in the church this
[1:21:34] look like the most spiritual one above
[1:21:36] us and all they were was a shock amen
[1:21:43] now I know you're thinking this is
[1:21:46] really hard but you know let me let me
[1:21:49] do say in the natural the shuck can
[1:21:51] never become the grain but in the
[1:21:54] spiritual if you're shucked this morning
[1:21:56] you can become grace amen
[1:22:01] you you may have been a cane all your
[1:22:05] life and man you may have been a Judas
[1:22:08] in a betrayer but today you can change
[1:22:11] to be a son of God
[1:22:15] hey ma'am as exactly right it meant so
[1:22:20] you know maybe - maybe you know even
[1:22:23] Kane was given an opportunity and we
[1:22:25] were given err we're holding everybody
[1:22:28] else out an opportunity don't they they
[1:22:31] you say well brother Jim them people
[1:22:33] when they left they blaspheme will Paul
[1:22:34] said I blaspheme Dan I persecuted so we
[1:22:38] don't ever give up on anybody we say
[1:22:41] who's ever will let him come you and
[1:22:44] repent come on a man the spirit beings
[1:22:47] come come on get in get in the arms of
[1:22:50] safety I don't care you man for years
[1:22:53] through your Tomatoes no I'm for years
[1:22:56] you through your dropping eggs you
[1:22:58] slandered and you did all of that but
[1:23:00] whatever put a ballot get in the ark he
[1:23:08] said why are you preaching that way
[1:23:10] because many of you have got loved ones
[1:23:12] that are out there that have done
[1:23:13] exactly that and I'm giving you some
[1:23:16] hope for them you said why would you
[1:23:20] give them hope because God does theirs
[1:23:24] example after example a man of wavered
[1:23:27] men and women prodigal sons and then
[1:23:31] that went out and wasted it all and God
[1:23:34] brought him back here in spite of us and
[1:23:37] I'm gonna tell you I'm not gonna be an
[1:23:39] older son that sits around and criticize
[1:23:42] I'm gonna be one of those that said
[1:23:44] let's have a party let's have a
[1:23:46] celebration
[1:23:47] let the children I don't know
[1:24:00] I don't know you kill the fatted calf
[1:24:04] come on home children I believe we got a
[1:24:08] fatted calf right here
[1:24:12] so well the chapters all burn well you
[1:24:16] know said well that's all in
[1:24:17] denominators everyone I'm out there
[1:24:19] they're gonna be burned now there's some
[1:24:21] of them that are saved for a different
[1:24:24] purpose they may be outside of the city
[1:24:26] and the New Jerusalem to come but they
[1:24:28] will be there
[1:24:30] amen don't listen to quit trying to play
[1:24:34] God and put people in and out
[1:24:36] just just let God be God let God making
[1:24:39] their decisions and you do what the
[1:24:42] bride does the spirit and the bride say
[1:24:44] come and whoever is thirsty come and
[1:24:47] drink of the water of life freely so you
[1:24:51] let not be God and you be bride any man
[1:24:55] causes fear and the bride will say come
[1:24:57] a man that's what gives me hope that's
[1:25:02] why I can preach service after service
[1:25:04] knowing some of you are backslidden some
[1:25:07] of you are rebellious some of you are
[1:25:09] you know are just barely hanging on but
[1:25:12] I always hope this will be the service
[1:25:16] that today will be the day and then
[1:25:20] today could be your day
[1:25:22] will you come all the way into the land
[1:25:25] where there's an Aliyah for you where
[1:25:27] there's a celebration and there's a
[1:25:30] bunch of brothers and sisters right in
[1:25:32] here that's a come on in come on in this
[1:25:35] promised land cut off I found that's
[1:25:37] what I proved for you there from that
[1:25:39] root ball and we can't go the Messiah
[1:25:44] can't come until every one of his as in
[1:25:46] the land
[1:25:53] hallelujah
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:57] hey man that's what I would do I would
[1:26:01] say amen to that
[1:26:03] I'd say Amen from my loved one for my
[1:26:06] brother for my sister for my children
[1:26:09] for my children's children and man
[1:26:11] whereas many are is a far off how far
[1:26:13] they stray I would say do it
[1:26:16] Soviet God right here in this land there
[1:26:26] be a revival and a place prepared to
[1:26:29] receive those wayward women that they
[1:26:31] can come in and find grace and mercy
[1:26:33] [Applause]
[1:26:42] hallelujah Mathew 24:24 that's Christ
[1:26:50] now thoughts I know anyone so know
[1:26:53] anyone now a lot of people get that off
[1:26:55] you know messed up because we read the
[1:26:58] title to false anointed ones at the end
[1:27:01] time that brother Branham would tell us
[1:27:02] in that sermon the anointing is true so
[1:27:06] it's it's really anointed false ones
[1:27:10] true anointed false ones a man the
[1:27:15] anointing is true now quit making fun of
[1:27:19] the anointing out there you know while
[1:27:25] I'm here it just struck me quit making
[1:27:27] fun of the anointing out there yeah you
[1:27:31] don't people people to say well you know
[1:27:33] all these people and these praise and
[1:27:36] worship songs and they're all about love
[1:27:39] and they seem sensual what do you
[1:27:41] think's going on there's a marriage of
[1:27:43] the Lamb there's a bride and a groom
[1:27:45] coming together it's the time of a love
[1:27:48] affair
[1:27:49] don't make fun of the anointing they are
[1:27:53] catching listen those are gifts those
[1:27:57] are gifts and God even gives gifts to
[1:28:00] the rebellious and they can operate I'm
[1:28:03] going to give my ala ala did and they
[1:28:05] can sing even wrong songs and come back
[1:28:08] and get anointed and write us a
[1:28:11] wonderful song like that song that I
[1:28:14] heard when I was just an 11 year old boy
[1:28:17] set on the edge of my seat in Shreveport
[1:28:20] Louisiana and here brother Brandon write
[1:28:22] us another verse to a secular song a
[1:28:26] country hit high on the pop charts a
[1:28:31] contemporary song are you with me and
[1:28:36] been popular out there where everybody
[1:28:39] had popularized it now since 1958 on the
[1:28:42] wings of a snow white dove and see the
[1:28:45] Holy Spirit come down and write another
[1:28:47] verse to it where did they get the
[1:28:50] inspiration because as we're going to be
[1:28:52] a part out
[1:29:04] take a drunk man a drunken rebellious
[1:29:08] man all his life one day break into an
[1:29:13] anointing write a song I saw the light
[1:29:18] he wrote it under that moment of
[1:29:22] catching a glimpse of light went right
[1:29:23] back out into darkness we sing songs
[1:29:29] like pledge allegiance to the lamb turn
[1:29:34] around and God turns around becomes a
[1:29:36] homosexual denies everything how in the
[1:29:40] world could he write such an inspired
[1:29:42] song anointed don't call the anointing
[1:29:46] false the anointing is true is the
[1:29:50] person's as fault and don't tell me we
[1:29:53] we can't sing those songs and worship to
[1:29:56] God because they are our love songs back
[1:30:00] to Christ amen and if you get in love
[1:30:04] with Jesus you what happen problems with
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:12] you start pouring out your heart empresa
[1:30:15] was about so amen now which in how can
[1:30:24] overcome brother branham said we see
[1:30:28] this age that we're living in it's one
[1:30:31] of the grandest ages of all age now for
[1:30:36] I go on I want you to understand I don't
[1:30:38] put a stamp of approval and leave a song
[1:30:40] this out there hey ma'am I think I think
[1:30:44] it's got to be under some holy ghost
[1:30:46] leadership and I believe we have it at
[1:30:49] this church but we see this age that
[1:30:54] we're living in it's one of the grandes
[1:30:56] ages of all ages this Laodicean Church
[1:31:00] age is the grandest of all the church
[1:31:03] ages because it's the ending of time and
[1:31:05] the blending of eternity and then now
[1:31:09] here
[1:31:09] it's the grandest because ages are
[1:31:14] indignant and an eternity is blending
[1:31:19] amen and this Laodicean age grandis of
[1:31:23] all ages is the climax age is the final
[1:31:26] age God won't speak in another age so if
[1:31:29] you got another age God ain't speaking
[1:31:31] there because this is the last voice
[1:31:32] this is the amount of God this isn't
[1:31:35] finished this is a finality if you don't
[1:31:37] get it by the seventh angels message
[1:31:40] you're not going to get it so again then
[1:31:47] it is the greatest sinful age the
[1:31:53] grandest blending of time and eternity
[1:31:57] the one who receives the greatest
[1:31:59] rewards brother Branham said of all the
[1:32:01] other agents Laodicea and yet the
[1:32:07] greatest sinful age it's more sin in
[1:32:09] this age then there's ever been and the
[1:32:13] powers of Satan is many times harder to
[1:32:15] fight against then it wasn't any age see
[1:32:18] here back in the earlier ages of
[1:32:21] Christian good for his profession of an
[1:32:24] immature
[1:32:24] I belong in the Christ could be beheaded
[1:32:27] for it he can be killed and put out of
[1:32:30] his misery and go to meet God quickly
[1:32:32] you know again you know early age
[1:32:35] just make a you know just professor's
[1:32:38] name you can be killed for it
[1:32:40] but now the enemy has come in in the
[1:32:44] name of the church and it's so deceiving
[1:32:48] this is the great age of deception when
[1:32:51] Christ said so the two spirits would be
[1:32:54] so close in the last days till it would
[1:32:57] deceive their very intellect if it was
[1:32:59] possible remember Christ spoke of an
[1:33:02] elected people for the last days say it
[1:33:05] would deceive the very elect if it was
[1:33:07] possible aren't you glad you spoke about
[1:33:09] an elected people in the last days here
[1:33:12] we are mama that's me that elected
[1:33:17] people a man and I would be deceived by
[1:33:19] if it were possible but you see with
[1:33:23] this personal life of Christ you can't
[1:33:26] be to see because this bride is going to
[1:33:30] be different from what Eve was she will
[1:33:33] not be to see a man the people now
[1:33:42] here's where it comes down it is so
[1:33:44] close the people so live people can live
[1:33:49] a clean holy life and not be sinful
[1:33:53] adulterers and drinkers and liars and
[1:33:56] gamblers and they can and they can live
[1:34:01] above that and still not with it oh my
[1:34:04] goodness brother Tim you mean a people
[1:34:06] that live a clean holy life they're just
[1:34:09] really good people and they're not
[1:34:12] sinful like being adulterers yeah man
[1:34:15] this guy he's faithful to his wife you
[1:34:17] know um it drinkers he wouldn't touch
[1:34:20] alcohol wires he's just as honest he
[1:34:24] could be so squeaky clean gamblers
[1:34:27] wouldn't be that you won't catch him
[1:34:29] down at casinos they can live above that
[1:34:33] and still not with it and then he says
[1:34:38] this is the age of life personal life of
[1:34:42] Christ that's where I got my title a man
[1:34:46] that were the chemical of his body what
[1:34:48] was in him first under justification the
[1:34:51] water baptism second under the new birth
[1:34:54] of Wesley's sanctification which
[1:34:55] cleanses thirdly under the baptism of
[1:34:58] the Holy Spirit putting that sanctified
[1:35:00] vessel into service the word sanctify
[1:35:02] means is a compound Greek word with
[1:35:05] means cleaned and set aside for service
[1:35:08] set aside for service now the Holy
[1:35:11] Spirit puts it in service and will
[1:35:16] notice when the whole when the unclean
[1:35:17] spirit is going from a man he walks in
[1:35:20] dry places that's exactly what the
[1:35:22] church is done that's exactly what the
[1:35:26] church is done Baptist Methodist those
[1:35:28] who believe in st. vacation that Jesus
[1:35:30] said the unclean spirit went out returns
[1:35:33] back into this church body and finds a
[1:35:35] house garnished and swept clean and
[1:35:37] living pure and clean lives but then if
[1:35:40] that house isn't field occupied then he
[1:35:45] comes in with seven other evils demons
[1:35:47] worse than he was and the last stage of
[1:35:51] the mud this place is seven times worse
[1:35:53] than it was in the first place they'd
[1:35:56] have been better to say Luzerne than to
[1:35:58] receive that light and failed to follow
[1:36:01] it so will the Pentecostals see you know
[1:36:04] what I mean the house is garnished so
[1:36:10] again so close now
[1:36:13] the devil comes in and they're live so
[1:36:16] clean holy church members and still
[1:36:21] unsaved and the message investment he
[1:36:27] took it a little further he said a
[1:36:29] beautiful picture jesus said when when
[1:36:32] the unclean spirit is coming out of the
[1:36:35] man did you notice he never said when
[1:36:37] he's cast out of a man but when he goes
[1:36:40] out by his own will when the unclean
[1:36:43] spirit is going out of a man and
[1:36:45] it turns back to this man and finds the
[1:36:47] house that he's lived in has been swept
[1:36:50] and garnished and he goes and gets seven
[1:36:52] other devils and demons unclean spirits
[1:36:55] and innocent to this man and the last
[1:36:57] fate of this man is seven times worse
[1:37:00] than it was at the verse did you notice
[1:37:03] the devil went out by his own will and
[1:37:06] he returned by his own will you know
[1:37:13] this is what brother Branham would say
[1:37:14] Satan don't care how right you are in
[1:37:19] your doctor as long as you miss sabbith
[1:37:31] so he'll even let you sit on a message
[1:37:34] pew all right a mite he'll he'll let you
[1:37:43] just even come right down the place and
[1:37:45] the devil go out by his own will and
[1:37:47] come back with seven more and you become
[1:37:50] a religious person just religious and
[1:37:56] you'll watch them a lot of times these
[1:37:57] are time bombs that are just about you
[1:37:59] know they may go 10 years and all of a
[1:38:00] sudden they explode they're like a
[1:38:03] terrace let us assail sitting right
[1:38:06] there in the church and then they
[1:38:07] explode here goes you know there are
[1:38:09] dull trees and I thought that man
[1:38:11] oh he sang in the choir my goodness he
[1:38:13] was a a preacher he did this and he
[1:38:16] explodes and how many does he take down
[1:38:18] with him we've seen it time on time
[1:38:26] again hey man it's a very picture
[1:38:30] beautiful picture of a moralist as we
[1:38:33] would think of today a man that tries to
[1:38:35] think he's going to heaven just because
[1:38:37] he couldn't gamblin or even maybe quit
[1:38:39] running with women that wasn't his wife
[1:38:41] or stopped his drinking on New Year's
[1:38:44] Day and turned over a new leaf and
[1:38:45] joined the church you see he doesn't he
[1:38:48] really isn't converted he's just a more
[1:38:51] or less and the devil he's using more or
[1:38:53] less just to go out and make a foolish
[1:38:55] representation
[1:38:56] when really the real power of the Living
[1:38:59] Christ isn't there so this is what we
[1:39:04] want to have is that the real power of
[1:39:06] the Living Christ not just church
[1:39:09] members
[1:39:11] hey ma'am the world is wanting to see
[1:39:16] Christ Jesus said I'm the vine you are
[1:39:20] the branches and the branch bears record
[1:39:22] of the vine because it draws its energy
[1:39:25] and life from the vine still reading
[1:39:28] from investments well the first vine
[1:39:30] first branch came from this vine they
[1:39:32] wrote a book of Acts behind that branch
[1:39:35] we see the way the Holy Spirit acted in
[1:39:38] that first church and that church of
[1:39:40] Pentecost and then when we believe that
[1:39:43] if this original vine that ever puts
[1:39:46] forth another branch they'll write
[1:39:47] another book of Acts behind it because
[1:39:50] it's the same life that's in the vine
[1:39:53] and if the first branch put forth a
[1:39:56] bunch of grapes and then we find it out
[1:39:58] here that's got watermelons growing on
[1:40:01] it and pumpkins and cucumbers we know it
[1:40:04] isn't the life that was in the vine
[1:40:05] therefore I think even where we would
[1:40:08] call ourselves Pentecostals have failed
[1:40:11] to represent the real thing that Christ
[1:40:15] has set forth for us to represent the
[1:40:18] Holy Spirit and the life of that spirit
[1:40:21] see we sometimes we represent sometimes
[1:40:24] sensations and we represents joy and
[1:40:27] that's good but there's more to it than
[1:40:30] that there's a fruit that goes with it
[1:40:32] that hungry man is looking for this
[1:40:35] fruit of the Spirit and this is a
[1:40:37] quality that was in Jesus so we want the
[1:40:41] same quality that was in Jesus to be in
[1:40:44] us
[1:40:46] his life on display that's why brother
[1:40:49] Brandon when he preaches the message
[1:40:50] token he said that token to be effective
[1:40:54] must be on display hey Matt what is the
[1:41:00] token is too literal I'm the Christ his
[1:41:03] life must be on discipline now you see
[1:41:07] it takes more than an anointing or
[1:41:10] baptism on your human spirit you can
[1:41:14] have that and this is what brother
[1:41:15] Brandon would so confuse people
[1:41:17] especially the Pentecostals who relying
[1:41:20] on speaking in tongues he's you know he
[1:41:22] said you can have that every day of your
[1:41:24] life and still be lost but when the Holy
[1:41:30] Ghost comes in your soul it becomes your
[1:41:33] nature and we're looking for the life of
[1:41:38] Christ to be on display you said what am
[1:41:42] I looking for brother Tim you know to
[1:41:44] jump well you know you don't make you
[1:41:47] jump but there's a lot of people jumping
[1:41:49] gotta know hey man hey shout yeah it'll
[1:41:53] make you shout but a lot of people
[1:41:55] shouting ain't got a thing some are
[1:41:57] shouting to get it then you know the
[1:41:59] shout to get it you shout cuz you got it
[1:42:03] amen now certainly certainly you know
[1:42:07] you've got to yield to the spirit not
[1:42:09] saying that you've got to yield to the
[1:42:11] spirit you got you've got to invite the
[1:42:13] Holy Spirit to come into your life do a
[1:42:15] work hey ma'am but but you see what are
[1:42:19] we looking for that fruit that that
[1:42:22] evidence that he's there because his
[1:42:24] life is there and you can get in on your
[1:42:29] spirit every day of your life and still
[1:42:30] be lost but that Holy Ghost must come
[1:42:34] into your soul and become your nature
[1:42:38] and so we're looking for his life to be
[1:42:41] on display now of course you know if his
[1:42:45] life is on display you can't deny any
[1:42:47] word he cannot then I'm self see you
[1:42:51] can't have the Holy Ghost and deny his
[1:42:53] word you can't have the Holy Ghost and
[1:42:55] say don't speak in tongues no more
[1:42:57] you can't have the Holy Ghost and say
[1:42:59] days of miracles are past you can't have
[1:43:01] the Holy Ghost and cut your hair and
[1:43:02] paint your face you just came he said
[1:43:07] well I believe the message do you
[1:43:09] apparently don't you still may use a
[1:43:10] makeup so you don't believe if you
[1:43:13] believe we'd show the actions you see
[1:43:16] here your actions would would would
[1:43:18] actually demonstrate what you really
[1:43:20] believe and it wouldn't be a struggle on
[1:43:22] the inside it would be a change of
[1:43:24] nature it'd be a desire to please God so
[1:43:27] well I don't understand that you
[1:43:29] wouldn't even have to understand it all
[1:43:31] you have to know is God said this and
[1:43:37] that's good enough for me but I
[1:43:39] understand it or not why how come it
[1:43:42] doesn't really matter he said it you see
[1:43:51] what we're looking for is the deity of
[1:43:54] Christ to come in you not a profession
[1:43:57] of faith not quit drilling quit smoking
[1:44:00] or drinking or you know reform here and
[1:44:02] there and straighten up here and there
[1:44:04] and we're looking for that of course
[1:44:06] we're looking for you to believe on
[1:44:07] Christ - we're looking for forever ever
[1:44:10] promised God house but what we're
[1:44:12] looking for is his life to be on display
[1:44:17] amen
[1:44:18] so in the deity of Christ you just go
[1:44:21] right back to that fundamental message
[1:44:23] all the way back to 49 brother
[1:44:26] Brenneman's adamant about this from the
[1:44:28] beginning all the way down to the end
[1:44:31] but he said that is God the Creator
[1:44:33] living in you and give you all the
[1:44:36] powers and you're in possession of
[1:44:39] anything that he had so it is so it is
[1:44:44] so is it in you to abstain from evil to
[1:44:48] do good to shun evil and to flee to
[1:44:50] righteousness to turn away from
[1:44:53] temptation all malice hatred strife envy
[1:44:58] and so forth
[1:44:59] turn away from it for that to take him
[1:45:01] from your heart
[1:45:02] if you receive him embrace him love him
[1:45:05] hold him in your heart and love
[1:45:07] I can tell you the church together in
[1:45:10] that kind of a power has the power to
[1:45:13] bind the heavens heal the sick open the
[1:45:16] eyes of the blind hallelujah that that
[1:45:18] dumb to speak and the depth to hear the
[1:45:21] cripples to walk and the blind to see
[1:45:23] why it's recognizing the power of
[1:45:26] Almighty God into your heart there he is
[1:45:28] the deity hey man
[1:45:32] now the whole point the whole point in
[1:45:37] all of this teaching that brother
[1:45:39] Branham does about adoption and then he
[1:45:42] appreciably hidden life with Christ and
[1:45:44] the outer veiled in turmoil and the most
[1:45:46] holy and all these the whole point the
[1:45:50] whole point is he's trying to get
[1:45:51] everybody to understand you must come to
[1:45:54] full turn you must receive it and that's
[1:45:59] fullness parcel isn't good enough
[1:46:02] so adder bail isn't good enough
[1:46:04] Intervale isn't good enough you got to
[1:46:06] come into the Holies of Holies but come
[1:46:09] into that a little more again
[1:46:11] you recumbent I'm starting from infancy
[1:46:14] and learn and then being under the tutor
[1:46:17] of the Holy Ghost and finally come to
[1:46:19] adoption once this point the hosts point
[1:46:21] is full term God wants his church to
[1:46:25] come into his fullness not partial
[1:46:29] fullness hey man so brother dim this is
[1:46:34] so elementary well I'll tell you what
[1:46:35] you get the you get the fullness you'll
[1:46:37] love elementary sermons like this I'm
[1:46:42] not you won't be sitting up there puffed
[1:46:45] up with knowledge and said we know all
[1:46:47] of this you'll be saying Lord God pour
[1:46:49] out even more amen so you know the whole
[1:46:54] point has come to full time whether the
[1:46:57] type is water blood and spirit remember
[1:46:59] that's the three stages of the new birth
[1:47:01] water blood spirit you know there that's
[1:47:04] an the natural birth is a type of the
[1:47:07] spiritual birth these three elements of
[1:47:09] the birth filter coming from emphysema
[1:47:13] adoption once again full-term
[1:47:17] that's the whole point of the whole
[1:47:18] thing coming from the outer court today
[1:47:21] enter court to the most holy coming from
[1:47:23] all the way full turn alright so using
[1:47:27] either either the type of water blood
[1:47:30] and spirit or using the allegory of a
[1:47:33] child coming to adoption the whole
[1:47:35] inferences is coming to full turn now
[1:47:40] I'm going to explain something to you
[1:47:43] this is Sunday morning and I'm going to
[1:47:46] just take a moment and explain a couple
[1:47:48] of things to you about types we in this
[1:47:53] message we use a lot of types types are
[1:47:56] okay as long as they make the same point
[1:47:59] the Prophet makes a man we come to a
[1:48:04] different conclusion brother Branham
[1:48:05] then brother Branham had or the Bible
[1:48:07] has with him we or we come to wrong
[1:48:09] conclusions because you can type
[1:48:12] yourself right out of the Word of God
[1:48:14] and people are doing it but but being
[1:48:18] that we're talking about adoption outer
[1:48:20] court enter court most holy all these
[1:48:22] are types water blood and spirit it's a
[1:48:27] type the natural types the spiritual now
[1:48:33] but you can't mix the types you got to
[1:48:39] keep them running correctly and you got
[1:48:42] to know exactly how to apply them let's
[1:48:45] just take the life of Abraham for a
[1:48:47] moment Abraham is a perfect type brother
[1:48:50] branham said perfect type of the bride
[1:48:52] so he also divine calls that's
[1:48:55] justification then he comes to the blood
[1:48:58] altar where he teaches him how to
[1:48:59] worship that sanctification he teaches a
[1:49:02] a comes and brings him to else a di and
[1:49:05] and on to you know God standing in a
[1:49:10] human flesh Elohim discerning the heart
[1:49:13] the thoughts and intents of Sarah's
[1:49:14] heart in the body change so you see we
[1:49:17] can see we can type in the life of
[1:49:19] Abraham all the way from justification
[1:49:22] the change of our bodies is everybody
[1:49:25] with me come all the way from them from
[1:49:27] justification believing on the Lord
[1:49:29] to to sanctification the God a blood
[1:49:32] altar to El Shaddai aya the drinking
[1:49:35] from the breast of God and then all the
[1:49:37] way to the change of our body type it
[1:49:40] all the way but after Abraham you know
[1:49:44] is changed and Sarah is a young woman
[1:49:49] Abraham lies now let's take it a little
[1:49:55] further not only does he lie but after
[1:50:00] after Sarah is changed she dies
[1:50:05] now then not only does that happen but
[1:50:08] then Isaac and then Abraham or they will
[1:50:13] go up to Mount Moriah and Abraham has
[1:50:15] the hardest trial of his life you mean
[1:50:16] to tell me that after we're justified
[1:50:20] sanctified baptisms upon baptized with
[1:50:22] the Holy Ghost and our bodies are
[1:50:24] changed and we've received the promised
[1:50:25] son and after that we go through the
[1:50:28] hardest change of our life and we're
[1:50:29] still lying and still dying no that's
[1:50:34] not true you you've taken your type too
[1:50:37] far you gotta know in the beginning when
[1:50:39] the end it for to work properly
[1:50:43] it's a type a type is a shadow a shadow
[1:50:47] doesn't tell all the details it just
[1:50:51] gives you an idea of what's coming hey
[1:50:54] man
[1:50:54] sometimes a shadow can actually look
[1:50:56] like you've got like right now I can see
[1:50:58] almost 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 I don't have nine
[1:51:03] fingers but I can see that many because
[1:51:06] the way the lights hitting it so you've
[1:51:09] got to know when to begin your type and
[1:51:11] what what out of that type to take to
[1:51:14] make it work right all right now then
[1:51:17] now then you can't mix types now let's
[1:51:21] get this lesson in tight over with so
[1:51:23] did you get it you can't mix the types
[1:51:25] you got to keep your types running in
[1:51:28] the line together are you with me for
[1:51:30] example brother Branham would type the
[1:51:33] bride as a virgin who is going to a
[1:51:36] wedding and and he would type her
[1:51:40] a virgin bride going to a great wedding
[1:51:43] in disguise you can find this in the
[1:51:46] quotes he would also type the bride and
[1:51:50] it's more often that he would use this
[1:51:52] type but he would type the bride errs
[1:51:53] married and already pregnant with his
[1:51:58] life and then going away to a wedding
[1:52:02] supper in the skies already having
[1:52:05] conceived the life all right
[1:52:08] now that's good both types are wonderful
[1:52:12] their truths but don't mix this type or
[1:52:15] you have a bride who is unmarried and
[1:52:18] already pregnant none of it married
[1:52:22] so you either type it this way or type
[1:52:25] it that way but you don't mix the types
[1:52:27] all right now the same here we got two
[1:52:31] types about the new birth we have water
[1:52:34] blood and spirit it constitutes a
[1:52:36] full-term birth is that right so the
[1:52:40] whole idea is full-term
[1:52:42] what's ours it come into full turn
[1:52:45] coming to maturity coming to life and
[1:52:49] then the other type is adoption which we
[1:52:53] were reading about here in Galatians and
[1:52:55] that is advancement of a childhood
[1:52:58] adulthood and they're both talking about
[1:53:00] the same thing that means they you know
[1:53:04] coming from two adoption is the same as
[1:53:06] advancing from the infant beginning to
[1:53:10] meet the conditions of adulthood and
[1:53:13] becoming a full-fledged son so the whole
[1:53:16] ideas full turn a man so now again again
[1:53:24] full term now we got two types we got
[1:53:26] water blood and spirit and then it it
[1:53:29] brings us to the full type of the
[1:53:32] fullness the Holy Ghost coming in its
[1:53:35] fullness you're full born child a man so
[1:53:39] this is showing you football God lies
[1:53:42] this other I here is starting in its
[1:53:46] infancy and coming to football or
[1:53:48] full-fledged God lies
[1:53:51] but you don't mix the types or else you
[1:53:56] are handing a baby an infant baby a set
[1:54:01] of keys and say son go run the car
[1:54:04] because you're mixing two types but if
[1:54:08] you keep on running correctly how many's
[1:54:10] understanding me now did you come to
[1:54:13] both them are reaching the same
[1:54:15] conclusion coming to full term coming to
[1:54:20] fullness hey man this is what he was
[1:54:22] doing with a the very thing you are
[1:54:26] using the type of the of the inner court
[1:54:30] our court most holy come into bonus
[1:54:32] coming it coming to the completion now
[1:54:36] so again this is these have got to be
[1:54:40] defended right or else you get the whole
[1:54:43] I too confused so well you're saying I'm
[1:54:46] adopted when I get the Holy Ghost and
[1:54:48] and I'm a baby
[1:54:49] no you using the type you're not a baby
[1:54:53] when you receive the Holy Ghost you're a
[1:54:55] full-glitz son will fled son now
[1:54:59] operating as the Son of God and this is
[1:55:02] what he was saying when you receive the
[1:55:04] spirit you are no more a servant a child
[1:55:08] but now you are a son I'm operating in
[1:55:13] the kingdom of God this is Bible the way
[1:55:16] Paul used adoption now now how do you
[1:55:20] come to full term when or when using the
[1:55:25] type of the three stages of the birth
[1:55:27] water and blood and the spirit how do
[1:55:30] you how do you accomplish that well the
[1:55:32] same way Peter told us in acts 2:38
[1:55:34] repent every one of you be baptized in
[1:55:37] the name of Jesus Christ you shall
[1:55:38] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[1:55:41] how do you come to the whole time acts
[1:55:42] 2:38 hey Matt now how do we get adopted
[1:55:46] or place his sons and the promised land
[1:55:48] of the Holy Ghost same way Peter told us
[1:55:51] same thing amen repent be baptized every
[1:55:55] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:55:57] for remission of sin and
[1:55:59] I receive the gift of the Holy Ghost hey
[1:56:01] man so it's the same way the church at
[1:56:04] Pentecost was fully empowered adopted
[1:56:09] church were the abstract of the title
[1:56:12] deed but was chosen to be planted as a
[1:56:15] seed
[1:56:16] whereas this mature grain and our day is
[1:56:20] going to be raptured or taken into the
[1:56:22] garner that's the only difference you
[1:56:27] say well we had the seals brother Tim
[1:56:29] well yeah we had the sealed but they
[1:56:31] didn't need the seals it wasn't sealed
[1:56:33] to them you tell me tell me one one to
[1:56:38] one fundamental doctrine a man that
[1:56:40] would that power that we preach that
[1:56:42] Paul didn't preach and man what was this
[1:56:48] about the seven seals it was it was
[1:56:51] showing us how we got off track and
[1:56:54] bringing us back to what Paul preached
[1:56:57] not an inner gospel that same gospel
[1:57:01] because it would preaching another
[1:57:03] gospel we're cursed like I said you know
[1:57:12] when we're starting to come to
[1:57:13] conclusions today the lamb has left the
[1:57:16] mercy seed and there's no more
[1:57:17] intercessor and he's no longer the high
[1:57:20] priest and the blood you know is not
[1:57:24] needed and there's no need for a
[1:57:25] sacrifice that is a lie and it's not
[1:57:29] what Paul preached and everyone who
[1:57:32] believes that increases that is accursed
[1:57:34] and the only way to come out from under
[1:57:38] that curse has come out of that unbelief
[1:57:39] because that's what it is now
[1:57:43] so again brother Branham would would
[1:57:46] would preach on something and and and he
[1:57:49] would preface this scripture we're going
[1:57:52] to look back at Galatians 4 and verse 4
[1:57:55] and and he would he would preface this
[1:57:58] by saying now comes our triumphal
[1:58:01] capstone on the baptism with the Holy
[1:58:05] Ghost
[1:58:05] so here brother Branham laying it down
[1:58:08] here's our triumphal caps
[1:58:11] on the baptism with the Holy Ghost and
[1:58:14] he reads from glaces for for but when
[1:58:18] the fullness of time was come God sent
[1:58:21] forth his son made of a woman made under
[1:58:25] the law to redeem them that were under
[1:58:27] the law that we might receive the
[1:58:30] adoption and son and because you are
[1:58:34] sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[1:58:37] his son into your hearts crying Abba
[1:58:40] Father whereby wherefore thou art no
[1:58:44] more a servant but a son and if a son
[1:58:47] then an heir of God through Christ so
[1:58:51] notice the adoption that is God sending
[1:58:55] forth the spirit of his son Jesus Christ
[1:58:58] the Holy Ghost in your heart then that
[1:59:02] makes you recognize God is your father
[1:59:06] yea man this is this is your new birth
[1:59:10] and man when you recognize God is your
[1:59:13] father Galatians 4:1 let's look at that
[1:59:16] scripture again now let's say that the
[1:59:18] heir as long as he's a child he differs
[1:59:22] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[1:59:25] of all notice child servant child
[1:59:28] servant child servant as long as he's a
[1:59:32] child he's a servant he is not in
[1:59:35] sonship as long as he is a child not but
[1:59:41] notice this once the Holy Ghost is
[1:59:44] coming to come by God sending forth the
[1:59:47] spirit of his son in your heart what's
[1:59:49] that happen look at verse 7 now
[1:59:51] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[1:59:57] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[2:00:00] through Christ hallelujah so once the
[2:00:05] Holy Spirit comes in your tallulah
[2:00:08] servant you're a full-fledged son
[2:00:12] you've got the adopted robe you've got
[2:00:15] the father's approval you got is ring on
[2:00:17] your finger you can do whatever you bind
[2:00:20] is bound whatever you hire is hired
[2:00:23] whatever you fire is fired what have you
[2:00:26] cast up Kevin stands behind you you are
[2:00:29] a son of God with authority from God
[2:00:36] hey man there it is I'm gonna quote from
[2:00:41] the church age book Jesus Christ came
[2:00:44] forth died upon the cross an accomplice
[2:00:48] Redemption restored to original owner by
[2:00:51] the means of a purchase and paying the
[2:00:54] price
[2:00:54] and thereby placed us his sons he did
[2:00:58] not make us sons because we were already
[2:01:00] his sons but he placed us as sons notice
[2:01:03] the Holy Ghost is placing you into the
[2:01:07] land place and you into the body they
[2:01:11] man placed us this is why brother
[2:01:14] Brandon would say he would place you as
[2:01:16] a preacher I meant like cuz you really
[2:01:19] can't to preach till the Holy Ghost
[2:01:21] comes and man this is what positions you
[2:01:26] as a son or daughter of God a man so
[2:01:29] when the Holy Ghost comes he did not
[2:01:31] make us sons for we were already his
[2:01:33] sons but he places his sons for as long
[2:01:36] as we were in the world in the flesh we
[2:01:38] cannot be recognized as his sons we were
[2:01:43] held captive by the devil now really
[2:01:47] let's get something straight
[2:01:49] you didn't really become a son when you
[2:01:52] made a profession of faith no that's not
[2:01:57] when you become as you always were a son
[2:02:01] you were son before the world began you
[2:02:06] shouted as the stars of God you rejoiced
[2:02:10] he saw you in his mind rejoicing right
[2:02:15] here in time rejoicing over the enemy he
[2:02:18] saw you doing just what you're doing
[2:02:20] right there
[2:02:21] brother David James Ray's on your hands
[2:02:23] and st. glory to God you were there and
[2:02:26] you're here doing what he saw you do in
[2:02:29] eternity
[2:02:32] hallelujah amen so therefore when you
[2:02:35] recognize the very word of God was eagle
[2:02:37] who you heard from your theophany you
[2:02:39] heard from what he saw of you before the
[2:02:43] world began and you are only here in
[2:02:45] time doing what you did in eternity and
[2:02:51] by the way you were predestinated unto
[2:02:54] adoption and he set your destiny to
[2:02:59] receive the Holy Ghost to receive his
[2:03:02] nature for the Holy Spirit to come in
[2:03:05] your heart whereby you cry Abba Father
[2:03:09] Abba it's just say arabic word for
[2:03:12] father's father father my father my god
[2:03:18] when yous out in the world sports was
[2:03:20] your god women was your God men were
[2:03:23] your God Hollywood was your God you had
[2:03:25] many gods but here when you come into
[2:03:27] this lamb we have one Lord one God one
[2:03:32] father in this land we don't have many
[2:03:35] gods we have one God hey Matt so now he
[2:03:47] did not make us sons for we were already
[2:03:49] his sons but he placed us as his son for
[2:03:54] as long as we were in the world in the
[2:03:56] flesh we could not be recognized as his
[2:03:58] sons we were held captive by the devil
[2:04:01] but not we were sons nevertheless and
[2:04:04] hear this and because you are sons God
[2:04:08] has sent for the spirit of his son into
[2:04:10] your hearts whereby you cry father
[2:04:13] father of whom whom did the spirit fall
[2:04:15] at Pentecost sons at Corinth upon sons
[2:04:19] when they heard the word hey mom
[2:04:24] and when the Holy Ghost came that put
[2:04:27] them in the body of Christ that put them
[2:04:30] or placed them in the land that's hold
[2:04:33] brother branham's whole sermon on the
[2:04:35] adoption is being pasted into the
[2:04:37] promised land now so in the end this
[2:04:41] morning church age he would even say
[2:04:43] what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[2:04:45] it is a spirit baptizing you into the
[2:04:49] body of Christ
[2:04:50] now this is why we believe you can't
[2:04:52] join the church you have to be baptized
[2:04:57] into it by the Holy Ghost amen so you
[2:05:01] might be born here dedicated here sit on
[2:05:05] the pew but you never truly belong until
[2:05:09] you're born again and you know until
[2:05:13] that happens you're always gonna have
[2:05:15] this sense of alienation
[2:05:21] you're gonna always have this sense I
[2:05:24] don't fit you're always gonna have this
[2:05:28] condemnation well I'm not worthy to take
[2:05:31] communion so you don't show up in
[2:05:34] communion well you know that's not the
[2:05:38] answer dance does not quit church does
[2:05:41] not quit communion the answer is get
[2:05:44] born-again resolve the issue get the
[2:05:50] strange feeling away from you can you
[2:05:53] get to where you you realize this is my
[2:05:54] homeland I am no stranger in this
[2:05:57] homeland
[2:05:58] I belong here hey ma'am now again um
[2:06:05] it's the spirit baptizing you into the
[2:06:08] body of Christ it is the new birth in
[2:06:10] his spirit the Living God coming in you
[2:06:12] again he would say in the message
[2:06:15] leadership and I think this is important
[2:06:17] hold on real close everybody listen
[2:06:20] listen up you've got to face one thing
[2:06:24] eternal life that's everybody here and
[2:06:28] there's only one person who can give
[2:06:31] that to you mama can't give it to you so
[2:06:39] you can raise you right and the Holy
[2:06:42] Spirit can use her and
[2:06:44] and and daddy to be the tutor to teach
[2:06:46] you what's right and wrong but all it
[2:06:51] will do is it is just a schoolmaster to
[2:06:55] keep you until you receive Christ hey
[2:07:01] man now like here's through they
[2:07:04] straight from the law they went out and
[2:07:05] they took other gods and they went a
[2:07:07] whoredoms and what you can do all of
[2:07:08] that under the rule of your mom and dad
[2:07:12] every time they're not looking you're
[2:07:14] flipping through pornography every time
[2:07:15] they're not looking you're doing things
[2:07:17] you know it's not right you go to school
[2:07:19] you change your clothes and you got your
[2:07:22] lipstick your dress comes oh I know
[2:07:25] since I was 15 I've free preached
[2:07:28] against women wearing the wearing short
[2:07:32] dresses and only have some goes to
[2:07:34] school and I stay out shoulder Timmy and
[2:07:37] pull their dresses their skirt all the
[2:07:39] way up so have to tie what is it you
[2:07:44] know again you need a new birth that's
[2:07:49] the problem because we can't give you
[2:07:52] the Holy Ghost mama can't Papa can't
[2:07:55] give it to you listen this your posture
[2:07:59] can't give it to you your leader here
[2:08:06] can't give it to you everybody that gets
[2:08:09] eternal life has got to come to Jesus
[2:08:12] Christ he's the only one who can give
[2:08:16] that part your teacher can give you an
[2:08:20] education she can teach you you have to
[2:08:23] learn it your mother can teach you to
[2:08:25] walk you have to learn to walk your
[2:08:26] father can teach you how to be a
[2:08:28] businessman or what you have to learn
[2:08:30] that but only Jesus can give you turn
[2:08:33] life your priest your leader and so
[2:08:37] forth can teach you your religion hold
[2:08:41] on your seats now you can learn the
[2:08:45] message that we are trying to teach but
[2:08:51] still that won't give you eternal life
[2:08:56] you've got to accept the person Jesus
[2:09:00] Christ you understand that all of you
[2:09:02] you gotta accept the person Jesus Christ
[2:09:05] to have eternal life
[2:09:08] hey man so it's the age of the personal
[2:09:11] life now early in the 1950s brother
[2:09:15] Branham was telling the Azusa Street the
[2:09:17] full gospel movement that something more
[2:09:20] was needed than what they had received
[2:09:22] over and over again he will use
[2:09:25] different illustrations but the point is
[2:09:28] the same dad would find us they thought
[2:09:31] they'd achieved it the Baptist thought
[2:09:33] they did it when they believe this isn't
[2:09:34] Methodist thought they did it when they
[2:09:36] got sanctified and sadly the Pentecostal
[2:09:38] thought they had all of it when they
[2:09:39] spoke in tongues and brother Branham
[2:09:42] over and over and over again is dealing
[2:09:44] with the people who say yeah when fired
[2:09:46] up you're not so tired
[2:09:52] so he'll you use different illustrations
[2:09:55] so the year 1956 you know what 1956 was
[2:10:00] it was a year of their Jubilee 50 years
[2:10:06] 1906 1956 and brother branham's message
[2:10:11] throughout that year was a hidden life
[2:10:14] with Christ and he he would use the
[2:10:18] types of the three courts he taught that
[2:10:21] although they had received the manna
[2:10:23] which he typed as the Holy Spirit that
[2:10:25] they hadn't gone into the holiest of
[2:10:28] Holies where the pot of manna never
[2:10:31] gives out and the believer who dwells
[2:10:33] there never suffers the meal cramps or
[2:10:36] ever hungers again and that behind the
[2:10:39] curtain he sealed away from the world so
[2:10:42] this is what he was saying he said you
[2:10:44] know I'm not saying you don't have mana
[2:10:45] he said Mather fell on the outer courts
[2:10:49] Madeleine would even they would have a
[2:10:51] pot of man art or other some shewbread
[2:10:53] in the inner court but it had to be
[2:10:57] changed out all the time but he said in
[2:11:00] the holiest of Holies where the word
[2:11:03] were in in that place he said they had
[2:11:05] part of mana that never got stale that
[2:11:10] never then you know that the believer
[2:11:13] there never had to suffer milk rounds
[2:11:17] hit in other words he didn't know it a
[2:11:19] revival and then lose what he got there
[2:11:22] have to go to another revival wait for
[2:11:24] the spirits of all again and wait for
[2:11:26] the spirit of all again and get another
[2:11:28] bite to eat make it on to the next
[2:11:30] meeting then they know once he was in
[2:11:33] that holiest of Holies he ate the
[2:11:36] original manner that was poured out on
[2:11:41] the day of Pentecost hallelujah the same
[2:11:44] original manner and there in that whole
[2:11:47] list of holy he never got hungry again
[2:11:49] well he always had a hunger but it was
[2:11:52] right there every matter he never had to
[2:11:55] go hunting out again he never felt the
[2:11:58] empty again are you with me he was
[2:12:02] satisfied he was filled with the spirit
[2:12:05] the pot of manna was the cicada glory
[2:12:07] was there instead of outside here and
[2:12:11] you know you have sunlight on the outer
[2:12:13] court it's like great light a bright
[2:12:17] shining light but at night you ain't
[2:12:21] there and in the time of cloudy days is
[2:12:28] dark and dismal you don't feel its
[2:12:31] warmth his light then he said the next
[2:12:39] court was it was like there too
[2:12:42] and he said it was from the seven golden
[2:12:45] candlesticks which is the light of the
[2:12:49] messengers but the light of the
[2:12:52] messengers is leading you are making the
[2:12:55] way of shining the light for you to come
[2:12:57] into the holiest of Holies and he said
[2:13:02] but the problem with that sometimes it
[2:13:05] would forget to put the oily in
[2:13:07] different times the lamps would go out
[2:13:12] they would gets muddy and smoky and it
[2:13:16] was a good light
[2:13:18] but he said he of the inner court was
[2:13:21] this kind of glory and that light never
[2:13:23] went out whether it was stormy outside
[2:13:26] and cloudy and whether it was low is
[2:13:29] nighttime no matter what it was always
[2:13:32] there the Shekinah glory was always
[2:13:35] there man the light never got them and
[2:13:40] went out it didn't it didn't depend on
[2:13:43] the refilling it was always there it
[2:13:48] didn't have to be pumped up and warped
[2:13:50] out and pressed out and squeezed out and
[2:13:52] then get this oil out of this and putted
[2:13:54] that know it was there there's a
[2:13:56] category there all the time
[2:13:58] Pilate Madden never failed and he said
[2:14:00] to the Vale come and shut the world off
[2:14:03] and this is what he's saying Pentecost
[2:14:07] Baptists Methodists you got mana you got
[2:14:12] the Holy Ghost but you ain't went far
[2:14:14] enough you got light but it ain't the
[2:14:17] perfect light you know you got mana but
[2:14:20] it ain't it ain't the hidden manna the
[2:14:26] whole point of it was full time fullest
[2:14:32] and being sealed away from the world the
[2:14:38] problem he found was believers couldn't
[2:14:40] make it from revival to revival they
[2:14:44] would backslide before the next survival
[2:14:47] and although you know in the outer court
[2:14:50] they you know was light but then would
[2:14:52] come darkness and the light would be
[2:14:54] gone cloudy days of discouragement would
[2:14:57] block the light the inner court the
[2:15:00] problems the same they have lighted
[2:15:02] candle sticks we get smoking them so all
[2:15:06] of this you know but there is a place
[2:15:09] this is what we're trying to preach the
[2:15:11] age of the life you see the Chi kind of
[2:15:15] glory was God it wasn't leading you to
[2:15:19] God it was God and that's what we're
[2:15:23] preaching about you know not a step
[2:15:25] toward God not a jerk
[2:15:27] to the lab but if the line now the next
[2:15:35] night service
[2:15:35] after brother branham presa they that
[2:15:39] anniversary service he says he preached
[2:15:42] the next night was why I think Pentecost
[2:15:46] failed well can't you imagine how angry
[2:15:51] that made the Pentecostals to tell them
[2:15:56] why I think you failed and then this
[2:16:00] sermon he teaches that the churches are
[2:16:02] predestinated to adoption and the
[2:16:05] Pentecost is stopped short of it was
[2:16:07] still a child that needed to grow up and
[2:16:10] for this he uses the example of the
[2:16:13] Roman custom of adoption now that a
[2:16:15] Roman would adopt a son and his family
[2:16:17] then the son would be born in his family
[2:16:20] during the years of child-rearing the
[2:16:22] the the son would be under a governor or
[2:16:25] tutor but when adopted he would be a
[2:16:27] mature son an adult who had proved that
[2:16:32] he had been an achiever and that he
[2:16:35] proves that worthy of sonship and
[2:16:38] inherited his father's possession and
[2:16:40] this young man had been raised and
[2:16:42] tutored and proved by his behavior that
[2:16:44] he was worthy of sonship this was this
[2:16:49] was the Roman custom of adopting an
[2:16:51] adult son into the family as a business
[2:16:56] administrator and the ceremony would
[2:17:00] include recognition of a new robe that
[2:17:02] signified his positioning or a ring that
[2:17:05] the signified is authority to act in his
[2:17:08] father's name and it continues his
[2:17:12] concept in the adoption series in 1960
[2:17:15] and he uses his same custom of the
[2:17:17] Romans there and and the NT would show
[2:17:20] them how that you know the tutor was
[2:17:23] trying to give them to come to sonship
[2:17:27] and yet they that wasn't covered in this
[2:17:31] place where they were filled with the
[2:17:34] spirit where the spirit of a doctor
[2:17:36] came after although after all the holy
[2:17:39] ghost is the spirit of adoption whereby
[2:17:42] we cry Abba Father
[2:17:47] hey man it's the receiving of the Spirit
[2:17:50] of Christ in your life when he comes
[2:17:54] that's what adoption is I'm talking
[2:17:57] about Bible now mmm and at the end at
[2:18:01] this point it reaches a point were the
[2:18:05] food that where he's been under tutors
[2:18:07] and with we're here where he's come
[2:18:09] through his sanctification and he's
[2:18:11] learned the Father's will that God would
[2:18:14] fill him with the Holy Ghost would set
[2:18:18] him aside keep here the robe give him
[2:18:20] authority now brother Brennan would use
[2:18:23] this terminology the Roman custom - of
[2:18:27] adoption to illustrate the need of the
[2:18:30] church - to UM to progress in maturity
[2:18:36] yet he didn t Christianize them he just
[2:18:40] acknowledged the work that God had done
[2:18:43] in their lives world work of the Spirit
[2:18:45] but he was saying you you need something
[2:18:47] more and he he would he would talk about
[2:18:52] the the tutors effort to try to get
[2:18:56] these people spirit-filled people these
[2:18:59] that were claiming sphere field is the
[2:19:02] way I would say it claiming to be spirit
[2:19:05] field to come to a point that God could
[2:19:07] entrust them in the kingdom as a
[2:19:11] full-fledged son and you said that
[2:19:14] church will not come to adoption that
[2:19:17] won't come to maturity that will come
[2:19:19] hours away now remember without this
[2:19:27] adoption you're not going in the rapture
[2:19:28] I saw there the rupture the rupture is
[2:19:33] only for the adopted and the adopted is
[2:19:37] the spirit filled those who have the
[2:19:39] token it's all one in the same now so
[2:19:44] you know again brother Branham would
[2:19:47] talk about losers filled with the spirit
[2:19:50] math siddhis filled with the spirit
[2:19:53] Presbyterians filled with the spirit you
[2:19:57] know you know your son but you you need
[2:20:01] something more what you got is not even
[2:20:05] you're not even coming in to conduct
[2:20:07] you're not even coming to the please
[2:20:10] another father how is he ever gonna
[2:20:12] trust you with the kingdom and you won't
[2:20:15] behave you won't do what I say you won't
[2:20:19] surrender your own will you're
[2:20:23] determined to continue right on in your
[2:20:26] sinful lifestyle and yet claim the
[2:20:28] spirit and brother Brandon would talk
[2:20:33] about them you know being full of the
[2:20:36] Holy Ghost and he said when the
[2:20:38] Pentecost some people the Free Methodist
[2:20:39] and the Baptist and so when they
[2:20:42] received the Holy Spirit and said we got
[2:20:44] it that settles it but it didn't he said
[2:20:47] what did God was good but it wasn't
[2:20:49] enough he didn't condemn he didn't
[2:20:53] condemn the confessing Christ he didn't
[2:20:56] condemn them believin in sanctification
[2:20:58] living a holy life quit drinking smoking
[2:21:00] he didn't condemn that he believed in
[2:21:03] now he didn't condemn the Pentecostals
[2:21:06] weakened with kisses fear being said
[2:21:08] you're not going far enough you stopped
[2:21:15] short and so he was using this
[2:21:18] illustration of adoption to show them
[2:21:21] you haven't went far enough and because
[2:21:26] you refused to go further you will not
[2:21:29] inherit you might be a son and you might
[2:21:34] let me bring it to dead today's turn you
[2:21:37] may be on the outside of the city you
[2:21:41] may be a foolish virgin or you could
[2:21:44] wind up in hell but you're not going to
[2:21:48] carry the rapture without the Holy Ghost
[2:21:52] until you come to full time until you
[2:21:55] get a top bed you cannot go into rapture
[2:22:02] if you're not listening to the tutor
[2:22:05] trying to bring correction he can never
[2:22:11] trust you with his power power without
[2:22:16] characters satanic what's the result of
[2:22:19] aaand satanic just even millions let me
[2:22:28] tell you Janice and Jambres receive use
[2:22:30] the power of God to turn their staffs
[2:22:35] into serpents you think the devil can do
[2:22:38] that if he can he's a creator they use
[2:22:41] the power of God to do it but look what
[2:22:43] they use their power these impersonators
[2:22:45] use their power to try to keep the
[2:22:48] people in Egypt keep them in bondage and
[2:22:54] the power of Moses was to free the
[2:22:57] people from bondage and you look at all
[2:23:00] these other moves out there what was
[2:23:02] what did they use their gifts for it was
[2:23:06] to keep them in denominational
[2:23:08] enslavement
[2:23:11] this is Jennison jammers that withstood
[2:23:14] Moses has withstood even the prophet in
[2:23:18] the last day but look at what their
[2:23:24] motive is what they're doing with it in
[2:23:26] your life and you look a lot of even men
[2:23:28] with Holy Ghost gifts of preaching and
[2:23:32] preach like a house on fire and a high
[2:23:34] wind and you know make me look like a
[2:23:37] kindergarten kid but and these guys you
[2:23:41] know with great gifts and whatever
[2:23:43] they're like but look and see what
[2:23:44] they're doing
[2:23:45] quinta building denominationalism
[2:23:48] fooling people he fended themselves
[2:23:51] teachers having itching ears
[2:23:54] hey ma'am
[2:23:55] but brother Branson but how can the
[2:23:58] church the Pentecostal church some
[2:24:00] Methodists and the Baptist churches be
[2:24:02] adopted
[2:24:03] until they come to discipline if they
[2:24:06] won't hear the word how are they gonna
[2:24:09] ever be rapture ready if they won't lead
[2:24:13] the wilderness of sin how are they ever
[2:24:16] going to get in the Promised Land if
[2:24:18] there's Faisal here and Kate is Barnea
[2:24:20] there never look at the end they're
[2:24:22] tasting they're shouting they're doing
[2:24:24] all of this they say we're circumcised
[2:24:27] we're Jews we're seed of a ver have
[2:24:29] we're Christians but they're not going
[2:24:32] into the homeland now brother Branham
[2:24:38] would deal with these I started a little
[2:24:42] early so I could end a little late and
[2:24:50] if you're a little upset about that I
[2:24:52] got a few words for you so let's just
[2:24:56] get along with this there's some where
[2:25:01] we're going with this now here's why
[2:25:04] they were not receiving the dope brother
[2:25:07] branham would give the tutors report
[2:25:10] said the Holy Ghost is a tutor and he's
[2:25:13] working on these and he cannot get them
[2:25:15] into repentance so he'll work on him
[2:25:20] that's here now listen the tutor will
[2:25:22] use preachers he'll use other other sons
[2:25:26] and daughters of God would tell you the
[2:25:28] word but here's what he said they're
[2:25:30] marrying and giving in marriage that
[2:25:33] lots of the Deacons are married four or
[2:25:35] five times and still holding Deacons
[2:25:37] office do you notice the church had
[2:25:41] begun flipping about marriage yeah do
[2:25:47] you know do you know in our message
[2:25:50] ranks today there are polygamist who
[2:25:53] have more than one wives and use quotes
[2:25:55] to to back up their beliefs absolutely
[2:26:01] they are do you know there are
[2:26:03] adulterers in the pulpit that net that
[2:26:07] churches will let their pastor go right
[2:26:10] on into adultery and continue right on
[2:26:13] sitting there underneath
[2:26:17] do you know again again it's in the
[2:26:20] church we we have had homosexuals in the
[2:26:24] pulpit a man homosexuals in the church I
[2:26:29] believe him I believe that they can come
[2:26:32] to church they just need to be born
[2:26:34] again
[2:26:35] hey man it's no different than a
[2:26:37] prostitute out here is just reversion
[2:26:40] both of them verted lights but never
[2:26:44] done nevertheless let me tell let me
[2:26:46] tell you there's hope for you if you're
[2:26:48] in that condition because there is a
[2:26:50] deliverance but don't think you're a
[2:26:54] Christian and live in that kind of life
[2:26:56] man you know they're there again there's
[2:26:59] no earnest prayer given about this
[2:27:01] important life decisions until death do
[2:27:06] us part is still the order of the day
[2:27:11] all right but today we find there's no
[2:27:15] earnest desire to be the leader of the
[2:27:17] Holy Ghost and to realize young people
[2:27:21] you are to marry by revelation when
[2:27:26] brother Branham sums it all up in
[2:27:28] marriage and divorce he says you know he
[2:27:31] said if you married by revelation that's
[2:27:33] yours and and when you know married by
[2:27:39] revelation you're breaking the word but
[2:27:41] again it shows a laugh of the Holy Ghost
[2:27:45] in a person's life you're to marry by
[2:27:49] revelation the person you are taken to
[2:27:51] be your spouse is to be an eternal mate
[2:27:55] [Applause]
[2:27:57] and then brother madam turns his
[2:28:01] attention to those who are claiming the
[2:28:02] Holy Ghost and you are showing all this
[2:28:05] evidence they hadn't went far enough
[2:28:06] they need the father's approval and the
[2:28:09] Holy Spirit in their life and the tutor
[2:28:11] can't recommend them for adoption now
[2:28:16] these are the people that are supposedly
[2:28:18] spirit filled the brother brems that you
[2:28:22] need adopted he was telling him you need
[2:28:25] something more that
[2:28:27] to God and here's what he said the women
[2:28:32] are dressing and acting just like almost
[2:28:36] harlots on the street what Holy Ghost
[2:28:42] filled women your daughters that you
[2:28:48] gave the Holy Spirit I'm quoting oh
[2:28:50] they're dressing soem morally till
[2:28:53] they're making men on the street less
[2:28:55] for them church members come in and
[2:29:03] dressing in a seductive way it's a shame
[2:29:05] it's a shame enough for men they have to
[2:29:08] turn their head out here in the world
[2:29:10] but come in the house of God and have to
[2:29:13] turn their head and mom your daughters
[2:29:18] are wearing shorts
[2:29:21] your sons are permit me we'll get on the
[2:29:24] sons in a minute
[2:29:25] but yeah I'm just I'm just taking these
[2:29:28] snippets how they wear shorts and still
[2:29:30] addresses your daughters are dressing
[2:29:33] them morally women wearing these little
[2:29:36] bitty clothes it looks like man's
[2:29:37] clothes slacks or something they call
[2:29:40] them women in the summertime get out
[2:29:42] with a little bitty short clothes own
[2:29:44] that they often they even appear before
[2:29:47] their husband Ian and mow the yard and
[2:29:49] walk up and down the streets with those
[2:29:51] little clothes oh and you know what
[2:29:52] we're seeing on Facebook anymore all of
[2:29:56] these all of these message people out
[2:29:59] here dressed in lewd ways out on the
[2:30:02] bench on the beaches it ought to be the
[2:30:08] same and the men get out there and wear
[2:30:11] these shorts I'm not you know what I
[2:30:15] show it you don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:30:17] the tutor can't get you to full
[2:30:20] repentance hey man I'll turn the
[2:30:24] backyard with a little bit of hair a
[2:30:26] real dirty looking clothes don't call
[2:30:28] shorts mow in New York slacks is that
[2:30:30] what you call them do you know the Bible
[2:30:31] said is an abomination for a woman to
[2:30:33] put on a garment that pertains to man
[2:30:35] they have put on him more clothes
[2:30:37] those clothes that look like men that
[2:30:39] called them pedal pushers and slacks
[2:30:42] these are the people that brother
[2:30:44] branham is calling spirit-filled
[2:30:47] sons and daughters who need adoption why
[2:30:52] is he calling that because they have
[2:30:54] made professions of faith but they
[2:30:58] hadn't went all the way it's obvious the
[2:31:02] seal of God ain't there look at Grandma
[2:31:11] get some old pictures look at
[2:31:14] grandmother her long skirts braids of
[2:31:15] hair hanging down her back she wasn't so
[2:31:18] attractive to look look at the modern
[2:31:20] one today now we come to modern grandma
[2:31:23] modern grandma not modern teenage girl
[2:31:28] modern grandma let me tell you something
[2:31:33] let me tell you ladies sisters in this
[2:31:35] church grandmas you need you need to
[2:31:40] dress me as an example for the younger
[2:31:44] ones coming behind you hey man look at
[2:31:50] the modern grandma add a little skin
[2:31:53] down dress that ever formed she can't
[2:31:57] move without sinning walking tripping
[2:32:02] down the street with all the makeup and
[2:32:04] cosmetic a Max Factor can put on her
[2:32:07] nearly fixing her hair like some little
[2:32:09] girl wearing a little skirt just up
[2:32:12] about above her knees if you got on any
[2:32:14] at all but you look at her she's pretty
[2:32:16] Satan knows how to do it he's the author
[2:32:19] of beauty and that type of beauty which
[2:32:21] results in sin now God isn't against you
[2:32:26] being beautiful he's against you in
[2:32:28] having a portrayal of beauty that
[2:32:30] results in sin amen and sin is just
[2:32:35] crossing the word of God he would give
[2:32:41] an example and here you him he said in
[2:32:44] the view of this I wonder tonight if we
[2:32:46] the Pentecostal church that claims a new
[2:32:48] birth
[2:32:49] the Holy Spirit must blush when it comes
[2:32:54] in the presence of God to bring our
[2:32:55] character record on before the Father we
[2:32:58] call ourselves believers and we
[2:33:00] dilly-dally around the world the man
[2:33:03] that got away from God the women have
[2:33:05] got away from God it used to be in the
[2:33:07] old fashioned Church it was wrong for
[2:33:09] women to cut their hair Jenna they just
[2:33:12] as bobbed hair as the rest of the world
[2:33:14] it was wrong to wear this stuff on
[2:33:17] manicure or whatever you call it on
[2:33:19] their lips and mat now you think brother
[2:33:23] Branham was ignorant and stupid and
[2:33:25] whatever some people do because he calls
[2:33:28] it manicure you know we aren't we
[2:33:31] understand and he did to it that's you
[2:33:33] just on your fingers and nails but he's
[2:33:36] making a point and I'll tell you what
[2:33:40] you're being spiritually stupid for wear
[2:33:42] makeup don't think my prophets stupid
[2:33:47] you're being spiritually stupid to wear
[2:33:50] makeup
[2:33:52] hey man it's wrong you say wait wait
[2:33:57] wait wait and wait a minute brother Tim
[2:33:58] show me something in the Bible's and all
[2:34:00] you got in the Bible is that about
[2:34:02] Jezebel
[2:34:03] well I mean Jezebel put on makeup to
[2:34:06] vamp men and all you have to do oh you
[2:34:11] have to do is do a little bit of
[2:34:14] research on makeup and it's all about
[2:34:16] vamping men in fact I can read you the
[2:34:22] stats myself right here I've got them
[2:34:25] right in front of me there's studies
[2:34:26] that have been done they want the blush
[2:34:28] on the cheek and the redness on the lip
[2:34:30] to show that they are bleeding because
[2:34:33] that is the most likely time that women
[2:34:36] want to have a sexual relationship it is
[2:34:40] for the purpose of vamp and men now
[2:34:45] while I live my purpose and why are you
[2:34:47] doing it why do you want to even be like
[2:34:50] that hey mouth so you know but is it ye
[2:34:57] breaching cuz I'm just saying I don't
[2:35:00] care your Papa couldn't give you the
[2:35:01] Holy Ghost you
[2:35:02] mama couldn't do it and the pastor can't
[2:35:05] but you need a personal relationship
[2:35:08] with Jesus Christ that really changes
[2:35:11] your nature that makes you desire what
[2:35:17] God's Word sense that whatever I uh well
[2:35:23] brother Tim really now the reason why I
[2:35:26] wear it is cause I you know it it's just
[2:35:31] cuz I like it
[2:35:32] well okay so it's for your own self this
[2:35:36] is what the Bible said that there would
[2:35:38] be self lovers more than lovers of God
[2:35:44] this is a condition of the endtime world
[2:35:48] that we're living in and this shows that
[2:35:50] a person will not ever be adopted til
[2:35:54] they come to the place they hate saying
[2:35:57] like God hates her
[2:36:01] now so again in the Pentecostal women
[2:36:06] today oh well today the Pentecostal
[2:36:09] women wear shorts old vulgar little
[2:36:11] vulgar clothes and stand out and mow
[2:36:13] their yard oh brother there something's
[2:36:15] happened that's the old-fashioned
[2:36:17] brother it'll scour you out
[2:36:19] it's what the church needs is not so
[2:36:21] much of this Hollywood preaching we're
[2:36:23] having today but it's this old an
[2:36:25] old-fashioned revival in to sweep the
[2:36:27] country in the scour out the Church of
[2:36:29] God and that's the reason there wait a
[2:36:32] minute
[2:36:33] I'm gonna bring something down to you
[2:36:36] brother Brendan said that misbehavior
[2:36:39] one men member can cause a whole church
[2:36:42] to miserably fail miss Vega do you know
[2:36:47] the misbehavior of a woman who claims in
[2:36:51] a Christian and she she will dress and
[2:36:54] and do things that the Prophet spoke
[2:36:56] against and the Bible speaks against no
[2:37:00] way man you say you need but more Bible
[2:37:02] than Jezebel okay the Bible said that
[2:37:04] you should dressed in modest apparel but
[2:37:08] whatever you do it should be modesty
[2:37:11] and you can't call that modest win is
[2:37:14] for sex appeal I'm nailing it down but
[2:37:20] you might as well get it we've got to
[2:37:22] preach holiness if we're gonna have an
[2:37:25] adopted church and you're gonna have to
[2:37:27] believe in holiness if you're ever gonna
[2:37:30] be filled with the Holy Spirit he is not
[2:37:32] going to build your vessel and you still
[2:37:35] got desire for the world out here
[2:37:41] that's the reason we don't have miracles
[2:37:44] all-night prayer meetings and things
[2:37:46] that we used to have is because
[2:37:47] something's happen the Holy Spirit
[2:37:49] cannot bless we've had we've taken
[2:37:51] different teachers will we've not let
[2:37:53] the Holy Spirit do the teaching and how
[2:37:55] we get away with some little fancy slick
[2:37:58] tongue fellow didn't say oh that's
[2:37:59] old-fashioned don't believe in that but
[2:38:02] that's the teaching of the Bible or you
[2:38:04] say you're just old-fashioned brother
[2:38:05] branham the Bible is also and we're
[2:38:08] guilty before God if we neglect to
[2:38:09] preach the entire truth of that Bible my
[2:38:14] sister's the other day now here he comes
[2:38:16] and brings a point down the other day a
[2:38:18] young lady come to my house a beautiful
[2:38:21] woman sitting on the porch from my wife
[2:38:22] and I'd come in she was so dressed she

[2:38:52] poured into a little dress it was
[2:38:54] terrible looking wasn't made for a woman
[2:38:57] to wear her now he said I'm not critical
[2:38:59] and I'm joking this is a pulpit and they
[2:39:02] say and the Bible the woman looked
[2:39:03] terrible and she kept telling me about
[2:39:05] how about her having nervous spells well
[2:39:08] he just happened to be I said well now

[2:39:34] you a year of the old school of thought
[2:39:36] this is 1957 we're that in the
[2:39:40] Pentecostal ranks they began to preach
[2:39:43] the liberation of women and so they were
[2:39:47] going to set the women free where they
[2:39:49] could listen I went through it with my
[2:39:51] cousins yeah we had Pentecost okay I had
[2:39:55] Pentecostal cousins that were pastors
[2:39:58] doubters that you know that that were
[2:40:02] wearing miniskirts in the 70s and makeup
[2:40:05] and cutting their hair you couldn't tell
[2:40:07] them from the world and their excuse was
[2:40:09] well how in the world you think we can
[2:40:12] be a witness and a light to people if we
[2:40:16] if we we dress like some old fogey well
[2:40:19] you know let me ask you something how in
[2:40:21] the world you think you're gonna be a
[2:40:22] light when you're darkness just like the
[2:40:25] rest of them a light stands out it's a
[2:40:30] beacon of the time of darkness and then
[2:40:33] that there is a holy God and a holiness
[2:40:37] hey ma'am and he said he said my pastor
[2:40:42] don't believe like that we got
[2:40:44] liberation of women he said you got
[2:40:46] liberation of something it's from the
[2:40:48] Bible you know you're that you've
[2:40:50] liberated yourself from me she said I
[2:40:52] said did anyone ever tell you you're an
[2:40:56] attractive woman and she kind of messed
[2:40:57] up her hair again on the south yes and
[2:40:59] you know do you realize that's a way
[2:41:04] that the way you dress you'll send more
[2:41:06] men there held and all the bar rooms in
[2:41:09] the country sees it what brother friend
[2:41:12] of my I don't mean anything
[2:41:13] and Bob God's grace here comes a basin
[2:41:16] and I see what she's doing so you work
[2:41:19] in an office yeah your mother's dead
[2:41:22] yeah you've got four sisters and a
[2:41:24] brother right he was lifting a fan
[2:41:26] around it hurts your back yeah if you
[2:41:28] put your hand back there and you'll find
[2:41:29] its source he said it is he said well
[2:41:32] right there he said there's you're
[2:41:35] nervous problems she said well thank the
[2:41:37] Lord he said welcome
[2:41:38] some clothes on now and she said brother
[2:41:42] Brandon we don't believe in that kind of
[2:41:44] old-fashioned stuff and I said well then
[2:41:47] what about last night the boy you was
[2:41:51] with in that place and she started
[2:41:54] crying and it exposed her sin and told
[2:41:57] her the adultery she was living in and
[2:41:59] how she fell on the floor and began to
[2:42:02] weep and now you see that adulterous
[2:42:05] Spirit was showing itself on the outside
[2:42:08] and was manifesting itself in her dress
[2:42:15] because what is on the inside is going
[2:42:18] to show on the outside so he says well
[2:42:31] lady you might be as virtuous and clean
[2:42:33] as you can be but if you dress in little
[2:42:35] Hollywood dresses and get on the street
[2:42:38] and man's looked at you you're guilty of
[2:42:39] adultery can you imagine you being you
[2:42:44] being a party to adultery because the
[2:42:49] way you dressed because of the way your
[2:42:51] daughter said the way that you vamped
[2:42:53] men and caused them to look at you in a
[2:42:57] sexual manner don't you realize you're
[2:43:01] guilty with him you see men we're in the
[2:43:06] mind that you can commit adultery you
[2:43:09] see young man why you shouldn't be
[2:43:11] looking at this pornography and stuff
[2:43:14] because that's where it's committed is
[2:43:16] in the mind first and then you take that
[2:43:19] kind of spirit on and there it will
[2:43:21] torment your your life
[2:43:23] it'll they it'll go right into your
[2:43:24] marriage it'll ruin your homes hey man I
[2:43:29] don't know what I'm talking about is the
[2:43:31] truth you can you cannot set any evil
[2:43:34] thing before your eyes amen now so
[2:43:38] Christian women to where mayor manicure

[2:43:54] stuff quit buying this stuff and send
[2:43:56] that to missions and do something good

[2:44:01] reproach on the gospel of Christ do

[2:44:05] Christ

[2:54:04] anchor in your salt that's what he wants
[2:54:09] to do bring you to adoption he wants to
[2:54:11] be able to entrust you and empower your
[2:54:14] life he wants to bring you to full turn

[2:54:42] fussing disputing over little petty
[2:54:44] differences unbelief unthankful unholy
[2:54:46] without natural affection arrogant
[2:54:49] dilatory arguing our little religious
[2:54:52] differences and splitting airs and such
[2:54:54] nonsense
[2:54:57] and when we got today families that are
[2:55:01] all broke up supposed to believe the
[2:55:03] message and can't even worship together
[2:55:08] can't even come together to worship God
[2:55:13] together it's because the Holy Spirit is
[2:55:16] not there
[2:55:24] still there with bitterness hate some of
[2:55:29] you some of you don't want to even serve
[2:55:32] Christ today because of what you've seen
[2:55:34] in your own family's life but I'm gonna
[2:55:38] tell you your family is not the example
[2:55:43] the Bible is God's example when you sing
[2:55:49] your family do things in the Word of God
[2:55:51] says not to do don't blame the Bible
[2:55:55] don't blame the message when you see
[2:55:58] results of this ugliness hatred malice
[2:56:05] and variance fighting in the family mom
[2:56:09] and dad can't get along don't blame that
[2:56:11] on the message blame that on an
[2:56:14] unconverted life and I'm asking you

[2:56:24] to step up to become real men I'm
[2:56:27] talking I'm speaking about women to come
[2:56:29] to be real women talking about teenagers
[2:56:34] to be real examples of God the tutors

[2:56:39] were wooing I want to bring you to
[2:56:44] adoption I want to bring you into
[2:56:45] fullness I wanted to deal with that
[2:56:49] emptiness in your life take out the
[2:56:53] vanity and the pride and the selfishness

[2:58:10] behind their men and support them and
[2:58:14] said we're going to be real Christians

[3:01:20] word and then walk together in Jesus is
[3:01:26] our men's supposed to be so wimpy that
[3:01:30] they can't take position and headship in
