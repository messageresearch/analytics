[40:12] for all he
[40:15] glory
[40:18] for
[40:22] and set me free
[40:25] and
[40:28] call.
[40:30] Hallelujah.
[40:32] Hallelujah.
[40:33] He's God. He's my God. Oh,
[40:39] for all he's done. Lord, aren't you
[40:44] thankful for all he's done?
[40:47] Oh, and he set me and he set me free
[40:53] and because
[40:56] just because
[40:59] he
[41:01] God.
[41:03] Oh yes. Hallelujah, Jesus.
[41:07] We worship you this morning. We thank
[41:09] you, God.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; We bless your name, oh God. There's no
[41:13] one like you.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; You're not finished yet.
[41:18] Hallelujah. You're still fulfilling the
[41:20] plan of redemption. You're still saving
[41:23] the lost. You're still healing the sick.
[41:26] Still raising the dead. You're still
[41:28] bringing the prodals home.
[41:30] Oh, you're not finished yet. Oh, praise
[41:33] the name of the Lord. Well, let's sing
[41:35] it again with all of our hearts.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Let's just thank him for a moment. Thank
[41:40] you, your God.
[41:42] You're still in control.
[41:45] Just Just think about that. God is still
[41:47] in control this morning. He's still in
[41:49] control of your life. He's still in
[41:51] control of every circumstance.
[41:53] And he's still God and he's still on the
[41:55] throne. Hallelujah. When I come into his
[41:58] presence, when I come into his presence,
[42:05] &gt;&gt; I humble.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Just lift up both your hands and
[42:11] surrender it this morning.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; I surrender myself to a God who's
[42:16] faithful
[42:19] this morning.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. I worship you.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; I worship. I worship him.
[42:28] Oh, when I come into his presence,
[42:34] I humble myself.
[42:38] Remembering what he's done. All the
[42:42] victory,
[42:42] &gt;&gt; all the victories he's won. Oh, I praise
[42:47] him.
[42:50] Yes, I
[42:55] praise him.
[42:58] Oh
[43:01] my
[43:09] free.
[43:24] Hallelujah.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:28] Let's just worship him a moment.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Just express it from your heart.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, you're my God,
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[43:37] &gt;&gt; my savior,
[43:39] &gt;&gt; my God, my king,
[43:42] &gt;&gt; my everything.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Today we bow before you, the lamb that
[43:47] is worthy,
[43:49] the lamb that opened the seals,
[43:52] that revealed the mysteries."
[43:55] Oh God, the one who is worthy
[43:59] &gt;&gt; of all who heaven and earth declares
[44:03] the worthiness of this great one who
[44:06] became our redeemer.
[44:09] Oh God, I'm willing just to sit up on a
[44:12] lofty throne and let the world go by and
[44:16] lost. But Lord, you came down and become
[44:20] one of us.
[44:22] God condemned,
[44:24] walked among us in humanity,
[44:28] gave your life for redemption. Lord, we
[44:31] want to say thank you. Thank you for
[44:34] your grace, Lord. I ask, Lord, you bless
[44:37] every person in this place today with
[44:40] your presence. May you visit them right
[44:43] there in their seats as you walk this
[44:46] aisle. We know you can't do in the
[44:48] physical form what you did 2,000 years
[44:51] ago, but you're here in the form of your
[44:53] Holy Spirit.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; You can come and visit everyone. Lord,
[44:58] speak to every life. Reveal yourself in
[45:01] a very personal way to them.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, that you will bring
[45:06] healing and deliverance, salvation to
[45:09] those that are lost. May we just be
[45:12] gripped today by the word of God and it
[45:15] change our lives. Lord, may it bring men
[45:18] and women out of chaos
[45:20] &gt;&gt; and bring them into divine order. I
[45:23] pray, oh God, it'll speak to lives.
[45:26] Speak to hearts today. Anoint this
[45:28] service, oh God, in ways that is way
[45:32] beyond man. Lord God, let it be more
[45:35] than just theology to us today or just a
[45:38] a lecture from the Bible or a little
[45:40] lesson that is given. But oh God, may it
[45:43] be power packed and dynamic, the word
[45:47] live, the spirit breathe. Let it come
[45:50] Lord and move over this audience today.
[45:54] I pray God as it does, may the day dawn,
[45:58] the day star rise in hearts and lives
[46:01] and your word be revealed to your
[46:03] children.
[46:04] We ask it in Jesus name.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's good to be in the
[46:12] house of the Lord today and
[46:14] &gt;&gt; a place that we have dedicated unto him.
[46:16] And of course, you are the temple of the
[46:18] Holy Ghost. That's the real house of
[46:21] God. That's where he wants to dwell cuz
[46:23] he don't dwell in temples made with
[46:25] hands.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; But when we come together, we bring him
[46:28] here.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. For he comes wherever two or more
[46:32] gathered in his name.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we welcome you today in the
[46:36] name of the Lord Jesus.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Pray that he'll speak to you today. Turn
[46:41] with me to Genesis chapter 1 and verse
[46:43] one. It's just a scripture that we have
[46:46] been dealing with since the beginning of
[46:49] the year as the Lord spoke to me as we
[46:53] came to the close of the year of
[46:55] bringing order out of chaos. So I want
[46:57] to speak on that again this morning and
[47:00] I have two places in the scripture that
[47:02] I want to read from Genesis 1 and1 and
[47:05] then down through verse three and then
[47:07] Psalms 33 and verse 6. In the beginning,
[47:11] God created the heaven and the earth.
[47:14] And the earth was without form and void,
[47:16] and darkness was upon the face of the
[47:19] deep. And the spirit of God moved
[47:23] upon the face of the waters.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let there be light." And
[47:29] there was light. In Psalms 33 and verse
[47:33] 6,
[47:34] by the word of the Lord were the heavens
[47:37] made, and all the host of them by the
[47:41] breath of his mouth.
[47:43] He gatherth the waters of the sea
[47:46] together as a heap.
[47:49] He
[47:50] layeth up the depth in storehouses.
[47:54] Let all the earth fear the Lord. Let all
[47:58] the inhabitants of the world stand in
[48:00] awe of him. For he spake and it was
[48:03] done. He commanded and it stood fast.
[48:08] Amen. God bless you. Can be seated. As I
[48:11] said this morning, we're going to be
[48:12] speaking on bringing order out of chaos.
[48:17] A subject that we have been speaking on
[48:19] the last few services. I want to I want
[48:22] to speak on it again, but I'm going to
[48:24] just kind of look back and review a
[48:27] little bit as we go into this message
[48:30] this morning. Bring back to our memory
[48:33] again what we are speaking about. In
[48:36] Genesis 1, we see the Bible opens with a
[48:39] scene of disorder.
[48:42] The earth was without form and it was
[48:44] void and darkness was upon the face of
[48:46] the deep. There was no shape, no life,
[48:50] no clarity, nothing but emptiness and
[48:52] darkness.
[48:54] Yet the spirit of God moved. And I think
[48:57] that's very key.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God moved. And then came
[49:02] the turning point of all creation and
[49:05] God said. So with God speaking, now the
[49:10] word is released. Right?
[49:12] &gt;&gt; And and so when his word was breathed
[49:15] out of his spirit uh by his spirit, then
[49:18] light appeared. If you notice, it speaks
[49:21] and says, "Let there be light." And
[49:24] God's answer to the disorder of the
[49:27] earth was his word. That's always his
[49:30] answer to disorder is the word of God.
[49:34] For where the word is released, then
[49:36] darkness must retreat and order must
[49:39] begin. And that same truth is echoed
[49:42] again in in Psalms 33 that we read where
[49:45] David pulls back the curtain and shows
[49:47] us the secret of the universe. By the
[49:51] word of the Lord were the heavens made.
[49:54] For he spake and it was done. He
[49:57] commanded and it stood fast. And that
[50:00] means that creation is not held together
[50:02] by chance. And let me tell you, your
[50:05] life isn't supposed to be held together
[50:08] by just sheer willpower, but by the word
[50:11] of God.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Everything that STANDS STANDS BECAUSE
[50:15] GOD commanded it to stand.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; And the same God who spoke light into a
[50:20] dark world is speaking today. He's
[50:23] speaking into homes. He's speaking into
[50:25] hearts. He's speaking into churches.
[50:27] He's speaking into broken lives. And
[50:30] every time his word is received, then
[50:33] chaos starts losing its grip.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Because when God speaks, order is born
[50:39] and life began. Now you too, if you're a
[50:42] born again Christian today, you were
[50:44] born of the breath of God, the spoken
[50:47] word. Your new birth, the moment God
[50:50] began to bring order out of your life,
[50:53] he it started you when you begin to give
[50:56] heed to a sure word. Peter calls it a
[51:01] more sure word of prophecy and said, "We
[51:03] do well to take heed to it as unto a
[51:06] light in that shineth in a dark place
[51:10] until the day dawn and THE DAY STAR
[51:14] ARISE IN YOUR HEARTS."
[51:16] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what happened to you.
[51:18] the the light of God's word shone into
[51:22] the chaotic darkness that once covered
[51:25] your soul and IT BEGAN TO DRIVE OUT
[51:28] CONFUSION and fear and sin
[51:31] &gt;&gt; because I TELL YOU THE NEW BIRTH IS NOT
[51:33] MERELY CHURCH JOINING.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; It's not IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLY EMBRACING
[51:38] A doctrine
[51:39] &gt;&gt; or a set of teaching or a BUNCH OF
[51:42] RULES. IT'S THE word becoming life
[51:45] inside of you.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture said again, first
[51:49] Peter 1:23, being born again by the word
[51:53] of God, which liveth and abideth
[51:56] forever.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THE SAME GOD THAT SAID, "LET
[51:59] THERE BE LIGHT," it spoke again into
[52:02] your life.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; And when THE WORD WAS RECEIVED, LIGHT
[52:06] ENTERED AND FAITH AROSE. AND THE HOLY
[52:09] GHOST BEGAN TO BRING to your inner world
[52:13] a INTO A DIVINE ORDER. AND WHAT WAS ONCE
[52:16] VOID AND empty became uh filled with
[52:20] life until Christ became real within
[52:23] you. WHICH MEANS CHRIST in you, the hope
[52:27] of glory.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; And and we have learned that order was
[52:30] turned to chaos in the in heaven because
[52:33] one star, AN ANGEL GOT OUT of order
[52:38] &gt;&gt; by exalting himself.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; We know that was Lucifer. He wanted to
[52:42] be his god and to be worshiped. AND HIS
[52:45] FALL CAUSED ONETHIRD OF the angels to
[52:49] fall with him.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Now, Eden was an extension of heaven.
[52:54] And in Eden, everything moved in harmony
[52:56] with God. Adam and Eve would live under
[52:59] divine order and life flow and creation
[53:02] obeyed and fellowship was unhindered.
[53:05] BUT THE MOMENT THAT GOD'S WORD WAS
[53:07] QUESTIONED,
[53:08] &gt;&gt; the moment it was disobeyed, that's when
[53:11] order collapsed.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID IN GENESIS 2:17 THAT
[53:16] IN THE DAY THOU EATEST THEREOF, that day
[53:18] you shall surely die. AND AND WHEN THEY
[53:21] FELL, DEATH ENTERED.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Not just physical death, but spiritual
[53:26] disorder, separation from God.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; AND THEIR FEAR REPLACED peace and SHAME
[53:33] REPLACED INNOCENCE. AND BLAME replace
[53:36] unity.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID IN GENESIS 3:8, THEY
[53:40] HID themselves from the presence of the
[53:42] Lord God. YOU SEE, THE VERY FIRST SIGN
[53:46] OF CHAOS WAS SEPARATION FROM GOD, AND
[53:49] THEN EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWED.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, FROM THERE CAME CHAOS IN THE
[53:55] HOME.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Chaos between the siblings of Cain and
[53:59] Abel. THE DISORDER DIDN'T STOP WITH ADAM
[54:02] AND EVE. THAT MULTIPLIED to their
[54:04] children.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Cain and ABEL BROUGHT OFFERINGS TO GOD,
[54:07] BUT CAIN'S HEART WAS WRONG. And when God
[54:10] corrected him, Cain refused repentance.
[54:14] And because of this, HE SAID, "SIN LITH
[54:18] at the door." AND THIS LITERALLY MEANS
[54:20] THAT THAT SIN CROUCHED LIKE AN ANIMAL,
[54:24] YOU KNOW, AWAITING Cain's next move
[54:26] because he would not repent. And I'll
[54:28] tell you, WHEN GOD BRINGS SOMETHING TO
[54:30] YOUR LIFE AND YOU WILL and to your
[54:32] attention and you will not repent of it,
[54:34] sin always lies at the door.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; You see, BUT CAIN LOVED THE WORKS OF
[54:39] DARKNESS AND THAT OF CHAOS RATHER THAN
[54:42] THE OFFER OF LIGHT THAT BRINGS ORDER.
[54:46] AND INSTEAD OF MASTERING SIN AND
[54:48] OVERCOMING IT, Cain made murdered his
[54:52] brother. The the first DEATH THAT WAS
[54:54] CAUSED BY HUMAN VIOLENCE. And then THE
[54:57] BIBLE SAID IN GENESIS 14:10, "THE VOICE
[54:59] OF THY BROTHER'S BLOOD CRITH unto me
[55:02] from the ground." YOU SAY, "WHAT WAS
[55:04] THIS?" THIS WAS CHAOS THAT WAS MOVING
[55:07] FROM THE HEART NOW into human
[55:09] relationships.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; AND NOW THERE THIS IS A PRECEDENT that
[55:15] begins that starts upon THE EARTH WHERE
[55:17] VIOLENCE THEN BECOMES NORMAL.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; AS GENERATION PASSED, SIN would
[55:23] intensify.
[55:24] Murder was no longer shocking. IT BECAME
[55:27] BOASTFUL AND AND THE BIBLE SPEAKS OF
[55:30] LAMECH WHO OPENLY BOASTED AND CELEBRATED
[55:33] killing and vengeance.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 4:23 through 24 he SAID, "I
[55:38] HAVE KILLED A man for wounded me, a
[55:41] young man for injuring me." And then he
[55:44] said, "If be avenged sevenfold, truly
[55:47] lay 70 and seven uh 70 and sevenfold."
[55:52] Do you see? IN OTHER WORDS, SOMEBODY
[55:54] CROSSED ME,
[55:55] &gt;&gt; SO I KILLED IT.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; AND IF CAIN GOT SPECIAL PROTECTION, I
[56:00] DESERVE WAY MORE. AND LIFE HAD LOST ITS
[56:03] SACREDNESS.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; VIOLENCE HAD BECOME entertainment
[56:08] &gt;&gt; and pride AND ORDER WAS DISSOLVING
[56:11] RAPIDLY, AND THE WORLD WAS GOING MORE
[56:14] AND MORE INTO CHAOS. AND AND THIS SHOWS
[56:17] YOU HOW FAR THAT MANKIND HAD FALLEN
[56:20] since Eden. THAT VIOLENCE WAS NOT ONLY
[56:23] HAPPENING, IT WAS BEING CELEBRATED.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; And and I WANT YOU TO NOTICE WHAT LAMECH
[56:29] DOES. HE ACTUALLY TWISTS GOD'S MERCY
[56:32] into a an excuse FOR SIN. FOR GOD HAD
[56:36] PUT A MARK UPON CAIN TO PREVENT OTHERS
[56:38] FROM killing him. For he said in Genesis
[56:40] 4:15, "Therefore, whosoever slayth Cain,
[56:44] vengeance shall be taken on HIM
[56:46] SEVENFOLD."
[56:48] THAT SEVENFOLD WAS NOT CAIN BEING
[56:50] RIGHTEOUS, BUT IT WAS GOD RESTRAINING
[56:53] the spread OF VIOLENCE SO SOCIETY WOULD
[56:56] NOT COLLAPSE IMMEDIATELY. BUT YOU SEE,
[56:59] LAMECH TAKES THAT PROTECTION AND HE
[57:02] TURNS IT INTO A personal slogan.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IN GENESIS 4:24, "IF CAIN SHALL
[57:08] BE A AVENGED SEVENFOLD, truly a lame 70
[57:13] and sevenfold." You see, you see, IN
[57:17] OTHER WORDS, HE MEANT IF IF CAIN GETS
[57:20] SEVENFOLD PROTECTION, I DEMAND 70
[57:25] sevenfold. I AM MORE IMPORTANT THAN
[57:27] CAIN. YOU touch me and you'll pay. HE HE
[57:31] WAS CLAIMING A HIGHER RIGHT TO TO
[57:34] VENGEANCE than Cain. Like like HE'S
[57:36] UNTOUCHABLE.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; AND THIS SHOWS THE THE GROWTH OF CHAOS
[57:41] AFTER THE FALL. CAIN MURDERED ONCE AND
[57:44] HE FEARED CONSEQUENCES. LAMECH MURDERS
[57:47] AND HE BOASTS. YOU SEE THIS IS SIN AS IT
[57:51] GROWS AS IT ESCALATES. IT'S GETTING
[57:53] BOLDER. CONSCIENCE IS GETTING HARDER.
[57:56] VIOLENCE IS NORMALIZING AND IT'S A PART
[57:59] OF THE DOWNWARD spiral that leads to the
[58:03] flood where the BIBLE SAID AND THE EARTH
[58:05] WAS filled with violence. AND LAY HE
[58:10] REPRESENTS THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD
[58:12] TODAY. I'LL HANDLE IT MYSELF.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; HE'S REJECTING GOD'S ORDER. HE'S
[58:18] REPLACING IT WITH PERSONAL JUSTICE WITH
[58:20] A WITH INTIMIDATION. AND AND THIS IS THE
[58:23] OPPOSITE OF GOD'S WAY BECAUSE GOD COMM
[58:26] WOULD WOULD COMMAND RESTRAINT. HE SAID
[58:28] IN ROMANS 12:19, "VENGEANCE IS MINE. I
[58:32] WILL REPAY saith the Lord." AMEN.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; SO YOU see lay is saying VENGEANCE IS
[58:38] MINE. I WILL do the repaying.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; YOU TOUCH ME, YOU'LL PAY FOR IT. AND LAY
[58:44] USE 70 AND SEVENFOLD TO BRAG ABOUT
[58:48] REVENGE.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Oh listen. But Jesus would use the same
[58:52] phrase.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; To teach forgiveness.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 18:22, he speaks to Peter and
[58:57] he said about forgiveness. He said, "I
[59:00] say not unto thee unto seven times, but
[59:03] unto 70* 7."
[59:06] &gt;&gt; DO YOU NOTICE? IT'S LIKE JESUS TAKES THE
[59:09] DARKEST BOAST
[59:11] &gt;&gt; OF EARLY HUMANITY AND HE FLIPS IT INTO
[59:14] HEAVEN'S ORDER.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; LAYMENT SAYS, "I have unlimited
[59:18] revenge." AND JESUS SAID, "YOU give
[59:21] unlimited forgiveness."
[59:24] &gt;&gt; You see, THAT IS ORDER OUT OF CHAOS.
[59:27] LAMECH WAS SAYING, "I AM VIOLENT AND I'M
[59:30] PROUD OF IT AND I DARE ANYONE TO COME
[59:32] AFTER ME BECAUSE I'LL BE A MORE AVENGE
[59:36] THAN CAIN EVER WAS. THE PAYBACK WILL BE
[59:39] MUCH HARDER."
[59:40] &gt;&gt; You see, IT'S ONE OF THE CLEAREST SIGNS
[59:42] THAT GENESIS IN GENESIS THAT MANKIND WAS
[59:46] SLIDING FAST TOWARD LAWLESSNESS, WHICH
[59:50] THE BIBLE SAID WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE
[59:53] LAST DAY. a spirit of lawlessness upon
[59:56] THE PEOPLE WHERE VIOLENCE BECAME CULTURE
[59:59] AND PRIDE would replace repentance.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; AND BY GENESIS 6, CHAOS HAD REACHED
[1:00:06] EVERY every level of of the every facet
[1:00:11] of human life. AND GENESIS 6 AND5 GOD
[1:00:15] SAW THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN WAS great in
[1:00:19] the earth and that the every imagination
[1:00:22] of the thoughts of his heart was on on
[1:00:26] evil continually.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; NOTICE THE LANGUAGE. EVERY IMAGINATION
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; ONLY evil continually.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; SIN WAS GLORIFIED.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; ITS EVILS JUSTIFIED. THERE WERE NO
[1:00:41] RESTRAINTS LEFT.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO REVERENCE. THERE WAS NO
[1:00:46] BOUNDARIES. THERE WAS no restraints.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Think of that the mixing of boundaries.
[1:00:53] Genesis 6:2 said he it speaks about that
[1:00:57] violation of divine boundaries. And it
[1:00:59] said it talks about the increasing
[1:01:02] corruption, confusion. It says the SONS
[1:01:04] OF GOD SAW THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN that
[1:01:07] they were fair and took them wives of
[1:01:09] which they chose. And what IS CLEAR HERE
[1:01:12] WAS GOD'S ORDER was being violated.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; And finally, the whole earth is filled
[1:01:20] with violence.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; AND GOD GIVES A FINAL ASSESSMENT IN
[1:01:25] GENESIS 6:11. THE EARTH WAS CORRUPT
[1:01:27] BEFORE GOD. AND THE EARTH WAS FILLED
[1:01:30] WITH VIOLENCE.
[1:01:32] SO IT WASN'T OCCASIONAL. IT WASN'T EVERY
[1:01:34] ONCE IN a while a little bit OF
[1:01:36] VIOLENCE. IT FILLED THE EARTH.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; SOCIETY ITSELF HAD BECOME CHAOTIC.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; IT IT WAS LAWLESS. IT WAS CRUEL. AND THE
[1:01:45] BIBLE, AS WE HAVE QUOTED IN GENESIS 6:5,
[1:01:48] HE SAW THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN WAS SO
[1:01:51] GREAT in the earth. And that every
[1:01:53] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[1:01:56] was only on evil continually.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it. as it was in the
[1:02:02] days of Noah. I want to ask you, what
[1:02:06] are your thoughts set on?
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; What are you feeding on?
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, MUCH OF THE ENTERTAINMENT
[1:02:12] today is built on cruelty,
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; violent movies,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; vicious gaming, humiliation,
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; revenge,
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; AND DARKNESS.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT THAT DOES, IT SLOWLY TRAINS THE
[1:02:27] HEART TO BECOME cold and insensitive.
[1:02:30] Because what you repeatedly watch begins
[1:02:35] to feel normal
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; even if God calls it evil.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; AND CONSTANT EXPOSURE DULLS THE
[1:02:42] CONSCIENCE UNTIL IT NO LONGER WARNS LIKE
[1:02:45] IT USED TO.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE BIBLE SAID HAVING THEIR
[1:02:49] CONSCIENCE seared with a hot IRON
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; AND IT TURNS PAIN then into spectacle
[1:02:56] INSTEAD OF SORROW. SO, YOU KNOW, IT
[1:02:58] BECOMES SOMETHING THAT that we feed on
[1:03:00] and and it and WHAT IT DOES, IT FEEDS
[1:03:03] the animal.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; IT FEEDS THE FLESH INSTEAD OF the
[1:03:07] spirit.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE TELLS YOU TO DO THE
[1:03:10] OPPOSITE OF THAT. IN ROMANS 13:14, HE
[1:03:13] SAID, "CLOTHE YOURSELF WITH THE LORD
[1:03:15] JESUS CHRIST AND DO NOT THINK ABOUT
[1:03:17] THINGS THAT GRATIFY the desires of the
[1:03:20] flesh."
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. SO ALL OF THIS IS MAKING PEOPLE
[1:03:23] FEEL A LOT LESS COMPASSIONATE,
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; making them more insensitive TOWARD REAL
[1:03:30] SUFFERING.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE BIBLE SAID THE LOVE OF MANY
[1:03:34] SHALL WAX COLD.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. As iniquity abounds because
[1:03:40] why? Little by little the soul will
[1:03:43] crave stronger stimulation.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:48] you know, AND IT GROWS HARDER UNTIL
[1:03:51] DARKNESS FEELS ORDINARY.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE BELIEVER MUST ALWAYS AS A
[1:03:56] BELIEVER, YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR HEART
[1:03:58] AND YOUR MIND AND YOU GOT TO FEED ON
[1:04:01] WHAT IS PURE, WHAT IS HOLY, WHAT IS
[1:04:03] LOVELY TO STAY TENDER in this cold, dark
[1:04:06] world. Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, you know, of one
[1:04:10] of the sober verses in the scripture in
[1:04:12] Genesis 6:6. It repented the Lord that
[1:04:16] he had made man on the earth and it
[1:04:18] grieved him at his heart. This was not
[1:04:21] God reacting in rage. He was responded
[1:04:25] in sorrow.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; CREATION HAD MOVED SO FAR FROM THE
[1:04:30] ORIGINAL PURPOSE
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; THAT ONLY RESETTING ORDER COULD PRESERVE
[1:04:35] LIFE. And I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THOUGH
[1:04:39] ONE STATEMENT. IN ALL OF THIS WORLD OF
[1:04:42] CHAOS, THERE'S ONE STATEMENT THAT THAT
[1:04:45] STANDS OUT IN GENESIS 6:8. BUT NOAH
[1:04:49] FOUND GRACE.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; NOAH FOUND GRACE.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE EYES OF THE LORD.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW DID HE DO THIS? OH MY. You
[1:05:00] see, NOAH DIDN'T SAVE THE WORLD BY FORCE
[1:05:03] OR REFORM, BUT BY WALKING WITH GOD. AND
[1:05:06] GENESIS GIVES ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
[1:05:08] STATEMENTS IN THE OF ALL THE BIBLE
[1:05:11] CONCERNING the days before the flood.
[1:05:13] And in Genesis 6:9, Noah was a just man
[1:05:17] and perfect in his generations. And Noah
[1:05:21] walked with God.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want that to be my testimony.
[1:05:26] when the world is going in CHAOS
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; THAT HE CAN FIND SOMEBODY
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; that he can say is perfect
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; IN HIS GENERATION.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY THAT IS WALKING WITH GOD IN
[1:05:39] THIS DAY AND HOUR
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; IN AN AGE IN A WORLD THAT WHEN THE WHOLE
[1:05:44] WORLD HAS SLIPPED INTO CHAOS WHERE EVERY
[1:05:47] IMAGINATION OF MAN'S HEARTS AND HIS
[1:05:49] THOUGHTS ARE ON EVIL CONTINUALLY NOAH
[1:05:52] STOOD OUT AS A WITNESS.
[1:05:55] IT TELLS ME IF GOD CAN HAVE A MAN THEN,
[1:05:58] GOD CAN HAVE MEN AND WOMEN TODAY, BOYS
[1:06:00] AND GIRLS WHO CAN STAND THE WITNESS IN
[1:06:03] THEIR AGE AGAINST WHAT IS WRONG AND WHAT
[1:06:06] FOR OR what is right.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; While everybody else followed the
[1:06:11] imagination of their heart, Noah
[1:06:14] followed revelation from God.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know how it happened. You
[1:06:19] know, sometimes it gets so dark in the
[1:06:22] world, but when again, when God speaks,
[1:06:25] revelation dawn
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; AND HE WALKS WITH GOD. AND WHEN A MAN
[1:06:29] WALKS WITH GOD, GOD PULLS HIM OUT OF
[1:06:31] CHAOS IN the age that he's LIVING IN AND
[1:06:34] PLACES HIM in his own continuity.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; And no doubt Noah learned something. I'm
[1:06:42] sure he watched the men who walked
[1:06:44] before him. Scripture tells us that
[1:06:47] Enoch walked the same path. In Genesis
[1:06:51] 5:24, Enoch walked with God and he was
[1:06:54] not. For God took him. Oh, think about
[1:06:58] it. Before before America, before the
[1:07:01] Soviet Union had astronauts in the in
[1:07:04] space, God had was not there.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. HE HAD MEN THAT WALKED WITH GOD
[1:07:11] AND WAS NOT. NOTICE HERE, HIS WALK WAS
[1:07:14] SO CLOSE. SO UNINTERRUPTED THAT HE WAS
[1:07:17] TRANSLATED OUT OF THE REALM OF DEATH.
[1:07:20] AND HEBREWS CONFIRMS IT IN 11:5. HE
[1:07:22] SAID, "BY FAITH, ENOCH WAS TRANSLATED
[1:07:25] THAT he should not SEE DEATH. FOR BEFORE
[1:07:28] HIS TRANSLATION, he had this testimony
[1:07:32] that he pleased God."
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Think about it. IF THEY COULD PLEASE GOD
[1:07:39] IN THAT EVIL AGE,
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; GOD'S GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN THIS AGE
[1:07:44] HE ALWAYS HAS A WITNESS.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; HE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'LL STAND FOR
[1:07:49] TRUTH.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; When all the world is going into
[1:07:53] deception and Enoch was a living proof
[1:07:56] that walking with God does not lead into
[1:07:59] deeper confusion. Although the world may
[1:08:02] have ridiculed him, walking with God
[1:08:04] though leads an upward divine order. And
[1:08:08] and and because he didn't he did not
[1:08:11] blend with his age. He overcame it. And
[1:08:14] Noah living in the generation after him,
[1:08:17] he had a pattern. And I tell you, I'm
[1:08:20] glad that there's men that we can look
[1:08:22] back at and we can see in that
[1:08:24] generation, they stood FOR GOD. IN THAT
[1:08:27] GENERATION, they overcame. IN THAT TIME,
[1:08:30] GOD HAD A WITNESS. BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU
[1:08:32] GOD'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE THIS AGE
[1:08:34] WITHOUT a witness.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; He going to raise up men and women
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; who will stand for for the truth, WHO
[1:08:41] WILL WALK WITH HIM. AND IN THOSE EARLY
[1:08:43] GENERATION, GOD WOULD OFTEN leave signs
[1:08:47] and testimonies and it would be even in
[1:08:50] their names. YOU SEE MARKS OF REVELATION
[1:08:53] PLACED IN FAMILY LINES. Scripture itself
[1:08:56] tells us that names carry meanings and
[1:09:00] they mean they mean they carry
[1:09:02] prophecies. Like the name given to
[1:09:04] Jesus, his name would be called Emmanuel
[1:09:07] WHICH IS SAYING GOD WITH US. You you see
[1:09:11] Enoch named his son Methuselah,
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; And that's a NAME THAT IS COMMONLY
[1:09:19] UNDERSTOOD THAT IT POINTS TOWARD
[1:09:21] JUDGMENT AND is often explained or
[1:09:24] interpreted when he dies it shall be
[1:09:28] sent or when HE DIES THE DELUGE WILL
[1:09:31] COME.
[1:09:33] SO ACTUALLY ENOCH WOULD prophesy
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; and he WOULD AND HE WOULD NAME HIS SON
[1:09:41] and say WHEN HE DIES HERE'S MY PROPHECY.
[1:09:45] SO YOU KNOW NOAH WATCHED ELITH'S
[1:09:49] prophecy
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; which was METHUSELAH
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SEE THE GOD WAS WARNING THE
[1:09:56] WORLD LONG BEFORE THE FLOOD EVER FELL
[1:09:59] BECAUSE GOD IS MERCIFUL EVEN IN
[1:10:01] JUDGMENT.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; He never seen sins judgment without a
[1:10:05] warning first. And the scripture
[1:10:08] declares this mercy real clear. Said
[1:10:11] Methuselah, because we know Methuselah
[1:10:14] lived longer than any other man AS AS
[1:10:18] THOUGH GOD STRETCHED TIME OUT TO THE
[1:10:21] LIMIT. HE WAS GIVING SPACE TO REPENT.
[1:10:24] For the Bible said in SECOND PETER 3:9
[1:10:27] THAT GOD'S NATURE IS like this. The Lord
[1:10:30] is longsuffering
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; toward usward, NOT WILLING THAT ANY
[1:10:35] SHOULD PERISH, BUT THAT ALL SHOULD COME
[1:10:38] TO REPENTANCE.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE LONGSUFFERING OF GOD THAT WE'RE
[1:10:42] EVEN HERE TODAY.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; I think we're on borrowed time.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S BEEN GOD'S LONGSUFFERING TO
[1:10:50] HOLD OFF THE JUDGMENT OF THE WORLD
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; TO GET EVERY NAME THAT'S IN THE LAMB'S
[1:10:55] BOOK OF LIFE
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'LL NOT CLOSE THE BOOK. HE
[1:10:59] WILL NOT FINISH IT UNTIL EVERY NAME HAS
[1:11:02] BEEN DIPPED IN BLOOD AND THAT HE CAN
[1:11:05] RAPTURE a people off of the earth.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; I want to be among that number. Don't
[1:11:09] you?
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; You know, Jewish tradition also says
[1:11:14] that when Methuselah died that on the
[1:11:17] day he died, Noah entered in the ark.
[1:11:20] And after the seven days of mourning
[1:11:22] were finished, then judgment came. You
[1:11:25] see, when God shut the door, there was
[1:11:28] no longer any mercy. There was judgment
[1:11:32] that was being sealed. In Genesis 7:4,
[1:11:35] it does MENTION, "FOR YET SEVEN DAYS,
[1:11:37] and I will cause it to rain upon the
[1:11:39] earth." But on that seventh DAY SPAN WAS
[1:11:42] GOD'S FINAL COUNTDOWN TO JUDGMENT. AND
[1:11:46] IT WASN'T AN OPEN INVITATION ONCE THE
[1:11:49] DOOR WAS CLOSED. LET ME TELL YOU
[1:11:51] FRIENDS, ONE DAY THE DOOR WILL BE
[1:11:54] CLOSED.
[1:11:55] AND THE CLOSING OF THE DOOR IN THAT DAY.
[1:11:58] WHEN GOD SHUT THE DOOR, IT WAS NOT NOAH
[1:12:00] GOING IN AND SHUT THE DOOR. GOD SHUT THE
[1:12:02] DOOR.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD SHUT THE DOOR, IT WAS THE
[1:12:06] DIVIDING LINE. JUST LIKE JESUS TAUGHT IN
[1:12:08] THE PARABLE OF THE VIRGINS. THE
[1:12:09] BRIDEGROOM CAME and the virgins that
[1:12:12] were ready went in with him to the
[1:12:14] wedding and the door was shut.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; You see, God gave space of repentance
[1:12:19] until the day that Noah entered the ark.
[1:12:22] But when Noah went in and the Lord shut
[1:12:25] the door, the day of mercy was over and
[1:12:29] then judgment was set in motion.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And when God takes his bride home, when
[1:12:34] he takes his people out of here, mercy
[1:12:37] for the Gentile dispensation is over.
[1:12:40] And that's the real warning we want to
[1:12:42] understand today. There comes a MOMENT
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SEALS his decision. Right.
[1:12:48] AMEN.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT MAN CALLED DELAY WAS ACTUALLY
[1:12:52] GOD'S LONGSUFFERING
[1:12:54] WAITING BEFOREHAND. BUT AFTER THE DOOR
[1:12:56] SHUT is no longer waiting time.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible cleared the is clear. The B
[1:13:01] the world is not heading toward
[1:13:03] improvement. It's heading toward
[1:13:06] judgment fire.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Peter 3:10 says, "THE DAY
[1:13:12] OF THE LORD WILL COME in which the
[1:13:15] HEAVENS SHALL PASS AWAY WITH a great
[1:13:18] noise, and the ELEMENTS SHALL MELT with
[1:13:21] a fervent heat, the earth also, and the
[1:13:23] works that are therein shall be BURNED
[1:13:25] UP." SO JUST AS THE ANTIDOLIVIAN
[1:13:29] WORLD WAS JUDGED BY WATER, this present
[1:13:33] world is reserved for fire.
[1:13:37] AND SECOND PETER 3:7 SAID, "THE HEAVENS
[1:13:40] AND THE EARTH WHICH ARE NOW ARE KEPT IN
[1:13:43] STORE, RESERVED UNTIL THE fire at the
[1:13:46] day of judgment."
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; So just as in Noah's day, there's a
[1:13:50] divine order in the end time program.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. First God removes his own, takes a
[1:13:57] bride away, and then judgment begins.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus SAID WE SHOULD PRAY
[1:14:03] ALWAYS
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; TO BE COUNTED WORTHY
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; TO ESCAPE THE THINGS THAT ARE COMING on
[1:14:09] the earth.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND ENOCH WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE
[1:14:13] FLOOD. THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THE
[1:14:16] BRIDE WILL BE RAPTURED BEFORE THE
[1:14:18] TRIBULATION.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE ENOCH WAS RAPTURED FIRST
[1:14:23] and then the world went into judgment
[1:14:25] AND THE TRIBULATION SAINTS WENT THROUGH
[1:14:27] the judgment with Noah. SO, ENOCH WALKED
[1:14:30] WITH GOD and he was not for God took
[1:14:33] him. That's Genesis 5:24. But Noah was
[1:14:36] preserved through the wrath as he says
[1:14:38] in Genesis 7:1. Come thou and all thine
[1:14:42] house into the ark. And once Noah
[1:14:45] entered, GOD SHUT THE DOOR. AND THE LORD
[1:14:50] SHUT HIM IN. THE BIBLE SAID, AND THIS IS
[1:14:53] A TYPE OF THE CLOSING OF MERCY.
[1:14:57] WHEN GOD SHUTS THE DOOR, NO MAN CAN OPEN
[1:15:00] IT.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SHOWED THAT SAME REALITY WE'VE
[1:15:04] ALREADY QUOTED IN THE PARABLE OF THE
[1:15:05] VIRGINS. AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT. AND HE
[1:15:07] WARNED IN MATTHEW 24:37, "AS IN THE DAYS
[1:15:11] OF NOAH, so shall it be in the c so
[1:15:15] shall be the coming of the son of man."
[1:15:17] So there's coming a moment when the
[1:15:21] bride is taken
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; and the gentile age is close and
[1:15:26] SCRIPTURE IT SHOWS THE CHURCH GATHERED
[1:15:30] IN AND THEN GOD TURNS HIS dealings again
[1:15:33] and watch Romans 11:25 blindness in part
[1:15:38] has happened to Israel until the
[1:15:41] fullness of the Gentiles become in.
[1:15:44] THAT'S RIGHT. SO, GET THE POINT. YOU
[1:15:48] SEE, THEY'RE BLIND FOR A SEASON,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; BUT WE HAVE A TIME LIMIT on us,
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S CALLED THE FULLNESS OF THE
[1:15:58] GENTILES.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; And once that's completed,
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; the gospel turns back to the Jews.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT FULLNESS IS IS COMPLETE,
[1:16:08] THEN GOD SHIFTS AND THE DOOR SHUTS. THE
[1:16:10] BRIDE IS GONE AND JUDGMENT BEGINS.
[1:16:14] And when Enoch leaves, Noah enters.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; And God does not judge the his people
[1:16:20] with the world. Instead, he makes a way
[1:16:22] of escape.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And that's the pattern that we see over
[1:16:26] and over again. A translation before
[1:16:29] wrath, an arc provision for the remnant,
[1:16:33] then judgment falls. But I want you to
[1:16:36] get the scripture. I want you to hold
[1:16:38] this tight in your heart because we are
[1:16:40] seeing pre-tribulation plagues coming
[1:16:42] upon the earth. And we are seeing evil
[1:16:45] as it comes in reflecting the days of
[1:16:47] Noah where the hearts of men are evil
[1:16:50] continually. BUT FIRST THESSALONIANS 5
[1:16:53] AND9 GIVES US A PRECIOUS PROMISE. GOD
[1:16:56] HATH NOT APPOINTED US to wrath.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; BUT TO OBTAIN SALVATION, DELIVERANCE BY
[1:17:04] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; I'm glad for that PROMISE TODAY THAT WE
[1:17:09] HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT WHEN THE WORLD GOES INTO
[1:17:14] COMPLETE CHAOS AND WILL GUL INTO TOTAL
[1:17:17] DARKNESS, THERE will be a bride called
[1:17:19] out of there
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; into his marvelous light and a rapture.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; And today we are watching the prophetic
[1:17:27] stage set itself. We see Israel is back
[1:17:31] in the land just as the prophet spoke.
[1:17:34] All the word of God spoke of this. We
[1:17:36] see the world is ripening in violence.
[1:17:39] We see the corruption. We see the
[1:17:41] lawlessness just as in Noah's day while
[1:17:44] the age gets darker and darker but in
[1:17:46] this very time there is a people THERE
[1:17:50] IS A BRIDE that is being called to
[1:17:51] readiness
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; for the revelation chapter 22:17 said
[1:17:56] and the SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY COME
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; AND EPHESIANS 5:27 SAYS THAT HE COME
[1:18:03] THAT HE MIGHT PRESENT IT TO HIMSELF A
[1:18:06] GLORIOUS CHURCH
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN THAT SHOULD HOLY AND WITHOUT
[1:18:11] BLEMISH BEFORE HIM.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So I want you to look around.
[1:18:16] This is not random. This is not politics
[1:18:19] only. This is prophesy moving.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; It's a bride preparing. It's a It's a
[1:18:25] remnant being positioned. It's a WORLD
[1:18:28] THAT HAS REJECTED the word THAT HAS
[1:18:30] THORN UP WRATH FOR THE DAY WHEN THE
[1:18:32] HEAVENS WILL burn with a fervent heat.
[1:18:35] And that's why the message today is
[1:18:38] urgent.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Get into Christ now.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Very important.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAKE READY BECAUSE WHEN GOD SHUTS
[1:18:47] THE DOOR,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; it'll be too late
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; to almost believe.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Noah's message is simple, but it's a
[1:18:59] mighty message.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; In a world of chaos, it's still possible
[1:19:02] to walk with God.
[1:19:04] And when God gives revelation,
[1:19:07] that revelation becomes an arc of
[1:19:09] safety.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; AND NOT BECAUSE THE WORLD GROWS BETTER,
[1:19:13] BUT BECAUSE THE MAN WHO WALKS WITH GOD
[1:19:15] HAS FOUND DIVINE ORDER IN THE MIDST OF A
[1:19:18] COLLAPSING CIVILIZATION.
[1:19:21] Genesis 6:8, Noah found grace in the
[1:19:24] eyes of the Lord.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; So the flood, THE FLOOD WAS GOD
[1:19:30] RESTORING ORDER. IT WAS GOD'S GREAT
[1:19:32] RESET. to the earth. You see, IT WAS GOD
[1:19:37] CLEANSING CHAOS IN GENESIS 6:13. AND GOD
[1:19:41] SAID TO NOAH, "THE END OF ALL FLESH IS
[1:19:45] COMING before me." And you see, water
[1:19:49] returned temporarily to Genesis 1:2
[1:19:53] condition without form and void so that
[1:19:57] God could preserve life through one man
[1:20:00] and began all over again.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; AND FROM ADAM TO THE FLOOD, GOD'S WORD
[1:20:06] WAS DOUBTED. FELLOWSHIP WAS BROKEN. SIN
[1:20:11] MULTIPLIED.
[1:20:13] VIOLENCE FILLED THE EARTH.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; BOUNDARIES WERE ERASED. LIFE LOST ITS
[1:20:18] VALUE. CHAOS RULED.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; AND YET EVEN THEN, GOD PRESERVED THE
[1:20:24] SEED.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; HOW DID HE DO IT? BY SENDING A MESSAGE.
[1:20:28] BY GIVING A WORD,
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; A SURE WORD OF PROPHECY.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT WOULD PRODUCE LIGHT IN
[1:20:36] THE DAY THAT THEY WERE LIVING AND GIVE
[1:20:38] THEM A WAY OF ESCAPE.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; The flood was not the end. It was God
[1:20:43] once again bringing order out of chaos.
[1:20:46] It was proven that when man destroys
[1:20:48] himself, God still remembers mercy. But
[1:20:51] Noah found grace.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's always been God's way.
[1:20:58] If you can look, you can watch it after
[1:21:00] the flood from from Babel to Abraham, we
[1:21:04] see the same unchanging truth. God does
[1:21:07] not repair rebellion. He separates from
[1:21:10] it.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Never in all the moves of God did he
[1:21:13] repair the rebellion. He separates from
[1:21:16] it. WHEN HE CALLED LUTHER OUT, HE DID
[1:21:19] NOT RE REPAIR the rebellious church, the
[1:21:22] the Catholic church. HE HE CALLED THE
[1:21:24] PEOPLE OUT. WHEN THE LUTHERAN REBELLED
[1:21:27] AND TURNED THEIR MUSIC, THEIR MOVEMENT
[1:21:29] INTO CHAOS, ONCE AGAIN, GOD CALLED THE
[1:21:32] PEOPLE OUT. AND THAT WAS TRUE OF WESLEY.
[1:21:35] THAT WAS TRUE OF ISUZA STREET. BUT IN
[1:21:37] THIS LAST DAYS, THE CALL OF SEPARATION
[1:21:40] COMES EVEN LOUDER. IT IS THE CALL TO
[1:21:43] LEAVE FOR TO STAY MEANS YOU ARE GOING TO
[1:21:45] RECEIVE THE PLAGUES. In Revelation 18
[1:21:48] and4, AND I HEARD ANOTHER VOICE FROM
[1:21:51] HEAVEN SAYING, "Come out of her, my
[1:21:54] people, that you be not partakers of her
[1:21:57] sins,
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; and that you receive not of her
[1:21:59] plagues."
[1:22:01] And whenever the word is received, his
[1:22:04] people come out.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; And when they come out, order is
[1:22:08] restored
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; and purpose then is clarified. and a
[1:22:12] people are formed to become a body who
[1:22:16] walks in alignment with him.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE HAS DONE
[1:22:20] FOR US IN THIS LAST DAY. THE SPIRIT OF
[1:22:22] GOD MOVED, THE WORD SPOKE, LIGHT SPRUNG
[1:22:26] UP, AND IT AND IT BROUGHT TO ORDER
[1:22:28] SCRIPTURE THAT HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN THE
[1:22:31] DARKNESS.
[1:22:32] AND THEN COMES SEPARATION FROM THE
[1:22:35] DARKNESS. AND OUT OF THE CHAOS, SEEDS OF
[1:22:38] GOD SPRING TO LIGHT. Now in that day,
[1:22:42] Abraham was a seed that was called out
[1:22:44] of chaos of of the chaos of Babylon to
[1:22:48] go to a land of promise. Now later his
[1:22:51] seed would leave that land and would go
[1:22:53] down into Egypt. And Israel lived down
[1:22:56] in Egypt for more than 400 years. In the
[1:23:01] days of Joseph, they were blessed and
[1:23:03] they were protected and they were
[1:23:05] dwelling in the choice land of Gan. And
[1:23:08] there was order and provision and favor.
[1:23:11] But the scripture tells us in Exodus
[1:23:14] 1:8, there arose a new king over Egypt
[1:23:16] who knew not Joseph.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN JOSEPH'S TESTIMONY was
[1:23:21] forgotten,
[1:23:23] Satan got into the mix and THE PEOPLE OF
[1:23:26] GOD WERE REDUCED TO SLAVES. AND ONCE
[1:23:29] AGAIN, ORDER gave way to chaos
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; and bondage would replace blessings. AND
[1:23:37] FEAR REPLACED FAVOR. AND THEIR LIVES NOW
[1:23:40] WERE CRUSHED UNDER THE TASKMASTERS. AND
[1:23:43] THE BIBLE SAID THEY CRIED AND THEIR CRY
[1:23:46] CAME UP before God. Oh, I want you to
[1:23:49] understand God hears when YOU CRY.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; JUST AS THE BEGINNING OF CREATION, WHEN
[1:23:55] THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED ON THE FACE OF
[1:23:57] THE WATERS, GOD MOVED AGAIN.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; AND THIS TIME, HE WASN'T MOVING OVER
[1:24:03] OCEANS. HE WASN'T MOVING OVER THE SEAS
[1:24:07] AND AND AS THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED, BUT
[1:24:09] AS THE SPIRIT MOVED, HE WAS MOVING OVER
[1:24:12] A NATION, A NATION THAT WAS TRAPPED IN
[1:24:15] BONDAGE.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; AND IN A WILDERNESS PLACE, HE REVEALS
[1:24:18] HIMSELF TO MOSES IN A BURNING BUSH, A
[1:24:22] SACRED LIGHT THAT BLAZED. AND THAT FLAME
[1:24:25] WAS MORE THAN A WONDER. IT WAS A LIGHT
[1:24:27] BREAKING INTO DARKNESS. IT WAS GOD'S
[1:24:30] PRESENCE STEPPING DOWN INTO CHAOS.
[1:24:34] That fire, THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, that
[1:24:37] flame was a light in that time of
[1:24:39] darkness.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD STEPPING DOWN INTO HUMAN
[1:24:44] CHAOS. From that pillar of fire, from
[1:24:47] that light came a living word.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. A word that was alive, A WORD THAT
[1:24:53] HAD POWER IN IT, A MESSAGE OF
[1:24:55] DELIVERANCE. And God said in Exodus 3:7
[1:24:58] and 8, I have surely seen the affliction
[1:25:01] OF MY PEOPLE AND I HAVE come down to
[1:25:05] deliver them.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH MY. I HAVE COME DOWN.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; GOD STEPPING INTO THEIR CHAOS.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THAT MOMENT, THE GOD WHO ONCE
[1:25:19] SAID, "LET there be light," spoke again.
[1:25:23] And his word began to bring order where
[1:25:25] chaos had reigned. What was it doing? It
[1:25:28] was God MOVING HISTORICAL PROMISES
[1:25:30] forward by his voice.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Watch this very carefully because this
[1:25:35] is what God does. HE STEPS DOWN INTO
[1:25:38] CHAOS. He did it by sending a prophet.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. What's he doing it for? to bring
[1:25:44] the light, the word that was spoken to
[1:25:47] Abraham and his seed that would sojourn
[1:25:50] in a strange land that be afflicted and
[1:25:52] that with a mighty hand he would bring
[1:25:54] him out. That prophecy HAD LAID DORMANT
[1:25:56] FOR 400 YEARS.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW WHAT IT WAS NOT WHAT HAD BEEN A
[1:26:01] PROPHECY ON ABRAHAM'S LIP NOW BECAME A
[1:26:05] PRESENT TENSE ACT OF GOD.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And the word was quickened and released
[1:26:10] from God. AND WHEN IT'S RELEASED AND GOD
[1:26:13] BREATHED, IT IS SET INTO MOTION. AND
[1:26:15] WHAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN GOD'S
[1:26:17] FORNOWLEDGE IS NOW COMING INTO REAL
[1:26:20] manifestation
[1:26:22] in real time.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Because when God speaks in any
[1:26:26] age, the promise stops being something
[1:26:29] distance in the far past and starts
[1:26:32] becoming deliverance.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; That word was not only for Israel. It
[1:26:37] was spoken over the power of Egypt.
[1:26:41] Oh yeah.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; IT WAS SPOKE OVER THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; THAT IT THAT IT GOT THEM INTO THIS CHAOS
[1:26:48] THAT IT HELD THEM CAPTIVE. AND THAT WORD
[1:26:51] SAID TO SATAN, "LET MY PEOPLE GO."
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; God's word confronted the bondage. It
[1:27:00] broke the ITS AUTHORITY. AND I'LL TELL
[1:27:03] YOU, THAT'S WHAT IT'LL DO FOR YOU TODAY.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS STEPPED DOWN.
[1:27:09] AND I'M TELLING YOU BY THIS MESSAGE THIS
[1:27:11] MORNING, GOD IS STEPPING DOWN INTO YOUR
[1:27:13] CHAOS,
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; THE CHAOS THAT SATAN HAS BROUGHT IN YOUR
[1:27:18] LIFE. AND HE'S PUTTING SATAN ON NOTICE.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; LET MY PEOPLE GO.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; THOSE IN BONDAGE, THOSE ENSLAVED IN SIN,
[1:27:28] ENSLAVED IN PORNOGRAPHY, ENSLAVED IN
[1:27:30] SEXUAL VICES, ENSLAVED IN IN ADDICTIONS
[1:27:34] TO GAMING OR DOPE OR ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER
[1:27:37] IT IS. GOD STEPS OUT OF SILENCE ONCE
[1:27:40] AGAIN.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; AS THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES AND SPEAKS IN
[1:27:44] THE CHAOS, SAYING, "LET THERE be light."
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, the Bible, the
[1:27:51] Bible is clear. When he comes and steps
[1:27:53] into chaos,
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Death leads, sickness leads, SIN
[1:27:57] LEADS, THE POWERS OF HELL ARE BROKEN. AS
[1:28:00] THE MESSAGE is released, IT SAYS, "LET
[1:28:03] MY PEOPLE GO."
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THOSE BOUND WITH HEART
[1:28:07] TROUBLE OR ARTHRITIS OR CHILDREN
[1:28:10] CONDEMNED TO BONDAGE WITH GENETIC
[1:28:12] DISORDERS. YOU KNOW, LET ME TELL YOU,
[1:28:15] FROM A PILLAR OF FIRE COMES A MESSAGE.
[1:28:18] FROM A LIGHT COMES A MESSAGE. I HAVE
[1:28:21] COME DOWN. I HAVE HEARD THE CRY OF MY
[1:28:24] PEOPLE. I HAVE SEEN YOUR SUFFERING. I
[1:28:27] KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. I
[1:28:29] ACKNOWLEDGE, BUT I'M DOING MORE THAN
[1:28:31] ACKNOWLEDGE IT. I'M STEPPING INTO YOUR
[1:28:33] chaos
[1:28:35] and I'M GOING TO BRING ORDER INTO YOUR
[1:28:37] LIFE. I'M GOING TO CHANGE YOU FROM
[1:28:39] DARKNESS INTO LIGHT AGAIN. AMEN. THIS IS
[1:28:43] A MESSAGE TO ALL THE OPPRESSORS THAT
[1:28:45] WILL HOLD GOD'S PEOPLE BOUND. AND IT
[1:28:47] SAYS, "LET MY PEOPLE GO." DEVILS, HEAR
[1:28:50] IT LOUD AND CLEAR TODAY. AMEN. THOSE
[1:28:53] THAT ARE BOUND, THOSE THAT ARE
[1:28:54] TORMENTED, THOSE THAT ARE OPPRESSED, LET
[1:28:57] MY PEOPLE GO.
[1:29:04] WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S GOD STEPPING down
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; into chaos
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; to bring order.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; He's reaching out to the prodals.
[1:29:16] Satan, that wicked taskmaster forced
[1:29:19] them into sin.
[1:29:21] And I'll tell you, the message of today
[1:29:24] is apply the token of the blood
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; of Christ to your house. Gather in the
[1:29:30] house. Don't leave from under the
[1:29:33] protection of the blood.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Stay under its protection. Are you
[1:29:36] hearing me?
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. ROAST THE LAMB WITH FIRE. GET ONE
[1:29:41] BIG ENOUGH FOR YOUR FAMILY.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO JUST TELL YOU, IF YOU GOT
[1:29:46] PRODALS OUT THERE,
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; better get a bigger ONE
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PRODALS ARE BEING RELEASED FROM
[1:29:55] BONDAGE.
[1:30:00] HE'S NOT JUST GETTING YOU WHO ARE CHURCH
[1:30:02] MEMBERS FREE.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; HE'S REACHING OUT.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; IF HE HAS TO GO TO THE HIGHWAYS AND THE
[1:30:08] BYWAYS
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; TO THE HAWK, THE LAME, THE BLIND, HE
[1:30:13] WILL DO IT ALL. HE'S GOING TO GET HIS
[1:30:15] ELECT.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; HIS tables will be full because you and
[1:30:19] let me tell you again, your prodals are
[1:30:22] being released.
[1:30:31] OH, I FEEL THE WITNESS OF THE HOLY
[1:30:33] Spirit today. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. YOUR
[1:30:36] RADICALS are being released.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; For the message from the pillar of fire
[1:30:45] warned Satan, "Let my people go
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; and let me prophesy,
[1:30:54] your loved ones are coming home.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; The last call comes to those in the
[1:31:00] streets, the highways, the bike byways,
[1:31:03] and Satan may have warped them.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; He may have crippled them. He may have
[1:31:08] blinded them. But the call is all one
[1:31:11] and the same. come home.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride say
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; come. And right now God is awakening
[1:31:19] prodals.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; And what's HE SAYING TO HIM? AMEN. HE IS
[1:31:24] SAYING there is food in the father's
[1:31:27] house.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; THERE'S IT'S ENOUGH. YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH
[1:31:31] OF EATING WITH THE SWINE.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT BRINGS AN URGE IN THE HEARTS
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; OF EVERY PRODAL.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING'S HAPPENING. IS SAYING, "I'M
[1:31:43] GOING HOME."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; AND THE ANGELS ARE STIRRING OUR HEARTS
[1:31:48] NOW. OH, COME YOU SINNERS, lost and
[1:31:51] lonely. Jesus blood can MAKE YOU FREE.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; OH, WE HAVE SO MANY THAT CAN TESTIFY.
[1:31:59] For he saved the worst among us when he
[1:32:02] saved a wretch like me.
[1:32:04] I'll tell you what, looking over this
[1:32:07] audience today, looking to over men and
[1:32:10] women, it comes to my mind even right
[1:32:11] now. Let me tell you, if he can save
[1:32:13] Elizabeth,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; he can save you.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES, HE BRINGS
[1:32:20] chaos into order.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY SHE PUSHED HER
[1:32:25] WHEELCHAIR UP TO THE ALTAR,
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; SAYING, "I'M THROUGH WITH SIN.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; I'M THROUGH WITH FEELING SORRY FOR
[1:32:32] MYSELF. I'M THROUGH WITH THIS
[1:32:34] AFFLICTION. I WILL NOT SIT IN THIS
[1:32:37] WHEELCHAIR AGAIN. AND GOD TOOK THAT
[1:32:39] CHAOS OUT OF HER LIFE AND MADE A NEW
[1:32:42] CREATION WITHIN HER WITH A PURPOSE THAT
[1:32:46] INSTEAD OF BEING A BURDEN TO LIFT other
[1:32:48] burdens.
[1:32:51] AND NOW HER TESTIMONY IS BEAR YOU ONE
[1:32:54] ANOTHER'S BURDENS AND SO FULFILL the law
[1:32:57] of Christ.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Showing the love of Christ to other.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister Liz. Amen. It's
[1:33:03] the transforming power of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I know.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, I know.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[1:33:13] clean.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; But look what happened with Israel. IT
[1:33:18] WAS NOT JUST AN escape from Egypt, but
[1:33:20] it was a transformation.
[1:33:23] Think of it. HE TOOK A NATIONS OF SLAVES
[1:33:26] and began to form them into a people of
[1:33:29] divine order.
[1:33:31] Given them his law, his presence, his
[1:33:33] covenant. A scripture SAYS IN PSALMS
[1:33:36] 105, HE BROUGHT THEM OUT to give them
[1:33:39] lands of the heathen. You see, this is
[1:33:41] God's pattern. When his people are
[1:33:44] crushed by chaos, he moves by his
[1:33:47] spirit. He releases his word. AND WHEN
[1:33:50] GOD SPEAKS, DELIVERANCE BEGINS.
[1:33:54] AND THEN THAT'S WHEN CHANGE FALLS AND
[1:33:57] THAT'S WHEN ORDER IS RESTORED.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Now we know we could go through the
[1:34:01] history and I I do want to give you a
[1:34:03] little history today
[1:34:06] and today Sunday is a day where we take
[1:34:09] Sunday morning service and Sunday night
[1:34:11] we put them together. We have one
[1:34:13] service because many of us travel from a
[1:34:15] distance. But I just want to speak to
[1:34:17] you for a moment about Israel.
[1:34:20] Israel walked
[1:34:22] in the order of God's word and he
[1:34:25] enjoyed the blessings that flowed from
[1:34:27] it.
[1:34:29] God blessed them and brought them to a
[1:34:32] land flowing with milk and honey.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; They built homes. They planted
[1:34:37] vineyards. They raised families that
[1:34:39] lived under protection and provision
[1:34:42] that obedience brings.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; And and the Bible speaks of it in
[1:34:47] Deuteronomy 6:24. The Lord commanded us
[1:34:50] to do all these statutes for our good
[1:34:52] always. And where the WORD IS HONORED,
[1:34:55] THERE'S ALWAYS PEACE.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; There's stability. There's increase when
[1:35:00] the word is honored.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Yet even a good lamb, sin nature still
[1:35:06] dwelt in the heart of man. And it's the
[1:35:10] law that was given could not restrain
[1:35:13] behavior because well it couldn't truly
[1:35:17] restrain it because it couldn't change
[1:35:19] the heart. AND SLOWLY ISRAEL WOULD
[1:35:22] DRIFT. AND THE BIBLE IS SUMMITED UP IN
[1:35:25] JUDGES 21:25
[1:35:27] that every man
[1:35:30] THEN DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES.
[1:35:34] And from THE TIME OF THE JUDGES THROUGH
[1:35:37] THE ERAS of the king, Israel would move
[1:35:40] in cycles. Orders to order, blessings,
[1:35:45] rebellion, chaos, order, blessings,
[1:35:49] rebellion, chaos. It was a cycle of
[1:35:52] revival and death. God would send a
[1:35:55] prophet. The people would repent
[1:35:58] and order would be restored for a
[1:36:00] generation, but their children or maybe
[1:36:02] their grandchildren would turn away and
[1:36:04] chaos would return.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; It was a vicious cycle. And I just want
[1:36:09] to say this is a cycle we must break
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; because Satan is trying his best to
[1:36:15] infiltrate the message with fallen
[1:36:17] angels
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; because fallen angels f, you know, they
[1:36:21] they follow every move.
[1:36:24] And and you can see it where the same
[1:36:26] thing happens. You know, it happens
[1:36:28] again and again through the ages. And
[1:36:30] Israel would experience this over and
[1:36:32] over again. And eventually God revealed
[1:36:36] through Isaiah how far things had
[1:36:40] fallen.
[1:36:42] You you see they had worship THAT HAD
[1:36:45] CONTINUED RIGHT ON ALL THEIR FORMS. They
[1:36:48] had their temples AND SYNAGOGUES AND SO
[1:36:51] ON. BUT LIFE WAS GONE.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; SACRIFICES WERE STILL BEING OFFERED. BUT
[1:36:57] HEARTS WERE FOLLOWING FAR AWAY FROM GOD.
[1:37:00] THE LORD SAID IN ISAIAH 1:11, "TO WHAT
[1:37:04] purpose is this multitude of your
[1:37:07] sacrifices unto me, sayeth the Lord?"
[1:37:10] Look at WHAT HE SAID. I AM FULL OF THE
[1:37:12] BURNT OFFERINGS OF RAMS AND THE FAT OF
[1:37:15] FED BEASTS. AND I DELIGHT NOT IN THE
[1:37:18] BLOOD OF BULOCKS or lambs or hegoats.
[1:37:23] OH, HE WOULD GO ON DOWN IN VERSE 13 AND
[1:37:25] SAY, "BRING NO MORE VAIN OF OBLATIONS.
[1:37:29] INCENSE HAS BECOME IS AN ABOMINATION TO
[1:37:32] ME." LOOK AT WHAT HE'S SAYING. WHAT WHAT
[1:37:35] HAD ONCE BROUGHT ORDER HAD NOW BECOME A
[1:37:38] STENCH in his nostrils
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WORSHIP HAD TURNED INTO RITUAL.
[1:37:46] That's right.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; I want you to get this.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Satan had made it appealing though. It
[1:37:55] looked like order,
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; but it was chaos.
[1:38:01] IT WAS REFINED. IT WAS STRUCTURED. IT
[1:38:03] WAS IMPRESSIVE TO THE EYE, BUT IT WAS
[1:38:06] EMPTY of life.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; THE SINCERITY WAS GONE IN THEIR WORSHIP.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; IT HAD just become a custom. Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; A RITUAL, A HABIT OF THEIRS.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; This is what we do. We're Jewish people.
[1:38:22] This is what Moses commanded. And it no,
[1:38:24] it all lost its meaning.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; And let's see how far they fell into
[1:38:30] chaos in 2 Chronicles 36:15.
[1:38:33] And the Lord God of their fathers sent
[1:38:35] to them by his messengers, rising up the
[1:38:39] times and sending because he had
[1:38:41] compassion on his people and on his
[1:38:43] dwelling place. But they mocked the
[1:38:46] messengers of God. They despised his
[1:38:49] words. They misused his prophets until
[1:38:53] the wrath of the Lord rose against his
[1:38:56] people until there was no remedy. Amen.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Therefore he brought upon them the king
[1:39:03] of the Caldes WHO SLEW THEIR YOUNG MEN
[1:39:06] with the sword in the house of their
[1:39:08] sanctuary and the church and had no
[1:39:12] compassion upon young man or made an old
[1:39:15] man or him that stooped for age. He gave
[1:39:18] them all into his hands. and the
[1:39:20] vessels, THE SACRED VESSELS OF THE HOUSE
[1:39:24] of God, GREAT AND SMALL, THE TREASURES
[1:39:26] OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD, AND THE
[1:39:28] TREASURES OF THE KING AND OF HIS
[1:39:29] PRINCES. ALL THESE HE BROUGHT TO
[1:39:32] BABYLON, AND THEY BURNT THE HOUSE OF
[1:39:34] GOD, AND BREAK DOWN THE WALL OF
[1:39:36] JERUSALEM, AND BURNT ALL THE PALACES
[1:39:38] THEREOF WITH FIRE, AND DESTROYED ALL THE
[1:39:40] GOODLY VESSELS THEREOF. And them that
[1:39:43] escaped from the sword carried he away
[1:39:45] into Babylon, and they were they were
[1:39:48] made servants to him and his sons and
[1:39:50] and his sons until the reign of the
[1:39:53] kingdom of Persia.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; So let's look at this for a moment.
[1:39:59] Something happened
[1:40:01] because
[1:40:03] worship had been turned to rituals.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAID, "YOU'LL NOT STAY IN MY
[1:40:10] LAMP." ALL RIGHT.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; You see, YOU CANNOT REPLACE THE POWER IN
[1:40:18] THE PRESENCE OF God with rituals.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; FORMALITY CAN NEVER TAKE ITS PLACE.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN JUDAH WAS CARRIED AWAY IN THE
[1:40:29] BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY, the temple was
[1:40:31] destroyed and the sacrifices ceased and
[1:40:34] the priestly system could no longer
[1:40:36] function as God had ordained it. And
[1:40:38] with no altar, no priesthood operating
[1:40:41] in fullness and no central place of
[1:40:43] worship. The Jews were forced to adapt.
[1:40:47] And during this time, there were
[1:40:49] gatherings for prayer and scripture
[1:40:50] reading, instruction begin to form. And
[1:40:53] the earliest roots of what later became
[1:40:55] the synagogues.
[1:40:58] And while Israel was in Babylonian
[1:40:59] captivity, being that there was no
[1:41:02] temple to worship in, Solomon's temple
[1:41:04] had been destroyed and the people
[1:41:06] carried away far from their homeland to
[1:41:08] a strange land with strange influence.
[1:41:11] AND THE PSALMIST WOULD CRY, "HOW SHALL
[1:41:13] WE SING THE LORD'S song in a strange
[1:41:16] land?"
[1:41:17] And sacrificial worship could no longer
[1:41:20] continue because God had placed it in
[1:41:23] the temple alone.
[1:41:25] And in this setting there was a serious
[1:41:28] danger that they saw and it was a loss
[1:41:31] of Jewish IDENTITY AND SURROUNDED BY THE
[1:41:34] BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY culture and in that
[1:41:38] captivity the you the culture the
[1:41:40] language and religion. There was a
[1:41:42] growing fear that the future generations
[1:41:44] would forget the law of Moses and the
[1:41:46] ways of God. To combat this, there arose
[1:41:49] a need to teach the scripture, to
[1:41:51] preserve the law, to pass on Jewish
[1:41:53] customs to the young. And out of this
[1:41:56] necessity developed the synagogues and
[1:41:59] that synagogue means, it's a word that
[1:42:01] means bring together.
[1:42:03] And these were not temples, BUT THEY
[1:42:05] WERE GATHERING PLACES for prayer, for
[1:42:08] reading of the scripture and
[1:42:09] instruction.
[1:42:10] And I I WANT YOU TO WATCH NOW WHAT FORMS
[1:42:13] NOW after they get down into into
[1:42:16] Babylon because it really patterns the
[1:42:18] CHURCH BECAUSE THE CHURCH WOULD ALSO
[1:42:21] STAY AWAY and would also be taken down
[1:42:24] into Babylon
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; into darkness through the dark AGES AND
[1:42:29] GOD WOULD START A PROCESS of
[1:42:31] restoration. AND SO IN THIS, YOU KNOW,
[1:42:34] THERE WOULD BE in influential religious
[1:42:36] GROUPS THAT WOULD RISE DURING THIS TIME,
[1:42:39] MOST NOTABLY the Pharisees.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; We've all heard of them. Pharisees were
[1:42:45] devout layman and scribes and and
[1:42:48] teachers who were deeply committed to
[1:42:51] preserving Israel's identity through the
[1:42:54] strict observance of the law.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; And initially, it was a sincere desire
[1:42:59] to do good. It was commendable. And the
[1:43:02] scripture EVEN USES A POWERFUL EXAMPLE
[1:43:04] OF THIS IN NEHEMIAH 8:8. And they read
[1:43:08] in the book of the law distinctly and
[1:43:10] gave the sense and cause them to
[1:43:13] understand the reading.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE THIS WAS THIS WAS THE WAY
[1:43:18] THAT IT WAS. THEY would read the law
[1:43:21] distinctly give the sense and cause them
[1:43:24] to understand what they were reading.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND AT FIRST THE WRITTEN TORAH
[1:43:30] GIVEN THROUGH MOSES WAS HONORED.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; But however, over time a shift occurred,
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; prominent teachers that were later
[1:43:40] called rabbis. They rose to authority.
[1:43:42] And these men were not prophets. And
[1:43:45] they WERE NOT ANOINTED BY GOD. THEY WERE
[1:43:47] NOT LED BY THE SPIRIT. BUT they were
[1:43:48] trained through study and intellectual
[1:43:52] mastery of the law. In other words, they
[1:43:55] had been the seminary
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; AND AS THEY TAUGHT, THEY IN they
[1:44:00] increasingly inserted their own
[1:44:02] interpretations
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; and opinions and applications into the
[1:44:07] scriptures. And these teachings passed
[1:44:09] on DOWN FROM RESPECTED elders became
[1:44:13] known as oral tradition. So you have the
[1:44:16] written law, what the Bible says and
[1:44:20] then what the church says.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:24] And eventually these TRADITIONS WERE
[1:44:27] ELEVATED TO THE SAME AUTHORITY AS THE
[1:44:30] WRITTEN word of God.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; UNTIL EVEN TODAY in Christianity is not
[1:44:39] what the Bible said.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; It says but my church says
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; are you with me? Amen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; AND THIS BECAME THE TRADITION OF THE
[1:44:52] ELDERS and they they've elevated IT TO
[1:44:55] THE SAME AUTHORITY AS THE written word
[1:44:58] of God.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; NOW IN PRACTICE THE WORDS OF MAN began
[1:45:02] to carry equal sometimes greater weight
[1:45:05] than the words of God himself. And Jesus
[1:45:07] he when he came he rebuked this plainly
[1:45:10] in Matthew 15:6. Thus thou hath made the
[1:45:14] commandment of God of none effect by
[1:45:17] your tradition. Amen.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT BEGAN AS AN EFFORT TO PROTECT
[1:45:22] GOD'S WORD SLOWLY BECAME A SYSTEM where
[1:45:26] man's interpretation carried divine
[1:45:29] authority
[1:45:31] AND PROPHETIC REVELATION WAS REPLACED
[1:45:34] WITH INTELLECTUAL CONTROL
[1:45:37] AND THE SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP WAS
[1:45:39] EXCHANGED FOR SCHOLASTIC authority
[1:45:43] and scripture was preserved but its
[1:45:45] power was neutralized. All right.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; And this was the DANGER THAT JESUS
[1:45:50] CONFRONTED. THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE
[1:45:52] SCRIPTURE.
[1:45:54] IT WAS NOR TEACHING NOR ORDER. IT WAS
[1:45:56] ORDER WITHOUT REVELATION.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; LEARNING WITHOUT LIFE. AND IN THAT
[1:46:02] CONDITION, RELIGION NO LONGER OPENED THE
[1:46:04] WAY TO GOD. IT BECAME A BARRIER THAT
[1:46:06] ONLY CHRIST HIMSELF COULD BREAK THROUGH.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus, the living word,
[1:46:11] stepped into that system. AND HE DIDN'T
[1:46:13] COME TO ABOLISH THE LAW, BUT to restore
[1:46:15] it to its original purpose.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND, CHURCH, WE CANNOT HAVE A NEW
[1:46:21] BIBLE.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE CAN'T OH, NO. YOU YOU SAY,
[1:46:26] "WELL, WE GOT WE GOT THE MESSAGE AND WE
[1:46:28] GOT THE BIBLE." NO, WE GOT THE WORD OF
[1:46:29] GOD.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE THE WORD OF GOD. HE DIDN'T
[1:46:35] DIDN'T COME TO ABOLISH THE BIBLE
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; OR TO SET IT ASIDE,
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; BUT TO RESTORE IT TO ITS ORIGINAL
[1:46:42] PURPOSE TO LEAD A PEOPLE BACK TO LIVING
[1:46:45] FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; NOW, when Nehemiah rebuilt the temple,
[1:46:50] the Sadducees rose to power because
[1:46:53] first when they come back, there's no
[1:46:55] temple. So they rebuilt a temple and
[1:46:57] then and there they set up an order of
[1:46:59] priest where these were Sadducees and
[1:47:02] they were mostly hereditary priests and
[1:47:05] wealthy elites and many of them would
[1:47:07] hold political power and after the exile
[1:47:11] that the high priest became both a
[1:47:14] religious and political leader because
[1:47:16] they had no king. So these these
[1:47:18] Sadducees and the high priests would
[1:47:21] become the political authority of the
[1:47:23] nation co you know cooperating with
[1:47:26] foreign rulers especially Rome to
[1:47:28] maintain authority and AND THE SADDUCEES
[1:47:31] CONTROLLED THE TEMPLE ECONOMY. They deni
[1:47:34] and AND AND THEY DENIED THE
[1:47:37] RESURRECTION. THEY DENIED the existence
[1:47:39] OF ANGELS. THEY DENIED THE SPIRITS. THEY
[1:47:42] DENIED, LISTEN, THEY DENIED THE
[1:47:44] SUPERNATURAL totally and they reduced
[1:47:47] faith to administration and control.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; And together with the Essenes, the the
[1:47:55] separate group, THESE SECTS FORMED A
[1:47:58] RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE of Israel. And this
[1:48:00] is the chaos that Jesus stepped into.
[1:48:07] HE STEPS IN THE CHAOS
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; THAT MAN IS CALLING
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; ORDER.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; AND GOD STEPS INTO THE CHAOS
[1:48:23] OF RELIGION AND MAN'S ORDER.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; TO BRING A PEOPLE OUT OF THE CHAOS
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; into his order.
[1:48:34] Hallelujah.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to see this
[1:48:38] because these scribes, Pharisees,
[1:48:41] Sadducees, temple worship, these great
[1:48:44] synagogues, respected rabbis, holy men,
[1:48:49] Levites. To the people, this looked like
[1:48:52] order.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; It looked like structured worship,
[1:48:55] learned teachers, respected
[1:48:58] institutions. Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; The school of Galia, the school of this
[1:49:02] one, the school of that one.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Each got their diploma, THEIR DEGREES
[1:49:08] FROM THIS AND THAT,
[1:49:10] BUT TO God it was chaos.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; MAN WAS CALLING IT ORDER AND GOD
[1:49:20] RECOGNIZED IT AS CHAOS.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SPOKE PLAINLY THIS CONDITION.
[1:49:27] AND I WANT YOU TO SEE IT IN MATTHEW
[1:49:29] 23:13.
[1:49:30] HE SAID, "WOE TO YOU SCRIBES and
[1:49:33] Pharisees, hypocrites."
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Which literally means actors,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU SHUT UP THE KINGDOM OF heaven
[1:49:45] against men.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; And you NEITHER GO IN YOURSELVES,
[1:49:50] NEITHER SUFFER YOU, OR ALLOW YE them
[1:49:52] that are entering to go in.
[1:49:56] You actually are keeping men out of the
[1:49:58] kingdom.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; You're claiming to be the way, THE
[1:50:03] TRUTH, THE LIFE.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE CLAIMING TO BE THE GATE TO
[1:50:08] HEAVEN, AND YOU'RE STANDING AT THE DOOR
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; keeping people out.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Now, friends, that's God's indictment of
[1:50:17] religious systems today
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; of what men calls order. Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Scribes provided the legal
[1:50:25] interpretation enforcement.
[1:50:27] And I want to just look you see how did
[1:50:30] these go wrong? How did they bring
[1:50:32] chaos? The problem wasn't the the their
[1:50:36] knowledge of the scripture. It was how
[1:50:37] they used it.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus never accused them of ignorance.
[1:50:41] He accused them of misuse.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; They replaced revelation with
[1:50:47] interpretation.
[1:50:50] I I WANT YOU to get something, church.
[1:50:53] WE CANNOT RELY ON HUMAN INTELLECT.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; We must each ONE OF US HAVE A PERSONAL
[1:51:02] EXPERIENCE WITH GOD.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; AND BE LED BY REVELATION.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THEY REPLACE REVELATION with
[1:51:11] interpretation. They analyze the
[1:51:13] scripture, but they no longer heard
[1:51:16] God's voice.
[1:51:18] And Jesus said to them, "You search the
[1:51:20] scripture and and you will not come to
[1:51:22] me that you might have life.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; You're you're you're going all through
[1:51:26] the scripture. YOU'RE READING YOUR BIBLE
[1:51:27] DAILY. YOU'RE YOU YOU KNOW IT WELL. YOU
[1:51:30] YOU'RE SCHOLARS. YOU'RE ALL OF THIS. BUT
[1:51:32] YOU WILL NOT COME TO ME."
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; That you might have life.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; You see, RELIGION
[1:51:42] HAD COME LIKE THIS. IT HAD PRODUCED
[1:51:44] CHURCHES THAT KNEW THE TEXT.
[1:51:48] BUT MISSED THE PERSON IT TESTIFIED OF.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; AND RELIGION HAD BECOME A BARRIER
[1:51:56] INSTEAD OF A DOORWAY.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; AND RELIGION WAS WHICH WAS MEANT TO LEAD
[1:52:00] PEOPLE TO GOD HAD BEEN BECOME THE VERY
[1:52:03] thing that was keeping people away. So
[1:52:06] he said, and I repeat it again in
[1:52:08] Matthew 23:13, "But woe to you scribes
[1:52:12] and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you shut
[1:52:16] up the kingdom of heaven against men,
[1:52:18] and you neither go in yourselves,
[1:52:21] neither suffer ye them that are that are
[1:52:24] entering to go in."
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; You see, the scribes and and the
[1:52:29] Pharisees didn't say, "The kingdom of
[1:52:31] God ain't real." They just control who
[1:52:33] could get in it.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; And instead of LEADING PEOPLE TO GOD,
[1:52:37] THEY PUT UP RULES AND REQUIREMENTS. THEY
[1:52:39] DIDN'T SAY TO COME TO GOD JUST AS YOU
[1:52:41] ARE. ASK for ask forgiveness and let God
[1:52:44] change you. They they were saying, fix
[1:52:46] yourself.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Fix yourself first and then God will
[1:52:50] accept you.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; And Jesus TOLD HIM, YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY
[1:52:54] THE KEY of knowledge. AND THAT KEY WAS
[1:52:58] AN EDUCATION. IT WAS revelation and
[1:53:01] experience of knowing who God really is.
[1:53:05] YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY WE PREACH EXPERIENCE
[1:53:08] at this church.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT JUST EDUCATION.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; I can show you IN THE BIBLE. I SAY,
[1:53:15] "WELL, THIS IS RIGHT. THIS IS WRONG."
[1:53:16] WHAT? BUT RE REALLY FRIEND, NOTHING WILL
[1:53:19] REPLACE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH GOD
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; WHERE GOD HAS MADE KNOWN PERSONALLY TO
[1:53:25] YOU as an individual. AMEN.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; SO BY LIFTING THEIR TRADITIONS UP TO THE
[1:53:30] SAME LEVEL AS GOD'S WORD, THEY MADE GOD
[1:53:33] SEEM far away and hard to reach. And
[1:53:35] instead of a kingdom being a life that
[1:53:37] people could step into, that became a
[1:53:39] complicated system that people had to
[1:53:42] figure out.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Go through this catechism and this one
[1:53:45] and say this rosary for this and pray to
[1:53:47] this one there and this and that. And
[1:53:50] neither do you go in yourselves.
[1:53:53] And Jesus said
[1:53:55] something even more serious. He said,
[1:53:57] "You're not just blocking others. You
[1:53:59] ain't never even went in yourself.
[1:54:01] You're not even saved."
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; And these were men who study.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Can I bring it down?
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE MEN WHO STUDY THE MESSAGE
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; BUT REJECT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE NEW
[1:54:13] BIRTH.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW THE QUOTES, BUT THEY'VE NEVER
[1:54:16] HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH GOD THEMSELVES.
[1:54:19] AND THEY REFUSE PENTECOST BECAUSE IT'S
[1:54:21] AT PENTECOST THAT GOD REALLY ENTERS THE
[1:54:24] HEART.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Herod the Great would later later
[1:54:31] rebuild it and expand the temple into a
[1:54:34] magnificent structure. It was one of the
[1:54:37] wonders of the ancient world. And but I
[1:54:40] want to tell you something about it.
[1:54:42] There was no record of the glory of God
[1:54:46] filling it.
[1:54:49] And yet THEY HAD THE SHELL OF RELIGION
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF GOD.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL WOULD SAY IT LIKE THIS, HAVING
[1:55:01] A FORM OF GODLINESS
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; BUT DENYING THE POWER THEREOF.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; AND AT THIS POINT, THE WORD DELIVERED BY
[1:55:08] MOSES WAS NO LONGER FOLLOW FLOWING
[1:55:10] THROUGH PROPHETIC INSPIRATION BUT
[1:55:12] THROUGH INTELLECTUAL INTERPRETATION.
[1:55:17] And Jesus said
[1:55:20] in John 5:39, "You search the
[1:55:23] scriptures, for in them you think you
[1:55:24] have eternal life, and they are they
[1:55:27] that testify of me." And men believe
[1:55:29] they were bringing order. But when man
[1:55:31] made systems replace divine revelation,
[1:55:34] confusion and chaos follows. Yeah.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Now after the return of of of from
[1:55:40] Babylon under Zerubabel, Ezra, Nehemiah,
[1:55:44] SECOND TEMPLES REBUILT, HEROD EXPANDED
[1:55:46] IT, BEAUTIFIED IT. Yet there WAS
[1:55:49] SOMETHING AS I'VE SAID ALREADY
[1:55:51] NOTICEABLY absent and I want to dwell on
[1:55:54] this a minute. THERE IS NO BIBLICAL EX
[1:55:57] record of the Shana glory returning to
[1:56:00] fill the holiest of holies.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:05] NO, THE STRUCTURE STOOD THE THE RITUALS
[1:56:08] RESUMED. THE SACRIFICE WAS LAW OFFERED.
[1:56:11] BUT THE MANIFEST PRESENCE OF GOD DID NOT
[1:56:14] DESCEND.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; YEAH. If something unmistakably was
[1:56:21] absent.
[1:56:22] No kind of glory. Never to feel the
[1:56:25] holiest of holies. In fact, WHEN JESUS
[1:56:29] AT HIS DEATH, IT WAS WRITTEN TO BY THE
[1:56:32] HAND OF GOD, IT SHOWED THERE WAS NO GOD
[1:56:34] THERE.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; EMPTY, VOID.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; The whole SYSTEM HAVE WENT INTO CHAOS.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; In Moses tabernacle, the Bible said the
[1:56:48] cloud covered the tent of the
[1:56:50] congregation and the glory of the Lord
[1:56:52] filled the tabernacle. Amen.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; IN SOLOMON'S TEMPLE, THE CLOUD FILLED
[1:56:56] THE HOUSE of the Lord. For the glory of
[1:56:59] the Lord had filled the house. But after
[1:57:01] the exile, THERE WAS NO CLOUD. THERE WAS
[1:57:03] NO FIRE. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE
[1:57:05] MANIFESTATION OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD.
[1:57:07] THE HOUSE STOOD. THE RITUALS CONTINUED.
[1:57:09] THE SACRIFICES YOU WERE DONE DAILY. BUT
[1:57:12] THE GLORY DID NOT DESCEND.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; And yet God has spoke a prophecy of this
[1:57:21] house.
[1:57:23] that seemed impossible.
[1:57:27] Let's look at this prophecy. Hagi 2
[1:57:29] and9.
[1:57:31] The glory of this latter house
[1:57:35] SHALL BE GREATER than Solomon's temple,
[1:57:38] the former.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; SAYAETH THE LORD OF HOSTS.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; This wasn't man saying it. God was
[1:57:44] saying it.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; AND IN THIS PLACE WILL I GIVE PEACE,
[1:57:49] SAITH the Lord of hosts.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:53] Look at this.
[1:57:55] God said, "This house is going to be
[1:57:56] greater than Solomon's."
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; How could this be? Well, when Ezra and
[1:58:06] Nehemiah made it, it was small and
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; pald in comparison. It was nothing in
[1:58:11] comparison to Solomon's. It It lacked
[1:58:13] the gold. It lacked the splendor. IT
[1:58:16] LACKED THE ARK.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; It lacked the visible glory.
[1:58:21] AND BY EVERY NATURAL MEASURE IT WAS
[1:58:23] INFERIOR.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; So it looks impossible.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know God was not
[1:58:30] speaking of architectural glory.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; THE GLORY OF THIS LATTER HOUSE WOULD NOT
[1:58:35] BE FOUND IN STONE OR GOLD OR RITUAL. AND
[1:58:39] IT WOULD NOT COME AS A CLOUD OF GLORY
[1:58:41] FILLING THE ROOM. RIGHT?
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD, IT WOULD BE THE FULLNESS OF GOD
[1:58:46] HIMSELF.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; WOULD COME TO SIN AND GATHER INTO A
[1:58:51] HUMAN BODY.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; COLOSSIANS 2:9 SAID, "FOR IN HIM
[1:58:56] DWELLETH ALL THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD
[1:59:00] BODILY."
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, the glory walked in.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; I want to say it again. THE GLORY WALKED
[1:59:08] IN
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; STEPPING INTO THE CHAOS. OF MAN'S
[1:59:12] RELIGION,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; OF A CHURCH EMPTY OF GOD,
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; full of rituals.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS ENTERED THAT TEMPLE AND HE
[1:59:23] SPOKE THERE AND HE TAUGHT THERE AND HE
[1:59:26] HEALED THERE AND YES, HE BROUGHT ORDER
[1:59:28] THERE AND HE PLANTED A WHIP AND HE DROVE
[1:59:31] OUT THE MONEY CHAMBER AND HE HAD
[1:59:32] CHANGED. HE SAID, "MY HOUSE SHALL BE
[1:59:35] CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER."
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was God bringing order,
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; STEPPING INTO THE CHAOS,
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; of what man called order of religious
[1:59:52] systems,
[1:59:54] of renowned churches. And he's stepping
[1:59:57] right in the midst
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; and he's bringing order.
[2:00:04] And Malachi 3:1 said, "The Lord whom you
[2:00:07] seek shall suddenly come to his temple."
[2:00:10] And he did.
[2:00:13] Hallelujah. I say he did.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; And in that place, he said, "I will give
[2:00:18] peace."
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; PEACE WAS NO LONGER SOME ABSTRACT
[2:00:22] PROMISE. PEACE NOW STOOD IN FLESH AND
[2:00:25] BONE.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH. ISAIAH 9:6.
[2:00:29] UNTO US A CHILD IS BORN. UNTO US A SON
[2:00:32] IS GIVEN. AND THE GOVERNMENT SHALL BE
[2:00:34] UPON HIS SHOULDER. AND HIS NAME SHALL BE
[2:00:36] CALLED WONDERFUL AND COUNSELOR. AND THE
[2:00:38] MIGHTY GOD, THE EVERLASTING FATHER, THE
[2:00:41] prince of peace.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Peace stepped in to the religious
[2:00:47] systems of the day.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you though, tragedy
[2:00:52] followed revelation.
[2:00:58] The pe the prince and his peace that
[2:01:01] would bring order to their chaos was
[2:01:03] rejected.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to KNOW THIS WAS THE CLOSING
[2:01:09] OF THE GENT JEWISH DISPENSATION THAT
[2:01:11] IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LEO THE LAST CHURCH AGE SHOWS
[2:01:17] HIM ON THE outside
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; not inside.
[2:01:26] And a church that is so smug and sure of
[2:01:30] themsself that says I'm rich. I'm
[2:01:33] increased with goods. God, I don't need
[2:01:36] you
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; yet to have the ritual, the structure,
[2:01:42] the wealth, but not God.
[2:01:48] You see, he was the cornerstone the
[2:01:50] builders rejected.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Somebody with me? Psalms 118:22, the
[2:01:56] stone which the builders refused is
[2:01:59] become the head stone of the corner.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; He came to his own covenant people. And
[2:02:06] and JOHN SUMMARIZES A TRAGEDY of Israel
[2:02:10] in one heartbreaking sentence where HE
[2:02:12] SAYS IN JOHN 11, HE CAME TO HIS OWN
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; AND HIS OWN RECEIVED HIM NOT. AMEN.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; It repeats again in the last church age.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW JESUS DIDN'T COME TO
[2:02:30] STRANGERS. HE CAME TO HIS OWN COVENANT
[2:02:33] PEOPLE.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; THE NATION THAT HAD THE PROMISES, THE
[2:02:37] NATION THAT HAD THE PROPHETS, THE
[2:02:38] NATIONS THAT HAD THE SCRIPTURES, THE
[2:02:40] TEMPLE, THE HISTORY OF GOD'S DEALING.
[2:02:42] AND WHEN HE ARRIVED,
[2:02:45] Israel had a religious system that was
[2:02:47] so firmly in place with scribes,
[2:02:49] Pharisees, Sadducees,
[2:02:53] men highly esteemed as teachers of the
[2:02:55] law, just like today, except they're
[2:02:58] called Catholic and Methodists, and
[2:02:59] Baptists, and so on and on. But instead
[2:03:03] of leading the people to a living truth,
[2:03:05] they exalted tradition and
[2:03:07] interpretation above the written word of
[2:03:10] God.
[2:03:11] And Jesus exposed this plainly. He said
[2:03:14] in Matthew 15 and6, "Thus you have made
[2:03:18] the commandments of God of none effect
[2:03:20] by your tradition."
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; What did he do verse 9 say of teaching
[2:03:24] for doctrines of commandments of men.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE TRAGEDY WASN'T THEY THAT
[2:03:30] THEY LACKED SCRIPTURE. They had plenty
[2:03:32] of it. And yeah, TODAY EVEN TODAY BIBLES
[2:03:35] ARE EVERYWHERE.
[2:03:36] YES.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; AND THE TRAGEDY WAS THEY HAD REPLACED
[2:03:40] REVELATION with regulation AND THE WORD
[2:03:42] WAS NOW BURIED UNDER THE TRADITION OF
[2:03:45] THE ELDERS.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; They sat in Moses' seat and yet refused
[2:03:50] to recognize the one that Moses wrote
[2:03:52] about. And Jesus said IN JOHN 5:46, "HAD
[2:03:56] YOU BELIEVED MOSES, you would have
[2:03:58] believed me,
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; for he wrote of me."
[2:04:03] So at the close of Israel's
[2:04:05] dispensation,
[2:04:07] many stood smug and satisfied with
[2:04:10] man-made religion, CONTENT WITH THE
[2:04:13] SHELL OF ORDER while missing the
[2:04:15] presence of God.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Listen what I'm talking about. I want
[2:04:21] you to hear this plainly. They chose
[2:04:23] systems
[2:04:25] over the savior.
[2:04:31] And Peter later later would say it
[2:04:33] plainly HE WOULD SAY YOU DENIED THE HOLY
[2:04:36] ONE AND JUST AND YOU KILLED THE PRINCE
[2:04:39] OF LIFE.
[2:04:41] AND HERE'S a sovereign TRUTH THAT WE AS
[2:04:43] WE ALREADY QUOTED THE STONE THAT THE
[2:04:45] BUILDERS REJECTED THE SAME BECOME THE
[2:04:48] HEAD OF THE corner and they REJECTED THE
[2:04:51] LIVING WORD NOT BECAUSE HE HAD NO LIGHT
[2:04:53] BUT BECAUSE HIS LIGHT EXPOSED THEIR
[2:04:56] DARKNESS.
[2:04:59] And in choosing formal formal religion
[2:05:02] they perceived as order over Christ
[2:05:05] himself. They fulfilled the scripture
[2:05:06] where it says he came to his own and his
[2:05:09] own received him not. And the Bible said
[2:05:13] the same pattern will repeat. Just as
[2:05:16] Israel rejected him at the end of the
[2:05:18] Jewish age, Leodysia will do the same at
[2:05:21] the close of the Gentile age. They'll be
[2:05:24] rich in structure
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; but poor in presence lacking the
[2:05:29] presence of God.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; And that lesson is very sobering and one
[2:05:35] we want to consider today. A church
[2:05:37] cannot stand
[2:05:42] cannot truly stand on God's word
[2:05:46] without the presence of God.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Worship can continue without
[2:05:50] revelation. Religion can FUNCTION WHILE
[2:05:53] REJECTING CHRIST HIMSELF. OH, RELIGION
[2:05:56] RIGHT WENT RIGHT ON. EVEN WHEN THEY
[2:05:59] CRUCIFIED HIM, THEY WENT RIGHT NEXT DAY
[2:06:01] WITH THEIR SAME RITUALS.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The greatest danger is not the
[2:06:08] absence of religion, but the rejection
[2:06:10] of the very glory that God sends.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; And history shows us that Satan does not
[2:06:15] destroy the work of God by removing the
[2:06:17] structure. He corrupts it by replacing
[2:06:19] the presence. He will do anything he can
[2:06:23] to replace THE PRESENCE.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; WORSHIP ALL YOU want to
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; as long as you're empty of the presence.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Raise your hands and shout. As long as
[2:06:37] you're empty of the presence.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Satan don't care how religious you are.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; He don't care how right you are in your
[2:06:46] doctrine. IF YOU MISS THAT LIFE, YOU
[2:06:49] MISSED EVERYTHING.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody with me? And that's the danger.
[2:06:55] THE DANGER IS NOT THAT THE MESSAGE
[2:06:57] MOVEMENT WILL WILL LACK BUILDINGS OR
[2:06:59] ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE or publishing
[2:07:01] HOUSES OR TEACHING. OH, THERE'LL BE
[2:07:03] PLENTY of them. There will BE VOICES AND
[2:07:06] INTERPRETATIONS and leaders and each
[2:07:08] will BE CONVINCED THAT THEIR VERSION is
[2:07:10] the represents the the proper ORDER JUST
[2:07:13] AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS of the Pharisees
[2:07:15] AND THE SADDUCEES. THE MESSAGE WILL BE
[2:07:18] FRAGMENTED into camps.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Each group believing IT HAS THE CORRECT
[2:07:26] UNDERSTANDING, THE RIGHT STRUCTURE, THE
[2:07:28] TRUE FORM. YET FORM WITHOUT LIFE has
[2:07:32] never preserved truth.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Matthew 23 27, you are like whited
[2:07:40] supplers.
[2:07:42] This is why brother Brandham calls them
[2:07:44] morgs,
[2:07:46] which indeed appear beautiful outward,
[2:07:49] but are full within full of dead men's
[2:07:52] bones.
[2:07:54] What do you say of them? They let down
[2:07:57] the bars. The goats came in, took over.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; The choice, the cry of joy was gone. The
[2:08:02] freedom of spirit was gone. They kept on
[2:08:04] with form. But the fire had died down.
[2:08:07] The blackness of ashes is all about
[2:08:09] that's left.
[2:08:13] But let me just tell you, it will not be
[2:08:17] the quotes,
[2:08:20] Bible verses
[2:08:22] that are rejected.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; It will NOT BE THE STRUCTURE OF religion
[2:08:30] that will be rejected.
[2:08:34] It will be the glory
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; that will be rejected.
[2:08:41] THE HOLY GHOST HIMSELF, THE TOKEN WILL
[2:08:44] BE PUSHED OUTSIDE THE CHURCH.
[2:08:49] Once again, I repeat, the greatest
[2:08:51] danger is not the absence of religion
[2:08:53] because Leodysia is very religious, but
[2:08:56] the great danger is a rejection of the
[2:08:58] very glory that God sends. And that's
[2:09:01] the danger that is facing this movement
[2:09:04] like it has every other movement is
[2:09:06] rejecting the glory, the token, the
[2:09:09] life, the power.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Revelation 3 20 says, "Behold, I stand
[2:09:17] at the door and knock."
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; And I want you to think about this for a
[2:09:21] moment. Christ is knocking, but that
[2:09:24] knocking don't mean revival.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; IT MEANS EXCLUSION.
[2:09:29] THAT CHRIST, THE ANOINTING, THE HOLY
[2:09:31] GHOST IS EXCLUDED FROM THE WORSHIP.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; THE FIRE IS GONE. ASHES IS ALL THAT'S
[2:09:38] LEFT. A REMINDER OF A PAST MOVE OF GOD.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Oh God, don't let our God become history
[2:09:46] to us.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Don't let miracles become historical.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS, WHAT DID HAPPEN, WHAT ONCE
[2:09:53] DID. COME ON, SOMEBODY. WE'VE GOT TO
[2:09:55] HAVE A PRESENT DAY GOD WHERE THE GLORY
[2:09:58] IS REVEALED AND THE POWER OF GOD IS
[2:10:01] DESCENDS INTO THE CHURCH AND not just
[2:10:03] the church but into hearts.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, the church will still
[2:10:08] function. People are still gathered.
[2:10:10] Rituals continue. Methods will remain
[2:10:12] and easy belieism
[2:10:15] will replace transformation
[2:10:18] and order will be defined by comfort
[2:10:21] rather than by conviction.
[2:10:25] I'm trying to hurry and I want to get
[2:10:27] but I want to get some things this
[2:10:28] morning
[2:10:30] because we have a grand conclusion that
[2:10:33] I want to make
[2:10:35] but Peter Timothy said they have a form
[2:10:37] of godliness denying the power thereof.
[2:10:41] You see what once came as a holy fire be
[2:10:45] will be
[2:10:48] listen to me carefully.
[2:10:50] I want to say this very plainly. Will
[2:10:53] you hear me? Wake up your neighbor.
[2:10:56] Say, "Listen now just a minute.
[2:11:00] What once came as holy fire
[2:11:04] will be redefined as disorder.
[2:11:13] What once came as holy fire
[2:11:17] will be redefined
[2:11:19] as disorder.
[2:11:21] The baptism of the Holy Ghost once
[2:11:24] welcomed as God's purifying presence
[2:11:28] will be mocked, restrained
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; and dismissed as excess and disorderly
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; and its gifts sheld, sheld and
[2:11:39] forgotten.
[2:11:43] THEY WILL THINK THE HOLY GHOST BAPTISM
[2:11:45] THAT DESCENDED LIKE FIRE THAT CONSUMES
[2:11:49] SIN NATURE AND FEELS BELIEVERS UNTIL
[2:11:51] THEY SHOUTED THE GLORY OF GOD IN OTHER
[2:11:53] TONGUES to be disorder
[2:11:56] and chaos
[2:11:58] and will mock it and deride it and
[2:12:01] reject the Holy Ghost. And I'm not even
[2:12:04] talking about denominational movements
[2:12:06] anymore
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; because the last place he'll be rejected
[2:12:11] is among those who are saying message
[2:12:14] message.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; And soon what was once an eagle's nest
[2:12:22] with eiglets becomes a nest for chickens
[2:12:25] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[2:12:28] bird.
[2:12:31] unconverted people sitting in the pews
[2:12:34] because the new birth
[2:12:38] was rejected.
[2:12:42] But let me tell you something, friends.
[2:12:45] I I I just want you to understand THAT
[2:12:48] IN ALL OF THIS, GOD IS NOT GOING TO
[2:12:51] LEAVE A PEOPLE
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; in chaos.
[2:12:56] BECAUSE EVEN THEN IN ACTS CHAPTER 2,
[2:12:58] THERE APPEARED UNTO THEM CLOVEN TONGUES
[2:13:01] LIKE AS A FIRE AND THEY WERE ALL FILLED
[2:13:03] WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; SO THE ORIGINAL CHURCH WAS NOT WITHOUT
[2:13:08] THE GLORY.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ARE YOU WITH ME?
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH IT NOW. AMEN.
[2:13:16] EZRA'S TEMPLE. AMEN. NEHEMIAH'S TEMPLE.
[2:13:19] HEROD'S TEMPLE. IT NEVER HAD THE GLORY.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHEN JESUS CAME IN, THE GLORY
[2:13:27] PERSONIFIED IN HUMAN FLESH, THEY
[2:13:29] REJECTED HIM.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; AND SO WILL THEY REJECT HIM TODAY. BUT
[2:13:33] LET ME TELL YOU,
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; he was not done.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; He was going to step into a temple of
[2:13:39] humanity where the glory would be
[2:13:42] revealed in human flesh,
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; not in temples made with hands.
[2:13:53] That same spirit who consumes through
[2:13:55] the sin nature feel believers with
[2:13:59] divine life
[2:14:01] though will be rejected in favor of
[2:14:03] man's control.
[2:14:05] Human order will replace divine
[2:14:08] leadership
[2:14:09] and resisting the spirit they will turn
[2:14:12] the message of God into confusion.
[2:14:17] But we're at the end.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; There is no more messengers coming.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; No additional church ages,
[2:14:27] no final reform to restore the scripture
[2:14:30] order.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; This time God will not correct the
[2:14:34] system.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; HE WILL CALL THE PEOPLE OUT OF IT.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; IN A RAPTURE.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. 1 THESSALONIANS 4 SAID THAT WE
[2:14:43] WHICH ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN SHALL BE
[2:14:45] CAUGHT UP TOGETHER TO BE WITH TOGETHER
[2:14:47] with them to meet the Lord in THE AIR
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; WHERE OUT OF CHAOS
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; IN THE GLORY.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; SO YEAH, WE WILL SEE THE WHOLE MOVEMENT
[2:14:56] GO DOWN IN THE DARKNESS BUT OUT OF THERE
[2:14:59] GOD WILL CALL A PEOPLE out
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; because God will always have a witness.
[2:15:06] out of an age that rejected the
[2:15:09] presence, they'll be caught up into
[2:15:11] eternal order where the Holy Ghost
[2:15:12] reigns forever and disorder will never
[2:15:14] enter again.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; But let me talk about it for a moment.
[2:15:21] God's order always flows from his
[2:15:23] spirit, not from organizational control.
[2:15:28] And this was the chaos that Jesus was
[2:15:30] born in.
[2:15:33] organized religion without revelation,
[2:15:37] law without life. In other words, the
[2:15:39] word without life, STRUCTURE WITHOUT
[2:15:42] SPIRIT, AUTHORITY GIVEN BY MAN INSTEAD
[2:15:45] OF GOD. So it was authority without the
[2:15:47] presence.
[2:15:49] And into that confusion stepped the
[2:15:52] living word. And the word was made flesh
[2:15:55] and dwelt among us. Now I want you to
[2:15:58] get this. Jesus did not come to patch
[2:16:01] the system.
[2:16:04] He didn't COME TO MAKE THE PHARISEES A
[2:16:06] BETTER group of people and a greater
[2:16:10] church or the Sadducees.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. HE DIDN'T COME TO
[2:16:15] PATCH THE SYSTEM. HE CAME TO RESTORE
[2:16:18] DIVINE ORDER.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; He healed the sick.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; He forgave sins. HE CAST OUT DEVILS. HE
[2:16:25] SPOKE WITH AUTHORITY THAT WAS NOT
[2:16:27] DERIVED FROM MAN'S TRADITION, BUT FROM
[2:16:29] HEAVEN ITSELF. And where RELIGION HAD
[2:16:32] CONFUSED, HE CLARIFIED. WHERE SYSTEM HAD
[2:16:35] BOUND MEN, HE SET THEM FREE. AND WHEN
[2:16:38] GOD WHAT GOD OR WHAT MEN CALLED ORDER,
[2:16:41] GOD CALLED IT CHAOS. AND WHERE CHAOS
[2:16:44] RULED, THE WORD STEPPED IN TO restore
[2:16:48] life. And his life was divine order.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; That's why we got to have the Holy Ghost
[2:16:54] in our midst
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; because without it is chaos. Amen.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; If his spirit is not the life of a
[2:17:01] movement, it's chaos. Now, by the time
[2:17:05] Jesus was born, this was the condition
[2:17:08] that Israel was in. Beautiful temple in
[2:17:10] Jerusalem, largest in the world. But
[2:17:14] confusion reigned in the hearts of men.
[2:17:17] Religion was organized, but truth was
[2:17:20] buried under tradition.
[2:17:22] THE THE PHARISEES AND THE SADDUCEES
[2:17:25] REPRESENTED WORKS WITHOUT LIFE, DOCTRINE
[2:17:27] WITHOUT REVELATION, RELIGION WITHOUT
[2:17:29] POWER. And that's the kind of religion
[2:17:31] that God hates is religion without
[2:17:34] power.
[2:17:36] And Jesus said unto himself in Matthew
[2:17:39] 15:8, "This people draweth nigh to me
[2:17:42] with their mouth, but their hearts are
[2:17:45] far from me."
[2:17:50] But at that time, God stepped directly
[2:17:53] into their chaos.
[2:17:56] To human reasoning,
[2:17:58] it just looked like chaos.
[2:18:03] His method LOOKED SCANDALOUS.
[2:18:06] IT LOOKED DISORDERLY. EVEN AN UNMARRIED
[2:18:09] VIRGIN
[2:18:10] ESPOUSED TO A MAN,
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; OVERSHADOWED BY THE HOLY GHOST, BRINGING
[2:18:15] FORTH A CHILD. ALL RIGHT.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; TO FORM A RELIGION. THIS WAS
[2:18:21] INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; This was but this was not confusion.
[2:18:27] This was God restoring order. IN
[2:18:31] GALATIANS 4:4, WHEN the when the
[2:18:33] fullness of time was come, God sent
[2:18:35] forth his son.
[2:18:38] YOU SEE, HEAVEN WAS NOT IMPROVISING
[2:18:41] HAPHAZARDLY. It was executing an eternal
[2:18:44] plan. AND GOD WAS INTRODUCING NOW A NEW
[2:18:47] PRIESTHOOD,
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; A NEW SACRIFICE, A NEW ATONEMENT,
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; THE REALITY OF WHICH THE OLD SYSTEM HAD
[2:18:55] ONLY BEEN A SHADOW. BECAUSE HEBREWS 10:1
[2:18:57] SAID, "FOR THE LAW HAVING BEEN A SHADOW
[2:19:00] OF good of good things to come, CAN
[2:19:02] NEVER MAKE THE COMERS THERE unto
[2:19:04] perfect."
[2:19:06] But he didn't come to reform. He came to
[2:19:10] fulfill.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[2:19:15] And John would introduce this Messiah as
[2:19:18] a lamb and he'd say, "Behold,
[2:19:22] or look, THE LAMB OF GOD." WELL, WE GOT
[2:19:24] MANY WOOLLY LAMBS.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; But here COMES THE TRUE LAMB WHICH
[2:19:29] TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS ENTERED INTO HIS MINISTRY AND
[2:19:36] HIS WORK WAS UNMISTAKABLE. HE WAS
[2:19:38] BRINGING ORDER TO CHAOS
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; AND HE STEPPED INTO SICKNESS AND HE
[2:19:44] BROUGHT HEALING.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; MATTHEW 11:5 SAID, "THE BLIND RECEIVED
[2:19:48] their sight and the lame walk." HE
[2:19:50] ENTERED INTO THE CHAOS OF BROKEN BODIES
[2:19:53] AND HE RESTORED THEM TO WHOLENESS.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; EVERYWHERE JESUS WENT, DISORDER
[2:19:59] RETREATED.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; DEMONS WERE CAST OUT. MINDS WERE
[2:20:03] RESTORED. TRUTH REPLACED TRADITION. LIFE
[2:20:06] REPLACE RITUAL. AND ONCE AGAIN, GOD
[2:20:09] DEMONSTRATED AN unchanging principle of
[2:20:13] redemption.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; That where sin brings chaos,
[2:20:17] God brings order.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; And where religion brings confusion,
[2:20:22] Christ brings life.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; And where man builds system, God sends a
[2:20:28] Messiah, an anointed one of God. And
[2:20:31] Jesus did not merely preach order. He
[2:20:34] was order incarnate.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; He was the living word that WAS STEPPING
[2:20:40] INTO A WORLD OF confusion
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; to restore God's original design. And
[2:20:45] that's what the Holy Ghost is is order
[2:20:49] incarnate.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is order incarnate. God
[2:20:56] coming into life to bring orders. What
[2:20:58] he does, he didn't come and rearrange
[2:21:00] the chaos.
[2:21:02] He enters into it. And when he enters,
[2:21:04] he speaks. AND WHEN HE SPEAKS, LIFE
[2:21:06] RISES AND THIRST ENDS and the SOUL IS
[2:21:09] SATISFIED. AND THE ORDER IS RESTORED.
[2:21:11] AND THAT'S WHAT JESUS DOES. HE DOESN'T
[2:21:13] MERELY REARRANGE CHAOS FROM FROM A LOFTY
[2:21:16] THRONE IN THE DISTANCE. HE STEPS INTO
[2:21:18] THE CHAOS. AND WHEN HE ENTERS, HE
[2:21:20] SPEAKS. AND WHEN HE SPEAKS, DARKNESS
[2:21:22] BREAKS AND FAITH RISES AND THIRST ENDS
[2:21:25] AND LIFE COMES BACK INTO DIVINE ORDER.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; And he proved this over and over again
[2:21:30] when he stepped in the world of con
[2:21:32] chaos everywhere he went. He calmed the
[2:21:34] storms. He healed bodies. He restored
[2:21:37] the minds. He saved souls. Because the
[2:21:40] power of Christ is not information. It
[2:21:44] is transformation.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; If we could just get IT THIS MORNING,
[2:21:52] YOU'D REALIZE THE MESSAGE THAT WE
[2:21:54] RECEIVED IS NOT INFORMATION.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; IT'S TRANSFORMATION.
[2:22:00] IT'S TO BRING ABOUT EXCHANGE TO BRING
[2:22:02] YOU INTO ORDER
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; OUT OF CHAOS. FOR THE BIBLE SAID IN 2
[2:22:08] CORINTHIANS 5:17, "IF ANY MAN BE IN
[2:22:10] CHRIST, he is a new creature."
[2:22:14] When Jesus enter, things don't remain
[2:22:16] the same.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Nowhere is this more seen any more
[2:22:21] clearly than at Calvary. Jesus was
[2:22:23] crucified. He was buried. He was
[2:22:24] resurrected. He ascended in glory. and a
[2:22:27] and to the natural eye, this looked like
[2:22:29] more chaos,
[2:22:32] a rejected Messiah, A BLOODED CROSS, A
[2:22:36] SEALED TOMB.
[2:22:38] But in reality, IT WAS GOD RESTORING
[2:22:41] ORDER
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL OF all sin and
[2:22:47] separation. And without the shedding of
[2:22:49] blood, chaos would have continued
[2:22:52] forever in man.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. For without the
[2:22:55] shedding of blood, there's no remission
[2:22:57] of sins.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; And let me get it. Though it looked like
[2:23:03] chaos, his death was not defeat.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; It was payment. Amen.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 55 or 53 and 5 said he was
[2:23:15] wounded for our transgressions and he
[2:23:18] was bruised for our iniquity and the
[2:23:21] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[2:23:23] and with his stripes we were healed
[2:23:26] delivered.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about that.
[2:23:31] AND WITHOUT THE RESURRECTION, his
[2:23:34] crucifixion would have been in vain.
[2:23:36] Because 1 Corinthians 15:17 said, "If
[2:23:39] Christ be not raised, your faith is
[2:23:42] vain. For you are yet in your sins."
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; But he did rise.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; I said he did rise.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; And he when he rose, HE ROSE TRIUMPHANT
[2:23:52] OVER DEATH AND HELL. FOR THE BIBLE SAID
[2:23:55] IN ACTS 2:24, "IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THAT
[2:23:58] HE SHOULD beholden of it." AND HIS
[2:24:01] ASCENSION WAS NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT. IT
[2:24:03] WAS A COMPLETION OF HIS MISSION. FOR HE
[2:24:05] ENTERED IN THE GLORY AS OUR HIGH PRIEST
[2:24:07] AND OUR INTERCESSOR.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; One who can be touched today by the
[2:24:11] feelings of your infirmity.
[2:24:14] And he was not running away from the
[2:24:16] chaos of the cross and of the tomb, but
[2:24:20] instead he was overcoming death, hell,
[2:24:23] and the grave.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; And he ascended. And when he ascended,
[2:24:26] he cleared a path, making a highway for
[2:24:28] his sons to come to glory with him.
[2:24:30] Therefore, he could say, "I am the way,
[2:24:32] the truth, and the life, and no one can
[2:24:34] come to God except by me."
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; And yet, he didn't leave his disciples
[2:24:41] in sorrow and confusion. For he said in
[2:24:44] John 14:18,
[2:24:46] "I will not leave you comfortless.
[2:24:49] I will come to you."
[2:24:53] So he told him plainly though that his
[2:24:55] departure WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT WOULD
[2:24:58] OPEN THE WAY FOR THE HOLY GHOST TO COME
[2:25:01] UPON COMING INTO MEN TO BRING THEM OUT
[2:25:03] OF CHAOS.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; SO IN JOHN 16:7, NEVERTHELESS I TELL YOU
[2:25:09] the truth is expedient THAT I GO AWAY.
[2:25:12] FOR IF I GO NOT AWAY, THE COMFORTER WILL
[2:25:14] NOT COME TO YOU. BUT IF I DEPART, I WILL
[2:25:16] SEND them
[2:25:18] unto you.
[2:25:20] So after his ascension, he commands him
[2:25:22] to wait. And he says in Luke 24:49,
[2:25:25] "Tear you in the city of Jerusalem until
[2:25:27] you're endued with power from on high."
[2:25:32] So 120 of them, men and women, gathered
[2:25:36] in an upper room waiting. AND THEY WERE
[2:25:39] NOT WANDERING AND AROUND and going in
[2:25:42] and OUT, BUT THEY WERE PRAYING AND
[2:25:43] SEEKING God together. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS
[2:25:46] IN ACTS 1:14, THESE ALL CONTINUED WITH
[2:25:49] ONE ACCORD in prayer and supplication.
[2:25:53] AND WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE CAME RIGHT,
[2:25:56] UNITY, HUNGER, EXPECTATION, GOD CAME
[2:26:00] DOWN.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you want to have him
[2:26:04] come down today, get him that same type
[2:26:06] of expectation.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unity, one with God, one with the
[2:26:11] scripture, one with the promise. Amen.
[2:26:14] believe in this for you. Are you with
[2:26:16] me? HUNGER, DESIRE, WANTING HIM WITH ALL
[2:26:19] YOUR HEART, EXPECTATION. THAT'S WHEN GOD
[2:26:21] CAME DOWN.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; And just as he CAME TO MOSES AND OUR
[2:26:25] BURNING BUSH, AND JUST AS HIS GLORY
[2:26:27] FILLED THE THE TABERNACLE IN THE TEMPLE,
[2:26:29] HE CAME AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME NOT IN
[2:26:32] STONES MADE OR BUILDINGS MADE OF STONE,
[2:26:35] BUT HE CAME IN TO LIVING temples of
[2:26:38] flesh.
[2:26:40] And the Bible said in Acts two, "And
[2:26:44] suddenly there came a sound from
[2:26:46] heaven." This was God stepping into
[2:26:48] chaos,
[2:26:50] as of rushing mighty wind, as God
[2:26:53] breeze, and there appeared unto them
[2:26:55] cloven tongues like as a fire. Let there
[2:26:58] be light, and it sat upon them, and they
[2:27:01] were all filled with the Holy Ghost. And
[2:27:03] now the spirit of God is moving. It is
[2:27:05] breathing. It is now coming to dwell in
[2:27:08] human beings. And to the outside world,
[2:27:10] it looked like chaos.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; IT DIDN'T RESEMBLE THE RELIGIOUS ORDER.
[2:27:18] IT DIDN'T RESEMBLE THE INSTITUTIONS OF
[2:27:20] THE DAY. IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE FORMAL
[2:27:22] TEMPLE WORSHIP.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; THEY MOCKED IT. IN FACT, THEY SAID,
[2:27:27] "THESE MEN ARE FULL OF NEW WINE."
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS NOT DRUNKEN CONFUSION. IT WAS
[2:27:32] DIVINE ORDER.
[2:27:34] IT WAS HEAVEN PLACING MEN AND WOMEN IN
[2:27:37] THEIR APPOINTED POSITIONS IN THE BODY OF
[2:27:39] CHRIST, ADOPTING AND PLACING THEM AS
[2:27:41] SONS.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; And later Paul would describe it like
[2:27:44] this. For he said in 1 Corinthians
[2:27:47] 12:13, by one spirit you're all baptized
[2:27:50] into one body.
[2:27:53] So this was not disorder. This was God
[2:27:56] forming a church.
[2:27:59] And it brought order to men like Peter.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; You're listening good.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; But it brought order to men like Peter.
[2:28:11] Just weeks earlier, he had denied the
[2:28:13] Lord with cursing and fear. But after
[2:28:16] Pentecost,
[2:28:18] THAT SAME MAN STOOD UP WITH A HOLY
[2:28:20] BOLDNESS. And the chaos of fear had, you
[2:28:24] know, had turned now into THE ORDER OF
[2:28:26] FAITH. AND JESUS HAD PROMISED, "YOU
[2:28:28] SHALL RECEIVE POWER AFTER THE HOLY GHOST
[2:28:30] HAS COME UPON YOU." AND PETER BECAME THE
[2:28:34] LIVING PROOF.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; AND HIS SERMONS WASN'T POLISHED OR
[2:28:38] SCARLET. IT WAS ANOINTED. IT WAS FULL OF
[2:28:41] LIFE. IT WAS FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND
[2:28:43] WHEN THE SPIRIT OF MOVE, GOD SPOKE
[2:28:45] THROUGH AN IGNORANT FISHERMAN. AND THE
[2:28:48] WORD CUT hearts like a sword.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible said in Acts 2 and
[2:28:54] verse 37, when they heard this, they
[2:28:56] were pricricked in their hearts.
[2:28:59] And that day,
[2:29:02] in that day, 3,000 souls were brought
[2:29:06] out of darkness into order.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; And Acts 2:41,
[2:29:13] they that gladly received his word were
[2:29:16] baptized,
[2:29:17] about 3,000 souls.
[2:29:22] And immediately, I want you to get this.
[2:29:25] When the Holy Ghost came in, immediately
[2:29:28] order began to spread.
[2:29:31] At the gate OF THE TEMPLE SET A MAN
[2:29:34] CRIPPLED FROM BIRTH, BEGGING, HIS LIFE
[2:29:38] BROKEN, HIS FUTURE LIMITED, HIS
[2:29:41] EXISTENCE REDUCED TO SURVIVAL. AND PETER
[2:29:44] AND JOHN, FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST,
[2:29:47] STEPPED INTO HIS CHAOS WITH AUTHORITY.
[2:29:50] HALLELUJAH. Peter rose up and said, "In
[2:29:53] the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, RISE UP AND
[2:29:55] WALK."
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; And the man did NOT CRAWL. HE LEAPED. He
[2:29:59] stood. HE LEAP LEAPING UP. STOOD AND
[2:30:01] WALKED. WALKING AND LEAPING AND PRAISING
[2:30:04] GOD.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, THAT IS THE PATTERN. WHEN
[2:30:07] THE SPIRIT SPEAKS THROUGH THE WORD,
[2:30:09] CHAOS BREAKS AND ORDER IS RESTORED.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; That's the gospel in motion. It's not
[2:30:15] religious polishing disorder. is Christ
[2:30:18] entering into it, SPEAKING LIFE AND
[2:30:20] TURNING confusion into a testimony.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; And God looked on it with pleasure
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; and said, "It's good. It's very good."
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; I have brought order to human lives. I
[2:30:37] have taken men and women out of disorder
[2:30:39] and I brought them into divine order.
[2:30:42] And it was God saw what he had made and
[2:30:46] it was very good.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; But not so with his archeneemy.
[2:30:56] That old serpent, the adversary from the
[2:30:59] beginning. He's watching this all
[2:31:01] unfold, too.
[2:31:07] He's the one who said in his heart,
[2:31:10] "I'll exalt my throne.
[2:31:12] I'll be like the most high."
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; That one who's always sought worship
[2:31:17] that belongs to God.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; That one who begiled Eve through his
[2:31:21] subility
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; and infiltrated the family by deception
[2:31:26] and sewing the seed of the serpent among
[2:31:28] mankind. And from Eden to Calvary, his
[2:31:31] strategy was the same. corrupt what God
[2:31:34] has created, COUNTERFEIT WHAT GOD HAS
[2:31:37] REVEALED, OPPOSE WHAT GOD QUICKENS, and
[2:31:41] at first he's watching with satisfaction
[2:31:44] as though
[2:31:46] everything had finally fallen into
[2:31:48] place.
[2:31:51] But he's strutting around, he's looking,
[2:31:54] he says, "You know what?"
[2:31:56] as he watches Christ crucified, rejected
[2:31:59] by his own church.
[2:32:02] And you know, by rejecting him, they was
[2:32:04] accepting Satan.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; And he's watching with satisfaction
[2:32:10] like everything's finally falling into
[2:32:12] place.
[2:32:15] Said, "You know what? I turned Eden into
[2:32:18] a graveyard.
[2:32:22] What God called order,
[2:32:25] I turned it into my order,
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; chaos.
[2:32:32] AND HE HAD WATCHED VIOLENCE multiply
[2:32:35] until the earth was filled with
[2:32:37] violence, and God washed it with the
[2:32:39] flood.
[2:32:40] And after the flood, he raised Babel up
[2:32:44] the tower of Babel with in a proud
[2:32:46] rebellion where man tried to make a name
[2:32:49] for himself.
[2:32:53] Then he twisted Israel into a nation of
[2:32:55] ritual without revelation.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Scripture without spirit, a form without
[2:33:02] fire until Jesus said, "Thus you have
[2:33:05] made the commandments of God of none
[2:33:07] effect by your tradition."
[2:33:10] All the priests wore the garments.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; They look dignified. They held their
[2:33:17] pedigree,
[2:33:18] hereditary dissent, but the glory was
[2:33:21] absent. They had religion, but they
[2:33:24] didn't have life.
[2:33:26] And when the Messiah came, Satan
[2:33:29] believed. He had done it again. He had
[2:33:32] WORKED THROUGH THE CROWD. HE HAD STIRRED
[2:33:33] THEM UP. HE HAD WORKED THROUGH THE
[2:33:36] JEALOUS LEADERS. HE FULFILLED WHAT THE
[2:33:38] SCRIPTURE SAID IN PSALMS 2 AND TWO. the
[2:33:40] kingdoms, the kings of the earth set
[2:33:42] themselves against the Lord, against his
[2:33:44] anointed.
[2:33:46] He moved through Rome and through
[2:33:48] religious hatred, he drove nails in the
[2:33:51] hands OF THE WORD MADE flesh
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; and they crucified the Lord of glory.
[2:33:59] And when Jesus breathed his last breath,
[2:34:03] hell thought it had won.
[2:34:08] And the mockers cried, "HE SAVED
[2:34:12] HIMSELF,
[2:34:13] but he can't himself he can't save.
[2:34:18] For if he had saved himself, he could
[2:34:20] not have saved others. For the Son of
[2:34:23] Man did not come to preserve his own
[2:34:24] life, but to give it, to give his life
[2:34:27] as a ransom for many."
[2:34:30] And so he watches with a smirk. Aha!
[2:34:34] He's laughing.
[2:34:36] He sees the DISCIPLES SCATTER
[2:34:39] JUST AS THE SCRIPTURES FORETOLD. I'LL
[2:34:41] SMITE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP OF THE
[2:34:43] FLOCK WILL BE SCATTERED. HE WATCHED
[2:34:44] PETER, THE ONE WHO SAID, "THOUGH ALL MEN
[2:34:48] BE OFFENDED BECAUSE OF THEE, yet I will
[2:34:50] never be offended."
[2:34:53] And he watched him collapse under
[2:34:55] pressure and deny the Lord with cursing.
[2:34:59] The bravest voice now became silent and
[2:35:03] the boldest promise turned to fear.
[2:35:06] And Satan watched the followers of
[2:35:08] Christ slink back into the shadows and
[2:35:11] think it's over.
[2:35:14] And the whole bunch of them are just
[2:35:16] disheartened. We thought this was a
[2:35:18] Messiah. We thought this would be the
[2:35:20] one who would deliver.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; And then he watched them as they slunk
[2:35:25] in the shadows there at the cross. And
[2:35:27] he listened as Jesus cried from the
[2:35:29] CROSS AND SAID, "MY GOD,
[2:35:32] MY GOD."
[2:35:35] WHY HAST thou forsaken me?
[2:35:38] AND TO SATAN IT SOUNDED LIKE
[2:35:41] ABANDONMENT.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; IT SOUNDED LIKE DEFEAT.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; IT SOUNDED LIKE SEPARATION.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; But it WAS SOMETHING FAR MORE HOLY AND
[2:35:52] FAR more terrible to hell. It was the
[2:35:55] lambarians
[2:35:56] bearing the sins of the world. And the
[2:35:59] scripture said he made him to be sin for
[2:36:02] us who knew no sin.
[2:36:05] And he was not forsaken because he
[2:36:08] failed. He was forsaken because he stood
[2:36:11] in our place.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; And like the SCAPEGOAT BEARING THE SINS
[2:36:16] OF THE PEOPLE AND BEING SENT AWAY IN THE
[2:36:18] WILDERNESS, CHRIST CARRIED THE BURDEN
[2:36:21] THAT BELONGED TO US AND HE WAS THE
[2:36:22] FULFILLMENT OF EVERY SHADOW. HE WAS A
[2:36:25] TRUE SIN BEARER. BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD
[2:36:27] TO TAKE AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD. AND
[2:36:29] IN THAT MOMENT CRIED OUT,
[2:36:33] he sound like the scapegoat in the
[2:36:35] wilderness, my God, my God,
[2:36:41] why
[2:36:43] hast thou forsaken me?
[2:36:46] And Satan watched,
[2:36:50] thinking the light had been put out.
[2:36:54] But what he did not understand was this.
[2:36:58] That cry was not the end of God's order.
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; It was the moment God's order was being
[2:37:05] purchased.
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; And because the chaos of sin was not
[2:37:09] GOING TO BE HEALED BY RELIGION, it was
[2:37:11] GOING TO BE HEALED BY REDEMPTION.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; SO YES, SATAN WATCHED THINKING THE LIGHT
[2:37:16] HAD BEEN PUT out
[2:37:21] and he heard the cry of anguish.
[2:37:24] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[2:37:27] me? And he assumed that even heaven had
[2:37:30] turned his back and God's plan that
[2:37:34] collapsed into chaos.
[2:37:36] But what he didn't understand
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; was that this was not the end of God's
[2:37:41] order.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; It was the moment God's order was being
[2:37:45] purchased.
[2:37:47] And Jesus then lifted his head one final
[2:37:50] time and spoke words that shook hell to
[2:37:53] his foundation and HE SCREAMED OUT, "IT
[2:37:56] IS FINISHED."
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; Not I am finished.
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; NOT IT'S OVER.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; BUT IT IS FINISHED.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; THE DEBT IS PAID.
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; THE SACRIFICE IS COMPLETE. THE PRICE
[2:38:15] FULLY settled
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; and in that moment the chaos of sin was
[2:38:19] NOT BEING MANAGED BY ANOTHER RELIGIOUS
[2:38:22] SYSTEM. It was being defeated.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RELIGION CAN MANAGE SIN. BUT
[2:38:30] CHRIST DEFEATS SIN.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; AND THE WORK OF REDEMPTION WAS
[2:38:34] ACCOMPLISHED EVEN AS THE SCRIPTURE HAS
[2:38:36] BEEN FORETOLD. HE SHALL SEE THE TRAVAIL
[2:38:38] OF HIS SOUL and shall be satisfied.
[2:38:43] Hallelujah.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; And the handwriting of ordinance that
[2:38:47] was against that stood against us was
[2:38:49] blotted out. And the ransom was paid.
[2:38:53] And the lamb had borne the sin.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; And the enemy that had once ruled
[2:39:01] through accusation and guilt was now
[2:39:04] disarmed.
[2:39:06] AND BECAUSE THE CHAOS OF SIN WAS NEVER
[2:39:08] GOING TO BE healed by religion, it was
[2:39:12] going to be ended by redemption. And
[2:39:15] Satan didn't understand the wisdom of
[2:39:17] God. And what looked like chaos to men
[2:39:21] was God's perfect plan.
[2:39:25] &gt;&gt; And as the blood ran down the cross,
[2:39:27] that was not defeat. It was payment.
[2:39:31] Without the shedding of blood, there's
[2:39:33] no remission. And the grave wasn't the
[2:39:36] end. It was the doorway.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; For he kicked down. Listen, the Bible
[2:39:41] said he descended into the depths. Come
[2:39:45] on, somebody.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He just say that. AND WHEN HE WENT
[2:39:48] DOWN THERE, HE KICKED DOWN THE GATES OF
[2:39:50] HELL.
[2:39:52] &gt;&gt; AND WITH A MIGHTY TRUMP OF TRIUMPH, HE
[2:39:54] LED THE CAPTIVES OUT
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; AND HE SET THEM FREE. AND HE TOOK FROM
[2:39:59] SATAN THE KEYS OF DEATH AND OF HELL AND
[2:40:02] THE GRAVE. AND HE ROSE ON THE THIRD DAY.
[2:40:04] AND WHEN HE ROSE, THE EARTH SHOOK AND
[2:40:06] THE STONE ROLL AWAY. AND SATAN FELT THE
[2:40:08] GROUND OF HIS KINGDOM tremble again.
[2:40:12] Why? Because it was not possible that he
[2:40:15] should beholden of it. And death was
[2:40:17] conquered. And the prince OF LIFE WAS
[2:40:19] ALIVE AGAIN.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THEN CAME THE NEXT BLOW.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Satan had always been able to corrupt
[2:40:29] temples.
[2:40:32] He could pollute altars.
[2:40:34] He could influence institutions.
[2:40:37] He could work through systems and
[2:40:38] councils and traditions.
[2:40:41] But God was doing something that Satan
[2:40:43] hated most. God was building a body.
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; Not a building,
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; a bride.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not an organization. Living
[2:40:53] temples, NOT STONE WALLS. SOMEBODY HELP
[2:40:56] ME PREACH. And when the day of PENTECOST
[2:40:58] FULLY CAME, SATAN SAW IT LIKE A STORM
[2:41:02] THAT WAS BREAKING OUT OF HEAVEN. A SOUND
[2:41:04] LIKE A RUSHING mighty wind. IT WAS FIRE
[2:41:07] DESCENDED NOT ON AN ALTAR THIS TIME, BUT
[2:41:09] ON A PEOPLE.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT IN THE HOLIES OF HOLIES BEHIND
[2:41:13] THE VEIL, BUT UPON FISHERMEN, UPON
[2:41:15] WOMEN, ON ORDINARY BELIEVERS. AND
[2:41:18] SUDDENLY 120 VESSELS THAT HAD ONCE BEEN
[2:41:21] SCATTERED AND FEARFUL AND CONFUSED WERE
[2:41:23] FILLED WITH HOLY GHOST ORDER.
[2:41:27] THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY Ghost
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; and to hell. It looked like chaos.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; But Satan knew better. This wasn't
[2:41:37] chaos. This was God taking territory.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; Souls of men and souls of women that he
[2:41:45] had held captive. Amen. He was taking
[2:41:47] territory. Hallelujah. He watched men
[2:41:50] that USED TO BE BOUND BY SIN BECOME
[2:41:52] FREE. MEN THAT USED TO HIDE BEHIND
[2:41:55] RELIGION STAND UP WITH POWER. THE SAME
[2:41:57] PETER WHO ONCE CURSED AND DENIED CHRIST
[2:42:00] NOW LIFTED UP HIS VOICE LIKE A TRUMPET
[2:42:02] AND AND THAT TERRIFIED HELL, A MAN THAT
[2:42:05] WAS SPEAKING BY THE HOLY GHOST AND SAID,
[2:42:07] "THIS SAME JESUS THAT GOD HAS RAISED UP.
[2:42:10] THEREFORE, BY THE BEING BY THE RIGHT
[2:42:12] HAND OF GOD EXALTED, he has shed forth
[2:42:15] this." And in one sermon, as that word
[2:42:19] was released, as the spirit of God
[2:42:22] moved, as a man was anointed, this was
[2:42:25] not a priest reading the scripture. This
[2:42:27] was a man anointed by the HOLY GHOST AND
[2:42:30] POWER in the word. And when the power
[2:42:32] WENT IN THE WORD, 3,000 SOULS WERE
[2:42:35] SNATCHED FROM DARKNESS INTO LIGHT AND
[2:42:37] FROM CHAOS INTO ORDER. And the Lord
[2:42:40] added TO THE CHURCH DAILY such as should
[2:42:42] be saved.
[2:42:44] And Satan could hardly stand it because
[2:42:48] he couldn't he could handle religion,
[2:42:52] but he could not handle life.
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THIS.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; MANY OF YOU HAD RELIGION
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; AND HE COULD HANDLE YOU AS LONG AS YOU
[2:43:03] JUST HAD RELIGION.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE YOU GOT LIFE,
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; ONCE HIS LIFE CAME INTO YOU, HE CAN NO
[2:43:11] LONGER HANDLE YOU ANYMORE.
[2:43:13] HE COULDN'T CONTROL YOU ANYMORE. AMEN.
[2:43:16] WHAT RELIGION COULD NOT DO, GOD DID IN
[2:43:18] YOUR LIFE. HE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF CHAOS
[2:43:21] INTO ORDER.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S THE GOD WE SERVE
[2:43:27] TODAY.
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; He could handle a church and programs
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; but no power. But he couldn't handle a
[2:43:38] Mark 16 church
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; that these signs shall follow them
[2:43:42] believe because they will cast him out
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERYWHERE THIS HOLY GHOST
[2:43:50] CHURCH GOES,
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; SHE brings chaos into order
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; AND SATAN HAS TO LEAVE. SOMEBODY HELP ME
[2:43:59] PREACH.
[2:44:00] OH, HE COULD HANDLE PHARISEES DEBATING
[2:44:02] DOCTRINE, BUT HE could not handle
[2:44:04] believers walking in the spirit and in
[2:44:06] truth.
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; And then things got worse for him. At a
[2:44:13] temple set, a man crippled another
[2:44:16] broken piece of humanity
[2:44:19] living in chaos.
[2:44:21] In the chaos of weakness,
[2:44:24] Satan had him parked there like a
[2:44:26] monument.
[2:44:28] God's power isn't real. He sits at this
[2:44:32] temple every day.
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; He never gets healed.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; He never receives redemption.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; He's just still in his chaos. You see,
[2:44:42] he sat him there like a monument.
[2:44:47] Another broken piece of humanity
[2:44:51] living in the chaos of weakness,
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; parking like a monument. and says, "This
[2:44:57] is how far life can fall."
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; But Peter and John walked up.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; And Satan heard those words. It makes
[2:45:08] demons tremble
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; OF NAZARETH. RISE UP AND WALK.
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; AND THAT MAN LEAPED UP LIKE CREATION
[2:45:20] ITSELF HAD BEEN REMADE. AND HE WENT
[2:45:22] WALKING AND LEAPING AND PRAISING GOD.
[2:45:24] AND DISORDER WAS CORRECTED. AND CHAINS
[2:45:26] WERE BROKEN AND FLESH WAS RESTORED AND
[2:45:29] PRAISE WAS RISING. AND I'LL TELL YOU,
[2:45:31] IT'LL DO ITS SAME AGAIN AND AGAIN AND
[2:45:33] AGAIN AND AGAIN. TAKE BROKEN HUMANITY,
[2:45:37] LOST and chaos,
[2:45:40] stand like a statue, like a MONUMENT TO
[2:45:43] THE DEVIL'S TESTIMONY OF WHAT HE CAN DO
[2:45:45] TO LIFE. AND GOD TRANSFORM you
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; in a moment
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; till you break THE CHAINS OF DARKNESS
[2:45:54] OFF YOUR LIFE.
[2:45:56] and you leave the chaos
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; restored
[2:46:02] with a praise in your lips.
[2:46:05] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what, this was Genesis
[2:46:07] all over again.
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; Darkness, then the spirit of God moved.
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; Chaos, then God spoke
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; bondage, then light broke forth. Amen.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; And Satan knew what it meant because
[2:46:23] when God brings his order upon a people,
[2:46:25] the gates of hell cannot prevail
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; because he said in Matthew 16:18, "On
[2:46:30] this rock I will build my church, and
[2:46:33] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[2:46:36] against it."
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; So hell does what it always does. It's
[2:46:44] sent persecution.
[2:46:46] It sent false brethren. It sent
[2:46:47] division. It sent religious spirits. It
[2:46:49] tried to stop it, dilute it, organize
[2:46:51] it, kill it.
[2:46:54] But Satan had seen something that day
[2:46:56] that terrified him. AND HERE'S WHAT
[2:46:59] SATAN IS MOST TERRIFIED OF. WHEN GOD
[2:47:02] TAKES ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN OUT OF
[2:47:05] CHAOS AND OF SIN AND RELIGION AND PLACES
[2:47:08] THEM IN THE BODY BY THE HOLY GHOST,
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; THAT TERRIFIES THE DEVIL.
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; TO SEE A MAN OR WOMAN FILLED WITH THE
[2:47:16] SPIRIT OF GOD
[2:47:18] AMEN. WITH THE POWER OF THE LIVING
[2:47:20] CHRIST IN THEM.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN ONCE GOD SETS HIS ORDER IN
[2:47:24] MOTION, THE devil cannot reverse it. He
[2:47:27] can only fight against it.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; I hope you heard what I SAID. WHEN GOD
[2:47:32] SETS HIS ORDER IN MOTION, THE DEVIL
[2:47:35] CANNOT REVERSE IT.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; HE CAN ONLY FIGHT AGAINST IT, BUT HE
[2:47:40] CANNOT REVERSE IT.
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD WILL NEVER TAKE HIS WORD BACK.
[2:47:45] IF HIS WORD WAS RELEASED AND THE SPIRIT
[2:47:47] OF GOD MOVED, COME ON. IT'S GOING TO
[2:47:50] WORK ON THE CHAOS
[2:47:52] UNTIL THE DARKNESS BREAK AND THE LIGHT.
[2:47:58] HALLELUJAH.
[2:48:01] And oh yeah, he'll fight it because he
[2:48:03] knows the same word that brought light
[2:48:06] in Genesis is those same word speaking
[2:48:08] today.
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; And God spoke.
[2:48:13] I said God spoke.
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God moved.
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of God moves, God
[2:48:21] speaks.
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, I remember. I remember. Let's go
[2:48:25] back just for a moment. Let's just go
[2:48:27] back in our memory just a moment to to
[2:48:29] things that's happened in our day, our
[2:48:31] time, and our church. And God spoke.
[2:48:35] Amen. And and that night in a prayer
[2:48:37] line, God got answered. A little sister,
[2:48:40] a little girl's prayer for a brother and
[2:48:42] a BOY IN THE DEPTHS OF SIN, A LIFE IN
[2:48:45] DISORDER came racing TO THE CHURCH IN
[2:48:48] HIS PAJAMAS. AND GOD BROUGHT JUSTIN WEAR
[2:48:51] OUT OF CHAOS
[2:48:54] &gt;&gt; INTO ORDER.
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND NOW HE'S A MAN THE DEVIL
[2:49:00] DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SHOW ME A MAN OR A WOMAN
[2:49:06] THAT'LL SUBMIT THEMSELVES TO GOD. AND
[2:49:08] HE'LL BE A MAN OR A WOMAN THE DEVIL
[2:49:10] WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, IF GOD CAN REACH
[2:49:14] OUT THERE AND GET A PRODAL OUT OF HIS
[2:49:16] BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND BRING
[2:49:18] HIM TO CHURCH
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; IN HIS PAJAMAS, HE CAN GET YOUR CHILD,
[2:49:22] YOUR YOUR SON, YOUR DAUGHTER, YOUR
[2:49:24] BROTHER, YOUR SISTER, YOUR MOTHER, YOUR
[2:49:25] DADDY. HE CAN FIND THEM. HE'LL GET HIS
[2:49:28] ELECT SOMEWHERE.
[2:49:35] And God spoke. I said, "And God spoke."
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God moved. And God spoke.
[2:49:43] &gt;&gt; And another prodal, Denise Hamilton,
[2:49:46] came out of chaos into order.
[2:49:50] Her life was in chaos.
[2:49:54] It was totally in chaos. Satan thought
[2:49:56] he'd had the last life. He thought it
[2:49:59] was over. She thought it was over.
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. She hadn't BEEN IN CHURCH AND I
[2:50:05] DON'T KNOW WHEN.
[2:50:10] And over IN GERMANY, THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[2:50:12] MOVED. I WAS IN THE BED AT NIGHT AND
[2:50:15] WOKE UP SUDDENLY AND SAT UP IN MY BED AS
[2:50:17] A VOICE FROM HEAVEN RANG OUT AND SAID,
[2:50:20] "Denise is about to receive her last
[2:50:22] call."
[2:50:24] What was that?
[2:50:27] The spirit of God had moved.
[2:50:30] What was that? A word was released.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; What was that? Now I knew I was the
[2:50:38] messenger.
[2:50:40] And hearing that voice, I look looking
[2:50:42] around to see the voice and watch a
[2:50:44] black line go across the ceiling.
[2:50:47] Big thick dark line. And I said, "Oh,
[2:50:49] God."
[2:50:52] Here comes that final call.
[2:50:55] I didn't know what to do with it.
[2:50:58] Finally, when the opportunity was right,
[2:51:01] it was months later, I went and told her
[2:51:02] what God had said.
[2:51:05] She just simply said, "Well, thanks for
[2:51:07] telling me." And walked away.
[2:51:10] And some days later, in the wee hours of
[2:51:14] the morning,
[2:51:16] God came into her room
[2:51:19] &gt;&gt; and he confirmed it to her. Spoke to her
[2:51:22] personally, grabbing her Bible.
[2:51:26] It flipped RIGHT OPEN TO THE PRODICAL
[2:51:28] SON.
[2:51:30] She called ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
[2:51:31] AND I SAID, "OH, DENISE, YOU'RE YOU'RE
[2:51:33] LIKE THAT PRODAL IN THE BIBLE." THE
[2:51:35] BIBLE SAID, "AND WHEN HE CAME TO
[2:51:39] HIMSELF,
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH." You know, YOU MAY THINK YOU
[2:51:44] ARE WHO YOU ARE.
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; LING SAID, "YOU MAY THINK THAT'S YOUR
[2:51:49] IDENTITY, BUT one day
[2:51:50] &gt;&gt; you're going to come to yourself."
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what happened to you THAT
[2:51:56] DAY WHEN CHRIST CAME INTO YOUR LIFE. YOU
[2:51:58] came to yourself. All of a sudden,
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; you recognize
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; I have a father
[2:52:05] &gt;&gt; and in his house are provision and I've
[2:52:07] been wasting my life on eating with the
[2:52:10] swine and I've lost everything that I've
[2:52:13] had. I've wrecked my life and I am
[2:52:15] ruined and I stink and I I I'm a sinner
[2:52:19] and I'm lost without God.
[2:52:22] And that day, that night, we prayed
[2:52:25] together and her life was brought to
[2:52:27] order out of chaos.
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; And now she's an example daughter of
[2:52:33] God.
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; Like Jason Taggard,
[2:52:41] left Canada, came to Louisiana.
[2:52:45] He came willingly
[2:52:47] not to go to church.
[2:52:49] He wasn't going to church. He was going
[2:52:52] to he was coming here because whiskey
[2:52:54] was a lot cheaper here in Louisiana than
[2:52:56] it was in Canada.
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; And that was his God.
[2:53:02] &gt;&gt; No intentions of serving God. But you
[2:53:05] know what? He made a mistake. He came to
[2:53:07] church one time too many
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God moved
[2:53:14] &gt;&gt; and the word was released. And when the
[2:53:16] word was released,
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; order came into his chaos.
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; Cigarettes left him immediately.
[2:53:24] Drunkenness left him immediately. Amen.
[2:53:27] Sins begin dropping off OF HIM. WHY?
[2:53:29] BECAUSE THAT'S THE GOD WE SERVE.
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; HE STEPS DOWN INTO CHAOS
[2:53:35] &gt;&gt; AND BRINGS INTO ORDER.
[2:53:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:53:43] CHAOS LEFT. THE CRAVINGS FOR CIGARETTES
[2:53:46] LEFT, ALCOHOL THAT RUINED HIS LIFE AND
[2:53:49] THE DRUGS, ALL OF IT NOW LEFT. And he
[2:53:51] was life was brought to order.
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; And that same order is spreading through
[2:53:58] his family.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; And let's speak it in faith this
[2:54:02] morning. It's going to reach every one
[2:54:04] of them and bring them into vine order
[2:54:09] &gt;&gt; because Satan cannot stop what God has
[2:54:12] started.
[2:54:17] like James Strong up there. Hardly a
[2:54:20] sober day in his life since a young
[2:54:22] teenager's life in shambble and total
[2:54:24] chaos. But the spirit of God moved.
[2:54:29] &gt;&gt; And when he moved, the chaos left.
[2:54:34] The drunkenness left. He didn't have to
[2:54:36] do a classes. He didn't have to do 10 or
[2:54:39] 12 steps. It was one step. Surrender
[2:54:42] your heart to God.
[2:54:44] be baptized in his name. Receive the
[2:54:46] Holy Ghost.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; And it changes life
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; from disorder
[2:54:52] &gt;&gt; from chaos into order.
[2:54:56] &gt;&gt; It moved over and we USED THIS OVER
[2:54:58] AGAIN, BUT IT MOVED OVER TO SISTER LANA
[2:55:01] AND THE CANCER WAS GONE AND HER LIFE WAS
[2:55:04] RESTORED TO ORDER. THE CHAOS WAS OVER.
[2:55:06] WHY? BECAUSE GOD HAD CANCELLED THE
[2:55:10] DEVIL'S PLANS.
[2:55:12] HALLELUJAH.
[2:55:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN GOD CANCELS THE
[2:55:15] DEVIL'S PLANS,
[2:55:17] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, IT'S HIM STEPPING INTO
[2:55:20] LIFE TO BRING IT OUT OF CHAOS INTO
[2:55:23] DIVINE ORDER.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; No more chemo. No longer would chaos
[2:55:29] rain in her family with a husband
[2:55:31] wandering at night through the yard
[2:55:33] crying out to God because a wicked
[2:55:35] taskmaster whipping his wife with
[2:55:38] cancer. But oh no, now liberty rang.
[2:55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. ORDER RESTORED BECAUSE GOD
[2:55:45] STRIPPED DOWN into chaos.
[2:55:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FREE. FREE. FREE AT LAST.
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; OH,
[2:55:56] and what about baby Drew?
[2:55:59] A baby who couldn't stand on his own.
[2:56:02] Deformed hips.
[2:56:04] X-rays to prove it. Doctors
[2:56:10] having all kinds of thoughts about what
[2:56:13] to do.
[2:56:15] Couldn't pull himself up, couldn't walk,
[2:56:19] was not taking steps.
[2:56:22] Yet it was past time and his mother
[2:56:23] Bethany sets him at the foot of her
[2:56:26] mother's bed so she could tend her
[2:56:29] mother laying in the bed with a blind
[2:56:30] eye, an eye blinded from a brain bleed.
[2:56:35] And suddenly
[2:56:37] that same one that broke chaos in the
[2:56:39] beginning that said, "Let there be
[2:56:42] light," spoke again. And at that moment,
[2:56:45] as the spirit of God moved,
[2:56:48] light came into a blind eye. And mom
[2:56:51] could see. And the spirit wasn't
[2:56:53] through. It swept right over the bed,
[2:56:56] RIGHT DOWN UPON LITTLE BABY DREW that
[2:56:58] was that was sitting there at the end.
[2:57:01] And he rose up out of the middle of the
[2:57:03] floor unaded and ran. I MEAN IT. I SAW
[2:57:07] IT. HE RAN ALL OVER. NOT FIRST STEP, THE
[2:57:10] FIRST RUN. AMEN. HE RAN ALL OVER THE
[2:57:14] HOUSE. WHY? BECAUSE GOD BRINGS order
[2:57:18] into chaos.
[2:57:22] THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES. AND WHEN HE
[2:57:24] DOES, A WORD IS SPOKEN INTO THE CHAOS.
[2:57:28] &gt;&gt; OH, I could talk about it. WHAT WHAT
[2:57:30] ABOUT DAVID DEXTER WITH AN INCURABLE
[2:57:32] infection in his eye and he was going to
[2:57:35] lose it and the spirit of God moved
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; and the chaos was brought to order. What
[2:57:40] about Lydia? The spirit of God moved at
[2:57:44] the sound of his voice. She ran with her
[2:57:47] baby whose kidneys were not functioning
[2:57:49] and chaos was brought to order. And he's
[2:57:52] a healthy boy today
[2:57:55] &gt;&gt; because God stepped into that chaos.
[2:57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you remember, brother Aaron,
[2:58:00] THE DAY YOU WALKED DOWN TO THE ALTAR AND
[2:58:01] YOU SURRENDERED YOUR HEART TO GOD, A
[2:58:04] RELIGIOUS BOY WITHOUT GOD. BUT THAT DAY,
[2:58:06] HALLELUJAH, IT WASN'T JUST A MESSAGE BOY
[2:58:09] ON A MESSAGE PEW. IT WAS NOW THE MESSAGE
[2:58:11] WAS ON THE INSIDE. GOD STEPPED INTO THE
[2:58:14] chaos
[2:58:16] &gt;&gt; and brought order and made a preacher of
[2:58:18] the gospel out of him. And what about
[2:58:21] Jeremy Buts that sang this morning?
[2:58:23] laden with vices of video games,
[2:58:25] enslaved and snared, imprisoned,
[2:58:28] addicted. But when the spirit of God
[2:58:30] moved,
[2:58:31] ARE YOU WITH ME?
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE WAS A BURNING AS THEY PILED
[2:58:36] game after game. And now he sings the
[2:58:39] praises of God. He's married and and
[2:58:42] living an orderly life with WIFE AND TWO
[2:58:44] BABIES. WHY?
[2:58:46] BECAUSE GOD STEPPED DOWN INTO THE CHAOS.
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; And what ABOUT YOU? AND YOU AND WHAT
[2:58:53] SHOULD I SAY MORE AS I CAN CALL OUT NAME
[2:58:56] AFTER NAME AFTER NAME. EVERY ONE OF US
[2:58:58] HAVE A TESTIMONY. JOHNNY SMITH, YOU KNOW
[2:59:00] THE PATH YOU WAS ON. BUT WHAT HAPPENED
[2:59:02] TO YOU? GOD CALLED YOU OUT OF CHAOS INTO
[2:59:05] ORDER.
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; And he's not through.
[2:59:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said he's NOT THROUGH.
[2:59:11] HE'S STILL WORKING. HE'S STILL MOVING.
[2:59:14] HE'S STILL TRANSFORMING LIVES. AND WHAT
[2:59:17] ABOUT JOE AND STEPHANIE GREEN? ADDICTS
[2:59:19] OF THE WORST KIND. and society COULDN'T
[2:59:21] HELP THEM AND JAILS COULDN'T REFORM
[2:59:23] THEM. IT was complete chaos.
[2:59:27] &gt;&gt; But God stepped down into their chaos.
[2:59:31] &gt;&gt; And when he did and the spirit of God
[2:59:33] moved, order was brought to their life.
[2:59:38] &gt;&gt; And today the spirit of God moves. And
[2:59:42] when the word is spoken and light
[2:59:45] springs forth, it springs forth with
[2:59:47] healing in its wings. Amen.
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; And chaos
[2:59:52] is brought to order.
[2:59:55] &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing today.
[2:59:57] &gt;&gt; He's here to step
[3:00:00] into the disorder of your life and turn
[3:00:04] it from chaos
[3:00:06] into order.
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; Let's see. Musicians come.
[3:00:26] Hallelujah. Will you stand with me?
[3:00:32] Glory. There's an old song.
[3:00:35] Let go and let God have his wonderful
[3:00:37] way.
[3:00:43] you today, you can let go of the chaos
[3:00:47] in your life
[3:00:50] and you can let God have his way.
[3:00:56] When he does,
[3:00:58] sorrow vanishes.
[3:01:01] Your night will turn to day.
[3:01:06] Why don't you let go?
[3:01:09] Let go of the chaos
[3:01:12] and reach for God's divine order.
[3:01:15] Let go
[3:01:17] and let God have his wonderful
[3:01:23] way.
[3:01:25] Let go
[3:01:27] and let God have his way.
[3:01:34] Your sorrows
[3:01:39] your night.
[3:01:43] Let go
[3:01:45] and let God have his way. Sing it again
[3:01:50] to me.
[3:01:52] Oh, let go.
[3:01:54] &gt;&gt; Come on. You can leave that chaos this
[3:01:57] morning.
[3:01:59] &gt;&gt; You can let God in his way with your
[3:02:00] life.
[3:02:03] Amen.
[3:02:05] &gt;&gt; His knock on your heart is an
[3:02:07] invitation.
[3:02:08] &gt;&gt; His knock on your heart means you don't
[3:02:11] have to exclude him.
[3:02:14] &gt;&gt; You can let revival start on the inside
[3:02:16] and the reality of the living God be
[3:02:18] yours.
[3:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let go now.
[3:02:24] Let go on.
[3:02:26] Right now, where you are in your seat,
[3:02:29] let him have the chaos in your life.
[3:02:33] Let God have his wonderful
[3:02:38] way.
[3:02:40] Let go and let God have his way.
[3:02:48] Oh, your song
[3:02:51] will find
[3:02:54] your night.
[3:02:58] Let go
[3:03:00] and let God.
[3:03:03] Can you raise your hands to him? Let's
[3:03:05] worship him now.
[3:03:07] Let go
[3:03:09] and let God.
[3:03:14] If you got chaos in your life right now,
[3:03:18] I invite you to a place
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; where God will turn the disorder into
[3:03:24] order from chaos
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; and confusion
[3:03:31] to the order of the Holy Ghost.
[3:03:34] We can change you in his presence. make
[3:03:37] a new creation out of it
[3:03:40] &gt;&gt; where you won't just be religious
[3:03:43] but you'll be a powerhouse for God.
[3:03:48] &gt;&gt; But you got to LET GO IN THE CHAOS.
[3:03:51] You got to allow God to come and move in
[3:03:53] your life today.
[3:03:55] Ask him to allow him to say have your
[3:04:00] way Lord with me
[3:04:03] and your song
[3:04:06] will vanish
[3:04:08] your night
[3:04:11] today.
[3:04:12] Let go
[3:04:14] and let God have his way.
[3:04:24] Let God have his wonderful
[3:04:29] way
[3:04:32] and your
[3:04:35] happ
[3:04:43] will
[3:04:48] today that no
[3:04:53] God
[3:04:58] Reach out
[3:05:01] and touch the Lord
[3:05:04] as he passes
[3:05:07] by.
[3:05:10] Find he's not too busy
[3:05:14] to hear your heart.
[3:05:19] He's passing
[3:05:22] by this moment.
[3:05:24] Your needs
[3:05:27] to survive.
[3:05:29] Reach out and touch the Lord
[3:05:34] as he
[3:05:37] goes by.
[3:05:39] Reach out.
[3:05:42] Touch the Lord
[3:05:44] as he passes
[3:05:47] by.
[3:05:49] You'll find he's not too busy.
[3:05:55] Hear your heart cry
[3:06:00] as seen by your moment.
[3:06:09] Reach out and touch the Lord
[3:06:14] as he
[3:06:16] goes bow. Oh, reach out.
[3:06:21] Touch the Lord
[3:06:24] as he passes
[3:06:27] by.
[3:06:29] You'll find he's not too busy.
[3:06:35] Your heart's crying
[3:06:40] about this moment
[3:06:44] for needs to supply.
[3:06:48] Reach out and touch the Lord
[3:06:53] as he
[3:07:00] star lily of the valley.
[3:07:05] Let your sweet
[3:07:07] be my life.
[3:07:15] Oh
[3:07:17] sh show me
[3:07:20] how how to grow in beauty in God
[3:07:32] and thousands
[3:07:35] make me a reflection of your life.
[3:07:46] star shine on me.
[3:07:50] Little light shine through me in love.
[3:08:00] Leave me Lord I'll follow
[3:08:04] anywhere you open up the door.
[3:08:10] Oh,
[3:08:15] let your words speak to me. Show me
[3:08:19] things I've never seen
[3:08:22] before.
[3:08:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to be a witness.
[3:08:33] You can take what's wrong and make it
[3:08:37] right.
[3:08:43] I pray his star shine down on me.
[3:08:47] Let your love shine through me in the
[3:08:51] night.
[3:08:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, I see a world that's dying,
[3:09:02] wounded by the master of the sea.
[3:09:09] Oh, broken darkness.
[3:09:13] In the darkness,
[3:09:16] haunted by the years of past.
[3:09:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, but then I see you standing near.
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; When I see you standing near you, Lord,
[3:09:30] shining with compassion in you.
[3:09:39] I say Jesus shine down on me.
[3:09:45] Let your love shine through me in the
[3:09:48] dark.
[3:09:55] Lord, I'll follow
[3:09:59] anywhere you open up the door.
[3:10:09] Let your words speak to me.
[3:10:12] Show me things I've never seen
[3:10:16] before.
[3:10:19] Oh yes,
[3:10:22] Lord. I want to be with them.
[3:10:26] You can take what's wrong.
[3:10:35] Oh,
[3:10:37] shine on me.
[3:10:41] Let your love shine through me.
[3:10:44] Not only
[3:10:51] me, Lord, I'll follow
[3:10:55] anywhere you open up the door.
[3:11:00] Let your words speak.
[3:11:05] Let your words speak to me.
[3:11:08] Show me things I've never seen
[3:11:12] before.
[3:11:18] Lord, I want to be a witness.
[3:11:23] You change all
[3:11:26] you
[3:11:37] worship through me.
[3:11:40] I sing the last verse to you. Lord, I
[3:11:43] see a world.
[3:11:46] Going to see a world that's dying.
[3:11:50] Wounded by the master
[3:11:53] of the sea.
[3:11:57] Groen in the chaos.
[3:12:00] Oh, groping in the darkness
[3:12:05] only by the years past.
[3:12:13] There I see you standing near me,
[3:12:18] shining with compassion
[3:12:21] in your eyes.
[3:12:28] Jesus, shine down on me.
[3:12:32] Let your love shine through me tonight.
[3:12:39] Oh, lead me.
[3:12:42] Leave me Lord I'll follow
[3:12:46] anywhere we will adore
[3:12:56] that you're worthy to me.
[3:13:00] Show me things I've never seen
[3:13:03] before.
[3:13:10] I want to be a witness.
[3:13:14] You can take what's wrong.
[3:13:22] Oh,
[3:13:24] shine down on me.
[3:13:27] Let your love shine through me.
[3:13:31] God bless you this. Oh, lead me Lord.
[3:13:37] Lead me Lord. I follow you
[3:13:41] anywhere you open up the door.
[3:13:51] Let your words speak to me.
[3:13:55] Show me things I've never seen
