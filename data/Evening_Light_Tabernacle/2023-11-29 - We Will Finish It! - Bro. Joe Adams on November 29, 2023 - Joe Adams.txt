so thankful that we're your children so thankful for what you've done in this hour Lord you sent us a wonderful message and Lord we see the impact of this message go around the world we see it even here in our local assembly God we're witnesses to the the marvelous this work that you are doing Lord through the ministry of this message and God we're here today to take our stand with it Lord to raise the banner father to continue to press the battle we just pray God you give us strength Lord in the Gable end of our souls this evening father each and every one you know the situations Lord the difficulties that we each face as Believers but father we know in whom we have believed and Lord we're anchored in that we're steadfast in that we believe firmly in in the resurrection God and we know that there's a bride Lord and we know there's a Rapture that's been prepared Lord and we're just looking and waiting for thee Oh God to come and snatch her away father so Lord tonight we come to put our faith to work we come to Lord to allow your word to minister to our hearts to minister to our lives and God we invite you today just to have your own way whatever it may be Lord you see the word that you have given me Father for the tonight's service Lord and I just pray for direction even now father looking for the unction of the spirit God you would be the leader you would be the voice that would be behind the voice father and you would be the one that would Lord sit on the the ear and Lord just interpret the word for the believer that they may hear precisely what the spirit would have said so father we just give our time to you tonight we bless your name Lord and we ask that you have your way now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to look here in three portions of scripture tonight we're going to look at John 14:12 2 Corinthians 61-10 and 2 Corinthians 518 18-20 you happy to be here tonight are you happy to be a Christian amen well I'm happy to be here with you we find here in John 14:12 it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me in the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father let's look here in 2 Corinthians 61 says we then as workers together with him so notice we're workers together with Christ and in John 14:12 The Works that he did we are to do also says beseech you also that you've received not the grace of God in vain for he saith I have heard thee in in a Time accepted in a day of salvation have I secured thee be behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of Sal salvation giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things of proving ourselves as Ministers of God in much patience and afflictions in necessities and distress itties so each of us here tonight have a Ministry within ourselves and that Ministry is to to in Even in our afflictions in our Necessities in our distresses is not to bring any blame to the ministry he says in stripes and in imprisonments in tumults in labors in watchings in fastings by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by Love unfeigned by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the Left Hand by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well- known as dying and behold we are we live as chasten and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things that's our ministry tonight we find here in 2 Corinthians 5: 18 and all things are of God who ha reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has giv us the ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses upon them and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be reconciled to God you can have your seats tonight I want to speak to you tonight Lord willing for a little while and I wrestled over many directions to go here tonight because I have 62 pages and I'm not going to unload 62 pages on you tonight my family yeah that's what they said Glory said please do a part three part four whatever but please don't unload all the hay on the fork tonight I said you got it but I want to look tonight on we will finish it the last time I spoke I spoke about he will finish it and we was referring to Christ but tonight I want to bring it back home to us and I could go many different directions tonight and I believe that from the front end of this it may appear that I kind of was going to title this we have been anointed to finish it and that may be kind of where we lean but we just kind of feel the direction of the Lord but we find here in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 20 says now we are ambassadors for Christ so what is an ambassador brother Joe the Ambassador is an agean an elder an ambassador means to act as an ambassador sometimes merely to deliver a message for another without being empowered to do anything more than explain or enforce it notice and he's calling us we are ambassadors we are to Proclaim claim not our own ideas not our own thoughts not our own ways but we are to Proclaim his word his thoughts his ideas it's not for you and I to enforce it it's up to him to enforce it but we are his ambassadors that means we are we are on a mission to do the work that he's called us to do and it also here that's uh Bloomfield but also Webster would tell us an ambassador is a minister of the highest rank employed by one Prince or state at the court of another to manage the concerns of his own Prince or state and representing the dignity and the power of His Sovereign we're here to represent him when we start building our own kingdom we're not doing the father's business we're doing our own business but we find that we have been called ambassadors we got our work to do and we're called to not do our own work build our own kingdom build our own church but we're called to build his Kingdom to build his church to glorify his name to lift up his Banner so that he can be received in us and we be received in him notice an ambassador is one that is sent to do what the Sovereign would himself do if he were present see they were sent to make known the will of The Sovereign and to negotiate matters of Commerce of War confused tonight cuz we know that when Jesus bowed his head and he said that it was finished the entire Plan of Redemption was finished right there and everything that that entails was finished right there and brother br will tell us in why had to be a shepherd He says when the Great Shepherd was smitten the great sheep Shepherd or sheep Prophet when he was smitten back there he said it is finished in that minute as soon as the shepherd was smitten it was over sin was settled there was no more sin they were clean the penalty was paid the Believers whose name was written on the Book of Life predestinated from before the foundational world it was finished that very minute that Jesus said it was finished do you believe that he said he the great Shepherd had come for his sheep it was finished God's right hand was pulled from his bosom smitten then on Easter he returned it amen he raised up again to his bosom and he extended it down to you and I in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original Garden from which sin took us from so when he bowed his head and said that it was finished everything that Christ died for the entire Plan of Redemption was finished right there your healing was finished your deliverance was finished your salvation was finished your Holy Ghost was finished your rapture was finished everything that it entails was finished right there and you say well brother Joe why did you preach he will finish it but because we're human right and sometimes we're in the midst of the battle we're in the midst of the trial sickness has ravished our body we begin to wonder God when will you finish this come on somebody work with me tonight we wonder we question God when will you finish this when will you bring my healing to pass when will you deliver me from these tormented when will I receive the Holy Ghost I want you to know that's the human nature but it's already finished he's already started the work and what he started he will finish it and when he bowed his head and he took those nail Prince and he took that Spear and he said it is finished the entire plan Hallelujah of redemption was finished God right there had encapsulated a body and he encapsulated a bride and he finished the work right there and your name was on that book your name was in that Plan of Redemption when he sent Christ to be the lamb slain you were right there with them and when he said it was finished there ain't one here tonight whose name was on that book that won't be finished it's paid for it's a finished work but I want you to know tonight just as he finished the work that was a lot for him we're here to finish the work that's been allotted to us we got a work to do brother and sister we can't just put it all on Christ notice so Jesus had a work and just as he finished a work that was a lot of for him so must we finish the work that was a lot of for us some of you here tonight are sick and body but you got to work to claim your healing to not be discouraged not be dismayed not be uh fearful and fretful but to believe you got a work to do notice Revelations 19 and verse 6 and and I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude and as a voice of many Waters and a voice of Mighty Thunder and saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready so that phrase made herself ready means to make the necessary preparations She's Not Just twilling her thumbs hoping and waiting pining away one day he's coming no she's making preparations what is she doing she's trying to find what is the things that please him I'm going to do the things that please him I'm going to do the things that make him happy I'm going to do the things that bring attention to myself so that he will desire me otherwise what is she doing she's making the necessary preparations so that she can be received as his wife so that she can be received as the one that has the privilege to to be called Miss Jesus Christ the same character that he had the same spirit that he had the same mind that he had she makes herself ready to be a wife oh come on now some of you young girls tonight are making the necessary preparations to be a wife some of you seven eight years old already got your marriage planned out who's already going to be in your re your wedding reception all the Bridesmaids and who the guy is and you done got his all his guys picked out and the colors and and you're only eight or nine years old oh see you're making preparations we find here in verse eight says and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the linen are the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the Mary supper of the lamb and he sath unto me these are the true sayings of God that word called there is the Greek word Calo it means to Bear a name or a title so we have been given the title of bride now I I don't want you to let this pass over you because we speak about the bride and we talk about the bride but I want you to understand there is a true distinction from being the church and from being the bride and you must recognize who you are and who you are not you are not the church but you are the bride that means you have been given the responsibility or the privilege to bear that title because why because you have been called out you have been called to the marage supper of the Lamb you have made the necessary preparations and because of that he's called you and he's given you the honor to Bear the title of bride see not everyone can bear this title or this name but it's only for the chosen only for the elect those that were chosen before the foundation of the world in the Rapture message brother BR says the very Word Church means called out as Moses called a nation out of a Nation the holy spirit is calling a bride out of a church how many of you are that bride tonight what a glorious calling to know that that's your distinction to know that you have been called to that honor I flew all the way to Hawaii to propose to my wife you know that was a good thing it was a great feat we've been happily married 21 years at least in my eyes but he left all the glory to come and propose to you yes to send you a message to send you an eleazer to get you ready and that's what he's that's what this message is about is to prepare a bride ready for her husband and just as he finished his work we're going to finish our work yes oh I just love this notice he says now as Moses called a nation out of a Nation the holy spirit is calling the bride out of a church a church out of of a church members from every denomination making up the bride the bride tree how many of you were catholic or come from a Catholic Family what about Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal we come from all some of you many of us are message but it's got to be more than just message by denomination or message by title we're message because why because we're Pentecostal by experience and we're messaged by experience not by some title not because because we just believe God sent a prophet and we believe the teachings of a prophet but we're message we're we're Pentecostal because we had a Pentecostal experience we' met a living God and he's alive in us and it's not us that liveth but Christ that liveth in us and the life I live I live now for for him notice now he said a bride coming out call and that's the one the brid tree is the bride rather is the one that's going to be in the Rapture that alone nothing but the bride the elected ones forn by God from the beginning the father's spiritual genes so this title of bride is only for the elected ones because he's only coming for that one when I proposed to Jessica and we came and we we consummated our wedding vows I wasn't expecting two or three ladies up here that I was going to choose at that moment I'd made my choice I've made my decision and so has Christ made his decision he's made his choice and that choice is you and I and many Believers around the world tonight who are privileged to Bear the title of Miss Jesus Christ Revelations 2 and verse1 17 says he that hath his ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in a stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it now Jesus is the hidden Mana Christ is the church's Mana this is from question and answers 1961 what is mana mana is the Old Testament was what got came down from heaven fresh every night to sustain the church in his journey he says now in the New Testament what is hidden Mana a little while the world seeth me no more hidden yet you shall see me I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and Christ is the hidden Mana that comes from God out of Heaven aresh every day every day says oh we can't say well two weeks ago I had a great experience with God but what about right now well you know at Easter Camp I had a great meeting and experience with God or at Ohio Ohio Youth Camp I had a great experience with God but what about tonight what about this day what about this week what about where your experience that day it's got to be a freshh up to dat to experience each and every day if we plan on finishing the work that's a lot for us we can't just rely on something of yesterday we can't rely on an experience of of of a camp meeting last week or last year or whatever or your mom or dad's experience you got to have your very own uptodate genuine Pentecostal Born Again sin killing sky blue God call to experience each and every day Church to make it out of here now notice now he says every day fresh a new blessing a new something coming from God the hidden Mana coming down from God out of heaven and we Feast upon this Mana which is Christ and he sustains us through the Journey till we reach the land to the other side so to the Overcomer has been given the right to Feast on hidden Mana or let me say it like this to the Overcomer in each age has been given the right to to Feast on the message of that age and to Feast on the hidden Mana of that age she's been given a right to receive of the mysteries of God because the mysteries of God are only going to be revealed to an elect group of people so the hidden Mana that's revealed to the Overcomer is the word for their day and so we find now that this is a special group and this group has been given a white stone which is a pure revelation in a pure a pure word which means it tells them who their name is their name is in that Revelation because I can't tell you you had the Holy Ghost brother L but you know yes the Bible says you get a new name which no man knoweth but saving he but has it so when you get the Holy Ghost I can't tell you you got it I can't tell you you you don't have it you have to have that personal pure Revelation a white stone and in that stone a new name notice that old name of Joe Adams that old name of Aaron Oglesby that old name of el lell that old name that old personality that old nature no that old Nature has to be shooked away and God gives you a new revelation that you come from God you're going back to God you've received the Holy Ghost and now he's called you bride he's not calling you Church he's not calling you Pentecostal he's not calling you Methodist he ain't calling you Baptist he ain't calling you message he's calling you my bride and that's who we are today a new name that he's given you saing no man knowth saving he that receiveth and I'm here to tell you I'm here to testify tonight I have received a new name I've received the message of the hour I've received the prophet's word and he's changed me from the old man to a new man and he's given me a new name what's in the name brother Joe he can take a sinner and make a Son of God out of them he had to change Jacob's name Jacob being Shyer he changed his name to be a Prince with god oh look at I'm looking at a bunch of princes tonight oh a bunch of shyers used to be but God rich in Mercy come down and he's giving you a new name w we got a reason to shout about it tonight that old man is dead he ain't alive anymore but God has resurrected he come alive in us and he changed our name he changed our desires he changed our nature and he's changed us from old sinners into new sons of God oh he says now in the first seal the it's only revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church he goes I hope that the church truly understands that what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand it so notice right here in the first seal he makes a distinction we put our own words to it as ministers and we say I know longer call you church but I'll call you bride CU that's essentially what God was doing he was causing a distinction calling a bride out of a church you say brother Joe why are you laboring this cuz I'm trying to show you who you are so you understand you're going to finish it cuz if you doubt who you are then you doubt that you can finish what he's what you started but if you know who you are you know whose you are and you know that you're one in Christ and just as he finish you will finish so I'm going to labor this evening just on this little bit CU I want you to know who you are tonight that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ I didn't call you bride brother Aaron didn't call you bride brother Tim didn't call you bride brother Timothy whoever brother bradam we didn't call your bride but God Almighty he come down through a prophet's voice and he says I want you to catch who you are tonight I want to cause the distinction tonight he's notied in paraphrasing I will no longer call you a church but I'm call calling your bride I'm causing a distinction I'm calling a bride out of a church I'm calling people out of a denomination I'm calling my sons and daughters they're going to come from every Walk of Life some's going to come from the streets fam many are going to come from the houses of God but yet God is doing the work God is doing the calling and he's calling the bride for this hour somebody that'll receive a message and be transformed by the word of God hallu now inside of each of us tonight the material lays within you to finish I know you look in the mirror and you see failures but in you right now who has the Holy Ghost tonight everything the prophet of God said everything that you need in this journey is in you right then when you receive the Holy Ghost you don't need no more faith you got it it's there there ain't nothing that you're lacking it's there everything that we have need up in this journey and some of you it's been a long journey but you're still here you're still on the road you're still traveling you're still believing you're still finishing notice now he says we know that there's going to be a bride this isn't the marriage of the lamb and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as sure to be as God is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up the bride is going to be his church and they're going to be they're going to appear before him without a spot or wrinkle notice and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready if you notice it said that she had made herself ready so the material they have we have the material right now we have over 1200 sermons we have the Bible unadulterated word of God we have everything that we need all the material to make ourselves ready if you're not ready it's because you're not making the necessary preparations see everything that we have need of is already there 1 Corinthians 3 and verse 9 so we have something to do Church amen the Bible says for we are laborers together with God 1 Corinthians 15 verse 58 therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord so we got to be about the father's business not our own business we find here as a bride we got to make the necessary preparations we have a work to do we must be fellow laborers with him we got to remain unmovable in the work of the lord we must overcome come on right otherwise it takes an effort to overcome how many believe that some of you Elder folks tonight you understand the effort it takes to overcome to continue to serve and to to continue to press to battle through many hard and difficult trials see it takes an effort to overcome it takes determination to overcome it takes perseverance to overcome and it takes work it takes work to overcome listen what brother Brown says in the marriage of the Lamb he says so many says well if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him he said but that's he said but that's up to you and we want God to do all the work but what about us we got a work to do we got to finish it he's done his part we got to do our part heart that's right he says you see you got something to do they that overcame shall inherit all things they that overcome you had the power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready brother sister I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then saying blessed is he that overcome you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through and many times that's what we want God take this from me God do this God you know you see the trial just make it easy God push me through the pipe pull me out the other side let it all be God and we give God the glory and God's just waiting on us God's waiting on us to do something to prove that we are in fact Believers notice but you got to make decisions for yourself I got to make decisions for myself and in doing that we show our faith in our respects to God so we question why do we have trials cuz God's got a pipe for you God's got a pipe for you and you're going to get through it you may go kicking you may go screaming you may go clawing but you're going to go through it because I'm looking at Overcomers tonight I'm preaching to Overcomers people that are not just expecting God to do it all but God help me to do my part he says Abraham was promised a child but he must maintain his promise for 25 years notice Abraham had to hold on for 25 years you talking about some ups and downs some dips and valleys some struggles some mind battles yes sir he wasn't getting any older his body was dying by the day her womb was already dead how in the world is this going to come to pass but he said for 25 years he must maintain must maintain the promise through all the ups and downs that he held the Temptations in those 25 years but he held to the Word of Promise and we've been waiting on a Rapture we've been waiting on a body change but one day brother and sister it's going to happen somebody is going to finish it they're going to be the manifestation of the word that's been revealed for this hour one day we're going to see loved ones walk through the door and I pray hey we're going to have to change service time between 6:00 and 9: cuz that's when it's going to happen it's 11:00 12:00 bit ain't going to cut it we're going to be already gone but one day between 600 and 9 we're going to see loved ones come walking through and we're going to know it's on at that point see we're going to finish the work that's been alloted for us we're going to finish the scriptures that are responsible for the bride we're going to finish our work cuz we've been anointed to finish cuz I'm sure showing you now who you are and by knowing who you are then you know who you are not and you can't be confused wondering what if I will how I will you just worry about rest on god notice Israel was promised a Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch you know sometimes we we brag about wanting to be Fighters and we fight and we fight and my goodness we fight in the backyard but in the front yard we Brothers some of us are poor fighter you get sick you get a sniffle you get a toothache and you think you got cancer we talking about fighting we want to fight the good fight of Faith you got to press through you got to believe I know we're all nature different but we're called to fight listen he said you got to fight for every inch of ground no wherever the soldier a foot tread upon he said that I've given you God said to Joshua it was all there the land was there God gave it to them but they must fight for it and the land is given to us Church you got to fight for it fight for your children fight for your healing fight for your deliverance fight for your Holy Ghost fight for your experience fight for your church fight for the ministry fight to be the bride it's time that we fight don't be afraid to fight the Bible tells us the violent take it by force they're Fighters so this word I look this word up cuz you hear it all the time you got to fight for something you ever heard that you got to fight for something or someone so that means to fight in honor of someone well we're fighting in honor of the king tonight I'm not fighting in honor of some movie star I'm not fighting in honor of some ball star I remember when I was in high school in junior high somebody pick on one of your buddies you go to fight for him well I ain't fighting for my buddy tonight but I'm fighting for the body of Christ tonight and that's what we do brother Aaron and I brother Tim and brother Timothy and other ministers when we study we get into that word cuz we're fighting for you we're fighting for your families we're fighting for your marriages we're fighting for your healing we're fighting for your deliverance we're fighting for your sanity we are fighting to elevate your faith so you can in fact believe what the word says about you that you know who you are and that you've been anointed in this hour to finish the work that's been allotted for you notice to fight in honor of someone or something to struggle to gain or secure someone or something to go to battle for the bus benefit of someone or something to fight for something I don't know what you're here for tonight probably because we have to have church on Wednesday night but you're fighting I hope you're fighting for something that's bigger than you fighting for a cause that's bigger than you bigger than your own ideas bigger than your own agenda brother man says I've been behind the pull pit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been fight constantly he contended and contended and contended for the faith he stood when many of his own contemporaries turned their back on him he stood for Divine Healing but more importantly he stood that God was going to Rapture a church he stood between the church and the bride and he was calling out when the church was saying we're all one but he knew there was a distinction in and he was contending for he was fighting for 30 years behind the pulpit in the ministry and he said every bit of it has been a fight constant it certainly has but we must fight if we should Reign so we find out that the bride has to make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that's set before us we must lay them aside ourself so your biggest hindrance is yourself so you got to lay yourself your ideas your thoughts aside every sin I'm not saying you're a sinner I'm not saying you're a sinful but when your thoughts exhort over the thoughts of God or the word of God then it becomes sin and you must lay those things aside see you come lay them aside we got to do that ourselves so if we're to fight for the cause of Christ if we're going to hold the banner of this mess as a word then we got to lay down everything that's not like God and we must be willing to fight make ourselves ready fight and be battle ready fight to be word ready fight to be Rapture Ready sir Revelations 19:7 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him notice for the marriages come there's no longer waiting and waiting for that day the marriage is come and now the bride has made herself ready his wife has made herself ready brother says in the birth pain said the Bible said that his wife has made her self ready at the End of the Age how did she make herself ready to becoming his wife what does she do what kind of garment she had on his own word he says what kind of garment she had on his own word she was dressed in his own righteousness so she's not dressed in her own ideas ideology she's not dressed in Traditions of man man-made Creeds man-made religions she's dressed in his word she's dressed not in her she's dressed herself in the message of the hour which is him which is his word so we find that the Bride of each age dressed herself in the word of that age and she received the messenger of that age so what the word speaks of him also speaks of her for the two have now become one so you can't say something about me but what you offend my wife and you can't say something about my wife but what you offend me and you can't say anything about his bride but what you offend him and when you touch her you touch the apple of his eye that's the Center focus of his thinking oh Church don't you see how special you are how do you think you can't win you can't lose that's right you can't lose we're going to finish and I'm going to tell you we're going to finish strong we're going to finish Mighty we're not going to go down barely scraping by G crawling through the door trying to get in we are going to finish this fight notice now brother B says but the spirit that was in him he sent back down to the church so the church when this Covenant is brought into full strength when the Covenant is confirmed with God the church the people that goes into this body here to be his bride will be exactly the same spirit that was upon Christ now for those that have a problem with emotion those that have a problem with signs and wonders those that have a problem with the supernatural then you got a problem with this quote yes because the people that goes into the body to be his bride will be exactly The Same Spirit that was upon Christ notice now doing the same things the same Ministry the same power and it will come together and be word by word the same confirming the Covenant see you find to there's minister they refuse they don't want to testify what God is doing or what God has done they feel like if they testify then they're pulling something away from brother brandom or they're pulling something away from Christ you're not pulling anything away from brother Brandon to testify of the miraculous Supernatural power of God his great hand to deliver to to heal of cancer or whatever it may be to call prodical back home that's not pulling anything away from a prophet that's not pulling anything away from Jesus Christ that is proof that the word works that is proof that he is the same yesterday today and forever that is proof that you are Miss Jesus Christ for the spirit that was in him is now in you confirming the word word with signs and wonders it's proof Church don't be afraid to declare what God has done in even like Tabernacle don't be afraid to declare the miraculous power of almighty God it is proof that this message is real and God is here and he's transforming life and he's calling out of people God is here doing that man ain't called you God has called you God is declaring this work with signs and wonders following the ministry it's proof that the ministry Min that was in Christ and operated through his Prophet is the same Ministry that's in operation through his bride same signs same Wonder same word same in every detail except one part the Corporal body that's the only difference see it's proof that the bride has become one with the groom doing the same thing same Ministry same power word by word the same confirm confirming the Covenant so if your life is not producing any signs any wonders any miraculous any Supernatural then you are not in Covenant because the Bible says these signs will follow shall follow the believer now I'm not to say that everybody's going to do Supernatural things but the signs will be among the Believers the nine spiritual gifts will be in operation in every local Assembly not every church is going to have the fivefold but every church will have the nine spiritual gifts notice now excuse me here he said God cannot change he's unchangeable God times change people change God is infinite he cannot change he must remain the same yesterday today and forever he must always remain and if we believe this to be the word of God we can put our confidence on anything that he says so it's proof church it's proof that he hasn't changed when he's doing the same things today that he did then is proof that he's the same and it's proof that you're a bride because he's only going to do it through his body brother said he took Christ which is a seat of Abraham on Calvary he tore him apart he took the spirit off of him he put his body in the grave his soul in the hell raised him up on the third day raised his body brought it up to Glory there he sent Spirit back down kept the body at the right hand his side he said he sent the spirit back down to live in a church to make the church just so much with the Life of Christ that in the Resurrection the two will come together bride and bridegroom the church and Christ will be exactly alike with the same kind of ministry oh my so the bride has a Ministry yes sir well I thought that was just for brother Aaron Brother him brother Donnie these Great Men of God that we we set on pedestals because we reverenced them because of the gift that God's placed in our life now the bride unequivocally the bride has a Ministry notice now he says but when the current is Flowing freely the word of God it expresses itself The Works that I do shall you do also and in the last days it shall come to pass behold I'll send Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and in there there would be a Time come forth when we we could express himself or when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church to have preeminence in his church that's what he's looking for is preeminence that word preminent means to have first place first in everything first in importance first in honor first first in exaltation that's what he wants in your life to be first first before the video games first for the YouTube for the reals for the Tik toks for all these other things that consume your time he wants to preeminence and let me just say it he will have preeminence in his bride I'm not saying you can't do human human things but he will have first place in your life okay notice now now see the anointed Anointed with the word no let me go back excuse me let me back up and there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people see we've been anointed to finish now the anointed people oh my to bring back that anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by why accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word when Eve turned down he comes back and we accept so that's what we've accepted we've accepted our part of the ministry to fulfill the part that he didn't fulfill they said brother branam question and answers would the bride of Christ would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before for the Rapture he says sure that's what's going on right now I think this is a beautiful quote sure that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour see the bride of Christ sure she consists of Apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry a great ministry it's a Min it's the ministry of the hour and it'll be so humble so we have a work we have a Ministry it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one so does the bride and Christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same so when God calls a man he calls his wife and when God's called when he sent Christ to do the work of redemption he didn't do it just for the sheer pack of dying on the cross he did it for his wife he did it to pay the penalty that we couldn't pay so we find here he says now notice and the world is falling apart he said the hour that we're living in oh God the world is falling apart they in the hangers there hangs in the hangers bombs there's there's hangs to things just to be exactly the church is ready she sealed in ready to come there will be a great outpouring of the spirit notice the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come he said there will be a great outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church or take her into the skies exactly because see the church the word the bride see in Christ to Ministry his ministry is in his bride which is his body the celestial body you see mean when I say the supernatural body of of his here on the supernatural body on the earth his spirit is is in there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding see they become one he takes them just a little minority in the last days but see his ministry is in the ministry of his bride he says but before at this time there's going to be a great outpouring of the spirit see a great outpouring that's what we've been witnessing today is a great outpouring of signs and wonders of the Supernatural Supernatural outpouring not only in this church even life but in many churches around the world a great outpouring of the spirit of God not just in word but in manifestation in signs and wonders prodical are coming home sick have been healed demons have been cast out families have been restored Hearts have been discerned Church situations have been discerned my wife and I were just over in Belgium and I got a testimony from the service from one of the brothers just a couple days after we got home he said I just wanted to let you know that God used you beyond you could ever imagine last WI day this morning a brother in the church asked for forgiveness to the whole church the day before you preached he had this meeting with the pastor today he testified and he said it seemed like brother Joe was in that meeting too how scripture was repeated exactly the same like the day before he said a lot of lives have been impacted when I woke up that morning there was a Wednesday morning I woke up and I my wife can tell you I wrestled and wrestled and wrestled with the thought that that I was being led to preach I'm like why are you wanting me to preach this here I mean this is not a sermon for overseas this is not a sermon for I want to be an evangelist I want to rip you know rip it up but it wasn't that type of sermon our preach a message on finding forgiveness in the midst of pain and it was exactly what the church needed see because that's the great outpouring of the Supernatural That's the great outpouring of the spirit of God it may be in all the emotion it may be in all the hurah we had a a magnificent service there with Brother David mayor the Sunday following and God came down and done many mighty works there great miraculous signs wers many sick were healed and different things of that nature but yet in this service unexpected place in an unexpected way God brought down and healed the church body because there was things going on and for a man to get up in front of the entire church and ask forgiveness that's nothing but the hand of God a super outpouring and that's what we can expect from the ministry of the Bride for the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ are one in the same church he is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and he is still here moving and working in situations and families and homes and lives he is still God and the work that he did we're here to finish the work for us notice let me figure out a place to start bringing this down I didn't say I was bringing it down figure out a place to start brother BR says when he begins to reveal himself into the seed form again the same one that went into the ground come back to be the bride just the bride in the groom is the same Flesh and Blood the same Ministry the same things doing just exactly what he done I'm so sick and tired of hearing these men preach a an emotionless religion preaching there's no power preaching there's no we got the authority of of the word of God to have the same signs the same wonders the same Supernatural to lay hands on the sick and expect God to recover expecting to be healed expect prodical to come home expect the supernatural we got to right why because we got the same Ministry Jesus never walked up to the blinded eyes and wondered who he was or wonder could this be wonder if it was going to happen he knew who he was he knew he was called he knew he was anointed and we have been anointed Church to do the very same thing the same Ministry that was in him is the same ministry that's an operation in the bride today don't you fear to lay hands on the sick don't you fear to ask God anything for the ministry of the Bride is the same Ministry of Christ it's one in the same and we will finish this Satan we will finish this work we will not back down we will not digress we will not Retreat and we will not surrender we will stay true to the promises of God we will wave the Heavenly Banner that he is still King of Kings you don't want no emotion in your church that's fine bury that dead church but we got Christ in this church we got the same anointing the same power the same Holy Ghost the same sign with the same wonders bringing the same results and just as he finished we're going to finish I said we're going to finish notice and he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz why he said cuz it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all Revelations and in the others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom then it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him oh my do you realize your him tonight oh my if you really realize who you are that you are him there wouldn't be no we Fe weak feeble needes in here tonight there would be no weak constitutions tonight you would Square your shoulders back and say yes bless God I'm a son I'm a daughter of God I got a right to the promise I got a right to come before the Throne of God I got a right to ask God anything I got a right to approach my heavenly father I got a Right To The King and I know that he will extend that golden scepter to me and I'm coming tonight I'm believing tonight I'm giving witness tonight that he is a back the same yesterday today and forever this ain't my Ministry this is his ministry working through me as his body notice she is him as man and woman are one the woman takes from his side or the woman is taken from his side she had taken his Spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side both mechanics and Dynamics the wife she's both mechanics and Dynamics word and emotion signs and wonders and the revealed word the revealed word notice those in the bride only do his will yes no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayth the Lord are they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word notice he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through his bride we will finish yes see there wasn't a lot of work for him to finish and he did and and there's a lot of work for you to finish and we will musicians come we will finish it now I'm not finished I'm just taking a break till next time notice she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now oh come on somebody yes see but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for a specific time that's right are
