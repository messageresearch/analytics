[32:28] psalms 40.
[32:30] i'd like to say it's
[32:31] honor to be here again tonight as
[32:33] brother
[32:34] joe said it's
[32:35] it's a wonderful thing to come the house

[32:50] as you know we're getting ready for a

[33:00] for a little while here
[33:01] amen sister adrian is going to be uh
[33:05] getting married to brother ben steeman
[33:07] there's already some gathering here for
[33:08] that amen and so
[33:11] some of the
[33:12] first inbound from florida they're
[33:14] already here so things are getting real
[33:16] real quick
[33:18] but uh so we're gonna need to some help
[33:20] afterwards brothers to take some things
[33:22] off the platform so they can prepare for
[33:24] that but amen god's been good to us and
[33:28] we're actually looking forward to this
[33:29] day it's not a day that we're dreading
[33:31] per se but we're very happy for adrian
[33:33] and brother ben and and just believe the
[33:36] lord's going to bless them amen for
[33:38] however long he tarries amen with a
[33:40] wonderful marriage
[33:42] amen psalms 40 and verse 1 what was what
[33:44] started isaiah 61 and the spirit of the
[33:48] lord god is upon me because the lord
[33:50] hath anointed me to preach good tidings
[33:53] and to the meek
[33:54] he has sent me to bind up the
[33:56] brokenhearted to proclaim liberty
[33:59] to the captives and the opening of the
[34:00] prison to them that are bound
[34:02] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[34:04] lord the day of vengeance of our god to
[34:06] comfort
[34:08] all that mourn
[34:09] to appoint unto them that mourn in zion
[34:12] to give unto them beauty for ashes
[34:14] the oil of joy for mourning the garment
[34:16] of praise
[34:18] for the spirit of heaviness that they
[34:20] might be called trees of righteousness
[34:23] the planning of the lord
[34:25] that he might be glorified
[34:28] also psalms 40 and verse 1 says i waited
[34:31] patiently
[34:32] for the lord and he inclined unto me
[34:35] and heard my cry
[34:37] and he brought me up also out of a
[34:39] horrible pit
[34:41] out of the mirey clay
[34:42] and set my feet upon a rock
[34:45] and established my goings
[34:47] he hath put a new song in my mouth
[34:50] even praising to our god
[34:52] many shall see it in fear and shall
[34:55] trust in the lord
[34:58] amen we'll let you be seated
[35:03] oh
[35:05] actually
[35:06] it's kind of strange
[35:08] most of the time you preach something at
[35:09] home first and maybe take it somewhere
[35:11] and minister
[35:12] but i've actually spoke from this
[35:14] thought a couple of times
[35:16] one at a youth camp in ohio and another
[35:19] brother
[35:20] kelly hildebrandt's just
[35:22] one of the last times i ministered
[35:25] but the lord gave me this thought as i
[35:27] was actually sitting there on the pew
[35:29] at my mom's memorial service
[35:32] and it just dropped in my heart a new
[35:34] song to sing
[35:36] a new song to sing
[35:38] and you know i begin to think on the
[35:40] things that we have read and
[35:43] begin to look at the scriptures that he
[35:45] would appoint
[35:46] unto them that mourn and zion to give to
[35:49] them beauty for ashes
[35:51] the oil of joy for mourning
[35:54] the garment of praise
[35:56] for the spirit of heaviness
[35:59] i thought it was very interesting that
[36:00] he would uh he would he would bring he
[36:02] would type out praise as a garment or he
[36:05] would equate it to be in a garment it
[36:07] would have to be something that you
[36:08] would have to put on
[36:10] it wouldn't be something that you could
[36:12] just manufacture per se or or
[36:15] but you would have to actually take it
[36:17] as you would take your clothes as you
[36:19] did for this evening and you chose what
[36:21] what what clothes to put on or what to
[36:23] do
[36:24] and you chose a certain dress or a
[36:26] certain shirt or certain pair of pants
[36:28] but you had to put that on it had to be
[36:30] an action it had to be something that
[36:32] you had to do and this is how you how
[36:35] the prophet isaiah would speak about he
[36:37] said the garment of praise for the
[36:40] spirit of heaviness you have to actually
[36:42] take the praise as a garment and put it
[36:45] on
[36:46] amen and begin to praise god no matter
[36:48] what the circumstances are around you
[36:51] and no matter what is going on you still
[36:53] have to put that on amen to be able to
[36:55] break that spirit of heaviness
[36:57] but you know as brother as i look into
[36:59] this brother brown would make this
[37:01] thought and say this in his thought he
[37:02] said many today are becoming discouraged
[37:06] you know and when we become discouraged
[37:08] it takes our strength from us
[37:10] it makes us to where we want to just
[37:11] give up sometimes and and satan likes to
[37:14] pull us away and and may and maybe
[37:17] begins to make us think nobody cares or
[37:19] nobody understands and you know how his
[37:22] thoughts begin to run rampant thoughts
[37:24] of unworthiness thoughts of you're never
[37:26] going to make it thoughts of it's too
[37:28] much to handle it's as a heaviness a
[37:31] great weight that sets on you and it
[37:33] seems to squeeze the life out of you and
[37:36] discouragement begins to set in and
[37:39] darkness begins to close in and it turns
[37:42] into depression and other things that
[37:44] goes with that he said but you know
[37:45] today he said we shouldn't be
[37:47] discouraged he said what we need to do
[37:49] is take courage
[37:51] what we need to be is encouraged he said
[37:54] trials may come we're never promised to
[37:56] be immune from a trial amen we're never
[37:59] promised to be immune from losing a
[38:00] loved one we're never promised from
[38:02] being immune from a hard day or hard
[38:05] time he said those things would come but
[38:07] every every time it comes he will give
[38:09] you grace to go through that trial
[38:12] amen if the mountain's too high to go
[38:14] over or too deep to go under too wide to
[38:17] go around it he will always give you
[38:19] grace to go through every trial
[38:22] he said so just don't worry but keep
[38:24] your eyes on christ for he's the one
[38:27] that's going to take you through it amen
[38:29] and he said if you notice it's when
[38:31] you're discouraged
[38:32] that's when the devil tries to really
[38:34] pour it on you
[38:36] that's when he tries to get to you is
[38:37] when you're discouraged and you know and
[38:40] then the thoughts of you're never going
[38:41] to make it or you're never going to
[38:43] overcome it or you're never going to get
[38:45] ahead or you're never going to get
[38:47] better you got to cast all of that aside
[38:49] he said because you know god don't want
[38:51] you frowning god wants you to be happy
[38:54] amen the human heart was to be made
[38:56] happy worry causes cancer and temper
[39:00] causes cancer he says so don't ever be
[39:02] upset set just walking his love knowing
[39:05] that while you're walking you're walking
[39:07] with him
[39:08] and while you're walking with him
[39:10] nothing can harm you
[39:12] hallelujah so that's enough to be
[39:14] encouraged about to know that i'm with
[39:16] him amen that i'm i'm not walking and
[39:19] leo to see it by myself i'm not in this
[39:21] trial by myself i'm not i'm not lost a
[39:24] loved one and i'm all by myself i i i'm
[39:27] not you know in some room but i'm with
[39:30] him
[39:31] amen he's with me he promised he would
[39:34] never leave me or forsake me amen and so
[39:37] as we look at this and i got to thinking
[39:39] on this and i've been reading this this
[39:41] passion translation i want to take a
[39:42] little bit because
[39:44] in romans 8 verse 28 it says we are
[39:46] convinced that every detail of our lives
[39:51] is continually woven together for our
[39:53] good
[39:54] for we are his
[39:56] and we have been called to fulfill his
[39:59] design purpose
[40:01] for he knew all about us before we were
[40:03] ever born and he destined us from the
[40:06] beginning to share the likeness of his
[40:08] son this means the son is the oldest
[40:10] among a vast family of brothers and
[40:13] sisters who will become just like him
[40:16] and having determined our destiny ahead
[40:18] of time he called us to himself and
[40:21] transferred his perfect righteousness to
[40:24] everyone that he called and those who
[40:27] possess his perfect righteousness he has
[40:29] co-glorified with his son so what does
[40:32] all this mean if god has determined to
[40:35] stand with us
[40:37] tell me who can then ever stand against
[40:40] us
[40:42] if god has determined to stand with us
[40:46] tell me who can ever stand against us
[40:49] for god has proven his love by giving us
[40:52] his greatest treasure his son and since
[40:55] god freely offered up him as a sacrifice
[40:57] for us all he certainly won't withhold
[41:00] anything else from us as he is to give
[41:03] who then would dare to accuse those whom
[41:06] god has chosen and loved to be is god
[41:09] himself is the judge who has issued his
[41:12] final verdict over them not guilty
[41:17] therefore nothing can harm you there's
[41:19] neither powers neither things present
[41:22] neither thing's future neither things
[41:24] anything can separate you from you he
[41:27] you are with him
[41:31] you didn't come by your own will you
[41:33] came by his choosing
[41:35] you're not here because you chose to be
[41:37] here you're here because he chose you to
[41:40] be here
[41:42] hallelujah and if he chose you to be
[41:44] here what can the devil do about it
[41:48] if god the power of the that created the
[41:51] universe destiny has chosen your destiny
[41:55] to put you in this time that we're
[41:57] living in the most evil laser ever was
[42:00] the most difficult time there ever was
[42:02] he placed you in this tie he has like he
[42:05] has a he has a watch over you and he's
[42:08] concerned about you he's not just
[42:10] letting you off by yourself and you're
[42:11] out there wandering around no god has
[42:14] predetermined your destiny
[42:16] [Music]
[42:17] hallelujah and he said we never came in
[42:20] by our own will he elected us he brought
[42:23] us to him so it is his business to take
[42:27] care of what he's brought to himself
[42:33] hallelujah you need to tell the devil
[42:35] you're god's business
[42:38] amen you're god's business therefore he
[42:40] would say no man can pluck them from my
[42:42] hands amen is the father who takes care
[42:45] of it who's got more power than god
[42:49] so what kind of power have you got over
[42:51] you that will take care of you it's the
[42:53] power that created the universe it's the
[42:56] power that put the solar system in this
[42:58] place it's the power that pre-that put
[43:01] every star and every moon and every
[43:03] planet in this place that power is
[43:06] watching over you
[43:09] amen
[43:10] oh but you know god loves to test his
[43:13] people
[43:14] and we know every child that comes to
[43:15] god to be tested
[43:17] there's no exceptions every one of us
[43:18] will be tested
[43:20] you may be tested in different places
[43:22] than i'm tested in but we're all going
[43:24] to be tested amen maybe tonight you're
[43:26] sick maybe it's just a little child
[43:29] training
[43:30] just a little testing don't be
[43:31] discouraged about that god's still on
[43:33] the throne
[43:36] his power his word is still in effect
[43:39] hallelujah amen if you're sick tonight
[43:42] he's still on the throne his word is
[43:44] still in effect
[43:45] [Applause]
[43:46] there's nothing to be worried about
[43:48] god's got it
[43:51] he knows all things he's still in
[43:52] control and if you're truly born of the
[43:55] spirit of god everything can you say
[43:57] everything is working together for your
[44:00] good
[44:01] he's going to make it all come out right
[44:06] he promised he would he swore he would
[44:09] he's got to keep his word
[44:13] he's kept it now for thousands of years
[44:15] to every believer
[44:18] show me one believer in here he didn't
[44:19] keep his word to
[44:21] amen would you be any exception
[44:25] oh no we're no exception
[44:27] amen he kept abraham he'll keep you
[44:31] he kept moses he'll keep you
[44:34] he kept shamgar he'll keep you
[44:36] it doesn't matter if it's 600
[44:38] philistines he'll keep you amen he kept
[44:40] david he'll keep you he kept daniel
[44:43] he'll keep you he kept the three hebrew
[44:45] children he'll keep you he kept peter
[44:48] and paul and the martyrs down through
[44:50] the dark ages he'll keep you
[44:53] he kept paul and silas he'll keep you he
[44:56] kept william branham he'll keep you
[44:59] hallelujah you're no exception
[45:05] so we're not to be discouraged
[45:09] listen this quote
[45:10] don't be discouraged
[45:12] we're living in a terrible hour
[45:25] don't be discouraged we're living in a
[45:28] terrible hour
[45:29] but you know there's a comma behind that
[45:32] a terrible hour for the unbeliever
[45:36] but a wonderful hour for the believer
[45:39] for we're nearing the end time
[45:42] to which we're looking for the coming of
[45:44] our blessed lord
[45:48] amen it's not a terrible hour for a
[45:50] believer yes it's a terrible time we're
[45:53] living in but it's a blessed time
[45:56] it's a dangerous time but it's a
[45:57] wonderful time it's a worry sometimes
[46:01] but it's a hallelujah time because just
[46:03] any moment he's going to return
[46:07] [Music]
[46:11] but discouragement can come
[46:14] it tries to knock at your door
[46:16] through situations that comes in your
[46:18] life whether it be sicknesses or lost
[46:20] loved ones or or trials of all kinds and
[46:24] all kind of things that come you know
[46:26] every one of us tonight can name
[46:27] something no doubt different we've been
[46:29] going through
[46:30] and the devil's trying to set that and
[46:32] push that discouragement into our life
[46:35] to just give up
[46:37] why is he trying so hard to make you
[46:39] give up
[46:45] we could say we could look at that david
[46:48] we know the scriptures heard many
[46:50] messages preached from it
[46:52] but exiglag
[46:54] when the malachites invaded you know and
[46:56] burnt ziglag to the ground and took the
[46:58] women and the captives and and and and
[47:00] took them all captive captivity and here
[47:03] david and his men comes back and you
[47:05] know and behold it you know the city was
[47:07] burned with fire and their wives and
[47:08] their sons and their daughters were all
[47:10] gone
[47:12] and david and the people that were with
[47:14] him lifted up their voice and wept and
[47:16] the scripture says until they had no
[47:18] more power to weep
[47:21] that's crying a bunch of buckets of
[47:23] tears
[47:24] to where you get to the where you can't
[47:26] even weep no more
[47:28] in such anxiety and such torment and
[47:31] such hurt and such anguish and such
[47:33] discouragement that a tear can't even no
[47:36] longer come out of your eye that's
[47:37] pretty discouraged
[47:40] amen and his wives were taken and the
[47:43] scripture said david was greatly
[47:45] distressed
[47:47] and the people even his own men that had
[47:49] stood with him through many things they
[47:51] began to talk about stoning him
[47:54] it was a great defeat one of his worst
[47:56] days of his life
[48:00] every man
[48:02] began to in
[48:03] the souls of every man was grieved
[48:06] but david
[48:08] encouraged himself in the lord his god
[48:14] you know here they come down to it and
[48:16] they're burnt with fire discouraged
[48:18] that's probably not a big enough word
[48:21] to describe the state of their morale
[48:25] the bible says that you know as we said
[48:26] they will blow out bitter tears until
[48:28] they simply had no more power to weep
[48:32] for david it was even worse he was the
[48:33] leader and his men were so consumed by
[48:36] grief that they were even talking of
[48:38] stoning him and here he was in distress
[48:40] and it might have destroyed him
[48:42] completely except for this one thing he
[48:46] encouraged himself in the lord
[48:49] he began to remind himself who he really
[48:52] was
[48:55] not who he was right then but who he was
[48:58] a son of abraham
[49:01] a son of god
[49:03] a circumcised israelite
[49:06] that had a promise with god that he was
[49:09] he had a promise that god was with him
[49:17] it required though resolving david's
[49:19] heart
[49:20] as a garment he had to take something
[49:22] else and put it on
[49:24] he had a decision to make will he go
[49:26] deeper into his depression into his
[49:29] distress would he worry more and allow
[49:31] it to make him more helpless
[49:34] or would he make a conscious decision
[49:36] i'm going to turn my eyes towards the
[49:38] hills which cometh my help
[49:42] amen so david chose encouragement not to
[49:45] just be encouraged but there was no one
[49:48] around there that could encourage him
[49:51] sometimes there's no words that can be
[49:53] given
[49:55] to lift somebody up we want to do our
[49:57] best we want to try you know say i'm
[49:59] praying for you and all that's wonderful
[50:01] and all that's nice but sometimes words
[50:03] are just words
[50:10] but david encouraged himself
[50:13] notice the most important thing we're
[50:15] here to realize david didn't encourage
[50:17] himself in himself
[50:21] it wasn't nothing in himself to be
[50:22] encouraged by
[50:25] amen but whether he turned to the
[50:27] scriptures he turned to what the lord
[50:29] said he was he turned to the lord his
[50:31] god
[50:33] you see it was not just about david
[50:36] this this this zig lag and all that he
[50:38] had lost was not just about david
[50:41] david had a covenant with god
[50:44] so his covenant with god made what david
[50:46] was going through god's business
[50:51] amen and i want you to understand we are
[50:53] also a people under a covenant
[50:57] therefore the trial you're going through
[50:59] is not just about you it's also about
[51:02] god it's also god's business
[51:09] you see it was not just about david
[51:12] it was about god so it made it god's
[51:14] business so after encouraging himself
[51:15] david was able to move on from the
[51:18] problem to the solution
[51:21] you'll never get to the solution of your
[51:22] problem unless you get your focus off
[51:24] your problem and get it on your god
[51:29] what god's really doing for you
[51:31] how god's rea everything works together
[51:33] for the good
[51:36] amen discouragement does not come from
[51:38] the lord it comes from our adversary the
[51:40] devil that's why david could encourage
[51:43] himself from the lord because the lord
[51:45] was a source of his solution not the
[51:47] source of his problem
[51:50] amen anxiety worry frightening and
[51:53] discouragement it begins to it begins to
[51:55] have indicators it's indicating we're
[51:58] walking by sight and not by faith
[52:04] yeah
[52:06] brother i've used these before but this
[52:08] is very something i always go back to
[52:10] because
[52:11] it helps you with your thinking
[52:13] sometimes
[52:14] brother brandon would bring it out and
[52:15] you can go look at it you can look up
[52:17] deep thinker you can learn we'll look up
[52:19] across some bridges you can look up a
[52:21] lot of different uh
[52:23] uh different tags that you can look at
[52:26] but
[52:27] he said in discernment there's multiple
[52:29] multiple multiple i can't even tell you
[52:31] how many of them
[52:33] in discernment he would tell him you're
[52:34] an awful deep thinker
[52:37] he said you got a weary spirit you're
[52:40] always worrying about things you've got
[52:42] no business to be worrying about
[52:45] you're nervous and upset and it caused
[52:48] you to have acid in your blood which has
[52:50] given you arthritis
[52:54] the devil did it too no we did it to
[52:56] ourselves
[52:58] amen because we refuse to be encouraged
[53:00] to encourage ourself in the lord
[53:02] we can we will continue to go on down
[53:05] the road of our our problems to the road
[53:07] of the solution
[53:08] amen so
[53:10] if we the devil wants to keep you on
[53:12] that road of your problems
[53:14] because we know you could he can keep
[53:15] you about because then you're walking by
[53:17] sight and you're seeing this and you're
[53:19] seeing that and you're seeing that over
[53:21] there look at that over there wow over
[53:22] there and everything and it's all you're
[53:24] all then next thing you're out you're
[53:25] discouraged you're tore down you're
[53:27] depressed
[53:30] thinking too much
[53:33] there's another one he said it caused
[53:34] you to be a nervous person you're very
[53:36] nervous you're always taking other
[53:37] people's problems oh
[53:39] i think that's something about the devil
[53:41] he ain't even concerned about you having
[53:42] your own problems you start taking
[53:44] everybody else's problems
[53:46] and thinking about things crossing
[53:48] bridges before you get to it building
[53:50] things that never happen
[53:53] hello somebody
[53:55] how many ever had that happen before
[53:57] i've had you know you can go talk to
[53:59] somebody and say you maybe have an issue
[54:01] or something and you're you got you you
[54:03] start going through your mind all right
[54:04] i'm gonna bring this out and he's gonna
[54:05] say that and then i'm gonna say this
[54:09] he better not say that
[54:12] if he does and i'm going to say this
[54:15] and then and then you go there and you
[54:17] go talk to them they only know what
[54:18] you're talking about
[54:21] been crossing too many bridges
[54:24] going down the down the road of
[54:26] the problem instead of the road of the
[54:28] solution
[54:30] amen when it's time we start encouraging
[54:32] ourself and the lord our god
[54:34] in these times that we're living in
[54:36] don't look at the problems around us
[54:40] and all the situations around us and all
[54:43] the problems and things that's going on
[54:45] and then sicknesses and this that and
[54:47] the other
[54:48] look at the lord your god
[54:57] and he said that all that developed a
[54:59] stomach trouble
[55:00] but paul would say we walk by faith and
[55:02] not by sight
[55:06] we walk by faith we put our confidence
[55:09] in the lord and his promises but when we
[55:11] walk by sight we're trusting our senses
[55:14] we're trusting our feelings
[55:16] we're trusting what we understand
[55:20] and we easily fall prey to all the
[55:21] deceptions of the world the flesh and
[55:23] the devil when we find ourselves in
[55:25] discouragement we find where we've been
[55:27] placed in our trust
[55:30] oh man
[55:33] the answer to this is to put your trust
[55:36] back in the lord
[55:38] so when discouragement comes you find
[55:40] that you've been walking by sight
[55:42] instead of by faith head back to the
[55:44] scriptures
[55:45] let the promises of god build your faith
[55:48] back god wants you to be encouraged
[55:51] so if he wants you to take courage he
[55:52] has to give you the means to be
[55:54] encouraged by
[55:57] so re first of all you got to recognize
[55:59] i don't have to stay here
[56:03] you don't have to stay where you're at
[56:10] mourning is just for a moment
[56:13] amen we don't have to stay there we
[56:16] don't have to stay in that moment we
[56:18] don't have to stand that discouragement
[56:20] amen we've got to look to the lord our
[56:22] god
[56:28] you can be encouraged in fact you can
[56:31] encourage yourself
[56:34] well i just need somebody to tell me
[56:35] something good no what you need to do is
[56:37] start looking at the scriptures
[56:39] and putting yourself there
[56:42] and saying that's my name in the book
[56:44] that's me right there
[56:46] that's who i am right there
[56:48] that's not the devil's thoughts that's
[56:50] not who i am
[56:51] the things he's putting in my mind
[56:53] that's not who i am
[56:55] you know somehow although we get this
[56:57] idea that when we get the holy ghost
[56:58] we're not going to ever have any more
[56:59] bad thoughts we're not going to have any
[57:01] more depressed thoughts we're not going
[57:02] to happen and you know people get that
[57:04] in their mind and when they start having
[57:05] them they got the holy ghost
[57:09] no what it is it comes it can't help it
[57:11] it's like a bird flying over
[57:14] it's going to come it's going to happen
[57:15] it's going to come i mean look look out
[57:17] there on our building amen the birds
[57:20] going to fly around they're looking for
[57:21] a place to nest
[57:25] but what keeps them from nesting
[57:28] blow them out of the sky
[57:31] whatever it takes
[57:33] don't dwell on it
[57:36] move on past it
[57:38] don't dwell in your pity
[57:41] don't dwell in your circumstances don't
[57:44] don't don't let it build a man
[57:46] a mess on the side of your house and be
[57:48] all muddied up and thing and manure
[57:50] coming down the side walls cause all the
[57:52] stuff you've been dwelling on get past
[57:54] all of that turn your eyes back on jesus
[58:01] look to the hills which cometh your help
[58:11] and remember in the middle of all of it
[58:13] the lord jesus christ
[58:16] has committed himself
[58:18] to take care of you
[58:21] in every situation
[58:24] that's enough right there to just go on
[58:25] a shout and fish
[58:30] i i i got to remind you all this it i i
[58:33] when i think about it
[58:34] you know i seen this uh deal one time
[58:36] with this little cartoon
[58:39] of this dorky looking sheep
[58:42] walking on his hind legs cartoon walking
[58:44] on his hind legs and he was holding the
[58:46] with his little clove and hooves holding
[58:48] the hands of jesus and over in the ditch
[58:51] was this whole line roaring at him
[58:53] that old sheep just as dorky looking as
[58:55] he can be and helpless looking as he can
[58:57] be was looking at that line and he says
[58:59] i'm with him
[59:05] that's what you need to remind the devil
[59:08] you're not by yourself
[59:10] i didn't come this far by myself i
[59:12] didn't get here by myself he called me
[59:15] here he placed me here this is his doing
[59:18] this is the lord's doing and it's
[59:20] marvelous in our eyes
[59:23] i'm with him
[59:24] [Applause]
[59:30] when the circumstances of life pressed
[59:32] and on david david pressed into his
[59:35] benefits
[59:37] amen he hadn't we grabbed him a new song
[59:39] to sing
[59:40] so the song would discourage me and
[59:42] started singing the song of
[59:43] encouragement
[59:45] amen he was singing maybe in psalms 103
[59:48] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[59:51] all his benefits who forgive all your
[59:53] iniquities who healed all your diseases
[59:56] who redeemed your oh that's a good song
[59:58] to sing who redeems your life from
[1:00:00] destruction who crowns you with loving
[1:00:03] kindness and tender mercy who satisfies
[1:00:06] your mouth with good things so that your
[1:00:09] youth is renewed like the eagles
[1:00:14] so you got to stop giving voice to your
[1:00:16] discouragement and start giving voice to
[1:00:18] your encouragement
[1:00:21] amen stop giving voice to the sorrows
[1:00:23] and and the things that are going on and
[1:00:25] start speaking the word of god
[1:00:30] stop repeating the lies of the devil and
[1:00:32] start speaking the promises of god
[1:00:35] stop speaking out of fear and start
[1:00:37] speaking out of faith
[1:00:39] stop talking about the problems and
[1:00:41] start talking about the solution find
[1:00:43] out what the word of god has to say
[1:00:45] about your situation
[1:00:47] and he has the answer for every
[1:00:49] situation
[1:00:51] start speaking it
[1:00:53] the word of god
[1:00:55] rather than your feelings
[1:00:58] amen
[1:00:59] meditate on the lord
[1:01:02] realize it's not about you it's about
[1:01:04] him amen
[1:01:07] well i'm just so this and i'm just so
[1:01:09] that you got it all about you
[1:01:14] this is what even suicide comes from you
[1:01:17] know what you don't a normal person
[1:01:19] don't just walk out there without you
[1:01:20] know without a thought and just shoot
[1:01:22] itself on purpose
[1:01:25] but it's been months and years of
[1:01:27] thoughts
[1:01:28] things is going through the mind
[1:01:30] adding upon he's been dwelling and it
[1:01:33] turns them inward
[1:01:34] that's right it was all about me
[1:01:37] and selfishness takes over
[1:01:40] suicide spirit is nothing but a selfish
[1:01:43] spirit
[1:01:44] all is about me and my issues and my
[1:01:46] problems and what i got going on and
[1:01:48] failing to realize when you take your
[1:01:49] life how many other lives you're
[1:01:51] destroying
[1:01:57] but
[1:01:58] what happens they begin to meditate too
[1:02:00] much on themselves
[1:02:05] you know it gets really discouraging
[1:02:07] when you hear people all the time that's
[1:02:08] all they want to talk about is how bad
[1:02:10] they got it
[1:02:12] and how bad they feel and how bad it is
[1:02:14] and how bad my work's just terrible this
[1:02:17] is happening it got around about the
[1:02:18] blood
[1:02:22] sounds like a broken record
[1:02:25] same thing over and over
[1:02:28] time to get a different tune
[1:02:31] time to sing a different song
[1:02:34] amen
[1:02:35] it ain't all about you
[1:02:39] listen singing the songs of the lamb is
[1:02:41] not about you
[1:02:43] anybody who you are and what you've done
[1:02:45] or hadn't done or how bad it is for you
[1:02:47] when you sing the songs of the lamb
[1:02:49] you're singing about him
[1:02:50] and what he's done for you what he's
[1:02:53] doing for you and how he's made a way
[1:02:55] where there seemed to be no way how he
[1:02:57] can open up the red sea how you can put
[1:02:59] out the fire
[1:03:02] start singing those songs
[1:03:10] but the devil wants to put something on
[1:03:12] you
[1:03:14] that's not you he wants to place a name
[1:03:17] on you to cause you to sing his tomb
[1:03:20] this is what he did nebuchadnezzar tried
[1:03:22] to do to the daniel and the three hebrew
[1:03:24] children
[1:03:26] hananiah and michelle and
[1:03:28] azariah he gave them names that most of
[1:03:31] us even call them by their other name
[1:03:32] shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:03:35] but that wasn't their names
[1:03:38] see
[1:03:39] these four boys had hebrew names
[1:03:42] and their names had a connection amen
[1:03:44] was a connection to the faith in god but
[1:03:47] iran would talk about some hebrew
[1:03:49] mothers would give birth amen they would
[1:03:51] even call out their names and as they
[1:03:53] called out simeon and and benjamin and
[1:03:56] all the different ones it actually
[1:03:57] placed them in the promised land
[1:04:00] in their inheritance
[1:04:02] it had a meaning that's why when you
[1:04:04] have a child you need to really look at
[1:04:06] what you name them
[1:04:09] names have meanings
[1:04:11] there's things that follow names
[1:04:13] so about the shazaar is trying to change
[1:04:15] it and cut off their connection with god
[1:04:19] [Music]
[1:04:21] this is what it was shadowy try to
[1:04:23] michelle meshach
[1:04:25] from hananiah to shadrach and azerite to
[1:04:28] abednego
[1:04:31] to change the names as a way of
[1:04:32] encouraging them to forget their god
[1:04:36] and forget their homeland and begin to
[1:04:39] conform to the ways and the gods of
[1:04:41] babylon
[1:04:42] it was actually a forced assimilation
[1:04:46] nebuchadnezzar wanted daniel and his
[1:04:48] friends to conform to the pattern of
[1:04:51] this world they're living in
[1:04:53] and the name change was to step and
[1:04:55] towards that each name daniel and his
[1:04:57] friends were given carried a different
[1:04:59] meaning and it actually was associated
[1:05:01] with a babylonian deity
[1:05:04] abednego means servant of nebo
[1:05:07] belter shazar which is was given to
[1:05:10] daniel means baal protects his life
[1:05:13] when his other meaning was god is my
[1:05:15] judge
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:19] michelle's which is ill in in the
[1:05:22] hananiah
[1:05:24] and azariah has the yah in it which is
[1:05:26] from short for yahweh
[1:05:28] is the covenant name of god so there was
[1:05:31] one he's wanting to take who their real
[1:05:33] identity was and put a different name on
[1:05:36] them
[1:05:38] a different song on them to where they
[1:05:40] began to sing the songs of baal and they
[1:05:42] began to sing the song of the gods of
[1:05:44] that lamb and they wanted to place that
[1:05:46] name upon them so they would begin to
[1:05:49] feel comfortable in this land and what
[1:05:51] you're and listen that's exactly what
[1:05:53] the devils want to put on you
[1:05:55] god's called you by name he's called you
[1:05:58] bride he's called you redead he's called
[1:06:00] you his son he's called you his daughter
[1:06:02] but the devil wants to put other names
[1:06:04] on you he wants to put depression and
[1:06:06] anxiety and fear and every kind of
[1:06:09] spirit of hell on you but i am not
[1:06:12] serving those gods i'm serving the one
[1:06:15] true living god
[1:06:19] hallelujah therefore my name is redeemed
[1:06:23] my name is son of god my name is the
[1:06:26] daughter of god that's who i am
[1:06:35] the devil wants to place a name on you
[1:06:36] so you can sing his song
[1:06:39] he wants to place the name of bitterness
[1:06:41] on you
[1:06:42] so you'll sing the tune of bitterness
[1:06:45] and your whole life will be bitter
[1:06:48] and out of it a song will come forth out
[1:06:50] of your life until where you're nothing
[1:06:52] but bitter and you can't even gather
[1:06:54] together with family because of
[1:06:55] bitterness
[1:07:01] you can call it what do you want to
[1:07:03] you've taken the name of another land
[1:07:08] it ain't the land you want to go to
[1:07:09] either
[1:07:12] depression to come on you
[1:07:15] you begin to give praise to it
[1:07:17] forced assimilation
[1:07:20] it'll conform you to try to conform you
[1:07:22] to his thinking
[1:07:23] his song his desires
[1:07:27] but god
[1:07:28] as we said also changes our name
[1:07:34] hallelujah
[1:07:35] amen as we read there in psalms 40 david
[1:07:38] david said i was in a horrible pit
[1:07:41] bring that back up psalms 40 and verse
[1:07:43] 1. i was in a horrible pit
[1:07:46] out of the mind he brought me up though
[1:07:48] he didn't leave me where he found me
[1:07:50] i was singing the songs of america
[1:07:53] i was singing the songs of unworthiness
[1:07:55] and bound and slavery i was in a
[1:07:58] horrible pit i was caught
[1:08:01] but god rich in mercy we heard about a
[1:08:03] sunday but god came along our path
[1:08:06] and he snatched us up out of that pit
[1:08:08] and he said i got a name for you i got a
[1:08:11] new song i want to put in your mouth
[1:08:13] it's not the song of a maori clip here
[1:08:16] it's not the song of a maori clay it's
[1:08:18] not a horrible pit that's not who you
[1:08:20] are that's not where you come from but
[1:08:24] let me give you the soul of the redeemed
[1:08:28] a song that angels can't even say
[1:08:44] you know in the u.s
[1:08:46] we have this saying
[1:08:49] he says i bet he's singing a different
[1:08:51] tune now
[1:08:53] the context is that someone has had a
[1:08:56] radical event
[1:08:57] happen in his life
[1:08:59] and because of this he acts different
[1:09:03] because of this life-altering event he
[1:09:06] can no longer sing the same song because
[1:09:08] it don't apply
[1:09:13] perhaps this new song is a way of saying
[1:09:15] i have a life changing i've had a
[1:09:17] life-changing experience with the
[1:09:19] creator of the entire universe so
[1:09:22] therefore i cannot and i will not remain
[1:09:25] the same
[1:09:26] i will sing a new song because my
[1:09:29] desires have changed
[1:09:32] oh hallelujah it was many of you used to
[1:09:35] sing the song of druckiness and alcohol
[1:09:38] and tobacco and drugs you used to have a
[1:09:40] song coming out of your mouth and your
[1:09:42] life put it out
[1:09:45] hey you can see profile pictures and
[1:09:46] things of people that's getting caught
[1:09:48] with drugs and it don't take very much
[1:09:49] to know that person's been on meth
[1:09:52] that's what there's a song coming out of
[1:09:54] their mouth
[1:09:56] they may not even be actually singing
[1:09:57] nothing but you can see it coming out of
[1:09:59] their life
[1:10:03] hey listen don't think you backslidden
[1:10:05] people out here don't don't have a song
[1:10:07] coming out you can see it very quickly
[1:10:12] you can see it when you're not seeing
[1:10:13] what you're used to seeing you're not
[1:10:15] doing what you used to do
[1:10:20] but reverse
[1:10:22] when somebody has that radical event
[1:10:24] change in their life
[1:10:28] where our watch was in a horrible pit
[1:10:30] and i was going the wrong direction but
[1:10:32] i had a radical event changed
[1:10:34] and he turned me around and he put my
[1:10:37] path on a solid rock
[1:10:40] it gave me a new song to say it gave me
[1:10:43] something else coming out from the end
[1:10:45] where like a fire shut up in my bones
[1:10:53] we've seen how god would take abram and
[1:10:56] make him abraham
[1:10:58] it was an event change in his life
[1:11:01] he was just old shepherd boy out there
[1:11:03] in the
[1:11:04] plains of mamrie
[1:11:07] god called him
[1:11:08] his wife sarah
[1:11:10] and he takes him out
[1:11:12] we know he put the h in his name
[1:11:15] which is a part of him
[1:11:18] the breath of god being placed in
[1:11:20] abraham and sarah
[1:11:22] it was a radical event change that took
[1:11:24] place
[1:11:26] was it not
[1:11:28] a 90 year old and a 100 year old man and
[1:11:30] woman had a baby that's pretty radical
[1:11:32] if you ask me
[1:11:35] it was a radical event change that took
[1:11:37] place and abraham began to sing a
[1:11:39] different song
[1:11:41] sarah began to sing a different song she
[1:11:43] was singing the song of i am barren i am
[1:11:46] not nothing i'll never be anything i'm
[1:11:48] there
[1:11:50] to god change me
[1:11:52] i'm not the same person i used to be

[1:12:01] i'm a princess with god
[1:12:04] amen
[1:12:07] jacob

[1:12:12] his name is a planner a deceiver and
[1:12:15] that's what he did
[1:12:17] he deceived

[1:12:22] people with some name changes
[1:12:25] deceivers
[1:12:26] always got to get the best side of
[1:12:28] things

[1:12:45] wrestle him out and he realized this is
[1:12:47] somebody different i ever had a hold of
[1:12:49] my life

[1:13:02] hollow of his tie and from that moment
[1:13:04] he walked different he acted different
[1:13:06] he talked different he wasn't the same
[1:13:08] man no more and he changed his name
[1:13:12] amen it was a it was about from a from
[1:13:14] us a planner to a prince with power with
[1:13:17] god

[1:13:32] no longer going to call you simeon i'm
[1:13:33] going to call you peter
[1:13:36] little rock little stone
[1:13:40] saul had a radical event change in his
[1:13:43] life to where he meet a pillar of fire
[1:13:45] under where it changed him from no
[1:13:46] longer being who he was a murderer
[1:13:50] tormenting god's children to standing
[1:13:52] for the truth
[1:13:54] paul an apostle of jesus christ
[1:13:58] abraham just an ordinary man
[1:14:01] but one day he met god
[1:14:04] and from that time he was changed
[1:14:06] forever
[1:14:08] saying a different song
[1:14:10] he believed something he couldn't see
[1:14:13] when he met god he was changed moses a
[1:14:16] runaway servant supposed to deliver the
[1:14:17] children of israel running away he
[1:14:19] didn't know he didn't know how to do his
[1:14:20] military
[1:14:21] training wasn't doing them no good but
[1:14:23] one day he met god and he sang a
[1:14:25] different song
[1:14:28] when he was one day hiding behind bushes
[1:14:30] worried about that there's somebody
[1:14:32] coming to take his life surely egyptians
[1:14:34] are still coming after me 40 years later
[1:14:36] still hiding out
[1:14:39] one day he met the pillar of fire in a
[1:14:40] burning bush
[1:14:43] from that time his song began to change
[1:14:45] is such a thing he took his wife put her
[1:14:47] on a mule young it on her hip whiskers
[1:14:49] hanging down low 80 years old and a bald
[1:14:52] head shining a stick in his hand said
[1:14:54] glory hallelujah where are you going
[1:14:56] moses
[1:14:57] i'm going down to egypt to take over
[1:14:59] that's a different song
[1:15:02] amen he met god where was it running he
[1:15:04] was going back to take over because he
[1:15:07] had met god he'd been at that burning
[1:15:09] bush and moses was a different man peter
[1:15:12] when he met god jesus revealed to him
[1:15:14] who he was amen paul when he met god
[1:15:17] amen he was going down to arrest people
[1:15:19] for shouting and speaking in tongues
[1:15:22] oh he was going to put him in jail he
[1:15:24] had an order from the high church to do
[1:15:26] it but he met god and from that time he
[1:15:28] sung a different song
[1:15:31] he was a different man when he met god
[1:15:33] one time a dirty stinking leper laid a
[1:15:35] gate and said if thou will i'm unclean
[1:15:37] unclean unclean unclean
[1:15:42] but if that will
[1:15:44] make me clean
[1:15:46] jesus said i will
[1:15:50] do you realize what your leprosy's doing
[1:15:52] to you
[1:15:53] you may not have nothing coming out of
[1:15:55] your lips but your life is screaming
[1:15:57] singing unclean
[1:16:00] unclean
[1:16:02] unclean
[1:16:03] unclean
[1:16:05] but if you can ever get before him
[1:16:07] be modest with god
[1:16:09] lord of thy will
[1:16:11] make me clean
[1:16:12] he'll change you too
[1:16:15] he'll change in such a way the church
[1:16:17] ain't no drudgery to you no more you're
[1:16:20] happy
[1:16:22] you're ready to come to church
[1:16:23] ready to be with in the house of god
[1:16:25] praising god
[1:16:26] days ain't no drudgery no more
[1:16:30] the birds are singing different the
[1:16:32] flowers are looking different
[1:16:38] how many remembers when you had that
[1:16:41] life-changing experience
[1:16:45] things were different
[1:16:49] and a moral woman met god one time in a
[1:16:51] well
[1:16:52] five husbands living with the six
[1:16:55] he told her the secrets of her heart
[1:16:58] from that time she sang a different song
[1:17:02] she could come see a man who told me all
[1:17:04] i've done this has to be the messiah
[1:17:06] when you meet god it changes things
[1:17:09] from that time it changes things it
[1:17:11] certainly does it does it for all people
[1:17:13] there was a blind man one time but when
[1:17:15] he met jesus it changed everything
[1:17:21] even death can't remain the same
[1:17:24] it changed the tune of death
[1:17:28] when it met god
[1:17:40] when you begin to realize
[1:17:43] it's not what i've done
[1:17:45] it's what he's done
[1:17:48] this is what david had to do he said
[1:17:49] it's not who i am it's who he is
[1:17:53] he's still the same god that gave me
[1:17:54] victory over the goliath
[1:17:57] he's still the same god that gave me all
[1:17:58] these other victories god ain't changed
[1:18:09] revelations 1 6 says he hath made us
[1:18:11] kings and priests
[1:18:13] unto god and his father to him be glory
[1:18:16] and dominion forever and ever he hath
[1:18:18] made us
[1:18:21] he said there's a truth we need to
[1:18:22] emphasize he hath made us you need to
[1:18:26] tell the devil that tonight god made me
[1:18:32] i didn't make me
[1:18:34] god made me
[1:18:35] i didn't ask to be here god put me here
[1:18:41] he hath made me
[1:18:43] salvation of the lord is grace he
[1:18:45] redeemed us for purpose he brought us
[1:18:47] for a purpose we are king spiritual
[1:18:50] kings we're going to be kings upon the
[1:18:51] earth with him when he sits on the
[1:18:52] throne but now we're spiritual kings and
[1:18:55] we reign over a spiritual kingdom
[1:18:59] he has made us priests
[1:19:01] priests in them offering a spiritual
[1:19:03] praise of sanctified lips
[1:19:06] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[1:19:08] unto him worshiping him in spirit and
[1:19:10] truth interceding and petitioning
[1:19:12] priests and kings in our god no wonder
[1:19:15] the world don't appeal to us no more
[1:19:18] because we are peculiar people we don't
[1:19:21] sing the same song
[1:19:25] we're not in tune with what they're
[1:19:27] doing
[1:19:29] shouldn't be
[1:19:31] we shouldn't be in tune with their
[1:19:32] styles
[1:19:35] we shouldn't be in tune with nothing
[1:19:36] sodom has
[1:19:44] if you're in tune with what sodom has it
[1:19:46] tells you who you are
[1:19:50] because abraham was in the ten at the
[1:19:52] tent with the son of man
[1:19:55] speaking to
[1:19:57] god himself and becoming taking on flesh
[1:20:00] revealing the secrets of the heart
[1:20:03] abraham wasn't thinking about sodom and
[1:20:04] gomorrah and what it's as lavishes and
[1:20:07] what it's doing and what all that it
[1:20:08] could he could care less
[1:20:10] but lot on the other hand was singing a
[1:20:13] different tune
[1:20:15] different song
[1:20:20] he said no wonder the world don't appeal
[1:20:21] to us
[1:20:22] we're a peculiar people
[1:20:27] different
[1:20:29] different
[1:20:34] you know as we would look at the
[1:20:36] scriptures as
[1:20:37] as as moses and then would come out of
[1:20:39] the out of the out of egypt and they'd
[1:20:41] go and we know the story of how they
[1:20:43] come to the red sea and how how all that
[1:20:45] taken place
[1:20:47] don't have all the time to get into it
[1:20:49] but as they come to that
[1:20:51] they were singing a song there was a
[1:20:52] song of fear they were singing
[1:20:55] there wasn't any graves out there to we
[1:20:58] could die in egypt
[1:21:02] why did you bring us out here in the
[1:21:04] wilderness to die
[1:21:08] songs were coming out of their mouth
[1:21:11] things were taking place
[1:21:13] and the lord says
[1:21:15] what you need to do is hold your peace
[1:21:18] because i'm going to fight for you
[1:21:20] and i'm going to change your tune
[1:21:24] i'm going to put a new song in your
[1:21:25] mouth
[1:21:26] from this experience right now you're
[1:21:28] going to walk away from this with a new
[1:21:30] song
[1:21:33] hallelujah and we know how they went
[1:21:35] through there and they come on the other
[1:21:37] side and moses would stretch it out his
[1:21:39] hand on the other side and the waters
[1:21:41] return
[1:21:42] and then they looked out there and there
[1:21:43] was all dead egyptians floating on the
[1:21:46] seashore amen and they looked around it
[1:21:48] was all gone in the next scripture
[1:21:51] exodus chapter 15 then saying moses and
[1:21:54] the children of israel this song went to
[1:21:56] the lord
[1:21:58] i was singing the lord for he has
[1:22:00] triumphed gloriously
[1:22:02] the horse and his rider hath he thrown
[1:22:05] into the sea the lord is my strength
[1:22:08] well that's a lot different song than
[1:22:10] what they were singing just a few
[1:22:11] moments ago on the other side of the
[1:22:13] trial
[1:22:15] if you'll just be patient with god god's
[1:22:17] going to give you a new song
[1:22:19] if you'll just be patient god will give
[1:22:21] you something that'll come out of you
[1:22:24] from the time that you're living in
[1:22:25] right now
[1:22:27] the trial that you're going through is
[1:22:29] about to produce the sweetest song of
[1:22:32] savior that's ever come to his
[1:22:36] to the eyes and the ears of our lord
[1:22:41] hallelujah the lord is my strength and
[1:22:44] my soul and he is my salvation
[1:22:48] he is my god and i'll prepare him in
[1:22:50] habitation my father's god and i'll
[1:22:53] exalt him the lord is a man of war and
[1:22:56] the lord is his name pharaoh rose
[1:22:58] chariots oh hallelujah
[1:23:01] you see what kind of song that god puts
[1:23:03] in your mouth you start singing your own
[1:23:06] song you're singing about how great your
[1:23:08] enemy is i wonder how how powerful he is
[1:23:11] how impossible it is overcome but when
[1:23:13] god puts a song in your mouth he'll tell
[1:23:15] you how defeated he is how harmless he
[1:23:19] is he can't overcome you you're going to
[1:23:21] overcome it because i am the lord and
[1:23:24] i'm going to fight for you
[1:23:26] hold your peace and i'm going to put a
[1:23:28] song in your mouth
[1:23:31] i'm going to put a victory in your heart
[1:23:34] i'm going to put something inside of you
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:41] oh the lord is a man of war
[1:23:44] and the lord is his
[1:23:46] name and cancer and sugar diabetes as he
[1:23:51] throwed into the city
[1:23:54] amen and lust and pornography as he
[1:23:57] throwed into the sea
[1:23:59] and drunkenness and drugs and tobacco
[1:24:02] has it put under our feet
[1:24:07] and his chosen captains
[1:24:10] satan's chosen men
[1:24:12] are drowned
[1:24:14] as chief of the tribe of them demons is
[1:24:17] defeated
[1:24:20] and depths have covered them and they
[1:24:22] sank into the bottom as stone
[1:24:25] thy right hand o lord has become
[1:24:28] glorious in power that right hand oh
[1:24:31] lord has dashed to pieces the enemy
[1:24:33] [Applause]
[1:24:36] hallelujah do you see what the vision of
[1:24:38] the song of the lord will give you it'll
[1:24:40] see your enemy for who he really is
[1:24:44] he's nothing but a blood but the right
[1:24:46] hand o lord and calvary broke his back
[1:24:49] bone but the right hand of the lord
[1:24:51] broke every sickness broke every sin
[1:24:54] broke every doubt broke every
[1:24:56] fear and that's the peace is the enemy
[1:25:00] and the greatness of that excellent high
[1:25:02] excellency has overthrown them that rose
[1:25:05] up against sea thou sentence forth thy
[1:25:07] wrath which consumed them in stubble and
[1:25:09] with the blast of thy nostrils the
[1:25:11] waters were gathered together the flood
[1:25:13] stood upright as a heap and the depth
[1:25:14] were congealed in the heart of the sea
[1:25:16] and the enemy said
[1:25:18] i will pursue and i will overtake and i
[1:25:20] will divide the spool and my lust shall
[1:25:22] be satisfied upon them and i'll draw my
[1:25:24] sword and my hand shall destroy them but
[1:25:26] thou didst blow with thy wind and the
[1:25:29] sea covered them and they sank as lead
[1:25:32] in the mighty waters
[1:25:40] oh let's sing a new song who is like
[1:25:43] unto thee oh lord
[1:25:45] among the gods who is like unto the

[1:26:03] day of miracles

[1:26:07] because he's not a day of miracles he's
[1:26:09] a god of miracles
[1:26:11] and if he's a god of miracles every day
[1:26:13] is a day of miracles

[1:26:19] hand and the earth swallowed them up
[1:26:22] thou and thy mercy has led forth the
[1:26:24] people which thou hast redeemed
[1:26:27] thou has guided them in thy strength
[1:26:29] unto the holy habitation the people
[1:26:31] shall hear and be afraid the sorrows
[1:26:33] shall take hold on the inhabitants of

[1:26:51] wilderness yep we heard that verse too
[1:26:54] and we've heard how he killed you we
[1:26:56] heard how he delivered you we heard how
[1:26:58] he's going to do all these things
[1:27:01] fear and dread shall fall upon them
[1:27:04] by the greatness of that arm they shall

[1:28:45] who's going to stand against you
[1:28:48] god is determined to bring you in
[1:28:56] he's just a determined more or more to
[1:28:58] bring you in than was to bring you out
[1:29:01] bringing you out is only one part of the
[1:29:03] story but he's the author and the
[1:29:04] finisher
[1:29:05] [Applause]
[1:29:07] so he the start of the work is going to
[1:29:08] finish the work he who brought you out
[1:29:11] of here who brought you out of the
[1:29:13] nominational system he who brought you

[1:29:39] well let's sing that song a little while
[1:29:46] and you're going to plant them in the
[1:29:48] mountain of the inheritance
[1:29:50] in the place oh lord which thou has made
[1:29:51] for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary oh
[1:29:54] lord which our hands have established
[1:29:57] the lord shall reign forever and ever
[1:30:02] the horse of pharaoh went in with his
[1:30:04] chariots and his horsemen into the sea
[1:30:07] and i never did see them come out
[1:30:11] and the lord brought again the waters of
[1:30:13] the sea upon them but the children of
[1:30:15] israel every one of them went across on
[1:30:17] dry land in the midst of the sea
[1:30:20] man that song got so powerful miriam
[1:30:23] couldn't handle it no more she grabbed
[1:30:25] your tambourine and said give me some

[1:30:39] she no longer was singing i'm bound i'm
[1:30:41] defeated i'm down i'm not gonna make it
[1:30:45] i'm discouraged but she encouraged
[1:30:47] herself from the lord her god because

[1:31:03] last years
[1:31:07] it's enough to grab something and shout
[1:31:09] about it
[1:31:11] because if god did it he's doing it
[1:31:15] if god healed cancer he's still healing
[1:31:18] cancer if god brought back a particle
[1:31:21] he's still bringing back a particle
[1:31:26] oh let's sing that song they're coming
[1:31:29] home yes they're coming home

[1:31:34] it
[1:31:36] he can put sin that deep on them he can
[1:31:38] try to cover him up with every kind of
[1:31:40] spirit of hell but when that seed is
[1:31:42] called to life you can light every devil
[1:31:44] up and they're going to come with
[1:31:45] everything they got

[1:32:04] down that high down that old beach he
[1:32:06] said if that ain't an old-fashioned holy
[1:32:07] ghost meeting i ain't never saw one the
[1:32:10] daughters of israel followed her doing
[1:32:11] the same thing they had overcome and a
[1:32:14] man never knows what it is to live a
[1:32:16] victorious life until he's completely
[1:32:18] overcome that's the biggest enemy you
[1:32:20] got is yourself
[1:32:22] so we're not here to encourage ourselves
[1:32:24] in ourselves

[1:33:15] sing
[1:33:17] in revelations 5.
[1:33:21] let's just read it my goodness it's too
[1:33:22] good to just skip through that
[1:33:24] revelations five and verse one and i saw
[1:33:26] in the right hand of him on the throne a
[1:33:28] book written within
[1:33:30] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:33:31] seals and i saw a strong angel
[1:33:35] proclaiming with a loud voice who was
[1:33:37] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:33:39] seals thereof and no man in heaven no
[1:33:41] earth neither under the earth was able
[1:33:43] to open the book neither to look their
[1:33:44] own and i welt much because no man was
[1:33:47] found worthy listen to a song
[1:33:50] well much because there's no man worthy
[1:33:52] to open and read the book neither look
[1:33:54] their own but one of the elders said to
[1:33:56] me
[1:33:57] let's change the tune in this place
[1:34:00] we've not
[1:34:01] for behold the lion of the tribe of
[1:34:04] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[1:34:08] to open the book and the loose the seven
[1:34:10] seals thereof and i'll be held and lo in
[1:34:13] the midst of the throne of the four
[1:34:14] beasts in the midst of the elders stood
[1:34:16] a lamb who had been slain having seven
[1:34:19] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:34:21] spirits of god sent forth unto all the
[1:34:23] earth and he came and took the book out
[1:34:25] of the right hand of him and set up on
[1:34:27] the throne and when he had taken the
[1:34:28] book the four beasts and four and twenty
[1:34:30] elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:34:33] every one of them harps and golden vials
[1:34:35] full of odors which were the prayers of
[1:34:37] the saints and they sung
[1:34:40] a new song
[1:34:42] saying thou
[1:34:43] art worthy
[1:34:45] thou art worthy to take the book and
[1:34:48] open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:34:50] slain and has redeemed us unto god by
[1:34:52] their blood out of every kindred and
[1:34:55] tongue and people and nation
[1:34:58] and has made us into our god kings and
[1:35:01] priests and we shall reign upon the
[1:35:02] earth and i beheld and heard the voice
[1:35:05] of many angels round about the throne
[1:35:07] and the beasts and the elders and number
[1:35:09] them ten thousand times ten thousand
[1:35:11] thousands of
[1:35:12] thousands

[1:35:17] lamb that was slaying to receive power
[1:35:20] and riches and wisdom and strength and
[1:35:23] honor and glory and blessing

[1:35:32] how many we got in here 150 maybe
[1:35:36] let's say amen amen
[1:35:42] thousand times ten thousands and
[1:35:44] thousands of thousands

[1:35:52] it was a change of two
[1:35:55] we found somebody where are they
[1:35:58] we found somebody that can take that sin
[1:36:01] we found somebody that can defeat that
[1:36:04] disease we found somebody
[1:36:07] that can save the lord's sinner and the
[1:36:09] most wretched person and reach down and
[1:36:12] take them out of the moderate cliff here
[1:36:14] and put them on a rock

[1:36:21] and every creature which is in heaven
[1:36:23] and on earth and unto the earth and such

[1:36:50] him that sit on the throne unto the lamb
[1:36:53] forever and the fourth beast said amen
[1:36:56] and the four and twenty-four elders fell
[1:36:58] down and worshiped the lamb and liveth
[1:37:00] forever and ever
[1:37:02] quit singing the song of
[1:37:04] unworthiness
