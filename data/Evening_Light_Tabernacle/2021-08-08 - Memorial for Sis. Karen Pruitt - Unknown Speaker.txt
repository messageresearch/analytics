in control what has satan told you this morning it doesn't matter god's in control i worship not the storm i worship the one in the storm with me satan says he's not there he's always been there i want to just say this morning this is not my song it's your song and has requested that we sing this and so i ask that each and every one of you would testify this morning that no matter what goes on god is there with us amen so just sing it with us this [Music] morning but i was sure by now god you would have reached down and wiped our tears away stepped in and saved the day but once again i say amen and it's still raining but as a thunder rolls i'll barely hear you whisper through the rain i'm with you and add your merciful halls i will raise my hands and praise the god who gives and takes away well i will praise you in this storm and i will lift my hands where you are who you are no matter where i am and every tear i cry lord you hold in your hand you've never left my side though my heart was torn well i will praise you in this song i remember when i stumbled in the moment you heard my cry and you you raised me up again my strength was almost gone oh how could i carry on if i can't find you and as the thunder rolls i barely hear you whisper through the rain i'm with you [Music] and as a merciful i'm gonna raise my hands and praise the gods you are who you are [Music] in this storm i lift my eyes to the hills where does my hell come from my help comes from the lord the maker of heaven lift your voice now i lift my eyes into the hills where does my help come from my health comes from the lord the maker of heaven and earth [Music] oh i will [Music] praise [Music] is [Music] hallelujah can you do that this morning so many times i've questioned certain circumstances of things i could not understand and many times in trials weakness blurs my vision and my frustration gets so out of hand [Music] oh it's then i am reminded that i've never been forsaken i've never had to stand on one test and as i look at all the victories the spirit rises up in me and it's through the fire my weakness is made strong [Music] it would not be hard to climb [Music] he never offered your victories without fighting but he said help would always come in time just remember when you're standing in the boundary of decision and the adversary says give it [Music] and he will take you through the fire well again know within myself that i was surely paris but if i trust the hand of god that the cross would not get heavy heavy here would not be hard to [Music] he said help would always come inside just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says and he will take you through the power again so churches [Music] and he will take you through the fire [Applause] again oh can you see this when you finally make your entrance to that city of jasper walls and bright golden and [Music] that's where she's at as you behold all it's beauty and it's splendors there's just one request sister karen we'd all like to make from you look for me for i will be there too you want to make that promise to me i really there'll be so much to view after you've been [Music] as you go down your list of firms there's no question you'll want to see your many loved ones that are waiting there for you but when you feel you've shared your story with the last one who wants to hear you tell just how you've made it through sister karen look for me [Music] oh for i wanna hear it too i realize when you ride there'll be so much to view after you've been there ten thousand years [Music] for me [Music] look for me for i will be there too i want to speak to you for a few minutes today on karen pruitt a virtuous woman proverbs 31 10 says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the question who can find is not that such women are non-existent but they are to be greatly admired because they're worth their value not only to god but to their family to their church family are of such great price they are very rare now among this group of believers today i don't think they would be as rare as they would be in walmart or someplace like that because one of your sisters get there and you see all the eyes that are on you they know that you are rare and unusual and today we have a gathering of very many of those rarities but when solomon wrote this this book of proverbs and it calls his name solomon had several names but in this chapter 31 he was identified as lemuel and there was only one woman in the bible that was actually attributed with this great attribute of being virtuous and that was the woman called ruth sarah's great issue was mary mary magdalene different ones but again ruth was identified as being a virtuous woman the word virtue is one that is strong and has something that emanates from her being now that's not the same thing of course as being a dominating female but it is something that comes from an inward something and solomon i remember this man had a thousand wives so it's not like that he wasn't a professional dealing with women to my life i i can't understand why one man would want that many wives anyway that's a sermon for another day but solomon knew many of those marriages were made on political agendas to make his kingdom strong but there was still a search for a virtuous one we know that solomon did find one he found her in the north country and he was up there surveying the northern part of his kingdom and he saw her out as she was a shepherdist of course and she was what we call a shulamite or the hebrew word is shula smith shulamite is the feminist form of solomon and he found one that one day so smoked his heart she was the very epitome here of proverbs 31 and we know that this is a type of course of the bride of christ but i believe sister karen pruitt was a virtuous woman he said who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies he says the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil that's right not only can brother tim say that today but every brother here that has this type of wife can say the same thing you know whenever you look at this solomon is writing from the epitome of experience and something that apparently he had been greatly affected by the daughter of pharaoh and some of these other wives that he had taken and he was having to take away from being the king that he was supposed to be to take care of so many marital problems and so many issues in his own home but somehow he knew there was a woman that if he could ever find that one that she would not pull away from what he was supposed to be but she would actually compliment and make him even more effective than what he was and in looking at this he said the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so he doesn't have to hire a detective to follow her around he doesn't really need an app on her phone to make sure that she's where she's supposed to be but her heart can his heart rather can safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil why because she is actually his crown this kind of a woman is truly an asset to a man and not a liability she is a gift that no other gifts could ever replace and this is as we are here today and we are so grateful for sister karen's victory being completed but actually because of we are still here in mortal realms we're kind of pulled between two dimensions there's a part of us that's been affected by the heavenly dimension and we've felt surges of it as it's came by today but there's another dimension that we are affected by and this this one in time the lord jesus stood at the tomb that day of lazarus and he knew in a few moments he would raise him from the dead but he allowed himself so to enter in by his emotions and his feelings into the realm of deaths and he knew it was only a moment but i'm so glad that he did it so that he would be able to be a high priest that when we lose someone so dear and so close we go to him and he can say i understand i really do and the shortest verse in the bible jesus wept so it's not a sin to cry but we also know that the victory that our sister has attained to requires more than crying it is worthy of such great rejoicing i want you to notice that whenever solomon said this about her she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life this woman she is such an asset into the life of this man and now he's speaking of course of the state before the children have come along but she is constantly faithful to help this man and everything that he's called to do and we know that the prophet said it over and over again that behind every good man is a good woman brother branham said it even about his own wife if there was ever anything good that come out of the branham family he said it should be attributed to his wife now people probably saw that he was just being complementary and being nice but i believe our prophet was speaking great words of wisdom i personally feel like that pastors wives ministers wives are some of the greatest unsung heroes that there are on the face of the earth now we know that the gift in the man's life is what of course gives him understanding to the word and helps him to be able to preach and his wife of course doesn't have that but whenever he's setting their studying and laboring and trying to bring something to god his wife many times is praying for him and feeling the burden and she's there and has to give up her time it has to give up so many things and let me tell you something sisters when the lord jesus calls these men of god that have stood around the world and they've preached and they prayed for the sick and they've cast out devils you remember brother branham's dream when he's going to stand before the lord as great as his position was god would not let him walk up there by himself but brother branham had personal attendees and it was one wife on one arm and one on the other arm can you imagine elijah the fulfillment of malachi 4 and he's going to stand up there but god did not want him to come by himself he wanted his queens to walk up there by him solomon went on to say in verse 13 she seeketh wool and flax and work us willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ships she bringeth her food from afar now he's speeding speaking metaphorically of the woman and we know of course in this time of era even the women of the hebrew women could not be able to do many of these things that he was attributing to her but is taking her position that she had and showing how industrious that she really was her husband did not feel threatened by this because she was not trying to be the head of the home she was just found what she was supposed to be and he deemed her as being very complementary to what he was he said she rises also while it is yet night and give us meat to her household and a portion to her maiden she considereth the field now this would have not been allowed of course in their day she considers the field and bias it and with the fruit of the fields she planteth a vineyard she girdles her loins with strengths and strengthen us her arms she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth out not by night the fact that her lamp did not goes out proves that this was a very diligent woman she was as the wise virgin of course in matthew chapter 25 verse 1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins five were wise and five were foolish five of them of course took oil and five did so here he's likening this wife to being this type of a woman she was an industrious type of individual she was not slothful she was not lazy but she had found her spot now all of us of course that knew sister karen knew that she was not the mayor of homer she was not the governor of louisiana she was not the vice president of the united states for her to have been called such a thing it would have been a slander why she was a daughter of god that knew her position and it's not in the white house telling mr biden what to do now i realize he does need somebody to tell him what to do but it was not supposed to be a woman to for sister karen to have been called the mayor of homer you you would have been better off to smack her in the face to call her the governor of louisiana she found her place the queen of this man's heart but she was not just restricted to being brother tim's queen but she was a great mother to her children to her grandchildren and to you church family it's not just the pruitt family that we say when i say lost you understand what i mean it's not just them that has lost someone but this church family has lost a very great great matriarch of faith one that that will never be replaced it's not like he's looking this morning but an individual like this can never be replaced will it be difficult i'm going to tell you it will there will be days come that you just think lord why why you know that that's that's not sinful you see this is something that people don't understand i think about the lord jesus that he was here he wanted to so partake of our humanity he allowed himself not only to say why but to feel why my god my god why why you see why is a powerful little word and we all ask it at one time or another and it's not necessarily sin when you ask it it's how you ask it when we ask it with an attitude and we're you know letting on as if so we know more about the plan of god than god does that is when we get in trouble but the lord jesus didn't just frame this three-letter word how many other letters it was in the hebrew but he allowed himself to feel why how many has felt why before why and you just didn't ask it but you actually felt why you see a person like this solomon goes on to say she lays her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the disc staff now he's actually quoting here what would have been in the time frame before the spinning wheel was actually invented by man so he's relating that she found whatever was there available for the time of the age now i know that we've certainly not been the only sisters that have lived down through time that were women of virtue martin luther in his time frame wesleyan the pentecostals they had great ladies but they were not given the same equipment that you sisters were we know that martin luther drank beer and you know smoked and this and that and the other and the ladies of that day were not the same caliber of the sisters that we have sitting here and this is why satan hates you he hates you your young sisters he hates you he wants to take your virtue from you but don't you let him have it and don't you when you get married sisters don't you feel like that you're no longer you know you can compare to the world that's right you no longer compare to them and you no longer want to compare to them because you have something that the word of god describes that's so much better than anything they will ever have as i was setting and the lord had placed this on my heart in a setting last night studying and brother tim had came in the room where i was at and there was a little table setting there in a little small bible that folded up and he said this is karen's bible i said oh my he said yeah this is hers if you'd like to pick it up and just thumb through it so everybody was preparing for bed and i picked up sister karen's bible i turn over to proverbs 31 the place that she had underlined was verse 10 where i was going to start and i had several verses that i was going to go down through and i looked down through those verses to see how far she had read but i had kind of messed up a little bit because there was one verse i wasn't going to include but as i looked down and i kept on reading i found the crown i found the crowning and sister karen would underline one verse and then she'd miss a verse or two or three and then she should underline another you know how we are certain things that stick out to us and so she hadn't underlined the next to the last one but she had underlined the last now you're wondering where it's at but just give me a few minutes i'm not quite ready for it yet but i thought lord as i speak tomorrow i'm not going to be speaking about a person that just memorized some verses and i thought god what an honor you've given me to be able to stand and speak about a daughter of god that the word was so personal to her it was made flesh it was made flesh and you sisters don't feel like you have a lot to do brother branham called you the fifth gospel matthew mark luke john and mother think of it he didn't even call us brothers that mother watch this as we go on in verse 20 he says she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reaches forth her hands to the needy she's not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet i believe that the family has a great great thing to attribute to brother tim being a godly man and a great minister and a prince among preachers but also believe that sister can attributed a great deal to this family here the natural thing of course was scarded and if you understand much about the scarlet colors and the purple the tyrannian purple was the most expensive actually the linen and the flax that they would have used to make their garments out of the flax would have come from the plant that was grown on the river now it was worth more it was more valuable than gold this woman had found somehow access into scarlet the tyrannian purple and the scarlet was taken from a shellfish something like a mollusk and they would take hundreds and hundreds of them each little shellfish would produce one drop of dye so they'd have to work and work and another was a coxacillus which was a certain oak tree and they would take those certain parts of that tree that oak plant and they would take them and grind them and it would take bushels and bushels of those to be able to produce the color but when you saw a person dressed and tyrinian purple or scarlet or red you knew they were a person of great means because the common people could not wear it you see we're not just different from the world because our women dress different and our men dress different and we use quotes you know and things like that but it's because the price was paid so extensively for our garments we're able to stand today and preach the gospel because people foreran us these three daughters here that come from this matriarch and her son which she loves so much this legacy will be handed on down and sister karen made it easier for you daughters they will be clothed in scarlet and they themselves will have the ability to spin on the reveal word of the hour to take the acoxazillus and through the strenuous work and labor and the reproach and be able to manifest and continue this legacy as it keeps going she makes her self-coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple evidences of her family as well oh the fruit family needless to say they would be nothing like the rockefellers they would be nothing like many people like that i would rather have their wealth than john paul getty i'd rather have their wealth than the owner of amazon his amazon stuff will do no good when he stands before the lord jesus they wouldn't be considered in one of their wealth his family know about it no doubt in claiborne parish but the way god looks at it a daughter of god was able to be carried across the breach of time and step out of that old ship of zion and closed in a theophany body you see when those who raise in the second resurrection and they stand before the white throne we know the reason of their condemnation is because the clothes they have on you see for those who raise and they raise in the same body they send in their clothes condemn them don't you understand when a saint of god moves into that theophany they have attained to the very attribute of the fullness of god and their clothes prove who they are she make us find linen and sell us it and deliver us girdles unto the merchant strength and honor are her closing and she shall rejoice in time to come so metaphorically the clothes are identified with her traits and her characteristics now sister cam was not a flamboyant woman she was not a pushy type of woman sister karen and my wife carol were a lot alike both of them were not very forward and they felt backward and quiet and misunderstood by a lot of people in reality they were not the type that had to be heard by everybody but i just imagine when she stepped out of that old ship of zion and put her foot up on the bank and started running her hands through that bluegrass and the lord god sent someone down by the river if she was able to look down my hands aren't bruised her clothes declared who she was she opened her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her household and he does not the bread of vitalness is this right children her children oh mothers you won't be great you want to be great what greatest thing could be said about you then for your children to arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praises her you see as the children of a virtuous woman mature they also have this desire and they recognize the wisdom that they misunderstood in their use they recognize the fountain of love and the purity that their mother handed to them it'll become more real to these daughters and this son as they go on her husband praises her by telling others how god gave him such a wife he praises her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all now i was going to stop with verse 30. favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised and sister karen didn't have that verse line underlined but she did this one give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates praise be to god heavenly father we thank you for such a lady that has lived among us we thank you for such a queen a daughter of god lord is was talking about it the other day and whenever she had her home coming most of us probably saw it whenever she was able to come through that bout of sickness lord they brother tim driving her home and she got out saints were there rejoicing and many many people saw it around the world they gave her a homecoming in our minds we was hoping this time would be similar maybe but this time you wanted to give her the homecoming but the tim couldn't take her where she needed to go her husband that so loved her her children that so admired her but nobody could take her horse she needed to go this time but you so you had to send a host to come down to pack her away but my what a homecoming she's had she's only been there a few days in the way that we measure time but she hasn't had a clock a watch she's not had one pain she's not felt one moment of sadness she's already met the prophet already met loved ones and friends she's not going anywhere she's not tired she's not weary lord jesus i pray you would help those of us that are left behind may we press the battle may we press the battle until that day arrives when we can all be gathered together i pray for my dear precious little buddy today that you're stricted help him father i pray for the children lord the grandchildren son-in-law's the daughter-in-law the church family the host of friends that have gathered no doubt we'll draw from the vaulted memories of things about sister karen but we will await until the time arrives that we'll see her again help us today father we ask in jesus name amen god bless you saints what a testimony amen what a testimony amen let's stand together we're going to sing a couple songs before we turn it to brother ron the battle is the lord's yeah [Music] there is a source in times of me that gives me hope that brings me peace in every tribe through every test i save your stance in my defense [Music] all your strength is gone and your heart feels [Music] take courage [Music] i shall falter and makes me stand up along the waters all your strengths [Music] is god is greater than the strong take courage i know the master of the wind [Music] my boat of life sails on the troubled sea [Music] i have a friend who washes over me [Music] [Music] [Music] sometimes i soar like an eagle in the sky [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] one more time i know [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] aren't you glad that you know that master it makes all the difference in the entire world because troubles will come sorrows will come but he made you a promise and it made it very personal i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you to the end of the world amen i want to read the lord's prayer if you read it with me today amen matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. the disciples knew that they would come to some very difficult situations in life and sometimes we just don't know what to say or how to communicate with god and he gave us one of the most simple prayers yet so incredibly powerful not praying it to a man or a preacher or a bishop or a cardinal but to god himself and he knew that in many times we were going to come to him in trouble and distress and heartbroken and looking at devastations that we humanly could not handle and he gave us an example our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen you may be seated today we are here to honor a queen we're not ashamed to call her the queen she was the queen of louisiana she was a queen because she stepped out of the eternities of the thoughts of god and stepped into the realm of time through her mother and father she began to grow up and be a beautiful young girl she didn't realize but god had incredible plans for her shy quiet mischievous as she could be she had a way that she could smile that would warm your heart and the sharpness in her eyes that would win anybody's favor she would go to church with her mother and father and it would be one of their first services in this particular place young unmarried prince standing in the pulpit she didn't realize where life was about to take her but you see god watched over her through the eternities watched over her seed all the way down wanted to have that certain color hair that certain build certain mannerisms that she would have because she would need that to conduct herself as a queen she no doubt didn't realize when she began to fall in love and he began to fall in love that he was going to be one of god's greatest generals that would ever be on the face of the earth and she was going to be one of god's greatest queens that would be on the face of the earth as it has been said behind every great man is a great woman brother branham taught us to choose another bride he says we know the inside of a man by what he chooses now he can do a lot of things and make a lot of decisions but what he chooses as a wife reflects the very inside of him and so when brother tim chose her and she was more than just a message believer she was the characteristics of christ in human flesh more than quotes more than beautiful sermons but she was the embodiment of the ministry of tim pruitt now let's just be honest with you this lady let's give her her accolades just now she probably heard more preaching at 62 years old than any other woman in history give the lord a good hand it's that truth brother tim and i have we were counting it up at home the other day and we have spoke about 70 meetings together we've had an incredible time together all of us have had incredible relationships together we are honored to be friends and stand amongst god's generals no one greater than another but when god was choosing his best to live in laodicea god didn't do that haphazardly he called he called you to be his absolute best not actors not impersonators but real real people that could stand in the presence of god and be real then become models to the community if i wanted to be a christian i believe i would want to be like her now that's a testimony of a real lady of what a real pastor's wife is she was a lady whether it was in germany or in switzerland or in new zealand shenandoah valley she was a real lady and as a real lady she conducted herself that way she was mischievous she was a lot of fun she was incredibly competitive we invited brother donnie and sister carol to play putt-putt with us one night it was their first time and sister carol didn't quite how to know how to do it and she showed her every trick that she could show her let me just say this to you she was humble in everything except for competitiveness and to be very honest with you she beat me every time and let me know it brother tim really didn't care where he won or lost he he preached generally all the way the 18 holes you know that he was whether it was the new birth or whatever it was he was sharing his thoughts and his quotes and he had to take out time to hit the ball but she was a real lady and that's what that's what made her so much fun to all of us she captured our hearts you sisters know yes most of us thought she had wings but there were times that she hung them up she would be to me the best german chocolate cake maker in the world no i'm not being a politician today brother tim connie don't make german chocolate another story for another day it was at the last october meeting brother david mayer was staying in the same house with us and and sister karen asked us on the way home after service she said brother on what would you like to eat they had that chocolate cake hadn't been touched yet and i said boy i'd like to sure have a piece of that german chocolate cake brother tim was sure that that the cake named german didn't come from germany because he'd never tasted anything like that in germany and brother david was inquisitive of where it did come from and it would be that night that we would figure out that it was a man named german that came up with the recipe of that cake no that cake didn't last two weeks it was about three days and we enjoyed every bit of it the diet was over if you know anything about the pruitt house if brother tim's on a diet you're on a diet if he's feasting and having comfort food you are as well the other day when we were here brother donnie and we were here brother john we would go to strums and have some comfort food pie was necessary to have it was a time of a lot of deep thoughts a time of thinking about things of how they were where we were at but you see all of the sermons that she heard was preparing her for this day it's not a day of defeat it's not a day to where that we dreary and say this is the end her last heartbeat was only the beginning why we came and families came and i'd like to say thank you to the all of the sisters that were there to and the brothers that were there to help with watching over her and taking care of sister karen many visitors came and we were honored we were thrilled to come we wanted to come earlier but we couldn't get here just in time we were sitting in the room and i just want to share this with you we were sitting in the room and brother tim would sing to her but i was sitting in the chair and i noticed the octave level went to another another place i slipped around behind the bed where brother tim was standing and i got just toward the head of the bed and i wanted to join him for the moment and i could tell why because the angel of the lord that warm presence of god was standing at the head of her bed you see she had unseen guests as well sister esther as that presence would flow across you to let you know that you're just not the only one in the room i believe we come to realize today that we're not the only ones in this room we've heard it so incredibly placed at chapter 31 never heard it any better and it couldn't have been for a greater lady of how great that she was no this queen doesn't need a chariot to ride out in front but god has sent representatives from all over the world to sit here to sit at her funeral at her memorial that are going home at our celebration today that you recognize that that was more than just a little poor girl from washington that predestination brought her to louisiana and watched over all the days of her life and as she come and she became a great lady in this house and you watched over her as she would turn her husband loose to go to battle she did her everything that she could to help him in every way that she could every need to make sure that the atmosphere was right in their home and she was quite a decorator she wanted that atmosphere right she was very conscious of the presence of the lord you see it was more than a sermon to her it was another step into eternity no she never complained and i was around her a bit she never complained at how long her husband spoke she never got weary at that she loved it she loved every service caused us some difficult moments she would come through them over and over we were standing in germany at an incredible meeting and she got called out into the into the aisle and god touched her and made her new she came home a different woman now that same lord jesus touched her many many years ago and made that little girl that was such a darling a real lady of grace now it's not just for her but it's for her daughters and her son and from the fruit of her womb would come another general that would stand on the scene and preach the gospel and she wasn't shy about telling you that he was one of her favorite preachers she loved her grandchildren she loved each and every one of you with no exception whatsoever she loved you with all of her hearts no she didn't die the other day she did that many years ago but what she did the other day was change clothes we were begging for another word from her we were begging for another hug another passionate kiss we were begging for a conversation with her over again but god was going to save that beyond the curtain of time she has met fanny crosby she's met the great ladies of grace she's met my mother she met her mother no doubt she's dancing she's enjoying it's hard for us to fathom but let me just say this you being a queen here she's a queen there jesus would remind us of these words let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know and the way that you know and thomas sayeth unto him we know not whether thou goest or how can we know that way and jesus said unto him i am the way i am the truth and i am the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me and let me just say this to you more than a scripture took place the other day she didn't go to a home of brick and mortar and stone she stepped into a well body one that i'd like to just tell the devil if i could put him on notice you can't touch her no more you can't touch her no more you lose again you see there will not be another brain bleed there not be another one there'll not be more high blood pressure and anxiety that you'll have to deal with those demons had to go find somebody else because she said in her competitive nature if it's still that way sister connie she'd like to tell us sister carol i got here first isaiah would write it like this and it would be so incredible who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a rudolph to dry ground as a and he hath no formula calmliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief he had to become that way to know what you're going through today and knowing what you're going through today he knows how to help you he was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed i'd like to proclaim to you that death has not won today it has not won but actually the opposite has taken place when i was studying this week to to look at anything that i could bring strength to you i was reminded of of the germany trip that morning brother tim brother raymond thompson spoke a sermon on who was jesus it would be that night that god would touch her and strengthen her and there was a almost a poem that was that was said there and i thought it would be so incredible i i'd like to share it with you today who is jesus he came from the bosom of the father to the bosom of a woman he put on humanity that we might put on his deity he became the son of man that we might become the sons of god he came from heaven where rivers never freeze winds never blow and frost never chills the air flowers never fade and no one is ever sick what a land there's no undertakers no graveyards for no one ever dies no one is ever buried he was born contrary to the laws of nature he lived in poverty reared in obscurity crossed the boundaries of the land only once in childhood he had no wealth nor influence neither training of formal education his relatives were inconspicuous and influential in infancy he startled kings in boyhood he puzzled wise men in manhood ruled the courses of nature he walked on the billows and hussed the sea to sleep he healed the multitude without medicine and made no charge for his services he never read a book yet all the libraries of the country could not hold the books that were written about him he never wrote a song yet he furnished the theme of more songs than all the songwriters combined he never founded a college yet all the schools together cannot boast of as many students as he has he never practiced psychology yet he healed more broken hearts then all the doctors could touch he never marshaled an army drafted a soldier fired a gun yet no leader has ever had more volunteers who under his orders made rebels stack arms and surrender without a shot being fired he is the star of astronomy he is the rock of geology he is the lion and the lamb he is the harmonizer of all discords the healer of all diseases great men have come and gone yet their lives herod could not kill him satan could not seduce him death could not destroy him and the grave could not hold him he laid aside the purple robe of royalty for a peasant's gown he was rich yet for our sakes he became poor he cruised the lake on another's boat he rode on another man's donkey he was buried in another man's tomb all have failed but he never failed this jesus that lived in sister karen was jesus was god was deity it conquered every sin that was in her life every failure and every complex that she dealt with throughout her life this jesus was so personal she stands as a pure and virtuous woman today no holes to be poked no faults to be said she is the queen not just here but she's now a queen in heaven i'd just like to say this to you jesus prepared for this event it did not catch him by surprise it won't catch you by surprise he's made preparations for us and just as his angel stood by her bed to take her home the song says swing low sweet chariot maybe you're here today and you don't know jesus that changed her life that helped her to con conduct herself as a queen to stand beside of a general and have pictures taken throughout life she was never ashamed of her general but she was never ashamed of her jesus never ashamed and john would write it like this as we come to a close and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared it as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe all away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death i hope satan's listening today there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new not just back to where she was when she was 18 19 20 years old but at her very best what god thought of her and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end and i will give unto thee that is a thirst the fountain of water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son she wants to hear her master say well done but i believe we as a body of believers could look at this at the end of this service today and from this side of the veil say sister karen well done well done girl well done sister karen mary karen pruitt well done we loved her we enjoyed our time but it is not ophaha what do we do brother ron i just thought i'd just leave it with this brother tim all of us ministers we need you this body of believers we need you brother tim you have been an incredible journey general but we've got a lot more meetings to preach we've got a lot more masterpieces to hear from and this will only mold you in a different way to make you a better piece of ammunition against the devil hallelujah satan i'd like to tell you you made a bad move you made a really bad move there's nothing like a soldier with a chip on his shoulder more time to sharpen his sword more time to study more time to be alone with god move in the words of another great man satan be careful brother tim we love you i say it publicly we love you with all of our hearts we'd like to be able to take the pain and the hurt from you we as your friends are here not just now but the rest of our lives we commit that to you but there's a friend that sticketh closer than even a brother when that warm presence comes in the room ministers to you our lord jesus will be there for you i'm not a i'm not a singer at all and this way you can leave the service and it won't offend me but i'd like to sing on the wings of a snow white dove if we could do that is that all right brother danny that's all right what a service feels like we've said in a moment of time eternity [Music] could we stand and sing this together on the wings god sent his pure sweet love a song [Music] no one had [Music] on the flood's many days he searched for foreign [Music] god on the wings [Music] could we sing that last verse together [Music] i cried for him [Music] aren't you glad that he gave on the me [Music] of us [Music] [Music] what wonderful messages amen hallelujah amen our greatest enemy lucifer that old serpent the dragon the serpent he'll never have anything said of like that over him never in fact it says they look narrowly upon him and say is this the man amen but he'll never hear anything he was never a virtuous person at one time he might have been close but he left that one a long time ago he'll never have preachers stand over him and say what a blessing he was amen but here would be the last thing you see some preachers stand over him say get out of here amen and what a send-off for our sister hallelujah why don't we sing swing low sweet chariot amen i looked over jordan what did i see oh coming [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] tell all my friends i'm coming [Applause] swing can you sing it again praise the lord this time we want all the ministers if you'll come up on the platform they want to take a photo of you with brother tim amen all the ministers at this time amen all your rest can be seated amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] amen could we all stand [Music] praise the lord wonderful to be here today encountered a great privilege and a great honor i want to close in prayer it's been a wonderful wonderful time and the lord have heard such wonderful things there's no way to add to it it doesn't need anything added to it it's been grand all the way around i sure appreciate for my part and on behalf of my wife and i we sure have our a great love for the pruitt family amen our whole family calls brother tim uncle tim so amen so my nephew asked me to close in prayer and and if i had any words to say um that this would be a good time but courtesy dictates that we'll just close out i loved sister karen she was a grand lady my wife considered her a good friend and a buddy but i mean every sister in the world in the message considered sister karen a buddy she's that kind of a lady a man a friend to everybody and we've certainly loved the family for many many years i was watching the the pictures on the screen and i i thought wow those pictures are going to hang in the in the hall of fame in heaven amen they probably hang as wanted posters in the areas of hell right now but in heaven they're going to be in the hall of fame amen so we love and appreciate the lord for his taking care of our sister and uh this is such a wonderful send-off i think about the land that she's in you know it always strikes me that when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time he had no difficulty describing what he saw he described it he tells us in great detail you know i saw the it was a rising hill and grass and it rolled up over and i saw looked like millions of sisters running and then men and he described them my said their their eyes looked like stars and and he described seeing his horse and his dog and and a woman that was he didn't recognize because she was past 90. he recognized hope he told us about it he told us about everything that he heard said he had no trouble relaying what he saw and what he heard but what he could not describe to his dying day was how he felt he said i don't have any words no way to describe it he said nothing could touch it that feeling that he had being there and that is the feeling our sister is enjoying today that make you then i throw your heart to think about that my trouble's over beyond the enemy's reach now amen let's pray master we thank you thank you for the opportunity to have been here today thank you for all of these redeemed of the lord who have come lord and gathered to pay lord respects to a grand lady to a great wife of a great ministry a great assembly lord around the world we people watch the services that take place here and there's there's great admiration lord for the ministry
