[20:51] confidence tonight knowing that not one
[20:53] of them caught you by surprise Lord that
[20:55] before the foundation of the world you
[20:57] knew exactly where the enemy would
[20:59] attack you knew the needs that these
[21:00] bodies would have and Lord there at

[21:49] there is none like you and I believe
[21:51] with all my heart tonight Lord that this

[45:32] and that means so much to me you're
[45:34] blessed to have such a man of God who
[45:36] stays with the word
[45:38] who believes in the power of the Holy
[45:40] Ghost and the move of the spirit and
[45:42] doesn't waver to the left or to the
[45:44] right I say stay with your pastor he's
[45:46] the order one ordained to take you
[45:48] through amen we're just thankful to be
[45:51] here reading out of First Peter
[45:54] chapter 1 verse 3 through 5.
[45:58] it says blessed be the God and father of
[46:01] our Lord Jesus Christ which according to
[46:03] His abundant Mercy hath begotten us
[46:05] again unto a lively Hope by the
[46:08] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[46:10] dead to an inheritance incorruptible
[46:14] and unfiled and that fadeth not away
[46:18] reserved in heaven for you who are kept
[46:22] by the power of God through faith unto
[46:25] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[46:28] last time amen you may have your seats
[46:31] my I just like that in reading the
[46:33] Scripture it says that it's reserved in
[46:36] heaven for you
[46:38] God has made a reservation for you
[46:43] you have an inheritance that God has
[46:45] already given to you and the problem is
[46:48] a lot of us just don't know it we're
[46:51] just starting to find out about it but
[46:53] you have your name on a seat up there in
[46:55] heaven and there ain't no way for you to
[46:58] miss it
[46:59] I just want I just want to go ahead and
[47:01] say that at the very beginning that God
[47:03] has made a reservation for you in heaven
[47:05] you're going to be sitting at the
[47:07] banqueting table your name is already
[47:09] written down there and there is no way
[47:12] for you to miss it
[47:14] now I know the devil hates that he hates
[47:16] predestination he hates that God by
[47:19] foreknowledge was able to foresee you in
[47:22] this day sitting in that Pew knowing
[47:24] exactly what you were going to wear
[47:26] knowing that all the Wiles of the devil
[47:28] and all of hell would be thrown at you
[47:30] and no matter what the devil could try
[47:32] to do to take you out of the kingdom of
[47:35] God no matter what the devil could try
[47:37] to do to keep you from making it there
[47:39] there's nothing he can do because God
[47:41] has already made a provision for you
[47:43] nothing can stop you from getting there
[47:45] because he's already made reservations
[47:47] look this ain't like reservations you
[47:49] make to a wedding and you tell your
[47:51] friend hey we're going to be there you
[47:53] go ahead and sign up for it and you say
[47:54] hey I'm going to put my name down put
[47:56] down for five me and my family are going
[47:58] to be there and then some complications

[48:03] your airplane or something happens and

[48:10] your abilities but this ain't about
[48:13] man's abilities this is about what God
[48:15] has promised it's about what his
[48:17] abilities is and With God all things are
[48:20] possible you have an inheritance come on

[48:26] just want to preach to you a little bit
[48:27] tonight I'm being carried by the power
[48:29] of God all if there was ever a people
[48:32] that were being carried by the power of
[48:34] God it's the pride of Jesus Christ

[50:36] well
[50:37] we we we're gonna we're gonna preach
[50:39] before we get started
[50:42] the prophet of God would say this
[50:45] now I'm going to say something National
[50:46] Forest will put Israel in her Homeland
[50:48] this is out of recognizing your day and
[50:50] its message
[50:53] National Forest will put the church
[50:56] in the world Council of churches
[50:59] but the power of God will put the people
[51:02] in The Bride
[51:04] the world forces this way
[51:07] and the world forces that way
[51:10] but God forces upward
[51:13] well you want to know where you're going
[51:14] tonight Church you're going upward
[51:17] because there's a power that is forcing
[51:19] you upward you might be trying to turn
[51:22] to the left you might be turned trying
[51:24] to turn to right but there's a power of
[51:25] God over your life that no matter what
[51:27] you do God is going to get you back to
[51:30] where you're supposed to be or you can
[51:32] run for a while you can run for five
[51:35] years or ten years but there's a power
[51:37] of God that has been looking out over
[51:38] your life and is forcing you one way
[51:40] look the devil's wanting to force you
[51:42] down but the power of God is going to
[51:44] force you up
[51:46] the spirit of God which is the word of
[51:49] God my word is spirit and life will put
[51:53] the bride in her place
[51:57] because she'll recognize her position in
[51:59] the word then she's in Christ
[52:02] we'll put her in her place no National
[52:04] Force will do it
[52:07] and some people are looking for some
[52:09] National Force
[52:11] you know people are looking for a
[52:13] squeeze to come that's Oliver going to
[52:14] send to make us like oh my goodness
[52:17] it's time to be the Bride of Jesus
[52:19] Christ no it ain't going to be National
[52:21] Force it's not going to be coveted it's
[52:24] not going to be some laws and some
[52:26] regulations where we finally realize you
[52:28] know what Aaron I think we should be a
[52:30] son and daughter of God
[52:31] no sir no this is something that this
[52:34] ain't about what the devil is doing this
[52:36] is about what God is doing this is all
[52:39] about what God is doing in the people
[52:41] that God wanted to have a bride he
[52:43] wanted to have Fellowship he wanted to
[52:44] be in a union he wanted to make her bone
[52:46] of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh and
[52:48] life of my life and what power of his
[52:50] power this is about a people that God
[52:52] has elected in the end time to put death
[52:55] under its feet
[52:56] [Applause]
[53:00] the devil's forcing this way the world's
[53:02] forcing one way
[53:04] yeah National Forest forced Israel back
[53:06] in our home and but what did he say no
[53:08] National Force will do it
[53:10] the national forest did Drive Israel to
[53:12] her Homeland the National Force forces
[53:14] of the council the churches will drive
[53:16] every organization into it but
[53:19] the power of God
[53:22] will raise the bride into Glory out of
[53:25] it
[53:26] amen so it's the power of God that's
[53:29] going to raise the bride into glory and
[53:32] out of it so it's the very power of God
[53:34] that's keeping you it's guarding you
[53:36] it's protecting you it's transforming
[53:38] you into the very image of Jesus Christ
[53:41] it's that power that's raising you into
[53:43] Glory you're being carried by the power
[53:46] of God
[53:48] so it's time to open up the Bible and
[53:50] look at your inheritance and feed on the
[53:52] message of the hour and realize that all
[53:54] of these things that have been spoken
[53:55] it's concerning your your inheritance
[54:01] this is for you quick quit putting it
[54:03] off on somebody else
[54:06] this is all about you
[54:09] and it's time to take ownership yes it's
[54:12] all about you God set this whole thing
[54:15] up and all by Design and and he allowed
[54:17] it to come all the way down to the
[54:19] church ages that you would catch the
[54:21] revelation of Who You Are
[54:24] and while you are here
[54:26] and where you are going
[54:31] there's been a word that has been spoken
[54:34] concerning you
[54:36] a promise
[54:38] a description
[54:40] of something that God had in his mind
[54:43] concerning you
[54:45] and he had that thought and God's
[54:47] thoughts are eternal
[54:49] and then he that thought that he had of
[54:51] you you know the word the word is a seed
[54:53] and he planted that seed and now here
[54:56] you are you you you're coming into
[54:58] hearing the word and you're starting to
[55:00] wrestle him well I think it's something
[55:02] inside of me wants it but I don't think
[55:04] I can have it I look at my passion I
[55:06] look at all these things well that
[55:07] that's because you're looking at all the
[55:08] baggage you're looking at your flesh
[55:10] you're looking at all your faults and
[55:11] your failures but God is looking at a
[55:13] promise he's looking at his word you
[55:15] know there was a perfect image a perfect
[55:18] picture before you before a man ever
[55:20] fell into sin you were with God you were
[55:22] in God you were part of God you were his
[55:24] thinking you are his word
[55:28] so I I just wanna this might seem like
[55:30] I'm grabbing a a portion of a quote out
[55:32] of nowhere but this is pertaining to you
[55:34] because the prophet of God would say in
[55:35] the church age book he's saying in these
[55:37] last days the true bride Church Christ
[55:40] seed will come to The Headstone and she
[55:43] will be the Super Church
[55:46] a super race as she mirrors him well I
[55:49] got news for you Church we're nearing
[55:51] him he's here the Capstone has come he's
[55:53] crying Grace Grace this is a message of
[55:56] Grace
[55:57] we have received Christ the word he's
[55:59] come to his bride
[56:01] we're nearing the Capstone we're nearing
[56:03] The Headstone so I don't care wherever
[56:05] you you want to put it we're nearing him
[56:10] so then he says as she nears him
[56:14] they in the bride will be so much like
[56:17] him
[56:18] that they will even be in his very image
[56:20] this is in order to be United with him
[56:23] they will be one they will be the very
[56:25] manifestation listen to this now they
[56:28] will be the very manifestation of the
[56:31] word of the Living God denominations
[56:34] can't produce this wrong seed
[56:37] but they will be the very manifestation
[56:40] of the word of the Living God now that
[56:43] sounds like a challenge that sounds like
[56:45] something that my goodness if I can get
[56:47] all of my ducks in a row that my I can
[56:50] be this super race and if I if I can
[56:53] just study out the message and and I can
[56:55] just kind of go through through Christ
[56:57] The Mystery of God revealed and in the
[57:00] rising of the Sun and if I can just line
[57:02] all of these things out doctrinally and
[57:04] if and if I can try to execute a good
[57:07] works and an ability to to recite that's
[57:10] not what this is all about this is not
[57:12] about what you can do and your ability
[57:14] to digest the message of the hour and
[57:17] give a book report to your pastor no
[57:19] this is god making a promise
[57:22] this is god making a declaration that
[57:25] I'm going to have a pride she's going to
[57:27] be a super race she's going to be just
[57:30] like me she's going to be in my very
[57:32] image this is about something that God
[57:34] has promised this isn't a challenge this
[57:36] isn't a request this is a prophet he's
[57:38] saying I'm going to have a bride and
[57:41] here she is get a good look at it here
[57:43] she sits right here tonight a super race
[57:46] a super people more than conquerors more
[57:49] than Overcomers in Jesus Christ because
[57:52] you've been United to the bridegroom
[57:57] it's time for us to quit uh uh uh
[57:59] wondering who we are wondering if it's
[58:03] for us wonder if if we can really even
[58:05] be all of that the prophet spoke yes you
[58:09] can because there's a power
[58:11] that will carry you into every promise
[58:14] that God has made
[58:16] if God said he would have a bride
[58:18] without spot and without wrinkle then
[58:20] there that that's not something that you
[58:22] are going to do but that's a power of
[58:24] God that he is sent out into the pride
[58:27] of Jesus Christ to produce what he said
[58:30] he said he'd have a bride and here she
[58:32] is
[58:33] get it out of your mind quick quick quit
[58:36] wondering if I am the bride if I can do
[58:38] it oh we have these mind battles over
[58:40] and over and I know you got prayed for
[58:42] and I know you've been overcoming and I
[58:44] know you fell again well just repent get
[58:46] back up keep going on with God because
[58:48] you ain't gonna stop the word of God the
[58:51] devil's not going to stop the word of
[58:52] God nothing's going to stop the word of
[58:54] God so your minds will just be what God
[58:56] made you you are an overcomer you are
[58:59] the Victorious bride of Jesus Christ you
[59:02] can do all things because God has given
[59:04] you a faith to believe all things glory
[59:06] to God I feel pretty good there's a
[59:09] people that are on the face of the Earth
[59:10] that has been given a faith a perfect
[59:12] Faith to believe a perfect word that all
[59:15] things are possible
[59:16] come on church all things are possible
[59:19] to them that believe
[59:20] [Applause]
[59:23] that's a promise
[59:26] oh Hallelujah
[59:28] and the Very one that made the promise
[59:32] denomination wants to put them off at
[59:34] the the pie in the sky
[59:38] put them in the future put him in the
[59:40] past
[59:41] but this very one who made the promise
[59:45] by the authority of scripture
[59:48] is right here
[59:50] right now
[59:55] right here right now
[59:58] do we believe it
[1:00:01] whether you believe it or not he's here
[1:00:05] and I want to say if he's here we might
[1:00:06] as well be like the woman that touched
[1:00:08] the Hem of His Garment
[1:00:10] say I might have been serving God a long
[1:00:12] time 10 15 years but no maybe the words
[1:00:14] coming to you in such Simplicity what
[1:00:17] would it take would it take for him to
[1:00:18] be wearing a robe and wearing sandals
[1:00:20] would it take a picture of two thousand
[1:00:23] years ago and you having to see the very
[1:00:25] physical image of Jesus Christ walking
[1:00:28] down the aisle is that what it's going
[1:00:30] to take to put you into action Church is
[1:00:32] it going to take some work up is it
[1:00:34] going to take the minister or is it
[1:00:36] going to be a revelation that breaks out
[1:00:37] in your heart and all of a sudden you
[1:00:39] realize you know what I believe the word
[1:00:41] that I'm hearing that Jesus Christ is
[1:00:43] right now he's in the building he's
[1:00:46] walking down the aisle and I say why
[1:00:47] don't you open up your heart and receive
[1:00:49] it why didn't you say Lord I believe
[1:00:51] your word and I believe that all things
[1:00:53] are possible I believe him for this need
[1:00:55] in my life Lord and I believe that
[1:00:57] you've come here on a Wednesday night to
[1:01:00] bring forth the manifestation of your
[1:01:01] promise because there's a power that's
[1:01:03] been over in my life something that's
[1:01:05] been keeping me something's been keeping
[1:01:07] my mind something that's been keeping me

[1:01:52] be manifestations let there be great
[1:01:54] Powers sweep through the Church of the
[1:01:56] Living God not the spiritual gifts also
[1:01:59] overwhelm us that we might see the
[1:02:01] purifier oh we got by Divine promise the
[1:02:04] pillar of fire is here right now
[1:02:07] if Paul can't believe all things are
[1:02:10] possible
[1:02:11] Hallelujah
[1:02:13] what about a church
[1:02:16] this is where things happen
[1:02:25] Paul said in First Corinthians 2 4
[1:02:31] maybe if you turn there
[1:02:33] First Corinthians 2 4 and 5.
[1:02:47] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:02:49] with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[1:02:52] but in demonstration
[1:02:55] of the spirit and of power
[1:03:02] well I'll tell you what we got a lot of
[1:03:04] speech
[1:03:06] and a lot of preaching
[1:03:08] that are enticing words of man's wisdoms
[1:03:12] quotes all weave together to support
[1:03:15] their ideas and their stand and their
[1:03:18] questions and they want to be the source
[1:03:20] of all a revelation and inspiration and
[1:03:24] be able to line out everybody and then
[1:03:26] come on man let's look at your church
[1:03:28] let's look at your life where's the
[1:03:30] power of God where's the new birth
[1:03:32] where's the signs where's the Miracles
[1:03:35] and you're you're going to be the
[1:03:37] Fountain of all knowledge
[1:03:39] well I'm sorry maybe that's a little
[1:03:41] hobby horse of mine but I want to see
[1:03:43] something real you know when it says
[1:03:44] demonstration that means manifestation
[1:03:48] then what you're talking about Paul's
[1:03:49] saying look I know what I'm talking
[1:03:51] about
[1:03:52] I didn't come just just to just to give
[1:03:54] you a fancy sermon but I come to preach
[1:03:57] a gospel and I know the reality of that
[1:03:59] gospel because that reality is now in
[1:04:02] operation in my life it's an operation
[1:04:04] that I'm preaching the gospel and those
[1:04:07] people that are hearing the word that's
[1:04:09] being preached these signs are following
[1:04:11] them that believe if you go into all the
[1:04:13] world and you preach the gospel these
[1:04:16] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:04:18] well if what you're preaching and
[1:04:20] they're believing it and nothing's
[1:04:22] following then I think we got a problem
[1:04:23] in the formula
[1:04:25] well I don't know why we're over here
[1:04:27] but we'll just keep preaching and my
[1:04:29] speech and my preacher was not with
[1:04:30] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:04:32] demonstration or manifestation of the
[1:04:35] spirit and power that your faith should
[1:04:37] not stand in the wisdom of men but in
[1:04:40] the power of God
[1:04:42] and the prophet of God would say it like
[1:04:43] this in the fourth seal he would say the
[1:04:45] word itself is Spirit
[1:04:50] it is Spirit in word form and then you
[1:04:53] see when it is quickened or brought to
[1:04:55] life the spirit of the word goes to work
[1:04:58] and acts
[1:05:00] well if you if you need a further
[1:05:02] definition of that just go open and open
[1:05:04] up your Bible and read the book of Acts
[1:05:08] the word itself is Spirit it is Spirit
[1:05:12] in word form and then you see when it is
[1:05:14] quickened or brought to life the spirit
[1:05:16] of the word goes to work and acts I want
[1:05:19] to say if we preach the word because
[1:05:21] it's the spirit of the word if we preach
[1:05:24] the word we'll get word results
[1:05:27] if you want the power of God in
[1:05:29] operation preach the power of God
[1:05:32] don't just preach a portion of the word
[1:05:35] preach the fullness of the word we got a
[1:05:37] lot of people that are preaching a
[1:05:38] portion of the word that's why they get
[1:05:40] portion results oh but when you can get
[1:05:42] a church whose body in is sold out and
[1:05:45] it's caught the revelation of the
[1:05:46] message and that preaching an open book
[1:05:48] If You Preach an open book you get a
[1:05:51] result of the book you get Acts 2 38 you
[1:05:54] get signs and you get Miracles falling
[1:05:56] you get the power of God sweeping
[1:05:58] through the church why because the
[1:06:00] fullness of the word is being preached
[1:06:02] oh and that's the only thing the bride
[1:06:04] wants to feed on give me all of the word
[1:06:06] I don't want just a portion of the word
[1:06:08] I want all the words I want it all I
[1:06:11] want the tongues I want the dancing I
[1:06:13] want the preaching I want the
[1:06:14] prophesying I want the interpretation I
[1:06:17] Want It All give it all to me it's in
[1:06:20] there it's my an inheritance and if it's
[1:06:22] my inheritance there's a power come on
[1:06:25] there is a power to make you get your
[1:06:28] inheritance there's a power here tonight
[1:06:31] that will bring you into going home if
[1:06:34] you can just believe and say oh God here
[1:06:37] I am I want what you have for me
[1:06:40] Hallelujah
[1:06:42] you're kept by the power of God
[1:06:48] Jesus said
[1:06:50] the words that I speak
[1:06:53] they are Spirit
[1:06:56] and they are life
[1:06:59] prophet of God would say this he would
[1:07:01] say brother
[1:07:03] a real born-again man or woman can't
[1:07:06] stand still
[1:07:08] there is something in them
[1:07:11] they've got to testify
[1:07:14] they've got to do something
[1:07:17] they are bound to do something
[1:07:20] they can't hold their peace
[1:07:25] I could give personal testimony
[1:07:31] oh if you know what it's like
[1:07:33] to be under the burden of sin
[1:07:36] if you know what it's like to be under
[1:07:38] the Taskmaster of the devil
[1:07:41] don't let devil play tricks with your
[1:07:43] mind
[1:07:43] you can grow up on a message Pew and
[1:07:45] never gone out in the world and be in
[1:07:47] the same condition
[1:07:52] but when you meet him
[1:07:54] oh
[1:07:55] I'm telling you
[1:07:57] ain't nothing like it
[1:07:59] let's save yourself some heartache save
[1:08:01] yourself from trouble
[1:08:03] bypass all the drugs and alcohol and the
[1:08:05] running around and the money and the
[1:08:07] women just bypass it all because none of
[1:08:09] that can come even close
[1:08:12] to what God has for you
[1:08:15] because I've been out there I tried it I
[1:08:19] ran around I I said it'll take you
[1:08:22] further than you want to go
[1:08:24] and that void and that hunger that was
[1:08:26] inside of me no matter how much I tried
[1:08:28] and no matter how long I went and no
[1:08:31] longer how how much that little voice
[1:08:33] would tell me with just a little bit
[1:08:34] more just a little bit longer I realized
[1:08:37] that I was in bondage I wasn't happy
[1:08:39] there was no peace and I realized I was
[1:08:42] coming to a place my if I can't get away
[1:08:44] from this if I can't get out from
[1:08:46] underneath this it's going to take my
[1:08:48] very life and I remember being in a
[1:08:50] place and something inside of me cried
[1:08:52] out and said oh God whatever this is
[1:08:55] it's bigger than me and I need your help
[1:08:57] and oh Hallelujah there was a power of
[1:09:00] God that had been hanging over my life
[1:09:02] God was just waiting say the word son
[1:09:05] say the word son I have an inheritance
[1:09:07] for you say the word and when I looked
[1:09:10] up to heaven and I said oh God this is
[1:09:13] bigger than me I need your help and all
[1:09:16] of a sudden there's a power that jumped
[1:09:18] down from heaven and said you are my son
[1:09:20] I've been watching out over your life
[1:09:22] I've been keeping you you're oh my son I

[1:09:40] heart may have come down into your soul
[1:09:42] may have changed you may I make you a
[1:09:44] new creature you have been carried by
[1:09:47] the power of God
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:50] yeah when I was out in the world I
[1:09:52] thought I was somebody
[1:09:54] I thought I'd tricked the cops I thought
[1:09:56] I maneuvered out of this car wreck I
[1:10:00] thought I had I had done this guy over
[1:10:02] and I got away from all these things man
[1:10:03] and my goodness I just had it all
[1:10:05] figured out
[1:10:07] yeah
[1:10:09] and then my blind eyes got opened
[1:10:14] and I got delivered
[1:10:18] and I realized it's been the grace of
[1:10:20] God
[1:10:21] all my life
[1:10:23] it's been the grace of God there's been
[1:10:26] a power this car that car that drug this
[1:10:31] situation all the way down something was
[1:10:33] keeping me something was protecting me
[1:10:35] there was a power of God over my life
[1:10:37] because there was a word that had been
[1:10:39] spoken concerning me I had to manifest
[1:10:42] the spoken word of God and no matter how
[1:10:46] many Devils no matter how many
[1:10:47] cigarettes no matter how many times I
[1:10:50] fail no matter how many pornography
[1:10:52] demons no matter how much depression I
[1:10:54] know no matter how much suicide no
[1:10:56] matter how much the devil could throw
[1:10:58] your way there is nothing that could
[1:11:00] stop the spoken word of God coming to
[1:11:03] manifestation in you and your body and
[1:11:06] there's been a power over you that has
[1:11:08] been keeping you to the day of the
[1:11:10] manifestation of the spoken word of God
[1:11:13] oh praise the wonderful name there's a
[1:11:16] power here it's been keeping you

[1:11:49] out Debbie
[1:11:51] when Jesus Christ is around two Devils
[1:11:54] are on the Run they always are
[1:11:59] I'm talking to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:12:02] I'm talking to the word made flesh
[1:12:05] I might as well be preaching to God oh
[1:12:08] that sounds like blasphemy brother
[1:12:09] Matthew well if you're his seed
[1:12:12] if you're his offspring you can't be any
[1:12:15] League unless but him
[1:12:18] it's worth coming to word
[1:12:21] this time we own it
[1:12:24] I think it's shocking how we can own up
[1:12:26] to everything when we're out in the
[1:12:27] world
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:30] we can own up to all these mistakes
[1:12:32] we can own up to all these failures
[1:12:35] but really you can't because the blood
[1:12:36] of Jesus Christ took it
[1:12:39] you can't even own up to that anymore
[1:12:41] bring that one before
[1:12:43] Lord forgive me for are you what are you
[1:12:45] talking about
[1:12:46] nailed to the cross
[1:12:48] Lord Jesus I failed again nope you pled
[1:12:50] the blood nailed to the cross
[1:12:56] have we gotten so message five that we
[1:12:58] don't even preach the cross anymore
[1:13:00] where do you think the power came from
[1:13:03] Hallelujah because Jesus Christ took
[1:13:06] your place
[1:13:07] [Applause]
[1:13:08] a kinsman redeemer took your place
[1:13:11] because that holy God hallelujah that
[1:13:14] holy God could not dwell in a mortal
[1:13:16] body
[1:13:18] so he took sin upon his own flesh
[1:13:22] this is the fullness of redemption
[1:13:25] he's redeeming us back
[1:13:28] and he said I'll pay the penalty of sin
[1:13:32] so there I was in that condition how we
[1:13:34] ever got over here praise His name
[1:13:39] I said oh God whatever this is it's
[1:13:41] bigger than me and I need your help
[1:13:47] power of God came
[1:13:51] started to transform me
[1:13:55] and by his grace for me
[1:13:57] I say by his grace and I believe it can
[1:13:59] be for every single one of them it
[1:14:00] wasn't some drawn-out process
[1:14:03] I repented of my sins
[1:14:05] I called on the name of the Lord
[1:14:08] and he come in just a matter of minutes
[1:14:09] and transformed me by the baptism of the
[1:14:12] Holy Ghost
[1:14:14] hey I I I'm thankful that I can stand in
[1:14:17] in front of a pastor who knows I know
[1:14:19] what I'm talking about
[1:14:21] he saw the old me he saw the old life
[1:14:24] he saw what I was capable out there in
[1:14:27] the flesh
[1:14:28] but Hallelujah he could also testify of
[1:14:31] what a God of Mercy a god of compassion
[1:14:34] a god of Grace or a god of Mercy come on
[1:14:38] there ain't nothing you can do to spurn
[1:14:40] the grace of God but reject it why don't
[1:14:42] you receive the grace of God tonight
[1:14:45] quit owning up to all those things and
[1:14:47] say oh God thanks for taking my sin
[1:14:50] thanks for nailing them to Calvary
[1:14:58] that power
[1:14:59] that I thought back through all my life
[1:15:01] I realized oh my goodness
[1:15:04] I wasn't some guy who maneuvering my way
[1:15:06] out of this deal and that deal and
[1:15:09] save myself from this wreck there was a
[1:15:11] power over in my life
[1:15:13] that had been keeping me because there
[1:15:16] was a word that had to come into
[1:15:18] manifestation in my life
[1:15:21] what did Paul say
[1:15:23] the words that I speak to you
[1:15:25] they're not enticing words of man's
[1:15:27] Wisdom
[1:15:30] but he came in power and demonstration
[1:15:34] to manifest the very word that he was
[1:15:36] preaching
[1:15:37] this ain't psychology this ain't a
[1:15:39] 12-step program
[1:15:41] is saying I I think I can work it out
[1:15:43] let me go sit down with the counselor
[1:15:46] I think some of our churches need to
[1:15:48] just need to get back to Jesus's first
[1:15:50] Doctrine
[1:15:51] you must be born again
[1:15:53] why don't we just start there why don't
[1:15:55] we have a 10-week course on just get
[1:15:57] born again can we do that just just get
[1:16:00] born again
[1:16:01] just get the Holy Ghost
[1:16:03] matter of fact I think we started off
[1:16:05] the new year you must be born again and
[1:16:07] if God tarries we're going to keep it
[1:16:08] all the way until the end of the year
[1:16:10] you must be born again it doesn't stop
[1:16:13] [Applause]
[1:16:14] you want to know how to how to live an
[1:16:16] overcoming life be born again
[1:16:20] you want to know how to overcome all the
[1:16:22] Lush devils and everything that's in the
[1:16:23] world that's that's going after you be
[1:16:25] born again
[1:16:27] Acts 2 38.
[1:16:31] praised a
[1:16:33] I wanna it works
[1:16:35] it works can you believe it brother it
[1:16:39] works the word of God works repent of
[1:16:42] your sins be baptized in the name of
[1:16:44] Jesus Christ and you shall receive power
[1:16:47] from on high it'll change your thinking
[1:16:50] it'll change the way you dress it'll
[1:16:52] change the way you act you'll become a
[1:16:54] new creature all things will pass away
[1:16:57] all things I said all things will become
[1:17:01] new
[1:17:03] what is it it's the power of the Holy
[1:17:06] Ghost in your life
[1:17:09] Hallelujah
[1:17:16] hey I love the word
[1:17:18] I'm a product of it I can't help it it's
[1:17:20] everything I am and everything I could
[1:17:22] hope to be
[1:17:26] perfect Faith the church has got to lift
[1:17:28] itself in the power of God
[1:17:31] how we are told close to the end now and
[1:17:34] I believe the church is in a condition
[1:17:36] where we can teach it a little deeper
[1:17:38] things rub out some of this make-believe
[1:17:41] out yep there it is that's right prophet
[1:17:43] rub out all that make believe see and
[1:17:45] get into something real
[1:17:49] a lot of people don't like something
[1:17:50] real because you can't argue with it
[1:17:53] see it's got to be something that you
[1:17:56] know and if you say brother Branham that
[1:17:58] isn't light yet you know it's like how
[1:18:00] do you know it's like
[1:18:02] I'm looking at it
[1:18:05] well how do you know that you couldn't
[1:18:07] be wrong my sight has always declared to
[1:18:10] me that it was like see and it's the
[1:18:12] reason I believe those Vision because
[1:18:14] it's always been declared to me to be
[1:18:16] the truth because it comes from the word
[1:18:18] see then if he says it that settles it
[1:18:20] now when it's declared like that there's
[1:18:23] no more guesswork it's going to be
[1:18:27] that's what Christ the word is wanting
[1:18:29] to tell the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:30] there's no more guesswork
[1:18:34] there's no more guesswork you are my
[1:18:37] bride I have come for you
[1:18:40] I have sent a message to call you out
[1:18:42] from all of the nonsense and I am here
[1:18:45] right now with the transforming power to
[1:18:48] bring you into everything that I ever
[1:18:50] promised you and no fault and no failure
[1:18:53] and no complex and no disease and no
[1:18:56] sickness and no bad attitudes and
[1:18:58] nothing that you've ever done and no
[1:19:00] devil and no neighbor and no family no
[1:19:02] school nothing out there is ever going
[1:19:04] to stop you from becoming when I told
[1:19:07] you that you're going to be just keep
[1:19:09] walking just keep believing just keep
[1:19:11] trusting just keep going on and on and
[1:19:15] as you go on and on you can't ever beat
[1:19:17] your type Church you're just like Enoch
[1:19:20] just keep walking one foot in front of
[1:19:22] the other get back up and one day one
[1:19:25] step after another step you're going to
[1:19:26] be gone
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:28] it's gonna happen
[1:19:31] with everything that's in me church it's
[1:19:33] going to happen and I believe I'm
[1:19:35] looking at the group of people
[1:19:36] hallelujah that will be able to sit back
[1:19:40] and say oh death
[1:19:41] oh great where is your Victory oh death
[1:19:45] where is your sting and you'll look
[1:19:47] around and all of a sudden your your
[1:19:50] hands are going to change you'll see
[1:19:52] your loved one come through the door and
[1:19:54] all of a sudden you'll go and say
[1:19:55] brother Aaron it's hard brother Tim it's
[1:19:58] all just keep going church because
[1:20:00] there's a power that is carrying you
[1:20:02] right into the manifestation of that
[1:20:04] prophecy
[1:20:06] I believe it
[1:20:07] [Applause]
[1:20:14] then if he says it that settles it
[1:20:17] when it's declared like that there's no
[1:20:19] more guesswork
[1:20:21] now we're talking about revelation
[1:20:25] if you can pray for anything church pray
[1:20:27] for revelation
[1:20:28] because when it's revealed to you like
[1:20:30] that
[1:20:32] when it's revealed to you like that
[1:20:35] how many people in here can I talk out
[1:20:37] of that this is a piano
[1:20:40] can I talk you out of anybody is there a
[1:20:43] chance
[1:20:45] now maybe if I started to get some
[1:20:47] people
[1:20:48] maybe if I got some fine orator well
[1:20:51] actually this isn't a piano it was in
[1:20:53] the 1400s they actually changed my name
[1:20:55] from p a no
[1:20:58] to piano and it's really not a piano
[1:21:00] it's a piano oh
[1:21:02] so you've been calling it wrong all your
[1:21:04] life this really and all of a sudden
[1:21:05] some guy would give you some
[1:21:06] intellectual understanding and you're
[1:21:08] like oh man I've been wrong all my life
[1:21:13] I feel like that's how easy it is for
[1:21:16] the devil to talk you off of your
[1:21:17] promise
[1:21:20] he just mixes a little past remixes a
[1:21:23] little attitude mixes a little look from
[1:21:25] one of the young people and all of a
[1:21:26] sudden everything that's been swollen in
[1:21:28] your head yeah it all adds up I'm not
[1:21:30] supposed to be here
[1:21:32] I knew it I'm not bride
[1:21:35] but when it's revealed to you like that
[1:21:38] there's no more guesswork then it
[1:21:40] doesn't matter how many people
[1:21:43] how many churches
[1:21:46] how many people say this no matter even
[1:21:48] how many times you fail
[1:21:50] there's something in you that knows
[1:21:52] Beyond of a shadow of a doubt that I am
[1:21:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:57] and you come to a place like Peterson
[1:22:00] will you go also
[1:22:04] where else am I going to go Lord
[1:22:07] tell me
[1:22:08] you got something better for me
[1:22:11] you're going to walk away from this
[1:22:12] message and then what do you what are
[1:22:14] you going to give me in place I just
[1:22:15] want to ask you

[1:22:23] no hope at all I was going to be in
[1:22:24] prison probably for a very long time I
[1:22:26] was in addictions and drugs
[1:22:29] the power of God by promise got a hold
[1:22:31] of my life because there was a power
[1:22:33] over me
[1:22:34] transformed and changed my life and as I
[1:22:36] listened to the message of the hour I
[1:22:38] started to realize who I really was in
[1:22:41] Christ
[1:22:42] started to reveal to me precious
[1:22:44] promises cleaned my life up gave me the
[1:22:47] Holy Ghost now I have the spirit of

[1:25:51] reservations in heaven
[1:25:53] oh Hallelujah now we're talking about
[1:25:55] power
[1:25:57] when you know who you are
[1:25:59] when you recognize what you're a part of
[1:26:01] you know there's power in that
[1:26:02] [Applause]
[1:26:03] you don't know who you are and what
[1:26:05] you're a part of can you imagine not
[1:26:07] knowing who your husband is
[1:26:08] you never asked for anything
[1:26:12] it reminds me of that story I don't know
[1:26:14] if I can tell it
[1:26:15] but there was a story about a a king
[1:26:17] that was all these people yeah I believe
[1:26:19] maybe we all heard it hey they're all
[1:26:22] coming through and asking for all these
[1:26:24] little things
[1:26:25] give me some chickens and give me some
[1:26:27] of this and give me some of that and
[1:26:29] make this or that right and finally this
[1:26:30] guy comes through and says hey well what
[1:26:32] would you like you know I would like a 5
[1:26:36] 000 acres of land I'd like a dowry for
[1:26:38] all of my kids pay for their education I
[1:26:40] like you to pay for off all of my debt
[1:26:41] I'd like a four horses and and 100
[1:26:44] auctions and all these things and it
[1:26:47] gets done making all these requests
[1:26:50] you know
[1:26:52] and he says granted
[1:26:55] and and his right hand man was looking
[1:26:57] at him as he walked off said
[1:26:59] Lord King
[1:27:01] why in the world
[1:27:03] all these other people just came for and
[1:27:05] asked for you for reasonable things
[1:27:08] that that were not too hard for you to
[1:27:10] give
[1:27:12] and here this guy came and asked for all
[1:27:14] of these big things
[1:27:16] and you gave it to him why would you do
[1:27:18] that he looked over at him and said well
[1:27:20] because finally somebody asked me
[1:27:24] for something that only a king would
[1:27:27] give
[1:27:28] well I think I might just be dumb enough
[1:27:32] to know that I serve the god of Heaven
[1:27:35] who owes a cattle on a thousand hills I
[1:27:38] think I just start asking them I'll ask
[1:27:40] them for the Holy Ghost I'll ask them
[1:27:42] for prodigal son I'll ask him for the
[1:27:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll ask him
[1:27:47] for signs and wonders I'll ask him for
[1:27:49] people to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:51] I'll ask him for a four-year-old and
[1:27:53] five-year-olds to get born again I'm
[1:27:56] gonna ask for it all why because only a
[1:27:58] king to give what I'm asking for and
[1:28:01] there is a power here to enforce the
[1:28:04] word of God why don't you start asking
[1:28:06] for your particle songs for your
[1:28:08] political daughters for all of those
[1:28:09] loved ones that you've got out there if
[1:28:11] you need healing in your body there's a
[1:28:13] power here to bring forth the word of
[1:28:15] God in an atmosphere like this with
[1:28:17] Jesus Christ walking up and down the
[1:28:19] aisle why don't you reach out and say oh
[1:28:22] God here I am
[1:28:23] I receive you o God hallelujah
[1:28:28] praise His wonderful man
[1:28:31] praise this wonderful name hoping to
[1:28:34] possible don't let this moment pass you
[1:28:36] by this is the supernatural this is the
[1:28:40] power this is what's carrying you to
[1:28:42] your bridegroom
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:46] why don't why he's near
[1:28:48] why don't you ask for that big thing
[1:28:50] you've been praying about
[1:28:52] matter of fact while the power's there
[1:28:54] why don't you speak it out and let them
[1:28:56] hear it all right
[1:28:59] the word is 90.
[1:29:02] even in the heart and where else
[1:29:05] in your mouth it's time to take what's
[1:29:07] in the heart
[1:29:09] if your heart has been restored take the
[1:29:12] restored word of God and put it on your
[1:29:14] lips and start speaking
[1:29:17] start speaking the word of God and watch
[1:29:20] that word materialize
[1:29:22] why because this is the hour of the
[1:29:25] manifestations of Sons and Daughters of
[1:29:28] God that can speak the word why because
[1:29:31] you've been restored back before the
[1:29:33] fall
[1:29:34] what are you saying by the way we've
[1:29:36] been restored back before sin
[1:29:38] [Applause]
[1:29:41] why because my God
[1:29:43] is a kinsman redeemer
[1:29:47] redeeming you back to where
[1:29:50] did he take you back to
[1:29:53] back to where it all started
[1:29:55] back before man ever messed anything up
[1:29:58] that's where he's taken us back to we're
[1:30:01] just waiting for this body to catch up
[1:30:03] but even now you are seated in Heavenly
[1:30:07] places in Christ Jesus your soul always
[1:30:10] already been raptured in Christ Jesus
[1:30:14] I'm just waiting for this body to catch
[1:30:16] up hurry up your bag of bones
[1:30:19] why do you think it's such a struggle
[1:30:23] why do you think it's such a struggle to
[1:30:25] get to church
[1:30:26] why do you think it's such a struggle on
[1:30:28] a daily
[1:30:29] huh
[1:30:31] because this ain't Who You Are
[1:30:35] some of the most basic things we forget
[1:30:39] it won't take me long because I want to
[1:30:41] let you know this might surprise some
[1:30:42] people
[1:30:43] my worst enemy is here
[1:30:49] I'm sorry I hope that might be shocking
[1:30:52] I'm gonna make a little bit more
[1:30:53] shocking and he's he's not down there
[1:30:57] yes he's on the platform yeah yeah now
[1:31:00] some people are doing math
[1:31:01] it's not him so there's only two of them
[1:31:03] I'm confused
[1:31:06] I Am My Own Worst Enemy
[1:31:11] and when you've been born again
[1:31:14] and you've been filled with the Holy
[1:31:15] Ghost
[1:31:17] the old nature that old husband that's
[1:31:20] dead
[1:31:21] and that's died that's why why Paul said
[1:31:23] I Die daily because there's an old
[1:31:25] nature that's following you around
[1:31:28] and it's wanting to take back the place
[1:31:30] of influence in your life
[1:31:32] it's trying to point to your past or
[1:31:34] trying to point to things that remind
[1:31:36] you or when you drive down this block or
[1:31:38] you go down there all of a sudden that
[1:31:40] feeling and that emotion comes back over
[1:31:42] you and you feel like you'll never be
[1:31:43] able to escape it and you feel like it's
[1:31:45] following you all of your life that's an
[1:31:47] old nature that's trying to take you
[1:31:49] back into the life that you come out of
[1:31:52] that's not who you are that's not your
[1:31:55] identification your identification is
[1:31:57] the word of God so it's in those times
[1:31:59] and in those moments you got to do
[1:32:02] battle with the devil and with that old
[1:32:04] selfie you say no I ain't giving in this
[1:32:06] time you got me last time you got me ten
[1:32:09] times 20 times a million times in a row
[1:32:11] but you know what I'm finally sick and
[1:32:12] tired of it that is not who I am and I'm
[1:32:15] going to call on the god of Heaven the
[1:32:17] king of Heaven who I have an inheritance
[1:32:20] from and knowing that there's a power
[1:32:21] over my life and I'm going to defeat
[1:32:23] this devil once and for all
[1:32:26] it's time Church
[1:32:28] it's time we start being what God has
[1:32:30] made us to be
[1:32:36] he goes on to say then if he says it
[1:32:38] that settles it when it's declared like
[1:32:41] that there's no more guesswork
[1:32:43] it's going to be
[1:32:45] then you hear it thus saith the Lord
[1:32:47] because it's beyond human thinking it's
[1:32:50] up into the Realms of the Lord's
[1:32:52] thinking
[1:32:53] let this mind be in you
[1:32:56] which was also in Christ Jesus who
[1:32:58] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:33:00] God yes let that mind
[1:33:03] let that mind be in you
[1:33:05] matter of fact once again that's not a
[1:33:07] that's not a request
[1:33:09] he's saying I am going to have a bride
[1:33:11] of Jesus Christ with the very mind that
[1:33:14] he had that thought about robbery to be
[1:33:17] equal with God because they are my very
[1:33:19] attributes that are being manifested
[1:33:23] by very seed word that's being
[1:33:25] manifested
[1:33:28] so we're up in the Lord's thinking we
[1:33:31] want to go beyond make-believing going
[1:33:32] Beyond impersonations go beyond
[1:33:35] secondhand Revelation moving past all of
[1:33:37] these things
[1:33:39] we want to be living where it's the
[1:33:41] spirit and the word and the power of God
[1:33:43] is moving in our lives and that's the
[1:33:45] very thing that's in our influence
[1:33:47] that's the very thing that's making us
[1:33:49] real sons and daughters of God
[1:33:53] we'll work towards a close quickly
[1:33:57] how many is happy to be in the house of
[1:33:59] God
[1:34:02] by his grace will just try to end along
[1:34:04] these lines
[1:34:08] something that was on my heart is
[1:34:10] speaking about the power of God we know
[1:34:12] that uh we'll just move through this
[1:34:14] quickly so we can get to a close but we
[1:34:16] know as the prophet of God would start
[1:34:18] to minister uh the Seven Seals and he
[1:34:20] would talk about the horse rider and
[1:34:22] he'd talk about powers that would go out
[1:34:23] and and he would he would identify the
[1:34:25] horse riders the White Horse Rider red
[1:34:27] black and pale horse rider and he would
[1:34:30] show how that a beast represents power
[1:34:31] and he'd start to talk about how in
[1:34:34] Daniel when he saw a vision or a dream
[1:34:35] and you see the bear and the goat and a
[1:34:38] lion with teeth you'd show that that all
[1:34:39] represents a power but he said whenever
[1:34:42] the Antichrist Spirit would ride out as
[1:34:44] a power God would send another power to
[1:34:47] combat that
[1:34:49] right so when the enemy comes in like a
[1:34:51] flood the spirit of God would raise up a
[1:34:53] standard to combat that Antichrist
[1:34:56] spirit so you would see in the Bible
[1:34:58] these symbols or this power going forth
[1:35:00] but God always had a power to combat the
[1:35:03] Antichrist Spirits are just in the
[1:35:05] Realms of speaking of these symbols and
[1:35:07] Powers he's showing how that it would
[1:35:09] represent Nations and it would represent
[1:35:10] uh uh the powers of the Antichrist and
[1:35:13] he would say this in the fifth seal he'd
[1:35:15] say it also represents a holy power too
[1:35:18] Beast did you know that Rebecca uh when
[1:35:21] the servant of Abraham Elisha when he
[1:35:24] came to get Rebecca he mounted her upon
[1:35:26] a camel the very camel she watered as
[1:35:29] she rode this camel to meet her unseen
[1:35:31] bridegroom the very thing that she
[1:35:33] watered when the thing that took her to
[1:35:36] her future home and husband it's the
[1:35:39] same thing today
[1:35:41] the very thing that the church is
[1:35:43] watering
[1:35:45] that is the seed the seed of the word
[1:35:47] it's the very word that becomes alive
[1:35:50] and Carries us to our unseen bridegroom
[1:35:54] the very power look at that church the
[1:35:57] very power that was carrying Rebecca
[1:35:59] look it came to a place where she had
[1:36:01] heard the the message
[1:36:03] she and Eliza came and said look this is
[1:36:06] the message I I want to go ahead and
[1:36:08] take you to meet your your bridegroom
[1:36:11] but then then Rebecca had to get up on a
[1:36:14] pond that Camel which the prophet of God
[1:36:16] saying which represented a power she had
[1:36:19] to get on that power and it was going to
[1:36:21] be that power that was going to carry
[1:36:23] her to her bridegroom and he says it's
[1:36:26] the same thing today the very thing that
[1:36:28] the church is watering that is the seed
[1:36:31] the seed of the word it's the very word
[1:36:33] that becomes alive and Carries us to our
[1:36:36] unseen bridegroom oh I'm so thankful
[1:36:38] that there is a spirit of God there is a
[1:36:41] power that has been poured out upon the
[1:36:43] Bride of Jesus Christ that has combated
[1:36:46] that Antichrist spirit and it's exposed
[1:36:49] him for who he was and all of those
[1:36:51] things and now it's revealing to the
[1:36:52] Bride of Jesus Christ who she is in the
[1:36:55] word and the spirit is the very power
[1:36:57] that is now packing you into the
[1:37:00] presence of God I don't want to get off
[1:37:02] of that Camel I don't want to come out
[1:37:04] from underneath that power I want that
[1:37:06] power of God oh just wash over my life
[1:37:09] oh God just take me apprehend me Lord
[1:37:11] take me to my bridegroom take me to my
[1:37:14] body change there's a power that I know
[1:37:16] that is carrying me into another
[1:37:17] dimension
[1:37:20] for we know the scripture would say like
[1:37:22] this in Ephesians 6 12 it says for we
[1:37:24] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:37:26] against principalities against powers
[1:37:29] and rulers of Darkness of this world
[1:37:31] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:37:33] places
[1:37:37] so now we see the effects of the world
[1:37:40] I mean I don't know if you got to go too
[1:37:42] far
[1:37:43] if you need any help go to Walmart
[1:37:46] be a good start
[1:37:48] if you dare go to the mall
[1:37:51] fellowship with the brother is telling
[1:37:53] them about when I go to the mall how
[1:37:54] tired I am he's like yeah I wonder why
[1:37:55] that is I'm like well
[1:37:57] it's because the spiritual warfare he's
[1:37:59] like I never thought about that I'm like
[1:38:00] yeah
[1:38:01] you're doing battle up in that place man
[1:38:04] go go look go you go around you go to
[1:38:07] the ball you go to these places and you
[1:38:08] see everywhere there is a power so I
[1:38:11] just maybe for a quick moment we will
[1:38:13] just look at the negative real quick and
[1:38:15] by the help of God we'll turn it right
[1:38:16] back around and come to a close
[1:38:19] foreign
[1:38:20] but we know in Isaiah
[1:38:24] 60 he would talk about a gross Darkness
[1:38:26] upon the people
[1:38:31] and Jesus would say this in Mark 13 20
[1:38:34] except except the Lord had shortened
[1:38:36] those days no flesh would be saved
[1:38:40] and I always wondered about that how
[1:38:41] would that come
[1:38:43] how could it get so bad that no flesh
[1:38:45] what would that look like we are seeing
[1:38:47] that
[1:38:49] and so I just want to read this quote
[1:38:53] the voice of the sign he says God will
[1:38:55] build his church upon the foundation of
[1:38:57] Jesus Christ and that's the Bible
[1:38:59] outside of that all other ground is
[1:39:00] sinking Sands God doesn't change his
[1:39:03] nature doesn't change he made women
[1:39:05] different from men and men different
[1:39:07] from women he dressed them different he
[1:39:09] wants them to stay that way see women
[1:39:11] wants to look like men and men wants to
[1:39:13] look like women oh my such perversion
[1:39:15] and the whole thing looked like it's got
[1:39:18] a grip on the people
[1:39:19] and you can't change it
[1:39:22] looks like a great monster
[1:39:25] a great blackness
[1:39:27] if you understand what I'm speaking of
[1:39:30] in the spirit a monster has grabbed them
[1:39:34] a monster has got them grabbed they just
[1:39:38] can't get away from it
[1:39:42] too much Hollywood
[1:39:44] too much television
[1:39:46] too much other nonsense everything we
[1:39:49] got is polluted no wonder if the work
[1:39:52] isn't cut short for the elected's sake
[1:39:55] there will be no flesh saved
[1:40:00] a monster has got them grabbed
[1:40:04] what are you talking about prophet
[1:40:06] what do you mean a monster has got the
[1:40:09] people grabbed and they can't get away
[1:40:10] from it
[1:40:12] well I think I'm starting to see what
[1:40:15] the prophet was talking about
[1:40:17] where I read in the news the other day a
[1:40:19] 10 year old
[1:40:21] shot his mom because she wouldn't buy
[1:40:23] him a video game
[1:40:25] what would make a 10 year old do that
[1:40:29] a monster
[1:40:31] a gross darkness that has pressed into
[1:40:35] the people
[1:40:37] and has grabbed them
[1:40:40] too much nonsense
[1:40:42] too much Hollywood
[1:40:44] too much television
[1:40:47] no it doesn't stop there I've noticed a
[1:40:49] pattern
[1:40:51] he used to be 14 12.
[1:40:54] 11.
[1:40:56] now 10.
[1:40:57] and now I look in the news and a
[1:41:00] six-year-old
[1:41:01] took a gun to school
[1:41:04] and shot their teacher
[1:41:08] and I started to say oh Lord now I see
[1:41:12] I I see the gross Darkness a monster has
[1:41:15] got them grabbed and if the days weren't
[1:41:17] shortened for the election no flesh
[1:41:19] would get saved
[1:41:22] but then I started to get encouraged
[1:41:24] I started to think
[1:41:26] if a monster of Darkness
[1:41:29] can grab a 10 year old
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:30] [Applause]
[1:41:32] if a monster of Darkness couldn't grab a
[1:41:34] six-year-old
[1:41:36] I got to think and there's a power
[1:41:39] there's another Power outside of
[1:41:41] brightness
[1:41:42] there's the power of my dog and if the
[1:41:46] devil can grab a 10 year old if he can
[1:41:49] grab a six-year-old then my God can grab
[1:41:52] a four-year-old a five-year-old a
[1:41:54] six-year-old and fill him with the Holy
[1:41:56] Ghost come on young people where are you

[1:42:01] thank young children like this and fill
[1:42:03] it with the Holy ghosts all preachers

[1:44:11] ain't got another wait another night to
[1:44:12] feed a liver
[1:44:13] come on
[1:44:15] William right here let God speak to
[1:44:17] somebody
[1:44:19] the prophet of God said you who don't
[1:44:23] have the Holy Ghost
[1:44:25] and don't know nothing about it
[1:44:30] you don't know nothing about it
[1:44:33] but something in your heart is telling
[1:44:35] you
[1:44:37] that you want it
[1:44:39] now listen to who the prophet of God you
[1:44:41] say oh it's never for me it's never
[1:44:43] going to be for me I can never do it
[1:44:44] I've done all these things Listen to Who
[1:44:46] the messenger of the age is speaking to
[1:44:48] somebody without the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:51] doesn't know anything about it
[1:44:53] well I was a good candidate one day
[1:44:56] I didn't know anything about it and I
[1:44:58] didn't have it
[1:44:59] so maybe God's talking to somebody right
[1:45:01] now don't escape this moment
[1:45:05] you don't have the Holy Ghost and you
[1:45:07] don't know nothing about it but
[1:45:08] something in your heart is telling you
[1:45:10] you want it
[1:45:12] that's eternal life
[1:45:16] that's your inheritance
[1:45:20] you mean I don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:45:22] and I don't know nothing about it
[1:45:24] but since there's something in my heart
[1:45:27] that wants it regardless of how bad I've
[1:45:30] been and how far that sin has taken me
[1:45:32] but just because something inside of me
[1:45:34] says I want it I I don't I look at my
[1:45:37] past I look at my life but hear the
[1:45:38] voice of God is saying you don't have
[1:45:40] the Holy Ghost you don't know anything
[1:45:42] about it but oh there's something inside
[1:45:44] of you what is it there's been a power
[1:45:46] of God that's been looking out over your
[1:45:48] life that has carried you to this
[1:45:50] service tonight and now he's telling you
[1:45:52] it doesn't matter if you don't have the
[1:45:54] Holy Ghost if you don't know nothing
[1:45:56] about it it doesn't matter how far sin
[1:45:58] is taking you but it's something in your
[1:46:00] heart is saying you want God God is here
[1:46:03] to open the floodgates of Heaven to you
[1:46:04] that is your inheritance that's eternal
[1:46:08] life calling to you oh praise this
[1:46:10] wonderful name he said Hallelujah
[1:46:14] he said that's eternal life that's your
[1:46:17] inheritance
[1:46:21] [Music]
[1:46:23] I got the quote right here praise the
[1:46:24] Lord
[1:46:27] he said stay right there and look Satan
[1:46:29] right in the face
[1:46:31] you mean you ain't got to be a born
[1:46:32] again filled with the holy ghost son and
[1:46:34] daughter to do this
[1:46:35] not according to a Vindicated prophet
[1:46:39] you cannot have the Holy Ghost and know
[1:46:41] anything about it well why is that
[1:46:43] brother Tim
[1:46:45] because you're a son of God
[1:46:48] the new birth doesn't make you a son
[1:46:50] [Applause]
[1:46:54] you always were a son or a daughter
[1:46:58] therefore you can be reborn
[1:47:01] so even though you're in this condition
[1:47:03] God has given you a pass to say hey go
[1:47:07] ahead and speak like you're my son I'm
[1:47:08] going to cheat
[1:47:10] I'm going to give you a little cheat
[1:47:11] code here
[1:47:18] you look Satan right in the face and you
[1:47:20] say you are the robber
[1:47:22] you are the one
[1:47:24] I've come to possess what Jesus Christ
[1:47:27] died for me to have
[1:47:29] and now hand it back
[1:47:31] get out of my way
[1:47:37] that's for somebody here and go ahead
[1:47:39] and do it
[1:47:40] look that old devil in the face that's
[1:47:42] been telling you you'll never add up you
[1:47:44] can never live a Victorious Life you've
[1:47:46] done run too many times you've gone too
[1:47:48] far it's never going to happen
[1:47:51] right now you look that old devil in the
[1:47:54] face and say you are the robber you are
[1:47:56] the one I've come tonight in the name of
[1:47:58] Jesus Christ to possess what he died for
[1:48:01] me to have now you hand it back get out
[1:48:04] of my way and then the first thing you
[1:48:06] know
[1:48:08] the Holy Ghost will pour upon you then
[1:48:12] something happens praise the Lord I
[1:48:15] think something is about to happen in
[1:48:18] the house of God tonight because
[1:48:20] somebody is sick and tired of that old
[1:48:23] Temple robbing you of all of your
[1:48:26] blessings with that old devil in the
[1:48:28] face and say old Kevin I am sick and

[1:49:31] been a power over your life

[1:51:48] came over the loudspeaker and said this
[1:51:50] is not a drill there's a gun
[1:51:53] in the building
[1:51:54] and everybody started going every
[1:51:56] direction
[1:51:57] little Matthew he was in fifth grade
[1:52:00] leave just 10 11 years old
[1:52:03] and everybody ran and they they this is
[1:52:06] not a drill get to your place get to
[1:52:07] your place and everybody was ran and all
[1:52:10] there was all this fear and everything
[1:52:11] and they got into the classroom and
[1:52:14] everybody was looking to hide this way
[1:52:16] in that way and they barred the doors
[1:52:18] and little Matthew you know just being
[1:52:19] 10 years old fear was coming over him
[1:52:22] and he was wondering what he's going to
[1:52:23] do and then he said but then
