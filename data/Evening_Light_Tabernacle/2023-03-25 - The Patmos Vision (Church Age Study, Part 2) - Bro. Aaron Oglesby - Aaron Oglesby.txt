him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this gathering tonight Lord I just pray that as we gather together Lord that it won't be meaningless Lord but that you will come now and in order to be more than just a as it were a Sunday school lesson Lord a review of of information but Lord allow us Lord to to let the Holy Spirit Come and anoint allow us to step out of the way and you to loose my tongue Lord that that you Lord could speak tonight and and reveal yourself to these individuals Lord in their own life Lord as we learned last time in our study that it takes Revelation so lord of the all the knowledge and all the things I could say or or in part Lord would do nothing unless it's revealed to the hearts of your people tonight so I'm asking that you'll take control now that you'll speak that you'll open eyes and that Lord something said tonight Lord by your spirit can be life-changing father we ask you to come now and take complete control of this service in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles with you tonight we're gonna start off by reading in the Book of Revelation the first chapter we'll start reading with the ninth verse and and this portion of the church age that we had asked you to read the second chapter the Patmos Vision it covered chapter one of the Book of Revelation verse verse 9 through 20. and um and what we're going to read those verses individually as we go along and this portion of scripture what we're going to find is in these verses 9-20 John is going to by the spirit see the Lord's day he's going to see the Lord's Day by his spirit and he's going to get a glimpse of the Lord Jesus and I pray tonight that we can get a glimpse of him for ourselves tonight and and John gives us an incredible description of what it is that he sees and a large part of this that we're going to look at tonight is what we might would call maybe heavy material to those that haven't found their place in Jesus if you find yourself outside of Salvation tonight some of this would seem heavy and almost scary but but but you don't have to stay in that situation tonight if that's where you find yourself you don't have to meet him in your current condition he offers to you tonight that you can come and lay your burdens down and he will meet you he'll meet you right here but tonight I want to declare to you that even though we're going to see him a lot as judge he's not your judge tonight tonight he is still your intercessor tonight he's still your high priest tonight he is still the atonement and he's here to stand on your behalf but we're going to find as we go along that that will not always be the case so we're going to read here in in Revelation one and nine and it says I John who also am your brother and companion and tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats tonight he says I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation what he's saying is as I'm partaking in the same troubles and the same trials and the same struggles that the church themselves are going through on a daily basis if I can get this thing to change I'd be fantastic oh I got to point it up there that's good to know he says I'm a brother in Tribulation and he addresses himself to the to the Christians as a brother and so what is a a state or a tribulation is a state of great trouble and again and of great suffering what he's saying is yes the church is going through these things but it's not just you I want you to know that I'm in the middle of these same trials you're not in this alone and that's something that the enemy likes to do is anytime you're in Trials or you're in Tribulation he makes you think well you're the only one going through this you're the only one suffering but John's letting them know Hey listen I'm a brother in these tribulations I'm a brother in these trials the same things that you're facing I'm facing and the church at this time that this is rep The Book of Revelation is written is going through some incredible trials and tribulations it's not working the first persecution with government backing begins under under Nero in in the year 64 A.D and then the second persecution over the mission begins in 80 81 and that is the the the persecution that we're dealing with here this is the person who had John put on the Isle of Patmos and he himself was known to be um inclined to Cruelty he had his own Brothers all wiped out so that they wouldn't have an opportunity to come to the throne he had many Roman Senators killed some because they stood up against his policies some because he just wanted their home and their estate and things of that nature so he was one of these Emperors that was greatly inclined to Cruelty and he passed a saying that no Christian once brought before the tribunal should be Exempted from punishment without renouncing his religion so once you came and stood before the Judgment seat as it were were you had no other choice but to renounce your religion or else face death if you did anything to bring yourself before them you had to renounce your religion and it was during this time that that a variety of fabricated Tales were were during his Reign composed in order to injure the Christians in other words if there was a a famine or there was a pestilence or there was an earthquake it was always laid upon the Christians these things happened because of the Christians and that's kind of how the pagans would operate because they would always place things upon their gods per se if there was a bad storm then to see God was angry because somebody did something wrong but in this case they began to lay everything at the feet of the Christians in order to justify the persecution that they were carrying out upon the Believers so at this time Christianity was everywhere spoken against I want to remind you that yes we have trials and yes we have tribulations and we Face different battles we spoke about that in a service recently that we're going to have our battles we're going to face our battles but we'll never face the the type of persecutions and the thing that that they face daily they were being imprisoned daily they were being persecuted they were being crucified they were being burned they were being torn asunder they were made to face wild beasts all for the testimony of Jesus Christ of course John himself we know if you read it in the church age book they boil him in oil for 24 hours and it says the whole time that they're boiling him trying to kill him he's preaching to him can you imagine what that must have been like to those people you'd think that it would open their eyes you'd think they would recognize a supernatural element there you would think it would bring a repentance but actually what it does is it enrages them so much that they say he's only able to do this because he's a witch so at this point they accuse him of being a witch in the and they sentence him to the Isle of Patmos now the Iowa Patmos is about 13.8 square miles and John stays here until sometime after the death of domitian when he is allowed to return to Ephesus where he will actually end up living out his days but at this time the Isle of Patmos is used as a prison Colony for the Roman Empire it is Rocky it is full of snakes it is full of lizards and scorpions and it has no infrastructure in other words you may see it today and you may say oh well that's a that's a nice looking little island but there was absolutely nothing there there was no way to shelter yourself there was no way to take care of yourself there was no way to feed yourself it was like being in a prison to a point it was a death sentence in and of itself and and so he's there and I want to show you on the map I showed you this map last time but if you'll look this is Asia Minor and we can see the seven churches Ephesus Smyrna pergament the Tyrus artist Philadelphia and laodicea and if you'll look out to the left you will see Patmos it's the little red dot that's in the ocean that's where Patmos was and it was it was off the coast of Asia Minor and I was watching a little clip today of them doing a tour there and they say on a clear day John would have been able to actually see the mainland now if I see it it would have probably just been a little line off in the water somewhere but on a clear day he actually could have seen the mainland now I want you to understand that even though this picture here doesn't look so bad you look at that and you're like that's not so bad but there was nothing there yes there's a little bit of grass but underneath that is absolute Solid Rock it's very dry there's no opportunity to grow things this was not a vacation they didn't send their worst prisoners to a place because it was a fun place to go okay this this was an actual a terrible place to be just to give you an idea about the size of this island it was about the size of Minden I looked up the square miles of Minden and it's about one square mile bigger than the Isle of Patmos was about the size of men and today it's actually a a pilgrimage spot meaning lots of Christians love to go there because it was the place where John was and there's actually a cave there that they claim is the cave of Revelation where John was when he received the visions and wrote the books and things of that nature of course we don't know this but you can actually take cruise ships to Port there and get off and have a good time John didn't go on a cruise ship John went on a prisonership this wasn't a fun thing I want you to understand the level of peril he was in not only in getting there but in staying there he was uncomfortable he was miserable their their whole point of this was this was an absolute punishment for what he believed in back then it was totally desolate nothing but snakes scorpions lizards and other prisoners who by the way probably didn't like you very much either it's not like you had your friends there this was not a camping trip so during this time he's on the island are y'all changing this or am I doing it so this isn't working at all so during this time that he's on the island it's around 80 95 to 96. we don't know exactly when he got there when he left but the visions that John received that are written down in the Book of Revelation that we're talking about tonight come to him over a over a two-year period all right and and and it was written out in a book of symbols and man has studied these symbols ever since that he wrote them every denomination has studied these symbols every Theologian has studied these symbols they've been looked at from every angle imaginable and from every angle what we get is a thousand or ten thousand ideas of what they meant you had nowhere to place your faith you didn't know which one was right what did it mean or did it really matter and you have to believe that if God saw fit for this to be in his holy Bible then yes these things really mattered and God intended for a people to know what these things were and so I'm so thankful that in this day there's no longer that we have to look at and prod at it and wonder about and what is it what is it but in this day in the days of the voice of the seventh angel there is a prophetic class of people who under their Church age messenger have received the revelation of these visions that was written in this book it's no longer a mystery to you and I and that should that should give us great joy and to know that God thought enough that he said I'm not going to let them go through blind I'm not going to let them go through in darkness but they will have understanding they will have Revelation they're going to know what it is I'm doing in the last day and not only that but he's privileged US to know what he's done all down Through the Ages so it's just not what he's doing and what he's going to do but for the first time there's a people who can look back and know exactly what it was and how God was moving down through the church ages it was in this day that he tears the cover off of the apocalypse and it actually becomes revealed to a people so you're no longer standing on I hope so you're no longer standing on I hope this is right where my church says this is right but you are standing on revealed word tonight you were standing on revealed truths you don't have to wonder about it this is the truth it has been revealed it has been Vindicated and God has come and put his stamp upon it brother Branham says the entire book is set forth in symbols and therefore it is the target of much criticism and dispute however it does have the seal upon a seal of God upon it that makes it authentic if you want to be authentic tonight get the Seal of God upon your life if you want to be authentic and you know sometimes we worry about what this thinks and who this thinks and who am I and what's this hey he says it has the Seal of God upon it so that makes it authentic I believe that we're an authentic people tonight so this covers where John was and during this time and what he was writing and we'll move to the next slide Revelation 1 and 10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet in the spirit you might as well go ahead and pull them all up because it's a battery on this thing low it's going to help me if I can control this I am controlling it now what's happening yeah we're gonna get this workout okay well awesome in the spirit brother Branham says you could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life if we are going to live as Christians we have to be in his Spirit brother Branham says that the first step in anything you do the first step is to get in the spirit I would like to say I think that I'll speak for myself but many times it's just as humans we allow too many things to hinder us from getting in the spirit whether it be at home whether it be at work but let's specifically look at it as it relates to to a church service if John managed to get in the spirit in the middle of a bunch of murderers if John managed to get in the spirit I don't think the sound system on the Isle of Patmos was exactly right his clicker probably wasn't working that day when he was trying to get the apocalypse written down there was probably all kind of confusing to go along with the Scorpions and the snakes and things bothering and yet John managed to get into the spirit when we come to church I want us to just push aside all the little things that bother us push aside what happened at work what happened at school what happened at home with Mama who's playing music who's not playing who sang a song I don't like him leading singing what is that compared to where John was just push through all those things and manage to get yourself in the spirit brother Brown says that's the first step get in the spirit Paul says I will pray in the spirit I will sing in the spirit I will live in the spirit I say today with all that's been opened up to us we have no excuse to not be in the spirit when we gather together with other believers with other people of light precious faith and we've been blessed with this wonderful building and we have wonderful singing wonderful music wonderful preaching everything sets up well for us let's be honest we don't exactly have hardships as it's related to church we are blessed beyond measure don't get spoiled by it but come in and say Lord today I'm going to press in today I'm going to press through today I'm going to get past all my describes distract distractions I'm gonna get that word out and I'm gonna get in the spirit amen brother Branham says have you ever noticed how the world gets in the spirit of things that are in the world he says they go to their ball games their sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it now look I'm I'm just like everybody else I don't want to come in and just make things happen I want to come in and move in the spirit because the spirit's moving however we've made it very clear before you've got to give the spirit something to anoint it's called a sacrifice of praise it's not always just going to be everything's flowing so perfect these people he says they enter into the spirit notice he didn't say the spirit of it gets on them he didn't say the spirit of the ball game gets on him he says they just enter right on into it they choose to make the ball game loud they choose to yell and scream they choose to be excited they enter into the spirit now what's the opposite of that they don't sit there like Wallflowers an old dried up sticks so I'm just going to make a a little conclusion here that you can't be in the spirit regardless of what you call the spirit you can't be in the spirit if you're sitting like a Wallflower like an old dried up stick he goes on to say they enter right into the field of things about sometimes you can feel it they enter into it and they just feel it they create the feeling they create the excitement but we're not he says they enter into the field of things and become a part of things listen he's literally using this as an example of what you should do he says if they can do this about worldly things why can't you do this about things that pertain to God that pertain to your salvation that pertain to Healing that pertain to the Holy Ghost he says just enter into the field of things and become a part of it well I don't want to shout because everybody else is shouting he said to just be a part of it enter in and become a part of it what is it that we're getting into he says but oh how they hate the Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word the spirit he's talking about all these things about the field out about the excitement about the shouting and he says that's the spirit of God's word he says they call us Fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship church I say it's time that we actually just quit worrying about what the critics are saying to quit even addressing them that they have no bearing over who we are what we do how we worship I'm reading the prophet of God that says forget that just go ahead and get in the spirit of worship if you feel like worship and worship if you come in and don't feel like just enter right on in just become a part of well I haven't felt in moving yet just get in the spirit of worship just go ahead and do it clap your hands shout amen sing a song If you need to run run just go ahead and whatever you do don't be a Wallflower or a dried up stick amen get in the spirit how happy can we get well how are we supposed to act how much are we allowed to act he said the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights in its pleasures have you ever watched a ball game where somebody wins at the last second and a hundred thousand people breaks out in chaos now some people would look at that and go well I can't believe it I was looking at videos of your church service and it looked just like people at a ball game Prophet said we could matter of fact Prophet said we should you ought to be just as exuberant how free can I get as free as you want how loud can I get as loud as you want how much can I worship as much as you want to worship you ought to be so overflowing with exuberance and joy and Thanksgiving that there is absolutely no contain of no containing it well I've seen people at concerts and they dance check he said ought to be just as exuberant I've seen people at concerts and ball games and they run and shout and scream check I can too he said I ought to be just as exuberant and as excited as they are listen I have every bit of a right to get excited about my salvation as they do because they won a ball game they're excited about being filled with the Holy Ghost her excited that I'm going in a Rapture I how dare us let them out worship their gods when we have the one true and living God we want to look at them I say no I'm going to out worship them I'm gonna out praise him I'm gonna give my God everything when I come into the house of God Hallelujah he says I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day now to some people the Lord's day brother Branham goes to Great length explaining this is the Lord's day is the Sabbath day which is Saturday to a lot of people and some people like The Seventh-Day Adventist they still make it a law you must go to church on Saturday because they believe that to be the Sabbath and this is in line with Jewish Traditions it was mandatory practice that had been described to the Jews in the Ten Commandments and what you'll find is early Jewish Christians those that have been converted from Judaism over into Christianity for a time did continue to gather on Saturday because it's what they knew it was what they had been taught but as early as the second century we find that many local churches began to meet on Sundays now it was still a back and forth thing some met on Sunday some met on Saturday but the point was there wasn't a law anymore as to when you should meet but it did come a time actually in Roman law many were still hanging on to traditions of Saturday here and there until the fourth Century there was a council of laodicea and and that Council they made the non-observance of the Sabbath officially approved in other words Christians now this is coming from the Catholic Church understand you no longer have to observe the Sabbath and they replaced it with Sunday following Emperor Constantine's blue laws which was passed in 321 A.D and it said on the venerated day of the sun s-u-n noticed you see the the Pagan tradition slipping right in there but on the venerable day of the sun let the magistrates and the people residing in cities rest and let all workshops be closed and so this is one of the first laws that we see where they're actually setting aside a certain day that has to do with worship and and things like that but what comes along in the New Testament is and it takes a while for the Jewish tradition of the Jewish Christians to get a hold of this is it was no longer in keeping a day the Sabbath day was no longer about whether it's Saturday whether it's Sunday whether you're allowed to go to work whether you're allowed to pick something up or or get your Ox out of the ditch it was no longer about these things brother Branham said God gave Israel the seventh day for their Sabbath in commemoration now listen close in commemoration of his own work wherein he created the world and all that was therein and then stopped creating he ceased from his labors he rested and so he gives this to Israel and commemoration but what he gave them was only in a shadow of an eternal rest that you can enter into and remain in not just a day of the week not just a little period of time set aside but you have the opportunity today to enter into an eternal rest Hebrews 4 and 8 says for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his so this isn't only entering into a day of rest but it's a rest that you can enter into and remain in it is an eternal rest and and the seventh day given to Israel was only a type of this rest let's go further into what this rest is Matthew 11 28 come unto me all ye that labor and our heavy laden and I will give you rest notice he's not trying to give him a Saturday or a Sunday he says I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your Souls this is an eternal rest in other words this is eternal life he says come unto me you that are heavy laden it doesn't matter how long you've been carrying that burden it doesn't matter how long you've been trying it doesn't matter how long you've been failing but brother Aaron I've come to the Altar and I've tried and I failed and I've come and I've tried it doesn't matter how many times you've come how many times you failed how much you think you're a failure tonight he says come unto me all you that are heavy come to me he says I will give you rest young people this is true rest you'll never know rest until you enter into his rest you'll never know what true rest is until you come into that and what he say it was the Sabbath is ceasing from your works just as it was commemorated when the Lord had had finished um creating and he stopped and he took a day of rest the Sabbath is ceasing from your works it is you ceasing and God doing oh amen that's what this rest is you ceasing and God doing what is it it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you give it all to him and then he gives himself to you and now you have him on the inside and eternally you can rest you can rest in your salvation you can rest that you're gonna make it you can rest that you or you're going to overcome you can rest that you're going to go in a Rapture it is the Eternal rest no longer in a day brother Branham says this is the true Sabbath that was promised thus when they were filled with the Holy Ghost they ceased from their worldly Works their worldly doings their evil ways the Holy Ghost took charge of their lives they entered into rest there's your rest that is your Sabbath young people you haven't experienced true rest until you've entered in to that rest and the way you enter into that rest is by him entering in to you listen your heart whether you recognize it or not it's not about your physical body needing rest your heart cries for that rest your soul Christ for that rest no matter what you try in this world listen I don't ever want to stand here and glorify sin but I tried lots of things and I lived lots of different ways trying to satisfy something down here on the inside and it doesn't matter what you try it doesn't matter where you go you will never find true perfect rest until you allow that Holy Ghost to enter into you in the perfect rest of Eternity come upon your soul that's when you'll find rest no amount of drugs no amount of pills no amount of movies and entertainment is going to satisfy that hunger on the inside of a True Believer that says Lord I just need your rest I need your Holy Ghost to come in my life that's where you find rest the eternal rest so it's not a day like Saturday or Sunday when John says that I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day it couldn't brother Branham says it couldn't be just a Saturday or a Sunday anyway because these Visions unfolded over a period of two years so actually what happened was that John was caught up in the spirit and transported into the Lord's day which is to come a day which is in the future and John is seeing things by the spirit in a future day currently we're not living in the Lord's Day this is man's day this is the day of man it's man's rule man's government man's ideas why do you think everything's falling apart all around us why you think everything's so messed up because God is not currently ruling yes we know he's in control but we are in man's day but the day of the Lord is coming you can assure yourself that the day of the Lord is coming but but John is seeing into the Lord's day brother Brown says the Lord's Day is when the days of man are over he says the kingdom of this world will become the kingdoms of our God the day of the Lord is when the Judgment Falls and after that comes the millennium young people don't get caught up in the day of man don't get caught up in the pleasures of this world don't get caught up in your Pursuit of Happiness here yes I understand we have to work we have to pay our bills we want a car we gotta we want a family we want those things and absolutely those things or there's nothing wrong with you making sure you take care of that there is nothing wrong with you going to school there is nothing wrong with you pursuing a career there is nothing wrong with those things don't don't let it get pushed out of balance but what I'm telling you is don't get so caught up in chasing things here that you forget that the day of the Lord is upon us that the day of the Lord is coming and you can make all the preparations you want for here that's fine as long as you recognize that the most important preparations you'll ever gonna make is for that day the most important preparations you're ever going to make is that you know that you know that you know that when that day comes you've got no problem leaving everything you've gathered up in the day of man right here and let it burn listen I'm all about making all the money you can make as long as it doesn't hinder your walk with God I'm all about you being as successful as you possibly can be as long as you recognize that everything you succeed in here on Earth is Canon fodder and it's going to burn one day but that see Gene of God down on the inside if you're taking care of that if you're feeling that if you're letting that find its Eternal rest then when all this is burning you're going to be just fine you're going to be in glory you're going to be in the Millennium you're going to be beyond all the Realms of this Earth and you're going to be with your lord and savior I say prepare for that day because even though we get caught up and well it's been this many years and it's been that and I want to get married and I want to graduate all things that we all want I remember as a kid going I don't want the end of the world to come before I get married honest moment how many people have thought that and nobody raises their hand because you're lying just messing with you but we all have those things where you say I want to accomplish this I want to accomplish this don't ever let it supersede that I want to go home I want to go into Rapture I want to be in God's will for my life rest let me catch this back up it's going the wrong direction it's literally going backwards here we go says it here's a voice and the voice is like a trumpet anytime a trumpet is used in in the Bible what he's saying here this is very symbolic he didn't literally somebody's speaking and it sounded like they were blowing a trumpet said it was like a trumpet in other words when the trumpets were used in in the Bible it was a moment of urgency so he's saying there is an urgency in this voice there there is a a warning that is coming forth and when it tells you that was like a trumpet what it's telling you is you need to listen you need to pay attention there there is urgency here this is a warning and it's telling you to prepare the trumpet was never sounded for the people of Israel for meaningless things they didn't blow the trumpet to announce that the people over here in this quadrant of the camp had burned their beans we'd like everybody to know that she's terrible cook and so this family is going to be eating burned beans tonight you would go that was pointless we'd like you to know that the weather today is going to be 77 degrees and sunny they didn't gather up all these people for meaningless and pointless things if they blew a trumpet you better get ready for war if you blew a trumpet there was a declaration from God going forth if a trumpet was blown there was urgency and what was going to be spoken was something that absolutely mattered and so he says that the voice that came forth was like a trumpet and I'd like to say that in this day's service after service after service the messages that go forth are like a trumpet they're telling you get ready the day of the Lord's coming make sure you got the Holy Ghost make sure your your lamps are trimmed make sure you got oil it's a gospel trumpet going out service after service not just from this Pulpit but around the world telling you it's the day of man right now but the day of the Lord is upon us you've got to get ready assemble yourselves make sure you're ready the day of the Lord is here there's an urgency coming forth in other words John hears it and it stops him in his tracks and he says that voice was like the voice of a trumpet is something calling you to attention saying don't be caught unaware wake up wake up don't be snared by the cares of Life wake up there's a message that's going forth there's a Rapture come and wake up it's going forth like a trumpet and it's urgent and it's calling him Revelations 1 11 and this urgent voice is saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seeest write in a book and send it and to the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto Smyrna and unto pergamus and under thy Terror and under Sardis and under Philadelphia and unto laodicea he says write the Visions John make a record of what it is you're about to see make a record of them for the Ages which are to follow for they are the true prophecies which must come to pass write them and send them out making them known that last line there just kind of struck me making them known listen God doesn't want to remain a mystery he doesn't want to remain some far off God to you that maybe the pastor knows a little bit about maybe mama knows a little bit about but I just don't understand what I'm reading remember what we said a a Believer can never pray too much for Revelation you pray for Revelation you seek Revelation you ask God for more Revelation because he wants to be made known not just to evening like Tabernacle not just to this church or this church he wants to be made known to you as an individual I understand that we sometimes we can't just read it and understand it but you pray God open yourself to me Lord open your word to me reveal yourself to me and here John is in the same voice that spoke worlds into existence the same voice that was heard there on Mount Transfiguration booms forth and says here is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ and it says write it down and send it to the churches make them known he wants you to know him quick quick quit leaving it in Mama's hands and Daddy's Hands and pastors hands you get into the word you get into a prayer life you begin to study you say God make yourself a reality unto me listen I'm thankful for for Christian homes and I'm thankful for Godly Parents but when the trials and the tribulations comes you're not going to be able to hold on to Mama's anchor and Daddy's anchor it's got to be your anchor he's had to get down deep on the inside of your soul and the way that happens is by you seeking more of God you seeking Revelation you seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost Revelation 1 12. and I turned to see The Voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks now a lot of the translations you read translated lamp stands instead of candlesticks seven golden lampstands and that's actually what brother Branham tells us it is as he begins to break it down he says these are actually lampstands because candles can't give continuous light candles burn out and eventually the wax has gone and he said but a lamp drawing its oil from from a from a reservoir can burn forever it's it's never going to go out and as we will read later in verse 20 that these lamp stands are the seven churches so he turns and he sees seven golden lamp stands and verse 20 tells us these lampstands are the seven churches and we can get a great description of these lamp stands if we'll go over to Zechariah 4. in chapter chapter 4 verse one and we're going to read through this and it says in the angel that taught with me came again and wake me as a man that is waking out of his sleep and he said unto me what seeth thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees buy it one on the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side of the bowl so I answered and spake to the angel that taught with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto his Aruba saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord so what we see here in Zechariah is the lamp stands Burning Brightly and the reason that they're able to be doing that is because they have a source of oil they're not burning on their own power but they're drawing their life from this source of oil and it's getting its oil from the olive trees so there's one on the right and there's one on the left and these olive trees represent the Old Testament and the New Testament and the oil of course we know represents the Holy Ghost and Zechariah here tells the angel I don't know what this means and the angel says not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts in other words there is no light without my spirit the church can do nothing in their own without the Holy Ghost you can do nothing without the oil there will be no light listen you can't do anything in your own strength but brother I've been trying to do this and I've been trying to do right and I've been trying you can keep trying and you'll keep failing he says it's not by your might not by your strength but by his power saith the Lord you've got to get the wick dipped into the oil and then that light will shine then you don't got to try to produce the fire you just got to let that oil burn you just got to let that light come out of you you just got to let it manifest itself it's no longer you doing the works because by Your Own Strength you can do nothing there must be oil in your lamp that's what he's telling him not by night nor by power but by my spirit by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you must have that in your life brother Aaron why so much preaching on the Holy Ghost why so much preaching on the power of the Holy Ghost and we need the Holy Ghost and you've got to have the token you got to have the Holy Ghost because without it you can do nothing much less the things that we're commissioning to do in John 14 12 the Greater Works if we can't do nothing we sure can't do the Greater Works if we can't do nothing we sure can't overcome the devil but he says by my spirit I say Lord I need your spirit I need more than I've ever had I want you just to keep filling the reservoir let the light burn greater than it's ever burned I don't have to worry about it burning out because there's an endless supply of his oil Hallelujah what's amazing about this is you see that there's one reservoir that contains all the oil remember now the lamp stands represented the churches so the church at Ephesus in the first age isn't getting from one reservoir in the church down here in laodicea drawing oil from another Reservoir but the seven lampstands are all drawing from the same Reservoir of oil the seven lamps are lit and they burn by the same old brother Branham says first the priest took the fire from the sacred altar which was originally lit by the fire of God he lit first of all the lamp that was sitting on the top of the bowl then he let the second lamp from the flame off the first lamp then the third lamp received its fire from the second lamp as did the fourth receive it from the third and so on until all seven lamps were burning he says the original outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring came direct from Jesus on the mercy seat is in doing his church through all seven ages he just said what they had at Pentecost is exactly what you can have the outpouring at Pentecost is in doing his church through all seven ages and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and never changing God in his Essence in his ways what are you saying brother and I'm saying you can have the exact same experience they had in the upper room it's the exact same fire it's the exact same oil it's the exact same life and so therefore it will produce the exact same thing well what do I need that for because they overcame him and through that same experience you'll overcoming they cast Satan out you'll cast Satan now where they were filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the same oil it's the same fire going from lamp to lamp to lamp to lamp and in this day it's not a man-made fire but it's the original fire lit by the fire of almighty God when it came down and divided itself in licks of fire and fell upon 120 I say Lord let that same Fire Light My Soul tonight like this youth group tonight let it burn in evening light Tabernacle he says I am the Vine you are the branches the life comes through the Vine and the fruit comes through the branches listen that's why we can't help but bring forth another book of Acts that's what brother Branham said that puts forth another Branch it would write another book of Acts behind it why because the acts was the fruit I'm not talking about the book I'm literally talking about the things they did that made them write the book the ax was the fruit that was coming out of the branch that was drawing its strength from the Vine and if we're drawing our strength from the same oil the same Reservoir and that's coming up through us through the vine and we put forth another Branch then the fruit on our branch is going to be a book of Acts fruit it's going to look the same act the same talk the same speak in tones the same shout the same oh come on some people don't like it I'm just telling you what the prophet said it's going to be exactly the same because if we're drawing from the same Life Source and we are an original Branch not a grafted Branch but an original Branch coming forth from the vine than our fruits must match the original fruits amen original life drawing from the same source that they drew from on the day of Pentecost you must draw from that original life in other words you must draw from the same Basin of oil if you're drawing your oil from a different Basin that it's not going to be even the same fire it's strange fire you can read about that in the Old Testament you don't want Strange Fire in the camp it's got to be the same oil producing the same fire every believer now not just every messenger every believer drawing from the same source dead to self not drawing from Aaron Oglesby not drawing from your life Source but you're dead to self sealed in Christ and the life flowing through you now is the same life that fell at the first the same fire that fell in the first it is original fire brother Branham says every True Believer is depicted in the lampstands listen this I love this thought he says no man can pluck them out of his hand their lives cannot be tampered with now take this this is talking about you this isn't The Messengers this isn't the pastors this is you the believer their lives cannot be tampered with the visible life is burning and Shining giving light and manifestations of the Holy Ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in God and fed by the Lord's word Satan cannot touch them I want you to hear that again Satan cannot touch you oh but he's been telling me this and fear and anxiety has been scratching at my door Satan cannot touch you he says he cannot pluck them out of his head tonight you were in the hand of almighty God and Satan cannot touch you he'll try to he'll try to get you to let him in but if you sit there and say no sir I'm sealed by the same oil I'm sealed by the same fire you have no right you can't touch me you cannot get a hold of my life you can't have my family you can't have my health you can't have my experience you can't have my joy you can't have my peace Satan can not touch you I say somebody needs to take that tonight and let it down deep underneath the fifth rib that's for you he cannot touch you Hallelujah the original life Revelation 1 13. and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle now this is kind of where it gets like I said earlier a little bit heavier because we see here John recognizes a changing where it goes from priests to judge and John is seeing this in the Lord's day and brother Branham says this is the Lord's day for John sees him standing not as priests but John sees him as the coming judge and you can recognize this because the golden girdle is no longer around his waist where a priest would wear it but it is now around his shoulders like a judge would wear it listen these are things that for for centuries people just read over and read over and read over and these things didn't stand out but you have a prophet in this day come and say every little detail matters every little facet matters every description matters and he says it's now over his shoulder the way a judge would wear it we know that right now he is currently our high priest and he is our intercester intercessor but that's not something that's going to last forever right now he can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities but John sees him here as his role was changing from that of of priest to judge and it says in John 5 22 for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son and brother Brown says what we're seeing here in this scripture is actually the Fulfillment of that scripture there in John so what we're seeing is a time where the days of Prophecy are finished you know we just see down through the Bible that this is going to happen and then this is going to happen and this is going to happen and he says the days of Prophecy are finished and he has come to a place where he is no longer interceding for the Lost he is no longer interceding for those that haven't accepted him but he has turned to judge and tonight even as we go through the rest of this I'll probably say it over and over again because as I study this is so weighed upon my heart that I want to urge you to find him tonight while he can still be found as intercessor while he can still be found as priests while he can still be one that can be touched by the feelings of your infirmity why he's still standing there with his blood saying calling saying come unto me all you that are heavy laid and I will give you rest that's the call tonight but it's not the call that's going to go on forever because there's coming a time where he's no longer going to be interceding and he's going to be judging but right now there is still Mercy to be had listen we've still we preach mercy and we believe there is Mercy to be had we preach Grace and we believe that Grace is still here but there is coming a day it is the Lord's day and John saw it where the priesthood is over and he stands now girded no longer as a priest but he stands girded as a judge Revelation 1 14-16 and every one of these as we go through them I want you to keep in mind we're seeing him as judge every detail points back to his judgeship it said his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow in his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice has the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength in these verses like I said we continue to see him as judge even though John is describing him in his seventh-fold glory it's still as judge I'm very sorry that that got that small I didn't mean to do that I'll read it to you we'll be okay so the Sevenfold Glory of his person every descriptive attribute that we just read in those three verses every little description has significance it all matters we'll start there it said his hair as white as snow this isn't telling you that God got old okay this isn't an old man humans that tends to happen but what it's saying here is is that he's crowned in wisdom it is speaking of his wisdom it's showing us that the judge is crown and wisdom it's exactly how Daniel saw him in the Old Testament I want to go there and and read that for you Daniel 7 and 9 says I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousands thousands ministered unto him and ten thousands time ten thousand stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open so what we see here is John and Daniel see him exactly the same way they see him I love the continuity of the scripture how it all lines up they both see him as a wigged one hair white as wool and and Daniel describes it as the judgment and we know that John's seeing him as the judge in his boat lining up now I'm going to show you this picture it's actually symbology that even the world understands when you see this other if I say what does this mean other than saying well it means they were stupid because why would you do that as young people I you know you look at you're like what are they doing but it wasn't necessarily a status thing it was what judges did this was a judge and and wearing this in ancient courts the judge would appear dressed in a white wig in a long robe that signified complete Authority so John sees him and he sees it's an authority Daniel sees him and he sees it's an authority and it's something that people can relate to because they knew that judges wore these robes and they wore these these Whigs the symbology here is unmistakable that he is being seen as a judge we can no longer argue it's the priesthood there is no doubt Daniel saw him John saw him the the dispensation has changed he is now the judge his eyes is fire you're the first sermon I ever preached came from this I called it the eyes of Christ and I was dealing with this same thought that you know these are the eyes that were once full of compassion these are the eyes that wept at the tomb of Lazarus these are the eyes that saw visions these are the eyes that that would look beyond the evil of those crucifying and say father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing eyes that would look on lepers and and feel compassion and heal them these are the eyes we're talking about but now they have turned to Eyes Of Fire because now they are the eyes of the judge brother Brown says now those eyes are a flame of fire the eyes of the judge who will recompense those who have rejected him he says there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed I want you to listen young people many times we think well I did that in secret I kept that from Mom Mom and Dad don't even know that's going on well the preacher don't know and oh it's cute and it's funny and we have things hit listen I'm not saying that just because I think so I know I'm not that old I remember I'll just say it I remember when I was a rebellious teenager I remember even when I was trying to live right and still there was things you didn't want people to know because you were failing to live right so you hit them you hid these things he says there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do think of it he knows even now what you are thinking as a young person that statement used to always shock me awake tonight instantly Lord forgive that thought I'm very sorry you know in those moments your carnal and you're 14 and you're going I'm sorry that I haven't been paying attention in church and I was thinking about all this other stuff but it's much deeper than that he knows even now what you're thinking he says yes there he stands as judge with flaming eyes to meet out judgment the day of Mercy is over oh that men might repent and seek his face in righteousness while there is yet time listen young people God is is so patient God is so full of love and he's so kind but there is coming a time where he must judge there Comes A Time because he is a just God where Justice must be meted out and John was in the Lord's day looking upon the day of the Lord when he comes not as a prophet not as a priest not as a king but he's coming as judge and what I'm telling you tonight is wherever you're at tonight you don't ever want to look into those eyes as the eyes of a judge you don't ever want to look into those eyes as the eyes of fire but tonight he's still looking through eyes of compassion tonight he's still looking through eyes of Grace tonight he's still looking down saying come unto me I'll give you rest yes you fail but I have compassion yes you fail but I have the rest you need that you won't fail anymore and he's looking tonight saying I don't ever want to look at you through eyes of judgment but that day is coming that time is coming but right now there's Mercy right now his eyes have compassion right now his eyes have Grace and right now he's wanting you to come unto him as your intercessor the atonement still works he's telling you tonight it's not too late for Mercy it's not too late for Grace still on the theme of judgment because this is what John is seeing he's seeing him as judge and it says there in our reading and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace brass signifies All Through the Bible brass signifies Divine judgment we see the serpent of brass on the on the pole represented sin judged Divine judgment we'll read that there in numbers 21-8 it says and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he looked at the opponent shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if the serpent had bitten any man when he beheld The Serpent of brass he lived so the serpent of brass on the pole represented sin judged remember brass signifies Divine judgment and Israel had sinned and therefore they had to be judged and so it being made of brass showed that Divine judgment had already fallen upon the thing it had already fallen upon sin's curse so whoever looked upon it and accepted the significance of it was healed of the serpent bite and I'm telling you tonight if you've been bitten by the serpent if the things of the world have got a hold of you and that poison has gotten on the inside of you it's where you can't see yourself being saved you can't see yourself being filled with the Holy Ghost you can't see yourself overcoming he says tonight just look and live just look and live sin was judged sin hung on a cross and told he became sin that you might become his righteousness he says tonight you can once again look and live because sin has been judged the temple altar where sacrifices were made was made out of brass Elijah in his days when God withheld the Reigns the sky was described as brass because it was God's judgment so once again his feet being made out of brass once again point us to he is now judge he is judging even even in his feet we see judgment is being declared his feet of brass it says his feet have withstood the furnace what's that mean it's not talking about trials and tribulations necessarily like we go through you know we go through fiery trials but this is actually speaking of what he did for you he alone faced the Wrath and the judgments of God he took the wrath of God he took your judgments and he faced them he was he was the just being beaten and judged for the unjust he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your iniquities he suffered like no man suffered ever before and he took all that judgment for you and so now these feet that were that were pierced for you these feet that took the wrath of God for you they they they they have withstood the furnace or the judgments of almighty God and now these feet that were pierced will stand on the earth as judge he went through judgment but now he has earned the right to stand and judge brother Branham says but someday those feet of brass will stand upon the earth and the judge of all the Earth he shall be and with equity and Perfection will he judge mankind listen he took judgment for you but if you don't accept it then one day he must judge you So In This Moment he took your judgment he took your punishment he did all these things for you but when he comes on that day and he stands and he sees one standing there that didn't accept it and he took that Whip and of that for their life for nothing he took that beaten for their life specifically for nothing and so because of that now he will judge them for turning that down that judgment that he took but I say Lord in my life you didn't take it for nothing in my life that beaten wasn't for nothing that crucifixion wasn't for nothing but it saved me Lord it healed me Lord Your Life release came back and filled me with the Holy Ghost Lord in my life it wasn't for nothing I want him to Judge Me Now by the word I want to be judged now so I never have to face his judgments then brother Branham says he that is unjust will be unjust still he that is filthy will be filthy still the unchanging one will not change then for he never has and never will those feet of brass will crush the enemy they will destroy the Antichrist the Beast and the image and all that is vile in his sight he will destroy the church systems and that have taken his name only to corrupt its Brilliance and crush them along with the Antichrist all the wicked The Atheist the agnostics the modernists the Liberals will all be there death Hell In The Grave will be there yes they will for when he comes the books will be open and like I said earlier if you read that and you're on the wrong side of Salvation tonight that sounds scary but to the believer tonight there's nothing scary and that what I read is the feet of brass will crush the enemy this is victory for the believer this is victory for those that are safe in Christ that has entered into that Eternal rest this is this is that enemy of Torment that's been upon your life his feet of brass crushed that thing this is that that sickness that has tormented your family his feet of breath crushed that thing this is a Victorious moment where the feet of brass come and they crush the enemy that is in your life I say tonight look and live don't be crushed by the feet but let that those feet crush the enemy that has tried to crush you tonight but you got to look and live now you got to look to the to the Cross now you have to accept his atonement for your sins now because you don't want to meet him as judge then these feet can be the greatest weapon that has ever gone before you but to many there will be the very thing that crushes them as he comes to judge the Earth he says when he comes he will take over the kingdom for it is his and with him will be thousands times ten thousands his bride who come to minister to him glory oh it is now or never repent before it is too late wake up from amongst the dead and seek God to be filled with his Spirit or you will miss eternal life don't meet him in the condition you're in tonight don't meet him as a sinner you can take care of that tonight it's nothing more than just it's not some big fancy thing you have to do you just gotta get to the place where you say God I know I haven't entered into that rest yet I want to enter into that rest I want I want to move from from from judgment on that day to where I can come in that day and hear well done my good and faithful servant it's not something you have to carry on and living a life of fear am I going to make it am I going to go on a Rapture am I going to be left behind he said in that day you shall know you don't have to guess whether he's in you and you're in him he said You shall know I say Lord let us know tonight let me know let my anchor get down deep that I know that I know that I know that I know that on that day I won't see you as judge but I'll see you as friend I'll see you as the bridegroom I see you with as one With Arms Wide Open that say come unto me that's the desire of my heart for each and every one of you tonight foreign the sound of many Waters it says his voice was at the sound of many Waters and Waters represents peoples multitudes Nations and tongues so his voice is as the sound of multitudes speaking brother Branham says it's the voice of judgment he says take heed this very hour for at this moment your thoughts are being recorded in heaven there your thoughts speak louder than your words he says for these are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses listen now about the voice of many Waters this just so jumped out at me he says who by the Holy Spirit All Through the Ages hath testified to Christ and preached his gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment Against The Sinner who would not take warning the voices of the seven Messengers will be heard loud and clear those faithful preachers who preach the saving power of Jesus who preach water baptism in Jesus name who preached the infilling of the power of the Holy Ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost down through the ages and if you stand there that day on the wrong side of judgment every opportunity you ever had will Flash before your eyes every sermon you ever heard preached will replay in your ears every time the Pastor said this and you thought oh that's just brother Tim he's so old-fashioned oh that's just Mom and Dad what do they know they're they're not a teenager in every opportunity and every warning and every sermon and everything as it rises up as a voice of many Waters in your ears and you hear it over and playing and playing brother Branham would say it would sound like a a Rushing River going over the cataracts if you don't know what cataracts are that's like a giant waterfall with all the rocks and it'd be it'll be roaring in your ears the voice of judgment as you hear every sermon every voice every messenger it says every man rising in judgment Against The Sinner who would not take warning it's rough what a scary moment what an awful time and I tell you that's not a sound I ever want to hear instead of that on that day you can hear well done my good and faithful servant he says and someday now this is right after he talks about the cataracts he says and someday we will hear that same sweet voice speak not in judgment but in welcome to us whose sins have been remitted by his blood whose lives have been Spirit-filled and whose walk was in the word what could be more precious than to hear the multitudes those same multitudes that while ago would have been terrifying to hear to hear the multitudes of welcoming voices and be surrounded by those multitudes who have believed unto eternal life make that your goal tonight on that day let it be a welcoming multitude a multitude that says welcome you did it welcome you made it you overcame and Satan's eating you got down and you got beat down but you wouldn't quit you wouldn't stop you got back up and you went again and you got back up and you win again and you got back up and you went again welcome my good and faithful servant you did it enter into the joys of the Lord that's what I want to hear that's what I want to hear from every single one of you welcome welcome welcome I say welcome tonight welcome his presence welcome it into your heart welcome it in so that on that day he'll welcome you in Hallelujah you don't have to hear the sound of judgment oh God May none of us hear that sound he says in his right hand or Seven Stars we're told in verse 20 that these are these seven stories it says in the mystery of the Seven Stars are the Angels or The Messengers of the seven churches the Seven Stars Are The Messengers to the seven successive Church ages in other words there is one to each age don't ever forget that when this one Rises and that one Rises and I'm the eighth messenger and I'm here to finish it no no there's one to each age we have received our Prophet messenger we have received our church age messenger and each messenger is identified and Vindicated by almighty God as each age would would drift away from God and get further and further away the messenger would come and and then he would turn them back to the word and God would vindicate that what he was saying is the truth through signs and wonders and miracles and brother Branham says I found that interesting he said that the messenger would always be accused of being Holy Rollers and I thought if the messenger to the Ages were always accused of being Holy Rollers I think it's just fine if we are yeah well Holy Roller and y'all are a little bit Pentecostal and y'all get a little bit excited brother Brandon says every messenger was accused of being a Holy Roller I say if it's been too long since you've been accused of being a holy roll or shame on you if it's okay for The Messengers to be accused of that I'll take that I don't mind it one bit but he says that every True Believer is found in the hand of God not just the messengers he says every True Believer is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer I want you to key in on this tonight so many times and I know I'm even guilty of it many times I sit right there and you you see certain Gifts of different Ministries operating and it's not that you're jealous but you you look at certain ones and and you think well this one's higher and this one's here and this one's here and this one's more spiritual and and I'm just here and brother Branham goes and says it ain't just The Messengers it ain't just the greatest gift and he's pointing to something Beyond any gift we have standing around here today he says it's not just for them every True Believer how many is Believers tonight is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer listen this right here struck me so hard what God gives the messenger so I'll say it like this so we have no doubts what God gave brother Branham and How He blesses and uses brother Branham is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body amen I say we've been selling ourselves awful short for far too long and we've been living far below our privileges for far too long it's not just for some hierarchy to operate in the Supernatural this isn't the doctrines of the Nicolaitans where we find you know just just the preacher can have the Supernatural and just the prophet can have it and the rest of you just have to sit out there and try to absorb it but brother Branham said it's for all of you to have all of you can have a taste all of you can operate in the Supernatural it's for every last believer because all of us are drawing our strength all of us are drawing our life from the exact same reservoir of oil listen when it goes back to the day of Pentecost they were all endued with power from on high it doesn't say Peter got it and the rest of them just had a little bit different they were all received the same baptism of the Holy Ghost you can live in power you can live in the Supernatural you can overcome the enemy you tonight well who's he talking to I'm talking to you it is for you you are in the hand of God and you can draw your strength from there tonight Hallelujah he goes on and says and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword which is the word of God it is the discerner we've all seen it maybe you've never experienced it but I know I've experienced it multiple times not necessarily where the preacher would stand here and say and Call My Name by turning pointing at me but where the word calls my name by by repeating precisely conversations I had maybe the night before or on the way to church or maybe a doubt I had in my heart and that word will go right down in there and it still discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart and speaks directly to that need and as a human your first instinct is somebody told him you're right the Holy Spirit did you don't know how many times I've preached things and then I thought man that was a flop man that didn't go over well you know I I didn't it just didn't go the way I thought then somebody come and say you're not going to believe that you were dealing with this exact situation such and such such as by any chance have you talked to so and so not in an accusing kind of way but almost just in a way of wanting to make sure did God just speak to me tonight and and you recognize that he's still the discerner his word is still a a sharp two-edged sword Hebrews 4 12 says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Morrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intense of the heart brother Branham says it is going to discern All Nations and all men just like it did Nathanael when Nathanael came and he said you know I saw you when you were underneath the tree it was a discerner it went right into his thoughts it went right into where he had been and he says the word of God will show who did the will of God and who didn't do the will of God works are going to be judged by the word motives will be judged by the word those who claim to believe but didn't live will be judged all by the word he says every secret will be shouted from the housetops imagine how exposed you would feel every thought every secret every word every deed even the motives of your words when you said something nice but you really didn't mean it exposed when you did this and you raised your hands and you did this and you went here or whatever you did but the motive behind it exposed no secrets he says every Secret will be shouted from the Housetop now once again that's not something for us to fear because we're not on the side of that we're saying Lord expose me now Lord if there's anything in my life that needs fix and expose it now let the word speak to me now let me deal with it at an altar now I don't want to deal with it then he says the word preached is like a flaming two-edged sword don't let that scare you that's exactly what we need because the word preach it is quick and it is sharp that means it's alive that means it'll go right out there and that sharp sword will cut out bitterness and then it'll come right over here and it'll cut out unbelief and then it'll come right over here and the preaching and the words going forth and you're sitting there and if you're accepting it and it'll come in it'll cut out selfishness and it'll come over here and you've been dealing with a with Rebellion it'll cut out Rebellion I say Lord let that sword go and start doing surgery in my life Lord I know there's places I've fallen short but tonight Lord do surgery on my heart do surgery in the young people of Eden like Tabernacle cut out Rebellion cut out unbelief cut out selfishness cut out those things oh I've been struggling in my body it'll come in and it'll cut out sickness brother Branham spoke and put the word upon his on his lips and then his wife had a tumor in her body thousands of miles away and it went there in that sharp two-edged sword cut that tumor right out it'll cut out sickness out of your life oh by that sword the sick are healed by that sword shackles are broken chains are pushed back people are set free it's not something that scares us that sharp two-edged swords we say operate Lord operate by Your Word operate in your power be quick be sharp and cut off the things in my life that need to be cut off it cuts out what we needed to cut out now so that we don't stand before it then now it is an instrument wielded to bring you freedom but then that instrument will bring death as it cuts out those and sends them to judgment that never would accept it but he says that word that sharp two-edged sword has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians once again that sword is judgment to the world but you can take it now and let it judge that Affliction in your life you can take it now and let it judge that unruly tongue in your life unruly spirit in your life judge that spirit that haunts you and that sword will come in and cut it off it'll cut that chain it'll cut that anxiety it'll cut that fear you got to recognize what those things are they're only chains that are trying to keep you from coming to the full manifestation of what God intends you to be it's not making you an unbeliever that anxiety that fear that thing rising up trying it's not keeping you from being a Believer but it's keeping you from realizing your full potential as a Believer and it's keeping you from going deeper and it's keeping you from going further and tonight the sword of the word of the words come in and going you're free you can walk in Freedom you can go into the depths you can serve him with all your heart you can worship him with all your heart oh Hallelujah you don't have to face him in the Judgment tonight you're free young people you're free to serve him you're free to have eternal rest you're free to go in a Rapture you're free to be Overcomers because the sword of the word has come in this day and it's cut you free I say rejoice in your freedom rejoice in your Liberty Hallelujah you never have to stand before him as judge says his face was like the sun and we're getting close to being done here and his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength if we go back to Matthew 17 we see other examples of this when it speaks of Mount Transfiguration it says and it bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun Revelation 21 23 in the city had no need of the son neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof you ever think about that his faith his face shine like the sun when Paul saw him on the road to Damascus it was so it was so bright it was like the sun it put his eyes out and then it goes for and says there's no need for the sun or moon there because his face his glory shineth like the Sun what a light that's shining in this day what a light that John saw when he looked down through time and it's never it doesn't matter how dark the world has gotten that light has not been put out Satan has tried to put it out and I say it's still shining in layout to see her it's still shining in my heart it's still shining in your heart it's a light that overcomes Darkness let that shine that light shine down into the dark places of your heart tonight down into the crooks and into the crannies where the things are that you don't want to deal with let that light get down in there let the son of righteousness arise tonight and let that light shine with healings in its wings for your life there he is shining in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks his glory shining in every Church age I like that it says he was in the midst that means he was there in the middle of all the ages he was seen in our age church he was seen in laodicea he didn't say he was walking there and after the sixth age his face dimmed a little bit no but it's shining like the sun in this day so that you would have light so that you could see so that you could overcome brother Brandon says there he stands the judge the one who suffered and died for us he took the wrath of divine judgment upon himself he tread The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of God alone as we have already stated to The Sinner his voices is the sound of the Cataract or the surf pounding in ways of death upon the Rocks but to the Saints his voice is as the sound of sweetly singing Brook as you lie at rest satisfied in Christ shining upon us with the warming rays of love he says fear not I am he which was which is which is to come I am the almighty besides me there is no other I am the Alpha and the Omega I am all of it are you ready to meet him I'm ready to meet him but I'm not ready to meet him as judge I'm ready to meet him as one that his voice is sweetly singing to the brook As I lie at rest I'm ready to meet him as One Shining upon me with his warming rays of love as he and it says fear not I am he which was which is I'm asking tonight will that voice be a voice of judgment to you or will it be a voice that says fear not enter into rest is it a voice of cataracts and rocks is it a consuming light of rays that come to consume his enemies or is it the light of warmth shining upon your back you don't have to feel the consuming fire consuming you unto death you can say Lord consume me with your life take control of me now so that I don't have to face you in that way that brings us to Revelation 1 17 and 18. says and when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not look at this all this judgment all this judgment all this judgment all this judgment but then he says John here representing the believer he laid his hand upon him and said fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death this is it this is the Victorious Christ this is the one that took the punishment that you were supposed to take this is the one that took the beatings that you were supposed to take he's already taken your punishment he's already taken my punishment and he stands there and says fear not you're not going to have to go through it fear not yeah you were supposed to go to hell but you don't have to I don't did that for you matter of fact I've got the keys to death Helen the great you don't gotta fear hell already conquered it you don't got to fear death I already conquered it you

don't have to fear laodicea fear not Believers I am the one that overcame I was dead but now I'm alive and because I live you may live also Hallelujah we've got no reason to fear we got no reason to fear the enemy I declare tonight the enemy that torments you is a conquered enemy it's a defeated enemy take the feet of brass that were burned in the furnace and withstood it and crush your enemy tonight it is under your feet fear or not we have a Victorious Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah what he loses is loose he's loosed you from fear he's loosed you from sin he's loosed you from bad habits he's loosed you from condemnation he's loosed you from your past you're loosed and what he binds is bound he's bound the Tormentor that said you wasn't going to make it he's bound the enemy that said he was going to bring your family down he's bound the darkness that has tried to suppress you and he has bound the devil that would try to hold you from a rapture he is he has bound it all up and once he binds it it is bound and he's loosed you and once you are loosed you're loose this is a Victorious Christ young people he's your attorney he's the jury he's the judge and he says fear not don't
