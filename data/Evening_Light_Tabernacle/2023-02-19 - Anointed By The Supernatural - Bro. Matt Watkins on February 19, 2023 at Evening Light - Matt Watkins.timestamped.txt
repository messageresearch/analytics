[1:02:38] you feel that's not from this world it's
[1:02:41] from another dimension
[1:02:43] brother Brandon said when you begin to
[1:02:45] feel that Spirit move and you think oh
[1:02:47] my I just feels like I want to cry and
[1:02:49] others would say I feels like I want to
[1:02:51] shout and I don't really know why
[1:02:52] brother Branham said it's because you're
[1:02:54] bumping into that other dimension
[1:02:57] you know I want to bump into that
[1:02:58] dimension
[1:02:59] I'm sick and tired of this world and all
[1:03:01] its anxiety and stress and worry and
[1:03:04] fear that's gripping the world I want to
[1:03:06] bump into another dimension and say Lord
[1:03:08] would you call me up higher this morning

[1:03:13] look to the supernatural God
[1:03:15] amen well God bless you we want to turn

[1:03:50] praise the Lord
[1:03:52] Joshua chapter 4
[1:03:56] I want to begin reading here at the
[1:03:58] first verse that I'm going to minister
[1:03:59] to you on a title anointed by the
[1:04:03] supernatural
[1:04:05] Joshua chapter 4 and we'll just begin
[1:04:07] reading it the first verse
[1:04:09] and it came to pass when all the people
[1:04:11] were clean passed over Jordan that the
[1:04:14] Lord spake unto Joshua saying take you
[1:04:17] 12 men out of the people out of every
[1:04:19] tribe of man and command ye them saying
[1:04:23] take you hints out of the midst of
[1:04:24] Jordan out of the place where the priest
[1:04:29] feat stood firm
[1:04:32] now that's important wasn't just any
[1:04:35] stone it wasn't just any place but he
[1:04:38] said there's going to be a specific
[1:04:40] Stone because these stones are going to
[1:04:42] represent something down the road
[1:04:45] now I've just give me Grace here this
[1:04:48] morning I've ministered this in three or
[1:04:50] four different parts but we just have
[1:04:51] one service but and I just want to well
[1:04:53] the Tim told me to take my Liberty so I
[1:04:55] don't I don't really want to have to lay
[1:04:57] a big foundation and then I'm just going
[1:05:00] to jump right in so will you just jump
[1:05:01] right in with me amen let's let's go
[1:05:03] together Amen Let the Holy Spirit lead
[1:05:06] us notice he says take the priest where
[1:05:08] the priest feet stood firm this was a
[1:05:12] certain position what they stood on what
[1:05:14] they stood for what they believed
[1:05:16] and he says take these 12 Stones where
[1:05:19] the priest's feet stood firm
[1:05:22] and he says 12 Stones and you shall
[1:05:24] carry them over with you and leave them
[1:05:26] in the lodging place where you shall
[1:05:27] Lodge this night then Joshua called the
[1:05:29] 12 men whom he had prepared of the
[1:05:31] children of Israel out of every tribe of
[1:05:33] man Joshua said unto them pass over
[1:05:35] before the Ark of the Lord your God into
[1:05:37] the midst of Jordan and take you up
[1:05:39] every man of you a stone upon his
[1:05:41] shoulder according unto the number of
[1:05:43] the tribes of the children of Israel
[1:05:44] that this may be a sign among you that
[1:05:49] when your children ask their fathers in
[1:05:53] time to come saying what do these Stones
[1:05:57] mean
[1:05:59] so God was going to provision something
[1:06:01] now for something that would come later
[1:06:04] and what was our PR what was our
[1:06:06] scripture that in the days that that
[1:06:08] I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he
[1:06:11] shall turn the hearts of the children
[1:06:13] back to the fathers
[1:06:16] and so what was going these Stones going
[1:06:18] to represent a generation of children
[1:06:20] who would begin to ask what do these
[1:06:22] Stones mean
[1:06:24] then you shall answer them verse 7 that
[1:06:26] the Waters of Jordan were cut off before
[1:06:28] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when
[1:06:30] it passed over Jordan the Waters of
[1:06:31] Jordan were cut off and these Stones
[1:06:32] shall be for a memorial unto the
[1:06:35] children of Israel forever in Joshua
[1:06:38] verse 9 set up 12 Stones in the midst of
[1:06:40] Jordan in the place where the Feast of
[1:06:42] feet of the priests which bore the Ark
[1:06:44] of the Covenant stood and they are there
[1:06:45] into this day notice here for the for
[1:06:48] the priest which bore the ark stood in
[1:06:51] the midst of Jordan until everything was
[1:06:55] finished
[1:06:57] that the Lord commanded Joshua to speak
[1:07:00] unto the people according to all that
[1:07:02] Moses commanded Joshua and the people
[1:07:04] hasted and passed over one more
[1:07:06] scripture Second Kings before you're
[1:07:07] seated second Kings chapter 2
[1:07:11] Second Kings 2 and wouldis begin reading
[1:07:14] here at the first first
[1:07:16] and it came to pass when the Lord would
[1:07:19] take up Elijah into Heaven by a
[1:07:22] whirlwind
[1:07:23] that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgal
[1:07:26] and Elisha said unto Elisha
[1:07:29] Tara here I pray thee for the Lord hath
[1:07:32] sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto
[1:07:35] him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[1:07:38] liveth I will not leave thee so they
[1:07:41] went down to Bethel verse 4 and Elijah
[1:07:44] said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray
[1:07:47] thee for the Lord hath sent me to
[1:07:49] Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth
[1:07:51] and as thy soul liveth I will not leave
[1:07:54] thee so they came to Jericho notice
[1:07:57] Elisha stays with Elijah
[1:08:00] verse 6 Elijah said unto him Terry I
[1:08:02] pray that the Lord has sent me to Jordan
[1:08:04] and he said as the Lord liveth and is
[1:08:06] thy soul liveth I will not leave thee
[1:08:09] and they too went on verse 8 Elijah took
[1:08:12] his mantle and wrapped it together and
[1:08:14] smote the waters here's here they are at
[1:08:16] Jordan also smote the waters and they
[1:08:19] were divided hither and thither so that
[1:08:21] they too went over on dry ground
[1:08:24] came to pass when they were going over
[1:08:26] that Elijah said unto Elisha
[1:08:29] ask
[1:08:31] what I shall do for thee
[1:08:33] in other words whatever you ask now
[1:08:36] Elisha it'll be done
[1:08:39] another word sister Hattie whatever you
[1:08:42] say
[1:08:44] in other words whatever you say right
[1:08:47] now
[1:08:48] and God will grant it to you
[1:08:50] do you know brother Branham said that
[1:08:52] when Hattie spoke those words it moved
[1:08:55] all of Heaven
[1:08:56] you know why because she spoke she
[1:08:58] didn't just think it she used her voice
[1:09:00] you see words have the ability to
[1:09:03] disturb the atmosphere that's around you
[1:09:05] and when a word speaks not a thought but
[1:09:08] when that thoughts expressed through a
[1:09:10] word that atmosphere is Disturbed around
[1:09:12] you and it changes the circumstances
[1:09:15] listen to me somebody you might be
[1:09:17] surrounded by doubt and by fear and all
[1:09:19] hell is coming against you speak the
[1:09:21] word of God it'll change the atmosphere
[1:09:24] around you you think God doesn't care
[1:09:26] about what your voice speaks when you
[1:09:27] say a man to the word of God what are
[1:09:29] you doing you're you're denying that
[1:09:31] doubt around you and you're creating the
[1:09:34] atmosphere of Faith where all things are
[1:09:36] possible
[1:09:37] I believe that kind of anointing's in
[1:09:40] this room right now
[1:09:41] brother Brandon says when she spoke
[1:09:43] those words it felt like the room was
[1:09:45] about to come apart
[1:09:48] and God's brother Branham says God told
[1:09:50] her tell her whatever she asks for right
[1:09:52] now it'll be done Elijah says to Elisha
[1:09:56] ask what I shall do for thee before I be
[1:09:59] taken away from thee and Elisha said
[1:10:01] unto said I prayed he led a double
[1:10:04] portion of thy Spirit be upon me verse
[1:10:06] 10 and he said that was that's the hard
[1:10:08] thing nevertheless if thou see me when I
[1:10:11] am notice this if thou see me when I am
[1:10:15] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[1:10:18] but if not it shall not be so in other
[1:10:23] words Elijah's saying to Elisha when you
[1:10:26] see me when I'm gone if you see me
[1:10:29] Elisha as gone from you
[1:10:33] in other words your perspective Elisha
[1:10:36] has to realize you can't stand here when
[1:10:37] I leave and say oh I just need Elijah
[1:10:39] where's Elijah if Elijah would just come
[1:10:42] back Elisha's got to see Elijah as taken
[1:10:45] from him but there's still a work to do
[1:10:48] there's still a commission to take place
[1:10:50] there's still a work to do for Elisha
[1:10:53] Elisha you've got to see Elijah that
[1:10:55] he's gone from you
[1:10:59] and the Bible says if you see me when
[1:11:01] I'm gone he says it'll be so if you see
[1:11:04] me as I'm gone as you've transliterate
[1:11:06] that that's what it means here and he
[1:11:08] says here in verse 11 and it came to
[1:11:10] pass as they still went on and talked
[1:11:12] and behold there appeared a chariot of
[1:11:13] fire and Horses of fire and parted them
[1:11:16] both asunder and Elijah went up by a
[1:11:18] whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it
[1:11:21] and he cried my father my father the
[1:11:23] chair and the horse Israel and the
[1:11:24] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
[1:11:26] and he took hold of his own clothes and
[1:11:28] ripped them into two pieces and he took
[1:11:30] up also the mantle of Elijah that fell
[1:11:33] from him and went back and stood by the
[1:11:35] bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of
[1:11:38] Elijah that fell from him and smote the
[1:11:40] waters and said not where's Elijah
[1:11:44] but where's the Lord God
[1:11:47] of Elijah Lord Jesus we just bow our
[1:11:50] heads here today Lord as one group of
[1:11:53] people and Eunice and Lord and one mind
[1:11:55] and one Accord father we come from
[1:11:57] different places over the world Lord
[1:11:59] live in different states maybe separated
[1:12:01] some visitors here even today but at
[1:12:04] this moment Lord we're all one family
[1:12:06] all up to your table right now of One
[1:12:10] Spirit of one mind and one Accord Lord
[1:12:12] and we ask you now I've raised my hands
[1:12:15] Lord as some maybe would raise their
[1:12:17] hands by a special need and just say
[1:12:18] Lord I have a special request that I'm
[1:12:21] going to raise it up before you I'm
[1:12:22] going to represent it by a hand and I'm
[1:12:24] going to say Lord my expectation is
[1:12:27] you're going to meet me in this service
[1:12:28] today may you grant it now Lord Jesus we
[1:12:31] ask to every life every individual we
[1:12:33] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:35] Christ amen amen you can be seated
[1:12:41] foreign
[1:12:45] Elijah is going to go home and God's
[1:12:48] going to call him he's coming to the end
[1:12:49] of his ministry he's at the very last
[1:12:52] stages and Elijah knows that very well
[1:12:55] he knows that his days he's about to go
[1:12:57] home and he takes Elijah through this
[1:13:00] Elisha through these cities this was
[1:13:02] specific it wasn't it wasn't you know
[1:13:04] just accidental or random places that
[1:13:06] Elijah was going to take Elisha but it
[1:13:09] takes him to very specific cities and he
[1:13:11] takes them to Jericho and he takes him
[1:13:13] to Bethel what you're reading here in
[1:13:16] Second Kings is some of the last words
[1:13:18] of the of the Prophet Elijah this is
[1:13:22] some of the last moments that Elijah is
[1:13:24] going to have on Earth in this Dimension
[1:13:26] and he's beginning to try he's beginning
[1:13:29] to have a burden come upon his heart you
[1:13:31] know you can read the last words of of
[1:13:34] powerful men and men throughout the
[1:13:35] Bible you read the last words of Elisha
[1:13:38] later on in his life you can read the
[1:13:40] last words of David you could read the
[1:13:42] last words of Jacob and the last words
[1:13:44] of Joseph in the last things that Jacob
[1:13:46] is saying to Joseph is don't leave my
[1:13:49] bones here in in Egypt but take them to
[1:13:51] Canaan to the promised land and then
[1:13:53] Joseph says those same words but what
[1:13:55] you're reading here is the last desires
[1:13:58] as we could say this is the last moments
[1:14:01] that he's going to be alive and he and
[1:14:03] he wants to make sure that he he
[1:14:05] transfers something there there comes
[1:14:08] there there's a moment where there's a
[1:14:11] baton that is going to be passed there's
[1:14:13] going to be a dispensational change that
[1:14:16] the worker the prophets leaving but the
[1:14:18] work is far from Over The Prophet's
[1:14:21] going home but the work is far from
[1:14:23] complete there's many things that still
[1:14:25] must be accomplished and it Elijah no
[1:14:27] doubt knowing the burden you know of the
[1:14:30] the weight of this entire thing he's
[1:14:32] bringing Elisha to these specific cities
[1:14:34] you can imagine just the awestruck
[1:14:37] wonder that a man like Elisha would have
[1:14:39] as he follows Elijah through his
[1:14:41] ministry and was there for some of the
[1:14:43] miraculous things and some of the power
[1:14:45] powerful things and moments of his life
[1:14:48] that were so special to his ministry
[1:14:50] just highlights you can imagine what
[1:14:53] this must have been like for Elisha and
[1:14:56] Elisha had watched as he followed this
[1:14:58] man Elijah and seen the supernatural God
[1:15:01] and he's seen the way that the Lord had
[1:15:03] used him and and he knew that there was
[1:15:06] something special about this mantle that
[1:15:08] Elijah had now Elisha was not going to
[1:15:11] replace Elijah in the sense that he was
[1:15:13] going to do exactly what Elijah did he
[1:15:16] wasn't going to go over and and do the
[1:15:19] same exact Miracles that Elisha was
[1:15:21] going to do though he would have great
[1:15:22] miracles in his life he wasn't going to
[1:15:25] he wasn't going to fulfill what Elijah
[1:15:28] had to fulfill but there was a portion
[1:15:30] of Elisha's Ministry that he had to
[1:15:33] fulfill for himself and he knew that
[1:15:35] there was something about that mantle
[1:15:37] that he lied you you can watch him as
[1:15:39] Elijah tells him and says you know Terry
[1:15:42] here Elisha you know why don't you come
[1:15:45] to Jericho and I want you just to you
[1:15:47] know build a home here Terry here and
[1:15:50] you make a good pastor to these people
[1:15:52] and you know build your house and have
[1:15:54] your children here and you know just
[1:15:55] plant yourself here but Elisha knew as
[1:15:58] long as Elijah was there and there was
[1:16:00] an anointing upon his life I'm staying
[1:16:03] right beside Elijah
[1:16:06] because there's nothing else in the
[1:16:08] world there's nothing else that can
[1:16:10] match it there's nothing else that says
[1:16:11] that that meets the challenge of the
[1:16:14] hour that I live in Elisha had called a
[1:16:16] revelation that Elijah was a specific
[1:16:18] gift and a specific anointing that no
[1:16:22] other man had
[1:16:24] and so he tells him take him to these he
[1:16:27] says come to these cities of Jericho and
[1:16:29] you know this city of Jericho and Bethel
[1:16:31] these are two important crucial cities
[1:16:33] if you study the Bible you'll find that
[1:16:35] Jericho and Bethel are both profound
[1:16:38] cities that God does many miraculous
[1:16:40] things through you can find the city of
[1:16:43] Bethel and Jacob is there and he has a
[1:16:45] dream and a ladder is going from Heaven
[1:16:46] to Earth and there's Angels ascending
[1:16:49] and descending and Jacob wakes up from
[1:16:51] the dream and he says oh surely the Lord
[1:16:53] is in this place and I knew it not and
[1:16:55] and he seen that there was an activity
[1:16:57] of God that's happening all the time
[1:17:00] that never stops that angels are always
[1:17:02] descending and descending upon your half
[1:17:04] behalf and and Jacob makes these Stones
[1:17:07] as a memorial and he he just wants to
[1:17:10] some way memorialize this this spot and
[1:17:12] he anoints it with oil and and he pours
[1:17:15] the oil upon the stones and he calls the
[1:17:18] name of that place Bethlehem God had
[1:17:20] done many miraculous things throughout
[1:17:22] that City even Jericho can we know the
[1:17:25] stories of Jericho and Joshua and some
[1:17:27] of the powerful moments and miraculous
[1:17:29] that takes place even in Elijah's
[1:17:32] Ministry these were moments of great
[1:17:34] Revival these were cities that were on
[1:17:36] fire these were cities that really just
[1:17:38] were on fire for for the fire for the
[1:17:40] power of God
[1:17:41] oh but how different they were
[1:17:44] from the beginning of Elijah's Ministry
[1:17:47] to the end of his ministry
[1:17:50] and now these cities of Bethel and
[1:17:52] Jericho are not on fire they're not in
[1:17:54] Revival they're actually very much
[1:17:56] backslidden in so much that they're even
[1:17:58] in one place Jericho's mocking the
[1:18:01] prophet of God
[1:18:03] that was such a generation that was so
[1:18:05] much worse than what Elijah had
[1:18:07] experienced in his early days of his
[1:18:08] ministry oh when his ministry was first
[1:18:11] beginning my masses came and everybody
[1:18:13] just packed the stadiums to see him and
[1:18:16] they wanted him at their church and
[1:18:17] their pulpit in to see the miraculous
[1:18:19] happen but oh how amazing it changes
[1:18:22] when when Elijah comes to his actual
[1:18:24] Ministry
[1:18:26] and now brother Branham comes to Tucson
[1:18:28] and he says I didn't want to start a
[1:18:29] church here I came here and I came in
[1:18:31] the desert I didn't I didn't want to
[1:18:33] start it on my own I didn't want to
[1:18:34] break any Fellowship I didn't want to
[1:18:36] break anything up but I sat here in the
[1:18:38] desert for three years and you never had
[1:18:40] me preach you never invited me to your
[1:18:42] pulpits and you never had me this wasn't
[1:18:44] my desire to start a assembly but what
[1:18:47] happens doors begin to close at the
[1:18:49] latter part of his ministry and what was
[1:18:52] once widely rejected is now what was
[1:18:56] once widely accepted is now rejected by
[1:18:58] the masses
[1:19:00] and so much that Jesus even in his own
[1:19:03] Ministry would have the same type of
[1:19:05] rejection and would say to this to the
[1:19:07] to the crowds that followed him unless
[1:19:09] you eat the Flesh and drink the blood of
[1:19:11] the son of man you'll have no part with
[1:19:12] him and they said this is a hard saying
[1:19:15] this is a hard saying let me tell you
[1:19:16] something friends to the world if you're
[1:19:19] not a Believer ordained from the
[1:19:20] foundation of the world the message is a
[1:19:22] hard thing it's a hard thing for the
[1:19:25] intellectual mind but if you're anointed
[1:19:27] by the power of God and you're a seed of
[1:19:29] God it's not a hard thing it's the joy
[1:19:32] of our life it's the joy of my of my
[1:19:35] salvation it's the passion of my life
[1:19:37] it's all I have it's all I live for it's
[1:19:40] all that I desire as David said your
[1:19:43] word is my daily portion
[1:19:46] but the doors had begin to close in his
[1:19:48] life and he comes to the end there and
[1:19:50] even brother green when he starts a
[1:19:52] tabernacle he leaves Beaumont Texas and
[1:19:54] he leaves there as a district president
[1:19:56] or something there a superintendent and
[1:19:57] he starts the Tucson Tabernacle you know
[1:20:00] it's so amazing to steering a testimony
[1:20:01] the other day and brother green said the
[1:20:03] reason I started a church in Tucson was
[1:20:06] I wanted an assembly or a building a
[1:20:09] group of people or I could say the name
[1:20:12] William Branham and it wouldn't offend
[1:20:14] anybody
[1:20:16] now you imagine the vision of that day
[1:20:18] and now we have churches I am so glad we
[1:20:21] have bodies of believer all bodies of
[1:20:23] Believers all across the world and we
[1:20:25] can say the name William Branham we
[1:20:27] could preach the message of Malachi 4
[1:20:29] not only does it not offend us brother
[1:20:31] Tim but it excites the very core of our
[1:20:34] being it's our Revival you're attracted
[1:20:37] to it you're magnetized to it it's who
[1:20:39] you are it's your identity
[1:20:43] so Elijah brings him to the very last
[1:20:45] stages of his life here's the last few
[1:20:47] moments and he's coming down to the last
[1:20:50] few things that he's going to say some
[1:20:52] of the last things that he's going to
[1:20:54] mention to Elijah
[1:20:57] and he comes to this place and he and
[1:20:59] Elijah you can see here that there's an
[1:21:02] anointing that must be passed on I
[1:21:05] almost titled this sermon this morning
[1:21:07] the transfer of anointing
[1:21:11] or the transfer of the expectation
[1:21:15] that there must come a transfer of the
[1:21:19] anointing of the expectation or The
[1:21:23] Inheritance that was upon Elijah must
[1:21:26] come upon Elisha
[1:21:28] he cannot live just on the god of the
[1:21:31] pastor the stories of yesterday he that
[1:21:34] won't sustain him that won't meet the
[1:21:35] challenges in fact not only does Elisha
[1:21:39] need to come under the same anointing
[1:21:41] that Elijah had but he actually needs
[1:21:43] twice what Elijah had because now
[1:21:46] there's a generation of people that's
[1:21:48] much more dark and twisted in their mind
[1:21:51] there's an atmosphere that's much worse
[1:21:53] than Elijah's generation and let me just
[1:21:55] stop here for a moment and preach to you
[1:21:57] and tell you you don't just need you say
[1:21:59] brother matter do we need the
[1:22:01] expectation and the anointing and the
[1:22:03] Living God that we see in God's Prophet
[1:22:05] no friends you need double the
[1:22:07] expectation you need twice the Zeal you
[1:22:10] need twice the fervor oh I just say give
[1:22:12] me a church Lord give me a desire that I
[1:22:15] say give me double the power give me
[1:22:17] double the energy give me double the
[1:22:20] Zeal Lord Jesus this is not a generation
[1:22:22] of getting cold or going backwards
[1:22:27] but I say give me an anointing it's a
[1:22:30] double portion of what you have
[1:22:33] he knows that there's something about
[1:22:35] this mentally he knows that there's
[1:22:36] nothing you know within the mantle
[1:22:39] there's nothing necessarily special
[1:22:41] about the fabric or the stitching or the
[1:22:43] kind of materials that they used it was
[1:22:45] not in the the was wasn't in any kind of
[1:22:48] the fabric there was nothing special you
[1:22:50] know listen all those things were good
[1:22:52] the stories are good you know I love the
[1:22:54] stories the hunting stories the fishing
[1:22:56] stories even the stories of of squirrels
[1:22:58] being spoken into existence and I love
[1:23:01] all of those things but listen there was
[1:23:03] nothing in particularly special about
[1:23:06] the mantle itself
[1:23:08] but it was drenched
[1:23:10] with a promise
[1:23:13] it was saturated
[1:23:15] with an anointing
[1:23:17] it was saturated with an expectation it
[1:23:21] was anointed with a faith that didn't
[1:23:22] come from Elijah but it came from
[1:23:24] Jehovah so Elijah it wasn't Elijah's
[1:23:28] message Elijah was just the messenger it
[1:23:31] wasn't brother Branham said it wasn't me
[1:23:32] who appeared there on the Ohio River I
[1:23:35] was just standing there when he appeared
[1:23:37] so it wasn't anything special about the
[1:23:40] mantle itself but it was the anointing
[1:23:42] or the expectation or the promise or the
[1:23:46] pro or the or the scripture you could
[1:23:48] say or the commission that was drenching
[1:23:51] the mantle
[1:23:52] and listen to me friends when Jeremiah
[1:23:55] had a message from God it wasn't
[1:23:56] Jeremiah's message it wasn't Micah's
[1:23:59] message this wasn't their message they
[1:24:00] were simply the messenger
[1:24:02] and so when you rejected Jeremiah you
[1:24:05] weren't rejecting Jeremiah when you
[1:24:07] turned your back on brother Branham
[1:24:09] you're not rejecting brother Branham you
[1:24:11] were rejecting Jehovah
[1:24:15] because this was a thought not from
[1:24:17] Brother Branham it was from the throne
[1:24:19] room of God coming down to a prophet
[1:24:22] that would need to be transferred to a
[1:24:24] people
[1:24:26] are you with me here this morning
[1:24:28] and so he he would say that come to this
[1:24:31] place and and you could you could see
[1:24:33] these are the last words even brother
[1:24:35] Branham comes to what house will you
[1:24:36] build me and he's there in November of
[1:24:38] 1965 some of the last things you can uh
[1:24:41] hear about even over the last few months
[1:24:43] uh just been scouring going through the
[1:24:45] message and and you want to see what
[1:24:47] wanting to see what was on brother
[1:24:48] Brandon's heart what was his fervent
[1:24:51] desire what was he really looking for
[1:24:53] what was his expectation what was it
[1:24:56] that he was reaching for what was it
[1:24:57] that he was wanting to see and he comes
[1:25:00] to that message what house will you
[1:25:01] build me and he begins to say oh friends
[1:25:03] if you feel like I do he says I'm so
[1:25:07] hungry to see the power of God and
[1:25:09] spirit of God moving I can just hardly
[1:25:12] stand it and he says all the experiences
[1:25:14] I had when I was first Saved what is it
[1:25:16] here he's after the seals after the
[1:25:18] after the trumpets after he understands
[1:25:21] uh the trumpets and the true meaning of
[1:25:23] the revelation of the Seven Seals after
[1:25:24] the Mighty God unveiled after 1960 after
[1:25:27] 1963 after 1964 yet there's something
[1:25:31] hungering down on the inside of brother
[1:25:33] Branham oh I say I I resonate so much
[1:25:36] with that quote and I say oh god I've
[1:25:39] served you for this long here we are in
[1:25:41] 2023 but let me just say I am so hungry
[1:25:44] to see the power of God and the spirit
[1:25:47] of God I'm so hungry to see the god of
[1:25:49] the Bible come and make himself manifest
[1:25:52] in my life in my children in my marriage
[1:25:55] in my church in my home I say God I'm so
[1:25:58] hungry I can just hardly stand it
[1:26:04] it comes to this very last spot and he
[1:26:06] says ask what I shall do for thee before
[1:26:10] I be taken from thee
[1:26:13] and without hesitation Elisha answers I
[1:26:16] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[1:26:18] Spirit be upon me and he says thou has
[1:26:21] asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou
[1:26:24] see me notice it wasn't hard for God it
[1:26:26] wasn't hard for Elijah it was only hard
[1:26:28] for Elisha
[1:26:30] because thou has chosen the harder way
[1:26:32] was a way of thy own choosing
[1:26:36] listen this was his choice and we
[1:26:37] preached on it last night it's got to be
[1:26:39] your choice
[1:26:41] and notice he comes to this place and
[1:26:43] here's this expectation you could say
[1:26:45] and here's this here's this expectation
[1:26:48] upon the heart of the of of Elisha and
[1:26:51] this this transfer of anointings got to
[1:26:54] come to him it's got to become more than
[1:26:56] just Elijah's message it's got to become
[1:26:58] Elisha's message it's got to become more
[1:27:01] than just Elijah's Mantle it's got to
[1:27:02] become Elisha's mantle and that same
[1:27:05] faith and that same expectation would
[1:27:07] need to be transferred notice this is
[1:27:10] exactly the same Jordan River that you
[1:27:12] find just years before that and here's
[1:27:15] Mo here's Joshua crossing over the
[1:27:17] Jordan we read about it in in Joshua
[1:27:19] chapter 4 and Joshua chapter 4 he's
[1:27:22] saying take up the stones here they're
[1:27:24] going to Cross Jordan and he says I want
[1:27:26] you to take a place the priests are
[1:27:28] going to come into Jordan and they're
[1:27:29] going to represent something to the rest
[1:27:31] of the people now brother Brandon says
[1:27:33] Jordan types death it types sin you
[1:27:36] could say it types the ultimate death
[1:27:38] and the change of our bodies when death
[1:27:40] is swallowed up in Victory
[1:27:43] and so they're they're representing
[1:27:45] something here as they cross over into
[1:27:46] Jordan and God tells Joshua I want the
[1:27:50] priest to come into the water and he
[1:27:52] says and when the when the souls of the
[1:27:55] priest feet touch Jordan
[1:27:58] Jordan will park
[1:28:00] now notice it's not before this it's not
[1:28:03] when they expect it not when God even
[1:28:04] says it but until they take their foot
[1:28:07] and they put their foot in death or they
[1:28:10] put their foot in what the rest of
[1:28:11] everybody else listen to me they were
[1:28:14] doing something that not the rest of
[1:28:15] everybody would have to do but it was
[1:28:17] their commission it was their place it
[1:28:19] was how God ordained them it was their
[1:28:21] calling or you could say they're
[1:28:22] anointing upon their life was to take
[1:28:25] their foot and put it in Jordan for the
[1:28:27] rest of the people
[1:28:29] and God says I want these priests to go
[1:28:32] into the Jordan and he says when The
[1:28:34] Souls of the Jordan when The Souls of
[1:28:36] the priesthood they would put their foot
[1:28:38] in you imagine now listen they didn't
[1:28:40] have to this the the this is this is not
[1:28:42] made up by their mind it's not they
[1:28:44] didn't think of it of themselves but
[1:28:46] this is God's order
[1:28:48] and God says I want them to take their
[1:28:50] foot and I want them to place it in the
[1:28:53] Jordan and then Jordan
[1:28:55] moves back they take another step
[1:28:58] here's the waters party here's another
[1:29:00] priest and he puts his foot in the water
[1:29:02] and then Waters Jordan just Parts just a
[1:29:05] little bit I want to show you and I
[1:29:07] really hope this is okay to do come here
[1:29:08] I need the ministry team to come here
[1:29:10] just for a moment I want you to stand
[1:29:11] where you're at brother Tim and Timothy
[1:29:13] face him and brother Aaron I want you to
[1:29:15] face brother Joe I want almost like we
[1:29:17] do a prayer line here just face this way
[1:29:19] here right in front of him right in
[1:29:21] front of him I want you to notice come
[1:29:22] here brother Joe stand right beside
[1:29:23] brother Tim brother Aaron I want you to
[1:29:25] notice here this is the order that God
[1:29:27] sets for the Israelites to cross over
[1:29:29] into Canaan face brother Aaron here
[1:29:31] brother Joe and God says I want the
[1:29:33] priests to stand in the water
[1:29:36] I want them because when the priests
[1:29:38] step into the water Jordan's going to
[1:29:40] part and how are the people going to get
[1:29:42] over owned to dry land because priests
[1:29:44] are standing in their Commission in
[1:29:47] their calling they're placing their feet
[1:29:49] in the Jordan on behalf of the rest of
[1:29:52] the body listen to me these ministers
[1:29:54] and these God called men that God's put
[1:29:56] in your life will have to go through
[1:29:58] things that you may never experience you
[1:30:00] have no idea some of the Mind battles
[1:30:02] some of the troubles some of the
[1:30:04] struggles some of the voices that try to
[1:30:06] speak to their mind but this is a place
[1:30:08] in a position when God ordains a man to
[1:30:11] stand in the Jordan it's for the
[1:30:13] protection it's for the anointing it's
[1:30:15] for the Deliverance it's for the victory
[1:30:18] for the people
[1:30:22] Hallelujah
[1:30:24] and God says take your families now that
[1:30:27] Jordan has parted there's a highway
[1:30:28] going through Jordan and so families
[1:30:31] begin to go through and families take
[1:30:33] their little ones and they take the
[1:30:34] husband and the father and they move
[1:30:36] past the Jordan and they go on to dry
[1:30:38] land you say why do they cross on Joy
[1:30:40] like dry land because there's a priest
[1:30:42] who's got his foot in the water he's
[1:30:45] standing in the gap for the rest of the
[1:30:47] congregation
[1:30:54] and I just want to represent her for a
[1:30:56] moment do you realize what would happen
[1:30:59] if preachers stop preaching
[1:31:02] do you realize what would happen if
[1:31:04] these preachers took their foot out of
[1:31:06] the Jordan
[1:31:07] sin would cover our churches it would
[1:31:10] flood our pulpits listen to me friends
[1:31:12] if preachers really did put down their
[1:31:14] notes and close their iPads and their
[1:31:16] laptops and stop studying the word of
[1:31:18] God sin would flood our churches it
[1:31:20] would flood our homes you want to thank
[1:31:22] God this morning that you've got a
[1:31:24] Ministry that'll keep their fruit in the
[1:31:27] water
[1:31:30] I say brother stay in the water stay in
[1:31:33] Jordan stay in your commission stay in
[1:31:36] your anointing it'll get us home someday
[1:31:40] Hallelujah
[1:31:42] stay under the anointing stay under the
[1:31:44] preaching of the word of God
[1:31:46] I'm just going to stay here and state my
[1:31:48] claim and say I'm not taking my foot out
[1:31:50] of Jordan I don't care what others say I
[1:31:53] don't care others who are compromising
[1:31:55] I'm going to keep my feet planted and
[1:31:57] send the Jordan River
[1:32:00] you say how long brother Matt until it's
[1:32:02] finished
[1:32:03] until the work has finished God bless
[1:32:05] you Brothers why don't you give him a
[1:32:07] hand this morning say thank God for a
[1:32:09] Ministry
[1:32:12] hallelujah oh do we have a church
[1:32:14] that'll say preach it to me Pastor
[1:32:17] preach me the word of God don't
[1:32:19] compromise for anybody don't compromise
[1:32:22] for any Spirit preach me that Full
[1:32:25] Gospel
[1:32:26] I say thank God for a Ministry that I'll
[1:32:29] preach it bare knuckled straight truth
[1:32:31] and not compromise they don't tell me
[1:32:34] regardless if it hurts my feelings the
[1:32:36] truth of the word
[1:32:40] now notice this is going to be important
[1:32:42] because he says I want you to take the
[1:32:44] stone his foot was here Joshua take the
[1:32:48] stone that he stood upon not just any
[1:32:50] storm but that left Manasseh and here's
[1:32:53] all the tribes are represented each man
[1:32:54] of trump and here's Reuben and here's
[1:32:57] his foot and the priest priest is
[1:32:59] representing that tribe he says his
[1:33:01] right foot was here so they take a stone
[1:33:04] his left foot was here and they'd take a
[1:33:07] stone no no I think it was right it
[1:33:08] wasn't over here it was right there
[1:33:10] right there and he takes that stone and
[1:33:12] he places that stone and what is it it's
[1:33:14] going to be a memorial say why is that
[1:33:15] important brother Matt why couldn't
[1:33:17] there just be any stone why couldn't it
[1:33:18] just be anything why couldn't this be
[1:33:20] any old Doctrine any old thing that's
[1:33:21] preached no friends
[1:33:23] these were going to be the original
[1:33:25] faith of what the priest stood upon of
[1:33:28] what they believed of what they preached
[1:33:30] of what they lived
[1:33:32] because brother random said it would be
[1:33:34] these divinely revealed truths that will
[1:33:37] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:33:40] children back to the faith of the
[1:33:42] Pentecostal fathers back to 80 33 back
[1:33:46] to the supernatural back to the
[1:33:48] expectation back to Victory
[1:33:52] it'll be these stones that represent
[1:33:55] something
[1:33:56] there's going to be a certain promise
[1:33:58] there's going to be an anointing and
[1:34:00] nothing else will turn your hearts back
[1:34:01] no other ministry will turn your heart
[1:34:04] back listen to me friends no other
[1:34:06] Ministry had the ministry of Elijah
[1:34:08] because he was anointed with a message
[1:34:10] to turn your hearts back
[1:34:14] and you couldn't get it anywhere else
[1:34:16] Elisha knew that I'm not going to leave
[1:34:18] I'm tearing right by your side you
[1:34:20] couldn't get it there was good preachers
[1:34:21] good doctors of divinity great meetings
[1:34:23] good things that were happening but
[1:34:25] there was only one Elijah Ministry
[1:34:30] let me just stop here and say there's
[1:34:32] only one group of people who can receive
[1:34:35] that Elijah message
[1:34:37] that's a special group A peculiar group
[1:34:40] a royal priesthood a holy nation do you
[1:34:44] realize you've been ordained to receive
[1:34:46] the anointing of the message of Malachi
[1:34:49] 4.
[1:34:50] you say brother Matt what does that mean
[1:34:52] that means our churches and our people
[1:34:54] are drenched with a promise of oil
[1:34:56] they're drinks with a promise you say
[1:34:58] what promise a victory of overcoming of
[1:35:02] power of healthy bodies of healthy
[1:35:04] churches
[1:35:06] come on help me preach somebody you're
[1:35:09] anointed this morning you've got an
[1:35:11] anointing upon your life
[1:35:13] you've been anointed to believe the word
[1:35:15] of God that's why you pull on the word
[1:35:16] of God it isn't a workup it isn't just
[1:35:19] because we're shouting up here you're
[1:35:20] anointed to believe it
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:24] that's why when a preacher preaches I'm
[1:35:25] not up here preaching anything new to
[1:35:27] you I'm not up here giving you some kind
[1:35:29] of new revelation I'm only stirring
[1:35:30] what's already down on the inside of you
[1:35:34] and when you hear it you identify and
[1:35:37] you say yes brother that's me I identify
[1:35:40] with that message
[1:35:45] that's my message
[1:35:46] that's my anointing
[1:35:49] that's my promise
[1:35:52] Elisha you must come under the anointing
[1:35:55] you must come under the expectation it's
[1:35:59] got to be it's got to leave and be
[1:36:01] righteously it's going to leave Elijah's
[1:36:03] lips and it's got to come upon your lips
[1:36:05] that's why brother Brandon said the word
[1:36:06] of God on the lips of Believers he said
[1:36:09] it's never failed on the mouths of his
[1:36:11] believing family why it's the promise of
[1:36:15] Jesus that's been transferred off of
[1:36:18] this Bible down into the faith of your
[1:36:21] heart and you accept it and you believe
[1:36:23] it and then it becomes your reality
[1:36:28] you know this is what an anointing was
[1:36:32] an anointing is that charismatic would
[1:36:34] use that word in the cliche and there's
[1:36:36] a very very great truth to it but it's
[1:36:37] almost just become an anoint and it's
[1:36:39] just an annoying today they're all of
[1:36:41] there they don't know really no you say
[1:36:42] brother Matt isn't a true anointing well
[1:36:43] brother Branham said that it certainly
[1:36:45] was
[1:36:46] but you know what a you know what a real
[1:36:48] anointing was in the Bible and I won't
[1:36:50] try to pronounce this word
[1:36:52] but in anointing it was to smear we
[1:36:56] spoke on this last night it was to smear
[1:36:59] or to rub
[1:37:01] with oil
[1:37:03] you would take a king who was going to
[1:37:05] be anointed to be king and they would
[1:37:06] take oil and they'd pour it on him and
[1:37:08] they'd anoint his life what were they
[1:37:10] doing they were commissioning him for a
[1:37:12] purpose he was going to serve a very
[1:37:14] special purpose he was going to serve a
[1:37:17] very special commission they would
[1:37:18] anoint men like this and they were
[1:37:20] anointing them or consecrating that
[1:37:22] office for service in Bible times people
[1:37:25] were Anointed with oil to signify God's
[1:37:28] blessing or the call upon that person's
[1:37:30] life in Exodus and second Kings and
[1:37:33] Ecclesiastes they were anointed for a
[1:37:36] special purpose or a special Mission or
[1:37:39] a special job with special Specific
[1:37:42] Instructions
[1:37:46] and so Elijah you can even see this here
[1:37:48] as David Praises I think it's Psalms 133
[1:37:51] and you could read about it and David
[1:37:53] says oh how precious it is when Brethren
[1:37:55] dwelled together in unity it's like the
[1:37:58] oil that flowed from Aaron's head
[1:38:02] down to his beard
[1:38:05] all the way down to the collar of his
[1:38:07] shirt down to the urum and thumbem
[1:38:10] all the way down to the ground
[1:38:13] this is what the oil of anointing was to
[1:38:15] do you say why brother man because in
[1:38:18] that high priest or that the high priest
[1:38:20] who would go on the day of Yom Kippur
[1:38:22] and he would enter in with that tablet
[1:38:25] he would take that urum and thumb him
[1:38:27] and then that urum was not just pretty
[1:38:29] Stones here was the topaz and the
[1:38:31] carbuncle and the barrel and the Onyx
[1:38:33] and the Sardis and all of these these
[1:38:35] weren't just fancy stones or beautiful
[1:38:36] stones but the stones were representing
[1:38:40] a tribe
[1:38:41] and within that tribe represented a
[1:38:44] family
[1:38:46] and within that family was a dad
[1:38:49] and a mom
[1:38:51] and children
[1:38:52] and needs and prayer requests and issues
[1:38:56] and problems and diseases both in the
[1:38:59] body and in the mind
[1:39:01] and so Yom Kippur Aaron the high priest
[1:39:03] would take that tablet and that tablet
[1:39:06] when he would go into the holiest of
[1:39:08] holies on the day of atonement and what
[1:39:11] was he doing he was representing all of
[1:39:14] the people he was representing all of
[1:39:17] the families he was representing all of
[1:39:19] the issues he was representing all of
[1:39:22] the prayer requests everything that they
[1:39:23] had as an expectation or a need in their
[1:39:25] life and that oil would flow it would
[1:39:28] move or help you catch it here this
[1:39:30] morning it would flow from the head not
[1:39:32] just it wasn't in an oil that was just
[1:39:34] kind of going to come upon the high
[1:39:35] priest but that oil would flow into the
[1:39:37] tablet it would flow over all the
[1:39:40] families what was it representing that
[1:39:42] that oil had to go from the high priest
[1:39:44] it had to go from the preacher down into
[1:39:47] the people's lives that you would come
[1:39:49] under the same anointing and the same
[1:39:51] power to serve the same God with the
[1:39:53] same promise for your life I say today
[1:39:56] you're anointed it's not just Ministry
[1:39:58] the ministry has an anointing but you've
[1:40:00] got an anointed and in your life as a
[1:40:02] Believer to take the word of God and
[1:40:04] Conquer The Devil in your family and in
[1:40:06] your home
[1:40:08] you've been commissioned and anointed
[1:40:12] by the anointing oil
[1:40:19] can we go a little further this morning
[1:40:21] you love the Lord
[1:40:24] that oil was going to represent
[1:40:26] something that was going to transfer
[1:40:27] something
[1:40:29] you notice here even brother Brandon
[1:40:30] begins to talk about this and the
[1:40:32] message why Christ speak
[1:40:33] and notice brother Branham says here he
[1:40:35] says may the Holy Spirit we paraphrase
[1:40:38] this last night May the Holy Spirit
[1:40:40] teach us today the things that we ought
[1:40:43] to know and may we then in return listen
[1:40:46] closely to every word may we listen
[1:40:49] closely to every word may we weigh it
[1:40:52] deeply and then may those who are
[1:40:53] listening by the way of take Bay they
[1:40:56] listen close
[1:40:59] may we be able to catch what the holy
[1:41:04] spirit is trying to reveal to us let me
[1:41:08] just make you aware the holy spirit is
[1:41:11] always trying to reveal himself to you
[1:41:15] personally
[1:41:17] I say oh God don't let me miss it this
[1:41:19] morning oh God let me pay attention and
[1:41:22] listen up close how many with me would
[1:41:24] say Lord if you're trying to speak let
[1:41:27] me hear it in My Heart Lord Jesus
[1:41:29] let me not miss it how many times would
[1:41:31] brother Brandon say that in his sermons
[1:41:32] don't miss it
[1:41:35] come to a sister from a prayer line
[1:41:36] sister don't miss it come to his sermon
[1:41:39] don't miss it don't miss what the holy
[1:41:41] spirit's trying to reveal before we
[1:41:44] realize if he should anoint us then the
[1:41:45] anointed is not in vain it's for a
[1:41:47] purpose
[1:41:50] it might work to the good to the Lord
[1:41:52] and may our hearts an understanding be
[1:41:55] open Lord he knows how to do these
[1:41:58] things and how to deal with man he knows
[1:42:00] what's in man
[1:42:03] he knows what you say how does he know
[1:42:07] because he's the one who put it there
[1:42:12] you didn't
[1:42:14] he knows what's inside of you
[1:42:16] he says he knows we don't we only know
[1:42:18] from the intellectual side he knows
[1:42:20] what's really in the man and he knows
[1:42:24] listen to what brother Brandon says he
[1:42:25] knows he says Moses was born in this
[1:42:28] world and a gifted boy he was born to be
[1:42:30] a prophet a deliverer he was born born
[1:42:33] born
[1:42:36] with the equipment
[1:42:38] born inside of him
[1:42:42] born already before you ever breathed
[1:42:45] your first breath God knew every trial
[1:42:48] you'd go through God knew every
[1:42:50] circumstance that you would face in your
[1:42:52] life listen to me you might have thought
[1:42:54] oh that's just Misfortune it just
[1:42:55] happened to me listen God has ordained
[1:42:58] the footsteps of your life before you
[1:43:00] were ever born he knew every trial he
[1:43:02] knew every sorrow he knew every
[1:43:04] heartache he knew everything you'd have
[1:43:06] to go through as his son or his daughter
[1:43:09] and he's equipped you
[1:43:11] for the job

[1:43:15] for somebody here this morning you're
[1:43:17] already equipped for the job it's

[1:43:23] for your answer somewhere else or
[1:43:25] somewhere down the street it's already

[1:43:32] confess it
[1:43:33] [Applause]
[1:43:35] it's already there
[1:43:37] brother Brandon would go so far as to
[1:43:39] say everything you have need of for this
[1:43:41] life's journey even the rapture
[1:43:46] it's already inside the seed of God that
[1:43:49] he placed before the foundation of the
[1:43:50] world you say brother Matt why does that
[1:43:52] make you excited that means if I didn't
[1:43:54] have anything to do with it to start
[1:43:56] then I can't have anything to do with it
[1:43:57] to stop it if I didn't start it I can't
[1:44:00] stop it it's Unstoppable it's the
[1:44:03] Unstoppable power of God and nothing I
[1:44:05] can do will change that no height no
[1:44:08] give no sorrow no sickness no death

[1:44:16] and say Satan you can't stop it oh hell
[1:44:20] can't stop it all the powers of Darkness
[1:44:22] can't stop it
[1:44:25] I'm Anointed with a prop I'm Anointed
[1:44:27] with an equipment if it was already

[1:44:31] raise those kids I don't want to be a
[1:44:33] mom don't know how to be a dad it's
[1:44:34] already inside of you
[1:44:36] [Applause]
[1:44:38] the equipment's already there
[1:44:42] listen none of us could give our kids
[1:44:43] the Holy Ghost
[1:44:45] none of us
[1:44:46] if I had a big red button that you could
[1:44:48] come up and push and it would give your
[1:44:50] kids the Holy Ghost I guarantee you
[1:44:52] would have a stampede an evening like
[1:44:53] Tabernacle you'd have moms and dads
[1:44:56] jumping over the pews and getting to
[1:44:57] that button if you could give them the
[1:44:59] Holy Ghost I promise you would
[1:45:04] how many moms would say Amen to that
[1:45:06] I'd give them it too much you know what
[1:45:08] God didn't give you that ability God
[1:45:10] didn't give you that place he didn't
[1:45:12] commission you that way you say then
[1:45:14] what can I do brother Matt what weapons
[1:45:15] do I have
[1:45:16] preach it to him tell it to him teach it
[1:45:20] to him bring them to church bring them
[1:45:22] in the right atmosphere so the word of
[1:45:25] God in their hearts the seeds already
[1:45:28] there all it needs is the right
[1:45:31] atmosphere all it needs is for that
[1:45:33] light to strike a cross tip listen mom
[1:45:36] and dad you can't give it to them but
[1:45:38] you can preach it to them you can live
[1:45:39] it before them you can talk it to them
[1:45:41] you could show them you could bring them
[1:45:43] to the house of God and then put your
[1:45:46] faith in a promise
[1:45:49] that when the anointed word of God
[1:45:51] flashes across that seed all hell can't
[1:45:54] stop it from coming forth he'll say
[1:45:57] Lazarus counselor
[1:46:01] and I don't care how dead they are I
[1:46:03] don't care how distant they are I don't
[1:46:05] care if they're not in this service
[1:46:07] today
[1:46:08] all hell can't stop it Mom oh hell can't
[1:46:12] stop it Dad
[1:46:15] Hallelujah
[1:46:18] the word of God on the mouths of
[1:46:19] believing Christians has never failed I
[1:46:22] say confess it today
[1:46:24] speak it today
[1:46:30] why did Hattie Wright ask for her
[1:46:32] children why did Hattie ask for her
[1:46:34] children so you mom could ask for your
[1:46:37] child so that you would have faith to
[1:46:39] transfer that promise from a little
[1:46:41] humble woman
[1:46:42] down into your family into your home you
[1:46:45] sit by the map but they're not even here
[1:46:46] today they're not even serving the lord
[1:46:48] you don't know how distant you don't
[1:46:49] know how far you don't know what they've
[1:46:51] said you don't know what they've done
[1:46:52] you don't know the circumstances you
[1:46:53] don't know the past you know what
[1:46:55] brother Brandon said he said if you're
[1:46:56] sick this morning and you're in a sick
[1:46:58] body he said what you do is you imagine
[1:47:02] a well-body
[1:47:04] and you start walking towards it
[1:47:06] I say today if your children are not
[1:47:09] here you imagine them at this altar you
[1:47:11] imagine them with hands raised you
[1:47:13] imagine them shouting and start walking
[1:47:16] towards your promise
[1:47:18] start walking towards your Victory say
[1:47:21] God it's my inheritance this is my
[1:47:23] promise Lord I'm not gonna stop I'm not
[1:47:26] gonna quit I'm not gonna give up
[1:47:32] let me just tell you what the Holy
[1:47:34] Spirit told me in that office
[1:47:36] and I'm going to believe it because I've
[1:47:37] said it when I preached the sermon and
[1:47:38] the Holy Spirit came to me and spoke to
[1:47:40] me and said tell somebody in this church
[1:47:42] today don't give up on your promise
[1:47:47] now you accept that as from the Lord
[1:47:49] don't give up on your promise I don't
[1:47:52] care how many years it's been I don't
[1:47:54] care how many months it's been and don't
[1:47:56] let the devil reinterpret it and say
[1:47:58] it'll be different it's not going to be
[1:48:00] that way God said I'll do it
[1:48:03] outperform it
[1:48:05] just the way I spoke it
[1:48:09] I'm going to do it exactly like I told
[1:48:11] you Sarah I'm going to do it exactly
[1:48:14] like I told you
[1:48:15] I'm going to perform it you're anointed
[1:48:18] to believe it
[1:48:21] [Applause]
[1:48:23] do you realize this is why brother
[1:48:25] Brandon would speak to a storm
[1:48:28] so that you'd speak to your story
[1:48:31] this is why he would had he would have a
[1:48:33] little woman and say God what do you
[1:48:35] want anything you say right now
[1:48:37] and she said the salvation of my boys
[1:48:40] why so that I could have faith
[1:48:43] for my children
[1:48:45] I say don't give up on your promise
[1:48:56] he's born with the equipment already
[1:49:01] as every man comes into the world is
[1:49:03] born with this equipment
[1:49:05] Moses born and he was afterwards he was
[1:49:07] brought to the place where he was
[1:49:08] anointed and notice the seed laying
[1:49:09] there with an intellectual conception
[1:49:10] with all the faith the more he was born
[1:49:12] to deliver this people and yet it never
[1:49:13] came to life until that light from the
[1:49:16] burning bush flashed across it until he
[1:49:18] seen not something he read about
[1:49:21] I love this so much not something he
[1:49:24] just read about
[1:49:26] something he's seen with his eyes
[1:49:29] something that spoke to him
[1:49:32] and he spoke back to it
[1:49:34] oh I said God give our young people give
[1:49:37] our families give me that kind of
[1:49:39] experience
[1:49:40] something that he spoke to and something
[1:49:43] that spoke back
[1:49:45] oh how that did bring I think any man or
[1:49:47] woman or boy or girl think about an
[1:49:48] intellectual conception of what they
[1:49:49] think the word is and so forth can never
[1:49:51] have a full Foundation stand until they
[1:49:54] have met that light let me tell you you
[1:49:57] can hang a picture of the pillar of fire
[1:49:58] and that's wonderful but until you meet
[1:50:01] that light for yourself until that light
[1:50:03] comes and anoints your life
[1:50:06] I say God
[1:50:10] how many would pray that and say Lord
[1:50:11] anoint my life
[1:50:13] anoint My Faith Lord Jesus
[1:50:18] he says here notice he says no hundreds
[1:50:20] and hundreds of years before this Israel
[1:50:22] be mistreated sojourn and strange come
[1:50:24] to him and stay there 400 years but God
[1:50:25] with the mighty hand would bring them
[1:50:26] out so you see with this Burning Bush
[1:50:27] just as we know
[1:50:30] um as a man asked me a few moments ago
[1:50:32] about the coming and the Rapture now
[1:50:35] notice what he goes to I want you to pay
[1:50:36] attention closer
[1:50:38] a man asked me about the coming in the
[1:50:40] rapture we know we've lived the time out
[1:50:44] I'm the time of the Rapture is that hand
[1:50:49] what was brother random looking for
[1:50:52] what was the prophet of God looking for
[1:50:54] what was brother Branham seeking he says
[1:50:57] and we're looking
[1:50:59] for rapturing faith
[1:51:01] that can pull the church together and
[1:51:04] give it some
[1:51:05] Supernatural strength
[1:51:08] to give it some super natural strength
[1:51:12] you know what that means in the Bible
[1:51:13] when it's at hand
[1:51:15] do you know what that means the kingdom
[1:51:16] of God is at hand it means it's within
[1:51:21] your reach
[1:51:24] I hope you catch it here this morning
[1:51:27] that promise that's been coming a long
[1:51:29] time is now at hand it's within your
[1:51:33] grasp it's within your reach brother
[1:51:36] Adam says what's he doing every day he's
[1:51:39] reaching every day he's looking you say
[1:51:41] brother Matt what are you doing every
[1:51:42] day of my life I'm reaching to say God

[1:52:14] my back pain just said hey man oh my
[1:52:17] body how many bodies could say Amen I'm

[1:52:31] when we see a god
[1:52:33] that can raise the dead off the floor or
[1:52:37] out in the yard and bring him back to
[1:52:39] life again and present him before us
[1:52:42] when we see a God who can take a cancer
[1:52:45] that's ate a man to a shadow and raise
[1:52:48] him up to a strong healthy man that
[1:52:54] did you catch it
[1:52:56] what ought to give you
[1:52:58] rapturing faith
[1:53:01] brother random points to a man who is
[1:53:03] dead
[1:53:04] dead
[1:53:05] and he's raised to life
[1:53:07] he points to a man who has cancer and
[1:53:11] all hope is lost and all doctors have
[1:53:13] given up and there's no chance for him
[1:53:16] and brother Brandon points to these two
[1:53:18] examples and said that
[1:53:21] ought to give us rapturing Faith what
[1:53:24] ought to give the church rapturing Faith
[1:53:27] what do you see here brother Matt I see
[1:53:29] here that it's going to take something
[1:53:30] that's apart from me that has listen
[1:53:33] it's impossible you said brother man is
[1:53:35] it impossible with man it's impossible
[1:53:37] but With God all things are possible I'm
[1:53:39] more convinced now more than I ever been
[1:53:41] in my life the same power that heals
[1:53:44] your body is the same power that will
[1:53:47] sweep over your body one day and it'll
[1:53:49] change you from the very Atomic level
[1:53:51] the same power to believe in Divine
[1:53:54] Healing and heal your body is the same
[1:53:56] power that'll sweep over our bodies one
[1:53:58] day and change it in the moment in the
[1:54:01] twinkling of it
[1:54:03] it's got to be something if the faith
[1:54:06] that saved me was nothing I can do of
[1:54:08] myself it'll have to be the same faith
[1:54:11] changes my body
[1:54:13] he says it's a man
[1:54:15] we see of cancer and he's raised up you
[1:54:19] know we just experienced that back home
[1:54:21] in our little town I know Supernatural
[1:54:23] things are happening listen not just
[1:54:25] here not just there but all around the
[1:54:27] world you say brother Matt why are these
[1:54:28] Supernatural events taking place because
[1:54:30] the prophet of God said when all hell
[1:54:33] turns loose all Heaven turn
[1:54:37] Limitless preach for a moment listen to
[1:54:40] me Satan is not unborn he's as bold as
[1:54:42] he's ever been he's right out in the
[1:54:44] open he's right out there arrogantly
[1:54:46] bowed and shown himself and he doesn't
[1:54:49] hide it anymore doesn't hide it
[1:54:50] somewhere in a closet it's right out in
[1:54:52] the open I just have to believe that if
[1:54:55] the devil wants to manifest himself out
[1:54:57] in the open I just happen to believe
[1:54:59] that all Heaven has a desire to manifest
[1:55:03] itself all out in the open
[1:55:07] step when all hell turns loose Oh Heaven
[1:55:10] let's go I say let go Heaven I say let
[1:55:14] go angels
[1:55:16] I say poured out God pour it out upon me
[1:55:19] pour it upon my family pour it upon my
[1:55:23] children pour it upon my mind pour it
[1:55:25] upon my spirit oh God
[1:55:32] he's manifested himself
[1:55:36] say brother Matt you believe it's going
[1:55:37] to get more and more I already know it's
[1:55:39] more and more
[1:55:40] and it ain't gonna stop there it's going
[1:55:42] to keep on going it's going to keep on
[1:55:44] moving until this body changes
[1:55:47] until my mind until my flesh until my
[1:55:51] all of my troubles are changed in a
[1:55:53] moment
[1:55:55] they sing about it today oh that
[1:55:58] anointing he anoints me my cup runneth
[1:56:00] over you say brother Matt what anointing
[1:56:02] an anointing of rapture in faith an
[1:56:04] anointing that can change your vile body

[1:56:22] testimony you'd have to hear it but some
[1:56:24] of these brothers can testify I mean 13
[1:56:27] 14 years ago he came to the message and
[1:56:30] boy if he's you say brother Matt how's
[1:56:31] his fire it was a fire then it's an
[1:56:33] inferno now
[1:56:35] because he did the brother Travis has
[1:56:37] just got such a faith just such a faith
[1:56:39] to believe in the word of God came was
[1:56:42] searching for God his whole life you
[1:56:43] know from even from the time he was just
[1:56:45] a little boy maybe 14 years old started
[1:56:47] reading this Bible mom and dad his dad
[1:56:49] was a bastard deacon at the Beaufort
[1:56:51] Baptist Church his family was religious
[1:56:53] lived in a good home and and Travis just
[1:56:55] began to seek the Lord and begins to
[1:56:57] read the Bible and he he goes to the New
[1:56:59] Testament he reads during the gospels
[1:57:01] and then he reads through the book of
[1:57:02] Acts and he reads all of Paul's letters
[1:57:04] and and he's saying this is where's
[1:57:06] these people he goes to he goes to his
[1:57:08] pastor and of a church there and he goes
[1:57:11] to the youth leader and he says you know
[1:57:12] you people are wonderful lovely people
[1:57:14] he says but where's the god I read about
[1:57:16] in the Bible
[1:57:18] where's the where's the Performing of
[1:57:20] where's the men who are filled with the
[1:57:22] Holy Ghost
[1:57:24] where are these men that are filled with
[1:57:25] the spirit of God like Peter like
[1:57:27] Stephen and he could say with his eye
[1:57:29] he'd be in full of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:33] where's these men that are filled and
[1:57:35] where's the Miracles where's the Wonders
[1:57:36] and signs that we see why don't we see
[1:57:38] you people are good Christians you know
[1:57:40] that you lead her he'd go from church to
[1:57:41] church man he'd go from church the
[1:57:43] church the church that he was a church
[1:57:45] Opera
[1:57:47] true bona fide Church Chopper
[1:57:49] and you go to that youth pastor that
[1:57:51] Pastor and he'd say where's and they'd
[1:57:52] always say Travis said they'd say the
[1:57:54] same exact thing every single time it
[1:57:55] was like a parrot every single time
[1:57:57] they'd say well brother Travis those are
[1:57:58] wonderful things you read about in the
[1:58:00] Bible but you see the apostolic days are
[1:58:02] over that doesn't happen anymore and the
[1:58:05] days of Miracles are over listen this is
[1:58:08] exactly what they tried to tell brother
[1:58:10] Brandon
[1:58:11] almost identical verbatim of what these
[1:58:13] men were saying it goes to the mega
[1:58:15] church of our of our back home big old
[1:58:17] non-denominational massive mega church
[1:58:19] and he goes to that Pastor gets a minute
[1:58:21] with him tells him what about men we
[1:58:23] read about in the Bible what about Holy
[1:58:25] Ghost Field men
[1:58:26] oh brother Travis
[1:58:28] you know those were all good days and
[1:58:30] those were those where God was doing
[1:58:32] special things then but he's spoken
[1:58:34] again at Sun Dry times through his you
[1:58:36] know through the prophets but now he's
[1:58:37] spoken to us by his son and and you know
[1:58:39] and and and those days are over brother
[1:58:41] Travis we don't really believe in though
[1:58:43] you don't see those kind of things now
[1:58:44] it's just a faith that you believe and
[1:58:45] you just accepted and you just confess
[1:58:48] it and repeat the sinner's prayer and
[1:58:50] then you you know and Travis said that
[1:58:52] just didn't sit right with me
[1:58:54] he said I just I heard them but then I'd
[1:58:56] read the Bible at home and say something
[1:58:57] ain't right here

[2:05:06] I said absolutely brother Travis I said
[2:05:08] just so happened that was Saturday just
[2:05:11] so happened I was preaching the next day
[2:05:14] just so happened I had been studying the
[2:05:16] book what cancer is
[2:05:20] you ever read that sermon called healing
[2:05:22] what cancer is so I was already man a
[2:05:24] loaded gun had every bit of thing I
[2:05:26] wanted to say
[2:05:28] and I've been discouring that but was
[2:05:30] going to preach on something entirely
[2:05:31] you know but that book was my main theme
[2:05:33] and just read through it I said we're
[2:05:35] going to go there so we go to this man's
[2:05:37] house in his living room and and I just
[2:05:39] began to as we walked into that room you
[2:05:41] could see Marcus and there this was not
[2:05:43] the same man I had seen I mean he was
[2:05:45] just curled over and shriveled up just
[2:05:48] real weak looking and hair was gone and
[2:05:51] just uh you know real weak had a tumor
[2:05:53] about the size of a grapefruit off of
[2:05:55] his neck
[2:05:56] and he sat sitting there and his
[2:05:59] family's there and and we we knock on
[2:06:01] the door she lets us in we go up and and
[2:06:03] we I look at him and there's another
[2:06:04] family there is trustee from his church
[2:06:06] and and and they're a cancer son had
[2:06:09] passed away from cancer she's a advocate
[2:06:11] for you cancer research and she's there
[2:06:13] and there the scene we walked in was
[2:06:15] just real you're almost deaf
[2:06:19] it was just real real low and and just
[2:06:22] didn't have much hope
[2:06:23] and so I didn't really know how to you
[2:06:25] know what we were going to do we sit
[2:06:26] there we're waiting and and so Travis
[2:06:29] asked him said Marcus what is it you
[2:06:30] know what have they said he said well
[2:06:32] you know Travis they've they've given up
[2:06:34] Pope he said I just I didn't want to die
[2:06:36] this way but you know it's appointed
[2:06:37] unto every man he's just resigned to the
[2:06:39] fact he's going to die tried chemo eight
[2:06:42] times and you know he said it's just
[2:06:43] it's felt he said and you know I just uh
[2:06:46] he said I I don't know he said I don't
[2:06:48] know what to do he said it's just it's
[2:06:50] the end for me you know and and Travis
[2:06:52] said well Marcus he says you know I just
[2:06:55] want to can I talk to you for a minute
[2:06:56] he said I just have some things I want
[2:06:58] to say upon my heart and he said he said
[2:07:01] I just want to tell you and we began to
[2:07:02] Travis begin to talk and he and he says
[2:07:04] I you know you're wonderful people and
[2:07:06] you're good people and he says but I
[2:07:08] just feel like since you've got a death
[2:07:10] sentence he said and you're going to die
[2:07:12] I said I just I just don't figure
[2:07:14] there's any sense in mints and words I'm
[2:07:16] just going to be real straight and tell
[2:07:17] you exactly you know how I feel and he
[2:07:20] says you know Marcus when I was at your
[2:07:21] church and he said and I left your
[2:07:23] church he said I was seeking for
[2:07:24] something he said I was there looking
[2:07:26] for a real God who who was the he said a
[2:07:28] God who was still alive the god of the
[2:07:30] Bible that we read about he said I was
[2:07:32] looking for a men that were filled with
[2:07:34] the Holy Ghost it never made sense to
[2:07:36] him how he'd go to the church and then
[2:07:38] in the deacons were outside smoking a
[2:07:40] cigarette and that night they'd have a
[2:07:41] social drink he said it just never made
[2:07:43] any sense to me how you know these are
[2:07:44] Christian supposed Christian men he said
[2:07:47] but I knew that there was something more
[2:07:48] Marcus and he said and I want to tell
[2:07:50] you I found that something more and he
[2:07:53] said I found a supernatural God who's
[2:07:55] still alive today who still raises the
[2:07:57] dead he still heals the sick he still
[2:07:59] fills with the Holy Ghost and he said
[2:08:01] he's still got the power of God he said
[2:08:03] there's an Apostolic power that's been
[2:08:05] restored there's seven Church ages and
[2:08:07] seven Messengers and and he said and I
[2:08:09] just want to tell you God is not in your
[2:08:11] denomination he's a that's a dead God he
[2:08:14] said he's not in your Trinity of gods
[2:08:16] I'm thinking my goodness
[2:08:20] he just laid it all on them I didn't
[2:08:24] know what he was going to say and I'm
[2:08:25] just going
[2:08:26] whoa
[2:08:27] he's not in your Trinity that's a that's
[2:08:29] a false Doctrine he's been revealed as a
[2:08:31] you know and Travis just starts to
[2:08:33] really lay it upon him and I'm just
[2:08:35] wondering how he's going to take it you
[2:08:36] know and he's he's been revealed and
[2:08:38] he's a real God and God can raise you
[2:08:40] from the dead God can heal you from that
[2:08:42] cancer I don't care how hopeless it is
[2:08:45] and here's my friend Matt why don't you
[2:08:47] talk with Matt
[2:08:58] I said well and Travis said Marcus he
[2:09:01] said I hope I didn't offend you he said
[2:09:02] I Travis if you knew he was this real
[2:09:04] sincere guy he about he said he said
[2:09:06] Marcus he said I didn't I I didn't mean
[2:09:09] to air I hope nothing I said hurt you or
[2:09:11] hurt your feelings I believe you're
[2:09:12] wonderful Christian people but I just
[2:09:14] and Marcus just bowed his head and never
[2:09:17] forget he said no
[2:09:19] he said no Travis He said in fact when
[2:09:21] you knocked at the door and your friend
[2:09:23] knocked at the door he said a voice
[2:09:25] spoke and said
[2:09:26] these are men sent from God
[2:09:29] hear what they have to say
[2:09:32] he said so I was prepared for anything
[2:09:34] you were going to say
[2:09:36] I said Thank You Jesus
[2:09:39] you believe he's still that kind of God
[2:09:41] he makes the way take no thought for
[2:09:43] what you'll say
[2:09:45] take no thought don't stress over it
[2:09:47] give God a chance give God an
[2:09:48] opportunity
[2:09:51] and so I just began to speak to him and
[2:09:53] I said well I said let me just tell you
[2:09:54] Marcus eyes begin to go through all of
[2:09:57] these things brother Brandon teaches us
[2:09:58] and what cancer is and I told him I said
[2:10:00] that life that's living on you that's a
[2:10:02] demon Spirit Marcus I said that's a life
[2:10:04] that's living off of your life the
[2:10:06] doctors have given it a name named
[2:10:07] cancer he was diagnosed with stage four
[2:10:09] Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and he's I said
[2:10:12] that that disease I said is given a name
[2:10:14] I said they've named it and I said hey
[2:10:16] if doctors can can they got wonderful
[2:10:18] tools and wonderful medicine and if they
[2:10:20] could get it out of you and scrape every
[2:10:22] piece of it and you're then that's
[2:10:23] wonderful God heals in more ways than
[2:10:25] one God heals by medicine heals by
[2:10:27] doctors and I said you know I said but I
[2:10:30] said but let me just tell you uh that
[2:10:32] that life that's living on your life
[2:10:34] that's a that's a life that's a spirit
[2:10:36] in Mark 9 when Jesus spoke to the deaf
[2:10:39] and dumb man he didn't say thou death
[2:10:41] disease come out of the man or thou a
[2:10:44] sudden deafness or whatever Jesus said
[2:10:46] thou deaf spirit
[2:10:50] come out of the man and don't enter him
[2:10:53] again
[2:10:54] and I said what was he doing he was
[2:10:55] speaking to the life that's in that
[2:10:57] cancer that's living off of your life
[2:10:59] that set up a life of its own that's a
[2:11:01] spirit
[2:11:02] Mary began to say I she said I've never
[2:11:06] I've she said I've never heard that
[2:11:07] before but that's exactly what the Bible
[2:11:09] said
[2:11:11] and I said that's right I said that life
[2:11:12] if I said now listen I said you know and
[2:11:15] I just begin to pray with him I began to
[2:11:17] talk to him and I said you know those
[2:11:18] doctors have a tool bag and they've got
[2:11:20] tools all inside of there and things
[2:11:21] they could look at I said today I don't
[2:11:23] have that I said but I do have a bag
[2:11:25] full of promises
[2:11:27] and I said I got promises that are still
[2:11:30] just as real today as the day Jesus
[2:11:32] spoke them out of his lips I said those
[2:11:35] same words that he spoke can come to
[2:11:37] your life what was it those words can
[2:11:39] transfer off of the page into your body
[2:11:41] and heal you of that disease
[2:11:44] Mary said I've always believed in the
[2:11:47] Supernatural and and you could just tell
[2:11:49] that the atmosphere was starting to
[2:11:51] change I said in fact there was a little
[2:11:53] sister I said in a church in Louisiana I
[2:11:56] said she was diagnosed with the very
[2:11:57] same disease that you had stage four
[2:12:00] Hodgkin's lymphoma I said the same exact
[2:12:02] thing I began to tell her I begin to
[2:12:04] tell about sister Elena I began to tell
[2:12:07] her testimony let me just tell you
[2:12:09] sister Elena that testimony has shook
[2:12:12] the devil's Kingdom around the entire
[2:12:14] world
[2:12:15] what God did for you wasn't just for you
[2:12:18] it was for the body around the world it
[2:12:21] is shaking the devil's Kingdom
[2:12:29] what was it a faith that left a
[2:12:31] testimony of a sister in Louisiana got
[2:12:34] upon somebody in South Carolina and that
[2:12:37] same promise Came Upon that little that
[2:12:39] room I began to testify and I hope it's
[2:12:41] okay I asked if it would be okay and
[2:12:44] they gave me permission so I hope that's
[2:12:45] okay but I just begin to testify of this
[2:12:48] I said this one I said this little
[2:12:50] sister I said she was diagnosed with the
[2:12:52] same exact thing you were I pulled up
[2:12:54] even just recently before I was
[2:12:56] preaching a sermon I'd never read it
[2:12:57] before and my wife has friends with
[2:12:59] sister Elaine on Facebook and I had read
[2:13:01] something and I just wanted to pull it
[2:13:03] up and I I just began to read it and I
[2:13:05] begin to read how that two days before a
[2:13:07] week before Christmas she was diagnosed
[2:13:09] with stage four Hodgkin's lymphoma and
[2:13:11] two days after Christmas she started the
[2:13:13] first of 12 12 chemo treatments and they
[2:13:16] told me after four treatments they would
[2:13:18] do a pet scan to see how my body's
[2:13:19] responding I believe God Is A Healer
[2:13:22] I've told that to anyone who asked how
[2:13:24] I'm doing I told them I was looking to
[2:13:26] him and believed that he would heal me
[2:13:27] on Sunday I leap and danced before the
[2:13:30] Lord with joy and victory because I knew
[2:13:32] it was already a finished work even
[2:13:34] though I didn't know how or when even
[2:13:37] though there was no proof yet
[2:13:40] you say brother Matt does it matter
[2:13:41] listen to me friends sometimes what you
[2:13:44] do naturally has a supernatural
[2:13:47] consequence
[2:13:49] sometimes what you think is just
[2:13:51] physical you're just doing it as a
[2:13:53] supernatural reaction sometimes what you
[2:13:55] bind in Earth will be bound in heaven
[2:13:57] sometimes what you speak on Earth will
[2:14:00] which you loose will be loosed in heaven
[2:14:02] sometimes it takes a natural thing to
[2:14:05] move something in the Supernatural why
[2:14:08] did Banks Woods would brother Brandon
[2:14:09] throw up a rock in the air and it
[2:14:11] started a little change what was it
[2:14:13] doing it changed the atmosphere
[2:14:16] and that little disturbance was a
[2:14:18] tornado that landed on Alaska nearly
[2:14:20] sunk it Wyatt had it right come on
[2:14:22] somebody why did Hattie Ray have to open
[2:14:25] her mouth not just think it in her mind
[2:14:27] but she opened her mouth and said that's
[2:14:30] nothing but the truth brother Branham
[2:14:33] amen I believe it brother Branham that's
[2:14:36] nothing but the truth
[2:14:37] what was she doing Naaman had to dip why
[2:14:40] did he have to go one time two time
[2:14:41] three why did Jesus spit on the ground
[2:14:43] and he rubbed a little mud together and
[2:14:45] wiped it on a man's why because the
[2:14:48] naturals connected to the spiritual and
[2:14:50] what you do naturally when you say Amen
[2:14:52] to the word of God you're disturbing the
[2:14:55] atmosphere around you you're speaking to
[2:14:58] that devil you're speaking to that
[2:15:00] depression you're speaking to that life
[2:15:03] I say do something natural and it'll
[2:15:06] have a supernatural consequence
[2:15:09] why did sister Elena get up and run
[2:15:11] around the church she was doing
[2:15:13] something naturally and it moved Heaven
[2:15:17] Supernatural
[2:15:20] I say God don't let me hinder me don't
[2:15:22] let nothing hinder my praise don't let
[2:15:25] nothing hinder my voice I'm gonna speak
[2:15:28] against the doubt I'm gonna speak
[2:15:30] against the devil I'm gonna speak
[2:15:32] against the destruction in my life I'm
[2:15:34] going to speak against the Deliverance
[2:15:36] that I need I'm gonna speak
[2:15:38] [Applause]
[2:15:42] she did something naturally and all of
[2:15:45] Heaven moved
[2:15:47] you think it's important for you to use
[2:15:49] your voice sometimes your voice may be
[2:15:52] quiet and I don't care how small it
[2:15:54] starts
[2:15:55] I don't care how little it is
[2:15:59] footsteps mean possession
[2:16:03] testified
[2:16:04] and I said see here here She was what I
[2:16:07] dread but this is this is what she
[2:16:08] writes in her testimony on Sunday I
[2:16:10] leaped and danced before the Lord with
[2:16:12] joy and victory because I knew it was
[2:16:13] already finished work they were singing
[2:16:15] what have I to dread what have I to fear
[2:16:18] leaning on the Everlasting Arms
[2:16:25] I was preaching at a church in Flagstaff
[2:16:27] just here recently and I'd never read
[2:16:29] this before but the Holy Spirit dropped
[2:16:30] in that office and said read this
[2:16:32] testimony I'd never even read it I
[2:16:34] pulled it off of there I pasted it in my
[2:16:36] notes and I began to read it never read
[2:16:37] it I gotta read what I'm going to say I
[2:16:39] want to read the testimony and it's on
[2:16:41] their song Services going on as I read
[2:16:43] these words a week before two week
[2:16:45] before Christmas I'm going through it
[2:16:46] and I've come to the part not even
[2:16:48] realizing they had started a song and as
[2:16:50] I read these words sister Elena what
[2:16:52] have I to dread what have I to fear
[2:16:55] leaning I hear it as my words as those
[2:16:58] words were in sync with the song leaders
[2:17:00] I read that
[2:17:02] leaning
[2:17:04] on the Everlasting arms
[2:17:08] I have blessedness
[2:17:11] with my Lord so did
[2:17:15] leaning on the
[2:17:18] Everlasting noise
[2:17:20] what does it do it disturbs the
[2:17:22] atmosphere what does worship do what
[2:17:25] does music do what does singing Do It
[2:17:27] lifts you up out of this natural
[2:17:30] as brother right now was told by the
[2:17:31] angel of the Lord if you can get the
[2:17:33] people to believe you nothing will stand
[2:17:35] in your way not even cancer
[2:17:37] what was it brother Brandon was here but
[2:17:40] the people were here so why did he
[2:17:41] preach why did he testify he was trying
[2:17:44] to get the people to lift where he was
[2:17:47] and all things are possible and all
[2:17:51] things are possible to those that
[2:17:52] believe that's why we preach the word of
[2:17:54] God we're casting out the devil we're
[2:17:57] rebuking the spirit of fear we're
[2:17:59] rebuking the spirit of anxiety we're
[2:18:01] rebuking the spirit of failure we're
[2:18:03] preaching Victory we're preaching hope
[2:18:05] we're preaching Deliverance we're
[2:18:07] preaching salvation
[2:18:09] and you've got to reach out and take a
[2:18:11] hold of it it's at hand reach out and
[2:18:15] grab it say Lord I need Faith this
[2:18:17] morning I need my wayward loved one
[2:18:19] saved I'm going to reach out
[2:18:20] [Applause]
[2:18:22] thank you
[2:18:23] what about a fear they didn't only
[2:18:25] Everlasting Arms that was that service I
[2:18:27] preached throughout the Angel and the
[2:18:28] Lord spirit of God so strong as sister
[2:18:31] who had been battling arthritis in her
[2:18:34] hands and she had a baby hands all
[2:18:35] crippled up hurting her everywhere came
[2:18:37] through that prayer line that day the
[2:18:39] angels of the Lord supernaturally
[2:18:41] touched that sister she drove me after
[2:18:43] she said I've never battled it again all
[2:18:45] the pains left my hand all the pains
[2:18:47] left my body the doctor said I'd battle
[2:18:49] it forever why because God has sent an
[2:18:52] anointing of faith upon the heart of a
[2:18:55] sister and it transferred from the Bible
[2:18:57] [Applause]
[2:19:01] I begin to just tell him this testimony
[2:19:04] she says David dance Miriam Marion
[2:19:06] sounds strange to me but in the Bible
[2:19:08] marry him dancing with joy when she
[2:19:09] crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians
[2:19:10] and slaves who had enslaved them were
[2:19:12] drowned David danced for Joy when he saw
[2:19:14] the Ark of the Covenant brought back to
[2:19:15] Jerusalem it's an expression of extreme
[2:19:17] joy and victory I know my healing would
[2:19:19] come sooner or later because that Jesus
[2:19:21] the Jesus Christ of the Bible the great
[2:19:23] healer is the same Jesus I've served for
[2:19:26] 27 years I love this so much she's this
[2:19:30] is what she wrote I'm sure you've read
[2:19:32] it declare war on the devil
[2:19:37] declare war on the devil no retreat
[2:19:41] oh I just want to say this and preach it
[2:19:44] to you I want that to become a fresh
[2:19:45] anointing for your for your family and
[2:19:48] your children you got unsaved loved ones
[2:19:50] declare war on the kingdom of darkness
[2:19:52] in your life you need healing this
[2:19:55] morning declare war on the devil no
[2:19:58] retreat lay hold on to his promises
[2:20:01] she says yesterday I had my pets
[2:20:02] together today I met with a doctor for
[2:20:04] my fifth treatment he informed me that
[2:20:05] cancer is already gone I had a seven
[2:20:08] centimeter tumor in my lung and multiple
[2:20:10] lymph nodes that were affected in the
[2:20:11] picture you'll see the before and after
[2:20:13] I know you've seen this before the
[2:20:15] second is totally clear he said this is
[2:20:17] dramatic
[2:20:20] I don't want you to forget what God did
[2:20:22] because the same God the same promise a
[2:20:26] still Justice real right now
[2:20:30] [Music]
[2:20:32] is just as real right now
[2:20:36] I begin to testify and showed that
[2:20:38] sister
[2:20:39] I shouldn't marry that PET scan
[2:20:42] you could see her she looked at almost
[2:20:44] took her breath away
[2:20:47] she shows me Marcus here's Marcus
[2:20:50] and he's sitting there in his living
[2:20:52] room
[2:20:52] tumor about the size of a grapefruit on
[2:20:55] his neck giving up to die let's begin to
[2:20:58] testify to him
[2:20:59] and I said his wife began to look at
[2:21:02] that picture tears began to well up and
[2:21:04] I said no Marcus the same God who
[2:21:07] touched that sister is no respecter of
[2:21:09] persons
[2:21:11] and that same God is still here he's in
[2:21:14] this living room right now and he could
[2:21:15] touch your body a body that was so full
[2:21:18] of cancer you can see it in his pet scan
[2:21:20] went from down normally in this kind of
[2:21:22] pet scan he had done you can actually
[2:21:24] see the Blackness of the heart and the
[2:21:26] lungs and the kidney you can't see any
[2:21:29] of that there it's just cancer
[2:21:31] everywhere started on his neck had
[2:21:33] tumors the size of apples down on his on
[2:21:36] his legs going all the way down his calf
[2:21:37] muscles just all messed up everywhere
[2:21:39] you know what had happened this man was
[2:21:42] told he was going to die and he accepted
[2:21:45] that death sentence
[2:21:47] he had completely given up you know it's
[2:21:50] easier to have faith for somebody than
[2:21:52] it is to have faith for yourself
[2:21:53] sometimes
[2:21:55] and he had completely given up on
[2:21:57] himself completely to the point to where
[2:22:00] he had resigned himself to the fact that
[2:22:01] he was going to die
[2:22:03] you know sometimes it's harder when God
[2:22:05] puts you through something and Satan's
[2:22:07] attacking your family and your home it's
[2:22:09] much easier to believe for somebody else
[2:22:10] than this for you but you know what
[2:22:12] happened you know what happened in the
[2:22:14] Bible Jesus was was in a building and he
[2:22:17] was surrounded by multitudes and there
[2:22:19] was a man who was lame couldn't get to
[2:22:21] Jesus he was in a bed couldn't walk he
[2:22:23] was he he was lame in that bed but you
[2:22:25] know what happened his friends go over
[2:22:27] to him and they pick up the bed that he
[2:22:30] was in and They Carried him to Jesus
[2:22:34] because that man maybe couldn't have
[2:22:35] faith for himself but there was somebody
[2:22:37] who could have faith and stand in the
[2:22:39] gap for him
[2:22:41] and the Bible says when they got to
[2:22:43] Jesus they couldn't get to him he's
[2:22:44] surrounded by crowds of people he said a
[2:22:46] little Hut and no one could get to him
[2:22:48] but you know what they didn't stop there
[2:22:49] they wasn't going to let any
[2:22:51] circumstance get in their way they
[2:22:53] climbed up on the roof of that house and
[2:22:56] they ripped the roof off and they
[2:22:59] lowered that man down to Jesus
[2:23:02] Hallelujah
[2:23:04] and Jesus said by your faith this man
[2:23:07] has made wealth maybe they're not here
[2:23:09] today I tell you in the name of the Lord
[2:23:12] lower them down to Jesus say God I'm
[2:23:15] ripping the roof off I'm Climbing Up on
[2:23:18] the Roof God
[2:23:20] touch their body touch their mind kill
[2:23:23] that cancer deliver them from sin Lord
[2:23:28] it won't be according to their faith
[2:23:30] it's according to your faith in the name
[2:23:32] of Jesus

[2:24:13] pray you can feel the supernatural move
[2:24:15] in that room that living room we left

[2:24:19] feeling that we had done what we were
[2:24:21] supposed to do we left took our burdens
[2:24:23] to the Lord and we left them there
[2:24:26] and sometimes that's all you need to do
[2:24:30] quit thinking you got to work something
[2:24:31] up or build something up
[2:24:33] take your burdens to the Lord
[2:24:36] leave it there
