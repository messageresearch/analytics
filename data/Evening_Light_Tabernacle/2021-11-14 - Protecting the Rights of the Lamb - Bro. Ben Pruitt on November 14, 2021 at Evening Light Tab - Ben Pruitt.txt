morning amen thank you to brother timothy he's been a lifelong i'd say a life long long time friend of mine and brother aaron and sister lydia for the hospitality this weekend and we just had a good time yesterday i know they were trying to feed me and embarrass me today because i wouldn't be able to preach after i ate that much but but it didn't happen we're here the presence of the lord is here he said he would be amen where two or three are gathered together my name so we we've got we got that we got that done this morning amen amen revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book he fought the battle aren't you glad for that he had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain i want you to notice this having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word this morning he may be seated i want to speak to you this morning on protecting the rights of the lamb everybody thinks they have rights today we live in an age of rights laodicea was the age of people's rights that's what the name means today we have people's rights human rights gay rights women's rights animal rights i read in one place where a court declared that an orangutan in argentina had rights he had the right to be free it was the worst day of that orangutan's life because once you let him go what's he going to do he's used to being fed we have a dog at home that has thinks he has rights he's got more rights than i do he'll get off the couch and and and he gets babied and gets fed doesn't have to work don't have to do anything to provide it but you know we all have we all think we have rights but i want to tell you this morning i guess this this message came to me as i was studying on the breach and things brother branham said about that and i'm getting tired of people telling me that we don't have the right because it's not our right that we're protecting well you don't have the right to worship god you don't have the right to pray for the baptism of the holy ghost you don't have the right to preach the right to to have church and and to really love god with all your heart and and to be on fire for god you don't have the right to do that i'm tired of hearing that because i'm not here this morning defending the rights of a man but i'm here this morning defending the rights of the lamb that's what we're to do is to protect his rights so brother adam tells us that laodicea is the people's rights or justice of the peoples and he talked about that that church age that has seen nations rising up and demanding equality socially and financially he said this is the age of the communists and we've seen that haven't we this is the age of the communists where all men are supposedly equal but only in theory and and so he talked about liberal theologians that said that jesus was a socialist and and the early church practiced socialism and we ought to do that today but it's it's an illusion of rights that people have today and and actually what they get is their rights taken away from them but brother adam goes on to say in every attribute ancient laodicea is found reborn in the in the laodicean age and i believe we can see that today everybody thinks they have rights but i don't think everybody understands what rights are that's right what is a right a right is a legal social or ethical principle of freedom or entitlement it's something that that you have that is allowed to you or owed to you according to either a legal system or perhaps because of just who you are in fact in our country we have certain rights that are given to us as citizens and and it was jefferson thomas jefferson who said we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights it's an important phrase because it means that right can't be taken away that if a government tries to take away an unalienable right it means that the government is wrong and that government should be abolished and so we have rights in what he said was to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that government is created we form governments to protect those rights but when the government goes to infringe on those rights he went on to argue that if government failed to protect those rights that it should be abolished now let me just say this at the outset this morning any church system that fails to protect the right of the land that fails to protect what he died for he died so you and i could be here this morning he died for somebody who would who would love him with all of his heart somebody that would worship him with all that they had somebody that would preach the truth somebody that would live it in an age that has gone crazy he died for somebody and he bought those rights for you and i i want to stand for his rights today are you with me this morning i want to stand for his rights amen look any church system that fails to protect that should be abolished that's the strong statement but it's the truth there are legal rights in america we have the bill of rights a legal right is a right that's written down and and we they've agreed and made it law that it should be the right of the land in america we have the bill of rights and what they did in the constitution is they limited what the government could do but then in the bill of rights they said that's not enough the early founding fathers realized that that was not enough that there had to be rights beyond that that there would be a right to actually that would be would be told us that we would know what our rights are and so they specified certain things that we could have and certain things that could not be done to us and i'm thankful for those rights today because the very first one is freedom of religion the government shall not infringe on the right of the people and so it goes on down and and goes through the first ten amendments there you can find all kinds of different rights now think about it what would you do if someone's come and begin to take one of those rights away now many of you hunt maybe not people that are here this morning maybe they're out hunting but but if you're streaming today in the deer stand many people hunt this weekend is the first weekend of hunting season in arkansas if you didn't know that and and so i know that people do that what if they took you right away to hunt how would you feel how would you respond to that i'll tell you how some of you would respond to that and you'd take up arms you'd march in the street you'd be on the picket line you'd pick up your sign and you say no i'm not gonna let you take my rights you'd show up to vote in person whether it was convenient or not oh i wish people realized what kind of a a right that we've been given as christians we ought to show up in the house of god to vote amen i'm going to stand for my right to have church i'm going to stand for my right to be a christian i don't i want my children i want to be able to pass those rights on to my children the ones that if the lord carries another 20 years i want them to know what the presence of god is like i want them to know what the spirit of god tell the people i want them to hear the word clearly i want them to know what having a pastor is like what being in a real church is like and i'm tired of people telling us that that's that we're just standing for our rights no it's god's rights written in the word for us y'all going to kill me this morning now you have a legal right written down brother branham says this way to everything that jesus died for [Applause] he said he died his death there at the cross and gave his life that you might have the legal rights for every redemptive blessing john sees a bloody lamb in revelation chapter five but he sees he sees a bloody lamb but not a defenseless lamb a lamb who has seven horns and seven eyes and brother branham tells us that the seven horns are the seven church ages and the seven eyes are the seven messengers and he says that in the breach he said the seven horns was the seven churches the seven church ages he said because that was the lamb's protection oh my another place he calls it the power and that was the lamb's protection what he protected his rights with on earth that's a that's a strange name you think of a lamb as meek and mild and he was but he but he has rights and he protects those rights hallelujah aren't you glad for a bloody lamb aren't you glad for a lamb that that still has mercy amen on those that will reach out for it on those who will call for it there's still mercy for you today i don't care what you've done or where you've been or what kind of a past you've had there's still mercy there for you there's still something that lamb is still bleeding john sees a bloody lamb the the one the elder turned around and said he said now he said i want you to see the lion of the tribe of judah have prevailed but when john looks hallelujah he saw a lamb bloody lamb one with mercy one with grace amen i'm so glad because i still need it every day i don't know about you but i still have to repent i still have to call out to god i still need his mercy i still need his healing power i still need that blood every day [Applause] what did he protect his rights with now watch it was the horns those seven church ages and brother branham put it this way he said what he protected his rights with on earth was a god-sent group of people especially because there's lots of people who've given up on the rights of the lamb who've taken away his rights who have formed denominations but there's got to be a special god-sent group of people that protect the horn on the lamb amen now what are these rights that the lamb has and and you know when you know what his rights are in order to know that you have to know who he is because he's not just another person but he has certain rights because of who he is just like you do today you have certain rights as an american citizen you have certain rights and and privileges because of the state and the place that you live in he has certain rights number one he is god amen now i think we could say amen to that today brother brown said when the virgin birth came on he said that was a paradox now that god in order to make himself known to man i'm so glad he wanted to make himself known he became man and he said how that god the great spirit he said god to me was before there wasn't even a lie there wasn't a media there wasn't an atom there wasn't a molecule there wasn't anything and everything was god he said that's how great he is he's from eternity through eternity don't lose your sense of the awesomeness of god of the greatness of god and in modern christianity they've broken down that sense of awesomeness we ought to when we come in the house of god we ought to get a sense that god is awesome that anything is possible because this is the almighty god that is able to perform what he promised he's able to do what he promised he would do not some dead god that died 50 years ago or 500 years ago but a god that is able a god that filled all time in space [Music] and brother madam says the thank god amen he said that's how great he is and that god he is from eternity through eternity he always was god he always will be god he said and how the greatest of all life now watch he said but that great god does he care about me this morning is there a thought in his heart towards me can he tell that i'm burdened can he tell that there's something going on in my life can he tell that i've made a mistake is is he listening is he watching but the brother said that great god the greatest of all life became a little small germ in the womb of a woman in order to take his own law that may not mean anything to you but that god who fills all time in space became a german in the womb of a woman in order to take his own law he didn't send a second person or a third person but he came down changed his mask hallelujah just going to have to stop and pray for a while doesn't it make you feel unworthy sometimes makes you feel that god would do that would come down be one of us who filled all space and time and god was manifested in the flesh how the great god of heaven changed his strain now if you watch the papers today especially here a few months ago when the delta strain come out of chronovirus you remember that if you go and watch that if you google change this strain you'll find you'll find articles about that that that there was actually the virus changed its strain to be something else brother brown said god changed his strain come from being god to be man through the virgin birth he said nobody can figure it out but see god he was the word and the word is the instructions from god i don't want to get too far into this this morning but you understand that god put something in his dna he was the word in his very being and and god that dna was manifested in the flesh it was it wasn't from man he didn't get it from his mother from his father on the earth he got it from god every bit of it come from god god was manifested in the flesh he changed his strain come from being god to be man through the virgin birth he said nobody can figure it out he said but science today can't tell you how that virgin birth was but god did it as he came he said no one was able everybo everyone was sexually born he said one man the same was the rest of them no one could help the other one we was all in trouble oh we could stop and preach there for a while we was all in trouble there's nothing worse than a self-righteous spirit we were all in trouble the worst sinner in simon's house the pharisees house was simon he didn't think that he was but he was actually the worst sinner in the house because when christ came in he refused to welcome him he refused to recognize him but a prostitute from outside she saw that there was something that needed to be done the lamb had a right to be worshipped the lamb had a right to have his feet washed the lamb had a right to be welcome in the house of god and because the lamb amen because he had a right she washed his feet she said i'm not worthy but she didn't look at who she was she took the money that she'd gotten through ill-gotten gains and come down to his feet and begin to wash his feet you talk about emotional she washed his feet with her tears how long has it been since you cried them kind of tears but jesus said because she'd been forgiven much [Music] i was raised on a church pew i was raised in the message but i've been forgiven much and and so when i come in his presence the tears begin to come because i know i've been forgiven much i know what i was i know what i could have been i know the dna that runs in my family even being a pruitt there's bad dna that runs in my side of it anyway there's some there's some stuff there that you don't want to know about but i know what he did for me i know what he kept me from i know hallelujah i wonder if you could say that today i know what he kept me from i know what the power of god had changed my life i know what god did i know who he is amen they can't talk you out of that amen you can't talk moses out of a burning bush amen amen you remember you remember when moses had the burning bush experience brother brown talks about that and i'm getting off my notes here but we'll come back in a minute y'all just got one service right we'll come back in a minute but but moses was here he was at the burning bush and brother branham says about that he said that he said actually preachers could come and steal your memory of the event how many remembers when god came and touched your life now look for some of you the details might get fuzzy especially if it's been a long time ago i've seen people who were unable in the grasp of their memory their mind didn't work like it used to but there was still something there you see brother random said they might be able to steal the memory of it but they can't steal the change we might tell you that you can't be born again they might tell you that you're no different they might tell you that it was just an emotional experience they might tell you that it wasn't nothing from god but i was there in a basement when god changed my life i was there in that room when he gave me the holy ghost i've been there i know what it's like to feel his power i know what it's like to have his word moving in my life i know what it is to be changed they may steal the memory i may not be able to tell it the same way twice but they can't steal the change they can't take that away from me hallelujah oh we might as well have church this morning amen we was all in trouble amen but god himself came down and was born not of a jew not of a gentile but his blood was god he said the blood comes from the male sex in this case it was god god the creator created the blood cell in the womb of mary and built himself a tabernacle that he himself came down and lived in it oh my the bread was praying in shalom he said we know that in a drama they change mass they come from one thing to another and that's what you did you come from the spirit god the great jehovah put on the mask of a human being changed your strain he said you pitched your tent hallelujah i'm so glad he picks his tent beside mine hey man you come down from god and became man that you might die to redeem man you changed your mask but it didn't stop there he said then again you've changed it and you've masked yourself into the people who will believe will you believe today you've masked yourself and that's who he protects his rights with is those who will believe and act out according to the word that that you have written here the bible says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus in philippians 5. he said who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation i got to thinking about that you know if i could create myself a life what kind of a life would i create i'd create myself more money for one i'd be a little taller have more hair i'd be able to eat what i wanted to never get sick be one of you skinny guys with lots of hair if i could create myself a body i'd come as a doctor or a lawyer with a family of a great name maybe not a lawyer but something else somebody's got a good name if i could create myself a body maybe i'd come as a pruitt you think about it what kind of a body would you create he created himself an everyday body a baby that had to be washed and taken care of and nurse at his mama's breast he didn't create himself a full-born man he didn't create himself some kind of superhuman but he created he made himself flesh and was born into a manger into a cave and into swaddling clothes there with with animals to witness his birth there was shepherds some men that would witness and tell the the people that he was born he was born into our world and that way he made himself of no reputation if i was coming i'd make myself a reputation better than the one i have now but when he came he actually made himself of no reputation and he said let this mind be in you which was in christ jesus being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow or the things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth i got to looking at that one day and brother branham said he said he said i'm standing here i'm not worthy to pray for the people but he said he gave me the rights to his name hallelujah he said as a christian not just as a prophet he gave you the rights to sign his name on a checkbook are you still with me this morning at the name of jesus every knee should bow things in heaven and things and earth things under the earth that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father he is god but he was also the second adam he's the son of god now look adam was the son of god we find that luke 3 38 he said he was the son of god adam was the son of god now brother random says we see something that was lost here because the bible said so that he said and in the book here that has redeemed us he said what are we redeemed from something we must have lost you see he had to come because he didn't come for himself the rights that the lamb has is the rights that we have that we possess but we couldn't get them we couldn't save ourselves but the lamb came lay the sight of splendor and came down condescended to come into our world and beat one of us and actually lose every right that he had to take on the rights of a man but you see he had the rights that adam lost and he come to buy them back for us now watch something we must have lost he said before you can be redeemed there must be something that redeemed us back and all the inheritance that we had has been redeemed back and we must have had something one time that we do not have now but this lamb come to redeem he said we had something that we was lost from he said notice what did we lose well it was given to adam to have eternal life that's right that's a right amen the right of eternal life adam had eternal life as long as he eat from the tree he had eternal life and we noticed again that adam would inherit the earth he was like an amateur god over the earth he said the earth was his everything was given unto his hand he could do with it whatever he wanted to he named it and called it done whatever he wanted to he was truly a son of god he said now in the fall adam forfeited the title deed to that he forfeited it to satan satan took the title deep he said adam was very southful and he did not redeem his rights for he could not redeem his rights i believe that can be said about all of us before our conversion before we were born again before we received the token of the holy ghost i believe it could be said that all of us were very thoughtful when you see people that are very slothful about the about the rights of the lamb they're very thoughtful about taking back what what the what god gave them you find many times just because they've never really come face to face with him they've never really had an experience with it because they're very thoughtful adam was very slothful and he could not redeem his rights but today the rights have already been redeemed you don't have to do it you have to benefit from it you get to benefit from it to do that you have to receive his spirit now watch he is the son of god he is the kinsman redeemer redemption was a right reserved to the near kinsman you see when you lost property in the old testament you lost every right that you had except one and the one right was reserved not in you but in the kinsman redeemer and that was the right of redemption you lost the rights to enjoy it you lost the rights to benefit from it to pull the produce off of it you lost the rights to sit under your vine and your fig tree to sit out there and like maybe you would be a hunter and you would hunt on the land but if you lose your rights to it you lose your right to hunt you lose your right to kill the land you lose your right to live on it but the right of redemption was still there but it was vested in the near kinsmen amen and jesus had to come with the rite of redemption you'll find that in jeremiah 32 7 that the rite of redemption goes to the near kinsman but the brahmana said that's the reason john wept he said because if no one could get that book all creation everything was gone she would just simply turn back to atoms and molecules and cosmic light not even be creation person nothing else he said because adam lost the rights of that book he forfeited it when he listened to his wife we'll just go on he said he forfeited it when he listens to his wife and she listens to satan's reasonings some of us need to listen to our wives more often praise god i gotta quit i get too comfortable i'll start getting a pastor mode that wouldn't be good we won't do that oh but look it couldn't go back he lost it it couldn't go back into the dirty hands of satan who tempted her out of the way so therefore it went back to the original owner he said like any abstract deed would do i spent 15 years in the abstract deed industry title insurance industry and i was always happy when we could find the original owner because sometimes you can't the records are just gone there's no way and if you cannot find the original owner then there's no way to get the property cleared up without doing some kind of major lawsuit to quiet the title because there's no way to run all the way back to the beginning but if you can find the original owner even if the original owner has died it goes on down through his relatives and there might be somebody living in some some other nation somewhere some other state somewhere that has the authority to sign a deed and they don't even know they have it because they got that they are the descendants of the original owner listen when the book was lost it goes back it goes back into the hands listen you may have been so lost you may have been a drunk you may have been a drug addict you may have been out beyond every hope of life at all you may have been in a place that you couldn't even see your way back from you may have thought you'd never come back to church but you were in the hands of the original owner even when you were backslid even when you weren't when you were against god when you were doing whatever it is that you wanted to do you were still in his hands you are never the elect of god is never out of his hands never out of his hands oh that ought to be a revelation to us this morning you are never out of his hands adam lost the rights but it did not go back just into the ether somewhere but it went back to the original hands of the owner satan didn't have the rights he was just a squatter but god almighty held it in his hands and the ownership was never lost amen there was a chain of possession from the almighty who become the lamb and he passed it to his hands amen you're still in his hands the same god that delivered you from sin that same god can heal you today that same god can bring revival to your heart to your spirit because you're in his hands amen the original owner means it's redeemable the rights are vested in the original owner now brother branham said there's a price and that's redemption there's some price for redemption because nobody could do it so he made his laws his own laws of the kingdom and redeemer he said then they could find nobody every man was born of sex born after sexual desire he was in the original sin satan and eve so he could not do it there's nothing in him no holy pope priest dr divinity whoever he might be he would be nobody worthy he couldn't be an angel because it had to be a kinsmen he had to be a man then god himself become a kinsman by taking on a human flesh through the virgin birth he shed his blood he said that wasn't the blood of a jew it wasn't the blood of a gentile it was the blood of god the bible said we're saved through the blood of god amen he purchased us that's what brother random gift says from the scripture paul says he purchased us with his own blood amen amen you see the rights of the lamb are adam's rights therefore they're your rights states your legal status in romans 8 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god let me know you're a child of god today i'm a son or daughter of god i've never been out of his hands amen and joint heirs he said if children then we're heirs paul uses the legal reasoning that if we're children then we're heirs by law by by legal we have legal rights to the promises where heirs of god join heirs with christ it will so be that we suffer with him and we may be also glorified together now notice so he not only had the rights of who he was i'm trying to hurry through this this morning you just bear with me i won't hold you very long i'll tell you i'm closing three times the third one is the charm but he said when he took the former man he took the rights of man not for himself but for us pretty bad now look again as we said we have a a bill of rights as americans but where is our rights right here as christians some of us need to read the bible and find out what we've been given you see you have a right as a christian to eternal life what that means is if you shouldn't if you've been born again if you haven't been born again you need to be born again you must be born again but if you're born again you shouldn't let the devil come in and beat you around what he's doing is working in your memory working in your conscience working in something else but he said if you're god is greater than your conscience he's greater than your heart he's able to come in and actually speak to you and reveal to you the word of god see many people have added so many things to the message of the hour that it becomes a burden that they themselves cannot bear and so they're actually under the burden of themselves but what you ought to do is find out what rights you have you have a right to eternal life [Applause] i don't care what the devil says why because john 10 28 he said i give unto them eternal life and we find out he said neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand titus 1 2 we find out that was always was he said in hope of eternal life that hope is expectation of eternal life which god that cannot lie do you believe he cannot lie this morning he cannot lie with that god that cannot lie promised before the world began amen the lamb was slain but he had a right to eternal life and he'd come up on the third day and gave that right back to us now look right all right to healing the bible says he heals all thy diseases tired of people telling me well you just want to go back to pentecost you want to be healed have a right to that and that's the lamb's right he paid for that they put stripes on his back i don't want to give that up meekly i don't want to walk away from that right to healing the lamb has that right amen notice he said he heals all thy diseases he redeems your life from destruction he crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies he satisfies your mouth mouth with good things those are your rights it's time you stood up for your rights well but you know i got to make a living i got a right to make a living as a chris as an american but it's time you set up for your rights as a christian i got a right to be healed i'm going to show up until the symptoms go away i got a right to receive the holy ghost and i'm going to pray until until i've been changed i got a right to to worship god in the freedom without the burden of depression in my life without the burden of suicidal thoughts without the burden of besetting sin i've got a right to those things amen and i believe i've got a right and i'll be there at the throne of god until i realize my rights [Applause] the devil wants to take them away i'm going to protest you try to take rights away from a union what are they going to do they're going to stand there they're going to strike they're going to get out there and protest and everything else but they try to take the rights away from the people of god many times they sit there and say well it's okay it's just the age we live in no it's not it's not the age we live in it's time we stood up for our rights the problem is the age the problem is us i'll tell you what age we live in we live in what brother brown called the bride time the end of the way of seeing age but it's the bright time it's time for you and i to raise up and say hey it's my hour oh tired from that all the hay rides yesterday too much chilly bless god that i had a right to eat it i did too but today i'm going to stand for my rights to be in the house of god i heard of a lady who was who was deaf she couldn't hear nothing she kept going to church asked her said why why do you go she said well i just want the devil to know whose side i'm on [Music] [Applause] i may i'll get my child but i know you young mothers we got a bunch of them in our church that you know mothers that just seem like fight the babies the whole time in the nursery maybe some of you sitting in the nursery today and you're fighting that and you think i i haven't really sat in a church service in a long time but you got to write just like everybody else does to go to the house of god and god has a right to be worshipped from the nursery god has a right to be worshipped from the balcony he has a right to be worse not just from the front rows he's got a right to be worshipped by young people but he's got a right to be worshipped by old people he's got a right to be worshipped by preachers he's got a right amen he's got a right to amen he's got a right you never pass the age where god won't give you the right to healing the right to salvation amen amen amen brother branham said now he talked about healing he said here's the next thing i want to say is this he said don't wait for a healing campaign in your city to be healed listen to this he said your pastor or your neighbor that's a christian has just as much legal rights from god to pray for you as anybody on the face of the earth he said you don't have to wait till somebody comes along with a healing campaign he said those men just stimulate faith he said god never intended all these great campaigns sweeping across the nation he expected that to be in every church every pastor [Applause] hallelujah the bible says any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church but then pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord the prayer of faith shall save the sick the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him and real true christians down to the ages have stood for that right they were the power of god the horn the defense of the lamb and the age that they lived in stand for the right of healing you have a right to people the bible says there's peace that passes all understanding and it'll keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus you have a right to joy tired of people telling me to be a message believer you got to be miserable i've tried that it's not fun listen if you're miserable you're miserable it's just uh all you do is make yourself a twofold child of hell by prosecuting yourself to the message but you got a right to be joyful you gotta write the bible says that right goes all the way back you know we have created rights we have rights that as i said are inherent those rights go all the way back before time because the bible says the sons of god shouted together for joy that's right psalms 5 11 says let all those who put their trust in me how many trust him this morning and all those who put their trust and they rejoice let them ever shout for joy because thou defendeth them let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee psalms 32 11 be glad in the lord and rejoice you righteous shout for joy all you that are upright in heart psalms 132 16 i will clothe their priests with salvation heard saints shall shout aloud for joy brother branham says this he said when the great shepherd was smitten i know these are things that you know but i just want to include them here because we have the rights to these things he said when the great shepherd was submitting the great sheep prophet when he was smitten back there he said it is finished and that minute as soon as this shepherd was smitten it was over hallelujah sin is settled there was no more sin they were clean you believe it this morning the penalty was paid the believers whose names were written in the book of life predestined from the foundation of the world it was finished the very minute jesus said it was finished he said that great shepherd come for his sheep it was finished god's right hand was pulled from his bosom smitten then on easter he returned it a man raised it up again to his bosom and extended it down to you and i in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original garden from which sin took us from he said the hidden secret of his great heart was revealed by a prophet shepard it was revealed by a shepherd he said no wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day nobody understood it why would it happen why did the the mountains so why was there an earthquake why did the moon become blood and all those things and brother random at different times will say that he died until that happened and it was such a dreadful thing but here he says it was a joy he said they seen the prophet shepard he said no wonder he said the sun hit his face and screamed for joy no wonder all nature broke loose the wind shook the trees until they shook and shook enjoyed and jumped he said they'd seen the prophet shepherd on the mountain redeem every name in the book of life and they seen that their own nature was redeemed they screamed and jumped are you still with me this morning the world went into an earthquake the mountains rent the rocks fell out and the sun went down he said and everything taken place like any meeting he said when the shepherd reveals to you that it's finished [Applause] he said i've seen jumping spells and joy spells but there was nobody hurt and he typed that to that day he said there was the earthquake but no one was hurt he said i've seen it but no one was hurt he said they were free from the world it was revealed to the people that they were free from the world the things of the world and the joy of the lord filled the congregation i got a right to that man i got enough wet blankets i'm tired of wet blankets putting out every little spark are you with us where i know i'm preaching to the choir i'm tired of wet blankets but not every spot and sometimes it's me because my body don't feel like it said well man today i had a long day yesterday kind of sick and not feeling too good i'm trying not to get in your face today you know the lamb has a right listen he has a right to hear you speak his word he has a right to hear you say his name where did we ever get the idea that the only place you could pray in church was in front of the pulpit behind the pulpit he got a right to hear his name from your lips he said well the preacher says his name every sunday morning but he's got a right amen i want to give him what he deserves today and he's got a right to be for these things and that's our job is to protect these rights now brother branham said he never did see anything disorderly there was always right and order because they'd recognize that their name that had been written on lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world now how do we protect those rights well he told us in mark chapter 16 verse 15 he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe so he's telling you how his rights are going to be protected down to the church ages and if you look at those seven spirits of god that spirit of god he said is one spirit of god manifested in seven men but he said it doesn't change it's the exact same spirit at the end that it is at the beginning these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it won't hurt them they shall lay hands on the stick and they shall recover notice what the lamb does he goes back to his intercessory box he left his little group on the earth to protect his rights amen don't try to take those rights away look brother branham come in our hour and and he showed us that those rights had been restored what had been restored he said we had to write he said any group of people any gathering of holiness people that's people that live right that believe in christ has the right to have the nine spiritual gifts we have a right to the original man a brother random said the priest that on down through time had a right to have a taste yes hallelujah of here oh my oh as a preacher i want to have a taste of the original manna and i got a right to have a taste of that manna this morning amen he said worms couldn't get in it that's the problem with some people the worms have gotten their manner that's why they don't want to eat it but i gotta write to the original man amen and he said how beautiful it is he said on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost fell down from heaven our man after we come through the blood and have been saved and cleansed from our sins he said in the holy ghost fell brother he said peter said on the day of pentecost it's for you and for your children and for them that's far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and brother brown said this he said every person that enters into the baptism of the spirit can have the same kind of holy ghost that they got on the day of pentecost [Music] hallelujah brandon makes a statement that no man has a right to preach the gospel until he's met going to the backside of the desert i got a revelation one day that man i had a right to preach the gospel if i had met god on the backside of the desert and god called me to do it i i i would dare a man to try to take those rights away from the true church of god there's no right to do that i got a right to preach not because i'm worthy of it but because the lamb has rights if he wanted to set up church a certain way that's his right amen it's just my job to enforce it [Music] this is how we enforce our rights but the brandon said to restore it give me about five or ten more minutes and we're through that's my first warning to restore means to bring back or to restore he said a claim can be enforced now to bring back anything bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs he said therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and can wander around anywhere and that's why you begin to have a mind battle you begin to think well if i was a christian i wouldn't have done that or if i was seed rather if i was the seed of god i wouldn't have done that you better be careful with that because look at some of the people jesus came to look at the woman at the well she's done some pretty bad things but she had representation in her heart brother brandon said when that wanders away from its rightful owner it can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to real who really owns it hey man aren't you glad you've been restored back to the person to the original owner who really owns you to bring it back to its natural estate where it wasn't the first time bring it back into its natural condition he said in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration there's a right in our bill of rights called the habeas corpus it's let us have the body what it means is that you have a right to a speedy trial someone come down there and caught you poaching deer fishing fishing without a license some i know you would never do anything else but those are common message sins you know let's thought i'd cover all of you this morning so we don't like to pay for licenses you know but here if he caught you like that and the game warden grabbed hold of you he says i got a jail cell for you he said there's a fine for this but i'm just going to throw you in the prison throw you into jail he goes down there and he throws you in jail locks the door and walks away what would you do well the man had a gun wasn't right to shoot him but he locked you up now look he's took away all your rights he's got you locked up in prison but there's a law there's a bill of rights that says he can't keep the body without presenting it before the judge don't you see where the church ages were yeah don't you see where the ages were where denominational ages had been they've been in a place where where the body had been kept in prison in denominational ages but this is the hour amen when the judge came hallelujah when the judge of the earth came and he come down in our hour and and he spoke and he said show me the body let us have the body show me hallelujah let me see the body you don't have a right to hold them listen satan does not have a right to hold you indefinitely amen he doesn't have a right to hold you in fear to hold you in sickness to hold you in sin he has no right to hold you there to keep you in prison there's a law bigger hallelujah there's a law bigger than the law that brought you in there there's a law bigger hallelujah there's a law bigger than the sin that brought you into the prison there's a law that says i have a right to be released i have a right to stand before the judge and let my rights be judged by the lamb [Applause] amen i gotta write amen and i got an attorney who will write a letter to him and say judge we have a man that's been kept up in sin it's time that he was released [Applause] hallelujah we have a right to enforce if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration he said like if somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive you can go take the law and go to this person and the law enforces this person to restore this property back to this natural owner into his libel first estate and forrester said that we have the privilege to enforce upon satan the claims that god give us hallelujah because you're not really doing it for yourself you're doing it for the lamb quit letting the devil beat you up say well we'll give some rights back to the devil just to be fair no you're not doing it for yourself you're here as an agent of the lamb hallelujah enforce those rights and force those claims upon satan say give it back and he has to do it he said because we can take god's agent the holy spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the lord hallelujah he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it amen he said for god has a law he said his word is is his law god in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force those claims upon satan and say give it back and he has to do it we can take god's agent holy spirit go right down our knees and say it let's say the lord he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it he said the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land for the land but the law of the spirit of god is to force satan to give up that which he is unrightfully deceitfully taken from god souls of men remember he didn't have a right to your children he didn't have a right to your body he didn't have a right he took it deceitfully listen if somebody come in your house this afternoon and stole your new truck stole your gun stole your the the deer off your walls if someone come in and took away everything that you had what would you do you would go down to the law immediately you'd call them up and say hey somebody stole some stuff from me i have a right to enforce that these things be brought back to me and you have a right to call the law this morning and enforce every right to every claim that the devil places against you whatever david the devil stole from you you have a right to get it back brother branham said souls of men he took from god souls of women children sickness of the body places upon people where god made them in his image to be like him and the church was given the rightful legal rights by the bible to take the holy spirit and enforce this upon him amen now we defend all the lamb's rights with an open book and our age they could only defend what the eye could see in that horn of that age but today we all the loose ends have been tied up we got the rights to all of it brother bran put it this way he said we've got that speaking of pentecost we've got that plus but we've got that but we've got plus hey man do you believe he has a right to be worshipped today you'll find that revelation 5 8 through 14 and i'm closing second morning you'll find that and he talks about how that every creature everything begin to worship god and say with a loud voice worthy is the land worthy is the lamb that was slain to what to receive power to have his rights enforced on the earth worthy is the lamb to have a horn on the earth today of power a group of people that'll enforce his rights it'll defend his rights it'll stand for his rights it'll protect his rights he's worthy to to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing do you believe he's worthy today amen and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as we're in the sea and all that are in them he said heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be into him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him liveth forever and ever brother branham said about that when they all began to worship him he said john worshipped him so much until he said every creature in heaven and the earth underneath the earth heard me saying he said blessings glory power wisdom might be to the lamb he said the worship time for the king lamb but listen what is he becoming now look look what the age that we live in we live at the end of the end when the lamb is slain he walked forward from eternity brother brown said out of the father's throne he said took his rights he said when he took his rights it was a judgment seat and he become not a lamb but a lion a king and he calls for his queen to come stand by his side musicians go ahead and come i'm going to close on this kept my word three warnings look it calls for the queen you remember when vashti wouldn't come the king stood there and said i want to see my wife i want her to stand by my side she said i ain't going to come i got better things to do i can come to church today i got better things to do the devil has worked really hard to make it a habit for people to stream and not go to church and there's nothing wrong with streaming i've got people that's all the church they have it's just stream our services but listen you need to be in the house of god amen amen you say well i can get all i need but it's not about what you need what does the lamb need you see the lamb has a right for you to be part of a local body i know there's some that can't physically do it but there's something in their heart they would do anything to take your place but you get in a place where you're like you like vashti you say well i'll take it or leave it i'll come when i want to but the king got rid of vasti and he found him a wife who would come to him she'd never wait to be called she'd come to him brother branham said this is the hour when the king calls for his queen to come stand by his side i believe that's the hour we're living in one day he's going to make that final call we're going to go home a final call but i believe in this time during this during this last stage he's calling queen come stand by my side protect my rights i need a people i want to see a people on the earth who will protect my rights listen this is my picket line this is where i protest yeah if you tried to take gun rights away from the southerners you'd have the biggest protest biggest trouble on your hands in the world i thank god for that but this is my picket line this is where i show where i'm standing this is where i protest against the enemy i don't we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers [Applause] this is my picket line this is where i protest to protect the rights of the lamb hallelujah see he has a right to move in our midst he has a right to have the people who live clean lives he has a right to think of it each one of you personally in your life is a right to you without all those things that stand in the way of you coming when he calls that's right yes you have a right to be free but he has a right for you to be free you have a right to be worshipped in spirit and in truth you say well how do i enforce that right this morning brother ben jesus said if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me amen would you bow your heads with me i thought about the marquee to the lafayette when he come to frank from france he come to fight in the revolutionary war because he recognized a noble cause he laid down the rights of his nobility as a frenchman and he'd come and was wounded in the battle of american revolution and fought and eventually become a general on his own merit they come and laid aside all the rights that he had as a young nobleman because he believed in a cause i wonder today if we could lay down our rights you see we don't come to an altar to to get something we come to give something up if you completely surrender he's promised to fill you he's promised to give you but you keep standing and say well i got a right to have a family i got a right to be married i got a right to i got a right to hunt i got a right to fish i got right to do all these things but what about his rights well ben i got i got a right i had to be out at a certain time to watch the nfl game but what about his rights he has a right to be worshipped by his queen he has a right to be welcomed not just in the church but into your home into your life would you stand for his rights today now look in your life how do you do that well you take up your cross with a man named simon one day he stood on at the crossroads he didn't know why he was there he stood at the crossroads and he didn't know what was what would take place and just standing there maybe he was in town on some sort of business and standing at the crossroads here's a thump thump i'm coming up the road you see the man walking up the road stumbles right in front of him he falls before time began god knew that he would he would he would immorphy himself he would take on the mask of human frailty and god said in in that man it wasn't god that failed god can't fall but as a man he fell the body of christ fell when it did simon just happened to be standing there i read this one time and i thought god i want to view my ministry like that i don't want a great ministry i just want to be standing there when the body of christ is weak when there's a need let me be standing there you didn't even know what it was for but a roman soldier pointed him out of the crowd he said you carry his cross and he walked over and he picked it up see you've been picked out of the crowd you were born in a message home maybe go to a good church you've been picked out of a crowd you've been elected by god before the foundation of the world you carry his cross this morning well the pastor does it someone else does it but when the body of christ is weak when it seems like the enemy comes in like a flood and he tries to take away our rights let me be one who stands like simon said i'll carry the cross i'll be one who takes my position how do you do that by surrendering your rights would you raise your hands to him if you just say lord i surrender my rights today i surrender my rights everything that i am all that i am all that i want to be all my all my potential everything all my work maybe i have a job that keeps me away from the house of god but today i surrender my rights lord yes maybe i have a something i'm not doing it because a preacher said so but the lamb has a right to be worshipped the lamb has a right to be talked to if you're too embarrassed to speak up and tell your neighbor about christ maybe you're too embarrassed even to raise your hands in church but you can raise your hand now say lord i surrender that embarrassment i surrender that that sin that so easily besets me i surrender all these things that have come in my life lord let me be a protector of your rights today i give mine away voluntarily so that you can come fill me with your holy spirit refill me with your
