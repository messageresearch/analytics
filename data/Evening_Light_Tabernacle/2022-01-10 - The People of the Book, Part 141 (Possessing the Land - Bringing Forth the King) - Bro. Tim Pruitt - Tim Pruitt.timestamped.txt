[16:36] there at house of fellowship with
[16:38] brother danny steeman
[16:40] kind of had a different sort of service
[16:43] and
[16:43] outdoors and
[16:45] [Music]
[16:46] sleeping outdoors camping outdoors you
[16:48] know i i told them i think it's good you
[16:50] know you get out of your comfort zone
[16:52] and
[16:53] comfortable places where you've been
[16:54] comfortable and just get away from that
[16:57] get away from a certain building and
[16:59] just realize it's truly between you and
[17:01] god
[17:02] doesn't matter where you're at it's
[17:03] between you and him you can have church
[17:05] no matter where you're at
[17:07] amen and so the church is not a building
[17:09] the church is the people
[17:11] amen and so we we were able to have a
[17:14] wonderful time of
[17:16] of just rejoicing in the things of god
[17:18] and god brought many deliverances there
[17:21] as you can see my voice has been weak
[17:22] from that because it was a very
[17:24] damp environment from the fog and things
[17:27] that would settle in in the evenings but
[17:29] amen god was so good to us
[17:31] we're thankful to him for all that he'd
[17:33] done
[17:34] amen

[52:17] when a man of god gets in the anointing
[52:20] of the spirit
[52:21] he prophesies unto the spirit
[52:24] may my words today be more than the

[58:37] moses my servant is dead now therefore

[1:00:33] amen god bless you you can be seated
[1:00:35] actually one of the last sermons on 2019
[1:00:39] in december
[1:00:40] was taken from this chapter
[1:00:43] and now we have just um finished um
[1:00:46] 2021
[1:00:48] and we start out a new year i'm back
[1:00:50] here at the same place in the scripture
[1:00:54] and today we're going to be speaking on
[1:00:56] possessing the land and i have a a
[1:00:59] subtitle for this that we'll get into
[1:01:01] more this evening i hope you're prepared
[1:01:04] for two services today
[1:01:07] amen there is not going to be a light
[1:01:09] fair a light fair today it's going to be
[1:01:11] a full spread
[1:01:13] amen so you know we're going to be given
[1:01:16] all that we have today as we
[1:01:19] look into this but the second part will
[1:01:22] be more on bringing forth the king but
[1:01:24] today we're in this part we're going to
[1:01:26] be
[1:01:27] uh setting the platform for that making
[1:01:30] preparations to bring forth the king
[1:01:33] now
[1:01:35] so as we
[1:01:36] as we
[1:01:37] look at this as i said one
[1:01:40] uh
[1:01:41] one of the things is we heard the song a
[1:01:43] moment ago that the devil doesn't have
[1:01:46] enough that god's a mighty conqueror
[1:01:48] and we're here today
[1:01:50] standing here by the grace of god
[1:01:53] i think of a dream that i had in march
[1:01:55] of 20 uh 2020 as we were beginning the
[1:01:59] year and
[1:02:00] the early part of that year that i had a
[1:02:02] dream that i was i was straightening out
[1:02:05] a highway
[1:02:06] and i was making the preparations for a
[1:02:09] road and and um you know straightening
[1:02:12] out its curves and pulling down its
[1:02:14] heels and making a a a a a real highway
[1:02:19] for to to ride upon
[1:02:21] and um and so as i as i did
[1:02:25] um someone stopped and and came a very
[1:02:28] angry a group of men and
[1:02:31] one of them pulled a
[1:02:32] pulled a pistol and pull it out and
[1:02:34] aimed it straight at me
[1:02:36] point blake was in about
[1:02:38] within
[1:02:39] you know seven or eight feet away and
[1:02:41] just point blank and shot shot me and as
[1:02:44] it did i woke up with the sound of the
[1:02:47] pistol
[1:02:48] but i was i was totally unharmed
[1:02:52] you know it never touched me and i i you
[1:02:54] know it totally missed
[1:02:56] and that's exactly what i say to satan
[1:02:58] i've been shot at
[1:03:00] but you missed
[1:03:02] i'm still standing here
[1:03:04] and we're still going to make the
[1:03:06] preparation for the coming of the lord
[1:03:09] prepare a people in their hearts for his
[1:03:11] coming
[1:03:12] and i believe that i'm a part of the
[1:03:14] forerunner ministry who was to make
[1:03:16] straight that path for the coming of the
[1:03:18] messiah and of course we know the
[1:03:20] message started as with john the baptist
[1:03:23] as he forerunned the first coming of
[1:03:25] christ
[1:03:26] and um and then of course then we we
[1:03:30] hear of
[1:03:32] the same thing being told in this last
[1:03:34] day that there had to be a highway
[1:03:36] prepared
[1:03:38] for the lord to come
[1:03:40] and we're still in the very phases of
[1:03:43] his coming
[1:03:45] and so there still must be preparations
[1:03:48] made
[1:03:50] to receive the king
[1:03:52] so now as we thought i think of this um
[1:03:55] you know joshua of course as you
[1:03:58] remember he was a one of those two spies
[1:04:01] he went to spy out the lamb he was a
[1:04:04] forerunner going into that land
[1:04:07] no one had ever been there before and go
[1:04:11] and and moses would send 12 men and they
[1:04:14] would go in as forerunners to come and
[1:04:17] tell them about this land that none of
[1:04:20] them had ever seen
[1:04:22] and it was a land that moses had never
[1:04:26] seen none of israel had ever seen it you
[1:04:29] would think you know moses meets the
[1:04:32] pillar of fire and he said you're to
[1:04:34] take him to that land that moses would
[1:04:35] have went down and scouted it all out
[1:04:38] and said you know is it really is it
[1:04:40] really there you know where is it i'm
[1:04:42] taking them to
[1:04:43] but no moses has never been there
[1:04:47] nobody none of them had ever been there
[1:04:51] and they had left egypt to go to a land
[1:04:54] unseen
[1:04:56] that they'd only heard of that was only
[1:04:58] written in the word before them and
[1:05:01] spoken of by prophets before them yet no
[1:05:05] one had ever been there before
[1:05:07] and there were two of them that went
[1:05:09] that were of a different spirit than the
[1:05:11] rest of the spies
[1:05:13] i mean they they had a different spirit
[1:05:16] they had a spirit about them of we're
[1:05:20] going to this land and we're going there
[1:05:23] to bring back the report of what kind of
[1:05:25] a land it is and we're going to testify
[1:05:29] of what god's word said
[1:05:31] no matter what we see we're going to
[1:05:34] testify what god's word said
[1:05:37] because even if we see desert lands we
[1:05:40] know the transforming power of god
[1:05:43] can turn it into a land flowing of milk
[1:05:46] and honey it really doesn't matter what
[1:05:48] our eyes are going to see we're going to
[1:05:51] bring back witness of what the word said
[1:05:55] amen
[1:05:56] and joshua and caleb would return back
[1:05:58] with the evidence of the fruit of that
[1:06:00] land
[1:06:02] oh i love thinking about it they come
[1:06:04] back with three fruits
[1:06:06] three pools of his of it bearing the
[1:06:08] fruit of that lamb they brought back
[1:06:11] clusters of grapes that two men had to
[1:06:14] pack
[1:06:15] they they brought back pomegranates and
[1:06:17] figs
[1:06:19] and they brought back the fruit of the
[1:06:21] land that they'd never seen and they
[1:06:22] could come back and say the land is
[1:06:25] really there
[1:06:27] i've been on it
[1:06:28] i've seen its mountains i've seen its
[1:06:31] valleys i've seen its waters i all
[1:06:34] influenced with milk and honey
[1:06:37] amen the land is real it is there in
[1:06:40] other words it's a fertile land and
[1:06:43] there's lots of room for cattle to get
[1:06:46] milk and and there's lots of grass there
[1:06:49] what they can eat and lots of
[1:06:52] lots of blossoms so there's so much that
[1:06:54] the bees can have sweet nectar to make
[1:06:57] honey it flows with milk and honey
[1:07:01] it's a goodly land let us go up at once
[1:07:04] and possess it
[1:07:08] joshua his name meant jehovah's savior
[1:07:14] two thousand years later
[1:07:16] there would come another
[1:07:18] joshua
[1:07:19] yeshua
[1:07:21] yeshua is
[1:07:23] we call him jesus
[1:07:25] because in our translators in the king
[1:07:28] james it would to differentiate between
[1:07:31] the joshua of the old testament
[1:07:34] they would they would use the greek form
[1:07:37] of the name joshua
[1:07:39] to call his name jesus
[1:07:42] but he is joshua or yeshua
[1:07:46] which means jehovah the savior
[1:07:50] you see
[1:07:51] joshua the old testament was only it was
[1:07:54] only portraying and speaking of the
[1:07:57] greater joshua
[1:07:59] that would come
[1:08:01] amen and jesus there would he was also a
[1:08:04] forerunner the bible said he was the
[1:08:06] forerunner that went into the veil
[1:08:10] the bible calls him a forerunner and he
[1:08:13] went into the realms of the blessed and
[1:08:15] he brought back evidence of the land and
[1:08:19] he showed us there is life after death
[1:08:23] hallelujah there is resurrection power
[1:08:26] promised to the believer
[1:08:28] amen he brings back the fruit of that
[1:08:30] other land and it shows there's an empty
[1:08:33] tomb come on somebody amen there's a
[1:08:36] resurrected saints
[1:08:38] i didn't raise the lawn but with me came
[1:08:41] all the saints of the old testament
[1:08:44] hallelujah not one left in paradise not
[1:08:48] one left there in a holding place but
[1:08:50] every one of them brought back and
[1:08:51] glorified
[1:08:53] amen here's the evidence
[1:08:56] of glorified saints
[1:08:59] and here's the evidence of a glorified
[1:09:01] body
[1:09:03] amen because here i am thomas feel my
[1:09:07] hands

[1:09:14] it's true
[1:09:16] it's a real land
[1:09:18] there is life after death
[1:09:22] come on church
[1:09:23] amen i've been to that round
[1:09:25] and i conquered death
[1:09:27] and i conquered hell and i rose up on
[1:09:30] the third day and i'm alive forevermore
[1:09:34] hallelujah but more than that i want to
[1:09:36] give you an evidence i want you to taste
[1:09:40] of it i'm going to pour out resurrected
[1:09:42] life on the day of pentecost and on that
[1:09:45] day of pentacles you will be filled with
[1:09:48] the evidence of that lamb
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:52] it will be
[1:09:54] it will be the deposit
[1:09:58] amen this this taste
[1:10:01] this taste of the holy ghost
[1:10:03] will be a deposit
[1:10:06] until you get the full inheritance
[1:10:10] it's not all of it
[1:10:12] it's a forechase
[1:10:15] this is what joshua and caleb would say
[1:10:18] the grapes are this big
[1:10:20] two of us had to pack it the
[1:10:21] pomegranates are this sweet
[1:10:23] hey man the
[1:10:24] the pigs are this this wonderful
[1:10:27] here is all of this
[1:10:30] and it's proof the land exists
[1:10:34] and jesus brings back
[1:10:36] proof
[1:10:37] of that land
[1:10:42] and it gives us an abstract title d to
[1:10:44] the land a deposit
[1:10:47] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:51] now 2 000 years later
[1:10:55] seven church ages
[1:10:58] god is not leaving us without a witness
[1:11:03] we're here now
[1:11:05] as a fulfilling of all the types
[1:11:10] now i'm just going to digress a minute
[1:11:12] and i'll pick up the stock
[1:11:14] because i want you to kind of get an
[1:11:15] overview of where i'm going
[1:11:18] because in my
[1:11:20] in my own personal devotions
[1:11:23] i have just finished all of the chapters
[1:11:26] of the book of joshua
[1:11:29] then i was going to go to the book of
[1:11:31] judges which follows judge which follows
[1:11:33] joshua
[1:11:34] but instead
[1:11:36] my finger hit as i was listening to a
[1:11:39] bible app
[1:11:41] my finger hid upon
[1:11:43] the book of ruth
[1:11:46] so i listened to the book of ruth
[1:11:48] then i go back to the book of joshua
[1:11:51] and then i go through the book of samuel
[1:11:54] now
[1:11:55] as we're looking at this
[1:11:58] we're going to be today
[1:12:00] as i as we're looking at this we're
[1:12:02] going to be looking at going into the
[1:12:05] land of promises that we're at
[1:12:08] with the purpose of
[1:12:10] bringing forth the king
[1:12:15] so i'm laying some background here and
[1:12:17] as i do i want you to see
[1:12:20] a forerunner has already went
[1:12:23] and he comes to take you into
[1:12:26] a realm that has been previously unknown
[1:12:31] and and it's been written about in the
[1:12:33] scripture but it's not known
[1:12:36] until a personal witness goes over is
[1:12:39] just when caleb brings back report and
[1:12:42] it's jesus the second joshua goes over
[1:12:45] into and gets the report
[1:12:48] now 2000 years
[1:12:51] later here we are again
[1:12:54] we're now here in the in another place
[1:12:58] where god is not leaving us without a
[1:13:00] witness
[1:13:02] but once again god sends a messenger
[1:13:05] he sends a forerunner
[1:13:07] i mean he even wants to make it so plain
[1:13:10] that he will actually have a bible come
[1:13:13] out from out of the ceiling
[1:13:16] and come down like this
[1:13:19] and appear there as brother branham will
[1:13:21] watch this and then the scriptures
[1:13:23] unfold to joshua chapter one
[1:13:27] and then the first fingers there of his
[1:13:30] finger go down verses 1 through 9
[1:13:34] right here joshua chapter 1 through 9.
[1:13:39] and so as it does
[1:13:41] as it does you know he's telling him
[1:13:44] as i was with moses
[1:13:47] so will i be with you
[1:13:50] just don't
[1:13:51] do not
[1:13:52] do not move from the word you got to
[1:13:55] stay on the promise
[1:13:57] don't let nothing move you off of that
[1:14:00] amen i give you a promise
[1:14:02] you can take the land
[1:14:04] take it all
[1:14:06] take every bit of it
[1:14:08] amen and so with you know in that land
[1:14:11] that we would be able to see things
[1:14:14] through the prophetic eye
[1:14:16] amen as a forerunner allowed us to look
[1:14:19] through his eyes and brings that back to
[1:14:22] us jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:14:26] and forever
[1:14:27] and with the first pull of his ministry
[1:14:29] he would show us the fruits of the land
[1:14:32] and there would be the power of healing
[1:14:35] because there's healing in this land
[1:14:38] hallelujah the power of healing and the
[1:14:40] land is miracles and the blind would see
[1:14:44] and the death heard the dumb spoke and
[1:14:47] the lame walked
[1:14:49] come on church
[1:14:50] amen what was god doing he was showing
[1:14:53] you evidence
[1:14:54] i'm a living god
[1:14:56] the land is real
[1:14:58] amen what i said in the word is true i'm
[1:15:01] the healer of ever disease amen i am
[1:15:04] there for you i am to be god over you
[1:15:08] come on church and this is your land in
[1:15:10] it is miracles and it is healing and it
[1:15:14] is deliverance and it is salvation
[1:15:18] every bit of it
[1:15:20] lays within this land
[1:15:23] and he would show it and let us all
[1:15:25] taste of it
[1:15:26] and hear of it
[1:15:28] hey man i'm sure the elders would get to
[1:15:31] take it but maybe there wasn't enough to
[1:15:33] go to every other but everybody could
[1:15:34] hear the elders report it's good it
[1:15:38] tastes wonderful
[1:15:41] it's real
[1:15:43] here's fruits of it
[1:15:45] you know in fort wayne indiana
[1:15:47] when praying for a child with polio and
[1:15:50] was unable to walk the pianist was
[1:15:53] playing the great position now is near
[1:15:56] the sympathizing jesus
[1:15:59] and he took a a child in his arms that
[1:16:01] was a afflicted with polio
[1:16:04] and he began to pray over this hideously
[1:16:07] crippled child whose limbs were useless
[1:16:11] and as he began to pray a bright light
[1:16:14] appeared over him shining brightly in
[1:16:16] his face
[1:16:18] and and he looks up thinking it's the
[1:16:20] custodian in the auditorium who is
[1:16:23] rudely just showing on bright lights
[1:16:25] upon him
[1:16:26] and he opens his eyes
[1:16:28] to to say to say please uh whoever that
[1:16:31] is don't put that light on me and as he
[1:16:34] does he sees this huge star coming down
[1:16:37] from from from up above whirling above
[1:16:40] him and it's so surprised until he drops
[1:16:44] the child
[1:16:45] and the child hit the ground running
[1:16:48] and began to run to his mother and the
[1:16:50] mother joyfully reaching out to her son
[1:16:53] saw the light and fainted
[1:16:56] and at that moment the pianos jumped up
[1:16:58] dancing with the spirit speaking of
[1:17:00] singing in an unknown tongue while the
[1:17:03] piano kept right on playing
[1:17:06] hallelujah amen the great position now
[1:17:10] is near the sympathizing jesus
[1:17:14] hallelujah what was that showing us
[1:17:16] fruits
[1:17:17] of the unseen
[1:17:19] tangible fruits
[1:17:21] that the land is real
[1:17:24] amen oh you remember something similar
[1:17:27] happened last year's brother timothy was
[1:17:29] preaching at brother ron spencer's and
[1:17:32] his he was declaring that god had come
[1:17:34] down
[1:17:35] then his ipad which he was
[1:17:37] about eight feet away from it without a
[1:17:40] without a watch on that would that would
[1:17:42] um be programmed with it without any
[1:17:45] wait for it to happen and the ones on
[1:17:47] the stage would watch it close out the
[1:17:49] program of this of his notes
[1:17:52] open up another program where he never
[1:17:55] played tapes on or sermons of brother
[1:17:57] branham select a sermon and start
[1:18:00] playing there on his ipad
[1:18:02] and and brother branham began to speak
[1:18:05] and as he began to speak he was talking
[1:18:07] about him now timothy's preaching down
[1:18:10] how he has come down
[1:18:12] how he is here among us
[1:18:14] and he's telling about the hymn brother
[1:18:17] branham is talking about to him there
[1:18:19] down from his glory and he said it
[1:18:22] expresses the extreme deity of the lord
[1:18:25] jesus
[1:18:26] and especially in a day like this when
[1:18:28] they try to make him just a prophet he
[1:18:31] was more than a prophet
[1:18:33] he was god
[1:18:34] what was god doing once again declaring
[1:18:37] he has come down am i more than just
[1:18:41] sending a prophet
[1:18:43] but christ has come down
[1:18:45] and is in our midst and he's opening up
[1:18:48] the land of the supernatural
[1:18:50] and he says it's all real for you
[1:18:53] i want you to know the land it's there
[1:18:56] that you can possess it all
[1:18:59] am i whatever it is maybe the enemy has
[1:19:01] held back something from you
[1:19:03] you have been there with your complex or
[1:19:06] you've been there with your heartache or
[1:19:08] you've been with with your problem let
[1:19:10] me tell you the land there is flowing
[1:19:12] with milk and honey
[1:19:14] it is enough for your marriage it's
[1:19:17] enough for your home it's enough for
[1:19:19] your children it's enough healing in it
[1:19:22] for your sickness it's enough
[1:19:33] timothy and i would go to his mom's
[1:19:35] bedside at the icu
[1:19:37] she'd not spoken in 17 hours
[1:19:41] when he told her
[1:19:43] god has come down mother
[1:19:46] mom god's come down he's here
[1:19:49] she started singing
[1:19:51] down from his glory ever living story
[1:19:54] my god and savior came and jesus was his
[1:19:57] name
[1:19:58] born in a manger to his own a stranger
[1:20:01] a man of sorrow tears and agony and she
[1:20:04] broke out into the course she started
[1:20:07] weeping and crying
[1:20:09] and and singing oh how i love him how i
[1:20:12] adore him my breath my sunshine
[1:20:15] my all in all
[1:20:17] what was it is god showing us he was
[1:20:20] present in our situation
[1:20:23] and that the supernatural
[1:20:26] god is real
[1:20:29] amen just later just before my wife
[1:20:32] crossed over
[1:20:34] brother derek paris
[1:20:36] who he and his family have now moved
[1:20:38] here from washington state it was about
[1:20:40] 6 30 in the morning when he awoke
[1:20:43] and he awoke too and was awake when a
[1:20:46] man started walking into his room
[1:20:49] and he was holding an official document
[1:20:52] like this
[1:20:53] holding official document in his hand
[1:20:56] and trying to hand it to him
[1:20:58] and he saw him there
[1:21:01] and he's looking at the paper there and
[1:21:03] he saw it was an official document
[1:21:06] and and he was holding it out for him to
[1:21:08] take and said and he said karen pruitt
[1:21:11] is being ushered
[1:21:12] to the other side
[1:21:17] you see what is that it's god's showing
[1:21:20] us
[1:21:22] hallelujah that nothing's out of control
[1:21:25] that's why i could rejoice the other
[1:21:27] night when philip sang oh i know if his
[1:21:30] eyes on this peril
[1:21:32] that he i know he was watching over her
[1:21:35] and welcomed her home into a land
[1:21:38] flowing with milk and honey
[1:21:40] hallelujah daryl mouth is the fourth she
[1:21:44] slipped over into the other side and the
[1:21:46] old ship a zion carrier over
[1:21:49] hallelujah
[1:21:51] and she joins the voices of those on the
[1:21:55] other side brother branham heard saying
[1:21:58] keep pressing on
[1:22:03] just beyond the river there's a better
[1:22:05] land
[1:22:06] keep pressing till we meet in that land
[1:22:12] brother branham as
[1:22:14] as a joshua
[1:22:16] crossed the river jordan
[1:22:18] that barrier between
[1:22:21] the dimensions
[1:22:22] of earthly mortal life
[1:22:25] and the dimensions
[1:22:27] of the heavenly immortal life
[1:22:30] with just
[1:22:31] one breath
[1:22:34] one breath away
[1:22:36] moving into another dimension of about
[1:22:38] 12 feet above his head
[1:22:41] he by looking back could see his mortal
[1:22:43] body laying on the bed
[1:22:46] yet he was alive
[1:22:47] he had all of his senses
[1:22:50] except they were greater
[1:22:52] that and and there he could he could
[1:22:56] sense a great feeling of
[1:22:59] of that fundamental element of the
[1:23:01] nature of god
[1:23:03] divine love
[1:23:05] the holy ghost now totally surrounded
[1:23:08] him
[1:23:09] in his fullness
[1:23:11] and he could look down at his hands and
[1:23:13] he could tell they were young and new
[1:23:16] he could he looked there at his body and
[1:23:20] any complete control of his senses he
[1:23:22] could see he could and back to the
[1:23:24] matter is not only could he see but he
[1:23:26] said i had a greater sense of sight
[1:23:28] there
[1:23:29] than what i even have here
[1:23:32] and he said our senses are magnified and
[1:23:35] he said i i hear i i looked and there
[1:23:38] were hundreds that were greeting him and
[1:23:41] they were young
[1:23:42] and his senses were greater as i said
[1:23:45] and with one breath he had slipped into
[1:23:48] the present intermediate heaven of the
[1:23:51] angelic realm
[1:23:53] around that is distinctly separate from
[1:23:56] earth yet having more physical qualities
[1:23:58] than than you might assume
[1:24:01] you see he he met thousands of people
[1:24:04] who who were who are dwelling in
[1:24:07] tangible physical bodies
[1:24:11] amen yet in some ways unlike us because
[1:24:13] they're yet spiritual amen in fact to
[1:24:17] the matter is he would use the word
[1:24:19] theophany
[1:24:20] to describe their condition which means
[1:24:23] an appearance of god
[1:24:25] because now they were not just
[1:24:28] as men but they were now in another form
[1:24:32] in a spiritual condition yet a physical
[1:24:34] condition
[1:24:36] and yep yet in that realm there they
[1:24:39] could feel
[1:24:40] and they could be felt
[1:24:42] they were white robes and he could see
[1:24:45] at the same time the dimensions of the
[1:24:48] mortal and the immortal
[1:24:50] he could look back at his himself laying
[1:24:53] on the bed and he could look around and
[1:24:55] see a land
[1:24:57] a man filled with bluegrass and
[1:24:59] thousands upon thousands coming waiting
[1:25:02] to greet him and one's coming to say
[1:25:05] clapping him on the back and say we've
[1:25:07] been waiting for you to come
[1:25:09] amen we knew you were coming
[1:25:12] and as he did they were wearing clothes
[1:25:15] of white and women with beautiful long
[1:25:18] hair and men with theirs probably to you
[1:25:21] know around their shoulder their teeth
[1:25:23] were all straight
[1:25:25] and they shone like pearls
[1:25:27] their eyes were bright and glistened to
[1:25:30] stars on the darkened night and with one
[1:25:32] great big joy they
[1:25:35] embraced him
[1:25:37] amen clapping him on the back and loving
[1:25:40] him and saying we're so glad you are
[1:25:43] here
[1:25:44] amen you see we have had a joshua
[1:25:48] a forerunner bringing back report of
[1:25:50] that land
[1:25:52] that the land is real
[1:25:55] and it flows with milk and honey
[1:25:57] there's no dying there there's no
[1:26:00] sickness there there's no yesterday or
[1:26:02] tomorrow there's no regrets
[1:26:06] hallelujah it's all one great big joy
[1:26:13] i think
[1:26:15] a brother
[1:26:16] a brother duplicitous
[1:26:18] in south africa
[1:26:20] he went to brother willie retice church
[1:26:23] in johannesburg
[1:26:25] he died during surgery
[1:26:28] and he tells of his story of his
[1:26:30] experience
[1:26:32] now before the surgery and this is
[1:26:34] important before his surgery there was a
[1:26:37] believer's child in israel that kept
[1:26:40] asking his mom to pray for brother
[1:26:41] duplicitous
[1:26:43] and he could be this child could be
[1:26:45] heard praying at the in at the table in
[1:26:48] other times asking god to be with
[1:26:50] brother duplessis
[1:26:52] no one's in israel and the others in
[1:26:54] south africa
[1:26:56] brother sydney jackson
[1:26:58] a a a a
[1:27:01] a man who brother madam talked about and
[1:27:03] who was a spiritual man he had a word
[1:27:05] from the lord saying
[1:27:07] brother depresses hospital operation
[1:27:10] pray
[1:27:12] another church in cape town south africa
[1:27:15] and their service their sunday service
[1:27:17] they all got down and they started
[1:27:19] praying and the spirit spoke
[1:27:22] he said brother duplicitous and they
[1:27:23] felt
[1:27:24] a compelling urge to pray for him and
[1:27:27] got down again because the spirit urged
[1:27:30] upon them calling his name brother
[1:27:32] duplicitous
[1:27:33] they all got down to pray
[1:27:35] you know it's it's so important
[1:27:39] that we be a people that can hear his
[1:27:41] voice
[1:27:44] amen not just the people who talk about
[1:27:47] something in the past
[1:27:49] but where god is acting among us
[1:27:53] and there are men and women that can say
[1:27:55] i pray from god
[1:27:57] god spoke to me
[1:27:59] i hear brother branham say it and hear
[1:28:01] his voice the prophet spoke of those
[1:28:03] days when they were for teaching return
[1:28:05] teach men's doctrine not god's doctrine
[1:28:08] and we've seen so much of that it's gone
[1:28:11] on so long and today the word of the
[1:28:13] lord is a rare thing
[1:28:15] that someone can come and say thus saith
[1:28:18] the lord
[1:28:20] now we've had a lot of impersonations of
[1:28:22] that and there's a lot of the problem
[1:28:25] because of the
[1:28:26] impersonators we want to throw away the
[1:28:29] real
[1:28:31] because they have impersonated tongues
[1:28:33] we don't want nobody speaking in tongues
[1:28:36] because they've impersonated a misused
[1:28:38] prophecy and interpretation we don't
[1:28:41] want that in our church no more
[1:28:43] so we throw out god because of the
[1:28:46] impersonators
[1:28:48] now listen to it he said we've had a lot
[1:28:50] of impersonations on that satan's really
[1:28:53] on the job
[1:28:54] and many years have gone by where people
[1:28:56] were afraid to say that unless it was
[1:28:59] the lord but today they don't care but
[1:29:01] it's a rare thing to hear the voice of
[1:29:03] the lord and to find a person that can
[1:29:05] say the lord spoke to me
[1:29:08] you notice that among the people anymore
[1:29:10] that they hardly hear a time when they
[1:29:12] say the lord spoke to me
[1:29:15] when men and women used to pray all
[1:29:17] night and their homes were set in order
[1:29:20] by the book of the lord and god was
[1:29:22] first in their home
[1:29:25] amen
[1:29:27] now
[1:29:28] you know the bible is very clear like
[1:29:30] first thessalonians 5 19
[1:29:33] says wherefore brother covet to prophesy
[1:29:36] and forbid not to speak with tongues
[1:29:40] it says since first corinthians 14 39
[1:29:43] wherefore brothers come to prophesy for
[1:29:46] forbid not just and forbid not to speak
[1:29:48] with tongues and first thessalonians 5
[1:29:50] 19 quits not the spirit despise not
[1:29:53] prophecy
[1:29:54] and but but you see it's come to a point
[1:29:57] that
[1:29:58] nobody wants to hear the voice of god
[1:30:01] they can hear voices of theology
[1:30:04] and argue the scripture
[1:30:07] but to say i heard from god god spoke to
[1:30:10] me
[1:30:11] god revealed himself
[1:30:14] it's hard for people anymore to even
[1:30:16] have that experience in their lives
[1:30:19] but there is hope
[1:30:21] revelation 10 11 he said unto me thou
[1:30:24] must prophesy again
[1:30:26] before many peoples and nations and
[1:30:29] tongues and people there's going to be a
[1:30:31] people in the last days
[1:30:33] can i say it this way there is a people
[1:30:36] in the last days
[1:30:37] amen that prophesies that speak the word
[1:30:40] of god amen and they're doing it before
[1:30:43] many people and nations and tongues or
[1:30:46] languages and kings
[1:30:49] brother duplesses after surgery on his
[1:30:52] stomach
[1:30:53] he was transported back to the ward
[1:30:56] and he found that he as he was coming
[1:30:58] back that he was choking he couldn't
[1:31:00] breathe
[1:31:01] they had what he called pipes or tubes
[1:31:04] down his throat
[1:31:05] and he tried his his wife came uh to him
[1:31:09] there as he was pushed back into the
[1:31:11] ward and he tried to mount to his wife
[1:31:13] who's standing near him i can't breathe
[1:31:16] and she recognized the problem and got
[1:31:18] the nurse's attention and
[1:31:21] and
[1:31:22] and he died there on the table
[1:31:26] and suddenly
[1:31:27] he lifted from his body about as high as
[1:31:30] the door
[1:31:31] but there as he was there out of his
[1:31:34] body he said i was in full control of
[1:31:37] all my senses
[1:31:38] i could see
[1:31:40] i felt fine
[1:31:42] i wasn't sick i wasn't hurting
[1:31:47] amen here i am outside of my body and
[1:31:50] i'm looking down on my body that they're
[1:31:53] working over and said i saw the nurses
[1:31:56] there um there they were trying to
[1:31:59] revive my body working over my body and
[1:32:02] he said i had no pain there was no
[1:32:05] distress there was no anxiety i was in
[1:32:08] complete control of this rejoice
[1:32:13] and he said he watched the doctors as
[1:32:16] they rest him back to surgery and
[1:32:18] suddenly he saw a bright light and that
[1:32:21] moment he was right back into his body
[1:32:24] again
[1:32:27] you see
[1:32:29] god's showing us once again
[1:32:34] the proof
[1:32:36] of another land
[1:32:39] the proof of another land
[1:32:42] now with the second phase of the fruits
[1:32:45] the next through the land it showed us
[1:32:47] the power of the word to discern the
[1:32:50] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:32:52] that we are known of god
[1:32:55] amen and it showed us if god could go
[1:32:57] back 40 years in our life
[1:32:59] amen he could show a prophet before the
[1:33:01] foundation of the world
[1:33:03] what was in god's mind and what god was
[1:33:06] thinking amen and so so therefore it
[1:33:10] showed that we were known of god that
[1:33:12] your name is so-and-so you came from a
[1:33:15] certain place this is your house number
[1:33:18] that god is a personal god
[1:33:20] come on church amen he's not just a
[1:33:23] distant god
[1:33:25] teach yourself and wake up do not go to
[1:33:27] sleep on me this morning i have to come
[1:33:29] down and preach in your face i'll do it
[1:33:32] i've spent too much time before the lord
[1:33:34] to let you miss this
[1:33:37] amen they're in the presence of god are
[1:33:39] you with me
[1:33:40] amen god was making us known i'm a
[1:33:43] personal god
[1:33:44] i know your name
[1:33:46] i know your disease i know your
[1:33:48] affliction i know your future
[1:33:51] [Applause]
[1:33:53] i know your past
[1:33:55] i know your presence situation and i
[1:33:58] know your future
[1:34:00] [Applause]
[1:34:04] i'm not a distant god i want to be known
[1:34:07] in this last age as a person of god
[1:34:15] now
[1:34:19] it showed us also
[1:34:21] the word
[1:34:22] had come down
[1:34:25] because only the word the son of man
[1:34:29] discerns the thoughts in the intents of
[1:34:32] the heart
[1:34:34] so in the ministry of the son of man
[1:34:36] which would have to be
[1:34:38] you know
[1:34:39] as it was in the days of lot so shall it
[1:34:41] be when the son of man is revealed where
[1:34:44] the word is revealed so god would know
[1:34:47] and and let us know i know your thoughts
[1:34:50] and i know my thoughts i have to you
[1:34:53] jeremiah says it well he said i know the
[1:34:55] thoughts that i have of you
[1:34:57] they are a peace
[1:34:59] and not of evil
[1:35:00] and brother branham says in the message
[1:35:02] of desperation when he quotes that
[1:35:04] scripture he said to bring you back to
[1:35:07] your appointed place and he said that
[1:35:09] place is pentecost
[1:35:12] hallelujah because that's exactly the
[1:35:14] expected year to bring this bride back
[1:35:16] to the original condition
[1:35:19] this is what joshua was doing he was
[1:35:22] bringing them back to abraham's lab to a
[1:35:25] land of faith to land the promise to a
[1:35:28] land of change
[1:35:32] hallelujah where he would change and
[1:35:35] serve a tree to a land to bring him the
[1:35:38] seed
[1:35:43] there's so many parts of this
[1:35:46] i'm trying to bring it all in to you
[1:35:48] where you can as i gather together into
[1:35:51] one vein
[1:35:52] of possessing
[1:35:54] what abraham had
[1:35:56] what he walked over
[1:35:58] possessing what the apostles had what
[1:36:00] they walked over
[1:36:02] possessing what brother branham saw
[1:36:04] come on church amen possessing complete
[1:36:07] possession of a new body
[1:36:10] of a glorified state
[1:36:12] amen hallelujah amen taking us all the
[1:36:16] way to bringing forth the king
[1:36:23] and finally
[1:36:26] on the third pole the secret mystery
[1:36:28] truce
[1:36:30] were restored back to the church
[1:36:32] the seals taken off
[1:36:34] open of the book
[1:36:36] given us the pure message of paul's
[1:36:38] gospel
[1:36:40] bringing us back to the gospel of jesus
[1:36:42] christ so this gospel could be preached
[1:36:44] into all the world so the end could come
[1:36:48] now joshua would come
[1:36:51] to to flood stage of the river
[1:36:54] i'm going to take my jacket off
[1:36:59] because we're going to cover a lot of
[1:37:01] territory today as we go through
[1:37:03] these parts of the book of joshua as
[1:37:06] we're heading over in now
[1:37:08] to the days
[1:37:09] of samuel and eva and eli
[1:37:13] we'll get to some of that in the second
[1:37:15] service
[1:37:16] but joshua would come at the time of a
[1:37:18] flood stage of the river jordan
[1:37:21] where it looked like it was impossible
[1:37:23] to cross
[1:37:25] god did not bring them in a time where
[1:37:27] it was a trickle
[1:37:29] but where the river now is in blood
[1:37:31] stage
[1:37:33] and the people crosses over following
[1:37:35] the ark
[1:37:36] and the word
[1:37:37] had to be placed upon the shoulders of
[1:37:40] the levites
[1:37:42] now this is god's ordained way
[1:37:45] for the ministry to shoulder the word
[1:37:49] amen for the people to follow the
[1:37:51] ministry as they carry the word
[1:37:55] not just follow the ministry
[1:37:58] but follow the word as the ministry
[1:38:01] carries the word
[1:38:02] that's what brother bradham said when
[1:38:04] you know we we hear it all the time stay
[1:38:06] with your pastor you know which was said
[1:38:08] to brother neville but let me say you
[1:38:10] know it's it's more than that if you
[1:38:13] hear a prophet saying also if a man
[1:38:15] leaves the word
[1:38:17] then you leave the man
[1:38:19] never leave the word come on
[1:38:22] joshua is instructed to take this laugh
[1:38:25] don't turn to the right don't go to the
[1:38:27] left stay balanced stay right in the
[1:38:30] center
[1:38:31] don't get off track
[1:38:33] follow just that word as i was with
[1:38:35] moses i will be with you i will not tell
[1:38:39] you
[1:38:41] you will possess this land but you got
[1:38:44] to put your feet on it
[1:38:46] amen you got to step up my faith for
[1:38:49] your healing for your salvation for the
[1:38:52] need that you have you just can't stand
[1:38:54] back here in your easy chair
[1:38:57] you're going to fight for every
[1:38:58] possession of this word
[1:39:03] this is god's ordained way
[1:39:06] the ministry shoulder in the word later
[1:39:09] israel tried something different
[1:39:11] a man-made ox-cart
[1:39:14] trying to bring the word
[1:39:16] but no ox-cart can do it
[1:39:19] come on church
[1:39:20] hey man you you know enough of brother
[1:39:22] branham preaching about this
[1:39:25] as he preached on trying to do god a
[1:39:27] service without his will
[1:39:29] how that in the days of eli
[1:39:32] when the ark was taken during the battle
[1:39:35] and then
[1:39:36] and taken by the philistines and then
[1:39:38] plagues broke out upon them
[1:39:41] and finally they returned the ark of the
[1:39:43] covenant back to israel
[1:39:45] you see it was the philistines that put
[1:39:48] the ark on a new
[1:39:50] ox-cart
[1:39:53] amen
[1:39:54] now when david tried to do the same
[1:39:58] he failed to consult the lord about it
[1:40:01] and and
[1:40:02] how to bring it back to jerusalem or
[1:40:05] bring it to jerusalem and a good man
[1:40:07] elsa tried to steady the ark
[1:40:12] come on
[1:40:13] tried to steady the ark
[1:40:15] when the odds stumbled and god slew him
[1:40:19] showing death will happen when someone
[1:40:21] not ordained to handle the word touches
[1:40:24] the ark
[1:40:26] it causes spiritual death
[1:40:30] amen we got to have god called men
[1:40:33] god anointed men amen men who are really
[1:40:38] born
[1:40:39] preachers
[1:40:41] born preachers i in your in the world my
[1:40:45] force saw you and i would change your
[1:40:47] prophet to the
[1:40:49] a man who want to try it out for a
[1:40:52] vocation or a man who goes to school or
[1:40:54] man who gets smart enough they think i'm
[1:40:57] a business leader i can lead the church
[1:41:01] it won't work
[1:41:02] you go in there and the art and the ox
[1:41:04] will stumble at some point and you try
[1:41:06] to steady it
[1:41:08] you'll be struck dead
[1:41:11] amen that doesn't matter how anointed
[1:41:13] they are and how great a desire they
[1:41:15] have to bring the word back out of false
[1:41:17] doctrines and out of the wrong place
[1:41:20] these newfangled man-made ox-carts with
[1:41:22] their agape tablets
[1:41:26] it won't do it
[1:41:29] amen to deny the ministry to shoulder
[1:41:32] the word the ark of the covenant and put
[1:41:34] it on the oscar of some man-made system
[1:41:37] will only cause death
[1:41:42] remember david's failure is he tried to
[1:41:44] do god a service without consulting his
[1:41:46] will he failed to consult the prophet
[1:41:50] come on
[1:41:51] amen you got to consult the prophets
[1:41:53] about this
[1:41:54] jesus the god prophet said go into all
[1:41:57] the world and preach
[1:41:59] now there's no higher authority than
[1:42:01] that
[1:42:03] amen he said go into all the world and
[1:42:05] preach
[1:42:07] come on church preach
[1:42:09] he wants the word preached
[1:42:12] namely
[1:42:16] he wants men called levites
[1:42:19] called of god men ordained
[1:42:22] not men appointed
[1:42:25] not men that are smart and intellectual
[1:42:28] but men that are there because god
[1:42:30] placed them in that position
[1:42:35] amen for the more the prophet paul said
[1:42:38] preach
[1:42:40] the word
[1:42:41] the last prophet to the gentile ordained
[1:42:44] ministers to carry the word
[1:42:47] over and over
[1:42:49] saying god doesn't use machinery
[1:42:53] god uses men to preach the gospel
[1:42:56] amen in the message the ark brother
[1:42:58] brandon said he talks about the end time
[1:43:00] and what science has done in the last
[1:43:02] few years um and just the things that's
[1:43:05] done nearing the end time assigned to
[1:43:07] all believers he said ministers in the
[1:43:09] pulpit
[1:43:10] should be preaching it
[1:43:12] with all the force they got
[1:43:16] amen now listen i'm consulting the
[1:43:18] prophet
[1:43:19] amen i'm consulting the prophet how do
[1:43:22] we carry it
[1:43:24] amen with god called men
[1:43:27] ministers in the pulpit preaching
[1:43:30] it with all the force they got
[1:43:33] showing to the people we're passing
[1:43:35] milestones all things put the end the
[1:43:37] scriptural verse god's bible that we
[1:43:40] read and the and believe today is
[1:43:42] pointing to the end not much farther the
[1:43:44] great scientific world says ian's inside
[1:43:47] another great milestone the zodiac
[1:43:49] calendar so forth astronomy everything
[1:43:52] says he ends in sight the pyramid says
[1:43:54] he ends in sight and every great point
[1:43:57] in place says the end is in sight we are
[1:44:01] at the end time
[1:44:04] amen in the seven church ages he would
[1:44:06] he would pray remember the needy of god
[1:44:09] the poor of our land the poor in spirit
[1:44:11] and those that are hungry
[1:44:13] i wonder if there are those today that
[1:44:15] said i'm hungry
[1:44:17] then he said god raise up ministers
[1:44:20] everywhere
[1:44:21] fill them with the holy spirit send them
[1:44:23] forth preaching lord
[1:44:26] like firebrands
[1:44:28] anointed men
[1:44:30] god called men
[1:44:32] god separated man
[1:44:34] amen of people there who have been
[1:44:37] there as a forerunner across the river
[1:44:40] and they themselves have got a deposit
[1:44:42] of the holy ghost on the inside of them
[1:44:45] and they know the land is real they're
[1:44:48] not preaching about somebody else who
[1:44:50] crossed over and somebody else had got
[1:44:52] the holy ghost and what they had back
[1:44:54] there 40 years ago they have experienced
[1:44:57] himself they know he's a healer they
[1:45:00] know he's the deliverer they now he's a
[1:45:03] savior
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:08] said we'll only pass this way once
[1:45:10] we're only mortal once and thanks be to
[1:45:13] god for that in the next life will not
[1:45:15] preach the gospel in the next life that
[1:45:17] is to come that throws your return
[1:45:19] ministry out the door right there
[1:45:21] but we rejoice in the gospel with them
[1:45:23] of the ages who has accepted it with the
[1:45:26] head captain
[1:45:27] our lord jesus who's all worthy and all
[1:45:30] praise be to him forever and ever
[1:45:33] oh we like to quote from the absolute
[1:45:36] and here's what is the absolute sermon
[1:45:38] said
[1:45:40] no matter what your experience is
[1:45:42] then if something in you tells you that
[1:45:44] the bible isn't true
[1:45:46] that the power of god apostles prophets
[1:45:50] teachers and pastors and gifts of the
[1:45:52] spirit isn't just the same as it was
[1:45:55] when it flowed to them apostles at
[1:45:57] pentecost there's something wrong with
[1:45:59] your absolute
[1:46:01] it has to tie to a denominational creed
[1:46:04] instead of the bible
[1:46:07] and that's the problem we're trying to
[1:46:09] we you know we want to bring the
[1:46:10] prophet's voice but we want to bring it
[1:46:12] through some mechanical device because
[1:46:15] you can't find ordained god called god
[1:46:19] knowing it man to carry the word
[1:46:23] but god's got them and they're going to
[1:46:26] preach it with force
[1:46:28] we like firebrands i'm not staying here
[1:46:30] long we're just coming on down but
[1:46:33] brother branham said now to bring up
[1:46:34] this faith in christ there are ministers
[1:46:37] and that's the most important thing of
[1:46:39] the day is a good god-sent preacher
[1:46:44] i admire them and their gift is far
[1:46:46] beyond anything can be done and anything
[1:46:48] else is a preacher a man who knows how
[1:46:51] to rightly divide the word of god
[1:46:55] amen
[1:46:57] the most wonderful gift in the world is
[1:46:59] to be a minister
[1:47:02] which is a new testament modern day
[1:47:04] prophet
[1:47:06] a preacher prophesy meets the foretell
[1:47:09] or tells some personal things in other
[1:47:11] words you read the bible and and tell
[1:47:14] then that's a teacher but a prophecy is
[1:47:17] to to prophesy is to tell or foretell
[1:47:20] and that's the spirit of christ is
[1:47:22] prophecy
[1:47:24] now
[1:47:25] let me just tell you i mean david now
[1:47:29] making his ox cart like the denomination
[1:47:32] did trying to bring the word back
[1:47:34] you know trying to do well you know they
[1:47:36] messed it up and they they've done wrong
[1:47:38] with it and it's in the wrong place and
[1:47:40] we'll put it in the right place and and
[1:47:43] all of that but he didn't consult the
[1:47:44] prophet
[1:47:46] so he brings it in the way denominations
[1:47:49] did
[1:47:50] are you with me
[1:47:52] amen and of course that's with men that
[1:47:55] are not called of god
[1:48:00] on an ox collar
[1:48:04] and they reach out and try to
[1:48:06] in good
[1:48:07] faith
[1:48:08] study it
[1:48:11] and it brings spiritual death
[1:48:15] now i don't care how excited they get
[1:48:18] they danced on david's day
[1:48:21] i don't care how anointed they sing
[1:48:23] i don't care the whole congregation gets
[1:48:25] up and shouts and they get us emotional
[1:48:27] it'll cause spiritual death
[1:48:30] you will never get the word back into
[1:48:32] position any other way than the bible
[1:48:35] way of first chronicles 15 15 and the
[1:48:38] levites carried the ark of god with the
[1:48:41] poles on their shoulders as moses had
[1:48:43] commanded in accordance with the word of
[1:48:46] god
[1:48:47] brother branham said him trying to do
[1:48:49] god of service and levi's shoulders was
[1:48:51] god's original way to do it and they put
[1:48:54] it on a new ox cart or a new card it'll
[1:48:56] never work they didn't consult the right
[1:48:59] thing they got out about it went about
[1:49:00] it the wrong way and that's what
[1:49:02] happened when men no matter how sincere
[1:49:04] try to do a service outside of his
[1:49:07] provided way of revealing it they always
[1:49:09] mess up god sends it his way men
[1:49:12] no matter how sincere you try to do it
[1:49:15] outside of that you'll mess it up
[1:49:20] so don't be influenced
[1:49:23] by these new fang dangles and things
[1:49:25] they got today
[1:49:26] i don't care how good a man they are how
[1:49:29] sincere they are if they don't speak
[1:49:31] according to the law and the prophets
[1:49:33] the bible said there's no life in them
[1:49:36] so tonight now i'm just going to spend
[1:49:39] just a few more minutes on this we're
[1:49:41] moving on but to deny that preachers
[1:49:44] or god's ordained way to carry the word
[1:49:47] is to deny mark 16.
[1:49:51] for jesus said preach the word
[1:49:54] and when you preach it signs will follow
[1:49:58] even brother branham brought it down he
[1:50:00] said he didn't say teach the word
[1:50:02] he said preach the word and to preach
[1:50:05] the word is to demonstrate it
[1:50:09] to bring back evidence
[1:50:14] now
[1:50:15] preach the gospel the word
[1:50:17] and souls are saved you know why
[1:50:20] demons are cast out
[1:50:22] you don't get a soul saved without
[1:50:23] casting out devils
[1:50:25] preach the word to sick you're healed
[1:50:27] you know why
[1:50:29] amen demons are cast out
[1:50:31] amen and you have prayer lines for you
[1:50:33] lay hands on the sick
[1:50:35] and they shall recover
[1:50:42] and anyone
[1:50:44] who is taking medicine
[1:50:47] better be praying over it
[1:50:52] that when you take deadly things it
[1:50:53] won't hurt you
[1:50:58] are you with me
[1:51:00] so brother branham talks about this in
[1:51:02] the church age book he said paul said
[1:51:04] the word came in power as well as voice
[1:51:07] the word preached actually demonstrated
[1:51:10] itself
[1:51:11] like a flaming cut and sword it went
[1:51:13] into the consciousness of man like a
[1:51:15] surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases
[1:51:17] it set captives free and everywhere
[1:51:20] those early believers went they went
[1:51:22] preaching the gospel the word and god
[1:51:24] confirmed that word was signed following
[1:51:26] the sick were healed the devils were
[1:51:28] cast out they spoke in new tongues that
[1:51:30] was the word in action and the word has
[1:51:33] never failed in the mouth of believing
[1:51:36] christians
[1:51:37] and in this last age are you with me
[1:51:40] and this last age that is here
[1:51:43] stronger and greater than ever in the
[1:51:47] true word bride
[1:51:50] so a little flock you little minority
[1:51:52] hold on the word fill your mouth and
[1:51:54] heart with it and someday god will give
[1:51:56] you the kingdom
[1:51:58] the king will come
[1:52:02] now
[1:52:04] so they got across the river they saw
[1:52:06] the miraculous
[1:52:08] is what got them into there
[1:52:11] you don't cross dimensions
[1:52:14] from the wilderness
[1:52:16] and to the promised land of the holy
[1:52:18] ghost the holy ghost it is represent
[1:52:21] the promised land represents the holy
[1:52:23] ghost you don't do it without the
[1:52:25] supernatural
[1:52:28] only he can make the way through it
[1:52:32] come on
[1:52:34] and the first thing that happened when
[1:52:35] they crossed over jordan was the
[1:52:37] circumcision of the new generation
[1:52:41] and that day the reproach of egypt was
[1:52:44] rolled off of them
[1:52:46] and i tell you the reproach of
[1:52:48] denomination
[1:52:50] will never be rolled off of you
[1:52:53] until you are circumcised by the holy
[1:52:56] ghost and enter into covenant with god
[1:53:00] amen amen that's the only way to roll
[1:53:03] the approach away
[1:53:05] you see
[1:53:06] the reproach of denominational slave
[1:53:08] life
[1:53:10] slave mentality is to be circumcised
[1:53:14] by the holy ghost
[1:53:15] cut off
[1:53:17] amen i'm no longer a slave to fear
[1:53:21] i'm a child of god i'm no longer a slave
[1:53:24] to sickness
[1:53:26] i'm a child of god i'm no more a slave
[1:53:29] come on to habits and sin
[1:53:33] complexes
[1:53:34] i'm no longer a slave amen
[1:53:37] there there oh my in every church there
[1:53:40] ought to be a hill of foreskins
[1:53:43] right there pile after pile where the
[1:53:46] flesh is cut off come on church what sin
[1:53:50] is done away with and men and women have
[1:53:52] been filled with the holy ghost entered
[1:53:54] into covenant with god
[1:53:56] and i'll tell you if there's never been
[1:53:58] a time that that the new generation must
[1:54:01] have it like this generation
[1:54:06] many of you came out of egypt
[1:54:08] but you never were circumcised
[1:54:12] think of it
[1:54:14] we need a heel of foreskins
[1:54:17] but before trying to conquer jericho
[1:54:24] people want the seals broken to them
[1:54:25] before sin is broken off of them
[1:54:29] you got to deal with sin first
[1:54:32] and get the revelation of the holy ghost
[1:54:34] god's seal on your life first
[1:54:37] before you get the revelation of the
[1:54:38] seven seals you need the revelation of
[1:54:40] christ revealed personally to you
[1:54:43] you cannot possess the land without
[1:54:46] being in covenant with god amen
[1:54:50] so no matter how much you want to claim
[1:54:52] it you cannot possess it
[1:54:56] amen it's not yours unless you entered
[1:54:59] into covenant
[1:55:00] and the covenant the seal of the
[1:55:02] covenant is the baptism of the holy
[1:55:04] ghost which is our circumcision
[1:55:10] now
[1:55:13] so there again there's never been a time
[1:55:16] that the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:55:18] has been so important
[1:55:21] as this time
[1:55:23] remember when moses went down to deliver
[1:55:25] them and he hadn't circumcised his own
[1:55:27] son god like to kill him
[1:55:30] amen but the woman there realized his
[1:55:33] wife realized you know what was going on
[1:55:35] and circumcised the child and threw it
[1:55:37] at him and said here you're a bloody
[1:55:39] husband to me and and what happened the
[1:55:41] plague left
[1:55:43] and if we want the pledge to leave our
[1:55:45] young people
[1:55:47] some of you young people are 40 years
[1:55:49] old because you ain't never had an
[1:55:50] experience with god but if you want if
[1:55:53] you want the plug of the plague to leave
[1:55:56] you you're going to have to be
[1:55:57] circumcised because you're outside of
[1:56:00] the covenant
[1:56:02] and there's too many today around the
[1:56:04] message have never received the baptism
[1:56:07] of the holy ghost in his power
[1:56:10] they've never tasted the new land
[1:56:12] they don't know it's real
[1:56:16] they heard other people talk about it
[1:56:20] and they read about it in the bible and
[1:56:22] they hear about the prophet
[1:56:24] but they've never tasted it
[1:56:29] joshua
[1:56:31] is looking at them daunting walls of
[1:56:33] that
[1:56:34] city of jericho
[1:56:38] he's wondering how to open up those
[1:56:40] sealed walls
[1:56:42] now jericho
[1:56:44] is sealed
[1:56:46] closed up
[1:56:47] and is key to the entrance of the land
[1:56:53] we in order to take the land we got to
[1:56:56] first take jericho the seals have got to
[1:56:59] come off of it
[1:57:00] the walls has got to come down
[1:57:04] so it is key to the inheritance
[1:57:08] and you see the book
[1:57:10] the book is our land the possession come
[1:57:12] on somebody
[1:57:14] amen with people of the book what we've
[1:57:16] been preaching on for almost four years
[1:57:18] now
[1:57:19] we're the people of the book
[1:57:22] but notice here here again it was sealed
[1:57:25] with seven seals
[1:57:28] men had tried to probe into it look at
[1:57:30] it and guess at it and wonder about it
[1:57:33] and one thing you see it thinks it means
[1:57:36] this and another says it means that
[1:57:40] but it was all speaking in tongues
[1:57:44] without an interpreter
[1:57:46] just like in the days of daniel many
[1:57:48] many tickle your farce and we see it and
[1:57:50] it's symbolic but we don't know what the
[1:57:52] symbols mean and we had symbols in the
[1:57:55] book of revelation and we didn't know
[1:57:56] what they meant
[1:57:59] amen but they were key to opening up the
[1:58:01] rest of the book
[1:58:04] are you with me amen because these were
[1:58:07] things that were sealed up white horse
[1:58:09] rider black a red or black pail had went
[1:58:12] forth and sealing the book the
[1:58:14] antichrist moved to close up the
[1:58:16] contents of the land and so it's all
[1:58:18] walled up
[1:58:24] and joshua
[1:58:25] is standing on the outside
[1:58:28] looking at that city
[1:58:30] it's night
[1:58:32] and he's walking out among the people
[1:58:34] and he's thinking how am i going to
[1:58:35] break get in them walls
[1:58:39] you know
[1:58:40] maybe he has studied some of the books
[1:58:42] that moses had brought along
[1:58:45] on how to win
[1:58:46] campaigns how to be an egyptian general
[1:58:51] maybe he studied you know
[1:58:53] and he looks at some of them and he goes
[1:58:55] back and
[1:58:56] and he and he says
[1:58:59] i i i don't know what i'm going to do i
[1:59:01] don't know how to get into it there
[1:59:03] there's got to be a way to that that
[1:59:05] this book comes open that this land
[1:59:08] comes open that the walls come down
[1:59:11] we've got to get into the land
[1:59:13] amen we we're receiving the holy ghost
[1:59:16] but there's there's promises that are
[1:59:18] laying there that belong to us
[1:59:23] and if we don't get the seals open we're
[1:59:25] not we're not going to fully see and
[1:59:28] conquer the rest of the land
[1:59:30] we're just standing on the edge of it
[1:59:36] and he's out praying during the night
[1:59:40] and there he sees a man who has a sword
[1:59:43] drawn
[1:59:44] oh i'm glad he's got his sword drawn
[1:59:47] it's not in his sheath
[1:59:49] he's a mighty warrior and this is his
[1:59:52] battle
[1:59:53] and he comes out against him he said are
[1:59:55] you forced against us he said no i'm not
[1:59:57] not either one i have come as the
[2:00:00] captain of this army
[2:00:02] i am the leader and i'm going to tell
[2:00:05] you how to get into that wall you can
[2:00:08] throw away your books of the egyptians
[2:00:10] all your past theology
[2:00:13] amen as brother breton said i hope
[2:00:15] people are spiritual i would have made a
[2:00:17] horrible mistake if it hadn't been about
[2:00:19] 12 o'clock today when the holy spirit
[2:00:22] came in the room and corrected me on
[2:00:23] something i was writing down to say
[2:00:27] i was taken from an old context and i
[2:00:29] had nothing on it
[2:00:31] i didn't know this what i don't know
[2:00:33] what the second seal is no more than
[2:00:35] nothing
[2:00:36] it's about i had some old context of
[2:00:38] things i something i spoke on several
[2:00:40] years ago and wrote it down and i
[2:00:42] gathered the context and dr smith and
[2:00:45] many great
[2:00:47] outstanding can i in in
[2:00:50] interject the word and the egyptian
[2:00:52] teacher and i i'd gathered and uh and
[2:00:55] all them and what they believed that and
[2:00:57] i wrote it down i was speaking to say
[2:00:59] i'll study from that standpoint and
[2:01:02] there about 12 o'clock in the day the
[2:01:05] holy spirit just swept down into the
[2:01:08] room and the whole thing just opened up
[2:01:10] to me and there it was of this first
[2:01:13] seal being opened
[2:01:16] hallelujah what was it he was getting
[2:01:18] instructions now
[2:01:20] on how to to bring down the walls
[2:01:25] amen and he's told what to do
[2:01:27] as the captain said this is my battle
[2:01:31] it's the lamb's rights to open the
[2:01:34] seals and i'm taking charge
[2:01:38] this won't be william branham taking the
[2:01:40] seals off the book
[2:01:41] this won't come by his understanding
[2:01:44] this is not man's theology
[2:01:47] come on this is not a seventh grade
[2:01:50] kentuckian and his ideas
[2:01:52] amen this is not are you with me this is
[2:01:55] this is not something that is his
[2:01:58] intellectual property
[2:02:02] hallelujah
[2:02:03] it's not his intellectual property it's
[2:02:06] not his children's to inherit
[2:02:10] come on it's not their message it's
[2:02:13] god's message
[2:02:15] it don't belong to the branhams come on
[2:02:18] it don't belong to jeffersonville amen
[2:02:21] it belongs it comes from the hand of the
[2:02:25] chief captain
[2:02:28] it's his message and he said this is my
[2:02:30] battle i am the lamb and i am opening
[2:02:35] the seals and i am taking charge
[2:02:40] hallelujah you'll get a revelation today
[2:02:43] of who's in charge of this pride it
[2:02:45] ain't some man-made system it's the lord
[2:02:49] jesus christ
[2:02:50] amen the king of kings and the lord of
[2:02:58] lords hallelujah

[2:03:16] you to march around at seven days in
[2:03:18] silence

[2:03:25] you know
[2:03:26] every day didn't know what to say about
[2:03:28] it didn't know how to open it
[2:03:30] amen didn't know the mystery
[2:03:32] we were we just had to remain silent
[2:03:35] amen when mighty what this one whispered
[2:03:38] this and that one whispered that john
[2:03:40] what was it um matthew henry wrote this
[2:03:43] and scofield wrote that but nobody knew
[2:03:45] what they were talking about
[2:03:49] marching around
[2:03:50] longing to get in
[2:03:52] but still sealed
[2:03:54] out but in the seventh church age
[2:03:58] on the seventh day
[2:04:00] on the last day of the march
[2:04:02] the last day of the journey i want you
[2:04:05] to march around it seven times
[2:04:07] as a memorial so we did the first day

[2:04:17] day sardis sixth day fellow philadelphia
[2:04:20] seventh day laodicea amen and then we
[2:04:23] then we learned as we went around in the
[2:04:26] memorial seven times in the last age
[2:04:30] amen that the messenger of ephesus was
[2:04:33] paul
[2:04:34] and then there was irenaeus and martin
[2:04:36] and columba and luther and wesley
[2:04:41] hallelujah and prison on the scene was

[2:04:52] about it as we as we went around
[2:04:55] observing the walls now
[2:04:57] amen but there now as we come to that
[2:05:00] seventh round in laodicea where the
[2:05:03] restorations of what the fathers had
[2:05:05] were to be had the silence was broken
[2:05:08] [Music]
[2:05:10] with a shout
[2:05:12] out
[2:05:13] amen with the sound and the wiles came
[2:05:15] down
[2:05:17] come on church what was it it was the
[2:05:19] shot of the king
[2:05:21] what was it the lord had descended from
[2:05:23] heaven with a shout with the message the
[2:05:27] word had come
[2:05:29] remember with that shout with that
[2:05:31] message the walls fell down
[2:05:34] [Applause]
[2:05:36] hallelujah say brother tim they're not
[2:05:38] all down cursed is he that tries to
[2:05:41] raise up jericho again
[2:05:47] amount
[2:05:51] then the seal walls are broken
[2:05:54] and they were commissioned to possess
[2:05:56] the land
[2:05:58] and drive out the inhabitants
[2:06:00] see we're still in joshua
[2:06:03] within those walls and the breaking of
[2:06:05] those seals
[2:06:06] there was a woman
[2:06:08] by the name of rahab
[2:06:11] who had to be redeemed
[2:06:15] there was a people come on
[2:06:18] amen right in the middle of the opening
[2:06:19] of the seals that were going to be
[2:06:21] redeemed
[2:06:23] two spies that went over the city and
[2:06:24] got this gentile woman under the token
[2:06:28] hallelujah under the token of the
[2:06:30] scarlet robe and this woman was redeemed
[2:06:33] as the seals was broken
[2:06:36] hallelujah and she had been a harlot
[2:06:41] hallelujah

[2:13:45] you see what nothing put on about caleb
[2:13:48] he was for real
[2:13:51] and he already had seen the land in his
[2:13:54] heart before he laid eyes on it
[2:13:57] so he didn't see himself as a
[2:13:59] grasshopper he saw himself as more than
[2:14:02] a conqueror
[2:14:04] hallelujah he didn't see the giants
[2:14:09] they were like grasshoppers in his sight
