because you've done great things we ask Lord you just come Lord this evening and speak to our hearts Lift us up I pray see the battle that we've been in Lord this week and we just asked the Lord that you would come and just bring a refresh into our spirit as the Lord and to our lives we pray Commit This Time To Your Hands For Your Glory in Jesus name his name let's turn to John chapter 1. number six and says here in John chapter 1 verse 6 says there was a man sent from God whose name was John and the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light That lightest every man that cometh into the world read that last bit again that last verse that was the True Light which lighteth every man they cometh into the world amen we let you be seated like to speak to you this evening on reflecting the light amen reflecting his or reflection is the act of reflecting as in casting back a light or a heat or mirroring mirroring something giving back or showing an image and so when you are looking at a reflection You're Expecting like if you're looking into a mirror you're expecting that what is in what is looking at the mirror is reflected exactly back and what is what is being there before it and so you don't expect something different you don't expect um you know to be a different person or a different or you know if it's a man you don't expect it to be a woman standing there or whatever or if it's a dog you don't expect it to be a cat standing there you're expected to be a perfect reflection of what is sending the image and you know I believe I know that we're here in this time that we're living in we are reflecting something we see the world that is reflecting darkness and as kind of a paradox but they're reflecting Darkness to the point to where their lives are actually living or becoming what another realm is actually actually is and brother Bradham talked about that he says he said in in this realm he said here lives mortal beings each one is in this great conglomeration of gaiety of Blackness and darkness Mortals live in here now they're either influenced from this way or from that way from this way or from that way amen you cannot be a spiritual be in sinner or Saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the above world if your influenced from here then you're from above your Celestial body is waiting for you but if you're Wicked and hypocritical and indifferent your Celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think it is up here amen because the fruit that you bear before people proves where you're from so you're here what you are somewhere else you are here what you are somewhere else your life that you live here is just reflecting what your inheritance is when you leave here and so we are to be a reflection and we are reflecting something amen we know I believe that all of us are part of the body of Jesus Christ I I speak that in faith even though I know we're speaking to three kinds of Believers I still want to speak that that we're all part of the body of Jesus Christ maybe you're not quite reflecting that as of yet but I believe one day very soon you will be amen each one is different and therefore we have different things we bring to the body and not all of us are a reflection of his head or of his feet or of his of his hands but each part of us brings forth a part of the body it's a reflection of his body now some of the body of Christ in this service you know brother Brown says like this he said might like to sit real quiet you don't say much another one likes to be real happy another one does this or that but as long as we're saved by the blood of God born again Sons and Daughters of God we are a reflection of that body we are a reflection of that light amen he says look at this great body of Christ up here above the Earth shining down it is shining into another great body amen another great body that's on the earth and that body is a literal resurrected body of our Lord Jesus Christ that is there but it's now shining into his body spiritually speaking here upon this Earth amen shining he says now his body literally had eyes it had noses or had a nose it had ears it had a heart his body amen that literally was raised up from the grave is putting forth with each function of a spiritual body a spiritual body will also have eyes it also have noses nose it also have ears that also have a heart amen it'll also be a perfect reflection of what he was two thousand years ago amen I believe that that body is here again upon this Earth I believe there's a bride body of the Lord Jesus Christ that is upon this earth that is a reflection of what he was two thousand years ago amen it should be born of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life power of his power what is it the same life that he get had she is reflecting back to him the same power that he puts out is the same power she's reflecting back to him amen the same Bones the same flesh everything has been reflected back to him and his power is on the Earth again and when his hands move there his hand moves here when his foot moves there his foot moves here amen we are a reflection of what he is he says when if we see the church come up shouting and rejoice him and then some sit and quiet and some crying and some doing this remember that's only the reaction of the real body come on now that's only the reaction of the real body the resurrected body of Jesus that's throwing the influence to that part of the body that's on the earth now so there's some that gets excited there's some that shouts there's some to Rejoice there's some that cries there's some that that's some that sits there quietly and absorbs it in what is it is a reflection of that body there hallelujah amen he said we believe that that body was Christ and Christ is the body and this is a reflection of that body then if the body here on Earth this Earthly body we have now it begins to say well the days of Miracles are passed then that part of Christ is dead come on now that part of Christ is dead it isn't living it doesn't reflect no more of his power then this part of the body of Christ isn't living for if it's living it's moving it's making every reflection of its moving to the church on Earth so if he still has the power to heal then this body is reflecting that power to heal if he still has the power to save then this body is reflecting that power that it was in that body to say because it is all a perfect reflection of his body he said now that everything on Earth is a reflection of what's going on somewhere else so if you see the world getting bad well how do you think hell is it this evening amen things are getting worse and worse and hell is opening up his mouth and and you know and you say well the devil's turning loose on us well you know one thing that gives me great courage and I've leaned on many times in the thought of the devil turning loose he said when all hell turns loose all Heaven's going to turn loose with it so if all hell has been against you and and we can see hell being reflected here upon Earth then we can also say that heaven has turned loose and Heaven is reflecting his power in a body Heaven is reflecting his power in your life and in my life what is happening somewhere else is happening right here we are reflection amen what is going on he said so because if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting for us amen just what you're somewhere else is what you are here come on now amen well if you're a hypocrite here you're a hypocrite somewhere else amen if you're a sinner here you're a sinner somewhere else but if you're saved bought child of the Living God Amen that's what you are somewhere else amen you you're if you and your life isn't just correct here then your spiritual body in another place is not correct yet amen if you got all your members submissive to God then you are reflecting somewhere else he says you know when you was a boy you wanted to wait long enough you couldn't hardly wait till you could put on Long trousers 21 years old Be Your Own Boss you wanted to get married you want to pay for your home and then to have children to raise and now you're getting old and gray still you're not satisfied he said see it's your reflection this is a negative but there is a positive just on the other side Hallelujah so if there's a place in your heart Desiring to be perfect there's a bound to be a Perfection somewhere you can reach Hallelujah if there's a desire in your heart to be saved then there's a Salvation you can receive if there's a desire in your heart to be healed then there's a healing you can't obtain hallelujah amen yes David said when the Deep call us to the Deep there's a deep to respond before there could be a deep to call there had to be a deep Fort to call from amen so what is it what if what is causing us to react the way we are it's our Heavenly home it's a pull from another dementia it's a light that is shining down upon us amen and we're reflecting that sign he said when the Sun is up let me go back and back up a little bit he says if this desire is so to be perfect where you'll never get old where you never get gray-headed where you'll always be young where you're always be at your best where you'll never be sick where you'll never have sorrow where you'll never have fear well if you so desire that it has to be somewhere or you couldn't have a desire for it everything is a reflection that song sings there is a land I'm homesick for though I've never seen it before amen oh Hallelujah see when the Sun is up now it's bright and shiny Lord knows it's bright and shiny today the sun will go down this evening but there will be a moon that will reflect the light now this Moon does not have its own light but it has it's a reflection of a light amen now it's not the moon it's not even Moon we call it look at the Moonlight it's not Moonlight it's actually sunlight on the moon amen amen but it's the moon reflection of the light that is shining from another round it's the sun shining to the moon and then it's reflecting to the Earth in other words the Moon is the bride the sun is the Son of God and while the sun is gone the Moon is reflecting of his light it is reflecting to a dark World the light of a living God it is reflecting to the dark world that Jesus still saves he still heals he still delivers just as he did in the sun his soul still does still to yet today he's still the same yesterday today and forever and he put a testimony up there it's actually when you see it at night it is a reflection of you God put you in the skies before you ever came my God you look at it just a moon and sometimes it's so it's very beautiful and very bold and then there's little slivers but it's all the same Moon and it's reflecting the same light it never gives light of its own it never has the ability to manufacture anything on its own it can only do as it is shined upon hallelujah amen just as you you cannot manufacture this Christian Life on your own you can't live the Christian Life on your own you have no ability on your own you're nothing but rotten speaking human flesh but one day the Son of God rose up in your life and it began to shine upon you and you're now as he is shining upon you and he illuminated every fiber of your body it is shining now to a dark Dying World and scream it out Jesus still saves Jesus still heals he still delivers he still sets free Hallelujah no much no matter how much the devil wants to say and he wants to braise up cancer in our face There's a Moon that's shining right over there and we can constantly point to that Moon and say devil my God still heals cancer that moon is shining amen shining out of light amen no matter how much the devil wants to say that your sons are too far gone and there's no hope for them and it's impossible for God to read There's a Moon that's shining right over there and we can point to it and show the Dark World God still saves it doesn't matter how far they're called it doesn't matter how far it's been and how long they've been out of the house of God there's a moon up [Applause] and there's a light that is shining reflecting it out to a dark world the moon sometimes is so pretty and bright but what does make it sometimes when the moon isn't pretty and bright there's a lot of storm clouds over it but that doesn't mean there ain't still light there amen there's a lot of you that's been through a lot of storms been a lot of clouds over you a lot of a lot of Darkness around you but that doesn't mean the sun is still not reflecting through you amen amen you know sometimes you go through things as Christians amen it ain't always sunshine and roses and and then pretty flowers and beautiful mountaintops no you go through some Dark Places sometimes but just because you're in a dark place does not mean the sun is still not shining upon you it just does not does not mean that the sun is not still illuminate in your life and orchestrating your life and moving upon you just because the clouds there does not mean the sun is still not in power just because a cloud of awareness or our cloud of dreariness or our cloud of frustration whatever it is has been sitting upon you that does not mean the sun is not still shining upon you but there's still light upon you because the sun is still up and the devil can do all he wants to but he can't put it out amen you know if there was no light Sun Moon nothing at all Sun wasn't shining somewhere why the darkness would be so dark so you couldn't even see your hand before your face you know I've been in those places down in the cavern and it's not a cool place I don't like that where you move your hand you can't even see it you can't even see a you can feel a little something but you can't even see it just a minute movement there's nothing there it's a dark place to be it been and sometimes you can get in those kind of places and it seems so dark it seems so lonely and it seems like nobody cares but the sun is still Shining there is but there is a sun there is the clouds will move back again and you'll see a little reflection of a moon somewhere and what what that's when the trouble is going on in the church and things storm clouds and contentions and indifference in the churches than the storm clouds it's hard to get through it's hard to press through but the sun is still Shining it's still moving amen the moon doesn't quit existing Hallelujah the moon doesn't quit existing the sun doesn't quit existing it's still there and someday when Jesus comes the church WIll coincide and coordinate because it's the same power of God coming out of the out of Christ and to the church and it's all coordinating together at that day you'll know I'm in the father and the father and me and I and you but in the beginning God provided a moon to give a lesser light another another place he said the moon and the sun are perfectly husband and wife when the Sun goes down it goes beyond Way Beyond the world and you can't see it's glimmer no more and there's nothing but Darkness up comes the Moon it reflects the light to the moon and the moon gives a lesser light by night just as Jesus when he was here on the earth he went away he went back up into the heavens but it reflects back the holy ghost in the church amen which is the light in his place today come on now which is the light in his place today remember the moon didn't give light at all to herself the moon doesn't that's still the sunlight that's the way it is today it's not the church it's the Holy Ghost on the church hallelujah it's just as the Morning Star he said I'd go out tonight and would say upgrade Morning Star will be shining the skies a little before day in the morning it's a great morning story what makes you shine what makes all your stars shine well if you could speak back to me so brother Branham it's not me shining it's the sun shining on me that's What Makes Me Shine somebody said to me not long ago don't you think those people that holler amen and shout hallelujah all like that in a meeting don't you think they're just getting a little excited I said no they're Shining that's right it's not me that's shining it's not you that's China it's God shining on us and the Holy Spirit given the new birth and as a Morning Star is reflecting the light of the absent Christ by his power and demonstration the church sends forth the light in this dark time sometimes daylight will come and the sun over someday soon daylight will come and the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings this Mortal will take on immortality and we'll see him as he is made like his own glorious body there will never be no more sick there will never be no harm or heartache there'll never be no more disappointments [Music] but the son of righteousness will be the light amen but even there will still reflect his light say God is like a big great great big diamond that diamond has been cut in such a way in a true cut diamond it reflects many rays of light and when we see the church with so many different gifts of the Spirit and it's only the Reflection off the real diamond one may seem like a little peculiar to the other but there's the way the diamond reflects the light amen we don't all have to be the same kind of light but we have to reflect the same light amen a true cut diamond reflects many rays of light that's why you've been here brother brother Aaron different ones priests brother Tim amen we're not trying to say everybody's got to be the certain ray of light that shouts all the time or Dances all the time but if that's the ray that you are and you're quenching that amen well that's not just who I am is it or is it not you need to allow God to be free on however he wants to use you that's the point be free on how God wants to reflect through you because there's many different lights but it's all one light have many different colors have many different looks it'd be pretty boring if we all walked in front of a mirror and we all looked the same that'd be pretty weird a lot weirder than than anything else I can think of that'd be really weird all of us men we walked before the a mirror here and we all looked exactly the same all of us and all the ladies here walk before a mirror and you'll all look exactly the same that ain't the way a diet that's not what the way this diamond created you he wanted short people he wanted tall people he wanted in between people we're going to stay off the weight he wanted all kinds he didn't want us to all be just like one little robot walking around saying the same thing doing the same things making the same motions all at the same time say Amen all at the same time do this no that's not what he wanted he wanted many different lights [Applause] he wanted a bouquet of flowers God does it that way he reflects a gift to the in the church one is and as he said in the Bible one has a gift of knowledge other has a gift of tongues one has the gift of something else it's God reflecting these lights so you know how you know how you keep that from happening you cover it up or you take it out I know God wants all of his lights to shine amen he wants it all because it's a reflection of himself it's God reflecting these lights and they are the lights that's gathered in one person almighty God you know one night he said he was holding a meeting in Milltown Baptist Church he said I was a pastor down there for some time and I was coming home with old friend of mine stayed all night and I noticed when I'd come by a certain place and the cedar Bush and was his Nightingale all night long he would sing to the top of his voice just as loud as he could sing how well I could understand why the birds sing when it's daylight but this this bird was singing to the lie as top of his voice his voice as loud as he could get at night as I can imagine the sunlight like bathing on birds in the daylight and that Sun Ray warming them from a cold night or or a wet you know stormy night and it makes them sing but what makes a bird sing at night he said so I got me a book and I began to read up on the old Nightingale and I come to find out that the Nightingale what makes him sing is he watches the skies and every time he can look and see the clouds begin to move back and see one star one ray of light he begins to scream and sing to the top of his voice because he knows the sun is shining somewhere and he's speaking back to the Earth that the sun is shining somewhere isn't that amazing that God would create a bird to testify in the darkness amen when it's dark all around and he's looking at the skies and he sees one little glimmer of life and he starts singing to the top of his voice and he's letting you know God's still God the sun's still shining it might be on the other side of the Earth right now but it's still Shining oh Hallelujah I wonder how many Nightingales we have in this building tonight that maybe it's been Darkness a star and you just want to shout and say the Sun is up Hallelujah that Sun is up and God is moving among his children brothers and sisters long it's down in my heart through the black clouds of torment and trials and troubles if I can feel the Holy Spirit press through once in a while and give me a blessing I know the power of God still lives and Reigns somewhere Hallelujah [Music] he said if I could ask that Morning Star what makes you shine why are you shine this is not me shining brother Branham that star could speak it's only the sun shining on me that makes me shine that's the way it is with every man that's a believer in Jesus Christ that's hidden him it's not you shining it's the Holy Spirit shining on you and that gives you this hope and this joy of the Resurrection he tells another place he said I walked out and I looked at that great morning star as she began to move you under what does the Morning Star saying is reflecting the Supreme light of the sun coming the reason it's so bright you know why it is the sun is so much closer to it it's pressing through and The Morning Star hails the coming of the sun all right you morning Stars did you catch that all right you morning Stars why is he calling you morning stars because you're living closer to the Sun than anybody else come on now your orbit has been moved to a place that you're closer to the Sun than anybody else therefore is silent with Much Greater Life your morning's tires it's time to go to hailing his coming it's time to go say Jesus is Among Us shine morning Stars it says the sun will soon be here when we look and see that morning star glistening in the skies it means the sun will shine pretty soon and when we see the morning stars of God rising and Shining to the glory of the resurrected Jesus Christ it shows that the Supreme one is pressing through the darkness and the light is gathering but the morning Stars hauling hold on it isn't long till daylight hold on it isn't long till it's over just keep holding on Hallelujah let me put my voice for that morning star hold on the sun is coming amen is coming in his train he's going to come with such power it's going to rewrite history for mankind and it's going to turn mortality into immortality it is one to wipe all Strife away and all backbiting away and all power problems away oh come on somebody the sun is coming [Applause] pushing through the darkness he said just so that sister used to say just keep holding on daylight soon coming Hold on Till day hold on hold on maybe some of you about ready to drop off hold on hold on the morning stars are shining to the world lightening up the world just before the great darkness and that great ThunderBolt from Heaven is the coming of the Lord hold on but Timothy it's hard yeah it is hold on brother Timothy it's dark yup it is hold on brother Tim of this seems to be more Wars than ever yeah wars and rumors of wars hold on more Sodom and Gomorrah you know as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the sun hold on he said I I remember a little spring I used to drink from even in that spring I could see God I'd go down there and it was the happiest spring I ever seen every year I'd go up there and there was a bubble bubble this and bubble bubble bubble just as hard as it could bubble and I looked at it one day and I said why don't you ever get tired why why are you always happy what's a bubbling about so maybe you're happier because a deer drinks from you know if you can answer no maybe you could you're happy because the Bears or maybe you're happy because I drink from you nope what are you happy about if he could speak and say brother Branham it ain't me bubbling it's something behind me pushing me that's making me Bubble that's what I think about an old-time Holy Ghost meeting it's not the people excited it's the holy ghost coming into them and making them excited hello somebody bubbling them up and giving them power giving them Joy it's the Holy Ghost that's doing the bubbling amen we have an old-fashioned meeting where testimonies are and the powers of God Among Us isn't it it isn't the people that's shining it's the holy ghost from Heaven shine upon the people and it's causing them to Bubble Up that's the way it is for every man that's born of the spirit of God there's Living Water springing up in him not dead Waters not calm Waters Living Waters it's not him bubbling it it's the Holy Ghost behind them making him bubble making him believe leading him to higher Heights to deeper depths and experiences with the Lord Jesus Christ that's what we need today is a gusher take the Caps off and let the water flow well I believe if that's the way it is amen the prophet would believe it that way how come we can't believe the same way let's take the Caps off of our services come on now let's take the Caps over how awful how we expect God's going to move how God's going to do this and how God's going to do that you take your Camp Off amen and let the gusher of the Holy Ghost begin to pour down and let it begin to move and let it begin to touch and let it begin to shine upon somebody and let it then begin to reflect something that's going on he said you notice in the morning he said I watched it many times I see the Dew fall at night look out here and see the dewfall every time when the sun comes up did you notice how happy the little Dew Drop was maybe some of you I can get up early enough I get up early enough to see Dew drops come on somebody hey man how many gets up early enough to see Dew drops how many knows what a dew drop is it's not a drink that's a Sun Drop I think talking about a dew drop it's on a blade of grass a little bit of tinkle of a water just twinkling a little bit fell out of the heavens landed down there on some grass way down deep sometimes it gets trumped on sometimes it gets stepped on sometimes it gets mowed under but it's still there and there's still wanting something and this little Dew Drop is laying there waiting for something and he said if you watch it when the sun comes up how happy a little Dew Drop can get can you imagine when the Holy Ghost comes into our church service how happy a Son of God can get amen he begins to Sparkle and he begins to shine and he begins to Sparkle and he begins to shine he said I was asking one one morning talking to Nature apparently he did that a lot talking to Nature he said I asked and said what makes you Sparkle a little dewdrop and it seemed like something in that way spoke back to me and said you know last night I was up there and now this morning the sun is Rose and I know I'm about to go back to where I came from Hallelujah and I'm about to leave this old hot ass and all the problems and all the struggle and that's why I'm happy because the sun is shining on me and the sun is shining and it's pulling me into another Realm oh Hallelujah that's exactly what happens to a child of God when the son of righteousness arises in one of our services and the light of God comes in our midst and begins to shine on somebody it's beginning to Shimmer a little bit get a little happy a little bit maybe tears flow off their face their hands come up what is it they know they came from up there and they may they're going back to their place and there's a God a light that is shining upon them to draw them into Heavenly places he said that thing that little dewdrop says I once was up there and I'm happy because the sun is shining on me and when the Sun Shines on me it's drawing me right back to where I was and he said that's exactly right dewdrop the reason you can do that shine and Sparkle is because you've got an experience you got an experience you was up there once he said I think a lot about that a man that's ever been born again took out of the life out of this life into the realm of the blessings and the glory one of these days the son of righteousness will shine across the Earth and those with that kind of experience we'll be caught up to meet him in the air up there where they have have been in the Realms of glory and lost themselves many times before he said all that's around them they don't care who's around it they once they've been up there and when they get in that kind of condition with the anointing of the spirit Fallen the master Spirit Jesus Christ will come day one day again and claim you out of here into Glory do you understand what he's saying there actually in a service you being drawn up into Heavenly places and leaving your thoughts of tomorrow and leaving those that are around you and leaving and getting so lost to you don't even care no more it's a reflection that one day he's going to come and he's going to not just pull you into a realm and you go up and you and you come into that place and you have to walk back in this old world again and you come up and you come back down but one day this this is a reflection how you are reacting when he comes is a reflection of how you will react when he comes it's reflecting the light now you heard me before I didn't say you all had to be dancing I didn't say your halter had to be but you had to be receiving him when he came and acknowledging him when he comes it is reflection of that day when the change is sweeping over bodies and you don't react because you didn't change it blew my mind when I was thinking about this today God says another place he says did you ever go out on a morning after a dark dismal night look hanging on the clothes wire look hanging on the glass grass blades hanging on a leaf a little dewdrop so miserable looking quivering Chilly Winds shaking them but just let the sun start to rise watch how they shine they glisten you know they were once in the sky and the going away of the sun brought them down but they had been up there they had an experience they are a witness that there's an atmosphere to live above this Earth and as soon as the sun is the one that draws the duvet into the sky again and once they've been up now they're down but they see the sunrise and they know they're going back up again Hallelujah what nature can teach us how God would put it in his in his write it in the Bible of nature and reflect us as humans many times we pass right by it and don't even see that's a reflection of me that bird singing is a reflection of me that Dew drops of reflection of me those stars are a reflection of me amen that was his first Bible he wrote Us in the heavens amen you know okay Lord let's read about it Psalms 8 and verse 1 oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name and all the Earth who has set thy Glory above the heavens out of the mouth of babes and succulents have thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou might have steal the enemy and the Avenger and when I consider thy heavens and the works of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou Hast ordained which thou Hast ordained in the next verse what is man that thou art mindful of him I got to looking at this word ordained those stars in other words are fixed they are determined they are directed by God and can never be put out they are established amen they are prepared for and provided for and furnished amen they are arranged in order amen they are established there they're fiction of certain place they cannot be moved and this is what he's saying what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visit for thou has made him a little lower the Angels crowning with Glory and Honor that's made him to have dominion over the work of thy hands thou has put all things under his feet he points to the stars and says what is man [Music] many people want to be a star and they aspire to be Stars what the world calls Stars that's exactly how the devil does he copyrights God or it copies God copycats that's the word he copycats God you go down there now to Life Tabernacle what used to be live Tabernacle used to be Grand Avenue I believe or the road that went there in front of it is now Elvis Presley Boulevard crosshairs two statues oh I can't remember the other guy right off hand but there's one to Elvis Presley huh yeah Hank Williams somebody like that yeah James Burton is one of them and right there on the same street they call it you can actually read it they're only call it the Cradle of the Stars ain't that amazing you're reading Revelations how he held them in his hand what is a hand it's a cradle it's holding them and as these brother Brown talked about these seven lights that are in the hands of God he said they're not Delight they don't have lights of their own they're reflecting the light but they're held in the cradle and here's Satan comes along right at the place where the prophet of God would come and stand and God would come down the pillar of fire would come down and discern the hearts Satan says you know what I got my stars too and I'm going to rename the road and I'm gonna put up my statues and I I'm gonna do this and I'm going to do that and I'm going to call it the cradles of the Stars right there at the same place Elvis Presley got a start they called it uh what was it called hayride Louisiana hayride was one of the biggest radio stations of that time actually one day me and sister Ruth went to stay in the bed and breakfast up there up there in Bossier and we're sitting there and there was another couple that was there and they was talking to the man that was over the bed and breakfast and he was telling them about the the Municipal Auditorium he talks about hey you know that's where Elvis came and he goes in there he said that's where the Saiyan Elvis has left the building started that's where he got his started he's all excited about it and right here at the same place two stars show up one in the Cradle of God one in the Cradle of the devil reflecting something one reflecting the power of God to heal deliver set free one reflecting the very and reflecting out of his mouth the very word of God that would be revealed in this day and the other reflecting hell Satan copycatton he's got his own reflections movie stars today they're star ball Stars but there is one true star amen let's read about it right here Amen in Job chapter 38 and verse 1 then the Lord answered job out of a whirlwind you know oh job he was in a bad Strait right about this moment he had been you know he'd been through a lot of things I don't know if you've heard about Joe's job's life but he he went to a few difficult days yeah it really probably worse than all of us put together what we ever been through in our life and here here he is and then you know he gets these three comforters to come they come to comfort him I was listening to him here while listening to him talk a while back and they were constantly needling him and asking him well surely it's because you did this and you and job would answer no I've offered the sacrifice no I've done this and I that's not the reason and he and but then Elias comes and he begins to speak to him and then finally the Lord Begins the world around job out of a whirlwind said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge gird up now thou loins like a man for I will demand of thee
