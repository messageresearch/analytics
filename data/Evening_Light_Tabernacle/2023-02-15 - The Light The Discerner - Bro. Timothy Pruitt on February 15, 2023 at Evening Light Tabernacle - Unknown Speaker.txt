Among Us father we brought our little licks of fire lord just to bundle them together Lord and come together on a Wednesday night away from the pressures of this world and situations that's around us Lord and allow you to speak to our hearts or do you know the things that are on my heart tonight Lord and I just ask that you would give me the ability to speak it Lord and let your word just go forth and touch hearts and lives God that you would come and do your work is only you can do Lord not man's work not my not what I would want but what you would want we commit ourselves to you and surrender to you Lord we so thankful Lord to serve a living God we asked now to touch each heart we ask it in Jesus name foreign to Hebrews chapter 4. also First Corinthians 11. verse 23. amen we had a just a wonderful time just a way a few weeks ago and uh kind of interesting you know sometimes you think you got your plans made and the way things are going to happen and it don't always happen the way you expect and um so I was looking at tickets and things to try to fly to Brother Kelly's and for his winter convention and and it wasn't possible to get there on the day that I needed to get there and to go a day earlier was about it was ridiculous the amount the cost of it and so he actually suggested me to go to Vancouver and overnight and doing so it saved quite a bit of money and and so then I was there in Vancouver with the Believers there on Wednesday night and spoke on a little thought that I just had spoke here on the fire and and the fire of God fell and it touched you know several Hearts but there was one there young girl that had had just been through a lot in her life and she came down and she gave her heart to the Lord and the fire of God lit her up and she's went back a week later on her way back through and she just still all smiles and rejoicing for what God has done or life amen God knows how to direct your path amen and brother brother Tom got up behind what I'd said and he says you know you drop a match you'll burn a forest and I believe that's what we want to do every service just drop a match let the force burn and let God come that down and touch hearts and lives and had a wonderful time as well Brother Kelly's bring back greetings from for the Tom and brother Kelly there and all the churches the different folks in in each church and so many that can't name all the names that want to send back personal greetings but we just thank the Lord that we have family all over the world Amen we're thankful for that amen Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12 it says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit of the joints and the morrow and is the and it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart sounds like a surgeon amen go right down into the soul and divide it right across from the soul and the spirit and the joints and Morrow and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto him under the eyes of him with whom we have to do also First Corinthians 11 and verse 23 now we read the scripture for the communion but I just want to read it here tonight it says if I received the Lord that which I've delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night at which he was betrayed took bread and when he gave thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is a new testament in my blood this do you as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthodly eateth and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this calls many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another amen we'll let you be seated tonight uh I've had this thought on me for some time and just just looking into it I want to speak to you tonight on the light the discerner amen I believe he is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and he knows where our problems are and our problem spots are and he he you know we go to a doctor and we get a CAT scan and we get an MRI and sometimes it can pinpoint something and sometimes he can't even find the issue but this light can show exactly where it's at and he knows exactly how to go to where it's at and he knows exactly how to describe how to how to anoint a certain service and a certain man to come amen maybe thousands of miles away or just a few miles away and anoint them to go down a certain Avenue amen it's the light is the zerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and you know I I was just looking at this as we as we see that this this word is a powerful word that we have in this hour it's not a word of limitations it's not a word that can only handle certain certain situations and only do certain things but it's a word of unlimited resources and so therefore it has unlimited resources it has unlimited power now the doctor he has limited resources on how he can treat something in your life and he can only go so far but thank God he has never run out of of treatments God has never run out of his ability to heal and deliver and and to set free and and to break complexes off of Our Lives he knows exactly where every troubled spot is in our life and we know the word of God is strong is sharp it's very it's like a a scaffold that a surgeon would use him and a secured surgeon can go in and he can divide the muscle and the tissue and go and find that spot in your right maybe it's against the bone or maybe it's down hidden in some around your intestine somewhere but he knows exactly how to go in there but this God knows exactly how to how to bring a thought to a to a man and and lay it upon his heart and bring it to a certain spot so he can come to that moment where you need him at but see it's not just him coming to to that place and begin to discern your hearts but you also must recognize that's God doing that because if you look at it and say well that's just brother Timothy or that's just brother so and so or brother brother Tim told him what I was doing or this that and the other and you can very easily take that light and make it a very dim thing and and make it where it isn't very it isn't able to come and touch your heart it becomes a very carnal thing amen because of carnal interpretations and carnal ideas but you know if we'll look at it for what it is and we can truly see that is the light of God that God would come and he would anoint a man through the foolishness of preaching and he would he would anoint him to a certain thought into a certain thing and to a certain road to go down why because God knows where your trouble is God knows if his blindness God knows of his complexes God knows of his situations your life that you can't handle he knows exactly how to get to where you're at you know I I was I was even thinking on these things as I was away and you know know it's Friday night at that meeting their Brother Kelly's uh on Friday I was just Disturbed and didn't know what to preach on and was looking and looking and looking and finally hit this one one vein and just like the room lit up as I would as I would begin to look at this thought I'd spoke on who on who touched me and I and I brought it to the church that evening and and I began to speak and I and it wasn't very long I realized where I was at that I was in the mind of God and I knew that I was going down certain trails in certain Avenues and I I began to talk about the woman who touched the Hem of His Garment and how she was separated and out there away from the family of God but he had not only restored her body but he restored her to her position and you know and I was going down that line unbeknownst to me amen a visitor there and I'm benaughted brother Kelly he didn't even know the boy would be there but this boy came on this night and with his wife his boy been out of church for about 20 years and been gone and away from the Lord and and his family were his family had all Fallen apart and he'd married this girl out in the world and he said he said you know I I knew God was real but I I I just didn't know if it was for me and he marries this girl and down through time she gets diagnosed with MS and fear strikes them and they and he begins to become fearful and he says he tells his wife he said you know the doctors can't do nothing about this but I know a God who can and I know where he's at and he brings her to the house of God but before he comes he's in his room and he's crying out to God and he said God if I can only Touch the Hem of your garment if I can only come like that woman did and Touch the Hem of His Garment and he comes to that service and that's what I'm preaching on I begin to preach his very life to him I began to what was a man thousands of miles away but God was right there in his bedroom God was right there in my motel room as he would begin to speak to me and say this is what I want you to speak on this is how I want you to speak and this is where I want you to touch it why because he had a seed he had a son he had somebody there that had a need of a discerner because the word is still the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen I believe we ought to believe we ought to believe that every service that is not just man it's not just brother Tim it's not just brother Aaron Brother job brother Timothy but it is God Veil behind human flesh speaking to our hearts and he's wanting to cut things out of our Lives now sometimes those surgeries are going to hurt sometimes it's going to be very painful sometimes it's going to take a little while to recover but God is speaking to you and if you'll take it as God's speaking to you then God can deliver you God can reach down and touch you in your inward places that nobody else knows about that nobody else is maybe concerned about nobody else you've ever told but God knows your inward places God knows the Deep secrets of your heart and he knows where to go get them and that boy come into prayer line that next night and he said you know he said I came here in Fair fear he said I bet I want to give my heart to God I want to serve a God who know knows my thoughts I want to serve a God who knows my very desire I want to serve a god who's alive like that I want to give my life to him he told Brother Kelly later he's in a text he said brother Kelly me and my wife came out of fear but I'm praying that out of faith we will stay that faith will keep us fear brought us but I pray faith will keep us Hallelujah because he is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of heart and he can bring somebody from miles away he can bring somebody from just right down there and mend it wherever it is to reach down into those dark places of your life and cut that thing out of there amen God's word is able to thoroughly examine Our Lives it can do what no other book can do you can read Dr Dobson you can read all kinds of things but if you read this word of God it'll do what no other book will do amen the penetrating power of God's word can probe the innermost aspects of our thinking amen I know I could ask for hands raising maybe we'll just do it how many has actually had a conversation or thoughts or things maybe on a Sunday morning or during the week and that the very next service it comes and repeat it back to you amen it happens all the time because the word is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so therefore it not only knows your thoughts it knows the intent of the thought it knows the motive that's behind it God's word discerns who we are and what we are amen God you make him fool your mom or your daddy or your pastor but you'll never fool the word of God the word knows who you are and what you are amen it can penetrate the full depth of your motivation amen it will go into your thinking and discern what is of God and what's not of God glory to God it penetrates our self-delusion and reveals it for what it is that is why we need to ask God to search our souls amen God search my heart oh God Amen God's word renders us without the ability to rationalize our sins away amen it reduces us to a place where we have no excuse so the word is a light it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he would he would speak about the word of God in Revelations 19 and verse 11 said I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true how many is thankful for that and he and in righteousness he does judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and his head were had many crowns in his name written and no nap no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a Vester dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and fine linen white and clean but out of his mouth goes a sharp sword what is it is the word of God is is the signified or symbolized as a sharp sword it goes and it begins to cut and it'll cut off sin it'll cut off unbelief it'll caught off complexes it'll it'll cut off sicknesses in the middle of a servant it'll cut off diseases it'll it'll cut off cut off all things that are not of God amen out of his mouth goes a sharp sword and with it he shall Smite Nations he'll rule them with a rod of iron and tread at the wine press of the fearsen of the Wrath of the almighty God and he hath on his vesture on his thigh named written king of kings and Lord of lords amen we could see him over in the New Testament as he would come we we know we've been hearing about Sarah hey discerned her heart and a tent but we also see him Amen in the New Testament of how he would know their thoughts he would know what they were thinking even even in their minds they wouldn't even express it but he could see amen what they were even thinking in their minds and give them answers amen he was doing time after time and you know there was Nathaniel that would come to him and said wince though was thou me and Jesus answered said before Philip called thee when that was under the Fig Tree I saw thee so he's a discerner to the point he knows your address he knows where you are he knows what you're going through he knows what you've been through he knows your problem situation he knows your high mountains your deep valleys he knows all about you he knows when you're sitting in your doldrums and you're up shouting the victory he knows all of that amen when you was under the Fig Tree I saw thee there it is when he comes that word will come against all nations and against all men and none will be able to stand against it it will reveal what was in every heart as it did in Nathanael the word of God will show who did the will of God and who didn't do the will of God amen amen it will make known the secret works of every man and why he did them and it will divide asunder amen this is the word of God Romans 2 3 says and think as thou this o man that judges them which do such thing and does not the same that thou shall escape the Judgment of God then it goes on to say how God is going to judge men here it is in verse 5-17 a hard a hard heart will be judged The Works will be judged the motives will be judged there won't be any respect before God but all will be judged by that word no one escaping it those who heard and wouldn't listen will be judged by those by what they heard those that rested in it and saying they believed it but they didn't live it they will be judged every Seeker will come out in the open and will be shouted from the housetops oh we will really understand history then there won't be a mystery left throughout all the ages amen so everything that's been done in the secret will come out on the housetop amen it will come it will be brought out what was of God and what was not of God but do you know that he's revealing the heart secrets of men and women in this age in which we're living who else could reveal the secrets of the heart but the word himself the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper and it's the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it is the word it is performing where and unto it was sent for it the word is full of power Hallelujah it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age as a last sign trying to head the people off from judgment for they that reject him the word are now coming to judgment crucifying him afresh Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preached will actually demonstrate itself it's not just some were empty words or red letters or you know I mean just read across the pulpit and just spoken and it falls off the edge and onto the floor no this word goes out and it will find somebody that it can demonstrate itself in amen this is a discerner it goes into places and it finds those that that have need the word preach it's like a flaming cutting sword and it went to the conscious of men like a surgeon's life and it'll cut out diseases and it'll set captives free everywhere those early Believers went they went preaching the gospel and God came behind it confirming his word with signs following the sick were healed Devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians amen and in this last stage it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride Hallelujah you're a little flock your little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom amen it is here stronger than ever than the true word bride amen if he was Discerning Earth 2 000 years ago he was a discerner in our age he's still the discerner now and is here stronger than ever it still cuts out amen the dark places of Our Lives it'll still set us sinner free it'll still cut off sickness off of their life the word is still a discerner but you have to dessert there's also something that you have to he's the discerner but you also have to discern you know it's easy to discern what others have but that's not what Paul was speaking about about Discerning the Lord's body he said you judge yourself lest you be judged so therefore we for you to receive something of God you have to receive it as something from God amen you have to discern it amen to say listen that just wasn't brother Timothy or brother Tim that was God speaking to me amen and there are many people they they cut it off and they say well it wasn't of God it was just him it was just he just got in the flesh and they missed While others are receiving they miss it because they did not discern the Lord's body amen when he was here 2000 years ago and he was Discerning the hearts and he was telling him what was wrong amen Pharisees were missing it they were calling him Beelzebub and he's just a mortal man and he's just a married son and he's an illegitimate child who are you to say what I can do and what I can't do we were not born of sin as you were they were Discerning him but they were risen they were not Discerning the body of the Lord therefore they missed him they thought it was just a carpenter's son and he just Mary's Boy and he's got Brothers he got sisters and who does he think he is and meanwhile the Lord's body is walking right to their midst and they're missing it and they're doing it again today 2 000 years ago I those that come and said oh thou son of David have mercy on me you would be exactly how you are now amen if you sit like a bump on the log and the Lord is Discerning it and he's speaking to your heart and you're saying Ah that's just brother so and so that's just the flesh that's just carnal that's just there amen and you miss it by not Discerning the Lord's body [Applause] foreign and the Lord discerned him called him by name said your name is Simon he came to Jesus sat down there in Jesus as soon as he comes in your name is Simon your son of Jonas he's uneducated no decree behind him he had nothing but just a common fisherman no education the Bible said it was ignorant unlearned but he became amen the bishop of the Church of Jerusalem why Jesus told him who he was what his name was what his father was he knew and then he knew that that was the word Peter then knew that was the word because it told him who he was he told him what he was doing he told him what he was going he was going the wrong way and he called him by name and established him in a place and therefore Peter knew because the Bible says the Lord your God will raise up a prophet like unto me and that had to be a prophet there is no prophets prophesied at the Malachi to the Messiah 400 years without a prophet and all of a sudden he's hearing your name is Simon you're a son of Jonah think of it it was proved to Peter that this is the Lord's body why didn't he prove it to Caiaphas he tried but Caiaphas wasn't here he couldn't get past the veil of Flesh he couldn't get past listen that is what the devil is constantly pointing you at let's just be honest because it's through the now God could anointed this Pulpit to preach the gospel a piano to preacher or a tree to preacher but he chose men to preach to men and so the devil wants to get in that and he wants to say well that's just a man true yeah I am just a man but behind that there is a voice that is speaking and it's speaking out and it begins to say things and it begins to go down Hearts lines and situations and it begins to minister and those that can discern it say hey that's not just brother Timothy that's the Lord's body that's God speaking to me that's God touching my heart that's god Set Me Free that's God delivering me that's God moving on my behalf that's God rich and mercy listen we are not getting mad when the preacher says something that we get all worried you know steps on our toes a little bit you ought to be happy when the preacher says something because God rich in Mercy thought enough about you he could have left you like Caiaphas but he called you Peter and he said come out from among them and be not worshipers of them and walk with me there's one standing in the midst he saw this so we're another man a few days later went and got his buddy around the mountain by 15 miles they was preaching brought him back the next day they were standing there amongst them and would come up to where Jesus was and Jesus looked he was God he had discernment that showed that making that was making the word he proved the word to him he said some of them say you know that that man's the word then priest said nonsense that guy ain't the word that can't be the word you know you know the scripture says the Lord Our God will raise a prophet up like to Moses and that's him listen to him I can't listen to him he's just a man he's Mary's son he turned to Nathanael and he says behold and Israelite in whom there is no God master how did you know me before you even came to church before you even drove the miles to be here I knew you foreign before you even while you was in your sour mood I knew you even when you was doubting I knew you even when you thought all hope was gone I knew you even when you thought it wasn't for you I knew you but not only do I know you I've called you to be mine Hallelujah the word is a discerner he knows exactly where you're at it was a little woman thinking there was a little woman at the well found herself in a bad situation seemed impossible that she would ever have anything from God been with been married five times living with a man that wasn't her husband but then the seventh man come and he's sitting on the well looks like just an ordinary man looks like not just anybody got a little hot seeking a good drink of water and shade maybe and he just sitting there looks like an ordinary man and she comes about to mind her business with her water pot and she begins to draw some water he said hey I would just give me a drink she said is it customary for a Jew to ask the Sumerian to give him a drink you know she got real real religious all of a sudden been married six times but she got real religious all of a sudden amen I've been in all kinds of things in her life but all of a sudden we're getting real religious and so that and so they began to begin to say she said well well you know he said woman if you knew who I was you would ask me for a drink and she looked at him and was like what are you talking about give me a drink you don't even have what I got I got a water pot you don't have no water pot you don't have what I've got I got more than what you've got what do you mean you're going to give me oh she was seeing was what was right before her and we know the story goes a little deeper as he would take her from there and she would he would begin to speak to her and said hey I believe you're a prophet and then he wanted to take her a little deeper and he said listen amen he began to tell her look you have you have the go get your husband she said I don't have a husband he said you said well he said because the man you're living with is not your husband you've had you've had five before and now the one you're living with is not your husband you said well she said I perceive you more than the prophet I perceive there's something more about you I know when the Messiah cometh he'll tell us all things and he said I am he nothing changed about him he looked exactly the same but the words came out of him but to her everything changed hallelujah amen the scripture was saying she left her water pot she left what she thought was so important that God had more than what God could offer but God showed her really quick I got more than that I got something that the world can't give and the world can't take away I'm a lawyer I've looked at a lot of Samaritan women and men that have left their water pots and have left their broken sisters that have left their governments and their Creeds and they're walking with Jesus amen nothing changed about him but what she saw changed that's what he wants to do he wants to change you we're all interested in changing everybody else well I tell you what brother brother the brother Pastor wouldn't say this and he wouldn't do that well listen God wanting to change you amen that's what the scripture says shall we go back to it examine let every man examine himself we want to examine everything is it of God is Not of God examine yourself find out if there's something on the inside of you that needs to change he said the reason why many are weak and sickly and some have went to sleep or died prematurely or brother Brandon would even say had went into spiritual death is because they failed to examine themselves they failed to discern they want to discern all the other things but discern yourself look inwardly and say hey is there something in me that needs to change amen it's because he said because if we would judge ourselves then we should not be judged and when we're judged we are chastened to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world hallelujah hallelujah so when we let the word judge us then we won't be judged with the world what we just read were all the thoughts are going to be shouted from the mountaintops and all the secret things are going to be revealed and nothing will be left in the dark amen if you'll let the word discern you and judge you now you won't be judged then he's a discerner but there stood priests there said heard all seen all these things seen many of the Miracles seen many of the signs see many of the Wonders he's nothing that's just nothing but Beelzebub I just I can't be God that's nothing but beelze above me they deserve it but these others that I'm speaking of the woman at the well and and the other subscription Nathanael and Peter they discern and recognized who he was others called in Bells above others called him names they couldn't because they couldn't discern this is the Lord's body they could discern the skies but not the one who made them and today as today they call it mental telepathy they call it mind reading they say today there's just a man or someone told him that couldn't be of God that's just brother so and so not Discerning that that is God the light the designer we must discern and judge ourselves lest we be judged and have respect for the body of Christ see people that don't come to the house of God why do they not come because they're not deserting the Lord's body they don't discern that's where God is they say Ah that's just Tim Pruitt's church or that's just this or that and the other and they fail to recognize the holy ghost moving Among Us hey we're gonna get a little sticky things for a minute but just bear with me Lord willing we'll make it out of here I challenge you go listen to the the sermon respects respect brother said respects is what we owe to God that's one thing I would like to drill this in the heart of every person that in all things we're going to own we must give respects to it we must respect it David said that when there were very few men of Israel perhaps Abraham Isaac and Jacob Jacob is speaking of very few men that are rebuked nations and Kings for them and God rebuked the nation and King saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm over in Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter the 13th verse it is written let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God or respect God or have reverence to God and keep his Commandments for this is the full duty of all men the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God is to respect his body to respect where he is that's why when we come into this place you know we try to keep it holy and and not talk and act up and chew gum and do all those things why because we're showing respect not to a man behind the pulpit not to those sitting in the Pew per se but yes we do that as well but but we're giving respect to the one who visits this place amen amen show and respect amen that's why we ought to be careful when we come brother go listen to The Taste after the end of the service when God will begin to deal with the hearts people wants to move around I understand you got to go to the bathroom got to go Gotta Go Gotta Go Gotta Go but then some moments the Holy Ghost is trying to go out and touch hearts we ought to have enough respect just to remain just a little bit and let God move [Applause] let him desire let him touch the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and when you can't have respect you can't have respect until you have fear you got to have the fear of God Solomon said also in Proverbs that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom that don't mean that you're afraid of it it means you're given respect you're reverence in him and when you respect God you fear God and you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear unless you would do something wrong he said I want to fear my mother I want to fear my wife I want to fear my church I want to fear all gods in other words have respects God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way I fear the lord I feel the fear of the people of the city unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian see you have to have respects you got to have fear God demands it he demands respect God does that it's not man dictating this it's God demanding this and because he's God well then he deserves respect if you truly believe he's God and if you truly believe that he's in his people he deserves respect amen if you're truly Discerning the Lord's body amen we've got to respect him and give fear to him that brings respect God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants God demanded his respects for his servants how we know that they're his servants because he's Vindicated these servants by his word he vindicates it he takes these servants and makes them Servants of God and proves that their service by making his word work through them service then as you respect the servant you are respecting God amen so when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other we are all respecting God we are Discerning the Lord's body did not Jesus say in as much as you've done to the least of these my little ones you've done it unto me be better for a millstone when hanging around your neck and you'd be drowned in the depths of the sea then to offend one of them but I say unto you that the Angels always behold my father's face in heaven and they'd be in children of God they are part of God God demands respect and then God chose whose his children are he shows it by wonders and signs and what's being done among them he brings out Noah and I'll just go through these very quickly Noah you know had a revelation from God that God was going to judge the Earth by water and to begin to preach and it was a quite of a long time of preaching 120 years and the sermon never changed it's going to rain you better get ready God has provided a way there is a way of escaped you better get in this boat you better come you better be in here it's going to rain and they didn't show respect they did not discern that was the Lord's body they didn't discern that was where the word of God was working in their age in their time and it was God's word that would allow them to go above and beyond the tribulation that was coming on them and they failed to recognize this is more than just Noah this is more than just uh you know it's going to rain they begin to laugh and make fun and Jitter around and say ah it's a bunch of nonsense it ain't never rain it ain't never going to rain it never has rain they had no respect they would stomp out of his Services they would get mad they would say all kinds of things why because they failed to recognize he went about it but he just went around preparing his ark his golfers and markers came the Bible said there's going to be those in the last days too they're going to scoff at you they're going to make fun of you they're going to say it ain't so but God brought judgment on those scoffers because they would not listen to the messenger of God and come into the ark under his preaching then God sent his Divine judgments upon the Earth first he made a preparation for all who would receive it to escape it and then if he did not Escape it there was only one thing left and they wouldn't take God's preparation of Escape there was only one thing left that was divine judgment there's only two things available Mercy or judgment you have to accept one or the other that's where we all stand tonight and we're either going to take God's mercy are we going to take his judgment there's no way of getting around it one way or the other but God has made an escape for those who desire to escape and those have respect that this is the way Moses would come and they didn't think much of Moses because he was born there and raised up in Pharaoh's house and then they found he killed one Egyptian and ran off in the desert hiding for 40 years surely God's going to find somebody else but this was the one God chose can't help it sometimes God chooses people you don't like sometimes God chooses people you don't have a lot of confidence in it's true I mean he'll use people he'll do things or he'll use them and then you won't like them laughs yeah God will raise a man up and do certain things and here he comes with a message and many of them didn't respect him Pharaoh didn't remember what are you talking about huh you've been hiding out there you just killing you on you ran off what are you talking about let my people go and he throws down a rod and the three ten plagues come and Pharaoh still didn't have respect for him Moses would walk out any brother Brandon I'm skipping through a lot of things but brother Brown would go just go listen to this sermon it's incredible there's so many things in here it'll do you a it'll give you a checkup he says strange he says these people walked out rejoiced and shouted and carrying on first little trial come and they've forgot to respect the gift of God and they begin to say things he said that's how it is that's where we make our mistake little sickness Strikers a little disaster and we go to Falling Away young convert somebody make fun of them say well you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller well I hate be called be caught and being called a Holy Roller and out they'll go amen that is the time to respect what God has said and stand foreign I've already done these Miracles God's given you them or now you're afraid of the sea are you afraid to believe and he took the rod and began to speak to it and he began to move and then God would go from there and he would make the bitters water sweet he would he would do all kinds of things feed him rain out of bread out of heaven and quails and all kinds of things whatever Rock and they would complain and they would murmur and they would make fun and even his own sister see Moses who do you think you are you think you're a God Among Us she fell to respect she thought it was just her brother but it was God and God struck her with leprosy and Moses actually had to go in the breach for her for God to save her life and God would cleanse her we know the story and we go on down and Moses would pray for her and God would give we can go to Jezebel who who Elijah was sent to be her pastor but she didn't have respect for him she didn't have respect for what he said she thought well that's just oh Elijah he's crazy as a betsy bug run out to the desert we don't hear from him then he comes running here declaring the judgments of God then he runs away again that can't be nobody but that can't be God oh yeah he'd ball her out tell her of her sins yet he was her pastor and she wouldn't receive it at all she disrespected him she hated him for what he had said she disrespected the message that Elijah was preaching God demands respect we have to discern the Lord's body and when she respected God's Prophet she disrespected God why his visions and everything were perfect before God but it condemned them for what they were doing well we can find others in that day before we get there I got one more you know respect for the house of God starts at home it starts with father and mother and it starts by allowing you know it really it even starts even in some ways of allowing your pastor to be a man and allowing preachers to be men and allowing them yeah they're going to make mistakes but that ain't what we got to talk about around our mashed potatoes and chicken they're going to say things we don't like but that ain't got about got to be what we discuss around our table we can read about it brother Brown talks about the children that the Elisha called out the she Bears upon them he said why did that happen why were they disrespectful toward the prophet of God he said because their mom and dad sat around the table and began to disqualify everything the prophet said and began to Mock and make fun and make light of it and say well I can't believe you would say that I can't believe he would do that and it caused their death do you realize sometimes when you sit there and you begin to say well this brother over here brother Joe brother Timothy brother and you begin to pick out their faults and we got them we all got them but the Bible said judge yourself lest ye be judged he said well what's that Jesus said about people walking around wanting to pick out a a was a splinter in somebody's finger meanwhile they're walking around with a big old beam in their eye we all got we all make mistakes we're going to say things you don't like we're going to step on your toes we're going to step on our toes all the time that is I've sat back there it's like Lord why did you wear my toes out so bad it hurts sometimes but it's for our good God is trying to mold it's trying to make us trying to make us aware of where we're at and if we're not careful we'll we'll just tear it all down and make it nothing but carnal until we're throwing our kids to the Bears preacher can say something before they even get out the door you don't text to them and say well I can't believe he said that why because you're throwing why why because you don't have respect and you're throwing them to the Bears God is the discerner I don't even know if somebody's actually done that but God does we wonder why kids are having issues well they can't ever raise up why they can't ever rise above rise above certain things because they see their daddy and their mama hadn't done it I'm being serial tonight God wants us to have respects there's a few kids that are crying out for their mom and dad to really release themselves and worship God they want to see that they want to see that passion they want to see that desire they want to see that auction of the Holy Ghost they've disrespected the prophet and thereby they throwed their kids to the Bears so many things in here I want to get somewhere but we find some people who did respect it finally shooting my woman she was from shoonam but she believed God and she seen this man pass through town and heard him speak she's seen the signs that he's done it's told in history said I said I don't know if it was true but he said no but it's one it's told in history one day a bunch of wild dogs are trying to catch a little girl he said this ain't scripture it's just a story I read and said the shunivite woman was standing in the corner she saw these dogs was going to kill this little girl and this holy man was passing to the town and he raised his staff up to God and cried up for Mercy to them little children like that and the dogs turned and went away from them wow we have children being ate by bears and children being dogs moving away from them it's our attitudes it's our attitudes toward the word of God he said whether it was so or not sounds like it could be I don't know but anyhow this woman when the Bible says she perceived that this was a prophet a holy man she perceived something that happened she seen what he was she perceived it and she had respect instead of disrespecting him like Jezebel did she respect him she deserved this is the Lord's body and she said to her husband we are well able to do this I pray thee let's build him a little house out here somewhere let's give him a little place for he's weary I watched him he's getting old I've noticed his old gray hair is hanging down little old staff and his skinny arms he needs a place of rest and he come walking along packing that little Cruise of oil inside and a piece of sheepskin and the hot sun his body looks scorched and red and she said I pray that he let's make a little station for him to stop right here God is there any shooting my women in the building tonight and say listen I know God is passing through and I want to make a little room in my house I want to have respect for him that when he comes with love or he comes with a correction or he comes with however he wants to come I want to have a place that he can rest at and be a peace out in my house a man said yeah I've watched him he's of God he called a contractor spent a lot of money built him a place of rest fixed them up a place to wash his feet to eat a little food Prophet Bible came by of course that blessed his soul to see something like that had been done for him he said hey he's like go call her and ask her what I could do for her can I speak to the king or to the chief captain she said I dwell among my people and there's nothing I have need of but gays I said she has no children and her husband is well stricken in age he's old and they have no children and I imagine Elijah laying there on this little bed that she had blessed him by making had his feet all washed his beard was washed out just relax and all of a sudden a vision came foreign go call her and tell her to stand there before me call her why because she had respect unto God go tell her to come here and she stood in the door and he said thus saith the Lord about this time next year you'll bear a baby about this time next year she had the baby why because of respect to God and her her emotions that she she released was respect I gotta have a place where he could have a place of peace I want my home to be a place he can dwell in I want it to be a place that the healing angel can come by and he can walk through my door I want him here it open I want him here at Creek he'll just walk through my door but all of a sudden I'll feel that cool sweep reach over me and it'll be over with why because I had respect unto his word I believe what he said didn't discount it to be just a human thing a carnal impersonations no and we know the story the son would die later but that didn't change her respect can't believe God gave me this and now it's gone can't believe it when we're going to have something that lasts no no she said give me a Mew I got to go find that prophet and she goes riding to him and I want you to see the respect that she had for him she didn't she fell down she began to worship but what happened he asked her said is it well with thee is it well with your home and she said all is well that's the respect she had for that man of God because she knew of that man of God could come to where she had that need it would be over with and if we can have that much respect towards the word of God that when he speaks he's going to do what he said he would do it might take a year it might take 10 years I don't know how long it's going to take but God said it and I've got enough respect for him to believe what he said how dare me be disrespectful and deny that it won't happen and deny it's not possible I know it will happen because he said it would happen all is well yeah we could look at Martha had respect my go let's go listen to the sermon it's amazing but we know he is still the discerner and there is a special class of people who are Discerning where the Lord's body is where the carcass is the Eagles are going to gather where the word of God is there's going to be Eagles there and showing respect to his body and thereby showing respect for him he is the light the discerner Hallelujah now let's go real quick I don't know if I can
