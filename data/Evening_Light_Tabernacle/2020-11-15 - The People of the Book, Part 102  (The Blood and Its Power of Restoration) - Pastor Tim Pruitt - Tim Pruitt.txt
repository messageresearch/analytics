let's just give a handcuff of praise this morning amen enter into his hearts of praise amen enter into his gates with thanksgiving praise he the lord amen amen how wonderful the lord is how great is his faithfulness turn with me to revelation 5 and verse 1 i'm going to read from there this morning as we look into the word of god and praying that the lord will speak to hearts and lives amen as we minister from this scripture today revelation 5 verse 1 and i saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals i just never get tired of this scene and i saw a strong angel and i can hear the prophet of god say it as he comes across this very place he said oh maybe i'm i'm just feeling this way but let him let him come forth and take the book and to loosen the seals saying who is worthy with a loud voice he was saying proclaiming with the loud voice who is worthy to open the book and the loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld in low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having ever one of them harps and golden vials full of voters which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and i beheld and i and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as our indices and all that are in them heard i say in blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever amen god bless you amen as you just read here today with me the great process of redemption amen we keep it in mind it is a process that begins with one sitting on the throne holding a book and continues on until the a lamb is slain and the slain lamb takes the book and then it continues on until all creation worships god amen so it is a process all till the renewal of the earth is made new again because it's all a part of the plan of redemption note the slain lamb the blood and its atoning thus cleansing power the cleansing power of the blood can never be over emphasized that's why i'm speaking this morning on the blood and its power of restoration the scripture said in revelation 1 5 he has washed us from our sins in his own blood revelation 5 it says that thou verse 9 said that was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation so we can see here that everything that he does in redemption is by his blood but without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin and then finally our our overcoming comes by blood as it says in revelation 12 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb so as we have been speaking in the last few days of and few services on worries that you're standing and what is our position and then we we are seeing that even heaven is doing something in this last day as things are moving and things are happening and and we see the lamb that was slain at calvary that he stands and in order and he stands in an order to be as for slain lamb to stand he has to be a resurrected lamb and he stood and he took the book and removes its seals and i think neither can we overemphasize the great god upon the throne how that he became a man to be the slain lamb for our sins was not a junior god that he sent or another god it was the very god who would be manifested in the flesh for our redemption the the fact that he was a man though it causes many to stumble even among believers they want to seem to want to seem only as as god and not as a man or only a man and not as god and and we we have you know the pentecostal oneness people who got a revelation of baptism in jesus name and one god and and whatever but they only saw him they only saw jesus as god they couldn't see his humanity and those who advocate a true lord doctrine can only see his humanity but brother branham made it clear that he was either deity or the biggest deceiver the world ever saw and he he would make these kind of statements as he approached the church ages and he said the first thing you've got to know is that he's not a prophet he's not a junior god he's not a secondary god he is god amen and he repeats he is god he would go on to say the greatest of all revelations is the deity the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ and he would say the first in all revelation is the deity the supreme deity of jesus christ i am he that was which is and shall come i am the first and the last the almighty and the word he would say in the church's book the words are he is the beginner our author of the creation of god will now we know of for a surety that jesus is god very god he is the creator now we can never over emphasize though too much upon christ's person as god and man you can overemphasize he was only god you can overemphasize he was just a man but you can't overemphasize too much his person as god and man he was man yet he was the very god of heaven he was called the mighty the man of sorrow and at the same time the almighty god over all blessed forever he who was despised and rejected of man was beloved and adored by angels the bible said the angels worshiped him and he who men hid their faces from him with contempt was as i said worshiped by cherubims and seraphims again this is the mystery of godliness that god was manifested in the flesh he who was god and yet in the beginning was with god as the logos the word whereby he created all things the word that would be made flash to dwell among us it was the highest stripping to become the lowest it was the greatest that was taking his place among the least the one who sat upon the well it's psycho and the one who said give me to drink to a woman there um a woman there at samaria was none other than he that digged the oceans the man who was of the substance of mary the seed and the egg being of god but yet the recipe of this seed and egg was mary from whom the substance taken from her body wrapped flesh around the blood cell of god his manhood was real and essential it differed from our own humanity and that he was sinless and he was born without sex yet he was born of a woman wrapped in swaddling cloths laid in a manger he needed to be nursed by a mother just like any other child he grew in stature just like any human being as a man he ate and he drank he hungered he thirst he rejoiced in sorrow his body could be touched and handled and wounded and made to bleed he was he was a man of flesh he was certainly no ghost he could be made to bleed he wasn't just a vision he was absolutely flesh and blood like us and that he needed sleep he required rest and food and was subject to pain and who in the end would yield up his life unto death he was born sinless so unlike all of us who were born in this sin shape and iniquity he was the perfect man he was incapable of corruption by sin yet he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh he is man a son of man meaning a man of dust and yet he was the second adam hebrews 2 and 14 says for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he himself also himself likewise took on part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil you can see what he was doing he would come flash for that purpose to destroy and break the yoke of sin and satan off of our lives you see though through the fall by being birthed in the sand and dust into mortality we were born and we needed redemption from the cradle our human birth birthed us into sin into sickness disease and failure in the message oneness brother branham would say when adam and eve um listen to the lie of the devil the holy image of god left them and their fellowship was broken and their fellowship of oneness with god was broken the very moment the minute they listened to the lie of the devil they broke their fellowship and the very minute you listen to the lie of the devil it'll break your fellowship and that's the very minute you go out of the presence of god like she did is when you fail to take god's word just as it says now he could not redeem us as god we had fallen from that we had lost our godship come on amen and losing our heavenly qualities but we were instead we were fallen man and so god came in the likeness of human flesh he was born of a woman wrapping himself in soil that was cursed you remember god had said i cursed the ground for adam's sake so he would actually wrap himself in cursed earth amen making that curse earth that earth that was cursed obedient to god himself and take it to the river jordan to be baptized and to be filled with the spirit of god the first time since all of time that a man could totally and completely yield every member of his body to god was that was in jesus think of that here he took on the form of man to be kinfolk to be our redeemer yet he is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords in so much he was god though also a man according to the hebrew law he was a goel which me means our kinsmen the next of kin and according to the law if a inheritance had been lost it was the right of the next of kin to redeem it and our lord jesus exercised his legal rights and this is what you're seeing him do in revelation 5. he is actually exercising his legal rights as a kinsman and seeing us sold in the bondage and our inheritance taken away from us he came forward to redeem both us and our lost estate i want you to understand that at calvary he redeemed us but we're seeing him in revelation 5 claiming the lost estate that man had lost to restore it back to man again so we are here in the very moment in time when god is doing something very spectacular and that is he is restoring the lost estate that adam lost back to man again and he showed it here as he as a man is taking the book he does not take it as almighty god but he takes it as a man amen only a man could do this someone of flesh and blood as we were amen managed sin and man not god not god just a man could make reparations for those sins and the breach of law was caused by man and it must be repaired man had transgressed and man must be punished no angel could have said i will take this man separately i will take mankind's punishment angelic sufferings could not make amends for human sins amen god could not do it this is one thing that god could not do he could not make amends for human sins amen he could not do it as almighty god it would require a kin kinsman someone can vote so in order for god to do this god would take on human flesh he would strip out of heaven he would leave the holy throne he would walk out of his majestic garments and lay them aside and walk down a long sinful man for the purpose to be your kinsmen god becoming kinfolk to you being born uh in the flesh like you're born into flesh so he could rebirth you from human back to god again [Music] god left his throne to be born a man and that man jesus none other was none other than jehovah himself coming to be our savior the matchless one this the sinless man the representative a man of right by ken folks only he could be allowed to redeem he stepped in and he and he suffered that that which was due and he made amends for man and thereby he set us free i want you to understand it was god's design and god's great plan because he knew the heart of man and he knew that man would fall he knew he could place him upon freemore agents and he would choose the wrong thing anyhow but before before sin ever entered the picture he already was the redeemer for he was that great lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world in the mind of god he had planned it before the fall ever took place knowing that you would fall he already had provided the way back and he said i am the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and in god's great mind he stepped out of eternity there and played out what he had in his mind in flesh oh this is wonderful it is the man that we see oh it is veiled symbolically as a lamb but it is only representing the work of the redeemer as the sacrifice and it shows him as a man advocating for you amen you know again to take and into lucid seals he would have to be the advocate for all mankind he would have to be the go-between between god and man because there was no man worthy and able to take the book and restore back the title of man's loss to state think of this as we as we look upon him this morning look upon this scene we see a man going forth to take the book and to lose his seals oh if you're even a sinner today and far from god i think it's wondrous that your approach to god is through the man christ jesus for he would say himself no one can come unto god to the father except by me that he would be the means of the approach back to god that he himself when man lost the way would become the way in order to approach god again and to come back into fellowship again and you are not being called to come near a consuming fire that would wipe you out in an instance you are not summoned to to try and appease an angry god who has been so grievously offended but there is a man ordained amen who is the only mediator between god and man and if you want to come to god you must come through him the man christ jesus satan has done everything that he can to discredit this man to take away his advocacy to reject him his intercessor to say he no longer intercedes but the very act of him taking the book of redemption is a part of his intercessory work and it shows him as the great intercessor between god and man when man couldn't go get the book and could not regain his lost estate god came a man in order to pay the price of redemption to probe to approach god without christ would be certain death and rejection i want to say this even today no man dare to approach god without christ for god he will by no means spare the guilty but oh isn't it wonderful that we can look and see the son of man one of our own race who became the lamb for the sins of man to pay the penalty of sin this one who is our king the lion of the tribe of judah who threw off his his kingly robe and laid aside his crown and walked among us as our kinsmen when we look and we see and we get a view of him give me a little more sound of here and you get a you get a view of him here in his earthly walk and how what his attitude was toward the sick what his attitude was to the lost amen what moved him he would constantly be moved to compel with compassion are you with me amen it was it was no transient feeling he still feels toward his offspring the same way you can depend on it church a man that you're coming to a compassionate god a compassionate one who cares who sincerely cares about the suffering that you're going through or your lost sinful estate some of you are going around as it was through the air and over heels over heels over heels going there in a bottomless fall and there is none that can help you i cannot help you a church cannot help you hey man your mama and your dad cannot help you your nearest friends cannot help you the only one that can break that fall is him who can reach out of compassion at hand and break the fall of any sinner and put him on solid ground the compassion of jesus no is not a changeable feeling it's not transient he still feels toward us the same as it was when he walked and he looked upon the blind staggering in darkness and he looked upon blind men who were were with compassion and he and were asking for mercy and he touched their eyes and they could see he looked upon a leper who said lord if thou will make me clean and he said i will be thou clean it's the hope for every leprous sinner who is unclean who who goes about the world with their mouth and face covered and screaming out i'm unclean i'm unclean oh they may not do that naturally maybe their hearty and think of their themself as great but their life is absolutely ringing out i'm unclean i'm unclean i'm unclean and they get among the clean and they feel so unclean and they feel a sense of rejection and distance somehow i just don't fit in somehow i'm just not accepted somehow because they're leprous with sin and their soul is screaming out i'm unclean i'm unclean i'm unclean amen but oh he looked upon a leper who come to him and said oh if thou will make me clean and he quickly affirmed that was his will to make the leper clean he looked upon the multitude who was and was concerned that they would fade upon the way and up on the road as they departed and he took fishes and loaves and fed 5 000 because his compassion moved him it was said of the of the greek soldiers i think they were macedonians soldiers who were led by alexander the great these men would march with forced marches and and and they they they seemed to do it with without fatigue would move and go here and go there and go here and go there at the at the whim of their of their leader alexander the great and they seem to go beyond the power of mortal endurance but the reason of their untiring energy lay in the fact of alexander's presence you see alexander though he was a king he would walk with him he would bear the same fatigue they went through he was unlike the persian monarchs who would be carried on a pier and and um and and they're on a luxurious litter on their shoulders and be fed wine and and choice foods as the men struggled but alexander the great the king their king marched with them he hungered like they hungered he thirsted like they thirsted it was said of him he would often put aside the cup of water that was offered to him and pass it to a fellow soldier that looked more weary than himself they would they wouldn't dream of slacking for their king walked among them their king was with them it wasn't him just saying go do this and go do this but he was walking with them and i want to just say today we can surely bear the poverty the slander the contempt or even the bodily pain because jesus christ our lord has done it all for us by his humiliation we can count it all joy that we are looked down upon the world for his name's sake amen by the spindle that ran down his cheek it is something a virtue amen to be a mockery now for him by the buffeting and the blindfolding in the judgment hall it's an honor to stand with him disgraced while world takes and scourges him and mocks him and crucifies him we stand with him isaiah said and a man shall be a hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest this is isaiah 32 and 2 a man a man shall be a hiding place i want you to know this land that we're looking at is our hiding place he is our covert our shelter from the tempest he is our rock in a weary land and our shelter in the time of storm he is our kinsman and we can shelter in his love and passion notice it was 2 000 years ago that he paid for our sins and he sent back a deposit of the holy ghost which is the earnest of our inheritance you know what time would fail us if we talked about why the lamb was slain how the lamb was slain there have been we're we're familiar with that story we we many of you have seen even movies of the passion of christ or you you've seen scenes have been mocked you read it in the scripture it's always a very difficult place for me when i read my bible and go through the scriptures to have to go through that part as i think of a man so kind so wonderful so compassionate so moved by the holy spirit that he couldn't leave a blind eye unopened he couldn't leave a lame with a on his crutches but made him walk he couldn't pass up a funeral possession without restoring a young boy back to his mother and how could it be that he would be mocked and made fun of oh yes a robber a criminal someone deserving yes but how this but now we look at a different scene we look at a scene that is not preached on by the world that will be hardly referenced anywhere in denominational pulpits yeah today that will preach about christ and his sufferings on the cross but there's very little being preached aware that he stood in the breach for us to take our inheritance back for us and we read what happened two thousand years ago and yes there are those that are preaching and declaring and and and and and sharing today uh the the wondrous experience of the upper room and how he came down like tongues of fire and and i'll spread out there from there the gospel but now we're here seven church ages later and heaven is moving again as by revelation the lamb takes the book of our inheritance and he loses the seals it was at calvary we were redeemed but now the lamb moves in heaven it's not to pay for the price of our sins for our soul salvation that was david calvary he paid and died once and for all he need not die again and again and offer himself as a sacrifice over and over and over his one death was sufficient for all but now again here we're looking at now seven church ages later heaven moves as by revelation now remember it's always first by revelation first it was in symbol john saw it then it would be by revelation to a prophet and then it will finally be been manifested in a literal format now as we as we see this the lamb takes the book of our inheritance and loses the seals we were redeemed at calvary but now here we see the lamb continuing in his intercessory work now you say oh brother jim it all stopped when he took the book it did not because he continues right on with the jews in in the in the book of revelation he is the lamb they're among the 144 thousands amen all redemption may come and does come to a point where it's over for the gentiles but it continues right on with the lamb among the 144 000 and his redemption work as he fills them with the holy spirit and they are sealed but i want you to look at this but to take this book of our lost estate to redeem back to man everything adam lost it was not accomplished at calvary it was just the it was just started the process and this act of the taking of the book of title to our lost estate brother branham would say it is the most sublime the most awesome majestic most glorious rapturous act in all the scripture i don't know what you look at when you look at revelation 5 but this is this is what brother branham how he viewed it he said it's the most sublime act it's the most majestic glorious rapturous awesome act in all the scripture amen to do it the lamb had to take the book a title from the one on the throne and since it is closed and sealed remove its seals and to do that he must take his blood because the debts can only be paid for by lamb's blood and he must erase the depths of sin that has kept the book of inheritance closed to man the same blood to cleanse your soul must now cleanse the deaths on the book now where are we standing where has god positioned us in this time what is the blood done for us when a bloody lamb steps forth to take the book and lose its seals and confers the title to the earth upon us because i want you to understand that we we are in a time where we stand exactly like they did in the book of acts when they received the cleared deed are you with me amen when their deed was cleared and there on the day of pentecost they went out speaking in all languages the wondrous works of god they would be heard in all nations under heaven and we come again to the last days where the bible prophesies this happens again for in revelation 10 7 again we see christ the mighty angel coming down putting his land his foot upon the land and on the sea and there when he cries when he shouts when he begins this process amen a prophet sounds and he begins to sound his message and the seven thunders of revelation 10 are revealed which are the mysteries contained in the seven seals amen because what you're seeing is in the invisible realm there's something that has happened that is beyond the naked eye but revelation 5 catches a glimpse of it and revelation 10 also he also emboldens that glimpse or enhances that glimpse where we can see the same book that could not be looked upon is now looked upon those that was once considered unworthy to look upon it and we see again uh the mighty angel coming down just as the day of pentecost the mighty angel the pillar of fire comes down and he separates his self and now he comes upon every individual he begins to anoint men and women and they begin to proclaim the wondrous words of god in every language and then we see in revelation 10 the mighty angel coming down if i can use brother branham's words for it he would say it like this he said and when he took and he opened the seals he handed him down to the seventh angel on earth i want you to notice it did not it did not it did not stay in the heavens but the receipt of that the receipt of the paid debts would send down what the white horse had done the red horse the black the pale the things that had sealed the book to from the people and kept our inheritance closed where we could not even read it if you notice in the bible no man could look or read it amen but i want you to know you are men and women today who are able to look and read it you read it and you know who the white horse is you read it and you know who the pale horse is you read it and you know the souls under the altar you read it and you know what the seventh seal is that god has broke the silence and it's initiated his coming in this last day and as he does the prayers the prayers that have been stored up that is seen in revelation 5 that that the elders were representative of all of the of the saints of all ages that the elders are holding in their there the the the prayers of the saints and in revelation in the seventh seal they're poured out because why prayers that have been held up for his coming he's had to put him on the back burner i can't do it yet in this first stage there's six more to come i can't do it in the in in in the second age there's five more to come if i would answer these prayers now there'd be many in the book that wouldn't be redeemed and they're in my mind they were part of me and i cannot stop it i must continue redemption but when it becomes time the prayers are poured out upon the altar and mixed with the incense and comes up before god and god begins to respond with thunderings on the earth as a prophet begins to interpret the symbols of the seals by revelation handed down from the and brought down by the mighty angel now but that's not all of it but then there is a people that is commanded to take the book not loose it seals it's open but to eat the book and to become one with that book and when they come one speak prophesy again just like they prophesied in the book of acts hallelujah i want you to see something that the prophecy of the book of acts it was put on hold for seven ages but it continues in the last day under the anointing of the mighty angel and there are people in this last day who are anointed to become one with that word and prophesy it to ever nation kindred tongue and tribe and people where are we standing where has god positioned us now what is the blood done for us when a bloody lamb stepped forth to take the book and lose its seals and then begins to confer the title the title to the earth upon us amen i want you to get it just a moment because not on in this book of course is the the understanding the revelation as as he writes out his will for the people in the title to my beloved children you are not you have not just come into existence in this last day but know you existed with me before the foundation of the world and i'm addressing you as not as a temporary people but a people of eternal who have that to this elect has an eternal quality that you have been chosen in me before the world began and he begins to write it out and tell you what your name is and what the family name is and that it's not under father son and holy ghost but it's the lord jesus christ of whom all heaven and earth is named and it begins to reveal and show see hears what happened at the beginning and he shows you the old serpent the villain from the beginning and how he deceived and the deception that has happened the deception in the first age and on and on and on down but yet where god brings it back the entire circle again and we're living in a time where we're not walking out of eden but we're a people who are walking back into eden [Applause] this brings us back to where adam was before the fall and to where the church was in those brief moments in the book of acts what happened in the beginning in genesis it started out without him having power trans of creation as a manifested messiah what was the church in the book of acts when their deed was cleared they controlled nature they healed the sick that made the lame walk and man they they they exposed sin they were so close to the chase from mortal to immortality till it began to be the mystery being revealed that there's a mystery in here and beloved i show you a mystery it's got to end up the same way as we close out the ages with manifested messiahs who are the sons of god on display this is exactly what is shown in revelation 10 sons and daughters of god on display it cannot be manifested sons unless they're revealed sons sons who are showing and manifesting what what who they are and their sonship has got to end up the same way this is this is what brother branham would say over and over and over again about displaying the token the token must be on just play amen and just play and it changes your life it makes you live right it talks right but it also heals and delivers and sets free it's the token on display and brother branham would tell us in order to escape the death angel that is coming it must be on display look back at the beginning adam stood as the son of god he controlled nature but when sin under the picture it put a breach a chasm between god and man and mankind has went on a long journey all the way from eden he went on a long journey until finally the promised seed came the one we're talking about the woman's seed who would bruise the head of the serpent and until and we'd go on this long journey with a chasm between man and god until the second adam came that would undo what sin had done in eden adam was a miniature creator adam had dominion over the fish of the sea the fowl of the air he was in fellowship with god amen he had direct asset access to the throne room he created an atmosphere of a millennium everywhere that he was or everywhere he went up on the earth the birds the mammals the crocodiles were all subject to him amen nothing would hurt or destroy in all of god's holy eden before the fall adam was in a position of sonship as a son of god and he operated by faith with the power and authority of heaven behind him and he spoke and trees moved he commanded and winds obeyed he exercised his rights over animals and called them by name when man sinned he forfeited his sonship to become a slave and instead of now becoming lord over creation he becomes a slave to the very creation that he once controlled the winds the waves the the the tumultuous seas the problem nothing now was under his command he he would lose power he would become subject to to adversity he would have to fear the wild animals you know he he would he would now instead of ruling by faith in god's word he would have to rule by his five senses using the five uh the five outlets of this of his spirit of memory and imagination and conscience and affection and reasoning with his superior mind he could capture animals and subdue them he could harness the energy of a horse for his own prophet he could enslave an animal for its wool and its meat and its milk then before the fall adam could walk freely into god's presence and he would literally bring heaven down a millennium condition was upon the earth but after the fall there was this distance between god and man and this distance was like a huge deep wide chasm so deep you could never climb over it so wide you couldn't see across it and managed sin and put that great chasm between him and god and oh and it was a chasm that he could not cross over by himself he was absolutely totally lost and without a way back and when man couldn't come to god god being determined to save man he himself breeds the chasm and he came in the likeness of human flesh and through his blood he made a way for those who were born in sin to be born again every one of us were born wrong the first time therefore we had to be born again amen it would be the second birth that would that would breed out all the call amen no matter what our mother did or daddy did it or grandparents did it or whatever it would breed it all out hallelujah we'd get a whole new set of genealogy we we would be a part of a whole new race it would not be another man's race but it would be the god race are you with me amen there at pentecost man and god were reconciled amen they had the contents of the book brother branham would tell us there it was actually at the river jordan that he would he would specifically say when jesus walked out into the river bringing that cursed flesh obedient to the word of god and making it obey god he would say from this part i will redeem this part and from this part i will redeem the rest now then here he would here heaven and earth would be reconciled because god and man would not be united together in the man christ jesus but he wasn't happy just to have that for himself he wanted many sons he had you in mind you wonder how did he bear the cross of calvary let me tell you friends you know he didn't just have imaginations at calvary he acts are at gethsemane he actually knew what was going to happen he knew what he would suffer he renewed the rejection that's being spit upon he would know he would know the crucifixion and the pain thereof and he would shudder at his thoughts and as even as a human he would say let it pass from me but he yielded up his own human desires to desire of god and say nevertheless not my will but thou have be done that song says he knew me yet he loved me [Music] he whose glory makes the heavens to shine so unworthy of such mercy but when he was on the cross we were on his mind the bible said that looking toward the the goal to what he would receive he bore the shame he experienced the agony in order that he could have a family that he could be kinfolk to you and pay that price of redemption and bear the debt that he did not owe and pay it on your behalf very at pentecost we see this oneness continuing here not not not just jesus the sinless one and god reconciled in a man but now now then at pentecost man and god was reconciled here they were enjoying the contents or the fruits of the book they had power of sonship as sons of the book amen oh think of this we we're we're preaching about the people of the book this is what we're talking about we're people of this book this is our inheritance this is our promise this is the land that he has brought a people to where we stand today on the other side of jordan are you with me into the third pull of the holy ghost into the power of the promise they had power as sons of the book would you stop and realize what we are in time look where we're standing on the threshold of redemption for thousands of years the book of titles that adam lost has remained in the hand of god but in this day hallelujah there's been a change as a man who is declared worthy amen to take the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne notice he had to drink it back but the book was closed and sealed with seven seals there was a preach that he put the church ages out of reach of the book of title until we come to the last days and then the worthy lamb the man christ jesus stands in the gap notice he stands to take the book this is exactly reminiscent of daniel chapter 12 1 and michael stood for the children of his people i want you to know when the bible said when this happened that the name those whose names was in the book was delivered they were delivered and there was a resurrection this is the hour that we're living in where that a people whose names are in the book will be delivered and a resurrection of all the names of all the saints that has went down through pentek from pentecost till now will raise again the man christ jesus stood in the gap in the breach that could take and could take the the book and lose its seals in order to restore the book of title to god's people revelation 5 shows him taking it revelation 10 shows him given it the truth of god's word that we're close to man truth such as original sin well you know that revelation alone explains and makes you to understand the virgin birth that revelation alone makes you to understand the sin and the garden and why we needed a redeemer amen there again baptism in jesus name one god predestination they were all sealed up oh yeah man proved at it they got some things right or part right but none could cross the chasm amen this was not this was not so in the days of the early church or in the days of peter and paul jesus had cleared the deed he had paid the dead and full he had so cleared so clear was the deed that there was not one soul left in abraham's bosom in that place called paradise the deed the deeds of all the old testament saints were cleared truths that were shut off from man what revealed is jesus was the fulfillment of all the prophecies the book was totally open to them with its power silver and gold have i none but i got something better than silver and gold miracles happened the sick were laid in the shadow of peter wherewith his shadow would pass over them and demons fled and left at the mere presence of these sons of god amen i want you to know they did not just have doctrine amen there was power released with that doctrine you cannot have true doctrine and not have the power [Applause] angels came to prison left their disciples free paul would get to looking in the book and show predestination to true eternal security peter would point out that the key that would unlock unlock many things and preach the baptism of the holy ghost from an open book saying this is that no wonder would we have to wonder about joel 2 we would know this is that we were spoken of by the by the the prophets they would stand on the edge of the full promise and begin to declare we which are alive and remain but then as the serpent begot eve now we see a replay of what happened to the natural man and natural eve now beginning to happen to spiritual event it wasn't long oh this is a heartbreak to today it wasn't long until the devil got in the book of acts church i want to present a gospel that was more pleasant to the eye more acceptable brother branham would tell us in the second seal he said the way that the devil got in the book of acts church was that he began to say i get there where the peasants stare witness to their masters who were wealthy and so on and they would come to meetings and they would say but we need we need to kind of dress this up you know so i bring my friends they look at this low down bunch of slaves and whatever let's kind of dress it up you know that that that bunch of shouting and speaking in tongues and and prophesying bunts we kind of got that to settle down a little bit and have a little more dignity about it we've heard that same hiss of satan try to come and talk to this bride in this last day and satan beguiled her and instead of bringing children by the birth of the word they begin to bring forth children of the church and notice instead of being named and even baptized after their of their father they began to take on the name of the mother and became methodist and baptist and presbyterian and sadly today they try to take on the name of message as if there's any saving qualities in that name and he beguiled her brought forth children not of christ as brother branham would say jesus came to his church and found her pregnant with the seed of man and for seven long ages now we've been on a journey just as the old testament had its long ages of the exodus the judges the kings and the prophets until finally there came a lamb who could cross the breach and clear the deed think of this the breach itself as brother branham called it was a breach between the church ages and the seals it was is a breach is a chasm a chasm that could not be crossed and and even this book that was sealed with seven seals and seven thunders uttered their voices making known the mysteries were sealed up and it couldn't be crossed in any other age i want you to realize you're living in a wonderful hour and a wonderful time as we can say there's never been a day like this one it's an hour of restoration it's an hour going from time back into eternity it's an hour there where the the book is being is being transferred by the hands of man amen we're still on here okay that couldn't be crossed in any other age right men tried looking into it they probed but none of them had an open book but finally a lamb that had been slain a lamb that had been slain two thousand years ago claimed now what adam lost and removed from the book of title it seals that it held it shut all right seals that it kept god's people from coming to full inheritance and this released the holy spirit in fullness back to the church that had been bound right and then sealed by denominational rivers waters multitudes of people and their ideas and myriads of books and myriads of teachings and myriads of understanding now sealed and closed the book that's right but finally there came a loud the slave line not a new laugh not a new atonement the same atonement the same holy ghost the same power amount i loosen the seals to bring a unsealed book the title back to man again your inheritance your title to a new body amen you're titled to divine healing you're titled to the earnest of your inheritance the holy ghost your title to every divine promise hallelujah a man a people of the restored faith that's where i'm standing we're a people of the restored faith not a new book of acts but a continuation of the book of acts christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts and i want to just tell you where we're standing it is now time to continue to write the final chapter hallelujah to write the final chapters out the book of acts of the holy ghost where he would act in man a people of the restored faith but you see sadly and as a serpent beguiled eve so did that the serpent beguiled the early church and the book became close to man and sealed and locked up its truths and its power and he set the church wandering on a long journey until the time of refreshing would come from the presence of the lord a time of restoration yes it said in second corinthians 11 3 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled the eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for if he preacher cometh that preaches another jesus who will not preach or receive another spirit which you have not received or or another gospel which you have not accepted you might bear well with him so you see like eve who could not wait for the promise to be fulfilled or be fruitful and multiply she instead got in a hurry remember what she did she crossed her her seed she mingled it with the serpency and when she did it brought forth a child of death and when the when the church of jesus christ was perverted in the time of wrong after a virgin birth and was given to christ in pentecost what did she do she crossed yourself with roman dogma and the protestant church did the same thing that's why they're called in the bible and harlots amen but i want you to want you to know god will not fail amen no sir he said i'll have a church and she will be without or wrinkle am i but to do so it takes a restoration and that's why the message of restoration is so vitally important and a mystery a mystery is not restored if his power still remains unlocked i said a mouthful right there but i want you to i want you to take note of this a mystery is not restored if its power still remains unlocked you're only reading what's on the outside of the seal you're not experiencing the power that is in the deed and that's exactly what is wrong with that with the many of the message churches today is their claim and the mysteries have been revealed but they know nothing of its power amen and a mystery is not restored if it's if it's power still remains unlocked amen to restore the mysteries is to return the power of it to the church so many have tasted the knowledge of the mystery and yet know nothing of its power when its power is known sin and unbelief looses its hole did you hear me amen but you see again brother brandon said it is a fact this laodicean church it is a fact that the prophet for the last day must be bringing forth a message from god that will forerun the second coming of the lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the pinnacles of fathers and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the power so you cannot say because there you know the mechanics of a mystery unless the dynamics of it is there you have not received this mystery and it has not released its power how many have a knowledge of the mystery of the new birth but have experienced nothing of its power the future home brother bradham would talk about that and let me deviate just a moment as one of our themes is always about the new birth and you must be born again and against this easy believism that bursts you into just another denominational child and that's what we got today in the message today is denominational children who don't know who their father is that's why you got all of these different doctrines and thoughts and everything else because they don't know the fatherhood of the world are you with me but brother brandon said in the future at home he said just like all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you amen you know again we we got all the i accept christ as my personal savior that's good but what about him the holy ghost must accept you [Music] are you with me amen you say well brother tim i i i told you i i've done everything and if he has not accepted you they're still somewhere you haven't died to sin amen because when you be when you die to sin he will accept you amen amen see you don't accept it let me just go back so you get the entirety of this quote just like all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you see you don't accept it it except you because it's god's attribute see the holy ghost means god's spirit is the attribute the thought of god has accepted you because you were ordained for that purpose when the holy ghost comes it's simply the thought that god had of you and you in time coming together amen were you recognized i came from god i'm going back to god everybody he's my father yet you were born in sin but but god had that attribute and here you expressed yourself on earth and he comes down and gets you and you're back here here's where you belong but see sin has lost its power that's right the desire of sin has gone from your heart when the holy spirit comes in you're a restored person hallelujah amen so if you're restored you know of its power it's a power of deliverance it's a power of victory it's a power there that you have over the flesh over sin over evil oh brother get this baptism of the holy ghost when god accepts you and sin loses his power and sin desire is gone from your heart and you walk now not after the flesh but after the spirit i don't care if you have to boohoo and snot at an altar and roll on the floor in agony you stay there until your life is declaring the wonderful works of god amen we're at an end time here we are walking back into eden restoration will be complete when our bodies are changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye now that's for us the earth will go on in this process of restoration but that's what we need a renewing for to awaken our faith to the reality of god this is exactly the purpose of malachi 4 was to turn your heart back to believing and brother branham would say we find out that we're missing something in our churches and that is the power of christ amen you know i i want to i wanted to say we're not maybe missing great preachers we're not missing maybe a great theology we're not missing great doctrines but we're missing the power of it and that's what's missing in our homes amen there's no power over the flesh that's what's missing in people's individual life that's why porn sites are being visited among those who call ourselves believers this is why adulteries and fornication are taking place even in the pulpit and i'll tell you why we're missing something is because too often pastors are still preaching reformation instead of restoration but we are not in the time of reformation we're trying to reform where men and women are getting reformed that would only produce another organizational child amen but this is where that we are being we are being transformed amen by what up complete restoration and it doesn't produce a denominational child but a restored son with power amen denominational children they always have to be reformed by constant preaching against the sins of the flesh over and over and over you hear it from over and over the sins of the flesh and your flesh and your flesh and your flesh and your flesh and your flesh and and and there are attempts to reform you that's right you know in the future home brother branham drew a human heart with a snake in it and the fruits of it on the outside that showed up in a person's life of malice and hatred and evil but it was all caused by this root of sin nature said it would be this serpent here that was coming out from him and he would explain there that to come to christ and ask for forgiveness of your sin would simply wipe away your past deeds but it didn't it doesn't deal with sin nature amen that old root of evil is still there and then you repent and you get baptized in jesus name that he forgave you of sins and and and that repentance and that ushering in and that baptism accepts you into a body of believers in the fellowship of believers but i want you to think of it it only makes you like a jew in the old testament where your sins pass are placed upon the lamb and the lamb is put into death in your place but the root of sin that made you sin is still there this was the condition of the old testament wasn't they didn't have a lamb it wasn't that the blood would not blot out their transgression it was that it had never came into the soul and they would be born of that blood i want you to hear what i'm saying amen because i i want you to understand friend if this reforming won't ever get us anywhere i can preach this and preach that and tell you this is wrong and that's wrong and it condemns you and tells you you need jesus and you come and you repent and and you ask forgiveness and and so on but unless there's an inside change unless old sin nature dies out he will come again and just put more marks against you and bring an evil testimony upon the church of jesus christ are you with me amen but i want you to hear this in romans in romans um in romans 8 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll make alive because he that raised the christ from the dead shall also make alive your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you amen what your body made alive by the spirit oh you say brother tim that's future no that's when the holy ghost comes in and make sure in the future he'll quicken it he'll make it alive he'll raise it up from the dead he'll take it from a pile of ashes and make a full a person out of you again sure it will but right now if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead if that holy ghost dwells in you it will make alive your mortal body it'll bring it in subjection oh yeah therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh we don't owe our flesh nothing it has no control over it and it's not to rule over us amen but listen here for you if you live at the spirit you shall or after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit to mortify the deeds of the body you shall live and that the spirit's indwelling we'll kill mortify the deeds of your flesh [Applause] absolutely if you ever get that man or woman converted you don't have to worry about the deeds of the flesh oh yeah amen romans 8 1 said there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death hallelujah people who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit born of his spirit washed in his blood amen the message took him brother bradley said it this way there it is it cannot perish now the light lays over it's a token it lays upon the soul of that person there is a token over there or in other words over the soul upon the soul the holy spirit that belongs to god it's his when i see the token i'll pass over you a positive token the holy spirit is our token therefore when you receive the holy ghost you have passed from death unto life that's all there is to it because there's a life in you and you can no more perish the bible said he that's born of god does not commit sin for he cannot sin for the seed of god amen the seed of god remains in it and how can he sin when the sinless god is in him when us he's in a sinless god how can he sin no matter what he's done that blood's covered him he's a new creature now his desires and ambition is of heaven because he's changed from a cuckleber to a weak his desires is not the same as it was that once was and he displays it you say oh i believe that and still sitting nah you're deceived it can't display nothing but the token hallelujah we're talking about manifested sons of god sons of god on display who are displaying nothing but the token [Music] oh but you say brother tim it's my flesh my flesh is my flesh is out of control it's unconverted and it's an animal and i just can't make it do right my soul's right but i just can't live the life and this is a cry of every denominational christian there yes we just don't have the power to live it we know what's right but we can't do it you see them preaching yeah they're preaching about a revelation a mystery of a new birth without his power and the mystery is not known until the power is known amen calling jesus on the scene brother branham said now remember he created our bodies and won't our body have to obey him amen you surrender your thoughts to him surrender your life to him surrender your faith to him watch that body obey what he says then he explains if you're a drunkard and you can't quit drinking surrender that life to him and watch you'll drink no more if you're a visual smoker and try to give it up and can't do it just surrender that to him and watch what happens he'll make that body come back in subjection to the word you've got to surrender it to him you got to believe him he he made our bodies they obey his will also do you believe that if you're a christian you have to you say he makes our body obey oh i believe we have jurisdiction over that sounds like a lot of these girls on facebook or some of these things are going out you know why it's my body i you know you know this this baby it's it has no business here i can kill it any time i want this my body it's not your body it's a life and besides you said well we have a choice yes you did you already had your choice you made the wrong choice amen but you know again he makes he said oh i believe we got jurisdiction over that he said then you're not fully surrendered you're not you for you're not you're on you're dead you yourself are dead and your life is here in god through christ and sealed by the holy ghost amen how are you going to get away from that i think we need revival our lives are dead we are dead your own thoughts you think pure thoughts them worldly thoughts that lead you off you're dead to that and your life is here in god through christ and sealed by the holy spirit what a position what a secure oh my how long to the next revival until the day of your redemption you say brother brother tim you mean i no longer have a wrong thought yeah you get wrong thoughts but you quickly throw them out amen because why the holy spirit is there to convince you of sin amen you're sealed to the david dempsey that is a secure feeling such a restoration the holy spirit with complete control sin nature gone until a people becomes positioned like adam at the beginning with sin dealt with and conquered and speak the word with creative power [Music] remember this is where adam was before the fault he spoke the word with creative power amen this is the restoration power of the blood it is bringing the people back with the holy spirit with supreme control and sin nature gone until we are positioned like adam was in the beginning words i want you to think of this words with creative power save 120 in the upper room and anointed peter to preach and 3 000 were added words with creative power raised a to his feet the word was open was bringing past visions voices god speaking a nearness no chasm now listen church i want to give something to you because well you know we we got the word but do we realize why the word was written brother branham would would quote the scripture jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you say now i've said it let it be done it is written to be spoken and i have spoken let it be done the word is written to be spoken this operation of the word spoken power is all made possible because of the blood cleansing cleansing us from the sin of adam this lamb was a slain lamb but it was also a resurrected lamb and indeed he paid for the souls redemption at calvary once and for all he resurrected and ascended but in the last day he advances to take the title of inheritance that he has paid for amen he paid for you at calvary but now he claims your inheritance in this last day amen listen he's about to do it friends the dead and christ have had their sins forgiven how many believes that those that are dead in christ have had their sins forgiven they've weighed in that great holding place of paradise amen they are at rest but they still long they are still longing to come back to earth and exchange their theophany bodies for glorified ones so they can join the living at the marriage supper of the lamb think of that and in the last days the lamb advances forth in revelation to release to the church the lost inheritance containing the word and his power that was lost in the first age and brother branham called he refers to this as the bleach now we're getting into the power amen we see the intercessor we see what he did is his work we see he was a man we see he he goes forward to take the book of title but i want you to understand a little bit of the power of his blood because you see this work in revelation 5 is advancing the power of the blood the power of the kinsman redeemer to go beyond just the redeeming of our souls i mean we ought to be happy with the redeeming of our souls when we die we don't go to hell amen we go into a place of rest when we commit our loved one into the ground we can all rejoice in a way and say oh wonderful they're in a place of the beloved in the place of rest but oh church that is not all of christianity that is not our only promise but there is a greater promise than that and that is that the lost inheritance of our immortality will return to a people in this last decade and i want you to know that there's an anointing that has come down that is issuing that revelation that mystery to a church but it's not going to be just the mystery but the power of it because it'll quicken your mortal body brother branham explained it this way the bleach and he would tell what the power of the blood would do he said it's like a clorox and he said you take your a drop of ink put it into a tub of clorox and he said the coloring of that ink it begins to spin around in that that clorox the first thing that it does when it hits the clorox the chemical of that is more powerful than the ink and it begins to change it until you can't even see even a vapor of that of that ink left amen it's gone it all becomes a part of the bleach and that's exactly how the blood of jesus christ does to sin the blood of jesus amen you confess your sins upon the blood of jesus and and it emits it puts in the sea of forgiveness it puts it in the in the container bleach and it's never to be remembered again about so where is the church today brother branham asked brethren if we're born to be sons of god where do we stand he's trying to tell us we're sinless has no claim on us we're sons of god we're recognized as sons amen jesus said and this is the way he where he told us what we're standing he said jesus himself said if your own law said you're god's amateur gods would control the earth he caught he said if he called those gods who the word of god came to which was the prophets the word the lord comes to the prophet you call them gods how could you condemn me when i'm say i'm the son of god what is the bleach done there it's returned of men and women back to the state of godship again [Music] amen your own race you're no more of it you're of a new race hallelujah and you're born now of the birth of the blood of god hallelujah you're not anymore your own you're not just human anymore you are born again son or daughter of god with a claim on immortality and a deposit within you that your body is going to change that will match the soul within you think of that god's offsprings of himself sons of god under the blood born of the blood would you get the thought you know sometimes we look at songs like you know oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king his royal blood now flows in my vein of course that's nonsense if he's talking about your flesh of course that's nonsense if you're talking about the human blood of jesus but that's not that that's not what we're saved by we're saved by the blood of god not human blood it was god's blood that was shed how did he get that blood you see he was full of human blood well he wasn't mary he wasn't joseph so what human gave him the blood amen he was of the blood cell by creation by the word the spoken word the original seed of there at calvary the blood cell broke open and released the life of it and it came back on the day of pentecost and what you were seeing there come down on the day of pentecost was the life that was in the blood amen the spirit that was in the blood the blood came down on the day of pentecost and when they were filled with the spirit that were born of the blood of god amen the bible tells you this in john chapter 1 he said who was born not of the will of flesh but of god is that right this is it it's not a rebirth by the will of flesh it is it is born the way you should have been at the beginning and it ain't flowing through the veins through these these veins of this body it's flowing through the veins of your of your by the holy spirit of your soul and it reaches out and it brings your whole body under control of the holy spirit oh i'm talking about a blessed thing friend that we are men and women born of the blood of god that god is our father if the blood of bulls and goats now could give the power to moses to go out there by commission of god and stay and stretch forth that rod and say let there come flies then how much more can sons that are born of the blood of god moses wasn't but you are come on church moses was a fallen son but you're not you are a redeemed son i'm talking about where you are standing i'm talking about the power of this blood it didn't just cleanse your sins and remove them from it it changed your nature and put in you a new nature with a new life american that holy spirit is the blood of god inside of you and you were born of the blood of god amen your kin folks this is why he can take you for a pride because he must get a woman of his kin folks someone that is born of him has the same life the same lifeblood amen was showing that if the blood of bulls and goats brother branham would use this for example he said if it's just a type it's just a type and the blood of bulls and goats could so cleanse a man and temporarily put on a man that he he would lift later and he would go out and do other things but but it would put a man on speak in terms what can the blood of the real lamb do and he would say what's the matter with the church today there's something wrong and he said my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity to the right thing for that where god could do that by the blood of bulls and goats and that only covered sin and made a perpetuation for the sinner but the sin was still there only covered over what can he do to the blood of his son that amidst sin you see this is way beyond the little nice slogans that's right you know that i'm justified just as if i'd never done it because you know you did it amen this is way beyond just as if i'd have never done it because you did it but this justification justifies you because it's not looking at your human birth and your human past [Applause] it's not taking an account your life as a human it is taking an account the birth of a son of god and you cannot attribute sin to a son of god [Applause] because he that's born of god cannot commit sin for the seed of god remains in him amen and it isn't just as if i'd never done it it is i never did it in the first place therefore i stand redeemed therefore i stand sinless therefore i because of a new birth and the old man is dead amen the man you talking about devil i ain't him no more i don't know who you're looking for but that man's dead and i'm a new creature in christ jesus and this one never did it in the first place there's never nothing in the memory of god that could ever come up and say oh oh he did this he did that and that's why i can't honor his word but god says uh-uh i can put in him the power of creation because he's my son and sons come back to the place of eating the book and prophesying again as they prophesied on the day of pentecost but he said what's the matter we're not coming with sincerity we're not realizing we're not comprehended we're not we're we're not realizing the power of where we have been placed you see this puts us back in authority as adam in the beginning operating as sons with full authority brother branham would go on and out in the message of god hiding himself in simplicity you ought to go listen to it everybody ought to make that your homework this week the one in albuquerque brother branham speaks it says in mark 11 24 whatever you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said where is the pentecostal church at today amen you don't realize that confess truly uh confessed sins amid sin there's no omit to it and he said it builds a bridge that takes man back in the presence of his creator and makes him a son of god amen and then he talks about the chasm is completely gone there's not even remembrance that there ever was a chasm god don't ever remember that you were ever strained from him because he wasn't you were always his son [Applause] and this son that he had in his mind was his bone he was born of the spirit he was born in god's blood and the devil has no claim on him [Applause] i'm talking to a people today that ought to be able to look at it and say the devil has no claim of me amen whatsoever he has no claim god taking a humble sinner and cleansing him by his blood and dropping that confessed sin into that clorox bleach of the blood of the son of god and putting his own life in him into that man by the baptism of the holy ghost then we have the genuine baptism of the holy ghost what's wrong with us amen when the tithe when elijah dropped the robe for elisha he got a double portion of it and jesus said the works that i do you shall do also and greater than this how you do for i go to my father what's wrong church now he said you called us a belt above the visions and things like that get off my back brother get down to the cross get to the gospel we don't have to impersonate why would you take an impersonation why would you take a false conception of it when the the skies are full of the genuine pentecost of power that makes a man or woman a son or daughter of god that takes him back in the presence of god amen there you are god repealing himself in humility but you've got to get away from your own thoughts you've got to let the mind that was in christ be in you you've got to stay there till every sin of fear and doubt is gone from your heart and if you're there and god doesn't take you and amid your sins and send you in the presence of god there's something wrong with your experience he said i don't care how many degrees of doctor bear with me as i share this i don't care how many degrees of doctors you have how many big church you are what kind of a big wheel you belong to how many organizations whatever it is it has nothing to do with it until your sins are confessed and in the blood of jesus christ you stand an unadulterated a born again son or daughter of god with the life of god in you to speak a word of creation let this mountain be moved and it will mind you i'm telling you that's where we're standing you're looking out here and you're seeing a new election you see or you're having even doubts about this election you're wondering if it will even hold up in court or whether how crook it will be and what the next regime will be like you're wondering about the kobet and what's going on and the trouble in the land and china and the russia and all the other threats but do you realize where you're standing that's where the world is standing but where are you standing you're standing in the in the blood of the power of this restoration worst restore the people back on speaking terms again amen will you say let this mountain be moved and it's done amen oh my brother branham said this he said this in continuation and i just want to get a view of this quotation we'll bring it to close so what did he do he humbled himself to death on good friday afternoon that he might rise on the eastern sunday to send back the holy spirit upon the church with a double portion of it that he might do the same things that he did that we might do the same things that he did he promised these signs shall follow them that believe oh and how far we get away from him by our traditions there you are god hiding himself in some in humility revealing himself in power that's the way god does it that's god's program of doing it yes sir that he might bring many sons across the council oh now notice he said he said if you cross the chasm until you know pause if you're standing in the presence of god a redeemed son and a daughter of god and the signs and wonders not of make-believe but the genuine article of god the holy spirit burns within you and what you say to this mountain it moves you believe that if it doesn't he says now is your time he said if you say i'm really hungry for god you'll keep on standing till it comes there's no end to it you're persistent like the symphonies and woman she couldn't take no she really wanted it amen and then this prayer he said lord jesus in the way of humility and the way of humbleness i offer to you this congregation that's on their feet i offer them to you because they have stood in response to the call they're seeking a deeper things they're seeking more life after hearing the blood of jesus so thoroughly cleanses us that there's no more nothing that the complete word of god rests within them that the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the holy ghost and this holy ghost is a creator he makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes god in action here we are we come down to the journey of the last seven ages we returned right again to where adam was to where the first church was we stand here right in the place of restoration restoration wasn't friends just to pull you out of denominations and bring you into a church called yourself message restoration was to bring you back into sonship to restore you back to place of authority again where that you who know your god does exploits because we are standing on the precipice of of where we can't go any other way but up listen you're surrounded you're like the children of israel you're standing there and there's no way to go i mean mountains on this side mountains on that side the enemy coming behind you and nowhere to go except forward and you know it's a precipice or it's a it's a it's a it's a sea then you've gotta that has walled you off and you know you're right there and you're standing there and you're looking at it and you see what's coming in and you see there's no way of escape and we have reached the point that there is no way of escape we're cut off from every side we're cut off from all the all from every hope of salvation you can't you can't depend on your election processes you can't depend on some medicine that'll come along you can't depend on anything there's somebody with me you're here and you're forced into a place amen and the people of god are beginning to cry and say oh god why is this and how come that and lord since the fathers have fallen asleep and the prophet is gone all things remain as it was from the beginning and god is saying i had not showed you over and over again haven't i showed you the power in my word didn't it make the cripples walk didn't it make them lame to walk the blind to see the depth to hear not just one occasion come on church amen then i'm showing yourself myself alive among you amen there's healing of cancer there's healing the brain bleeds crippled children are walking things are happening the death is hearing amen things are beginning to happen in the church why are you crying to me speak and go powered amen it's not the end it's the beginning it is not the end it's the continuation it is not the end it's a bride going home time and we'll come back to the place where church lost his first love and there's a people that's got their first love back they've left everything to follow him and they want him more than anything the blood and his power restoration we're here right on the brink can i just go back just for a moment and i want to just bring out just a couple little quotes as we come to the close i want to just read just a couple of little things that are very powerful creative work brother branham said that belongs in the church of jesus christ today under the blood of jesus christ by his word that we're in contact with him creative work belongs god showed him that we are there as he quotes if you say to this mountain he said then it isn't i speak anymore it's deity speaking and he says i truly believe that the church is on the brink of one of the greatest outpourings that's ever had in this age i believe i can't say the lord has told me but it's just something inside me that's just catching hold of something that i haven't seen all my life till just now and how glorious it is to know that just before they come to the lord that these things are happening and as he closes out his ministry he stands and he says this and then knoweth it not one of the last sermons preached in jeffersonville to his home church i'm only building a lot of people have come to conclusion that brother branham was the end of this that he was exactly what god wanted and was thinking and that's all it is but brother branham said i'm only building the hour is close at hand when you're going to see something happen when something's going to take place and all of this background here he calls everything in the past background amen oh that would be blasphemous to many in many messy circles say that was the background and all this background here has only been laying a foundation for a short quick message that will shake the whole nations the bride must prophesy [Music] again we've been eating the book a long time it's time to let the spirit fall and as it falls so anointed people not in human ways but he come out of there quickened speaking the word changing things we're on the edge very soon and let me tell you i can bring you the quotes to show you but brother branham is clear that this living bride will call the resurrection and i don't think it'll be me and you out there at a graveyard screaming and crying i think it'll be when our lives are shouting out the wondrous works of god that soon the dead in christ will just walk in among us walk right down these aisles come right to you wherever you are in the house and you'll know when you see them you're being changed from mortal to immortality because this blood has that power of restoration let's fire heads together the musicians come this morning but you look at it just a moment it's got a power restoration for you my center friend you can come to jesus you don't have to come to an angry god who's been offended let me tell you something your life offends him it offends him it offends him when our women or women put on garments that pertain to man or men dressed like effeminate like women it offends them when we want to be like the world and and so forth the world rather than the cleanliness and the purity of god it offends him when we won't stand for truth and righteousness this god is offended but there is a compassionate lord oh yeah he's the same god but he became a man so that you'd have an approach your offense that has offended him that has alienated you that you'd have an approach to him and he says to you come to me come to me that you that are heavy laden i will give you rest there's rest come to me i'll take your burden i'll take the burden of sin i'll set you free i'll make you a son or daughter of god come to me he that comes to me i will in no wise cast them out come to me my yoke is easy my burden's light why wouldn't you want to come to him when a king walked among us when he bore our shame when he paid the price redemption when he gave water to those that were weary food to those that were hungry why wouldn't we want to come to him why would we wait is there a pull in your heart that that name that's on the book that mystery there in the book is calling your name and you hear a call and it's moving you saying come unto me come unto me [Music] i'll make your burdens easy i'll take them i'll bear your shame your reproach i'm taking a wipe away every sin stain that's in your life make you free come to me come to jesus the compassionate one that looks down on the blindness of your heart the compassionate one that looks at you as a sinner whose life says i'm unclean i'm unclean the compassionate one saying i will be thou clean lord jesus you see where we're standing lord i somehow don't have words eloquent enough to say it somehow another i don't have the vocabulary to bring it somehow lord maybe somebody else could do it in in a way that it could be grasped and we come to sincerity what about men and women today when brother branham was told the very same thing in order to bind this serpent you've got to be more sincere and he would even say to us what's wrong with your church where are you standing what's wrong with the church anyhow if you have the baptism of the holy ghost and the blood has cleansed cleansing we're not coming in the sincerity of the thing i pray lord you'll help us to realize where we're at in time as it blends into eternity knowing lord we're here on the precedent of a great a great message that comes forth from the bride as he prophesies again i ask it in jesus name we just come among your people today walk among us wipe away every sin stain as we baptize this young brother today lord may you baptize him with the holy ghost as we come in obedience to the word cleanse us from every sin lord we pray in jesus name thank you lord that we don't have to walk after the deeds of the flesh thank you lord that this is not a reformation but a transformation thank you lord that we have a power within us that give us power because of the blood i ask it in jesus name your blessings on your people in jesus name amen [Music] hallelujah jesus is calling what about you calling for you what about a call to the church to become more sincere more dedicated more consecrated more realized what about it what we so often just gloss over these scriptures and still come to realize where we're at oh he called you now to a greater life [Music] of what the blood can do can i restore you back to where the church fell from it would be a continuation can't we be a dedicated church that's [Music] sapphire church where sin is [Music] is [Music] and why should we tarry when jesus [Music] [Music] mercy for you [Music] seem to get come home [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] to [Music] [Music] the

his [Music] has blood me with his power he has raised [Music] your name [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] the reason [Music] amen i have brother zachary coleman that has come to be baptized today in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ and it's a great privilege that when we have a young person to want to come to the lord to be able to baptize him in the name of jesus christ and this is this is his 14th birthday and i tell you there's no greater gift than eternal life amen and we thank god for that and for that promise that is given to us to our children to them that are far off and even as many as the lord our god shall call little brother zachary take your hands here you know the lord jesus has sent us into the world to herald his gospel this end time and we just pray in the name of jesus that as we will baptize you today in water that the holy spirit will go with you that he will dwell inside of you that you'll be a heart that is surrendered to god and a vessel chosen by the lord to serve him from this day on and the lord jesus sent me to preach the gospel to to baptize those that believe to baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and that's why according to that divine commandment we want to be obedient today and in doing so we baptize you now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord when i am weak i call on the lord and he hears me yes he helps me [Music] oh he's my companion my best friend the only true god there's no one great amen let's just stand and worship him before we go we'll say you're the lion
