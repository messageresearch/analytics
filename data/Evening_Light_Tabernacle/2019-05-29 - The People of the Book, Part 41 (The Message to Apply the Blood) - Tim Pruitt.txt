children of the king today and we come together in your name to love you to serve you a mind to declare your saving to deliver and we're here tonight as a children of the king the cast Satan out amenda take dominion over every evil spirit they were trying to hold God's people here's a letdown in the name of Jesus we asked your blessings upon us tonight as we worship you and give you praise and honor and glory amen and amen god bless you amen oh my what a what a word in that song tonight amen Exodus chapter 12 verse 13 Exodus chapter 12 verse 13 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and then first Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 11 now all these things happened unto them for an examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come do you believe we're here amen god bless you you can be seated tonight I'm going to be speaking on you them to them on the message to apply the blood we spoke Sunday on a service and I wanted to come tonight and speak again as I won't be here Sunday I'm going to brother Jason Jackson's meet with brother Ron Spencer there for meetings there this weekend so I would appreciate your prayers but I spoke Sunday upon the message of the Exodus and I feel like it was probably one of the most important sermons that I would preach this year but I think every sermon that we hear is important it's vital for us to take a hold of the Bible said lay hold of eternal life and it's really important that when the word comes forth that you take hold of it no matter who is speaking but I'm reminded of some things and I I don't want to spend a lot of background tonight we his wins tonight we want to get right into the word but I will just tell you right up front that I have a lot to say tonight and so I will try to be cognitive time but at the same time I hope you understand also that I I have to obey the Holy Spirit and in the message the token brother branham's said that now we're living in the shadows and the wrath is ready to strike and God is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost it is the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ return back to the believer and so as we were speaking Sunday that just before he preaches a sermon on the token that the Holy Ghost is a requirement for the rapture brother Branham is recognizing that so many of his followers on the church members that they're without the Holy Ghost there's something I have evidently missing in their lives and this realization is what prompts him to preach on the token now this wasn't meant to be a sermon of condemnation but rather to identify the lack so that the problem of sin and unbelief could be healed and God's people delivered and I just want to also add to you tonight that my preaching is not to condemn anybody and you know we're we're not we're not out to dam you but rather to see you delivery and the Prophet was bothered that even after the supernatural revelation of where night after night the angel of the Lord came bringing the voice of the thunders the people although they intellectually heard and understood the seals they were still missing the life are the token that that literal life of Christ and I just like to share with you some scripture here for a moment as we go to first Corinthians 13:1 though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing so as we look at here Paul is really looking at both sides of the spectrum that you know as the pendulum swings one way or the other and and he could say Noel you know all the gifts of prophecy or the tongues of men and angels are you know though I have all faith that I could move mountains and have not charity I am nothing but then he also covers the other side of the spectrum and he says though I understand all mysteries and all knowledge and have not charity now charity of course is the basic nature of God because God is love when brother Abraham went beyond the curtain of time he was told this is what you preached was perfect love this is the Holy Ghost so we know then the Holy Ghost truly is the very nature of God which love is his basic nature and of course in verse John 4:16 he says and we we have known and believed that love that God has to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him so you cannot be a Christian and not have the love of God it is the nature of God to love perfect love it is the Holy Ghost so we can just say that and the same thing if we have not charity or have not the Holy Spirit we're just sounding brass and tinkling cymbal without the Holy Ghost and all the knowledge you know that we have paid to move mountains no matter which side of the pendulum that it swings when it goes to the intellect or to the emotional or to the signs and wonders it matters not you must have the nature of God and this is the whole thing that we must realize because you can manifest many things and yet lack the basic element of God's own nature now the blood as we showed and you can look at the illustration here that if it was must strike the two side post and the lentil and the blood from the lamb was used to strike I want to just emphasize that word strike not likely or to gently paint but but it was more than that it was to strike a mind to strike the both the sides of the doorposts and the lintel now it would not be struck on the threshold of the floor because you see the the Jews were to pass through the blood and under the blood but no one is to trample the blood of the lamb underfoot so it is not on the threshold a man to be trampled underfoot we must be really careful not to trample the blood Amen but to hold it in great esteem and realizing it's our life now the blood of course there is the Holy Spirit and it must be applied to every entrance and I want to emphasize every entrance of in your house the body the spirit or the soul now brother Branham would tell us in modern events made clear by prophecy he said there's many people just can't believe it even spirit-filled people I'm gonna give you one that a Chokin the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're goin in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul that's the baptisms he hears the inside soul in here that has to come from God but on the outside you can have five senses and out and inlets and to contact your home and the inland side you have a spirit and then there then there you have five outlets your conscience and love and so forth the five outlets to that spirit but remember in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine Spirit of God and still be lost it is the soul that lives that was ordained of God now so of course you know again this is very important for us to focus upon remember we want more than the Holy Spirit of on our flesh and more than in upon our spirit round but we want it within the soul and man deep within the soul with and and it'll only take effect if it has a seed gene of God on the inside otherwise no matter how much it falls upon it the ring can fall but it will only manifest what seeds on the inside now but because of the lack of this revelation of Christ personally to you this is why today we have so many divisions around the message and this is why the tangents there and the tangent is system different line of thought than what the messenger had and it's deception that comes through wisdom but I want you to understand the Holy Ghost don't come through wisdom the Holy Ghost doesn't come through intellectual knowledge the Holy Ghost comes by a personal experience and encounter with God that's how the Holy Ghost comes now so the reason of the divisions and and you know and this is as I said the reason of the divisions and and of course you know the real mystery of Christ coming in Bride form is summer halogen can see you know he's here he's here Brother Jimmy's he's here in Brides form but they don't know how he came that way he comes in bride form through the new birth they might not through the wisdom of man not by the imparting of knowledge but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's exactly how he is here and bride for a man now in Christ's of mystery brother Brennan said God holds us Kizer alone no theologian can tell you it is not known it's hid from them they know nothing about it so the skills when you say I got a pH ll DS you only make to me and I believe to God and to any true believer that means you're just that much further away you just backed off God is not known by education he is not known about how to explain it Amen God is known by simplicity and a revelation of Jesus Christ to the mouse a literate person a man not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ upon Disrupt I build my church no other rocks except that no other things accepted no other Roman rock no other Protestant rock no other school no nothing but exactly on the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new birth he is born in there he injects his own life and your life is gone hey man I'm the life of Christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminence to the people that they can see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you Amen outside of that the rest of it's not even called you at all what's God's great revelation unfolding by lack of this revelation listen to this prophet is why we have so many different divisions among us and summits Mochrie so much to be among us it's because people laugh that revelation see they laugh that revelation the teacher now what revelation no certainly not you know some my you know great exposition of the seals and great knowledge that the thunders and can tell us all about all of these different mystery that's not the knowledge that brother Brennan where the revelation brother bragging said they're lacking they're lacking the revelation of Christ personally to them they said they lack that revelation the teachers a man I tell you it's time to every teacher every preacher take stock Andrea and makes them make sure they have that revelation whether they understand anything else they know God this is what brother Brandon would say Betsy author and man you you know you make men know your Bible better than I do you maybe I'll be able to out our give me but I know the author and this is where every person has to got to come to my Gogi author and I do you understand this right you understand that right you have a great handle on this sir a great handle on this mystery here's some mystery you better know I'm out the mystery of Christ personally to you Paul after this great revelation of Christ said in first Corinthians a second chapter and had he said that I never came to you let's just look at it listen to the great Apostle Paul the intellectual sterlin Christ 1st Corinthians 2 1 and I brethren when I came to you I came not with excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God so that I never said I'm dr. so-and-so for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you and much in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and the power I say God give us some more poems hey Manuel you know where we have been we have been nightly inundated with wisdom of man ideas of man and creeds a man but give us some cause a man that my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration of the Spirit and the power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God that's where your faith has gonna stand not because I understand all of the mysteries but because I knew him and he changed me and I'm not what I lost a man and there's a hunger and a desire in my heart but more of that God too often the message has been preached with arrogance full of human reason and wisdom and pride and it produces fleshly proud arrogant people instead of the humility of the lamb now this is what brother Breton would say in Christ some mystery notice in the last days Luther is doing the same thing he to see if the devil doing the same thing building up a hybrid church a hybrid by hybrid members hybrid by knowledge instead of the word by intellect some men instead of born again man building an intellectual kingdom that will outshine Christ a little-bitty flock see what's the water is it that did that fallen angels the Bible said ulis fallen angels who listened to Lucifer instead of Christ who that once belonged to is that right Mansa brother madam tells us this is what the devil's this is what he'll be doing in this last day trying to hide the church by knowledge a man building an intellectual kingdom Amen that will outshine Christ little bitty flop oh my fallen angels we'll get into it now but notice here's the key that nature of Christ is missing the lamb isn't that now this is a problem with all this intellectual learning the lamb is in think the blood isn't there imagine it I just want you to look what brother Branham just plain love kindness humility that right never such a humble man didn't puff him up didn't make him proud they'd become arrogant come a man you see the characteristics we witness too often in the ministry is heady highminded this arrogance that's a spiritual sick person brother man told us an image --is of christ he said remember is only the sick that that man's attention service just a sick they demand attention and when you see a preacher and he's mayor not limited to a preacher but may I limit to every person every church member that wants attention I'm somebody just remember there's of spiritual sick person there needing attention there need the attention of the Spirit of God that it can't give them something that will take that attitude out of them and heal them from their selfishness big ideas and big me and little you the Holy Ghost makes us all the same a man too much spiritual sickness an image you know what anemic is if somebody had got any blood they walked funny their top see the tip see top see all over the time and that's what's the matter with many of our church members today they are anemic they need a blood transfusion Calgary that a give them rich royal blood that a make them walk in the old-fashioned Holy Ghost to that way of God that give them something to live for give them a confidence that'll make them walk in the image of their Lord but you know again you know all of a sudden because of our superior knowledge we've been weird the bride's you know the elite the elect and God God just loves to dam other people you know the rest of you that are just too stupid to get our superior knowledge and understanding God loves to damn you what in the world why why are these kind of attitudes coming out today because of the lack of a new birth because the problem of promoting a superior knowledge which came from Satan it didn't come from God the spirit of God hey man now let me just say something to you let's get it clear revelation is not knowledge revelation is not knowledge brother Branham said to Lucifer attention exalts himself above the humble Word of God by the knowledge of the revelation and he has placed himself by seminary education and theology until they got themselves up and if you don't belong in their group then you're out wash hmm you see Revelation is not knowledge revelation is a supernatural happening and that you may not know even how to explain it you just know you got it that's what revelation is I mean knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth that right hey man you know that the knowledge city is puffing up today is we're now the mercy seat goodness me let me tell you if grace and mercy is put in the hands of men then we're all lost except for those who will come down and worship at their feet a man but I'm glad that mercy doesn't lay in men let's see ladies in the mercy seat what Christ is the high priest a man the death angel will not be kept away by knowledge but by the life of the Lamb and his nature displayed now as I told you brother branham goes into the woods and he hunts but he can't even huddle thinking and and praying about the problems that he see he returns to the tabernacle and he preaches to them two sermons we spoke about that Sunday both sermons he telling him what was bothering him first sermon was a question how can I overcome his next sermon is the answer the token you must have the token the Holy Ghost that's the only way you'll overcome and then he begins to explain this was needed to follow the seals and I'm just going to tell you friends we need something to follow the seals and mint vocals we've had about 40 years of theology preached around the message it's time that we find out what was to follow the seal hey man after the token message he preaches a sermon desperation and that evening he refers back to his morning sermon on the token and he refers it as a capping off time now he said this morning revert to the otoki in' he where he where he gives us a message the message is to pry the token get to Holy Ghost in other words the message this morning would to me was a highlights message of my entire ministry this is our important to see highlight of my entire ministry a highlight message of my entire ministry Sunday I'll tell you how it come about and I know that everything is worked for months and months and months up to that one message moving up to come to that place this was the Capon of time other men you see and any again he says I believe with all the messages that I ever brought that absolute was ordained of God outside of Courts irregular Commission like the seven seals and things that was directly the Word of God but I'm talking about a message to preach I believe that it was see the one needed to follow the seven seals a man now what comes after the seven seals what's what come after the seven seals you're 19 other people United science red flashing light it in the last day sign of women getting prettier men what they would do all these signs of the Holy Spirit leading up and then come right back here to the capping off of all of those messages since the seven seals it's kept often this one thing the token that we're dead that we are all right she just check ourselves and see that we're in the pain hey man check yourself make sure you're in the faith a man this was an exodus hour and this is the one that's needed to follow the seals and the token message brother branham on this it was a message that God ordered brother branham can you imagine this is not william branham stops he's out in the woods and God orders him I mean just like God ordered Moses tell him take a lamb without blemish and told him the whole process of it what to do it was God's orders not Moses message it was God's message and God was lived was given a message to this endtime people and he said land allows a message on the requirement of the Holy Ghost so and you must be under the atonement of the blood and that not only must you have it it must be applied hey man now we live in the Indus and the wrath is about to strike and I'm reading this quote again on purpose God is requiring a token that you yourself have received this token the Holy Ghost and it's the only way in the only sign that God will ever pass because it is a little life of Jesus Christ return back to the believer so this is the time of action I mean believes when I our vats and when we're to be the book of Acts church where the life of Christ the Holy Ghost is an action living out of the people are you hear me yeah you know I get it the book of Acts had its troubles it has trials and those of Paul called folks brethren but that's not what's being restored we already had folks reading in troubles and trials and troubles in the church but what is restored is the acts of the Holy Spirit in the church that the Holy Ghost is an action in the people that's what the book of Acts is about the Holy Ghost in action in your everyday life and healing the sick and casting out Devils in every way the Holy Spirit in action on your job in your home in your marriage everywhere that you look the Holy Ghost is in action are you with me Amen that's what it is then that's what is being restored is the Holy Ghost in action remember it's not to access the Apostles is he acts of the Holy Spirit in the Apostles they're right so the church is to be Jesus Christ in action upon the earth and then because I live you sell him also and my life will be in you the works that I do say you do also the church has to get to that place a man and he said he promised he would do it and it will it's got to come that way hey man I believe that's what God's laying it on my heart so heavy a man we must be crushed an accent the Holy Spirit at work living in the people come on now hey man you don't know I'm not trying to get you to jump or dance or Honor speak in tongues although that wouldn't hurt any of you man I mean if I see if I see a demon take over a person and speak and and talk and say things what about the Holy Spirit get a hold of your tongue speak in another language hey man oh my dissing but it's the Holy Ghost in action that's what you saw was a hundred and twenty influenced whose last vessel still that lacks demonstrating Christ that they were have to say these men abetment Jesus hey man now how can I overcome brother branham talks about the church maybe should be taking a little step higher at this time and he said I want to bring to the church something that you should know and he's looking forward he's looking toward the token the token the Holy Ghost something more than believing the message now this is a step height then believe in the message it's the Holy Ghost and it's a higher step than just believe it have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe after they believe they were sealed with the Holy Spirit of prize are you with me now so now while brother Branham is hunting he's troubled about his church and he's seeing Christians in the church living a life that wasn't worthy of the gospel I'm not now now wait a minute he's he's told you some of the things he's preached he's preaching about the flashing red lights of the sign of his coming what's he preaching about I'm right or left and the open put my graffiti everywhere and the satanic influence and it's a flashing red light he's coming you know why cause it's the death angel a man that means the exodus is right here because of death angel his death calls coming in with unbridled lust and mind demonstrating itself with Hollywood through the women through the men and all these other spirits said it better dare come to a man fractured red light my man he said time to throw your whirling back of peanuts down and get on the train then I'll just tell you is just peanuts a man all of the world our sin all of them I did doesn't matter what it hears I'm just gonna say whatever you're putting there it's just peanuts sew it down get on the train make sure that the trains in the bomb the whistle is sounded the lights are flashing is about ready to take off now brother branham is seeing signs of Christian people I'm just going back over some of these that he's been preaching after the seals things that he sees the church needs though they got this superior revelation and intellectual learning are you in me and he sees seeing the signs of Christian people failing to live a life worthy of the gospel how many recognize the title hey man is your life worthy not is your wife worthy man better is your life worthy of the gospel a man and that people are turning down the opportunity to come to the marriage feast for frivolous things again a peanuts I'm an all of these excuses that they make now the seals that has been preached and I want to just say the thunders have worn out their voices we hear we a priest and can preach and will preach Oh my messages of the thunders of what the other that what was once symbols is now of us there's no more thunders they've they've been revealed Amanda there's no more an unknown voice the watch this book out no longer an unknown simple to simple is known the book is up back hey man so the seals have been preached the thunders roared out their voices the silence has been broken oh brother that that itself is shouting ground right there God holding mysteries to this last day and you're privy to it a man you you have been made to know exactly what it is the silence has been broken the mysteries has been revealed and he's asking the question is your life worthy of this gospel you've been invited to marriage feasts but those have been invited or not worthy think of that they're turning it down for menial little foolish foolish reasons I bought a yoke of up so I bought a line dyed my busyness of life come on he preaches another sermon asking another question and this question is do you care he cares do you care am i God has cared enough to bring us to this in time sent as a prophet provided token provide a way of escape he tears but he you can are you concerned the whole sermon is about the need of coming clean before God and the importance of a sincere confession than a dine out to sand in order in order to to receive what he cares to give you're gonna have to care enough somebody help me preach there he brings another sermon how can I overcome what's he doing he's seeing the condition of his church I just want to say I feel like we're part of his church they might not not just the denomination but Brandon tabernacle and the followers of his message how many identifies yourself as a follower of the message so he's asking how can I overcome me he see him that's things in the church and they not overcome and their things are not rising above listen time has marked his eyes he's marked my calendar HEC sent off one day after another Here I am now looked up to some by some as a senior preacher or elder in this message been preaching almost fifty years and the cries of pastors come to me as people leave the message deacons trustees some leaders people who a few years ago seemed solid in the faith and stood there for years live like pillars in the church but now rejecting the truth and living in sordid sinful conditions we sit in the prayer lines people confess in lust porn addiction grown men women young people you know with depression and fear anxiety suicide torn apart families Rek homes adulteries exposed and fornication discovered among the young people in pardon game addiction is led to demo possession and the sin of every kind that's coming to the church are you with me and then among the church are those who've never come over come with habits that can never learn the basics a man just watch your face just be clean let this token be shown on your body and your hair in your dress on your face come on now a man can never learn the basics of attending church paying ties just doing the basics but there's a difference and and lukewarmness how predestinated oh yeah we believe we're predestinated yes we do we believe God's going to pick us up in the rapture and clean us up without any effort or desire on our part cuz we're predestinated we'll be there that ain't predestination I'll tell you what if your predestinated you'll have a hunger for God and insatiable desire for the word I'm logging in your heart for God that really will show your predestination man it'll show in that even when you try to quit you can't quit [Applause] because your predestinated see slanted for garden loudly for god why did you do right there's a condition brother branham called Dodie it's not a word try to look it up in the dictionary yourself no DS not a word but he's referring to the word dote being extremely old and weak when a person gets their way they're too old or too weak to care this is why brother Brad was telling us and he cares do you care have you come to a place you don't care you're just son concerned and man it'll show in your prayer life it is showing your church attendance it'll show in your family it'll show in family devotion it'll show everywhere you don't care hey man now again I'm not condemning I'm just I'm just pointing out some sons some life hey man don't take everything on this on the medicine shelf tonight just take your portion are you with me I mean you your old timers ought to be saying yes brother Tim thank you for preaching all deaths man we want to see the Holy Spirit in our church you know young people in our life we want to see people who fight for God hey man he said I was crossing a lot the other day now he's out hunting this loud can overcome where he's studying I'm studying my people I'm crossing the log the other day over a curve was down a wash what's called a hollow I jumped on this old log and on the outside it looked good and it looked like a big old beach slaw but when I jumped on it or a great big piece of it fell off it was real rotten in duty and I said that's what we Christians are becoming now he's thinking of his church this is a way my church is becoming people in my church people have heard the seals people have seen the son of man that display yourself a man and I any said that's what we Christians are becoming they're dead in sin and trespasses so long till they become Dougy they can hold no weight at all they don't know what overcoming means and that's it people just live with their problems live with their addictions live with their temper come on I mean they they can't hold our way at all they can't don't know what overcoming means and I begin to think of this text overcome keep life in you overcome Keith like in you how am I gonna overcome keep the light keep the light don't lose the light hey man and he said when the light went out speaking of the tree that's what brought that log into that condition and it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was a branch is a creek and he says it made it worse than ever it is laying in the branch or the water he's seeing he's seen life is going out of the church's life is going out of the homes oh you know you'd be screaming amen if I was calling denominational names hey man if I was saying Baptist life is one out of their churches very bad brother damn that's right man the Methodist life has went out of them that's why there's gay marriages and gay haters but gays and I prepare some of every kind a man in the leadership of churches to whether falling away in that back inch and and worse than ever are you with me life is going either churches and the homes and individuals and it causes the wetness of Treach members dead in sins and tress Bassets a mountain and he said and when you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian and let the life of God go from him the experience oh the experience let the life the experience the joy of serving Christ and a living in a church for sex is going on here ah Tain's twice as quick right living right under so if we're trying to follow the message of the hour man is is he here he's talking to us now if we're trying to follow the message of the hour we should live constantly in the life of Christ because if you don't you lay around and you know that these things are supposed to do and don't do it the Bible said he that North to do good and do it to not to him it is sin and you just become Doody and rotten when you're separated from the life of God so strive strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of Christ that you'd be preparing I don't want to be one he finds a fig tree who has no fruit they get cursed man I want to be one that he finds life in frilled in the Holy Ghost moving in that the way you feel tonight and there's a follower the message we must strive with everything within us keep that life man in the church we want to keep that life we don't want to lose the spirit we're gonna lose the anointing man we don't want to lose the Welkin move that welcomed me not the Holy Ghost now to be an overcomer of course you've got to be two you've got to have something overcome and we're here in Laodicea you surely got things to overcome lukewarmness is one of the big ones complacency and not caring indifference it's a grandest of all Church ages but yet you know because it is the ending of time and the blending of eternity but it's also also the greatest sinful age it's a great age the seventh angel preached in this age man the message came in this age a man to live to see an age receive red lights until seven he received Lu 1730 Malachi 4:5 I my revelation 6 in the open and other seals it was all done right here in this way o to CMAs so it's a grand age because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity we're getting ready for an exodus somebody with me but he said yet it's the greatest sinful age more sin in this age than ever is been and the powers of Satan many times harder to fight against and it was in any other age in that truth don't we find that with our young people it's even harder in their generation than it was our generation but ever ever ever generation that passes by gets wicked or an even more evil and Satan comes with another device another way to fight his way out the only thing going to keep him out is the Holy Ghost otherwise that things who will pay the way in and he'll be using your body and speaking through your life using your tongue dwelling in your body and you're either gonna be the temple of the Holy Ghost you're gonna become the the body Satan dwells in because there's two markings going on a marking of God the seal of the Holy Ghost or the marking of the Beast so you think I'll brother to him listen when I see message girls that can just brazenly put on I believe in pro-choice sub women's rights you know what that's an anointing of the depth that's a demon possession that possess their thoughts gotta hold in their life man we we can't believe in women's rights to kill their babies they have a right and they have a choice and that choice was when they got conceived when they when they made that wrong move that was the choice man now now then it's not a choice it's a life look like that would be easy to understand don't it come on look like it'd be easy to understand on it but of course then she believes is pressing upon in every way that you can imagine listen back there in the early ages a Christian for the profession however in a church belonging to Christ could be beheaded or killed put out of his misery go to meet God quickly but the enemy has come in in the name of the church and it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception when Christ said so the two spirits would be so close in the last day till he to see the very elected if it was possible remember Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day and it would deceive the very elect it if it were possible so close and the people Oh hear me now hear what brother Brandon Sampson how can over the people live they can live a clean holy life not be sinful adulterers drinkers liars gamblers they can live above that and still not with it because you can be anti-abortion and anti you know perversion and hand-tied oh I believe the word either that's it and me you know you can even come to church and you miss that life this is a age he said of the personal life this is what's required personal life of Christ now you see we've come down through justification sanctification baptisms and anointings of his spirit but this is the age of the personal life the Passover requires not simply us accepting the lamp nor just holding its blood in the basin nor waving our high CIPA or hyssop of faith but it said but they're plying of the blood to all three places of entrance the body the spirit and the soul another sermon brother branham preaches is the indictment and the indictment is a sermon about the rejection of Christ and the refusal to come under the blood and anybody who denies the blood man the intercessory of Christ is under the indictment in the nightma brother Brennan said why did they say all men should worship at Jerusalem but there's only one place that God will fellowship with man and that's under the blood of the sacrifice and the blood of the sacrifice today is the Holy Ghost all in one place he will mean Oh one thing that we have in common the holy ghost hey man God will never meet with man nowhere else but under the bud under the Holy Ghost when you turn down the blood down when your tongue the Holy Ghost down your meeting place with God has been taken away God made his first decision and the Garden of Eden that man will worship Him are under only worship Him under the blood of the sacrifice and that's the only place that God met with man then and it's the only place that God ever did meet with man and that's the only place he meets this man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice a man see I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian if you know if you can and let me just add in their message believers if you can just forget your differences Roman Catholic whatever it might be come under the shed blood God will meet both of us there that's where we can all meet and fellowship on the same grounds but otherwise he will not meet you because you're Methodists he will not meet you just because you're Pentecostal could I add in there he will not meet you just cause you go to message Church he will meet you under one condition that's under the shed blood what your sins of men confess and expound in his presence by the blood and the blood is always before and therefore he can only see you through that set blood and you're white as snow see you confess your sin otherwise you're not there you can't fellowship and that's the reason you don't see things happening in the churches they confess they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word oh now we just have an intellectual jump off boards Easter it's the word brother Jim that's the plan to get to the blood is the word we got out the the word the word I'll get to that in a minute we'll find out what word hey man there's only way God will honor that word you'll never honor that wouldn't come sama Roman Catholic I'll demand this to be done you can't do it Methodist Baptist Pentecostal you can't do it now and then just let me see we're in a church where we see things happening hallelujah amen we see the miraculous taking place healings miracles Devils cast out a man even when people are saying that's casting out Devils are you with me a man and then we see it happen but we want to see it happen how they would say that the season I'm happy then it's happening I want to see I want to see that book of Acts the Holy Spirit [Applause] just in the preachers but in I saw brother Branham says this in perfect faith this is another sermon preached after the seers seals that the token message caps off perfect faith you wonder how you're going to have perfect faith same way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost that gives you a perfect faith that perfects your faith that's where your faith has been made perfect man you believe you God you believe he was your Savior you believe it you believed in the Holy Ghost but where your faith is made perfect is when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that makes your faith believe in God is Savior perfect now faith is for based on forgiveness then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place where we can really see apostolic times moving among us here so the purpose for all of these messages just get the church to the place to see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door and I want to say where that man went right at that door are you with me man we see it he said probably want to see more of it we wanted such a flow than it would be I help to us us to flow out to others but you know today that's why some churches can plot along for years and years and years without a convert yeah without a convert no so Saint let succinctly you know why the bloody thing you think I'm joking but there's no I'll I just tell you know there are churches that are out there that have sat there for 40 years and not had one person saved except they married somebody in the church and then they got baptized is that a book of Acts Church then casting out Devils come on now brother bragging said that's why that's the reason you don't see things happening in the churches they confessed they believe the blood but they reject the very plan that give to the blood the work now the blood is the Holy Ghost a man they confess they believe in the Holy Ghost but they reject the very plan that get to the blood the Holy Ghost so my with me now so what is the word that is the plan to get to the blood acts 2:38 oh man that's the word needed to get to the blood for the blood is the baptism of the Holy Ghost repent from your sins oh brother Jim pray for me get out that I'll try I'm a dad to Sam I'll do your death the bacons dad through your ideas are dead dear sons are dead and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the plan to get to the blood it's just that simple the word now personal experience with God brother Brendan said that's what the church needs tonight is just stop studying so much theology and get down to the altar and pray until a personal experience burns down into the human heart and burns out all the dullness and gives a new vision hey man an indictment you must come under the blood you must come under the Holy Ghost it's the place - the only place that God will meet is under that Holy Spirit of God that's the only place hey man but Holy Ghost blood Holy Ghost you get it hey man what'd we say you know the blood of Christ we're talking about the Spirit of Christ the life of the blood I'm talking about the the fluid that fell down from his favorite um about the life that came out of him the Holy Spirit when you're born of that when you're bored of that Holy Spirit you're born of the blood a man your child you come up to him you're as possession a mad that's why many times you know when dealing with people and especially sometimes even those that are demon possesses it accept Christ take him into your heart right now ask him to come sit on that throne cuz we can get Jesus on the throne he did then you become his property and then he fights for you then the battles over when he goes to fight for you remember his property man you get the Holy Ghost you're his property [Applause] [Music] [Applause] nobody better lay hands on this property devil get back death angel move back hey man you must come under the blood and indictment he said the only way you can do that it's come under the mercies of God Oh what are we doing now and there's no more mercy you've got to come under the mercies of God through His grace is to come through this shed blood of Jesus Christ saying Lord I claim the promise and then if you're really under that blood God is obligated to that word hey man first you've got to be under that blood you see it now no wonder they can't believe in miracles no wonder you can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they condemned it the same reason they condemned it back there is the same reason they can dim it today they're guilty as guilty can be because it's under only under the said blood and those who would dare some little brother who dares under humility to take God in His Word and walk out there confess his sin forget all these dumpers and things instead they're under the blood and believe it they want to call him a fanatic a man they want to class him as we would say it's not a good word to use in the pulpit but if so you'll understand he's an oddball notice we find that only under the blood that God will meet a worshiper so the meta Jerusalem and Christ is God's provided Lamb of sacrifice and today there's only one place God will meet man and that's under this shed of blood under the blood of Jesus Christ anywhere else it is condemned God will never here and ma'am he said you can do all kinds of emotions see on that spirit run all kinds of ISM and Shake and jump and blood and fire and smoke and everything else but as long as that life isn't compared with the word and God surely identifying that life then there's no need of trying it because you're out God will never meet it til it comes under the care of the blood Oh hallelujah hey man if you get your vices under the care of the blood and then you get the things that your eyes are looking at all under the care of that blood and man what is the blood today they meant certainly it's not the body fluids that ran down the cross no a man is the life of the but the Holy Ghost and man the Holy Ghost is the blood and that's how the church is the blood by the Spirit is to be born of the Spirit you see that is not just that is not just a slogan the Churches of blood by the spirit huh we are how did we come the mud by the Holy Ghost again by the baptism of the Spirit not just a cliche I'm an ism there's a meaning that the brother of God said you're the blood by the spirit a man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you become what's in that blood you are the blood born of the blood without the blood there's no connection that is why they can't manifest the word of the Covenant because there's no blood connection to this covenant you see the promises of this word brother Brennan said in the token worship him and show his so forth his promise power the God's blood bound took and bound covenant people has the Spirit of Jesus Christ in here that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also display and cabinet you see we're not just talking about the message we are displaying the message are you with me displaying it everywhere that we everybody passing by the children in the home see the token the wife sees the token the husband sees the token everybody the church sees the token of your job they see the token everywhere they see the black at the life of Christ is on display now again shows that Jesus Christ is in here there's only one provided place by God by God for anything this again is in 1963 of just before the token but it's not in jeffersonville but he says and any religion today that hasn't got the blood life of Jesus Christ behind it the death angel is on it right death angel separated from God yes indeedy it Chabad is wrote over every bit of that that event that hasn't got the blood you won't you say well I'm glad the blood now listen if it hasn't taken effect a man if the blood hasn't they in effect and you see it in your life as a consecrated child of God with what Jesus said would take place and be careful you might have something else besides the mud you might have a little injection of theology in there or some little objective some sensations in that look both sides come on both sides of the door sensation and the and theology head knowledge and theology you say I quivered I shook I danced I do this be careful now listen Church this is why the church will go through the tribulation now hear me now the church will go through the tribulation but not the bride hey ma'am you know why it's because because that then again then they will go through the tribulation cuz they think they are under now they have the lamb they have the bow they have the faith but it's not displayed it hasn't been applied isn't there or maybe it's just a blight in one place and there's still another entrance in there's still another area in that Satan can the Death Angel can come in there's anybody listening to me a man then you see they think you're under the blood because of justification by a confession of faith I believe a man but let me tell your friends it's got to be something more than that and then that it's got to be that the life of the lamb has come back above you as a believer so that you have the nature of the land see the Old Testament couldn't do that they can slay the lamb but the nature couldn't come back so all they can have right there is the physical elements of the blood but you have the nature of Christ must be on your body your spirit and your soul hey ma'am it's got to be able with the nature the nature now because this blood has the power to change the nature remember this is where they're heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God trucebreakers covenant breakers on and on and on you know why they you know they because again they deny the power so why they've become safe sinners man we were still sinners we can't help what we're doing you know I want to be good and I'm trying you know instead of watchin one hour of pornography this week I only watch 30 minutes of it but you know I'm improving or I've taken a pass from it for a while and we're just me you know but God and God sees the blood the only way that blood is there is the Holy Ghost is there and if the Holy Ghost is there that nature of the Lamb will let you do those things God revealed to Abel what was acceptable sacrifice and then God showed his approval didn't he hey man he told Cain and Genesis 4:7 if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if you do not well sin lies at the door so in other words he says if you come the same way that your brother did don't you know you'll be accepted if you come by the way of the blood you'll be accepted somebody help me preach now if we insist on a free day Cain's sacrifice denied the blood and offering instead I you know fruits and our theology and men's idea and beautiful sermons and lovely mysteries that are still mysteries man that's what Cain did a man he offered botany life without feeling and if we insist on the baptism of the Holy Ghost without emotion without feeling but because we will come by the way of the blood with feeling then are appealing you cannot continue to offer Cain sacrifice which is a green without blood without feeling sin crops is at the door like the Death Angel II crops is like a cat flying at you like a bat oh I know I know some of you are walking through this like a tomcat walking through molasses tonight but hey let's look at this real carefully the Holy Ghost is not theology neither is it emotion it is a life and when that light comes in you it takes charge of your emotions it also takes charge of your theology a man and man it'll take charge of your passions and mind there and he cares who you care brother madam said you you said you like a person says there I am I'm a believer I believe let the gospel light strike them brother they'll take it right now and they are so results a man certainly you not see that man anymore in pool rooms you not seem out here with a cigarette in his hand you won't see him drinking no no you won't seem flirtin with other women no no no I don't care how much they throw their female flesh before him he'll turn his head toward the skies and look toward Christ what is it it shows the remedy has taken effect again brother branham told us him there is only one way provided by God a man came to me yesterday he says I got a boy 16 brother Brennan I got a boy 12 I take them on the street these little strip teasers out there he said the boys their little males he said what can I tell them and brother Brennan said sir I don't know take them to Christ and let them get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and they'll turn their heads to their modern strip teachers I don't know what to tell my listen I don't have any psychology to help me with I don't happiness a yeah you don't help you with your learning behavior you know don't do this and try dancing you don't try you know tie some ribbon around your head right you don't look away do this yeah I don't have a solution either then get to Jesus hard as you can amen fall in love with Jesus get filled with Jesus it'll take care of that same question they'll turn their heads to these modern strip teasers too many or grandchildren of this message we went along brother Brendan talked about the Pentecostals and their grandkids we're now here we've arrived the message just a way of life it's just a tradition they've been taught good Amish good Mennonite people who've been given strict rules of dress and behavior but are missing the life this is the rising of the Sun brother Brendan said Satan don't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up in it how no matter how religious I'm good how many churches you belong to her will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again he tells us in the message paradox he gave gives us whole illustration about this boy how he inherited as his parents Jean but but they had been converted so there wasn't nothing like their family what was Irish and the other German and one you know he described their whole characteristics of their family and and the wrong characteristics there but you're not like that cuz you've been born again now this boy the only thing he made a promise or something did something with a girl who wouldn't apologize fart and he wouldn't make it right so it was brought to brother branham and he said the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ and water baptism in the pool said I know that my son has come to Christ and I said that may be alright all the outward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believers but unless he's regenerated born again I'd advise a young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on earth fart until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in I'll tell you friends how I've seen it too often men men and women making hell on earth in their home cuz the sweet loving forgiving Spirit of Christ isn't left and if you don't have it I'll tell you what you know your marriage is doomed it's just only time when the bomb will strike you'll explode then that would be a paradox in itself to take the very nature that boy that's bred between father and mother and you know you know yourself I know myself and then I inherited all kinds of things from the pricks and the Middletons and I'll tell you the cross wasn't all that good for you bragging didn't help to cross it with the winners either a man just made a bunch of other messes a man but there's one thing that's a cure for the fruit middleton problem that's the Holy Ghost oh man which makes it different from all the rest of them separated sold out consecrated by men bad the Holy Ghost oh man yep he said now it's a it'll be a paradox in himself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between a father and mother and yet it is an Alexis somebody helped me preach now hold the word here yet it is intellectuals he is trying his best and can't do it he'll never overcome it Christ will half to over tap it see that's why these pick these these TED Talks won't work a man won't we just give them a little bit psychology and reasoning and pat him on the back and say you're all right and going to heaven the way you are you're not you're going to hell you're missing the rapture you need to find a place of repentance and come to God and die after sin sin nature is dead in your life Christ will have to overcome it let me just tell you you're dealing with a problem in your life Christ will have to overcome it listen this ain't a one two three step of a a did they say now that Daddy to cure that Danny listen they're given all kinds of treatments for sin and these treatments aren't working Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in that he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the Spirit of God now we have great meetings today are you still with me I'm just gonna go right on up just right up to the hour so just hang tight I know it's winds tonight we are meetings with great sermons to stimulate the mind what we need is sermons that will bring about a change of nature by leading souls to repentance to do this the dynamics must connect with the mechanics and Belon Belon wouldn't compare this with two cars and he says both of them are filled with octane power which is the word but one has got fire amen and bounce back and the other desert and one will will drive one will go down the road to divine healing through overcoming power right back going back passing sex Simpson fornication and all those things are you in this is no somewhere in the next of us it's going higher it's moving out but the others Jack sitting right in this trap year after year no change don't dealing with the same old problems having to wipe off to all the dirt in the filth of the world listen gasoline represents the word and it's the truth but without the Spirit it won't move a man brother I'll tell you I tell you we're sitting in a good place I said we're sitting in a good place the reason why we're sitting in the good places you've been filled up and man you got 10,000 power octane in your tank there's more than a tiger in your tank hey man don't so word of god that's been put in your tape a man has been put in their service after service it's the time doesn't read and save we put too much stress on the mechanics nothing on the dynamics so I'll tell you then with time we put some stress power to go with the word that we have received and let the spark of the Holy Ghost begin to get that work that has been hid in your heart amen oh and then it'll start moving for it the bride it was the groom hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride a man oh yes he'll give a charge of his dynamics trying to hurry here because you see the Holy Ghost is a very symbol that you have been connected with your sacrifice and there's a problem today you see in the connection that's why there's no firepower there you've got to be connected with the Holy Ghost you got the word but connect it with the Holy Ghost hey man this is what's needed in our church and message churches across the country they meant connect it with the Holy Ghost we're right here to three minutes hours so time to get connected I'm out with your sacrifice that's right now listen if there's no sacrifice in heaven then there's no reason to be connected this makes them the token the Holy Ghost null and void if there's no one there if there's no one has the intercessor if there's no one is the mediator this outpouring of the Spirit is released from the blood of God can I bring you a quotation from the church age book the original outpouring of Pentecost which at Porton came direct from Jesus on the mercy seat isn't doing his chance through all the seven ages showing that perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that never change in God in his essence and his ways hallelujah so when you get connected to your sacrifice a man here comes an outpouring of the Holy Ghost which comes direct from Jesus hoping the Mercy's here amen and if you're not connected to the mercy seat of Jesus come on well people were to connect it up mercy seat on the earth be connected to them we're the one with mercy God won't you connected to him through the Holy Ghost through the power of God that is the surprise dynamics in the church Jesus Christ yesterday [Applause] under that blood remember when that's until that sealed is placed upon you brother Brandon said you have no right to call yourself connected to your sacrifice and this is a problem today people are not connected to the sacrifice and then there's a shot somewhere and there's no dynamics to go with all these mechanics we fiddle faddle and fiddle faddle oh my friend wouldn't this prophet lift he left us a car that was running why did you mess with it and then why don't we go back to the original word in the original message and go back to original Pentecost they let him get connected again with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost begin their power man notice now I'm trying to bring this down to closest remember remember they're in the end they upper room for the first forty days Jesus was with them appearing among up but then 10 days in the upper room and then afters which was seven weeks after the Passover on the fiftieth day the day of Pentecost was fully come and the atonement was applied and the blood was sprinkled upon them as licks of fire began to fall upon each one of them they become connected to the sacrifice that's what's a matter in the churches today they're not connected with the sacrifice when you're connected with the sacrifices overcome in power when you're connected with the sacrifice there is healing power of deliverance there at Pentecost the true hearts drew near with full assurance of faith hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and evil desires like the Sioux like has been stated in Hebrews 10:22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience hot bodies washed with pure water so you see we returned back to the original atonement but until that fire comes upon you the blood of the sacrifice has not been applied to you you must are you hear me must be connected with your lamb with your sacrifice say well we believe it well you give a superficial claim of we believe it but there's no manifestation if God is indeed with you then where are the miracles Amen God is with us I want to say it again God is with us how do I know that Devils are cast out I don't know what kind of devil souls are saved that's what I'm down that at a time is sown the same demons are cast out amen amen Devils are cast out the sick are healed everytime the sickest heal battles are cast out oh man Devils are cast out and sin is exposed and sin is remitted when Devils are cast out we're a [Applause] tonight hallelujah brother Lenin said if a man says he'd born again and tries to place these promises of Christ in this last day to some other age making him Christ yesterday but not today then that man or that person has been under the delusion of Satan and if that man said he believes that many oh we believe in miracles we believe in casting out Devils we believe that relative but it doesn't manifest through Jesus said mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe in all the world camarades casting out Devils speaking with tongues all these manifestations the gifts that would follow that they shall nothing maybe they ought to they will and heavens and earth will pass away but if wine what ho brother we're here we're in another book of Acts Satan's Mian cast out his kingdoms coming down the blood is being applied brother Brendan said now we realize we're not st. Paul and I realize that tonight I'm not st. Paul but he still Jesus he's still God and God's no respecter person he send you pastors and evangelists and things along that you might have the same faith in the same God that st. Paul represented and then if we have the same ministry st. Paul had the same things take place in our ministry take place in that took place and st. Paul's meeting a man brother man told us again the people instead of staring this is God of this evil age sort of tearing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost they let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping divine healing going where she where she ought to be not raising the dead and doing great miracles she's let Satan under his leadership a religious men take the Word of God and try to say it was for another age and she believed it now listen to me he preached over again starting with his church and his seed church by the word preached it out over and over and over again he became a theme in his evangelistic sermons so it was not two out there to the world though he was right here to his church started right here with his own followers Samson just once more Lord a man and what gave him hope was there was a new crop there was new hair growing there was people that was coming back to the covenant of seven lakhs seven seals seven church ages come on seven full power God around the last light the last days and there's a new crop I can feel some hair I feeling some hair about his man are you feeling some hair back here in this church so we
