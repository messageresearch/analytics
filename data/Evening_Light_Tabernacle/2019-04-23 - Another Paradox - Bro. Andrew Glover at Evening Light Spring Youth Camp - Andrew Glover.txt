[Applause] [Applause] his breath [Music] [Music] can you say hey man is this your testimony this morning is that really your testimony this morning I've been changed I'm not the same person I was what a blessing it is to be able to leave this camp this weekend and be able to say truly I've been changed I'm not going back I'm not turning around my past has been destroyed my future is a whole lot brighter the rapture is just around the corner the body changes just any morning I tell you I'm excited this morning aren't you I tell you the grave is not full this morning the grave is empty he is alive and he is well He is risen this morning and I just want to say the devil didn't win [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know the Lord this morning god bless you if you have your Bibles we'll go straight into the word this morning we'll turn to the book of second Corinthians chapter number four second Corinthians chapter number four while you're turning there I just like to say it's been an honor and a privilege to be invited to be here this weekend and to be able to speak with ruther Donnie and I tell you that was a masterpiece last night I'm glad we got dynamite this morning aren't you a man and it certainly has been an honor my heart has been touched and life has been changed and sure appreciate the opportunity to be here this weekend and sure want to thank all the workers all the staff all the ministry everything that has gone into this camp may God richly bless you this morning all the counselors all the drivers everything to make these meetings possible I say God bless you and brother Tim we sure do appreciate him amen the burden to have this camp and the consistency of this meeting just every year growing and every year young people even changed I thank God for a burden like that amen amen god bless you this morning second Corinthians chapter number four and verse number one the Bible says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the Word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid - it is here to them that are lost remember says if that's not predestination I don't know what is in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them notice for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us now notice verse number 8 for we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we are persecuted but not forsaken cast down I love this one but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of our Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake notice that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh I want you to notice something right there Paul did not say that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our immortal flesh but that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so that tells me that before this mortal takes on immortality there's going to be somebody manifesting the victory and the power and the overcoming grace of Jesus Christ and I don't mind telling you I believe I'm looking at a generation this morning that's not waiting on the Millenium to have victory but they've got victory right here this morning they're not waiting on the future home to have victory but they got victory right here this morning let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father we love you today dear God we thank you for your mercy in your grace Lord we thank you for waking us up this morning dear God with a mind to serve you or do we thank you for all that you have done this weekend Lord father there is no way that we could stand here this morning as any mortal man and take credit for the things that you have done this weekend Lord I believe that sicknesses have been healed I believe that diseases have been defeated I believe that demons have been cast out Lord and ultimately I believe that the Holy Ghost and fire has filled vessels all across this building and for that Lord we want to say thank you Father I pray this morning dear God that as we have gathered here on this this Easter morning this resurrection morning Lord as the Sun has risen outside and what a beautiful morning it is the Lord what a beautiful morning it is on the inside of this building dear God Lord to know that hearts that were bound have been set free by the rising not of the SU n but of the rising of the Esso and God I pray this morning he would come in and strengthen us Lord as we prepare or to look into your word for just a few moments this morning dear God feed us Lord Father give us something that we can take from this camp that will sustain us Lord grant it today dear God we pray in Jesus Christ's name and all the believers said hey man god bless you as you may be seated this morning I want to by the help of the Lord to speak to you for a few moments here up on this thought and if I would title it I would like to speak to you on another paradox another paradox I read here in the book of 2nd Corinthians chapter number 4 and verse number 8 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed anybody that is troubled should be distressed we are perplexed but we are not in despair we are persecuted but we are not forsaken we are cast down but not destroyed I think of how that that right there is nothing more and nothing less than a paradox this morning if anybody in the in the world if anybody in the in the country that we live in this morning if anybody has any troubles or any situations or any problems or any circumstances it's the bride of Jesus Christ and we know as brother Donnie mentioned that the devil has already deceived all those churches out there he's already deceived hundreds if not thousands if not millions of people this morning but there's only one group of people on the face of the earth this morning that the devil is really interested in defeating and that is you because he knows that your name is on more than just a church role he knows that your name is on more than just the church membership but he knows that your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life and the Bible says in Revelation that they all Amen worship the image of the Beast except for those whose name was on the Lamb's Book of Life so what is Satan going to do Satan is only going to intense the pressure he is only going to turn up the fiery furnace as it was he's only going to do whatever he can to put more pressure up on you he meant to put more troubles up on you to try to get you to bow or to try to get you to give in or just say well you know maybe after all I didn't get nothing out of that camp maybe it was just emotion or maybe it was just sensation but I want to tell you this morning Church that the battle for truth is on but don't be nervous because the mighty Conqueror is already here amen the mighty Conqueror is already in you amen to bring you not to any kind of end amen but to an expected and I think of what Jeremiah said when he said I know the folks that I have towards you saith the Lord they are not thoughts of evil they are not thoughts of destruction but they are thoughts of peace amen the thoughts of God this morning concerning you amen are the thoughts of peace where is he wanting to bring you he's wanting to bring you to an expected end I can only tell you one thing this morning young people take your position in the army of the Living God and fight for your position like you've never fought before but then sit in this battle for truth he said all them ins that has been lost he said but God said that they would be restored again in the last day Joel said I will restore saith the LORD we went through that not long ago he said in the bribed tree but he said right here this morning we're looking for him we're looking for his manifestation and we'll see the vindicated Word of God and there will be just a few understand it as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man what was say five souls in the days of law there was three saved amen and the wife started out but she lost so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man so this morning amen victory is not promised they meant to those that can start amen but victory is promised those that can start and to those that can finish the race what what good does it do to start a race if you do not finish it but can I can i prophesy to you from the word this morning the word says you're going to finish the race you're going to run the last mile and let me tell your brother you're going to cross the finish line and then there wasn't enough Devils that can stop you from starting there ain't enough Devils that can stop you from running and there ain't gonna be enough Devils that can stop you from Tennyson greater is He that is in us and he that is in the world amen if there's only gonna be one going in the rapture amen it's gonna be me if there's only one leaving Dry Creek Louisiana you know rapture this water it's gonna be me you said brother ender how can you have that testimony because I judged him faithful who made the promise I I didn't touch him it's just a Polish soothsayer I didn't touch him as a devil I touched him as hello him I touched him it's the Living God and then think this morning Church think of it for just a minute amen that many have started this race but look where many are this morning amen many have run the same house that you ran last night but look where they are this morning amen but there is something different about you there is the seed that is laying on the inside of your hearts and the father said all that he has gathered me I will not lose or whatever brother he ain't gonna lose you when you get home he ain't gonna lose you when you get back to school when you get back on the target hey that our God will never lose his old me that we forsake his own in a little while then the world see me no more but she shall see me proud not only be with you but I'll even be in you and a prophet said this morning there are going to be some easy at the end of the world and you are those years is it that beautiful to know this morning that you are the ease that's going to see the Lord in the Prophet said there will vary there will be a very few saved and translated in that time he said but one of the mysteries is that the church is going to be taken up now this is what I like the church is not going to be taken down but the church is going to be taken up well a devil don't like that but it's the truth anyhow the church is not going to go down amen but the church is going to go up see like lot was taken block was taken out Noah was taken in but this church will be taken up seek one whinny and remember says one went out but the other one goes up now in the Adam days man went out Adam covenant burns broke and man went out in Noah's day the end alluvion destruction amen man went in the ark Amen but in this day somebody say this day in this day we're living in the day of the revealing of the sin of man we're not going out we're not going in we're going up we're not going out to the world we're not going into the things of the world but we're going up in the rapture but man says what a consolation is to get this nation which has the church then to know that this man being sent to them speaking of Elijah they meant to represent God had went home without even dying that had been raptured and taken up a very beautiful time Elijah was of this day we may be a little beat line off the path with what some believes but I kindly believe that there will be a message in the last days huh I believe this morning we are gathered hearing that message of the last days something like Elijah and that Elijah Church will not die oh my god that'll hide your church will not die but will be translated and will be taken up he said what's going to take it up fire will take it up in the glory the Pentecostal fire will rapture the church off of the earth and we'll take her up into glory how many can say last night's you felt that Pentecostal fire how many can say last night you felt that Pentecostal fire burning in your soul amen moving through your body reach hearts and your spirits you felt that fire and then all of a sudden we all know what it feels like when it begins to lift up we know that it's beginning to lift up off of us amen but I love what a prophet said he said don't get nervous he said you love it when it comes and you don't like it when it leaves he said but don't worry one of these days when it leaves you're gonna last night we [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] don't worry Church one of these days when it leaves we're gonna give my last days he said he would pour out his spirit upon all flesh and he did see that was not just the prophecy but there was a fulfillment you see God actually promised what has happened here this weekend in his word he promised it would happen now we look at the word paradox what do we find out we find that a paradox Amen is something that is incredible but it's true something that is incredible but it's true Bible says may the Lord at the blessings of the reading of this word now this subject this afternoon a paradox the word paradoxes I've just been looking up he said according to Webster it is something incredible ayman but it's true now you know we've heard the old saying that truth is more stranger than fiction hearing her that truth it's more stranger than fiction because when a person tells the truth sometimes it seems very strange now do you see why that the devil hates the truth because the truth exposes him the truth exposes who the devil is the truth exposes the power and it's trying to hold you you say what is truth truth is a very powerful thing amen now this may sound strange but we live in a generation where people would rather hear lies then they would hear they would rather hear fiction then they would rather hear truth they say can you prove that yes there is people that will deny the virgin birth when we've had a Bible declare it we have the stars in the heaven declared we had patriarchs declare its we had prophets declared and we've got many infallible proofs that there was amen a virgin birth and people still denies but they believe that there's an Easter Bunny that hops around planting eggs in your front yard or they believe that there's a Santa Claus amen that flies around the earth and one night and drop oh don't get cloud on me and drops all kinds of presents ho see that's the age we've come to they would rather have fix and then they would have truth and that's why they're bound with sin that's why they're bound with shame but listen you've not been called a meant to be a generation of fiction you not been pulled to be a generation to follow cunningly devised fables and men's idea you've been called a men to believe a message that it's got power in it brother brother sister don't tell me this morning Church we don't have that Jesus Christ it's not laying in a grave in Jerusalem this morning and he's well and he's livid and he's breathing and he's healing and he's saving and he's manifesting and he's breaking change brings you this morning our not a fiction story your testimony is not a fiction testimony it's a real testimony it's got real power it's a day of time where no matter how many times you prove something they'll still stand right there and say it didn't happen because it's a generation of fiction now I want to preached it for a few minutes on some paradoxes is that okay paradoxes it was a paradox that a 99 year old man and a hundred year old woman could bring forth for son it was a paradox that a man that was full of theology a men that was full of all kinds of learning but he didn't have fire could get in the presence of a burning bush and in five minutes time what he had learned for 40 years he lost in five minutes time in the presence of my God in the presence of the pillar of fire don't you see why the devil's mad this morning don't you really see wise man is because ever since she was born he's been working on you he's been trying to bind you he's been trying to spare you he's been trying to defeat you and in just a few moments of time this weekend the devil's Kingdom has fallen to the ground in just a few moments okay 20 years of water seniors 113 years of work 14 years of work in just a few minutes mother was laying at his feet and Jesus Oh tell me this don't tell me that God came destroy Hey missed a few days ago I don't wanna I don't want to get into this too much but just a few days ago there was a cathedral Amen that had been standing for hundreds of years it had been standing for hundreds of years but in just a few moments of time when it caught on fire Oh God in just a few moments a time when it caught on fire underneath it's a mystery how that immortal man got in the presence of fire and was changed by a burning bush it's another mystery how did a woman a man who was a harlot who is living in a city that was to be destroyed it's another paradox here it's a paradox that she took a scarlet robe and hung it out her window and every building around her was fallen except for that house Oh God ever building around her was falling ever a house around her was Poland ever Church around there was fallen every person around her was died amen but that house stood it was a paradox it was incredible but oh it was true brother sister can I tell you in the Prophet said he said that scarlet robe was a symbol of the token he said that token on this plane let's sit death angel no you got no rights in this house how many can say this morning I've got the token how many can say I've got the token if you don't have the token then let me tell you before this meeting is dismissed this morning you can have the token Church I'm gonna do I'm gonna take my Jesus Christ Himself has given to me our church don't think this morning that it's crazy these things these things may seem crazy but remember they're true it was a paradox that a man by the name of no a man could go out and gather a bunch of gopher wood he could gather that worse kind of gopher wood or the worst kind of wood you could you could gather he could go out and gather that would aim it and bring it together and then say what are you doing Noah he said I'm building an ark I'm building our what do you build an ark for because the Lord told me you go down and build an ark it was a paradox it was incredible but was it true you say brother Andrew is it a paradox aiming that a man by the name of Enoch a man walked with God for hundreds of years my he walked with God for hundreds of years and you know what he did he had fellowship with God it's a paradox then a man got up one morning anyway near maybe and told his wife he said honey it's time for me to go for my daily walk she said okay we'll see you this evening I can imagine in the back part of his mind he said maybe you may see me and you may not aim it and he takes off walking and while he's walking man he just starts fellowshipping with Jesus he just starts filling shipping with the Lord maybe they get to walking and he gets to tell the Lord about @ap just listen - he gets to tell the Lord about a scripture he just read that morning and he began feeling shipment he began filling shipping with the Lord back and forth and they got so caught up in the spirit brother Brad that they just kept on walking and the further they were walking the farther they were getting from Enochs house and the closer they were getting to God's house Church can I tell you this morning you're not a million miles away from your father's house you're just another turn in the road it's just another pin in the road it's just another corner it's just another child away and you'll be back at Papa's house it was a paradox that a man like that a man could walk with God for all those years and keep a testimony that he pleased God it was a paradox that a man by the name of Shamgar could come in the house one day and say honey I'm sick and tired I'm sick and tired of these demons coming in in the form of Philistines and still in our Crump every year I'm sick and tired of these demons coming in and leaving my kids ragged and leaving my wife with no clothes and they're skinny and their muscles are leaving them there's no food to eat their clothes are barely hanging on their soldiers my kids are starving I'm sick and tired of it you know what it's a paradox that a man picked up an ox coat come on church I'm going somewhere to stay with me it's a paradox that a man picked up an ox code and he ran and jumped out the window maybe Luther said and got down there and met sick hundred armed Philistines and you know what he did when he met him he didn't meet him with fear but he met him with faith he didn't meet him in defeats he met him with victory already in his heart and he went out there and he began to sling that ox coat he begin to sling that ox coat and before long six hundred armed four listings were no longer standing but they were laying at the feet of sambar Verlander that's too hard to believe no that's not fiction that's truth it's a paradox then I go just a bit farther it's a paradox Amen that Samson wouldn't meet for this things one day when he would meet those Philistines he would meet them a thousand of them but before Samson ever met the first Philistine God already had a predestinated weapon that he would pick up and he would get a hold of can you say man God already had a weapon laying right there you say brother Andrew what was that weapon it was a jawbone of a mule that had died a long time ago remember says how long that that jawbone laid there he said it lay there no doubt for a long time it was old it was brittle he said just barely picking it up it should've fell apart are you with me just barely picking it up it should've fell apart he said but Samson obeyed God and he reached over and picked up that dry tall bone of that mule and he took that thing and before he knew it he would slay it Philistines and the prophet of God said if God could come down and get into a dead soul bone my God if God could come down [Applause] [Applause] I'll tell you what he's a miracle worker this morning it was a miracle that David Slade laughs it was a miracle that Noah saved eight souls on a ship that was made out of the worst kind of wood it was a miracle that Samson slain a thousand Philistines it was a miracle that Shamgar slayed 604 listings it was a miracle that Rahab's house was saved only by scarlet robe Oh what's another paradox is a young person is a young person under the greatest weight that is ever pen brother Graham said may we see tonight the living Christ who is not dead but as raised again for our justification now lives among us in the person of the Holy Ghost and may he come tonight and speak to every heart that is visible and invisible and may he perform in their hearts the work of the new birth and bring them to redemption power of his resurrection taken away all shadows about to them believe and destroy in all skepticism destroying all skepticism now there is the key skepticism skepticism comes in and people become skeptics rather than believers he said let the Spirit of God destroy all step to system that the church amen might move on in perfect harmony with the will of God do you realize what these meetings have been these meetings have been a tuning up these meetings have been a tuning up of bringing together of bringing back into harmony don't worry I ain't gonna preach all day I can't even notice this it's a bringing together the harmony it's bringing together of instruments listen church you're not just young people your instruments this morning your instruments this morning and do you realize the main thing and instruments got to be it's got to be in tune it's got to be in tune now this may sound funny but just stay with me for a second I don't know what it was a few years ago I got this big burden on my heart of this I don't know if it was a if it was a zeal if it was a passion I don't know what it was but it was a it was a desire to learn to play the banjo be quite Jo Jo can't even play static on the radio least I went got a banjo hey man I went and done a banjo no it was the funniest thing when I walked in there I said I want a banjo he said what kind I said I don't know he said well what kind do you want I said I sir I told you I don't know he said well what come any strings I don't even know how many they got but I just want to learn to play one he said she said sir do you have a book I said what kind of book he said of learners book I said no don't have that he said okay well here's what you need and he give me all this stuff and said now we're going to set you up with an instructor now I bought a brand-new banjo brother Mike Michael a brand-new banjo brand-new just off the shelf it was a beginner it was a cheap when it was a beginner when I mean I thought I was you know I was really gonna learn to do this so I went in there and sit down in the room and the guy picked it up and he said okay we're gonna have your first lesson he's sitting out here let me tune it I said no wait a minute sir it's it's it's it's brand-new it don't need to be tuned he said oh no it needs to be tuned I said no I just bought it out here in your store it's a brand new he said well no you see it's out of tune I said how can it be brand-new and be out of tune he he said well he said when it left the shop he said when it left the factory it was in tune he said but it's been through a lot of things it's been on trucks it's been an airplanes it's been through a lot of things he said so before we can start getting music I love it we gotta clean it up old church bones hurts don't you see this morning [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's ready to leave we're going to be another paradox that the church that come into harmony with the will of God as presented by the Bible and the Holy Ghost so do you see you can be in harmony but you can be in harmony with the wrong thing you can be in harmony with just an emotion and when you get home you'll be attitude you can be in harmony Amen with just a feeling and when you get home you'll be out of tune but if you ever get back in divine harmony he said now there's many critics he said but we stand here tonight in harmony but now notice there's many critics but how that God ever display himself to his people someone says well where is this God you talk so much about he said in Africa in the fields there there is a word they used column Oya which means an unseen force like the wind your God he says the unseen God he is like the wind he's the power but we don't see him John chapter 12 some Greeks came to see Jesus and they said sirs we would see Jesus and they taken to him by one of his disciples Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever now notice this they said sirs we want to see Jesus that was their hearts desire sirs we want to see Jesus and you know what he said and one of his disciples to seeker into the presence of Jesus young people don't you see what this message is come to do it's come to make you disciples when somebody says is there a Living God is he still performing works is he still performing miracles is he still setting people free you don't have to say well let me call my pastor let me call my favorite preacher let me call the deacon stand up on your own two feet and say you want to see a miracle we can find ourselves now I know this sounds rational but if you'll just bear with us a few minutes he said I believe that I by God's help with this word and according to his word I can bring him right here before you why did he come in these meetings this weekend because the prophet of God said if that vine ever puts forth another branch it will be a Pentecostal book of Acts Holy Ghost field Holy Ghost manifesting branch I want you to get something here if that vine ever puts forth another branch so you say well that that must be an adult that must just be a preacher that just must be somebody great he said no you Christians right now how many questions new questions right now are here to find consolation and to come into that presence of God and can raise you up just like he did back then see this morning church it's not just a myth it just not some words put together it's not just the Jewish fable it is the truth see where there is so much air there has got to be some truth somewhere brother can I tell you this morning if there's a lot of error around this message that's because there's some truth in it if there's a lot of nonsense around this word that's because there's truth in this word friends let me say this with all of my hearts don't ever let anybody take the power of this message away from you this said brother ender how can you say that because this message changed my life I'm a witness this morning if you ever get more than just a quote book if you ever get more than just a picture if you ever get up god if you ever get a personal experience let's rebuild world in the depths of your soul it won't be you holding yourself holy what is it Church it's a prophecy it's a prophecy of the end time I'm hurrying it's a prophecy of the end time but many will fall under the air they will fall under the air and by falling under the air their hearts will be turned away from the truth and turned unto fables don't you see that's what the devil wants you to leave this weekend and do is just say it was a fable it was just another youth camp it was just another prayer line no it wasn't it was not just another prayer line it was a Kraken it was a poppet [Music] [Applause] no sir the garlic see blades what did it say has blinded the minds of them which believe not you see what's happening he's blinding the minds of them that believe not but at the same time the god of this evil age is blinding the minds of those that believe not the Son of Man the Son of man has been here this weekend turn in your heart I got turned in your heart don't you see what he's done he's picked up your heart and courage your heart back to himself I want to speak about another paradox for a second it was a paradox of a young girl by the name of Esther I can't preach this like where the Jo priest in Africa but I'm sure gonna pull something from it it was a paradox that a girl that was born coma that a girl that was born but she wanted to go in and see the King I'm gonna hurt here but there was a fear there if I go in and you're not accepted you'll be killed but there come a time that she met desperation and because she did not bow to her fear but she took faith and said listen if I perish then let me perish but I'm going to see the king listen Church can you imagine when she told her I'm going to see the king can you imagine when she told him I'm going back in there I'm going in there can you imagine when she was walking in there and she seen that sceptre laying there can you imagine if she's walking in there and all of a sudden in the back of her mind she's saying I told him if I perish then I'm gonna perish but I'm going to see the king can you imagine that she's standing there all of a sudden she sees that King a man reached for his scepter and the prophet of God said this morning Church he said it's time to run you say brother Andrew how can you say that because I said the same thing if I perish then you're gonna have to let me perish because I'm going amen to see the king you're not running without a message you got the king's scepter there was a little boy one time a little cockney I believe it was over in England the prophet of God said the King had a message to deliver but King had a message to deliver do you see what this message is it's the King's message it's the King's message but King had a message deliver and you know what he said he lifted a little boy just a little old little skinny little old fella that no doubt what even tall as he was but he said here take this message and don't tell them go tell them deliver this King's message it's a paradox because that boy said will they believe me will they believe me when I get back to school and say God deliver me a pornography will they believe me when I get back home and I tell my parents I got the Holy Ghost come on church will they believe me when I tell them Jesus Christ killed my body will they believe better suicidal oppression spirits my heart will they believe me brother Joe what they believed me when I told them that my past is been erased will they believe me when I tell them that my future is a lot brighter in my past will they believe me when I get back to school and they don't see me go to locker room and change into my pants well then boys believe me when they start telling their filthy jokes and I don't sit there and tell them with them will they believe me when I tell them I got changed I got born again I got changed I look different person will they believe me will the church believe me when I come home and don't sleep let me say that again will the church believe me when I get home and don't sleep through the service will my church believe me when I get home and I'm shouting and rejoicing and the fire of God is burning in my heart will they believe me will they believe me and the King lit the gula boy and the love always said will they believe me he reached over and got his scepter he reached over and got his scepter and said here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it was a paradox what I like about the next part is he said take my scepter deliver that message and don't start sorry don't stop for no one if they try to stop you if they try to stop you you don't stand there and argue with them whether brother Branham was a prophet or not if they try to stop you don't stand there argue with them read it all Holy Ghost is real or not try to stop don't stand there eyes with it you just [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're wasting your time [Applause] why are you gonna argue with somebody why are you gonna argue with somebody they're coming these meetings and said I'll stop I'll bind the people I'll scare I'll stand toe-to-toe with them there ain't no way I'm gonna leave and hold it go steel missiles holy vessels [Applause] boys name of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Applause] [Music] it's a sin I'm just saying coming to mind right now that brother David Tyler says why are you gonna argue with the devil that crawled in the garden or walked in the garden and crawled out that's a good point friends why are you gonna argue with somebody that walked in but had to crawl out I'll tell you what the devil does he come walking in this meeting [Applause] [Music] walked in but he called out another portion of this story stay with me don't stop for nobody keep running running my god I can't even talk this morning keep runnin don't stop to argue if they got any questions just so in the center but whatever you do whatever you do make sure the message gets delivered [Music] make sure the message gets delivered my god it's burning I've got to make it real [Applause] I seen my little cousin Riley over there come here Riley he's there somewhere hurry run a king it's got a message to deliver I want to drive this home come here a king has got a message to deliver and he doesn't look for a 50 year old man because it's urgent he looks for a young boy anybody anybody that'll just be willing to take a scepter and he takes that sector what he lays it in his hand he says you're running this this runner is not in his hand [Applause] [Applause] Lord a little bully running through the land for the Kings message a little oddball that they already think you're crazy running to the University for the Kings message to see you wear the King's message and I asked you this morning in closing what can stop nothing could stop that little boy his faith wasn't in his flesh his faith wasn't in who his parents was his faith was in the king's scepter his faith was in the king's scepter Church my face is not in my flesh my face is not in my family my patients not just hitting my church my faith is not just gonna preacher my faith my face [Applause] we're the king when you leave this camp now I know brother Tim's coming in a minute to tell you pack up all your dirty clothes I'll let him tell you what's back make sure you get all your stuff together don't leave no socks the Lord heaven knows I can't wear man don't leave no towels make sure mama's favorite towel set gets home but most of all wear the Tim forgive me if you leave your towels and you leave your clothes make sure you get the scepter the clothes the scepter is the only thing the scepter is the only thing where the Craig the scepter is the only thing but it so the scepter is the only thing you look at naughty the scepter is the only thing brother Blake the scepter is the only thing but Isaac receptor it's the only thing that's gonna get you to Laodicea the scepter Prince you're gonna have a lot of battles but you got the scepter you're gonna have some mountains to cross but you got the scepter sister you're gonna have some battles to face but you got the scepter young man you wanna have some spirits that you're gonna have to withstand but you got receptor you're gonna have to withstand fashion but you got a scepter how many got the scepter this morning god I got the scepter this morning we're a paradox for the 7 it's a paradox search make sure you leave this camp with a symptom with a scepter and can I give you one more word of advice Kenna may not be nice might not be politically correct it may not be pretty but when that old devil comes to you it starts talking in the back of your mind start saying now when you get home see now here's your battle ok because right here in this meeting God has convicted your heart of things right here in this meeting God has told you there's things in you in your bedrooms got to go there's things in your calls that's got to go but now here's the battle here's the battle is between here and getting home to get rid of it come on Church we ain't angel angels this morning we're humans battling human battles with a mighty conquer in us now the battle is when you get home when the fire ate there and brother Donnie ain't running across the pulpit and brother Andrew being real calm when brother might clean up their singing and brother Timothy ain't singing and the music ain't playing say planning and that holy anointing music driving out evil spirits and you get back home and now you got to do more than just shout about it now you've got to do more than just run about it but now you've got to manifest what God done for you you got to go home friends when you get there remember this but God that was with me when you cross the platform there's the God it'll be with yes when you go home with God that was with you in the prayer room is not this the God it'll be with you when you get home Oh church yes my God can put water in the ocean if my god can Carmel tyleroxley then my God can give you the faith to get home and take music out of CD players don't belong there take pants out of closets don't belong there throw makeup away come on Church clean up the videos pick up dirty magazines my God is a God who wants to bring this camp-meeting to pass action [Music] musicians come this morning my god is it God it wants another paradox I could take time this morning and go through the paradoxes of the Bible could take time this morning go through the paradoxes of brother Barron's ministry congressman Upshaw paradox Rosella Griffin paradox paradox William Branham paradox paradox how can you say that bill endure it was a paradox that a man twice the size of brother Branham ran up on the platform and said you imposter I'll break every bone in your body so the devil said and a man that didn't weigh probably more than 200 pounds what NIST all what is big stood right there and set in the name of Jesus Christ you won't touch one bone of meat but you'll fall over my feet this is not fiction this is not Walt Disney come on church this is not a fairy tale this is paradoxes [Music] you'll fall across my feet fell across his feet it was incredible but it was true paradox but let's bring it to this day young man walks across the platform bound leaves free when there's more of sins more appealing in this day than it's ever been and he comes through that pare line and he leaves changed and he grows up and he holds a testimony that he never goes back to what God delivered in Crump this is real church this sacred angel it's impossible for God to deliver a person and then not go back to it it may be impossible with your God but with my God all things are possible [Music] it's a paradox a lady in this day and time would go the doctor and they told her she had cancer and she would receive a word of the Lord and begin to shout around a church and God would heal her and go back and they couldn't even find a trace of it and that paradox is in this field in this morning don't touch my sister right there that's not Moses as they that's not Paul's day that's not just for the bantams day that's you're in this field in this morning there's the mighty host of paradoxes this brother Donnie said last night it's not just gonna be 50 year olds 60 year olds taking a rapture but the final paradox is gonna be some morning between about 6:00 and 9:00 and the devil wakes up looking for you and he can't find you he says no no I just knew I was going to claim them I just knew they were gonna be mine because greater is He that is in you and he is in this cosmos he wrote another paradox not in a in a book of ink and paper but in the heart of a son or daughter of God he said in the last days I will not write a new law or a new commandment upon stone but I will write it in the flesh of your hearts how many can say this morning Lord let me leave this youth camp as a written epistle as a written Bible and so written young man as a rich young girl let us all stand our feet another paradox you say Billy Andrew why did you say this this morning because I want you to leave here no it's not over just because you leave a Miss camp and just because you're going home it's not over but remember you're a paradox you're a young person and she got the second second [Music] emember when I got the Holy Ghost here at this camp and got home brother Ben I thought everything was gonna be just easy man McKenney I thought I'd get home and I'd go to testifying about getting the Holy Ghost and everybody be like praise Lord you know man I got home got back to school got back in my regular routine walked in said I got the Holy Ghost though the person I thought for sure would encourage me went really got the Holy Ghost well let's see if he got it I said oh I said I won't show you about the Holy Ghost inside of me will you know what that was the devil they come over that person to try to tempt me it was come to find out it was a religious spirit I didn't know it at the time but they actually believed the Holy Ghost that person I told actually believed the Holy Ghost evidence of it was speaking in tongues and a religious spirit tried to shut my victory off as soon as I got back home but by God's grace here we stand this morning cause I got more than just played for I got the Kings second as we bowed our heads this morning I want you to say play something softly I know it made me end indifferent this morning but this is what was up on my heart today I want you to make sure before you leave this camp you've got the scepter make sure you see the prophet of God said that Eve lost the battle he said because she stopped to listen to the devil's reasoning she lost the battle because she stopped and listened to what Satan had for interpretation on God's Word but when you get home don't stop don't stop young girl don't stop don't stop and open up your heart to reasoning don't stop and listen to that old defeated devil don't stop take the scepter sewing the scepter and keep on walking how many can say Lord I want to leave this camp with us after god bless you hands up all over the building even the adults in the back god bless you young people you've got people sitting behind you this morning they'd have been in this race a whole lot longer and we have but they're standing here this morning as witnesses but if the king ever gives you the scepter nothing can stop you well if you ever get the scepter nothing can stop you Heavenly Father as we bow our heads and raise our hands and humble our spirits in our presence this morning dear God I pray in the name of Jesus Christ every young boy every young girl every man every woman ever deacon ever trustee ever preacher every musician ever song leader every officer every member this body I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that they would leave this camp with the scepter dear God that young boy was just any kind of boy Lord he was just a common boy you're just standing there dear God but what made the difference but King Center made the difference the King Center made the difference dear Lord what's going to make the difference in these meetings when we leave the scepter Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I know since Thursday night - this morning you are sick and tired of hearing our voices Satan I know you wish we would just shut up but we want to tell you one more time you are defeated in the name of Jesus Christ and Satan hear us this morning our God is with us our God is in us and when we leave this camp our God will be with us and you are defeated in the name of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father bless your people today God let him leave athis sector in Jesus name in Jesus name can we just raise our hands with our eyes closed as we sing this we've been made more than conquerors maybe if you're here this morning you don't have that scepter maybe you've been waiting for the last service waiting for God that there's something for you let me turn that around for you you're not waiting on God he's already done what he said he's waiting on you to accept it brother and ER there's not a lot of emotion he never said there had to me he never said did you feel it he never said did you sense it he just said did you believe it as we sing it this morning let it be more than a song we've been made more than conquers when we get back home [Music] overcomers in this we Oh we through is that your testimony this morning [Music] [Music] oh that's beautiful this morning we [Music] Jesus just the sisters this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let's hear our witnesses in the back see you this morning or just a feeling [Music] yes [Music] one more time all again without the heart sound make it your ally [Music] Jesus and all hell teaches stop [Music] rafi or she glad you given authority to say that this morning so soon beast [Applause] [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah how many joy the word of the Lord this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're something I can get through this morning a man how many could hold your scepter in victory this morning a menace in the name of Jesus stay [Music] hold that banner hide the name of Jesus was that the name of Jesus every knee has to bow and every tongue has to confess that he's Lord he's ruler over all amen hey man I just want to report to you that not one spirit that we dealt with last night remained in victory if everyone was defeated [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen god bless you amen would you two take your seats just for a moment we come to these closing moments of the camp today you know I I just want to give you a little bit of instructions before that you go one thing um how many how many received and experience with God in this camp this year a greater experience greater walk with the Lord amen god bless you for that amen hands up all over the building and I'm just going to tell you what you got to do you got to feed that experience with the Word of God a man and so just like the natural man gets hungry so this the inner man must be fed and built up in the Word of God and we gave you some the prayer and promise booklets there to contain scriptures and quotations there for you to read into to dwell upon so there there's one thing something here a couple of years ago we gave out complete sets of brother branham's sermons but those are also available online and I just want to say there's also a lot of other stuff available online and knowing that the I gate and the ear gate are gateways into the soul you want to be careful what you look at and what you hear amen because they are gateways to the soul and that's how demons enter in and I've met too many of them even in this meeting too many I'm too if I meet one it's too many phonography demons and the end and the the more entrenched they are in a person's life than the more depths of sin the more difficult they are to make leave because they have such a hold on in person amen but when we but but we know we can receive victory in the name of Jesus so you know if you don't want to open yourself up to spirits well then don't don't feast on them things that are open you up to every kind of devil arias and so you know many many years ago brother Tim told his fellow ministers I said you know this is maybe 20 30 years ago I said you know our solution for television is just don't have one and that way we're not feeding on it we're not looking at it it's not in our home is not taking our time I said but the time will come that we will have an hour that would be that would be mmmm it'll make television look like nothing I said because we'll have it right in our devices right in our pockets right in our hand we'll have to do banking with it communication every kind of other things and you won't be able to say just don't have it so you know what you got how the token you get to hold it goes to your life you will not desire this thing if this one that belongs to me has never been used for some evil purpose they meant because of why not because somebody was looking or I was afraid somebody was watching or you know bigger gods do and not do something in secret but because of a token that takes a desire sin out of our lives amen set no evil thing before your eyes so feature experience on the Word of God I think we baptized about 8:00 last night in the wonderful name of Jesus amen and i and i also want to thank you for an offering of four thousand one hundred eighty seven dollars and seventeen cents and we're thankful to you for that god bless you and then forgiving them to the more that helps us to pay the expenses of the camp and because there are there are expenses that inc that are incurred that it goes beyond even your your fees that you pay but anyway we're so happy that you came and that you're a part of these services and we and and i just want to emphasize again i could never do this without our wonderful counselors i wonder if they would stand up would you know do you better counselor let's see thank you my goodness that's a whole army right there amen god bless you thank you for the chaperones and bus drivers and all of those we really appreciate all of you that came and and we're part of with this like i said i could never do this

or rewards there on that day men for your labor unto the lord also i want to thank the the deacons and the the gator patrol here that helps to keep order and so on and keeps things running smoothly they're in the building you can stand up - thank you very much bless you in our ministry it is so important what would can't be without preaching hey man how many appreciated the word the Lord what was preached thank you brother brother Donny Reagan hey man heard your ministry into the lord god bless you amen thank you and also you know we have a lot of us behind the scenes things that happens you know we have to get them down the day before camp and then throughout the afternoon they'll be loading up all the equipment and things that we bring from our home church and we have those that help us with sound and video where that you can go to evening like.net Minh and listen to these sermons and these see these services for months even years to come and so I want to thank our sound and video men for their their work amen we really appreciate that thank you thank you very much god bless you for you there's given unto the Lord those that help with that also you know for the last oh I
