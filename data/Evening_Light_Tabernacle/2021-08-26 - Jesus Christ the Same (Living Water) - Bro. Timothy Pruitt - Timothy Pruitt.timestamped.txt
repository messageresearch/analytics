[40:45] you know those are around us lord
[40:46] they're watching in the needs in their
[40:48] hearts
[40:49] father those that are sick lord god may

[41:07] lord
[41:08] amen it's good to be home
[41:10] amen
[41:12] always good to be home
[41:14] we had a wonderful time while we were
[41:16] away at brother ray erickson's
[41:18] assembly that put on the they call it i
[41:21] guess the true word tabernacle camp and
[41:23] it was their first year
[41:25] uh to have youth camp but really you
[41:27] wouldn't have been able to tell it it
[41:28] was such a well-run camp and
[41:32] and
[41:32] my just the atmosphere that was created
[41:35] was a wonderful place to be
[41:37] and uh
[41:39] i wish you could have been there
[41:41] amen i wished all of us could have been
[41:43] there but uh you know we got to
[41:45] experience the other side of things
[41:48] most of the time we experience
[41:50] buses coming in and people coming in and
[41:53] and we got to experience that part of it
[41:55] traveling there and and ministering at a
[41:58] camp and our young people you know maybe
[42:00] being in dorms without their favorite
[42:02] people and
[42:03] and
[42:04] we definitely found out one thing
[42:06] there's worse food than louisiana youth
[42:08] cat
[42:10] i'll just say that
[42:11] but
[42:12] so we're blessed
[42:14] people amen but uh
[42:17] you know it was a wonderful time in the
[42:19] lord but andrew spencer uh ministered
[42:22] there with me and
[42:23] us together and
[42:25] the lord just moved in some tremendous
[42:27] ways and we're just thankful for that
[42:29] because you know without him this it
[42:32] means nothing all the miles and all the
[42:35] money and all the
[42:36] everything it means absolutely nothing
[42:38] if he doesn't come by but when he does
[42:41] it means everything
[42:42] because he does he has eternal benefits
[42:45] and
[42:46] and there's eternal things that have
[42:47] been done and i know our young people
[42:49] i've
[42:51] listened to a lot of the testimonies
[42:52] that were sent to me and
[42:54] and things and god you know what what a
[42:57] what a testimony would make you do
[43:00] it'll make you real happy that the lord
[43:02] would reach down and touch and change
[43:05] lives and that's a wonderful thing it
[43:06] also makes you real mad at the devil
[43:09] because of house what a slime ball he is
[43:11] what he would do to our girls and to our
[43:14] boys and and what he would tell them and
[43:16] their minds and and and and their dark
[43:19] places that they go through
[43:21] i hate him
[43:23] amen and he hates me but that's all
[43:25] right
[43:26] amen but to know that in the middle of
[43:28] all that god can come and and restore
[43:31] and rewrite and make it as though you've
[43:33] never done it in the first place
[43:36] my whatever awesome god we serve so we
[43:39] would definitely love to thank brother
[43:40] nathan erickson and brother ronnie long
[43:43] and brother ray and for the wayne lawson
[43:46] all the ones that was there
[43:48] we know what it's like to put a camp
[43:50] like that on and
[43:51] and it doesn't go without sacrifice and
[43:53] we sure thank them for what they've done
[43:56] to make it available for our youth
[43:58] because this church will reap the
[43:59] benefits of that meeting
[44:01] your homes will reap the benefits of
[44:03] that meeting
[44:04] amen so we're thankful for that hebrews
[44:07] 13 and verse 8 jesus christ
[44:10] the same yesterday today and forever
[44:14] exodus 17 and verse 5
[44:17] and the lord said unto moses
[44:19] go on before the people and take with
[44:21] thee of the elders of israel
[44:23] and thy rod wherewith thus modest the
[44:26] river
[44:27] take in thine hand and go
[44:29] and behold i will stand before thee
[44:31] there upon the rock of horeb and thou
[44:34] shalt smite the rock and there shall
[44:36] come water out of it that the people may
[44:39] bring may drink
[44:41] and moses did so
[44:43] in the sight of the elders of israel
[44:46] amen will let you be seated
[44:48] last time i spoke on this thought of
[44:50] jesus christ the same
[44:52] spoke on the living bread
[44:55] tonight i'd like to speak to you on the
[44:57] living water
[44:59] amen the living water
[45:01] you know we know that
[45:02] israel has always been a historical
[45:05] example of the church
[45:07] because they're natural israel and we're
[45:09] spiritual israel
[45:11] because israel was a people that of god
[45:13] until they came out of egypt and brother
[45:15] brown said when they came out of egypt
[45:17] there was not just the people of god
[45:19] there was the church of god because they
[45:21] were separated from the rest of the
[45:23] world
[45:24] and he said when we are separated from
[45:26] the rest of the world then we become the
[45:28] church
[45:29] but as long as we are entangled with the
[45:31] rest of the world we are not in the
[45:34] church
[45:35] now we might be in the church but we're
[45:37] not in the church
[45:38] because if our heart is in the things of
[45:40] the world and the love of
[45:42] you know the love of the world and the
[45:43] things of the world then the love of god
[45:45] is not even in us as the bible would say
[45:48] amen so it takes a separation amen to
[45:51] become the church or the bride of jesus
[45:53] christ but as long as our our our foot
[45:56] is you know maybe one foot in the church
[45:58] or one foot in the world we're not in
[46:00] the church
[46:01] you know we're we're maybe a part of a
[46:04] certain lifestyle or a part no different
[46:06] than maybe the baptists or even the
[46:08] mennonites or something like that amen
[46:10] because we have have desires in our life
[46:13] that are still there amen and i'm not
[46:15] talking about temptations i'm talking
[46:17] about desires
[46:18] amen temptations is something different
[46:20] in many ways because the devil will come
[46:23] and he'll tempt you but that don't mean
[46:24] that's what you desire to do
[46:26] amen because when there's desires there
[46:28] says there's a longing there's a lust
[46:30] there's a want for the things of the
[46:32] world more than the things of god but we
[46:34] know as a people of god we have to
[46:36] separate ourselves come out from among
[46:38] those that are unclean deal not with
[46:40] them be not partakers of their sin yoke
[46:43] not up with the unbelievers but separate
[46:45] yourself from the things of the world
[46:48] and when israel was in egypt they were
[46:50] the people of god but when they was
[46:52] called out or had an exodus of coming
[46:54] out then they were called the church
[46:57] because they had separated themselves
[46:59] unto god from the rest of the world and
[47:03] you know the very word church means
[47:04] they're called out amen the exodus means
[47:07] to come out amen each one of us as
[47:10] christians has had an exodus in our life
[47:12] we've had a time where we're called out
[47:15] from amongst our associates we're called
[47:17] out from the people that we once
[47:19] fellowship with and became a different
[47:21] people or
[47:22] peculiar people to walk as a different
[47:25] people act in a different way walk a
[47:27] different walk talk a different way it
[47:30] was the exodus of our life
[47:33] every one of us has had to have that
[47:35] young people you're not by yourself when
[47:37] you come to the lord and you realize
[47:39] there's things that's been in your life
[47:40] you got to live by leave behind you must
[47:43] leave behind you must cut it completely
[47:45] off as as joshua would say as they
[47:47] entered it even into the uh the promised
[47:50] land he said get you a sharp knife and
[47:52] let's have a circumcision let's cut off
[47:54] the things of the world let's cut off
[47:56] everything and i i believe there's if
[47:58] there's ever a perfect time for young
[48:00] people right now to do that is right now
[48:03] it's time that you look in your life and
[48:05] you begin to look at it and judge it not
[48:07] according to your desires or your wants
[48:09] or or your thoughts but according to the
[48:11] word of god and anything that is not of
[48:14] the word of god cut it off amen because
[48:16] if you're not careful that thing will
[48:18] lay there and it may seem very innocent
[48:20] but it'll begin to get bigger and bigger
[48:22] and bigger until it pulls you right back
[48:24] in now we've seen that happen in the
[48:26] children of israel that left amen the
[48:29] the egyptians and he left egypt and and
[48:32] they get on our you know in some
[48:33] difficult times and they begin to look
[48:35] back at what they left they begin to you
[48:38] know lust after the pots the the garlic
[48:40] of egypt and the things of egypt why
[48:43] because their heart never left egypt
[48:45] their body may have left egypt but their
[48:47] heart didn't leave egypt so we want a
[48:49] complete separation from the things of
[48:51] the world amen a complete separation and
[48:54] sometimes you got to delete phone
[48:56] numbers
[48:58] sometimes you got to get a whole
[48:59] different phone number amen sometimes
[49:02] you got to just completely cut yourself
[49:04] away because that's not who you are
[49:07] that's not where you're going to be
[49:08] that's not where you're going back to
[49:10] i'm going on with jesus and i i know
[49:13] there's many here tonight that made that
[49:14] declaration in this weekend of meetings
[49:16] we have had amen you've made a
[49:18] declaration i'm going on with him i'm
[49:20] leaving that old past behind amen well
[49:23] if you're going to do that i say it do
[49:25] it with your whole heart
[49:27] amen put both feet into the word of god
[49:30] and your heart unto the word of god and
[49:32] everything have an exodus in your life
[49:34] if you're ever going to have an exodus
[49:36] out of this body into a new body you got
[49:39] to have an exodus out of the world into
[49:41] a new life
[49:43] amen so the you know
[49:45] israel gave us that example when god
[49:47] called them out they had an exodus they
[49:49] had a coming out among the people of the
[49:51] world to become a separated nation of
[49:54] peculiar people they they walk it they
[49:57] began to walk under the shadows of the
[49:59] mercy seat they lived and began to walk
[50:02] by the pillar of fire god brought them
[50:04] from egypt to the land that he had
[50:06] promised by the pillar of fire
[50:10] hallelujah what what what a what a an
[50:12] honor to be identified as a people who
[50:15] are led by the pillar of fire
[50:18] not led by our emotions not led by our
[50:20] desires not led by our humanity not led
[50:24] by our thoughts and our thinking but led
[50:26] by the pillar of fire now it ain't just
[50:28] a pastor that's to be led by a pillar of
[50:30] fire or a deacon board or trustee board
[50:33] or a church it's individuals young and
[50:36] old say god i want to be led i don't
[50:38] want to be led by my passions i don't
[50:41] want to be led no more by what i want or
[50:43] my desires or my humanity i want to be
[50:46] led by the pillar of fire i want to be
[50:49] led by the holy ghost in my life and in
[50:51] making the decisions and i'm yielding
[50:54] myself and saying god not my will
[50:58] but thy will be done
[51:01] this is an exodus
[51:03] and they were given a spiritual leader
[51:06] it was moses he was an anointed man for
[51:08] the hour a great man a great prophet of
[51:11] god
[51:12] he had been called from his mother even
[51:14] before the time he was born
[51:16] a prophecy had laid there god ordained
[51:19] him before the foundation of the world
[51:20] to be a leader to that generation
[51:23] to bring this exodus to a people
[51:26] and amram began to seek after the lord
[51:29] and in the moment of the prophecy begin
[51:31] to come to be fulfilled and and the
[51:34] angel began to spoke and spoke to amram
[51:36] and told him what was about to take
[51:38] place and little moses was born and they
[51:41] you know they feared not the
[51:42] commandments of the king or his threats
[51:45] they knew that god had his hand on moses
[51:48] and that settled it
[51:50] no matter what the king said what the
[51:52] political world said what everything
[51:54] else said they knew god has his hand on
[51:57] moses so they wasn't scared to turn him
[52:00] loose in the midst of the crocodiles
[52:02] they amen they wasn't scared of that yet
[52:04] moses was put right in a little ark set
[52:06] right among the crocodiles sent right
[52:08] down the river because they didn't fear
[52:10] that they knew god had his hand on moses
[52:14] oh hallelujah well now if we could just
[52:17] know the same thing that our great
[52:19] leader the holy spirit god has sent him
[52:22] and he's our leader
[52:25] he's our leader it's not a man that's
[52:27] leading it's the holy spirit that's
[52:29] leading it's men that have said have
[52:31] come under the unction and the the power
[52:34] of the holy ghost
[52:37] and no matter what the world says
[52:41] no matter how much they want to laugh at
[52:43] us they want to make fun of us we're
[52:45] following our leader
[52:50] amen no matter what they say we're
[52:52] following the holy ghost
[52:54] no matter how much they make fun of us
[52:56] we're following the pillar of
[52:58] fire no matter how much they want to
[53:01] call us a bunch of holy rollers and
[53:03] fanatics we're following the pillar of
[53:05] fire and where it leads i'm going to go
[53:11] we must follow him
[53:13] he's been sent to us to lead us and
[53:15] guide us he said a little worthwhile and
[53:17] the world will see you not me no more
[53:19] but you shall see me
[53:21] for i'll be with you even in you to the
[53:24] end of the world oh hallelujah to think
[53:27] about that we're privileged people
[53:29] because there's a whole
[53:31] a whole millions and maybe even billions
[53:34] of people that can't even see him
[53:38] many of them even deny his own existence
[53:40] but even those that that even say there
[53:43] is a god many of them cannot see the
[53:45] pillar of fire that's leading the church
[53:48] [Music]
[53:49] listen it wasn't just moses with a rod
[53:52] and maybe that's all the egyptians saw
[53:53] and they was looking out their windows
[53:55] that morning and peeping out their
[53:57] curtains after the death angel had
[53:58] passed and they got brave enough to come
[54:00] out and they saw amen these millions of
[54:03] jews or israelites come walking out and
[54:06] moses in front with a rod but what they
[54:08] failed to see it wasn't just a rod it
[54:10] wasn't just moses it wasn't just a bunch
[54:12] of people it was our amber light that
[54:14] was burning it was a pillar of fire that
[54:17] was leading them
[54:19] and people are not careful all they see
[54:21] in our services and maybe it's a song
[54:24] and somebody gives a dance or or this
[54:26] goes on and this word goes forth and
[54:28] they think it's just a bunch of this or
[54:30] that amen but listen it's more than that
[54:32] what they fail to see is the amber light
[54:35] the spirit of god that is moving among
[54:38] us
[54:47] when a fellow receives christ as a
[54:50] savior let me let me back up for a
[54:53] minute sorry
[54:54] so we must follow this leader
[54:56] do what he says
[54:58] this leader will never take us off the
[55:01] path
[55:03] he will keep us right on the path of the
[55:05] scriptures at all times
[55:07] but he'll never go to one side for
[55:09] something or this side for something
[55:11] he'll say right straight on the road of
[55:13] the scriptures
[55:15] oh i love that on the road to the
[55:16] scriptures you know but could you
[55:18] imagine the joy that was in the camp
[55:21] as they would walk out of egypt and they
[55:23] would begin to make their journey
[55:25] towards the promised land to shout and
[55:27] things that were going on he said it's
[55:28] just like when a fellow receives christ
[55:30] as a savior everything is on the
[55:32] housetop but before this man can come
[55:35] into the baptism the holy spirit this
[55:37] person he must go through a sanctifying
[55:39] process and it's a testing time and
[55:42] things are done and chastisements and
[55:44] and all this is going on he's wondering
[55:46] what's happening and he says all but all
[55:48] things are working together for the good
[55:50] of them that love the lord then we're
[55:52] sons and daughters of god but then after
[55:54] all of that he comes and seals us with
[55:57] the holy spirit until the day of our
[55:59] redemption
[56:00] he said but when they were down in egypt
[56:02] god sent moses he stretched forth a rod
[56:05] and flies and lice and things come forth
[56:08] and he showed it all the way and while
[56:10] they were there things were taking place
[56:11] in egypt but over in goshen nothing was
[56:14] going on it was sunshine
[56:16] there was no clouds no flag struck them
[56:19] it was a glorious time he said just like
[56:22] you did when you first got saved
[56:26] oh everything the birds sang different
[56:28] everybody was sweet nobody was out to
[56:31] get you
[56:32] everybody loved everybody
[56:34] but then the trying time comes
[56:37] all of a sudden the car breaks down and
[56:41] dishwasher quits
[56:43] ain't talking about your wife i'm
[56:44] talking about the dishwasher
[56:46] the dishwasher quits
[56:49] everything was just going dandy when you
[56:51] first got saved and things were
[56:53] happening what's going on
[56:56] he says sanctifying time
[56:59] it's a time god is making you to lay
[57:01] aside the weights that so easily beset
[57:04] you
[57:05] he said you a man had to stop you
[57:06] smoking stop your drinking stop going to
[57:08] the pool rooms and your all-night car
[57:10] parties and those things had to sanctify
[57:12] yourself now that might not be what
[57:14] you're dealing with
[57:16] it might be social media in this day
[57:18] we're living in
[57:20] and things that have been distracting
[57:21] you and and and the things that's been
[57:23] going on you he said you're women that
[57:25] let your hair grow out lengthen your
[57:27] dress act like you're different than you
[57:29] was sanctifying times
[57:32] so many will go through that process and
[57:35] rebel
[57:37] and say i don't want to go no further
[57:39] but not a child of god
[57:42] a child of god when he starts he looks
[57:44] straight at calvary because he knows
[57:47] this is for my good
[57:50] [Applause]
[57:53] hey i don't understand you know as a
[57:54] young man you looked at your daddy when
[57:56] he pulled out that belt or that whooped
[57:58] off that switch off a tree and he began
[58:00] to whoop your hive for something you've
[58:01] done he's telling you it's for your good
[58:03] and you're trying to figure out how in
[58:04] the world and stripes on my back and a
[58:07] belt against my bottom and stinging
[58:09] going on for my good
[58:10] but it was for your good
[58:13] it showed you that was the wrong thing
[58:14] to do
[58:15] that was not where you're supposed to be
[58:17] that was not who you're supposed to
[58:18] where you're supposed to go amen this is
[58:20] exactly the chastisement of god come in
[58:22] our lives is for our good
[58:26] everything he does is for our good
[58:29] every situation that happens he allows
[58:31] to take place is for our good
[58:42] but you know in the process of time in
[58:44] israel
[58:45] when there's great crowding in time when
[58:47] the people begin to fall away
[58:51] then in their chatting
[58:54] well we wish you were back down in egypt
[58:57] our souls loathe us this light bread
[59:00] he said in other words in the modern day
[59:02] time it would be like this
[59:04] oh every wednesday night we got a prayer
[59:07] meeting we got service every sunday
[59:08] morning back to church what did we hear
[59:11] the same thing
[59:12] the preacher stands up and preached
[59:14] songs go back
[59:15] says see you're just going in as a line
[59:18] of duty he said you need to come as a
[59:20] worshiper
[59:23] a worshiper goes in there to worship to
[59:25] express himself before his god to praise
[59:28] god for his goodness to every word he
[59:30] hangs on to it just like a love affair
[59:33] you know if you was to go with a girl
[59:35] because you knew it was a duty or your
[59:37] mama wanted you to go with this certain
[59:38] guy wanted you to go with a certain boy
[59:42] you know you didn't get nothing you
[59:44] didn't feel the feeling you feel around
[59:46] certain people you know
[59:48] you know they want you to go with
[59:49] somebody
[59:50] i'm going to try not to use no examples
[59:53] mercy
[59:56] but you got you know you got this
[59:58] maybe a certain mom got her eye on a
[1:00:00] certain boy for a dollar and said what
[1:00:02] do you think about this one yeah
[1:00:04] no
[1:00:05] but for mama's sake you try it
[1:00:09] you know yeah but you know what he he
[1:00:11] just does dumb stuff
[1:00:14] he just says the dumbest jokes
[1:00:16] and it don't do nothing for you there's
[1:00:18] no connection there you of course when
[1:00:20] you go back the other way i mean the boy
[1:00:21] tries to do it rather out of his
[1:00:23] father's or her mother's desire and and
[1:00:26] you know
[1:00:28] you know i see her she don't ever have
[1:00:30] her hair fixed
[1:00:36] she just don't have that sparkle in her
[1:00:38] eye
[1:00:39] she just don't have you know that that's
[1:00:42] not he said see it bores you
[1:00:44] he said why because it's not a love
[1:00:46] affair
[1:00:48] he said but if love is there you don't
[1:00:51] care what it is
[1:00:54] how it is
[1:00:55] what's taking place you want to be with
[1:00:58] him
[1:01:01] and he said it's the same way with god
[1:01:03] you won't say why does he preach so long
[1:01:09] oh
[1:01:14] hallelujah
[1:01:17] you know your parents were laughing at
[1:01:18] your kids and i just smoked their hides
[1:01:21] why does he preach so long
[1:01:23] why what about all this stuff and
[1:01:25] everything see the problem is you're not
[1:01:28] in love
[1:01:31] when you really hang on to every word
[1:01:36] because it's a living water
[1:01:38] i gotta have a drink
[1:01:41] [Applause]
[1:01:46] hanging onto every word and by the way
[1:01:48] all that was a direct quote i can give
[1:01:49] it to you of church that might be what
[1:01:51] he's been talking to you about hanging
[1:01:54] on
[1:01:55] it's eternal life every word of god
[1:01:58] he said it's a joy to go to church under
[1:02:01] any circumstance
[1:02:06] whoa hallelujah whether it's hot cold
[1:02:08] and different whether people are fussing
[1:02:10] growling whatever they're doing it's a
[1:02:12] joy to hear the word of the lord then
[1:02:15] when you know you're in that place you
[1:02:17] know you're in love with christ you love
[1:02:21] to go to church
[1:02:24] wow
[1:02:28] i feel like there's a few streaming
[1:02:30] things just clicked off
[1:02:38] he said well honey here's sunday morning
[1:02:40] again
[1:02:41] i guess we have to wash up the young
[1:02:43] ones and get down there mine's boresome
[1:02:45] so you're not in love
[1:02:48] but if you're in love
[1:02:50] you can't wait till sunday morning comes
[1:02:54] you just get got to get down there with
[1:02:56] them people of god
[1:02:58] because they don't bore you
[1:03:00] they are your brothers and your sisters
[1:03:03] he said that's the way israel was
[1:03:05] supposed to be but it had become a
[1:03:07] burdensome thing to them this old light
[1:03:09] bread it was angel's bread
[1:03:11] it was the creative power of god they
[1:03:14] were eating
[1:03:17] what do we care about this light bread
[1:03:19] our souls loathe to this stuff
[1:03:20] everything's wrong there's no man that
[1:03:21] falls out every night we rather have
[1:03:23] garlic leak out of egypt
[1:03:27] hey man if they would if they had
[1:03:28] facebook it had been all over facebook
[1:03:32] i'm gonna just be honest with y'all
[1:03:34] y'all have a dangerous preacher up here
[1:03:35] tonight
[1:03:40] amen you see their hearts wasn't ready
[1:03:42] for the journey
[1:03:44] hello somebody their hearts wasn't ready
[1:03:46] for the journey so when a man or a woman
[1:03:48] begins to complain about going to church
[1:03:51] they get so tired of going to church
[1:03:53] they're not ready for the journey
[1:03:55] there's something wrong
[1:03:56] somewhere
[1:03:58] israel in her testing time she got to
[1:04:00] quarreling and fussing with one another
[1:04:02] loathing over the bread and they wanted
[1:04:04] to go back to egypt and they began to
[1:04:06] complain about their leader they was
[1:04:07] afraid he was leading them the wrong
[1:04:09] direction he showed himself already over
[1:04:12] and over he was the leader god had
[1:04:14] proved it but well maybe we're just
[1:04:16] acting a little bit fanatically maybe
[1:04:18] we've started off on the wrong foot see
[1:04:20] there was chatting against god and
[1:04:23] against moses
[1:04:25] god and his leader
[1:04:27] listen when you unders i want you to
[1:04:28] understand sometimes when you speak
[1:04:30] about a man who's delivering his heart
[1:04:32] and it may go a little long
[1:04:35] but you're not chatting against just the
[1:04:37] man you're chatting against the leader
[1:04:39] as well
[1:04:41] amen so we've got to get to a place i
[1:04:43] don't know whether the word means this
[1:04:45] or that i don't know about the holy
[1:04:46] spirit that said we come to this place
[1:04:48] i'm a little skeptic i don't know about
[1:04:50] what others are doing well go on back to
[1:04:52] egypt
[1:04:54] going back to egypt but if you're really
[1:04:56] determined to stay on the road of the
[1:04:59] scriptures
[1:05:00] stay with the pillar of fire stay with
[1:05:03] the holy spirit stay with the word of
[1:05:05] god it'll keep you all the way
[1:05:12] hallelujah
[1:05:13] and don't be afraid of it
[1:05:17] too many people are afraid of the holy
[1:05:19] ghost
[1:05:20] matter of fact but really what they're
[1:05:21] afraid of is how they're going to react
[1:05:24] in the presence of the holy ghost
[1:05:28] he said it won't hurt nothing
[1:05:30] it'll just help you if you are hurt
[1:05:34] mercy i i i was listening to this sermon
[1:05:37] on on the mower the day
[1:05:39] that the day that my mom had passed away
[1:05:46] he said it won't hurt you
[1:05:49] he said oh help you if you are hurt
[1:05:53] it'll heal all the hurts
[1:05:56] the holy spirit will
[1:05:58] oh god let the holy spirit heal our
[1:06:00] hurts
[1:06:02] maybe you've been holding grudges and
[1:06:04] stuff in your heart against somebody
[1:06:06] right now you ought to say lord let the
[1:06:08] holy spirit come over my life
[1:06:10] let me let all that stuff go because you
[1:06:12] can't carry that where we're going
[1:06:16] it'll take you back to egypt you cannot
[1:06:18] take the burdensome of bitterness and
[1:06:20] and anxieties and fears like that and
[1:06:22] things that you've held on from through
[1:06:24] family generation you can't take that
[1:06:26] with you where we're going
[1:06:31] but they found themselves in horeb
[1:06:34] it was a dry place a desert
[1:06:37] and the driest of places
[1:06:40] and the worst of it seemed like
[1:06:42] impossibilities it was going to be a
[1:06:45] place to find water
[1:06:47] he said see when we get out of
[1:06:49] fellowship with one another in church
[1:06:51] and out of fellowship with the holy
[1:06:53] spirit
[1:06:54] it brings us to dry places
[1:06:57] that's why it's important to come to
[1:06:58] church
[1:07:01] he said because you get out in the
[1:07:02] desert nothing's alive everything's got
[1:07:05] stickers
[1:07:06] how many's ever been in the desert
[1:07:09] it seemed like everything in the desert
[1:07:10] to hurt you
[1:07:11] you got stickers of every kind on you
[1:07:13] you don't even have to touch them and
[1:07:15] they'll touch you
[1:07:17] jump right on you
[1:07:19] amen that sounds like some people i know
[1:07:23] been in the desert too long
[1:07:26] he said but see what that was that was a
[1:07:28] precious little tender leaf but it
[1:07:30] hadn't had no water
[1:07:33] so with no water it becomes a dried up
[1:07:35] hardness around it until it's so tight
[1:07:38] it becomes a sticker and when you see
[1:07:40] somebody like that maybe it's a precious
[1:07:42] soul that if they could get some water
[1:07:44] it'd be tender again
[1:07:46] but instead of that it wound itself up
[1:07:48] to it's a sticker and starts punching at
[1:07:50] everything finding fault with everything
[1:07:53] but the only thing it needs is just
[1:07:55] water it just needs a revival a breaking
[1:07:57] up a refreshing from the lord and it'll
[1:08:00] unfold its little self if you'll just
[1:08:02] put it in the water
[1:08:04] and that's where them all that live in
[1:08:06] that place has to suffer in the
[1:08:08] conditions of that place and those who
[1:08:10] desire to live in that kind of
[1:08:11] atmosphere where everything's just
[1:08:13] punching and fussing and quarreling and
[1:08:15] stewing
[1:08:16] you'll just live under that atmosphere
[1:08:17] that's all we don't have to live but you
[1:08:19] don't have to live there and it's
[1:08:21] definitely not necessary to stay there
[1:08:26] this horub was a place where god was
[1:08:28] discouraged with people because they had
[1:08:30] wandered
[1:08:31] they'd moved around
[1:08:33] went the wrong way and bickering and
[1:08:35] fighting and fussing and moaning and
[1:08:37] groaning
[1:08:39] he brings them to this place
[1:08:42] he says brother brandon said it would be
[1:08:44] a beautiful lesson for us
[1:08:47] he said because we can get so out of
[1:08:49] cater
[1:08:51] and so world bound
[1:08:53] and it will cause god to take the
[1:08:55] judgments of the world and to smite his
[1:08:57] own son with it at calvary that we might
[1:09:00] go free
[1:09:05] now in order for them people to get some
[1:09:06] water after they got over there it was
[1:09:08] this dry place was made of calvary and
[1:09:11] there god told moses they said take a
[1:09:13] rod
[1:09:14] go up there and stop standing with you
[1:09:15] on the rock
[1:09:17] and this rock was christ
[1:09:20] and moses with that rod when he brought
[1:09:22] the judgment upon the nation of israel
[1:09:24] took the same rod and smote the
[1:09:26] judgments of god upon the rock he took
[1:09:28] the sins of the people onto this rod
[1:09:30] which
[1:09:31] should have smote the people but instead
[1:09:33] of smiting the people he smoked the rock
[1:09:37] oh hallelujah and the rock through a
[1:09:39] work of god brought salvation to a
[1:09:41] perishing people that was dying without
[1:09:44] water
[1:09:46] and that's what god did when he took his
[1:09:48] wand of judgment and he wound up my sins
[1:09:51] and your sins and he wound him around
[1:09:54] his rod and he struck christ and from
[1:09:57] him might come forth waters which means
[1:09:59] his spirit
[1:10:01] the holy ghost might be released from
[1:10:03] his body
[1:10:05] that we could have life
[1:10:08] dried and stagnated and hardened
[1:10:12] there was some of you that were so
[1:10:14] hardened in your life you thought
[1:10:15] there'd be no way you'd ever live for
[1:10:17] god
[1:10:20] but god didn't take the rod and smite
[1:10:22] you
[1:10:22] he took the rod and smote the rock
[1:10:26] so that waters could come trickling down
[1:10:28] in the
[1:10:29] and over into texas and up in arkansas
[1:10:31] and down in louisiana the holy spirit
[1:10:34] trickling into homes and places amen to
[1:10:36] where you thought there ain't no hope
[1:10:37] for me ain't no way i could ever make it
[1:10:40] but god didn't smite you he smoked the
[1:10:42] rock
[1:10:43] and out of it came the spirit of god and
[1:10:46] it began to woo over your life and here
[1:10:48] you're in this hardened condition and
[1:10:49] little droplets began to fall on you
[1:10:52] and god began to minister moisture into
[1:10:55] your life to where you could open up and
[1:10:57] you could become exactly what god wanted
[1:11:00] you to be in the first place
[1:11:03] hallelujah from the waters of life
[1:11:08] brother randall said i've seen so many
[1:11:09] intellectual drawings
[1:11:11] listen to intellectual drawings
[1:11:13] so one of the most critical ones i ever
[1:11:15] seen was this little rock laying on top
[1:11:18] of a hillside and moses was supposed to
[1:11:20] have smitten and israel was down there
[1:11:22] with a tea cup getting a drink out of a
[1:11:25] little sprinkle that fell down from this
[1:11:27] rock
[1:11:28] he said now that's just somebody's idea
[1:11:30] but when this rock
[1:11:32] broke forth its waters there was over 2
[1:11:35] million people besides ox camels and
[1:11:38] everything else that drank in the tubs
[1:11:40] of water that come from it it was a
[1:11:42] gushing stream
[1:11:45] it was showing it was signifying
[1:11:46] something his holy spirit is not just a
[1:11:49] little sprinkle here and a sprinkle
[1:11:51] there and a sprinkle here it's a gusher
[1:11:54] it's a moving of the holy ghost it's a
[1:11:57] it's a mighty flowing river
[1:12:01] listen you might can't stand still under
[1:12:03] a sprinkle but you're getting a flowing
[1:12:05] river you can't
[1:12:06] stand you can't stand against it it'll
[1:12:09] move you it'll touch you it'll do things
[1:12:11] to you amen it'll it'll uh it'll do
[1:12:14] things in your life amen why because
[1:12:16] it's a moving stream of life
[1:12:20] it'll make you act in ways you never
[1:12:22] thought you would act it'd make you
[1:12:24] shout it'll make you dance it'll make
[1:12:26] you speak in tongues because it's not
[1:12:28] just a little sprinkle on the top of
[1:12:29] your head it's a gusher of the holy
[1:12:31] ghost
[1:12:33] it's god moving through his people and
[1:12:35] changing lives forever
[1:12:37] listen you don't have to come to church
[1:12:39] with a teacup and just worry about
[1:12:41] you're gonna get something tonight god's
[1:12:43] got something for you every service he
[1:12:46] got something for you every day he got
[1:12:48] something all you got to do is say god i
[1:12:50] want another drink
[1:12:53] i want more of you
[1:12:54] [Applause]
[1:12:59] amen
[1:13:02] and he's never going to run out
[1:13:08] that's the way they try to make christ
[1:13:10] the holy spirit just a little sprinkle
[1:13:13] just enough
[1:13:14] to make you believe there's a god
[1:13:18] but it's an abundance of water
[1:13:21] my cup runneth over
[1:13:23] it's a gusher of the holy spirit
[1:13:26] but people are afraid of it now listen
[1:13:28] what he says he said well i'm a little
[1:13:30] afraid i'll do this or that or if i
[1:13:31] happen to go a little too deep
[1:13:33] i can show you someone that went too far
[1:13:36] he said true but you'll never but you
[1:13:38] never point to one that didn't go far
[1:13:41] enough
[1:13:44] how about the just about you only want
[1:13:45] to point to those that go far too far
[1:13:47] but why don't you just look at those
[1:13:48] that don't go far enough he said we've
[1:13:50] had some people that got into the flesh
[1:13:53] and got on the wrong foot
[1:13:55] because of that
[1:13:56] because of not good leadership and so
[1:13:58] forth they continued on that foot and
[1:14:00] they went into fanaticism he said then
[1:14:03] the whole world the devil points to them
[1:14:04] and says see that see that fanaticism he
[1:14:07] said let me stand this morning and point
[1:14:10] back to the tens of million times more
[1:14:13] than that never even made a start
[1:14:20] oh my goodness
[1:14:23] you know that's what they want to do at
[1:14:25] our youth camps they want to point to
[1:14:26] fanaticism and when they don't they come
[1:14:28] back and they don't do this and they
[1:14:30] don't they don't know they're so
[1:14:31] confused
[1:14:33] well they don't point to any and their
[1:14:34] meetings that don't even make a start
[1:14:40] criticizing and making fun
[1:14:42] and carrying on i don't have time for it
[1:14:46] because i'm not going to look at those
[1:14:47] that don't take make a start i'm going
[1:14:48] to look at those as making a start and
[1:14:50] going on with jesus
[1:14:53] sure they may get off on the wrong foot
[1:14:56] but what was it that started them down
[1:14:58] that path
[1:14:59] it was a movement of the holy ghost
[1:15:11] people want to you know they want to
[1:15:12] clamp down on our services and and they
[1:15:15] up in that area especially want to clamp
[1:15:16] down on worship
[1:15:18] and clamp down and and things of of the
[1:15:20] holy ghost and say it ain't soul
[1:15:26] or you can have your sprinkle
[1:15:29] i'll take the gusher
[1:15:34] you can have what you want all you want
[1:15:36] but i'm going to have all i want
[1:15:39] if that's as far as you want to go fine
[1:15:42] i'm happy for you i wish you'd go
[1:15:44] further but i'm going on with jesus
[1:15:50] amen
[1:15:52] he said
[1:15:53] some people has upon their hearts and
[1:15:55] mind that all israel drank and they
[1:15:57] packed up their camels and tied their
[1:15:58] hitches on their horses and so forth and
[1:16:00] took their kids and journeyed on
[1:16:01] somewhere else and left the rock there
[1:16:04] wrong the rock followed them
[1:16:07] the water followed them oh my goodness
[1:16:10] oh listen young people you ain't got to
[1:16:11] worry about that you left that rock up
[1:16:13] there in ohio
[1:16:15] amen you that's here tonight you ain't
[1:16:17] got to worry about it the rock was here
[1:16:18] sunday no it's there where they're with
[1:16:20] you every day
[1:16:22] amen it ain't you following the rock the
[1:16:25] rock is following you
[1:16:27] oh he said what a beautiful type the
[1:16:29] beautiful hole and the anchor for the
[1:16:31] believer that knows that that rock that
[1:16:33] was once smitten that water that once
[1:16:35] poured from calvary goes with us
[1:16:38] wherever we are
[1:16:40] it's not go back to a certain place or
[1:16:43] go to a certain camp i'll say or to a
[1:16:46] certain church but he's with you
[1:16:48] wherever you go
[1:16:49] we did have water day before yesterday
[1:16:52] we got water right today
[1:16:54] because the rock is christ and he's the
[1:16:57] same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:02] that rock followed israel they never
[1:17:04] followed the rock the rock followed them
[1:17:08] israel would go on their journey and
[1:17:10] have one thing to do keep a straight
[1:17:12] course go to the promised land the rock
[1:17:14] was following them and the water was in
[1:17:16] the rock was with them god took the
[1:17:19] judgments and placed them on christ did
[1:17:20] you notice there was a cleft in the rock
[1:17:22] from then on a scar in his side the rock
[1:17:26] that it had clefts where moses smoted
[1:17:28] christ had a cleft he was wounded for
[1:17:30] our trans christian and by his stripes
[1:17:33] were healed and from that life comes
[1:17:35] waters of life that we so enjoy today he
[1:17:38] said the life of christ stays with the
[1:17:41] church
[1:17:43] christ does not leave the church
[1:17:47] i'll be with you always
[1:17:50] even to the end of the world
[1:17:52] i'll never leave you forsake you it's
[1:17:54] the people that leaves christ
[1:17:57] not christ leaving the church
[1:18:03] because the bible plainly says
[1:18:05] the rock and water followed israel
[1:18:10] the same god that goes with this church
[1:18:12] this morning let's drink from this
[1:18:14] fountain
[1:18:15] wherever you make a footstep
[1:18:18] god will be right there
[1:18:20] the rock will be right with you the
[1:18:22] water that gives you the life is still
[1:18:24] there i'll be with you even at the end
[1:18:25] of the age he said people in the testing
[1:18:28] times drop away like israel did they
[1:18:30] think god's left them
[1:18:33] but the rock never left israel israel
[1:18:35] left the rock
[1:18:37] so if you find yourself without god and
[1:18:39] go back to where you left him
[1:18:45] it was right there went right with them
[1:18:47] to the end of the road it followed them
[1:18:50] and i love this part i shouted
[1:18:53] on my lawnmower
[1:18:56] it was never out of speaking distance
[1:19:00] it wasn't out of here in distance
[1:19:03] and it wasn't out of sea and distance
[1:19:05] and neither is christ with the church
[1:19:07] today he is never
[1:19:10] i say never out of speaking distance
[1:19:14] whenever you have need of water from the
[1:19:17] rock say god i want another drink
[1:19:22] hey you know how to cure a hangover take
[1:19:24] another drink
[1:19:26] hey man you know how to go you just get
[1:19:27] drunk all over again that's what a good
[1:19:29] drunk does amen why because we're not
[1:19:32] even worried about whoever makes the
[1:19:34] beer we're not without him on that
[1:19:35] because they're going to run out one of
[1:19:36] these days and it's going to burn in
[1:19:37] hell but we have an inexhaustible
[1:19:40] fountain of life
[1:19:44] take another drink
[1:19:46] he said well brother timothy i i feel a
[1:19:48] little down since they got off the bus
[1:19:50] take another drink
[1:19:55] i ain't talking about drinking facebook
[1:19:58] and instagram
[1:20:00] and whatever you've been drinking on
[1:20:02] before it's time to kick them drinks to
[1:20:04] the curb
[1:20:06] put them out and let the trashman take

[1:20:39] him
[1:20:42] god is waiting for you to call on him
[1:20:44] you're never out of speaking distance
[1:20:48] though we've done wrong we've sinned
[1:20:49] we've turned our backs we've done things
[1:20:51] we ought not to do yet he's still with
[1:20:53] us
[1:20:58] man that ought to shut that devil's
[1:20:59] mouth up when he tells you god's left
[1:21:01] you
[1:21:03] god cannot leave you because his word
[1:21:05] says he won't
[1:21:07] matter of fact his word says i'm
[1:21:09] following you
[1:21:11] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:21:14] me all the days of my life
[1:21:17] amen he's not just with you at a camp

[1:21:21] service he's with you every day of your
[1:21:24] life he's with you in your dark places
[1:21:26] he's with you in the hallways he's with
[1:21:28] you in your bedroom he's with you no
[1:21:30] matter where you may go
[1:21:34] tell the devil to shut up
[1:21:36] my god is with me

[1:21:41] and when i have a need all i got to say
[1:21:44] is god i have a need and take another
[1:21:47] drink
[1:21:52] hallelujah that is alive and devil
[1:21:56] god has never left you alone in your
[1:21:58] bedroom god has never left you alone on
[1:22:00] your job god has never left you alone
[1:22:03] anywhere
[1:22:05] his word says he followed him to a
[1:22:07] desert place
[1:22:09] he followed them through hills and
[1:22:11] valleys and every kind of things he went
[1:22:13] through he was right there with them
[1:22:18] mercy
[1:22:20] when they got thirsty
[1:22:22] they knew the water was near
[1:22:26] oh my
[1:22:28] when you begin to think about the power
[1:22:31] that has been revealed in this day
[1:22:34] and the word that has come down in this
[1:22:36] day
[1:22:38] and all the things that jesus did
[1:22:40] and how he worked
[1:22:42] and how he fulfilled things in his life
[1:22:45] you think he's going to get down to this
[1:22:47] place
[1:22:48] say see you later
[1:22:53] my power ain't big enough it ain't
[1:22:55] strong enough
[1:22:58] it ain't it ain't gonna be a hug
[1:23:04] i to skip a few things here
[1:23:08] but israel lost their faith
[1:23:11] they got off the path to begin to lust
[1:23:13] after the flesh pots
[1:23:15] they'd stay with faith believing that
[1:23:17] god was going to take them to the land
[1:23:20] there would have been nothing hinder
[1:23:21] them
[1:23:24] he had already opened up the seas
[1:23:26] plagues had fell upon their enemies
[1:23:28] their enemies was dead laying behind
[1:23:30] them
[1:23:31] walking over into the land still
[1:23:33] couldn't have faith to go onto the
[1:23:34] promise
[1:23:35] but joshua and caleb said
[1:23:37] we're more than able
[1:23:42] so i told brother ray i said brother ray
[1:23:44] brother ray erickson he's i believe in
[1:23:45] his in his 80s you wouldn't know it
[1:23:49] just a
[1:23:50] courageous heart
[1:23:52] a line
[1:23:54] that has stood against
[1:23:56] formulism and every kind of spirit of
[1:23:58] hell that wants to come steal the
[1:23:59] worship out of churches
[1:24:02] and the praise of god the shout of the
[1:24:04] king in the camp has stood sometimes
[1:24:06] seemingly by himself but stood
[1:24:10] and i told him i walked up to him at the
[1:24:11] end of those meetings or sometimes right
[1:24:13] there maybe in the middle of it wherever
[1:24:16] and i said brother ray i want to thank
[1:24:17] you
[1:24:18] for being a true caleb
[1:24:21] if i've ever seen one in my life it's
[1:24:23] you
[1:24:25] that'll look at all this and say boys
[1:24:27] we're more than able
[1:24:30] we're not just able we're more than able
[1:24:39] we've got to have that heart
[1:24:41] we've got to look into these things and
[1:24:43] realize hey the world's getting worse
[1:24:45] and things are going on and things are
[1:24:47] crumbling very quickly and it seems like
[1:24:50] things are getting tighter and tighter
[1:24:52] and
[1:24:53] anxiety is getting more and more fear
[1:24:55] more and more
[1:24:57] demons on every hand more and more
[1:24:59] we've still got to look at and say we're
[1:25:01] more than able
[1:25:03] because he gave me the faith to stand up
[1:25:06] out of the muck of this world
[1:25:08] and put me up on a rock and i know he
[1:25:10] didn't do all this to leave me
[1:25:13] i know he didn't do all what he's done
[1:25:15] to go off somewhere in the wild blue
[1:25:17] yonder and say have a good time no he's
[1:25:19] there with us he's fighting every step
[1:25:21] of the way he's the lord the man of war
[1:25:24] he's god rich in mercy he's going to
[1:25:27] reach down to the lowest of places and
[1:25:30] down in that mario clay where that last
[1:25:32] seed is he's ready to reach down and
[1:25:35] grab it out and say children it's time
[1:25:37] to go home
[1:25:39] amen we got to be ready because that
[1:25:41] rock is walking with us and we're going
[1:25:43] to continue to drink from the rock of
[1:25:45] eternal life and it's going to continue
[1:25:47] to work in our bodies until we take
[1:25:50] every inheritance that god has given the
[1:25:53] church of the living god and there's got
[1:25:55] to be men
[1:25:57] that'll say we're more than able
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:01] back off terrible you're not coming into
[1:26:03] this place
[1:26:08] got to be men that say not we will be we
[1:26:11] are now sons of daughters of god
[1:26:13] and the ever-living presence of the holy
[1:26:16] ghost is with us
[1:26:19] there's got to be men that'll stand for
[1:26:22] the holy ghost baptism
[1:26:25] for the experience to come into a heart
[1:26:27] to change them
[1:26:30] brother william he found out brother ray
[1:26:32] stood for that
[1:26:34] amen he looked over at him and said i
[1:26:36] feel to go over there and tell him he
[1:26:37] didn't really know who he was at the
[1:26:39] time brother ray hadn't been up on the
[1:26:40] front you know his grandson is running
[1:26:42] the camp and things pretty much and
[1:26:44] other ministers he's in the back so not
[1:26:46] everybody would know who he was
[1:26:49] and he's come to the front and praying
[1:26:50] for the needs on a friday night brother
[1:26:52] william feels it to my heart i need to
[1:26:53] go to him and say i need the holy ghost
[1:26:56] he found out that man believed in the
[1:26:58] holy ghost
[1:26:59] he lived he believed in the experience
[1:27:02] that it took to receive it he believed
[1:27:04] amen just as brother brandon would talk
[1:27:06] about the smiting of that rock was a a
[1:27:09] symbol of or or significant to the holy
[1:27:12] spirit coming out of him and coming on
[1:27:15] the day of pentecost
[1:27:16] and he said we don't have to smite it
[1:27:18] again the first time it was smith it'll
[1:27:20] work every time
[1:27:23] amen but you just got to go back and
[1:27:25] take original drink of the original
[1:27:28] power
[1:27:31] and i don't mean go back as to go back 2
[1:27:33] 000 years ago i mean go back to that
[1:27:35] same source that they went to
[1:27:41] when that holy ghost come out of him on
[1:27:43] calvary
[1:27:44] came back on the church on the day of
[1:27:46] pentecost the same holy ghost is present
[1:27:48] this morning it's that rock followed the
[1:27:51] church all the way down through the
[1:27:53] church ages
[1:27:54] amen it went all the way down it give us
[1:27:57] a promise that's a reason walking before
[1:27:58] the sick people when he commissioned me
[1:28:00] yonder i believed it god said so that's
[1:28:03] how visions have happened god promised
[1:28:05] it god cannot lie believe it you got to
[1:28:07] believe it god
[1:28:08] got to be something there to open that
[1:28:10] damper to open that thing to let you in
[1:28:13] on it what we need today is not pray for
[1:28:15] more power he said you got enough power
[1:28:17] to make a new earth what we need is
[1:28:19] faith to use that power what you need is
[1:28:21] to control that life and live such a
[1:28:23] godly life that when you ask god
[1:28:25] anything you know
[1:28:28] he'll bring it to pass we have
[1:28:30] confidence of god of that we know if we
[1:28:32] keep his commandments he will withhold
[1:28:34] no good thing from us if we walk with
[1:28:36] him and god is walking with us
[1:28:40] stay the course
[1:28:42] they had they had the pillar of fire
[1:28:45] to keep the core stay with the pillar of
[1:28:47] fire
[1:28:48] stay with it
[1:28:50] we stay with the word
[1:28:52] and the word will produce the signs
[1:28:55] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[1:28:57] that belief
[1:28:58] they wandered off israel wandered off
[1:29:00] wandered off the path and they lost
[1:29:02] their water supply
[1:29:04] and he said i wonder if that ain't what
[1:29:06] the church has done today
[1:29:08] they wandered off the path
[1:29:10] and they've lost
[1:29:11] they go into isms and they've adopted
[1:29:13] things and they adopted apostle creeds
[1:29:15] and where do you find that in the bible
[1:29:18] they adopted catechisms and adopted
[1:29:20] denominations instead of an experience
[1:29:23] they adopted shaken hands instead of a
[1:29:25] born-again experience they adopted
[1:29:27] sprinkling instead of water baptism they
[1:29:30] opted they adopted an evil form father
[1:29:32] son and holy ghost when there's no such
[1:29:34] a thing as the bible it's in the name of
[1:29:36] jesus christ there's one thing to do if
[1:29:38] you want the same water come back to the
[1:29:40] same path and get back on it he ain't
[1:29:43] left he's still there
[1:29:46] but we'll take creeds instead of christ
[1:29:52] we don't want it
[1:29:54] you know they don't want tongues
[1:29:56] they won't they don't want shouting
[1:29:58] spells
[1:30:00] they don't want none of that
[1:30:02] but it's in there
[1:30:07] they want some dried eye confession
[1:30:10] organized a little bit but they lose
[1:30:12] their water that's exactly what
[1:30:13] pentecost did they begin to organize
[1:30:16] they begin to break up fellowship
[1:30:19] we can't fellowship with you because you
[1:30:20] don't sing the same songs we say
[1:30:26] you don't believe the same thing we
[1:30:27] believe
[1:30:29] and they begin to cut off fellowship
[1:30:33] but they've lost their water
[1:30:41] i'll just say it
[1:30:43] somebody said why i don't think i've
[1:30:45] ever seen two ministers stand so hard
[1:30:46] against formalism and
[1:30:49] starchness and
[1:30:51] and stand so strong for worship than we
[1:30:52] have in this last weekend a meeting
[1:30:54] somebody was telling brother wayne
[1:30:56] he said well he said do you not know
[1:30:58] where you're at
[1:31:00] he said these men got poked in their eye
[1:31:02] by that nonsense they was ready to fight
[1:31:08] i had a young man come running to me at
[1:31:09] the end of the service he said i was one
[1:31:11] of them exactly what you were talking
[1:31:13] about
[1:31:14] where i thought i had it all figured out
[1:31:17] and we was taking this song out and we
[1:31:18] was taking that song out we was taking
[1:31:20] this out
[1:31:23] he said i didn't realize how bad a shape
[1:31:25] i was in until god come down in a moment
[1:31:28] and supernaturally delivered me
[1:31:31] and he said i want to be a voice to you
[1:31:33] brother timothy that says thank you
[1:31:36] thank you for preaching this he said
[1:31:37] even though i've been delivered by such
[1:31:39] a supernatural visitation he said that
[1:31:42] spirit still tries to come back
[1:31:45] and he says try to come into every
[1:31:46] church around here and try to push its
[1:31:48] way in he says stand with against it
[1:31:50] with all your heart he said because i'm
[1:31:52] one of them that's set free
[1:32:02] he knew what it was like to be thirsty
[1:32:04] [Applause]
[1:32:06] he knew what it was like to not have
[1:32:08] water and once he got a drink of it
[1:32:12] oh hallelujah some of you also you know
[1:32:15] what it was like out in the world you
[1:32:17] try to quench your thirst with every
[1:32:18] kind of thing out there we can name a
[1:32:19] whole bunch of stuff but when you found
[1:32:21] this water
[1:32:24] you found something that could quench
[1:32:26] the most inward desire of your heart
[1:32:28] this is what i've been longing for this
[1:32:30] is what i've been wanting this is what
[1:32:32] i've been desiring i've been looking for
[1:32:34] this
[1:32:36] and it changed everything
[1:32:41] and you spoke and you said this is that
[1:32:45] this is my heart's desire this is what i
[1:32:48] wanted and i said god i want another
[1:32:50] tree
[1:33:00] christ was smitten once he said that's
[1:33:02] that original experience that's that
[1:33:04] original way on the day of pentecost
[1:33:06] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:33:09] in the name of jesus christ
[1:33:11] he said there is no other way
[1:33:16] musicians can come
[1:33:22] he said every man in the bible was
[1:33:23] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:33:25] every man in the bible that's got the
[1:33:26] holy ghost come god's way exactly the
[1:33:29] same thing
[1:33:30] they had the same experience the same
[1:33:33] signs following them the same works
[1:33:35] followed them they lived by the rock
[1:33:38] they got the same water
[1:33:43] mercy so much stuff here
[1:33:46] but you have been put
[1:33:49] in an inexhaustible fountain of life
[1:33:53] you don't ever have to worry about him
[1:33:54] running out of water
[1:33:56] you don't have to ever worry about him
[1:33:57] running out of refreshing from the
[1:33:58] presence of god
[1:34:02] you don't have to have to take it easy
[1:34:03] on service because you're afraid it may
[1:34:05] not be there nick no
[1:34:07] drink
[1:34:09] drink
[1:34:10] here's what brother brown will talk
[1:34:11] about the inexhaustible he said when you
[1:34:13] plant a tree
[1:34:15] in the ground the only thing he has to
[1:34:17] do is drink
[1:34:19] and when it goes to drinking it has to
[1:34:21] drink more than its portion
[1:34:24] and it begins to drink and drink and
[1:34:26] drink
[1:34:27] you know it is when you plant them you
[1:34:28] gotta water them like crazy
[1:34:32] keep watering it
[1:34:34] some of your new christians
[1:34:36] started on a new path keep watering it
[1:34:38] keep drinking
[1:34:40] listen to sermons listen read your bible
[1:34:43] pray fellowship together around goodly
[1:34:45] things
[1:34:46] godly things
[1:34:49] keep drinking
[1:34:51] the more you drink the more it pushes
[1:34:53] out
[1:34:54] is that's the way we are we're planted
[1:34:56] in christ jesus through the
[1:34:57] inexhaustible fountain of life and we
[1:35:00] start drinking the more we drink the
[1:35:01] more you'll push out
[1:35:03] it'll bring out all the elements of
[1:35:04] christ
[1:35:06] and all the elements that's in that tree
[1:35:08] that ever was in you is already in you
[1:35:11] the gift that god has called you to the
[1:35:13] trouble of his you won't drink
[1:35:15] don't you believe he's in the entire
[1:35:17] inexhaustible fountain of life come to
[1:35:19] me all ye into the world and drink
[1:35:22] the devil don't care how much you count
[1:35:25] as long as you don't drink
[1:35:29] it could care less how many times you
[1:35:30] walk into this door
[1:35:32] if you're not drinking
[1:35:33] [Music]
[1:35:36] if you're not feeding on the word
[1:35:38] he could care less
[1:35:43] there's a fountain open
[1:35:45] flowing freely
[1:35:47] just drink till you can't drink no more
[1:35:55] i've seen what it'll do to somebody that
[1:35:56] really gets a drink
[1:36:03] we go to another one
[1:36:05] he says could you imagine talking about
[1:36:07] the inexhaustible god and exhausting
[1:36:09] god's love
[1:36:10] talking about exhausting god's love and
[1:36:12] power and beneficiaries
[1:36:14] could you imagine a little bitty fish
[1:36:16] out in the middle of oceans out now wait
[1:36:17] a minute i better consider something
[1:36:20] here
[1:36:21] about to drink this water sparingly
[1:36:23] because i might run out
[1:36:25] a little fish in the middle of a big
[1:36:26] ocean
[1:36:27] he said that could easily more easily be
[1:36:30] done
[1:36:30] than you can ask too much of god
[1:36:35] he's the inexhaustible fountain of life
[1:36:38] whatever you have need of ask him and
[1:36:40] believe it he provided in the redemptive
[1:36:42] blessings when he died at calvary and
[1:36:44] gave a promise to you for everything you
[1:36:46] ever need have need of between here and
[1:36:48] in the journey it's yours if you'll ask
[1:36:51] could you imagine a little mouse saying
[1:36:53] well i can only eat so many grains a day
[1:36:55] because i'm going to run out and he's in
[1:36:56] the great gardens of egypt he said
[1:36:58] that's the way people act as christians

[1:37:09] i've ate my grain i've done my religion
[1:37:11] for the day
[1:37:12] you're afraid of running out
[1:37:15] he said i like to lay down
[1:37:18] and drink a while he said just have a
[1:37:20] real spiritual gastronomical jubilee
[1:37:24] just drink till you just can't drink no
[1:37:26] more
[1:37:28] he said why don't you do that tonight
