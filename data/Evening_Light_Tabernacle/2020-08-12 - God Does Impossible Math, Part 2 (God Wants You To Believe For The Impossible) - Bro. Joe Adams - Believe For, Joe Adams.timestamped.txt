[12:38] a god who meets our needs
[12:40] we have sister sharon baxter she's
[12:42] feeling a lot better but
[12:44] just haven't yet they had to put a stint
[12:46] in her kidney from that big stone that

[12:50] in the next few weeks how much your
[12:51] kidney is still working
[12:53] amen i know a god who restores kidneys
[12:56] amen the devil can put a blockage there
[12:59] but god can
[13:00] renew it all over again amen we're just
[13:03] going to believe for complete
[13:05] delivery we have brother james sister
[13:07] ruth wilson that's homesick sister naomi
[13:10] wilson that's homesick
[13:13] that has actually tested positive for
[13:15] the coven
[13:16] and so we want to remember them today i
[13:18] know the world and the devil wants to
[13:20] put it on you that you're
[13:22] something that that's not worth you're
[13:24] not a worthy person if you get the kobe
[13:25] but the cope is nothing different than
[13:27] any other cold or sickening
[13:29] it's a devil and it's a tormenting
[13:30] spirit amen and so we're just going to
[13:33] call him out on the streets tonight and
[13:35] shoot him
[13:36] amen and so uh we just believe the lord
[13:39] has got a blood for that
[13:41] and his healing virtues has paid the
[13:43] price for that

[14:06] figure out what is going on with him
[14:09] doing tests on him and so he'd been put

[35:02] mountain is here tonight
[35:04] the same presence is here tonight the
[35:07] same god of the old is the same god
[35:09] that's here tonight
[35:11] that's not a cliche that's not something
[35:13] that we look back on
[35:14] that's something that we believe each
[35:15] and every day every morning you wake up
[35:18] you got to believe that the god of the
[35:19] old testament is the god of the new
[35:21] and he's the god of the now oh it's not
[35:24] so much just being a god of history we
[35:25] don't need a god of history
[35:27] we need a present tense god and i'm here
[35:29] to talk to you tonight about a god that
[35:31] is here
[35:32] a god that is doing the miraculous in
[35:34] our midst
[35:35] i want to speak to you tonight on god
[35:37] does impossible math part two
[35:39] but i want to bring it down god wants
[35:42] you to believe
[35:43] for the impossible last time we spoke we
[35:46] talked about how great god is and
[35:48] how god does the miraculous and how he
[35:50] they'll just be able to just
[35:52] move in our midst and he does so many
[35:54] things and many times we take our human
[35:56] element
[35:57] and we take ourselves out of the
[35:58] equation but god wants you to believe
[36:01] that you can do the impossible and he
[36:03] wants you to believe
[36:05] for the impossible so i ask you tonight
[36:07] how many you gotta need tonight
[36:09] and it seems impossible you're facing a
[36:11] mountain tonight and it seems like you
[36:13] can't get over you can't get around it
[36:15] you can't get through it but i'm here to
[36:16] tell you tonight about a god that says
[36:18] you can
[36:19] not only did he says you can he says you
[36:21] already have done it
[36:22] because we've already been seen in a
[36:24] vision
[36:25] hey man i feel like preaching tonight so
[36:27] i hope you're with me
[36:29] we find here in luke 1 and chapter luke
[36:33] 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month
[36:36] the angel gabriel was sent from god into
[36:39] a city of galilee named nazareth
[36:41] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[36:43] was joseph
[36:44] of the house of david and the virgin's
[36:46] name was mary
[36:48] and the angel came unto her and he said
[36:50] hell thou art highly favored and the
[36:52] lord is with thee
[36:54] blessed art thou among women
[36:57] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[36:59] his saying
[37:00] and cast in her mind what manner of
[37:03] salutation this should be
[37:05] and the angel said unto her fear not
[37:08] mary for thou
[37:09] has found favor with god oh i'll tell
[37:12] you i'm here talking about another
[37:14] virgin in the end time
[37:15] that's found favor with god oh and he
[37:18] stepped out of the regions of the
[37:20] the most high and he stepped out of
[37:22] glory and he's come down in this tower
[37:24] and he said hell little bride thou art
[37:26] highly favored
[37:27] he's not looking through the hedges and
[37:29] highways to find that mistress or to
[37:31] find that one he's found or right here
[37:34] in the end time he believing people that
[37:36] stood by
[37:37] and listened to the word of god come
[37:39] forth
[37:41] oh i love this and behold thou shalt
[37:44] conceive in thy womb and bring forth a
[37:46] son
[37:46] and thou shalt call his name jesus and
[37:49] he shall be
[37:50] great and shall be called the son of the
[37:51] highest and the lord god shall give unto
[37:54] him the throne of his father david
[37:56] and he shall reign over the house of
[37:57] jacob forever and
[37:59] and his kingdom there shall be no end
[38:02] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[38:04] these things be
[38:05] seeing that i know not a man and the
[38:08] angel answered and said unto her the
[38:10] holy ghost shall come upon thee
[38:12] and the power of the highest shall
[38:14] overshadow thee
[38:15] therefore also the holy thing we shall
[38:18] be born of thee
[38:19] shall be called the son of god and
[38:22] behold thy cousin elizabeth
[38:23] she hath also conceived in her old age
[38:26] and this is a six month with her who was
[38:28] called barren
[38:29] verse 37 for with god nothing shall be
[38:33] impossible
[38:35] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[38:37] lord
[38:38] be it unto me according to thy word
[38:43] and the angel departed from her you can
[38:46] have your seats tonight
[38:54] i have a list of some names
[38:58] of some needs but not only did i make
[39:02] this list just to put it on paper but i
[39:04] made it because i believe god's going to
[39:05] move into miraculous
[39:07] some of you here tonight are on this
[39:08] list some of you out there in the stream
[39:10] atlanta are on this list tonight
[39:12] but i'm believing that god's going to do
[39:15] something
[39:16] we've come way too far to ex to not
[39:19] expect anything from god
[39:22] we find here that this word impossible
[39:25] means unable to be or unable to exist
[39:28] unable to be true
[39:30] and you know what the devil's propaganda
[39:32] is to get that in your mind you can't
[39:34] overcome
[39:35] you can't do this you can't do that
[39:37] you've got to stay sick there's no
[39:39] healing virtue in the word
[39:40] there's no healing for you it's for
[39:42] somebody else and he's come
[39:44] and he's come time and time again and
[39:46] he's riddled your mind with propaganda
[39:49] and he's riddled your mind with doubts
[39:50] and he's riddled your mind with lies
[39:52] and he's got you into a prison of fear
[39:54] he's got you into a prison of doubt
[39:56] he's got you in a prison of unbelief and
[39:59] you can't break out but i'm here to tell
[40:00] you tonight
[40:01] house of hell you got to give way to the
[40:03] name of jesus
[40:04] because at the name of jesus every knee
[40:07] shall bow
[40:07] every tongue shall confess every demon
[40:10] has to fall before the almighty god
[40:12] and we're gonna tell you tonight about a
[40:13] living god and he's expecting a people
[40:16] tonight
[40:16] to believe for the impossible the devil
[40:19] says it's impossible for you to get out
[40:21] the devil says it's impossible you to be
[40:23] healed but god said i've already healed
[40:25] you
[40:25] by my strength you are healed
[40:31] you know that's how the jews got sent to
[40:34] concentration camps
[40:36] because the propaganda of the nazi army
[40:38] propaganda
[40:39] their propaganda turned to countries in
[40:42] which the jews were living in
[40:44] against them their friends were turned
[40:47] against them
[40:48] the government officials were turned
[40:50] against them and i'm here to tell you
[40:52] satan's doing everything he can
[40:53] to turn this world against you and he's
[40:56] succeeding
[40:58] but i want you to know that's not the
[41:00] end of the story oh
[41:02] no god has got some allies god has got
[41:05] some sons of god out there
[41:07] and he's got some sons of gods out there
[41:09] all through the world and what are they
[41:10] doing they got a mission
[41:11] we got to free those that are oppressed
[41:14] we got to break through there
[41:15] and let them know there's a land beyond
[41:17] the river there's a god that heals
[41:19] there's a god that saves
[41:21] there's a god that sets free there's a
[41:23] god that does the impossible
[41:27] i just believe it tonight i love how the
[41:31] prophet would
[41:31] take us back into time as we look at
[41:34] this story of mary because you may think
[41:36] well
[41:36] well this is an unlikely text to preach
[41:38] on god wants you to believe for the
[41:40] impossible
[41:41] what we find here brother brown was
[41:43] saying a spring sun was
[41:44] rising in the judean skies his little
[41:47] mary started down the road with her
[41:48] water pot
[41:50] underneath her arm going to get her
[41:51] water
[41:53] and you know what she was in her
[41:54] youthful mind just thinking about the
[41:56] day before and
[41:57] you know the day before she went to
[41:58] church went to the synagogue her
[42:01] and joseph and they listened to him a
[42:04] great sermon there by the rabbi
[42:06] and the rabbi was talking to him about
[42:08] you know how
[42:09] god had moved upon abraham's heart and
[42:11] said abraham i'm going to take you to a
[42:12] land
[42:13] and i'm going to multiply you and your
[42:15] seeds are gonna be like the sands of the
[42:17] of the seashore and they're gonna be
[42:19] innumerable and they just talked about
[42:20] how great god was and
[42:22] how marvelous god was and how when
[42:24] daniel was stoned into the lions then
[42:26] he shut the mouths of the lions how in
[42:28] the hebrew children were thrown into a
[42:30] fiery furnace
[42:31] he came down as a fourth man and he
[42:33] talked about how shamgar
[42:34] with the little ox gold had a bravery he
[42:37] was anointed to take out 600 philistines
[42:40] and how samson picked up a jawbone of an
[42:43] ass
[42:43] and whooped a thousand for listings and
[42:45] he just kept going on about how great
[42:47] this god is
[42:51] talked about how in a valley was a bunch
[42:54] of dry bones
[42:56] and life but came to these dry bones and
[42:59] they rose up a living army
[43:02] son of man can these bones live oh yeah
[43:06] oh they can live they just was exhorting
[43:09] the people and encouraging the people
[43:11] but the prophet god will say but at the
[43:13] end of his message
[43:15] he ruined it he ruined what he was
[43:18] talking about when he said
[43:20] those great days of jehovah dealing with
[43:22] the people like that
[43:24] wasn't necessary no more
[43:27] notice what the the rabbi they had
[43:29] become settled down in their homeland
[43:32] they didn't exactly need miracles
[43:35] no more oh what about the preaching
[43:39] that's going
[43:40] around this message today we don't need
[43:42] the holy ghost no more
[43:44] we don't need to speaking in tongues we
[43:46] don't need all that it's all emotion i'm
[43:48] here to tell you may the people of god
[43:50] may the sons and daughters of god never
[43:52] settle for an emotionless religion
[43:55] oh they want to say it's gone they want
[43:56] to say it's days going by you let them
[43:58] say that
[43:59] we still need miracles we still need god
[44:02] we still need a healer we still need to
[44:04] deliver
[44:05] we still need to see the impossible made
[44:07] real
[44:10] brother the man will say they had good
[44:11] doctors for their sickness which was
[44:13] certainly all right
[44:15] they were better off they had they had
[44:16] their homes and they just didn't need
[44:18] god or miracles anymore
[44:20] but somehow that didn't settle
[44:24] somehow that didn't settle and satisfy
[44:27] the thirst
[44:28] and the hunger of joseph and mary and i
[44:30] trust it doesn't satisfy you tonight
[44:36] know mary began to talk to joseph she
[44:37] knows you know how we are
[44:39] honey sugar booger
[44:43] some of y'all don't have those pet names
[44:44] for your spouse
[44:46] yeah you do you just try to hold a poker
[44:48] face tonight
[44:51] mary was just asking joseph
[44:54] this great god that brought us here and
[44:57] made us what we
[44:58] are he doesn't have to do those things
[45:01] for us now like he did then she's
[45:03] contemplating
[45:05] thinking about the message before
[45:08] i've been thinking for a long time that
[45:10] if god was as great in the days of our
[45:12] fathers
[45:13] as he was in the days of our
[45:15] grandfathers then why isn't he the same
[45:18] great god today if he was so great on
[45:22] the shores of galilee
[45:23] and he was so great in the 50s and 60s
[45:26] and we seen blind eyes open and we seen
[45:29] the sick healed and we've seen the dead
[45:31] race why isn't he the same god today
[45:36] why isn't he the same god and even like
[45:38] tabernacle
[45:42] why isn't he the same god across the
[45:44] world today
[45:48] brother branham would say and further on
[45:49] in different messages he would say that
[45:51] the people
[45:52] has allowed the enemy to explain away
[45:54] the value of the word
[45:57] i don't think that'll ever be the case
[45:58] at this church
[46:00] you've got men of god who's been
[46:02] anointed to proclaim the living god
[46:04] no matter how we feel no matter how what
[46:06] we face in life no matter the difficulty
[46:08] and adversity we face
[46:10] we believe in a living god and no doubt
[46:13] mary and joseph would begin to read in
[46:14] the scrolls and they picked up the bible
[46:16] or
[46:16] picked up their scroll and they read
[46:17] isaiah 9 6 and the scripture would say
[46:20] unto us a child is born
[46:22] and and to us a son has given it and
[46:24] mary would just begin to think joseph
[46:26] if god is not the same today as he was
[46:28] yesterday and if he's not as good as he
[46:30] was today as he was
[46:31] for our fathers and forefathers can we
[46:34] ever believe that isaiah 96
[46:36] is ever going to come to pass will god
[46:38] ever send us a child
[46:40] will god ever send us a son and she
[46:42] began to meditate on it
[46:44] and she was going to get her water and
[46:46] let me tell you the problem god said
[46:47] when you begin to think about god
[46:49] he shows up oh i hope you came to church
[46:52] tonight with your minds on jesus
[46:54] hope you didn't come with your mind on
[46:55] copa 19 and your mind on cancer and your
[46:58] mind on the stresses of this life but i
[46:59] hope you come tonight with your mind
[47:01] stayed on him but i'm here to tell you
[47:03] if you did
[47:04] he's here to meet you tonight he's here
[47:06] to come by your way tonight and
[47:08] administer what you have need of
[47:12] oh she began to walk and all of a sudden
[47:13] she seen a little flicker of light
[47:16] and she just pondered thinking about a
[47:17] 16 17 year old girl
[47:20] thinking about the scriptures and
[47:21] thinking about the message from the day
[47:23] before
[47:26] does he still do that and now all of a
[47:28] sudden
[47:30] probably god say out from a pillar of
[47:31] fire stepped the angel gabriel
[47:34] hail mary i'm sent from the presence of
[47:37] the lord
[47:39] to tell you that you're highly favored
[47:42] oh come on little bride
[47:44] we had a messenger coming this day
[47:47] hell mary thou art highly favored among
[47:51] all the churches in the land they are
[47:53] highly
[47:54] favored out of all the ones that he
[47:56] could have chosen he's chosen you here
[47:58] tonight
[48:00] chosen you because he knew that you had
[48:02] a desire for the things of god
[48:04] and the prophet of god will say look she
[48:06] she saw the great angel and it startled
[48:08] the little virgin and
[48:09] she stopped and she came close or he
[48:12] came close to her and she saluted
[48:13] and he saluted excuse me and he gave her
[48:16] a message
[48:18] that was a hard message for that child
[48:20] to believe for she wasn't nothing but a
[48:23] girl he gave her something to believe
[48:25] that was more outstanding and hard to
[48:27] believe than anything that he has
[48:29] ever given to anyone but he gave it to a
[48:33] little virgin and i'm gonna take he's
[48:34] given us a message
[48:36] it may seem hard for you to believe or
[48:38] hard for the world to believe
[48:40] but mary said be it unto me according to
[48:43] your word and i'm trusting that this
[48:45] mary
[48:46] in this last day that anointed lady that
[48:48] elected bride
[48:49] she's saying being unto me lord hey
[48:51] saying that the days of miracles has
[48:53] passed but i say
[48:54] being unto me today lord i need a touch
[48:57] i need a healing
[48:58] i need a deliverance i need a change in
[49:00] my body i need a rapture
[49:02] of this vessel oh be it unto me tonight
[49:04] father
[49:05] when i walk out of here i don't walk out
[49:07] decrepit i'm not gonna walk out here
[49:09] feeble man
[49:10] i'm gonna walk out here as a son of god
[49:12] as a daughter of god
[49:14] victorious because why because i met the
[49:16] angel of the lord
[49:17] [Music]
[49:19] and he's come by my way
[49:23] and when i can't believe the rabbi i'm
[49:25] going to believe the angel
[49:28] oh when you can't believe the
[49:29] denominations oh and you can't believe
[49:31] some of the message churches out there
[49:33] we're going to believe the angel we're
[49:35] going to stay with the word
[49:38] oh hallelujah notice he said she had to
[49:41] believe for something
[49:42] that had never happened
[49:46] a woman having a baby without knowing
[49:49] any man
[49:51] and she said how shall these things be
[49:55] and he simply repeated or simply stated
[49:58] to her the holy ghost
[50:00] shall oversaddle thee and the holy thing
[50:02] that shall be born in thee shall be
[50:04] called
[50:05] a son of god it linked her
[50:08] to isaiah 9 6. the scripture she was
[50:12] pondering
[50:14] when how if god
[50:17] is not as great as he was yesterday
[50:20] then how is isaiah 9 6 gonna be made
[50:22] manifest
[50:25] but notice mary took him at his word
[50:29] and he changed her whole course of her
[50:32] natural life
[50:34] oh i remember one time when i took god
[50:36] in his word
[50:38] oh i was going the wrong way but the
[50:39] angel of the lord i always said the
[50:41] angel lord i heard a voice
[50:42] tell me turn your car around and go back
[50:45] home
[50:46] now i could have been disobedient and
[50:48] kept on going and i would have kept on
[50:50] going down that same old sinful road
[50:51] that i was headed in
[50:52] but no i obey the voice of the lord and
[50:55] what did he do
[50:56] he changed oh hallelujah he changed my
[50:59] entire natural course
[51:00] of my life i'm no longer a sinner i'm no
[51:03] longer in drugs i'm no longer in smoking
[51:05] and drinking and partying and drunk and
[51:07] all that and women

[59:33] oh if i could get you to believe that
[59:35] tonight you don't have to be bound any
[59:37] longer
[59:43] possessing the gaze of his enemy brother
[59:46] brahma said god is true to his promise
[59:49] no matter what he has to do bankrupt the
[59:52] heavens before he would ever let the
[59:54] word go defeated

[59:59] every divine promise of god tonight
[1:00:01] i don't care how small that word is you
[1:00:03] can hang it on there
[1:00:05] because god ain't gonna let it be
[1:00:06] defeated
[1:00:08] notice now he never made a promise
[1:00:12] that he can't keep i'm the lord
[1:00:15] that heals all thy diseases if they lay
[1:00:18] hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:00:20] if thou cast believe all things are
[1:00:23] possible
[1:00:24] and joshua believed it now let's go back
[1:00:28] into that era for a minute
[1:00:30] joshua was fighting a battle and he had
[1:00:33] his enemy on the run and some of you got
[1:00:34] your enemies on the run tonight
[1:00:36] but you're running out of daylight it's
[1:00:39] getting dark they didn't have lights
[1:00:40] like we have tonight they didn't have
[1:00:42] street lights where they can keep on
[1:00:43] fighting
[1:00:44] and radar and all these different things
[1:00:46] no joshua needed a little bit of
[1:00:47] sunlight
[1:00:48] he didn't go and beg god he didn't go
[1:00:50] and have a prayer meeting he said son
[1:00:52] you stand still
[1:00:53] and you believe the word of god he
[1:00:55] believed that he was anointed to take
[1:00:57] the people into the promised land
[1:00:59] and so he spoke the word and god said
[1:01:02] that he hung the sun up there and the
[1:01:04] moon there and the problem of god said
[1:01:05] it didn't turn for 24 hours
[1:01:10] it was an impossibility but he did it
[1:01:14] and your situation tonight may be an
[1:01:17] impossibility
[1:01:18] but you can do it
[1:01:21] but your son and your moon needs to hear
[1:01:23] your voice
[1:01:26] i said your son and your moon needs to
[1:01:28] hear your voice
[1:01:29] so you can whip your enemy until he's
[1:01:32] finally completely defeated
[1:01:35] notice now joshua avenged himself
[1:01:38] upon his enemy and he took the gates of
[1:01:41] his enemy
[1:01:42] and and the word tells us tonight if we
[1:01:44] can believe this evening
[1:01:46] that we can take the gates of any enemy
[1:01:48] that we face
[1:01:49] no matter what we're facing tonight
[1:01:51] maybe you've got threats of the enemy
[1:01:53] coming in your mind tonight
[1:01:54] telling you you're going to lose your
[1:01:55] healing you're going to lose your
[1:01:56] deliverance i'm going to tell you
[1:01:58] tonight you can take the gate of that
[1:01:59] enemy tonight
[1:02:02] maybe he's come with threats maybe he's
[1:02:03] come with your situation but if you can
[1:02:05] believe
[1:02:06] tonight all things are possible
[1:02:10] all things are possible
[1:02:16] you guys want to know what makes the
[1:02:17] devil mad
[1:02:19] one of y'all so i'm gonna preach to you
[1:02:21] andrew the rest of them don't care
[1:02:23] you want to know what makes the devil
[1:02:25] mad the prophet of god says when the
[1:02:27] people of god
[1:02:28] begin to believe who they are oh when
[1:02:31] you can see in the word that you're not
[1:02:33] some little cast down
[1:02:34] you're not some little put away no but
[1:02:36] you are sons
[1:02:37] and daughters of god when you believe
[1:02:39] who you are
[1:02:40] and who you are then there ain't no
[1:02:42] devil can stand before you
[1:02:44] listen what the prophet god will say
[1:02:46] here he says now that's what makes the
[1:02:48] devil mad
[1:02:49] that's what shakes him when the church
[1:02:51] of jesus christ
[1:02:52] only know who they were brother he says
[1:02:54] oh my he said there's nothing
[1:02:56] impossible with god but god said there's
[1:02:58] nothing impossible with you tonight
[1:03:02] he said that changes the subject don't
[1:03:04] it
[1:03:07] there's nothing impossible with you see
[1:03:10] so whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:03:12] pray
[1:03:13] believe that you receive it and you
[1:03:15] shall have it
[1:03:16] he says now if we become in the spirit
[1:03:18] sons of god
[1:03:20] he says then deity dwells in the man
[1:03:26] do you realize what deity is
[1:03:30] it's christ himself
[1:03:33] deity creative power
[1:03:36] devil defeating power
[1:03:40] cancer stomping power
[1:03:43] brain bleed buffering kicking and
[1:03:45] screaming power tonight
[1:03:47] we got power over every curse of the
[1:03:49] enemy because why because we're not just
[1:03:51] some little nobody in laodicea
[1:03:54] no but sons and daughters of god and
[1:03:56] deity jesus
[1:03:58] christ himself the creator of power that
[1:04:00] spoke the worlds into existence
[1:04:02] is inside this room tonight inside your
[1:04:05] vessel
[1:04:06] and your vessel so whatever you speak
[1:04:08] tonight is the same as almighty god
[1:04:10] speaking
[1:04:13] he goes you talk about blind eyes being
[1:04:15] open they said nothing impossible to god
[1:04:18] god said nothing impossible with you if
[1:04:20] you'll believe not with god
[1:04:22] but you deities in man the very god that
[1:04:25] stood
[1:04:26] back on the mythical platform of the
[1:04:28] eternities and he rode off his hands
[1:04:30] and created these things he give you the
[1:04:33] privilege to be his sons
[1:04:35] and you're part of him and god dwells in
[1:04:38] mankind
[1:04:39] and man himself is deity
[1:04:45] let's go a little bit further with that
[1:04:47] in the same power
[1:04:49] that same christ let the fundamentalists
[1:04:53] let the people who deny the power of god
[1:04:55] they say that it's wrong but the same
[1:04:57] power
[1:04:58] that spoke the world into existence is
[1:05:01] in those people that's got the holy
[1:05:03] ghost
[1:05:05] he says men and women it's time that we
[1:05:07] found out who you are

[1:07:30] own word
[1:07:31] and when you begin to speak you've got
[1:07:33] to believe your own word

[1:08:50] oh jesus said whatever you ask the
[1:08:52] father in my name
[1:08:54] that will i do that's a promise church
[1:08:58] it's a promise for you tonight all you
[1:09:00] got to do is claim that promise
[1:09:03] whatever you ask the father that i'll do
[1:09:05] did you realize what that means do you
[1:09:07] realize
[1:09:08] if we go before god in the name of jesus
[1:09:11] it's just the same as jesus himself
[1:09:14] praying
[1:09:16] i can't recall one time in the bible
[1:09:18] that jesus's prayer was ever unfulfilled
[1:09:21] but every time he prayed every time he
[1:09:23] went to the throne of god
[1:09:24] god responded and god met his need it's
[1:09:27] the same way with you as sons and
[1:09:28] daughters of god
[1:09:29] when you earnestly but go before god and
[1:09:31] you've been compelled
[1:09:32] and you're not just come haphazardly but
[1:09:34] you've got a burden on your heart
[1:09:36] and you go before god you watch god move
[1:09:40] oh i tell you gotta come down in a
[1:09:42] moment in a minute in a time when you
[1:09:44] least expect it and break the shackles
[1:09:46] off somebody's life
[1:09:47] and break the curse of sin of somebody's
[1:09:49] life and break
[1:09:50] the curse of the enemy or whatever kind
[1:09:52] of affliction over their life
[1:09:54] and raise them up to a new man
[1:10:00] then he says now i've got to receive
[1:10:03] what i asked for because he
[1:10:04] said it and it's god's own word it can't
[1:10:08] and
[1:10:08] he said it can't do nothing else but
[1:10:11] produce
[1:10:12] just what it said
[1:10:16] now how many of you said you got a need
[1:10:17] tonight
[1:10:21] if you can speak to that need tonight
[1:10:26] oh i'm here to tell you you're going to
[1:10:29] see god moving this surface tonight
[1:10:32] well brother joe we just don't feel it
[1:10:34] it ain't based on how you feel
[1:10:37] no let's create an atmosphere starting
[1:10:39] right now an atmosphere of faith
[1:10:41] an atmospheric belief an atmosphere that
[1:10:43] we can do the impossible
[1:10:46] we're not going to listen to any more
[1:10:47] lies you push the lies out tell the
[1:10:49] enemy right now that you ain't listening
[1:10:50] to him anymore
[1:10:51] he can take his propaganda and he can go
[1:10:53] to hell with it because we're going to
[1:10:55] tune into the word tonight and the word
[1:10:57] says let this mind be in you
[1:10:58] which was also in christ what did that
[1:11:01] mind do that mind didn't think it was
[1:11:03] robbery
[1:11:03] to be equal with god let me tell you if
[1:11:06] that was the mind that he had that's the
[1:11:08] mind that we're to have then we've got
[1:11:09] to believe tonight that we can be
[1:11:11] co-equal with god
[1:11:12] and whatsoever things we pray whatsoever
[1:11:14] things we desire when we go before the
[1:11:16] throne of grace
[1:11:16] god will meet that need
[1:11:20] and what does the mind of christ do it
[1:11:23] looks to the unseen
[1:11:25] he looks to the miraculous it calls
[1:11:28] those things that were not as though
[1:11:29] they are
[1:11:35] oh he says when we become born of the
[1:11:36] spirit of god he becomes an offspring
[1:11:38] our son of god
[1:11:39] and then he has the same type of mind
[1:11:41] that god does
[1:11:42] and that mind that was in christ is in
[1:11:45] you
[1:11:45] and we believe for the unseen for the
[1:11:48] miraculous
[1:11:51] come on church are y'all picking up what
[1:11:53] i'm putting down
[1:11:54] you're awful quiet tonight i'm trying to
[1:11:57] get your faith elevated
[1:11:58] oh we got enough pressure out there in
[1:12:00] the world when you walk outside these
[1:12:01] doors hell's right there to bombard you
[1:12:03] but i'm talking about we're in the
[1:12:04] presence of a living god tonight
[1:12:06] where all things are possible obviously
[1:12:09] the waters are being troubled
[1:12:10] and let me tell you when that day when
[1:12:12] the waters would be in trouble
[1:12:14] those that were standing by waiting for
[1:12:15] the angel of the lord to come down
[1:12:17] they looked for the supernatural they
[1:12:20] came to every service because they knew
[1:12:22] they could get to the water first they
[1:12:23] could be healed they could be delivered
[1:12:25] and if i could get you to look tonight
[1:12:27] there's the stirring of the waters and
[1:12:29] the age of the lord is here
[1:12:30] you can be healed tonight you can be
[1:12:32] delivered tonight
[1:12:35] because the power of god is here you

[1:12:42] that ain't a man church the angels here
[1:12:46] to trouble the waters
[1:12:51] the angel is here and he's troubling the
[1:12:53] waters tonight
[1:12:54] trying to get you to believe oh if you
[1:12:56] could just look at it
[1:12:57] and realize it ain't some man it ain't
[1:12:59] some pepped up little story
[1:13:01] it ain't some little feel good preaching
[1:13:03] but it's the word of god coming to you
[1:13:05] telling you tonight you can believe for
[1:13:07] the impossible

[1:13:14] into the water
[1:13:19] oh my mary didn't wait till she felt
[1:13:21] positive

[1:13:33] this mess i had a brother write me
[1:13:35] he said brother joe i just had to write

[1:13:39] watching your message in possible math

[1:13:45] showing
[1:13:46] she didn't wait till she felt the first
[1:13:48] kick
[1:13:49] she didn't wait till she was vomiting
[1:13:52] because she had morning sickness
[1:13:54] she didn't wait for any of those things
[1:13:56] she went confessing
[1:13:58] and praising god immediately after she
[1:14:01] left the angel
[1:14:04] and this brother wrote me he says look
[1:14:06] he says i just had to write you to give

[1:14:29] goes i knew or
[1:14:30] i believed that there was an answer to
[1:14:32] the problem it was then that i realized

[1:14:36] that just because i didn't have or i
[1:14:38] didn't understand the answer to the
[1:14:40] problem
[1:14:40] that it didn't mean that there is one
[1:14:42] that didn't exist
[1:14:44] he said how great is our god that he
[1:14:46] loves to take the most difficult

[1:17:26] without the promise that god gave
[1:17:30] oh hallelujah notice now this virgin
[1:17:33] birth
[1:17:35] was a miracle it was a paradox
[1:17:38] it was an impossibility
[1:17:41] to the human mind yes but to the mind of
[1:17:44] christ
[1:17:45] absolutely not to the mind of christ
[1:17:48] it's already been seen in the word some
[1:17:52] 800 years later oh
[1:17:56] the prophet of god say we have heard and
[1:17:58] we have heard great testimonies
[1:18:01] down through the ages but now we see
[1:18:05] i said now we are seeing the
[1:18:07] manifestation
[1:18:08] of the revealed word of the hour now
[1:18:11] we're seeing not just
[1:18:12] a little intellectual understanding of
[1:18:14] placing this here and placing that there
[1:18:16] and having this seal open and that seal
[1:18:18] open
[1:18:18] and this seal somehow it didn't get open
[1:18:20] but no it's now we believe
[1:18:22] all the word has been restored to a
[1:18:24] people but it ain't just about the word
[1:18:26] but now in this hour for a people they
[1:18:28] got the spirit of god
[1:18:29] because the spirit of god comes and
[1:18:31] anoints that word because the letter
[1:18:33] killeth
[1:18:33] but the spirit is here to give life and
[1:18:35] we got more than just a word we got the
[1:18:37] anointing of the holy ghost
[1:18:39] behind that word the mechanics with the
[1:18:41] dynamic
[1:18:42] to get the car into a rapture church i'm
[1:18:44] here to talk to you
[1:18:45] about a god of impossibilities making
[1:18:47] the possibility
[1:18:48] made real through your life tonight
[1:18:50] through your flesh tonight through your
[1:18:52] desires
[1:18:53] through your children tonight he's the
[1:18:54] god of the impossible and so are you
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:18:59] he healed the sick of leprosy when there
[1:19:02] was no cure
[1:19:06] and he's here tonight
[1:19:09] can i go just a few more minutes
[1:19:13] i'm gonna kick in my teaching gift just
[1:19:16] kidding
[1:19:20] brother timothy and i were texting a
[1:19:22] while back
[1:19:24] when sister karen first had her episode
[1:19:28] brother timothy text me let me read the
[1:19:31] scripture first
[1:19:33] mark 11 23 if you put that up there
[1:19:39] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[1:19:42] shall say unto this mountain
[1:19:44] that word mountain is a difficulty or
[1:19:47] let me say it like this an
[1:19:48] impossibility could you imagine speaking
[1:19:51] to a mountain
[1:19:52] and it's going to vanish people will
[1:19:55] think you're
[1:19:55] completely insane
[1:19:58] but it's a difficulty it's an
[1:20:01] impossibility
[1:20:02] but whosoever shall say unto this
[1:20:05] impossibility
[1:20:06] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:20:08] the sea and shall
[1:20:10] not doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:20:13] that those things which he saith
[1:20:15] shall come to pass he shall have
[1:20:17] whatsoever
[1:20:18] he saith therefore i say unto you what
[1:20:21] things soever
[1:20:22] ye desire when you pray believe that you
[1:20:26] receive them
[1:20:27] and you shall have them
[1:20:32] you believe and you shall see it don't
[1:20:35] rest on god and rest on you tonight
[1:20:38] believing in the impossibility and if
[1:20:40] you can put your fears aside
[1:20:42] and your doubts aside and channel your
[1:20:45] faith tonight
[1:20:46] to believe the word of god every mouth
[1:20:48] has got to fall
[1:20:51] brother timothy told me he says we are
[1:20:53] assigned mountains
[1:20:55] to show others that they can be moved
[1:20:58] do you believe that tonight david was
[1:21:01] signed to goliath
[1:21:02] to show that he could be defeated
[1:21:04] shamgar was a size 600
[1:21:06] but he picked up a knox go to prove to
[1:21:09] some others
[1:21:09] that you can beat if you could defeat
[1:21:11] your philistines samson picked up a
[1:21:13] jawbone
[1:21:14] and deflated of a thousand to show that
[1:21:16] they could be defeated
[1:21:17] daniel was indonesian that showed that
[1:21:20] they could be defeated
[1:21:21] sister atlanta had stage fours hodgkin's
[1:21:24] disease but let me tell you
[1:21:25] she had it so that god could show others
[1:21:27] that cancer can and will be defeated
[1:21:30] mariah pruitt had alopecia let's show
[1:21:33] others that alopecia
[1:21:34] has to bow before the name of jesus
[1:21:37] sister karen had brain please
[1:21:38] but it showed that god gave her a
[1:21:40] mountain that had to move
[1:21:42] to prove to others that it has to fall
[1:21:44] to the word of god
[1:21:46] and if you can speak to your mountain
[1:21:47] tonight whatever you are facing tonight
[1:21:49] it's got to obey your voice it's got to
[1:21:52] come falling down
[1:21:54] i'm here to tell you mountains will move
[1:21:56] tonight goliaths will fall tonight
[1:21:59] philistines will be defeated and fires
[1:22:01] will be quenched
[1:22:02] and lions will be tamed at your voice
[1:22:06] at your command
[1:22:12] what is god doing oh we heard these
[1:22:15] great things
[1:22:16] shreveport louisiana we've heard these
[1:22:18] great things
[1:22:20] jeffersonville indiana we heard about a
[1:22:23] god yesterday
[1:22:25] but why did he come by here to prove
[1:22:27] that he's the same today
[1:22:32] cancer nothing but a toothache
[1:22:37] he says now we have to believe the
[1:22:40] impossibilities
[1:22:41] to see new life we have
[1:22:45] to believe the impossibilities
[1:22:49] to receive new life but when you believe
[1:22:51] the impossible
[1:22:52] the doctor says you got cancer you're
[1:22:54] dying you got to believe the
[1:22:55] impossibility
[1:22:57] to see new life take a hold of you if
[1:22:59] your doctor says you can't
[1:23:00] you can't walk you've got to believe the
[1:23:02] impossible to see new life coming to you
[1:23:05] new life in them fibers oh bring forth a
[1:23:08] new hand a new arm new lungs new stomach
[1:23:10] whatever it is
[1:23:11] god will do it if you'll take them at
[1:23:14] his word
[1:23:18] as we start wrapping this up i told
[1:23:21] y'all the testimony of sister beth
[1:23:22] dingle
[1:23:24] she had a cancer that attacks only kids
[1:23:27] and leukemia
[1:23:28] no one had ever survived
[1:23:32] it had a 100 success rate of killing
[1:23:35] those that got it
[1:23:37] but the church rallied behind
[1:23:41] a little daughter of god and believed
[1:23:44] and a family rallied behind a daughter
[1:23:48] of god and believed and they had to
[1:23:51] rewrite the history books
[1:23:53] because she's one in a million
[1:23:57] oh church our sister atlanta had
[1:24:00] stage four non-hosting lymphoma
[1:24:04] the doctors gave her up there wasn't
[1:24:06] much they could do besides just give her
[1:24:07] some chemotherapy
[1:24:08] brother david was threatened and worried
[1:24:10] what is he gonna do if he loses his wife
[1:24:12] and he's got five kids
[1:24:13] think about the five kids in their mind
[1:24:15] what are we gonna do we're gonna lose
[1:24:16] our mom because you know we don't know
[1:24:17] if she's gonna make it or not
[1:24:22] stage four but the church
[1:24:26] rallied behind a daughter of god and a
[1:24:29] family in this church
[1:24:31] joba one day sitting back there at the
[1:24:33] end of a service
[1:24:35] faith dropped down and the impossibility
[1:24:38] was made real
[1:24:39] and she took god at his word and did a
[1:24:41] run around this church
[1:24:42] and ain't never been the same since
[1:24:45] because
[1:24:46] when you believe the impossible you can
[1:24:48] get new life
[1:24:51] she's had three or four scans pet scans
[1:24:53] since that time and she's completely
[1:24:55] cancer-free why are you saying this
[1:24:58] brother joe because i'm telling you that
[1:24:59] he's the same god tonight
[1:25:02] you may not have cancer you may have
[1:25:04] something else but he's still god
[1:25:06] and if i can get you to believe tonight
[1:25:08] then nothing will stand before your
[1:25:10] prayer
[1:25:10] not even cancer think about brother ron
[1:25:14] tonight we heard a great testimony of
[1:25:16] brother ron
[1:25:17] here he was a man who was only given
[1:25:19] four months to live
[1:25:20] and every 12 weeks he goes back for
[1:25:22] tests and every 12 weeks he gets
[1:25:23] stronger
[1:25:24] and stronger and stronger when the lord
[1:25:26] said brother ron
[1:25:27] do you trust me with your life he said
[1:25:29] yes let me tell you church if you can
[1:25:31] trust god tonight
[1:25:32] with your life i'm gonna take he may
[1:25:34] take you through a hard road but you're
[1:25:36] gonna come out
[1:25:37] you're gonna know god in a way you've
[1:25:39] never known him before
[1:25:40] you'll never doubt you'll never have
[1:25:42] unbelief you'll trust god
[1:25:44] and if i can get you to trust him
[1:25:45] tonight with your life every day you'll
[1:25:47] see the miraculous
[1:25:49] you'll see the supernatural you'll see
[1:25:51] the manifestation of a living god
[1:25:54] and that's what we're seeing in virginia
[1:25:56] is the manifestation
[1:25:57] of a living god when the son of god said
[1:26:00] yes lord
[1:26:01] be it unto me i'll trust you with my
[1:26:03] life
[1:26:05] when the doctors gave up on them
[1:26:08] oh the church rallied behind and
[1:26:11] believed
[1:26:13] in the impossible
[1:26:16] we know the story different ones
[1:26:19] i want to talk about sister karen just
[1:26:21] for a minute because it was right after
[1:26:23] i preach
[1:26:24] god does impossible math
[1:26:28] if i'm not mistaken somebody told me
[1:26:29] that when the service was over
[1:26:32] sister karen told brother jim he
[1:26:33] preached it for you tonight
[1:26:36] not knowing what was he was about to go
[1:26:39] through
[1:26:40] and what the family was going to go
[1:26:41] through
[1:26:43] god was preparing the church
[1:26:46] no matter how bleak the situation no
[1:26:49] matter when they give
[1:26:50] up he's not done
[1:26:54] oh did you hear what i said he's not
[1:26:56] done
[1:26:58] and he's not done tonight he's not done
[1:27:01] tonight sister esther sister candace
[1:27:03] he's not done don't listen to the
[1:27:05] propaganda
[1:27:07] so we know the next night i think it was
[1:27:09] thursday
[1:27:11] brother tim says sister karen i went to
[1:27:12] the restroom and started having a
[1:27:13] headache so he took her to the er and
[1:27:15] with coleman 19 he couldn't get in there
[1:27:16] so brother timothy called me it's about
[1:27:18] 12 30 1 o'clock i went up to the to the
[1:27:20] er went in and actually was able to go
[1:27:22] in and of course
[1:27:23] i worked there so it's not a problem
[1:27:25] went in and had prayer with her
[1:27:26] and prayed for and just believed i said
[1:27:29] god we're going to believe for the
[1:27:30] impossibilities
[1:27:32] because you do the impossible math when
[1:27:35] our human minds can't figure it out when
[1:27:36] our human minds want to give up
[1:27:38] god you still have the answer
[1:27:41] so i asked the doctor i said doc do you
[1:27:44] mind if i look at the scans i want to
[1:27:45] see the ct scans
[1:27:48] he said sure so he brought me over to
[1:27:50] the machine and i started looking at him
[1:27:51] and he began to flip through and flip
[1:27:52] through he says look this is the
[1:27:54] this is her brain here and this is where
[1:27:56] it was the last time in april and
[1:27:58] the time before four or five years ago
[1:28:00] and you know it's in a completely
[1:28:01] different spot and
[1:28:02] in her entire brain cavity on the right
[1:28:04] side if i'm not mistaken was full of
[1:28:06] blood
[1:28:07] and he said there's a little place up
[1:28:09] here that's kind of an empty place
[1:28:10] but he says it's supposed to be empty
[1:28:12] but it's so much brain
[1:28:14] in there or so much blood in there that
[1:28:15] it's pushing the brain matter over
[1:28:17] and it's no longer empty it's full and
[1:28:19] it's causing her this situation
[1:28:22] and i said well dog let me ask you this
[1:28:23] she's had two of these before
[1:28:25] how severe how serious is this he said
[1:28:28] he looked at me he says well joe he said
[1:28:30] let me tell you
[1:28:31] she could live another five minutes or
[1:28:33] she could live another five years
[1:28:36] he said but she will not have a quality
[1:28:38] of life
[1:28:39] and without missing a beat i said we're
[1:28:41] going to believe for the impossible then
[1:28:45] something just flew right out of me i
[1:28:46] said we're going to believe for the
[1:28:48] impossible then
[1:28:49] and i watched him as they took her into
[1:28:51] an ambulance and took her to lsu
[1:28:53] i didn't have one fear because i knew
[1:28:55] the god that we served
[1:28:57] and so the next day they did emergency
[1:28:59] brain surgery and they drained the blood
[1:29:01] out of her brain and just i think it was
[1:29:03] several hours later
[1:29:04] she began to respond to brother tim and
[1:29:06] then the next day her eyes began to
[1:29:07] begin open
[1:29:08] and the next day this and the next day
[1:29:10] that and it just snowballed and
[1:29:11] snowballed and snowballed
[1:29:13] until now she's in the house of god and
[1:29:15] last week she came up here running up on
[1:29:17] the platform that shows to you church
[1:29:19] why is god doing these things that show
[1:29:21] the world
[1:29:22] that mountains have to fall a devil has
[1:29:24] to succumb
[1:29:25] to the word of god if you can't believe

[1:36:08] he took his case to the lord because he
[1:36:11] knew the lord spoke to him
[1:36:12] about leaving and the lord said moses
[1:36:18] tell the people tonight to stand still
[1:36:21] and see the salvation of the lord tell
[1:36:24] them to stand still tell me just
[1:36:25] give me a few more minutes tonight i'm
[1:36:27] not done with this service just yet
[1:36:30] i got a few more things i like to say
[1:36:31] before it's over moses tell them to
[1:36:33] stand still
[1:36:35] because the enemies that they see all
[1:36:37] those task measures that they've seen
[1:36:39] today
[1:36:39] the ones that afflicted them yesterday
[1:36:41] and came down on them
[1:36:43] and bombarded their minds with unbelief
[1:36:45] and doubt and depression and fear
[1:36:47] and anxieties and worthless life those
[1:36:49] enemies that they once saw they'll never
[1:36:51] see them again
[1:36:52] no more forever moses
[1:36:55] okay god then what must i do
[1:36:58] he says all right moses this is gonna
[1:37:01] seem really strange
[1:37:03] and it's gonna look like an
[1:37:04] impossibility to all the people
[1:37:06] but i want you to take that staff in
[1:37:08] your hand and i want you to stretch it
[1:37:10] out
[1:37:11] and i want you to put it over that sea
[1:37:13] and i want you to speak
[1:37:17] oh great mighty sea waters
[1:37:20] moses obeyed the voice of god and he
[1:37:23] stretched
[1:37:23] forth his hand oh and what happened all
[1:37:27] through the night an east wind came and
[1:37:29] blew back the waters and they walled up
[1:37:31] on both sides
[1:37:33] oh the next morning they began to walk
[1:37:35] they didn't have to run they had an
[1:37:36] assurance
[1:37:39] but it was a belief in every one of them
[1:37:42] to believe in the impossibility when
[1:37:45] they stepped down into their water
[1:37:47] or what was water they had to believe
[1:37:50] that the walls were not going to come
[1:37:52] crashing down on them
[1:37:53] they had to believe that moses actually
[1:37:55] did hear from god
[1:37:56] and when they crossed over they were
[1:37:58] going to be in the promised land or on
[1:38:00] their way to the promised land and one
[1:38:02] by one they took god at his word
[1:38:05] it looked like an impossibility but they
[1:38:07] made it to the other side
[1:38:11] and when that last it was like stepped
[1:38:14] his foot
[1:38:15] up out of the water or what was what the
[1:38:17] walls came crashing down
[1:38:22] well that was a good story it's not over
[1:38:27] it's alright it was a good church
[1:38:28] meeting it was a good wednesday night
[1:38:29] service it's not over
[1:38:32] oh oh they got on the other side
[1:38:36] i wonder if there's any merriam's here

[1:38:41] that tamarind

[1:39:11] floating in the sea and she grabbed one
[1:39:13] of these
