hope there's no way that it's going to work out there's no way it's going to turn out God has the last words he has the final final say in every situation amen we just give it all to him man let's just bow our hearts to Him Father we come to you today Lord once again Lord just have a need in our life Lord just asking that you would come and manifest yourself among us or we felt you'd already hear this morning and know you're moving Among Us you're changing lives and hearts Lord even when we don't see you working we know you're still working you never stop you're always pulling you're always called and you're always wooing whatever heart to you father that is yours Lord today we just ask that you would help us by your grace and Lord if it be anything we've done or said not be pleasing Lord we just wanted to undo that blood Lord and under your Your Heart Lord God and just lay it there father bless each one here this morning you know each need you know who came you knew they would be here before the foundation of the world and we just ask God you just move among us we pray in Jesus name hey man let's turn to Romans chapter 8. amen I'd like to say it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen we had a wonderful time at the true word Tabernacle Camp there in Ohio and amen the Lord just really moved so mightily and we haven't had a chance to see those Services brother Andrew brother Ron and my just God moving service after service after service that's our God amen you you can't put limitations on him because he's a God that's Unlimited and so you know that's how it is in our thinking we think Services can never get any better but that's according to our thinking not according to his because he's unlimited and amen he wants to pour out upon us more than we can even take amen and so we just thank the Lord for the true word Tabernacle Church I'm thankful for those that stand for the moving of the spirit and and allow freedom to come into the building and and to touch hearts and lives and really appreciate Brother Ray well brother Wayne Lawson he's taken over there as Pastor now brother Ray Erickson is still there working with him and amen God has done a real mighty work there and brother Ray stood for so many years on the Supernatural and things of God and we sure appreciate him I look at him as Caleb amen is give me my Mountain he he may be 80 something years old but there's still a love and a Zeal and a fire in that heart really loves the Lord and the things of God and and the spirit of God and then brother Wayne as you know he uh he also is that away as well and and I like I like to work with men like that men that I'll just put all four just go with everything they got him and let the car to go down the road and let Divine Healing take place and victories take place and amen I enjoy that that that that that kind of service and so amen this morning we we want to take a thought on the light the spark amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 11. it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen we let you be seated this morning I got a little bit of uh he probably heard it and brother Mike as well but a little Camp hangover amen her voice is a little wore out but amen we uh we're sure thankful for all the victories and things that God gave us and and a lot of testimonies and things of God's changing power that working working in our young people and I I tell you I ever everyone is a right to their own personal Revival amen I believe that we ought to ought to uh fight for that with everything that we have that everyone can come to that place and that moment in their lives that they can meet the burning bush for themselves because that Burning Bush is still Among Us they didn't live and die with Moses but that was Jesus amen the angel of God that would come down and and would would start a bush on fire and and change a man and change and brother Adam said it changed the world forever think about that one man one encounter with God it changed the known world of that time and I I believe that we can also have that same encounter with God Amen you know as we look in the scriptures here we we look at this word quick and we know what that means it means to be made alive it means to be brought to life it means to be to be living and it's it's a spark it's something that that it comes into a place that was once dead but now it lives so it takes something to do that it don't just happen but if you find something that's dead and it comes to life something took place on the inside of that and Jesus you know he had the word of his resurrection he could look into the scriptures and he could find I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption because he and he knew in that that it would take three days or 72 hours for corruption to set him therefore he spoke and he said if you destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up again amen he if there had been no spark there had been no Dynamics there would have been no quickening there would have been no Resurrection the word is not a dead word it's a Living Word it changes people it delivers people it heals people amen it's not just something that we get up and we just say a few good things but we're looking for the word to come and have an effect on people's lives the word to come and to change the situation that we're living and we look at Moses and we see the word that it was spoke there around that burning bush has said let my people go that word brought a change and they changed the whole Known World of that day it changed Egypt from a superpower to nothing it changed the children of Israel from slaves Amen to free men and women of God that they were born to be amen the word always comes and when the spirit gets in that word it calls a quickening it causes a spark it causes something to take place and it causes something to a change to take place in Psalms 107 he said when they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble verse 19 he saved them out of their distresses and he sent his word but that word had an effect and it said he healed them amen he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions amen oh that man would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men so when his word comes and if it's his word with power it will have an effect Bank it will drive out sickness it will drive out sin it will drive out unbelief it will change a person as we saw in Moses it changed him from a 80 year old man backslidden on the back of the desert but he met that spark he met that Pillar of Fire for himself and his soul changed his thinking that where he would take a mule and he would take a rod and he would take a his wife and children and he would gather them together and he would go down to Egypt and if you ask him what he was going to do he'd tell you I'm going down to Egypt to take over amen because he knew what it was like to try it on his own decree in his own word he had heard the word before he had he had heard the word that he was the deliverer that the word had been promised that for 400 years my children would be in Egypt and and they would be in slavery but after that I will come and I will deliver them he heard all of that but until he met that spark for himself until he met that spot in his life to where he said at this moment it changed me and now it's not going to overcome me but I'm going to overcome it amen we can we can brother Brown said to Egypt where he said something along these lines and there's a paraphrase in here he said Egypt will either amen either uh dampen your faith or or destroy your faith or your faith will conquer it one or the other amen if you'll meet God for yourself God will come on the scene for you and will change your whole world it'll change all that is around you to change your home it'll it'll change your family it'll change your life amen think about that Moses went down there it was the same mule it was the same wife it was the same children it was the same Rod but now he had met somebody for himself and he met the spirit that was behind the worm he meant the power that was laying in there so this word has a movement to it it has breath it has life it it's when it's anointed by the spirit of God now we can look in second Corinthians 3 and verse 2 and it says here your Epistles written of our heart known in red of all men for as much as you're manifestly declared to be the Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God Amen with the spirit of the Living God not on the tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart now here's Paul the messenger for that age and he's bringing it out of the Old Testament into the New Testament he said what really God wanted to do was not just write on tables of stone he wanted to write in tables of heart that man was serving because they loved him not because of a law not because of a regulation not because of a do or don't list but they serve me and they live for me because of one thing they met me for themselves and there was a love affair between me and them amen he said and such as we trust we have through Christ to God we're not that we are sufficients of ourselves to think anything is of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who has also made us able Ministers of a new testament not of the letter but of the spirit not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life it is a minute but if the ministration of death ridden and engraved in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not stand fastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away with how shall not the ministration of the spirit be more glorious Hallelujah if that one was So Glorious that you couldn't look on a man's face and it was so much power there how much more should the spirit the administration of the spirit the power of the spirit the glory of the Lord be upon his people [Applause] Hallelujah that's what makes a church a church is not the people that is in there so much how many they got who they are what makes a church is the glory of the Lord it is the glory that fills this Temple it is the power of God it is the life of God that can come and Spark and move and change and deliver and set free that is the glory that we desire in this place it's not my glory it's not who I am it's not any of these other preachers or any of you it's the glory of God that's what we desire in our lives is the glory of God in our lives he said house shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for the ministration of condemnation be glory much more to the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory Hallelujah so if the administration of condemnation or the law had glory in it had miracles in it had signs and wonders in it had healings in it had deliverances in it come on look to the Bible it was under the administration of the letter or of the law but there was glory in there but Paul said we have moved from that to not just a dead letter but a living gospel because the holy spirit is here and it's not only just falling on a bush or falling on something else or on the ark or somewhere else it is now indwelling men and women of God as how much more should the glory of God be in the administration of the spirit so if we can look in the Old Testaments and see Deliverance how much more shall we look in our lives and see Deliverance if we can look there and see healing how much more should we look here and say healings and deliverances and signs and wonders and miracles [Applause] it's the glory of the Lord for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by reason of of the glory that Excellence for that which has done away was glorious much more that which remaineth as glorious seeing then that we have such hope we also have great plainness of speech and not as Moses would put a veil over his face that the children of Israel would not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remain at the same Veil untaken away in the read in the Old Testament which Baal is done away when Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their hearts nevertheless when it shall be turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away Hallelujah when it shall be turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and we're the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty hallelujah we're not under the ministration of bondage we're under the ministration of Liberty hallelujah we're not under the administration of do's and don'ts this message is not do's and don'ts this message is Liberty this message brings the Life of Christ down into a Believer that'll set them free from the bondages of sin because we're not under the administration of the law and you know burning this a certain day or doing this a certain day or taking this care for this turtle dove or this or that and other no he came down once and forever and the life of this lamb can now enter the spark can enter into you and it'll change you from do's and don'ts if you're still a bunch of do's and don'ts and that's all this message is to you then you ain't got the spark the glory has not been revealed in your life because in this spirit in this part there is Liberty hallelujah amen that's why I believe our services ought to have Liberty in them amen if God wants to move however he wants to move we're going to let God do what he wants to do amen if he wants to move in the Stillness if he wants to move in the loudness if he wants to move in the dance if he wants to move in the tongues it'll be whatever he wants to move I want God to have Liberty in our hearts I want the glory of not to just fill our hearts and fill this place but doing this morning I believe he's still that same kind of God that's the glory that was revealed in the Old Testament and they said when the glory of the Lord filled the temple the ministers couldn't even minister no more well that's the glory of it revealed and under the law under the under the bondage how much more shall the liberty of God when it sets people free and it sets bondage free and it breaks change and it breaks Darkness and Light shines in how much more is that Glory there's liberty how dare some man want to come and bind the people of God no no we've been brought to Liberty what what vindicate you know but what Vindicated Jesus was who he said he was was not all the Miracles and all the signs and all the Wonders yes that was part of it but what really Vindicated him who he was was he rose from the dead and listen what's going to vindicate us who we say we are is not going to be all the Miracles that we're going to have them we're going to have signs and wonders but all those are are part of it but we can't who we say we are amen is the lifting up of this flesh and it's changing it to such a place but it changes it from mortality into immortality from corruptible into incorruptible Hallelujah the light of God came down and it sparked that dead body that was laying there in a grave and it brought it back to life again you know brother I read it to you all the things that Jesus did and certainly appreciating all of his Vindication of God's word and what he did to fulfill it of Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils preaching the gospel to the poor fulfilling every word that God said he would do when he came and then also suffering for our sins and our sin to be the perpetuation of sins at the cross where no one else could have done it but him but above all that I think Easter sealed the whole thing we don't know what Easter is there's Resurrection because there had been prophets on the earth before who had prophesied there had been prophets on the earth before who healed the sick raised the dead done the same signs that Jesus did but Easter proved who he was it sealed the word of God forever for the True Believer and all Gloom and all doubt was shattered on that Blissful morning Hallelujah Hallelujah critic was shut up in a prison house man had been shut up before in prison houses religious people for this day seeing great religious moves and moving of the Holy Spirit and so forth but when this man died it seemed it settled it he was not who he said he was but he said I have power to lay my life down and I have power to take it up again Hallelujah and then go ahead I proved what he said to me that's what sealed it amen when he's something that was said and then it's turned around and it's proven he said God purpose to prove his word the truth there was only one man could do that and that was Jesus and he came and proved to that to be the truth it sealed it and that broke all the seals of glue and it scattered all the superstitions of religion where great men had raised up and said marvelous saying but every one of them were still in the grave but this Christian religion is the only one who has an empty tooth amen and empty too and that proves to me that he was God of the living and God of the Dead he was a God that could go down and die but he was a God that could come up again this quick and Empower this quickening Spirit as proves of the years he's the one who can Quicken the dead back to life again oh Hallelujah I want you to understand that same resurrection power is in the building this morning you might be dead in your sins or dead in your Traditions or dead of of years of nothingness but there's a God who's rich in Mercy there's a voice here this morning that opened the grave oh and Lazarus can walk out of there and there's liberty here this morning and say lose some of those great clothes Hallelujah unbind his feet so he can move a little bit I'm fine 's hands so he can worship I'll take it around his mouth so he can see the Praises of almighty God Hallelujah I said this morning lies with come forth there's a spark here this morning that'll raise a dead it'll break the two seals on the tomb that has sealed you in year after year after year if it's all right this morning we're gonna have some church [Applause] because as many of you've been sealed in tombs of your Traditions amen sealed in your tombs of past failures and past mistakes and you never can get past them and you're wrapped up in all that nonsense but there's a voice of Resurrection here this morning there's a spark that's greater than your lukewarmness that there's a spark that's greater than your backslid condition there's a spark that is greater than what you're going through Hallelujah there's a spark that's greater than the sickness that's here this morning here's a spark that is greater than the sin that is holding you when he proved by his promise this great conquering power on Easter he proved he could conquer death Hell In The Grave I am he that was dead was dead was dead he's not dead no more so if this God ain't dead he don't want a dead people amen how can we expect to say we got the same life he had and we're dead no no we ain't got it there's a spark there's a there's a life hallelujah what a statement I am he that was dead but I'm alive again and forevermore in other words ain't another time I'm going down in that grave because this one time has sealed it forever who I am Hallelujah and I have the keys to death hell and the grave what a statement for anyone to make but not only did he make the statement he proved what he had and what he said was true foreign alone is a dead letter but there's a light or a spark that'll make it live amen you know he's he said like this one place he said what if we had two brand new cars all the seats were made out of dough skin you know the softness of leather easy and soft to sit in floorboards would plush steering wheel was nickel plated diamond studs everywhere the engine had been I was mechanically tested to be exactly the right engine for the car all the bearings were greased up the tires were puncture proof and blowout free how do you realize what kind of car we got available the tires were puncture proof and blow out free and been scientifically tested they had been pushed off the assembly line both of them both of them filled up with gasoline that's the running power of the gasoline because it's the octane but now when you're going to start them although both of them look just alike there's one of them that don't have any Spark hello any firing power you say well the power's in the gasoline I don't care how much power is in the gasoline until there's a spark that power and that that what's in there is confirmed to be ghastly it might as well be just water no matter how much theologians claim or how well you got your church Center how much education you can pump into it how much you like the Bible until that wave sheath the Holy Spirit comes to that person and quickens that word the gasoline represents a word but it might as well be water if there ain't no spark it won't move without the spirit well now listen I'm gonna go through a lot of these this morning we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the Dynamics it needs a dynamic power of God the resurrected power of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring the past that this is gasoline it might be a gasoline can but it can still have just water in it and if y'all ever made that mistake thought you had some gasoline in the gas can look like a gas can when poured it off in the engine you ain't going nowhere you ain't mowing no grass you're not doing nothing but sputtering come on now there's a lot of sputtering going around amen because they've not put that octane or the word on the inside of them and then allow the spark of God to come down and ignite what is there oh yeah amen they've allowed other spirits to enact bitterness that's on the inside of there hello somebody they allowed other spirits to come and ignite hatefulness that's on the inside of there and unforgiveness on the inside of there and spirits of every kind but let's get the right things on the inside listen I'm not saying you don't need the word you got to have the word because you can have all the spark you want to it if it ain't nothing but water it ain't going nowhere amen but we must have the word of God lying upon line precept upon precept it's got to be put on an attitude amen why there's a spark that we need to bring it to life he said it'll only be said if it might be a gasoline can but it could still just be water the only proof is put the life on it and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not hallelujah amen you let the power of God start moving through here it'll prove to a lot of you whether you've got gasoline or you got water amen but if there's gasoline on the inside it'll be a deep that calleth into the deep and there'll be a deep to respond hey brother Timothy you trying to make us have an explosion sure am en you said well I'm a quiet person well listen there's there's quite and there's formal two different things you can be quiet but not be formal hello you can be loud and jumping and be formal amen amen but what we want amen is something igniting taking place amen the power of God that'll make the car crank and go down the road it'll make it live it'll make it amen live and amen not just on a Sunday morning or a Wednesday night but every day of your life it'll make you husbands live like a husband ought to live it'll make your leads your children like a husband ought to lead your children and make wives live like wives ought to live and children live like children ought to live he says when you try to put the Holy Spirit into nomination you're as much as trying he said you can get a sputter but it'll ruin your engine get it full of carbon he said I'm so glad there's a ten thousand octane power the word of God and there's a holy ghost to light it up to resurrect the power of God in a man's life or woman's life or in church that'll prove that Cadillac down the road Yonder on the dining they'll show that Cadillac down the road under the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which will come back which come back and was weighed over the people at the day of Pentecost making them the same yesterday today and forever and it goes on in and he said there have been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides but there's got to come one that has come has to come a real bride that's not only got the mechanics but it's also got the Dynamics that makes the church live and move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place what is it good good does it do to polish the heart oh the hubs on the outside and you can have the most awesome car in the world and it can be just as pretty as it can be this is what he's saying give it a simonized job which is a polishing job you can polish it all up and she can be shiny and pretty but on the inside of her you hit the old starter button there ain't no life oh well what good has it been for you to spend all that time polishing up amen the outside of your life went on the inside on the inside bitterness is coming out and hatred is coming out but you're polishing up the outside so everybody thinks you're a Christian everybody believes you're surely a Son of God and a man but on the inside growling about this and growling about that hateful about this and hateful about that come on somebody amen there needs to be a change on the inside no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be Dynamics to make it work that's what he proved that's what Easter proved it wasn't the only the word he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ that was cold dead and stiff in the grave shake the life again and rise up and roll away the stone and say ah him he that was dead he was so dead to the son said he was the moon said he was the star said nature said he was and now the whole world has to recognize he's alive again he was not only the mechanics he was the Dynamics and he'd been the groom the bride has to come also forth because it's part of him it came beyond the manifestation the Fulfillment of all Revelations any others that spoke of the Bride it can only manifest it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him that's why he said the works that I do shall ye do also until the church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics the spirit of God that moved him to do the things he did he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride Hallelujah John 14 12 said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he live also I give him a charge of my Dynamics and his mechanics that the word will not be able to stand up will be able to withstand it I'll raise him up again the last day that's the Easter message the Dynamics and the mechanics together amen the mechanics working with the without the Dynamics is no good neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics it takes both of them word and spirit Spirit and Truth takes two wings to fly it only work as they come together want to sit still and the other go up the only thing that thing that there is to it yet you might they both might look alike they might claim to be churches they might claim to be the bride but one has the mechanics and Dynamics that'll take it down the road he said the other just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come the fire is made to connect to the octane and that gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every motion it moves every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanics with the Dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickens it's the spark that fires it's not the gasifiers it's the spark I mean hey I went out and poured gas all over it but we go buy a burn pile before and you can jump up and down all you wanted to it wasn't going to burn nothing but let me tell you if you ever got a spark to it if you ever let a spark get out it was going to burn and it was going to explode I met every witness that I I hey maybe I'm the only fire bug around here amen you know I I I I remember one time as a young man I throwed a bunch of gasoline I didn't realize how explosive that stuff was and I just poured it all out I said well a little do good a lot to do better that's my idea of it so I just let this downstairs real good I walked away from there and I come back and I lit that dude up we had some shouting and screaming going on for sure amen it exploded us Sparks and Embers all over the place it's that limbs that were lifted up into the heavens all kinds of things were taking place I was running for my life amen amen that's what happens to a lot of people when they ain't expecting an explosion amen they might be sitting there dead informal but all of a sudden the explosion to take place and they'll start running for the lives they'll leave out the door and they go get in their cars but those who want it those that desire they said Lord not Lord not let me just witness an explosion let me be the explosion Let It Ride inside of my life hallelujah what good is a car going to do you sit in your driveway let me just sitting on the shelf somewhere and that's all you know is a bunch of quotes you can quote them better than some preachers but you can't live it but I tell you there is a lie that can come on the inside it'll make that quote get off a shelf or out of your head and get down in your heart and you'll run right over the top of that devil I told you this before and I told it at the camera this is a good story on the way this church once uh one evening I think it was a Wednesday night we're riding along going down 160. pray pray that bridge to get fixed we've been out three years come on now and so anyway we're riding down that road and I'm just sun is in my face and I kind of meditate and ain't really paying no attention all of a sudden my last second Vision I saw a snake come out come right out into the road dead snake I'm riding a look over sister said uh I tell you what I didn't see that snake coming she said I think the better part of that he didn't see you coming I got to think about it as I told that at that Youth Camp I got to thinking about now we don't just got a bunch of cars just been sitting polishing the Hub wearing the right dress wearing the right hair wearing the right thing doing the right no no we got some cars that'll go down the road and that snake on one at Monday Tuesday morning after you got back or whatever he decided you know what he said you know what I'm going to walk out in front of him or I'm going to crawl out whatever he and I'm going to come right out and I'm going to stop him like I did before I'm gonna stop them in the middle of the track I'm going to put my hand up and I'm gonna stop this the next thing you know boom Hallelujah he found out this was in the car that was just sitting in the Mom and Daddy's home no more this is a car that'll run right over the top of him I love him let it run right over him in the bedroom in their cars no matter where he steps out give up you be careful Hallelujah there's a power living on the inside of some young people that'll put trademarks on your eyes that'll run you over I got to thinking about that as they lay as they laid there in that road like what happened what in the world happened another Devil comes up said what happened to you he said well what happened was I was gonna do like I always did that came back from Council before and I stopped them they came back from places of the spirit of God moving before and I stopped them I got to hear nothing and stopped them before but something was different this time something was different this time it was I didn't get out in front of a car that was parked it was running down the highway Hallelujah did not see some cars this morning that's going down the highway it's going to Healing it's going down to Joy that's going down the speaking of tongue it's going down to all things God has Hallelujah it'll ride over every devil hey put ten Devils up it don't matter you don't have enough power there's a power that's on the inside of me is greater than he that's in the world but there's some people that don't like fire but I personally like fire for Philip something by the fire I remember when that fire struck your heart it was real I don't know I know the devil wants to tell you it wasn't but it was it is amen Hallelujah but you know I was up there and bounce pretty Place who's ever been to Banff it's one of the most maybe one day in the Millennium I get to live up there it'd be awesome but anyway I was out on the boat with a brother his wife brother Jerry Fury and wife says Debbie me and sister Ruth was taking this Tour on a boat on this side was a big old burn over nothing but just dead nothing's looking a little few little Twigs coming up and things coming up on this side the most beautiful Forest you've ever seen in your life and that driver that boat he back calls me to tip it over because he said let me ask y'all something he said which side of this lake has the most life in it and uh others say well it's got to be that beautiful Forest over there and I'm just sitting there listening thinking about this he said no he said actually that side over there that looks like nothing it's got the most life in it he said because these trees you know we said well we out here we got we practice uh Fire Burns and fire bans and and we try to control fires they sit back in the history of time that when the fire started by lightning storm or whatever man my man or whatever it just burnt but that was Nature's Way of replenishing itself it was Nature's Way of taking the old growth out and and the Newton growth coming and in that new growth that's where life is you know about tip the boat over amen because I remember what brother Brown talked about the old growth and the new growth and life being in there he said but on this side of this Valley up here is Banff and he said we let that fire get out of the burned down bound he said so we practice A Fire Control I thought man I told brother Jerry it sounded like a lot of preachers to me a lot of churches that wanted practice Fire Control and they only wanted to burn so far or burn so much or do as I said let the fire go Let It Burn let's just burn it down this morning amen because fire brings life [Applause] hey man I got the research on that on on fire bringing life and I got it here again amen the Sequoias over there lives for 300 or 3 000 years and they've been some of them seen history for a long time and you know they they grow up and they become great big magnificent trees and they so I've never actually got to go one of these days I'd like to but they're so beautiful and so tall and so high he said but it takes a fire to come down and to be for them to be able to reproduce and so you know what happens people the the naturalists or the tree huggers and some of them are called they try to protect the environment but really they're actually hurting the environment they're hurting the reproduction and sooner or later these old trees are going to be gone and there's no Wildlife going to come back up again because they have taken the fire out and without the fire they can't reproduce and that's how they're born they're born in the fire a fire gives them three things they need for regeneration that blows my mind three things first one it punches a hole in the force which allows more light to come it allows more light to come and more water to fall [Applause] Hallelujah that's why we need to fire god in our midst because it needs to punch a hole in our unbelief it needs to punch a hole in our shadows and a lie a weary fear of weird feeling and punch a hole right through it that light can come back here [Applause] the second thing it does it heats up the cone and those mature trees without harming the trees hello somebody well I'm a mature Christian well the fire ain't gonna hurt you hey man it's going to do nothing but help you without harming the trees so those cones can open up and they begin to rain seeds down to the ground and the third thing that it does it clears away all the dead matter leaves and it covered up the soul and it caught the deadness and and the and the past mistakes and the past failures and the things that have fallen to the ground the fire of God comes down and it cleans them all out because wow there's got to be seeds to fall in this ground and this ground has to be opened up so we can receive the life Hallelujah and this winter comes and the snow begins to cover and it begins to get in a a real cold situation and it seems like there's not going to be enough life it seems like there ain't no way this is going to work out there's a lot of coldness there's a lot of weariness there's a lot of hurts there's a lot of this and it's covering me but the light comes up and it gets stronger and stronger and the fire had burned a hole in there and it begins to melt away all the formalities and it begins to melt away all the coldness and it begins to melt away all the other things that lay there until that seed is looking up at the Sun and it says what happens at light Sparks a life [Applause] whoa Jesus that's why we need to fire god to come service after service because we know the devil he loves to build up bitterness and weird feelings and spooky things and all that kind of stuff around us to where we can't receive nothing of God but I say God Let the Fire Fall Let the Fire Fall and burn out all of that to where the life can shine through again and Spark life again and from their birth among the ashes these seedlings have become the Groves we see today out of the ashes trees nearly 300 foot tall but man wants to control it man wants to say God only does so you know and I want to call it a bunch of wildfire I got to bring this in right here 's a brother and brother brother Wayne's Church got up and just preached here before we came to that camp he said there's wild Brother Bear talk about Wildfire no fire so I'd rather have some Wildfire than no fire at all so he said right here is Wildfire no fire Wildfire no fire he said so somewhere right here in the middle is where we want to be he said but if I'm going to make a mistake I'm gonna be on the power side [Applause] he said that's where I want to be on the power side amen I believe if we ought to move if we make a mistake we ought to make it towards the power side amen every time say God send the power just now let it so build in our hearts and build in this service it'll burn out our bitterness and hatred and strife and weird feelings and all that nonsense [Applause] all those dead matter that's the crowd burn it out Hallelujah there has to be life that comes in this place it has to be life that comes in this place and if God has to burn through the bushes open up a path to where his light can shine I say God burn he said well Holy Spirit he said now the Holy Spirit comes of course it wasn't sent to who those that won't receive it it wasn't sent to them instead of God told me he said I don't believe it I don't care what you say in fact you raise the dead hear the sick prove it anyway I still wouldn't believe certainly not you're an unbeliever It Don't Mean a Thing to you it wasn't even sent to you but it was sent to those who believe amen the message is to the believer to them that perish its foolishness but to them that are in Christ and part of that seed it's life he talks about his his little story of a farmer that put a hag under a hand we've heard it he said the little egg little Eagle he took a little he found a little Eagle egg and he put it under a chicken she was roosting and so or nesting so she put her put that egg under her and she hatched out this funniest looking chicken odd little fella didn't look like them his feathers wouldn't like the rest of them all the rest of them chick chickens recognize he's odd he didn't even like the diet she was feeding him he didn't like that scratching in the barn yard he didn't have nothing to do with that he wondered why he had to be the odd one around he never tasted anything like that that he liked he just eat enough to keep him alive because he he didn't like the taste of it he because why he wasn't a chicken to begin with a hand would clucking old days of Miracles are passed and there's no such a thing just join a church and believe you've got the Holy Ghost it just wasn't hidden right now with that little guy so he followed around the hen to one day the old Eagle knew she'd laid some missed so many eggs and there was one missing she knew that that eagle was somewhere and she starts out on the hunt for him and she circles over the Mountaintop and down the valley and over everywhere where he might be about this time it's time for him to be born it's time to be hatched out he said maybe a crow come in and picked him up or something else something picked up my egg that egg was in his mind he knew he had a son somewhere I'm going to hunt him down [Applause] whoa Jesus and so does God he's that great Eagle in his thoughts he knew he would have a church he knew he would have a people no matter what's cuddling them now hello no matter if your feelings are cuddling you and you're it's just petting you know God said I got a son there and I'm looking for him oh sin is over there cuddled up with you drinking and your alcohol and smoking and your nonsense of the world it's cuddling you saying it'll be all right everybody's going to heaven everybody's going to be okay cuddling with you yeah yeah how many times we cuddle with stuff our own feelings our own thoughts entertain them we ought to be casting them down amen cuddling with them he said one day as The Story Goes if this eagle flew over Barnyard and she found him oh for that Resurrection wrecked to recognize that he wasn't a chicken after all he was an eagle all of a sudden he heard a scream and that scream let look up this way look up this way oh my let's just bring it on down to where we had it was an eagle that started circling around Louisiana you know when it got over in the Mississippi a little bit because I knew it had four eggs over there and all of a sudden these eggs have been over there been hatched out under the denominational system and they thought that was all that is ever going to be but something on the inside of them said man there's got to be something more than what I got there's got to be something that's all that's something that can move me more than what I'm being here and I see this church going off in the wrong direction and I don't want to go that way but all of a sudden the eagle got over there and it screamed out and said hey you never was a chicken to begin with [Applause] I don't know if y'all know this or not but I'm gonna drop this in right here but brother L was sitting in his living room and his two kids was there and the house and all of a sudden as he I believe he was reading a message book or something along that lines and all of a sudden hears he looks up and there's a light that come into his room and it begins to Circle and it goes down his hallway down to where his kids were at and he goes your mind did you see it yes sir I did Jay did you say yes sir I did he said what was it I say what was it it was the light of God and it was circling their house saying hey this ain't Who You Are I got a better life for you I got something more for you Hallelujah and I'm not going to leave you where I found you but I got a word for you and I'm gonna bring you through trials I'm gonna bring you through every kind of thing and I'm gonna lift you up cause you never wasn't a chicken to begin with Hallelujah you never want the chicken to begin with chicken food couldn't satisfy you a chicken dog couldn't do nothing for you but once you got a hold of Eagle food I've been longing for [Applause] it's a light it's a spark something that will make a man who had a good place had a nice place on family land give it all up leave culture behind this will be open now leave culture behind leave thoughts behind leave what he thought he had built behind leave it all behind that's it brother you could have had a lot I don't know why I'm going here but we're gone you could have had a lot better easier life I'll say it that way maybe over Mississippi ease your finances wife had a good job things were going along pretty good but Eagle Cry came it ain't all been easy no it ain't easy to follow Jesus it ain't easy to follow him and what he decrees and where he says go you gotta sometimes you know every time you need to sell out Lock Stock and Barrel what was that brother Joe you need to burn the ship hey man burn it because why why did they burn those ships because they wasn't going back as long as you live a ship in the harbor you sooner or later you're going to get back on it and you're going to go back to where you came from but the captain knew you hey we're going to conquer this land we're going to overcome this land I don't know what's here that don't matter burn the ship and some of y'all need to burn the ships burn the past burn what's behind you let the fire of God fall on it and burn it all away cause I can't go back I Won't Go Back [Applause] cause there's nothing to go back to I'm all in brother Phillip it's one of the first songs You Sang I Won't Go Back I can't go back and we ain't going back now he ain't going back now he burned the ship ah the devil wants to whisper all kinds of things and you're here but all you got to do is turn him back and say hey devil see that back there is burnt there ain't nothing but ashes back there it's gone all my past forgiven all my faults buried in the sea of his forgetfulness all the things that I ever done he told me them all and he forgave me of them all and he burned them all there's nothing to go back to he said Mama how do I get to you just start jump and start flopping your wings because you're an ego sometimes it feels like a hard flop one job after another brother hell one mistake this that and the other going on we're about to lose this hat and it seemed like well and not all the time behind just voices saying you'll come back you'll go right back to what you were and you're flopping and you're flopping and you're flopping but all of a sudden there's a wind that blows and you catch a win and that wind takes you and all things are possible that wins a Jehovah Jireh that provides for all of your needs that win is Jehovah Raphael heal all your sickness that wind will lift you up higher than you ever been Hallelujah you want a brighter fire that let them blow tell me how I know I know I'm telling you I love fires right out here if I burnt this whole place down you know like what I did I got me a dozer and I went at Dozer so I took me about made me a burn band all the way around that thing burn what do you call them things I scratched the grass off of it all the way around and I went all the way around that property right over there oh your trailer wasn't here yet and I took it all the way around yeah pushed and pushed the Dozer over and put her in park got off and brother Jeremy Shriner was here he's like man what's it going to do I said it's going to burn he said you ain't about it I said man this evening the fire is going to get the Rowan's going to get down and we're just going to have ourselves a good Tire so we got over there and I lit that dude up brother Jeremy he had one he lit it up and it was going just fine but I don't know what it is about a fire wind gets in it can be no wind and it seems like ain't blowing a long time but all of a sudden the fire starts and wind gets in it and buddy that wind got in that fire and it got bigger and it got bigger and then it got bigger and what I had planned didn't work out they found a spot right over there on that L shape of that property that wasn't quite wide enough here I thought I had it fixed where it's only going to go so far I thought I had it fixed it was only going to burn so much I thought I had it fixed it was only on but you know what that fire began to build up to such a point it jumped over what I thought Hallelujah I say let the wind get in the fire the wind of the Holy Ghost let it begin to build up in your life it'll jump over what you think it'll jump over what you think is possible and it'll go into impossibilities Hallelujah this fire is a fire that I can build this fire I'm talking about it's not one I put a match to this fire he put it to it and there ain't no wind there ain't no devil think about that a lot of times we create we we we bring the wind as the Holy Ghost and it is but you know the devil's got winds as well but even harder he blows at your fire the bigger it's going to get shh see hey man you better come with a little bitty flame out of Youth cam but it's a flame and the devil's finger you know man's always into he's always done what God's already done you know he made a mat you ever seen them candles you can blow them out and they pop right back on hello everybody man they still got them I think they do can't blow them out and they popped right back on and they popped right back on and it popped right back on that's what the devil's been trying to do this summer year he'd been trying to blow you out and all of a sudden the fires back up again [Applause] and he tries to blow it out back up again and it only makes it bigger it only makes it stronger it only makes it Greater let the wind of Satan blow all he wants to against this Church of the Living God she's only going to get greater she's only going to get bigger she's only going to have more power the dynamic power of God will answer their Quest To This Day he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no hen going to hold you Hallelujah an eagle a real Eagle recognizes the call of God's word an eagle to an eagle the word to the word Hallelujah the word predestinated you to the word written for the hour you realize your position he's hunting for it then this Earthly body is quickened brought by the earthquake and in spirit of God to obedience to the word of God quickly when he wanted to know how he could get there with her he had been taught he couldn't do that you can't get no higher than you can jump that's a chicken hello he said that was a chicken that said that you can't get no higher than you can jump he said but this ego said that's not so look at the chickens well look at no matter what their chickens are you're an eagle just start spreading those wings get a little exercise of them start moving up the word to the word the worst that I do shall you do also he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also because he lives I I live he lives also and of the spirit that raised him up from the dead dwells in you it'll Quicken your mortal body what does it do this Easter I want you to haunt it to me he says to me more to you than ever any other Easter ever did I want you to see it we know what it done for him I want you to see what it'll do for you it has done the same for you hello he raised a mortal body of a fleshly body up from the grave but greater than that is a spiritual body every one of them were born dead in sins dead as we could be to our own beliefs and our own ideas and our own thinking you said well brother Timothy this is a church full of holy people might have some holy people in it now but they wouldn't always holy no we were all born in sin and shaped iniquity born dead speaking lies laying in a grave seem to be no hope Satan is sealed it with a two it's still the Tomb of the Stone put a guard around it say there was no way you're going to get out of it well no way you're going to rise up above it well no way is going to live it with no way you could do it but light came down and that body that was dead and sins and wickedness and iniquities it raised out oh my and he rolled the stone that helped he broke all the seals off some of you had to seal a tobacco on your life some of you had to seal of alcohol on your life some of you had to seal a pornography on your life some of you had the Seal of lust on your life some of you had all kind of ungodly seals that had sealed you in a turn but he broke them [Applause] to tell you every devil seal is broke it is broken the Church of the Living God is a free Church freeing the liberty of God freeing the righteousness of God free in the spirit of God there is now no condemnation you once walked maybe with a big cigarette out of your mouth your women once had short hair and pain and painted up carried on shorts but something screamed and you look to it and it was the word of God no no more shorts for me no more liquor for me no more lying no more stealing no more of this or whatever the spirit that raised him up from the dead is now dwelling you is also brought your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection subjection to what Christ amen these things that I think is all right for women to wear slacks the word says no so it quickens you to that you're drawn to it you become part of the word it brought your body subject well you say well let me tell you something my pastor I don't care what your pastor said it's what the word says you know we've had message girls that was in message churches that had gotten married and moved to another church and for the first time in their life they heard it was wrong to wear makeup raised up in a message Church listen I don't care what your pastor says is what the word says if you want to be a chicken go on and be a chicken but if the pastor speaks different in the word then he's not a feeder of eagles he's a feeder of chickens amen the Bible said it's wrong to do that and the man and so forth and all you do is wrong days of Miracles are passed that's wrong the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever he said well that's just mental telepathy that's just some kind of mind reading this discernment all those Vision things nonsense they are to chickens they are to chickens they don't know what Eagle food is but brother when you hear that scream there's something in you you're an eagle to begin with you are that seed that resurrection of the s-o-n is dull and the wave sheath has weighed over you if the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the Dynamics of the word dwells in you it'll also Quicken your mortal body it'll bring it to life that spirit that once like to drink run around commit adultery quick it's now Quicken why the thing died and you're now resurrected Therefore your bodies is a temple of the Dynamics because from the beginning you were part of the mechanics hello did you catch that we've always been part of the mechanics I was in his mind before the foundation of the world I was a son before the founder the mechanics the word spoke of me but when he comes on the inside you're not just the Temple of the mechanics you're a temple of the Dynamics the spirit that lives on the inside of you and if that spirit that raised up Jesus from the grave dwells in you you potentially have life led by the spirit to Quicken you the word to you to believe it that little thing keeps pushing up as it grows notice at Pentecost and acts their bodies were quick in the new life look at a bunch of little cowards sitting there afraid afraid to claim the things of God pray to the claim what God had told him what Jesus has spoke but all of a sudden the Dynamics came and it not only filled their Spirit but it quickened their mechanics and their bodies were quick and they were no more cowards they went right into the face of the people and said you men of Judea and you that dwell in Jerusalem this is that what the prophet Joel spoke of so many people that are afraid that more some woman will laugh at you for having long hair or quit wearing makeup some of you men are afraid your organization will throw you out when you're baptized your congregation is spiritual baptism you need to close yourself into the upper room to the Dynamics come because it changed them it'll change you it quickened them it'll Quicken you it made them different it'll make you different they were to change people from that on it quickened them from the old life of being a coward to the lion of the tribe of Judah they're absolutely face martyr they nailed to the crosses crucified upside down burnt throwing lions dead no more cowards death had no victory over them Dynamics was now in the mechanics Quicken them till they spoke a Heavenly language he is the Dynamics we'll read a few here before we go he is a dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is the mechanics Apostles preachers prophets teachers so forth he is the Dynamics that works that it works by certain Dynamic which is called the fire the fire that fires off the gas he's the fire that's in the combustion chamber and when the gas the word is poured over that combustion chamber he is the one that sets her fire he is the one that confirms it he is the power of the Resurrection he is God he is the fire and that's what he is mechanics ain't what runs an automobile is the Dynamics that runs it and mechanics will not run a church the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets them the word it's not the Seminary that can teach you Theology and Greek interpretation but the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost is there to set that a fire and to bring it to pass not the mechanics the Dynamics the word and spirit they are one that gives life said last night we have put so much of on the mechanics and not enough on the Dynamics he said my body is a mechanics and my body will not operate without dynamics of spirit the spirit operates my body no more in the automobile with no gasoline in it with no fire and power no matter how I'm finding the Dynamics or I'm the mechanics are mean the the cylinders the plugs the points whatever more you've got to have current also you've got to have those together that's the way God is and he said our educational system our denominational system has took the place of the Holy Spirit leading the church our great fine training of ministers and things has taken the place of the prayer meetings and all all-time way we used to get to God instead of having preachers we got lectures men that just knows the word just as well they can sit there and put it all together and wait there's just astounding they know the mechanics but they ain't got the Dynamics we want the Dynamics I don't care about the mechanics I want the Dynamics it's the prophet of God and the world Fallen apart he said I don't know how the how it works the car and how it all runs the Pistons and how this all works together I just know one thing if you put the Dynamics on there it'll make it drive I don't know how the car runs out there I don't know how all that works but if you put the Dynamics on it it'll make it dry that's what we know God made the promise I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy how's he going to do it I don't know I just know the Dynamics of God's system that's the main thing he said we have studied the mechanics until it's become all mechanical what good is it if it's just mechanical it won't bring the spirit of God it won't bring the power of God where is that Pentecostal blessing that used to flow through the churches that's the reason our world is falling apart because we got away from the real principles of God and educated men into systems and things that's what got us into the condition we are today and I believe that's why our world is falling apart Mercy so many more I want to read this one so we'll write about what about it now brother Timothy what about the Dynamics what shall I do with Jesus called Christ the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite to the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds and thousands of years will raise up and the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight in the skies the Dynamics of this church is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I say it won't be less Dynamics it's going to be more Dynamics and the Dynamics of this church will be and how porn of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah not unless Holy Ghost more Holy Ghost you know I got God I was got on to one time in another Youth Camp because I preached too strong in the Holy Ghost I said Lord if that's all I'm guilty of God hallelujah I'll be guilty of that I know we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've got to have the Dynamics moving in our midst we got to have the power that'll make this church not only run down the road but rise up in the air Amen to the dead in Christ will rise under the Dynamics of this church the dead in Christ will come up in that Resurrection under the Dynamics the outpouring of the Holy Ghost is coming upon us so don't look for Less look for more let's bow our hands a lot more things but I ain't got no more strength some of you need that spark or refilling some of you need to filling but there's many of you need to refilling because there's one feeling but many refillings the devil of course wants to tell you you never got nothing just going back in the same old hole you know I am mechanics and I am a vessel of the Dynamics maybe you feel like you've been flopping a little bit flopping around from one feeling to another and one thing to another why don't you just keep flopping just keep moving them wings the winds are going to blow it's not going to be winds sure might be winds that try to blow you down what you need to look in that face of that storm and said it's going to take a stronger wind than this I'm not quitting I'm not turning around I'm going all the way with Jesus I wonder how many this morning we just want to stand to your feet lift both hands up as a yielded vessel and say God I want those Dynamics I want that refilling I want it I want to go no I want it Lord
