those that are suffering and think of our brother Ron and sister Erica Parker Lord and how brother Donnie continues to hold her up and stand strong in his position at his post of Duty even though Satan is literally warring right on the borders of his land father I just pray that you give him strength as you give her strength and we remember many others this evening Lord that have penned in requests and are Desiring a certainly a touch in their body as they fight the sicknesses of the day but Lord your word is common Lord you've said that you would be with us see even in us to the End of the Age Lord we find ourselves right at the end of that age and we're depending upon your father we need you Lord more than we ever needed you before we have a group of young people that will be boarding a bus in a few hours to attend a camp meeting up in Ohio and Lord we've prayed for these meetings and we've prayed for each one of the young people and Lord Desiring that the ministers Lord

heart-turning business we believe that you have turned our hearts back to the original faith pray that you do it for one more this evening so we give you this service the opportunity to serve you and worship you in spirit and in truth we counted a great privilege and a great honor Lord for the offering that will be taken up and the tithes that will be taken we pray Lord that it would go to the furtherance of your kingdom and its intended purpose in this Christ's name amen amen why don't you turn around and shake hands with somebody that's near you if the brothers would take up the offering

that faith that was delivered on the day of Pentecost is once again manifested in Sons and Daughters of God and Father our hearts have been turned to this word and Lord we ask that you'll just continue to do what only you can do father let our words be sensitive tonight Lord and may our hearts be willing to receive Lord from your great hand Lord we pray you'll bless each young people as

fire for the things of God if there be anything holding them back hindering them Father Lord they will just come and they will surrender themselves to the to the mind of God allow themselves to be changed so Lord we just Commit This service now into your hands we pray you'll bless the giving of the word and the receiving father for we ask it in Jesus name tonight amen God bless you if you have your Bibles you can be turned into Matthew 6 verse 14. I was looking at actually studying and studying actually a different thought the other day and as we was coming out here to Austin's graduation party as I was driving down the road the Lord just put this thought in my heart and I said oh boy here we go again but I want to speak to you tonight on finding forgiveness in the midst of pain finding forgiveness in the midst of pain and we find here in Matthew 6. in verse 14 for if you forgive men their Tres trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you so notice there is a contingency here if you forgive men their trespasses your father your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive you your trespasses God bless you you can have your seats tonight this word trespass I just find it pretty pretty shocking or amazing because it means an offense shocking right that's what it means but it also means a misdeed it means a a side slip it means a deviation or a lapse and it could be unintentional an unintentional error or it can be a willful transgression so whether it's unintentional or whether it's willful we are to forgive one another's transgressions and if we forgive that our heavenly father will forgive us and the message is turning North where brother Brown says don't fight one another but as long as the devil's got you fighting one another he don't have to fight at all he will just sit back as a picnic watching you fight one another and laugh at you professing to have the Holy Ghost and fighting one another but he says love one another Jesus said well men we all men know that you're my disciples when you have loved one for another he said that's the greatest evidence of the Holy Ghost that I know is when you love one another and then the message go wake Jesus he says he says and as long as Satan has got us fighting one another while he don't have to fight at all but as long as we forget that fight notice as long as we forget that fight and join arms and hearts and say we're brothers we're on we're Christian Soldiers then that great Revival no economical counsel will ever touch that no sir that's the choice of God the elect that's been called and we each of us here tonight and if I ask for a show of hands many of us here we have been hurt at some point by somebody or something let's just be honest maybe it was your best friend they forgot to call you on your birthday you know what that's your best friend you expected them to call you and you was hurt you got offended and maybe it was mom or dad that criticize a career choice or maybe you left a certain job and the wife scolded you because you know this one did this this one's better that or maybe you was bullied as a child or or maybe your spouse and you had a fight now know how the devil loves to get in between that and you give the cold shoulder the silent treatment for a few hours on end and somebody's sleeping on the couch Dear God or maybe the pastor didn't speak to you or maybe the preacher preached on your toes and you got offended somebody told him you know but the Bible says that the holy spirit is still a discerner of the very thoughts and the intents of the heart or maybe you heard that a friend behind your back said some very negative things about you those are things they're crushing notice we're talking about forgiveness finding forgiveness in the midst of the pain these things are painful when somebody speaks evil against you and yet they profess to be your brother profess to be your sister they profess to love you and you know they got your back right but yet they're saying slanderous things to you but Proverbs tells us that a brother offended is harder one than a strong City think about that a brother that's offended is harder one than a strong City and their contentions talk about this brother his contentions are like the bars of a castle impregnable he has got it there you are not going to break through he's got his defenses up and these are acts of pain somebody who's been pain who's been wronged who's been you know who who's felt this and many times it's gut-wrenching and it strikes the pit of our stomachs and when we've been mistreated especially by those that claim to love us and especially by those that you love see this pain can lead behind an emotional wound of rejection fear betrayal insecurity and just like a physical wound that's unattended will get tankered and will get infected so will this emotional wound if it's not taken care of it'll get cankered and it will get infected and then you'll have feelings of resentment you had feelings of bitterness Revenge nobody hears ever wanted to get revenge right it's Human Nature it's this nature but see instead of choosing forgiveness a lot of times we choose to drink the poison of unforgiveness and we want to hold this over the person that violated us as if you know we got them you know we're we're persecuting them but we're not persecuting them at all we're only hurting ourselves see unforgiveness is poison to the soul it's a sin that locks the unforgiving person in their own self-made prison last time I spoke we spoke about walking out I'm talking to you how tonight how to stay to stay out to stay from that prison to not allow yourself to go back into that prison and it takes a constant state of forget or forgiveness you have to be willing you know forgiveness is not easy it's not easy it's it's easier for somebody to punch you than to say a slanderous word about you because you can get through that pretty quick and I find that this word forgiveness here's the definition it says to cease to feel resentment how many of you've ever been wrong don't raise your hand man how many listen how many of you still holding on to it unbeknownst to you is still there maybe this brother and his name comes up in a flood of emotions grips you you begin to sweat or maybe you just remember every detail of the hurt every aspect of the pain whether it be somebody who said someone you as a child and yet you buried that thing so deep but yet because it's there because it's not been forgiven yet it just keeps reoccurring and through processes of life especially at low times in our Christian walk those things can tend to resurface and rise up see Satan is there to try to destroy us and he will use things in our life especially on unforgiving things that we haven't got over yet to bring us down thinking that you're hurting your brother or hurting your sister or maybe a family member but see synonyms of forgiveness is Absolution you have to completely absolve the debt it means to Pardon to excuse the offense without exacting any penalty my that is hard because you know what if you're like me you gotta fight nature right something about you you're a fighter you don't like to be punched around when somebody says something you want to say something back but you learn as you submit yourself to the word and you surrender your heart to God God can take that hurt and he can use that weakness to become a strength and show others that no matter in the face of adversity you're still standing and you're willing to forgive now many of you as I spoke last time you see me you know how I am I don't hide my emotions I wish I could they're there but I tell my wife I'm working through something because each of us when we're going through and we've been hurt and we've been offended we have to work through those things and it doesn't mean that that brother that sister that they're backslidden it doesn't mean that they're going to leave the church it doesn't mean that they're going to quit this doesn't mean those things it means they got a process through prayer and forgiveness to get through and get beyond the hurt and sometimes it takes a moment it's not something you just willfully do over in an instant in miraculously it's all over it's not I wish it was and I'm sure you wished it was as well because some of you are still holding on to some unforgiving things some hurt some wounds some scars that you hadn't got over yet so forgiveness is something that we just as Believers we have to do if we expect to be forgiven you have and it's a action it's not an emotion forgiving someone is not an emotion it's not something you recite in your mind it's a willful act I'm gonna let them off of this penalty that they've done to me I'm gonna not exact any any hurt or any ill ill willing or anything to them I'm going to release them of this debt now if you had the life that I had grow up the way I grew up there's a lot of resentment that you got to overcome and I realized as I was studying this Joe you got some things to do you had to forgive those that hurt you as you were growing up it wasn't intentional but it was there but if I'm going to move on if we're going to move on we have to willingly say I resolve that debt I absorb it I pardon it I'm letting you off tonight I'm not going to hold it and when Satan tries to bring it back up no that thing is dead I've let it go it has no more control over me I'm not going to lock myself into the prison of that doubt or that prison of that scar or the prison of that wound anymore I'm going to let that thing go I'm not going to let the Throne of emotions and the flood of memory rise up and take me down and hold me a prisoner because you can't hold on to that Grudge you can't hold on to that business you can't hold on to that Unforgiven and expect to make a rapture [Applause] you got to let go of it and I'm here to tell you it takes a fight to let go you can say willful action I release tonight the debt The Violator and Let It Go notice it's our Christian duty if we expect to be forgiven not just by your brother or sister but by almighty God then ye have to forgive those who violated you that's the scripture there's no other Avenue around it it's not up for debate it's not up for discussion that's the word and if you're here tonight professing to be Holy Ghost Field professing to believe God sent a prophet professing to believe this message then you must be willing tonight to say I lay it down I'm not going to carry that thing anymore you know what what what what unforgiveness is and wounds are it's like a weight that you carry around and the longer you hold it the heavier it gets and some of you have been packing that thing around since a kid you've been packing around packing around thinking it's going to get lighter thinking it's going to get better and it's weighing you down it's waiting your family down it's waiting your children down but God is telling you tonight lay it down you don't have to carry that thing anymore just forgive Let It Go absolve the debt pardon the Violator tonight see it's an act that you have to be willing and able to do not an emotion not a Feeling but see it can be very difficult especially when you've been hurt because when you've been hurt you back yourself in a corner you ever seen an animal that's been hurt he backs us if you back a wild animal that's been hurt in the corner he's going to come out fighting but that's the part that's got a bit laid down so you got to put that seed forgiveness is a powerful tool if it's held in the right hand of righteousness because you can let that brother off that hook you can let that sister off that hook and no longer let that hurt and let that pain torment your walk with God think about that no longer letting that thing that memory some of us if you're like me that thing you think about it when you lay down at night as soon as you wake up in the morning it's there to remind Satan is in your ear hold on to it don't let it go don't let them off you're just to be feeling like this they did you wrong they deserve punishment but see that's the devil's language God's language is love one another and see when you love one another then love will breed forgiveness and forgiveness will will breed a freedom to worship or Freedom so you can ex put your arm around that brother put your arm around say you know what I forgive you and a lot of times let me just say it like this you may not be able to go face to face and do it but if you don't do it here you won't make it there you got to be able to do it right here I'm not talking about mind over matter I'm talking about do it in your heart so this word pain here is a mental or emotional distress or sufferings and we're speaking on forgiveness finding forgiveness so what do you mean brother Joe by finding forgiveness I mean you got to search deep tonight within your own self-will and say God help me tonight to find that place where I can come and I can forgive no matter what the hurt is no matter what the pain is no matter what the suffering has been God help me tonight to find forgiveness and that will release me from the pain that I've been in oh you may make it through life but you're still holding the weight and all of a sudden that weight becomes the norm no that's not the norm you just adjusted to that weight but the norm is walking in Victory the norm is living a Godly life the enormous loving your brother putting your arms around them and letting no contingents come in the house of God that's the norm that's the church that God built so we want to look at a few things tonight by God's grace I want to look at unforgiveness I want to look at bitterness and I want to look at forgiveness so what is unforgiveness brother Joe unforgiveness is a state of emotional and mental distress that results from a delayed response in forgiving someone well I'll just I'll get around to it now this ain't something you get around to so the longer that you don't do it the longer that or the more that it breeds and it sets in this ain't something that oh I'll just okay if they come to me and say I'm sorry look forgiveness is not waiting on somebody to come to you say I'm sorry for what I've done it's a act that you must do knowing that you've been wrong by that person whether they know it or not and nine times out of 10 the person that wronged you don't even know that they wronged you you'd be around me long enough I probably said some hurt your feelings but I didn't do it intentionally right because we don't do it intentionally whether it's intentional or unintentional or willful the Bible says you got to forgive the transgression the trespasses so we find here unforgiveness is characterized by indignation bitterness a demand for punishment restitution see it creates a domino effect it causes our emotions and our thoughts and our body behaviors and our spirit and our relationships to be upside down see with unforgiveness time does not heal this wound it only grows and worsens because now every other little minute infraction only makes that scar worse it only adds to the intensity of the wound and though it's unintentional you start looking at things through the wrong set of eyes see in the absence notice what they say here that I've done a lot of research trying to get to this see they said unforgiveness is like carrying around a huge weight the longer we carry The Grudge that hurt that behavior only becomes worse the burden only becomes heavy see the roots of unforgiveness only go deeper further in entangling US and we're waiting on somebody to come and apologize but that's not the responsibility our responsibility is not to wait on them to come say I'm sorry I'm wrong our responsibility is says I forgive you that's your Christian responsibility whether they know you're hurt or not you have to find within yourself forgiveness in the midst of the pain well this one didn't speak to me and this one didn't do this and this one said this you know a lot of times we find that we may say things ingest but yet the person's not in the mood for your adjusting and they become offended by it and then they'll be saying same person but on a different day the mood's better and you can say the same thing and it doesn't bother them it's like water off our ducks back yeah so I'll just asking like won't you just guard your audience or or gauge your audience watch who you're speaking to and how you speak to them you know if they're if they're in a foul mood I think the time to go picking you know if they're fun and joking and cutting up maybe so but you know the thing about it every just comment has a lot of Truth mixed in with it and the devil can get on that shoulder and begin to whisper look at it this is what they think oh they said that they were joking but they really meant it it's got an ounce of truth to it it may have an ounce of Truth with it but still your responsibility is to say I forgive you I'm not going to hold this over you because I know you were joking I know Junior Wiley you love me or at least you better love me right so we find out this pain becomes the identity of a person who's not been able to forgive you ever been around somebody like that don't show your hand and don't go pointing fingers tonight you can around somebody that has not overcome yet they haven't forgiven or hurt our wound and you get around them in just a few minutes they're telling you every little detail of what happened so and so said this so-and-so did this they tell you when it happened how it happened where it happened in all the it's like a hunting story man they got that they got that wound on the wall it's a trophy they can tell you every bit of it where where I was standing in church brother Tim just walked right by me didn't say nothing just stuck his little nose up and just oh and then you got all offended trophy on the wall those are things we need to strip off our walls so I choose to not remember that I choose to forgive that I choose to pull that off my wall and put a trophy of worship a trophy of Praise a trophy of love a trophy that gives God glory not giving the devil some kind of Praise because I'm holding on to a grudge and I can recite every minute everything that was done every infraction that was done to me when you willing to let go and find forgiveness in the midst of your pain you will not be sticking up trophies of malice Strife unjustice things like that you'll pull those things down and you'll put your arm around your brother and you say hey we're gonna we're in this together I'll pull it for you I'm praying for you I'm on your side I know you're in a low point but I'm here to lift you up and to see you through this thing notice now somebody that's that's being identified by the pain they perceive every wrong encounter as a personal attack I know I'm not speaking nobody here tonight or I'm speaking to everybody because I'm speaking to myself because when you've been hurt and you've been wounded than every little thing begins to set you off then you try to reason it did they mean this did they mean that what did they really mean why did they say this why did they say that see it's not for us to figure those things out it's for us to forgive it's for us to let go of it so notice now unforgiveness comes to affect your judgment your perspective because you view the world and you view others and you begin to view yourself through the lens of your hurt through the lens of your hurt you know you get hurt nobody cares about me nobody's called me nobody's checked on me and we have nobody's done it because you're viewing it through the lens of your hurt but if you forgive and let go and let that thing have control over you because that's what it's doing it's got control over you and we can't allow the devil to have control even in the slightest in fractions so if I see the pain becomes the identity of the person that's not willing to forgive and all they can talk about is the pain when it happened where it happened how it happened see and you get around and you're not there just a few seconds and all of a sudden they're going through and it seems like that's all they can talk about and anybody that comes they're going to get the same story they have not let that thing go yet it's constant constant constant constant constant constant cost you know what you're what I'm talking about because you've been that one let's just be honest we have vintage you know what brother so and so said about me and you just tell everybody anybody that'll listen you tell them why because that's our human nature but our Christian responsibility is to let go of that see it affects our character our integrity see grudges grudges don't make you better they make you worse well I'm gonna hold on to you hold on to it you'll be in hell your choice because they're in the spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there's freedom from those things and the Bible says Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty whereas Christ had made you free he came and pardon you of your transgressions he let you off the hook of your transgressions you know there's a story about the unjust servant there and he came and he pleaded and he begged because he owed a thousand talents when it was and held a large sum of money and and the King there says you know what I'm going to take your wife I'm going to take your children I'm going to throw you into prison and he fell down and oh God our whole King don't do this to me oh just resolve my dead and just give me time I'll pay it and he owed 15 million dollars that's the son that's what it equated to 15 million dollars and yet as soon as the king resolves his death he went out jumping and skipping oh I'm a free man I don't have this debt any longer and he found a servant that owed him a measly fifteen dollars 15 that's what your infraction is to one another that hurt that word is a measly 15 bucks but your sin and your indignation and your ambiguity to God is 15 million bucks and God Almighty resolved your debt in your home fifteen dollars over your brother fifteen dollars over your sister and you're ready to throw them into the sinner's prison and tell them to lock them up and throw away the key and say you owe me this and yet they do but your responsibility is that I forgive you of it I'll lay it down I resolve this you don't owe me nothing no more 15 million to 15. and I'm looking at some of you tonight and you're holding 15 over somebody's head when you've been given forgiven 15 million no way you could pay it no way your family could pay it no way your family family families could pay it and you're struggling some of us are struggling to come to the house of God over some word some hurt some misdeed some misstep 15 when you have been forgiven 15 million you have been forgiven so much and if you expect to be forgiven then you must find forgiveness in the midst of your pain and it hurts and it's real I'm not saying that the person that wronged you that you just let them off the hook you can't forget it you're never gonna probably forget it but you for you can forgive it Nelson Mandela how many of you may know him he was thrown into prison many years ago for for uh some injustices that he didn't do but anyway he makes this comment hating someone is drinking poison and expecting the other person to die from it let me give you another quote that he said he no he was in prison he says I walked out of that door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom and I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind I still be in prison if I don't leave that behind me and let it go and let it left and you're the one that's in prison you're in prison to a wound that maybe you didn't cause her or whatever you was wrongfully done but that doesn't matter there's a way out tonight there's a key and it's a key of forgiveness tonight and in a locks the door and it will let you off tonight and you will let that person off and notice when you ever had done something for somebody man it just really makes you feel good when you really done something and you pay maybe you paid a large sum to help somebody out man it just feels good to be able to give think about when you for when you forgive you're taking the weight off of you and you're taking the weight off of them now you're no longer longer owe me you're no longer in debt to me I resolved that death I absolve it it's over then you can look at your brother you can look at your sister with the love of God not with bitterness not with hatred not with malice not with Strife not when you get in a room around them and all of a sudden beads are sweat get on your head because you're so wanting to get revenge hey I'm talking to you about the truth I've been there you've been there nod your head but your heart is saying yes brother Joe because it's the truth it's what we face but I'm telling you God laid this on my heart driving here just the other night said speak to him I didn't have a clue I didn't have an ally I had nothing but I had a thought finding forgiveness in the midst of pain nobody likes to be wronged especially by your brother church member Pastor preacher friend Deacon brother sister husband wife nobody likes to be hurt it's pain it's painful it's a scar but if that scar is picked and that scar is just constantly oh I just remember this and I remember this you never put the bomb of of Gilead on that scar to heal that wound but I'm here to tell you there's a bomb tonight there's a holy ghost tonight and the Holy Ghost breeds love and love breeds forgiveness and forgiveness heals the wound of hurts in your life hurts and scars down through our life that maybe we didn't know and maybe we suppressed them for so long but yet they're still there unhealed but there's an antibody tonight that you can take tonight there's a toxin that you can take it'll heal that broken wound it'll heal that thing and allow you to move on with God it would allow you to for some of us wonder why can't I get anywhere are you holding on to something or you got something hanging over somebody some fifteen dollars notice unforgiveness is like cancer it spreads it cannot be contained it has to be wiped out you keep a spirit of unforgiveness your friends will walk away from you because they get sick and tired of hearing about the negativity that's been done to you you have to learn to let it go it makes unforgiveness makes you a very irritable person you just love to be around somebody like that y'all took bets on me hey it's the truth but you know what I recognize because we all have to work through things you got to work through your hurt but if you don't work through your hurt that thing's gonna Fester and then one day it's gonna pop and when it pops it's a nasty mess it gets on you it gets on those beside you it gets on those here it gets on those there we're not hooked there's a bomb in Gilead we don't need sores to Fester when we get a healing agent here tonight forgive it Let It Go walk away from it so unforgiveness breeds bitterness and Hebrews 3 verse 12 says take heed brother lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin in Hebrews 12 verse 14 follow peace with all men oh my follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fell of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled so this word bitterness is an extreme wickedness you think I can be just a little bit bitter you ever drank bitter coffee it's nasty right you spit it out same way with bitterness it's nasty spit it out it's extreme wickedness and it's in the heart and it's because you haven't chose to forgive and move on you've chose to let it fester and unforgiveness breeds bitterness and we find here see when we've been hurt it's easy to get bitter and when you get bitter it's hard to forgive yes see it's a direct correlation see it makes you caustic it makes you sarcastic it makes you condemning and it makes you a very nasty person nobody wants to be around your bitterness but we're all guilty but I'm giving you a solution tonight find forgiveness in the midst of your hurt in the midst of your pain see bitterness is harassed by memories my mama Satan's right there on your shoulder bringing this to your memory bringing this one up bringing this one well I did what did Brother Joe say I mean did did he mean was he pointing at me because I know I saw him point but you know I could have swore he pointed right at me it's harassed by memories memories because you're not willing to forgive because if you forgive it and you let it go it rises up and it falls off because you're not holding that person in prison to it you've let them go so bitters is a root that grows deep in the soul of our hearts that if you let time tear it gets deeper and deeper and deeper but it must be rooted out now I'm a stump grinder but even in stump grinding you leave part of that in the ground but what I'm talking about tonight is you gotta uproot every trace of that thing and not let it fester in your life just can't come over the times oh I had a good meeting I felt the Holy Ghost and I got goosebumps and you know it's okay and we got it below the surface and yet there's still a little bit there it's going to be completely absolved pardoned let go of completely take that root out of the ground the entire root ball in the root system and take it out and throw it away and I'm here to tell you if we can do that in the natural he can do that in a supernatural but you got to be willing people come and they say hey Mr Adams you do stump grinding right they call me they're looking for me I'm like I'm your man come around I got you I got a big machine we can take care of that but I'm here to tell you you got to be looking for him find him he's the one that can take those things out of your heart completely resolve it completely eradicated completely do away with it but it's going to cost you it's going to cost you some pride because you got to be willing to recognize I need this I need this for me I need this for my family I need this for my marriage I need this for my kids my kids deserve to see a father my kids deserve to see a mother that's in tune with the word and not in the mully grubs and complaining about this one and that one this one Roman that one Roman nobody cares and all this let all that go God is calling for sons and God is calling for daughters of God he's calling for men to be Gallant men Gallant women Christians of the Cross he's called for men to be like David who God say he's a man after my own heart that's what we're called to be but the devil's got us fighting one another and don't go away from here tonight and say brother Joe was picking on me and I'm not picking on you I'm picking on me tonight I'm telling you we are in this together and we got to be willing to do a self-assessment and say God I've been Rome but through the preaching of the word through the foolishness of preaching you chose to anoint brother Joe and put a thought on his heart and I've been having this thing lay there and lay there and lay there but through the preaching and the anointing of the spirit he comes and it destroys the Yoke that's been on my life that's been on my family that's been come down through family strength but yet there's an agent here tonight there's a healing here tonight there's somebody that can come and expose that thing and tonight I recognize I need to forgive I need to move on if I'm going to be forgiven and receive a body change Ephesians 4 verse 29 the Bible says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good oh you mean I can't talk about my brother nope notice this word corrupt is rotten putrified let no corrupt communication or putrify communication or writing communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good but I don't want to say anything to it then shut up keep your mouth shut stay home do everybody a favor but quit getting in people's ear and complaining about what this one does and that one done and that one done I got a quote for you just in a minute don't worry see let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to use of edifying building up that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers your unforgiveness does not administer Grace it doesn't Elevate anybody it doesn't make somebody feel warm and fuzzy they don't get goosebumps they're not going around shouting and dancing because you're negative and you're complaining about being hurt and unloading your wound on them again and that nasty sword and pop and it's getting all over everybody around you look I'm guilty I've been guilty I asked my friends they'll tell you there's been times they look I didn't want them at the house Aaron David y'all keep your eyes shut they're probably not yeah we took bets on you buddy but it's the truth we all must be willing to come face to face with it and we all must be willing to be honest with ourselves It's Time to Let It Go it's time to find forgiveness brother Tim in the midst of our pain it's not easy to say I was wrong it's because you want to hold on to it you want to get vengeance the Bible says vengeance is mine saith the Lord he didn't say Vengeance of my saved job to all my I'm a man of God I'm gonna get Vengeance no God doesn't operate that way God says this is when you know that you're my disciples when you strike Vengeance to one another no when you have love love let me keep going and grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you've been sealed to the day of your Redemption let all bitterness you mean I can't keep none of it none of it kind of let all bitterness extreme wickedness that all extreme wickedness and wrath and anger and clamor and excuse me evil speaking be put away from you with all malice for Man this ain't no fun no this is what it means to be a Christian this is what it means to be an overcomer I'm talking to you about being staying out of that prison you walked out two weeks ago stay out how do you stay out forgive and love two powerful weapons in a person a believer's Arsenal is love and forgiveness because when you can look at your brother and still love them and forgive them that means you're a real son of God you're displaying Christ because he looked at you and said I forgive you and I love you notice and the Bible says in Ephesians 4 and verse 32 now this is gonna This is Gonna Get You if I know you're just going to get you come on oh you mean I mean I gotta be kind yes you do that means you ain't got to invite him over told them a big party but you got to be kind he don't give in a solid treatment at church let me walk around stick your nose up like you don't know me wrong me I don't know who you are no be kind one to another tender hearted forget oh there's that word again forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you wow maybe not the kind of service you thought tonight when we're sending our young people off but I promise you you take this to Heart tonight you're gonna go a lot of places and one place you're gonna go Satan can't get there and that's the body change that's the rapture because you're not taking your malice you're not taking your Grievous you're not taking your contentions you're not taking none of those things you're not taking up they're not going but what you will take is love and you will take forgiveness and you will take the spirit of Christ you'll take out in a body change but everything else it's going to be left behind because he ain't coming for that he's coming for those that match his character and he so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he forgave you a 15 million dollars that's a whole lot of debt and all he's asking for you is to say let go of that five fat 15 bucks I got you I'll take care of that down the road see when you give forgiveness what you're doing is you're putting their judgment of that wrongdoer in God's hands and not yours see it's up to God then to deal with that person and let me say God will deal with that person got to move on their heart there's been some of you here tonight that I've offended in my time of being here thinking about me and I thank God for it is I'm quick to repent and I'm not too prideful that I can't come and say you know what I'm sorry that I've offended sorry that you know that didn't come out quite like I meant it to come out anybody ever been there you say something like oh I wish I didn't say it like that and you're like oh well that's us that's human nature but you got to be quick to say I'm sorry don't be so prideful and so boastful and thinking well you know if I say I'm if I forgive them then it's weak it's not weak that's strength to recognize to The Real Son of God can say I'm sorry I'm wrong I didn't mean to do that I don't want to be the the hindrance of another brother another sister from moving on with God I don't want to be as far of them getting up and walking out and I'm not talking about walking out mentally walking out spiritually I'm talking to them walking out physically and saying I will not be back through those doors because of the people and the attitudes that even like Tabernacle but see when when we're wounded everything is heightened you ever been ever had a surgery you've ever been cut home when you when you walk out of that hospital room you're not magically healed it's a process it takes time brother Tim you take medicine you take care of the wound you make sure there's nothing in there to get it dirty get it contaminated you keep Galls over you keep it wrapped what you got to do with your world you got to keep it wrapped you don't go around showing everybody now there I'll throw up don't be showing me your nasty scar I don't want to see it I got a weak stomach some of us got weak stomach spiritually and you can buy your going around showing everybody your scar you hurt people and you especially hurt those that weak and then they week and then all of a sudden the weak ones begin to oh well if that's how they're going to be then I just won't come back and I'll just stay away and I'll just do this because they can't handle it because you know honestly if you've got a sore I don't want to look at it the doctor is at the hospital when I worked at the hospital Dr uh what's the doctor's name Indian Dr Mallory he'd show me some pictures I'm like you can't be showing me that stuff he's inside the body and he's got pictures of Scopes I'm like that's nasty man he said look at this I'm like I'm about to throw up and that's how it is with some of us we don't I'm a weak person when it comes to that I don't want to see it I'm not going to the operating room and said oh here I am let me show me the dirty and no shall we come to the house of God expecting to be shown the dirty we don't need to be seen and seeing the hinder parts of our brothers and sisters let's look at the good look at the positive look at their strengths look they're sitting here tonight because God had moved on them you're not perfect so don't expect them to be perfect they forgive you forgive let's move on brother Brown says this he says get all these little differences away from you this is your Prophet little isms little funny feelings around you for your brethren and things like that shake it away don't let no root of bitters ever get into your soul if you do it will conquer you keep love I don't care how much people hate you you love them anyway that's tough brother Joe that's tough but notice here in Galatians 5 as we try to hurry up here Galatians 5 says for Brethren 5 13 excuse me for brother you have been called unto Liberty only used not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another by love serve one another then say talk about them then say remind them of the infraction but love them and serve them for all the laws fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another let's go down to verse 17 or verse 16 let's just go there keep reading and I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the lust for the flesh lost us against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to another so that ye cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh let's let's clue in here the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanliness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred so the word hatred there is Discord and Feud variance that word is contention debate Strife variance emulations Fierce ignition punitive zeal the word wrath is Passion angry heat anger forthcoming boiling up and in soon siding only to ball back up again the word strife is selfish ambition Disobedience Feud sedations divisions dissensions heresies dissensions arising from diversity of opinions envying which is ill will murders drunkenness reveling of the sorts of which I tell you before as I have told you in the past that they that which do these things shall not inherit the kingdom of God tells me like Paul was dealing with some people in the church that didn't know how to forgive to people that were letting things fester and they were full of Vengeance they were full of animosity they were full of hatred and strife and all these things and Paul is saying if you have that you're not going these things are not allowed in the kingdom of God see you can't take those things with you they're not going but you can take love now let's look here and turn our attention just for a few minutes to forgiveness so what is forgiveness brother Joe it means that the pain that once traumatized you it no longer traumatizes you the pain that once traumatized you from the wound from the infraction from the hurt it now no longer traumatized it has no control no jurisdiction over your well-being it's it's done just if your sins have been forgiven and are in the sea of God's forgiveness though you can't forget because we're human we remember everything but what it does is you now you've taken the power out of the scar you're taking the inflammation out of it and now it's no longer a scam it's healed and it's only a scar to remind you that you overcame that you passed a test they didn't get the best of you see forgiveness is the key out of that emotional and mental prison when you choose to forgive you choose to untie yourself from the shackles that connected you with the person who wronged you you choose to untie yourself you aren't waiting for them brother Tony to come and untie you and take the key and take the shackles off of you no you got the key and it's a key of forgiveness and you can unlock the shackles tonight and say I'm done with it you essentially say I'm I'm walking out a second time so we look here and we find the decision though has to be on your part it's a real faction Vanessa Mandela tells us this and I hope you don't mind some quotes I just like bringing some of these current event kind of quotes he said reconciliation does not mean forgetting or trying to bury the pain of the conflict but that reconciliation means working together to correct the legacy of the past and justice see if we're not willing to work together and we run off and we run and we say well I'm just going to pick my toys up and I'm going home we're not working through anything there's no reconciliation there but when we can have a heart of forgiveness forgiveness will breed reconciliation and in tune reconciliation brings restoration and to restore a brother to restore a sister that should be our ambition that should be our goal that should be our desire right see the Bible tells us in Ephesians 4 32 be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another so it involves an intentional decision to let go of the resentment oh my God intentional you mean I gotta let go yes you got to let God see it can help free you from the person that's harmed you Corey ten Boone how many of you are familiar with Corey ten Boone coreyton Boone she has a quote here on forgiveness and I I love it it says forgiveness is the key that locks the door to of resentment and the handcuffs of hatred it is a power that breaks the chains of bitterness in the shackles of selfishness so otherwise unforgiveness is selfishness I'm gonna hold this because it makes you feel like you got something over somebody else and she also says forgiveness is the greatest gift that you can give yourself the greatest gift that you can give yourself is to give yourself forgiveness forgiven that person that's wrong to you now she was in a a concentration camp she was in ravensburg concentration camp and after the World War II was over and uh the camp was liberated and she became a speaker and went around the world and traveled she was in a church in Munich and she was there preaching on forgiveness sins being forgiven and the Sea of God's forgiveness no longer to be remembered anymore and yet when she's there and she dismisses and the service is over stands up a man-balding man and she says all of a sudden all the emotion of the past it was the guard of the Ravens Brook camp now she says it like this it came back with a rush huge room with the horse overhead lights pathetic pile of dresses and shoes in the center of the floor the shame of walking naked past this man I could see my sister's frail form ahead of me ribs sharp beneath the parchment skin Betsy oh how thin you are Betsy and I she said they were they were held because they they were protecting Jews and he come up to her and he said what a fine message crawling how good is this to know that our sins are at the bottom of the sea so she went on and on and on about forgiveness but she has yet to forgive this man in the Nazi regime for what they did to the Jewish people and to what they did to her and her family she lost her dad her brother and her sister in the concentration camp she had a right to hold on to it humanly speaking but she had to find forgiveness in the midst of her pain and she said this man came up to her and he said since the war is over I became a Christian and I wanted to come to you and say I'm going to come and ask you to forgive me for my Injustice for my wrong and she said she fumbled around in her purse because she didn't want to forgive just like us it's hard you fumble around with it but you know if you're going to be forgiven then you must forgive let me just tell it in her words she says I stood there with a coldness clutching my heart but forgiveness is not an emotion I knew that too serious forgiveness is an act of Will and the will can function regardless of the temperature of the heart how beautifully road is that she said Jesus help me I pray silently and I can lift my hand and I can do that much but you supply the feelings she said and wouldn't leave mechanically I thrust my hand into into his stressed out one and as I did an incredible thing took place a current started in my shoulder rates down my arms sprang into the joints hands and then this healing warmth seemed to flood my whole being bringing tears to my eyes I forgive you brother I cried with all my she said for a long moment we grasp each other's hands a former guard and a former prisoner I had never known God's love so intensely as I did then you know we've seen churches in the South that have a bell in the tower right and there's a rope you take that rope and you just pull that rope in that building ding dong ding dong and that's exactly what it is to hold to a grudge as long as you're holding to it you're just yanking the chain and it's dinging it's reminding you of everything that they've done to you but if you let go of that rope tonight eventually that Bell is going to stop swinging it's that Bell is going to stop dinging that Bell is going to stop donging and that Bell is going to become quiet and that bail is going to become Motionless so I'm asking you tonight you have to find forgiveness you have to let go of the Rope you have to let the bail stop ringing in your life it's time to take your hands off the Rope I say God I want to find tonight within my heart of hearts forgiveness in the midst of my pain she went through a lot of pain lost all those that were dear to her over some Wicked regime she went through a lot of hardships and solitary confinement she was beat she was doing a very a strong Injustice and she could have let that dictate her life but she was she chose to forgive and when she chose to forgive she felt the love of God like she never felt before and I'm telling us tonight that if we choose to forgive you will you will feel the love of God like you've never felt before because not only do you do yourself a favor you're releasing somebody from a debt that they can't pay let me end with this resistance if you would you make your way back program tells us in the message the program churches he says now try to do something good and just keep he says just keep being good Oh No Malice no grudges don't let any bitterness no matter how bad the person is and how bad they talk about you don't you never think evil in your heart against them oh man are you sure take the fun out of holding The Grudge for look think about it never let it in your heart against him call because right there the devil was set right in their work upon something right there just keep it all covered up with Godly love confession and making right and do good to those that do evil to you he says we're not the judge God is a judge and you don't want to you don't want that poor fella to be Cast Away would you certainly not no matter who they are you wouldn't want that so try to be kind to them so to say that we forgive is not saying that the consequences of their behavior is not just or that that you forgive them or you forget it that they were that they're not wrong for not doing it but what you're saying is I'm forgiving you and I'm turning now it over to God now the judgment is not my judgment it's God's judgment and you're wrong in me is between you and God not me and you anymore and you can choose to let that person off of that brother Brown says endure to the door if you just play something soft to solar hands we bring this to a close he says you know what a blessing is how many knows what a blessing is he goes do something good for somebody well man we're gonna walk out of here and everybody's gonna be blessed that's right if you have a neighbor or somebody that's done you an injustice remember this for me don't you never turn him down take him to God in prayer and see what a different attitude you'll have if you're sincere in your prayer and you stand shoulder to shoulder with him and and though he's done you wrong in Injustice but just he said just take that man to God and stand there in the presence of the father one time and say father my neighbor let me put it like this my brother my sister here has done me wrong he says watch when you go to telling his wrong it's not only help him but it'll help you also you'll see what he's been through in the Temptations and things it'll change your attitude toward that brother it'll help him also and you're always doing good when you're praying one for another but see Satan wants you to embrace the hurt to not let go of it I want you to embrace the whole Colossians 3 said put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of Mercies [Music] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness long-suffering forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a curl against any even as Christ forgave you also do you [Music] so let no root of bitterness come up if you have a choice tonight there's a lot of things people can take from you but tonight they cannot take your your choice to trust God in the midst of your pain and they cannot take your choice to let go of the infraction that's on you tonight that's on us tonight and brother Brown says now he keep us separated shooting one another goddess let me end with this he goes if I found Grace in your sight through God and you take my word for this brother how many believe him be a prophet come on there's got to be more hands than that you believe him to be a prophet tonight he says if I found Grace in your sight this is a Great Commission you take my word for this brother if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he's absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil he said don't mention that don't mention it [Music] don't mention it so what do you mean brother that means he's saying don't go tell everybody about the hurt [Music] don't go tell everybody about the womb don't mention it but it said take that brother in prayer lift that brother up in prayer he says you take him the prayer before God and don't take it in the way of just a selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but you stand there shoulder to shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father and we pray and a prayer should be made in the presence of God father here's my brother he is justly he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see why he's done this but he says then you let God go to talking to you you let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get big get back down to Earth again you'll go over the end and you'll and you'll Shake That brother's hand because you know what he's been through you can't stand with the mortal and the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe it no sir even if he's a ranked sinner for none of you tonight will ranked sinners and if you've been wronged and that person justly has hurt you say tonight you take them to God In Prayer if you got a choice to make [Music] you got a choice maybe you're stuck in unforgiveness but you don't have to stay there tonight maybe you're holding on to something hoping wishing praying that someday they're going to come they'll make this right but that's not your responsibility your responsibility says I'm Letting Go I'm Letting Go why don't you just bow your heads for a minute as we close [Music] as we bring this service to a close tonight I want to teach of you tonight to Search Your Heart to where you've been wrong maybe it was maybe it was brother Joe that hurts you but I can promise you I didn't do it intentionally I didn't do it because I don't love you I did it because I'm human and I'm not perfect it's not because brother Tim doesn't love your brother Timothy or brother Aaron or heaven forbid your mom and dad or your best friend because we're human we're not perfect we're going to foul things up but I want you to find that person that's that you haven't relinquished from that debt tonight [Music] and I want you to say God [Music] they hurt me they were my best friend they were the preacher they were this one that one whatever but tonight Lord I want to find forgiveness in the midst of my pain God help me tonight to let go of this I know it's an action that I got to be willing freely to let go of but I need you like Corey ten Boone needed you to help her extend the hand to that guard who beat her who watched her sister die [Music] God help me tonight got my hand is up tonight help me to have a heart that'll forgive when maybe comments are made snide comments Lord help me to have that attitude I don't want to hold this over my brother hold this over my sister if that's you tonight just lift your hand up to God say God sincerely I'm Letting Go with this thing I'm letting go of this hurt there's a balm in Gilead that's here tonight to heal that wound God sees your hands can I seize your hands tonight but more importantly God knows your heart if you really mean that tonight whether you lifted your hand up or not it's on you you go from this service tonight you will be held responsible for what you do with Jesus called Christ because he came tonight in a personal way to tell you it's time to forgive it's time to let go it's time to quit talking about it it's time to quit rehashing the incident in the scar and let's move on we're a family of God father tonight you see the needs and you see this thought that you laid on My Heart Lord and Lord I even searched my heart as I begin to study this and recognize whatever things that I was holding on to maybe comments that were said down through the years Lord the way I was treated this one and that one Lord I know those things were regardless if they were as unintentional or if they were a willful act you said we must forgive our trespasses or those that trespass against us if we expect to be forgiven so Lord tonight I ask that you would help even like Tabernacle men and women boys and girls young and old tonight Lord even those that on the Stream Lord help us to find forgiveness in the midst of this pain Lord let the pain go and the hurts of sidelord and maybe just move on and be able to look at our brother and I with love put our arms around him and said I know where you've been I know you didn't mean to do that so father I ask tonight that there be a healing agent here Lord you had comfort those hearts tonight Lord I know this may be a sobering type of message but father I pray that it was very direct and very intentional that it was exactly what was needed for the body I ask that you move Lord tonight in a special way and fathers our young people leave tonight and go off on the trip Lord no doubt there may be some infractions that take place on the bus maybe on the way home or maybe there's been things take place at other camps and things that were said this young person against that when Lord Satan trying to get in and cause division God made we even as a young person tonight forgive so that we can be forgiven Lord we love you tonight and we just ask God that he would help us to be more like you bring us into your image Lord give us your heart a Heart of Love therefore may all men know that we're your disciples we ask it in Jesus name tonight God bless you 've made it down [Music] like he cleanse my soul and set me free I'm glad that Jesus [Music] Christ Jesus foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] Christ Jesus [Music] one day one day one day he's coming back for me to live [Music] on the glory [Music] oh I look forward to that day foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] before [Music] race all of your sin thank you Lord [Music] brand new song [Music] hey has forgive on me my sins have been washed by the blood of the land [Music] why don't we stand together tonight oh just join your voices now oh please foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you boss from oh God [Music] [Music] praise the Lord amen aren't you glad for forgiveness amen we want forgiveness for ourselves and to do that we must forgive man was a great message tonight and you know many times there's a lot of wrongs along life's journey and friends will wrong us parents will wrong us children we're wrong to parents and wives and husband will wrong each other and you know you can't just keep a whole list of debts you have to let it go and you know you otherwise you just keep going around and around the same old Merry-Go-Round and you know it's never settled and every time you know these things just keep resurfacing and keep tormenting and troubling and and as I was thinking there's brother Joe's Minister and you know there was really no forgiveness in the uh in the Old Testament it was eye for an eye tooth for tooth you know uh payback revenge for you know get back at one of another you know whatever judgment you got you made it back the same and and but in the New Testament Jesus brought us under a whole new covenant and under that New Covenant there is one of love and forgiveness and mercy I'm glad for Mercy aren't you amen and I I thank God for that and we
