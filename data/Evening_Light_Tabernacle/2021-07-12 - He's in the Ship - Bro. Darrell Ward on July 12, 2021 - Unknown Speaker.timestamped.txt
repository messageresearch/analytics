[19:28] seem what the doctor's report is and
[19:32] what
[19:32] medical science may say but lord we are
[19:36] here today to step
[19:37] off the tree of good and evil the
[19:39] knowledge of good and evil and step onto
[19:41] the tree of life
[19:43] because lord on the tree of the

[19:46] limitations there's only so much they
[19:48] can do
[19:49] yes we're thankful for what doctors can

[19:59] try to help people in every way they can
[20:01] help
[20:02] but lord there's times they are limited
[20:04] there's times they cannot do any more
[20:06] and in those moments we step off of that
[20:09] and we step onto the tree of life

[20:50] him and his weakness

[20:58] word of god is against you
[21:01] and you take your hands off of god's
[21:03] property
[21:04] and let the power of god be released to

[21:40] word of god that can go forth and bring
[21:42] your word to pass
[21:44] and satan you've come against you've
[21:46] been re-released yourself time and time
[21:49] again
[21:50] all hell is flooded into this dimension
[21:53] but when all hell turns loose all heaven

[44:19] and the same day when the eve was come
[44:21] he said unto them
[44:23] let us pass over unto the other side
[44:28] and when they had sent away the
[44:29] multitude they took him
[44:31] even as he was in the ship and they were
[44:33] also with him
[44:35] other little ships
[44:38] and there arose a great storm of wind
[44:41] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[44:43] it was now
[44:44] full and he was in the hinder part of
[44:47] the ship asleep on the pillar
[44:49] and they awake him and said unto him
[44:51] master
[44:52] carest thou not that we perish
[44:56] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[44:59] said unto the sea

[48:08] these things into your hands for your
[48:09] glory
[48:10] for we ask it in jesus name and the
[48:12] bride says
[48:14] god bless you saints you may be seated
[48:15] this morning i'd like to call your
[48:17] attention back to verse 40 where the
[48:20] bible says this
[48:21] and he said unto them why are ye so
[48:23] fearful
[48:24] and how is it that you have no
[48:27] faith and i was just thinking about this
[48:29] scripture it reminded me of something
[48:31] that the prophet of god
[48:32] said when he was speaking on fear and
[48:35] faith
[48:36] and the prophet said he said now i
[48:37] thought tonight that i would talk on
[48:39] faith for a little while
[48:41] and just build up on christian faith for
[48:43] i find out that one of the greatest
[48:45] hindrances of the church has got today
[48:48] is that they're scared to death and he
[48:50] said what are you scared about that's
[48:52] what i'm wondering
[48:54] if you're only if you're if you'll just
[48:57] only realize who you are
[49:01] if you'll just only realize who you are
[49:04] you don't know who you are you don't
[49:06] know who that is
[49:07] that's sitting next to you you say oh
[49:10] that's my neighbor i know him all right
[49:12] but he's a son of god see that's right
[49:14] adopted by jesus christ into the family
[49:16] and that's a daughter of god sitting
[49:18] next to you
[49:19] and who are you if you're a christian
[49:22] if you're a believer then you're a son
[49:24] and daughter of god then what are you
[49:26] scared about
[49:27] there's no need of being scared
[49:30] so as long as the devil can keep you
[49:32] scared
[49:33] that's all he wants to do he's got you
[49:37] right then as long as he can keep you
[49:40] scared
[49:41] that's all he wants to do so then we
[49:44] realize we haven't come to this
[49:45] understanding
[49:46] that amnesia of not knowing
[49:50] who you are feeds fear
[49:54] as long as the devil can keep you
[49:56] confused
[49:58] as long as the devil one day you think
[49:59] you're brian and the next day you're not
[50:01] sure
[50:02] as long as he can keep you confused that
[50:04] you don't know who you are
[50:05] he's got you exactly where he wants you
[50:09] amen but you see so when we understand
[50:11] that amnesia
[50:12] feeds fear but realizing who you
[50:16] are produces faith for brother brethren
[50:20] said
[50:20] jesus had perfect faith because he knew
[50:23] who he was
[50:24] in the word and the word of god will
[50:27] never
[50:28] fail you emotional fail and sensational
[50:32] fail
[50:32] but the word of god will never fail you
[50:35] amen
[50:36] perfect love cast out all fear and love
[50:39] and faith is the same thing the prophet
[50:41] said
[50:41] love perfect love cast out all fear
[50:44] which gives faith
[50:45] then you say what are you saying i'm
[50:46] saying this let us come this morning
[50:48] with this revelation of who we are
[50:52] we are not a cult we are not a
[50:55] denomination
[50:56] we are not an organization we are his
[50:59] body on the earth amen
[51:02] we are the body of jesus christ on the
[51:05] earth today
[51:06] if we can ever come to that realization
[51:08] that he's just
[51:09] changed his mask
[51:14] you know we've been wearing these masks
[51:15] and i was in a store the other day
[51:17] and the the guy that came in he must
[51:19] have been a local
[51:21] and i was standing there and he walked
[51:22] in with this mask on and the
[51:24] the lady behind the cash register she
[51:25] said what john
[51:27] you've changed your mask
[51:31] when she said that i'm not shouting past
[51:33] dictatorships
[51:35] because don't you see my brother my
[51:36] sister that's all he's done in this hour
[51:39] the god that was in jesus he's just
[51:41] changed his mass gay man
[51:43] that same god is now in the hearts of
[51:45] his people
[51:46] fulfilling this ministry for this day
[51:49] amen let us come with this revelation
[51:51] of who we are and let our faith in who
[51:54] we are in him
[51:55] cast out all fear amen oh hallelujah
[51:59] that we open our scripture we find that
[52:01] jesus is telling his disciples
[52:04] to get into the boat and let us pass
[52:07] over
[52:08] to the other side so where you think
[52:10] they're going
[52:12] they're going to the other side you know
[52:14] why because he said so
[52:17] amen now the reason they're making this
[52:20] journey
[52:21] across this water is because that on the
[52:24] other side of the lake or the sea
[52:26] is the gallerians
[52:29] on the other side is gadara and there is
[52:32] a man who's living among the tombs
[52:35] we know him as the maniac of gadara
[52:38] and he was crying out for help
[52:42] he was voting deliverance so
[52:45] jesus got into the ship and he crossed
[52:47] the stormy sea that night
[52:49] for the call of one needy soul
[52:53] [Applause]
[52:54] notice it wasn't the mayor that called
[52:56] him it wasn't the president of the
[52:58] country that called him
[52:59] it was a maniac
[53:04] oh hallelujah let me tell you god will
[53:07] appear
[53:07] before any honest heart no matter how
[53:10] insignificant it may seem to be
[53:14] my he got into the ship and he crossed
[53:16] the stormy sea
[53:17] for the sake of one needy soul orphanage
[53:21] don't you say well brother now
[53:22] if we had 600 here we could call him on
[53:24] the sea if we had a thousand year we
[53:26] could call him on the scene but i'm here
[53:27] to tell you we don't need 500
[53:29] we don't need 50 we don't need 12. we
[53:32] just need one sincere heart
[53:34] [Applause]
[53:37] somebody that'll look beyond the storm
[53:39] somebody that'll look beyond the waves
[53:40] and call him on the scene amen
[53:43] [Applause]
[53:44] jesus crossed the sea all the way over
[53:48] into gadara
[53:49] to give mercy to one
[53:53] man thank you buddy oh god
[53:57] let that be me this morning
[54:01] no one else would be me lord
[54:04] he's the same jesus tonight he'll come
[54:07] from glory
[54:08] for one needy soul setting in a humble
[54:12] church this morning
[54:13] the same one he'll every time come
[54:16] to where he's wanted but he never comes
[54:20] to where he's doubted
[54:25] you so you believe god heals oh yeah
[54:26] everybody yeah we believe god heals you
[54:28] believe god will heal you
[54:31] it's a big difference but you see when
[54:33] you fix that little bit of doubt it
[54:35] makes it a hybrid faith
[54:37] and hybrid faith produces nothing
[54:41] amen don't doubt just believe he'll
[54:45] never show up
[54:46] to where there's doubt but he will come
[54:49] to where someone wants him to come the
[54:52] matter of fact the prophet said he wants
[54:53] to come to you
[54:55] he'll send a man to preach the gospel
[54:56] he'll send a man to sing a song
[54:58] to create an atmosphere because he's
[55:00] wanting to come to you
[55:04] amen he'll come this morning to every
[55:07] brother and says he'll come every time
[55:09] he's wanted but he never comes to where
[55:11] he's doubting
[55:12] then i say let's lay aside every doubt
[55:14] lay aside every fear
[55:15] and believing there's nothing oh my
[55:18] there's nothing that's able to stop
[55:20] him from coming when you call upon him
[55:24] there is nothing that'll stop him from
[55:26] coming to you
[55:27] the wind couldn't stop him the waves
[55:29] couldn't stop him the storm couldn't
[55:31] stop him
[55:32] the sea couldn't stop him the devils
[55:34] could not stop him from coming to
[55:36] abraham
[55:37] there is nothing that can stop him from
[55:40] coming to you
[55:42] when you call on him amen
[55:45] you see my brother my sister it wasn't
[55:48] the man's voice
[55:51] that got jesus attention he was on the
[55:53] other side of the lake
[55:54] he never heard his voice
[55:58] it's not how loud we scream it's not our
[56:01] that's not what gets his attention what
[56:04] gets god's attention
[56:05] faith
[56:10] amen amen your faith
[56:13] can stop him it wasn't the man's voice
[56:16] that caught brought jesus across the sea
[56:18] it was his faith
[56:21] like the little boy that was in the
[56:22] shopping mall they said brother branham
[56:25] i'm lost
[56:26] as lost can be i'm like a coin and a
[56:29] sand pile lost
[56:31] but the prophet said you don't have to
[56:33] stay that way son
[56:35] there is someone standing present now
[56:38] who can find you the minute you want to
[56:41] be
[56:42] found
[56:46] and the little boy said i'm ready are
[56:48] you ready this morning
[56:51] oh hallelujah don't doubt him just
[56:54] believe him this morning
[56:56] if you're doubting him just remember
[56:57] he'll never be at your door
[56:59] but if you love him and you want him
[57:01] he'll come to you
[57:02] any time you call for him he's ready to
[57:05] come
[57:06] verse one standing present this morning
[57:08] who can find you the moment you want to
[57:09] be found
[57:10] i don't care where you're living i don't
[57:12] care what you've done come on somebody i
[57:14] don't care what sickness you're facing
[57:15] i don't care what the doctor said
[57:17] there's someone right now who can find
[57:18] you
[57:19] the minute you want to be found you just
[57:21] have to call on his name
[57:22] when we call on the name of jesus amen
[57:27] with someone standing president who can
[57:28] heal you the moment you want to be
[57:30] healed who can deliver you
[57:32] the moment you want to be delivered
[57:35] someday some happy day i say today not
[57:38] sunday
[57:39] don't put it off to tomorrow he's an
[57:41] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[57:45] amen so the fine this meeting is coming
[57:48] to a close
[57:49] and he tells his disciples let's get
[57:52] into the boat
[57:54] let's go to the other side you see he's
[57:57] feeling the pull
[57:58] of the maniac's need so he gets into the
[58:01] ship
[58:02] and jesus is with them and they begin to
[58:05] cross over
[58:06] the seed now jesus being the word
[58:11] he knew all things
[58:15] so he knew the maniac was on the other
[58:17] side
[58:18] he knew he would deal with that in the
[58:20] morning he
[58:22] knew the storm was coming he knew
[58:25] the devils would try to drown them he
[58:27] knew the pig farmers would reject him
[58:30] and ask him to leave
[58:31] he knew all of that he
[58:34] already knew that but he never looked at
[58:38] the barriers
[58:40] he looked at the victory
[58:45] hallelujah you know what a horse race
[58:49] when they line them up there at the gate
[58:50] you know they back the horses in and
[58:51] they put that gate across them you know
[58:53] what they call that gate
[58:54] they call it the barrier
[58:57] but the barrier is only the evidence
[59:00] that there's a victory line just ahead
[59:03] don't you see my brother my sister when
[59:05] the devil tries to hinder you when he
[59:07] tries to hold you back
[59:08] that's the evidence god's got something
[59:10] for you amen
[59:12] don't see the barrier see the victory
[59:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[59:22] he spoke let us pass over to the other
[59:25] side
[59:26] and that was his word and the bible says
[59:29] his word will not return
[59:31] unto him void but it will accomplish
[59:34] that
[59:34] which it was set to do he knew the waves
[59:38] were coming
[59:39] he knew the storm was brewing he knew
[59:42] the winds would pick up
[59:44] but he also knew his word
[59:47] would carry them through
[59:53] so he finds him a place to sleep
[59:57] and lays down now who
[1:00:01] would find a place to sleep on a boat
[1:00:04] when a hurricane category 5
[1:00:06] is coming
[1:00:10] someone who knows the power of his word
[1:00:18] he knew the storm was coming but he
[1:00:21] wasn't worried
[1:00:22] he wasn't nervous because he knew the
[1:00:25] storm did not control
[1:00:27] him but he would control the star
[1:00:30] neighborhood
[1:00:31] let me tell you something brother my
[1:00:33] sister we're not wandering down here
[1:00:34] lost
[1:00:35] we have a predetermined destiny we come
[1:00:38] from somewhere
[1:00:39] we're going back to somewhere
[1:00:43] hallelujah
[1:00:44] [Applause]
[1:00:47] amen he would know the storm would not
[1:00:50] control him
[1:00:51] but he would control the story
[1:00:54] you see it seems like every time we try
[1:00:56] to do something for the lord
[1:00:58] every time we try to help someone or try
[1:01:00] to draw closer to god to walk and
[1:01:02] obedience to his word
[1:01:04] it's them times that snags comes
[1:01:06] hindrances comes
[1:01:08] storms begin to rage
[1:01:12] but you see god never told us
[1:01:15] to go back god equipped us as an army
[1:01:20] we are the army of the lord and he's
[1:01:23] equipped us but
[1:01:24] i want you to notice there's not one
[1:01:26] piece of armor
[1:01:27] on our backs because we are never
[1:01:32] to turn back we're going forward
[1:01:35] we are moving forward
[1:01:39] and as long as we're in the will of god
[1:01:41] there is nothing that will stop our
[1:01:43] progress
[1:01:49] amen jesus says let's go over
[1:01:52] to the other side he had a job to do
[1:01:55] tired and weary he lays down to rest
[1:01:57] knowing
[1:01:59] he's in the will of the father moving
[1:02:02] forward across the sea
[1:02:04] to the maniac of gadara
[1:02:08] the disciples here they go moving across
[1:02:11] this lake the sea
[1:02:13] they notice here they go they were in
[1:02:16] the message of the hour
[1:02:21] jesus was with them they were having a
[1:02:24] revival
[1:02:27] they were in a testimony service
[1:02:35] all the things they seen him do all the
[1:02:38] blinded eyes and all the leprosy all the
[1:02:40] things
[1:02:41] they saw they were testifying by god
[1:02:43] what a move we're in
[1:02:46] where his disciples were moving with him
[1:02:53] this journey it should be sweet
[1:02:56] it should be smooth sailing no worries
[1:03:00] no bumps we're his disciples we're
[1:03:03] moving with him
[1:03:04] we're message people we're message
[1:03:06] followers
[1:03:08] sounds good but jesus never promised
[1:03:12] that
[1:03:14] he never said we wouldn't have trials
[1:03:17] he never said we wouldn't suffer he
[1:03:20] never said we wouldn't be laughed at
[1:03:22] or made fun of him
[1:03:26] he never promised a smooth sailing he
[1:03:28] never said there wouldn't be storms
[1:03:31] he never said that but he did say i will
[1:03:34] never leave you
[1:03:36] no when i forsake you then no matter
[1:03:38] what i face in life
[1:03:39] i do not face it alone
[1:03:44] he is with me he will never leave me nor
[1:03:46] will he forsake me
[1:03:50] well hallelujah
[1:03:55] and as they were going across the sea
[1:04:00] the storm began to blow away
[1:04:04] now peter being a seasoned fisherman
[1:04:08] no doubt he thought i've got this
[1:04:14] i don't need prayer i don't need faith
[1:04:16] i've got ability
[1:04:18] i'm a fisherman i'm a seasoned boat
[1:04:22] worker
[1:04:24] i guess that's the wrong term but you
[1:04:25] know what i mean
[1:04:28] boatman thank you buddy i've got this
[1:04:30] boys no worry
[1:04:32] oh i've seen storms like this before
[1:04:33] this ain't nothing
[1:04:38] oh my and he began to try to manipulate
[1:04:41] the boat
[1:04:42] and all his ability as a semen but you
[1:04:45] see what peter fell to realize
[1:04:47] this just wasn't a storm
[1:04:50] this was a storm maybe the greatest
[1:04:53] storm of his life
[1:04:54] maybe the darkest time of his come on
[1:04:56] somebody maybe the darkest time of his
[1:04:58] life and let me say this may be the
[1:05:00] darkest time of your life right now
[1:05:02] but that's always when jesus shows up
[1:05:05] hallelujah he always comes at the
[1:05:07] darkest hour
[1:05:12] it was the darkest hour that the woman
[1:05:14] with the blood as you ever seen
[1:05:16] the doctor said they couldn't help her
[1:05:17] she'd spend all of her money
[1:05:19] 12 years of bleeding it was her darkest
[1:05:22] hour
[1:05:22] then jesus came on the scene
[1:05:25] it was the darkest hour journalist ever
[1:05:27] saw his daughter laying dead
[1:05:29] but it was at that darkest hour that
[1:05:32] jesus showed up
[1:05:34] he said oh brother now that's peter
[1:05:36] that's the woman with the blood issue
[1:05:38] this is me well let me tell you brother
[1:05:40] sister if this is your darkest hour if i
[1:05:42] was you
[1:05:43] i'd be getting ready for my visitation
[1:05:49] it ain't no time to doubt it's time to
[1:05:52] believe
[1:05:54] it's time to rise it's time to stand
[1:05:58] it's time to make us stand
[1:06:02] the devil don't give up
[1:06:16] hallelujah
[1:06:22] [Applause]
[1:06:28] jesus was crossing the sea
[1:06:31] the prophet said the devil knew he was
[1:06:33] on the road to a great victory
[1:06:38] the devil do it
[1:06:41] hey you preached a message on that
[1:06:44] didn't you the devil knows
[1:06:46] the devil knows he just lies to you
[1:06:51] the devil knows god's a healer he knows
[1:06:53] god's a deliverer but he'll tell you he
[1:06:54] won't deliver you he's lying to you
[1:06:57] well better how you know the devil's
[1:06:59] lying to me when he speaks
[1:07:02] it's pretty good indication he was on
[1:07:05] the road to a great victory for god
[1:07:07] and he tried to drown him that night and
[1:07:09] caused the storm to come up
[1:07:10] and ten thousand devils of the sea
[1:07:14] who knew there was that many ten
[1:07:16] thousand devils of the sea
[1:07:18] swore that drowned him that night he was
[1:07:21] tired
[1:07:22] laying in the stern of a boat tired
[1:07:25] because you see it was deity in humanity
[1:07:29] never let your humanity take the
[1:07:32] preeminence over the deity that's in you
[1:07:37] oh hallelujah
[1:07:40] brother how could i be a son of god how
[1:07:42] could i be a daughter of god and have
[1:07:43] all these troubles and have all these
[1:07:44] trials
[1:07:45] don't look at the humanity look at
[1:07:47] what's in you
[1:07:48] remember what he did for you
[1:07:55] the great storm began to rise and as the
[1:07:57] sails were torn and the oars began to
[1:07:59] break
[1:08:00] and they tossed around like a bottle
[1:08:01] stopper the prophet of god said choppy
[1:08:03] water
[1:08:04] maybe 20 foot waves
[1:08:07] where was jesus
[1:08:10] it looks like if he really cared
[1:08:15] he'd have been up there with him
[1:08:18] if he really cared he had it right there
[1:08:20] on peter's shoulder now peter hang on
[1:08:21] buddy i'm with you it's gonna be all
[1:08:23] right
[1:08:26] if you really care why wasn't he up
[1:08:28] there with peter
[1:08:29] why wasn't he at the at the stern
[1:08:37] if he really cared he would have told
[1:08:38] them the storm was coming
[1:08:40] he knew it was coming he knew when it
[1:08:43] would hit
[1:08:44] the very moment it would hit but where
[1:08:47] was he
[1:08:49] in the back of the boat
[1:08:54] no at the end from the beginning he knew
[1:08:56] what was going to happen
[1:08:57] the prophet said don't miss this
[1:09:00] he knew it was going to happen
[1:09:04] the prophet said i doubt very much that
[1:09:05] he was even asleep
[1:09:07] he knew it was going to happen
[1:09:13] then why didn't he stop it
[1:09:18] we're his people he loves us
[1:09:23] he was god god is infinite so he knew
[1:09:27] what was going to happen he knew
[1:09:28] when it was going to happen and it only
[1:09:31] happened
[1:09:32] to test our faith didn't he say so later
[1:09:34] a real child in testing time with this
[1:09:37] they do not walk by sight
[1:09:42] two children of god walks by faith
[1:09:45] you could never walk my side and walk by
[1:09:47] faith at the same time
[1:09:48] you must deny one in order to receive
[1:09:51] the other but i say to you don't look at
[1:09:53] the circumstances
[1:09:54] don't look at the wind don't look at the
[1:09:56] storm look to the one who made the
[1:10:00] promise
[1:10:02] amen a real child of god in testing time
[1:10:06] they do not walk by sight their physical
[1:10:08] eyes are closed to the things around
[1:10:10] them
[1:10:12] the only walk by faith of the lord jesus
[1:10:14] looking to his word and believing
[1:10:15] that he'll keep every promise of his
[1:10:18] word exactly the way he
[1:10:20] said he would do it
[1:10:23] testing time trials sometimes god lets
[1:10:26] afflictions hit his people
[1:10:28] to test their faith he was testing a
[1:10:31] saint
[1:10:32] not rebuking a sinner
[1:10:37] well i must be doing something bad over
[1:10:39] for satan to be attacking me for this to
[1:10:41] be happening to my family
[1:10:43] no don't let the devil lie to you
[1:10:46] it's not rebuking a sinner it's testing
[1:10:49] a saint
[1:10:54] god does that to test
[1:10:57] he lets afflictions hit us and trials
[1:10:59] comes a big trial
[1:11:01] sometimes great waves great storms great
[1:11:04] win why
[1:11:05] to show you just how great he is
[1:11:09] listen to me friends we don't deny we
[1:11:11] have real tears real fear
[1:11:13] real sorrow
[1:11:16] real feelings because we're human
[1:11:21] real pain real trials real feeling real
[1:11:23] hurt real tears real sorrow
[1:11:26] but a real god who's bigger
[1:11:30] my god's bigger than all my trials he's
[1:11:33] bigger than all my chest
[1:11:38] maybe that's why you're sick tonight the
[1:11:40] prophet said maybe that's why there's a
[1:11:42] law in your revival
[1:11:46] god's going to see what you're going to
[1:11:47] do about it everybody can worship god
[1:11:50] when everybody's running the aisles
[1:11:53] but who can stand and believe him when
[1:11:55] everything seems like it's going wrong
[1:11:59] and yet it doesn't move your faith
[1:12:03] oh god let me be that kind of a warrior
[1:12:15] sometimes the giant is so big
[1:12:19] people were vetting on it if they was
[1:12:21] betting on the david david and goliath
[1:12:23] fight
[1:12:23] who would have vegas bet on where would
[1:12:25] they put their money
[1:12:28] on the giant goliath was a giant david
[1:12:31] was a boy
[1:12:34] goliath was a champion warrior he had
[1:12:36] trophies
[1:12:38] david was a shepherd goliath had a sword
[1:12:43] david had a slingshot goliath was
[1:12:47] dressed in armor
[1:12:49] david was dressed in sheepskin
[1:12:53] who won
[1:12:57] why god was with david amen
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:02] don't look at the giant look at who's
[1:13:04] with you amen
[1:13:08] trouble sets in the storm was so great
[1:13:10] the wind the rain the lightning
[1:13:12] they were so busy fighting for their
[1:13:14] lives they forgot
[1:13:16] that the very one that said let us go to
[1:13:19] the other side
[1:13:20] the very creator was in the boat with
[1:13:24] them
[1:13:25] the very thing the very one who created
[1:13:28] the wind
[1:13:28] who created the rain was in the boat
[1:13:32] with them
[1:13:35] he should have known he knew all things
[1:13:38] they should have knew that he knew what
[1:13:39] was going to happen
[1:13:40] they should have remembered he has it
[1:13:43] all in control
[1:13:45] why was he letting it happen
[1:13:49] when he got into the ship why did he
[1:13:50] just go lay down he knew it was going to
[1:13:52] happen
[1:13:53] why the prophet said he was only testing
[1:13:56] their faith
[1:13:58] do you believe what i tell you
[1:14:03] ain't that something jesus never asked
[1:14:05] for our money
[1:14:07] he never asked for our ability he never
[1:14:09] asked for our education
[1:14:10] all he ever asked us to do
[1:14:13] was just believe
[1:14:18] do you believe what i tell you
[1:14:25] finally when the waves had them beat
[1:14:28] down
[1:14:29] and the wind was so strong
[1:14:32] and they were going to sink it looked
[1:14:33] like everything was crashing in
[1:14:37] it wasn't getting better it was getting
[1:14:38] worse
[1:14:40] what are we going to do what are we
[1:14:43] going to do
[1:14:44] no their fear and all their anguish the
[1:14:47] greatest storm of their life
[1:14:48] 10 000 demons tried to drown them
[1:14:52] finally he realized
[1:14:55] wait a minute wait a minute
[1:14:59] where's jesus
[1:15:04] he's in the boat with us
[1:15:10] then the answer to the storm was in the
[1:15:13] boat with them
[1:15:16] awake the master
[1:15:22] hallelujah
[1:15:24] the answer wasn't in gadara the answer
[1:15:26] wasn't on the shore of the other country
[1:15:28] the answer was in the boat with them
[1:15:34] well he rebukes the storm the winds see
[1:15:38] obeys him
[1:15:40] that was a great calm and he turned to
[1:15:42] them said
[1:15:44] why was you so fearful where is your
[1:15:47] faith
[1:15:48] did not i say we're going to the other
[1:15:50] side
[1:15:54] did not he say we're going in a rapture
[1:15:59] did not he say i'll send you elijah the
[1:16:01] prophet did not he say
[1:16:03] there would be a fivefold ministry for
[1:16:05] the perfecting of the saints
[1:16:06] has not he kept every promise he's made
[1:16:08] us
[1:16:09] that same god who said that i'm your
[1:16:12] healer i'm your deliverer
[1:16:14] that saint god said you are going in our
[1:16:18] actions
[1:16:25] amen amen
[1:16:28] who are you so fearful was not i with
[1:16:32] you the whole time
[1:16:34] you know there is among the cherokee
[1:16:37] it's called the rite of passage
[1:16:39] when a boy reaches the age of 12 his
[1:16:41] father takes him to a secret place
[1:16:44] sets him on a rock or on a stump
[1:16:48] and the father will take a blindfold and
[1:16:50] blindfold the boy's eyes
[1:16:53] and he ties his hands and he ties his
[1:16:55] feet
[1:16:56] but he ties them loose so that the boy
[1:16:59] wants to get out he can
[1:17:02] it's his choice and he sets him on a
[1:17:04] stump or he sets him on a rock
[1:17:06] and the boy must sit there all night
[1:17:09] long if he gets up
[1:17:13] he fails the test if he moves the
[1:17:15] blindfold he fails to test
[1:17:17] he must sit there all night
[1:17:21] long but if he sets there
[1:17:24] and he's faithful to the test at the
[1:17:27] rising of the sun when the rays of the
[1:17:30] sun strikes the boy's face
[1:17:32] he can come out of the ties because
[1:17:34] remember they're loose he can come out
[1:17:35] of the ties
[1:17:36] take off the blindfold and he's a man
[1:17:39] it's called the right of passage
[1:17:43] so the father takes the boy sets him on
[1:17:46] a stump or a rock
[1:17:47] blindfolds him ties his hands ties and
[1:17:48] feet the boy sits there
[1:17:51] oh it's fine you know about 10 10 30 11
[1:17:53] o'clock
[1:17:54] the wind starts blowing the leaves you
[1:17:57] get that little
[1:17:58] scared feeling when it's dark outside
[1:17:59] you ain't got a flashlight
[1:18:01] i used to take my girls camping you know
[1:18:03] out in the backyard i tell the sheryl i
[1:18:05] say leave the door unlocked we'll be in
[1:18:06] about 11 o'clock
[1:18:08] first time the coyote yelps we'll be
[1:18:10] coming in the sounds of the night
[1:18:13] but he must sit there the rustle of the
[1:18:14] leagues what is it is it a bear
[1:18:16] is it a coyote is it a shawnee
[1:18:19] looking for a scalp he don't know he's
[1:18:22] blindfolded
[1:18:23] so he must sit there all night the
[1:18:26] sounds of the force the wind the rustle
[1:18:27] of the leaves
[1:18:29] but at the dawning of a new day if he's
[1:18:31] been faithful to the test
[1:18:33] and the light strikes him he takes off
[1:18:35] the blindfold he comes out of the ties
[1:18:36] he takes off the blindfold and it's only
[1:18:38] then that he realizes
[1:18:40] sitting behind him was his daddy
[1:18:47] he was there he was there
[1:18:52] he was there
[1:18:56] he was there the whole time he
[1:18:59] never left him well don't worry about
[1:19:02] the darkness of laodicea

[1:19:06] leaves of clogan don't worry about the
[1:19:08] fearmongers
[1:19:08] don't worry about the politics he's with
[1:19:11] us

[1:19:20] storm

[1:19:24] ship with them he can calm your storm
[1:19:27] by being in the ship with you the answer
[1:19:30] to the storm was in the ship with them

[1:20:18] two fellows in the same ship
[1:20:21] as we travel on the sea of life let us
[1:20:23] remember

[1:20:45] them all

[1:20:55] trouble that they can't remedy
[1:20:57] such a sickness a cancer so forth that
[1:20:59] the doctors can't
[1:21:00] they don't know what to do about it but
[1:21:03] just remember

[1:21:09] he's got it all in control
[1:21:13] he's got it all in control
[1:21:17] he put that reassurance way down in my
[1:21:21] [Music]

[1:24:29] years ago for the glory of god
[1:24:31] about that night it was just to me to
[1:24:32] have a prayer line there's so many so we
[1:24:33] thought we just have one mass prayer for
[1:24:35] the people
[1:24:36] and i told the people i said just lay
[1:24:37] hands on one another stage about four
[1:24:39] foot off the ground was up on the stage
[1:24:41] about 600 people just as far back as you
[1:24:43] can see where people
[1:24:44] about halfway back on the end was a
[1:24:46] sister and i told the saints of god i
[1:24:48] said just lay hands on one another
[1:24:49] and bow your head and we'll have one
