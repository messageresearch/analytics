[44:28] promise of god
[44:29] we are occupiers tonight and we look
[44:31] here in exodus 23 and verse 20 it says
[44:34] behold i send an angel or a messenger
[44:37] before thee to keep thee in the way and
[44:39] to bring thee into the place
[44:41] which i have prepared
[44:44] beware of him and obey his voice provoke
[44:46] him not for he will not pardon your
[44:48] transgressions for my name or that word
[44:51] their name means reputation his fame and
[44:54] his glory is in him but if thou shall
[44:57] indeed obey his voice and do all that i
[44:59] speak then i will be an enemy unto thy
[45:01] enemies and an adversary unto thy
[45:03] adversaries for my angels shall go
[45:05] before thee to bring thee unto the
[45:07] amorites the hittites the perizzites the
[45:09] canaanites the hivites the jebusites and
[45:12] i will cut them off god did not hide who
[45:15] the enemies were he told them i'm to
[45:17] bring you into the land this is who
[45:18] you're going to face but he's already
[45:20] promised you i've given you the land
[45:23] oh church god's not going to allow you
[45:25] to be blindsided
[45:27] he's telling you right here he says i
[45:29] will cut them off thou shall not bow
[45:32] down to their gods nor serve them nor do
[45:35] after their works but thou shalt utterly
[45:38] overthrow them and quite break down
[45:40] their images
[45:42] god said what he is going to do and
[45:44] god's telling you what he expects you to
[45:46] do
[45:47] oh this is a two-part relationship
[45:51] he says and you shall serve the lord
[45:53] your god and he shall he shall bless thy
[45:56] bread and thy water and i will take
[45:58] sickness away from the midst of thee and
[46:01] i it's noticed now and there shall
[46:03] nothing cast her young nor be barren
[46:06] otherwise he's saying there's not going
[46:07] to be any abortions in that land there's
[46:09] not going to be any miscarriages in that
[46:11] land there's not going to be any
[46:12] sterility in that land or any barrenness
[46:14] in that land but you're going to be
[46:16] fruitful in that land
[46:19] and he says now the number of thy days i
[46:22] will fulfill and i will send my fear
[46:24] upon thee and i will destroy all the
[46:26] people whom thou shalt come and i will
[46:28] make all thy enemies turn their backs
[46:30] unto thee and i will send hornets before
[46:33] thee we shall drive out the hive the
[46:35] canaanite the hittite from before thee
[46:37] and i will drive them out from before
[46:39] thee in one year he goes excuse me i
[46:42] will not drive them out before thee in
[46:43] one year
[46:44] lest the land become desolate and the
[46:46] beasts of the field multiply against
[46:48] thee
[46:49] by little and little will i drive them
[46:52] out from before thee until thou be
[46:54] increased
[46:56] sometimes we want god to do it overnight
[46:58] but god says i'll do it little by little
[47:01] so that the land does not be increased
[47:04] and notice what he says now and thou
[47:06] shall make no covenant with them nor
[47:09] with their gods verse 32
[47:11] and they shall dwell they shall not
[47:13] dwell in thy land lest they make thee a
[47:15] sin against thee
[47:17] for if thou serve their gods it will
[47:20] surely be a snare
[47:22] unto thee god bless you you can have
[47:24] your seats tonight
[47:31] so i want to speak to you as i said
[47:33] occupiers of the promise
[47:36] there are over 8
[47:38] 800 promises in the bible if you turn me
[47:42] down just a tad bit brother david
[47:44] 8
[47:45] 800 promises in the bible the word
[47:47] promise appears more than 100 times in
[47:49] the scriptures there was a gentleman by
[47:52] the name of everett r storms he was a
[47:54] school teacher in canada
[47:56] who made a detailed study of promises
[47:59] and the promises in the bible and he
[48:01] read on his 27th reading of the bible a
[48:04] task that which took him a year and a
[48:05] half
[48:06] he totaled up
[48:08] 8810 promises of those
[48:11] 8810 promises
[48:14] 7487 of them promises were made by god
[48:18] to humankind
[48:21] so i don't know where you are tonight
[48:23] but i believe there's a promise there
[48:24] for you
[48:26] i believe that we as children of god can
[48:28] reach up and grab hold of one of the
[48:32] 7487 promises that god has afforded to
[48:35] us as believers tonight
[48:37] he said well brother joe i can't
[48:39] understand that but look what the bible
[48:40] says in first kings 8 and 56 blessed be
[48:43] the lord that hath given rest unto his
[48:46] people israel according to all that he
[48:48] promised there has not failed one word
[48:51] of all his good promise which he
[48:54] promised by the hand of moses his
[48:56] servants there's not one promise of god
[48:59] that he can fail to deliver on if you
[49:01] can believe god and take god in his word
[49:03] tonight
[49:05] now this portion of scripture that we
[49:06] read here in exodus as i read those 13
[49:10] scriptures or those 13 yeah scriptures i
[49:12] counted 12 to 13 promises that god
[49:15] promised you as a believer
[49:19] so i want to say this tonight that out
[49:21] of all these promises
[49:23] god is calling for occupiers to occupy
[49:26] the promise
[49:27] so no matter what you're facing no
[49:29] matter what you're needing today you can
[49:31] rest assured that laying in the word of
[49:33] god is a promises that will fit your
[49:36] need that would heal your body that will
[49:38] deliver the situation god can meet your
[49:40] financial situation god can meet your
[49:43] children's situations god has got a
[49:45] promise laying in the word tonight and
[49:47] he's looking for somebody that will
[49:49] believe and occupy the word of god
[49:52] so i firmly believe tonight no matter
[49:54] what we're facing
[49:57] we're occupiers of not just one but
[49:59] every promise i believe they're entitled
[50:01] they're for us and so much that god will
[50:04] promise us he says i'm going to send an
[50:05] angel before you notice i'm going to
[50:08] send a messenger that he's going to go
[50:09] to before you he will keep you in the
[50:12] way
[50:13] and not only will he keep you in the way
[50:15] but he will lead you into the land that
[50:17] i prepared for you and god as he sent
[50:20] that promise to them and that day god
[50:22] has sent a messenger in this day for one
[50:24] purpose is to keep us in the way and
[50:27] when you get out of step it's resonating
[50:29] around the message get back in line get
[50:32] back in step stay in tune with the word
[50:35] stay in tune with the message of the
[50:37] hour
[50:37] so he sent us a message to keep us in
[50:40] line to bring us to the place that he
[50:42] had prepared for us
[50:45] john 14 and verse 1 he says let your
[50:47] heart not be troubled
[50:49] you believe in god believe also in me
[50:52] in my father's house or many matches if
[50:54] it were not so i would have told you but
[50:56] i go to prepare a place for you
[51:01] oh we may mourn on this side of the
[51:03] passing of our brother jerome but god

[51:08] place

[51:21] had already gone before to prepare
[51:23] promise
[51:25] and look brother jerome cashed in on the
[51:27] dividends of that promise he believed to
[51:29] the end

[51:35] for you i
[51:36] will come again
[51:38] what a promise
[51:40] what a promise if i go to prepare a
[51:42] place i will come again and receive you
[51:45] unto myself
[51:48] that where i am there you may be also
[51:51] and whether i go you know in the way you
[51:54] know the word prepare here means to get
[51:56] everything ready

[52:04] he's going to prepare a place for us for
[52:07] where he is his desires is to have his
[52:10] bride right there with him by his side
[52:14] god wants you next to him i know
[52:16] sometimes you pray and god doesn't move
[52:18] sometimes you pray and god remains quiet
[52:21] but god is preparing a place he's
[52:22] already gone before you he's given you
[52:25] that promise that where i am you can be
[52:27] also as a children of israel notice as
[52:29] they were in their exodus so are we as
[52:32] the elected god are in our own exodus
[52:35] we're pilgrims and strangers i hope you
[52:37] don't plan on sitting setting up camp on
[52:39] this side and make the best of this life
[52:41] because this life is full of
[52:42] disappointments
[52:44] see they were in a conquest they were
[52:46] promised to land there was the land of
[52:48] canaan god promised them i'm gonna bring
[52:50] you to all these different individuals
[52:52] all these different tribes all these
[52:53] different ones in that land but i want
[52:55] you to know i've given you the land that
[52:58] land belongs to you it don't belong to
[53:00] the occupants that are already there in
[53:02] that land but i've given it to you and
[53:04] just as god promised him a natural land
[53:06] god has promised us a supernatural land
[53:09] god has given us a promise on this side
[53:11] look don't cash in on this side god has
[53:14] given you a word hang on to the bitter
[53:16] end one day these bodies are going to be
[53:18] transformed
[53:21] notice they had a natural land but for
[53:23] us it's not a natural land it's a land
[53:26] that will never grow old never get weary
[53:28] never get sick
[53:29] never have a disappointment never need a
[53:31] doctor's visit never need medicine
[53:34] what a land church what a land that god
[53:36] has promised us
[53:39] and there's been others who have gone
[53:40] before us and they're occupying it right
[53:42] now
[53:43] and if i believe they can look over that
[53:45] grand stand that banister they would be
[53:47] hollering they would be cheering you on
[53:48] press the battle
[53:50] press to battle don't give up you're
[53:52] you're closing in the finish line is
[53:54] drawing near press the battle occupy the
[53:57] promise
[53:59] occupy the promise
[54:01] notice he's promised us the land beyond
[54:03] this jordan
[54:04] beyond death the land that flows with
[54:06] milk and honey and land that is just
[54:08] beyond the curtain of time
[54:10] and if i could say it the way the
[54:12] prophet would say it i may have it just
[54:13] exactly wrong but that's okay but it's
[54:15] just a few feet above us right now
[54:18] just going a little bit faster than what
[54:19] we're going
[54:20] and one day when that slows down and we
[54:22] speed up we're going to be in a new body
[54:24] church
[54:26] one day that's not a that's not a fairy
[54:28] tale
[54:28] that's a promise
[54:30] and we're going to cash in on the
[54:32] promise and occupy a new body
[54:36] occupy an eternal reign
[54:39] notice what brother branham would tell
[54:40] us in the message things that are to be
[54:42] talking about going beyond the curtain
[54:44] of time he said it's perfect
[54:46] he goes oh it wouldn't even touch us
[54:48] sublime there's no english vocabulary
[54:50] that i know no word at all that could
[54:52] ever express what it is it's beyond
[54:55] anything that i know there he was there
[54:57] was no sickness no sorrow you couldn't
[55:00] die you couldn't sin it was just perfect
[55:03] just perfect
[55:05] friends you mustn't you mustn't miss it
[55:09] what a promise
[55:12] what a promise to a people
[55:14] notice god gave abraham a covenant 4 000
[55:17] years ago
[55:19] i'm going to take you to a land
[55:21] moses led israel out of egypt and joshua
[55:24] led in the conquest of the land 3 400
[55:27] years ago
[55:28] david established jerusalem as israel's
[55:31] capital 3000 years ago after the exile
[55:34] of babylon or to babylon and then return
[55:37] again jesus came to die on the cross
[55:39] after jesus extended ascended back to
[55:41] heaven israel was again dispersed by the
[55:44] romans two thousand years ago but after
[55:46] the millennia of the dispersion of their
[55:48] sins
[55:49] at the proclamation of the british and
[55:51] the u.n israel again became a nation in
[55:54] 1948
[55:56] unlike during the roman occupation where
[55:58] caesar's and herod's rule today israel
[56:00] as in is in its own government and
[56:02] military or it has its own government
[56:04] its own military it's a bona fide
[56:06] independent nation has its own borders
[56:09] so today we can say that israel is back
[56:11] in our homeland natural israel is now
[56:14] occupying the promise that god gave to
[56:17] abraham 4 000 years ago and as a prophet
[56:20] god will say this he said israel back in
[56:22] her promised land she don't know how she
[56:24] got back there she was just
[56:26] automatically put there why national
[56:29] force put her in there national force
[56:31] put israel in her homeland national
[56:34] force put we'll put the church in the
[56:35] world council of churches but the power
[56:38] of god will put the people in the bride
[56:41] oh church i'm not looking at national
[56:43] forces we got a promise we got a word
[56:46] that's going to put this people this
[56:47] body right here tonight in the body
[56:49] called the bride of christ
[56:52] he said world forces the world forces
[56:55] this way and the world forces that way
[56:57] but god forces upward the spirit of god
[57:00] which is the word of god my word is
[57:02] spirit and life we'll put the bride in
[57:04] her place because she'll recognize her
[57:06] position in the word then she's in
[57:08] christ will put her in her place no
[57:11] national force would do it but the
[57:12] national forest did drive israel to our
[57:15] homeland the natural or national forces
[57:18] of the council of churches will drive
[57:20] every organization into it but the power
[57:23] of god will raise the bride into glory
[57:26] and out of it i say oh glory to god what
[57:28] a promise tonight and god looking at
[57:30] people tonight that are occupiers of
[57:33] that promise why are you here you've
[57:36] been through heartache you've been
[57:37] through disappointments but you're here
[57:39] tonight because why you believe the
[57:41] promise
[57:42] you believe the word of god you're hold
[57:45] known for that body change for that
[57:47] realization that one day
[57:50] one day
[57:52] soon
[57:54] one day soon it's all gonna change
[57:58] israel back in our homeland with their
[58:01] own government own money own flag their
[58:03] own borders look church we've been
[58:05] dispersed
[58:06] down through church age after church age
[58:08] we've had our trials we've had our
[58:10] tribulations we've had our battles we've
[58:12] had disappointments but we will occupy
[58:15] the promised land that god has gone to
[58:18] prepare for this bride
[58:21] he has sent us a word
[58:23] he has sent us a message and it's this
[58:25] message is going to raise us into the
[58:27] body of christ it's going to raise us
[58:29] raise us up out of these old pest house
[58:33] and lift us up into a heavenly
[58:34] atmosphere
[58:36] this word occupy
[58:39] it means to take hold of
[58:41] to take possession of
[58:44] it means to reside
[58:46] in as an
[58:48] owner
[58:50] not a tenant
[58:52] not somebody who's written a place but
[58:53] you own the place
[58:55] oh i'm talking about sons and daughters
[58:57] of god tonight i'm preaching them with
[58:59] men and women tonight who are owners of
[59:01] the promise i'm talking about those like
[59:04] that have taken hold of a body change
[59:06] they're taking hold of a rapture i'm
[59:08] talking about those that are owners of a
[59:10] new body that one will never grow old
[59:12] woman ever gets sick one that'll never
[59:14] need a doctor i'm preaching to young
[59:16] people tonight who will take hold of
[59:17] that promised land and it ain't just
[59:19] mama it ain't just daddy it ain't just
[59:21] one camp meet to a next family but you
[59:24] have met god you have met the pillar of
[59:26] fire and he's real in your life and
[59:28] that's why you're here that's why you're
[59:30] serving god
[59:32] because you want to occupy that same
[59:34] promise that's been given to generation
[59:36] after generation
[59:43] notice now
[59:45] joshua 5 and verse 1 and it came to pass
[59:47] when all the kings of the amorites
[59:50] which were on the side of jordan
[59:51] westward
[59:53] and the kings
[59:55] excuse me
[59:59] and the kings of the canaanites which
[1:00:00] were by the sea
[1:00:02] they heard that the lord had dried up
[1:00:03] the waters of jordan
[1:00:05] from before the children of israel
[1:00:07] until we were passed over
[1:00:09] that their heart melted
[1:00:11] neither was their spirit in them anymore
[1:00:14] because of the children
[1:00:15] of israel
[1:00:17] church hell is afraid of you
[1:00:20] oh come on somebody
[1:00:23] church hell is afraid of you let me just
[1:00:26] say they heard how cancer's been
[1:00:27] defeated
[1:00:28] they heard how cancer been defeated they
[1:00:30] heard how alopecia was defeated they
[1:00:33] heard how brain bleeds were defeated oh
[1:00:35] they heard how little boy drew but
[1:00:37] couldn't walk got up and began to walk
[1:00:39] and i preached his testimony in
[1:00:41] newfoundland canada three or four weeks
[1:00:43] ago and a young boy who they said was
[1:00:45] going to be put in braces i gave that
[1:00:47] testimony and the spirit of god came
[1:00:50] behind it and that little boy today he
[1:00:52] don't need braces he's totally well what
[1:00:54] am i talking to you about hell is afraid
[1:00:57] of the occupiers of the word
[1:00:59] hell is afraid of you tonight you've got
[1:01:02] jurisdiction over the word over the
[1:01:04] enemy tonight
[1:01:05] [Applause]
[1:01:07] hell isn't where there's a people in the
[1:01:08] land that's focused on one thing
[1:01:11] occupying the promise
[1:01:14] they refuse to live
[1:01:16] in a defeated state
[1:01:17] they refuse to live in a contented state
[1:01:21] they are determined to move in
[1:01:24] and take possession
[1:01:26] you know it's like how brother branham
[1:01:27] would talk if you got a new home
[1:01:30] you just wouldn't sit on the outside of
[1:01:32] it and just admire it would you
[1:01:34] you go in
[1:01:36] and you explore
[1:01:39] and you look at the kitchen
[1:01:41] and you look at the bedroom and you look
[1:01:43] at the bathroom and you look at every
[1:01:45] room and say that's all mine
[1:01:47] it's all mine
[1:01:49] it's all my you occupy you don't stay
[1:01:52] outside
[1:01:54] oh i got me a new house and you're
[1:01:55] camped out in the yard
[1:01:57] no you go in you occupy you set up
[1:01:59] households
[1:02:02] and that's what god is calling us to do
[1:02:06] notice now
[1:02:08] chapter 5 and verse 2.
[1:02:12] so this new generation
[1:02:15] this new generation came in
[1:02:17] but before they can possess the promised
[1:02:19] land that brother tim had been speaking
[1:02:21] on they had to be circumcised
[1:02:24] he said at the time the lord said unto
[1:02:25] joshua make these sharp knives and
[1:02:27] circumcise again the children of israel
[1:02:30] the second time
[1:02:31] and joshua made sharp knives and
[1:02:33] circumcised the children of israel at
[1:02:35] the heel of the foreskins and this is
[1:02:37] the cause while joshua did circumcise
[1:02:39] all the people that came out of egypt
[1:02:41] that were males even all the men of war
[1:02:43] died in the wilderness by the way after
[1:02:45] they came out of egypt now all the
[1:02:48] people that came out were circumcised
[1:02:50] but all the people that were born in the
[1:02:52] wilderness by the way as they came forth
[1:02:54] out of egypt then they had not
[1:02:56] circumcised
[1:02:58] verse seven and their children whom he
[1:03:00] raised up in their stead
[1:03:01] them joshua circumcised for they were
[1:03:03] uncircumcised because they had not
[1:03:06] circumcised him by the way
[1:03:08] see that generation had to have their
[1:03:11] own experience
[1:03:12] that generation couldn't get in on the
[1:03:15] generation before it was because they
[1:03:16] were circumcised because they had an
[1:03:19] experience because maybe the prophet
[1:03:20] spoke to them and called them out in a
[1:03:22] prayer line they had to have their own
[1:03:24] experience they had to be circumcised
[1:03:26] for themselves and we find here
[1:03:28] circumcision was the key to occupying
[1:03:31] the land
[1:03:34] circumcision was the key to occupying
[1:03:37] the land they were told they had to be
[1:03:40] circumcised in order for the new
[1:03:42] generation to move into the promised
[1:03:43] land they had to be circumcised and for
[1:03:46] them to take possession of what god told
[1:03:49] moses many years ago and how god
[1:03:51] reiterated showing that he's the same
[1:03:53] yesterday today and forever the same
[1:03:56] promise that he gave to moses to occupy
[1:03:59] the lamb was the same promise that he
[1:04:00] gave to joshua to occupy the land look
[1:04:03] he's showing that god is the same he
[1:04:05] doesn't change but as long as you can go
[1:04:07] forth and occupy the word he said the
[1:04:09] men who were born in the wilderness they
[1:04:11] had to be circumcised they had to
[1:04:13] receive the holy ghost they had to meet
[1:04:16] the god of moses they had to meet the
[1:04:18] god of joshua they had to meet god for
[1:04:21] themselves that's why a young person you
[1:04:23] need to meet god not just did by obama's
[1:04:25] religion or daddy's religion or tim
[1:04:28] pruitt's religion or joe adams religion
[1:04:30] or aaron hogan's be religious but you
[1:04:32] got to get by on knowing the god of
[1:04:34] abraham the god of jacob the god of
[1:04:36] isaac you've got to know the god of
[1:04:38] william branham that he's the same
[1:04:39] yesterday today and forever
[1:04:41] you've got to be an occupier of the same
[1:04:44] word the same fruit the same
[1:04:46] supernatural strength and power that he
[1:04:48] possessed you dare to possess as well
[1:04:54] so if we're going to possess
[1:04:56] the promise of god
[1:04:58] then we got to meet god
[1:05:00] we got to meet god we plan on occupying
[1:05:02] our promised land we just can't occupy
[1:05:04] based on somebody else but we got to
[1:05:06] have our own experience brother braham
[1:05:08] says this and he swore by himself god
[1:05:11] give him a sign speaking about abraham
[1:05:13] he circus circumcised him as a sign of
[1:05:16] seal and abraham's seed still receives
[1:05:20] circumcision
[1:05:22] see they did it all through the age
[1:05:23] until the moon faded out the law and the
[1:05:25] sun came in he said every son of abraham
[1:05:28] is circumcised today not of the flesh
[1:05:30] but of the heart the holy spirit
[1:05:32] circumcises the heart cuts away the
[1:05:34] things of the world and makes you a new
[1:05:36] creature in christ
[1:05:38] makes you a new creature circumcision is
[1:05:41] to cut off the surplus flesh
[1:05:44] so abraham received circumcision as a
[1:05:46] confirmation
[1:05:48] that new generation receive circumcision
[1:05:51] as a confirmation
[1:05:53] of their faith to be able to occupy the
[1:05:56] land
[1:05:57] and if they did so do we
[1:05:59] we got to have the holy ghost why do we
[1:06:01] do youth camps
[1:06:04] why don't we do it it ain't so you can
[1:06:06] pick up a mate though it's the best
[1:06:07] place for it if that's what you're into
[1:06:09] but so you can you can beat god
[1:06:13] so you can walk in his presence
[1:06:15] you can step forward and come through a
[1:06:17] prayer line and knowing the angel the
[1:06:18] lord is right there
[1:06:20] not only is that he's there to feel you
[1:06:22] he's there to heal you he's there to
[1:06:24] deliver you that's why we do these
[1:06:26] things you think it's just so brother
[1:06:27] tim can get a big name it's not so he
[1:06:28] can get a big name and have big name
[1:06:30] preachers it's so that you can have an
[1:06:32] experience with god and that's not for
[1:06:34] just the youngest for some of you old
[1:06:35] hands as well
[1:06:37] because you need to touch of god just as
[1:06:38] much as these young people need a touch
[1:06:40] of god and what greater atmosphere than
[1:06:42] a young person create an atmosphere for
[1:06:44] themselves and for you so you can walk
[1:06:46] through that same prayer line and the
[1:06:47] same holy ghost to touch them the same
[1:06:50] power of god that delivered him is the
[1:06:51] same one that'll touch you the same one
[1:06:53] that'll meet your need
[1:06:59] so notice once
[1:07:01] oh i love this notice what he says here
[1:07:03] let me just go back and read this
[1:07:05] and no children whom they raised from
[1:07:07] the stead from joshua circumcised for
[1:07:09] they were circumcised because they had
[1:07:11] not been circumcised and by the way and
[1:07:13] it came to pass when they had done
[1:07:14] circumcising all the people
[1:07:16] their abode in the places in the camp
[1:07:18] they were both there in their places in
[1:07:20] the camp until they were whole and the
[1:07:22] lord said unto joshua this day have i
[1:07:24] rolled away the reproach of egypt of all
[1:07:25] philippi wherefore the name of the place
[1:07:28] is called gilgal until this day that
[1:07:30] word gilgal means rolling so we find
[1:07:33] here that the children of israel for
[1:07:35] many years they lived in egypt they
[1:07:37] thrived in egypt they once were
[1:07:39] successful in egypt but there came on
[1:07:41] the throne of pharaoh who didn't know
[1:07:43] joseph and things began to change they
[1:07:45] began to suffer they began to be
[1:07:47] involved they began to be beat harassed
[1:07:49] threatened mistreated they became slaves
[1:07:52] in egypt and to egypt but i want you to
[1:07:54] know this day he wrote the reproach of
[1:07:56] egypt off their life why because they
[1:07:58] came according to the promise of god if
[1:08:01] you'll circumcise you'll enter into that
[1:08:03] promised land and the reproach of egypt
[1:08:05] the history of egypt the stars of egypt
[1:08:08] will be removed off your life and god
[1:08:10] will never remember your past in egypt
[1:08:13] god has provided something better for
[1:08:15] your church oh let me just tell you you
[1:08:17] may have been identified with smoking
[1:08:19] you may have been identified with
[1:08:20] drinking you may have been identified
[1:08:22] with sex sins or church answering but
[1:08:24] i'm gonna tell you today god has sent
[1:08:26] you a word and he's wrong to replace the
[1:08:29] reproach of the world lost your life now
[1:08:31] you're free
[1:08:32] you're free to occupy the land
[1:08:36] you're free to possess your promise
[1:08:41] their life was scarred
[1:08:43] and maybe your life had been scarred
[1:08:45] choices you made people you heard
[1:08:46] opportunities you missed
[1:08:48] but this day
[1:08:50] this day
[1:08:51] the lord has rolled a reproach have sent
[1:08:53] nature off your life
[1:08:56] you no longer identify with this world
[1:08:58] you're no longer identified with sin
[1:08:59] with drinking smoking sex sins you're no
[1:09:02] longer identified with your past now
[1:09:05] you are identified as a son and a
[1:09:07] daughter of god
[1:09:09] that's who you are now
[1:09:11] beloved
[1:09:12] what manner of love hath the father
[1:09:14] bestowed upon us that now
[1:09:17] we should be called sons of god oh what
[1:09:20] a greater death what a greater honor
[1:09:23] than to be called a child of god
[1:09:27] notice he tells us
[1:09:29] through moses
[1:09:31] deuteronomy 30 and verse 8.
[1:09:35] and thou shall return
[1:09:38] and thou shall return and obey the voice
[1:09:40] of the lord and do all his commandments
[1:09:42] which i commanded thee this day and the
[1:09:44] lord thy god
[1:09:46] will make thee plenteous
[1:09:48] in every work of thy hand in the fruit
[1:09:50] of thy body in the fruit of thy cattle
[1:09:52] and the fruit of thy land for good for
[1:09:54] the lord
[1:09:55] will again rejoice over thee for good
[1:09:57] and
[1:09:57] as he rejoiced over thy fathers and he's
[1:10:00] telling the new generation
[1:10:02] what he's going to do
[1:10:04] and what they're they are to do verse 11
[1:10:07] for this
[1:10:08] commandment which i command through this
[1:10:09] day is not hidden from thee
[1:10:11] neither is it far off it is not in
[1:10:13] heaven that thou should say who shall go
[1:10:15] up to heaven
[1:10:16] and bring it to us that we may hear it
[1:10:19] and do it neither is it beyond the sea
[1:10:20] that thou should say who shall go over
[1:10:22] the sea for us and bring it unto us that
[1:10:24] we may hear it and do it but the word is
[1:10:26] very not unto thee
[1:10:29] in thy mouth
[1:10:31] and in thy heart that thou mayest
[1:10:34] do it well church this is not hard
[1:10:37] god has prom god had promised him that
[1:10:40] if they wholly follow the lord he would
[1:10:42] bless them beyond measure
[1:10:45] he will bless the fruit of their hand he
[1:10:46] will breast the fruit of their land he
[1:10:48] will bless their cattle there'd be no
[1:10:50] barrenness in that land and all that
[1:10:52] israel had to do was obey the voice of
[1:10:54] god
[1:10:57] but we find israel began to forsake
[1:11:00] god and forsake his word and forsake his
[1:11:03] counsel and give up on his promise
[1:11:08] see it was due to their disobedience
[1:11:10] that they became they began to live
[1:11:12] below their god give them privileges
[1:11:14] and each of you tonight god has given
[1:11:16] you a god-given privilege to serve him
[1:11:20] god has given you a privilege it's an
[1:11:22] honor to sit on this pew tonight
[1:11:26] church you don't understand these
[1:11:27] brothers and myself we receive messages
[1:11:29] around the world wishing they could sit
[1:11:31] where you're sitting
[1:11:33] how else would a sister with her two
[1:11:36] children
[1:11:37] in a moment's time get on a plane and
[1:11:39] travel 30 plus hours to sit in a seat
[1:11:42] that you occupy
[1:11:44] because she wants to be an occupier of
[1:11:46] the promise
[1:11:48] don't take this opportunity for granted
[1:11:51] see the same god that was with moses was
[1:11:53] the same god that was with joshua the
[1:11:55] same god that was with the prophet is
[1:11:56] the same god with us tonight
[1:11:59] and as he told the prophet i'm going to
[1:12:00] show you beyond the curtain of time that
[1:12:02] was giving us a glimpse of where we're
[1:12:04] headed church there's a land beyond the
[1:12:05] river
[1:12:06] there's a land and it's not a fairy tale
[1:12:09] it's not a pipe dream it's not air
[1:12:10] castles it's a land
[1:12:12] and there's been different ones out of
[1:12:14] this congregation who are right now on
[1:12:16] that other side jerry shull jerome bus
[1:12:18] different ones memo buzz karen pruitt
[1:12:20] different ones are already on the
[1:12:22] streets of gold
[1:12:23] just fellowshipping waiting on us to
[1:12:26] occupy our portion of that promise
[1:12:29] but notice now they begin to live below
[1:12:32] their god-given privileges let's look in
[1:12:34] judges 2 and verse 8.
[1:12:38] judges 2 and verse 8.
[1:12:43] and joshua the son of nun the servant of
[1:12:45] the lord he died
[1:12:47] being 110 years old and they buried him
[1:12:50] in the border of the inherit inheritance
[1:12:52] of that wonderful word there that i
[1:12:54] can't pronounce in the mount of ephraim
[1:12:56] on the north side of the hill of gash
[1:12:59] and also all the generation were
[1:13:01] gathered unto their fathers and they
[1:13:03] arose another generation after them
[1:13:05] which knew not the lord
[1:13:07] nor yet the works which he had done for
[1:13:09] israel and there's men today that
[1:13:12] they don't want you to give a testimony
[1:13:14] what god has done
[1:13:16] they look they're afraid they shy away
[1:13:17] from testifying of the power and the
[1:13:19] supernatural of god well if we don't
[1:13:22] tell how would the next generation know
[1:13:25] if we don't tell how will the next
[1:13:27] generation have faith to believe in the
[1:13:29] god that we believed in
[1:13:33] see the children of israel did evil in
[1:13:35] the sight of the lord and they served
[1:13:36] balaam and they forsook the lord god of
[1:13:38] their fathers and brought them out of
[1:13:40] the land of egypt and they followed
[1:13:41] other gods the gods of the people that
[1:13:43] were round about them and they bow
[1:13:44] themselves unto them and provoke the
[1:13:47] lord to anger verse 13 and they forsook
[1:13:50] the lord and served baal and ashtaroth
[1:13:52] and the anger of the lord was hot
[1:13:54] against israel and he delivered them
[1:13:56] into the hands of the spoilers that
[1:13:58] spoiled them and he sold them into the
[1:14:00] hands of their enemies round about so
[1:14:02] that they could not any longer stand
[1:14:04] before their enemies
[1:14:05] so they were living below what god had
[1:14:07] promised them
[1:14:08] god had given them a land god had given
[1:14:10] them a promise that they would be
[1:14:12] fruitful that he will bless their
[1:14:15] land he would bless their cattle he
[1:14:17] would bless they would not be barren in
[1:14:19] that land there would not be
[1:14:20] miscarriages in that land or abortions
[1:14:22] in that land but you would be fruitful
[1:14:24] and multiply in that land
[1:14:27] in that promise and after joshua and the
[1:14:29] men who served with joshua that outlived
[1:14:32] him when they all died and went off the
[1:14:34] scene then the children of israel began
[1:14:37] to flirt with the gods of the nations
[1:14:39] that they were sent to be to take
[1:14:41] captive of
[1:14:42] or to destroy
[1:14:44] they forsook the lord and they went
[1:14:46] whoring after the gods of the nations
[1:14:48] that they were to conquer and the
[1:14:50] prophet of god will tell us he said the
[1:14:52] church has been in the minority it's
[1:14:54] always been it will always be in
[1:14:56] memories until jesus comes he says but
[1:14:58] it's living on under its god give him
[1:15:01] privileges if we only knew this is the
[1:15:04] church of the living god not branham
[1:15:05] tabernacle for the branham tabernacle
[1:15:07] just part of it there's other
[1:15:09] such tabernacles through the country now
[1:15:11] we find here and there's many such
[1:15:13] churches throughout the country but
[1:15:15] we're all living seem like on a defeated
[1:15:18] side more or less i heard brother
[1:15:19] neville announced this morning back
[1:15:21] there that it kind of come to my mind
[1:15:23] that the people are seemingly are
[1:15:25] getting away from deliverances it seems
[1:15:27] that to be something that the people
[1:15:29] seem to just push off out to one side oh
[1:15:31] well god can do it but it's just he goes
[1:15:34] but that's just not the attitude
[1:15:37] so we find here and we think well
[1:15:39] brother joe we're in the messes and you
[1:15:41] know we're not living it even like
[1:15:42] tabernacle we're not living underneath
[1:15:43] our god-given privileges but you go
[1:15:45] travel to church to church and other
[1:15:47] churches and you come and acquaint us
[1:15:49] with other ministries and some of those
[1:15:50] ministries don't believe the same way
[1:15:52] some of those churches don't have the
[1:15:54] same freedom by which you're able to
[1:15:56] worship the lord tonight and you find
[1:15:58] people are living below their god-given
[1:16:00] privileges and like the prophet that god
[1:16:02] will say here seems like people are
[1:16:04] giving away from deliverance's message
[1:16:06] oh they got the great deep intellectual
[1:16:08] knowledge of the word but where is the
[1:16:11] people where is the deliverance where's
[1:16:13] the young people in the church where's
[1:16:14] the fire in the church where's the
[1:16:16] supernatural in the church i believe in
[1:16:18] preaching on the deep things of god we
[1:16:20] need that to lift us up into a heavenly
[1:16:22] atmosphere but we also need a god that
[1:16:24] delivers a god that sets free a god
[1:16:27] that's still healed a god that still
[1:16:29] moves we still need to preach of god
[1:16:31] that delivers
[1:16:33] he's delivering esa and he's here to
[1:16:35] deliver you tonight he's the same god
[1:16:38] church
[1:16:39] oh i want the deep things of god but i
[1:16:41] want the simplicity of the word i want
[1:16:43] the simplicity of a god that destroys
[1:16:46] cancer and heals sugar diabetes and
[1:16:48] removes heart trouble and cures us sick
[1:16:51] when the doctors can't find it i got a
[1:16:54] god that knows the answer he does
[1:16:56] impossible math
[1:17:04] notice
[1:17:05] brother branham will say this
[1:17:07] said brother joe you're just preaching
[1:17:09] you're just getting onto it because not
[1:17:11] everybody believes the way we believe
[1:17:13] that's how let's see how prophet would
[1:17:15] say it
[1:17:16] 1957 here you him some of we ministers
[1:17:20] we should be ashamed of ourselves
[1:17:22] as we keep our congregation
[1:17:24] way below their privileges
[1:17:29] somehow we ministers
[1:17:32] we should be ashamed of ourselves
[1:17:34] because we keep our congregation way
[1:17:37] below their privileges the whole
[1:17:39] christian church today is living
[1:17:41] thousands of miles below their god-given
[1:17:44] privileges because of just so half
[1:17:47] asleep dismal life take the promise
[1:17:49] bullet they're gonna take the promise
[1:17:51] and believe it god said god said so that
[1:17:53] settles it forever he says no matter how
[1:17:55] long it takes to materialize he said
[1:17:57] time doesn't mean nothing to god
[1:18:01] see
[1:18:02] it's his word that we take and we
[1:18:05] believe abraham waited 25 years for that
[1:18:07] child to come but it arrived
[1:18:10] and you may have may have waited a long
[1:18:12] time for your promise to come but i want
[1:18:14] you to know your promises in the room
[1:18:17] your miracle's in the room tonight
[1:18:19] you ain't got to wait another long a
[1:18:21] minute longer oh brother andrew you had
[1:18:24] a promise
[1:18:25] it took seven years something like that
[1:18:26] to manifest but when when a man of god
[1:18:29] came by and said it's on this road it's
[1:18:31] on its way
[1:18:33] oh he didn't just shove it off he
[1:18:35] occupied the promise
[1:18:37] god came by god was so mindful to stop
[1:18:40] by him
[1:18:42] see there's still a spirit of
[1:18:43] discernment that still moves in the
[1:18:44] church today there's still a spirit of
[1:18:46] prophecy maybe not the major prophet but
[1:18:48] they're still gifts of prophecy that
[1:18:50] moves in the church to be able to tell
[1:18:52] you what your needs are god still moves
[1:18:54] sure don't put him in a box
[1:18:57] it's part of the promise
[1:18:59] and i'm glad that we can be associated
[1:19:01] with men of god that can yield their
[1:19:03] gift to that level because it's not for
[1:19:05] that man but it's for the body god knew
[1:19:07] you got a need and god sent a man your
[1:19:09] way and he spoke that need and what we
[1:19:12] saw little drew he saw him in a vision
[1:19:14] what did god do that vision came to pass
[1:19:16] didn't it
[1:19:18] he's still god
[1:19:20] but you got to be the one that occupies
[1:19:22] that promise
[1:19:24] see god started his church
[1:19:27] the way he wanted it
[1:19:29] god started his church not man god
[1:19:32] started his church the way he wanted it
[1:19:34] and now today he wants his church the
[1:19:37] way he started it
[1:19:40] well brother joe you mean we got to get
[1:19:42] in an upper room if you plan on being
[1:19:44] like the first church
[1:19:46] so how did he start an in and out room
[1:19:48] all in one accord and all of a sudden
[1:19:50] tongues of fire began to descend and
[1:19:52] they were all sat real quiet
[1:19:55] and they began to nod and there wasn't a
[1:19:58] voice heard everybody was just as quiet
[1:20:00] because they were scared the preacher
[1:20:02] may say something and call them out
[1:20:03] because they got a little emotional
[1:20:07] a little fanatical
[1:20:10] no that ain't how my bible reads the
[1:20:12] bible says when those tongues of fire
[1:20:14] begin to fall they all in one accord
[1:20:17] begin to what they begin to speak in an
[1:20:19] unknown language they begin to get
[1:20:21] beyond the realm of their humanity they
[1:20:24] begin to get outside the borders of
[1:20:25] their flesh and they begin to worship
[1:20:27] god and the presence of god came down
[1:20:30] and they staggered out oh my god they
[1:20:32] staggered out like drunk men let me tell
[1:20:34] you if you don't just act like you're
[1:20:36] drunk you come to the house of god get
[1:20:38] dropped on the holy ghost get drunk on
[1:20:40] the water stimulation get drunk from the
[1:20:42] presence of god it's okay it tastes good
[1:20:46] my brother i don't want to act like that
[1:20:48] well you gotta act like you have to get
[1:20:50] back to the original church
[1:20:57] god won't see his church on fire
[1:21:01] don't paint him a fire create him a fire
[1:21:07] do you know that god created a fire in
[1:21:10] babylon
[1:21:11] he heated that thing up seven times
[1:21:14] hotter than it ever been hit before
[1:21:16] because he desired fellowship
[1:21:19] he had three young boys down there who

[1:26:52] but it came to pass that the children of
[1:26:54] israel asked the lord saying who shall
[1:26:56] go up for us against the canaanites
[1:26:58] first to fight against them and the lord
[1:27:00] said unto judah said judah shall go up
[1:27:03] behold i have delivered the land into
[1:27:05] thy hand

[1:27:23] he has given you a promise a total
[1:27:26] victory
[1:27:29] i've given it to you i
[1:27:31] have given the land into your hand and
[1:27:34] judah said unto simi and his brother
[1:27:36] come up with me unto my lot that we may
[1:27:38] fight against the canaanites and i
[1:27:39] likewise will go with thee into thy lot
[1:27:42] so see me and with him verse 17 and
[1:27:44] judah would with sema and his brother
[1:27:46] and they flew the canaanites that
[1:27:47] inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed
[1:27:49] it and the name of the cd was called
[1:27:52] horma
[1:27:53] verse 19.
[1:27:55] and the lord was with judah
[1:27:57] and he
[1:27:58] drave out the inhabitants of the
[1:28:00] mountain
[1:28:01] but he could not drive out the
[1:28:04] inhabitants of the valley because they
[1:28:06] had chairs of iron
[1:28:08] verse 21
[1:28:10] and the children of benjamin did not
[1:28:12] drive out the jebusites that inhabited
[1:28:13] jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with
[1:28:16] the children of benjamin in jerusalem
[1:28:18] until this day
[1:28:19] verse 27.
[1:28:21] neither did malassa drive out the
[1:28:23] inhabitants of machine in her towns

[1:28:41] inhabitants of ketron nor then heavens
[1:28:43] and nahol neither did verse 31 neither
[1:28:46] did asher drive out they didn't have us
[1:28:47] an acor nor then have a society or a lab
[1:28:50] or the accident nor of hellbar or effect
[1:28:54] or rahorb in verse 33 neither did
[1:28:56] naphtali drive out in heaven it's the
[1:28:58] best shemesh nor the inhabitants of
[1:29:00] batana

[1:29:02] canaanites or but he dwelts among the
[1:29:04] canaanites and the inhabitants of the
[1:29:05] lamb nevertheless the inhabitants of
[1:29:06] besh and bethana
[1:29:08] became tributaries unto them and the
[1:29:11] amorites forced the children of dan into
[1:29:13] the mountain for they would not suffer
[1:29:15] them to come down to the valley

[1:29:35] going to do through moses he reiterated
[1:29:37] what he was going through through joshua
[1:29:38] he declared that he would give them the
[1:29:40] land and he would only he would not only
[1:29:42] deliver them through the lamb but he was
[1:29:44] going to give them a land which they did
[1:29:46] not labor cities which they did not
[1:29:48] build and they would dwell in them and
[1:29:50] their vineyards and olives and they
[1:29:52] would give them all these things that
[1:29:53] they didn't plan all that they had to do
[1:29:55] was go and drive out the inhabitants of
[1:29:57] the land
[1:29:59] god had promised him the land he had
