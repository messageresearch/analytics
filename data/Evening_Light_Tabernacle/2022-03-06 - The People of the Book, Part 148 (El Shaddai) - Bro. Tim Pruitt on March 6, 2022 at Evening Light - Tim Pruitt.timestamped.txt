[52:53] i mean feel alive now
[52:55] all right well let's just respond to the
[52:57] things of god today
[52:59] let's turn to as i said to genesis 17
[53:02] we'll read from verse one
[53:04] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[53:09] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[53:11] him i am the almighty god
[53:14] walk before me and be thou perfect
[53:17] and i will make
[53:19] my covenant between
[53:20] me and thee and will multiply thee
[53:23] exceededly
[53:24] and abram fell on his face and god
[53:26] talked with him saying as for me behold
[53:28] my covenant is with thee
[53:31] and thou shalt be a father of many
[53:33] nations
[53:35] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[53:37] abram but thy name shall be abraham
[53:41] for a father of many nations have i made
[53:44] thee and i will make thee exceeding
[53:46] fruitful and i will make nations of thee
[53:50] and kings shall come out of thee
[53:52] and i will establish my covenant between
[53:55] me and thee and i seed after thee and
[53:58] their generations for
[54:00] an everlasting covenant
[54:02] to be a god unto thee and to thy seed
[54:05] after thee
[54:07] and i will give unto thee and to thy
[54:09] seed after thee the lamb were in thou
[54:12] art a stranger
[54:14] all the land of canaan for an
[54:17] everlasting possession
[54:19] and i will be their god
[54:21] and god said unto abraham thou shalt
[54:24] keep my covenant therefore
[54:26] thou and thy seed after thee and their
[54:28] generations
[54:30] this is my covenant which ye shall keep
[54:33] between me and you and thy seed even
[54:37] after thee every man
[54:39] child among you shall be circumcised and
[54:42] you shall circumcise the flesh of your
[54:44] foreskin and it shall be a token
[54:47] of the covenant betwixt me and you
[54:50] and he that is 88 days old it shall be
[54:54] circumcised among you every man child in
[54:57] your generations he that is born in the
[55:00] house
[55:01] are bought with money of a stranger
[55:03] which is not thy seed
[55:05] he that is born in thy house and he that
[55:07] is bought with thy money must needs be
[55:09] circumcised
[55:11] and my covenant shall be in your flesh
[55:13] for an everlasting covenant
[55:15] and the uncircumcised man-child whose
[55:18] flesh
[55:19] of his foreskin is not circumcised that
[55:22] soul shall be cut off from his people he
[55:25] hath broken my covenant
[55:27] and god said unto abraham as for sarah
[55:30] thy wife
[55:31] thou shalt not call her name sarai but
[55:34] sarah shall her name be
[55:37] and i will bless her and give thee a son
[55:39] also of her yea
[55:41] i will bless her and she shall be a
[55:43] mother of nations kings of people shall
[55:46] be of her then abraham fell upon his
[55:49] face and laughed and said in his heart
[55:53] shall a child be born unto him that is a
[55:55] hundred years old and shall sarah that
[55:58] is ninety-year-old old bear
[56:00] and abraham said unto god
[56:02] all that ishmael might live before thee
[56:05] and god said sarah thy wife shall bear
[56:08] thee a son indeed and thou shalt call
[56:11] his name isaac
[56:13] and i will establish my covenant with
[56:15] him for an everlasting covenant and with
[56:18] his seed after him and as for ishmael i
[56:21] have heard thee
[56:23] behold i have blessed him and will make
[56:25] him fruitful and will multiply him
[56:28] exceedingly twelve princes shall he
[56:30] beget and i will make him a great nation
[56:33] but my covenant will i establish
[56:36] with isaac which sarah shall bear unto
[56:39] thee at this set time in the next year
[56:42] and he left off talking with him and god
[56:45] went up from abraham
[56:47] may god bless you you can be seated
[56:50] amen thank you brother johnny
[56:54] god bless you church today as we
[56:57] look into the promises of the word of
[56:59] the lord and
[57:00] you know i was speaking in my last
[57:02] sermon here which was a couple of weeks
[57:04] ago
[57:06] about this being the age of pentecost
[57:08] and i was speaking of the returning to
[57:12] the original grain as it was on the day
[57:15] of pentecost you know god planted a seed
[57:18] there at pentecost and he's bringing
[57:20] forth a harvest
[57:22] in this last day
[57:24] now i was not speaking of azusa street
[57:26] um brother branham has said
[57:28] of them but this is another age this is
[57:31] a calling out of the bride not two
[57:34] thousand years ago at pentecost for the
[57:36] repeated return
[57:38] then he would say this is not the day of
[57:40] pentecost the pentecostal age is passed
[57:42] pentecost is gone this is a harvest time
[57:46] and and again in the church age book he
[57:49] would he would give this thought the
[57:51] lutheran age was springtime the westland
[57:54] age was the summer of growth
[57:56] the laodicean age is the harvest of the
[57:59] and the gathering of tares for the
[58:01] burning and binding and burning and the
[58:04] garnering of the wheat for the lord so
[58:07] if you'll notice in this last age there
[58:10] is a
[58:12] there is a gathering that takes place a
[58:14] harvest time
[58:15] and we are in a very great harvest
[58:18] season right now
[58:20] as um everything comes to
[58:23] its height
[58:24] um you see sin reaching its height it
[58:28] does it like it did
[58:29] also in the book of genesis and
[58:31] abraham's time
[58:33] where that the sins of sodom reached its
[58:36] height until
[58:38] god heard it in the heavens
[58:40] and we we know again in the book of
[58:42] revelation that the sins again
[58:45] reach until
[58:47] the the um sins are heard in the heavens
[58:51] and so you see everything comes to its
[58:54] harvest season
[58:56] and in this harvest season
[58:58] um
[58:59] you know there is the gathering it will
[59:02] be the gathering of the tares jesus
[59:04] would use this
[59:06] um parable because it would be
[59:09] the wheat sowed the grain sowed the good
[59:12] seed by the son of man and then there
[59:15] would be the tares that would be sung by
[59:17] the wicked one
[59:18] and so there would be a binding and a
[59:21] burning of the tares and then a
[59:23] garnering of the wheat and to the
[59:27] for the lord so as you as you look at
[59:29] this a garnering simply means to gather
[59:32] into the barn
[59:34] and and so it speaks of a a rapture it's
[59:38] not a planting time again
[59:41] but it is a harvest time where is
[59:43] carried into
[59:45] the barn
[59:46] so it's not a receding so you know we we
[59:49] would see the different things for
[59:51] example um you you see the dying of
[59:55] luther as the life would move from the
[1:00:00] from the stark into the tussle the dine
[1:00:03] of luther brought forth wesley and then
[1:00:05] the dying of wesley brought forth um the
[1:00:08] asus movement and then the the dying of
[1:00:12] the azusa movement brings forth the
[1:00:14] message now
[1:00:16] all the life goes into the grain for the
[1:00:20] harvest
[1:00:21] this is a time where
[1:00:23] where um
[1:00:24] you know where that everything reaches
[1:00:27] its place of maturity but being you know
[1:00:31] that being said don't forget what the
[1:00:33] church had at pentecost is her
[1:00:36] inalienable right
[1:00:39] originally she had the pure word of god
[1:00:41] and she had the power of the spirit
[1:00:43] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:00:46] and gifts of the spirit and that is our
[1:00:48] inalienable rights
[1:00:51] and so thus what the church was at
[1:00:53] pentecost is the standard
[1:00:56] so that is the pattern there is no other
[1:00:59] pattern
[1:01:00] no matter what scholars say god has not
[1:01:02] changed that pattern what god did at
[1:01:05] pentecost he has to keep on doing until
[1:01:08] the church ages in and those scholars
[1:01:10] may tell you that the apostolic age is
[1:01:12] over don't you ever believe it
[1:01:15] amen this is a point that brother
[1:01:18] branham would defend over and over and
[1:01:20] over again
[1:01:21] that um the apostolic age was continuing
[1:01:25] on and would never cease until the last
[1:01:27] one was saved
[1:01:29] and and so mark 16 would still be in
[1:01:32] effect these signs will follow them that
[1:01:34] believe
[1:01:36] so again you know we we're at a time
[1:01:39] where all of the types are being
[1:01:42] fulfilled even
[1:01:43] even what happened on the day of
[1:01:44] pentecost 2 000 years ago was projecting
[1:01:48] of another pentecost
[1:01:50] and we're not referring another to azusa
[1:01:53] street where we're referring to this
[1:01:56] last day move of god
[1:01:59] and remember in that day the day of
[1:02:01] pentecost had fully come and that meant
[1:02:03] that the seven weeks from the passover
[1:02:06] had been fulfilled and now it had fully
[1:02:09] come the feast of weeks had given away
[1:02:11] and from from the 49th day into the 50th
[1:02:14] which was pentecost and when the day of
[1:02:17] pentecost fully came the the spirit of
[1:02:19] god came down from heaven with a mighty
[1:02:23] rushing wind
[1:02:24] and there it filled the house where they
[1:02:26] were sitting and and they were filled
[1:02:29] with the holy ghost and there the the
[1:02:32] pillar of fire would give birth as
[1:02:34] cloven tongues like fire would come and
[1:02:37] now it wasn't just the fullness of god
[1:02:41] in the man christ jesus but now his
[1:02:44] fullness would be
[1:02:45] experienced in a bright body
[1:02:48] and so again you know we are we're now
[1:02:52] aware that the day of pentecost has
[1:02:54] fully come we have come through seven
[1:02:56] weeks or seven church ages
[1:02:59] and we are now
[1:03:01] here at the fulfillment of all the
[1:03:03] scriptures that have been pointing to
[1:03:05] this time
[1:03:07] so again again now the day of pentecost
[1:03:10] has truly fully come
[1:03:12] and it comes with a harvest again
[1:03:15] it comes with the waving of a sheath it
[1:03:18] comes with a celebration of
[1:03:21] the what god has done in his in his
[1:03:24] stages of redemption
[1:03:27] so again this is where we are here now
[1:03:30] at the final jubilee
[1:03:33] it is where that god empties out his
[1:03:36] spirit
[1:03:37] and pours it out upon all flesh
[1:03:41] now as we are seeing this the the day of
[1:03:44] pentecost brother branham would say the
[1:03:46] spirit of god directed it into that joel
[1:03:49] 2 28 and the day of luther directed into
[1:03:52] that which was justification and wesley
[1:03:56] directed into the holiness movement
[1:03:58] we'll speak about that here in a moment
[1:04:00] but this is another age this is the
[1:04:03] calling out of the bride
[1:04:06] amen not 2 000 years ago at pentecost
[1:04:09] for the repeat or even the returns you
[1:04:12] see we're not repeating pentecost of 2
[1:04:15] 000 years ago
[1:04:16] because that was the church being
[1:04:18] planted
[1:04:20] as a corn of wheat and it would go down
[1:04:22] through persecution and dying out
[1:04:24] through the dark ages and would come up
[1:04:26] again
[1:04:28] with luther there uh like a blade of
[1:04:30] wheat doesn't look nothing like the
[1:04:32] grain
[1:04:33] doesn't look like the seed that was but
[1:04:35] it was still the the life that was in
[1:04:37] the grain now manifested in another form
[1:04:40] it's not ready for the harvest it's a
[1:04:43] young tender blade and then you know if
[1:04:45] you if you cut it now if you harvest it
[1:04:48] now you just got hay
[1:04:50] right amen you don't have the original
[1:04:53] grain again
[1:04:54] but again it keeps on moving from that
[1:04:56] and it progresses until it becomes like
[1:05:00] like the growth of the wheat and we'll
[1:05:01] read the bible for this in a moment but
[1:05:04] you know like the growth of the weed
[1:05:05] it'll come into the next stage from the
[1:05:08] blade to the torso which would be john
[1:05:11] wesley and the movement of the holy
[1:05:13] spirit of god uh again in the the
[1:05:16] methodist revival and the and the
[1:05:19] holiness revival it was branch out into
[1:05:21] the nazarenes and the pilgrim holiness
[1:05:24] and and other other moves of god and and
[1:05:27] then and then that that would again you
[1:05:30] know the life would leave that and be
[1:05:32] pushed on into the into another stage
[1:05:35] and that other stage would be a shuck
[1:05:37] and that chuck would look exactly like
[1:05:39] the original grain but it wasn't grain
[1:05:43] it's kind of like going out and
[1:05:45] harvesting your sweet corn and you see
[1:05:48] it it's got a it's got a beautiful ear
[1:05:50] of corn and you go and you pull it back
[1:05:53] and all you've got is little bitty tiny
[1:05:56] grains that you can't eat a white cob
[1:05:59] right it's not harvest time
[1:06:02] amen but it looks it looks like
[1:06:05] it looks like it would have grain in it
[1:06:08] but it doesn't have grain yet
[1:06:10] then it puts on the full ear so you see
[1:06:14] we are not repeating pentecostal 2 000
[1:06:17] years ago because thank god we're not
[1:06:19] going to be planted and we're not going
[1:06:22] to go to 2 000 more years of church ages
[1:06:26] and man you know the weeks are over here
[1:06:29] the tights have run out
[1:06:31] so you see
[1:06:33] we
[1:06:33] we again we're not repeating that
[1:06:36] because this is where it is the harvest
[1:06:39] time and it goes into the corner of this
[1:06:42] storehouse and i want to say neither are
[1:06:45] we trying to uh are attempting to try to
[1:06:48] reproduce a souza street movement
[1:06:52] because they were the shock
[1:06:54] now so again it wasn't a rapture age but
[1:06:58] we are in a rapture rate
[1:07:01] this is age of the fulfillment of all
[1:07:03] scriptures
[1:07:05] and so it's very important for us to
[1:07:07] understand
[1:07:08] you know again where we are in time
[1:07:12] and what god is doing in this hour
[1:07:15] to be a part of the move of god not it
[1:07:18] not in the dried dead
[1:07:20] parts of the plant before though god
[1:07:22] used to move there
[1:07:24] but god's not moving there his advanced
[1:07:27] beyond that
[1:07:29] now so the church has come up like a
[1:07:31] gray that we planted on the day of
[1:07:33] pentecost and is now back to the grain
[1:07:35] again and this time to be taken into the
[1:07:38] garner and or be raptured
[1:07:41] now so the the kingdom of god is like a
[1:07:44] seed jesus said now you say well brother
[1:07:47] tim i need scripture for where you're
[1:07:49] placing this well i'll i'll just go to
[1:07:51] mark chapter 4 and verse 26 and we're
[1:07:54] going to read this together today and he
[1:07:56] said so is the kingdom of god as if a
[1:08:00] man should cast seed into the ground
[1:08:04] and he should sleep and should rise day
[1:08:06] and night and the seeds will spring and
[1:08:09] grow up he knoweth not how
[1:08:12] for the earth bringeth forth the fruit
[1:08:15] of herself first the blade then the ear
[1:08:19] and after that the full cord in the ear
[1:08:22] but when the fruit is brought forth
[1:08:24] immediately he putteth in the sickle
[1:08:28] because harvest is come
[1:08:31] so you see when it comes back to grain
[1:08:33] again you know it's harvest time
[1:08:36] you know the sickle is about to be put
[1:08:38] in the field and there's going to be a
[1:08:40] reaping
[1:08:42] you see whatever was sowed has got to be
[1:08:44] reaped
[1:08:45] so the sins that were sowed before and
[1:08:48] the sins of sodom reach the sodom
[1:08:51] harvest
[1:08:52] amen this is why that we're seeing this
[1:08:55] is because the seeds were sung
[1:08:58] and yet yet again when you when you look
[1:09:00] and you see the other other things
[1:09:03] coming up the tears among the wheat then
[1:09:06] you know the wheat had to
[1:09:07] or the the terror had to grow until the
[1:09:10] harvest time and then the harvest time
[1:09:12] there would come a separation
[1:09:14] so we're in a time where god is
[1:09:16] separating a people to himself back to
[1:09:20] the word again
[1:09:22] that's why we're here this morning so
[1:09:24] the bible is saying jesus said it comes
[1:09:26] to the seed the blade the ear the full
[1:09:30] corn in the ear now that's where the
[1:09:32] full word is born into manifestation
[1:09:36] you see we we've had a bible now that
[1:09:39] has been given to us um since the days
[1:09:42] of luther you say since the days of
[1:09:44] luther yes before that they were in the
[1:09:46] cloisters of rome and nobody got to read
[1:09:49] the bible nobody had the word of god and
[1:09:52] if they did you had to be trained in
[1:09:54] either greek or it was translated into
[1:09:56] latin so if you didn't know greek or
[1:09:58] latin you were still you know out
[1:10:00] you can look at the words but you don't
[1:10:02] know what they mean
[1:10:03] but then luther would bring us a bible
[1:10:06] and we've had the bible now for years
[1:10:09] but because of the lack of the word
[1:10:12] being there then all kinds of
[1:10:14] misconceptions
[1:10:16] had come and clouded over the word and
[1:10:19] many of these traditions were brought
[1:10:21] off
[1:10:22] brought over from rome where they had
[1:10:25] distinguished the word of god the bible
[1:10:27] the bible is not even known among the
[1:10:30] people and so they they had kept the
[1:10:32] truths up down and they it was now
[1:10:34] whatever the church said and whatever
[1:10:36] the church believed and what if the
[1:10:37] church wanted you to believe so again
[1:10:40] you know god would start a process of
[1:10:43] restoration
[1:10:44] i'm trying to make this as simple as i
[1:10:46] know how for every person here
[1:10:49] but now so this it comes finally to
[1:10:52] where the full word as it comes
[1:10:55] partially revealed back in luther with
[1:10:58] wesley and then azusa street but there
[1:11:01] has to come a time where the full word
[1:11:04] of god is born
[1:11:06] into manifestation
[1:11:08] now it'll be out of this full word that
[1:11:11] full sons come
[1:11:13] amen that adopted son men who know their
[1:11:16] god
[1:11:18] come out of that full word they're born
[1:11:20] of that word
[1:11:22] it's not a partial truth it's the whole
[1:11:24] truth
[1:11:25] amen and it comes down to full
[1:11:28] redemption
[1:11:29] this is what seven angels in the cloud
[1:11:32] represented there that all the seven
[1:11:34] ages were finished and the word of god
[1:11:37] was being revealed
[1:11:39] amen because now we don't have this one
[1:11:41] age we have every truth of the ages
[1:11:44] coming down into a single message as
[1:11:48] brother branham would often say i'm
[1:11:50] i'm i'm taking and i'm i'm i'm the tying
[1:11:54] to loose ends together this shred of
[1:11:56] truth that luther had and the shred that
[1:11:58] wesley had and the thread that azusa
[1:12:01] street had the sweat that all these
[1:12:03] others had and i'm taking all these
[1:12:05] strands of truth and i'm weaving them
[1:12:07] into one message
[1:12:10] amen so you could have the flower to
[1:12:12] claw and out of that full word of god
[1:12:15] would be a people that would be born of
[1:12:17] that word
[1:12:19] amen
[1:12:19] amen of people who would know their god
[1:12:23] they might know his truth know him in
[1:12:25] all of his reality
[1:12:27] i mean those people would do exploits
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:36] now
[1:12:39] i've come to that point right there
[1:12:43] for us to go back
[1:12:45] to the life of abraham for a moment
[1:12:48] and i'm going to just use some of that
[1:12:50] this morning i don't know how much i'll
[1:12:52] get to this today
[1:12:54] but we'll just follow as the holy spirit
[1:12:56] moves
[1:12:57] but i want to come back to the prophecy
[1:12:59] of abraham you say prophecy of abraham
[1:13:01] yes
[1:13:03] it is prophetical
[1:13:05] it's more than a book of history is more
[1:13:07] than just um you know the
[1:13:10] the father of the jews
[1:13:12] abraham is our father
[1:13:16] and i want you to know he is our father
[1:13:18] because from him came christ
[1:13:21] the royal seed and out of him we are
[1:13:24] born
[1:13:26] so we who were outside of that covenant
[1:13:29] have received another covenant and we
[1:13:32] have been brought into a covenant with
[1:13:34] christ now when we look back here we are
[1:13:37] looking at a man that is absolutely in
[1:13:39] his life prophesying our day our
[1:13:43] our time
[1:13:45] and this is why brother branham would
[1:13:46] often go in his sermons to to abraham
[1:13:50] over and over and over again because
[1:13:52] abraham was speaking
[1:13:54] of us
[1:13:56] as he said in christ the mystery of god
[1:13:58] revealed he said these men were
[1:14:00] prophesying now they didn't know they
[1:14:02] were prophesying you know abraham didn't
[1:14:04] say now i'll tell you what i'm going to
[1:14:06] do i'm going to go up and offer my son
[1:14:08] isaac because i'm prophesying that
[1:14:10] there's a seed coming and so i'm gonna
[1:14:13] i'm gonna go through this act and i'm
[1:14:15] gonna pretend that it was not pretending
[1:14:20] you see abraham was told to do something
[1:14:23] because he would be prophesying now
[1:14:26] are you with me he'd be prophesying
[1:14:29] about the coming of the seed
[1:14:33] and and so it would be it would be
[1:14:36] abraham that god would use to foreshadow
[1:14:39] you coming you had to be written in the
[1:14:42] bible
[1:14:43] and you're going to have to see the
[1:14:44] bible is more than just a book you've
[1:14:47] got to see it as prophesying of you
[1:14:52] you know you'll never get healed unless
[1:14:54] you see the word is personally talking
[1:14:57] to you
[1:14:59] we can preach it all you want to but
[1:15:00] until it becomes your personal
[1:15:02] revelation
[1:15:03] your faith will never be elevated to
[1:15:05] receive it
[1:15:07] but it's got to be brought to where that
[1:15:09] you see yourself in the promise
[1:15:12] now so coming back to the prophecy of
[1:15:15] abraham he actually comes through
[1:15:17] different stations where he experienced
[1:15:20] god and as he journeyed as he walked
[1:15:23] through the promised land
[1:15:25] now as god dealt with abraham so does he
[1:15:29] deal with his seed and we are abraham
[1:15:32] seed
[1:15:33] now let's establish that because what
[1:15:36] does this have to do what i read about
[1:15:38] abraham have to do with us today
[1:15:41] well let's look in the bible and see
[1:15:43] what he has to do
[1:15:44] galatians chapter 3 in verse 16
[1:15:47] now to abraham and his seed were the
[1:15:50] promises me so i want you to give to
[1:15:53] abraham and his seed
[1:15:56] say it with me abraham
[1:15:59] and his seed
[1:16:01] all right it wasn't just given to
[1:16:02] abraham
[1:16:03] it's given to abraham and his seed
[1:16:07] all right
[1:16:08] he saith not
[1:16:10] and to seeds plural
[1:16:14] he didn't say i've given to abraham and
[1:16:16] his seeds
[1:16:18] as many but as a one
[1:16:20] and to that seed which is christ
[1:16:23] so all the promises were speaking of
[1:16:27] christ
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:31] now if you're not born of christ you're
[1:16:34] not going to be a recipient of abraham's
[1:16:37] promises
[1:16:40] now then let's look at down at verse 29
[1:16:43] and if you be
[1:16:44] christ how many belong to christ then
[1:16:48] you are abraham's seed
[1:16:51] and heirs according to the promise
[1:16:54] so now if you belong to christ you're
[1:16:57] abraham's seed amen you can look at your
[1:17:00] neighbor and say i'm seated of abraham
[1:17:03] amen so because of being abraham's seed
[1:17:07] i'm heirs to the promise
[1:17:12] amen i am ash to everything that abraham
[1:17:16] had
[1:17:17] so when we look back at abraham he is
[1:17:20] prophesying of his seed
[1:17:23] and the blessing that will come on his
[1:17:25] seat amen
[1:17:27] now
[1:17:28] first of all abram was found by god in
[1:17:32] the era of the child of the uh
[1:17:34] in arab chaldea
[1:17:36] a gentile he was a heathen a worshipers
[1:17:40] of idols and i want you to get this
[1:17:43] god sought him out
[1:17:49] [Applause]
[1:17:51] he was like everybody else
[1:17:53] a worldly sinner bound for hell like
[1:17:57] everybody else
[1:17:59] but god sought him out
[1:18:03] hallelujah that ought to make you shout
[1:18:05] this morning
[1:18:06] oh man it wasn't nothing he did it
[1:18:08] wasn't how good he was
[1:18:10] amen it was god called him god
[1:18:13] predestinated god ordained him
[1:18:20] hallelujah
[1:18:22] amen god sought him
[1:18:25] god called him
[1:18:27] i want you to know salvation is of the
[1:18:29] lord it ain't out of you it ain't your
[1:18:31] desire it ain't your good work it is god
[1:18:34] that dropped you it is god that called
[1:18:37] you it's god that predestinated you it's
[1:18:40] god that said i have a rapture for you
[1:18:49] i need a little more sound up here
[1:18:51] now
[1:18:52] abram
[1:18:54] was found by god a gentile
[1:18:57] heathen
[1:18:58] he didn't know how to worship
[1:19:00] he didn't know how many gods there were
[1:19:03] there were multiple of gods that was
[1:19:05] idle idolatry everything else he was a
[1:19:08] man just like the others going about his
[1:19:10] business and one day god appeared to him
[1:19:16] sometimes it takes a long time for god
[1:19:19] to appear to him
[1:19:21] sometimes a man can be up in his 80s for
[1:19:23] god appears to him but god appears
[1:19:27] he's not going to lose one of his own
[1:19:29] amen it might have been are you with me
[1:19:31] now if you may have been going along a
[1:19:34] long time and it seemed like it's been a
[1:19:36] real drought but let me tell you god
[1:19:38] will appear
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:43] and then i want you to notice
[1:19:46] in verse chapter 12 and verse 1
[1:19:49] the lord had said to abraham get thee
[1:19:50] out of thy country
[1:19:52] and from thy kindred and from thy
[1:19:55] father's house and to the land that i
[1:19:56] will show you now if you're going
[1:20:00] if you you see i've called you but i've
[1:20:02] not called you to remain where you are
[1:20:07] i have not called you to remain in your
[1:20:09] sins
[1:20:11] i have not called you to remain a
[1:20:12] heathen
[1:20:14] i have not called you to to still be an
[1:20:17] idolatry and worshipping other idols
[1:20:21] or idols
[1:20:26] i didn't call you to stay where you're
[1:20:28] at
[1:20:29] god
[1:20:30] if you don't get anything out of this
[1:20:32] service today but this god has not
[1:20:34] called you for you to stay where you're
[1:20:37] at
[1:20:37] you cannot remain where you are
[1:20:41] there has to be a growth in your life
[1:20:44] there has to be a progression in your
[1:20:46] life and many of you have become
[1:20:48] squatters where you're at
[1:20:54] amen
[1:20:55] and you know what abraham did or abram
[1:20:57] did when he left from there he he took
[1:21:00] it took a long lot his brother and his
[1:21:02] brother's son and tyra his his father
[1:21:06] and brought them and brought them along
[1:21:08] with them
[1:21:10] god didn't tell them to come
[1:21:13] he told abram to come he said leave that
[1:21:15] listen
[1:21:16] you see you've got to leave friends
[1:21:18] behind
[1:21:20] you've got to leave finally behind
[1:21:21] you've got to leave everything behind
[1:21:23] you're going to follow the lord you
[1:21:24] can't you can't let it try to pray all
[1:21:26] that with you
[1:21:28] people want to serve god and hang on to
[1:21:30] their old things you can't do it
[1:21:33] it's you know god's word calls for a
[1:21:35] total separation from unbelief
[1:21:39] now so he would say in in genesis 13 7
[1:21:44] arise and walk
[1:21:46] to command arise
[1:21:49] and walk
[1:21:54] you know some of you got to get up
[1:21:57] from where you're at
[1:21:59] you've been there in that place way too
[1:22:01] long you've been in that sin you've been
[1:22:03] in that wickedness you've been in that
[1:22:04] unbelief the first thing the first step
[1:22:07] is get out
[1:22:10] arise up out of there
[1:22:12] you say well i can't do it well he said
[1:22:14] you could do it
[1:22:16] if god said arise and god provides the
[1:22:19] grace
[1:22:20] and the power for you to arise
[1:22:22] [Applause]
[1:22:27] and then he said walk yeah yeah
[1:22:32] put a foot in front of you
[1:22:38] and walk through the land
[1:22:41] look i've given you a line i've given
[1:22:43] you promises
[1:22:45] but i want you to start walking through
[1:22:46] these promises i want you to see what
[1:22:49] you're what you're inheriting i'm going
[1:22:52] to give you something if there is
[1:22:54] healing and there is miracles and
[1:22:56] there's salvation in there is your
[1:22:58] children in there it is abundance and
[1:23:01] there is blessings and there is
[1:23:03] everything but i want you to get out and
[1:23:06] walk through this land
[1:23:09] and claim every bit of it as your own
[1:23:12] so you don't yet see it though you don't
[1:23:14] say i've got victory over that yet you
[1:23:17] go to claiming that victory
[1:23:20] you say i haven't seen that healing that
[1:23:22] you're going to claim in that healing i
[1:23:24] see my children come back you're going
[1:23:26] to claim those children
[1:23:29] you've got to walk through the land
[1:23:35] kind of go into the promises
[1:23:37] look in the scripture
[1:23:39] it's speaking about you
[1:23:42] it's abraham i'm giving these promises
[1:23:47] so
[1:23:49] walk through the liv the lamb genesis 13
[1:23:52] 17.
[1:23:53] walk to rise walk through the land
[1:23:56] in the length of it
[1:23:58] the breath of it
[1:23:59] for i will give it unto thee
[1:24:03] i will give it
[1:24:05] you're not going to have to work for it
[1:24:09] it's all going to be by grace
[1:24:12] my favorite
[1:24:18] i want you to get that thought my favor
[1:24:22] my grace is great upon you
[1:24:25] you are highly favored of the law
[1:24:31] now we've got to walk through the land
[1:24:33] of god's promises and see what's in it
[1:24:36] we've got to experience the wonders of
[1:24:38] it
[1:24:39] and in every place digital well and
[1:24:42] build an altar
[1:24:45] hallelujah in every place
[1:24:48] are you with me you dig it well and you
[1:24:51] build an altar
[1:24:54] amen why the well you gotta have the
[1:24:56] water of the spirit
[1:24:58] you've got to have the holy ghost moving
[1:25:00] upon you
[1:25:02] you've got to have a refreshing from the
[1:25:03] presence of the lord and that will cause
[1:25:06] you to build an altar
[1:25:09] and worship
[1:25:10] god amen
[1:25:13] all right
[1:25:14] now
[1:25:16] but don't stop there
[1:25:19] these are stations
[1:25:21] there's more of the land
[1:25:23] to
[1:25:24] discover that's right
[1:25:27] now
[1:25:29] i want you just to see for a moment
[1:25:33] as we type this and we look at it with
[1:25:36] the church progression
[1:25:38] now remember parallel the thought of a
[1:25:40] wheat plant
[1:25:41] along with the thought of abraham
[1:25:44] and his stations along with the
[1:25:46] restoration of the church
[1:25:49] and the church
[1:25:50] will come
[1:25:52] like a wheat plant
[1:25:54] out of an out of
[1:25:56] death in the life
[1:25:58] it'll come and it'll progress
[1:26:01] now
[1:26:02] he will show you these things now watch
[1:26:06] you got to keep walking
[1:26:11] whatever you do
[1:26:14] don't stop where you're out
[1:26:18] in fact for the matter is you walk
[1:26:20] until your body is changed
[1:26:23] and until you've reached that you've got
[1:26:26] another step to take
[1:26:28] amen
[1:26:32] that puts everybody in the same place
[1:26:35] today
[1:26:36] you've got to take another step
[1:26:40] amen i don't care how long you've been a
[1:26:42] christian
[1:26:44] i i don't care how many merits that we
[1:26:46] can put on the board for you and awards
[1:26:49] we can give you
[1:26:50] i want you to understand something with
[1:26:53] real clear you have not arrived
[1:26:56] and you must keep going
[1:26:58] and if you got here it was by grace and
[1:27:01] grace will give you the power to take
[1:27:03] another step
[1:27:09] some people just need to take the step
[1:27:10] of repentance
[1:27:18] another might need the step of baptism
[1:27:20] in his name
[1:27:22] there's only one name that you can be
[1:27:24] saved
[1:27:25] and that's the name of jesus christ
[1:27:27] salvation baptism the part of salvation
[1:27:30] so you must be baptized in the name of
[1:27:32] jesus christ
[1:27:33] for remission of sin
[1:27:36] and
[1:27:37] you shall receive so there's a
[1:27:38] progression after that
[1:27:40] that's right
[1:27:41] now look here in my micah chapter 6 and
[1:27:44] verse 8 micah 6-8 he has showed you a
[1:27:47] man what is good
[1:27:49] and what the lord does require of thee
[1:27:53] i mean he wants to know what he wants
[1:27:55] art to act justly and to love mercy and
[1:28:00] to walk humbly before your god
[1:28:03] so this is what god requires of every
[1:28:06] man walk humbly before me
[1:28:10] this is where he calls abraham walk
[1:28:12] humbly walk before me
[1:28:15] and be thou perfect
[1:28:17] so so again
[1:28:19] he would say this in genesis 17 1 walk
[1:28:23] before me and be thou perfect
[1:28:26] so god is calling you to perfection
[1:28:32] amen he calls you to adoption to the
[1:28:35] change of your body
[1:28:36] he calls you to a resurrection he calls
[1:28:39] you that's why i'm saying he is calling
[1:28:42] for you
[1:28:44] take another step
[1:28:48] now
[1:28:49] oh to be a man that god walks with
[1:28:53] he said walk before me and be thou
[1:28:55] perfect oh to be a man that god walks
[1:28:57] with
[1:28:59] it's more than a song he walks with me
[1:29:01] and he talks with me and he tells me
[1:29:04] that i'm his own
[1:29:06] god wants somebody to walk with him
[1:29:09] and he's calling you come walk through
[1:29:11] the promises of this land discover
[1:29:14] everything that i got
[1:29:16] amen i'm giving you the complete land
[1:29:20] listen
[1:29:21] philosophies may be living there now
[1:29:24] giants may be on this portion
[1:29:27] and many enemies over here and there and
[1:29:29] adversaries here and there it doesn't
[1:29:32] matter i gave it to you
[1:29:35] you said brother tim i'm sick god gave
[1:29:38] you healing but there's devils on that
[1:29:40] promise
[1:29:41] and they're howling at you trying to
[1:29:43] keep you off of them
[1:29:45] but i want you to know i want you to
[1:29:47] know that if god calls you to that
[1:29:50] mountain you can take that mountain
[1:29:53] if god gave you a promise it is your
[1:29:55] promise
[1:29:57] amen and you must look at it as my
[1:30:00] promise my word and i will not be
[1:30:03] defeated i will accept what god said
[1:30:06] about me by his strengths i am healed i
[1:30:10] will believe his report and no other
[1:30:13] [Applause]
[1:30:15] because
[1:30:16] his arm is only revealed to those who
[1:30:20] believe his report
[1:30:26] and when you do this this works
[1:30:28] righteousness amen
[1:30:31] a christian life is a journey
[1:30:34] it is not just one step you've got to
[1:30:37] keep walking
[1:30:39] ain't it walk with god that's
[1:30:41] progression
[1:30:43] enough walked with god and then he was
[1:30:45] no more because god took him away he
[1:30:48] raptured him
[1:30:49] enough walked with god
[1:30:52] to
[1:30:52] to the rapture amen
[1:30:55] he progressed
[1:30:58] amen you said brother tim now you've
[1:30:59] been preaching 52 years i've got another
[1:31:02] step to take
[1:31:04] that's right i cannot rest on my laurels
[1:31:07] or my accomplishments or what i did in
[1:31:09] the past
[1:31:10] and i must press
[1:31:13] toward the mark for the prize of the
[1:31:15] high court i must never give up
[1:31:20] amen you say because i cannot do it
[1:31:23] until god takes me away
[1:31:27] and neither can you
[1:31:31] now this kind of walking is a person
[1:31:34] who's moving forward and it's one step
[1:31:36] at a time
[1:31:37] some are little steps some are giant
[1:31:39] steps but they're all steps
[1:31:42] but this person moving forward is
[1:31:44] consumed with the journey itself
[1:31:48] and it was so consumed think about it
[1:31:51] walking with god
[1:31:52] the bible said he walked with god and
[1:31:55] was not
[1:31:56] so he was so consumed with his companion
[1:31:59] god being his companion on the journey
[1:32:02] he didn't even question where they were
[1:32:03] going
[1:32:06] you know many times we get into
[1:32:08] situations well god where are we going
[1:32:09] what are we going to do i've done that
[1:32:12] i guarantee you since mr cameron passed

[1:32:31] going to follow i don't question where
[1:32:33] you're leading me
[1:32:34] [Applause]

[1:32:39] here for a reason
[1:32:41] amen amen you say but brother tim in
[1:32:43] this place i'm out this sickness he
[1:32:45] brought you here for a reason
[1:32:47] and here is a challenge god brought you
[1:32:50] here for a reason
[1:32:52] you are here for a purpose
[1:32:55] god has brought listen god is not the
[1:32:57] author of frustration he is the author
[1:33:00] of peace
[1:33:01] and so he brings you to a place for a
[1:33:04] reason where that you can know god in a
[1:33:07] greater way
[1:33:08] than you ever know him
[1:33:12] you would never know him as a cancer to
[1:33:14] peter if you never had cancer you know
[1:33:17] and the church here will never know him
[1:33:19] as a cancer defeater you know unless we
[1:33:22] face cancer and defeated it and we have
[1:33:26] and we will again
[1:33:28] amen
[1:33:29] i said we will again
[1:33:32] amen because the angel in charge said
[1:33:35] nothing would stand against our prayers
[1:33:37] not even cancer
[1:33:39] so we well again
[1:33:45] that's right that's good
[1:33:47] enoch is so consumed
[1:33:51] with his companion
[1:33:52] just in love with the lord that's right
[1:33:56] along the journey don't question
[1:33:59] why me lord
[1:34:01] how come i'm in this
[1:34:02] place why don't why did this happen to
[1:34:05] me
[1:34:06] oh woe is me
[1:34:08] oh you know god doesn't love me it
[1:34:11] didn't happen
[1:34:12] none of that come on
[1:34:15] he walked with god he didn't question
[1:34:18] don't question where you're at
[1:34:21] just
[1:34:22] look around and see if god's there
[1:34:26] grace
[1:34:28] will never bring you to a place
[1:34:30] that grace cannot keep you
[1:34:35] so he says he is he he is every step now
[1:34:39] he's drawn closer and closer with god
[1:34:41] and god's saying walk with me walk
[1:34:44] deeply with me
[1:34:46] let me permeate every part of who you
[1:34:49] are let's go somewhere together
[1:34:52] along the way we'll talk we'll have
[1:34:55] joyful times and laugh together
[1:34:58] god's got emotions the bible said that
[1:35:01] god laughed the bible said that god
[1:35:03] cries
[1:35:04] the bible come on somebody
[1:35:07] the bible talks about god he's not a
[1:35:10] a merciless spirit there he's god and he
[1:35:14] has he he when he became a man he could
[1:35:16] weep we went with the with the those
[1:35:19] that had lost a loved one he could he
[1:35:22] could rejoice with those he could shout
[1:35:26] he could lift up his voice
[1:35:29] come on church
[1:35:30] this is god
[1:35:32] and as we go along we laugh together
[1:35:34] we'll cry together and but with each
[1:35:37] death we have faith that god has taken
[1:35:40] us to the place he wants us to be
[1:35:44] and one day
[1:35:45] we'll walk all the way to his house
[1:35:49] [Applause]
[1:35:56] and never give up till you're there
[1:36:00] that's the time you can rest
[1:36:02] that's the time you can quit walking
[1:36:09] so as you walk
[1:36:10] you come to different places in your
[1:36:12] journey
[1:36:15] or different stages
[1:36:17] in life
[1:36:18] or you're a christian experience
[1:36:21] and we'll call these stages
[1:36:23] or places as i said abraham would come
[1:36:25] down he'd build an altar
[1:36:27] call on the name of the lord god would
[1:36:29] be revealed to him in a special way
[1:36:32] so you come to different stages or
[1:36:34] places in your journey your christian
[1:36:36] journey
[1:36:38] and we'll call the stages of the church
[1:36:40] and even your individual stage
[1:36:42] justification
[1:36:44] where sins are forgiven
[1:36:46] sanctification that's the cleansing from
[1:36:49] evil habits
[1:36:51] and then the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:53] where god comes to dwell
[1:36:55] in you
[1:36:57] and you keep on walking right onto the
[1:36:59] resurrection or the body change
[1:37:03] now the divine call it was not abraham
[1:37:06] seeking god but it was god calling man
[1:37:10] god seeking man it had nothing to do
[1:37:13] with him being more worthier than anyone
[1:37:15] else
[1:37:17] let's go back into verse 2 of chapter 12
[1:37:20] of genesis and i want you to watch these
[1:37:23] four words and i will make
[1:37:26] i want you to see again this is not your
[1:37:29] own efforts
[1:37:31] this is god doing something in your life
[1:37:35] i am going to do this
[1:37:38] you see i will make of thee a great
[1:37:41] nation
[1:37:43] and i will bless thee amen
[1:37:46] i hope you're reading these as your own
[1:37:50] amen
[1:37:51] and he said and i will make thy name
[1:37:53] great and thou shalt be a blessing
[1:37:57] and i will bless them that bless thee
[1:37:59] and curse him that curses thee and
[1:38:02] indeed shall all the families of the
[1:38:04] earth be blessed
[1:38:06] now this was given to abraham it was a
[1:38:08] sovereign call you see no man seeketh
[1:38:10] after god no not one the bible says
[1:38:14] god seeking after man abraham is not
[1:38:17] justified by works but by his faith
[1:38:22] you see you can never be good enough to
[1:38:25] be to deserve or receive anything from
[1:38:28] god
[1:38:31] never
[1:38:32] it is never i mean you say well you know
[1:38:34] this happened to me and i've been a
[1:38:36] faithful christian you see it has
[1:38:39] nothing to do with how long you've been
[1:38:41] a christian it has everything to do with
[1:38:44] you believing
[1:38:46] if whatever he can give you to believe
[1:38:49] that's yours
[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:38:52] that's why the discernment gift was
[1:38:53] given we would go back in a life with
[1:38:56] brother branham and could tell somebody
[1:38:58] what happened 40 years ago and that
[1:39:00] their street address and their and their
[1:39:02] problem and what the doctor said
[1:39:04] described the doctor and everything else
[1:39:07] he he said it was like
[1:39:09] like taking a a a
[1:39:11] musical instrument like a guitar a tune
[1:39:14] in the strength
[1:39:16] you heard the other day when when
[1:39:18] brother wendell was saying
[1:39:20] well he's drummed his guitar and there's
[1:39:23] there's something out of tune well it
[1:39:26] isn't that there isn't a string it isn't
[1:39:28] that it isn't a guitar
[1:39:30] it isn't that you're not a christian it
[1:39:33] isn't that you don't have faith your
[1:39:35] faith is out of tune
[1:39:38] and it won't reach the melody
[1:39:40] and the harmony that matches god's word
[1:39:43] so what did he do he took the little key
[1:39:46] there and he twisted it around until
[1:39:50] that match the note
[1:39:53] for the song
[1:39:55] and there are scriptures laying in the
[1:39:56] word of god and you may be a christian
[1:39:59] you may have faith you've got the guitar
[1:40:02] you got the string
[1:40:03] but you see you need it tuning up
[1:40:07] until what you are saying matches what's
[1:40:10] on god's word
[1:40:13] because you got the you got the music
[1:40:15] sheet and it says this certain note for
[1:40:18] this certain place and so you've got to
[1:40:20] tune it where that it matches
[1:40:25] are you with me that's what god's had to
[1:40:27] do with our faith
[1:40:29] amen we are going through things because
[1:40:32] god is tuning our faith
[1:40:34] your faith has been way down here and
[1:40:37] then
[1:40:38] it's just totally out of tune you can
[1:40:40] never match the promise of the word of
[1:40:42] god
[1:40:43] you also put it here in the bible and we
[1:40:47] our faith has got to match it
[1:40:49] [Music]
[1:40:51] that's what malachi 4 was to do who was
[1:40:53] to lift your faith another level
[1:40:56] to rapture in faith
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:00] hallelujah
[1:41:02] now so is god's sovereign call
[1:41:04] and abraham was not justified by his
[1:41:08] works but by his faith as i said you
[1:41:11] cannot be good enough to deserve
[1:41:12] anything from god
[1:41:14] well i'll become a christian when i get
[1:41:16] good enough no that's not how you come
[1:41:19] you come to god just as you are
[1:41:22] but not to stay as you are
[1:41:24] a lot of people sang just as i am
[1:41:27] and said god you just got to take me
[1:41:29] just the way i am because that's just me
[1:41:32] and that's just the way i'm going to be
[1:41:34] so if you want me god come get me but i
[1:41:36] want you to understand you're taking me
[1:41:38] just as i am
[1:41:42] i i'm not going to change i'm still
[1:41:44] going to have my liquor i'm still going
[1:41:46] to have my beers i'm still going to have
[1:41:48] my worldly friends i'm still going to
[1:41:49] i'm still going to listen to worldly
[1:41:51] music i'm still going to do whatever i
[1:41:53] want to do
[1:41:58] because god you're taking me just as i
[1:42:00] am
[1:42:03] that's not what that means
[1:42:05] it means that i
[1:42:07] am undeserving of life
[1:42:10] i'm undeserving of salvation
[1:42:13] i'm in this pitiful condition and i
[1:42:15] can't help myself
[1:42:17] but i'm coming as a sinner just as i am
[1:42:21] and i don't have one plea of my own
[1:42:24] righteousness or goodness or deserving
[1:42:26] anything
[1:42:28] but
[1:42:29] just this one plea
[1:42:31] that your blood was shed for me
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:38] now
[1:42:39] so you see in romans chapter 4 and verse
[1:42:42] 2
[1:42:43] if abraham was justified when you see
[1:42:46] that word justified you have to think
[1:42:49] what that means it means made righteous
[1:42:52] so when we say in justification
[1:42:55] we mean
[1:42:56] it was there god made you righteous
[1:43:00] didn't say you were righteous
[1:43:02] god made you that way
[1:43:04] he made you that way by his blood being
[1:43:07] shed in your place
[1:43:08] and his your your sins
[1:43:13] your sins were exchanged for his
[1:43:14] righteousness
[1:43:18] now
[1:43:20] if abraham was justified by works if he
[1:43:22] was made righteous by works he had
[1:43:24] whereup to glory but not before god for
[1:43:28] what saith the scripture abraham
[1:43:30] believed god and it was counted on him
[1:43:32] for righteousness so you see the way
[1:43:35] that we get righteous is through our
[1:43:37] faith
[1:43:38] believing god
[1:43:41] it's not our it's not not our works if
[1:43:43] we're made righteous by our works we did
[1:43:45] good deeds i carried sweet potato to the
[1:43:47] widow i uh i helped the uh you know i
[1:43:51] while i donated to the fund for ukraine
[1:43:53] war and i've done this and i've you're
[1:43:56] not saved by none of that
[1:43:59] you're not saved by hail mary's and
[1:44:01] and and the penance and that that's not
[1:44:05] salvation
[1:44:06] amen it is not works that you do you
[1:44:09] come to god just as you are i'm a sinner
[1:44:13] i need a savior
[1:44:16] nobody can be saved until they first
[1:44:18] realize i'm lost
[1:44:22] you can never save a man who thinks he
[1:44:24] knows where he's at
[1:44:26] amen
[1:44:28] he's got to realize i'm lost
[1:44:31] and i can't find my way out
[1:44:34] amen now i'm i'm oversimplifying this
[1:44:37] for everybody
[1:44:39] but watch
[1:44:40] none of our good deeds can earn us a
[1:44:42] place in heaven
[1:44:44] well i kept i took care of my mother and
[1:44:46] she was a saint and i know she went
[1:44:49] and i did good to her you cannot earn a
[1:44:52] place in heaven
[1:44:56] well i i i give so much money to the
[1:44:59] poor all the time i fed strangers i've
[1:45:01] done it you cannot earn a place in
[1:45:04] heaven
[1:45:06] i went to church every sunday and
[1:45:08] wednesday for 50 years you cannot earn a
[1:45:11] place in heaven
[1:45:14] i paid my tithe i've done this i've done
[1:45:17] i've done that you cannot earn a place
[1:45:23] it's all
[1:45:24] the favor of god
[1:45:27] so none of our good deeds can earn us a
[1:45:29] place in heaven we're not saved because
[1:45:31] we go to church
[1:45:35] you're not saved because you dress holy
[1:45:39] my skirt has never been
[1:45:41] above my knees in my life i don't wear
[1:45:43] this i don't wear that i hadn't put on
[1:45:45] makeup i don't i don't cut my hair i
[1:45:47] don't do this i don't you are not saved
[1:45:50] because
[1:45:51] you dress holy
[1:45:55] or because we get to the poor tithe of
[1:45:57] our income we're saved by grace through
[1:46:00] faith
[1:46:03] we are required to believe and accept
[1:46:06] god's pardon from our sins
[1:46:08] nobody can be forgiven unless they
[1:46:11] accept forgiveness
[1:46:13] and some of you just simply need to
[1:46:15] forgive yourself
[1:46:21] hey man yeah you've been stupid you've
[1:46:24] been a human right that's why you've
[1:46:26] been stupid
[1:46:27] you've done stupid things you've made
[1:46:29] awful mistakes all the water could have
[1:46:31] said it won't turn it around
[1:46:33] you've got to start right there
[1:46:35] accepting god's pardon i am forgiven
[1:46:45] there are
[1:46:47] too many christians that are going
[1:46:49] around beat down and everything else
[1:46:51] because of their past
[1:46:54] amen you will never ever achieve the
[1:46:59] things of god until you first accept
[1:47:02] god's pardon
[1:47:04] i am not a sinner i am not
[1:47:07] that is not my sins they are washed in
[1:47:10] the blood of jesus i have been cleansed
[1:47:16] i've accepted his pardon
[1:47:18] i am forgiven
[1:47:23] i don't have to hold my head down the
[1:47:25] rest of my life beat down because of
[1:47:28] something horrible in my past
[1:47:32] a lot of people say brother tim
[1:47:34] the devil said to me well first of all
[1:47:36] why are you listening to him
[1:47:39] shut his mouth up right now if you
[1:47:41] recognize the devil then go ahead and
[1:47:44] just turn it off
[1:47:48] well the devil said to me he reminded me
[1:47:51] of my past
[1:47:52] he don't have too good a past either
[1:47:57] and all you got to do is remind him of
[1:47:58] his past
[1:48:00] but i got a secret for you the devil
[1:48:02] don't have a future and you do
[1:48:09] hallelujah
[1:48:11] you're a people with the future
[1:48:13] god has a plan for you he said my plan
[1:48:16] for you
[1:48:17] my plan for you is to give you peace
[1:48:20] and not evil to bring you to an expected
[1:48:23] place
[1:48:25] amen hallelujah to bring you all the way
[1:48:27] into where that you you you you drink of
[1:48:32] the waters of life freely
[1:48:34] hell should i
[1:48:38] probably never reach this today
[1:48:40] i'm just going to take my time
[1:48:45] our deeds cannot earn us
[1:48:47] david said in romans
[1:48:49] 4 and 6 david is quoted that david
[1:48:52] describeth the man
[1:48:54] the blessedness of a man a man is
[1:48:57] blessed
[1:48:58] unto whom god imputeth righteousness
[1:49:01] without works
[1:49:04] we are blessed because god imputed
[1:49:07] righteousness
[1:49:09] without works i didn't do nothing to
[1:49:12] deserve it
[1:49:15] amen
[1:49:16] saying blessed are they whose
[1:49:19] iniquities were for are forgiven you
[1:49:21] know does anybody know what iniquities
[1:49:24] is
[1:49:25] iniquity says when i do something i do
[1:49:27] better than to do
[1:49:32] and he said what do you say his
[1:49:34] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[1:49:36] are what
[1:49:38] covered
[1:49:39] well this was in david's time and they
[1:49:41] had the blood of bulls and goats it
[1:49:43] could only cover sin you got a greater
[1:49:44] blood
[1:49:46] and that blood does not cover sin
[1:49:49] watch this for a moment
[1:49:51] if i if i would take him and i would
[1:49:54] and i would put a mark on the white part
[1:49:56] of this pulpit
[1:49:58] and then i would come along and i would
[1:50:00] paint over with white again
[1:50:03] oh wow the pulpits made new
[1:50:06] but behind that
[1:50:08] fresh paint
[1:50:10] is my old mark stain
[1:50:16] it's still there
[1:50:18] it's just covered over
[1:50:19] that's all the blood bulls and goats
[1:50:21] could do
[1:50:23] was cover over but the blood of jesus
[1:50:26] annihilates sin
[1:50:29] it doesn't it's not a pain to go over
[1:50:32] your sin it's a blood a bleach that
[1:50:35] completely changes every bit of it every
[1:50:39] fragment every
[1:50:41] every element of your sins
[1:50:44] listen like dropping a a drop of bleach
[1:50:47] down and or draw a drop of heat into a
[1:50:49] tub of bleach
[1:50:50] and you watch it and it just circles
[1:50:52] around and disappears
[1:50:55] it goes back and gets changed in some
[1:50:58] other form are you with me you'll never
[1:51:00] find it again
[1:51:02] it'll never become ink again
[1:51:04] it's gone because it's been dipped in
[1:51:07] the bleach
[1:51:09] the same thing happens with your sins
[1:51:12] when it's put in the bleach of the blood
[1:51:14] of jesus christ it swams around and down
[1:51:17] and down and down into the depths of
[1:51:19] that blood until it's no more
[1:51:23] you can't find a mark against you
[1:51:26] but i got a little further to go with
[1:51:28] that do you realize that your sin
[1:51:30] continues to travel until it goes back
[1:51:33] on the head of your accusers
[1:51:36] and one day satan will burn in hell for
[1:51:39] your sins
[1:51:44] hallelujah amount so they're not my sins
[1:51:47] they are his sins get behind me satan i
[1:51:51] am a child of the most high god
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:51:56] amen
[1:52:01] psalms 103 and 8
[1:52:04] god the lord is merciful and gracious
[1:52:09] and slow to anger
[1:52:11] and plenteous in
[1:52:14] mercy he will not always chide
[1:52:18] neither will he keep his anger forever
[1:52:22] come on
[1:52:24] he had not dealt with us after our sins
[1:52:26] nor rewarded us according to our
[1:52:27] iniquities
[1:52:29] for as the heaven is high above the
[1:52:31] earth so great is his mercy toward them
[1:52:34] that fear him
[1:52:36] so he's a god that is rich in mercy
[1:52:39] how much mercy as high as the heaven
[1:52:43] is from the earth
[1:52:44] it just keeps on going
[1:52:47] amen there's no stopping places israel's
[1:52:50] mercy is so high this is why after the
[1:52:52] seals brother adam could preach god is
[1:52:54] rich in mercy
[1:52:57] amen the open book didn't give us less
[1:52:59] mercy it gave us more mercy
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:05] the opening of the book the taking off
[1:53:07] the seals there's mercy for souls in the
[1:53:10] altar
[1:53:12] under the fifth seal
[1:53:13] jews who died not knowing jesus there's
[1:53:16] mercy for the church
[1:53:18] who accepted christ but missed the
[1:53:20] rapture
[1:53:22] and and are found in the tribulation
[1:53:24] period there's mercy for the 144
[1:53:26] thousand after the bride is raptured you
[1:53:28] see there's mercy mercy mercy
[1:53:32] mercy
[1:53:34] mercy for the bride
[1:53:36] mercy for the foolish virgins
[1:53:39] mercy
[1:53:41] for the 144 000 the leftover of the jews
[1:53:45] mercy for those down to the ages
[1:53:48] that didn't get a chance to know god's
[1:53:50] rich in mercy
[1:53:54] are you with me now
[1:53:55] so you see he has not dealt with us
[1:53:57] according to our sins nor rewarded us
[1:53:59] according to our iniquities but as a
[1:54:01] heaven is high above the earth so great
[1:54:04] is his mercy toward them that reverence
[1:54:07] him
[1:54:08] amen now so
[1:54:10] in all of this and
[1:54:12] and so
[1:54:14] because of this mercy
[1:54:16] he raptures a bride
[1:54:18] we are going to be raptured because of
[1:54:20] the grace and the mercies
[1:54:23] of almighty god
[1:54:27] micah chapter 7 verse 19 he will turn
[1:54:30] again
[1:54:31] and have compassion upon us he will
[1:54:33] subdue our iniquities and that will
[1:54:35] castled us and thou will cast all their
[1:54:39] sins into the depth of the sea
[1:54:43] amen
[1:54:45] amen so he will have compassion on you
[1:54:48] this is a god who's a compassionate god
[1:54:50] a god that is full of mercy
[1:54:53] a god that says to the to the the lowest
[1:54:56] sinner
[1:54:58] to the person closest to hell
[1:55:01] a man that
[1:55:03] i'm not going to reward you according to
[1:55:05] your works i'm going to reward you
[1:55:07] according to my mercy
[1:55:09] amen i'll turn again i'll have
[1:55:11] compassion on you i'll you know he'll
[1:55:14] subdue our iniquities and he will cast
[1:55:17] all our sins into the depths of the sea
[1:55:21] verse 12 of psalms 103 said as far as
[1:55:24] the east is from the west
[1:55:26] so he has removed our transgressions for
[1:55:29] from us
[1:55:30] so this is god as far as the east is
[1:55:33] from the west
[1:55:37] like as a father pity of his children he
[1:55:40] does this as a father like a father
[1:55:43] feels sorry for his children so the lord
[1:55:47] pitteth them that reverences him
[1:55:55] psalms 103 and verse 13
[1:55:58] or verse 14 for he knoweth our frame he
[1:56:01] remembereth that we are dust so he
[1:56:04] remembers he understands our humanity
[1:56:12] i said he understands
[1:56:15] our humanity
[1:56:16] that we're just human
[1:56:19] and as humans
[1:56:20] we bumble we make mistakes
[1:56:25] we do things
[1:56:26] some things we didn't want to do
[1:56:30] we get trapped
[1:56:33] we get disillusioned
[1:56:35] we have problems
[1:56:37] but he knoweth our frame
[1:56:39] and he
[1:56:40] remembers their dust
[1:56:43] they're human
[1:56:47] and there's a man as for man his days
[1:56:49] are his grass is a flower of the field
[1:56:51] so he flourishes
[1:56:53] for the wind passes over and is gone and
[1:56:55] the place thereof shall know it no more
[1:56:57] and that's our humanity
[1:57:00] we're only here for a blip in time
[1:57:08] you look out on the earth you know and a
[1:57:11] person now gone and the things that they
[1:57:14] touched the trees that they looked at
[1:57:17] the roads that you travel they're all
[1:57:19] still here that's right but they're gone
[1:57:23] you're only here for a moment
[1:57:25] every one of you have a terminal disease
[1:57:30] you're going to die
[1:57:32] say the doctor told me i'm going to die
[1:57:35] you're going to die doctor didn't have
[1:57:37] to tell you that
[1:57:38] you might be dying sooner than others
[1:57:40] but you're going to die
[1:57:41] all of us are going to come to that
[1:57:43] place unless god interrupts it
[1:57:46] [Applause]
[1:57:47] by resurrection and a rapture
[1:57:50] but otherwise we'll all go down into
[1:57:52] dust we're only here for a moment
[1:57:56] but it's what we do in that moment that
[1:57:58] counts
[1:58:00] because it's only here that you can make
[1:58:02] your decision
[1:58:04] to serve jesus christ
[1:58:14] when
[1:58:16] man is days of grass
[1:58:18] there's a flower in the field he
[1:58:20] flourishes he comes up and he blooms for
[1:58:22] a while he wilts
[1:58:24] goes down
[1:58:25] the wind passes over it blows it away
[1:58:29] the place where it was not even known
[1:58:31] anymore
[1:58:37] but not the mercies of god
[1:58:39] but the mercies of the lord is from
[1:58:41] everlasting to everlasting upon them
[1:58:44] that reverence him and his righteousness
[1:58:47] unto his children's children
[1:58:50] to keep to such as keep his covenant and
[1:58:52] those who remember his commandments to
[1:58:54] do them
[1:58:55] let's go along to jeremiah 31 34 and
[1:58:58] they shall teach no man ever understand
[1:59:01] no more teach every man his neighbor and
[1:59:03] every man his brother saying know the
[1:59:05] lord for they shall all know me from the
[1:59:07] least and to the greatest of them saith
[1:59:09] the lord for i will forgive their
[1:59:11] iniquity and i will remember their sins
[1:59:16] no more
[1:59:17] so not only are they casting the sea he
[1:59:19] doesn't remember them
[1:59:23] so in your fellowship and walk with him
[1:59:26] he is not reminding you of your past
[1:59:29] if you're being reminded of your past
[1:59:31] it's your adversary who is the accuser
[1:59:34] of the brethren
[1:59:36] [Applause]
[1:59:39] this mercy and forgiveness is given to
[1:59:42] us by grace
[1:59:45] now in the days of luther the church the
[1:59:48] catholic church they taught forgiveness
[1:59:50] of sins on the basis of works
[1:59:53] and this this is where the confusion is
[1:59:55] you know this is where i've come down
[1:59:57] with these scriptures but i want you to
[1:59:59] understand the people in that day didn't
[2:00:01] have a bible
[2:00:05] so they could just be told whatever the
[2:00:07] priest said
[2:00:09] and whatever edict the pope passed
[2:00:12] the bible calls her very distinctly she
[2:00:15] is a and she's got daughters
[2:00:18] in the book of revelation she's called
[2:00:20] that she's a mother horse he calls us
[2:00:22] herself the mother church she is a
[2:00:24] mother she's got daughters
[2:00:26] that's right
[2:00:28] denominations
[2:00:33] and as a horse she's one that's not true
[2:00:34] to her husband
[2:00:36] so she wasn't true to her husband in
[2:00:38] fact she changed her husband to suit
[2:00:41] herself
[2:00:43] so she made him into some kind of
[2:00:45] namby-pamby
[2:00:47] son
[2:00:48] who had to be obedient to his mother so
[2:00:52] you pray to mama to get this the son to
[2:00:56] be moved in the heart of jesus with
[2:00:58] mercy towards you and if you didn't pray
[2:01:00] to mary then you wasn't going to make it
[2:01:03] to heaven
[2:01:08] as they required you then to say so many
[2:01:10] hail marys
[2:01:13] you see
[2:01:14] when we preach about denominations and
[2:01:17] you you it's kind of like having
[2:01:20] a these offsprings of slaves that are
[2:01:24] here
[2:01:26] and they were former slaves and be
[2:01:28] honest with you
[2:01:29] at some time in our life we were all
[2:01:31] former slaves
[2:01:32] whether you're white or black
[2:01:34] the irish were slaves
[2:01:37] and enslaved and the english would get
[2:01:39] enslaved and man's done this this is sin
[2:01:42] but you know i i honestly don't remember
[2:01:46] i you know i'm part irish but i don't
[2:01:48] remember a thing i don't know a thing
[2:01:51] i never experienced a thing my
[2:01:52] forefather's experience
[2:01:55] you know you you that are are black here
[2:01:58] in this church today you don't know a
[2:02:00] thing of what they did
[2:02:02] or what they experienced you never had a
[2:02:04] slave belt on you
[2:02:06] and there's many of you sitting here you
[2:02:08] never knew what it was to be under the
[2:02:11] slave belt of denominations
[2:02:14] upon the rule of man
[2:02:16] you don't know what it meant to be beat
[2:02:19] and whipped
[2:02:20] and misled and misguided
[2:02:25] so you know when we talk about liberty
[2:02:27] you're not understanding what the
[2:02:29] liberty we had and why we enjoy that
[2:02:32] liberty and why we talk about it
[2:02:36] but we're just trying to pass it off
[2:02:38] don't ever become a slave again
[2:02:42] amen
[2:02:42] we're trying to say to our children
[2:02:44] enjoy your freedom
[2:02:46] it was paid for we fought for it
[2:02:49] amen
[2:02:56] i know white men did awful things to the
[2:02:58] black race here in america but white men
[2:03:01] also fought to liberate them
[2:03:10] in the days of luther
[2:03:12] the church the catholic church taught
[2:03:14] forgiveness of sins on the basis of work
[2:03:18] of penance for sins
[2:03:20] they required you to say
[2:03:22] numerous hail mary's asking mary to
[2:03:24] petition jesus for sin forgive sins
[2:03:27] money
[2:03:28] would be required
[2:03:30] for prayers to pay your loved ones out
[2:03:32] of purgatory
[2:03:35] you you know
[2:03:36] it wasn't enough the for to pay you know
[2:03:39] for you have to do penance and pay money
[2:03:41] and burn candles and buy candles and
[2:03:44] whatever to pay for your to say prayers
[2:03:46] for yourself that wasn't enough they
[2:03:48] made it worth it when your loved ones
[2:03:49] died you had to pay for them too
[2:03:54] the catholic encyclopedia talks in
[2:03:56] purgatory as a place or condition of
[2:03:58] temporal punishment for those who would
[2:04:00] depart in this life in god and god's
[2:04:03] grace are not entirely free from venial
[2:04:06] faults or have not fully paid the
[2:04:09] due to their transgression
[2:04:11] and to summarize in catholic theology
[2:04:14] purgatory is a place that a christian
[2:04:16] soul goes to after death to be cleansed
[2:04:19] of the sins that have not been fully
[2:04:21] satisfied during life
[2:04:25] so again you know a lot of people aren't
[2:04:28] catholics but they're still catholics
[2:04:30] they're still trying to pay for their
[2:04:31] sins
[2:04:33] and not only that they're trying to make
[2:04:34] somebody else pay for their sins
[2:04:38] and they they want them they want to
[2:04:39] make sure whoever wounded them or hurt
[2:04:42] them pays for it
[2:04:45] and they become like the servant who was
[2:04:47] forgiven of a huge amount and then found
[2:04:53] that same servant comes along and he
[2:04:54] finds somebody that just owed him
[2:04:57] pennies and he and he put him in jail
[2:05:00] had him beaten put in jail until he paid
[2:05:03] the last penny yeah
[2:05:05] and then the report comes back to to to
[2:05:08] the lord over him and he says you know
[2:05:10] you were not you you did not give
[2:05:13] forgiveness you received forgiveness i
[2:05:15] gave you great forgiveness but you won't
[2:05:17] forgive this other person i'll tell you
[2:05:20] nobody should ever want somebody to go
[2:05:23] to hell
[2:05:25] there should never be one i would never
[2:05:27] say i want to meet you in judgment
[2:05:29] someday i hope i never meet you in
[2:05:31] judgment
[2:05:34] i don't want to see nobody lost
[2:05:36] god forgave me so much i want to be able
[2:05:39] to forgive others
[2:05:41] [Applause]
[2:05:42] because as the very lord's prayer says
[2:05:45] if you cannot forgive others of their
[2:05:47] trespasses you cannot be forgiven either
[2:05:51] so do you realize when you hold somebody
[2:05:54] captive
[2:05:55] with some accusation or hurt or problem
[2:05:58] or death that they owe you
[2:06:00] they owe me a debt they should pay for
[2:06:02] this they must pay for this they owe me
[2:06:05] a debt i say god so willingly and
[2:06:09] amazingly forgave you why won't you
[2:06:12] offer that same peace and pardon
[2:06:16] [Applause]
[2:06:23] the bible said jesus said if you won't
[2:06:25] forgive others neither will the heavenly
[2:06:28] father forgive
[2:06:29] you
[2:06:31] of your trespasses
[2:06:40] say this is too simple brother tim i
[2:06:42] can't preach over your head
[2:06:48] but why do i want to speak in tongues to
[2:06:50] you
[2:06:51] and i can come right down to where you
[2:06:53] need to deal with some things
[2:06:59] some of you need to forgive things in
[2:07:00] your marriage
[2:07:04] some of your children need to forgive
[2:07:05] your parents
[2:07:09] and vice versa
[2:07:11] some of your friends need to forgive one
[2:07:13] another
[2:07:17] because you're only hurting yourself
[2:07:24] purgatory was a place where the dead
[2:07:27] souls hung over the fires of hell and
[2:07:29] you were punished
[2:07:30] till you got out
[2:07:33] until somebody paid enough money to say
[2:07:35] enough prayers to pray you out
[2:07:37] so you finally satisfied the coffers of
[2:07:39] the church
[2:07:43] i've been overseas
[2:07:45] i've been a lot of places overseas i've
[2:07:47] been to mexico city
[2:07:49] i watched them
[2:07:51] where the earthquake even took out one
[2:07:53] of their churches and
[2:07:55] cracked it up and then they had to build
[2:07:57] another
[2:07:58] and i watched
[2:07:59] women and men
[2:08:01] on their hands and knees
[2:08:03] climbing the steps
[2:08:05] saying the rosaries
[2:08:07] and i mean climbing the steps by
[2:08:09] crawling on their hands and knees
[2:08:11] and crying and praying hail mary's on
[2:08:14] every step
[2:08:16] until they finally get to the top of it
[2:08:19] trying to get forgiveness
[2:08:26] the bible said
[2:08:28] in first john chapter 2 verse 2 he is
[2:08:31] the perpetuation
[2:08:34] that means he is the atoning sacrifice
[2:08:38] for our sins yes i mean to say amen
[2:08:42] but not for ours only
[2:08:46] but for the sins of the whole world and
[2:08:50] that includes everybody
[2:08:53] even the people you don't like
[2:08:55] [Applause]
[2:08:58] hallelujah he died in our place that's
[2:09:01] what it really means he's get thrown in
[2:09:03] sacrifice he died in our place to take
[2:09:07] away our sins
[2:09:11] now luther caught a revelation of this
[2:09:17] and then the church he had been trying
[2:09:18] to do penance
[2:09:21] he said his hell marries he crawled on
[2:09:23] his knees he beat himself for his sins
[2:09:27] but one day he got to looking in the
[2:09:28] bible
[2:09:29] now the bible everybody couldn't read it
[2:09:33] luther could read latin
[2:09:34] it been translated from greek into latin
[2:09:37] so you can read it
[2:09:39] not everybody's got a copy
[2:09:45] hold your bible up for a moment
[2:09:48] this bible was paid for in blood
[2:09:53] it did not come free
[2:09:55] men died
[2:09:58] for you to have this bible
[2:10:01] respect it
[2:10:03] honor it
[2:10:04] and by all means read it
[2:10:06] and live it
[2:10:09] men were burned at the stake
[2:10:11] for the
[2:10:12] crime of publishing the bible
[2:10:16] in fact of the matter is just in china
[2:10:18] we just had some of our brothers
[2:10:20] released for passing out uh king james
[2:10:23] bibles
[2:10:25] amen in prison imprisoned incarcerated
[2:10:28] for years
[2:10:32] for the crime up
[2:10:34] sharing the bible
[2:10:36] don't take for granted your freedoms
[2:10:43] luther caught a revelation of this as i
[2:10:45] said and he looked in the bible
[2:10:48] you know
[2:10:49] he was a priest so he had access
[2:10:53] in the monastery
[2:10:55] to a bible and he read a bible and the
[2:10:58] bible said in romans 1 16 for i'm not
[2:11:01] ashamed of the gospel of christ
[2:11:03] for it is the power of god unto
[2:11:05] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[2:11:09] the jew first and also the greek for
[2:11:12] therian is the righteousness of god
[2:11:14] revealed from faith to faith as it is
[2:11:17] written the just or the righteous shall
[2:11:20] live by its faith
[2:11:24] and losing god of revelation
[2:11:26] now this is a station this is where
[2:11:29] abraham came he was he came this first
[2:11:31] place
[2:11:32] of
[2:11:33] of justification where he he was got a
[2:11:36] divine call he wasn't worthy he it
[2:11:38] wasn't that he was good it was this god
[2:11:41] called him
[2:11:42] and this is what luther realized ain't
[2:11:45] it because i've done good it wasn't
[2:11:46] because my family was better than others
[2:11:48] it wasn't because i've done all these
[2:11:50] hail marys or i crawled on my hands and
[2:11:52] knees and i beat myself and
[2:11:55] and i hung on the cross and was
[2:11:57] crucified you know they would do that
[2:11:58] kind of thing too that where they would
[2:12:00] actually be impaled and do things
[2:12:03] to to get
[2:12:04] to get retribution for their sins
[2:12:08] sins that jesus christ freely paid for
[2:12:12] once and for all
[2:12:14] now the church was charging
[2:12:22] and you couldn't ever pay enough
[2:12:24] so when you died you went to a place of
[2:12:27] purgatory to be punished
[2:12:30] more that's right
[2:12:32] you couldn't go to heaven
[2:12:34] because you're not righteous enough
[2:12:38] until your sins are paid for
[2:12:45] widows would have to sell their cows
[2:12:47] their only means of giving milk to their
[2:12:49] family
[2:12:51] they didn't have to hawk the farm
[2:12:54] they have to do everything
[2:12:57] to be able to pay for their loved ones
[2:13:00] sins
[2:13:02] they knew his mistakes
[2:13:08] but luther gets a revelation the just
[2:13:10] the righteous shall live not by my works
[2:13:13] but by my faith
[2:13:16] it's by my faith that frees me from sin
[2:13:18] that's why my words not dependence
[2:13:20] mother my health marriage not all none
[2:13:22] of that my faith
[2:13:27] and this is a foundation where the
[2:13:28] lutherans the baptists and
[2:13:30] and even we
[2:13:32] rest our faith
[2:13:35] not just losers not just baptist we rest
[2:13:38] our faith
[2:13:39] right here that we're righteous by faith
[2:13:42] not by works
[2:13:44] [Applause]
[2:13:45] the righteous live and we live because
[2:13:48] of our faith
[2:13:49] not our works so it's plain in the bible
[2:13:52] and you say brother tim you know that's
[2:13:54] so plain in the bible why was that truth
[2:13:58] lost from the church why why didn't
[2:14:00] everybody see that why did luther have
[2:14:02] to point that out as i said nobody had a
[2:14:05] bible
[2:14:09] light had never shown on that
[2:14:11] it was like a vladimir little plant that
[2:14:13] was there and these truths are in it and
[2:14:16] it comes about into the sunlight oh
[2:14:21] now it's not a wheat
[2:14:23] seed yet it's not a grain it's just a
[2:14:27] little blade
[2:14:29] and if that's where you're at you're
[2:14:31] having a ride
[2:14:34] if god's forgiven you of your sins i'm
[2:14:36] happy
[2:14:38] i rejoice we got a crop of wheat not yet
[2:14:49] so the bibles were hidden in
[2:14:52] postures in rome and
[2:14:54] written in greek translated to latin
[2:14:59] how many of you can read
[2:15:01] greek here this morning
[2:15:04] no takers
[2:15:06] well greek bible wouldn't do you much
[2:15:07] good would it
[2:15:09] how many of you can read
[2:15:11] latin
[2:15:13] well
[2:15:14] latin bible wouldn't do you much good
[2:15:15] either would it
[2:15:19] but luther could read what the pope
[2:15:21] didn't want him to read that's right
[2:15:23] and luther believed it and luther began
[2:15:26] to preach it
[2:15:27] and brother martin luther
[2:15:29] you know
[2:15:30] he was a german so he had it translated
[2:15:33] into the german language
[2:15:36] and at that very time god would use the
[2:15:38] knowledge of man and the gutenberg press
[2:15:41] was invented and now they can
[2:15:43] mass-produce the bible
[2:15:48] and now there there would be
[2:15:51] not just one bible but now there's
[2:15:53] thunder there's thousands of bibles and
[2:15:56] you know what but luther was threatened
[2:15:57] with death
[2:15:59] furthermore thousands died
[2:16:01] and were punished for believing that god
[2:16:03] forgives sins without the need of a
[2:16:05] priest
[2:16:08] that there is no intercessor between god
[2:16:10] and man but the man christ jesus that
[2:16:12] was written in the bible but they didn't
[2:16:14] have a
[2:16:16] bible so they made man their intercessor
[2:16:19] and the priest became their mediator and
[2:16:22] the priest could forgive sins
[2:16:27] when jesus is the only one who can
[2:16:29] forgive sins
[2:16:32] and only in his blood have we redemption
[2:16:36] and it's not our works
[2:16:38] but you see they persevered and like as
[2:16:40] fledgling leaf we plan to sprout out of
[2:16:44] the grain
[2:16:45] the plant began to spread its branches
[2:16:47] and there were baptists during that time
[2:16:50] they too and this is what their churches
[2:16:52] are built on when you go to baptist
[2:16:54] church it's always by faith by faith our
[2:16:57] sins are forgiven by faith
[2:17:01] you see and so the the baptist you know
[2:17:04] saw that you you were to be baptized as
[2:17:08] an adult because all of them had been
[2:17:09] baptized in the roman catholic church
[2:17:12] by being sprinkled on as a child with
[2:17:15] some holy water
[2:17:16] and they saw that
[2:17:18] they they became what's known as
[2:17:20] re-baptizers
[2:17:22] and as a re-baptizer here they come
[2:17:25] re-baptizing them now as adults when
[2:17:27] they could could call upon the lord
[2:17:30] washing away their sins
[2:17:33] when they were of age knowing that they
[2:17:35] had done wrong before because as a
[2:17:38] little child you know they hadn't done
[2:17:40] anything wrong yet as an infant and so
[2:17:43] they begin to to preach you've got to be
[2:17:46] baptized
[2:17:47] and you've got to be immersed
[2:17:50] and they saw in the bible where that
[2:17:52] they came up out of the water and
[2:17:54] where there was much water where they
[2:17:56] were baptized and all these other things
[2:17:58] and they realized that you know where if
[2:18:00] you're going to if you're going to
[2:18:02] bury a man and the old man and his sins
[2:18:05] that we're buried with him in baptism we
[2:18:07] don't sprinkle a little dirt on him you
[2:18:09] you put him down under
[2:18:11] because it takes the death
[2:18:13] and the burial and the resurrection
[2:18:18] amen
[2:18:20] now so so again this is their beliefs
[2:18:23] this is what what they took the name
[2:18:25] baptist
[2:18:27] was because they were re-baptizers
[2:18:30] and so thousands of were murdered
[2:18:34] and killed for the simple faith of being
[2:18:37] a mercy of water calling on his name
[2:18:41] now was the truth but it wasn't all the
[2:18:43] truth
[2:18:45] and finally there was enough believers
[2:18:47] until
[2:18:48] king james of england believed and had
[2:18:50] enough scholars to translate the bible
[2:18:53] carefully and now you've got the king
[2:18:54] james bible into english
[2:18:57] translated from the from the original
[2:18:59] greek
[2:19:01] see again
[2:19:02] but this man martin luther he saw the
[2:19:04] pillar of fire and the way he went just
[2:19:07] like
[2:19:08] abraham is calling god and he's led now
[2:19:11] a little deeper
[2:19:12] and and so he saw that the just shall
[2:19:15] live by faith this emboldened him to
[2:19:18] resist the church so they protested the
[2:19:21] church
[2:19:22] that's why they were that there's
[2:19:24] catholics and protestants
[2:19:26] protestants protest
[2:19:29] rome
[2:19:30] and her tyranny
[2:19:35] and so again
[2:19:37] you know they become called protestants
[2:19:40] that and he began to preach the just
[2:19:42] shall live by faith
[2:19:44] and he resisted the catholic church and
[2:19:46] he nailed his 95th theses to the door of
[2:19:49] the church
[2:19:50] there
[2:19:51] and
[2:19:52] it was in germany and he said
[2:19:54] salvationism is my faith alone
[2:19:58] the bible is the only authority
[2:20:01] and he began to preach the priesthood of
[2:20:03] every believer
[2:20:04] but it wasn't long until his followers
[2:20:07] camped down there
[2:20:09] you see it was an altar built but they
[2:20:12] camped down there and wouldn't go any
[2:20:14] further
[2:20:16] and there sets a big organization a bit
[2:20:19] you know it's kind of like when you go
[2:20:21] to the holy land today over to to israel
[2:20:24] well everywhere there was an event is a
[2:20:26] big church
[2:20:28] a board
[2:20:30] big old building
[2:20:32] hanging over you know they had one place
[2:20:35] they called it the birthplace of christ
[2:20:36] where christ was born in a two well we
[2:20:39] had to wait for an hour to get down
[2:20:40] there because there was a bunch of
[2:20:42] priests that went down in there first
[2:20:43] ahead of us mourning and chanting and
[2:20:45] crying and whatever else because this
[2:20:47] was the birthplace of jesus and they
[2:20:49] built this big shrine over it
[2:20:53] well this is what luther did
[2:20:55] he built a shrine over his revelation
[2:21:00] and so they began to they organized and
[2:21:03] god left him there
[2:21:06] i want you to understand god just left
[2:21:08] them there you see the pillar of fire
[2:21:10] moves on
[2:21:12] he don't stay in one place he's leading
[2:21:14] you into the promised land here is the
[2:21:17] land walk you in it
[2:21:20] and so here would go and then what
[2:21:21] happened god called a man by the name of
[2:21:23] john wesley
[2:21:25] and he saw it and the way he went
[2:21:28] and he had a revival then that saved
[2:21:30] england united states john wesley came
[2:21:33] here preached up and down on the up on
[2:21:35] the was going to convert the indians and
[2:21:37] he what goes back and he said i went
[2:21:39] over there to convert the enemy in the
[2:21:41] indians not the enemies the indians and
[2:21:43] he says i was not even converted who's
[2:21:46] going to convert me
[2:21:48] and there he went back and began to look
[2:21:50] at the word of god and said god there's
[2:21:52] going to be more i've got to have more
[2:21:55] than what i've got
[2:21:57] i've been forgiven
[2:21:59] i have been pardoned
[2:22:01] i have been saved from my sins
[2:22:05] but i can't live a holy life there's got
[2:22:08] to be more than that
[2:22:10] i've got to have a holy life i'm not
[2:22:12] living it lord i'm not i don't have i'm
[2:22:14] not able to live it
[2:22:17] and it went back and there he advanced
[2:22:20] further you see seed of abraham he's
[2:22:23] discovered the land because there's more
[2:22:26] than justification in the land there is
[2:22:28] sanctification
[2:22:32] so there would be wesley george
[2:22:33] whitefield and asbury many of them that
[2:22:36] had a great revival and that
[2:22:38] revival inspired new songs
[2:22:42] and as they sung their songs and
[2:22:44] deliverance charles wesley would write
[2:22:46] thousands upon thousands of songs
[2:22:49] what about the blood
[2:22:52] the cleansing power
[2:22:54] the holiness that it brings
[2:23:02] and this is where the church was brought
[2:23:05] to another junction
[2:23:07] and that junction was sanctification
[2:23:11] now remember
[2:23:13] god had told him
[2:23:15] these things and he he brings him to a
[2:23:17] place where he's going to sanctify him
[2:23:19] through the blood
[2:23:22] and i i could go a long time in that but
[2:23:24] i i'm running out of time this morning
[2:23:27] as i said i'm not going to be able to
[2:23:29] get back to it
[2:23:30] or get on to it but it just shows that
[2:23:33] the wheat plants moving back to the
[2:23:34] grain again
[2:23:36] and wesley becomes the tassel it becomes
[2:23:38] a missionary age
[2:23:40] and and there's a missionary sin out
[2:23:42] everywhere and the world gets gets uh
[2:23:45] turned on his ears so to speak
[2:23:48] and he saw the need that he saw
[2:23:49] believers were forgiven of sins but that
[2:23:52] these sinners still needed cleansing by
[2:23:54] the blood and what was missing was a
[2:23:56] holy life
[2:23:59] now
[2:24:00] he saw there was no fruit christians
[2:24:02] were forgiven of sin still living dirty
[2:24:05] lives
[2:24:06] so let's go to hebrews chapter 12 verse
[2:24:08] 14 and i'm going to close i'm going to
[2:24:10] close there we'll reach out shady i and
[2:24:12] i'll close and i'm not going to discover
[2:24:15] all that is there we'll just call that
[2:24:17] part two
[2:24:19] but he goes into hebrews chapter 12
[2:24:21] verse 14 and
[2:24:23] and wesley sees follow peace with all
[2:24:26] men
[2:24:27] and holiness
[2:24:28] without which no man will see the lord
[2:24:32] so he began to see if we're not holy
[2:24:35] if we don't have some holiness
[2:24:38] if we don't have holy works
[2:24:40] the manifestations of this forgiveness
[2:24:43] well then we'll never see the lord
[2:24:47] so he began to preach we got to have a
[2:24:49] sanctified life
[2:24:51] now the way they got the name methodist
[2:24:53] was this
[2:24:55] the name was because john had certain
[2:24:57] methods methods of of getting holy in
[2:25:01] other words he would pray so long he
[2:25:03] would read so much in the bible he would
[2:25:05] witness so much he would do this he had
[2:25:07] different things it was methods whereby
[2:25:11] uh through works that he was doing
[2:25:14] things exhibiting and working as a
[2:25:17] christian in a christian life
[2:25:19] so you know but again he saw this
[2:25:22] revelation again without holiness no man
[2:25:25] will see the lord we've been forgiven
[2:25:27] our sin but if we want to see god we're
[2:25:29] going to have to have a holy life
[2:25:32] so in romans chapter 6 verse 22 and now
[2:25:35] being made free from sin that's
[2:25:37] justification and become servants to god
[2:25:40] that's justification you have your fruit
[2:25:43] of the holiness and the end
[2:25:45] everlasting life
[2:25:47] so he said you may have been made free
[2:25:49] from sin but you've got to have the
[2:25:51] fruit of holiness
[2:25:53] a second corinthians chapter 7 verse 1
[2:25:56] heaven therefore these promises dearly
[2:25:58] beloved let us cleanse ourselves from
[2:26:01] all filthiness of the flesh and spirit
[2:26:03] perfecting holiness in the fear of god
[2:26:07] so again he sees another scripture we
[2:26:10] we've got to apply the word and the
[2:26:13] grace that is given to our lives we
[2:26:16] can't just say god forgave us of our
[2:26:18] sins and we're still smoking and
[2:26:20] drinking and lusting and
[2:26:22] adultery we've got to be sanctified
[2:26:24] there's got to be an application of this
[2:26:27] word
[2:26:28] to our lives
[2:26:30] so he he would say
[2:26:32] so again and um
[2:26:35] first peter 1 15
[2:26:37] but he that has called you is holy so be
[2:26:40] you holy in all manner of conversation
[2:26:44] now that that means manner of life and
[2:26:46] all your ways of life be holy because
[2:26:49] it's written be holy for i am holy
[2:26:53] so you see it was on these scriptures
[2:26:56] that he would build an altar
[2:26:59] and he would find a well
[2:27:02] and it would be a well of life
[2:27:05] but it wasn't the original grade
[2:27:08] it was
[2:27:09] it was the stage of the journey
[2:27:14] so again when those early methodists
[2:27:17] were sanctified i just want to cover
[2:27:19] some of this for a minute you just have
[2:27:21] to bear with me you know when the early
[2:27:23] methodists were sanctified it was an
[2:27:25] experience
[2:27:27] i said it was an
[2:27:28] experience they shouted they danced
[2:27:32] as they rejoiced some passed out others
[2:27:35] shook
[2:27:36] they were called quakers on account of
[2:27:38] it
[2:27:39] they'd get under the spirit
[2:27:41] under the waters of life and they would
[2:27:43] shake
[2:27:44] in the spirit
[2:27:47] and they lived holy lives they practiced
[2:27:50] living right living clean
[2:27:52] tobacco was gone from them alcohol going
[2:27:55] from
[2:27:56] you know adultery gun from them
[2:28:01] gone was luther and his beers
[2:28:06] you see what i'm saying i've been here
[2:28:09] here again we we've moved we've advanced
[2:28:12] and
[2:28:12] and let me tell you john wesley in his
[2:28:15] journal he defended this very emotional
[2:28:18] outburst at the second blessing this is
[2:28:21] what it was called you were blessed
[2:28:23] first
[2:28:24] like faithful abraham you were blessed
[2:28:26] at justification but here's the second
[2:28:28] blessing and the second blessing god
[2:28:30] will sanctify you and when it does it's
[2:28:32] the spirit of god kept upon you
[2:28:33] cleansing you
[2:28:38] and john wesley defended this emotional
[2:28:41] outburst
[2:28:43] that they would get this is from his
[2:28:44] journal i want you to listen to it the
[2:28:46] danger wrote wesley talking of outcries
[2:28:49] and convulsions and dancing visions and
[2:28:52] trances and the like he says the danger
[2:28:55] was to regard them too little
[2:29:00] to condemn them all together
[2:29:03] to imagine they had nothing of god in
[2:29:05] them
[2:29:06] and were a hindrance to his work
[2:29:09] whereas the truth is god suddenly and
[2:29:12] strongly convinced many that they were
[2:29:15] lost sinners the natural consequences
[2:29:18] whereof they had sudden outcries and
[2:29:20] strong bodily convulsions
[2:29:24] two
[2:29:25] to strengthen and encourage them that
[2:29:27] believe to make his work more apparent
[2:29:31] he favored several of them with divine
[2:29:33] dreams and others with trances and
[2:29:35] visions
[2:29:37] and three which i don't quite comprehend
[2:29:39] this and maybe some of you might but he
[2:29:42] said in some of these instances as a
[2:29:43] time nature mixed with grace i don't
[2:29:46] know what that means number four satan
[2:29:49] likewise
[2:29:52] mimicked
[2:29:53] this work of god that's right
[2:29:56] in order to discredit the whole work
[2:30:01] and yet it is not wise to give a part
[2:30:04] any more than to give up the hole
[2:30:07] as far as at first it was doubtless holy
[2:30:10] from god
[2:30:12] it was partly so at this day it is
[2:30:15] partly so at this day and he will enable
[2:30:17] us discern how far in every case the
[2:30:19] work is pure and where it mixes or
[2:30:21] degenerates the shadow is no
[2:30:24] disparagement of the substance nor the
[2:30:26] counterfeit of the real diamonds
[2:30:30] this is wesley's notes
[2:30:33] amen he realized yeah there's being
[2:30:36] impersonations
[2:30:38] but that don't take away from the real
[2:30:42] amen now remember i told you last uh
[2:30:45] last april of buddy robinson's
[2:30:47] conversion and he was he he again was an
[2:30:50] uh methodist i think he actually
[2:30:53] gravitated to the nazarene a little a
[2:30:55] little later they were kind of twins
[2:30:57] they were very similar beliefs like some
[2:31:00] of your pentecostals
[2:31:02] and you know will have similar beliefs
[2:31:04] with others
[2:31:06] and he said i believe that getting
[2:31:07] religion is the finest thing in the
[2:31:10] known world
[2:31:11] after a hop skipped and jumped and
[2:31:13] shouted at the midnight i would jump the
[2:31:16] mourner's bench from one side to the
[2:31:18] other all the time telling the people
[2:31:20] i'd got religion
[2:31:22] well thank the lord i'd got religion
[2:31:24] sure enough and it seemed like religion
[2:31:25] had got me
[2:31:27] after shouting until about midnight i
[2:31:29] went down to the ravine and threw my
[2:31:31] revolver away i kindled a little chunk
[2:31:34] fire and burnt my deck of cards then i
[2:31:36] crawled under an ox wagon and laid down
[2:31:39] on the bare ground and placed my hat on
[2:31:41] a chunk for a pillow i did not go to
[2:31:43] sleep for sleep and left the country i
[2:31:45] laid there and laughed like a boy at a
[2:31:48] circus i was almost tickled to death
[2:31:50] every burden gone my guilt gone all
[2:31:52] sorrows sadness gone i forgot i'd lived
[2:31:55] in poverty i thought i was dressed like
[2:31:57] the angels while my heart was turning
[2:31:59] somersaults i was laughing like a boy at
[2:32:01] a circus i was one boy that kept company
[2:32:04] with his religion the very first night
[2:32:06] that he got it i felt that night as
[2:32:09] though i would never be sick sad
[2:32:10] lonesome hungry or in trouble it seemed
[2:32:13] to me that heaven was three feet away
[2:32:21] you can't say those experiences wasn't
[2:32:23] real god met abraham at every stat at
[2:32:26] every station at every station the
[2:32:28] church has built god met up there but
[2:32:31] they built
[2:32:32] [Music]
[2:32:34] an altar there and stayed
[2:32:43] and then
[2:32:44] he was led
[2:32:46] to el shaddai
[2:32:52] and that's still the place
[2:32:55] i don't care what message theologians
[2:32:57] will tell you
[2:32:58] that's still the place we're at today
[2:33:01] because we will nurse on el shaddai
[2:33:03] till our bodies are changed
[2:33:10] and el shaddai
[2:33:12] is
[2:33:13] the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:33:16] that you need to keep nursing from
[2:33:30] let the musicians come now
[2:33:36] i have went through this very slowly
[2:33:38] very methodically
[2:33:41] very carefully
[2:33:44] trying to let you see
[2:33:46] the progress to where we're at
[2:33:50] he said brother tim we're
[2:33:51] we're up to elohim
[2:33:54] where the hearts are discerned that's
[2:33:56] true
[2:33:57] but that's just another unfolding of el
[2:33:59] shaddai
[2:34:05] and our hearts have been discerned
[2:34:07] and a message for the body change has
[2:34:09] come
[2:34:11] but we nurse on el shaddai
[2:34:15] until our bodies are changed
[2:34:21] i want more of you

[2:35:29] of the word of god
[2:35:31] and grabbed a breast of denomination
[2:35:33] that they come off of
[2:35:35] but there's a real seed
[2:35:38] that's going to nurse on the breast
[2:35:40] [Music]
