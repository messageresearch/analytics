great name your god you never change in jesus name amen amen amen god bless you i'm going to let you be seated at this moment amen thankful to the lord for his goodness his grace his mercy to us amen for all that he is doing and has done amen we want to thank you the the church the sisters everyone who donated gave time money expense whatever anyway to the sale yesterday they they got nearly 80 to a little over 8 200 and that'll take care of the appliances needed for the pavilion amen so we appreciate that and god bless you thank you for your efforts and what you did amen we really really thank you for giving to the lord also i i wanted to make uh mention that we are going full steam ahead with the um translations of brother branham sermons into the japanese language these are uh can be found on the message hub and you can those that are interested in those translations can go there and find them and and i just got a picture as i do seem like every sunday from the group there in japan as they sent us a photograph of their gathering and they continue to to gather and worship the lord as um as uh things go forward and continue adding to souls to the kingdom and we're thankful for that they look just like a lovely lovely group of people and also um we uh you know as you remember we had planned to go to japan and on to the philippines uh but due to brother ron spencer's bout with cancer and then the covet fell right on the heels of that and they were already stopping boats and and quarantine and whatever in in different places we didn't want to get stranded in the country so we canceled the meetings there we had a miracle that actually happened and you you all have heard how the airlines are hurting for for business and they the delta airlines did an unheard of thing they refunded to us twelve thousand dollars worth of tickets and uh so we got all of that back so that we can use it for the kingdom of god and as you know in february i was supposed to be in japan and we went instead to brother ron spencer's and i met there with brother donnie reagan and we had prayer for brother ron and while i was there you recall a japanese professor who was streaming the service he got saved that night and and since that time now this is the miracle of it since that time it is reported there have been 12 professors that have been saved five of which are japanese and just last night a couple of the professors were streaming brother jason jackson who was a guest minister at brother ron spencer's and they were translating the sermon live into the japanese language and also reportedly some other languages as well i understand portuguese different languages that they that they speak and we're translating into them and at the end two two of those that were listening in screamed out that they wanted to be saved and so you know we just continue to see the lord do mighty things and look like sometimes satan blocks us on one side and god's just got a bigger and better plan amen because he's unstoppable and so is his bride amen and so you know as you know [Music] in july brother ron came here on a mission to get to jesus and since that time he has been preaching with with great power and great anointing he's not missed a day of work due to sickness and on november the 11th coming up uh that's um uh what is it armistead's day brother ron is again to have complete body scans and we just want you to pray with us concerning that for a total deliverance and um i wrote this down this morning and thought i was going to be sending it out to the airways but i've got a word for kenneth middleton who's here this morning god bless you brother kenneth amen welcome in the name of jesus amen i and that word is don't give up on the harvest two years ago in october he was given up to die and doctors had advised to call the family in and even his son came from montana we went on that sunday to pray for him after we'd had a powerful service where i was preaching on the new birth of malachi 4 i think it was part three of that and all of us ministers here went to went to pray for him we stood around his bed and had prayer and and then you know i was i was talking about the power of our christ and the authority of believers and our position and where we stand and and um and so after prayer asked him to speak them what he desired and he said to be in church on wednesday night for the october meetings and he he was there for the entire october meetings a man who was on his death bed that they'd call the family in on sunday and then there on wednesday he's in church wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday amen and um you know a little later the cat the the doctors gave him a report that also his cancer was gone since that time brother brother kenneth has been instrumental in leading his grandson timothy here to christ and he's a he's a bright spot in our services i rejoice every time i see him sitting there on on the front row and and you know just believing um you know this is part of the harvest i'm talking about you know um you know god's kept you here brother kenneth for a purpose amen and this is part of the purpose amen this week brother kenneth got a report his numbers were back up and the doctors said they also have said they can do nothing for his heart condition but let me just say it again don't give up on the harvest we're in an hour that god is doing great things amen and just to see you in church today is a great thing and it tells me you hadn't given up amen so let's continue believing praying and expecting amen and if god does call one of us home here there well we'll just meet um in the in the on that great morning that morning bright and fair amen when the last phase of the rapture sounds and the trumpet of god sounds and the dead in christ rise and we go to meet him in the air but if you're praying for a promise of god to be manifested then i urge you also don't give up on the harvest if you if you've been barren keep on believing for a baby don't don't give up believing the angel is about to return amen if you've had a need in your body if you've got loved ones that have been lost and out there if you've got situation financial problems whatever it is lawsuits that's against you the devils come on every side just don't give up on believing just hold on you're going to reap if you think not amen you don't give up on the harvest we're on the threshold of many great things many great things we as you know in 1933 brother branham had seven continuous visions and you gotta remember the time era in which he was at it was before world war ii and he in this vision he wrote that mussolini would invade ethiopia and that nation would fall at his feet the vision then went on to show that mussolini would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him then the next the next vision continued or i went into another scene of this of this vision and there was an austrian by the name of adolf hitler that he saw would rise as a dictator over germany and would draw the world into war it showed um you know the the line there how the troops would have a terrible time trying to overcome it and showed them that hitler would come to a mysterious end and of course even today they haven't come to even firm conclusions on where he is what happened where's his body you know or anything the third vision show was in the realm of world politics and it showed that there would be three great isms and uh there would be fascism and nazism and communism but that the two would be swallowed up into the third and then the voice admonish um to watch russia watch russia keep your eye on the king of the north the fourth vision showed that there would be great advances in science that would come after the second world war and it was headed up in a vision of um of an egg-shaped driverless car where that it was just running down beautiful highways so people was you know and it seemed like that the whole car had been rearranged where the people were just sitting together you know playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves as as this car went down the road without a steering wheel and we're right here as you know our technology is there the releases are taking place they're actually driving on our highways it hadn't been released yet to the public but we're right here on the cusp of it the fifth vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centered mostly around women and he said god showed him that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote then they cut off their hair which signified they were no longer the under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights and she adopted men's clothing went to a state of undress until the light the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron and with this vision i saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world and i just want to say to you who would have thought who would have ever thought that abortion would escalate to a high of 1.5 million a year in america that same-sex marriages would become legal and not just legal but forced upon to recognize or that they when just simply filling out a doctor's questionnaire at a at a clinic that they would ask you what sex you were born and then what sex do you identify as we're living in that time it's great time of immorality in the world today then the sixth vision there rose up in america most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power and he said i believe this could be the rise of the roman catholic church though i knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power due to the popular vote by women and then then finally the seventh vision was was he heard a terrible explosion and looked and i saw nothing but debris and craters and smoke all over the land of america and today we face nuclear threats from iran north korea china and russia and we're here at a time you know where um someone said well it is 2020. so all kinds of things are seem to be happening and everything that what we think would go a certain way doesn't go that way and we don't know yet since the elections are being contested but if mr biden wins we will have the first catholic president since jfk and already every supreme court justice is a roman catholic with the exception of one jew so our court is packed the presidency will be a catholic and brother branham when jfk came in he said i don't think mr kennedy will have much effect now because he'll make a wonderful president in order to bring others bringing the others and so you know again we look at that and we think about it we realize you know um jfk is looked upon with honor respect and and great love in in america but he certainly came in and is in a in a place where he made the way for other catholics to come in and and where that we are now totally packed with that now if he wins it looks like that kamala harris will fulfill this and just remember this it's going to come to pass whether it's this election or not but brother branham said in that in the message from that time he said this is a woman's nation it is number 13. it appears in the 13th chapter of revelation 13 stars 13 stripes 13 everything's at 13 everything's a woman and remember thus saith the lord there will be a woman ruled before the end time now watch how he says that she will either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman i seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus saith the lord write it down and find out your young people see if it happened if it isn't i'm a false prophet and and so you know as of course if this happens there's a great likelihood that mr biden will fade quickly leaving uh kamala is as president and this will this will make as brother branham would look and he'd see this woman now it wasn't part of the vision but he he always kept saying even when he wrote this down and he had it that could be the catholic church and she was president or vice president or in some great position and he said i saw the nation bow into her and and as we look at it you know if if this transpires the way it seems to be going we will have a we'll have a catholic president there's a catholic amen and then if she comes in as vice president then we'll have her as vice president and then if he fades off the scene we'll have her as president so no wonder when he's looking at it you know she would be either vice president or president or it could be the catholic church and we're looking right at it and then with this new administration being soft on iran with their insane nuclear deal and soft on north korea and soft on china who steadily became a threat to world peace and unable to stand up to russia as the democrats are gutless liberals who are more concerned about abortion rights and gay rights and the blm movement and their social agenda than they are about america and world peace and in israel instead of becoming a favor and still being a favored nation will become again a hated nation so we are on the threshold of prophecies being fulfilled and i'm going to be speaking this morning on standing on the threshold of full redemption now for this i'm going to be going to the book of revelation which contains end time prophecies that were wrote in symbol form and would remain mysterious until the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound then the mystery of god would be finished or completed and we would know and understand this is why i had the youth choir and jeremy thank you my that was so powerful as you sang together this morning is he worthy so i had them to sing that this morning was because we're going to be looking at the worthy lamb and what his blood of atonement has done for us now i've got a long ways to go and it's already afternoon so um hold your you know be be patient with me but let's stand together as we read revelation 5 and verse 1 and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw an angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of judah the root of david have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and gold and vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue in people and nation and has made us unto our god-kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and i beheld and i and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne the beast and the elders and the numbers of them were ten thousand times ten thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is a lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i say and blessing and honor and glory and power be into him that sitteth upon the throne and to the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever amen may god bless you you can be seated standing on the threshold of full redemption again we posed a question last sunday and and i want to bring back some of that back to your to interview again where is the church standing what what is our position now exactly where do we stand in this hour as we look to the fulfillment of scripture and knowing that we are here in the last days and reading this morning we read of a scripture that is absolutely pertinent to our age and time that if not fulfilled then the rapture will never take place and the word of god will never be totally manifested it must be fulfilled we see that noticing that in the lamb in revelation 5 that he's not an animal this is symbolic and he takes the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and who was it it was the very owner of the original uh the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and there was no angel no angelic being there was no prophet or priest or king who was worthy to take this book and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand and as brother branham would look at this he would describe this as the most sublime which means awesome majestic glorious rapturous thing in the scripture and that that not an angel not anyone could do that the lamb came and took it from the right hand of him that sat on the throne and he's the one that holds it as god's law required a kinsmen redeemer and the lamb came out boldly and said i am their kinsmen i am their redeemer and i have made intercession for them and now i have come to claim redemption rights i've come to claim their rights and that they have a right to everything that was lost in the fall amen and i paid the price my goodness that makes me feel religious don't you amen to to just think it wasn't by good works that we had done it wasn't that we were worthy to take the book but by his mercy in fact for the matter is as i review the scriptures all together and and see what happens in revelation 10 and the little book that's taken out of the hand of the angel christ it comes down with the open book and i and i view that scene and i see john being commanded to take the little book and to eat it that i look and i see back that there was a time he could not even approach the book he wasn't even worthy to look on the book he wasn't able to get close to the book but a kinsmen came a redeemer came and paid redemption's price and what was not john's ability to receive it all now it's just handed to him by grace i want you to know grace is a great thing the favor of god amen where he paid the price of redemption no wonder them elders and the that began to cry out and threw off the crowns and the dignitaries got on the ground to begin to worship him no one could do it he walks right up in the hand of god and takes the book out of his hands and claims his rights and said i've died for them my blood was shed i became a man now if you really look at the scene the one on the throne not another god the one on the throne became the lamb because he's also the lion the king is that right he's the king yet he's he became the lamb amen he's the god of the king of the universe but he became the lamb for us all when i think of the psalm that said who is man or what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that's a prophet that you would visit him amen oh my to think about this what does sublime think the statement or act i have paid it i did it with my own blood and he demand christ jesus now remember he had it as god so it wasn't being taken as as god getting it but he became a man to get it for man is that right amen he has it in his hand and it's been in the hand of god all the time since adam lost it but now it's in the hand of of the lamb the title deed of all creation has was in the hand of god and now the lamb comes to claim it now i didn't come to claim it for angels i want you to know as great as the greatest angels are that the earth is not for them and as several and deceitful as the most wicked angel is which is lucifer amen the earth is not his to possess amen amen you just get a revelation of that this morning you look at your earth and said satan you don't have no claim on me it don't belong to you it's not yours to possess amen but again again you know he didn't come to claim it for angels but he come to claim it for the humans that the sons and daughters of god make them back in position of sonship again you see everything was lost the whole creation trees everything animal life as the bible said they even grown until now because when the god of the earth man fell so did all the creation fall with it but this is all about restoring the god of the earth back to his position again fully redeeming now as we look at this he didn't come to claim it for himself he already had it as god it was his he made the earth it was always his and then he came and he gives the earth to his son adam and adam of course forfeits it and but but as we think of it here he comes and he becomes a kinsmen redeemer in that in the old testament when a man would get in debt and he couldn't pay his debt they would many times sell him his children his and his property and all and to pay his debts but you see there was designed in the law to have a kinsmen redeemer this kinsman redeemer was not only a redeemer he was an adventurer that if you got hurt unjustly and somebody did something maliciously to you it was iron eye and tooth for a tooth even if they if your neighbor knocked your tooth out and and whatever you had a the kinsman avenger had a right to come and knock your tooth out or the the neighbor's tooth out are you with me because he's not only redeemer but he also does the work of adventure and i want you that are troubled to rest with us this morning knowing this that redemption is almost full and it's going to be the time for the kinsman adventure to take his role and pour out the vials on the earth and he will destroy those that destroyed the earth and he will avenge his servants and i just want you to know whatever the devil has done to you he's not going to get by with it because your retreat your redeemer your kinsman is on his trail look out satan here he comes you got every right and every reason to tremble in your boots amen because here he's on your trail now as we think of this that here the lamb as redeemer comes to pay the debts against the book and to lose its seals so that you can enjoy the privilege of its contents and and of course this is this is what brother branham was saying what he says i want to see a church in position said the whole world and nature is growing and crying for the manifestation that word is apocalyptus which means the revelation of the sons of god the unveiling of the sons of god and brother madam said when they're unveiled in this manifestation he said when true sons feel son speak and their words is back say to this mountain let it be so waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god to position in the church god is wanting to place his church sons and daughters of god he said god let me live to see it my prayer is so close i'm only we're on the cusp we're so close even then amen i can almost feel it with my hands waiting for that time when walked down the street and there lays a laying there from his mother's womb silver and gold ever none waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god hallelujah when god will make himself known when they'll stop this sickness they'll stop cancer they'll stop diseases but to do this the lamb had to take the book of title from the one on the throne who was god who he added as god to become a man and claim it as a man for man and since it was closed and sealed then remove those seals and to do that he must take his blood because debts can only be paid for by lamb's blood amen because without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins and then taking that blood erased the death of sins and that kept the book closed to man now we where are we standing where has god positioned us what has the blood done for us when a bloody lamb stepped forth to take the book and loose its seals and confers the title upon us you see it brings us back to where adam was before the fall and where the church was in the book of acts now i want you to understand there's these two distinct places where the first eve stood and the second he stood amen now before the fall where where the first seed stood and before she sold the human race and of course adam went with her for the sake of redemption but before the fall adam was in position as a son of god he operated in faith and with power and authority of heaven and and he spoke and trees moved he commanded and winds obeyed he exercised rights over the animals and called them by name and whatever he called them that was their name and the earth was in in a millennium condition but then sin enters and adam surrendered the title to everything earthly even his own body and it condemned us all to be born in a mortal condition sorry to say but mortality works in all of us and we can we we can get up and make pretensions you know that that you know we're we're priests like melchizedek and we will never die but death works in your mortal being you can preach sermons that you know that you will you will be alive and remain and and and won't see death but death works in our mortal beings and unfortunately the most godliest of saints die but that's not their end for they should rise first remember they come into their inheritance before we do and brother banham said actually they're favored before us amen so you know sometimes we think oh we're the favored one because we get to be alive and remain actually they're the favored ones because they get to move from this dimension into a dimension of the bless where there's no sickness no sorrow no trouble there's no worries about election or who's president or what's happened or the economy or this covet or this or that no misunderstandings no heartaches no separations the title deed to the earth when adam fell went back into the hands of almighty god satan couldn't take it he had no right to it the earth is not his it wasn't made for him but now he has a claim he has a claim because adam the god of the earth has yielded his body and the earth beneath into the control of satan now satan has he's an angel he has no right to the earth for god is its original owner and the earth was for god and his sons to dwell upon so now again satan has no right to men's bodies and satan has no right to mend souls amen for god is the original owner and satan's dirty hands couldn't take it yet he claims it because man surrendered to him so it becomes question and there are depths against it and man is cast into debtor's prison and they're left to work it out by the sweat of his brow and to suffer upon the earth and there on under the under this the slavery and of of sin let me tell you satan is a hard taskmaster sometimes you young people want to try some of that let me tell you you will be a slave try your tobacco you'll be a slave to try your drugs you'll become a slave to it try your sex you will be you become a slave to it all of the things satan is a hard master and there'll be days upon days on days you'll wish you'd never went there because sin always takes you further than you wanted to go now adam lost the title but now jesus the second adam comes to claim it and its redemption means i want you to get what the redeeming of this book means it means all legal possession to all that was lost by adam and eve wow i know that went over your head and you didn't fully comprehend but it means its redemption means all legal possessions to everything lost by adam and eve jesus paid the price by becoming the lamb of god to take away the sin of the world and the legal possession to the abstract title deity earth means that a man possesses everything that adam and eve lost so the great account of redemption shows that the one thrust on the throne holding the book of redemption becomes a lamb as a sacrifice and he's the perpetuation and he provides the blood that wipes away even the stain of sin adam lost the title to the earth it was out of their reach the old testament saints knew little of his content their glimpses of this book of redemption was so limited it was just types and shadows they didn't know they didn't know of a man who would become as it was the lamb and whose blood could cleanse us in the world they only knew a woolly animal and that blood could only cover sin but it could not it could not annihilate sin it could pardon sin but could not justify them and the nature of that lamb could never come back upon them so they could never be innocent they would get the lamb and offer it only to go back and do the same old stupid things again they knew nothing of grace but only of a law that condemned and it was precept upon precept and line up online and they so feared it that to even pick up a stick on the sabbath day would be a mortal sin to them their sabbath was a day and it wasn't a rest day it was an arrest from sin their circumcision was of the flesh and it was not of the heart by the holy ghost their land was but a physical land and not a place of god's presence and when they died there was no clear view of life everlasting think of that i mean to preach a funeral as it was in the in the old testament you had no promise of resurrection there was debates in question and there was no real assurity of anything you know there was no clear view of life everlasting one that died they couldn't go into god's presence either for the blood only rolled forward their sins to be dealt with when the true lamb of god came that could take away the sins of the world so they still they went to the grave with their sins simply pushed forward till the judge came there were old testament saints they waited in a place that jesus called abraham's bosom it's called also paradise it awaited the souls of men and women and they were held there the bible said they were captive he said he led captivity captive so they were captive they were waiting for someone to come pay sins debt so they could go into god's presence and it appears that they were and i and i and i'm venturing a bit without a without authority today but it just appears that they were in unchanged bodies as samuel was seen as an old man this place is known as the bosom of abraham or abraham's lap it envisions you know where a child is taken and comforted in the in the arms of a father and this is where that the old testament rested and waited for the blood of the true lamb would come and take away sin it's called abraham's bosom because they rested upon the hope that one day a redeemer would come the seed in which they were all be blessed and so they took comfort in we're abraham's children and there's a promise given to abraham and and so therefore since where abraham's seed will rest in the promise given to abraham but i want you to know that day on calvary jesus wiped out the death of the dead saints those that were waiting and they rose with him in a glorious triumphant moment i want to say that it made no difference whether they were in the land or out of the land whether but if they were under the blood covenant of god of the woolly lamb are you with me that day when jesus rose he raised them up with them having paid completely the debt of the old testament saints and there was not one of them left in that prison house but god emptied paradise and they rose with him and ascended with him into his presence debt-free hallelujah their sins gone dealt with amen no more an old samuel in an old body waiting for redemption claims but that day on calvary jesus paid sent debt and wiped out the debt of every child of abraham and they raised up with him according to matthew 28 they went up and rose with him in the glorious triumph brother branham will describe in the entire message the excitement of abraham sarah daniel daniel was not was not buried in the promised land by the way he he was buried down in babylon he was out of his own desire he was taken down there amen it's just a type it's a type we've got to be buried in christ but all of them didn't have the privilege of being buried in the promised land jeremiah was taken out of the promised land died down in egypt all different ones and as far maybe as law they were condemned but that day on calvary it changed things forever for them amen and now now it was that that they were raptured up to with the lord amen and brother branham would describe it in the psalms and he said you know that that the heavens would would scream out the angels who is that king of glory and the old testament saints would rejoice back and say the lord triumphant in battle he is the king of glory open up your gates amen and let the king of glory come in what a marvelous moment that was and the book of titles that was against him oh hallelujah was totally cleared of every sin debt hallelujah and for the living although the anointed although the holy spirit had anointed men never had the holy spirit abode in men and they would abide on moses and would come down and leave and moses just be a man again and there he'd get angry and sin and keep him out of the promised land and you know he you know the anointing would come and it would go a lot a lot of like a lot of people today who aren't sealed with the holy ghost they'll get the anointing will come down and bless them oh and next thing you know they're back in sin again and then repent and come back but i want you to know let me just tell you friends that the holy spirit has promised us we'll seal you until the day of redemption before the living although the holy spirit had anointed men never had the holy spirit abode men but now god came and dwelt men in the upper room as 120. here comes that great pillar of fire the same one that had led to children of israel the same one that had guided the prophets the same one that had done that had come and abode in jesus and you didn't see the pillar of fire since it way after it came and abode in jesus until he left and then when he left he sent back the very pillar of fire amen the presence of god the holy spirit to come down on the day of pentecost and there he provided that every child of god would get a portion as the fire gave birth they became sons of god sons of god another son of god another son of god and another son of god as it went through like a rushing mighty wind [Applause] when god's newborn sons walked out of the upper room filled with the holy ghost amen let me tell you quite frankly the devil didn't know what to do with them amen it was a power that the devil couldn't stop no more was there a betrayal or a denial come on somebody but now there were men and women who were no longer fearful and afraid but with boldness would go out and speak the word of god the wondrous works of god began to issue out of their mouths [Applause] it was manifested in speaking in other languages as words came out speaking of the miraculous power of god now keep in mind this new testament church was unique it was one of a kind it was a seed church it was a mature church an elect church one let me just say it this way one that would not be seen again until the church returned to the seed grain in the last day the second age wouldn't be the same the third wouldn't be the same but rather the seed would go down into the ground because satan again beguiled the church this one was unique and one of a kind they were endued with powerful on high they were baptized with the holy ghost and received the received power and and the spirit that now indwelled them began to speak out words of eternal life and then peter then got up and he began to speak words and i want you to know that there wasn't a presidential speech there wasn't something from a great oracle they were something from from from god they were life empowering words life-changing words words that was once received in the heart would change that person forever amen repent every one of you you would say and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now power in the form of words flowing from the sons of the second adam spoke to fallen decrepit cursed crippled beggar and the same power that adam used over nature that made winds obey him amen to place a tree here or there to dress the garden and by which he controlled eden it is it is this begin to work now through the lips of sons of god the children of the second adam let me tell you they received an abstract title deed that means their debt was cleared it didn't matter whether mama did it or the daddy did or their grandparents or somebody in the past did it they were that was clear amen amen to think think about it they had every one of them received an abstract that means god searched them and found that they had genetic connections to the lamb before the foundation of the world and they were his and everyone that was kissed he sealed them to the day of redemption having wiped away all of his 10 folks death [Music] [Applause] these words would be the same words like the centurion recognized and realized that jesus being the second adam standing in position and authority in the place that he was like no other man the centurion realized that all jesus needed to do would just speak the word only and his servant would live amen he he they would be the same as jesus was where he cast out spirits with his word and healed all that were sick and this is what set him apart from all the rabbis and the theologians and the denominations of that day they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power and let me tell you something every son and daughter of god when the true church stands in her position i mean she will preach the same doctrine and it will be with power that no devil can withstand and by their word cast taken out [Music] the bible said in luke 4 36 they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they came out amen listen don't play with devils don't just say i'm going to whip you that'll just make him mad don't broke at him and and and then just tell him where to go this is what jesus said for you do he never told you to to to poke out a serpent i rebuke you i rebuke you i rebuke you he just said cast them out and go on believing that the word you spoke is going to come to pass because all of heaven is behind those words as a son or daughter of god this is what we saw coming out of the upper room men with power endued from on high and they would speak to a fallen piece of of human soil and crippled limbs would snap and ankle bones be put into its place and they would tell how it happened by faith in the name of jesus and the authority given to us by our father because we are sons of god this man was made strong and completely healed amen this was a refreshing that came from god's presence that blotted out sins and generational curses and then peter declared a word that would instantly and automatically change a person's nature for through repentance and turning to god amen and and he preached that you too can receive this refreshing hallelujah and i read in the bible that even when they were threatened how many of you sometimes feel threatened in this age i mean you feel like there's pressure against you the enemy's against you in every kind of way and you feel threatened feel like the satan is just closing up on you well that day when they arrested them and commanded them not to preach or teach anymore in the name of jesus christ amen he they began to gather together and they began to pray and as they prayed the house where they were city were moved and they were filled again with the holy ghost i'm telling you it's a time that we're living in that we need a refreshing from the presence of god for people who are threatened people who are being abused people who the enemy has come in like a flood against them for them to take their stand and their bow up on their knees and call out unto god until the until the house moves amen and until the place is filled with the holy ghost and they are refreshed again in the presence of god what we needed evening like tabernacle today is another refreshing from the pulpit or shall i say from this back wall to that back wall wherever you're at in the booth or right there in the mezzanine or sitting on the back row or the front row or the middle or wherever you are it's time for refreshing from the presence of the lord peter declared that a word could instantly and automatically change a man's nature think of that reminds me of here not too long ago i sat down with a man and his wife and she was going through a terrible nervous breakdown didn't know which way to turn and i just sat down beside her and began to speak to her and began to talk about the spirit and the soul and began to place some things far into scripture and with a word i put her nature right back in place your spirit can all get all out of whack your soul never does it's constance it's confident once it's sealed it's sealed the devil can never break that seal amen but i tell you your spirit can get all out of whack and your emotions up and down and things of life can get you all torn up but the holy spirit in just one moment can take your spirit and put it right back in the socket of your soul where it belongs by coming into this rest it would give power over sin unbelief sickness and devils we found that sin could not stay in their presence or in their midst without being exposed and dealt with words that were spoken from the mouth of a son of god would bring would bring hypocrites swift judgment the same thing would happen in the book of acts down in cyprus where elements tried to hinder the word of god coming to a predestinated seed and the governor sergius paulus of the island of cyprus wanted to hear the word and and this false prophet elements opposed opposed them and and tried to turn the governor from the faith and paul's standing there filled with the holy ghost he looked straight in the element's eyes now i remember that at a youth camp here some time ago going down kneeling right down over a young man that was withered on the floor saying every kind of thing out of his mind and locking my eyes on his and taking control of the spirit that had him bound but let me tell you in this case this was a man opposing the work of god hindering the seed of god from coming in and paul looked upon them and looked straight at elements and said you child of the devil an enemy of everything that's right you're full of all kinds of deceit and trickery will you stop perverting the right ways of the lord and he said now the hand he began to prophesy words came out of his mouth and he said now the hand of the lord is against you you're going to be blind for some time not even to able to see the light of day and immediately mist and darkness come over him and he groped about seeking for somebody to lead him by the hand and when the governor saw this happen he was amazed about the teaching the lord and believed you remember i read this last sunday in the message communion it struck me as i had studied the message and went over it many years ago now and and and was able to finally after years of not having everything in print and years of not having it available and i haven't every sermon and i finally get it and i go through i go through those things that the prophet taught and i take it one service after another in chronological order from 63 through 65 and i get down the end i said well lord you know they say it all changed down to the end and he had you know that that the some of the things that we hold to it it's all changed what about it god i'm going to go to this last one the communion service and brother branham says in there you know the hour will soon arise that right among us will be the holy spirit speak out like it did in ananias sapphira remember the hour is arriving the hour is arriving for the holy spirit to speak out it don't just have to be it another nice sapphire it could be the need the need to do a mission trip to japan and god put ten thousand dollars in our hands and three thousand more for for personal money for the ones going it could be just that amen but the holy spirit will speak out like it did and ananias far remember that the hour is arriving remember that that god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now and that's still true nearly 55 years later god declared i'll have a bride i'll have a church without a spot or wrinkle or any such thing i'll separate the truth from the pretenders the end time harvest is a time of separation where where the tares are gathered and and bundled you see we're we're in a time where that god's doing a great separation sometimes we don't want to be different we want to be like the rest of the world but to be like the rest of the world is to be bundled with them god made you to be different he made you to be a peculiar people and the bible tells us that these newborn sons whose debt was clear who is now speaking as adam did in the beginning i want you to get it they were right on the cusp of themselves being changed in fact to the matter is paul when he preached it he didn't even have in mind at seven church ages later he said we which are alive and remain brothers i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep they were right on the cusp they were on the brink they were about to step from mortal and immortality their their debt of sin was paid they had an abstract title deed i just want to want to go through some of this many sick people were healed by peter the bible said they didn't then you find that they would arrest them and the apostles were freed from prison by angelic intervention amen later you know the angels angels was common come on you say well brother tim we must not need angels the bible says that when jesus was tempted of the devil that angels came and ministered to him also at gethsemane for the very thing he would have to go through angels came and strengthened him for gethsemane i'd say we still are are ones that need not only need but will have angelic visitation amen because if this is where we're standing where they were standing then hallelujah then angels ought to be seen among us and you even the common man or woman ought to be experiencing visitations and brother branham would tell you often make your house ready for angels to visit angels attended peter paul other disciples the bible said that they laid their hands on the apostles put them in a common prison but the angel of the lord came in that night and opened the prison doors he can still do it for the chinese brothers he can still do it for the brothers down in iran he can still do it for the persecuted around the world he can even do it for the prison that you're in whether it's physical or spiritual or financial or emotional bondage that you're under this god sends his angels hallelujah i would like to inform you there's an angel in the pulpit a messenger from god telling you you don't have to remain in bondage you can be free amen it's as if it was there standing by peter when he laid there at night between the guards and they were going to make sure that he didn't get loose an angel come along and tapped him on the side and said get up and come with me it ought to be today that we could hear those words to to everyone that is bound for everyone that is afflicted get up from there your chains are off your debt has been paid your sins are gone get up and walk with me and walk out of this prison hallelujah amen i am telling you that the very reason to spear the lord is here the spirit of god is upon me he has anointed me to preach the gospel to set it captive those that are at the liberty those that are captive amen he had denied it a ministry of people in this last day that can set you loose from bondage of drugs a fornication of sin of adultery you name any name that you want to i want you to tell you there is a jubilee trumpet that is sounding in this hour and say you don't have to remain a captive anymore but you can be free from depression from anxiety from the troubles of all that trouble you remember because the angel of god accompanies this message and the angel of god is in our midst tapping you on the side and saying get up from there get up hallelujah it's time you awake like a man awaken out of his sleep and look around and say angels all around us a message is coming this day and it's a message of deliverance hallelujah stephen's great miracles stephen began with faith full of faith and power he was just a deacon they say but he did great wonders and miracles among the people when he was dying he saw a vision oh you got these unbelievers today say all visions are only for the prophet what a lie that is it wasn't in the first church and it won't be in the last church not only will angels accompany the message not only will angels come to strengthen but visions and there dying stephen has that vision of christ it was philip and philip in acts 8 that he would cast out an unclean spirit he went down to samaria and he preached christ among them i you know i think that's it i mean a lot of times we have preached theology [Music] come on a lot of times we've even preached brother branham come on and thank god for a prophet amen thank god for a messenger amen but buddy but peter but philip went down and he preached christ unto them when he would meet with the eunuch the bible said that he opened his bible and preached unto them jesus i tell you it's time that the message believers start preaching jesus again and preach about a lamb that has taken the book and loosed the seal and paid your debt [Applause] i wonder how much of this how much of this theology has got us how far has it taken us people with one accord begin to listen to what philip said and seeing the miracles he was doing because unclean spirits came out crying with a loud voice many that were possessed with them and and many was taken with the palsy and the lame palsy was the paraplegics paralytics and those that were lame were healed this is what when sons of god were operating as sons of god this is where they were standing on the threshold come on i'm telling you this is where they were standing this is where we are standing christ's appearance in the form of a light to paul at his conversion the bible would tell you that that this light that he saw he would say he would say to paul said saul why persecuted thou me can you kick against the pricks and there there is as he was as he was having this conversation with this one in the light and he said who art thou lord come on amen who art thou lord and he said i am jesus that ought to do something to every two lord person around the country and realize there ain't no two lords there's one lord one faith one baptism one god one father of us all [Music] amen where did we get this confusion in this day and hour it's because the serpent has come to defile every and paul would say in first corinthians 15 and 6 and he would witness about the 500 brethren that saw jesus i wonder who greater part remain unto this present but some have fallen asleep and after that it was seen of james and and then of the apostles and last of all he was seen to me oh that's one born out of due time amen now these could say they saw him they saw a physical body they saw him when ascended there was a cloud took him out of their sight there was about 500 that witnessed that paul talked like they were all saved because he said the greater part remain unto this present but some have fallen asleep amen but he said then last he was seen of me i don't know how you feel this morning but we're here in the last race and i want to be one of the last ones that can say he appeared to me too amen that he appeared here and he appeared there and he appeared here and he appeared there and appeared here and he appeared there and appeared to you and to you and to you and to you [Applause] hallelujah and there would be a people who loves his appearing amen shouldn't there be a church in this day and hour a congregation of people a bride around the world who lands for him to appear and can say at the last in the last age in the last time among the last people he appeared to me also [Applause] he appeared and he changed me amen forever paul would have a vision at that time of ananias there's a different ananias ananias would have a vision of him think about this paul he's a new convert just now gets a vision of ananias now he's had a vision of christ now he gets a vision of ananias and then ananias has a vision of saul tells him to go to a certain place to street that's called straight there and then that there you will meet with ananias and paul you will meet together and there this he will pray for you and the scales will fall off your eyes so in the new testament church blind eyes come open hallelujah amen and paul's sight was restored and immediately the bible said fell from his eyes as it been scales and they received sight forth with paul had a vision he would go from there this is one vision of jesus where he meets with jesus and he sees him second well he might not even call it a vision maybe it's an experience then he comes the next one he has a vision of ananias and then he goes into the temple into jerusalem and he's praying in the temple he's this new convert and he said all of a sudden i was in a trance that word means i was raptured up i was pulled into place of ecstasy and he said when i did i saw him come to me and he said make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive your testimony concerning me and he got up right quick and he left from there and he said in his final words as he was leaving he said depart for i will send thee for hints unto the gentiles and little there was aneas who was healed of a palsy he was a paraplegic or paralytic for eight years and peter said to him and else jesus christ maketh thee whole arise and make their bed i want you to understand words came out of a mouth spoken word oh you think you think third pool was just for brother branham i want you to understand the spoken word would be creative in them even in the mouth of moses it would be powerful in the words of in the mouth of joshua hey man we act like it's some new thing this is not something new this is something that happens in a redeemed church this is something that can be expected of those who are standing on the edge of eternity about ready to change from mortal to immortality those that are at a dispensational change dorkus she was a believer and our name was also tabitha she was a woman that was full of good works in arms deeds sometimes you don't think god sees what you've done but he does you can't do one little thing for him except he acknowledges it you can't sing a song about him you young people cannot come and celebrate this great event of revelation 5 and worship god and bless god's people without god taking notice i saw you there i saw you and i've come to reward you hallelujah amen come on if a woman by the name of hagar a bomb's woman who would produce an off race of the israelites and god would take so much concern about her till he would come and appear to her and show her a well or source of water for them to drink and give her a word of comfort and she would say she would name the the well of the god who sees me i see the church ought to come to that well amen what a refreshing night is amen that you come to a point that you know god sees and god cares it matters not only by my bonds woman it matters not if i've been rejected from the church and driven out god cares and god sees darkest or this woman tabitha they come to him they show him garments and aprons and things and clothing for the poor and she's made in the armstreet she's done and peter comes into the room and kneels by her bed and prays lord i commit this little soul now to you as we have her funeral god and we bury her may you be with us and comfort the family that's not what he did he stood on the authority of who he was and he called her by name and said tabitha i say to thee arise and a woman who had been dead opened her eyes and sat up this is a new testament church amen this is a church standing on the threshold of full redemption with a book open and a title cleared cornelius a centurion has a vision now he's a roman but he has a vision he's not even christian and he has a vision and he saw the vision an angel he even gets an angelic visitation in a vision come on and and again the words keep thy prayers and their arms or come up for memorial before god god says i remember what you done for my people i remember your prayers i heard them i take notice of them and i'm letting you know i take notice of them and i'll tell you what i want you to do i want you to send to joppa and i want you to call for a man by the name of simon whose surname is peter and they he he lodges in a in a house of one called simon the tanner i stood there at that house a few a couple of years ago now a man and there this this is houses by the seaside and he shall tell thee what you ought to do well you know it wasn't just it wasn't just cornelius that needed a prompting it was old it was old a peter that needed a prompting you see there was some things that wasn't open yet that they hadn't seen in the book and they didn't understand the mystery of the gentiles and the jews being one body so to them that the the gentiles were off-casting they were unclean you were talking about unclean and or outcasts or are prejudiced you didn't eat together you didn't touch what they touched you didn't you didn't speak yet what do you think the woman at the well said to jesus is it customary for you being a jew to talk to me a samaritan a woman you're not of our race prejudice is old it's not a day it's not just a problem for today it's always been because when men's hearts are evil there's prejudice and one thinks he's better than the other and everyone wants to say they are the god race and nobody else is in part it has anything so the whites want to be superior and then the blacks want to pretend they're superior and then the spanish want to get on their game and the arabs want to get on their game and of course the jews have always been on that game right amen but i tell you when when we talk about another race it's called the god race [Applause] and there's no black and there's no white amen and even we don't side with black and white because they're black or white we side with the word every time are you with me amen but peter you know the book has got to be open to him that that has been paid so god takes and he says okay peter i want to show you something that you ain't never seen in the book amen because i want you to look upon its contents look in here and as he watches he sees he see he sees a vision now i want you to get back to this because not just special prophets are having visions but peter ananias paul cornelius and if you're new testament saints it's possible for you to have a vision too and the next day about noon you know cornelius is nearing joppa taking him a while to get there and peter he goes up on the flat roof and he's hungry he wanted to eat so they were preparing some lunch and he lays back down and just kind of drops off and and as he does he falls into trance into an ecstasy a vision and he enters into another realm and in this realm as this heavenly realm opens he sees there's something resembling a large linen tablecloth and it's being let down to the earth by four corners and as it floats down from the heavens it holds many kinds of four-footed beasts and reptiles and wild birds so there's all kinds of things creatures that are crawling around there and the voice says to him peter arise go and prepare them to be eaten he argues he argues with the voice he said i i can't do that lord for i've never eaten anything forbidden or impure according to our jewish loss and the voice spoke again and said nothing is unclean if god declares it to be clean amen and and he said the vision now repeats through three times and suddenly the linen sheet snatched back up into heaven and he's he's stunned by the vision he's wondering what it means and three no three men are standing at his door knocking three times three men amen and you know he finds out and then he hears cornelius saying an angel visited me this is what he said and he sent me to your house to the house of one simon the tanner to find simon also called peter and peter began to tell him the way of life and did anybody ever read that in the bible while peter spake these words the holy ghost fell upon them that heard it words came out of their mouth spoken word there would be a man by the name of agabus and the bible said in acts 11 27 that in these days came prophets not a prophet prophets from jerusalem unto antioch now we understand there's only one prophet messenger to an age amen but here in the new testament they had prophets and there stood a man one of them by the name of agabus and he's signified by the spirit to be a great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of claudius and actually the believers was prepared and stored up some food and provided and took care of those that was in the time of drought because of a man prophesying there were prophecies in the new testament church when the book is handed to man and the title is clear and they become inheritors of the promise there's prophecies and prophets amen there's peter and so we already preached got released by uh by angelic and uh you know intervention and then god brought vengeance upon herod because just a few days after that he dressed up in his pomp and his great apparel and and and began to gave a speech and he began to cry out this is not a man there's a god and something struck him and he died right there and crumbled right in front of maul god brought justice sometimes god brings justice fast sometimes he waits until the eternal judgment but he always judges your sins will find you out unless you have a kinsmen amen now there was again again you know that the different ones that like a lame man that was cured by paul and lystra paul and barnabas encountered a man that was that was born from birth he had never walked and he was crippled in his feet and as he listened to what paul preached as he started hearing the word all of a sudden paul discerned that this man had faith to be healed and he said he just shout out you in the name of jesus christ get up and walk and the man jumped to his feet and for the first time in his life he walked this is what happens in a church whose book the seals are off whose debts are cleared you know what happened this made the people there want to worship paul and the heathen priests wanted to offer sacrifices to him so they got bulls and they brought them down into there and they put around their horn wreaths and whatever and they were making this big celebration because they said god has come down jupiter has come down and he's here and this one and that one and we're gonna we're gonna sacrifice these bulls to them and and they they stood there and persuaded them we are not gods we are just men and once they got them persuaded that they were only men they stoned them and left palford dead and drug his body out of the city and left him there laying there dead but that ain't the end of the story the believers came and gathered around him and when they gathered around him he got up and went into the city [Music] a dead man came back to life paul was going down in one city and there was a young slave girl that had a spirit of divination some say it was a spirit of a python it was a snake it was a god that they worshipped and she made great profits for her owners by being a fortune teller she could get some things right i'll tell you that because she went falling along behind him shouting these men are servants of the great high god and they're telling us how to be saved and so you know day after day you know she continued to do this now in a new testament church it isn't men who just in their flesh but it's men who allow the spirit to speak out of them notice it was never peter saying oh now i feel sorry for you i'm going to say rise up and walk it was the spirit speaking out it meant them not operating with human compassion but them operating in sons of god knowing what god wanted done with his word somebody with me and my brother branham would preach this whole thing this whole thought and paul a prisoner of christ said he was a prisoner he said he wanted to he wanted to to cast that devil down he was grieved about it for many many days until one day paul so was so annoyed and the spirit of god moved in him and he turned and said to the spirit and dwell in her and said i command you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her now and at that moment the spirit came out of her well you know the men that that owned a slave girl wasn't happy because their money their money scheme was gone and so they brought great persecution upon paul and caused his arrest and different things he's going down to damascus and again a vision appears to paul by night and said don't go where you're thinking of going but he gives him what we call now the macedonian call and he said there stood a man from macedonia before him and prayed him saying come over into macedonia's and help us and so you know they they go over into macedonia and they find much seed in the place there again you know they get arrested and rather than being down and out about it they take the opportunity to praise god for his goodness and they begin to sing and they begin to praise god in the jailhouse their feet are in stocks and they've been whipped and beaten and they're thrown down in the bottom of the of the cell and they're laid there and all of a sudden an earthquake comes and it takes off their bio their their their bonds and they get up and they walk and you know what it does it brings about the salvation of the jailer who was about to take his life because he would be accountable for these men and him and his house were saved god knows how to get them and then of course there would be cyprus the ruler of the of the synagogue he was the chief ruler he believed on the lord and many corinthians believed and then the the lord spoke to paul by night by vision notice again vision be not afraid but speak and hold not their peace for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt you for i have much people in this city here he comes and said now you stay here and just preach i'm going to take care of you no man's going to harm you because i got a lot of elect in this city oh brother we don't have to fear when when we know god's with us we're in the will of god somebody help me preach now there in acts 19 he finds there a group of people who who have heard about the way but yet have never been baptized in the name of jesus christ and he tells them to be baptized over again to receive the holy ghost and they spake in tongues and prophesied i want you to understand this was response of those whose names were cleared special miracles would come by the hands of paul god wrought by spirit special miracles by the hands of paul so he took from his body handkerchiefs or aprons and diseases departed out of them and evil spirits fled look at this this is where a man standing here they're standing on the brink of full redemption there would be seven sons of skeva that would come and try to use the name of jesus as if it was magic they get showed up they get whipped by the demons amen but what did it do it vindicated paul they realized that paul had the right and the authority to use that name amen and truest it was euducus you know he he was like a lot of young boys except you know he kind of was sleeping in the wrong place he was in a window in the third loft and brother tim i mean brother paul got to preach in a long time and he preached past midnight oh hallelujah maybe i'll do it and he preached for past midnight and when he did you know he just overcome uticas and he he falls and trotters out and falls there on the ground dead but it didn't stop the church neither did they can turn and point fingers at a guy because he had a human weakness come on i'm giving some mercy for some of you that's already went to sleep on me this morning am i may may god perform the most sacred right today that's in the church by us just saying arise and this is what paul did and paul went down and prayed for uticus and raised him up and went back and preached to daylight i'd say after raising the dead you could have license to preach the daylight i wouldn't want to leave that service with you [Applause] amen there would be paul he would go to then journeying toward um jerusalem and everywhere that he met believers in every city and i want you to notice every church has this every city the holy ghost would witness in every city the and saying that bonds and afflictions waste you paul you see prophecy was in every church hello believers around the world amen i wonder what we're missing when we're supposed to be at the brink of the edge of eternity and there again you see you know there was prophecy at every church it comes down to caesarea and it comes to the house of philip the of an evangelist and guess what he has four daughters who prophesied so the spirit of god was moving on men and women it's not just men alone somebody helped me preach amen and then of good then then of course you know as he goes on in jerusalem you know the the the lord speaks to him and says be a good cheer paul for thou has testified to me jerusalem you must bear witness at rome is that right well he needs to get to rome and you know they ain't delta to get on there's got to be a ship that he's getting on is that right amen so you know what they they arrest him they arrest him and he appeals to caesar and god god gives paul an all-expense paid trip to rome by the roman government guaranteeing his safety there somebody help me preach amen because god said you will witness as you witness to me for me and jerusalem you will also witness for me in rome so now paul knows that no matter what he faces on the journey no matter the shipwrecks that's going to come in the way he's going to make it to rome because god said you're going to witness in rome and god said you're going to make it to a rapture hallelujah amen and you know that nothing between here and there is going to stop you no shipwreck no problem no problem too great no situation too hard nothing that you're going through is going to stop you because you have been predestinated on a journey oh hallelujah hallelujah of people predestinated my journey and they ain't enough devils that can get in the storm they ain't enough devils can get in the government and there ain't enough devil that can stop you from getting where you're going because you have been ordained to go there blessed be the name of the lord and nothing can stop you because ain't nothing big enough because there is nothing bigger than your god paul will be put on a ship to rome and he will warn them don't go any further because there's a a storm coming and for friend and they won't listen to him and for 14 days they are driven by the storm they have given up they have lightened the load they have thrown everything over but the men that was on there and there happened to be 276 men on that boat and paul gets down to that place now he also says you know he also knows that he has been sent to rome and the angel of god comes and stands beside him and he said now paul don't fear because you must stand trial before caesar but not only that but god has graciously given you all the men who sailed with you now that was an incredible thing to say 14 days in a northeastern also called a hurricane driven day after day after day where they couldn't tell day from night where they had they had unloaded the ship but god said there ain't going to be one on the ship lost and i'm telling you we're going on this journey we're taking our loved ones we're taking our children mean we're taking all and we got a word from god that said we're going and there ain't going to be one loss we're going to have them all we're taking our mother our brother our sister our husband our wife we're taking every one of them it's a journey a predestinated journey well it wasn't enough for him to be saved for him to cling day and night now onto a a a staffer master the ship just a piece and it's all broken up they're driven on this island but the villagers and the people of that island was gracious and built them a fire to warm themselves because it was cold and paul decided to help out and he went and gathered some branches too and he was bitten by a viper but you see he had already been told you're gonna witness to me for me in rome be of good cheer so instead of getting excited he shook it off in the fire and i'm telling you friends whatever your opposition is today don't get excited just shake it off in the fire shake off that depression shake off that unbelief shake off all of those doubts shake off all that sin that would so easily beset you amen you have been told you were witness amen we are part of a rapture we're standing on the brink of eternity well the governor of that island his name was publis he had a state nearby he welcomed the men because now they thought he was instead of some criminal that had met his fate they believed that he was a that that he was uh uh you know a man of god and so now they're they're bringing him sickness and different ones and he becomes a house guest to publish the governor and they showed him hospitality and his father was laying there in the sick bed suffering from fits of high fever and dysentery and paul went into his room and after praying he placed his hands on him he was instantly healed and when the people of the island heard about this miracle they brought all the sick to paul and they were healed also that ought to be the response when we hear that god heals one then we know he's going to heal me too because god is no he he doesn't show any preference come on he's no respected person so therefore he will not give you a cookie and then refuse to another child something somebody help me amen but he provides it all if he provided healing for one he provides healing for another if he provides salvation for one he provides salvation for another if you say my children he'll save yours too and you ought to get excited about seeing what god's doing because you know you're standing in line for your turn to come but i want to say not only were there miracles and visions and healing and voices and tongues and prophecy but the word of the book was open to them they separated law from grace they saw circumcision in the sabbath as types and recognized their spiritual fulfillments therefore they worshipped on sunday because it was the day of the sheep waving when jesus rose from the dead and they honored god on the resurrection they knew the mystery of israel in the gentiles revealing the mystery of the new testament church as one body composed by both of jews and gentiles and and that we who were gentiles we learned from the open book that we also were abraham's seed by being born of christ and paul would say you see us not to seeds but to seed and that seed was not isaac but that seed was christ and if you're born of christ you are abraham's seed and heirs of abraham according to the promise which means your seed will possess the gate of his enemy hallelujah that nothing not even the gates of hell can prevail against you because you are the royal seed of abraham they looked in that great book of inheritance and with the book unsealed paul can look and say now for them he did for know he did also mark out his copies of himself that they might be the firstborn that he might be the firstborn among many brethren and those that he called he justified and those that he's justified he's already glorified [Music] so paul says you're already there glorified in his presence your sins are gone it is though you never did it in the first place and it's really not as it as a popular saying is just if i had never but it is you never did it in the first place where is the first place you know your life you know your troubles you know what you've been through but i'm telling you when god declares you justified when he takes the bleach of his blood and puts upon you he traces it all the way back to the beginning and he says little child in my mind in my thinking in the first place you never did it and he takes it and he lays it on your adversary the devil and you are free delivered a son of god staying in his presence without spider blemish heaven never did it in his thinking chosen let's go over your neighbor and say chosen chosen and guess what he's not a fickle being that can change his mind about you and you can't go along and make some mistake and him decide to unchoose you you know it's kind of like some grandparents didn't want to hold a grandchild and said you know i i if you'll do this for me and that and this and that and you'll be my favorite you know i i i'll leave you a good inheritance but god says no that ain't the way i do it i chose you and there's nothing you can do to unchoose yourself therefore he said neither height nor death nor nor principality or power there is nothing that can ever separate you from the love of god in christ jesus and he said who is he that condemneth certainly not me is not christ it's the adversary he condemns but not me and whom i say is justified is justified who i declare as righteous is righteous because you never did it in the first place therefore you stand justified in his sight they recognize there was one god and that one god created the earth and he come down in the body of flesh called the sun the father became his own son the son couldn't be his own father but the father created him a body and therefore became the son and all the fullness of god was in that body and the mystery of christ is the incarnate fullness of the godhead bodily was in that book and they would see that the jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new the book was not sealed they understood the mystery then of the church as the bride of christ that she was a wife to the bridegroom they recognized the blood of bulls and goats would never remit sins but only the blood of jesus the lamb and they accepted his blood as atonement and it was needless now to worship and offer thousands upon thousands of innocent lambs because their blood would mean nothin thus they recognize long before luther that the just shall live by faith they believed in a holy life of modest apparel and that men were to cut their hair and women were to have theirs long this was in the book they preached against sexual immorality that only in marriage was it honorable so they taught marriage between a male and a female and that homosexual activity was sinful they preached the mystery of the translation of the living saints at the end time they recognized the rapture was imminent and that jesus would descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the drum of god and the dead of christ would rise first they wouldn't be left out but they would rise first they didn't need the seals opened the book wasn't sealed there was no seals on the book they were preaching from an open book the mysteries were known the message of the end time to return back to the feast of pentecost for an outpouring on on high they you know that's the that's the message the message would be we got to return back to where they were not to something different from what they were you say well brother tim we got something different we got the seals listen to seals only opened up what paul preached when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time they said he they he testified i preached what paul preached whatever he preached i preached that they said we know that and we're resting on that and you can rest on it today that the message that we believe is what paul preached because it's a raptured message and there is no greater message than the new testament gospel message and that message must be preached in the end times so that the end of the world can come and it could not be preached that way with the seals on the book brother branham and souls in prison now he made it very clear and he said you see the seals only declared it for the new testament not for the old and the reason for that is because the old testament debt was paid and the believers they were given an abstract but we in this day because that sin entered back in the picture and the second eve sowed her skirts of purity as paul said they would do he said i fear that as the serpent beguiled eve so will so will he beguile you in his subtility and he began to little by little pulled him away and it was revealed when it was opened up now what they didn't know they didn't know there would be seven ages but they didn't need to know that there would be seven ages god hid that from them amen that was for your benefit that god knew you were coming so therefore he waited there as the intercessor waiting interceding for every age for every one of it because he's a kinsmen for every age and when he comes down to the last day what does he do he takes the book and looses its seals so that the very thing that the early church had we have again that in that book not only are doctrines but there is there is power with that doctrine it's not just a theology it's a word a life-changing word a powerful word that heals the sick that raises the dead that casts out devils that speaks and things happen where sons of god are led by the spirit of god there were miracles coming from this open book the power of the spoken word was happening but sadly as the servant beguiled eve so did the servant beguile the early church and the book became close to man the seal the first seal was a white horse looked like christ it was so such an insidious spirit such a deceiver that it went forth conquering and to conquer it had an ambition to take over the church when it ran out of of its power to do that it morphed into a red horse got the power of state behind it and with the sword begin to kill millions and begin to wipe out the true seed those were the real revelation men and women went down and children went down into death and that sword bloodied that white horse until it became red and further sealed the book it comes on down on down on down until our day and in our day there's a messenger on earth can we look back at revelation 5 as we come to close this morning i'm trying but i'm getting now to the crux of my message because i want you to see where we're standing that we're standing on the threshold of full redemption and i think it is verse 3 that says and i heard a strong angel saying who is worthy what verse is that we can read it all if we need to but verse 2 in the second verse and i saw a strong angel he was a mighty messenger and this messenger began to proclaim he began to preach a message with a loud voice saying who is worthy to open the book this book must be opened amen you see it became the cry of the seventh angel it was his ministry it was his message it wasn't all roberts who was saying who's worthy oh his seals have got to be open it wasn't it wasn't billy graham come on it was another them it was the seventh angel a mighty angel and he began to cry out with a loud voice who is worthy that's got to come this time the book has got to be opened to an end time people it's got to come that we'll know what the seven thunders are amen the voices there that have been sealed up that hold the mystery of those seven seals we got to know this it's rapture now or it's the last days it's the last time who is worthy we i i've looked in denominations and ain't none of them worthy i looked at these great men ain't none of them worthy who is worthy to open the book and to loosen the seals and as he as that cry went out to the earth there was a response started happening in heaven i want you to know heaven has moved in our generation i want you to understand an angel the pillar of fire would accompany this man's birth actually the holy spirit start breaking in the supernatural realm greater than any other age except the first age in the azusa movement a lot of people mock them and make fun of them but i want you to understand they were genuine christians they spoke in genuine tongues not this rattly stuff that somebody beats you on the head and makes you say and jabbers your cheeks do you say something but real tongues prophecies healing supernatural begin to happen an angel will appear pillar of fire over a crib there a light and a young man would be destined would hear voice of an angel saying don't smoke drink defile your body i've got to work for you to do when you're older god would begin to hover over and watch that gift and bring it through all kinds of things he would train this man in different ways you know a word that he would learn you don't listen to the great preachers you don't obey them you obey me he would catch an amoeba down in africa in south africa because he listened to man instead of god he would go through all of these different things that he would he would have to endure he would lose his wife and his little child to teach them you don't even follow after your mother or mother-in-law or relatives or nobody you got to follow me it was all a part of his training and he began to cry out from his earliest change who is were they to take the book these seals must be opened heaven would open and seven angels would step out of it powerful angels catch him up in the midst of it it would be shown that it was shown and displayed the picture of christ over arizona you know that that full run that time and there he would he would it would be shown there told him go back to the east we're talking about we're talking about book of acts go back to the east and preach the seven seals will be open to you night after night the angel of god would come in the room and he would go to preach and he'd say you know i had in my mind to preach this because i don't know what these seals mean and i look to see what the others have said about it and about that time when i was going to make a horrible mistake he came in the room amen and it would be revealed who the horse rider was the red the white the black the pale the book would become open and would show in there yeah god even cared about the souls under the altar that had given their lives down to tribulation and in the in the time of the of the jews for the testimony which they held incredulous stuff showing god is a god of rich in mercy and full of grace a lot more grace than what we ever dreamed and he would open it up the fifth seal and the sixth seal and the tribulation seal and show their 144 thousand sealed into moses and elijah describe and identify their ministries and say here that ministry will come again on two men anointed with the spirit of elijah and during that time a multitude without number sometimes you worry about your loved ones you know you worry about your loved ones not coming into the message quit worrying about it put it in the hands of god amen all i know is i don't know how he's going to do it there's going to be a multitude without number that are saved during the tribulation or they're saved before the tribulation but they but they wind up in the tribulation or given white robes wash their robes more correctly in the blood of the lamb still doing acts of sanctification they're sanctified people in the tribulation but to you you don't wash your robes to get them white to you has been granted a royal grant to be clothed in white linen clean and white which is the righteousness of the saints so the righteousness of abraham and enoch and isaac and jacob not their sins but their righteousness of all the saints of peter james and john and all the new testament and all down to the ages you're wearing it today something old and something new and something borrowed something that don't make me blue because i realize i'm clothed with the faith of abraham the grace of jacob the love of isaac and the perfection of joseph i realize i'm close with the faith of enoch i'm clothed you know my we could preach now i'm clothed with all of them because it's been granted to me that all of their righteousness i would be clothed with with one great baptism of the holy ghost that gives me the right of inheritance to every divine promise and from there brother branham showed us over and over and again the book is open and he said things like predestination and eternal security and correct water baptism and immersion and all these that we have probed at through the years and guessed that now we know because i'm preaching to a people of an open book and the debt of the ages past has been wiped away by the bleach of the blood of jesus and everything that kept them from a rapture is now annihilated and now you have been prepared and marked and called for a rapture because you are on the brink standing on the edge on the threshold of total redemption hallelujah let the choir come back again i want you to stand together with me and worship god just a moment just raise your hands to him and say lord thank you there's a power that's released from this book that healed cancer stop brain bleeds give life to the barren give joy give hope [Music] that you're not in this alone you're not by yourself [Music] he stands in the midst of his church the same yesterday today and forever and here we are with the seventh seal is now happening do you realize that the coming of the lord is happening that's the seventh seal he's broke and broke the silence the on the mystery of his coming he held it a quiet and a mystery for years and years and years but now he's made known to you where you are in time [Music] it's like a person looking at a big map and having no clue of where they're at where am i at this map i see the map i read oh here is here and over there is there and here's this where am i [Music] and you have a messenger sent from god who comes and puts his finger on the map and said here's where you are you're right here in the last age you're standing on the brink of eternity you're about to change from mortal to immortality get ready for your change lay aside every sin ever every way to sin that would so easily beset you go to
