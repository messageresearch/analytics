we're so thankful Lord that we can call upon you in our time of need Lord when all hell is against us we can still believe and all sickness is rising up all around us yet we still believe When sin is manifested on every hand and every way we still believe Lord because that's what we do we are believers Lord we ask father you just help us tonight Lord to step out of the way and be anything we done or said that would not be pleased and that you'd forgive us Lord and wash Us by your blood Lord we stand here Lord just feeling Lord your presence all around us Lord and just ask God that you take control in Jesus name amen amen you turn to Job chapter 23 amen like to say it's an honor to be back home amen seems like it's been a minute since we've been here and dealing with things and our our family we do want to say I don't know I'm sure something may may have already been said but just want to thank even like Tabernacle on the behalf of the wrestler family and for all your love and appreciation that you showed us during our time of loss amen we wouldn't we couldn't do it without loved ones standing there beside us and we're thankful for that for every card every text every prayer amen we're so thankful that we know where our loved ones are that it's not a hope so or a May be but we believe Amen brother Donnie was speaking on Sunday morning at the meetings and he said the devil was really giving it to him you know about the loss of his daughter and and he's just kind of asking why and this that and the other said the Lord just drop something this in his heart said if you could only see her now amen that changes everything don't it amen when you know that where they're at and how that God has prepared a place a prepared a body a amen we got a lot of things to be thankful for amen we're glad to be back from Brother Ron's had a wonderful time there and wonderful meetings and just thank the Lord for his presence coming around and touching hearts and lives trust that he'll do that tonight job chap 23 and verse 10 said but he knoweth a way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold amen we let you be seated tonight just had this thought today is begin to look over some things and begin to come upon my heart i' like to speak to you on tested faith brother Bram would say and Believe from the heart he said when I think what God has put in his church he's put the best that he could find amen the best that he can find he's taken his children and he tests them with an acid test and he places them in in the body of Christ because they're tested and because they believe they went through the trials they've had the experiences they are witnesses of his and know what they're talking about it's not just an intellectual conception but they've been born again of the precious Holy Spirit and time tested and tried until their souls are set Like Flint toward Calvary yes they're time tested they're Witnesses of his power and through that God built building Earth building a bridge from Earth to Glory that the way wayfaring man may come on the highway and sit down under the tree in the cool of the day by time tested materials those who take God at his word no matter what the symptoms are what the circumstances are that never stands in their way amen we're time tested amen children of God I I believe we come from a great heritage a great l of of Faith amen we can read through Hebrews chap 11 about the faith of all the ones of our forefathers who by faith Abraham by faith Sarah amen but God just didn't finish there in Hebrews chapter 11 but he said let us seeing we're so compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us run the race that is set before us now we know every Church ages run their race and here we are amen right down to our La our final our final place and and it's the final leg and it's the final time and we're the final Runners but I believe God has put his best in this age amen that's what you do you know you put your best in a race in a in a relay race you actually put your best in the front and you put your best at the last and that's what God did he came and he gave his best he gave the holy spirit amen to the first age and he came back around and gave it to again in the same power to the last stage amen so we can also run as they ran we could also have faith as they had faith we could also have power as they have power we can also amen see Miracles and signs and wonders as they have seen miracles signs and wonders amen and I'm thankful as we read in this scripture he knows the way that I take there's nothing that we could ever go through that he doesn't know already or catches him by surprise or or he's shocked by anything that we go through but he knows where we going how we're going to go through and he when he has tried me we're going to come forth as gold or come forth as something that is precious in His sight amen you know we can read there in 1 Peter 1 and verse3 it said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us according unto the Lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God Amen that's who keeping that's who is keeping us tonight we're not here because we have in Incredible strength or incredible Stam stamina or incredible abilities we are kept by the power of God through faith under salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be your in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perishes though it be Tried by fire might be found in the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so it's not that we're just going to have faith but our faith is going to be tried amen we're going to go through tests we're going to go through trials we're going to go through hardships and I know every one of us no doubt some of us are in one right now or we're about ready to go into another because life is a series of Trials life is a series of tests it's not a we're not in a time that we can take take our armor off and we can lay it aside and put our Shield aside and our sword aside no that's over in the Millennium that's coming but until then amen we're going to go through tests we're going to have trials we're going to go through problems and situations in our lives and God is going to allow those things to come to see how you will react to them amen you know he said in other place he said When Trials come and the church gets All Shook Up he said it's so easy for a Congregation of people to do that when something don't don't just seem to happen the way it's supposed to be but God makes it that way amen God makes it that way God brings tensions into the church for every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested he lets sicknesses strike you he lets diseases come upon you why to test you and to prove you who you are to show the world that you are truly the Seed of Abraham that if Abraham believed and I'm a Seed of Abraham then I also will believe if Abraham was steadfast and I'm a Seed of Abraham I will also remain steadfast If Abraham endured to the promised son amen and I am a Abraham's seed then I will also endure as Abraham endured amen see he permits it by his own will he permits disasters he permits friends to turn against you he permits all of these things he'll turn the devil loose on you to tempt you he will do all that but take your life he could throw you in a bed of Affliction he can turn your neighbors against you he can turn the church against you he can do almost anything if it's God's will for him to do it that's the key right there if it's God's will for him to do it Satan cannot operate outside of God's will amen so if sickness is upon you then God has allowed it to be thus if you're in a trial then God has allowed it to be thus if you're facing difficulties then God has allowed it to be that amen Satan doesn't operate on his own he's not his own man amen but as brother brand would say he said God puts bits in trouble's mouth amen God put has him in control he's in in God's control amen he said what about Abraham with Isaac on the mountain the one promise that was given and by his loyalty and his knowing and his faith in Jehovah it it's through that and that alone that God looked down and said is shall possess the gates I've sworn by myself and I'll will do these things because he could swear by no greater then if he let Abraham be tested to that final point he will test you and me to that final moment Hallelujah that time of decision when everything is away from you and you have to stand alone yes come on now amen maybe this wasn't what you was expecting tonight but this is what you're getting tonight amen because we come to these places in our lives and God allows you to get to a place that you have to stand alone oh it's easy to stand at a youth camp it's easy to stand in a certain atmosphere it's easy to stand when everybody's shouting and dancing and carrying on but when you're by yourself when you're in the Valley of the shadow of death when you're in the moments that you're being tested till you think you can't hardly hold it anymore God is allowing you to be tested to your your final [Applause] point you have to stand alone stand alone you walk out there and say though God slay me I'll trust him amen that's the Seed of Abraham that's the one that gives the promise no matter what the rest of them say or the rest of them do for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord amen the rest of them said well there's nothing to the experience it's just a bunch of excitement for me in my house we're going to serve God I like to take up with Paul right there and say in the way that is called heresy so worship by the god of our fathers though there be tattlers coming to the church though there be Twisters there there'll be all kind of false prophets and everything amongst the people in the neighborhood or whatever but for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord though all of them quit coming come on now though all of them quit coming amen though all of them quit coming though the church gets cold and indifferent for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord though someone was prayed for and they didn't get well that didn't have nothing to do with it that's right cuz for as me in my house we're going to serve the Lord amen Amen brother Donnie also mentioned down there he said he's down in his basement and he was calling out to the Lord and of course Satan was sitting there as his accus her and was like you know all the things you've done for him and all the meetings you preached and all the people you prayed for and they got well what about your daughter and then she died what about your daughter why didn't he love love her all these things the devil puts in your mind and he said why would you still serve him right why would you still serve him why would you still preach why would you still pray for those that's got cancer why would you still serve him and he said the Lord dropped something in my heart you just wouldn't understand that's right that's right hallelujah amen the devil's ask you why so many times why do you keep going on why do you keep believing when all hell's against you why do you keep standing when everybody else is walking away well devil you just don't understand amen God has put something on the inside of me that's going to remain no matter what happens that's going to remain if this one walks away or that one walks away it's going to remain cuz far as me in my house we're going to serve the Lord sir that's right 1 Peter 4 and12 says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you yeah what is this I was expecting a sunny day today I was expecting the birds to be singing I was and this is strange no don't think it to be strange but Rejoice did y'all hear that but rejoice in his much as you're partakers of Christ suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy amen amen so you can rejoice in your trial you can Rejoice during your time of suffering you can Rejoice because you know if I'm suffering with him I will also be rised with him God's only testing your faith for he loves to do that you've can you know many times you've confessed your sin and you've met requirements that God requires and sometimes he still lay silent he don't always move when we want him to move hello is you know surely if it if this was God would move he would do it but God don't always move when we want him to he's not on our our time frame you know he's on God's time amen he knows the perfect moment he but he sometimes he lays silent but remember faith when God is silent still says God's still God that's so it's being tested but it doesn't matter if this is going on over there that's going over there that's going over there faith says God is still God come on now amen he if he's not god let's just fold up and go home amen we're just we're just kidding ourselves but if God still God then we can still have faith that no matter what I'm going through he's in control of this that way if I'm going through the hardest time of my life and and I don't know which way is up and which way is down am mean you know some people get that way and clouds Pilots new ones especially if they don't understand their instruments and not been trained very much in some of those things you can get in clouds and you can lose yourself you don't know if you're up or you're down or you're sideways that's what causes a lot of wrecks and this is what happens to people because they get into a cloudy moment and they get into a moment of discouragement or moment of depression and they're not used to their instruments Amen to their GPS system and and where their guidance system and they're they're not depending on that but they're thinking I can figure this out and they don't realize they're going for a crash they're going down and not going up amen but if you will begin to realize God is in control whether I'm on the ground whether I'm in the sky whether I'm in the clouds whether I'm in the Stars wherever I am God is is still God Amen so your faith has to stay there it cannot waver from that moment from that place he would say in one place he said if we could all get to a and I love this quote and I don't have it but I just keeps coming to my mind about about the sending station receiving station but he says if we could all tune our hearts today Amen to just this one thought these three words God is God he said what kind of service could we have not God is God yesterday or God is God tomorrow or God is God next week no God is God then if he is God he's God over every sickness he's God over every trial he's God over every temptation he's God over every situation he's God over every circumstance he's God if you met his requirements and you've and you've and you've asked God for if you had something in your heart and you you know you ask God to forgive you and you've met the requirements of his word then he's obligated to bring his word to pass right amen don't back off from it well and said well I I never got I never got I never got healed he said oh you poor weak Faith you poor weak Faith don't believe that if everything's confessed and everything's out and you met God's requirement faith will hold there's nothing will move it he he is and you're sure they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength amen they shall Mount up with the wings of an eagle they shall run and not be weary if they walk they shall not faint wait when you meet his requirements that brings your faith to a showdown God's requirements have been met and you ful fully considered it you've done everything that God's required then your faith rests right here that he is God but you know he loves to test us come on anybody been tested this week you know why he loves to test you because he loves to see the reaction of your faith that when it seems impossible you still believe when it seems like there's no way across the Red Sea you still believe when it seems like those walls are too high and those Giants are too big you still believe when it seems like there's no way there's no cure there's no answer there's no there's no peace there's no there's no happiness there's no joy you still believe God likes to see how you'll react when you say oh Lord I believe you thou My Savior I believe that You're My Healer I believe that you're the one that gives the Holy Spirit the things that I'm requiring you are the god that gives that and then you confess all your sin and promise God what you'll do amen then because it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere God can't use that there's no way for him to use it there's no way for him to answer you cuz he only Answers by faith and then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer when I return shall I find Faith but he comes to return and there's no faith he finds a helpless spineless no good for nothing individual has done give up on God and give up on everything and right there your answer was almost to you if You' have just waited a little longer sometimes well I don't like waiting well that's your problem get used to it I know we live in a a society we don't like waiting my God we don't like waiting 5 minutes for breakfast where or 5 minutes for a coffee right are y'all are y'all here tonight or where y'all at am me we we don't like it we don't I that ain't me you lying hound dog you throwed up enough fuss you carried on enough about having a way I can't believe it's taking this long amen we turn that same attitude towards God and we want it right now we want it right now it's got to happen this time it's got to happen in this moment listen it's not on your time it's on God's time he said the vision May T but it will come to pass amen we if it was on our time the Rapture would have happened a long time ago hello somebody if the Rapture was on a human's determination it would have happened a long time ago if it would happened in 2000 on somebody's wh and said I believe 2000 is a good year for God to come back how how many would be here right now come on lift your hands if you'd have been here or maybe it Go the opposite way who wouldn't be here right now aren't you glad it wasn't dependent on a human thought but God had something else in his mind that's it he had more in his mind than what I had or maybe you had or preacher had amen he has more in his mind so he delays his coming he allows it cuz he's a god rich in Mercy you know what it is he has some tabl set and he's got some plates set there and not one of them is going to be an empty seat and if he has to wait till the last moment he'll wait that's right but it's us it gets impatient like man my goodness why couldn't we get out of here a long time ago yes I would love to be out here a long time ago but there would be a lot of people that sitting here tonight wouldn't be here but God rich in Mercy Hallelujah he didn't leave it up to a Fickle human being come on he I'll drag y'all all the way through this service if I have to he didn't leave it up to a Fickle human being he didn't leave it up to me he didn't leave it up to brother Tim he didn't even leave it up to a prophet but God's got something in his mind he's got a certain time in a certain day it's going to happen it's going to be fulfilled it may not be on my time but when God moves he moves come on somebody you might have been waiting a long time and it seemed like it's impossible and it's passed and there's no way it can happen but when God moves that's right he moves when God moves on a heart he moves on a heart when God changes he changes things amen God can do what he wants to do when he wants to do it he's God on yeah think of the Hebrew children here they was to their last moments but why did they get to that last moment cuz God had confidence in them yes some of us we don't want God to have confidence in US honestly I mean who wants to have the confidence God must have in Ron Spencer God's Got Confidence he's a confident God he's got confidence in this service this evening cuz he's a confident God he knows there's hearts that need to be changed he knows there's people that need to be healed he's a confident God and sometimes he'll allow you to get to your last step your last moment and then he will move amen they knew he was Jehovah they knew he answered prayer they they had heard about all the things whether he would in their case or not it didn't matter cuz they still knew he was God so when they were going to the fiery furnace knowing they were certain of God Amen if that they would they were certain that if God burned them up he would raise them up they were certain because they knew that God would work anything for their good and when we're certain of God we know that God works everything for our good everything for our good so they made that statement we're certain though do what you want to King but heat it up seven times do what you want to we are not going to bow to your idol cuz our God is a God Amen who is worthy to be praised he's worthy of our praise and we're not going to give it as some golden calf or some golden image we're not doing it King I'll tell you what I'll do I'll bind you up and I'll I'll bind your feet I'll bind your hands and I'll throw throw you in the furnace well do what you want to King but we're we're not we're not going to bend we're not going to Bow come on now is there some three Hebrew children here tonight Devil's making threats against you and making threats or do what you want to do devil you can't do nothing unless God allows it to happen and if God allows it to happen it must be for our are good right God is still standing looking there and they were certain he was God but would he move like they thought he would move they didn't know but they walked right up to the fiery furnace right to the last moment and he come riding out of the heavens he had been watching it the whole time hello somebody don't think that God gets a last minute update oh oh I didn't realize it was getting that bad let me move no he's been watching it the whole time he watched it at the beginning when the first log was put on the fire when the first Spark took place he was watching it and and of course the Angels comes said up have you seen he said yeah I've seen it I've been watching it one wanted to go down wormwood he said no ain't for you Michael want no it ain't for you said this is a job for me m

amen here he come he said God let your faith come to that spot where it has to react yes it was job in the old test nobody wants to be job but Satan had come and accused him accused him before God and said well look you got a wall around him you let me get to him and I'll tell you right now he will deny you God said do what you want just you can't take his life see God puts boundaries around your enemy he can only go so far he can only do so much and so he comes and he takes his lands he takes his cows he takes his animals he takes his children he takes his houses he takes everything and then he took must have took all of his friends because then his friends he thought were friends come and accused him of being a secret sinner yeah well this is just the Judgment of God because you got sin in your life how quick somebody's to go that way yes sir you know you face a little problem in your life instead of them coming putting their arm around and say hey I'm praying for you well surely you must have done something you must have done something really bad for you to you know what you're doing you're talking the devil's language that's the accuser that's talking through you amen amen we don't want to be guilty of using the devil's language amen all the that their lives are between them and God the best thing you can do is put your arm around somebody and say hey I'm praying for you I believe God's in this and God's going to bring you through this God's going to help you and and you know but no they want to come and they want to accuse him of this and accuse them of that and accuse them of this well I tell you what if you if God God ain't healed You by of cancer by now you must be a secret sinner really what kind of low down Spirit do you got on you I know where I'm standing tonight amen because but people want to come with these accusations against children of God who are standing in faith right and they want to be the false accuser of the Brethren amen there's got to be something in your life brother Tim or God wouldn't have took your wife or brother Timothy or God wouldn't have took your mom amen listen it might be that God is testing us and you might ought to be happy God ain't testing you that way come on somebody amen we are not to take that part that's right and even his own wife said job man dude you done lost everything Curse God and die yeah it happens like that family turns against you all kinds of things happen but here he is he looked at her and said thou speakest like a foolish woman now you better have a good Revelation when you go talking to your wife like that thou speakest like a foolish woman though God slay [Music] me even if the devil ghes can go past what God Said even if God allows that that to happen though God slay me I'm going to trust him where is where is people like that that no matter what's going on around you and what's happening amen there's a strong amen strong man of the house that'll raise up and say hey amen I don't know what's happening around me things are seeming going the wrong way but though God slay me I'm going to trust him I'm going to put my life In His Hands no matter what job stood Pat said God oh God when a man keeps what God said he certain he's God he has to answer Faith calls him on the scene amen if you've anointed and pray for God is waiting to see what you will believe about it hello God is waiting to see what you will believe about it not run up the next Sunday or run up the next day you see a new healer coming into the city or or another Minister coming to the city and so what but God is waiting to see your reaction on your faith don't walk back the next day and say I feel so bad I don't guess I got healed you're not fit to come up anyhow you're not fit for the prayer line in the first place direct quote sorry you know it's amazing sometimes you can have a prayer line and people and they they'll start telling you all their problems and they don't talk themselves out of the healing before you even had one chance I've seen it happen too many times they start expressing their doubts well I just don't see how this is going to work and I don't see how this is going to be well why are we coming up amen then they come up service after service after service over the the same thing the same thing and the same thing listen God is wanting your faith to react it ain't all about a preacher's Faith it's about your faith we can have all the faith in the world but if you ain't got a lick of faith God can't do nothing for you amen it takes your faith Amen to rise up to the occasion to say this is my moment this is my service this is my time this is my time to Touch the Hem of His Garment amen that's right yes said through circumstances may fall off from the right to the left but Faith doesn't move because you're certain he's God see this is where Faith's resting place it's in his word and the only way you can have faith in his word you got to believe he's God cuz if he's God then his word doesn't fail that's right amen so no matter what happened around you that has nothing to do with his word you understand yeah circumstances has nothing to do with his word sicknesses has nothing to do with what his word says situations around you does not dictate whether his word is good or word is not good his word is his word and God is God therefore we can rest in our trials we can rest in our problems we can rest in our situations that we go through see job knew amen they could come and accuse him and do all the he knew he had made the offerings he knew he had offered a lamb and he had given up the lamb for his children and for his lands and for his own life and he' put it there so he knew he had a clean conscience between him and God I listened to the the the the the the is a disseration between him and his accusers I don't know maybe that's a good word and here here he is and they're going back and forth and they're saying job you did this you must have done this you did this and job would come back and he said no that ain't what it was I offered a lamb yeah do you have faith in your lamb tonight well brother Timothy I am weak I I I i' got a lot of faults I got a lot of failures but what about your lamb have you accepted your lamb have you laid your hands upon the Altar and and become one with your sacrifice and if you have then it ain't about your faults and your failures it's about your lamb and if your lamb is found perfect you will be found perfect that's right and I'm here to tell you we everyone have a 100% perfect lamb he's a lamb without spot without blemish amen his blood cleanses all iniquity it heals every sin and every sickness and every scar cuz we have a perfect lamb job knew where he stood on Christ the solid rock I stand all other grounds are sinking saying he met his requirements if you meet God's requirements these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or dead drink deadly things it shall not harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover be certain of God in your moments of uncertainty you know he go back again said his wife said why don't you curse God and die he said how Satan likes to throw that at you why you're no better than you was when you was anointed by that preacher you're no better than you was when them preachers prayed for you how them preachers ain't right in the first place direct quote it does doesn't matter about that preacher hello it doesn't matter about that preacher it's your faith in the Living God that counts it's not what the preacher is it's what God is the preacher never made the promise God made the promise it's not up to the preacher it's up to God and your faith like we we've mentioned before about the man that was laying at that well and the angel of the Lord would come through and stir the waters I know they want to make it a bunch of hoopla today and say it wasn't so but I I just take what a prophet said he said ever so often the angel would come and stir the waters people got healed I can tell you that guy wasn't laying there for 38 years over some hoopla he had to have seen somebody get healed amen but here he is in this condition and Jesus comes ask him a question do you want to get well well that's a weird question ain't it I mean he's sick he's laid there for 38 years what do you mean do I want to get well but see Jesus knew down on the inside of him it was more than just that question there was excuses laying behind that well I ain't got nobody to take me to the water I I ain't got a certain preacher to pray for me or say something over oh I I a I ain't got to I got to be Anointed with all five times I got to do he had all kinds of excuses but Jesus wanted to just know do you want to get well and this is what his word is saying in this hour do you want to be healed do you want to be delivered do you want to be set free do you want God to move on your behalf then away with the excuses just accept what God Said and go forward with your faith and that what he said that he will bring it to pass that's right it's up to him if you believe but see God does this he tests you God permits you sometimes to get a little worse after you're prayed for just to test you yes the testings and trials of Faith but it's he that endureth there it is hold on take God at his word believe every word of it no matter how what anything else does or anybody else does believe it anyhow no matter what the circumstances look like believe God anyhow those discouragement in times come to every believer to test you and to try you I'm going to quote after quote to see if you really do believe discouraging times comes to every believer to test to try to see if you really do believe every son that cometh to God must be first tested and child trained there will be some of you here tonight no doubt we'll go through that same test if we should call a prayer line I have no idea who's got cards prayer cards no one else knows they're just all shuffled up together and handed you I'll call it from somewhere whatever is on my mind at the time we can't stand but a few at a time anyhow couple dozen maybe we'll pass over all will want to come and you may think listen to this you may think that he has passed you by but he hasn't amen why why would they think that because they didn't get to come in front of the Prophet maybe they didn't get their car pulled they didn't get it called maybe they didn't have their opportunity to speak to him maybe they and they think God has passed you by but he hasn't I said he hasn't he's just testing you just to see if you really believe him or not come on somebody amen many times we think that God's moved on past us amen God will walk on just to see if you really believe he said you notice when you are discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you that's when he can get you if you come to church and say well I don't know I don't know whether I'll get any better or not I I've been prayed for twice he said you might as well go home that's all but when you can cast that aside see God doesn't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy Hallelujah anyhow good quote tonight brother Timothy thank you very much God wants you to be happy brother John le Fontaine used to say that all the time how manyan he's happy will they notify your face he don't want you to be frowning he wants you to be happy a human heart is made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't ever be upset what what oh Lord have mercy Jesus just walk in his love knowing that you're walking with him and nothing can harm you there's nothing present nor powers things future can separate you from him you are in him and he will come and we will never come in by our own will we came in by his choice he elected us he brought us here good lands if that ain't enough to make somebody happy I don't know what will amen you're not here on your own that's right you said I tell you what I got in my car and I drove myself here I tell you right now brother Timothy I am here you are here because God saw you before the foundation of the world and he brought you to this place Hallelujah you're not here by your own calling you're not here by your own choice you're here by the choice of almighty God hallu woo Hallelujah that makes me want to shout when I realize I ain't here amen by God own choice I ain't out in the world by the devil's choice I am here by God's choice God has brought me here and he's elected me and placed me into this place but isn't it strange how God does things he'll let us get down to the last mile of the way like you did with the Hebrew children he knew who he but you know he knew who he could trust I'm just going to be very open why does sister Karen pass when we prayed and we prayed and we prayed because he knew who he could trust why did Erica pass away cuz he knew who he could trust listen God's not all about this world we're living in he's all about getting us to the next World if we could only see her now ask you who won Hallelujah if she was here sister Karen was here still now even in a good body she would be aging getting older more aches and pains and everything else but she's in a place that she'll never get old again she'll never face another sickness she'll never face another mind battle she'll never face another fear another worry or another ringing of her hands wondering how this is going to work how that's going to be she'll never have that again I ask you who really won amen sister Erica is not in a body ate up with cancer she's not in a body that's diseased and and and going down into into a pit somewhere Amen to be buried in a grave no sir amen who won she won cuz she's in a young body never to face cancer again I tell you who lost that cancer loss I tell you who lost that brain bleed lost I tell you who loses the devil loses hallelujah amen if you could only see them now wherefore seeing we're incompass by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also run our race yes sir not with a bunch of loser mentality I ain't going to make it I can't make it I've already made it woo my god I've already made it I've already been seen there shouting on the Hills of Glory I've already been seen in a vision marching Onward Christian Soldiers onward to war amen I've already been seen there but it's so strange how God allows us to get to the last mile of the way oh you know he likes to do that quote he did it with Hebrew children he knew who he could trust so he let them boys walk right up to the fiery furnace till they could smell the fire and he never moved but when it comes time he will move he will move but he waits till his own time he wanted to see what kind of reaction they would have he knew they'd made their stand and he knows that you make you make when you make your stand he'll let Satan take you to the last mile of the way but just remember he's still there he wants to see if you really mean what you're talking about oh I believe God's A Healer yes I sure believe I I believe it next thing you still got pain well maybe I never got nothing sure you got it he just wanted to see if you're going to react on what you said come on well we just need something that would last we got something that'll last it's our Fai that our faith that Fizzles out but we're also we're also in a body of hum humiliation amen you can get healed today and get sick tomorrow but that don't mean he ain't God oh praise the Lord I believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit first little Temptation comes along you fly off the like a buz saw he's trying to see your reaction on your action he's trying to test you every son that cometh to God must first be chastened and tested every child that comes to him he puts him through the test to see how he will act brother Bram tells a story of a builder of bridges there in Australia time tested Memorial is a wonderful sermon but they was trying to find somebody that built a bridge to connect these cities together and it was a lot of sinking sand and shifting Sands and quick Sands and they tested and they said no we want to undertake it to try such a build such a bridge it can't be done but this young architect came and famous man rep man had a good reputation he said oh I like that he said I like a man with a reputation oh you don't have to be a big man you can be a popper that lives in the attic and have a reputation far better than a potentate you don't have to be rich but you can have a reputation it declares your reputation what you what you are makes you who you are it gives you your reputation you're known by your reputation that's why we got to make sure we got a good reputation in business we need a good reputation and it don't take much to scar it to Mar it this man wouldn't down there with this wonderful reputation and he looked the situation over he walked the banks for a few days and he studied it he tested it he sounded it looked around after a while he said I'll take the job they said well sir do you know what you're taking he say I thoroughly understand well these great Architects have already looked at it and turned it down he said I'm not afraid of it I'll take it I realize I have the worldwide reputation as a bridge builder but I'll stake my reputation on this bridge he had a vision before man can make a reputation he has to have a vision of what he's doing and blessed be the Lord that's the reason there's a heaven to go to that's the reason we can have a reputation as Christians we know what material is in this building the blood of Jesus Christ is in this building Hallelujah his stained blood has washed away all sin he took me from the alleys of hell and he's made me a servant then I believe and so I passed from Death to life and every believer has done the same thing because they got confidence and they believe in this great Builder this great architect the Lord Jesus Christ amen when the men did it first thing he did to be sure said we got to get a solid foundation and so he goes way down into the Earth past all the shifting Sands until he hit some bedrock and he got down that bedrock and he anchored those big bolts in there and he got around the very best Architects he could find the best sign is the best equipment and he got the best steel for the bridge and he tested every bolt he tested every nut he tested every piece because this was he was based on his reputation on whether it worked or whether it failed if he went to that much trouble to be sure that bridge would be safe how much trouble do you think God has went to to make sure this church would be safe amen there's a memorial to the death of Jesus Christ this is his church some people don't want to live it but some will and they will be tested but they will hold God is testing the people today for his memorial a lot of times people say oh I'm so tempted blessed be the name of the Lord for the Temptation when I'm weak then I am then he is strong said Paul every son that cometh God must first be tried and tested these testings are more sweeter to you and dear to you than precious gold it's testing time but he gets down and he places every tested piece every tested bolt scoffers is that it ain't going to hold that ain't that's going to blow up that's going to fall in and see that's what they're saying today they're saying this Holy Ghost religion won't last long the tree is going to burn down but it don't burn down it don't burn down he said because the fire is actually only gives it water it gives New Hope it only strengthens it every time the wind hits a tree it shoves it back and forth it's loosening The Roots every time sickness strikes your home every time trial strike your life every time neighbors say something bad it's only shaking you loosen you up so you can get down and get a better hold on the Eternal Rock of God that's how God does it he sends those trials to test you to prove you to shake you to give you a new hold we find out when they all got done the critics said can't work won't work Architects knew it would hold and he knew it would because it been tested critics today are saying they ain't going to be a bride there ain't going to be one without spot without wrinkle but God said so and he only said it because he had tested what he put in this church Hall did you hear me he only said that because he'd already tested what he put in this church he knew it held in him when it descended down into his body it held him through his temptation yes it held him through every trial it h him through held him through every time he was sick or felt bad it held him through every demon oppression it held him through every time he got down and depressed Hallelujah it held him when he got to the moment everybody else walked away it held him amen when he was hanging on the cross so he knew he had tested it and if it held then it'll hold now that's the reason I know this oldtime God heartfelt salvation will hold the reputation of Christ is in it that's right he will not give us something to build a church out of some man-made theology or some school experience or some Seminary or something to educate the but the real preacher comes from the Seminary of God's grace and God's calling it's time tested it'll hold God's got confidence in you hello somebody God's got confidence in you she's anchored somewhere that maybe you can't see like the poet said my anchor holds within the veil every high and stormy Gale my anchor holds within the veil we don't know what's holding but something's holding she's anchored Yonder in the heaven that's a rope of Salvation that holds a human heart that's a man that's ever been born Born Again passed from death and life all Devils Out of Hell couldn't make him doubt it something holds within there let her rock let her Shake it'll hold every time because it's in Christ Jesus this man he didn't ask somebody else to go across the bridge first he went across the bridge himself he got all the the story is he got all the press out and he he got the locomotives out and he got the heavy equipment out and he going to put all all this weight on this bridge cuz he had confidence that he had put all all all of his work and everything he had done amen amen to to make sure it was going to work he knew what he had and he started there he said get ready get your cameras ready they said well the bridge is going to fall he said I'll walk out there myself Strike Up the Band and brother the bands went to play and the whistles went to blow and the horns went to honking and a great awful vibration take place but he walked right across that bridge and she never moved he took the Forefront and he said Jesus Christ has come from Heaven to Glory from Glory down here to build a church and the material he's putting in US is time tested material you might come to an altar and make a confession but when he finds blo holes and he finds a spot there he'll pitch it to one side and he'll pitch it on that side God want you to hold God wants you to last he can't place you anywhere until you have that spirit on the inside of [Applause] you he's got a church that's tested that's went through trials that's went through losses hello went through sicknesses went through sorrow went through death and is still T standing with a testimony hallelujah amen you're not looking at a pastor who fell off somewhere or assistant pastor a Ministry that don't know how to preach no more because God didn't answer a prayer God did answer our prayers amen and we're still standing as a testimony amen and brother brand said if I pray for a thousand and a thousand fall dead I'll pray for another thousand amen cuz it does not change who God is God's the same yesterday today and forever and we're still standing as a testimony as we bring this down it was brother Brandon was talking about a a story or something called Sail on he said when Christopher Columbus was given ships by the queen of Spain because his heart he saw a vision of a world that was round and he had hardly a way he could prove it he had nothing to do it with but he was a man of vision he believed it you know back then they had excuses for believing the world's flat today you ain't got a lick of excuse you believe a World's flat because you're just an idiot that's
