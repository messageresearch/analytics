[1:03:50] today on the comforter as he as he said
[1:03:54] I'm I will pray the father and he shall
[1:03:57] give you another
[1:03:59] comforter no doubt when Jesus was here
[1:04:02] walking with his disciples he was a
[1:04:05] great comfort to
[1:04:06] them amen and for him to go away and
[1:04:10] then to ascend into glory and leave us
[1:04:13] as orphans I'm glad he didn't do that
[1:04:17] but he promised to be our comforter and
[1:04:20] our strength
[1:04:21] Giver as our thoughts go back to a
[1:04:24] comforter and we go back to the first
[1:04:28] Exodus when Israel was anticipating the
[1:04:32] destroyer and knowing that that he was
[1:04:36] on his way having been warned by the
[1:04:38] prophet of God that death was going to
[1:04:41] strike every
[1:04:42] home and they had killed the lamb and
[1:04:45] put his blood on the door and as they
[1:04:47] ate the lamb that no doubt the children
[1:04:50] asked Daddy what what you got your shoes
[1:04:52] on for what you got to staff in your
[1:04:55] hand and why do you have a got a piece
[1:04:58] of bread in one hand and a lamb in the
[1:05:01] other why is it bitter herbs and things
[1:05:04] and why you're eating it and and what's
[1:05:06] that sweat that's running off your face
[1:05:09] what is all of this
[1:05:11] about you know it's the the little boy
[1:05:14] would the little girl would get an
[1:05:16] answer from the father son death is
[1:05:19] fixing to strike you see it was a time
[1:05:22] of
[1:05:24] desperation and if we ever been in a
[1:05:27] desperate hour it is now you know seeing
[1:05:31] the Destroyer with those black wings um
[1:05:35] dropping down from the sky like smoke
[1:05:38] settling down over Egypt and their
[1:05:41] screams were coming from every
[1:05:44] house what a horrible moment that was
[1:05:48] but they could take comfort as they
[1:05:50] looked upon the post and the lentil and
[1:05:53] say but we have done according to the
[1:05:57] word amen maybe the oldest child would
[1:06:00] would say but Daddy are you positive are
[1:06:03] you sure this is going to keep the
[1:06:05] Destroyer away I'm positive we've done
[1:06:08] exactly what the word told us to do and
[1:06:11] the prophet told us and he has the word
[1:06:13] of the Lord and when I see the blood
[1:06:16] I'll pass over you take a lamb for the
[1:06:19] house and I I brought all you children
[1:06:22] in and you're you're my my oldest my
[1:06:25] firstborn and it's the firstborn out
[1:06:28] there that is dying but but there is the
[1:06:31] blood of a firstborn lamb that has been
[1:06:35] applied to the doorpost and to the
[1:06:37] lentil and we have done according to the
[1:06:41] word we to what thus sayith the Lord was
[1:06:44] so you can rest at ease son amen because
[1:06:48] God has made a promise my what a word of
[1:06:52] comfort that message must have been to
[1:06:55] Israel as they were led by a pillar of
[1:06:58] fire and they could look up and they
[1:07:00] could see that Pillar of Fire by night
[1:07:03] and A Cloud by day and hear the prophet
[1:07:06] speaks words that were true and see God
[1:07:09] come along and and Vindicated you see
[1:07:13] that was their comfort and but today
[1:07:17] each one of us have the Holy Ghost that
[1:07:19] and we when we received it we received a
[1:07:22] portion of that Pillar of Fire and the
[1:07:25] it is within us it is the holy spirit
[1:07:28] leading us to the promised land and and
[1:07:32] of course to the promised Rapture of the
[1:07:34] church and and to the promised land of
[1:07:37] the Millennium ahead and we are
[1:07:39] expecting like they were as they as they
[1:07:43] were eating of the lamb and and they
[1:07:45] were taking the Passover and and um they
[1:07:49] were doing what they were told and and
[1:07:52] there under the shelter of the blood
[1:07:55] they were expecting any moment to hear
[1:07:58] the trumpet sound and when the trumpet
[1:08:01] would sound they would know that they
[1:08:03] were going to go out of Egypt on their
[1:08:07] way into
[1:08:09] Freedom oh you know that was only a type
[1:08:12] of what has been promised for our day
[1:08:15] because we too have been gathered under
[1:08:18] a word from God God sending a pillar of
[1:08:22] fire and God vindicating his word and
[1:08:26] given us a word of comfort and we are
[1:08:30] expecting to change from the voice of
[1:08:33] the Archangel to the Trump of God and
[1:08:35] for the dead in Christ to rise for our
[1:08:39] Exodus and and so we we have words of
[1:08:43] comfort that are specific for our hour
[1:08:48] now psalms 27 um will will be the words
[1:08:52] of the for the Rapture and it'll be the
[1:08:55] Psalm of the Rapture and it is a it is
[1:08:58] an exuberant Declaration of faith and I
[1:09:03] think if there's anybody that should
[1:09:04] have an exuberant Declaration of faith
[1:09:08] it ought to be the bride of Christ who
[1:09:10] has been owed with rapturing faith in
[1:09:13] this hour and so psalms 27 says the Lord
[1:09:17] is my light I you know I like to look
[1:09:21] upon upon it as it says the Lord there
[1:09:23] he is ruler over all and he is not was
[1:09:28] or will be but is present he is my light
[1:09:31] and he is my salvation what else can you
[1:09:35] look for in this day when you need
[1:09:37] comforting anytime you leave listen to
[1:09:40] the news it leaves you with confusion
[1:09:42] and and questions and ponderings and
[1:09:46] worries about the future and everything
[1:09:49] else but you know and and the hope of
[1:09:52] this politician who claims that he would
[1:09:55] save you or he was in control all of
[1:09:59] this wouldn't be taking place or you
[1:10:01] know we you know some kind of Utopia
[1:10:04] ahead that they they want to promise but
[1:10:07] for the believer the Lord is my
[1:10:09] salvation what are we looking for to
[1:10:12] save us in this hour it certainly isn't
[1:10:16] politicians amen it certainly isn't even
[1:10:19] our armies and and our our own human
[1:10:22] abilities but what we are looking to
[1:10:25] move to save us in this hour is the Lord
[1:10:28] and He is my light and he is my
[1:10:31] salvation so Whom Shall I
[1:10:33] Fear amen we have no reason to fear the
[1:10:37] lord is the strength of my life if I
[1:10:41] need strength he is the strength Giver
[1:10:44] so of whom should I be afraid all every
[1:10:47] man of Faith down through the hours and
[1:10:51] Through the Ages have stood right here
[1:10:53] and realized my strength is of god am my
[1:10:57] in myself if we could interview every
[1:11:00] one of the Hebrews of Faith they would
[1:11:02] say in myself I was not able but there
[1:11:06] was his strength that came amen the Lord
[1:11:10] is the strength of my life and of whom
[1:11:12] shall I be afraid when the wicked came
[1:11:16] up against me to eat up my flesh my
[1:11:19] enemies and foe who guess who stumbled
[1:11:22] and fell what me they stumbled and fell
[1:11:27] amen you can declare in the face of any
[1:11:30] enemy any Goliath it will be you that
[1:11:33] will stumble and you will fall but my
[1:11:36] strength is of God he is my salvation he
[1:11:40] is my life he is my help he is my
[1:11:44] comfort I have that Comfort to know that
[1:11:47] when I meet an enemy or a v it'll be
[1:11:50] them that stumbles and falls
[1:11:56] amen and though it be an army Satan can
[1:11:59] bring the best he's got amen and may
[1:12:02] though it may encamp against me my heart
[1:12:05] shall not fear though War may rise
[1:12:09] against me and this I will be confident
[1:12:13] what is it what is it I'm confident in
[1:12:16] that the Lord is that he's the same
[1:12:19] yesterday today and forever he's the
[1:12:21] Lord Our God who changes not that he's
[1:12:24] the ever present help in the time of
[1:12:26] trouble that no matter where you go or
[1:12:29] what you do the never failing presence
[1:12:31] of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you
[1:12:35] go what a word of
[1:12:37] comfort amen though an army may be
[1:12:41] encamp me though the war may rise
[1:12:43] against me but here's one thing I'm
[1:12:46] going to do here's my desire and this is
[1:12:49] what I'll seek
[1:12:50] after one thing I've desired of the Lord
[1:12:53] that will I seek
[1:12:55] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:12:58] Lord all the days of my life to behold
[1:13:01] the beauty of the Lord and inquire in
[1:13:03] his
[1:13:04] Temple for in the time of trouble he
[1:13:07] will hide me in his
[1:13:10] shelter Amen in the secret place of his
[1:13:13] Tabernacle he shall hide me he shall set
[1:13:17] me high upon a rock Oh What A Word of
[1:13:21] Promise and now my head shall be lifted
[1:13:23] up above all my enemies over around me
[1:13:26] therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy
[1:13:29] in his Tabernacle I will sing yes I will
[1:13:32] sing praises to the Lord here it is
[1:13:36] again David telling us where worship and
[1:13:38] praise belongs in the house of the Lord
[1:13:42] It's never out of order it's always in
[1:13:45] order when we when we here and we look
[1:13:48] at look where we're at and realize the
[1:13:51] blessings that we have from God and we
[1:13:54] know that he here we can offer
[1:13:56] sacrifices of joy in his
[1:13:59] Tabernacle now so you see in this hour
[1:14:03] where the Destroyer is going and we hear
[1:14:06] the screams the Cries From
[1:14:09] everywhere and we know that the story is
[1:14:12] in the land and we have this
[1:14:15] comfort and the prophet Isaiah would
[1:14:19] prophesy words of comfort that are also
[1:14:23] pertinent to our hour you remember when
[1:14:26] we're looking in the scripture you want
[1:14:28] to see the words that are actually
[1:14:31] identified for the day that we're living
[1:14:34] in so that we're walking in our script
[1:14:36] in the scripture that has spoken of us
[1:14:39] remember this is what Jesus did how many
[1:14:42] remembers that in the Bible Jesus always
[1:14:45] would go to the scripture and he says
[1:14:48] it's written of me you know if you could
[1:14:51] do that with psalms 27 this morning and
[1:14:54] say that is written me I am in this
[1:14:56] Rapture hour amen I am that person of
[1:15:00] Faith exuberant faith of rapturous faith
[1:15:04] and and here I I have the right to this
[1:15:07] scripture it's written of me my enemies
[1:15:10] will fall before me I have nothing to
[1:15:13] fear the war comes against me in this
[1:15:15] will I be confident in the Lord is my
[1:15:18] light and he is my
[1:15:20] strength so we go to other scriptures
[1:15:23] that speak of this hour that speaks of
[1:15:26] this time you know God has promised and
[1:15:29] and fulfilled his promise of sending a
[1:15:31] forerunner in this
[1:15:33] day we know he coming and is IM imminent
[1:15:36] because the Forerunner is now off the
[1:15:38] scene long time amen but yet at the same
[1:15:41] time we we have been introduced to the
[1:15:45] phases of his coming his word coming his
[1:15:48] bride coming and soon the meeting in the
[1:15:50] air so as we as we look at this for a
[1:15:54] moment
[1:15:55] we we know that a forerunner it goes to
[1:15:58] prepare the way and remember God
[1:16:01] promised a forerunner before his first
[1:16:04] coming and he promised again a
[1:16:07] forerunner that and he that he would be
[1:16:11] a voice of comfort to God's people and
[1:16:15] the message starts out you know with
[1:16:17] with with emphasizing
[1:16:20] comfort and saying it twice and I we're
[1:16:23] going to Isaiah 4 in verse one because
[1:16:26] as as John would identify himself as a
[1:16:28] forerunner he says here I am in the
[1:16:31] scripture because they were asking him
[1:16:34] are you that
[1:16:35] Elijah amen are you are you that Elijah
[1:16:39] and he said no not the one you're
[1:16:41] looking for that's going to restore all
[1:16:43] things so he knew what they were looking
[1:16:45] for so he denied being Elijah though he
[1:16:48] was Elijah he come with the spirit and
[1:16:51] the power of Elijah but he knew what
[1:16:52] Elijah they were talking about no I'm
[1:16:54] not that
[1:16:55] Elijah so but if you want to see where
[1:16:58] I'm at as a forerunner I'm in Isaiah
[1:17:00] chapter 40 here is the word that spoke
[1:17:04] of me now I'm going to just say this if
[1:17:06] it spoke of the first Forerunner it
[1:17:09] speaks of the second Forerunner so if
[1:17:11] it's a word given to the first it's a
[1:17:14] word given to the
[1:17:16] last amen because we are in the second
[1:17:19] coming of the Lord right and so again as
[1:17:23] we look at this he says he says these
[1:17:26] words Comfort ye Comfort ye my people
[1:17:30] saith your God you so I'm going to send
[1:17:33] you a message and this message will be a
[1:17:36] message of
[1:17:41] comfort you know a lot of times people
[1:17:43] will look at it well it's a message of
[1:17:45] judgment and it judges here and it's
[1:17:47] really judgmental no it's only just
[1:17:50] judging
[1:17:51] sin but for you it is a word of
[1:17:55] comfort for you it is a word of strength
[1:17:59] so he says Comfort ye Comfort ye my
[1:18:02] people sayth your God so he
[1:18:04] emphasizes I can say it like this he
[1:18:07] does it for the first the first
[1:18:09] Forerunner it's the same word of comfort
[1:18:11] for the last in fact the matter is our
[1:18:15] word of comfort is even greater than
[1:18:17] there because we go back to first
[1:18:20] Thessalonians 4 and he sums it up and he
[1:18:22] says as he talks about the Rapture the
[1:18:24] res res rection and he said wherefore
[1:18:26] Comfort one another with these
[1:18:30] words amen if there's any word of
[1:18:32] comfort today it is God is not going to
[1:18:35] leave us here we're going to escape the
[1:18:38] things that are coming on the
[1:18:41] earth the plagues that are about to fall
[1:18:44] upon Egypt and the land that we are
[1:18:46] leaving will not fall upon us we will
[1:18:49] escape because we are under a blood
[1:18:58] now so he says in Isaiah 40 and verse 2
[1:19:02] speak ye
[1:19:04] comfortly to
[1:19:06] Jerusalem and cry unto her that her
[1:19:09] Warfare is
[1:19:12] accomplished that her iniquity is
[1:19:15] pardoned for she has received of the
[1:19:17] Lord's hands double for all her
[1:19:22] sins now actually this was Israel coming
[1:19:26] out of Babylon and this is words of
[1:19:29] comfort given to them as they will come
[1:19:31] back to the to their
[1:19:34] Homeland and and they had been
[1:19:37] judged and but but I want you to see and
[1:19:41] he said the Warfare is accomplished war
[1:19:43] is over her iniquity is
[1:19:46] pardoned and and she has received of the
[1:19:49] Lord's hands
[1:19:52] double but what about you
[1:19:57] what about you do you want to receive of
[1:20:00] your from the Lord's hands
[1:20:03] double for what you
[1:20:06] did are you with me think of this but I
[1:20:10] I want you to understand something
[1:20:12] according to Isaiah 53 says all we like
[1:20:15] sheep have gone astray and we all
[1:20:19] deserve
[1:20:20] punishment amen and we turned every man
[1:20:22] to his own way
[1:20:25] amen and the Lord oh I'm glad that says
[1:20:27] this has laid on him the iniquity to of
[1:20:32] us
[1:20:33] all so you see the Judgment that we were
[1:20:37] due because we strayed was poured out
[1:20:41] upon our lamb somebody help me preach
[1:20:44] and our lamb died in our
[1:20:48] place so we have received devil he has
[1:20:53] received of the Lord's hand and double
[1:20:55] for all all our sins brother it's paid
[1:20:58] in
[1:20:59] full paid in full whatever you want to
[1:21:03] think about however you want to look at
[1:21:05] it it's all paid in full Amen in fact he
[1:21:09] paid double for
[1:21:10] it are you with me amen he more than he
[1:21:15] more than paid for your sins amen and
[1:21:19] your the war is
[1:21:20] over amen the war is over and you're
[1:21:24] iniquity is
[1:21:27] pardoned hallelujah oh my how could it
[1:21:30] be pardoned and you got to pay
[1:21:33] double amen but he took the payment and
[1:21:37] paid it He Paid a Debt I did not owe I
[1:21:41] owed a debt I couldn't pay I needed
[1:21:44] someone to take my sins away so the lord
[1:21:47] has laid on him the iniquity of us all
[1:21:51] watch now the voice of him
[1:21:55] that crith in the wilderness verse three
[1:21:58] the voice of him that crith in the
[1:22:01] wilderness notice first of all it is it
[1:22:07] is the voice of him that crith remember
[1:22:12] remember John was not the one crying in
[1:22:15] the

[1:22:45] religious systems of Pharisees the
[1:22:47] Sadducees and and the herodians and all
[1:22:50] the other culous things that they had in
[1:22:52] that day he was outside of that he was a

[1:29:55] soul goodness and mercy not not evil and
[1:30:00] wrong but goodness and mercy is going to
[1:30:03] follow me all the days of my
[1:30:07] life and I shall dwell in the house of
[1:30:10] the Lord
[1:30:12] forever he shall feed his flock like a
[1:30:15] shepherd He Shall Gather the Lambs with
[1:30:18] his arms he shall carry them in his
[1:30:22] bosom sometimes
[1:30:24] we seem like just can't make another
[1:30:27] step that's
[1:30:28] right but that's when he carries
[1:30:34] us amen you know you you're walking
[1:30:37] along with a five six year- old child
[1:30:39] and and you know Daddy gets to you know
[1:30:42] is holding his hand and they're going
[1:30:44] down and you know you want that child to
[1:30:47] run and do as long as he can especially
[1:30:50] if the journey is long but when he can't
[1:30:53] go no more
[1:30:54] there's Daddy to pick him up and carry
[1:30:58] him and that's the way it is with you
[1:31:01] you see God wants you to run and Skip
[1:31:04] and do everything you can and when you
[1:31:07] can but when you can't go another
[1:31:09] step when the doctor's report says it's
[1:31:12] all over when the news is the worst it
[1:31:15] can be this is when he just Scoops you
[1:31:17] up in his arms and he carries
[1:31:20] you Hallelujah he carries you and he
[1:31:24] gently leads those that are with
[1:31:28] young
[1:31:30] amen if you would read down from verse
[1:31:33] 12 to verse 27 he goes into the whole
[1:31:37] discourse about telling how that our God
[1:31:41] is greater than Idols of wood and gold
[1:31:43] and silver or stone he tells us there's
[1:31:47] no comfort in them that's
[1:31:49] right this is what even says in Jeremiah
[1:31:52] 10 don't learn the way of the Heathen
[1:31:54] that goes and cuts down a a tree and and
[1:31:57] then cuts it and carves faces in it and
[1:31:59] and decks it with gold and silver and
[1:32:01] makes an idle out of it and you Bow Down
[1:32:03] and Worship something said you have to
[1:32:04] support it or it would fall over you
[1:32:07] have to carry it if it goes anywhere
[1:32:10] it's it's just it's just an
[1:32:12] idol but he he talks about our God our
[1:32:16] God is not an
[1:32:17] idol he's a living God he's at
[1:32:21] everpresent help in the time of trouble
[1:32:24] amen amen so so he tells over and again
[1:32:27] he just goes through example after an
[1:32:29] example in the in verses 12- 27 and
[1:32:32] tells how our God is
[1:32:36] greater amen I'm glad to be serving a
[1:32:39] god that is greater than these Idols
[1:32:42] that make out of
[1:32:44] sports can you imagine that being the
[1:32:47] god that you serve you know in adultery
[1:32:50] and filth and all the all the the rotten
[1:32:53] life Styles it to live what did they
[1:32:56] ever do for
[1:32:59] you amen what did they ever do for you
[1:33:02] what could they ever do for you
[1:33:05] nothing amen so they'll make them out of
[1:33:08] Hollywood or this or that and the other
[1:33:11] God's out of money whatever it is you
[1:33:13] know you see none of them are do our
[1:33:16] worship but we have a living
[1:33:19] God and so he says in verse 28 now he
[1:33:23] changes again and and he and after
[1:33:26] talking about all the idols and idolatry
[1:33:28] and he hast thou not known hast thou not
[1:33:32] heard that the Everlasting God the Lord
[1:33:35] the creator of the ends of the Earth
[1:33:38] fainteth not neither is weary and

[1:37:49] his presence without permission and had
[1:37:51] to be dressed right and everything and
[1:37:52] she could if wasn't accepted she would
[1:37:54] be destroyed she knew he was a
[1:38:00] lion amen she knew he her husband was a
[1:38:05] lion we know our husband the bridegroom
[1:38:08] is a
[1:38:09] lion we saw him take hold to
[1:38:13] death squeeze him until he had to let go
[1:38:17] and took away the keys to his kingdom
[1:38:20] where he doesn't even have a key to his
[1:38:22] own house we know he is the one that is
[1:38:26] and and was and is to come we know he is
[1:38:29] one of
[1:38:32] power but you see he's not only a
[1:38:36] lion but because he's a priest after the
[1:38:39] order of
[1:38:40] MDC he is also
[1:38:43] lamb thank you Lord you see mzc was a
[1:38:48] king of Salem and the priest of the most
[1:38:51] high God he was both priest and
[1:38:56] King and so when they saw
[1:38:59] him you know he would he was he could he
[1:39:03] could be our high priest now you know
[1:39:07] Paul had to explain this in the book of
[1:39:09] Hebrews because Jesus was not of the
[1:39:12] tribe of levit so how could he be the
[1:39:14] high
[1:39:15] priest so he says but you're a high
[1:39:17] priest he's a high priest after the
[1:39:19] order of MDC
[1:39:21] that's you see in Israel God divided
[1:39:25] there the the the Priestly lineage for
[1:39:28] for for Levi and the King lineage for
[1:39:32] Judah the scepter will never leave the
[1:39:35] hand of Judah till Shiloh comes so they
[1:39:38] knew the king lion was
[1:39:40] Judah whever they call they picked a man
[1:39:43] out of out of Benjamin I don't know he
[1:39:45] had to come from he had to come from
[1:39:48] Judah to be the king and you remember in
[1:39:52] the Bible that a king of Judah wanted to
[1:39:56] offer incense in the Tabernacle and the
[1:39:59] priest said no that's only for the
[1:40:00] priest and he said oh oh you know he he
[1:40:03] said I'm doing it anyway I'm the king
[1:40:05] and he goes on in and leprosy strikes
[1:40:08] him why why because he was as a king
[1:40:13] even though he was a great man and and
[1:40:15] had Authority had no Authority
[1:40:18] there but Jesus was of the lineage of
[1:40:22] MDC yes so he was the lion of
[1:40:27] Judah and yet he was the priest of the
[1:40:29] most high God
[1:40:31] lamb so when John hears that the lion of
[1:40:36] the tribe of Judah have prevailed he
[1:40:39] looks to see a
[1:40:41] lion and he sees a
[1:40:44] lamb hallelujah amen do you hear what
[1:40:48] I'm trying to say to you this morning
[1:40:50] amen he is a king and he will destroy
[1:40:54] those who who contaminate and destroy
[1:40:57] the Earth come on he will bring
[1:40:59] Vengeance he's a mighty lion he'll rule
[1:41:03] his King over the Earth in the
[1:41:06] Millennium but right now when we look at
[1:41:09] him what do we see l a high
[1:41:13] priest that can be touched he's a lamb
[1:41:17] so Esther walks in the presence of this
[1:41:20] lion and he changes to lamb
[1:41:24] what do you
[1:41:26] want ask
[1:41:28] anything I'll give you even half the
[1:41:32] kingdom amen you'll reign with
[1:41:35] me whatever whatever you want whatever
[1:41:39] you desire Esther it's for you reach out
[1:41:42] and get it holding out the scepter he
[1:41:46] didn't she didn't see a king she saw a
[1:41:50] lamb Hallelujah she didn't see a judge
[1:41:54] she saw a lamb the King the lion just
[1:41:59] melted became a lamb
[1:42:02] Esther my queen yes and when we look at
[1:42:07] him even though he is lying we will
[1:42:11] never see him as our
[1:42:14] judge cuz he took our judgment for us
[1:42:20] our sins were laid upon him
[1:42:24] Hallelujah and he took it for us and he
[1:42:27] will never judge you come on read Romans
[1:42:29] 8 will he judge you not Christ who is he
[1:42:32] that condemn you not
[1:42:35] Jesus amen he'll never give up loving
[1:42:40] you no no no he'll never give up loving
[1:42:44] you goodness and mercy will get on your
[1:42:46] Trail and will bring you back no matter
[1:42:49] if you stray his Mercy endur forever
[1:42:54] that's why we can look for him to reach
[1:42:56] out and save our prodical cuz he's a god
[1:42:59] rich in
[1:43:04] Mercy lion and
[1:43:14] lamb the Bible
[1:43:17] said hast thou not known hast thou not
[1:43:21] heard that the Everlasting lasting God
[1:43:23] the Lord the creator of the ends of the
[1:43:27] Earth fth not neither is weary and there
[1:43:30] is no searching of his understanding
[1:43:33] this is him the ever strong and never

[1:44:04] so weak you cannot go any further amen
[1:44:08] you reach the end of your rope as it
[1:44:10] were and in that moment there is a
[1:44:14] hidden
[1:44:16] power that rises up within you that
[1:44:19] gives you strength for the journey to
[1:44:21] take another step to believe one more
[1:44:24] time to accept his promise once
[1:44:28] again a hidden power is called the holy
[1:44:32] ghost that hidden power was in Samson it
[1:44:35] wasn't Samson he was you know when the
[1:44:37] lion roared against him he was just a
[1:44:40] curly-headed little shrimp little seven
[1:44:43] little locks hanging around his

[1:45:20] said that that's wasn't it at all
[1:45:24] it wasn't his
[1:45:25] strength it was his Covenant with
[1:45:29] God Amen it was his Covenant with God
[1:45:32] and that was shown identified in his
[1:45:34] Seven Locks you see he was a a
[1:45:38] dwarf like every man is without

[1:46:12] came to get him but in that moment the
[1:46:15] hidden power came
[1:46:17] out amen the Holy Spirit came on him and
[1:46:20] he grabbed that lion and slew it like it
[1:46:22] was
[1:46:23] nothing you see you see because there
[1:46:27] was a an anointing that went with the
[1:46:31] Covenant and remember His was external
[1:46:35] and showed by external sign yours is
[1:46:37] eternal and it's internal and it can
[1:46:40] never be taken away from you Samson's
[1:46:43] could be cut off but really yours cannot
[1:46:45] ever be separated but nothing can
[1:46:48] separate

[1:46:53] separate you from the love of
[1:46:56] God Amen somewhere hidden in you this

[1:47:06] Faith it's that Holy
[1:47:09] Ghost down on the inside of you is a
[1:47:14] David there's a giant roaring against
[1:47:17] him but greater a giant was in David
[1:47:21] that's right you see you couldn't see
[1:47:23] the giant in David but there was a giant
[1:47:26] in
[1:47:27] David there was a hidden power when
[1:47:30] David slung a stone amen it was God that
[1:47:33] got in that
[1:47:34] arm you see there was hidden power in
[1:47:37] the three Hebrew children and you know
[1:47:40] someone bigger and greater and stronger
[1:47:42] than them he you know he was the Fourth
[1:47:45] Man In The
[1:47:47] Fire And he just come and showed up all
[1:47:49] of a sudden he's there in the fire and
[1:47:52] he's there but I want you to know when
[1:47:54] you get in the fire you don't have to
[1:47:55] wait for him to come he's already inside
[1:48:01] you amen you got a greater comforter
[1:48:05] than what they had there was law and it
[1:48:09] was external but this is this is a new
[1:48:12] covenant and it's
[1:48:16] internal he's going to abide with you
[1:48:19] forever
[1:48:23] you
[1:48:24] see there's a fire that is in you that
[1:48:28] is greater than the gates of
[1:48:31] hell so you're looking at the Destroyer
[1:48:34] there's a greater destroyer in you than
[1:48:37] the Destroyer out there is in the
[1:48:40] world come
[1:48:42] on what did he do he destroyed drinking
[1:48:45] and smoking and adultery and pornography
[1:48:47] and every kind of evil and come on he's
[1:48:51] a destroyer
[1:48:54] and before the destroying Angel could
[1:48:56] come and wreck and ruin your life he
[1:48:59] came and destroyed that in your
[1:49:04] life verse 30 tells us about the youth
[1:49:08] the youth shall faint they shall lose
[1:49:10] heart and they shall be weary they'll
[1:49:13] give up because of their
[1:49:15] weariness and the young men shall
[1:49:17] utterly fall or they'll be exhausted
[1:49:24] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:49:27] renew their
[1:49:29] strength amen waiting of the Lord means
[1:49:31] to fix your Gaze on
[1:49:34] him amen refusing to look at anything
[1:49:37] else but
[1:49:38] him amen just him and his word that's
[1:49:41] all you're going to look at I consider
[1:49:44] not my body now dead Abraham said you
[1:49:47] see that's what waiting on God
[1:49:51] means they that wait wait on the Lord
[1:49:53] those that fix their Gaze on him those
[1:49:56] that refuse to let
[1:49:59] circumstances drag them
[1:50:01] down they that wait on the Lord shall
[1:50:04] renew their
[1:50:06] strength what shall they do you see
[1:50:08] waiting on the Lord is an act of faith
[1:50:11] and a trust in him an attitude of
[1:50:14] expectancy that he's he will surely show
[1:50:17] off in our in our lives so we can
[1:50:19] experience him with his presence and his
[1:50:23] Loving
[1:50:24] Care think of that they that wait on the
[1:50:29] Lord shall renew their strength 1
[1:50:33] Corinthians 4:16 says for which cause we
[1:50:36] faint not now here he's talking about
[1:50:39] Christians and the troubles and the
[1:50:41] tribulations that we call and he says
[1:50:44] and he says for this cause we faint not
[1:50:47] for but though our outward man
[1:50:51] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[1:50:55] by
[1:50:56] day you may be getting weak in your
[1:50:59] flesh but the inward man is
[1:51:03] renewed day by day look what they will
[1:51:06] do they shall Mount up with wings as
[1:51:11] Eagles hey I I I am trying to tell you
[1:51:14] of of the promise of the word for your
[1:51:17] hour this is the message of comfort that
[1:51:21] our gods are not gods of Idols but our
[1:51:24] God is a real and living God and those
[1:51:29] who serve him that wait upon him that
[1:51:31] keep their gaze upon him they shall
[1:51:35] Mount
[1:51:36] up amen with wings as an eagle I don't
[1:51:40] care how many stores might have blowed
[1:51:42] you down I don't care how decrepid you
[1:51:45] feel and how weary you've been the word
[1:51:48] of the Lord to you this morning is you
[1:51:50] will Mount up with wings as Eagles you
[1:51:55] are under an anointing to overcome in
[1:51:58] this
[1:52:01] hour they shall Mount up with wings as
[1:52:05] eagles they shall run and not be weary
[1:52:09] we're talking about a supernatural
[1:52:12] renewed strength a strength that would
[1:52:14] compare to mounting up where as an eagle
[1:52:17] or running without
[1:52:20] fatigue amen
[1:52:23] so you see they shall walk and not
[1:52:26] faint this isn't about showing God how
[1:52:29] strong we are and asking him to give us
[1:52:32] a bit more no it's here we admit we
[1:52:36] don't have the strength we need that's
[1:52:38] we acknowledge we need the strength that
[1:52:40] only he can
[1:52:42] give and we wait for him and that's more
[1:52:45] than just passing
[1:52:47] time Amen in Hebrews it it means it
[1:52:50] means a a a hopeful
[1:52:54] expectation Amen in the midst of
[1:52:57] hardship we look to him as the one who's
[1:52:59] going to work everything out for our
[1:53:03] good now when Jesus was here he carried
[1:53:07] so much for the people that he healed
[1:53:09] the sick he comforted their hearts he
[1:53:13] gave words these words of comfort he
[1:53:15] said let not your hearts be troubled as
[1:53:18] you believed in God believe in me in my
[1:53:21] father's house are me
[1:53:23] Mansions I go to prepare a place for you
[1:53:27] I I will come again and receive you unto
[1:53:29] myself that where I am there you may be
[1:53:33] also so you see these are words of
[1:53:37] comfort we can look at at our bodies and
[1:53:40] theyve getting decrepit and we know we
[1:53:41] got a mansion we're going to this is
[1:53:44] only temporary but there's a
[1:53:47] mansion there's a mansion waiting Yonder
[1:53:51] that the Savior have prepared prepared
[1:53:52] me he told us this before he went away
[1:53:56] he said that he would come someday and
[1:53:59] you know bring us to our home and glory
[1:54:01] and I'm waiting I'm waiting for that day
[1:54:03] aren't you waiting for it that is our
[1:54:06] hopeful expectation when all the world
[1:54:10] gives way around
[1:54:11] us we
[1:54:13] know we have a mansion waiting
[1:54:17] Yonder it's important was very important
[1:54:21] that he go away
[1:54:23] Jesus had to leave you know why he was
[1:54:26] the fullness of the godhead and a
[1:54:29] body as long as he stayed here it would
[1:54:32] always be God With Us that's right and
[1:54:36] US
[1:54:40] unchanged that's
[1:54:42] unchanged a lion cussing
[1:54:46] Peter with a determination I'll never
[1:54:49] deny you don't need to do
[1:54:51] it that's
[1:54:53] right as long as he's just with
[1:54:58] us we're still in
[1:55:01] trouble cuz there's times we get away
[1:55:04] from
[1:55:06] Jesus come on Amen if he was if he was
[1:55:10] here in physical
[1:55:13] body he could you know
[1:55:15] then then what if he goes to Africa well
[1:55:18] I'm left alone what if he goes visits
[1:55:21] the Saints and
[1:55:23] Canada I'm left
[1:55:25] alone what if he goes home with you and
[1:55:27] I don't have
[1:55:31] him amen you see he says he makes it
[1:55:35] clear it's important that I go away
[1:55:38] because if I don't go away the comforter
[1:55:40] can't
[1:55:42] come the only way that the spirit of God
[1:55:45] can come is for me to leave because in
[1:55:48] me dwells the fullness of the godhead
[1:55:50] bodily and so I'll comfort
[1:55:53] no no doubt it was comforting think
[1:55:55] about it yeah it was comforting that on
[1:55:57] a stormy sea didn't know that Jesus
[1:56:00] could walk on Troubled Waters to get to
[1:56:03] you or that Jesus was in the boat with
[1:56:07] you but God wanted the
[1:56:10] comforter who was with them then to be
[1:56:15] in
[1:56:17] them he cared so much that when he knew
[1:56:23] that he knew he must leave in order that
[1:56:27] the comforter could
[1:56:30] come amen for he says he will give you
[1:56:34] another comforter and this comforter
[1:56:36] will not be temporary but it be the
[1:56:39] spirit of truth that he may abide with
[1:56:42] you
[1:56:43] forever you see it would not be a
[1:56:46] another person but it would be the
[1:56:48] spirit of Truth which would be the
[1:56:51] spirit of Jesus wouldn't be a second or
[1:56:53] third person in the godhead it would be
[1:56:55] the same God the spirit of truth would
[1:56:59] be the spirit of
[1:57:00] Jesus I will not leave you comfortless
[1:57:03] John 14:18 I will not leave you
[1:57:06] comfortless I will come to
[1:57:13] you
[1:57:15] amen and when the comforter comes the
[1:57:18] world would see him no
[1:57:20] more but he said you will see me in that
[1:57:25] day you will know I'm in you that it
[1:57:27] would no longer be God with us but it
[1:57:30] would now be God in
[1:57:32] us amen so he said yet a little while
[1:57:35] the world see me no more but you see me
[1:57:38] because I live you live
[1:57:41] also and at that day you will know that
[1:57:46] I am in my father and you are in me and
[1:57:49] I'm in you he made
[1:57:52] no question left no question about it
[1:57:56] when he says I am going to be in
[1:58:01] you I'm moving from this state of with
[1:58:04] you to coming in
[1:58:07] you verse 26 but the comforter which the
[1:58:10] H which is the Holy Ghost whom the
[1:58:12] father will send in my name he shall
[1:58:15] teach you all things and bring all
[1:58:17] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:58:20] have said unto you this is the evidence
[1:58:22] of the Holy Ghost According To Jesus
[1:58:24] Christ
[1:58:25] himself is not tongues is not long hair
[1:58:28] it's not long dresses is not the forms
[1:58:31] of Holiness this is the evidence of the
[1:58:34] Holy Ghost According To Jesus Christ for
[1:58:36] he said he will teach you all things he
[1:58:39] will be the inside
[1:58:43] teacher no longer
[1:58:46] external you know if you get the baptism
[1:58:48] of the Holy Ghost you really won't need
[1:58:50] a much more sermon on
[1:58:54] Holiness you you really won't have to
[1:58:56] get some some Pastor to PR you to go to
[1:59:01] church amen you will love to be in the
[1:59:03] house of God it will be your custom as
[1:59:06] it was
[1:59:08] Jesus come on when you get the Holy
[1:59:11] Ghost on the inside of you he will be
[1:59:14] the inside teacher notice what he do he
[1:59:17] will teach you all
[1:59:19] things and then he will bring all things
[1:59:23] you remembrance whatever I said unto you
[1:59:25] in the very moment where you would do
[1:59:27] wrong the word will come to you he will
[1:59:30] Quicken the word right to your heart
[1:59:31] he'll bring that word to your memory
[1:59:33] he'll be your
[1:59:36] memory amen amen look at this John
[1:59:43] 16:7 for he says he tells us I go away
[1:59:47] I'm going to return in the form of the
[1:59:49] Holy Ghost as a comforter and the comfor
[1:59:52] in you will testify and bear witness of
[1:59:54] me look at verse 7 John 16 nevertheless
[1:59:58] I tell you the truth it is expedient for
[2:00:01] you it is necessary it it's
[2:00:05] absolutely of utmost
[2:00:08] importance that I go away for if I go
[2:00:12] not away the comforter will not come to
[2:00:15] you but if I depart I will send him unto
[2:00:19] you and when he is coming he will
[2:00:22] reprove the world of sin and of
[2:00:24] righteousness and of judgment he will
[2:00:27] reprove the world of sin he will teach
[2:00:31] righteousness and he will show you
[2:00:34] things to
[2:00:36] come amen he'll take the things I've
[2:00:38] taught you and reveal them to you you
[2:00:41] see no man can understand the word
[2:00:43] outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:00:46] and when a man says he got the baptism
[2:00:48] of the Holy Ghost and disputes the word
[2:00:51] of God being right
[2:00:52] you know there's something wrong
[2:00:54] somewhere cuz he cannot deny
[2:00:56] himself the Bible says that about him he
[2:00:59] cannot deny himself this is why brother
[2:01:02] bradam said how could you say you have
[2:01:03] the Holy Ghost and you're cutting your
[2:01:04] hair and you're painting your face and
[2:01:06] you're doing things contrary to the word
[2:01:07] and all cuz he cannot deny
[2:01:12] himself so in John 16 and9 he will
[2:01:15] convinced them of
[2:01:17] sin because they believe not on me you
[2:01:20] see the ultimate sin
[2:01:23] is to not believe on Jesus
[2:01:27] Christ of righteousness because I go to
[2:01:30] my father and you see in me no more so

[2:06:24] all power in Heaven and Earth Is His he
[2:06:27] is a judge of this world no one
[2:06:30] else as brother Bram spoke about this in
[2:06:34] the sermon he cares do you care it's a
[2:06:37] wonderful
[2:06:38] sermon you should listen to it he said
[2:06:42] I'll not leave you comfortless but I'll
[2:06:44] send the Holy Spirit and he will
[2:06:47] continue my care for
[2:06:49] you thank until he returns and he says
[2:06:54] there's no one cares like Jesus this
[2:06:58] ought to make you run to the aisle
[2:07:00] speaking in tongu shouting and
[2:07:02] dancing no one cares like
[2:07:05] Jesus knowing that his body is high
[2:07:08] priest and a mediatorial work that he's
[2:07:10] doing now that body must be in the
[2:07:12] presence of God at all time for
[2:07:14] intercession that God cannot see the
[2:07:16] sinner's sin he sees only the blood of
[2:07:20] his own son and knowing that he sent
[2:07:22] back the Holy Spirit to continue to
[2:07:25] comfort his people oh Hallelujah does he
[2:07:28] care certainly he cares now he was
[2:07:32] continue to care for his people here on
[2:07:34] Earth in the same manner he cared for
[2:07:37] them when he was here did he care about
[2:07:40] sickness did he care about Sin did he
[2:07:44] care about the
[2:07:45] maniac did he care about those who
[2:07:48] nobody cared
[2:07:49] for there's nobody car like
[2:07:52] Jesus amen and then the Rapture when he
[2:07:57] comes again he will leave the father's
[2:08:00] Throne intercession will then be over
[2:08:04] that's amen now don't be like fitus and
[2:08:08] hus who said the resurrection was passed
[2:08:12] because they had a spiritual application
[2:08:14] of you know we we uh are raised again in
[2:08:17] Christ we're resurrected and ascended
[2:08:19] into heaven took Paul's words of being
[2:08:21] in the Heavenly place and say well the
[2:08:23] resurrection's passed and we're always
[2:08:25] and and began to overthrow the faith of
[2:08:27] some and Satan would use these things to
[2:08:30] try to overthrow your faith to get you
[2:08:33] to believe things that are not yet yet
[2:08:36] to happen you see if you you cannot
[2:08:39] mislocate the word of God brother Bram
[2:08:43] talked about three things we must not do
[2:08:44] and mislocate is one of them and and
[2:08:47] that is to apply it when it's when it's
[2:08:49] not time to be applied right so you
[2:08:53] see it'll be in the Rapture when he
[2:08:56] comes again I'm talking about the
[2:08:58] meeting in the there he will leave the
[2:09:01] father's throne and intercession will
[2:09:04] then be over that's
[2:09:08] right now some say because they're fitus
[2:09:12] and hus that got a damnable doctrine
[2:09:15] that that takes away faith and
[2:09:17] overthrows Faith of some they say that
[2:09:20] intercession is all over oh no if that's
[2:09:23] so then the coming is
[2:09:25] over and we missed
[2:09:31] it you know I I've had somebody write me
[2:09:35] here some time ago and said we're
[2:09:36] already in glorified bodies I said I'm
[2:09:43] sorry I said I missed it some oh yeah
[2:09:46] yeah you already got yours brother
[2:09:49] Tim I'm disappoint pointed in it not the
[2:09:52] Mansion I
[2:09:56] thought amen this one's got rust on the
[2:09:58] door
[2:10:01] handles this's got
[2:10:05] wrinkles this's got a lot of
[2:10:09] troubles amen I I don't know where
[2:10:11] people come up with this oh well he's
[2:10:13] he's already left the mercy seed and
[2:10:15] intercession is over oh no that's so the
[2:10:18] com's over and we missed it
[2:10:21] amen but when he comes he will leave the
[2:10:26] heavens no longer will he intercede on
[2:10:29] behalf of men and he will come for his
[2:10:31] bride and we will meet him in the
[2:10:35] air amen amen and not only not not only
[2:10:40] is he within us working out for our good
[2:10:43] but he's presently in the
[2:10:46] heavens amen as our Advocate our
[2:10:49] champion that's
[2:10:51] you see our supporter our
[2:10:55] backer standing Before the
[2:11:00] Throne the Bible said he's our advocate
[2:11:03] he is our high priest who can be touched
[2:11:07] with the feelings of our infirmities
[2:11:09] When you pray he backs it
[2:11:12] up yes Father I paid for their
[2:11:18] healing come on you you see he he
[2:11:21] pictured it like this where that you
[2:11:23] know because he he showed himself as a
[2:11:26] man you see as an intercessor or a
[2:11:30] mediator between God and man so he came
[2:11:33] as as El gior the Mighty God spoke of in
[2:11:37] the in Isaiah's prophecy where he would
[2:11:40] come as the Everlasting father the
[2:11:42] Mighty God the prince of Beast he would
[2:11:44] be elabore which means the mighty l or
[2:11:48] the hero God or the warrior God
[2:11:52] because he would come to take on human
[2:11:56] battles amen Jesus was tempted in all
[2:12:00] points like we are yet without
[2:12:03] sin so whatever you're tempted by and
[2:12:06] Trouble by he was already tempted by it
[2:12:09] and overcome it so it's already
[2:12:14] defeated and if he defeated it in Jesus
[2:12:18] when Jesus comes in you by the Holy
[2:12:20] Ghost it'll defeated
[2:12:22] [Applause]
[2:12:24] again so well I got the Holy Ghost but
[2:12:27] them but I can't stay out of P porn let
[2:12:29] me tell you if Jesus is in there he
[2:12:31] don't do
[2:12:34] porn amen he doesn't do that he doesn't
[2:12:38] smoke he doesn't drink he
[2:12:42] doesn't amen so when we come before the
[2:12:45] throne of grace we can find a
[2:12:49] helper help a helper
[2:12:52] an advocate a champion a
[2:12:56] supporter our
[2:12:59] backer you you stand on the earth and
[2:13:03] you bind
[2:13:05] it and I'll bind it in
[2:13:07] [Music]
[2:13:09] heaven amen you loose
[2:13:12] it and I'll Loose
[2:13:17] It come on I'm talking about what a
[2:13:19] comfort it is to know know that we have
[2:13:23] a God in heaven who is our
[2:13:28] friend now there was once there was once
[2:13:31] that man could not approach the presence
[2:13:33] of God because of
[2:13:36] sin but Jesus came and dealt with sin
[2:13:40] question and then he ascends on high in
[2:13:43] order that he might be the advocate the
[2:13:48] helper the supporter
[2:13:51] yes and your only approach to Spirit God
[2:13:55] is through the man Christ
[2:14:00] Jesus that's why we ask anything in his
[2:14:04] name because that's the only way
[2:14:07] approach we have to God you cannot
[2:14:09] approach him without
[2:14:12] Jesus amen only in him is redemption of
[2:14:16] sins so you must approach him through
[2:14:19] Jesus the man Christ
[2:14:21] Jesus so you see he is our Advocate our
[2:14:25] champion our supporter our backer and
[2:14:28] he's standing Before the Throne as our
[2:14:31] Advocate and he is our high priest who
[2:14:33] can feel our infirmities When you pray
[2:14:36] he backs it up and said yes
[2:14:39] Father I paid it
[2:14:43] all there sin is paid
[2:14:46] for their sickness is paid for their
[2:14:49] need is supplied
[2:14:51] I know he's going to supply cuz he said
[2:14:53] my God shall supply all your needs
[2:14:56] according to his riches in glory
[2:15:00] somebody help me preach I paid for it so
[2:15:03] therefore I'm their backer do you
[2:15:05] realize in heaven you've got a
[2:15:08] supporter amen Jesus is your supporter
[2:15:12] amen I will support you whatever you ask
[2:15:16] for I'm going to support it I'm going to
[2:15:19] stand behind it do anything
[2:15:21] ask
[2:15:25] anything amen it is the word amen you
[2:15:30] might think well but brother Tim the
[2:15:33] seals are open so he's taken the book
[2:15:35] and that means he's left the throne and
[2:15:37] he's no more intercessor well that will
[2:15:40] be true one day when he physically takes
[2:15:42] the
[2:15:43] book you see this happened in three
[2:15:46] first symbolically to
[2:15:49] John amen
[2:15:51] man so it could be
[2:15:54] written second by Revelation to the
[2:15:57] seventh angel so that which was written
[2:16:00] symbolically could be
[2:16:02] revealed and then it will happen
[2:16:04] literally in physical when he takes his
[2:16:07] bride into glory for they were what the
[2:16:10] book was representing
[2:16:13] symbolically so when you're look at the
[2:16:15] whole picture there that there when you
[2:16:17] see a lamb Jesus is no hooked animal
[2:16:20] with seven heads are seven horns and
[2:16:22] seven
[2:16:24] eyes that's not what he looks like you
[2:16:27] you're not going to see him like that
[2:16:29] that was symbolic of his Redemption work
[2:16:31] when he took the book he was claiming
[2:16:34] the redeemed for they are the names in
[2:16:37] the
[2:16:39] book amen so what did God do he revealed
[2:16:42] this symbolically to John Revelation to
[2:16:45] brother brandham but one day he's going
[2:16:48] to physically take the book he's going
[2:16:51] to take the bride the people the
[2:16:54] redeemed and take them to his possession
[2:16:58] for himself as the
[2:17:01] bridegroom
[2:17:05] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:17:08] Lord
[2:17:09] amen
[2:17:11] so and Awakening Jesus brother Brandon
[2:17:14] said we want to see Jesus I want to see
[2:17:16] him we know his body will not return to
[2:17:18] the Earth until he comes for the church
[2:17:20] chur it must remain there for a
[2:17:23] sacrifice is that right it must be on
[2:17:26] the altar he sits on the throne of God
[2:17:28] tonight it must remain here therefore
[2:17:31] for by his stripes he is the sacrifice
[2:17:34] and the sacrifice is on the Altar and
[2:17:36] his body cannot come but his life
[2:17:39] returned that was in Christ came back on
[2:17:43] the church in the form of the Holy
[2:17:44] Spirit and and the Holy Spirit it wasn't
[2:17:48] that body that did it anyhow it's not me
[2:17:50] me that doth the work it's my father
[2:17:52] that dwelleth in me that doeth the
[2:17:55] works so you see it was it's the spirit
[2:17:58] we
[2:18:00] needed Amen in the in the message the
[2:18:03] trial brother Brandon said the Corporal
[2:18:04] body is sitting at the right hand of God
[2:18:07] to make
[2:18:08] intercessions but the Holy Ghost has
[2:18:11] come to carry on his work I want you to
[2:18:13] know in John 14 Jesus said he that
[2:18:16] believeth in me the works that I do
[2:18:18] shall he do also so where is the body
[2:18:21] it's there on the throne it is the
[2:18:24] sacrifice it is the mediator it is the
[2:18:28] advocate it is our
[2:18:31] backer amen so when you when you
[2:18:33] approach the throne he doesn't see you
[2:18:35] he sees your
[2:18:38] sacrifice he doesn't see your failures
[2:18:41] your past he sees your sacrifice he do
[2:18:44] look to see if you are without blemish
[2:18:46] he looks to see the lamb without
[2:18:48] blemish therefore you can both
[2:18:51] approach the throne of God knowing you
[2:18:55] will find Grace favor in the your time
[2:18:58] of need oh I'm glad for a comforter like
[2:19:03] that that I can be comforted knowing
[2:19:06] that when I pray amen I've got a backer
[2:19:10] there a
[2:19:12] supporter who's standing in my
[2:19:16] place amen the body of Jesus is on the
[2:19:19] throne of God he uses our body to
[2:19:22] manifest himself through just like he
[2:19:24] promised to do the works that I do shall
[2:19:26] you do also that's a testimony on the
[2:19:30] sea you see it's the hour for his power
[2:19:35] to be displayed in in the his bride and
[2:19:38] when we apply the token on the earth
[2:19:40] that hidden power he backs it up in
[2:19:43] heaven and when does Satan falls like
[2:19:47] lightning crashing
[2:19:49] downward but because he he there as the
[2:19:52] accuser of the
[2:19:54] Brethren and he every every time that
[2:19:57] his lies or what he says is said before
[2:20:00] the throne he is defeated and cast
[2:20:04] down now so the Holy Ghost must be
[2:20:08] displayed for the bride and Christ are
[2:20:12] one notice you have the same spirit that
[2:20:15] was in
[2:20:16] Jesus not a different Spirit the same
[2:20:20] Holy Ghost Jesus had you have same
[2:20:23] anointing he had which is the Holy Ghost
[2:20:26] you have was more than anointing it was
[2:20:28] an indwelling spirit so he dwells in you
[2:20:31] so the token is the Holy Ghost upon the
[2:20:34] church that they see Christ it has to be
[2:20:38] because a woman and her husband become
[2:20:40] one and so does the bride and Christ
[2:20:42] become one the ministry of the bride and
[2:20:46] the ministry of Christ is the same
[2:20:51] amen remember these this former treaties
[2:20:54] o theopus I've written to you that Jesus
[2:20:57] began and brother Bradon would add and
[2:20:59] continues to do his death didn't stop
[2:21:03] him no sir he returned again not a third
[2:21:07] person but the same person returned
[2:21:11] again in the form of the Holy Ghost to
[2:21:14] continue the work on and continues on
[2:21:16] said the book of Acts Jesus Christ the
[2:21:19] same yesterday to day and forever that's
[2:21:22] the token that's the sign and when Peter
[2:21:25] and John and and passed through the gate
[2:21:28] called Beautiful there laid a man who
[2:21:30] was crippled from his and lame from his
[2:21:32] mother's womb he said Silver and Gold
[2:21:35] Have I None but such I have I give to
[2:21:38] you in the name of Jesus of Nazareth
[2:21:40] rise up and walk and they talked to him
[2:21:42] and knew that they were ignorant and
[2:21:45] unlearned men but they took notice they
[2:21:47] had been with Jesus see the token the
[2:21:50] Holy Ghost was their
[2:21:53] display amen see such as I have oh God
[2:21:57] thank you Lord that we don't have to
[2:21:59] draw insufficient
[2:22:02] funds Hallelujah that such as I have I
[2:22:06] give amen you you got to realize what's
[2:22:09] on the inside of you you have something

[2:24:07] and John saw the blind beggar they used
[2:24:09] the power and they had to take heed they
[2:24:13] had been with
[2:24:15] Jesus why they had displayed the token
[2:24:17] the sign the Holy Ghost the spirit was
[2:24:21] upon him before his crucifixion was now
[2:24:24] upon them after his resurrection and
[2:24:27] Ascension then that makes him Jesus
[2:24:29] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:24:32] forever that's how we know he
[2:24:35] lives amen because we
[2:24:38] live and because we're like him that's
[2:24:42] how we know he lives how do you know he
[2:24:46] lives you've never seen his
[2:24:49] personage you've never seen his human
[2:24:52] form he's never walked down these aisles
[2:24:55] how do you know he lives cuz he lives in
[2:24:58] you and because the works that you
[2:25:01] couldn't do you now do the life you now
[2:25:04] live in the flesh you live by the faith
[2:25:06] of the Son of God that's how we know he
[2:25:10] lives amen we know he lives when he
[2:25:13] takes a sinner and makes a saint out of
[2:25:15] him we know he lives when he takes
[2:25:18] someone bound with habits of sin and
[2:25:21] changes their lives and radically
[2:25:23] transforms them we know that he
[2:25:28] lives amen he shows himself alive amen
[2:25:33] it displays it makes him the same
[2:25:35] yesterday today and forever now let's go
[2:25:38] to John 15 and verse 26 but when the
[2:25:42] comforter is come whom I will send to
[2:25:46] you from the father even the spirit of
[2:25:49] Truth which proceedeth from the father
[2:25:52] he shall testify of
[2:25:55] me and ye shall bear witness because you
[2:25:59] have been with me from the
[2:26:01] beginning so no notice he told us the
[2:26:04] spirit would come who the father would
[2:26:07] send in his name he would testify in him
[2:26:09] in other words he would do the same
[2:26:11] things that he
[2:26:13] did the Holy Spirit working through the
[2:26:16] Tabernacle that he
[2:26:18] Sanctified would do the same things that
[2:26:21] he did oh that ought to do something for
[2:26:23] us today that we know that right among
[2:26:26] us we have the same comforting Lord
[2:26:29] Jesus in the form of the Holy Ghost amen
[2:26:32] another office that God is working him
[2:26:35] through amen working in now because it's
[2:26:40] more than through you it's in
[2:26:42] you now Jesus said the works that I do
[2:26:46] shall you do also I'm going to the
[2:26:48] father I'm going to send back the Holy
[2:26:49] Spirit
[2:26:51] which will be me in spirit
[2:26:55] form be the same
[2:26:58] Jesus the spirit of
[2:27:00] Jesus just prove it the Bible said if
[2:27:03] you have not the spirit of Christ you're
[2:27:04] none of
[2:27:05] his so you have to have the spirit of
[2:27:08] Jesus the spirit of Christ and I'll be
[2:27:11] with you and I'll dwell in you and the
[2:27:14] Very things I've done here the holy
[2:27:16] spirit will do again in my
[2:27:18] nameen it'll be the acts of the Holy
[2:27:20] Spirit and he will he will be doing the
[2:27:22] work watch and he cares for you he said
[2:27:24] he made this directly sure he will speak
[2:27:27] in my name the works that I do shall you
[2:27:30] do also when he's upon
[2:27:34] you see he would comfort in the same way
[2:27:37] by forgiving all our sins healing all
[2:27:39] our sickness speaking to us of all of
[2:27:42] comfort of a kingdom that is to come and
[2:27:45] and proving himself among us as God
[2:27:48] proved himself Among Us by Jesus Christ
[2:27:51] First Timothy 3:16 it's written to know
[2:27:54] about
[2:27:55] God without controversy we realize great
[2:27:59] is the mystery of godliness for God was
[2:28:02] manifested in the flesh see he was
[2:28:04] manifested in the flesh God not another
[2:28:07] person God
[2:28:09] himself revealed manifested in the flesh
[2:28:13] and then to make it another step closer
[2:28:15] he sends the Holy Spirit to care for our
[2:28:19] comfort and he abides in us notice here
[2:28:24] the the token the Holy Ghost is no good
[2:28:28] unless it's
[2:28:30] displayed I don't care what kind of
[2:28:32] giant was in David if it wasn't
[2:28:36] displayed he would have done it no
[2:28:39] good if he just sat back and just coward
[2:28:42] it like the rest of Israel come on or
[2:28:44] just remain silent but it had to be on
[2:28:47] display the Holy Ghost is there to be
[2:28:50] displayed not a
[2:28:52] sympathizer but the token must be
[2:28:57] applied now you know that's why you know
[2:29:00] sometimes I you know sometimes we we we
[2:29:03] hear of little arguments I don't agree
[2:29:05] with brother Tim on this you know you
[2:29:07] know I I I believe I can have the Holy
[2:29:10] Ghost and and still still be in
[2:29:13] pornography and and all kinds of other
[2:29:15] things like
[2:29:18] that so
[2:29:21] wait a
[2:29:22] minute how can you say you have the
[2:29:25] token and your comfort is
[2:29:33] pornography your gratification is
[2:29:38] porn here's my
[2:29:41] comfort my comfort is that sin no longer
[2:29:45] Reigns its power has been broken
[2:29:53] hallelujah amen yes sir that's where our
[2:29:56] comfort is is sin no longer
[2:30:00] Reigns and its power has been
[2:30:03] broken you see that the Holy Ghost and
[2:30:06] its works are our
[2:30:09] identification now I I I just want to
[2:30:11] say this as we've
[2:30:14] coming to a close here in just a few
[2:30:17] more minutes perhaps
[2:30:20] we might hear emphasized the
[2:30:24] scripture but many will come to me in
[2:30:26] that day and say Lord Lord have not we
[2:30:28] done many mighty wondrous Works in thy
[2:30:31] name and he will say depart from me you
[2:30:34] workers of iniquity I never knew you and
[2:30:37] I want to say
[2:30:39] amen I want to say that scripture is
[2:30:42] very true that there will absolutely be
[2:30:48] impersonators but that doesn't take away
[2:30:50] from the fact that we're to continue his
[2:30:53] ministry that the works that he did we
[2:30:55] are to do also that we must manifest the
[2:30:58] promised word of his day and its signs
[2:31:01] are our
[2:31:03] identification now it's more than one
[2:31:09] sign sure a sign of a Believer is I I
[2:31:13] confess Jesus Christ as my Lord and
[2:31:15] Savior if you won't confess him as Lord
[2:31:17] and Savior you're not a
[2:31:18] believer but that's not all the
[2:31:23] signs you can make a confession with
[2:31:25] your mouth and not believe from the
[2:31:28] heart and there's many that do it
[2:31:31] because why their confession is not
[2:31:34] sincere it's his
[2:31:36] words but it's part of our
[2:31:38] identification you see we wanted one
[2:31:41] identification if we speak in
[2:31:43] tongues we got
[2:31:46] it and God says it's not one thing
[2:31:56] so you know unless there's something
[2:31:58] wrong with them like some disease or
[2:32:02] sickness or something like that chemical
[2:32:06] thing
[2:32:07] humans all humans have
[2:32:12] hair but everything that has hair is not
[2:32:14] a human
[2:32:20] but it's one of the identifications of
[2:32:25] human so you
[2:32:28] see yes we there there again Holy Ghost
[2:32:32] people speak with in other
[2:32:34] tongues it's one of identifications of
[2:32:37] Believers this is what will be among
[2:32:38] believers they will speak with
[2:32:42] tongues but not everything that speaks
[2:32:44] with tongues is a
[2:32:48] believer amen I you
[2:32:51] know you hear some people come along
[2:32:54] that that are in Witchcraft and demon
[2:32:56] possession and say I can speak in
[2:32:57] tongues I believe in speaking in tongues
[2:33:00] well sure they
[2:33:01] do and they speak in tongues but it's
[2:33:04] not the Holy
[2:33:05] Ghost you see it's a it's demonic
[2:33:08] demonic influence that people can come
[2:33:11] under but the real Holy Ghost will speak
[2:33:13] with tongues it will convince you of
[2:33:17] sin it will it will it has many
[2:33:20] identifications it's more than hair on
[2:33:22] the head to be a
[2:33:24] human or hair on the body to be a human
[2:33:27] it's more than that it's more than just
[2:33:29] everything you know human gives live
[2:33:31] birth it don't hatch from
[2:33:34] eggs but everything that doesn't hat
[2:33:37] from an egg that gives Liv's birth is
[2:33:38] not a
[2:33:39] human so I want you to understand it but
[2:33:42] it doesn't that that many will come in
[2:33:46] that day and say have not I done many
[2:33:48] mighty Works in thy name
[2:33:50] and and have not we cast out Devils have
[2:33:53] not we done Mighty works and he said
[2:33:55] depart from me you you worker of
[2:33:58] iniquity I never knew
[2:34:01] you but that doesn't take away from the
[2:34:04] fact that signs will identify Believers
[2:34:08] in my name they will cast out devils in
[2:34:11] my name they will speak with new
[2:34:14] tongues amen these signs of violence and
[2:34:17] believe not just professors but identifi
[2:34:21] Believers amen they may not follow they
[2:34:25] probably will perhaps they will Jesus
[2:34:27] said they shall follow them that believe
[2:34:30] it's just impossible for it not to
[2:34:33] happen the works that I do shall you do
[2:34:35] also that's the
[2:34:38] identification Jesus identification was
[2:34:40] to manifest the word of God which he was
[2:34:43] and the church's identification today is
[2:34:46] to manifest the promised word of this
[2:34:48] day by The Same Spirit that manifested
[2:34:51] and quickened the word then the Same
[2:34:54] Spirit quickens the word to the believer
[2:34:56] today and manifests the same thing
[2:34:58] showing that the token is on this person
[2:35:01] which is the resurrected life of Jesus
[2:35:03] Christ Living in his believer oh that
[2:35:06] ought to set the Church of
[2:35:09] fire amen and he said it's just as true
[2:35:12] as true can be so what is it you see it
[2:35:16] is it is exactly sign follow them the
[2:35:20] Believers amen what they will the sin
[2:35:24] will be judged amen you will be
[2:35:26] identified as a Son of God by works by
[2:35:30] life the life you
[2:35:32] live amen all of this will be it's not
[2:35:35] just one thing that makes a human many
[2:35:38] things make up a human not one thing
[2:35:41] makes up the Holy Ghost many things make
[2:35:44] up the Holy Ghost there are things the
[2:35:47] Holy Ghost does the devil impersonates
[2:35:52] but that don't make it
[2:35:54] untrue it's still the
[2:35:56] truth amen the signs still follow them
[2:35:59] that Believers believe amen and your
[2:36:01] character is God's character amen your
[2:36:05] life is God's
[2:36:07] life that's the
[2:36:10] comforter how comforting it is to know
[2:36:14] that in an hour like this that we
[2:36:17] possess the same
[2:36:20] spirit that was in
[2:36:22] Jesus and if it raised Jesus up from the
[2:36:26] dead and Quicken his mortal body it also
[2:36:31] will transform
[2:36:33] you not only just in the transformation
[2:36:36] in the future but right now you who were
[2:36:39] in sins and dead Works hath he made
[2:36:44] alive Hallelujah I'm talking to a living
[2:36:47] bride and that's why we have comfort
[2:36:50] this
[2:36:51] morning he said he'll abide with you
[2:36:56] forever he doesn't come and go he
[2:36:59] doesn't depart from you he seals you to
[2:37:03] the day of redemption he's not your God
[2:37:06] in good times and not your God in bad
[2:37:09] times he's your God all the
[2:37:14] time the comforter has
[2:37:16] come you have him and and one
[2:37:20] day that Spirit of
[2:37:25] Jesus that is in you and you and you and
[2:37:29] you and you and around the
[2:37:31] world one
[2:37:34] day one
[2:37:36] day that spirit that he sent back his
[2:37:39] own
[2:37:41] Spirit he will rise up from the
[2:37:46] throne taking the book
[2:37:51] are you with me taking the book taking
[2:37:54] the people taking a Rapture and He will
[2:37:58] draw to himself everyone that has that
[2:38:03] spirit and it'll all come back into
[2:38:09] him we're not at the initiating of this
[2:38:12] we're at the ending of it and I tell you
[2:38:14] he's about to gather his
[2:38:17] spirit and everyone who who has that
[2:38:20] Holy Spirit will be gathered to meet him
[2:38:23] in the
[2:38:25] air that's what Believers
[2:38:30] believe and if the spirit that raised
[2:38:34] Jesus from the dead dwell in you it will
[2:38:38] Quicken your mortal
[2:38:40] body oh yes it will Quicken it and
[2:38:43] you'll speak perhaps in other languages
[2:38:46] it will Quicken it and you will be with
[2:38:49] identified works it will Quicken your
[2:38:52] mortal body and you'll move away from
[2:38:54] the Hollywood ideas of the world and
[2:38:56] live and act like a a a holy man or a
[2:38:59] holy woman righteousness will be
[2:39:02] displayed amen it will Quicken your
[2:39:05] mortal body but one day it's going to
[2:39:08] make alive your mortal body so much that
[2:39:12] you're going to be changed in a moment
[2:39:14] in a twinkling of an
[2:39:16] eye Hallelujah your hair will come back
[2:39:20] the right color again amen the wrinkles
[2:39:22] will just fall right off of you Eternal
[2:39:25] youth will come upon you and you'll be
[2:39:28] changed from the creature that you
[2:39:31] are oh my what a day that will be amen
