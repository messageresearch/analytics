[14:24] such a privilege for us to be together
[14:25] again tonight and amen so enjoy the
[14:28] service today then brother Ron do a
[14:30] tremendous job
[14:32] praise the Lord let's turn to the Book
[14:34] of Joshua if you would
[14:40] Joshua
[14:41] Joshua chapter 14.
[14:45] we'll read together
[14:47] verse 6 and down through verses
[14:50] 10.
[14:52] I asked brother Timothy if he would sing
[14:54] that song tonight for a reason
[14:58] because we will
[15:00] refer back to it on the basis of where
[15:03] we're going to read this
[15:05] scripture from
[15:08] then the children of Judah came unto
[15:11] Joshua in gilgal
[15:14] and Caleb the son of jefani
[15:17] the kennesite
[15:19] said unto him thou knowest the thing
[15:22] that the Lord said unto Moses the man of
[15:25] God concerning me
[15:28] and thee in kadeshbarnia
[15:32] 40 years old
[15:34] was I
[15:36] when Moses the servant of the Lord
[15:39] sent me from kadishbarnia to aspile the
[15:42] land
[15:43] and I brought him word again
[15:46] as it was in my heart
[15:49] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[15:52] with me made the heart of the people
[15:55] melt
[15:58] now once you listen to this verse now
[16:00] so there were two reports coming about
[16:03] the exact same place to reports
[16:08] now if you and I will revert back in
[16:10] time we're not standing here tonight in
[16:13] April of 2023.
[16:16] but we're standing back there at
[16:18] kadishbarnia
[16:20] we have heard 10 preachers come up was a
[16:24] bad report
[16:26] and there's only two that say in or more
[16:29] than able to take the land
[16:31] it's ours we can do it it's ours
[16:35] so you're the people now
[16:37] so whose report
[16:40] will you believe
[16:42] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[16:45] with me made the heart of the people
[16:47] melt now it would have been one thing
[16:49] had it been the Philistines the amorites
[16:51] the Hittites the jebusites those Seven
[16:54] Nations that God sent them to conquer if
[16:57] it would have been them that would have
[17:00] said these things but instead of it
[17:02] being them
[17:03] it was their own message Brothers
[17:08] oh boy here we go
[17:11] and by doing that they made the hearts
[17:14] of the people just to melt
[17:17] but I wholly followed the Lord my God
[17:22] and Moses swear on that day saying
[17:25] surely the land we're on thy feet have
[17:28] trodden shall be thine inheritance and
[17:31] thy children's forever
[17:34] because
[17:38] I want you to notice why it's going to
[17:40] be his
[17:41] because God loved him more not because
[17:44] she combed his hair on the right side of
[17:46] his head but because thou has followed
[17:50] the Lord my God
[17:54] and it amazing Caleb the verse before
[17:56] that caused the Lord his God
[17:58] why he heard the prophet say the same
[18:01] thing so now the prophet told him he
[18:03] said you serve the Lord with all of your
[18:05] heart the Lord my God so Caleb said I
[18:08] like that I think I'll call him my God
[18:10] so it just goes ahead and said he wasn't
[18:12] just Moses god he's my God
[18:14] a lot of us can say he was brother
[18:16] branham's God that ain't good enough God
[18:19] wants you to be able to say he's my God
[18:22] he's your God
[18:24] behold now behold the Lord has kept me
[18:29] alive
[18:30] as he said these 40 and five years since
[18:34] the Lord spoke this word unto Moses
[18:37] while the children of Israel wandered in
[18:39] the wilderness and now lo I am this day
[18:44] four score
[18:46] and five years old 85.
[18:51] years old
[18:52] so instead of looking for a nursing home
[18:56] he's wanting a land full of giants
[19:00] That's My Kind Of Man right there
[19:03] instead of wanting a little flower
[19:06] garden or a nice little spot in a
[19:09] peaceful side of Palestine
[19:11] that has already been settled and he'll
[19:13] plant a little bit of broccoli and a
[19:16] little bit of asparagus and he'll go out
[19:18] there and spend the rest of his days him
[19:20] and their wives on the front porch on a
[19:23] rocking chair
[19:24] peacefully rocking sleeping in and out
[19:27] during the day
[19:29] but he says I want you to know I'm just
[19:31] as strong now
[19:33] as I was 40 years ago
[19:37] now he stands 85.
[19:40] years old
[19:42] let's pray together
[19:44] Lord Jesus we love you so much
[19:47] we thank you that this word is not just
[19:50] for young people but it's for 85 year
[19:53] olds 45 year olds 65 year olds 105 if
[19:57] there's any of that age here tonight
[20:00] we are so grateful father that your word
[20:03] never fails
[20:05] we ask you that you'd speak to us
[20:07] tonight help me to get out of the way
[20:08] make me sensitive Lord maybe a young
[20:12] person might not need but one or two
[20:14] words or maybe a sentence help me not to
[20:17] be restricted to notes or quotes or
[20:20] scriptures help me father to follow the
[20:22] channel of the Holy Ghost
[20:25] speak to us tonight with you Lord in
[20:27] Jesus name
[20:29] and the Saints said
[20:31] God bless you you may be seated I want
[20:34] to speak to you tonight by the help of
[20:36] the Lord
[20:37] on the power
[20:39] of assimilation
[20:43] most of us I'm sure know what
[20:45] assimilation means but I'll refresh your
[20:49] memory it happens to you every day when
[20:52] you eat
[20:54] your body will take the nutrients out of
[20:57] the food that you eat and it will divide
[21:00] it the body's a miraculous saying it'll
[21:02] separate carbs and protein and fats and
[21:06] all this and that and the other and
[21:07] sends it to the different parts of the
[21:09] body to be able to make it useful and
[21:12] then it will assimilate your cells are
[21:14] so designed by the Creator that they're
[21:17] able to retain proteins and fats and
[21:20] carbohydrates and vitamins and so on but
[21:23] yet that's not just so in our bodies
[21:25] listen to the word now what it means to
[21:28] assimilate to take in and incorporate as
[21:34] one's own to absorb
[21:38] to bring into conformity
[21:41] with the customs and attitudes of others
[21:46] and it also means to cause to resemble
[21:51] so assimilation is something that we do
[21:56] every day it is something that we have
[21:59] to be so careful about because the music
[22:02] you listen to the entertainment that you
[22:06] allow yourself to become involved in the
[22:09] people that you are around that you
[22:12] fellowship with that you spend time with
[22:14] we will assimilate from them certain
[22:18] things that's what makes us what we are
[22:21] our parents our our family our neighbors
[22:25] and those that we are around and we pick
[22:28] up this and that and the other and we're
[22:30] able to assimilate from them we pull it
[22:34] into our mannerisms and there's many of
[22:36] these things that are actually stored
[22:38] and our subconscious we don't even
[22:40] realize it you can watch family members
[22:43] and there's a certain trait that they
[22:45] will do maybe they have a certain life
[22:47] and you can watch one and the other and
[22:49] the other and they're not even aware
[22:51] aware of what they're doing because
[22:53] that's stored in their subconscious God
[22:55] made a great thing when they made a
[22:57] human being and he put several of the
[22:59] controlled units of us in the conscience
[23:02] level and then he put other things in
[23:05] the subconscious level I'm glad he did
[23:08] that because if he didn't whenever you
[23:10] and I went to sleep at night we would
[23:12] die in our sleep because our heart
[23:14] wouldn't keep beating our lungs would
[23:17] not keep expanding and going down and
[23:19] all that much of our mechanism of our
[23:23] human body God applied to the
[23:25] subconscious so it goes on every day you
[23:28] don't have to think about it you don't
[23:30] have to tear your heart to beat you
[23:32] don't have to tell all these things to
[23:33] do God committed that to the
[23:35] subconscious and that other things God
[23:38] committed it to the first concert you
[23:40] ever notice how that whenever you get
[23:42] used to say in your home if your home
[23:44] has a level two or three levels in your
[23:47] home and you've got eight or ten steps
[23:49] 12 whatever you have and you will go up
[23:51] up and down those steps and you just go
[23:53] up and down them up and down you don't
[23:55] even think about it and you will have no
[23:58] problem doing that until you start
[24:01] looking at those steps one day and
[24:03] thinking about either going up or down
[24:05] have you ever done that and whenever you
[24:08] will do that it will nearly every time
[24:10] confuse you and you're saying why in the
[24:13] world well I went up and down these
[24:14] steps for years of my life why am I
[24:16] doing this well I almost stumbled I
[24:18] almost fell well the thing is that
[24:20] you've taken from your subconscience the
[24:23] control that was committed to that and
[24:26] you're thinking about it in your first
[24:28] conscience and when you do then it
[24:31] confuses between the two levels and you
[24:34] see that's the way faith is sometimes
[24:36] that brother Brandon says about the Lord
[24:38] Jesus that he was totally unconscious of
[24:42] his face so you never find the Lord
[24:45] Jesus saying oh have I got enough Faith
[24:46] to do this can I do that and many times
[24:49] we want things so bad that we try not to
[24:52] reach for it in our conscience level and
[24:54] we pull it from the subconscious and the
[24:57] soul and then we set up a great battle
[24:59] going on where most of the time inside
[25:01] of our mind
[25:03] but we do assimilate and it can be so in
[25:06] a positive way but also in a negative
[25:09] way now before we go into the
[25:11] inheritance of Caleb hear our character
[25:14] tonight I'd like to give you just a
[25:16] little bit of a background maybe some of
[25:17] you know it maybe some night won't hurt
[25:19] you if you do know what to hear about it
[25:21] again but the Bible identifies Caleb as
[25:25] being a kennesite which I find very
[25:27] unusual that it does not call him an
[25:31] Israelite but it calls him a kennesite
[25:34] so he's of the tribe of kennes
[25:39] k-e-n-a-z which are of the descendants
[25:43] of Edom or the so actually
[25:48] Caleb was not a Jew but he was more of
[25:53] what we would classify as being a
[25:56] gentile before The Exodus coming out of
[26:00] the land of Egypt Caleb's father
[26:03] actually married a woman which was the
[26:06] daughter of her which was of the
[26:09] descendants of Moses now she was of the
[26:12] clan of chalubaya and the tribe of Judah
[26:17] now there were many Gentiles that merged
[26:21] from the Gentile nations of course to
[26:24] come into the Jews and some of them did
[26:27] so by marriage as this one did and
[26:30] others of them did so by accepting the
[26:34] Jewish faith so this man was brought
[26:37] into the clan or the tribe of Israel by
[26:41] marriage so his father married a Jewish
[26:44] woman and he was brought in into the
[26:47] tribes of Israel and he become a convert
[26:51] now the Jews did not have a 13th tribe
[26:55] for those who were converted from
[26:59] Gentiles to becoming Jews but what they
[27:02] did was us they themselves become
[27:05] assimilated into the tribes so they did
[27:09] not have say a said tribe for the
[27:11] Gentiles one for this that the other but
[27:13] they were assimilated into the tribes of
[27:16] Israel and they would become that now
[27:19] let me just remind you of a couple of
[27:21] other characters and one of them you're
[27:23] familiar with of course and that was
[27:24] Rahab Rahab brother Ron mentioned it
[27:27] this morning Rahab was an Amorite now
[27:31] she was not of course an Israelite but
[27:33] she was an Amorite Rahab the Harlot ruse
[27:38] was a moabitus and so we see a
[27:42] similarity at how that these people both
[27:46] Rahab and ruse were assimilated into
[27:50] what tribe the tribe of Judah and what
[27:54] tribe was Caleb assimilated into the
[27:58] tribe of Judah now Judah of course means
[28:03] praise so that's a real good tribe for
[28:06] the Gentiles to be assimilated into
[28:09] because if anybody's going to praise him
[28:11] for Grace it's going to be those of the
[28:14] tribe of Judah
[28:15] now maybe some of you here tonight you
[28:18] ain't got much to praise him for but I
[28:20] was born lost I was born blind I was
[28:23] born wretched I was born miserable I've
[28:26] got a lot to thank him for tonight
[28:28] now I want you to notice then that these
[28:31] three many more but these three that I
[28:33] want to focus on they were actually
[28:36] assimilated into the tribe of Judah
[28:39] which was identified as the king tribe
[28:43] or the Royal tribe it was of course the
[28:46] tribe by which our Lord in his flesh
[28:49] preceded and came forth from so Caleb
[28:53] then was given a special place now which
[28:56] again would be quite unusual because you
[28:58] have a man that was not really a Jew but
[29:01] yet called by Moses to be able to go and
[29:04] check out the promised land and him and
[29:07] Joshua will come back with a real great
[29:09] report of what the Lord had given them
[29:12] and then here were people that were Jews
[29:15] who said they'd been in the message for
[29:16] all their life and yet they come back
[29:18] with a report that we're not able to do
[29:21] this there's absolutely no way that we
[29:24] can go into this land you know it breaks
[29:27] my heart to not to say it but there are
[29:29] people in this message that are of the
[29:31] same frame of mind that we cannot have
[29:34] Revival in this end time that we cannot
[29:37] expect God to move for us and where do
[29:40] we get all that at now tell you what
[29:42] they do they go into our land which is
[29:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptizing
[29:48] us into the message of the hour that is
[29:51] our land and let me just tell you the
[29:53] message is more than just you learning
[29:55] how to quote something that brother
[29:56] Branham said but the message itself and
[30:00] whenever we catch it it is the
[30:02] revelation of the hour it is more than
[30:05] quotes it's more than just books and
[30:07] tapes laying in yourself or having it on
[30:10] your phone it is more than just
[30:12] something to where we talk about it is a
[30:15] reality it is your land for this hour
[30:19] this is why in the last several years
[30:21] that Satan is so attacked our lamb
[30:24] what's he trying to do exactly the same
[30:26] thing that he done to these people in
[30:29] that day get them to question The
[30:31] credibility of the prophet of God who
[30:34] told them about the land and they will
[30:37] become so discouraged they won't even go
[30:40] into the land well praise the Lord but
[30:43] you realize that Caleb was of the
[30:46] mindset he was not going to join sides
[30:49] with anyone who stood against his
[30:52] Prophet messenger it would do you and I
[30:54] good to have the same attitude today
[30:57] but you see Caleb had already
[31:00] assimilated into the people of God but
[31:03] not just with anybody that said they
[31:06] believed the word so Caleb had
[31:09] assimilated into those Believers which
[31:13] had a portion ordained on the other side
[31:15] now we realized everybody that was
[31:18] Israel actually wasn't Israel and
[31:21] everybody that started out did not wind
[31:24] up going in and we know Redemption has
[31:27] two parts the first part is coming out
[31:30] of and the second part is going into and
[31:34] Caleb had a made-up mind he was going in
[31:37] is there anybody here tonight that's got
[31:39] that same mind
[31:41] now Caleb must have experienced a lot of
[31:45] difficult things now we know of course
[31:48] that God tells them because you have
[31:50] brought this evil report there will be
[31:53] none of you none of you that will go
[31:55] into the land except Caleb now the word
[31:59] Caleb I'm sure you know means dog
[32:06] so here this man his Birthright was
[32:09] against him his name was against him he
[32:13] was a kennesite which was against him
[32:17] but yet he had accepted the power of
[32:22] assimilation to be able to assimilate
[32:25] into the message of the hour and I
[32:30] should become the word for that day
[32:33] now all these things were against him as
[32:36] I said last night these were facts that
[32:38] were against him but all he knew was God
[32:41] was calling him to a destiny Beyond his
[32:44] own natural birth I hope you realize the
[32:47] same thing tonight but you know that
[32:49] even though that he believed this it did
[32:52] not mean that that it took all the
[32:54] difficulty away from him now let's look
[32:56] at this that God has told him because
[32:58] you have denied me you've denied my
[33:01] words you have questioned the message of
[33:04] the hour you have questioned my
[33:06] prophet's credibility then there won't
[33:08] be a one of you and we know that the
[33:10] Bible says said that when they heard
[33:12] those ten spies they went into their
[33:14] tents that night and they wept and they
[33:17] cried and they said what the God we
[33:19] would have stayed in the land of Egypt
[33:21] was it because there was no graves in
[33:24] the wilderness why did you bring us out
[33:26] of here oh they had a fit and it come by
[33:30] what 10 message preachers that was
[33:33] telling them the days of Miracles are
[33:36] passed
[33:39] and all we can do now in the message is
[33:41] just barely hang on and just barely
[33:44] struggle to survive and we're gonna wait
[33:47] we're waiting and we're waiting and
[33:49] we're waiting we're not sure what we're
[33:51] waiting for I guess it depends on which
[33:52] preacher you talk to well some say we're
[33:55] waiting for Brother Brown to come and
[33:56] bring a temp others said what no he
[33:58] ain't going to bring no tent we're
[34:00] waiting for this man to come from over
[34:02] here am I waiting for that man to come
[34:04] over there well while you're waiting
[34:06] we're going to be rejoicing in the Lord
[34:08] we're going to be enjoying the promise
[34:10] of our God that he is the same yesterday
[34:13] today and forever
[34:18] but I want you to say now that there
[34:20] must be a span of time that will pass
[34:23] and all of those who accepted the
[34:26] negative report of them ten preachers
[34:28] has got to die because she remember
[34:30] reading in the Bible that God would let
[34:32] one plague out to another come and one
[34:35] thing I to another and Caleb saw
[34:38] thousands times thousands of his people
[34:42] die in the wilderness how discouraging
[34:46] it must have been but remember God give
[34:49] this man a twofold promise and that was
[34:52] the longevity of life he is not going to
[34:57] die and God also gave him the promise
[35:00] that he was going to get the land that
[35:03] he had marched upon and claimed as his
[35:07] own now you imagine every time the flu
[35:10] come around and every time covet got in
[35:13] among the camp that the devil said don't
[35:15] Caleb boy you ain't gonna make it this
[35:17] time I imagine he might have got
[35:19] pneumonia and he might have got this and
[35:21] that and the other but you know what
[35:23] Caleb said I've got a promise God said I
[35:26] ain't going to die I don't care what the
[35:29] devil died I don't care what the devil
[35:31] said let me just tell you something it
[35:33] all depends upon your perspective of the
[35:36] promise of God if you believe in all the
[35:39] stats may be against you all of
[35:41] everything else may be against him but
[35:44] if it's been revealed to you by the holy
[35:46] ghost that you are part of this bride
[35:49] there ain't enough Devils out of hell to
[35:51] stop you from getting your inheritance
[35:57] now Taylor but had there been a pretty
[35:59] strong individual to see all of the
[36:02] people in his age group pretty much die
[36:06] so thousands would die on the left and
[36:09] thousands would die on the right now
[36:11] again we're not talking about amalekites
[36:13] and jebusites and Hittites but we're
[36:16] talking about Israelites and they are
[36:18] dying like flies but God told him you
[36:22] ain't going to die
[36:24] you ain't gonna die so God sustained him
[36:28] during the difficult time look around
[36:30] what many of us have seen my brother Tim
[36:33] being here and some of these older folks
[36:35] they've been in the message many of them
[36:37] for decades of their life
[36:39] um now this this year holds a special
[36:41] year for me because in March the 27th of
[36:44] 1983 I just started a church in Kentucky
[36:47] and I introduced about the prophet
[36:50] messenger being uh the messenger of this
[36:52] age March the 27 1983. I was the
[36:56] Pentecostal preacher preaching in my
[36:58] Pentecostal church when I'd started
[37:00] there and I got up and the Lord had
[37:02] began to deal with me and revealed to me
[37:04] that he had sent a prophet in the last
[37:06] days so just a few weeks ago a few days
[37:08] ago 40 years I've been preaching this
[37:12] message 40 years I've seen all kinds of
[37:15] people come and go brother Tim seen way
[37:17] more than I have some of you here
[37:19] tonight have seen way more than I have
[37:21] but yet that does not change the credit
[37:23] ability of the message of the hour we've
[37:27] had people come and go to believe the
[37:30] sign the this that the other the truth
[37:32] of it is we still do believe the sign
[37:36] come on now we still believe that this
[37:38] word has been sent to gather a bride not
[37:42] call us to make another denomination but
[37:45] call us to the true baptism of the Holy
[37:48] Ghost and introduce us to the Lord Jesus
[37:51] Christ as the Living God which is the
[37:54] same yesterday today and forever
[37:58] we've seen them fall to our left we've
[38:01] seen them fall to our right we've seen
[38:04] preachers fall in adultery we've seen
[38:06] personalities raise and fall we've seen
[38:10] men raised with false Doctrine and send
[38:12] them around the world and cause a cult
[38:14] here and another clan there but is it
[38:17] going to move us absolutely not Caleb's
[38:21] all family members die he saw friends
[38:24] die but did it stop him he kept his eyes
[38:27] on the promise
[38:29] somebody hear me tonight he kept his
[38:31] eyes on the promise
[38:35] Hallelujah he lived upon it he sought
[38:40] upon it he breathed this word he talked
[38:44] about this word he assimilated this word
[38:47] now remember he didn't have a Bible he
[38:50] didn't have 1100 tapes to listen to he
[38:53] didn't have a whole lot of people of his
[38:54] age to encourage him but he had a word a
[38:58] direct word from the mouth of a prophet
[39:01] of God that you are not going to die but
[39:05] you are going to inherit that land maybe
[39:08] one year went by the second year went by
[39:11] it didn't happen the third year went by
[39:13] you'll imagine 40 years later he's still
[39:17] standing on the same promise of God he's
[39:20] all right he's 85 years old now maybe he
[39:23] don't look like he can get around and
[39:25] the people probably saw a poor guy you
[39:28] know he's just missing a little
[39:29] something he's ready for retirement you
[39:31] know I used to kind of laugh at folks on
[39:33] the talk about retirement but I've heard
[39:35] it said be nice to your children because
[39:38] they picked the nursing home you move
[39:40] into when you get older I tell you
[39:42] whatever it began to realize that you
[39:44] imagine that Caleb now 85 years old and
[39:48] standing up there that day and said let
[39:50] me tell you something Joshua I'm just as
[39:52] able today to go in and come back out
[39:56] I'm ready to fight don't you talk about
[39:58] retirement to me don't you talk about
[40:01] some nursing home and some Assisted
[40:04] Living Place Caleb said I don't need no
[40:07] Assisted Living place what I need is my
[40:11] Mountain
[40:13] I want my Mountain it's not my name
[40:17] wrote on it and I ain't talking about no
[40:20] Assisted Living I'm talking about no
[40:23] nursing home I'm talking about give me
[40:27] my mountain
[40:35] Otis in Joshua 14 7 40 years old was I
[40:38] when Moses the servant of the Lord sent
[40:40] me from kadishbarnia to a spy out the
[40:43] land and I brought him word again as it
[40:45] was in my heart I want you to notice
[40:47] where the word was wasn't in his head
[40:50] Malachi 4 is not a head message
[40:54] God didn't say I'll send Elijah to turn
[40:57] your head
[40:58] I'll send him to sin to turn your hearts
[41:00] that's what a lot of the folks have got
[41:02] though they got the message up here but
[41:04] the show ain't got it down here now his
[41:07] life is built upon faith in the Divine
[41:11] Promises of God and I want you to listen
[41:13] to this now carefully they were
[41:15] nourished and nurtured by installments
[41:20] of fulfillment
[41:23] now listen they were nourished and
[41:26] nurtured by installments of fulfillment
[41:30] you see God never gave it all to him the
[41:33] strength that he needed just at one time
[41:36] but God gave him installments or
[41:40] payments you see every day Glory every
[41:45] day was an installment of the
[41:49] Fulfillment of the prophet's promise
[41:52] every day brother Ron God gave him was
[41:56] another payment to the promise you're
[41:59] not going to die now it wasn't like that
[42:01] he just stood there and looked at it for
[42:03] it to all come way down here at the end
[42:05] but every day Caleb lived God gave him a
[42:10] payment on the promise and every time
[42:13] somebody is healed in our midst it is a
[42:17] payment toward the Rapture every time we
[42:20] see a miracle it is a payment toward the
[42:25] Rapture every time somebody gets hands
[42:28] laid on them and the spirit of God
[42:30] touches their body it is an evidence
[42:33] that the power that will change our
[42:36] bodies is already changing us from being
[42:40] sick to being well
[42:43] it is an installment toward the
[42:46] Fulfillment
[42:49] oh praise the Lord so Caleb is receiving
[42:53] installments of Filth form fulfillment
[42:56] rather every day all along the road so
[43:00] the two promises are longevity of life
[43:03] and he will be able to walk into this
[43:06] blessed land now once you notice how God
[43:08] will do it sometimes even even for your
[43:11] children the daily fulfillment of the
[43:15] one fed the fire of his face to the
[43:18] other
[43:19] so the daily fulfillment of getting up
[43:23] every day just rolling out of bed him
[43:26] getting up every day said praise God
[43:29] this day this promise is fulfilled why
[43:32] God promised him you're not going to die
[43:35] so we wait for sometimes great big
[43:37] miracles to happen weeks on down the
[43:39] road but every day you're up it's
[43:41] another day of fulfillment of the run
[43:43] every day that you're able to stand
[43:45] there and have Victory it's another day
[43:47] to roll out of bed and say all right
[43:49] devil where are you where are you devil
[43:52] I have lived to another night my God
[43:55] kept his word my God has moved for me
[43:58] another day I've been given the servant
[44:04] so the daily fulfillment of the
[44:06] longevity of his life fed the fire of
[44:09] his face
[44:11] that he's going to get his Mountain
[44:13] praise God notice this in verse 8.
[44:17] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[44:19] made the heart of the people Mel but a
[44:22] holy followed the Lord my God I didn't
[44:26] join up with him when they said well all
[44:29] we can do is just kind of sit around and
[44:31] wait now
[44:32] wait wait there's no way we can have no
[44:35] move now we know there's some of them
[44:37] Pentecostal preachers around the message
[44:45] of course people don't call me Pentecost
[44:47] they call me Church of Christ yeah
[44:51] I'd rather be called a Pentecost on this
[44:53] message than call the Church of Christ
[44:57] I'm not a bit ashamed I've been called a
[44:59] Pentecostal since I come in this message
[45:01] I'm not a bit ashamed to say I got the
[45:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a matter
[45:06] of fact I hear your prophecy and
[45:08] marriage of the lamb in Phoenix 1962. he
[45:11] said many Pentecostal people are ashamed
[45:15] of their Pentecostal experience well
[45:17] you're looking at one tonight that is
[45:19] not a shame to his Pentecostal
[45:21] experience I got more that are raising
[45:24] my hands I got more than I accept
[45:27] process my savior something got down
[45:30] inside of me and got a hold to my soul
[45:33] and regenerated me by the breaths of God
[45:36] hallelujah I have never been the same
[45:40] and I'm telling you he's not here
[45:42] tonight to do the same thing for you if
[45:46] you want it
[45:57] so imagine okay let me know he's 85
[46:00] . be careful
[46:03] don't hurt yourself everybody
[46:05] you know but now he had he's AARP cards
[46:08] stuck in this pocket and his Medicare
[46:10] stuck in that pocket United Healthcare
[46:12] card stuck over here
[46:18] notice verse 10.
[46:22] the Lord
[46:23] has Captain me
[46:25] alive
[46:31] daily installments was now leading him
[46:34] to the time of fulfillment to the
[46:37] ultimate goal

[50:23] it's coming over from that direction
[50:24] isn't it
[50:26] people said what is that noise
[50:28] don't pay no attention to it it's Caleb
[50:32] he's in their sharpen and his sword
[50:36] they tell me 40 years ago that man had a
[50:38] sword four foot long you sharpened it
[50:40] down now to it's about 18 and a half
[50:42] inches long and still coming down
[50:45] but Caleb done realize it don't matter
[50:47] whatever is how long it is what matters
[50:49] is how sharp it is
[50:55] how deep you are how famous you are how
[50:59] important you think you are that you
[51:01] want a shot too much inside that'll cut
[51:05] that devil's head off
[51:06] [Applause]
[51:20] [Applause]
[51:29] he said I am as strong this day
[51:34] as I was in the day when Moses sent me
[51:39] 85 years old
[51:41] now you expect me to believe
[51:44] that an 85 year old man
[51:46] it's a strong as a 40 year old man I'm
[51:50] not even 85 and I know better than that
[52:00] this man is not looking
[52:03] at natural circumstances
[52:08] the facts had certainly stacked up
[52:10] against him
[52:14] the young people some of these young
[52:15] guys bless his heart I admire his
[52:18] courage don't you
[52:21] man bless his heart Uncle Caleb tell us
[52:24] what was it like I'll tell one thing

[52:32] hold of them grapes I mean Them Grapes
[52:34] as that big around I'll tell you one
[52:36] thing I got in there in the presence of
[52:38] God I went down through there and I
[52:40] watched them through all them people and
[52:42] I thought Lord have mercy I can't wait
[52:44] to take my knife and cut their gizzard
[52:46] out I can't wait to get in there and
[52:49] take this land this might have come down
[52:51] Uncle Caleb calm down you're gonna hurt
[52:53] yourself
[52:59] so here he is that before Joshua
[53:02] can you imagine Joshua Naughton coupled
[53:04] the Deacons
[53:08] if he gets excited Brothers help him
[53:13] [Music]
[53:16] I watch him the day that Moses sent me
[53:19] ask my strength was then
[53:24] even so is my strength now
[53:30] for gardening
[53:32] for flowers
[53:34] for Bingo
[53:42] I will go to the senior citizens place
[53:45] and sit around and talk to the old folks
[53:48] you ever notice some people get really
[53:49] old
[53:51] how that they go to talking about things
[53:53] that was so many many years ago and talk
[53:56] about things they did
[53:58] all these spiritually everyone quiet
[54:03] I remember this and I remember that and
[54:05] that amazing Caleb is not talking about
[54:09] what was
[54:10] he's talking about what he is
[54:13] he's talking about what it
[54:16] and what God is fixing to do all he
[54:19] needs is Joshua's permission
[54:23] [Applause]
[54:25] this man still knew Divine protocol
[54:32] the prophet of God said that mountain
[54:34] was his
[54:36] why does he need Joshua's permission
[54:40] because Joshua was a man God placed in
[54:43] charge
[54:49] he said notice even so is my strength
[54:51] now
[54:52] for war
[54:57] him and the senior citizen voice is
[54:59] going to get into a checker War I guess
[55:03] imagine some of them young guys
[55:05] bless his heart we'll have to do
[55:07] something with him
[55:08] I mean whenever we get ready going and
[55:10] will I strap that dude in the bed he'll
[55:11] get killed
[55:13] this man is dangerous
[55:15] you're right he is dangerous all right
[55:18] and I'll tell you who is dangerous for
[55:20] the sons of the anakins
[55:25] the inanigans were the Giants who lived
[55:29] in the Southland in the land of Hebron
[55:34] the word a nanticum means long neck
[55:42] you imagine oh Kayla but have him dreams
[55:52] come to himself he said what are you
[55:54] doing why are you doing he said I swear
[55:56] to another one's neck tonight in my
[55:58] dreams
[56:01] oh they're most sons of the long neck
[56:04] well I'll tell you one thing our battle
[56:06] is to change some a little bit now I
[56:08] guess but now we're dealing with sons of
[56:10] the long tongue that long tongue lying
[56:13] devil that tells you you cannot be an
[56:16] overcomer that you cannot be filled with
[56:18] a holy ghost that we cannot have a
[56:21] bride's Revival oh yes we can we can't
[56:26] have a bride's Revival a bride's move
[56:29] we'll cut that long tongue out of their
[56:32] mouth
[56:46] you imagine it was like Oh Glory I can't
[56:49] feel it all over me right now
[56:52] he'd be back on his tent lifting their
[56:55] Malachi four weights
[57:01] let me give you a few of them Delight
[57:04] thou self also in the Lord and He will
[57:06] give Thee the desires of thy Lord
[57:08] if he abide me and my words abide in you
[57:11] ask what you will hitherto you have
[57:13] asked nothing in my name but ask now
[57:15] that your joy may be fulfilled if any
[57:18] two on Earth agree is touching any one
[57:20] thing it shall be given unto them
[57:22] whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in
[57:24] heaven whatever you loose on Earth
[57:26] that's the kind of waste we want to live
[57:28] brother sister until we assimilate into
[57:32] those promises we eat them we sleep and
[57:35] we drink them we dream about them
[57:45] oh
[57:47] oh my
[57:49] they probably had a Caleb committee
[57:53] our little brothers
[57:55] how they gonna take care of this guy let
[57:57] me ask you Deacon brother something how
[57:59] about you like to have an 85 year old
[58:00] like this in your church
[58:02] I've said before the Lord knew exactly
[58:04] where to put David he placed him in the
[58:06] Old Testament because if the Lord would
[58:08] allow David to live in this message in
[58:10] this day every Church on the message
[58:12] were to throw them out
[58:13] that man would have got so excited he
[58:15] didn't even have the Holy Ghost and he
[58:17] shouted and he danced and he jumped
[58:19] around what would he do if he'd heard
[58:21] about the Seven Seals what would David
[58:23] done if he'd heard about the seven
[58:24] churches at Malachi 4 and Luke 17 30.
[58:28] what would he had done if he had heard
[58:30] about a bride's Revival oh
[58:35] what are you gonna do
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:48] Caleb plays the foundation for his claim
[58:53] you know I find it amazing that God's
[58:55] prophet telling people when they're
[58:57] coming up to a prayer line to be prayed
[58:58] for
[58:59] and they need healing and deliverance to
[59:01] the body and he would tell them tell God
[59:05] why you want to be healed
[59:11] what does sickness do
[59:13] pull you away from your position
[59:19] I tell the Lord and have for several
[59:21] years now Lord
[59:24] Erica needs to be healed
[59:27] so she can be the right kind of wife
[59:30] the right kind of mother the right kind
[59:33] of daughter
[59:34] the right kind of daughter of God she
[59:37] wants to go to church Lord and she can't
[59:39] go to church that Devil's grabbed a hold
[59:42] of her she was called in the line of
[59:43] duty her doctor told her there's no need
[59:46] why you should even have this she has
[59:48] one of the rarest types into endocrine
[59:51] tumor one of the rarest type that there
[59:53] is in the world and yet all nobody's
[59:56] ever been healed as far as what they say
[59:58] but I think it'd be pretty awesome if
[1:00:01] hers is the first one on the list
[1:00:08] Our God can do it brother sister oh
[1:00:12] Hallelujah your name can be the first
[1:00:15] one on the list that got delivered of
[1:00:19] this and that and the other do you watch
[1:00:22] your Mountain
[1:00:24] [Applause]
[1:00:37] but it can be pretty hard
[1:00:39] when you're sitting in a doctor's office
[1:00:41] and they got a scan up on the wall
[1:00:44] this is your liver
[1:00:46] this is your brain
[1:00:48] this is your lungs
[1:00:52] and if we're not careful we'll get so
[1:00:54] accustomed to sickness and disease
[1:00:57] we start claiming it as our own
[1:01:00] pray for me my blood pressure is doing
[1:01:04] this my tumor you understand what you're
[1:01:07] doing
[1:01:08] you're claiming that as if though it
[1:01:11] belongs to you no that is a trespasser
[1:01:17] [Applause]
[1:01:19] Hallelujah
[1:01:23] [Applause]
[1:01:27] now listen he lays the foundation now he
[1:01:30] makes his request
[1:01:32] now therefore
[1:01:34] give me
[1:01:36] this mountain
[1:01:39] wherefore the Lord
[1:01:41] spake in that day and thought thou
[1:01:44] hardest
[1:01:46] in that day how the anakims were there
[1:01:48] and that the cities were great
[1:01:51] and fenced what's he quoting facts
[1:01:55] he didn't say about all there was no
[1:01:56] chance
[1:01:57] well there were no Giants I want you to
[1:02:00] look at them blind preachers that come
[1:02:01] out there 45 years prior to this and
[1:02:04] they said we will sought grasshoppers in
[1:02:06] our own sight and we were like
[1:02:08] grasshoppers in their side and I want to
[1:02:10] ask you something how did they know that
[1:02:11] did they go up and ask them that
[1:02:13] but they assimilated fear they
[1:02:17] assimilated into that fear and now
[1:02:19] they're speaking on behalf of their
[1:02:21] enemy
[1:02:22] the truth of it is every devil in hell
[1:02:24] is terrified right now in this presence
[1:02:26] of God every devil in hell is scared to
[1:02:29] death of every Holy Ghost Field child of
[1:02:31] God that's in this place tonight because
[1:02:34] the devil knows if we can move Beyond
[1:02:36] fear if we can move beyond the things of
[1:02:39] the flesh every devil in here will be
[1:02:42] subject to the Holy Ghost if we could
[1:02:45] get in one night and what a corn every
[1:02:48] person here could be free and less than
[1:02:51] five minutes time
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:03:05] the headaches were there
[1:03:07] cities will
[1:03:09] convinced
[1:03:12] fenced so be the Lord
[1:03:14] will be with me
[1:03:16] then I
[1:03:18] shall be able to drive them out
[1:03:24] as the Lord said
[1:03:29] now imagine maybe one of his caretakers
[1:03:31] come up and said hi brother Joshua
[1:03:34] brother Caleb is an overzealous
[1:03:37] Pentecostal sort of a brother
[1:03:40] we've never been able to calm him down
[1:03:42] glory to God
[1:03:45] we've never been able to get him down oh
[1:03:47] you can't even sing Amazing Grace How
[1:03:49] Sweet the Sound without shouting
[1:03:53] the first thing they're going to make us
[1:03:54] out it'll be amazing grace how sweets us
[1:03:56] out
[1:03:58] you remember the old man that had the
[1:04:00] daughter that lived in the city the
[1:04:01] prophet tells us about and she was a
[1:04:03] real high society
[1:04:06] so she won't have this tea party or
[1:04:08] eliminated I think the prophet said
[1:04:09] there's going to drink that pink
[1:04:10] lemonade stick her fingers on up in the
[1:04:12] air and she said Lord what am I going to
[1:04:14] do with my daddy because every time he
[1:04:16] reads the Bible he gets so excited he
[1:04:18] goes to getting real emotional so she
[1:04:20] said I know what I'll do I'll put daddy
[1:04:22] up in the attic
[1:04:23] so she took daddy up there and she said
[1:04:25] now daddy we're going to have this party
[1:04:27] and hold honey that's fine yeah that's
[1:04:29] fine but then now she said I I don't
[1:04:31] want to give Daddy no Bible because if I
[1:04:33] do he could all tore up
[1:04:35] so here they was drinking their pink
[1:04:37] lemonade and their little cucumber
[1:04:39] sandwiches and all that sort of thing
[1:04:40] and my everything was going really nice
[1:04:43] and she left her daddy a geography
[1:04:47] a book about oceans and lands and so on
[1:04:50] and they was down there and one woman
[1:04:53] may have had a cucumber sandwich at
[1:04:55] another out of squash sandwich and who
[1:04:57] knows they might have been eating
[1:04:58] asparagus and all kinds of that sort of
[1:05:00] stuff and all of a sudden the office
[1:05:03] racking above their head takes off
[1:05:06] and she said what in the world I know
[1:05:09] who that is that's Daddy
[1:05:10] we need more daddies like that
[1:05:15] [Music]
[1:05:25] too many of our daddies have got their
[1:05:27] heads stuck in their smartphone
[1:05:29] it's a shame on our smartphones are
[1:05:31] smarter than we are
[1:05:40] she goes running up the steps Daddy
[1:05:41] Daddy what are you doing you ain't got
[1:05:43] nobody said that no honey
[1:05:45] I said you're reading in this geography
[1:05:47] book here and they said there's some
[1:05:49] places in the ocean to see they can't
[1:05:51] find nobody until she said yeah I know
[1:05:53] that Daddy said well I just read another
[1:05:54] day in the Bible how that the Lord had
[1:05:57] cast my sins into the depths of the sea
[1:05:59] and according to this right here they're
[1:06:01] still falling they're still falling
[1:06:06] hey the old man assimilated the word if
[1:06:11] God's inside of your heart you can see
[1:06:14] him in a geography
[1:06:20] [Applause]
[1:06:33] so you imagine some of the folks
[1:06:35] they put Portland up up in a chariot
[1:06:39] and they said
[1:06:40] let's let's just drive him by one of
[1:06:44] them assisted home living things
[1:06:48] just see what he thinks
[1:06:50] where are they going oh we're going out
[1:06:52] here how compatible going over here to
[1:06:54] see some of this this fine property in
[1:06:56] the land of Israel I said
[1:06:58] hebron's that way
[1:07:02] I know we know we know we know but we
[1:07:05] just want to show you some scenery today
[1:07:08] so here the comma said a lot of old
[1:07:11] folks walking around like yeah
[1:07:14] all kinds of things I said good Lord
[1:07:18] you don't expect me to live there do you
[1:07:22] that's the way I say you don't expect me
[1:07:24] to live
[1:07:28] still yeah you expect brother Tim to
[1:07:31] live there look I've got needs my babies
[1:07:34] God needs my brothers God needs don't
[1:07:36] take me somewhere where the spirit of
[1:07:39] God is not welcome take me somewhere
[1:07:42] where the Holy Ghost is moving
[1:07:50] [Applause]
[1:07:55] Uncle Kayla we just thought maybe with
[1:07:58] you been 85 and everything
[1:08:00] that you might want to calm our love
[1:08:04] you know just more sedated
[1:08:07] just kind of laid back
[1:08:11] let me tell you something young people
[1:08:13] Satan won't even care
[1:08:16] if you belong to a message Church
[1:08:21] the thing he don't want to happen to you
[1:08:23] is
[1:08:24] for you to meet the power of the Risen
[1:08:27] Savior
[1:08:29] he offered Jesus a kingdom without a
[1:08:31] Calvary he'll offer you a position in
[1:08:34] this message without a new birth
[1:08:37] he'll offer you a position a deacon to
[1:08:39] trust you maybe even a preacher a song
[1:08:41] leader or a musician the thing that
[1:08:43] scares him to death is when young people
[1:08:45] meet the Lord Jesus like they did on the
[1:08:48] day of Pentecost Peter ain't God one
[1:08:50] Holy Ghost and we got another one we got
[1:08:53] the same Holy Ghost Peter had we got the
[1:08:57] same rights as Peter had
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:08] well you see there's a little bit
[1:09:09] concerned about his mind
[1:09:12] because what he had done before Joshua
[1:09:15] was
[1:09:15] he asked for the very same land
[1:09:19] that those other 10 message preachers
[1:09:22] had saw
[1:09:23] and come back and said oh we saw the
[1:09:26] Giants there
[1:09:28] man you told me that big
[1:09:33] but it all depends on what you're
[1:09:34] looking at
[1:09:38] brother Tim brother Timothy some of us a
[1:09:40] few years ago
[1:09:42] went into Israel
[1:09:44] we was able to go down
[1:09:46] into the valley of elah
[1:09:49] amen
[1:09:51] we got out and walked up and down that
[1:09:53] Valley there
[1:09:55] picked up some rocks
[1:09:58] you said why'd you do that for because
[1:10:00] one of my kin folks
[1:10:02] had fought a battle there
[1:10:05] you don't know yet either but he's one
[1:10:06] of yours too David was his name
[1:10:11] Hallelujah
[1:10:13] you imagine Saul and his army looking at
[1:10:15] some of them them Giants and the
[1:10:17] Philistines okay let's look at the same
[1:10:19] things so whether you're a young boy
[1:10:21] which was a teenager or whether you're
[1:10:23] an 85 year old man it runs in our family
[1:10:26] to kill Giants
[1:10:30] Hallelujah if you're 16 of 15 or 80 or
[1:10:36] 85 if you're bothered with cancer if
[1:10:39] you're bother with high blood pressure
[1:10:41] if you're bothered with the besetting
[1:10:43] sin it runs in our family to slay Giants
[1:11:00] so they had known that something poor O
[1:11:03] Caleb is maybe it's pre-dementia
[1:11:10] it's probably all Hummers
[1:11:12] setting in on him
[1:11:14] he said why would you say that because
[1:11:17] he asked for the very land
[1:11:19] that men with sins
[1:11:22] and renowned and great sensibility said
[1:11:25] we should never go there
[1:11:28] and the poor old guy
[1:11:30] that's what he asked for
[1:11:32] we drove him by this new Assisted Living
[1:11:34] place
[1:11:36] and we told him that we would take care
[1:11:38] of him it would be able to come and
[1:11:40] visit him every now and then became
[1:11:43] I don't want that place
[1:11:45] wow
[1:11:46] I'm looking for a neck to slice
[1:11:52] oh come on young people don't look at me
[1:11:54] that way my goodness you ever wanted you
[1:11:57] all to be devil stomping next slice and
[1:12:00] tongue speaking Holy Ghost feel used in
[1:12:03] this last day that will not back up to
[1:12:05] the devil you'll
[1:12:07] look up to lust you're not back up to
[1:12:09] rock and roll music you're not back up
[1:12:12] to the sexual perverse society that we
[1:12:15] live in that you'll stay in short ground
[1:12:18] and say give me my mountain
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:37] ain't no need you trying to come to me
[1:12:39] and get me to join believe the sign
[1:12:45] no need you trying to come to me and
[1:12:47] tell me this message ain't right but
[1:12:50] brother Tony we can point it out facts
[1:12:56] that brother random said this number
[1:12:57] here and that number there you're
[1:12:59] looking at the facts but I'm looking at
[1:13:01] the truth he will seal the prophet sent
[1:13:03] from God he was a human being
[1:13:13] Oh Glory
[1:13:16] and you see one shot someone the
[1:13:17] children of Israel shall win the land
[1:13:18] the Southland crossed Jericho
[1:13:21] children Brethren took Jericho they go
[1:13:23] into the Southland Hebron was right
[1:13:26] there next to Jericho
[1:13:29] they run all the Giants out but they
[1:13:32] kept advancing North East and West now
[1:13:36] it's 45 years later them Giants simply
[1:13:39] left for a while and come back
[1:13:46] according to Joshua chapter 1 verse 12
[1:13:47] verse 11 chapter 11 verse 22 if you'd
[1:13:50] like to read it
[1:13:52] so they move back in
[1:13:54] you see they had to spend years
[1:13:56] of clearance
[1:13:58] clear enemy
[1:13:59] then they had to change their tactics
[1:14:00] they spent the rest of their life
[1:14:02] keeping the enemy out the more they
[1:14:03] cleared it out
[1:14:05] so just because you're delivered to this
[1:14:07] and that don't mean oh praise God I got
[1:14:08] delivered Hallelujah you'll never bother
[1:14:10] me again oh no the devil's smarter than
[1:14:12] that he won't attack you maybe in front
[1:14:15] of these men of God that's going to pray
[1:14:16] for you tomorrow night but he'll wait
[1:14:17] till you get home on Tuesday and then
[1:14:19] that desire will come back to look at
[1:14:21] this or that or the other or to say this
[1:14:23] or die of the other but you've got to
[1:14:25] have your ground Caleb you've got to
[1:14:27] stand there with sword and hand and say
[1:14:29] come on devil come on devil I warn you
[1:14:33] in the name of Jesus I got something
[1:14:35] that that can't mean it that was more
[1:14:38] than emotion I got power
[1:14:42] our power
[1:14:54] you see the majority of those spies
[1:14:57] measure the Giants against their own
[1:14:59] strengths
[1:15:01] Caleb and Joshua measure the Giants
[1:15:04] against the strength of Jehovah
[1:15:08] brother Donnie will you attack that
[1:15:10] devil no way
[1:15:12] you say brother Ron wants to meet this
[1:15:14] devil on his own
[1:15:16] nobody in the right mind but want to
[1:15:18] meet the devil on his own but greater is
[1:15:21] here that is in you
[1:15:25] You are not alone when you get the Holy
[1:15:28] Ghost
[1:15:32] now look at verse 13. and Joshua
[1:15:36] blessed him
[1:15:38] amen
[1:15:40] and gave unto Caleb the son of jefani
[1:15:44] Hebron
[1:15:46] for an inheritance
[1:15:49] Hebron therefore became
[1:15:52] the inheritance of Caleb
[1:15:55] the son of jafani akinazite
[1:16:01] now the word has been claimed and the
[1:16:05] allotment has been assigned to the man
[1:16:07] who owns it
[1:16:09] and the Giants have not moved at all
[1:16:12] isn't it amazing Joshua's word when
[1:16:15] Joshua said okay it's yours it's yours
[1:16:17] Joshua's word did not drive the anakams
[1:16:21] off of the mountain
[1:16:24] I hope you're hearing me
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:28] you see many of our people that those of
[1:16:30] us who do believe in prayer lives and we
[1:16:32] believe in prayer for the sick and we
[1:16:34] believe in people praying to things but
[1:16:36] many times people come through prayer
[1:16:37] lines and they come up people in their
[1:16:39] own service and they're praying that God
[1:16:41] will deliver them of something to the
[1:16:43] anointed men of God's hands one
[1:16:45] sometimes what you're praying for is
[1:16:47] going to have to be overcome by you and
[1:16:50] Jesus together not just the prayers of
[1:16:53] your pastor
[1:16:54] can go up every service pray for me I'll
[1:16:57] do this pray for me I'll do that pray
[1:16:59] for me I'll do that and some of us are
[1:17:01] just lazy Christians
[1:17:05] should you not going for prayer yes but
[1:17:08] when you've gone up for prayer then

[1:17:52] so honored
[1:17:55] to been given the land

[1:18:00] Hebron was the place
[1:18:02] at which Sarah Abraham's wife had died
[1:18:06] before there was Timeless kill Josh arba
[1:18:09] was the name of the place originally
[1:18:12] called Hebron renamed by the

[1:18:17] restored under the restoration of the
[1:18:19] Bride coming back in
[1:18:23] Hallelujah it was formerly called Church
[1:18:26] of God it was formerly called Church of
[1:18:29] God in Christ his formerly called
[1:18:31] Apostolic this that and the other but
[1:18:33] your name's been restored back to what
[1:18:36] John the Baptist called you in the Book
[1:18:37] of John whenever it said the friend or
[1:18:40] the bridegroom rejoices because he hears
[1:18:42] the bridegroom's voice it was a man with
[1:18:44] the spirit of Elijah on him and he uses
[1:18:47] the word Bride for the first time in the
[1:18:49] New Testament well glory to God so a man
[1:18:52] with a spirit of Elijah on him talks
[1:18:55] about a bride getting her place and a
[1:18:57] man come back in the end time of the
[1:18:59] spirit of Elijah on him and said I no

[1:19:26] Sarah dies Abraham purchase
[1:19:28] a field
[1:19:30] with a cave in it in the field Cave of
[1:19:33] Matt Pila
[1:19:34] the cave of two mouths
[1:19:37] two entrances the only possession
[1:19:39] Abraham ever actually owned in the land
[1:19:43] of Canaan when he was alive
[1:19:46] and he had a tidal deed to it
[1:19:48] and that title deed goes to Joshua
[1:19:54] praise God a man that was assimilated
[1:19:58] into the tribe
[1:20:02] Oh Glory
[1:20:05] it was the only piece of land that
[1:20:07] Abraham could say with this and it did
[1:20:09] amazing that God would give that to a
[1:20:11] man like this why he wholly followed the
[1:20:14] Lord
[1:20:15] with all of his heart look at how God
[1:20:17] honors this look at how God looks at
[1:20:20] this and God looks at this and so how
[1:20:23] it's not because our voice is so
[1:20:25] beautiful to sing it's not because we
[1:20:27] can do this or that but when we follow
[1:20:29] the Lord with all of our heart God
[1:20:30] absolutely loves that
[1:20:33] and Satan absolutely hates it
[1:20:39] here Abraham was buried Isaac was buried
[1:20:43] Jacob was buried Joseph was buried years
[1:20:48] later
[1:20:50] and Caleb winds up with it
[1:20:56] Caleb city became a city
[1:21:00] of Refuge
[1:21:06] brother Donnie you message preachers you
[1:21:08] mean you don't want the lost to come in
[1:21:10] we do
[1:21:13] well the way you all preacher sound like
[1:21:15] to me you don't want no homosexuals to
[1:21:16] come in oh no no no no no no you're
[1:21:18] misunderstanding that totally we want
[1:21:20] him to come in but we just don't want
[1:21:22] them to go out the same way they came
[1:21:23] here
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:33] since we relocated in our new building
[1:21:35] there's a woman heard about us and she
[1:21:36] started coming to church
[1:21:38] started wearing britches of course
[1:21:39] that's what she's used to well after a
[1:21:41] few services
[1:21:43] she noticed nobody else in the church
[1:21:44] women anyway was wine britches well she
[1:21:48] told one of the deacons she said well I
[1:21:50] figure y'all don't wear a pants here he
[1:21:51] said no ma'am she said well I'll tell
[1:21:54] you I've got a hard time with this
[1:21:55] makeup I'm an ugly woman and she said it
[1:21:57] may take me a little while but I believe
[1:21:59] I can give it up too now I'm stood up
[1:22:02] and preached on it but something about
[1:22:04] the Living Word setting in the pews
[1:22:07] begin to convince that woman's heart
[1:22:10] Oh Glory what was it the message that
[1:22:15] was being lived in the pews spoke to
[1:22:18] that woman's father and said this is not
[1:22:21] right oh that's what we want that we
[1:22:25] become the message
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:33] oh
[1:22:36] so Caleb City become a City of Refuge
[1:22:43] but it also become a city
[1:22:45] of the priesthood
[1:22:49] so they just didn't believe in tapes
[1:22:51] only
[1:22:56] well I figured I'd get quiet on that but
[1:22:58] that's all right the Lord God started
[1:23:01] out this gospel in the beginning in Acts
[1:23:03] 2 with preachers preaching the word if
[1:23:05] he wanted to he could have had tape
[1:23:07] recorders in the first century and they
[1:23:09] could have started playing Jesus tapes
[1:23:11] Peter's tapes Paul's tapes Apollo's
[1:23:14] tapes and then brought it right back
[1:23:15] around and ended it up with tapes but he
[1:23:18] started it out with preachers and
[1:23:19] apparently he started it out the way he
[1:23:21] wanted it and he will end it the way he
[1:23:24] started it I don't care who says
[1:23:26] different they're contrary to God's word
[1:23:30] God called men and he said preach
[1:23:34] preach
[1:23:36] praise the word I'll stop Devils heal
[1:23:40] the sick
[1:23:50] let me close
[1:23:52] Joshua 15 13.
