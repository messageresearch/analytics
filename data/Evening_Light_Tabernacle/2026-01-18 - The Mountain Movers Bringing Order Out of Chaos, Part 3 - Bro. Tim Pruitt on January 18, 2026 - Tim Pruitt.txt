Speak a word this morning, oh Lord, that would comfort us in our, oh Lord God, day by day living, oh Lord. Lord, speak a word, oh Lord Jesus. Lord, I remember, Lord, back in the Bible times, oh Lord, when, oh Lord God, the churches of Israel, oh Lord Jesus, had asked, oh Lord God, to hear your voice, oh Lord. And Lord God, you had it all set up, oh Lord, and you had it all planned. And on that day, Lord God, I know that there was expectation, oh Lord, in the hearts of those that would hear word from heaven, oh Lord God. And so Lord, we stand this morning, oh Lord, WITH EXPECTATION, OH LORD GOD, IN our hearts, oh Lord God. Lord God, longing to hear your voice this morning, longing to hear word this morning, longing, oh Lord God, to hear, Lord God, from heaven this morning, oh Lord, but I thank you, Father God, that it was not, oh Lord God, as it is now, Lord, for Lord, they couldn't endure, Lord Jesus, what was being spoken, BUT LORD GOD, WE have received, oh Lord, the fullness of the word, oh Lord God, and we know what to do with the word, oh Lord.

Let's just worship him a moment. &gt;&gt; Just express it from your heart. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, you're my God, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; my savior, &gt;&gt; my God, my king, &gt;&gt; my everything. &gt;&gt; Today we bow before you, the lamb that is worthy, the lamb that opened the seals, that revealed the mysteries." Oh God, the one who is worthy &gt;&gt; of all who heaven and earth declares the worthiness of this great one who became our redeemer. Oh God, I'm willing just to sit up on a lofty throne and let the world go by and lost. But Lord, you came down and become one of us. God condemned, walked among us in humanity, gave your life for redemption. Lord, we want to say thank you. Thank you for your grace, Lord. I ask, Lord, you bless every person in this place today with your presence. May you visit them right there in their seats as you walk this aisle. We know you can't do in the physical form what you did 2,000 years ago, but you're here in the form of your Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You can come and visit everyone. Lord, speak to every life. Reveal yourself in a very personal way to them. &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, that you will bring healing and deliverance, salvation to those that are lost. May we just be gripped today by the word of God and it change our lives. Lord, may it bring men and women out of chaos &gt;&gt; and bring them into divine order. I pray, oh God, it'll speak to lives. Speak to hearts today. Anoint this service, oh God, in ways that is way beyond man. Lord God, let it be more than just theology to us today or just a a lecture from the Bible or a little lesson that is given. But oh God, may it be power packed and dynamic, the word live, the spirit breathe. Let it come Lord and move over this audience today. I pray God as it does, may the day dawn, the day star rise in hearts and lives and your word be revealed to your children. We ask it in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's good to be in the house of the Lord today and &gt;&gt; a place that we have dedicated unto him. And of course, you are the temple of the Holy Ghost. That's the real house of God. That's where he wants to dwell cuz he don't dwell in temples made with hands. &gt;&gt; But when we come together, we bring him here. &gt;&gt; Amen. For he comes wherever two or more gathered in his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we welcome you today in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Pray that he'll speak to you today. Turn with me to Genesis chapter 1 and verse one. It's just a scripture that we have been dealing with since the beginning of the year as the Lord spoke to me as we came to the close of the year of bringing order out of chaos. So I want to speak on that again this morning and I have two places in the scripture that I want to read from Genesis 1 and1 and then down through verse three and then Psalms 33 and verse 6. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. In Psalms 33 and verse 6, by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. He gatherth the waters of the sea together as a heap. He layeth up the depth in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the Lord. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spake and it was done. He commanded and it stood fast. Amen. God bless you. Can be seated. As I said this morning, we're going to be speaking on bringing order out of chaos. A subject that we have been speaking on the last few services. I want to I want to speak on it again, but I'm going to just kind of look back and review a little bit as we go into this message this morning. Bring back to our memory again what we are speaking about. In Genesis 1, we see the Bible opens with a scene of disorder. The earth was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep. There was no shape, no life, no clarity, nothing but emptiness and darkness. Yet the spirit of God moved. And I think that's very key. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God moved. And then came the turning point of all creation and God said. So with God speaking, now the word is released. Right? &gt;&gt; And and so when his word was breathed out of his spirit uh by his spirit, then light appeared. If you notice, it speaks and says, "Let there be light." And God's answer to the disorder of the earth was his word. That's always his answer to disorder is the word of God. For where the word is released, then darkness must retreat and order must begin. And that same truth is echoed again in in Psalms 33 that we read where David pulls back the curtain and shows us the secret of the universe. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made. For he spake and it was done. He commanded and it stood fast. And that means that creation is not held together by chance. And let me tell you, your life isn't supposed to be held together by just sheer willpower, but by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Everything that STANDS STANDS BECAUSE GOD commanded it to stand. &gt;&gt; And the same God who spoke light into a dark world is speaking today. He's speaking into homes. He's speaking into hearts. He's speaking into churches. He's speaking into broken lives. And every time his word is received, then chaos starts losing its grip. &gt;&gt; Because when God speaks, order is born and life began. Now you too, if you're a born again Christian today, you were born of the breath of God, the spoken word. Your new birth, the moment God began to bring order out of your life, he it started you when you begin to give heed to a sure word. Peter calls it a more sure word of prophecy and said, "We do well to take heed to it as unto a light in that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and THE DAY STAR ARISE IN YOUR HEARTS." &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what happened to you. the the light of God's word shone into the chaotic darkness that once covered your soul and IT BEGAN TO DRIVE OUT CONFUSION and fear and sin &gt;&gt; because I TELL YOU THE NEW BIRTH IS NOT MERELY CHURCH JOINING. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLY EMBRACING A doctrine &gt;&gt; or a set of teaching or a BUNCH OF RULES. IT'S THE word becoming life inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture said again, first Peter 1:23, being born again by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THE SAME GOD THAT SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT," it spoke again into your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when THE WORD WAS RECEIVED, LIGHT ENTERED AND FAITH AROSE. AND THE HOLY GHOST BEGAN TO BRING to your inner world a INTO A DIVINE ORDER. AND WHAT WAS ONCE VOID AND empty became uh filled with life until Christ became real within you. WHICH MEANS CHRIST in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; And and we have learned that order was turned to chaos in the in heaven because one star, AN ANGEL GOT OUT of order &gt;&gt; by exalting himself. &gt;&gt; We know that was Lucifer. He wanted to be his god and to be worshiped. AND HIS FALL CAUSED ONETHIRD OF the angels to fall with him. &gt;&gt; Now, Eden was an extension of heaven. And in Eden, everything moved in harmony with God. Adam and Eve would live under divine order and life flow and creation obeyed and fellowship was unhindered. BUT THE MOMENT THAT GOD'S WORD WAS QUESTIONED, &gt;&gt; the moment it was disobeyed, that's when order collapsed. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID IN GENESIS 2:17 THAT IN THE DAY THOU EATEST THEREOF, that day you shall surely die. AND AND WHEN THEY FELL, DEATH ENTERED. &gt;&gt; Not just physical death, but spiritual disorder, separation from God. &gt;&gt; AND THEIR FEAR REPLACED peace and SHAME REPLACED INNOCENCE. AND BLAME replace unity. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID IN GENESIS 3:8, THEY HID themselves from the presence of the Lord God. YOU SEE, THE VERY FIRST SIGN OF CHAOS WAS SEPARATION FROM GOD, AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, FROM THERE CAME CHAOS IN THE HOME. &gt;&gt; Chaos between the siblings of Cain and Abel. THE DISORDER DIDN'T STOP WITH ADAM AND EVE. THAT MULTIPLIED to their children. &gt;&gt; Cain and ABEL BROUGHT OFFERINGS TO GOD, BUT CAIN'S HEART WAS WRONG. And when God corrected him, Cain refused repentance. And because of this, HE SAID, "SIN LITH at the door." AND THIS LITERALLY MEANS THAT THAT SIN CROUCHED LIKE AN ANIMAL, YOU KNOW, AWAITING Cain's next move because he would not repent. And I'll tell you, WHEN GOD BRINGS SOMETHING TO YOUR LIFE AND YOU WILL and to your attention and you will not repent of it, sin always lies at the door. &gt;&gt; You see, BUT CAIN LOVED THE WORKS OF DARKNESS AND THAT OF CHAOS RATHER THAN THE OFFER OF LIGHT THAT BRINGS ORDER. AND INSTEAD OF MASTERING SIN AND OVERCOMING IT, Cain made murdered his brother. The the first DEATH THAT WAS CAUSED BY HUMAN VIOLENCE. And then THE BIBLE SAID IN GENESIS 14:10, "THE VOICE OF THY BROTHER'S BLOOD CRITH unto me from the ground." YOU SAY, "WHAT WAS THIS?" THIS WAS CHAOS THAT WAS MOVING FROM THE HEART NOW into human relationships. &gt;&gt; AND NOW THERE THIS IS A PRECEDENT that begins that starts upon THE EARTH WHERE VIOLENCE THEN BECOMES NORMAL. &gt;&gt; AS GENERATION PASSED, SIN would intensify. Murder was no longer shocking. IT BECAME BOASTFUL AND AND THE BIBLE SPEAKS OF LAMECH WHO OPENLY BOASTED AND CELEBRATED killing and vengeance. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 4:23 through 24 he SAID, "I HAVE KILLED A man for wounded me, a young man for injuring me." And then he said, "If be avenged sevenfold, truly lay 70 and seven uh 70 and sevenfold." Do you see? IN OTHER WORDS, SOMEBODY CROSSED ME, &gt;&gt; SO I KILLED IT. &gt;&gt; AND IF CAIN GOT SPECIAL PROTECTION, I DESERVE WAY MORE. AND LIFE HAD LOST ITS SACREDNESS. &gt;&gt; VIOLENCE HAD BECOME entertainment &gt;&gt; and pride AND ORDER WAS DISSOLVING RAPIDLY, AND THE WORLD WAS GOING MORE AND MORE INTO CHAOS. AND AND THIS SHOWS YOU HOW FAR THAT MANKIND HAD FALLEN since Eden. THAT VIOLENCE WAS NOT ONLY HAPPENING, IT WAS BEING CELEBRATED. &gt;&gt; And and I WANT YOU TO NOTICE WHAT LAMECH DOES. HE ACTUALLY TWISTS GOD'S MERCY into a an excuse FOR SIN. FOR GOD HAD PUT A MARK UPON CAIN TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM killing him. For he said in Genesis 4:15, "Therefore, whosoever slayth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on HIM SEVENFOLD." THAT SEVENFOLD WAS NOT CAIN BEING RIGHTEOUS, BUT IT WAS GOD RESTRAINING the spread OF VIOLENCE SO SOCIETY WOULD NOT COLLAPSE IMMEDIATELY. BUT YOU SEE, LAMECH TAKES THAT PROTECTION AND HE TURNS IT INTO A personal slogan. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IN GENESIS 4:24, "IF CAIN SHALL BE A AVENGED SEVENFOLD, truly a lame 70 and sevenfold." You see, you see, IN OTHER WORDS, HE MEANT IF IF CAIN GETS SEVENFOLD PROTECTION, I DEMAND 70 sevenfold. I AM MORE IMPORTANT THAN CAIN. YOU touch me and you'll pay. HE HE WAS CLAIMING A HIGHER RIGHT TO TO VENGEANCE than Cain. Like like HE'S UNTOUCHABLE. &gt;&gt; AND THIS SHOWS THE THE GROWTH OF CHAOS AFTER THE FALL. CAIN MURDERED ONCE AND HE FEARED CONSEQUENCES. LAMECH MURDERS AND HE BOASTS. YOU SEE THIS IS SIN AS IT GROWS AS IT ESCALATES. IT'S GETTING BOLDER. CONSCIENCE IS GETTING HARDER. VIOLENCE IS NORMALIZING AND IT'S A PART OF THE DOWNWARD spiral that leads to the flood where the BIBLE SAID AND THE EARTH WAS filled with violence. AND LAY HE REPRESENTS THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD TODAY. I'LL HANDLE IT MYSELF. &gt;&gt; HE'S REJECTING GOD'S ORDER. HE'S REPLACING IT WITH PERSONAL JUSTICE WITH A WITH INTIMIDATION. AND AND THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF GOD'S WAY BECAUSE GOD COMM WOULD WOULD COMMAND RESTRAINT. HE SAID IN ROMANS 12:19, "VENGEANCE IS MINE. I WILL REPAY saith the Lord." AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO YOU see lay is saying VENGEANCE IS MINE. I WILL do the repaying. &gt;&gt; YOU TOUCH ME, YOU'LL PAY FOR IT. AND LAY USE 70 AND SEVENFOLD TO BRAG ABOUT REVENGE. &gt;&gt; Oh listen. But Jesus would use the same phrase. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To teach forgiveness. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 18:22, he speaks to Peter and he said about forgiveness. He said, "I say not unto thee unto seven times, but unto 70* 7." &gt;&gt; DO YOU NOTICE? IT'S LIKE JESUS TAKES THE DARKEST BOAST &gt;&gt; OF EARLY HUMANITY AND HE FLIPS IT INTO HEAVEN'S ORDER. &gt;&gt; LAYMENT SAYS, "I have unlimited revenge." AND JESUS SAID, "YOU give unlimited forgiveness." &gt;&gt; You see, THAT IS ORDER OUT OF CHAOS. LAMECH WAS SAYING, "I AM VIOLENT AND I'M PROUD OF IT AND I DARE ANYONE TO COME AFTER ME BECAUSE I'LL BE A MORE AVENGE THAN CAIN EVER WAS. THE PAYBACK WILL BE MUCH HARDER." &gt;&gt; You see, IT'S ONE OF THE CLEAREST SIGNS THAT GENESIS IN GENESIS THAT MANKIND WAS SLIDING FAST TOWARD LAWLESSNESS, WHICH THE BIBLE SAID WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE LAST DAY. a spirit of lawlessness upon THE PEOPLE WHERE VIOLENCE BECAME CULTURE AND PRIDE would replace repentance. &gt;&gt; AND BY GENESIS 6, CHAOS HAD REACHED EVERY every level of of the every facet of human life. AND GENESIS 6 AND5 GOD SAW THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN WAS great in the earth and that the every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was on on evil continually. &gt;&gt; NOTICE THE LANGUAGE. EVERY IMAGINATION &gt;&gt; ONLY evil continually. &gt;&gt; SIN WAS GLORIFIED. &gt;&gt; ITS EVILS JUSTIFIED. THERE WERE NO RESTRAINTS LEFT. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO REVERENCE. THERE WAS NO BOUNDARIES. THERE WAS no restraints. &gt;&gt; Think of that the mixing of boundaries. Genesis 6:2 said he it speaks about that violation of divine boundaries. And it said it talks about the increasing corruption, confusion. It says the SONS OF GOD SAW THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN that they were fair and took them wives of which they chose. And what IS CLEAR HERE WAS GOD'S ORDER was being violated. &gt;&gt; And finally, the whole earth is filled with violence. &gt;&gt; AND GOD GIVES A FINAL ASSESSMENT IN GENESIS 6:11. THE EARTH WAS CORRUPT BEFORE GOD. AND THE EARTH WAS FILLED WITH VIOLENCE. SO IT WASN'T OCCASIONAL. IT WASN'T EVERY ONCE IN a while a little bit OF VIOLENCE. IT FILLED THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; SOCIETY ITSELF HAD BECOME CHAOTIC. &gt;&gt; IT IT WAS LAWLESS. IT WAS CRUEL. AND THE BIBLE, AS WE HAVE QUOTED IN GENESIS 6:5, HE SAW THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN WAS SO GREAT in the earth. And that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only on evil continually. &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it. as it was in the days of Noah. I want to ask you, what are your thoughts set on? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; What are you feeding on? &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, MUCH OF THE ENTERTAINMENT today is built on cruelty, &gt;&gt; violent movies, &gt;&gt; vicious gaming, humiliation, &gt;&gt; revenge, &gt;&gt; AND DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT THAT DOES, IT SLOWLY TRAINS THE HEART TO BECOME cold and insensitive. Because what you repeatedly watch begins to feel normal &gt;&gt; even if God calls it evil. &gt;&gt; AND CONSTANT EXPOSURE DULLS THE CONSCIENCE UNTIL IT NO LONGER WARNS LIKE IT USED TO. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE BIBLE SAID HAVING THEIR CONSCIENCE seared with a hot IRON &gt;&gt; AND IT TURNS PAIN then into spectacle INSTEAD OF SORROW. SO, YOU KNOW, IT BECOMES SOMETHING THAT that we feed on and and it and WHAT IT DOES, IT FEEDS the animal. &gt;&gt; IT FEEDS THE FLESH INSTEAD OF the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE TELLS YOU TO DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. IN ROMANS 13:14, HE SAID, "CLOTHE YOURSELF WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND DO NOT THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT GRATIFY the desires of the flesh." &gt;&gt; Amen. SO ALL OF THIS IS MAKING PEOPLE FEEL A LOT LESS COMPASSIONATE, &gt;&gt; making them more insensitive TOWARD REAL SUFFERING. &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE BIBLE SAID THE LOVE OF MANY SHALL WAX COLD. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. As iniquity abounds because why? Little by little the soul will crave stronger stimulation. &gt;&gt; That's right. you know, AND IT GROWS HARDER UNTIL DARKNESS FEELS ORDINARY. &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE BELIEVER MUST ALWAYS AS A BELIEVER, YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR HEART AND YOUR MIND AND YOU GOT TO FEED ON WHAT IS PURE, WHAT IS HOLY, WHAT IS LOVELY TO STAY TENDER in this cold, dark world. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, you know, of one of the sober verses in the scripture in Genesis 6:6. It repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart. This was not God reacting in rage. He was responded in sorrow. &gt;&gt; CREATION HAD MOVED SO FAR FROM THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE &gt;&gt; THAT ONLY RESETTING ORDER COULD PRESERVE LIFE. And I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THOUGH ONE STATEMENT. IN ALL OF THIS WORLD OF CHAOS, THERE'S ONE STATEMENT THAT THAT STANDS OUT IN GENESIS 6:8. BUT NOAH FOUND GRACE. &gt;&gt; NOAH FOUND GRACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE EYES OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW DID HE DO THIS? OH MY. You see, NOAH DIDN'T SAVE THE WORLD BY FORCE OR REFORM, BUT BY WALKING WITH GOD. AND GENESIS GIVES ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL STATEMENTS IN THE OF ALL THE BIBLE CONCERNING the days before the flood. And in Genesis 6:9, Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations. And Noah walked with God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want that to be my testimony. when the world is going in CHAOS &gt;&gt; THAT HE CAN FIND SOMEBODY &gt;&gt; that he can say is perfect &gt;&gt; IN HIS GENERATION. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY THAT IS WALKING WITH GOD IN THIS DAY AND HOUR &gt;&gt; IN AN AGE IN A WORLD THAT WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD HAS SLIPPED INTO CHAOS WHERE EVERY IMAGINATION OF MAN'S HEARTS AND HIS THOUGHTS ARE ON EVIL CONTINUALLY NOAH STOOD OUT AS A WITNESS. IT TELLS ME IF GOD CAN HAVE A MAN THEN, GOD CAN HAVE MEN AND WOMEN TODAY, BOYS AND GIRLS WHO CAN STAND THE WITNESS IN THEIR AGE AGAINST WHAT IS WRONG AND WHAT FOR OR what is right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; While everybody else followed the imagination of their heart, Noah followed revelation from God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know how it happened. You know, sometimes it gets so dark in the world, but when again, when God speaks, revelation dawn &gt;&gt; AND HE WALKS WITH GOD. AND WHEN A MAN WALKS WITH GOD, GOD PULLS HIM OUT OF CHAOS IN the age that he's LIVING IN AND PLACES HIM in his own continuity. &gt;&gt; And no doubt Noah learned something. I'm sure he watched the men who walked before him. Scripture tells us that Enoch walked the same path. In Genesis 5:24, Enoch walked with God and he was not. For God took him. Oh, think about it. Before before America, before the Soviet Union had astronauts in the in space, God had was not there. &gt;&gt; Amen. HE HAD MEN THAT WALKED WITH GOD AND WAS NOT. NOTICE HERE, HIS WALK WAS SO CLOSE. SO UNINTERRUPTED THAT HE WAS TRANSLATED OUT OF THE REALM OF DEATH. AND HEBREWS CONFIRMS IT IN 11:5. HE SAID, "BY FAITH, ENOCH WAS TRANSLATED THAT he should not SEE DEATH. FOR BEFORE HIS TRANSLATION, he had this testimony that he pleased God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it. IF THEY COULD PLEASE GOD IN THAT EVIL AGE, &gt;&gt; GOD'S GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN THIS AGE HE ALWAYS HAS A WITNESS. &gt;&gt; HE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'LL STAND FOR TRUTH. &gt;&gt; When all the world is going into deception and Enoch was a living proof that walking with God does not lead into deeper confusion. Although the world may have ridiculed him, walking with God though leads an upward divine order. And and and because he didn't he did not blend with his age. He overcame it. And Noah living in the generation after him, he had a pattern. And I tell you, I'm glad that there's men that we can look back at and we can see in that generation, they stood FOR GOD. IN THAT GENERATION, they overcame. IN THAT TIME, GOD HAD A WITNESS. BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU GOD'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE THIS AGE WITHOUT a witness. &gt;&gt; He going to raise up men and women &gt;&gt; who will stand for for the truth, WHO WILL WALK WITH HIM. AND IN THOSE EARLY GENERATION, GOD WOULD OFTEN leave signs and testimonies and it would be even in their names. YOU SEE MARKS OF REVELATION PLACED IN FAMILY LINES. Scripture itself tells us that names carry meanings and they mean they mean they carry prophecies. Like the name given to Jesus, his name would be called Emmanuel WHICH IS SAYING GOD WITH US. You you see Enoch named his son Methuselah, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that's a NAME THAT IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT POINTS TOWARD JUDGMENT AND is often explained or interpreted when he dies it shall be sent or when HE DIES THE DELUGE WILL COME. SO ACTUALLY ENOCH WOULD prophesy &gt;&gt; and he WOULD AND HE WOULD NAME HIS SON and say WHEN HE DIES HERE'S MY PROPHECY. SO YOU KNOW NOAH WATCHED ELITH'S prophecy &gt;&gt; which was METHUSELAH &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SEE THE GOD WAS WARNING THE WORLD LONG BEFORE THE FLOOD EVER FELL BECAUSE GOD IS MERCIFUL EVEN IN JUDGMENT. &gt;&gt; He never seen sins judgment without a warning first. And the scripture declares this mercy real clear. Said Methuselah, because we know Methuselah lived longer than any other man AS AS THOUGH GOD STRETCHED TIME OUT TO THE LIMIT. HE WAS GIVING SPACE TO REPENT. For the Bible said in SECOND PETER 3:9 THAT GOD'S NATURE IS like this. The Lord is longsuffering &gt;&gt; toward usward, NOT WILLING THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH, BUT THAT ALL SHOULD COME TO REPENTANCE. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE LONGSUFFERING OF GOD THAT WE'RE EVEN HERE TODAY. &gt;&gt; I think we're on borrowed time. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S BEEN GOD'S LONGSUFFERING TO HOLD OFF THE JUDGMENT OF THE WORLD &gt;&gt; TO GET EVERY NAME THAT'S IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'LL NOT CLOSE THE BOOK. HE WILL NOT FINISH IT UNTIL EVERY NAME HAS BEEN DIPPED IN BLOOD AND THAT HE CAN RAPTURE a people off of the earth. &gt;&gt; I want to be among that number. Don't you? &gt;&gt; You know, Jewish tradition also says that when Methuselah died that on the day he died, Noah entered in the ark. And after the seven days of mourning were finished, then judgment came. You see, when God shut the door, there was no longer any mercy. There was judgment that was being sealed. In Genesis 7:4, it does MENTION, "FOR YET SEVEN DAYS, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth." But on that seventh DAY SPAN WAS GOD'S FINAL COUNTDOWN TO JUDGMENT. AND IT WASN'T AN OPEN INVITATION ONCE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED. LET ME TELL YOU FRIENDS, ONE DAY THE DOOR WILL BE CLOSED. AND THE CLOSING OF THE DOOR IN THAT DAY. WHEN GOD SHUT THE DOOR, IT WAS NOT NOAH GOING IN AND SHUT THE DOOR. GOD SHUT THE DOOR. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD SHUT THE DOOR, IT WAS THE DIVIDING LINE. JUST LIKE JESUS TAUGHT IN THE PARABLE OF THE VIRGINS. THE BRIDEGROOM CAME and the virgins that were ready went in with him to the wedding and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, God gave space of repentance until the day that Noah entered the ark. But when Noah went in and the Lord shut the door, the day of mercy was over and then judgment was set in motion. &gt;&gt; And when God takes his bride home, when he takes his people out of here, mercy for the Gentile dispensation is over. And that's the real warning we want to understand today. There comes a MOMENT &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SEALS his decision. Right. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT MAN CALLED DELAY WAS ACTUALLY GOD'S LONGSUFFERING WAITING BEFOREHAND. BUT AFTER THE DOOR SHUT is no longer waiting time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible cleared the is clear. The B the world is not heading toward improvement. It's heading toward judgment fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Peter 3:10 says, "THE DAY OF THE LORD WILL COME in which the HEAVENS SHALL PASS AWAY WITH a great noise, and the ELEMENTS SHALL MELT with a fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be BURNED UP." SO JUST AS THE ANTIDOLIVIAN WORLD WAS JUDGED BY WATER, this present world is reserved for fire. AND SECOND PETER 3:7 SAID, "THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WHICH ARE NOW ARE KEPT IN STORE, RESERVED UNTIL THE fire at the day of judgment." &gt;&gt; So just as in Noah's day, there's a divine order in the end time program. &gt;&gt; Yeah. First God removes his own, takes a bride away, and then judgment begins. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus SAID WE SHOULD PRAY ALWAYS &gt;&gt; TO BE COUNTED WORTHY &gt;&gt; TO ESCAPE THE THINGS THAT ARE COMING on the earth. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND ENOCH WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE FLOOD. THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THE BRIDE WILL BE RAPTURED BEFORE THE TRIBULATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE ENOCH WAS RAPTURED FIRST and then the world went into judgment AND THE TRIBULATION SAINTS WENT THROUGH the judgment with Noah. SO, ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD and he was not for God took him. That's Genesis 5:24. But Noah was preserved through the wrath as he says in Genesis 7:1. Come thou and all thine house into the ark. And once Noah entered, GOD SHUT THE DOOR. AND THE LORD SHUT HIM IN. THE BIBLE SAID, AND THIS IS A TYPE OF THE CLOSING OF MERCY. WHEN GOD SHUTS THE DOOR, NO MAN CAN OPEN IT. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SHOWED THAT SAME REALITY WE'VE ALREADY QUOTED IN THE PARABLE OF THE VIRGINS. AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT. AND HE WARNED IN MATTHEW 24:37, "AS IN THE DAYS OF NOAH, so shall it be in the c so shall be the coming of the son of man." So there's coming a moment when the bride is taken &gt;&gt; and the gentile age is close and SCRIPTURE IT SHOWS THE CHURCH GATHERED IN AND THEN GOD TURNS HIS dealings again and watch Romans 11:25 blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in. THAT'S RIGHT. SO, GET THE POINT. YOU SEE, THEY'RE BLIND FOR A SEASON, &gt;&gt; BUT WE HAVE A TIME LIMIT on us, &gt;&gt; AND IT'S CALLED THE FULLNESS OF THE GENTILES. &gt;&gt; And once that's completed, &gt;&gt; the gospel turns back to the Jews. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT FULLNESS IS IS COMPLETE, THEN GOD SHIFTS AND THE DOOR SHUTS. THE BRIDE IS GONE AND JUDGMENT BEGINS. And when Enoch leaves, Noah enters. &gt;&gt; And God does not judge the his people with the world. Instead, he makes a way of escape. &gt;&gt; And that's the pattern that we see over and over again. A translation before wrath, an arc provision for the remnant, then judgment falls. But I want you to get the scripture. I want you to hold this tight in your heart because we are seeing pre-tribulation plagues coming upon the earth. And we are seeing evil as it comes in reflecting the days of Noah where the hearts of men are evil continually. BUT FIRST THESSALONIANS 5 AND9 GIVES US A PRECIOUS PROMISE. GOD HATH NOT APPOINTED US to wrath. &gt;&gt; BUT TO OBTAIN SALVATION, DELIVERANCE BY our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm glad for that PROMISE TODAY THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT WHEN THE WORLD GOES INTO COMPLETE CHAOS AND WILL GUL INTO TOTAL DARKNESS, THERE will be a bride called out of there &gt;&gt; into his marvelous light and a rapture. &gt;&gt; And today we are watching the prophetic stage set itself. We see Israel is back in the land just as the prophet spoke. All the word of God spoke of this. We see the world is ripening in violence. We see the corruption. We see the lawlessness just as in Noah's day while the age gets darker and darker but in this very time there is a people THERE IS A BRIDE that is being called to readiness &gt;&gt; for the revelation chapter 22:17 said and the SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY COME &gt;&gt; AND EPHESIANS 5:27 SAYS THAT HE COME THAT HE MIGHT PRESENT IT TO HIMSELF A GLORIOUS CHURCH &gt;&gt; AMEN THAT SHOULD HOLY AND WITHOUT BLEMISH BEFORE HIM. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So I want you to look around. This is not random. This is not politics only. This is prophesy moving. &gt;&gt; It's a bride preparing. It's a It's a remnant being positioned. It's a WORLD THAT HAS REJECTED the word THAT HAS THORN UP WRATH FOR THE DAY WHEN THE HEAVENS WILL burn with a fervent heat. And that's why the message today is urgent. &gt;&gt; Get into Christ now. &gt;&gt; Very important. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAKE READY BECAUSE WHEN GOD SHUTS THE DOOR, &gt;&gt; it'll be too late &gt;&gt; to almost believe. &gt;&gt; Noah's message is simple, but it's a mighty message. &gt;&gt; In a world of chaos, it's still possible to walk with God. And when God gives revelation, that revelation becomes an arc of safety. &gt;&gt; AND NOT BECAUSE THE WORLD GROWS BETTER, BUT BECAUSE THE MAN WHO WALKS WITH GOD HAS FOUND DIVINE ORDER IN THE MIDST OF A COLLAPSING CIVILIZATION. Genesis 6:8, Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the flood, THE FLOOD WAS GOD RESTORING ORDER. IT WAS GOD'S GREAT RESET. to the earth. You see, IT WAS GOD CLEANSING CHAOS IN GENESIS 6:13. AND GOD SAID TO NOAH, "THE END OF ALL FLESH IS COMING before me." And you see, water returned temporarily to Genesis 1:2 condition without form and void so that God could preserve life through one man and began all over again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND FROM ADAM TO THE FLOOD, GOD'S WORD WAS DOUBTED. FELLOWSHIP WAS BROKEN. SIN MULTIPLIED. VIOLENCE FILLED THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; BOUNDARIES WERE ERASED. LIFE LOST ITS VALUE. CHAOS RULED. &gt;&gt; AND YET EVEN THEN, GOD PRESERVED THE SEED. &gt;&gt; HOW DID HE DO IT? BY SENDING A MESSAGE. BY GIVING A WORD, &gt;&gt; A SURE WORD OF PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT WOULD PRODUCE LIGHT IN THE DAY THAT THEY WERE LIVING AND GIVE THEM A WAY OF ESCAPE. &gt;&gt; The flood was not the end. It was God once again bringing order out of chaos. It was proven that when man destroys himself, God still remembers mercy. But Noah found grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's always been God's way. If you can look, you can watch it after the flood from from Babel to Abraham, we see the same unchanging truth. God does not repair rebellion. He separates from it. &gt;&gt; Never in all the moves of God did he repair the rebellion. He separates from it. WHEN HE CALLED LUTHER OUT, HE DID NOT RE REPAIR the rebellious church, the the Catholic church. HE HE CALLED THE PEOPLE OUT. WHEN THE LUTHERAN REBELLED AND TURNED THEIR MUSIC, THEIR MOVEMENT INTO CHAOS, ONCE AGAIN, GOD CALLED THE PEOPLE OUT. AND THAT WAS TRUE OF WESLEY. THAT WAS TRUE OF ISUZA STREET. BUT IN THIS LAST DAYS, THE CALL OF SEPARATION COMES EVEN LOUDER. IT IS THE CALL TO LEAVE FOR TO STAY MEANS YOU ARE GOING TO RECEIVE THE PLAGUES. In Revelation 18 and4, AND I HEARD ANOTHER VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAYING, "Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, &gt;&gt; and that you receive not of her plagues." And whenever the word is received, his people come out. &gt;&gt; And when they come out, order is restored &gt;&gt; and purpose then is clarified. and a people are formed to become a body who walks in alignment with him. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE HAS DONE FOR US IN THIS LAST DAY. THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED, THE WORD SPOKE, LIGHT SPRUNG UP, AND IT AND IT BROUGHT TO ORDER SCRIPTURE THAT HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN THE DARKNESS. AND THEN COMES SEPARATION FROM THE DARKNESS. AND OUT OF THE CHAOS, SEEDS OF GOD SPRING TO LIGHT. Now in that day, Abraham was a seed that was called out of chaos of of the chaos of Babylon to go to a land of promise. Now later his seed would leave that land and would go down into Egypt. And Israel lived down in Egypt for more than 400 years. In the days of Joseph, they were blessed and they were protected and they were dwelling in the choice land of Gan. And there was order and provision and favor. But the scripture tells us in Exodus 1:8, there arose a new king over Egypt who knew not Joseph. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN JOSEPH'S TESTIMONY was forgotten, Satan got into the mix and THE PEOPLE OF GOD WERE REDUCED TO SLAVES. AND ONCE AGAIN, ORDER gave way to chaos &gt;&gt; and bondage would replace blessings. AND FEAR REPLACED FAVOR. AND THEIR LIVES NOW WERE CRUSHED UNDER THE TASKMASTERS. AND THE BIBLE SAID THEY CRIED AND THEIR CRY CAME UP before God. Oh, I want you to understand God hears when YOU CRY. &gt;&gt; JUST AS THE BEGINNING OF CREATION, WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS, GOD MOVED AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND THIS TIME, HE WASN'T MOVING OVER OCEANS. HE WASN'T MOVING OVER THE SEAS AND AND AS THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED, BUT AS THE SPIRIT MOVED, HE WAS MOVING OVER A NATION, A NATION THAT WAS TRAPPED IN BONDAGE. &gt;&gt; AND IN A WILDERNESS PLACE, HE REVEALS HIMSELF TO MOSES IN A BURNING BUSH, A SACRED LIGHT THAT BLAZED. AND THAT FLAME WAS MORE THAN A WONDER. IT WAS A LIGHT BREAKING INTO DARKNESS. IT WAS GOD'S PRESENCE STEPPING DOWN INTO CHAOS. That fire, THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, that flame was a light in that time of darkness. &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD STEPPING DOWN INTO HUMAN CHAOS. From that pillar of fire, from that light came a living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A word that was alive, A WORD THAT HAD POWER IN IT, A MESSAGE OF DELIVERANCE. And God said in Exodus 3:7 and 8, I have surely seen the affliction OF MY PEOPLE AND I HAVE come down to deliver them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH MY. I HAVE COME DOWN. &gt;&gt; GOD STEPPING INTO THEIR CHAOS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THAT MOMENT, THE GOD WHO ONCE SAID, "LET there be light," spoke again. And his word began to bring order where chaos had reigned. What was it doing? It was God MOVING HISTORICAL PROMISES forward by his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch this very carefully because this is what God does. HE STEPS DOWN INTO CHAOS. He did it by sending a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. What's he doing it for? to bring the light, the word that was spoken to Abraham and his seed that would sojourn in a strange land that be afflicted and that with a mighty hand he would bring him out. That prophecy HAD LAID DORMANT FOR 400 YEARS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BUT NOW WHAT IT WAS NOT WHAT HAD BEEN A PROPHECY ON ABRAHAM'S LIP NOW BECAME A PRESENT TENSE ACT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; And the word was quickened and released from God. AND WHEN IT'S RELEASED AND GOD BREATHED, IT IS SET INTO MOTION. AND WHAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN GOD'S FORNOWLEDGE IS NOW COMING INTO REAL manifestation in real time. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Because when God speaks in any age, the promise stops being something distance in the far past and starts becoming deliverance. &gt;&gt; That word was not only for Israel. It was spoken over the power of Egypt. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT WAS SPOKE OVER THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS &gt;&gt; THAT IT THAT IT GOT THEM INTO THIS CHAOS THAT IT HELD THEM CAPTIVE. AND THAT WORD SAID TO SATAN, "LET MY PEOPLE GO." &gt;&gt; God's word confronted the bondage. It broke the ITS AUTHORITY. AND I'LL TELL YOU, THAT'S WHAT IT'LL DO FOR YOU TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS STEPPED DOWN. AND I'M TELLING YOU BY THIS MESSAGE THIS MORNING, GOD IS STEPPING DOWN INTO YOUR CHAOS, &gt;&gt; THE CHAOS THAT SATAN HAS BROUGHT IN YOUR LIFE. AND HE'S PUTTING SATAN ON NOTICE. &gt;&gt; LET MY PEOPLE GO. &gt;&gt; THOSE IN BONDAGE, THOSE ENSLAVED IN SIN, ENSLAVED IN PORNOGRAPHY, ENSLAVED IN SEXUAL VICES, ENSLAVED IN IN ADDICTIONS TO GAMING OR DOPE OR ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER IT IS. GOD STEPS OUT OF SILENCE ONCE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AS THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES AND SPEAKS IN THE CHAOS, SAYING, "LET THERE be light." &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, the Bible, the Bible is clear. When he comes and steps into chaos, &gt;&gt; Amen. Death leads, sickness leads, SIN LEADS, THE POWERS OF HELL ARE BROKEN. AS THE MESSAGE is released, IT SAYS, "LET MY PEOPLE GO." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THOSE BOUND WITH HEART TROUBLE OR ARTHRITIS OR CHILDREN CONDEMNED TO BONDAGE WITH GENETIC DISORDERS. YOU KNOW, LET ME TELL YOU, FROM A PILLAR OF FIRE COMES A MESSAGE. FROM A LIGHT COMES A MESSAGE. I HAVE COME DOWN. I HAVE HEARD THE CRY OF MY PEOPLE. I HAVE SEEN YOUR SUFFERING. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. I ACKNOWLEDGE, BUT I'M DOING MORE THAN ACKNOWLEDGE IT. I'M STEPPING INTO YOUR chaos and I'M GOING TO BRING ORDER INTO YOUR LIFE. I'M GOING TO CHANGE YOU FROM DARKNESS INTO LIGHT AGAIN. AMEN. THIS IS A MESSAGE TO ALL THE OPPRESSORS THAT WILL HOLD GOD'S PEOPLE BOUND. AND IT SAYS, "LET MY PEOPLE GO." DEVILS, HEAR IT LOUD AND CLEAR TODAY. AMEN. THOSE THAT ARE BOUND, THOSE THAT ARE TORMENTED, THOSE THAT ARE OPPRESSED, LET MY PEOPLE GO. WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S GOD STEPPING down &gt;&gt; into chaos &gt;&gt; to bring order. &gt;&gt; He's reaching out to the prodals. Satan, that wicked taskmaster forced them into sin. And I'll tell you, the message of today is apply the token of the blood &gt;&gt; of Christ to your house. Gather in the house. Don't leave from under the protection of the blood. &gt;&gt; Stay under its protection. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. ROAST THE LAMB WITH FIRE. GET ONE BIG ENOUGH FOR YOUR FAMILY. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO JUST TELL YOU, IF YOU GOT PRODALS OUT THERE, &gt;&gt; better get a bigger ONE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PRODALS ARE BEING RELEASED FROM BONDAGE. HE'S NOT JUST GETTING YOU WHO ARE CHURCH MEMBERS FREE. &gt;&gt; HE'S REACHING OUT. &gt;&gt; IF HE HAS TO GO TO THE HIGHWAYS AND THE BYWAYS &gt;&gt; TO THE HAWK, THE LAME, THE BLIND, HE WILL DO IT ALL. HE'S GOING TO GET HIS ELECT. &gt;&gt; HIS tables will be full because you and let me tell you again, your prodals are being released. OH, I FEEL THE WITNESS OF THE HOLY Spirit today. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. YOUR RADICALS are being released. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; For the message from the pillar of fire warned Satan, "Let my people go &gt;&gt; and let me prophesy, your loved ones are coming home. &gt;&gt; The last call comes to those in the streets, the highways, the bike byways, and Satan may have warped them. &gt;&gt; He may have crippled them. He may have blinded them. But the call is all one and the same. come home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride say &gt;&gt; come. And right now God is awakening prodals. &gt;&gt; And what's HE SAYING TO HIM? AMEN. HE IS SAYING there is food in the father's house. &gt;&gt; THERE'S IT'S ENOUGH. YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH OF EATING WITH THE SWINE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT BRINGS AN URGE IN THE HEARTS &gt;&gt; OF EVERY PRODAL. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING'S HAPPENING. IS SAYING, "I'M GOING HOME." &gt;&gt; AND THE ANGELS ARE STIRRING OUR HEARTS NOW. OH, COME YOU SINNERS, lost and lonely. Jesus blood can MAKE YOU FREE. &gt;&gt; OH, WE HAVE SO MANY THAT CAN TESTIFY. For he saved the worst among us when he saved a wretch like me. I'll tell you what, looking over this audience today, looking to over men and women, it comes to my mind even right now. Let me tell you, if he can save Elizabeth, &gt;&gt; he can save you. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES, HE BRINGS chaos into order. &gt;&gt; YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY SHE PUSHED HER WHEELCHAIR UP TO THE ALTAR, &gt;&gt; SAYING, "I'M THROUGH WITH SIN. &gt;&gt; I'M THROUGH WITH FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF. I'M THROUGH WITH THIS AFFLICTION. I WILL NOT SIT IN THIS WHEELCHAIR AGAIN. AND GOD TOOK THAT CHAOS OUT OF HER LIFE AND MADE A NEW CREATION WITHIN HER WITH A PURPOSE THAT INSTEAD OF BEING A BURDEN TO LIFT other burdens. AND NOW HER TESTIMONY IS BEAR YOU ONE ANOTHER'S BURDENS AND SO FULFILL the law of Christ. &gt;&gt; Showing the love of Christ to other. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister Liz. Amen. It's the transforming power of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I know. &gt;&gt; Yes, I know. &gt;&gt; Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean. &gt;&gt; But look what happened with Israel. IT WAS NOT JUST AN escape from Egypt, but it was a transformation. Think of it. HE TOOK A NATIONS OF SLAVES and began to form them into a people of divine order. Given them his law, his presence, his covenant. A scripture SAYS IN PSALMS 105, HE BROUGHT THEM OUT to give them lands of the heathen. You see, this is God's pattern. When his people are crushed by chaos, he moves by his spirit. He releases his word. AND WHEN GOD SPEAKS, DELIVERANCE BEGINS. AND THEN THAT'S WHEN CHANGE FALLS AND THAT'S WHEN ORDER IS RESTORED. &gt;&gt; Now we know we could go through the history and I I do want to give you a little history today and today Sunday is a day where we take Sunday morning service and Sunday night we put them together. We have one service because many of us travel from a distance. But I just want to speak to you for a moment about Israel. Israel walked in the order of God's word and he enjoyed the blessings that flowed from it. God blessed them and brought them to a land flowing with milk and honey. &gt;&gt; They built homes. They planted vineyards. They raised families that lived under protection and provision that obedience brings. &gt;&gt; And and the Bible speaks of it in Deuteronomy 6:24. The Lord commanded us to do all these statutes for our good always. And where the WORD IS HONORED, THERE'S ALWAYS PEACE. &gt;&gt; There's stability. There's increase when the word is honored. &gt;&gt; Yet even a good lamb, sin nature still dwelt in the heart of man. And it's the law that was given could not restrain behavior because well it couldn't truly restrain it because it couldn't change the heart. AND SLOWLY ISRAEL WOULD DRIFT. AND THE BIBLE IS SUMMITED UP IN JUDGES 21:25 that every man THEN DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES. And from THE TIME OF THE JUDGES THROUGH THE ERAS of the king, Israel would move in cycles. Orders to order, blessings, rebellion, chaos, order, blessings, rebellion, chaos. It was a cycle of revival and death. God would send a prophet. The people would repent and order would be restored for a generation, but their children or maybe their grandchildren would turn away and chaos would return. &gt;&gt; It was a vicious cycle. And I just want to say this is a cycle we must break &gt;&gt; because Satan is trying his best to infiltrate the message with fallen angels &gt;&gt; because fallen angels f, you know, they they follow every move. And and you can see it where the same thing happens. You know, it happens again and again through the ages. And Israel would experience this over and over again. And eventually God revealed through Isaiah how far things had fallen. You you see they had worship THAT HAD CONTINUED RIGHT ON ALL THEIR FORMS. They had their temples AND SYNAGOGUES AND SO ON. BUT LIFE WAS GONE. &gt;&gt; SACRIFICES WERE STILL BEING OFFERED. BUT HEARTS WERE FOLLOWING FAR AWAY FROM GOD. THE LORD SAID IN ISAIAH 1:11, "TO WHAT purpose is this multitude of your sacrifices unto me, sayeth the Lord?" Look at WHAT HE SAID. I AM FULL OF THE BURNT OFFERINGS OF RAMS AND THE FAT OF FED BEASTS. AND I DELIGHT NOT IN THE BLOOD OF BULOCKS or lambs or hegoats. OH, HE WOULD GO ON DOWN IN VERSE 13 AND SAY, "BRING NO MORE VAIN OF OBLATIONS. INCENSE HAS BECOME IS AN ABOMINATION TO ME." LOOK AT WHAT HE'S SAYING. WHAT WHAT HAD ONCE BROUGHT ORDER HAD NOW BECOME A STENCH in his nostrils &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WORSHIP HAD TURNED INTO RITUAL. That's right. &gt;&gt; I want you to get this. &gt;&gt; Satan had made it appealing though. It looked like order, &gt;&gt; but it was chaos. IT WAS REFINED. IT WAS STRUCTURED. IT WAS IMPRESSIVE TO THE EYE, BUT IT WAS EMPTY of life. &gt;&gt; THE SINCERITY WAS GONE IN THEIR WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; IT HAD just become a custom. Amen. &gt;&gt; A RITUAL, A HABIT OF THEIRS. &gt;&gt; This is what we do. We're Jewish people. This is what Moses commanded. And it no, it all lost its meaning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's see how far they fell into chaos in 2 Chronicles 36:15. And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up the times and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place. But they mocked the messengers of God. They despised his words. They misused his prophets until the wrath of the Lord rose against his people until there was no remedy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Caldes WHO SLEW THEIR YOUNG MEN with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and the church and had no compassion upon young man or made an old man or him that stooped for age. He gave them all into his hands. and the vessels, THE SACRED VESSELS OF THE HOUSE of God, GREAT AND SMALL, THE TREASURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD, AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING AND OF HIS PRINCES. ALL THESE HE BROUGHT TO BABYLON, AND THEY BURNT THE HOUSE OF GOD, AND BREAK DOWN THE WALL OF JERUSALEM, AND BURNT ALL THE PALACES THEREOF WITH FIRE, AND DESTROYED ALL THE GOODLY VESSELS THEREOF. And them that escaped from the sword carried he away into Babylon, and they were they were made servants to him and his sons and and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia. &gt;&gt; So let's look at this for a moment. Something happened because worship had been turned to rituals. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAID, "YOU'LL NOT STAY IN MY LAMP." ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You see, YOU CANNOT REPLACE THE POWER IN THE PRESENCE OF God with rituals. &gt;&gt; FORMALITY CAN NEVER TAKE ITS PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN JUDAH WAS CARRIED AWAY IN THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY, the temple was destroyed and the sacrifices ceased and the priestly system could no longer function as God had ordained it. And with no altar, no priesthood operating in fullness and no central place of worship. The Jews were forced to adapt. And during this time, there were gatherings for prayer and scripture reading, instruction begin to form. And the earliest roots of what later became the synagogues. And while Israel was in Babylonian captivity, being that there was no temple to worship in, Solomon's temple had been destroyed and the people carried away far from their homeland to a strange land with strange influence. AND THE PSALMIST WOULD CRY, "HOW SHALL WE SING THE LORD'S song in a strange land?" And sacrificial worship could no longer continue because God had placed it in the temple alone. And in this setting there was a serious danger that they saw and it was a loss of Jewish IDENTITY AND SURROUNDED BY THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY culture and in that captivity the you the culture the language and religion. There was a growing fear that the future generations would forget the law of Moses and the ways of God. To combat this, there arose a need to teach the scripture, to preserve the law, to pass on Jewish customs to the young. And out of this necessity developed the synagogues and that synagogue means, it's a word that means bring together. And these were not temples, BUT THEY WERE GATHERING PLACES for prayer, for reading of the scripture and instruction. And I I WANT YOU TO WATCH NOW WHAT FORMS NOW after they get down into into Babylon because it really patterns the CHURCH BECAUSE THE CHURCH WOULD ALSO STAY AWAY and would also be taken down into Babylon &gt;&gt; into darkness through the dark AGES AND GOD WOULD START A PROCESS of restoration. AND SO IN THIS, YOU KNOW, THERE WOULD BE in influential religious GROUPS THAT WOULD RISE DURING THIS TIME, MOST NOTABLY the Pharisees. &gt;&gt; We've all heard of them. Pharisees were devout layman and scribes and and teachers who were deeply committed to preserving Israel's identity through the strict observance of the law. &gt;&gt; And initially, it was a sincere desire to do good. It was commendable. And the scripture EVEN USES A POWERFUL EXAMPLE OF THIS IN NEHEMIAH 8:8. And they read in the book of the law distinctly and gave the sense and cause them to understand the reading. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE THIS WAS THIS WAS THE WAY THAT IT WAS. THEY would read the law distinctly give the sense and cause them to understand what they were reading. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND AT FIRST THE WRITTEN TORAH GIVEN THROUGH MOSES WAS HONORED. &gt;&gt; But however, over time a shift occurred, &gt;&gt; prominent teachers that were later called rabbis. They rose to authority. And these men were not prophets. And they WERE NOT ANOINTED BY GOD. THEY WERE NOT LED BY THE SPIRIT. BUT they were trained through study and intellectual mastery of the law. In other words, they had been the seminary &gt;&gt; AND AS THEY TAUGHT, THEY IN they increasingly inserted their own interpretations &gt;&gt; and opinions and applications into the scriptures. And these teachings passed on DOWN FROM RESPECTED elders became known as oral tradition. So you have the written law, what the Bible says and then what the church says. &gt;&gt; Amen. And eventually these TRADITIONS WERE ELEVATED TO THE SAME AUTHORITY AS THE WRITTEN word of God. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; UNTIL EVEN TODAY in Christianity is not what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; It says but my church says &gt;&gt; are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THIS BECAME THE TRADITION OF THE ELDERS and they they've elevated IT TO THE SAME AUTHORITY AS THE written word of God. &gt;&gt; NOW IN PRACTICE THE WORDS OF MAN began to carry equal sometimes greater weight than the words of God himself. And Jesus he when he came he rebuked this plainly in Matthew 15:6. Thus thou hath made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT BEGAN AS AN EFFORT TO PROTECT GOD'S WORD SLOWLY BECAME A SYSTEM where man's interpretation carried divine authority AND PROPHETIC REVELATION WAS REPLACED WITH INTELLECTUAL CONTROL AND THE SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP WAS EXCHANGED FOR SCHOLASTIC authority and scripture was preserved but its power was neutralized. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this was the DANGER THAT JESUS CONFRONTED. THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE SCRIPTURE. IT WAS NOR TEACHING NOR ORDER. IT WAS ORDER WITHOUT REVELATION. &gt;&gt; LEARNING WITHOUT LIFE. AND IN THAT CONDITION, RELIGION NO LONGER OPENED THE WAY TO GOD. IT BECAME A BARRIER THAT ONLY CHRIST HIMSELF COULD BREAK THROUGH. &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus, the living word, stepped into that system. AND HE DIDN'T COME TO ABOLISH THE LAW, BUT to restore it to its original purpose. &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND, CHURCH, WE CANNOT HAVE A NEW BIBLE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE CAN'T OH, NO. YOU YOU SAY, "WELL, WE GOT WE GOT THE MESSAGE AND WE GOT THE BIBLE." NO, WE GOT THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE THE WORD OF GOD. HE DIDN'T DIDN'T COME TO ABOLISH THE BIBLE &gt;&gt; OR TO SET IT ASIDE, &gt;&gt; BUT TO RESTORE IT TO ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE TO LEAD A PEOPLE BACK TO LIVING FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, when Nehemiah rebuilt the temple, the Sadducees rose to power because first when they come back, there's no temple. So they rebuilt a temple and then and there they set up an order of priest where these were Sadducees and they were mostly hereditary priests and wealthy elites and many of them would hold political power and after the exile that the high priest became both a religious and political leader because they had no king. So these these Sadducees and the high priests would become the political authority of the nation co you know cooperating with foreign rulers especially Rome to maintain authority and AND THE SADDUCEES CONTROLLED THE TEMPLE ECONOMY. They deni and AND AND THEY DENIED THE RESURRECTION. THEY DENIED the existence OF ANGELS. THEY DENIED THE SPIRITS. THEY DENIED, LISTEN, THEY DENIED THE SUPERNATURAL totally and they reduced faith to administration and control. &gt;&gt; And together with the Essenes, the the separate group, THESE SECTS FORMED A RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE of Israel. And this is the chaos that Jesus stepped into. HE STEPS IN THE CHAOS &gt;&gt; THAT MAN IS CALLING &gt;&gt; ORDER. &gt;&gt; AND GOD STEPS INTO THE CHAOS OF RELIGION AND MAN'S ORDER. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO BRING A PEOPLE OUT OF THE CHAOS &gt;&gt; into his order. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to see this because these scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, temple worship, these great synagogues, respected rabbis, holy men, Levites. To the people, this looked like order. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It looked like structured worship, learned teachers, respected institutions. Amen. &gt;&gt; The school of Galia, the school of this one, the school of that one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Each got their diploma, THEIR DEGREES FROM THIS AND THAT, BUT TO God it was chaos. &gt;&gt; MAN WAS CALLING IT ORDER AND GOD RECOGNIZED IT AS CHAOS. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SPOKE PLAINLY THIS CONDITION. AND I WANT YOU TO SEE IT IN MATTHEW 23:13. HE SAID, "WOE TO YOU SCRIBES and Pharisees, hypocrites." &gt;&gt; Which literally means actors, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; FOR YOU SHUT UP THE KINGDOM OF heaven against men. &gt;&gt; And you NEITHER GO IN YOURSELVES, NEITHER SUFFER YOU, OR ALLOW YE them that are entering to go in. You actually are keeping men out of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; You're claiming to be the way, THE TRUTH, THE LIFE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE CLAIMING TO BE THE GATE TO HEAVEN, AND YOU'RE STANDING AT THE DOOR &gt;&gt; keeping people out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, friends, that's God's indictment of religious systems today &gt;&gt; of what men calls order. Amen. &gt;&gt; Scribes provided the legal interpretation enforcement. And I want to just look you see how did these go wrong? How did they bring chaos? The problem wasn't the the their knowledge of the scripture. It was how they used it. &gt;&gt; Jesus never accused them of ignorance. He accused them of misuse. &gt;&gt; They replaced revelation with interpretation. I I WANT YOU to get something, church. WE CANNOT RELY ON HUMAN INTELLECT. &gt;&gt; We must each ONE OF US HAVE A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; AND BE LED BY REVELATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THEY REPLACE REVELATION with interpretation. They analyze the scripture, but they no longer heard God's voice. And Jesus said to them, "You search the scripture and and you will not come to me that you might have life. &gt;&gt; You're you're you're going all through the scripture. YOU'RE READING YOUR BIBLE DAILY. YOU'RE YOU YOU KNOW IT WELL. YOU YOU'RE SCHOLARS. YOU'RE ALL OF THIS. BUT YOU WILL NOT COME TO ME." &gt;&gt; That you might have life. &gt;&gt; You see, RELIGION HAD COME LIKE THIS. IT HAD PRODUCED CHURCHES THAT KNEW THE TEXT. BUT MISSED THE PERSON IT TESTIFIED OF. &gt;&gt; AND RELIGION HAD BECOME A BARRIER INSTEAD OF A DOORWAY. &gt;&gt; AND RELIGION WAS WHICH WAS MEANT TO LEAD PEOPLE TO GOD HAD BEEN BECOME THE VERY thing that was keeping people away. So he said, and I repeat it again in Matthew 23:13, "But woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men, and you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are that are entering to go in." &gt;&gt; You see, the scribes and and the Pharisees didn't say, "The kingdom of God ain't real." They just control who could get in it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; And instead of LEADING PEOPLE TO GOD, THEY PUT UP RULES AND REQUIREMENTS. THEY DIDN'T SAY TO COME TO GOD JUST AS YOU ARE. ASK for ask forgiveness and let God change you. They they were saying, fix yourself. &gt;&gt; Fix yourself first and then God will accept you. &gt;&gt; And Jesus TOLD HIM, YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY THE KEY of knowledge. AND THAT KEY WAS AN EDUCATION. IT WAS revelation and experience of knowing who God really is. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY WE PREACH EXPERIENCE at this church. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT JUST EDUCATION. &gt;&gt; I can show you IN THE BIBLE. I SAY, "WELL, THIS IS RIGHT. THIS IS WRONG." WHAT? BUT RE REALLY FRIEND, NOTHING WILL REPLACE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH GOD &gt;&gt; WHERE GOD HAS MADE KNOWN PERSONALLY TO YOU as an individual. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO BY LIFTING THEIR TRADITIONS UP TO THE SAME LEVEL AS GOD'S WORD, THEY MADE GOD SEEM far away and hard to reach. And instead of a kingdom being a life that people could step into, that became a complicated system that people had to figure out. &gt;&gt; Go through this catechism and this one and say this rosary for this and pray to this one there and this and that. And neither do you go in yourselves. And Jesus said something even more serious. He said, "You're not just blocking others. You ain't never even went in yourself. You're not even saved." &gt;&gt; And these were men who study. &gt;&gt; Can I bring it down? &gt;&gt; THESE ARE MEN WHO STUDY THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; BUT REJECT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW THE QUOTES, BUT THEY'VE NEVER HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH GOD THEMSELVES. AND THEY REFUSE PENTECOST BECAUSE IT'S AT PENTECOST THAT GOD REALLY ENTERS THE HEART. &gt;&gt; Herod the Great would later later rebuild it and expand the temple into a magnificent structure. It was one of the wonders of the ancient world. And but I want to tell you something about it. There was no record of the glory of God filling it. And yet THEY HAD THE SHELL OF RELIGION &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND PAUL WOULD SAY IT LIKE THIS, HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS &gt;&gt; BUT DENYING THE POWER THEREOF. &gt;&gt; AND AT THIS POINT, THE WORD DELIVERED BY MOSES WAS NO LONGER FOLLOW FLOWING THROUGH PROPHETIC INSPIRATION BUT THROUGH INTELLECTUAL INTERPRETATION. And Jesus said in John 5:39, "You search the scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and they are they that testify of me." And men believe they were bringing order. But when man made systems replace divine revelation, confusion and chaos follows. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now after the return of of of from Babylon under Zerubabel, Ezra, Nehemiah, SECOND TEMPLES REBUILT, HEROD EXPANDED IT, BEAUTIFIED IT. Yet there WAS SOMETHING AS I'VE SAID ALREADY NOTICEABLY absent and I want to dwell on this a minute. THERE IS NO BIBLICAL EX record of the Shana glory returning to fill the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; That's right. NO, THE STRUCTURE STOOD THE THE RITUALS RESUMED. THE SACRIFICE WAS LAW OFFERED. BUT THE MANIFEST PRESENCE OF GOD DID NOT DESCEND. &gt;&gt; YEAH. If something unmistakably was absent. No kind of glory. Never to feel the holiest of holies. In fact, WHEN JESUS AT HIS DEATH, IT WAS WRITTEN TO BY THE HAND OF GOD, IT SHOWED THERE WAS NO GOD THERE. &gt;&gt; EMPTY, VOID. &gt;&gt; The whole SYSTEM HAVE WENT INTO CHAOS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In Moses tabernacle, the Bible said the cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Amen. &gt;&gt; IN SOLOMON'S TEMPLE, THE CLOUD FILLED THE HOUSE of the Lord. For the glory of the Lord had filled the house. But after the exile, THERE WAS NO CLOUD. THERE WAS NO FIRE. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MANIFESTATION OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD. THE HOUSE STOOD. THE RITUALS CONTINUED. THE SACRIFICES YOU WERE DONE DAILY. BUT THE GLORY DID NOT DESCEND. &gt;&gt; And yet God has spoke a prophecy of this house. that seemed impossible. Let's look at this prophecy. Hagi 2 and9. The glory of this latter house SHALL BE GREATER than Solomon's temple, the former. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAYAETH THE LORD OF HOSTS. &gt;&gt; This wasn't man saying it. God was saying it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND IN THIS PLACE WILL I GIVE PEACE, SAITH the Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at this. God said, "This house is going to be greater than Solomon's." &gt;&gt; How could this be? Well, when Ezra and Nehemiah made it, it was small and &gt;&gt; pald in comparison. It was nothing in comparison to Solomon's. It It lacked the gold. It lacked the splendor. IT LACKED THE ARK. &gt;&gt; It lacked the visible glory. AND BY EVERY NATURAL MEASURE IT WAS INFERIOR. &gt;&gt; So it looks impossible. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know God was not speaking of architectural glory. &gt;&gt; THE GLORY OF THIS LATTER HOUSE WOULD NOT BE FOUND IN STONE OR GOLD OR RITUAL. AND IT WOULD NOT COME AS A CLOUD OF GLORY FILLING THE ROOM. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; INSTEAD, IT WOULD BE THE FULLNESS OF GOD HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; WOULD COME TO SIN AND GATHER INTO A HUMAN BODY. &gt;&gt; COLOSSIANS 2:9 SAID, "FOR IN HIM DWELLETH ALL THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY." &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, the glory walked in. &gt;&gt; I want to say it again. THE GLORY WALKED IN &gt;&gt; STEPPING INTO THE CHAOS. OF MAN'S RELIGION, &gt;&gt; OF A CHURCH EMPTY OF GOD, &gt;&gt; full of rituals. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS ENTERED THAT TEMPLE AND HE SPOKE THERE AND HE TAUGHT THERE AND HE HEALED THERE AND YES, HE BROUGHT ORDER THERE AND HE PLANTED A WHIP AND HE DROVE OUT THE MONEY CHAMBER AND HE HAD CHANGED. HE SAID, "MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER." &gt;&gt; What was it? It was God bringing order, &gt;&gt; STEPPING INTO THE CHAOS, &gt;&gt; of what man called order of religious systems, of renowned churches. And he's stepping right in the midst &gt;&gt; and he's bringing order. And Malachi 3:1 said, "The Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple." And he did. Hallelujah. I say he did. &gt;&gt; And in that place, he said, "I will give peace." &gt;&gt; PEACE WAS NO LONGER SOME ABSTRACT PROMISE. PEACE NOW STOOD IN FLESH AND BONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH. ISAIAH 9:6. UNTO US A CHILD IS BORN. UNTO US A SON IS GIVEN. AND THE GOVERNMENT SHALL BE UPON HIS SHOULDER. AND HIS NAME SHALL BE CALLED WONDERFUL AND COUNSELOR. AND THE MIGHTY GOD, THE EVERLASTING FATHER, THE prince of peace. &gt;&gt; Peace stepped in to the religious systems of the day. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you though, tragedy followed revelation. The pe the prince and his peace that would bring order to their chaos was rejected. &gt;&gt; I want you to KNOW THIS WAS THE CLOSING OF THE GENT JEWISH DISPENSATION THAT IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LEO THE LAST CHURCH AGE SHOWS HIM ON THE outside &gt;&gt; not inside. And a church that is so smug and sure of themsself that says I'm rich. I'm increased with goods. God, I don't need you &gt;&gt; yet to have the ritual, the structure, the wealth, but not God. You see, he was the cornerstone the builders rejected. &gt;&gt; Somebody with me? Psalms 118:22, the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. &gt;&gt; He came to his own covenant people. And and JOHN SUMMARIZES A TRAGEDY of Israel in one heartbreaking sentence where HE SAYS IN JOHN 11, HE CAME TO HIS OWN &gt;&gt; AND HIS OWN RECEIVED HIM NOT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It repeats again in the last church age. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW JESUS DIDN'T COME TO STRANGERS. HE CAME TO HIS OWN COVENANT PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THE NATION THAT HAD THE PROMISES, THE NATION THAT HAD THE PROPHETS, THE NATIONS THAT HAD THE SCRIPTURES, THE TEMPLE, THE HISTORY OF GOD'S DEALING. AND WHEN HE ARRIVED, Israel had a religious system that was so firmly in place with scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, men highly esteemed as teachers of the law, just like today, except they're called Catholic and Methodists, and Baptists, and so on and on. But instead of leading the people to a living truth, they exalted tradition and interpretation above the written word of God. And Jesus exposed this plainly. He said in Matthew 15 and6, "Thus you have made the commandments of God of none effect by your tradition." &gt;&gt; What did he do verse 9 say of teaching for doctrines of commandments of men. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE TRAGEDY WASN'T THEY THAT THEY LACKED SCRIPTURE. They had plenty of it. And yeah, TODAY EVEN TODAY BIBLES ARE EVERYWHERE. YES. &gt;&gt; AND THE TRAGEDY WAS THEY HAD REPLACED REVELATION with regulation AND THE WORD WAS NOW BURIED UNDER THE TRADITION OF THE ELDERS. &gt;&gt; They sat in Moses' seat and yet refused to recognize the one that Moses wrote about. And Jesus said IN JOHN 5:46, "HAD YOU BELIEVED MOSES, you would have believed me, &gt;&gt; for he wrote of me." So at the close of Israel's dispensation, many stood smug and satisfied with man-made religion, CONTENT WITH THE SHELL OF ORDER while missing the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Listen what I'm talking about. I want you to hear this plainly. They chose systems over the savior. And Peter later later would say it plainly HE WOULD SAY YOU DENIED THE HOLY ONE AND JUST AND YOU KILLED THE PRINCE OF LIFE. AND HERE'S a sovereign TRUTH THAT WE AS WE ALREADY QUOTED THE STONE THAT THE BUILDERS REJECTED THE SAME BECOME THE HEAD OF THE corner and they REJECTED THE LIVING WORD NOT BECAUSE HE HAD NO LIGHT BUT BECAUSE HIS LIGHT EXPOSED THEIR DARKNESS. And in choosing formal formal religion they perceived as order over Christ himself. They fulfilled the scripture where it says he came to his own and his own received him not. And the Bible said the same pattern will repeat. Just as Israel rejected him at the end of the Jewish age, Leodysia will do the same at the close of the Gentile age. They'll be rich in structure &gt;&gt; but poor in presence lacking the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And that lesson is very sobering and one we want to consider today. A church cannot stand cannot truly stand on God's word without the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Worship can continue without revelation. Religion can FUNCTION WHILE REJECTING CHRIST HIMSELF. OH, RELIGION RIGHT WENT RIGHT ON. EVEN WHEN THEY CRUCIFIED HIM, THEY WENT RIGHT NEXT DAY WITH THEIR SAME RITUALS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. The greatest danger is not the absence of religion, but the rejection of the very glory that God sends. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And history shows us that Satan does not destroy the work of God by removing the structure. He corrupts it by replacing the presence. He will do anything he can to replace THE PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; WORSHIP ALL YOU want to &gt;&gt; as long as you're empty of the presence. &gt;&gt; Raise your hands and shout. As long as you're empty of the presence. &gt;&gt; Satan don't care how religious you are. &gt;&gt; He don't care how right you are in your doctrine. IF YOU MISS THAT LIFE, YOU MISSED EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; Somebody with me? And that's the danger. THE DANGER IS NOT THAT THE MESSAGE MOVEMENT WILL WILL LACK BUILDINGS OR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE or publishing HOUSES OR TEACHING. OH, THERE'LL BE PLENTY of them. There will BE VOICES AND INTERPRETATIONS and leaders and each will BE CONVINCED THAT THEIR VERSION is the represents the the proper ORDER JUST AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS of the Pharisees AND THE SADDUCEES. THE MESSAGE WILL BE FRAGMENTED into camps. &gt;&gt; Each group believing IT HAS THE CORRECT UNDERSTANDING, THE RIGHT STRUCTURE, THE TRUE FORM. YET FORM WITHOUT LIFE has never preserved truth. &gt;&gt; Matthew 23 27, you are like whited supplers. This is why brother Brandham calls them morgs, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are full within full of dead men's bones. What do you say of them? They let down the bars. The goats came in, took over. &gt;&gt; The choice, the cry of joy was gone. The freedom of spirit was gone. They kept on with form. But the fire had died down. The blackness of ashes is all about that's left. But let me just tell you, it will not be the quotes, Bible verses that are rejected. &gt;&gt; It will NOT BE THE STRUCTURE OF religion that will be rejected. It will be the glory &gt;&gt; that will be rejected. THE HOLY GHOST HIMSELF, THE TOKEN WILL BE PUSHED OUTSIDE THE CHURCH. Once again, I repeat, the greatest danger is not the absence of religion because Leodysia is very religious, but the great danger is a rejection of the very glory that God sends. And that's the danger that is facing this movement like it has every other movement is rejecting the glory, the token, the life, the power. &gt;&gt; Revelation 3 20 says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." &gt;&gt; And I want you to think about this for a moment. Christ is knocking, but that knocking don't mean revival. &gt;&gt; IT MEANS EXCLUSION. THAT CHRIST, THE ANOINTING, THE HOLY GHOST IS EXCLUDED FROM THE WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; THE FIRE IS GONE. ASHES IS ALL THAT'S LEFT. A REMINDER OF A PAST MOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh God, don't let our God become history to us. &gt;&gt; Don't let miracles become historical. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS, WHAT DID HAPPEN, WHAT ONCE DID. COME ON, SOMEBODY. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A PRESENT DAY GOD WHERE THE GLORY IS REVEALED AND THE POWER OF GOD IS DESCENDS INTO THE CHURCH AND not just the church but into hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, the church will still function. People are still gathered. Rituals continue. Methods will remain and easy belieism will replace transformation and order will be defined by comfort rather than by conviction. I'm trying to hurry and I want to get but I want to get some things this morning because we have a grand conclusion that I want to make but Peter Timothy said they have a form of godliness denying the power thereof. You see what once came as a holy fire be will be listen to me carefully. I want to say this very plainly. Will you hear me? Wake up your neighbor. Say, "Listen now just a minute. What once came as holy fire will be redefined as disorder. What once came as holy fire will be redefined as disorder. The baptism of the Holy Ghost once welcomed as God's purifying presence will be mocked, restrained &gt;&gt; and dismissed as excess and disorderly &gt;&gt; and its gifts sheld, sheld and forgotten. THEY WILL THINK THE HOLY GHOST BAPTISM THAT DESCENDED LIKE FIRE THAT CONSUMES SIN NATURE AND FEELS BELIEVERS UNTIL THEY SHOUTED THE GLORY OF GOD IN OTHER TONGUES to be disorder and chaos and will mock it and deride it and reject the Holy Ghost. And I'm not even talking about denominational movements anymore &gt;&gt; because the last place he'll be rejected is among those who are saying message message. &gt;&gt; And soon what was once an eagle's nest with eiglets becomes a nest for chickens and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. unconverted people sitting in the pews because the new birth was rejected. But let me tell you something, friends. I I I just want you to understand THAT IN ALL OF THIS, GOD IS NOT GOING TO LEAVE A PEOPLE &gt;&gt; in chaos. BECAUSE EVEN THEN IN ACTS CHAPTER 2, THERE APPEARED UNTO THEM CLOVEN TONGUES LIKE AS A FIRE AND THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; SO THE ORIGINAL CHURCH WAS NOT WITHOUT THE GLORY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH IT NOW. AMEN. EZRA'S TEMPLE. AMEN. NEHEMIAH'S TEMPLE. HEROD'S TEMPLE. IT NEVER HAD THE GLORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHEN JESUS CAME IN, THE GLORY PERSONIFIED IN HUMAN FLESH, THEY REJECTED HIM. &gt;&gt; AND SO WILL THEY REJECT HIM TODAY. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, &gt;&gt; he was not done. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was going to step into a temple of humanity where the glory would be revealed in human flesh, &gt;&gt; not in temples made with hands. That same spirit who consumes through the sin nature feel believers with divine life though will be rejected in favor of man's control. Human order will replace divine leadership and resisting the spirit they will turn the message of God into confusion. But we're at the end. &gt;&gt; There is no more messengers coming. &gt;&gt; No additional church ages, no final reform to restore the scripture order. &gt;&gt; This time God will not correct the system. &gt;&gt; HE WILL CALL THE PEOPLE OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IN A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. 1 THESSALONIANS 4 SAID THAT WE WHICH ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN SHALL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER TO BE WITH TOGETHER with them to meet the Lord in THE AIR &gt;&gt; WHERE OUT OF CHAOS &gt;&gt; IN THE GLORY. &gt;&gt; SO YEAH, WE WILL SEE THE WHOLE MOVEMENT GO DOWN IN THE DARKNESS BUT OUT OF THERE GOD WILL CALL A PEOPLE out &gt;&gt; because God will always have a witness. out of an age that rejected the presence, they'll be caught up into eternal order where the Holy Ghost reigns forever and disorder will never enter again. &gt;&gt; But let me talk about it for a moment. God's order always flows from his spirit, not from organizational control. And this was the chaos that Jesus was born in. organized religion without revelation, law without life. In other words, the word without life, STRUCTURE WITHOUT SPIRIT, AUTHORITY GIVEN BY MAN INSTEAD OF GOD. So it was authority without the presence. And into that confusion stepped the living word. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Now I want you to get this. Jesus did not come to patch the system. He didn't COME TO MAKE THE PHARISEES A BETTER group of people and a greater church or the Sadducees. &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. HE DIDN'T COME TO PATCH THE SYSTEM. HE CAME TO RESTORE DIVINE ORDER. &gt;&gt; He healed the sick. &gt;&gt; He forgave sins. HE CAST OUT DEVILS. HE SPOKE WITH AUTHORITY THAT WAS NOT DERIVED FROM MAN'S TRADITION, BUT FROM HEAVEN ITSELF. And where RELIGION HAD CONFUSED, HE CLARIFIED. WHERE SYSTEM HAD BOUND MEN, HE SET THEM FREE. AND WHEN GOD WHAT GOD OR WHAT MEN CALLED ORDER, GOD CALLED IT CHAOS. AND WHERE CHAOS RULED, THE WORD STEPPED IN TO restore life. And his life was divine order. &gt;&gt; That's why we got to have the Holy Ghost in our midst &gt;&gt; because without it is chaos. Amen. &gt;&gt; If his spirit is not the life of a movement, it's chaos. Now, by the time Jesus was born, this was the condition that Israel was in. Beautiful temple in Jerusalem, largest in the world. But confusion reigned in the hearts of men. Religion was organized, but truth was buried under tradition. THE THE PHARISEES AND THE SADDUCEES REPRESENTED WORKS WITHOUT LIFE, DOCTRINE WITHOUT REVELATION, RELIGION WITHOUT POWER. And that's the kind of religion that God hates is religion without power. And Jesus said unto himself in Matthew 15:8, "This people draweth nigh to me with their mouth, but their hearts are far from me." But at that time, God stepped directly into their chaos. To human reasoning, it just looked like chaos. His method LOOKED SCANDALOUS. IT LOOKED DISORDERLY. EVEN AN UNMARRIED VIRGIN ESPOUSED TO A MAN, &gt;&gt; OVERSHADOWED BY THE HOLY GHOST, BRINGING FORTH A CHILD. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO FORM A RELIGION. THIS WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE. &gt;&gt; This was but this was not confusion. This was God restoring order. IN GALATIANS 4:4, WHEN the when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son. YOU SEE, HEAVEN WAS NOT IMPROVISING HAPHAZARDLY. It was executing an eternal plan. AND GOD WAS INTRODUCING NOW A NEW PRIESTHOOD, &gt;&gt; A NEW SACRIFICE, A NEW ATONEMENT, &gt;&gt; THE REALITY OF WHICH THE OLD SYSTEM HAD ONLY BEEN A SHADOW. BECAUSE HEBREWS 10:1 SAID, "FOR THE LAW HAVING BEEN A SHADOW OF good of good things to come, CAN NEVER MAKE THE COMERS THERE unto perfect." But he didn't come to reform. He came to fulfill. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And John would introduce this Messiah as a lamb and he'd say, "Behold, or look, THE LAMB OF GOD." WELL, WE GOT MANY WOOLLY LAMBS. &gt;&gt; But here COMES THE TRUE LAMB WHICH TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS ENTERED INTO HIS MINISTRY AND HIS WORK WAS UNMISTAKABLE. HE WAS BRINGING ORDER TO CHAOS &gt;&gt; AND HE STEPPED INTO SICKNESS AND HE BROUGHT HEALING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MATTHEW 11:5 SAID, "THE BLIND RECEIVED their sight and the lame walk." HE ENTERED INTO THE CHAOS OF BROKEN BODIES AND HE RESTORED THEM TO WHOLENESS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. &gt;&gt; EVERYWHERE JESUS WENT, DISORDER RETREATED. &gt;&gt; DEMONS WERE CAST OUT. MINDS WERE RESTORED. TRUTH REPLACED TRADITION. LIFE REPLACE RITUAL. AND ONCE AGAIN, GOD DEMONSTRATED AN unchanging principle of redemption. &gt;&gt; That where sin brings chaos, God brings order. &gt;&gt; And where religion brings confusion, Christ brings life. &gt;&gt; And where man builds system, God sends a Messiah, an anointed one of God. And Jesus did not merely preach order. He was order incarnate. &gt;&gt; He was the living word that WAS STEPPING INTO A WORLD OF confusion &gt;&gt; to restore God's original design. And that's what the Holy Ghost is is order incarnate. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is order incarnate. God coming into life to bring orders. What he does, he didn't come and rearrange the chaos. He enters into it. And when he enters, he speaks. AND WHEN HE SPEAKS, LIFE RISES AND THIRST ENDS and the SOUL IS SATISFIED. AND THE ORDER IS RESTORED. AND THAT'S WHAT JESUS DOES. HE DOESN'T MERELY REARRANGE CHAOS FROM FROM A LOFTY THRONE IN THE DISTANCE. HE STEPS INTO THE CHAOS. AND WHEN HE ENTERS, HE SPEAKS. AND WHEN HE SPEAKS, DARKNESS BREAKS AND FAITH RISES AND THIRST ENDS AND LIFE COMES BACK INTO DIVINE ORDER. &gt;&gt; And he proved this over and over again when he stepped in the world of con chaos everywhere he went. He calmed the storms. He healed bodies. He restored the minds. He saved souls. Because the power of Christ is not information. It is transformation. &gt;&gt; If we could just get IT THIS MORNING, YOU'D REALIZE THE MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED IS NOT INFORMATION. &gt;&gt; IT'S TRANSFORMATION. IT'S TO BRING ABOUT EXCHANGE TO BRING YOU INTO ORDER &gt;&gt; OUT OF CHAOS. FOR THE BIBLE SAID IN 2 CORINTHIANS 5:17, "IF ANY MAN BE IN CHRIST, he is a new creature." When Jesus enter, things don't remain the same. &gt;&gt; Nowhere is this more seen any more clearly than at Calvary. Jesus was crucified. He was buried. He was resurrected. He ascended in glory. and a and to the natural eye, this looked like more chaos, a rejected Messiah, A BLOODED CROSS, A SEALED TOMB. But in reality, IT WAS GOD RESTORING ORDER &gt;&gt; AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL OF all sin and separation. And without the shedding of blood, chaos would have continued forever in man. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. For without the shedding of blood, there's no remission of sins. &gt;&gt; And let me get it. Though it looked like chaos, his death was not defeat. &gt;&gt; It was payment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 55 or 53 and 5 said he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed delivered. &gt;&gt; Oh, think about that. AND WITHOUT THE RESURRECTION, his crucifixion would have been in vain. Because 1 Corinthians 15:17 said, "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain. For you are yet in your sins." &gt;&gt; But he did rise. &gt;&gt; I said he did rise. &gt;&gt; And he when he rose, HE ROSE TRIUMPHANT OVER DEATH AND HELL. FOR THE BIBLE SAID IN ACTS 2:24, "IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD beholden of it." AND HIS ASCENSION WAS NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT. IT WAS A COMPLETION OF HIS MISSION. FOR HE ENTERED IN THE GLORY AS OUR HIGH PRIEST AND OUR INTERCESSOR. &gt;&gt; One who can be touched today by the feelings of your infirmity. And he was not running away from the chaos of the cross and of the tomb, but instead he was overcoming death, hell, and the grave. &gt;&gt; And he ascended. And when he ascended, he cleared a path, making a highway for his sons to come to glory with him. Therefore, he could say, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one can come to God except by me." &gt;&gt; And yet, he didn't leave his disciples in sorrow and confusion. For he said in John 14:18, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you." So he told him plainly though that his departure WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT WOULD OPEN THE WAY FOR THE HOLY GHOST TO COME UPON COMING INTO MEN TO BRING THEM OUT OF CHAOS. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; SO IN JOHN 16:7, NEVERTHELESS I TELL YOU the truth is expedient THAT I GO AWAY. FOR IF I GO NOT AWAY, THE COMFORTER WILL NOT COME TO YOU. BUT IF I DEPART, I WILL SEND them unto you. So after his ascension, he commands him to wait. And he says in Luke 24:49, "Tear you in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high." So 120 of them, men and women, gathered in an upper room waiting. AND THEY WERE NOT WANDERING AND AROUND and going in and OUT, BUT THEY WERE PRAYING AND SEEKING God together. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS IN ACTS 1:14, THESE ALL CONTINUED WITH ONE ACCORD in prayer and supplication. AND WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE CAME RIGHT, UNITY, HUNGER, EXPECTATION, GOD CAME DOWN. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you want to have him come down today, get him that same type of expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unity, one with God, one with the scripture, one with the promise. Amen. believe in this for you. Are you with me? HUNGER, DESIRE, WANTING HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART, EXPECTATION. THAT'S WHEN GOD CAME DOWN. &gt;&gt; And just as he CAME TO MOSES AND OUR BURNING BUSH, AND JUST AS HIS GLORY FILLED THE THE TABERNACLE IN THE TEMPLE, HE CAME AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME NOT IN STONES MADE OR BUILDINGS MADE OF STONE, BUT HE CAME IN TO LIVING temples of flesh. And the Bible said in Acts two, "And suddenly there came a sound from heaven." This was God stepping into chaos, as of rushing mighty wind, as God breeze, and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire. Let there be light, and it sat upon them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. And now the spirit of God is moving. It is breathing. It is now coming to dwell in human beings. And to the outside world, it looked like chaos. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; IT DIDN'T RESEMBLE THE RELIGIOUS ORDER. IT DIDN'T RESEMBLE THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE DAY. IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE FORMAL TEMPLE WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; THEY MOCKED IT. IN FACT, THEY SAID, "THESE MEN ARE FULL OF NEW WINE." &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS NOT DRUNKEN CONFUSION. IT WAS DIVINE ORDER. IT WAS HEAVEN PLACING MEN AND WOMEN IN THEIR APPOINTED POSITIONS IN THE BODY OF CHRIST, ADOPTING AND PLACING THEM AS SONS. &gt;&gt; And later Paul would describe it like this. For he said in 1 Corinthians 12:13, by one spirit you're all baptized into one body. So this was not disorder. This was God forming a church. And it brought order to men like Peter. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You're listening good. &gt;&gt; But it brought order to men like Peter. Just weeks earlier, he had denied the Lord with cursing and fear. But after Pentecost, THAT SAME MAN STOOD UP WITH A HOLY BOLDNESS. And the chaos of fear had, you know, had turned now into THE ORDER OF FAITH. AND JESUS HAD PROMISED, "YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER AFTER THE HOLY GHOST HAS COME UPON YOU." AND PETER BECAME THE LIVING PROOF. &gt;&gt; AND HIS SERMONS WASN'T POLISHED OR SCARLET. IT WAS ANOINTED. IT WAS FULL OF LIFE. IT WAS FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND WHEN THE SPIRIT OF MOVE, GOD SPOKE THROUGH AN IGNORANT FISHERMAN. AND THE WORD CUT hearts like a sword. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible said in Acts 2 and verse 37, when they heard this, they were pricricked in their hearts. And that day, in that day, 3,000 souls were brought out of darkness into order. &gt;&gt; And Acts 2:41, they that gladly received his word were baptized, about 3,000 souls. And immediately, I want you to get this. When the Holy Ghost came in, immediately order began to spread. At the gate OF THE TEMPLE SET A MAN CRIPPLED FROM BIRTH, BEGGING, HIS LIFE BROKEN, HIS FUTURE LIMITED, HIS EXISTENCE REDUCED TO SURVIVAL. AND PETER AND JOHN, FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, STEPPED INTO HIS CHAOS WITH AUTHORITY. HALLELUJAH. Peter rose up and said, "In the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, RISE UP AND WALK." &gt;&gt; And the man did NOT CRAWL. HE LEAPED. He stood. HE LEAP LEAPING UP. STOOD AND WALKED. WALKING AND LEAPING AND PRAISING GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, THAT IS THE PATTERN. WHEN THE SPIRIT SPEAKS THROUGH THE WORD, CHAOS BREAKS AND ORDER IS RESTORED. &gt;&gt; That's the gospel in motion. It's not religious polishing disorder. is Christ entering into it, SPEAKING LIFE AND TURNING confusion into a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God looked on it with pleasure &gt;&gt; and said, "It's good. It's very good." &gt;&gt; I have brought order to human lives. I have taken men and women out of disorder and I brought them into divine order. And it was God saw what he had made and it was very good. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But not so with his archeneemy. That old serpent, the adversary from the beginning. He's watching this all unfold, too. He's the one who said in his heart, "I'll exalt my throne. I'll be like the most high." &gt;&gt; That one who's always sought worship that belongs to God. &gt;&gt; That one who begiled Eve through his subility &gt;&gt; and infiltrated the family by deception and sewing the seed of the serpent among mankind. And from Eden to Calvary, his strategy was the same. corrupt what God has created, COUNTERFEIT WHAT GOD HAS REVEALED, OPPOSE WHAT GOD QUICKENS, and at first he's watching with satisfaction as though everything had finally fallen into place. But he's strutting around, he's looking, he says, "You know what?" as he watches Christ crucified, rejected by his own church. And you know, by rejecting him, they was accepting Satan. &gt;&gt; And he's watching with satisfaction like everything's finally falling into place. Said, "You know what? I turned Eden into a graveyard. What God called order, I turned it into my order, &gt;&gt; chaos. AND HE HAD WATCHED VIOLENCE multiply until the earth was filled with violence, and God washed it with the flood. And after the flood, he raised Babel up the tower of Babel with in a proud rebellion where man tried to make a name for himself. Then he twisted Israel into a nation of ritual without revelation. &gt;&gt; Scripture without spirit, a form without fire until Jesus said, "Thus you have made the commandments of God of none effect by your tradition." All the priests wore the garments. &gt;&gt; They look dignified. They held their pedigree, hereditary dissent, but the glory was absent. They had religion, but they didn't have life. And when the Messiah came, Satan believed. He had done it again. He had WORKED THROUGH THE CROWD. HE HAD STIRRED THEM UP. HE HAD WORKED THROUGH THE JEALOUS LEADERS. HE FULFILLED WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAID IN PSALMS 2 AND TWO. the kingdoms, the kings of the earth set themselves against the Lord, against his anointed. He moved through Rome and through religious hatred, he drove nails in the hands OF THE WORD MADE flesh &gt;&gt; and they crucified the Lord of glory. And when Jesus breathed his last breath, hell thought it had won. And the mockers cried, "HE SAVED HIMSELF, but he can't himself he can't save. For if he had saved himself, he could not have saved others. For the Son of Man did not come to preserve his own life, but to give it, to give his life as a ransom for many." And so he watches with a smirk. Aha! He's laughing. He sees the DISCIPLES SCATTER JUST AS THE SCRIPTURES FORETOLD. I'LL SMITE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP OF THE FLOCK WILL BE SCATTERED. HE WATCHED PETER, THE ONE WHO SAID, "THOUGH ALL MEN BE OFFENDED BECAUSE OF THEE, yet I will never be offended." And he watched him collapse under pressure and deny the Lord with cursing. The bravest voice now became silent and the boldest promise turned to fear. And Satan watched the followers of Christ slink back into the shadows and think it's over. And the whole bunch of them are just disheartened. We thought this was a Messiah. We thought this would be the one who would deliver. &gt;&gt; And then he watched them as they slunk in the shadows there at the cross. And he listened as Jesus cried from the CROSS AND SAID, "MY GOD, MY GOD." WHY HAST thou forsaken me? AND TO SATAN IT SOUNDED LIKE ABANDONMENT. &gt;&gt; IT SOUNDED LIKE DEFEAT. &gt;&gt; IT SOUNDED LIKE SEPARATION. &gt;&gt; But it WAS SOMETHING FAR MORE HOLY AND FAR more terrible to hell. It was the lambarians bearing the sins of the world. And the scripture said he made him to be sin for us who knew no sin. And he was not forsaken because he failed. He was forsaken because he stood in our place. &gt;&gt; And like the SCAPEGOAT BEARING THE SINS OF THE PEOPLE AND BEING SENT AWAY IN THE WILDERNESS, CHRIST CARRIED THE BURDEN THAT BELONGED TO US AND HE WAS THE FULFILLMENT OF EVERY SHADOW. HE WAS A TRUE SIN BEARER. BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD TO TAKE AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD. AND IN THAT MOMENT CRIED OUT, he sound like the scapegoat in the wilderness, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And Satan watched, thinking the light had been put out. But what he did not understand was this. That cry was not the end of God's order. &gt;&gt; It was the moment God's order was being purchased. &gt;&gt; And because the chaos of sin was not GOING TO BE HEALED BY RELIGION, it was GOING TO BE HEALED BY REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; SO YES, SATAN WATCHED THINKING THE LIGHT HAD BEEN PUT out and he heard the cry of anguish. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And he assumed that even heaven had turned his back and God's plan that collapsed into chaos. But what he didn't understand &gt;&gt; was that this was not the end of God's order. &gt;&gt; It was the moment God's order was being purchased. And Jesus then lifted his head one final time and spoke words that shook hell to his foundation and HE SCREAMED OUT, "IT IS FINISHED." &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Not I am finished. &gt;&gt; NOT IT'S OVER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT IT IS FINISHED. &gt;&gt; THE DEBT IS PAID. &gt;&gt; THE SACRIFICE IS COMPLETE. THE PRICE FULLY settled &gt;&gt; and in that moment the chaos of sin was NOT BEING MANAGED BY ANOTHER RELIGIOUS SYSTEM. It was being defeated. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RELIGION CAN MANAGE SIN. BUT CHRIST DEFEATS SIN. &gt;&gt; AND THE WORK OF REDEMPTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED EVEN AS THE SCRIPTURE HAS BEEN FORETOLD. HE SHALL SEE THE TRAVAIL OF HIS SOUL and shall be satisfied. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the handwriting of ordinance that was against that stood against us was blotted out. And the ransom was paid. And the lamb had borne the sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the enemy that had once ruled through accusation and guilt was now disarmed. AND BECAUSE THE CHAOS OF SIN WAS NEVER GOING TO BE healed by religion, it was going to be ended by redemption. And Satan didn't understand the wisdom of God. And what looked like chaos to men was God's perfect plan. &gt;&gt; And as the blood ran down the cross, that was not defeat. It was payment. Without the shedding of blood, there's no remission. And the grave wasn't the end. It was the doorway. &gt;&gt; For he kicked down. Listen, the Bible said he descended into the depths. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. He just say that. AND WHEN HE WENT DOWN THERE, HE KICKED DOWN THE GATES OF HELL. &gt;&gt; AND WITH A MIGHTY TRUMP OF TRIUMPH, HE LED THE CAPTIVES OUT &gt;&gt; AND HE SET THEM FREE. AND HE TOOK FROM SATAN THE KEYS OF DEATH AND OF HELL AND THE GRAVE. AND HE ROSE ON THE THIRD DAY. AND WHEN HE ROSE, THE EARTH SHOOK AND THE STONE ROLL AWAY. AND SATAN FELT THE GROUND OF HIS KINGDOM tremble again. Why? Because it was not possible that he should beholden of it. And death was conquered. And the prince OF LIFE WAS ALIVE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THEN CAME THE NEXT BLOW. &gt;&gt; Satan had always been able to corrupt temples. He could pollute altars. He could influence institutions. He could work through systems and councils and traditions. But God was doing something that Satan hated most. God was building a body. &gt;&gt; Not a building, &gt;&gt; a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not an organization. Living temples, NOT STONE WALLS. SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH. And when the day of PENTECOST FULLY CAME, SATAN SAW IT LIKE A STORM THAT WAS BREAKING OUT OF HEAVEN. A SOUND LIKE A RUSHING mighty wind. IT WAS FIRE DESCENDED NOT ON AN ALTAR THIS TIME, BUT ON A PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT IN THE HOLIES OF HOLIES BEHIND THE VEIL, BUT UPON FISHERMEN, UPON WOMEN, ON ORDINARY BELIEVERS. AND SUDDENLY 120 VESSELS THAT HAD ONCE BEEN SCATTERED AND FEARFUL AND CONFUSED WERE FILLED WITH HOLY GHOST ORDER. THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY Ghost &gt;&gt; and to hell. It looked like chaos. &gt;&gt; But Satan knew better. This wasn't chaos. This was God taking territory. &gt;&gt; Souls of men and souls of women that he had held captive. Amen. He was taking territory. Hallelujah. He watched men that USED TO BE BOUND BY SIN BECOME FREE. MEN THAT USED TO HIDE BEHIND RELIGION STAND UP WITH POWER. THE SAME PETER WHO ONCE CURSED AND DENIED CHRIST NOW LIFTED UP HIS VOICE LIKE A TRUMPET AND AND THAT TERRIFIED HELL, A MAN THAT WAS SPEAKING BY THE HOLY GHOST AND SAID, "THIS SAME JESUS THAT GOD HAS RAISED UP. THEREFORE, BY THE BEING BY THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD EXALTED, he has shed forth this." And in one sermon, as that word was released, as the spirit of God moved, as a man was anointed, this was not a priest reading the scripture. This was a man anointed by the HOLY GHOST AND POWER in the word. And when the power WENT IN THE WORD, 3,000 SOULS WERE SNATCHED FROM DARKNESS INTO LIGHT AND FROM CHAOS INTO ORDER. And the Lord added TO THE CHURCH DAILY such as should be saved. And Satan could hardly stand it because he couldn't he could handle religion, but he could not handle life. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THIS. &gt;&gt; MANY OF YOU HAD RELIGION &gt;&gt; AND HE COULD HANDLE YOU AS LONG AS YOU JUST HAD RELIGION. &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE YOU GOT LIFE, &gt;&gt; ONCE HIS LIFE CAME INTO YOU, HE CAN NO LONGER HANDLE YOU ANYMORE. HE COULDN'T CONTROL YOU ANYMORE. AMEN. WHAT RELIGION COULD NOT DO, GOD DID IN YOUR LIFE. HE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF CHAOS INTO ORDER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S THE GOD WE SERVE TODAY. &gt;&gt; He could handle a church and programs &gt;&gt; but no power. But he couldn't handle a Mark 16 church &gt;&gt; that these signs shall follow them believe because they will cast him out &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERYWHERE THIS HOLY GHOST CHURCH GOES, &gt;&gt; SHE brings chaos into order &gt;&gt; AND SATAN HAS TO LEAVE. SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH. OH, HE COULD HANDLE PHARISEES DEBATING DOCTRINE, BUT HE could not handle believers walking in the spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; And then things got worse for him. At a temple set, a man crippled another broken piece of humanity living in chaos. In the chaos of weakness, Satan had him parked there like a monument. God's power isn't real. He sits at this temple every day. &gt;&gt; He never gets healed. &gt;&gt; He never receives redemption. &gt;&gt; He's just still in his chaos. You see, he sat him there like a monument. Another broken piece of humanity living in the chaos of weakness, &gt;&gt; parking like a monument. and says, "This is how far life can fall." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But Peter and John walked up. &gt;&gt; And Satan heard those words. It makes demons tremble &gt;&gt; IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; OF NAZARETH. RISE UP AND WALK. &gt;&gt; AND THAT MAN LEAPED UP LIKE CREATION ITSELF HAD BEEN REMADE. AND HE WENT WALKING AND LEAPING AND PRAISING GOD. AND DISORDER WAS CORRECTED. AND CHAINS WERE BROKEN AND FLESH WAS RESTORED AND PRAISE WAS RISING. AND I'LL TELL YOU, IT'LL DO ITS SAME AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. TAKE BROKEN HUMANITY, LOST and chaos, stand like a statue, like a MONUMENT TO THE DEVIL'S TESTIMONY OF WHAT HE CAN DO TO LIFE. AND GOD TRANSFORM you &gt;&gt; in a moment &gt;&gt; till you break THE CHAINS OF DARKNESS OFF YOUR LIFE. and you leave the chaos &gt;&gt; restored with a praise in your lips. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what, this was Genesis all over again. &gt;&gt; Darkness, then the spirit of God moved. &gt;&gt; Chaos, then God spoke &gt;&gt; bondage, then light broke forth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Satan knew what it meant because when God brings his order upon a people, the gates of hell cannot prevail &gt;&gt; because he said in Matthew 16:18, "On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." &gt;&gt; So hell does what it always does. It's sent persecution. It sent false brethren. It sent division. It sent religious spirits. It tried to stop it, dilute it, organize it, kill it. But Satan had seen something that day that terrified him. AND HERE'S WHAT SATAN IS MOST TERRIFIED OF. WHEN GOD TAKES ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN OUT OF CHAOS AND OF SIN AND RELIGION AND PLACES THEM IN THE BODY BY THE HOLY GHOST, &gt;&gt; THAT TERRIFIES THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; TO SEE A MAN OR WOMAN FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD AMEN. WITH THE POWER OF THE LIVING CHRIST IN THEM. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN ONCE GOD SETS HIS ORDER IN MOTION, THE devil cannot reverse it. He can only fight against it. &gt;&gt; I hope you heard what I SAID. WHEN GOD SETS HIS ORDER IN MOTION, THE DEVIL CANNOT REVERSE IT. &gt;&gt; HE CAN ONLY FIGHT AGAINST IT, BUT HE CANNOT REVERSE IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD WILL NEVER TAKE HIS WORD BACK. IF HIS WORD WAS RELEASED AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED, COME ON. IT'S GOING TO WORK ON THE CHAOS UNTIL THE DARKNESS BREAK AND THE LIGHT. HALLELUJAH. And oh yeah, he'll fight it because he knows the same word that brought light in Genesis is those same word speaking today. &gt;&gt; And God spoke. I said God spoke. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God moved. &gt;&gt; When the spirit of God moves, God speaks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I remember. I remember. Let's go back just for a moment. Let's just go back in our memory just a moment to to things that's happened in our day, our time, and our church. And God spoke. Amen. And and that night in a prayer line, God got answered. A little sister, a little girl's prayer for a brother and a BOY IN THE DEPTHS OF SIN, A LIFE IN DISORDER came racing TO THE CHURCH IN HIS PAJAMAS. AND GOD BROUGHT JUSTIN WEAR OUT OF CHAOS &gt;&gt; INTO ORDER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND NOW HE'S A MAN THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SHOW ME A MAN OR A WOMAN THAT'LL SUBMIT THEMSELVES TO GOD. AND HE'LL BE A MAN OR A WOMAN THE DEVIL WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, IF GOD CAN REACH OUT THERE AND GET A PRODAL OUT OF HIS BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND BRING HIM TO CHURCH &gt;&gt; IN HIS PAJAMAS, HE CAN GET YOUR CHILD, YOUR YOUR SON, YOUR DAUGHTER, YOUR BROTHER, YOUR SISTER, YOUR MOTHER, YOUR DADDY. HE CAN FIND THEM. HE'LL GET HIS ELECT SOMEWHERE. And God spoke. I said, "And God spoke." &gt;&gt; The spirit of God moved. And God spoke. &gt;&gt; And another prodal, Denise Hamilton, came out of chaos into order. Her life was in chaos. It was totally in chaos. Satan thought he'd had the last life. He thought it was over. She thought it was over. &gt;&gt; Come on. She hadn't BEEN IN CHURCH AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN. And over IN GERMANY, THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED. I WAS IN THE BED AT NIGHT AND WOKE UP SUDDENLY AND SAT UP IN MY BED AS A VOICE FROM HEAVEN RANG OUT AND SAID, "Denise is about to receive her last call." What was that? The spirit of God had moved. What was that? A word was released. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What was that? Now I knew I was the messenger. And hearing that voice, I look looking around to see the voice and watch a black line go across the ceiling. Big thick dark line. And I said, "Oh, God." Here comes that final call. I didn't know what to do with it. Finally, when the opportunity was right, it was months later, I went and told her what God had said. She just simply said, "Well, thanks for telling me." And walked away. And some days later, in the wee hours of the morning, God came into her room &gt;&gt; and he confirmed it to her. Spoke to her personally, grabbing her Bible. It flipped RIGHT OPEN TO THE PRODICAL SON. She called ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND I SAID, "OH, DENISE, YOU'RE YOU'RE LIKE THAT PRODAL IN THE BIBLE." THE BIBLE SAID, "AND WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH." You know, YOU MAY THINK YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; LING SAID, "YOU MAY THINK THAT'S YOUR IDENTITY, BUT one day &gt;&gt; you're going to come to yourself." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what happened to you THAT DAY WHEN CHRIST CAME INTO YOUR LIFE. YOU came to yourself. All of a sudden, &gt;&gt; you recognize &gt;&gt; I have a father &gt;&gt; and in his house are provision and I've been wasting my life on eating with the swine and I've lost everything that I've had. I've wrecked my life and I am ruined and I stink and I I I'm a sinner and I'm lost without God. And that day, that night, we prayed together and her life was brought to order out of chaos. &gt;&gt; And now she's an example daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Like Jason Taggard, left Canada, came to Louisiana. He came willingly not to go to church. He wasn't going to church. He was going to he was coming here because whiskey was a lot cheaper here in Louisiana than it was in Canada. &gt;&gt; And that was his God. &gt;&gt; No intentions of serving God. But you know what? He made a mistake. He came to church one time too many &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God moved &gt;&gt; and the word was released. And when the word was released, &gt;&gt; order came into his chaos. &gt;&gt; Cigarettes left him immediately. Drunkenness left him immediately. Amen. Sins begin dropping off OF HIM. WHY? BECAUSE THAT'S THE GOD WE SERVE. &gt;&gt; HE STEPS DOWN INTO CHAOS &gt;&gt; AND BRINGS INTO ORDER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CHAOS LEFT. THE CRAVINGS FOR CIGARETTES LEFT, ALCOHOL THAT RUINED HIS LIFE AND THE DRUGS, ALL OF IT NOW LEFT. And he was life was brought to order. &gt;&gt; And that same order is spreading through his family. &gt;&gt; And let's speak it in faith this morning. It's going to reach every one of them and bring them into vine order &gt;&gt; because Satan cannot stop what God has started. like James Strong up there. Hardly a sober day in his life since a young teenager's life in shambble and total chaos. But the spirit of God moved. &gt;&gt; And when he moved, the chaos left. The drunkenness left. He didn't have to do a classes. He didn't have to do 10 or 12 steps. It was one step. Surrender your heart to God. be baptized in his name. Receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And it changes life &gt;&gt; from disorder &gt;&gt; from chaos into order. &gt;&gt; It moved over and we USED THIS OVER AGAIN, BUT IT MOVED OVER TO SISTER LANA AND THE CANCER WAS GONE AND HER LIFE WAS RESTORED TO ORDER. THE CHAOS WAS OVER. WHY? BECAUSE GOD HAD CANCELLED THE DEVIL'S PLANS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN GOD CANCELS THE DEVIL'S PLANS, &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, IT'S HIM STEPPING INTO LIFE TO BRING IT OUT OF CHAOS INTO DIVINE ORDER. &gt;&gt; No more chemo. No longer would chaos rain in her family with a husband wandering at night through the yard crying out to God because a wicked taskmaster whipping his wife with cancer. But oh no, now liberty rang. &gt;&gt; Amen. ORDER RESTORED BECAUSE GOD STRIPPED DOWN into chaos. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FREE. FREE. FREE AT LAST. &gt;&gt; OH, and what about baby Drew? A baby who couldn't stand on his own. Deformed hips. X-rays to prove it. Doctors having all kinds of thoughts about what to do. Couldn't pull himself up, couldn't walk, was not taking steps. Yet it was past time and his mother Bethany sets him at the foot of her mother's bed so she could tend her mother laying in the bed with a blind eye, an eye blinded from a brain bleed. And suddenly that same one that broke chaos in the beginning that said, "Let there be light," spoke again. And at that moment, as the spirit of God moved, light came into a blind eye. And mom could see. And the spirit wasn't through. It swept right over the bed, RIGHT DOWN UPON LITTLE BABY DREW that was that was sitting there at the end. And he rose up out of the middle of the floor unaded and ran. I MEAN IT. I SAW IT. HE RAN ALL OVER. NOT FIRST STEP, THE FIRST RUN. AMEN. HE RAN ALL OVER THE HOUSE. WHY? BECAUSE GOD BRINGS order into chaos. THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES. AND WHEN HE DOES, A WORD IS SPOKEN INTO THE CHAOS. &gt;&gt; OH, I could talk about it. WHAT WHAT ABOUT DAVID DEXTER WITH AN INCURABLE infection in his eye and he was going to lose it and the spirit of God moved &gt;&gt; and the chaos was brought to order. What about Lydia? The spirit of God moved at the sound of his voice. She ran with her baby whose kidneys were not functioning and chaos was brought to order. And he's a healthy boy today &gt;&gt; because God stepped into that chaos. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you remember, brother Aaron, THE DAY YOU WALKED DOWN TO THE ALTAR AND YOU SURRENDERED YOUR HEART TO GOD, A RELIGIOUS BOY WITHOUT GOD. BUT THAT DAY, HALLELUJAH, IT WASN'T JUST A MESSAGE BOY ON A MESSAGE PEW. IT WAS NOW THE MESSAGE WAS ON THE INSIDE. GOD STEPPED INTO THE chaos &gt;&gt; and brought order and made a preacher of the gospel out of him. And what about Jeremy Buts that sang this morning? laden with vices of video games, enslaved and snared, imprisoned, addicted. But when the spirit of God moved, ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE WAS A BURNING AS THEY PILED game after game. And now he sings the praises of God. He's married and and living an orderly life with WIFE AND TWO BABIES. WHY? BECAUSE GOD STEPPED DOWN INTO THE CHAOS. &gt;&gt; And what ABOUT YOU? AND YOU AND WHAT SHOULD I SAY MORE AS I CAN CALL OUT NAME AFTER NAME AFTER NAME. EVERY ONE OF US HAVE A TESTIMONY. JOHNNY SMITH, YOU KNOW THE PATH YOU WAS ON. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? GOD CALLED YOU OUT OF CHAOS INTO ORDER. &gt;&gt; And he's not through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said he's NOT THROUGH. HE'S STILL WORKING. HE'S STILL MOVING. HE'S STILL TRANSFORMING LIVES. AND WHAT ABOUT JOE AND STEPHANIE GREEN? ADDICTS OF THE WORST KIND. and society COULDN'T HELP THEM AND JAILS COULDN'T REFORM THEM. IT was complete chaos. &gt;&gt; But God stepped down into their chaos. &gt;&gt; And when he did and the spirit of God moved, order was brought to their life. &gt;&gt; And today the spirit of God moves. And when the word is spoken and light springs forth, it springs forth with healing in its wings. Amen. &gt;&gt; And chaos is brought to order. &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing today. &gt;&gt; He's here to step into the disorder of your life and turn it from chaos into order. &gt;&gt; Let's see. Musicians come. Hallelujah. Will you stand with me? Glory. There's an old song.

Amen. &gt;&gt; His knock on your heart is an invitation. &gt;&gt; His knock on your heart means you don't have to exclude him. &gt;&gt; You can let revival start on the inside and the reality of the living God be yours. &gt;&gt; Amen.
