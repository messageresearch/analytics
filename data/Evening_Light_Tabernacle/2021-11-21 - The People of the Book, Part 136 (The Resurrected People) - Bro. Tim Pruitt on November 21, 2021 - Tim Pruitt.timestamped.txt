[55:23] mother that was dying and laying in bed

[55:29] and in that moment faith came into her
[55:31] heart and she heard the word she reads
[55:34] from there is still alive today for the
[55:37] glory of god
[55:39] lord i i remember
[55:41] another
[55:42] hearing the word preached
[55:44] and having insulin dependent diabetes
[55:48] and there was
[55:50] lou about to lose a limb

[55:54] heart to believe as you heard the word
[55:56] priest

[56:09] miracle sign and wonder you did in the
[56:11] past
[56:12] we want to thank you for elijah the
[56:14] prophet and how you used him and
[56:17] glorified your name through him
[56:20] but lord we need a present tense god
[56:22] today
[56:23] and we're asking lord that you just come
[56:25] by our way and speak to our hearts

[56:37] lost
[56:38] and there are
[56:40] backslidden away from you cold and
[56:43] different

[56:47] but they really can then testify what

[57:46] greater amen to have the saints of god

[57:50] chapter 1
[57:52] and verse 9 i john who also am your
[57:54] brother in companion and tribulation in
[57:56] the kingdom and patience of jesus christ
[57:59] was in the aisle that is called patmos
[58:01] for the word of god and for the
[58:02] testimony of jesus christ
[58:05] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[58:08] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[58:11] a trumpet saying
[58:14] i am
[58:15] alpha and omega the first and the last
[58:18] and what thou seest write in the book
[58:20] and send it to the seven churches which
[58:22] are in asia
[58:23] and to elvises and under smyrna under
[58:26] pergamus under thytara under sardis and
[58:29] under philadelphia and under laodicea
[58:32] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[58:35] with me and
[58:36] being turned i saw seven
[58:39] golden candlesticks and in the midst of
[58:41] the seven golden candlesticks one
[58:44] likened to the son of god
[58:46] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[58:48] and gird about the paps with a golden
[58:50] girdle
[58:51] his head and his hairs were white like
[58:54] wool as white as snow and his eyes where
[58:57] he has a flame of fire
[58:59] and his feet like into fine brass as
[59:01] they burned in a furnace and his voice
[59:04] had the sound of many waters
[59:07] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[59:10] out of the and out of his mouth when a
[59:13] sharp two-edged sword and his
[59:16] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[59:19] his strength and when i saw him i fell
[59:21] at his feet as dead and he laid his
[59:23] right hand upon me sailing to me
[59:26] these wonderful words fear not
[59:29] i am the first and the last i am he that
[59:33] liveth and was dead and behold i am
[59:36] alive
[59:37] forevermore amen and i have the keys of
[59:41] hell
[59:42] and of death
[59:44] amen god bless you as you're seated
[59:46] we're going to be speaking on this
[59:48] morning on the resurrected people
[59:50] i hope to get a little more into this
[59:53] passage of scripture as i've read it for
[59:55] several services but that's okay
[59:58] we the word of god is eternal it never
[1:00:00] grows old
[1:00:02] it doesn't spoil
[1:00:03] amen it even will keep to the next
[1:00:05] service
[1:00:07] amen so god bless you it's good to be in
[1:00:09] the house of the lord this morning we
[1:00:11] won't be having a wednesday night
[1:00:13] service this
[1:00:14] wednesday and because of thanksgiving
[1:00:16] holiday coming up on thursday and
[1:00:20] many are traveling and others
[1:00:23] making preparations but you know we have
[1:00:26] so much to be thankful for and remember
[1:00:28] what it's all about as we gather
[1:00:30] together with our family and friends and
[1:00:33] and uh maybe if you know someone here
[1:00:36] that doesn't have family that can gather
[1:00:39] somebody that would be left out invite
[1:00:41] him to your home
[1:00:42] we do that every year ourselves you know
[1:00:45] we practice what we preach
[1:00:47] so anyway it's um it's always good to be
[1:00:51] together with god's people and we're
[1:00:53] looking to the lord today now as we have
[1:00:56] read this wonderful scripture this
[1:00:58] morning
[1:00:59] and i think in light of the coming
[1:01:01] resurrection of the dead
[1:01:04] that we should all anticipate and look
[1:01:07] forward to
[1:01:08] the apostle paul asked the question
[1:01:11] where oh death is just your victory or
[1:01:15] where death is your sting
[1:01:17] and that's found in first corinthians 15
[1:01:19] 55
[1:01:21] whatever our complete victory
[1:01:24] it is a refilling of the holy ghost that
[1:01:27] gives us that victory
[1:01:29] that refilling is the dynamics that
[1:01:31] raises the dead and raptures us into
[1:01:34] glory
[1:01:35] as brother branham told us in the great
[1:01:37] message what shall i do with jesus
[1:01:40] called christ the dynamics of this
[1:01:42] church will be a refilling of the holy
[1:01:45] spirit
[1:01:46] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:01:48] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:01:50] unite with the body but when that head
[1:01:52] and body unites together the full power
[1:01:56] of the holy ghost would raise her up
[1:01:58] just exactly like that even the dead
[1:02:01] that's dead in christ for hundreds of
[1:02:03] years ago will rise in the beauty of his
[1:02:06] holiness and take a flight to the skies
[1:02:09] the dynamics is the holy spirit
[1:02:12] so the church should be under
[1:02:14] expectation
[1:02:16] anticipating not just the coming of the
[1:02:19] lord but this refilling
[1:02:22] of the holy ghost that he said that
[1:02:24] would come that would be the dynamics or
[1:02:26] the firepower that would lift us off of
[1:02:30] earth into glory
[1:02:32] and it's something that we should be
[1:02:33] praying and and seeking and asking and
[1:02:36] desiring with all of our heart no matter
[1:02:39] how long you've been a christian
[1:02:41] no matter how great a portion of the
[1:02:43] holy spirit you've already experienced
[1:02:45] it ought to be a call within the heart
[1:02:48] lord i want a refilling of that same
[1:02:50] spirit
[1:02:52] because it's going to take a refilling
[1:02:54] of that to lift the church out of earth
[1:02:57] into glory
[1:02:58] amen and all of us should be able to
[1:03:00] recognize the need in our own lives for
[1:03:04] more of god i think that's one of the
[1:03:06] great uh evidences of the holy spirit in
[1:03:09] one's life is this insatiable desire for
[1:03:13] more of him
[1:03:14] something that cannot be satisfied with
[1:03:16] one meeting or just even one time at an
[1:03:19] altar or one time in prayer or a couple
[1:03:22] of times or a couple experiences along
[1:03:24] the way but something that once you get
[1:03:27] a taste of it
[1:03:28] you just want more of him you want to
[1:03:31] experience him in a greater way it's
[1:03:33] enoch's walk you're taking a progression
[1:03:35] you're going another step you want
[1:03:37] another adventure you had a taste of him
[1:03:40] but you gotta have some more of what you
[1:03:42] already got amen in the end the prophet
[1:03:45] god told us it will be a sound from
[1:03:48] heaven with such a powerful baptism of
[1:03:51] the holy spirit that will take the bride
[1:03:54] into glory as brother branham told us in
[1:03:57] three kinds of believers that's the
[1:03:59] reason i believe when the bride is
[1:04:01] called out and elected and said in the
[1:04:04] book of life there will come a sound
[1:04:07] from heaven that will take such a
[1:04:09] baptism of the holy spirit into that
[1:04:12] bride that are taken from the earth in a
[1:04:14] rapturing grace god promised it i don't
[1:04:17] care how many science or how many
[1:04:20] astronauts is signed up and everything
[1:04:22] else and how many million miles they can
[1:04:24] see i don't care nothing about that
[1:04:28] there is a heaven
[1:04:30] and there is a literal jesus christ
[1:04:33] there that will come in a body form to
[1:04:36] receive his church to himself no matter
[1:04:40] how old the story seems it's still the
[1:04:43] truth
[1:04:44] god said so that's what believers
[1:04:47] believe
[1:04:48] amen and today i believe that with all
[1:04:51] of my heart is a believer and looking at
[1:04:54] what he said a sound from heaven with
[1:04:57] that it takes such a baptism of the holy
[1:04:59] spirit into that bride that'll take her
[1:05:02] from the earth into in the rapturing
[1:05:04] grace
[1:05:06] what a promise that is you realize today
[1:05:09] that opens up a great opportunity to you
[1:05:12] for more the holy ghost than you ever
[1:05:14] had in your life
[1:05:16] amen for the experience that you have to
[1:05:18] be enlarged become greater amount
[1:05:21] whatever
[1:05:22] whatever experience you may have
[1:05:24] experienced him only in justification
[1:05:26] forgiveness of sin or sanctification the
[1:05:28] cleansing of some habits and you realize
[1:05:31] you need a real feeling of the holy
[1:05:33] ghost then that is wonderful and
[1:05:35] unnecessary and it is the token it is
[1:05:37] the requirement for the leaving here
[1:05:40] it's the ticket amen to this great
[1:05:42] rapture it's the holy ghost the token is
[1:05:46] the holy ghost and you must have it amen
[1:05:48] it's not a book it's not a tape it's an
[1:05:51] experience it's where you meet almighty
[1:05:53] god and god comes in your life and it
[1:05:56] saturates your being and it changes you
[1:05:59] it gives you a new heart it gives you a
[1:06:01] new spirit it puts god's holy spirit in
[1:06:04] you and you and god become one together
[1:06:08] hallelujah amen and in that oneness you
[1:06:10] seek i want more of that jesus i want
[1:06:13] more of that god i'm going to experience
[1:06:16] it more no we're not like laodicea that
[1:06:19] says i've had all i want but there's
[1:06:21] something down that burns on the inside
[1:06:25] i'm gonna have more of him i must have
[1:06:27] more of jesus than what i've ever
[1:06:30] experienced i cannot afford to be a
[1:06:33] mossback christian
[1:06:35] that's like an old turtle that's been
[1:06:36] out there so long in the water he just
[1:06:39] turned green with moss
[1:06:41] amen but i want to be something more
[1:06:43] than that
[1:06:44] amen i don't want to be a mosque
[1:06:46] backslidden cold and different as
[1:06:49] brother branham said this bride will not
[1:06:51] be a lukewarm she will by no means be
[1:06:54] allowed to see us she will not be a
[1:06:56] christ rejecter but she will be one who
[1:06:59] welcomes the unwelcome christ
[1:07:06] well brother tim
[1:07:08] i just don't believe this thought of
[1:07:10] jesus coming and ever i see him and
[1:07:13] every plane crashes and car wrecks and
[1:07:16] pandemonium everywhere and well let me
[1:07:19] just say that scenario is not even the
[1:07:21] rapture
[1:07:23] when jesus catches away his bride it's
[1:07:26] like romeo and juliet juliet he comes
[1:07:29] and steals her away in the night
[1:07:32] it's a secret rapture of the church
[1:07:34] and know that the world will not see the
[1:07:37] sainted dead
[1:07:39] nor will they see the lord who we meet
[1:07:41] in the air
[1:07:42] amen but the rapture is not the only
[1:07:46] coming of christ
[1:07:47] that this end time will experience
[1:07:50] because he will come back again with his
[1:07:53] saints
[1:07:54] you see brother branham taught us there
[1:07:56] are three comings he came first to
[1:07:58] redeem a bride
[1:07:59] then he'll come for his bride and then
[1:08:02] he'll come back with his bride
[1:08:04] and of course there are two of those
[1:08:06] comings that are promised in this last
[1:08:09] day amen in fact they're not very far
[1:08:12] apart with a three and a half year
[1:08:14] tribulation they're only three and a
[1:08:16] half years apart
[1:08:17] so you see when when he comes back
[1:08:21] with his saints then ever i will see him
[1:08:24] and the world will that we know will
[1:08:27] come to a complete stop
[1:08:29] yeah cars airplane missiles will all
[1:08:31] come to a screaming halt and to come
[1:08:34] crashing down as the earth burns for the
[1:08:37] millennial rain
[1:08:40] you say well that's impossible
[1:08:43] well for mo for noah's day
[1:08:45] there was water in the firmament
[1:08:48] that came pouring down even as fountains
[1:08:51] of the deep broke through the surfaces
[1:08:55] and next thing you know a whole world
[1:08:57] was destroyed with water
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:01] we're right here at the third state of
[1:09:03] stage of
[1:09:04] redemption amen where where that there
[1:09:08] is going to be a a fire it will be a
[1:09:10] preliminary fire for the for the
[1:09:12] cleansing of the earth for the
[1:09:14] millennium in preparation for the great
[1:09:17] coming of the new heavens and the earth
[1:09:19] a thousand years later
[1:09:21] but even even then the the world will
[1:09:24] catch on fire and then the the
[1:09:27] the heavens as we know
[1:09:29] already are filled with
[1:09:32] flammable gases and one day the heavens
[1:09:35] will melt
[1:09:36] with a fervent heat
[1:09:39] amen now that's why we can look away
[1:09:41] today from all that's temporary around
[1:09:44] us
[1:09:46] so that we can get a glimpse and we can
[1:09:48] see into the eternals
[1:09:51] now those that whose hope
[1:09:53] is in remaining here
[1:09:55] are desperately trying to fix it
[1:10:00] they're trying through politics
[1:10:03] they're trying through making
[1:10:04] preparations of you know for food
[1:10:07] storage or money or or some type of gold
[1:10:11] or something you know or guns
[1:10:15] and you know they're they're making all
[1:10:17] kinds of preparation because
[1:10:20] they're trying
[1:10:22] to stay here
[1:10:24] that is not the goal of the believer
[1:10:28] amen we are trying to leave here
[1:10:33] and that's what our heart is is not on
[1:10:35] staying our heart is on leaving
[1:10:39] even every preparation we make in this
[1:10:42] life's journey is on leaving here
[1:10:47] people live for the moment they live for
[1:10:50] the time they live for the day
[1:10:52] but we are people who are living for
[1:10:54] eternity
[1:10:56] because our life is much larger
[1:11:00] than what it is than this temporal life
[1:11:02] here
[1:11:04] now
[1:11:05] as brother branham tells us and i'm
[1:11:07] going to read some quotes from a sermon
[1:11:09] called mother's day
[1:11:11] and he says faith does not place itself
[1:11:14] upon
[1:11:15] the shifting signs of what it can see
[1:11:19] faith rests solemnly upon the unmovable
[1:11:22] rock
[1:11:23] of god's eternal word for by faith said
[1:11:27] the scripture she did this and he's
[1:11:29] referring to how that moses mother put
[1:11:32] the baby into the waters
[1:11:35] and he said faith can take his stand on
[1:11:37] the rock
[1:11:39] that the waves that are beating the
[1:11:40] foundations out and look straight in the
[1:11:43] face of death and know that it'll be
[1:11:45] just in a little bit but faith can look
[1:11:48] across the sea to him that said i am the
[1:11:51] resurrection in the life and fail to
[1:11:53] even hear the waves dashing
[1:11:57] hallelujah
[1:11:58] amen you know i think in that moment so
[1:12:01] many times the saints of god embrace
[1:12:05] that moment
[1:12:06] they have a zealous anticipation i
[1:12:10] remember when my wife was was passing
[1:12:13] you know before that time she uh you
[1:12:16] know in the months proceeding she was
[1:12:18] afraid to be alone and i was on a really
[1:12:20] short leash and and she didn't want me
[1:12:23] out of her sight and i you know i felt
[1:12:25] like i was almost her security she was
[1:12:27] always afraid something was going to
[1:12:29] happen and and she wanted me right there
[1:12:32] and all of that but when she come down
[1:12:34] to that moment
[1:12:36] when we sat together with our last
[1:12:38] conversation
[1:12:39] and i said karen i don't know when we're
[1:12:42] going when we're going to leave i said i
[1:12:44] may go before you
[1:12:46] but i said you know you got another
[1:12:47] brain bleed
[1:12:48] and you may go
[1:12:50] and i said to her i said
[1:12:53] i i believe i know the answer i'm sure i
[1:12:56] do
[1:12:56] but i just want to hear you say it
[1:12:59] are you ready to go meet the lord
[1:13:02] she looked at me with clear eyes
[1:13:05] and she you know facing some very
[1:13:07] serious moments and she said tim yes
[1:13:11] i am prepared to meet the lord
[1:13:15] that's the way you want to go and just
[1:13:18] today or the day before she would leave
[1:13:21] this woman that's been laying comatose
[1:13:24] for two weeks in a bed
[1:13:26] hasn't moved a muscle
[1:13:31] laying there in a bed and and even with
[1:13:33] the the the drawbars drawn up except the
[1:13:36] one that you know at the end where you
[1:13:38] can get out because it's illegal to to
[1:13:41] close all the doors or all the bars on
[1:13:43] the bed
[1:13:44] it's called um
[1:13:46] what would it be called entrapment
[1:13:49] anyway they they keep they keep a bar
[1:13:52] down and
[1:13:53] even when the patient is alone and
[1:13:55] they're about
[1:13:57] about three o'clock in the morning
[1:13:59] this wife of mine who has not spoke has
[1:14:02] not moved has not taught has not opened
[1:14:05] an eye has not moved a muscle
[1:14:08] for two weeks
[1:14:11] somehow another slides down out of the
[1:14:13] bed
[1:14:14] comes right down puts her feet on the
[1:14:16] floor slides down on the floor and lays
[1:14:19] over and they find her there
[1:14:21] in the floor
[1:14:23] what was it
[1:14:25] she was
[1:14:26] anticipating a release
[1:14:29] without fear she could look into the
[1:14:32] eyes of death
[1:14:33] and embrace it
[1:14:36] and she could reach for a theophany that
[1:14:39] was coming near her
[1:14:41] as heaven was drawn near and uh and
[1:14:44] earth was beginning to recede and darken
[1:14:47] and fade away here she reached for that
[1:14:50] which is eternal where you never die
[1:14:52] where there's never no sickness where
[1:14:55] all is light because there is no night
[1:14:58] amen because in his presence there is no
[1:15:00] darkness or shadow of turning
[1:15:04] you see in a moment like that when the
[1:15:06] waves are beating and death is coming in
[1:15:10] faith can stand like a solid rock
[1:15:13] knowing i know my redeemer lives
[1:15:16] i'm prepared to go into his presence
[1:15:24] brother branham
[1:15:27] they complained to him apparently
[1:15:30] because someone said
[1:15:32] to him you preached too much on the
[1:15:34] resurrection
[1:15:36] and he said they said must ever message
[1:15:39] he's got something about the
[1:15:40] resurrection
[1:15:42] and he said why sure it's the cardinal
[1:15:44] that means the fundamental
[1:15:46] resting place of the gospel
[1:15:48] no matter what he did if he did not rise
[1:15:51] again from the dead then it was all in
[1:15:53] vain
[1:15:55] it to me proves that he was god it
[1:15:58] proves every claim he had made the
[1:16:00] resurrection
[1:16:02] and
[1:16:03] and it also is the place of the resting
[1:16:06] of the soul it is the starting point it
[1:16:09] is the crowding of our consolation
[1:16:13] and when we see that he raised from the
[1:16:15] dead it places us oh my when we see he's
[1:16:19] alive
[1:16:21] that he's risen from the dead when we
[1:16:22] see he's alive
[1:16:24] it places us with the gospel armor at
[1:16:27] the battlefront to take the place to
[1:16:30] fight for we know he said he that will
[1:16:32] lose his life for my sake shall find it
[1:16:35] again
[1:16:37] hallelujah
[1:16:38] amen when we can see he's alive
[1:16:42] it places us with the iron
[1:16:45] to stand out there and fight
[1:16:49] because we can fight for a conqueror
[1:16:52] amen we're not fighting for a defeated
[1:16:55] one
[1:16:56] we are fighting for a mighty conqueror
[1:17:01] and he said i think it's a great
[1:17:03] coordination of the full gospel it is
[1:17:05] the resurrection and it's the its divine
[1:17:08] promises and the consolation that it
[1:17:11] gives those who are trusting it
[1:17:13] for it promises the great union of our
[1:17:16] united together again
[1:17:18] it promises then to fade in a way of all
[1:17:21] sin
[1:17:22] it promises to fade in a way of all
[1:17:24] deformity
[1:17:26] all the sufferings that we did have and
[1:17:29] have go through it promises all the
[1:17:32] vanishing of it all
[1:17:35] it promises even death will lose its
[1:17:38] hold
[1:17:39] and will rise in the likeness of jesus
[1:17:41] so my opinion the great the resurrection
[1:17:44] is the greatest of all the promises
[1:17:47] in the things of the scripture that's
[1:17:49] where it sealed it
[1:17:51] and the last easter i was preaching
[1:17:53] these five things and you remember this
[1:17:55] because we are tape listeners
[1:17:57] living he loved me
[1:17:59] dying he saved me
[1:18:01] buried he carried my sins far away
[1:18:05] but rising he justified freely forever
[1:18:09] amen and someday
[1:18:12] he's coming
[1:18:14] all glorious day
[1:18:15] and that's the day he says for me that
[1:18:18] great day of days to see what it meant
[1:18:21] to what means to all of us in the
[1:18:23] resurrection as we labor and wait for
[1:18:26] that blessed day of days
[1:18:33] it gives the promise
[1:18:35] that someday
[1:18:37] these old weakling
[1:18:39] weakening feeble
[1:18:41] gray-headed broke-down
[1:18:44] mothers and dads will be changed
[1:18:48] not only will mother sit there by
[1:18:50] ourselves
[1:18:52] but all of her family will be with her
[1:18:56] what a day that will be what a time it
[1:18:58] will be when we look upon the faces of
[1:19:00] those we love so well
[1:19:03] i think of brother branham when he went
[1:19:05] beyond the curtain of time and the great
[1:19:08] welcoming that he received there from
[1:19:11] all from all over the thousands coming
[1:19:14] down
[1:19:15] he said he called them millions
[1:19:17] millions of them just coming down and
[1:19:19] each one waiting for their turn to
[1:19:22] embrace him clapping him on the back and
[1:19:24] said we knew you were coming
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:28] we we couldn't wait for this day
[1:19:32] what a difference that will be
[1:19:35] when we see our loved ones
[1:19:37] what's well the way they'll be
[1:19:39] afflictions taken away
[1:19:42] the mars of suffering will be done
[1:19:45] no more pale cheeks of death
[1:19:48] no more tears from the eyes
[1:19:51] the resurrection promises all of this
[1:19:53] there'd be no more funerals
[1:19:55] no more patting the baby on the cheek
[1:19:57] that's like a piece of stone
[1:19:59] where the undertaker's embalmed and
[1:20:01] pushed out and put pain
[1:20:03] to to
[1:20:04] to look natural
[1:20:06] it'll never be
[1:20:07] needed again
[1:20:10] think of that when we're standing with
[1:20:12] them we see them yonder
[1:20:15] our loved ones our mothers our kindreds
[1:20:18] our friends and to see them in immortal
[1:20:21] bodies
[1:20:22] their celestial bodies watching their
[1:20:25] character seeing how they conduct
[1:20:27] themselves with that sweetness and
[1:20:29] quietness no more nervousness or
[1:20:32] flusterations
[1:20:34] amen to see them standing then and
[1:20:37] standing in the likeness of the
[1:20:40] the lord jesus that'll be a wonderful
[1:20:43] day
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:46] now
[1:20:47] as he says on that resurrection means so
[1:20:50] much to me i'm anticipating that great
[1:20:53] crowning hour and then as the light
[1:20:55] begins to spread
[1:20:57] we'll know as we are known
[1:21:00] we'll understand and we'll remember our
[1:21:03] acquaintances
[1:21:05] brother branham said the longer he was
[1:21:07] there he said the more i began to
[1:21:09] recognize
[1:21:12] friends that went on you know it might
[1:21:14] be a little difficult i knew you looking
[1:21:16] at a certain time in a certain age and i
[1:21:19] didn't i you know and then i see you
[1:21:21] young again and see you i may take me
[1:21:24] for a moment oh yeah that's
[1:21:26] him
[1:21:28] yeah that's that's them i i remember
[1:21:31] even that really really vivid dream i
[1:21:34] had of my mother when she walked in
[1:21:37] into the room and i could see her in a
[1:21:40] beautiful white garment gown like it
[1:21:44] wasn't it wasn't like a
[1:21:45] evening gown it was it was it was a
[1:21:48] dress
[1:21:49] of some sort but it was white that's all
[1:21:51] i i really didn't pay a whole lot of
[1:21:53] attention to is
[1:21:55] and and so on i just was looking at her
[1:21:59] and as she walked in
[1:22:01] the room and i i saw her and i
[1:22:05] i thought my i
[1:22:07] know her
[1:22:09] somehow i know her now i was born when
[1:22:11] she was 33 years old so by the time i
[1:22:14] remembered her you know she was
[1:22:16] middle-aged and
[1:22:17] yeah you're middle age at that age you
[1:22:19] may not want to admit it but you're
[1:22:21] middle age
[1:22:23] timothy had a birthday yesterday 45 he
[1:22:25] said i'm halfway to 90.
[1:22:32] help me lord
[1:22:37] so you know
[1:22:38] they're there again you know we
[1:22:40] as i watched her walk in and
[1:22:42] and i i i'm trying to figure out who she
[1:22:45] is that woman looks familiar to me
[1:22:48] i know her but who is she
[1:22:51] and she she walks in and she
[1:22:54] she sits down just about as far as from
[1:22:57] here to that pew from me and
[1:22:59] she looks at me and
[1:23:01] i i'm looking at her and i'm looking for
[1:23:04] somebody to talk to and not turn and
[1:23:06] brother ron spencer was standing there
[1:23:08] and i said brother ron i said that woman
[1:23:11] that lady right over there i'm kind of
[1:23:13] whispering to him so she won't hear i
[1:23:15] said that lady right there she looks
[1:23:17] remarkably like my mother
[1:23:25] and at that moment
[1:23:26] she looked at me and she said it is me
[1:23:29] tim
[1:23:32] and i just want to tell you
[1:23:36] i just want to tell you you're well
[1:23:38] thought of over here
[1:23:41] and i'm so sorry for all the trouble
[1:23:43] that cost you
[1:23:45] you know
[1:23:46] as i looked at her
[1:23:48] for a moment to help me to see her
[1:23:51] all of a sudden her old face when she
[1:23:54] was 90 something years old 90 let's see
[1:23:57] 92 years old it comes and it meets right
[1:24:00] back on that body for a minute and lifts
[1:24:02] back off just so i can i can identify it
[1:24:06] exactly
[1:24:07] and i look and i look at skin
[1:24:10] so beautiful
[1:24:11] so young
[1:24:13] so so pretty i see the familiar wave in
[1:24:16] her hair her shoulder-length hair
[1:24:21] it's not a fiction
[1:24:25] it's not just a fancy story
[1:24:29] it's a reality
[1:24:31] the bible tells us the prophet tells us
[1:24:34] and then there are then there are
[1:24:36] literally thousands of those with
[1:24:38] near-death experiences that can tell you
[1:24:40] the same thing
[1:24:42] amen but he said that it's a great
[1:24:44] crowding moment
[1:24:46] he said you know and as the light begins
[1:24:49] to spread and we become known as we'll
[1:24:52] know as we are known we'll understand
[1:24:55] and we'll remember our acquaintances and
[1:24:57] the ones that has been there
[1:25:00] and many many there be many there that
[1:25:03] we didn't even think would be there
[1:25:05] think of that
[1:25:07] many there we didn't think would be
[1:25:09] there
[1:25:10] are you listening to me amen
[1:25:13] brother zane listen real close amen for
[1:25:16] you'll know it it's at that time i
[1:25:19] believe that the bread that we cast upon
[1:25:23] the human troubled waters will return to
[1:25:26] us on that day
[1:25:28] when we see the effects of our testimony
[1:25:31] on people that we didn't understand
[1:25:33] their actions toward it
[1:25:35] we'll probably be there what a day that
[1:25:38] will be in the seeds that we sowed not
[1:25:41] even thinking that what they would do
[1:25:43] but here they are they brought forth
[1:25:46] precious fruits and we'll see them on
[1:25:49] that day the wayward loved ones and
[1:25:52] relatives
[1:25:58] i'm talking about a god full of grace
[1:26:02] of god that is full of mercy
[1:26:06] and i think of the thousands i've seen
[1:26:08] converted yes to the millions now
[1:26:11] going in what their ministry was
[1:26:13] and oh it'll take more than a
[1:26:15] resurrection it'll take eternity to go
[1:26:17] around shaking hands and finding things
[1:26:19] out that i don't know now there will be
[1:26:22] those old gray-headed mothers that
[1:26:25] you're wearing those white flowers for
[1:26:27] today that's a tradition here in america
[1:26:29] you know
[1:26:30] wear a white flower for
[1:26:31] for uh for a mother
[1:26:34] that has already gone on and they'll be
[1:26:36] beautiful not represented by a pot of
[1:26:39] flower or some grey-headed mother per or
[1:26:41] grey-headed person but in the likeness
[1:26:44] and the beauty of the resurrection
[1:26:46] they'll stand in the likeness of christ
[1:26:48] their celestial bodies young and
[1:26:51] beautiful forever
[1:26:53] sure that's the rest that's the mother's
[1:26:54] day that i'm waiting for
[1:26:57] that's the coronation not the the
[1:26:59] coronation on the on the lapel but the
[1:27:02] coronation
[1:27:03] of the soul
[1:27:05] not the carnation on the lapel but the
[1:27:07] coronation of the soul for god has
[1:27:10] changed her
[1:27:11] i think of my old mother
[1:27:13] you know old and feeble shaken with
[1:27:15] palsy
[1:27:16] she'll not be doing there that day
[1:27:19] it'll be different
[1:27:21] and the great light begins to spread out
[1:27:24] as we begin to look around and the great
[1:27:27] circle will begin to get greater and
[1:27:30] greater and greater and it's all just
[1:27:33] reflecting the approach of jesus and
[1:27:36] after a while as the song said i shall
[1:27:40] see jesus at last he'll be waiting for
[1:27:43] me
[1:27:43] jesus so kind and true on this beautiful
[1:27:46] throne he'll welcome me home after this
[1:27:49] day is through
[1:27:51] then we'll see him
[1:27:52] and will not be as we are now
[1:27:55] we will know how to love him more think
[1:28:00] of that when we get there we'll even
[1:28:02] know how to love him more
[1:28:05] will not stand back with a little fear
[1:28:08] because we'll be like him
[1:28:11] amen he'll be more of a relative to us
[1:28:15] than he is now
[1:28:17] we'll understand him better
[1:28:19] because we're so far away in these
[1:28:22] mortal bodies but then we'll have a body
[1:28:25] like his glorious body we'll know how to
[1:28:28] worship him
[1:28:30] and when we see what his presence of his
[1:28:32] being has done to us
[1:28:34] it has changed us to back the old back
[1:28:38] to young and all the deformed are you
[1:28:41] listening to me now
[1:28:43] all the blemishes all the deform
[1:28:46] a man straightened out will understand
[1:28:49] then why his power has healed us
[1:28:52] the questions that has been in our minds
[1:28:57] and we get questions along the road
[1:28:59] we wonder we question why and why did
[1:29:02] this happen and why did life turn out
[1:29:04] like this and how come i went through

[1:29:11] i did everything to believe i i i
[1:29:14] confessed the promises i did everything
[1:29:17] but you know again
[1:29:19] again you know we get questions in our
[1:29:21] minds
[1:29:23] and he says
[1:29:25] and
[1:29:26] and he said the question that's been in
[1:29:28] our minds
[1:29:29] how can he do it
[1:29:31] what would this
[1:29:33] somehow mysteriously
[1:29:35] they'll all fade away
[1:29:38] the knots
[1:29:39] that has been tied in the back of our
[1:29:41] minds
[1:29:43] how will this be
[1:29:44] how could it be
[1:29:46] somehow or another the majestic fingers
[1:29:50] will just untangle and unravel those
[1:29:53] knots and it'll all fade away
[1:29:57] into one big crown of love
[1:30:03] the questions
[1:30:04] the wonders
[1:30:06] the troubles
[1:30:08] the wise
[1:30:10] all the tangled knots in your mind
[1:30:14] why is this this way and how could this
[1:30:16] be and why does this happen that way and
[1:30:19] why is life so difficult and why do that
[1:30:22] i have such a hard time
[1:30:24] why why was my road and my cross so
[1:30:27] heavy why did others seem to have a
[1:30:29] lighter cross than mine
[1:30:33] all the knots

[1:30:39] and will untangle and unravel those
[1:30:42] knots
[1:30:43] and it'll all fade into one big crown
[1:30:47] of love
[1:30:50] it was him who promised
[1:30:52] this in revelation 1 that which said a
[1:30:55] sharp two-edged sword went out of his
[1:30:57] mouth
[1:30:58] he was called the word of god it was
[1:30:59] from the same lips and said i'm he that
[1:31:02] is alive that was dead and i'm alive
[1:31:04] forevermore
[1:31:06] from those same lips in saint john 6 to
[1:31:09] 30 it says this i will lose nothing but
[1:31:12] i'll raise it up again at the last days
[1:31:15] was made him that made the promise those
[1:31:18] same precious lips he's the one who
[1:31:22] saves us who heals us who redeems us and
[1:31:25] who will raise us up at the last day
[1:31:29] now sitting here today there may be some
[1:31:32] of you that's actually
[1:31:34] the weakest link in your family
[1:31:37] maybe you're not here maybe you're only
[1:31:39] listening in maybe you'll hear this
[1:31:41] months from here
[1:31:42] but you're the weakest link in the
[1:31:44] family
[1:31:46] and that weak link that weakens link
[1:31:48] that would separate
[1:31:50] your great family on that day
[1:31:53] and you would be missing on that day
[1:31:57] may the god of heaven somehow
[1:31:59] in his
[1:32:01] majestic and mysterious way unravel all
[1:32:04] those little nuts
[1:32:07] that is tied in your mind is there a god
[1:32:09] or does he really care for me you know
[1:32:12] have i done too much to be saved or you
[1:32:15] know if i cross the line or all these
[1:32:18] other questions or whatever that you
[1:32:20] went through
[1:32:21] you know why why why why why why did
[1:32:24] this happen to me
[1:32:28] may god unravel those little knots in
[1:32:30] your mind and reveal to you
[1:32:33] the love that he has for you and you
[1:32:34] come sweetly to serve him
[1:32:37] little knots that get tied up in your
[1:32:39] mind
[1:32:40] because of science
[1:32:42] because of the evil age
[1:32:45] because of all the doubt
[1:32:47] the confusion the demonic influences
[1:32:50] the powers of evil spirits that
[1:32:53] predominate this age where that even
[1:32:56] more has been released in this time 300
[1:33:00] million
[1:33:01] supernatural demons into this age
[1:33:03] crowding in
[1:33:04] as if there hadn't been enough devils
[1:33:06] already down to the ages this age gets a
[1:33:09] lot more
[1:33:14] little knots tied up in your minds
[1:33:17] accumulating there things that says god
[1:33:20] isn't real or questions his reality
[1:33:25] or that the message isn't true
[1:33:29] or the bible isn't so
[1:33:32] knocks in your mind that's caused by
[1:33:34] others
[1:33:36] sometimes even by church members
[1:33:38] preachers friends
[1:33:40] amen says you know that nuts that are in
[1:33:43] the mind of popular opinions of the
[1:33:45] world
[1:33:46] what the great theologians are said or
[1:33:49] the smart minds are
[1:33:56] brother braden would say let them
[1:33:58] unravel this morning by the immortal
[1:34:01] as he vibrates across the words of god's
[1:34:04] bible like a well-tuned instrument to
[1:34:07] sing the rhythm i am he that was dead
[1:34:11] and is alive forevermore and a little
[1:34:13] while the world sees me no more yet you
[1:34:15] will see me for i'll be with you even in
[1:34:18] you to the end of the world and it shall
[1:34:20] come to pass oh listen he say that is
[1:34:23] singing out
[1:34:24] of every scripture it shall come to pass
[1:34:27] in the last days saith god i'll pour out
[1:34:30] my
[1:34:30] spirit upon all flesh and signs and
[1:34:34] wonders the old men will dream dreams
[1:34:36] and young men shall see visions the
[1:34:38] signs of the latter rain and the end
[1:34:41] times let it be felt among us
[1:34:44] hallelujah this this outpouring of the
[1:34:47] holy ghost
[1:34:48] this final outpouring where he begin to
[1:34:51] pour it out
[1:34:52] from the day of pentecost
[1:34:55] and he empties it into a people in this
[1:34:57] last day

[1:35:03] that will lift the bride off the earth
[1:35:05] in the glory

[1:35:10] spirit that resurrects you from dead
[1:35:12] works to serve the living god
[1:35:15] i think of these knots sometimes
[1:35:18] that are in people's minds
[1:35:21] preachers trying to convince them
[1:35:24] twisting their minds to
[1:35:26] oh we're not to get excited about this

[1:37:02] playing and practicing and winning a
[1:37:05] video game
[1:37:07] and they're excited about it

[1:37:39] a sleepless night
[1:37:41] lost time
[1:37:43] worthless wasted moments
[1:37:49] and then you know that's all going on
[1:37:51] and then somebody gets upset because
[1:37:53] somebody gets excited
[1:37:56] about a real gospel that changes real
[1:37:59] lives
[1:38:01] hallelujah that sets young people on

[1:38:14] down down and and when they were leaving
[1:38:17] egypt there was a bunch that left egypt
[1:38:19] a mixed multitude there was a bunch of
[1:38:22] them that just would not believe no
[1:38:24] matter how many signs and water you
[1:38:26] would think they would be convinced
[1:38:28] when they see god open a red sea and god
[1:38:30] bring food out of the heavens and god
[1:38:33] pour water out of a rock
[1:38:36] amen when god would would put up a
[1:38:38] brazen serpent and heal all the serpent
[1:38:41] bites
[1:38:42] and win their battles and do mighty
[1:38:44] things and the thunders and the roaring
[1:38:47] upon the mountains
[1:38:54] but they wouldn't believe
[1:38:57] no matter what they wouldn't believe
[1:39:01] but you know unbelief does not hinder
[1:39:03] god
[1:39:04] it only hinders the unbeliever
[1:39:07] god was going to have somebody that was
[1:39:09] going to take the lamb
[1:39:13] amen you can be a deadhead if you want
[1:39:15] to
[1:39:16] you can be of old and died in the world
[1:39:19] all you want to but i'll tell you in
[1:39:21] that moment god will raise up a new
[1:39:25] when you say it ain't him that it's
[1:39:27] impossible to live for god when you say
[1:39:31] all the holy ghost won't keep you it
[1:39:33] won't it is not a power of god in the
[1:39:36] salvation it won't keep you from
[1:39:38] drinking and smoking and adultery and
[1:39:40] pornography when you say we can't take
[1:39:42] the land
[1:39:43] there's going to be a generation of
[1:39:45] young people
[1:39:47] amen that they got a fire in their bosom
[1:39:50] they got a desire in their heart and
[1:39:52] they're going to press the battle and
[1:39:54] they're going to go out
[1:39:56] over jordan
[1:39:58] they're going to take every divine
[1:40:00] promise
[1:40:02] brother branham told us god had to wait
[1:40:04] until the fighters all died off yes
[1:40:08] that's right
[1:40:09] and he started with a new generation
[1:40:11] [Music]
[1:40:13] under the leadership of joshua

[1:40:47] kinds of gifts of god and that's uh
[1:40:50] that's 1963 after the seals by the way
[1:40:54] oh may this young generation
[1:40:57] who he called pentecostals
[1:40:59] get the vision

[1:41:04] ought to be aware
[1:41:07] we have all kinds of gifts of god
[1:41:11] amen amen
[1:41:13] amen i'll tell you what i wouldn't be
[1:41:15] satisfied wherever i was short of
[1:41:17] anything god has
[1:41:23] amen
[1:41:24] no
[1:41:25] tongues and gifts is not the holy ghost
[1:41:28] they are gifts of the spirit

[1:41:37] amen no they don't come every time
[1:41:40] somebody get the holy ghost you don't
[1:41:42] speak in tongues every time you get the
[1:41:44] holy ghost

[1:41:47] you laid under the altar of god long
[1:41:49] enough sooner or later you would
[1:41:53] amen i hear an apostle paul saying i
[1:41:56] would that you all spoke with tongues it
[1:41:58] must not be too bad
[1:42:01] amen

[1:42:06] saying despise not prophesied
[1:42:10] amen i hear it i hear him speaking of
[1:42:14] things that are laying in the word
[1:42:16] and many are claiming well we've already
[1:42:19] we're already past that you never
[1:42:21] achieved that
[1:42:22] right
[1:42:24] how can you get past something you've
[1:42:26] never been to yet
[1:42:29] amen you're still in an age or two
[1:42:31] beyond that back to methodist or baptist
[1:42:34] with a cold formal profession instead of
[1:42:37] a real genuine baptism of the spirit
[1:42:43] well you say well brother tim now yeah
[1:42:46] you're just trying to get people in
[1:42:48] enthuse well
[1:42:50] you know i happen to heard a prophet of
[1:42:52] god say
[1:42:53] in the last year of his life we must
[1:42:56] never lose our enthusiasm
[1:42:59] for this resurrection
[1:43:04] amen we must never lose our enthusiasm
[1:43:08] and we're preaching about
[1:43:10] the most greatest event in all the world
[1:43:14] not that he was crucified but he rose
[1:43:19] hallelujah but not that he just rose it
[1:43:21] went to heaven but he shared the
[1:43:23] benefits of it by coming down in your
[1:43:26] life so that because he lives you live
[1:43:29] also
[1:43:31] amen that the life that he has become
[1:43:34] lives out of your life
[1:43:37] it's called the holy spirit
[1:43:39] it's not a separate god it's the same
[1:43:41] god in spirit form it's jesus come back
[1:43:44] again
[1:43:49] that's why he's here and he's coming
[1:43:54] he's here in the form of the holy spirit
[1:43:55] but he's coming in a corporal body
[1:43:57] we will meet him in the air that's what
[1:43:59] believers believe
[1:44:02] there is a real jesus
[1:44:05] he is in the heavens
[1:44:07] he is there
[1:44:08] it was proved over and again by the
[1:44:10] prophet's ministry he's still the high
[1:44:12] priest
[1:44:14] that can be touched by the feelings of
[1:44:16] your infirmities
[1:44:18] amen after preaching who is this
[1:44:20] melchizedek in 1965 a mystery revealed
[1:44:24] because the seals was open brother
[1:44:26] branham would say i will still show you
[1:44:28] he's still the high priest and you can
[1:44:30] touch him
[1:44:33] hey man and people were called out
[1:44:35] because their faith touched
[1:44:38] god
[1:44:39] and god spoke back through the prophet
[1:44:41] to them
[1:44:42] and he said who did they touch
[1:44:45] hey man they're
[1:44:47] they're 30 40 feet from me they couldn't
[1:44:50] touch me they touched the high priest
[1:44:53] oh i'm so glad today we can still touch
[1:44:57] the high priest
[1:44:58] whoever liveth
[1:45:01] amen whoever liveth to make intercession
[1:45:05] on our confessions

[1:47:46] saw the pretending of them that he's
[1:47:49] alive but i witness
[1:47:52] an eyewitness he is not dead

[1:48:28] we pentecostal people
[1:48:31] we've lost our joy
[1:48:33] we've lost our emotions
[1:48:37] he said that's our trouble
[1:48:40] hear it around the world right now
[1:48:42] that's your trouble
[1:48:44] you've lost your emotions you lost your
[1:48:46] joy
[1:48:48] you're telling an old drab story of some
[1:48:50] denominational fiction oh yeah he raised
[1:48:53] from the dead
[1:48:56] he died
[1:49:00] but you've never experienced it you've
[1:49:01] never met him
[1:49:04] you're just telling what somebody else
[1:49:06] tells us
[1:49:07] so it's not exciting to you
[1:49:12] we've lost our joy we lost our emotion
[1:49:14] billy graham said the other night
[1:49:16] then preachers collars turned around
[1:49:18] going down south clapping their hands
[1:49:20] beating their feet up and down the
[1:49:21] ground stomping they had something they
[1:49:23] were happy about well yeah
[1:49:25] i got something i'm happy about
[1:49:29] see yeah yeah we have lost our emotion
[1:49:32] he tells us in the message first
[1:49:34] he says when he's speaking of a thirst
[1:49:36] for god he tries to tell us don't
[1:49:38] satisfy with the world
[1:49:40] don't satisfy you you say oh brother
[1:49:42] branham i shouted once i danced in
[1:49:45] spirit don't take that
[1:49:48] wait till that satisfaction comes that
[1:49:51] satisfaction portion of the fullness of
[1:49:53] the spirit comes in and when then
[1:49:57] then these joy bells of shouting and
[1:50:00] speaking in tongues and dancing in the
[1:50:02] spirit will come
[1:50:05] you won't have to do it by the music
[1:50:07] you'll do it when you're going down the
[1:50:08] road in your car you'll do it when
[1:50:11] you're sweeping the floor you'll do it
[1:50:13] when you're driving the nails and the
[1:50:14] walls with your carpenter wherever you
[1:50:17] are that joyous people and full of glory
[1:50:21] amen it won't be just in church that joy
[1:50:25] will go with you in the car
[1:50:27] as you're hearing the songs or if you're
[1:50:29] just praying and worshiping and you're
[1:50:31] just going down and your mind's turned
[1:50:33] to him it'll cut out
[1:50:36] hallelujah amen
[1:50:39] that glory of seeing
[1:50:41] the resurrected christ
[1:50:44] being the same yesterday today and
[1:50:46] forever
[1:50:48] oh that's glorious
[1:50:51] go tell amen
[1:50:53] as brother bradham said
[1:50:57] this is a quote that brother
[1:50:59] ben pruitt didn't read but he quoted the
[1:51:02] other day did a wonderful job
[1:51:03] paraphrasing it actually
[1:51:05] he said no man has a right to preach the
[1:51:07] gospel
[1:51:09] no ma no person has a right to call
[1:51:11] themself a christian
[1:51:13] until they can go back in a certain time
[1:51:15] in their life
[1:51:16] where they can come on that sacred sands
[1:51:19] at the backside the deserts
[1:51:21] where they know they have met god
[1:51:24] and all the infidels in the world and
[1:51:26] intellectual giants taking the bible
[1:51:29] explaining away all the days of miracles
[1:51:32] their past there's no such things as
[1:51:35] divine healing all this stuff like
[1:51:37] speaking in tongues interpretation of
[1:51:40] tongues and gifts of healing and the
[1:51:42] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:51:45] you see
[1:51:46] intellectual giants can come along and
[1:51:49] they can slip in and take your mind
[1:51:52] and twist you
[1:51:55] in such a way
[1:51:57] until they can actually take those
[1:52:00] things from your memory
[1:52:03] they'll point you to
[1:52:05] to other things well you know and make
[1:52:08] it well it happened in the prophet's day
[1:52:10] but it can't happen today
[1:52:15] but he said i want you to get this
[1:52:17] if a man ever stood on the sacred sands
[1:52:20] of the backside of the desert when he
[1:52:22] meets god face to face
[1:52:24] there's not enough devils in all of hell
[1:52:27] that could take that away from him he
[1:52:30] knows he met god
[1:52:32] he knows he had an experience he talked
[1:52:35] to god regardless of what that
[1:52:38] opposition is he can say from that time
[1:52:41] something changed me
[1:52:44] so intellectual giants can may be able
[1:52:47] to take away the memory
[1:52:49] of what god did for you by explaining it
[1:52:53] away and twisting your mind around
[1:52:55] tying it up a notch i mean see in the
[1:52:59] days of miracles are past
[1:53:01] but they can't steal the change
[1:53:04] that the pillar of fire brought to you
[1:53:06] on those sacred sounds
[1:53:09] amen they might twist you around in your
[1:53:12] mind for a moment but they can't steal
[1:53:14] the change
[1:53:16] amen god made the change in your life
[1:53:19] these knots
[1:53:21] they try to put in your mind
[1:53:23] twisting the quotes around in the
[1:53:26] scriptures
[1:53:27] saying the holy ghost we receive is
[1:53:30] only just emotion
[1:53:32] oh they're not getting the holy ghost
[1:53:33] they're just getting emotional that
[1:53:35] youth camp down there why they have that
[1:53:37] and them kids just get emotional i know
[1:53:39] some they got emotional and it didn't
[1:53:41] last well i know some got emotional and
[1:53:43] they did lies
[1:53:49] amen
[1:53:53] i know a lot got an intellectual
[1:53:54] conception and nothing lasted all right
[1:54:01] today the scientific theory of the
[1:54:04] modern so-called religious groups have
[1:54:06] tried to prove this is your prophet
[1:54:09] that to prove that this blessed thing
[1:54:11] that we have called the holy spirit is
[1:54:14] only emotion
[1:54:16] see you just don't stand up to their
[1:54:18] scientific theory
[1:54:20] well i'd like to ask them this
[1:54:22] what makes them change
[1:54:25] what makes the drunkard stop drinking
[1:54:29] hallelujah what makes the prostitute
[1:54:32] cease her life
[1:54:34] our evil life what makes that cancer and
[1:54:37] diseases depart from the people and the
[1:54:40] death and the dumb and the blind and the
[1:54:42] dead to raise up explain that is that
[1:54:45] emotion
[1:54:46] it has emotion with it certainly
[1:54:50] hallelujah
[1:54:52] amen anything he said that's alive has
[1:54:54] emotion
[1:54:56] and anything that doesn't have emotion
[1:54:58] is dead
[1:55:00] excuse the expression but i think we
[1:55:02] ought to bury some of our emotions
[1:55:04] religion then because it is dead it has
[1:55:07] no emotion to it
[1:55:09] any religion that has not got emotion
[1:55:12] should be buried uh-huh
[1:55:14] because it is emotional
[1:55:16] jesus when he entered the city the
[1:55:18] children and all of them all his friends
[1:55:20] christ hosanna him that cometh in the
[1:55:23] name of the lord and those religionists
[1:55:25] of that day couldn't stand it it was too
[1:55:28] emotional
[1:55:29] and he said if they hold their peace the
[1:55:32] rocks will immediately cry out something
[1:55:34] must cry out because life was there
[1:55:38] amen i want to ask you what happened to
[1:55:39] that 13 year old boy andrew glover
[1:55:44] if i know him
[1:55:45] amen who got the holy ghost
[1:55:48] at youth camp
[1:55:50] amen was that only emotion no
[1:55:52] amen the holy ghost was not emotion but
[1:55:55] it was but the experience of receiving
[1:55:57] it is emotional
[1:56:01] hallelujah you know there's a lot of
[1:56:03] people jump that don't get it
[1:56:05] hey man you don't jump to get it you
[1:56:07] jump because you got it
[1:56:09] you man you don't shout to get it you
[1:56:11] shout cause you got it it is i mean you
[1:56:14] you don't cry to get it but you'll cry
[1:56:16] when you get it
[1:56:17] amen you see it's something there it's
[1:56:20] not emotion but it brings emotion with
[1:56:23] it
[1:56:25] i was told of a young man who testified
[1:56:28] of being sound of being saved from
[1:56:30] drowning
[1:56:32] and when he does he gets emotional about
[1:56:34] it
[1:56:36] amen the event changed his life he's
[1:56:38] never been the same
[1:56:40] he was almost dead amen and and he was
[1:56:43] saved
[1:56:45] and he when he thinks about it again you
[1:56:47] know it it it makes him emotional
[1:56:50] and you see the emotion didn't save him
[1:56:55] i'm sure he while he was drowning he got
[1:56:57] real emotional haven't it help me save
[1:57:00] me save me go down below
[1:57:06] he was emotional he probably was crying
[1:57:08] shouting everything else
[1:57:10] amen but that did not save him the
[1:57:13] emotion didn't save him what saved him
[1:57:15] was the act of somebody who rescued him
[1:57:19] but when he got saved he sure was
[1:57:21] thankful
[1:57:22] and just thinking about it again made
[1:57:24] him emotional
[1:57:26] [Applause]
[1:57:27] hallelujah it isn't that that saves us
[1:57:30] even though sometimes people need to cry
[1:57:32] out
[1:57:34] amen they say jesus i'm perishing they
[1:57:37] need to get desperate before god
[1:57:39] hey man they need to call him on the
[1:57:41] scene they need to say lord i am
[1:57:44] perishing i am lost i need a savior but
[1:57:47] when he comes and saves them they can
[1:57:48] get up and say thank god i'm safe thank
[1:57:51] god i'm saying thank you for the blood i
[1:57:54] feel so clean i am so different
[1:58:01] emotion didn't
[1:58:03] bring jesus from the grave
[1:58:08] an emotion didn't keep him from the
[1:58:10] grave
[1:58:13] but his resurrection caused great
[1:58:16] emotions of joy
[1:58:20] on now
[1:58:21] amen in fact to the matter it was even
[1:58:24] sensational to jesus
[1:58:26] when he raised from the grave it was a
[1:58:29] sensational moment his body sensed it it
[1:58:32] came to life it had feeling in it again
[1:58:36] it could eat again

[1:58:40] wall

[1:58:44] amen it was a glorified body
[1:58:47] amen it was sensational
[1:58:50] come on
[1:58:51] amen and when they saw that he was
[1:58:54] raised it caused great emotions of joy
[1:58:57] and it caused great excitement to tell

[2:03:01] those want to preach the people happy
[2:03:04] well i'll tell you what
[2:03:05] we are happy because in his death
[2:03:08] he made us heir to all things
[2:03:13] amen since the last will and testament
[2:03:15] is not in effect until the one who made
[2:03:18] the wheel died
[2:03:20] he had to die
[2:03:22] to make it to bring the scriptures in
[2:03:25] effect for me and you
[2:03:27] you see brother tim brother timothy
[2:03:29] preached on being of the same house of
[2:03:31] the house of abraham being born in that
[2:03:33] house we couldn't as gentiles
[2:03:36] but through his death
[2:03:38] through the royal seed
[2:03:40] amen then we can be born again as the
[2:03:44] royal seed of abraham and then heir to
[2:03:48] every promise that is written to abraham
[2:03:51] and his seed
[2:03:53] hallelujah so read the old testament
[2:03:55] amen say abraham and his seed
[2:03:58] amen read what the bible said it's
[2:04:00] abraham and his seed
[2:04:02] we are heirs to it
[2:04:04] is that right
[2:04:06] now again it's not in effect
[2:04:09] until the one who made the wheel dies
[2:04:13] you see when
[2:04:14] my you know a year or more before sister
[2:04:17] karen passed away we kind of settled
[2:04:19] some of our states and i wrote out a
[2:04:21] wheel to her she wrote out a will to me
[2:04:24] but that piece of paper was worthless
[2:04:27] as long as she was alive
[2:04:32] amen
[2:04:33] now i i didn't i didn't get something i
[2:04:36] didn't already own because you know me
[2:04:38] and her together owned the estate
[2:04:41] amen what was hers was mine and what was
[2:04:44] mine was hers
[2:04:46] and my but she she would wield
[2:04:47] everything to me and i wheeled
[2:04:49] everything to her
[2:04:50] but it was not of in fact until she died
[2:04:54] now now what
[2:04:56] makes us happy
[2:04:58] is not because he died
[2:05:01] that don't make me happy
[2:05:04] it makes me soft when i think of how he
[2:05:07] died
[2:05:09] when i think of the awful cost
[2:05:12] but in dying
[2:05:14] he bequeathed to us
[2:05:16] all that heaven owns
[2:05:20] amen and he made us a joint heir with
[2:05:22] him
[2:05:24] but when he rose from the dead
[2:05:28] amen he came to enforce the division of
[2:05:31] the inheritance
[2:05:33] amen you know a there again so because
[2:05:35] he lives that he can share his life with
[2:05:39] us by the baptism of the holy ghost and
[2:05:42] we have life also
[2:05:46] because he lives
[2:05:47] we lives
[2:05:48] and everything she had is ours so the
[2:05:52] same word that spoke to the groom speaks
[2:05:55] also of the bride and as the groom
[2:05:57] fulfills the old testament the bride
[2:05:59] fulfills the
[2:06:00] new covenant
[2:06:02] last wheel and testament
[2:06:06] and this inheritance
[2:06:08] makes me very happy
[2:06:12] amen
[2:06:14] now
[2:06:15] so this inheritance makes me happy
[2:06:18] and my happiness
[2:06:20] is not
[2:06:21] temporary
[2:06:24] because nothing can take it away
[2:06:30] amen
[2:06:32] amen glory to god the inheritance makes
[2:06:36] me happy
[2:06:37] and my happiness is not temporary
[2:06:42] because nothing can take my happiness
[2:06:45] away
[2:06:46] no trial no test no problem
[2:06:50] because i own everything he has
[2:06:54] come on now church
[2:06:56] amen you know the the rite of
[2:06:59] inheritance is really real
[2:07:03] i mean go get go back counter to my desk
[2:07:05] and bring me my wallet
[2:07:07] the right of inheritance
[2:07:09] is really real

[2:07:17] young's grandson luke
[2:07:20] you know him and andrew they watched me
[2:07:22] as i
[2:07:23] i got a beautiful knife for my birthday
[2:07:26] i think my son had given it to me
[2:07:29] and so
[2:07:30] you know i unwrapped it and was
[2:07:33] revealing and reveling in its beauty and
[2:07:36] it was a handmade knife and the
[2:07:37] craftsmanship and i was just looking at
[2:07:39] it and admiring it and
[2:07:41] back in my room i had a little place
[2:07:43] where i i put all my
[2:07:46] knives i'm not a big collector but i
[2:07:48] have a few
[2:07:51] and so

[2:07:56] as i i unraveled it and whatever i
[2:08:00] decided well

[2:08:03] collection
[2:08:04] so as i did my two young grandsons
[2:08:07] andrew and and and luke
[2:08:10] walks in behind me and they want to see

[2:08:23] this and from so and so
[2:08:25] luke is about seven eight years old and
[2:08:28] he looks at me with all sincerity and he
[2:08:31] said papa
[2:08:32] he said you do know when you die we're
[2:08:34] getting all of this
[2:08:38] you see luke knew
[2:08:41] luke knew that you know that because you
[2:08:45] know that he would we couldn't inherit
[2:08:46] this until i
[2:08:48] died and we could not inherit all the
[2:08:51] promises of the gentiles we were we were
[2:08:54] aliens
[2:08:56] we were outcasts of the family of god
[2:09:00] we had no right come on we had no right
[2:09:03] to isaiah's prophecies we had no rights
[2:09:06] to the promised messiah we didn't have a
[2:09:09] right to jesus himself
[2:09:12] but when he died
[2:09:14] hallelujah he left to us a will

[2:14:29] i can unlock every chain the devil tries
[2:14:31] to put on me
[2:14:33] or put on his children
[2:14:35] that's why i've seen in his name we cast
[2:14:37] out devils
[2:14:39] in his name we speak with new tongues
[2:14:42] we speak heaven's language
[2:14:50] heavenly language
[2:14:54] brother branham told us it would bring
[2:14:55] forth
[2:14:57] genuine tongues and genuine new tongues
[2:15:02] it's the quickening power
[2:15:04] it's the holy ghost
[2:15:06] you're an hour
[2:15:08] this outpouring is promised
[2:15:11] don't quench it
[2:15:13] don't put it to another age
[2:15:17] you know we're running out of time
[2:15:22] we ain't got another age
[2:15:24] we're in the last days little children
[2:15:27] time to press with everything that's
[2:15:29] within you
[2:15:31] surrender your life
[2:15:33] surrender your all
[2:15:35] brother branham said i am an heir to all
[2:15:38] things
[2:15:39] both seen
[2:15:41] present
[2:15:42] future
[2:15:43] to everything
[2:15:46] i'm an heir to it
[2:15:53] and he had to die
[2:15:55] so we could get this
[2:15:59] but he didn't stay dead
[2:16:02] he came back to enjoy that life
[2:16:05] with us
[2:16:06] and in us
[2:16:10] now the thoughts in your minds
[2:16:13] you're trying to unravel
[2:16:18] the troubles
[2:16:22] just realize there's a lot of those
[2:16:24] tangles
[2:16:26] that are there that maybe you don't will
[2:16:28] never understand in this life
[2:16:32] but when you stand there
[2:16:35] with the redeemed of all ages
[2:16:38] when joy when you've
[2:16:40] when you realize
[2:16:42] that your message wasn't in vain when i
[2:16:44] stand there
[2:16:48] you know i
[2:16:49] in in this church right now i i met a
[2:16:52] little sister sister erica up there
[2:17:00] there and their families
[2:17:02] come down to be a part with us
[2:17:07] little sister erica in 1993 came to
[2:17:09] youth camp
[2:17:11] and this little short black-headed
[2:17:14] preacher came out and preached
[2:17:17] and the holy spirit moved
[2:17:20] she got the baptism of the holy ghost in
[2:17:22] that meeting
[2:17:25] i never knew that
[2:17:27] until the other day when i met her
[2:17:30] then i found out the fruits
[2:17:33] of that service
[2:17:35] even though it was only just one there
[2:17:37] were probably many
[2:17:42] but when we get over there
[2:17:45] people you rub shoulders with
[2:17:49] hey coach
[2:17:50] [Music]
[2:17:53] i thought you were just a baptist boy
[2:17:54] i'm didn't know you might would make it
[2:17:59] well aaron it was your testimony
[2:18:03] that made me
[2:18:04] seek for something more real than what i
[2:18:06] had
[2:18:14] knots
[2:18:16] in your mind
[2:18:18] i tried my best
[2:18:20] i did all i could
[2:18:23] maybe raise your children right and they
[2:18:24] ain't done turned out right
[2:18:28] commit them to god
[2:18:32] you sowed
[2:18:34] you're going to reap
[2:18:36] to love god
[2:18:39] trust
[2:18:40] believe
[2:18:46] you're an heir
[2:18:49] brother branham told us often he said
[2:18:51] there be people there you never thought
[2:18:53] would have made it
[2:19:00] well brother tim we you didn't preach
[2:19:02] doctrine like we did and
[2:19:04] you didn't
[2:19:05] you didn't not ever eye and cross every
[2:19:08] tea i didn't think you'd make it well
[2:19:11] i tell you how i made it
[2:19:14] it was amazing grace
[2:19:17] and if you make it
[2:19:19] it's going to be amazing grace
[2:19:22] grace
[2:19:24] that is absolutely
[2:19:26] amazing
[2:19:28] one thing our prophet told us
[2:19:31] when i went beyond the curtain of time
[2:19:36] he said they
[2:19:37] told me there
[2:19:40] no one can enter here without perfect
[2:19:43] love
[2:19:52] and perfect love is what you priest is
[2:19:55] the holy ghost
[2:19:58] you know because that's god's divine
[2:20:00] nature it's his divine life
[2:20:05] and his very essence of his beings is
[2:20:08] love
[2:20:13] and you made a million mistakes
[2:20:16] and he still loved you
[2:20:23] and he reached
[2:20:25] so far down
[2:20:30] that he would leave all of heaven
[2:20:33] and come to earth
[2:20:35] and go to hell for you
[2:20:40] because he didn't want heaven
[2:20:42] without you
[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:54] i want him there
[2:20:56] it's not going to be heaven even to me
[2:20:59] without my children there he says
[2:21:04] there'll be none of them lost
[2:21:10] man i counted i sat down with across
[2:21:12] from the table doing my taxes
[2:21:15] he said i
[2:21:16] i don't believe in hell i said well
[2:21:19] sorry but there is one well he said i
[2:21:21] just can't believe a loving father
[2:21:24] would send any of his children to hell i
[2:21:26] said i can't either
[2:21:30] i said there won't be one of his
[2:21:31] children in hell
[2:21:34] i said hell never was made for us
[2:21:39] heaven was made for us
[2:21:42] i go to prepare a place for you
[2:21:44] and i'll come again
[2:21:47] and i'll receive you to myself
[2:21:50] but in order for you to be ready you've
[2:21:52] got to have some firepower
[2:21:55] even beyond what you've worked down to
[2:21:57] the ages
[2:21:58] even what you've seen beyond this
[2:22:01] it'll be an outpouring of the holy ghost
[2:22:05] a sound from heaven
[2:22:07] pouring out the holy ghost
[2:22:10] the dynamics of this church will be a
[2:22:12] refilling
[2:22:13] of the holy ghost don't you want that
[2:22:16] refilling
[2:22:17] don't you say lord i
[2:22:19] i've experienced you but i just want
[2:22:21] more of you
[2:22:23] i just want more of you than what i've
[2:22:25] ever known lord i want to experience you
[2:22:27] in a greater way
[2:22:29] don't leave me where i am
[2:22:32] i don't want to stay here
[2:22:34] draw me nearer to you god
[2:22:37] speak to me
[2:22:39] take me higher
[2:22:41] purge me whatever you got to do
[2:22:44] even take the dearest thing to me
[2:22:47] whatever it takes lord
[2:22:50] whatever i've got to do
[2:22:53] to press the last mile
[2:22:58] to press the last mile
[2:23:02] i'm not going to walk alone
[2:23:05] because he said i'll be your comfortest
[2:23:08] i'll come to you
[2:23:10] i'll be with you
[2:23:12] i'll be even in you
[2:23:13] to the end of the world
[2:23:17] would you let him in today
[2:23:20] you see it takes a complete
[2:23:22] surrender
[2:23:24] so i don't even know how to surrender
[2:23:26] brother tim
[2:23:29] i don't know i don't know how to do what
[2:23:31] you said well you see
[2:23:34] in the door of the heart
[2:23:37] people want to open it and say well just
[2:23:39] save me from hell
[2:23:42] but there's other little doors the door
[2:23:44] pried
[2:23:47] selfishness
[2:23:49] temper
[2:23:52] i don't know what all the doors are in
[2:23:54] your house but jesus got to have access
[2:23:56] to every one of them
[2:23:59] he won't be welcome
[2:24:01] with one door closed
[2:24:05] you see why his relationship to you is
[2:24:07] like a husband to a wife
[2:24:11] she cannot hold back
[2:24:13] anything
[2:24:19] so ask him lord
[2:24:22] please don't just stand there at the
[2:24:23] door of my heart
[2:24:26] some of me is just on the outside some
[2:24:28] maybe let him in just a little bit
[2:24:31] won't you let him in all the way
[2:24:35] make a full surrender
[2:24:38] the more that you'll surrender
[2:24:40] the more he'll take control
[2:24:43] father take the words that we spoke
[2:24:44] today
[2:24:46] let them find a resting place in the
[2:24:48] hearts of your children
[2:24:51] deal with every heart lord according to
[2:24:53] the need there
[2:24:57] speak to them
[2:24:59] reveal yourself i ask
[2:25:01] in jesus name
[2:25:03] take all our sins away lord
[2:25:05] forgive us of our shortcomings
[2:25:08] if we stood in the presence of the
[2:25:10] almighty god
[2:25:13] where angels
[2:25:15] looked dirty in his presence
[2:25:18] then surely lord
[2:25:21] i could not come in your presence
[2:25:24] without an intercessor
[2:25:28] i could not come in your presence
[2:25:31] without the man christ jesus
[2:25:34] paying the debt that i owed
[2:25:39] who not only saves me
[2:25:41] but keeps me from sin
[2:25:43] i pray lord you'll do it father cover us
[2:25:45] today
