[1:01:30] those that are have come this morning
[1:01:32] and being here in the service today if
[1:01:36] you're a visitor I hope you won't feel
[1:01:37] like a visitor when it's all over but
[1:01:40] you'll just feel like a part of the
[1:01:42] family of God and so we welcome you
[1:01:44] today you hadn't been here in a while
[1:01:46] well we're just happy to have you today
[1:01:48] and in the service the Lord if it's your
[1:01:51] first time isn't it well we're glad to
[1:01:53] have you amen it's always good that we
[1:01:55] can have the Gathering of God's people
[1:01:58] to come together together to Worship the
[1:02:01] Lord together with us I also wanted to
[1:02:04] say I really appreciated brother Joshua
[1:02:07] Martin coming and taking us two of the
[1:02:09] services while we were away he's a
[1:02:12] talented and gifted young man and from
[1:02:15] what I witnessed and the report said I
[1:02:17] received I he did an outstanding job and
[1:02:20] you were blessed last and we're so happy
[1:02:23] about that that is wonderful and brother
[1:02:25] Aaron Oglesby as I mentioned in prayer
[1:02:28] him in the Burns family they're up in
[1:02:30] the North Carolina and he's preaching
[1:02:32] for brother brother Aaron is preaching
[1:02:35] for uh brother Josh Bennett and also
[1:02:39] brother Joe greenes this evening so you
[1:02:43] can remember them in prayer they'll be
[1:02:44] traveling back home and we certainly are
[1:02:49] thankful that God can use them in a very
[1:02:51] very special way and I believe that and
[1:02:55] also as us coming in I just noticed that
[1:02:58] we've got a lot of work that has been
[1:03:00] done and I I don't know if you pass by
[1:03:03] the back of the church there and got to
[1:03:06] look there but we got a first class
[1:03:07] beautiful handrails going down the steps
[1:03:10] out of the out of the fellowship hall to
[1:03:13] go down into the Pavilion there and it
[1:03:18] just it's just classy that's all you can
[1:03:21] say about it it's a job well done we
[1:03:24] certainly appreciate all of you that
[1:03:26] were involved in there also I got him a
[1:03:29] real little job to do also I bought them
[1:03:31] a little that not them I bought the
[1:03:34] children a little teeter-totter thing to
[1:03:37] add the mummies Park out there and and
[1:03:39] it had to be assembled and that can be a
[1:03:42] brain scrambler in itself but they got
[1:03:45] it done and the children already been
[1:03:47] enjoying it and and so we really
[1:03:49] appreciate that and then we see the the
[1:03:52] post up for the adult porch swings and
[1:03:54] the fire pit that we're putting out
[1:03:56] there I just want to say I appreciate
[1:03:58] everything you've done I just want to
[1:04:01] say you're the best you are the best and
[1:04:05] I'm I'm so proud of you as a
[1:04:07] congregation and love you with with all
[1:04:11] of my heart today
[1:04:12] also
[1:04:14] um I'm um I'm just um I want to read a
[1:04:19] scripture here
[1:04:21] um for a moment and uh just um just to
[1:04:24] kind of set the the tone for this it's
[1:04:26] in first Timothy three and eight and you
[1:04:30] won't have to put it on the board up
[1:04:32] there but I just want to just kind of
[1:04:35] bring it to your memory and this is
[1:04:37] about the qualifications of deacons
[1:04:40] deacons are to be worthy of respect and
[1:04:43] sincere not an indulgent in most much
[1:04:45] wine not pursuing dishonest gain it must
[1:04:48] hold the Deep truths of the Faith with a
[1:04:51] clear conscience they must first be
[1:04:53] tested and then there's nothing against
[1:04:55] them they shall serve as deacons same
[1:04:58] way their wives are to be worthy of
[1:05:01] respect not malicious talkers but
[1:05:03] temperate and trustworthy and everything
[1:05:05] and a deacon must be faithful to his
[1:05:09] wife and manage his children his
[1:05:11] household well and those who have served
[1:05:14] well gained an excellent standing and
[1:05:18] great Assurance in their faith in Christ
[1:05:21] Jesus and these are the words that the
[1:05:24] Apostle Paul left us for
[1:05:27] um the church and for the order of the
[1:05:30] church and certainly we have carried on
[1:05:33] that even as brother Branham did and and
[1:05:35] most Christian churches do something
[1:05:38] very similar but um we're certainly
[1:05:40] following the example of the prophet of
[1:05:42] God and the Apostle Paul and
[1:05:46] um and so today we uh because we are
[1:05:50] having the meeting coming up and we're
[1:05:52] going to need some more help and
[1:05:55] um we and so on like that I'm I'm going
[1:05:59] to
[1:06:00] um today
[1:06:02] nominate a brother here and I would like
[1:06:05] brother Derek Paris to stand if you
[1:06:08] would so everybody would know who that
[1:06:11] he is who we're talking about he's been
[1:06:13] with us over a year now and we've come
[1:06:17] you've had a chance to get to know him
[1:06:19] and his family and and I already say
[1:06:22] they've been a great asset to our church
[1:06:24] and um but because we are in need of
[1:06:28] another Deacon with the upcoming meeting
[1:06:29] I've nominated him and he's willing to
[1:06:32] serve and at our next business meeting
[1:06:35] we will do this again in a more formal
[1:06:37] manner but for now I'm just going to ask
[1:06:40] him to now be seated and
[1:06:43] um just about his head and that you will
[1:06:46] with the cameras make sure you just have
[1:06:47] them directly upon me and um and so with
[1:06:52] um with that consideration and
[1:06:55] denomination that I made I'm asking you
[1:06:58] for a vote uh with a show of hams and
[1:07:02] that if you are a member of the church
[1:07:06] here and um you support it with your
[1:07:09] tithe and offerings to con to confirm
[1:07:12] his
[1:07:13] um his nomination today so if you would
[1:07:16] just raise your hand let me see all
[1:07:19] right all right so I'm seeing a great
[1:07:21] majority here today so brother Derek if
[1:07:24] you will if you'll just come stand right

[1:11:11] turn with me to Genesis Chapter 18 and
[1:11:13] we'll read from verse 1.
[1:11:16] if you were not tuned in with us in um
[1:11:20] in Virginia you have missed a part 167.
[1:11:25] and um where I spoke on investigating
[1:11:28] angels
[1:11:30] and so if you have not heard that well
[1:11:33] you know if you want to stay up with
[1:11:34] what we're doing and what we're
[1:11:36] ministering will it be good that you
[1:11:38] would do that we were really blessed in
[1:11:40] in the services there it was powerful
[1:11:43] meetings brother Timothy did you proud
[1:11:45] and brother Donnie Reagan of course
[1:11:47] blessed us in such a waste Sunday
[1:11:50] morning we were really tremendously
[1:11:52] blessed by his ministry and and of
[1:11:55] course we all love brother Ron Spencer
[1:11:57] and they gave they were wonderful hosts
[1:12:00] and and we had a wonderful time together
[1:12:03] and um so let's look here to Genesis
[1:12:06] Chapter 18 and we'll read from verse 1
[1:12:10] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[1:12:12] plains of memory and he sat in the tent
[1:12:15] Door In the Heat of the day and he lift
[1:12:18] up his eyes and low and looked in low
[1:12:20] three men stood by him and when he saw
[1:12:23] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[1:12:26] door and bowed himself toward the ground
[1:12:28] and said my Lord if now I have found
[1:12:31] favor in thy sight pass not away I pray
[1:12:34] thee from thy servant may God bless you
[1:12:37] as you're seated
[1:12:42] I have been talking about this being
[1:12:45] the climax of the meetings
[1:12:48] where that
[1:12:50] God had appeared unto Abraham
[1:12:54] and so today I I want to just take it a
[1:12:58] little further here today as we look at
[1:13:01] this and the title is going to be a
[1:13:04] little bit strange but it also has to do
[1:13:07] with our trip that we've made and the
[1:13:10] events that I witnessed and saw and I'm
[1:13:13] going to speak on taking The High Ground
[1:13:15] for the Ascension
[1:13:17] now of course The High Ground meaning
[1:13:20] coming to the climax
[1:13:22] and this is where that Abraham and Sarah
[1:13:25] would come to this uh such a climax
[1:13:29] meeting and um to them would be a
[1:13:32] revelation of
[1:13:34] um from Jehovah directly to them Elohim
[1:13:38] would reveal himself under the oak tree
[1:13:41] at mam at mammary and there in that in
[1:13:45] that great meeting would be the climatic
[1:13:49] time just before the change of their
[1:13:52] bodies in order to receive the promised
[1:13:54] son
[1:13:55] and as we kind of go through this you
[1:13:59] know as I as you know I've just returned
[1:14:01] from up in uh Virginia after the
[1:14:05] meetings we also went into Pennsylvania
[1:14:07] and
[1:14:09] um and to Maryland Pennsylvania and on
[1:14:11] up there we toured the battlefields of
[1:14:14] uh Antietam and and Gettysburg and of
[1:14:18] course
[1:14:19] um you really missed out on a treat we
[1:14:21] had our own personal tour guide brother
[1:14:23] Aaron ogles made that and that took us
[1:14:26] through every step of it and just
[1:14:28] explained to us so beautifully and and
[1:14:32] it was very very inspiring that we had
[1:14:35] those moments together
[1:14:37] and um as you know the battle at
[1:14:39] Antietam was fought on September 17th in
[1:14:42] 1862 as the bloodiest day in American
[1:14:46] history with a combined total of 22 717
[1:14:51] dead
[1:14:53] and wounded are missing and um and
[1:14:57] although the Union Army suffered heavier
[1:14:59] casualties than the Confederates the
[1:15:02] battle was a major turning point in the
[1:15:05] Union's favor
[1:15:06] and so we were able to go there and look
[1:15:09] at that as you know today is September
[1:15:12] the 11th it marks
[1:15:14] um now the great tragedy that happened
[1:15:16] with the twin towers and and the attack
[1:15:19] upon America and many are still today
[1:15:23] mourning that then uh as to that was a a
[1:15:28] great event here in American history now
[1:15:31] and um but you know of um of all of
[1:15:35] these that were were dead and wounded in
[1:15:38] the Civil War America is never lost that
[1:15:42] many men in any battles since that time
[1:15:46] in July the 1st through the 3rd 1863
[1:15:49] there was the Battle of Gettysburg in
[1:15:52] history records now the mistakes of the
[1:15:55] battles and there's always the what ifs
[1:15:59] and the how comes
[1:16:01] and you know let me tell you now as we
[1:16:05] stand here today the threat of civil war
[1:16:08] is not over
[1:16:10] there will be another one
[1:16:13] and it will be between the liberal left
[1:16:15] and the conservative right
[1:16:17] you see well I know what side I'm on
[1:16:20] well I can tell you right now it's not
[1:16:23] going to end well
[1:16:25] for the conservative right
[1:16:27] even now Christian people are being
[1:16:29] castigated
[1:16:31] they are being called deplorables they
[1:16:34] are demonized by the U.S president as a
[1:16:37] threat to democracy they are angry as
[1:16:41] they insist on their freedoms freedoms
[1:16:44] to kill babies by their own children by
[1:16:47] abortions freedom for same-sex marriage
[1:16:51] freedom to practice sodomy freedom for
[1:16:55] porn freedom to commit crimes and not
[1:16:58] face any penalties
[1:17:00] freedom to flood our nations with
[1:17:02] immigrants and the absolute Spirit of
[1:17:05] lawlessness as freedom from religion
[1:17:09] anti-god and Antichrist
[1:17:12] and America's heart has turned evil as
[1:17:15] he speaks as a dragon instead of a lamb
[1:17:19] this is happens and by prophecy
[1:17:22] according to revelation 13.
[1:17:24] and and like I said it's it's not going
[1:17:27] to end well for the righteous people
[1:17:30] the Bible said in Revelation 12 17 and
[1:17:33] the dragon was wroth with the woman and
[1:17:35] went to make war with the remnant of her
[1:17:37] seed which keep the Commandments of God
[1:17:39] and have the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:17:43] and we know that day there will be a
[1:17:45] great Slaughter and and those that will
[1:17:49] give their lives during that time they
[1:17:51] will they will sleep until the
[1:17:53] Millennium is over and it's a white
[1:17:54] Throne judgment there will catch up with
[1:17:57] the rest of us entered into life with
[1:18:00] the bride in the holy city and the rest
[1:18:02] of them
[1:18:03] um there
[1:18:05] um on the on the outside of the city in
[1:18:08] the the new heavens and the new Earth
[1:18:11] but there's another battle that happens
[1:18:14] before this one that I want to talk
[1:18:17] about
[1:18:18] and it's the Battle For The High Ground
[1:18:20] of Ascension
[1:18:22] the dead in Christ are waiting to be
[1:18:25] freed and glorified they're in a Holden
[1:18:28] place
[1:18:30] and we must reach the height
[1:18:32] a promise for those who are alive and
[1:18:34] remain to be changed in a moment in a
[1:18:38] twinkling of an eye
[1:18:40] and here today every gun of hell has
[1:18:43] fortified itself upon this hill
[1:18:47] take in this position to make sure we do
[1:18:50] not achieve The High Ground where Jesus
[1:18:53] Christ will be the captain off of his
[1:18:55] bride
[1:18:56] in this Bible we have ADD Christian men
[1:19:00] in their armies we've had them in the
[1:19:03] past we've had the Baptists that made
[1:19:05] its heroic advancement to a immersion
[1:19:09] and then that position denied infant
[1:19:12] baptism
[1:19:14] uh and and they were for this reason
[1:19:16] they were called anabaptists or
[1:19:19] re-baptizers
[1:19:20] and even took on the name many of them
[1:19:23] took on the name of dunkers you know it
[1:19:25] was a slang term referring to them
[1:19:28] people that that would not receive the
[1:19:31] Catholic
[1:19:32] um baptism of infants but insisted that
[1:19:36] uh it be when a person come to know
[1:19:38] Jesus Christ and made that conscious
[1:19:40] decision uh to accept him as Lord and
[1:19:44] Savior it would be them that they would
[1:19:45] be only then could it be baptized and
[1:19:49] and so from there were the battle
[1:19:51] divisions of of men like the Amish and
[1:19:55] the Mennonites and the Hutterites out of
[1:19:57] these anabaptists that men who battled
[1:20:01] for freedom of religion that's why they
[1:20:03] came here to America even because in the
[1:20:07] other countries they had been hunted
[1:20:09] down and and persecuted and slaughtered
[1:20:12] they have many many Heroes among them of
[1:20:15] men and women who died valiantly for the
[1:20:19] cause of the truth that they had failed
[1:20:21] and they but but they were hunted down
[1:20:25] and persecuted and slaughtered and
[1:20:28] battled but only to retreat to just
[1:20:32] become enslaved to a set cut off from
[1:20:37] The High Ground of the Ascension and the
[1:20:39] Rapture of the church
[1:20:41] And Then There came the Great Awakening
[1:20:44] it was a serious series of Christian
[1:20:47] revivals that swept Britain and the 13
[1:20:50] North American colonies in the 1730s and
[1:20:53] 40s that was the first Great Awakening
[1:20:57] and it was led by Heroes of Faith famous
[1:21:01] generals like Jonathan Edwards and John
[1:21:05] Wesley and George Whitefield who led the
[1:21:09] troops forward to to Proclaim God in
[1:21:12] their generation and they charged that
[1:21:15] Hill
[1:21:17] and and you know in many of these cases
[1:21:20] these men seemed like with almost taken
[1:21:23] only to be driven back
[1:21:26] only to to be defeated and and lose the
[1:21:30] battle
[1:21:31] and these mountains well you know would
[1:21:34] be would be men who fought for Holiness
[1:21:36] a Sanctified life and that would climb
[1:21:40] that hill and try to fight for the
[1:21:42] position for the Ascension and they were
[1:21:45] in that that first Great Awakening they
[1:21:48] would they would get new recruits and
[1:21:50] fresh troops from the Second Great
[1:21:53] Awakening and Generals like Charles
[1:21:56] Finney and and Dwight Moody and and the
[1:21:59] ones like that would push up Ascension
[1:22:02] heal only to be pushed back and Retreat
[1:22:06] to an encampment of enslaved men
[1:22:10] and today the Methodist Church for
[1:22:13] example the Sanctified church is
[1:22:15] anything but sanctified
[1:22:17] Holiness is gone
[1:22:20] righteousness has been destroyed and
[1:22:23] then there they are imprisoned and
[1:22:25] Powerless and enslaved and totally
[1:22:28] conquered why because they were coming
[1:22:30] up they'll sits and heal and they fell
[1:22:33] back under the attack of the enemy
[1:22:36] this is what brother Branham said about
[1:22:38] him and how can I overcome and he speaks
[1:22:41] about our age he said this is the age of
[1:22:44] Life the personal life of Christ where
[1:22:47] the chemical in his body what was in him
[1:22:49] first under justification the water
[1:22:51] baptism second under the the new birth
[1:22:55] of Wesley sanctification which cleanses
[1:22:57] and thirdly under the baptism of the
[1:23:00] Holy Spirit putting that Sanctified
[1:23:02] vessel into service and the word
[1:23:05] sanctify means a is a compound Greek
[1:23:08] word which means cleaned and set aside
[1:23:10] for service and now the Holy Spirit puts
[1:23:13] it in service and we'll notice when the
[1:23:16] unclean spirit is gone from a man he
[1:23:19] walks in dry places I want you to
[1:23:21] understand they got a deliverance and
[1:23:24] they would give a temporary victory but
[1:23:27] only to be pushed back into unbelief
[1:23:30] again
[1:23:31] and so he said that's exactly what the
[1:23:34] church has done when the unclean Spirit
[1:23:36] has gone from a man walks in God places
[1:23:38] exactly what the church has done
[1:23:40] Baptists and methodists who believed in
[1:23:43] sanctification and then Jesus said the
[1:23:46] unclean spirit that went out of him
[1:23:48] returns to this church body and founds a
[1:23:51] house garnished swept clean living Pure
[1:23:55] Clean lives all right but then if that
[1:23:58] house isn't filled
[1:24:00] if it isn't occupied then it comes with
[1:24:03] seven other Devils evil demons worse
[1:24:07] than he was and the last AIDS of this
[1:24:09] place is seven times worse than it was
[1:24:13] in the first place they would have been
[1:24:15] better to say to Luther
[1:24:17] that it would be to receive the light
[1:24:19] and fail to follow it so will it be with
[1:24:22] the Pentecostals you know what I mean
[1:24:24] the house is garnish as I was talking to
[1:24:27] someone the other days said they're
[1:24:29] careful they're very careful even many
[1:24:32] of the Holiness groups not to call the
[1:24:35] Holy Ghost Holy Ghost because they
[1:24:38] identify themselves with Pentecostals
[1:24:41] when they do that they say holy spirit
[1:24:43] and to see to keep from saying Holy
[1:24:46] Ghost because the Pentecostal common
[1:24:48] people just call it what the Bible says
[1:24:51] holy ghost which is the Holy Spirit and
[1:24:54] Holy Ghost is the same thing but they're
[1:24:55] very careful about it they don't want to
[1:24:58] be identified with him tongue-speaking
[1:25:01] people and that's the Holy Spirit itself
[1:25:04] see what happened then when the enemy
[1:25:07] that went out under sanctification that
[1:25:09] was washed out returned back and found
[1:25:12] the house not filled with the spirit
[1:25:15] and and with the Holy Spirit now the
[1:25:18] state of the church is joined in the
[1:25:21] league of churches with the World
[1:25:22] Council of churches and it's a state
[1:25:25] that now connects it with several Roman
[1:25:27] Catholic Catholicism in all the uh the
[1:25:31] rest of it and now it's seven times
[1:25:33] worse than it was when it come out of
[1:25:35] the Lutheranism that's where it takes
[1:25:37] the man and then look at the laodicean
[1:25:40] church age
[1:25:41] after it received the Holy Ghost with
[1:25:44] the knowledge of the Holy Spirit of the
[1:25:46] spirit of God within it and then the
[1:25:48] works of God is denied by that and
[1:25:50] called an evil work then what about that
[1:25:53] there's what Christ has put out of his
[1:25:55] own church see it never showed him in
[1:25:58] the church until he come to laodicea and
[1:26:00] then he got the laodicea and he'd been
[1:26:03] put out of his church and was trying to
[1:26:05] get back in see justification never put
[1:26:08] him in sanctification just cleaned the
[1:26:11] place for him but when the baptism of
[1:26:13] the Holy Spirit came it put him in the
[1:26:16] people and now they turned him out and
[1:26:19] when he began to show himself that he's
[1:26:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:26:24] they turned him out because they have
[1:26:27] denominated and the spirit of the Lord
[1:26:29] don't agree with denomination you
[1:26:32] understand now they put him out we don't
[1:26:34] want nothing to do with his telepathy it
[1:26:37] said the devil or it's fortune teller
[1:26:39] they don't understand eyes can't see see
[1:26:42] ears can't hear and God only opens eyes
[1:26:46] as he Wills he hardens those who you
[1:26:48] hardens he wishes to and gives life to
[1:26:51] those he desires to that's what the
[1:26:54] scripture says now we see these hours
[1:26:56] that we're in the states and we see what
[1:26:59] it is and the Holy Ghost rebuking the
[1:27:02] age that put him out but in all that did
[1:27:04] you notice to him that overcometh
[1:27:09] amen even in that worldly Wicked Church
[1:27:13] age him that overcometh
[1:27:16] we find that God has always had
[1:27:19] Overcomers he's had Overcomers in every
[1:27:22] age they're always every time and every
[1:27:25] age that has been on the earth God has
[1:27:27] always had somebody that he can put his
[1:27:30] hands on as a witness in the earth he's
[1:27:34] never been without a witness though
[1:27:37] sometimes just one but somebody overcome
[1:27:41] now just like the Saints of old
[1:27:44] Hallelujah aren't you glad it says out
[1:27:46] to him that overcometh he couldn't say
[1:27:49] that unless there's somebody going to
[1:27:51] overcome
[1:27:52] amen so he's already prophesied
[1:27:55] somebody's going to overcome in the most
[1:27:58] evil age that's ever been
[1:28:01] somebody's going to be successful to get
[1:28:05] up of sense and heal
[1:28:07] and there will be a Rapture and a
[1:28:10] resurrection
[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:14] we must take The High Ground
[1:28:17] at Gettysburg that was what is called
[1:28:19] the high water mark
[1:28:21] it's a hill that does not took refuge on
[1:28:24] and resisted the rebel charge
[1:28:28] and this was the closest that the South
[1:28:31] it came to went into war from there that
[1:28:34] would win some battles but like water
[1:28:36] they would recede to defeat
[1:28:39] they came so close to winning for the
[1:28:42] first two days the battles they did win
[1:28:44] but the third day after several times
[1:28:47] have almost winning they were defeated
[1:28:48] at the Battle of Gettysburg
[1:28:51] I stood upon that Hill I wept I did not
[1:28:55] weep because the the South lost
[1:28:59] because I too wanted to just cause for
[1:29:03] all men to be treated equal and verse
[1:29:06] slavery to end
[1:29:08] but I wept because I know that we as a
[1:29:12] bride of Christ are coming so close
[1:29:16] to women
[1:29:18] and every demon of every kind has
[1:29:21] gathered on the Hill from where we are
[1:29:24] to ascend from
[1:29:26] and we cannot just make the high water
[1:29:29] mark
[1:29:30] and recede back and lose the war
[1:29:34] but we must take the hill
[1:29:38] we must not just make it to the hill and
[1:29:41] fall back but we must ascend
[1:29:44] amen our families are dependent upon it
[1:29:48] the dead in Christ are dependent on it
[1:29:51] Heaven awaits and Earth must recede
[1:29:58] Hallelujah
[1:29:59] The High Ground
[1:30:01] that we must take
[1:30:03] is the top of the pyramid
[1:30:09] brother Adams told us in their message
[1:30:12] adoption let me just read this to you he
[1:30:16] said now this may choke you to death
[1:30:18] but you know that men that are sons of
[1:30:21] God are amateur gods
[1:30:23] how many ever knew that how many knows
[1:30:26] Jesus said so the Bible said did not
[1:30:28] your law say that you're gods and if you
[1:30:30] call them Gods which Genesis 2 said they
[1:30:33] were Gods because they had full domain
[1:30:35] over the Dominion of the world and he
[1:30:37] gave his dominion over all things he
[1:30:39] lost his godship he lost his sonship he
[1:30:42] lost his dominion and Satan took it over
[1:30:44] and that's where we've been for the six
[1:30:47] left past six thousand years
[1:30:49] but then he said but Brothers we are
[1:30:52] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:30:55] sons of God who will come back and take
[1:30:58] it over again waiting for the fullness
[1:31:01] of time when the pyramid gets up to the
[1:31:04] top when full sons of God will be
[1:31:06] manifested when the power of God will
[1:31:09] walk out Hallelujah and take every Power
[1:31:13] the Satan's got away from him yes sir it
[1:31:16] belongs to him
[1:31:19] brother Branham uses a pyramid
[1:31:22] as an illustration
[1:31:24] and it built the Pyramid
[1:31:27] and it is today without a Capstone
[1:31:31] it is a sign
[1:31:33] a Bible to fear of future Generations in
[1:31:36] fact brother Brandon would call it the
[1:31:38] second Bible
[1:31:40] and he said you know it's a Bible to the
[1:31:44] future generation that one day
[1:31:47] the Capstone will come
[1:31:51] Enoch called it the place of Ascension
[1:31:55] that's what pyramid is what's to mean
[1:31:57] the place of Ascension
[1:32:01] and the Egyptians built replicas and
[1:32:04] made it the place of the Dead
[1:32:07] and this is what has happened instead of
[1:32:10] denominations building onto the
[1:32:12] Ascension they have become graveyards
[1:32:16] and places for the Dead
[1:32:21] it was a pyramid that was have been
[1:32:23] capped off
[1:32:24] and to be complete and he used he showed
[1:32:28] this to use and and he would use this
[1:32:30] type of a pyramid to to
[1:32:33] um to show three separate things
[1:32:37] separate distinct things that was
[1:32:40] necessary to be kept or completed we're
[1:32:44] going to talk about some of those today
[1:32:47] first of all you as the individual the
[1:32:50] believer must be kept off
[1:32:52] with by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:56] that unites you and God together
[1:32:59] justification and believing on the Lord
[1:33:01] is only the first stage
[1:33:04] of the battle for the soul but you see
[1:33:08] sanctification then will cleanse and
[1:33:11] clear the devil out
[1:33:13] but to keep him from regaining the song
[1:33:17] the Holy Spirit must come and forever
[1:33:20] seal and forever seal the individual
[1:33:24] with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:28] sealing Satan out and sealing you in
[1:33:31] with God
[1:33:33] amen where you're sealed into the day of
[1:33:36] redemption
[1:33:37] it is then dwelling spirit of God it's
[1:33:40] more than just a Azusa Street anointing
[1:33:44] on the spirit on the human Spirit where
[1:33:46] you get excited and dance or shout or
[1:33:49] jump or have emotion but it's the
[1:33:52] indwelling spirit of God the literal
[1:33:55] life of Jesus Christ it is the token it
[1:33:58] is your ticket for the Rapture and
[1:34:00] without it you can't go
[1:34:03] you'll be left behind defeated
[1:34:10] if you're climbing that Hill today you
[1:34:13] must reach the top
[1:34:17] to fall short of that is defeat
[1:34:22] to fall short of that means that you're
[1:34:25] Sanctified like brother Madam spoke of
[1:34:27] the church there the Nazarene church and
[1:34:29] the different ones that were ashamed to
[1:34:32] be identified with those tongue-speaking
[1:34:34] people
[1:34:35] shame that the Holy Ghost to be
[1:34:37] identified with that means that you're
[1:34:40] open
[1:34:42] forever enemy to conquer you
[1:34:46] things that you once conquered to come
[1:34:48] back again
[1:34:50] to be worse than what you were to begin
[1:34:53] with
[1:34:55] are you with me how many have you seen
[1:34:57] that come to the point of sanctification
[1:35:00] maybe they quit the drink and they're
[1:35:02] smoking their pornography or adultery or
[1:35:05] this or that the only and only to go
[1:35:08] right back in the same thing again
[1:35:11] be defeated and bring an awful shame and
[1:35:15] defeat to the body of Christ that they
[1:35:18] belong to the church the local body
[1:35:20] how many times have we have seen that
[1:35:22] along the journey because man stopped
[1:35:25] stop somewhere
[1:35:28] in their Ascension
[1:35:30] for the Holy Ghost
[1:35:33] I didn't get capped
[1:35:36] they let something keep them back hold
[1:35:40] them back and I want to tell you to be
[1:35:42] held back to stay where you are is
[1:35:44] defeat
[1:35:47] you must advise if you have not received
[1:35:51] the indwelling spirit of God and been
[1:35:53] capped off with the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:55] Ghost that seals you and God together
[1:35:57] you will wind up in defeat the only way
[1:36:01] you can be a conqueror is to climb that
[1:36:04] Hill
[1:36:05] you begin with your faith that's a good
[1:36:08] place to start you add to your faith
[1:36:10] virtual knowledge separate faces and all
[1:36:12] of that but let me tell you God wants to
[1:36:15] take you all the way where that you
[1:36:17] achieve the greatest achievement that a
[1:36:20] human being can have and that is forgot
[1:36:23] to come down and dwell on the inside
[1:36:30] so you are a pyramid that must be kept
[1:36:34] The Headstone must come
[1:36:38] it is great to start
[1:36:40] with a Cornerstone of Faith but you must
[1:36:43] be sealed to the day of redemption
[1:36:46] number two the mysteries of the word of
[1:36:49] God must be finished or kept
[1:36:53] it spoke of this in Revelation 10 7.
[1:36:56] that in the days of the voice of the
[1:36:58] seventh angel when he begin to sound the
[1:37:01] mystery of God but be kept finished
[1:37:06] so you see it would be it would be
[1:37:09] capped by seven Thunders and this would
[1:37:12] restore the church back to its original
[1:37:15] condition by restoring the pure gospel
[1:37:18] that Paul preached
[1:37:21] and I just want to say to you it's
[1:37:23] something that we must we must hold on
[1:37:26] to and possess
[1:37:28] because it has been kept there's not
[1:37:30] another Revelation coming
[1:37:32] the Mysteries have been revealed the
[1:37:36] rapturing faith the faith the Revelation
[1:37:39] for the Rapture has already come it
[1:37:42] won't come by somebody else God sent it
[1:37:45] by his seventh angel to bring a message
[1:37:48] in this last day to cap off and finish
[1:37:51] the mystery ever mystery needed for the
[1:37:55] Gentile bride has already been revealed
[1:38:00] and I just say don't go beyond it
[1:38:04] don't try to go beyond it
[1:38:07] don't leave it
[1:38:09] don't embellish it
[1:38:11] to do that is to retreat from that
[1:38:13] position hold that position
[1:38:19] it must be held
[1:38:22] now
[1:38:24] the third one of course for God will cap
[1:38:26] off the church
[1:38:28] he will cap it off with the literal
[1:38:30] coming of Jesus Christ
[1:38:34] but let's talk about this one for a
[1:38:35] moment I'm just gonna
[1:38:37] take just a moment on this one a little
[1:38:40] longer than I did on the one before
[1:38:42] because we preached much about the
[1:38:45] necessity for the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:47] Ghost
[1:38:49] but I want to bring it to you where
[1:38:51] brother Branham spoke about this and and
[1:38:55] um and and he he tells us the seventh
[1:38:58] Church AIDS messenger was to restore the
[1:39:01] faith of the children back to the
[1:39:03] fathers again
[1:39:04] in other words rebuild the church back
[1:39:07] to the power of the spirit not by might
[1:39:10] nor by my men's might or my men's power
[1:39:14] but by my spirit not by organization he
[1:39:17] said not by denomination but by the Holy
[1:39:20] Spirit God will bring forth the church
[1:39:24] in the last days
[1:39:26] so you see it's a work of the holy
[1:39:29] spirit that where he caps off the
[1:39:31] Mysteries the mystery truths in this
[1:39:35] last day to give you a complete word and
[1:39:39] an open book
[1:39:42] where that nothing is close to you as a
[1:39:45] believer
[1:39:46] that every truth of God's word has been
[1:39:49] revealed all the way from this from in
[1:39:52] the beginning God to even this even so
[1:39:55] come Lord Jesus in The Book of
[1:39:57] Revelation every truth has been revealed
[1:40:00] it do we need no further truth we have
[1:40:04] ascended that hill we must hold on to it
[1:40:08] it is from there God will take a people
[1:40:11] in a rapture
[1:40:13] amen don't back up from it don't back
[1:40:16] away from it but stand there on it now
[1:40:19] brother Branham in in October of 62
[1:40:22] would have a vision and then a vision he
[1:40:25] would he would first just write it later
[1:40:27] he would tell about it but Billy Paul
[1:40:29] would type it out there
[1:40:31] um after after uh brother Branham had
[1:40:34] this Vision he asked him to type it out
[1:40:36] for him and I'm just going to refer to
[1:40:38] some of the highlights of it but he was
[1:40:41] preaching in a forest Cathedral
[1:40:45] and he was preaching to a mammoth
[1:40:48] congregation
[1:40:49] and as he was preaching he noticed he
[1:40:52] was standing in the Sun
[1:40:54] or the full light of God's word was
[1:40:58] shining upon him
[1:41:00] the light was now upon his ministry even
[1:41:04] as the light shines upon us today
[1:41:07] and there he was he was preaching to
[1:41:10] those who was sitting in the forest
[1:41:13] outside of the denominational system
[1:41:17] and this subject would have two climaxes
[1:41:21] and he was laying a background and it
[1:41:23] was getting laid and and it was a
[1:41:26] mammoth congregation as a sad the light
[1:41:29] shining through the trees and brother
[1:41:31] Brandon said it was hitting some some
[1:41:34] were still sitting in the shadows and
[1:41:36] that mount that some were getting it and
[1:41:39] some were not
[1:41:40] and people were getting tired of
[1:41:43] listening
[1:41:44] and we're physically hungry so they'd
[1:41:47] had enough of the spiritual and they
[1:41:49] started walking away and he demonstrates
[1:41:52] that they were yawning as they started
[1:41:54] walking away and and they kind of got
[1:41:57] bored with the with the word that was
[1:42:00] being preached let me tell you don't
[1:42:03] ever lose your first love
[1:42:06] don't never lose that desire and that
[1:42:09] passion for truth
[1:42:11] am I gonna seek you heard it enough
[1:42:14] you've listened long enough I've heard
[1:42:17] that tape before I've read that Bible
[1:42:19] verse before don't ever let it become
[1:42:22] common to you
[1:42:24] amen some were leaving and as they were
[1:42:26] leaving he screamed out don't leave for
[1:42:29] all these wonderful things that I have
[1:42:32] explained you you don't know where they
[1:42:35] come from and he grabbed his Bible and
[1:42:37] he screamed as he made this climax
[1:42:40] they're all found in the Bible
[1:42:43] and I'm commissioned to preach only the
[1:42:46] Bible
[1:42:47] but the congregation walked on
[1:42:53] now
[1:42:55] he was trying to give him the first
[1:42:56] climax
[1:42:57] and he was trying to tell them
[1:42:59] because they always want to know where
[1:43:01] gifts and visions and the power of God
[1:43:04] and all of that where it lay
[1:43:06] and he said they're in the word
[1:43:10] they're in the word of God they are thus
[1:43:12] saith the Lord there is promise and you
[1:43:15] you can all bear me witness my
[1:43:17] commission and stay with the word
[1:43:19] I can't go with the denominational
[1:43:21] system I can't I can't uh I can't feed
[1:43:26] your appetite although for those things
[1:43:29] I've got to give you the word gotta have
[1:43:31] somebody hungry for truth
[1:43:34] amen can't you understand the word he
[1:43:36] was he was screaming and preaching
[1:43:39] what's the matter with you you must
[1:43:41] understand it
[1:43:43] and I'm just going to say to you whether
[1:43:45] you're a young person whether you're old
[1:43:47] you're you know the word is not over
[1:43:50] your head it's not Beyond you the
[1:43:54] mysteries of God was given for you
[1:43:56] pursue them get interested in them know
[1:44:01] them know your Bible no the message
[1:44:05] comes from the Bible it's not a man's
[1:44:08] thinking it's the word of God and we
[1:44:10] find this root in his Source comes from
[1:44:13] the word of God as he said I was
[1:44:16] commissioned not to preach
[1:44:18] denominationalism I was commissioned to
[1:44:21] preach only the Bible
[1:44:27] so there as the people left
[1:44:29] he had reached a
[1:44:31] a climax of his Divine Healing meetings
[1:44:35] the people had grown tired and weary
[1:44:38] Revival fires were dying down
[1:44:41] his first climax was to get away from
[1:44:45] denominational thinking and come back to
[1:44:47] the word of God
[1:44:49] and and so as he did he said he set
[1:44:53] himself now listen he said in the world
[1:44:56] Fallen apart said look let's get back to
[1:44:58] the truth of the word God Lives alone
[1:45:01] God wants his people to live alone with
[1:45:05] him they I won't be tied in anything any
[1:45:09] Sensations tradition he wants the
[1:45:11] children obedient with his word he can
[1:45:14] place his word in that Jesus said if you
[1:45:17] abide in me and my words in you then ask
[1:45:20] what you will that's either the truth or
[1:45:23] it isn't the truth and if it's the truth
[1:45:25] it will work
[1:45:27] and I just want to say that to you if
[1:45:30] it's the truth to you it'll work
[1:45:34] amen if it's the truth to us there will
[1:45:37] be signs there will be wonders there
[1:45:40] will be Divine Healing there will be
[1:45:43] Miracles there will be genuine
[1:45:45] experiences and young people will be
[1:45:48] filled with the power of God and the old
[1:45:50] Delight
[1:45:52] amen but you see it all begins with the
[1:45:57] word
[1:46:01] so he goes on to say now you want to
[1:46:03] know where the secret lies the power of
[1:46:05] visions and things is back to the word
[1:46:08] it's the word of God Jesus was the word
[1:46:11] and he was a manifestation of the word
[1:46:13] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:46:16] himself and he was the word in the
[1:46:18] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:46:20] made flesh and the word wants to be made
[1:46:22] our flesh
[1:46:26] so the same scriptures that spoke of
[1:46:28] Jesus
[1:46:29] it wants to come in your flesh
[1:46:32] God's looking for believers today
[1:46:35] now so he thought you know they'll be
[1:46:37] back in the evening time and he began to
[1:46:40] plan he began to plan his second climax
[1:46:45] and he said ah you know the Shadows are
[1:46:47] going to fall and they're going to come
[1:46:49] back
[1:46:50] and when they return this congregation
[1:46:53] gathers in I'll put the climax to them
[1:46:55] and told them the things that they've
[1:46:58] seen me do is found in the word of God
[1:47:00] not in a mythical book or some
[1:47:03] organization but found in the word every
[1:47:05] minute because I'm commissioned for that
[1:47:08] and he said but for the most of the
[1:47:10] people it's been mythical to them or
[1:47:13] mystical to them most of them and and of
[1:47:16] course the first message when they saw
[1:47:19] it they were everybody rallied for it
[1:47:21] and Oh Glory to God if I could see this
[1:47:24] or that or the other and then they'd go
[1:47:26] away the same way that they came in
[1:47:29] how many even came across the platform
[1:47:32] were healed by the
[1:47:34] in the presence of the Angel only to go
[1:47:37] back and live the same old kind of life
[1:47:41] go right back to the systems and
[1:47:44] religions of men who denied the word
[1:47:48] but he said the Shadows are coming
[1:47:51] and then late December he would see
[1:47:54] after that Vision he would see another
[1:47:57] vision of seven angels coming to him and
[1:48:00] a vision
[1:48:01] and he said Oh I thought oh my it's
[1:48:03] coming with my message it's my second
[1:48:05] climax they're coming to bring me the
[1:48:08] message from the Lord and I screamed out
[1:48:10] with all my might as loud as I could oh
[1:48:14] Jesus what would you have me to do
[1:48:16] and when I did it went away from me
[1:48:20] and he said this climax it was yet to
[1:48:23] come he's standing there on the eve of
[1:48:25] the seals being opened and he says
[1:48:28] remember the second climax is yet to
[1:48:30] come there will be a message
[1:48:33] remember my message here the opening of
[1:48:35] that Capstone were the seven voices and
[1:48:38] seals is not even written in the word of
[1:48:40] God remember it took me into that
[1:48:42] pyramid
[1:48:44] as he said I went into that pyramid of
[1:48:47] seven angels and there he showed me
[1:48:50] things as you know
[1:48:52] neither tonight he would meet with an
[1:48:55] angel of God who would reveal to him the
[1:48:59] contents of that seal where that today
[1:49:02] we know who the White Horse right is the
[1:49:05] red the black the pale we know what it
[1:49:08] represented we know who the souls under
[1:49:11] the altar were we know we know that at
[1:49:14] the Great Tribulation that lays ahead
[1:49:16] and the seventh seal which is the
[1:49:19] breaking of the silence all of these
[1:49:22] things that we have been made privy to
[1:49:24] because you see he he was determined to
[1:49:29] reach that second climax it wasn't
[1:49:32] enough to get halfway up the hill he
[1:49:35] must reach the climax where that the
[1:49:38] original faith that was once delivered
[1:49:41] to the Saints could be restored back to
[1:49:44] the church again to where we can have
[1:49:47] the gospel that Paul preached untainted
[1:49:50] and uncolored by denominator nationalism
[1:49:53] who had colored it in so many ways until
[1:49:56] God was no longer one but three who had
[1:49:59] taken away the true baptism in the name
[1:50:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ and replaced it
[1:50:05] with titles who had taken of the
[1:50:08] original sin and make it an apple or
[1:50:11] some kind of fruit on the tree rather
[1:50:13] than rather than the the seed of The
[1:50:16] Serpent and what happened there in the
[1:50:18] garden are you with me
[1:50:20] amen you see that had to be opened to us
[1:50:25] so that we can come back to the original
[1:50:28] faith and this General this prophet of
[1:50:32] God he drove hard to get up that hill
[1:50:38] to restore us back to the original Faith
[1:50:41] again
[1:50:42] whether we have what Paul preached so he
[1:50:46] would say as he's looking to adult
[1:50:48] toward that I believe she's ready to
[1:50:51] strike that final climax to bring forth
[1:50:54] the faith that will Rapture the church
[1:50:56] into glory and she's laying in the
[1:50:58] messages where really at the end time we
[1:51:01] talked about it and and everything but
[1:51:04] the thing has moved up on us now and
[1:51:06] here's here it is
[1:51:08] now and indeed he had been laying of
[1:51:12] sermons and then he had been he had been
[1:51:15] moving toward this climax building up to
[1:51:18] it before then as you know he would
[1:51:21] preach on the seventh churches
[1:51:25] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:51:27] he would preach wisdom versus faith and
[1:51:30] and
[1:51:32] um spoken word is Original Seed and the
[1:51:35] seven with the 70 weeks of Daniel which
[1:51:37] would Place Israel's in their promises
[1:51:40] and and separate what belongs to us from
[1:51:43] what belongs to the Jews and he said I
[1:51:46] believe she's ready to strike the final
[1:51:49] climax so we are here
[1:51:53] I want to say on this part we are here
[1:51:56] if you ever see the holy ghost from that
[1:51:58] part phase one for you as an individual
[1:52:01] amen you are there you have a ride
[1:52:05] you have a chicken for the Rapture
[1:52:07] there's no going back and there's no
[1:52:09] defeat
[1:52:10] you have won
[1:52:13] you have won
[1:52:16] Hallelujah the battle is over
[1:52:18] the soul has been conquered the conquest
[1:52:21] has been done the devil's been driven
[1:52:24] out and you have ascended and you will
[1:52:27] Ascend you got a ticket in your hand you
[1:52:29] have a right to a rapture
[1:52:33] Hallelujah
[1:52:35] but he said I believe she's ready to
[1:52:37] strike that final Climax and I want to
[1:52:41] say this this message is the final
[1:52:44] climax there's nothing Beyond it the
[1:52:48] next message is for the Jews and so it's
[1:52:51] the final climax for the rapture to get
[1:52:54] that predestinated seed so it'll
[1:52:56] complete the body because we cannot
[1:52:59] leave but cannot go and leave one behind
[1:53:04] amen there's some of you that God is
[1:53:07] waiting on you amen God is waiting on
[1:53:11] you to get that revelation
[1:53:14] that the Mysteries have been revealed
[1:53:16] that you know your position in the word
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:22] that you know who you are that you
[1:53:24] cannot be deceived because he has put
[1:53:26] the word on the inside of you and you
[1:53:29] can't deceive the word
[1:53:33] every name that's in the Lamb's Book of
[1:53:35] Life Will Come he'll dip it in his blood
[1:53:38] he'll do whatever he has to do but
[1:53:41] believe me he's going to get his bride
[1:53:44] the prophet bringing those Seven Seals
[1:53:47] brought the final climax of his ministry
[1:53:50] and that is brought about a faith for
[1:53:52] the rapture
[1:53:54] we have now the doctrines of the
[1:53:57] prophets
[1:53:58] and the apostles
[1:54:00] we now have the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:54:04] yes the Baptist had part of the Gospel
[1:54:07] when they preached a mercen
[1:54:10] amen the the the the different ones the
[1:54:13] Pentecostals the methodists for example
[1:54:16] they had the gospel in the in that they
[1:54:19] preached sanctification
[1:54:21] but I never until this age
[1:54:26] since the beginning
[1:54:28] where the church felt
[1:54:30] are you with me where they fell from
[1:54:33] that lofty position of a Ascension Hill
[1:54:36] and defeat began to happen and
[1:54:39] enslavement began to happen with the
[1:54:41] Catholic Church rising up and in her we
[1:54:44] found the souls of men
[1:54:47] he enslaved them
[1:54:49] and every system of religion does the
[1:54:52] same thing it enslaves men and women
[1:54:56] but the Gospel of Jesus Christ was to
[1:54:59] bring freedom
[1:55:02] hallelujah amen it was to be freedom in
[1:55:05] my life
[1:55:06] freedom from sin freedom from unbelief
[1:55:09] Freedom there to have everything that
[1:55:12] God promised
[1:55:17] brother Branham knew that the last
[1:55:19] mystery to be added to the church
[1:55:22] would be the seven Thunders
[1:55:25] or that second climax he said that I
[1:55:28] talked about the other day
[1:55:29] in reference to those Thunders that were
[1:55:32] going to be revealed is it something
[1:55:34] coming forth from the for the church now
[1:55:37] you may wonder what are those Thunders
[1:55:39] they're the Mysteries contained in the
[1:55:40] Seven Seals
[1:55:42] amen one time they were sealed up
[1:55:46] we didn't know what it meant White Horse
[1:55:48] and we don't know who what it is or who
[1:55:50] it is some say it's Christ some say it's
[1:55:53] this some Say it'll happen all over in
[1:55:55] the tribulation some says it's already
[1:55:57] happened some says this you know
[1:55:58] everybody's got their idea it's like
[1:56:01] I've explained many times you use that
[1:56:04] illustration in the days of Daniel
[1:56:05] something is written
[1:56:08] many many tackle you parsing but nobody
[1:56:11] knows what it is
[1:56:14] a hand is ridden it
[1:56:17] something that's been written by God and
[1:56:20] nobody knows
[1:56:22] and astrologers and the wise men are
[1:56:25] common they guests and we've got books
[1:56:29] of them Matthew Henry and Seuss's
[1:56:31] apocalypse and and uh you know we got
[1:56:34] the uh Jameson's faucet and brown and we
[1:56:37] got all kinds of theologians from every
[1:56:41] denomination
[1:56:43] who have come up and looked at it many
[1:56:45] many tackle you Farson and they don't
[1:56:48] know what it means
[1:56:51] everybody's guessing I think it means
[1:56:53] that I think it means that and when
[1:56:55] they'll be they'll put they'll do a
[1:56:57] denomination on this one or that one
[1:57:00] this is our camp
[1:57:02] and this is what we believe
[1:57:05] but nobody knows until Daniel the
[1:57:08] Prophet is called
[1:57:10] and when Daniel the Prophet is called he
[1:57:12] looks up there and he said I tell you
[1:57:14] what it means you are weighed in the
[1:57:16] balance and you're found wanting
[1:57:18] that's exactly the way it is with this
[1:57:20] generation it's a generation
[1:57:23] whether they're awaiting the balance and
[1:57:25] they are found wanting
[1:57:28] are you with me amen this but but again
[1:57:31] nobody knew until a prophet came we had
[1:57:34] things in the Book of Revelation we
[1:57:37] didn't understand man guess that
[1:57:39] theologians said this that but it was
[1:57:41] everybody's guess until the prophet came
[1:57:44] and when the seventh angel sounded his
[1:57:46] message the mystery of God was kept off
[1:57:50] [Applause]
[1:57:53] he would be shown this in junior
[1:57:55] Jackson's dream of coming up the
[1:57:58] mountain there and he said that I was
[1:58:00] doing it I was revealing some mysterious
[1:58:02] writing on the side I was telling
[1:58:04] telling showing the mysterious writing
[1:58:06] along the side but I got up to the top
[1:58:09] and when I got up to the top it was
[1:58:11] capped
[1:58:13] and he said a tool was given to me from
[1:58:15] heaven
[1:58:17] and I took it and I opened it
[1:58:19] and white light or he said it was White
[1:58:21] Rock White Stone a revelation
[1:58:25] pure Revelation that light had never
[1:58:27] shown them before
[1:58:29] it had never been given nobody had known
[1:58:33] until the last days
[1:58:35] and it wasn't something outside the
[1:58:37] Bible it was revealing what was in the
[1:58:39] Bible
[1:58:40] you see because it's the word of God it
[1:58:42] can't be a revelation outside of the
[1:58:44] Bible or we're cursed
[1:58:47] amen is going to bring you back to what
[1:58:49] Paul taught or we're cursed
[1:58:52] yes are you with me but the second
[1:58:54] climax that that he said it come in and
[1:58:57] it was you see now listen to this the
[1:59:00] message Paradox I want to just kind of
[1:59:02] read this for now instead of paraphrase
[1:59:04] it whatever church ever organizes a
[1:59:07] message ever organized it goes on the
[1:59:09] shelf and it never rises again you see
[1:59:11] they're defeated
[1:59:13] not to hear historians here I know one
[1:59:17] of you see and then that's right it
[1:59:19] never rises again when it organizes
[1:59:22] Catholicism was the first organization
[1:59:24] called in the Bible of Horror and she
[1:59:27] was the mother of harlots the same thing
[1:59:30] organizations
[1:59:32] you see where it's all winding up again
[1:59:35] up here in The ecumenical council
[1:59:38] now I'm put out because of that amongst
[1:59:41] the organizations and brothers don't
[1:59:43] realize what they're doing it's not me
[1:59:45] I'm not put out they're putting the word
[1:59:47] out
[1:59:48] the Bible said in this layout of seeing
[1:59:51] age that Christ was on the outside of
[1:59:53] the church knocking trying to get back
[1:59:55] in there never was an age like that on
[1:59:59] the outside
[2:00:01] because that's going to be no more
[2:00:04] Church ages this is the end of it
[2:00:07] the laodicea and the age or the laodicea
[2:00:10] was the last age and Pentecost is at
[2:00:13] last days and we know there'll never be
[2:00:15] no more above Pentecost now he's
[2:00:17] obviously not talking about Azusa Street
[2:00:20] that's it
[2:00:22] and like another man like a man no other
[2:00:24] another no creature ever come could come
[2:00:27] up from its Evolution coming into a high
[2:00:30] species than man because man is in the
[2:00:33] image of God who created him there will
[2:00:36] be nothing higher this is the word
[2:00:39] wouldn't let it go any farther because
[2:00:41] he is the word
[2:00:43] and neither can the word climb above any
[2:00:46] laodicean church age and we see them
[2:00:50] every one there Jesus on the outside the
[2:00:52] church trying to get back in and that's
[2:00:54] what they've done to him when he was
[2:00:56] here first he was the word and the word
[2:00:58] when he was the word they say we got the
[2:01:01] word and the Pharisees said we got the
[2:01:03] word but the real true word they was
[2:01:06] rejecting it that's the reason Jesus
[2:01:08] said search the scriptures they
[2:01:11] testified me
[2:01:13] so again as he explained it cannot go
[2:01:18] past the word
[2:01:20] the word can't climb any higher than the
[2:01:24] seventh Church AIDS message
[2:01:28] you say well brother Tim we're in the
[2:01:30] bright age that's exactly right we are
[2:01:32] in the bright age
[2:01:34] but you see that's not one of the Seven
[2:01:36] Ages that just means that it's the time
[2:01:39] of the elect lady
[2:01:41] but the word cannot climb above the
[2:01:45] laodicean church age because it's the
[2:01:47] word God would not permit it to go
[2:01:50] beyond him
[2:01:52] I want you to know the message that we
[2:01:55] got and receive this Christ himself not
[2:01:58] another
[2:02:00] and it cannot go beyond him
[2:02:03] it must ascend
[2:02:05] don't fall back for it
[2:02:08] remember these others fell back and
[2:02:11] their Captain they're carried Captain
[2:02:13] Away by ecumenical councils World
[2:02:17] Council of churches and all kinds of
[2:02:19] things in the sodomite spirit
[2:02:22] are you with me perversion that's what I
[2:02:24] mean sodomite Spirit perversion
[2:02:28] and they've been carried away
[2:02:30] you see they aimed at the High Calling
[2:02:33] and and lost their grip
[2:02:35] and I tell you it's not just enough to
[2:02:38] get up here on the top of the hill and
[2:02:40] look around and say we've arrived we've
[2:02:42] got to hold that position
[2:02:45] amen there is the onslaught of the enemy
[2:02:48] that will do everything he can to get
[2:02:50] you to doubt the word of God
[2:02:53] because he knows that if you doubt the
[2:02:56] word of God that then it will not work
[2:02:59] in your life
[2:03:01] it's only when you believe it that it'll
[2:03:04] work in your life
[2:03:06] that's how healing work miracles work
[2:03:08] signs work the spoken word works it all
[2:03:12] works when somebody believes what God
[2:03:15] Said who will not compromise on it
[2:03:23] now we come
[2:03:25] to the church
[2:03:28] the three pyramids three examples that
[2:03:31] he used it for
[2:03:32] he used it for the individual capped off
[2:03:35] with the Holy Spirit uniting you and God
[2:03:38] that's the Capstone
[2:03:39] it's the ultimate
[2:03:43] you say brother Tim what about adoption
[2:03:45] it is the adoption
[2:03:47] and it's not separate from the true New
[2:03:50] Birth
[2:03:50] that's what it is you see you shall
[2:03:54] receive power after the Holy Ghost has
[2:03:56] come upon you so what brother Jim when
[2:03:59] is the bride going to have the power
[2:04:01] right now
[2:04:03] we're not waiting on the power oh if the
[2:04:06] squeeze would come we'll have the power
[2:04:08] let me tell you I don't know how much
[2:04:10] you want to be squeezed or how much
[2:04:12] squeeze you want
[2:04:14] amen there's plenty enough pressure in
[2:04:16] this age
[2:04:17] but you know all of the pressure of the
[2:04:20] Dark Ages and the horrible persecution
[2:04:23] never produce a raptured faith or
[2:04:25] adopted people
[2:04:27] so that's not what's going to do it it's
[2:04:30] the word of God that we have been
[2:04:32] brought to that is adopted to people and
[2:04:35] placed you and put the adoption road but
[2:04:38] the Holy Ghost upon you
[2:04:41] and we're not a bunch of cowards that
[2:04:43] gotta go hide down behind something and
[2:04:46] say oh well you know one day when the
[2:04:49] power comes we'll defeat this enemy but
[2:04:51] right now we better run scared no sir we
[2:04:55] don't have to do that we are equipped we
[2:04:57] are dressed we are commissioned we
[2:05:00] accept we are in fact we are the
[2:05:02] soldiers that are hold that position
[2:05:05] hold that Hill don't let go of it
[2:05:14] I'm speaking to abducted Sons and
[2:05:16] Daughters today that are oh yeah I know
[2:05:19] there's a fullness of adoption that we
[2:05:21] talk about the change of our body this
[2:05:23] ain't it yet but I tell you right now we
[2:05:26] are adopted Sons filled with the Holy
[2:05:28] Ghost the adoption robe upon us
[2:05:32] hey man his ring I put on my finger the
[2:05:36] authority to use his word
[2:05:38] we're not waiting on something it's
[2:05:42] already here God's waiting on you to
[2:05:45] possess your promise
[2:05:54] the third stage or the third example
[2:05:57] that he would use the pyramid for now he
[2:06:00] would say not a pyramid Doctrine no no
[2:06:02] don't even think about what they write
[2:06:03] about the pyramid is I'm just using this
[2:06:06] for an example
[2:06:08] foreign
[2:06:09] and as an example it starts wide at the
[2:06:11] base and it goes and narrows and narrows
[2:06:13] and narrows and then it gets capped off
[2:06:17] and the top the top Stones has got to
[2:06:20] match
[2:06:22] the Capstone
[2:06:24] you see it couldn't be back here it has
[2:06:27] to be up here
[2:06:29] it has to match
[2:06:32] the last stones
[2:06:38] the last stones
[2:06:40] the last ones
[2:06:43] oh brother I I hope you are realizing
[2:06:46] what I'm talking about
[2:06:48] there's not another generation
[2:06:51] that's not another church age to follow
[2:06:53] this we're at the end every way you want
[2:06:56] to figure it
[2:06:57] amen will the last Stones going in the
[2:07:00] building and we must match the Capstone
[2:07:12] when you're back down here at the base
[2:07:14] you're not expected at the base in the
[2:07:16] building of it to match the Capstone
[2:07:18] you get up a little closer it doesn't
[2:07:20] match a little closer it's closer but it
[2:07:23] doesn't match you can't put it it's only
[2:07:25] when it reaches
[2:07:29] that last few stones
[2:07:32] and that's when the Capstone comes to
[2:07:34] unite
[2:07:36] and the church who is the bride of
[2:07:37] Christ must be completed
[2:07:42] now wait a minute
[2:07:44] I know you said well I'm complete when I
[2:07:46] got the Holy Ghost yes that's a
[2:07:48] completion that's a summit
[2:07:51] well I'm complete when I receive the
[2:07:53] word the message you know he's our head
[2:07:56] and he's the head that's come to the
[2:07:58] body it's the word but the Tim it's the
[2:08:00] word and all that's true
[2:08:02] but that's another example another type
[2:08:06] but look at this
[2:08:08] the church who is the bride of Christ
[2:08:11] must be completed
[2:08:14] by the capping her with the physical
[2:08:17] return of Jesus Christ and uniting with
[2:08:21] the the living with the dead in Christ
[2:08:33] so it's not enough
[2:08:36] that's not all that's expected of you in
[2:08:38] this age just get the Holy Ghost
[2:08:41] it's not all that's expected of you in
[2:08:44] this age just to
[2:08:45] get the knowledge of the Mysteries
[2:08:49] see it all capped off with the with the
[2:08:51] seven Thunders and ever mystery truth
[2:08:53] revealed that is needed and all of that
[2:08:55] is wonderful and has its place and must
[2:08:59] happen
[2:09:00] but I'm telling you that this is the
[2:09:04] most important thing of all that the
[2:09:07] churches of Bryant Christ must be
[2:09:10] completed
[2:09:12] with the physical return of Jesus Christ
[2:09:16] he is the head of the church
[2:09:20] and it must happen in this age because
[2:09:23] there's not another age to follow
[2:09:29] that means it's all dependent on you
[2:09:34] it's all depending on me
[2:09:37] to climb that hill and possess that
[2:09:41] and be shaped
[2:09:43] by him
[2:09:45] in order to be those last stones that
[2:09:47] matches him
[2:09:49] a church
[2:09:50] that matches him
[2:09:53] in the inner Veil brother Branham talked
[2:09:55] about this he said and I just want to
[2:09:58] want to point out some things that he
[2:10:01] was referring to he said I'm writing a
[2:10:03] commentary on Divine Healing it'll be on
[2:10:05] the front pages of the commentary now
[2:10:08] it's been all put down and we know it's
[2:10:10] the truth the next thing
[2:10:12] the next thing God will step in with
[2:10:15] higher miracles
[2:10:18] and greater things on greater planes
[2:10:22] as Jesus when he was here on Earth the
[2:10:26] first coming of the Lord Jesus it showed
[2:10:28] to John the Baptist miraculous birth
[2:10:30] then the miraculous of Jesus and then it
[2:10:33] come in the healing of the sick and the
[2:10:36] discernment of the spirits and then on
[2:10:38] to the raisin of the dead and from that
[2:10:40] on down to the Earth in the heavens and
[2:10:43] everything declaring him and the Earth
[2:10:45] giving of his dead miraculous miraculous
[2:10:48] miraculous all along all the way along
[2:10:52] just keep deeper and deeper and deeper
[2:10:54] to Climax and so will it be now
[2:10:59] so he's looking back at Jesus
[2:11:02] as he was the capping off of the Old
[2:11:05] Testament
[2:11:07] amen then he said when he came as that
[2:11:10] there the captain of it all he said it
[2:11:13] came with Healing The Sick and
[2:11:15] discernment of spirits and raising the
[2:11:17] Dead the heavens declaring him the Sun
[2:11:21] the moon wouldn't shine you remember the
[2:11:23] the earthquakes and everything else it
[2:11:25] gave up its death
[2:11:28] the miraculous the miraculous the
[2:11:31] miraculous until the dead of the Old
[2:11:33] Testament actually Rose from their
[2:11:36] graves and appeared unto many
[2:11:40] is that the Bible
[2:11:42] amen this was a great climax
[2:11:46] of the of the church that Jesus brought
[2:11:50] let me tell you the New Testament Church
[2:11:52] will not be no less of a church she's a
[2:11:56] greater Church than the Old Testament
[2:12:00] Hallelujah God was in the old Covenant
[2:12:03] what about the new
[2:12:05] Hallelujah we have had the John the
[2:12:07] Baptist that has stood and he's
[2:12:09] introduced the coming word which is
[2:12:11] Christ amen amen he said that's the
[2:12:15] first four runners said Behold the Lamb
[2:12:16] of God so will this Forerunner point to
[2:12:19] a word born Pride
[2:12:22] Hallelujah he was pointing to your
[2:12:25] coming
[2:12:27] Hallelujah that the God would be here in
[2:12:30] Bride form God take it on human flesh
[2:12:34] God moving in a bright bloody doing the
[2:12:38] same works that he did with the same
[2:12:40] power and the same anointing
[2:12:44] Hallelujah until it climaxes amen
[2:12:48] healing doesn't just go away it keeps on
[2:12:51] going and going and going the miraculous
[2:12:55] continuous continuous continuous until
[2:12:58] the dead in Christ actually come right
[2:13:02] into this Dimension and when you see
[2:13:04] them you are changed to be like them
[2:13:08] amen you have not seen the depths of the
[2:13:12] miraculous
[2:13:13] [Applause]
[2:13:15] amen we have not reached this climax
[2:13:22] somebody fast
[2:13:24] we cannot fall back like the Baptist and
[2:13:27] Methodist the Pentecostal we must take a
[2:13:30] sense of heal
[2:13:36] ing
[2:13:37] all the expectation of the ages
[2:13:41] all the people of the ages
[2:13:43] the all the dead in Christ
[2:13:46] it all hinges on you winning this battle
[2:13:55] the final battle is shown in Revelation
[2:13:57] 12.
[2:13:59] there's also shown in Daniel 12 where
[2:14:01] Michael the Archangel stands up
[2:14:04] and everyone whose names are found in
[2:14:07] the book will be delivered
[2:14:13] amen you know only history now can look
[2:14:16] back and see the winners and The Losers
[2:14:18] of that Civil War
[2:14:21] amen only history can go and look back
[2:14:23] and see their mistakes and their bumbles
[2:14:25] and and the foolish things their
[2:14:27] generals did and why they're lost and
[2:14:29] why all this that's all that history can
[2:14:32] do but let me tell you friends we got
[2:14:35] more than just history although we can
[2:14:37] go but that types in the Bible and
[2:14:40] shadows in the Bible and Men down to the
[2:14:43] ages and we can look back and we can
[2:14:45] draw straight from that but there is
[2:14:47] prophecy laying in the word of God
[2:14:50] that predicts the outcome oh Hallelujah
[2:14:54] more that predicts prophesies of the
[2:14:57] outcome of this battle
[2:15:00] and I want you to know the prophecy said
[2:15:03] you're going to overcome the prophecy
[2:15:05] said you're gonna win the prophecy said
[2:15:08] you'll defeat the Devil amen the
[2:15:11] prophecy said you're going to cast him
[2:15:13] down
[2:15:21] and men and women today the word of the
[2:15:24] Lord can never fail if God said it God's
[2:15:27] going to do it if he said I'll have a
[2:15:29] pride when I spot a wrinkle or blemons
[2:15:32] or any such thing God's gonna do it
[2:15:41] all right and I just say it might well
[2:15:43] be me
[2:15:45] might as well be me Here I Am Lord let
[2:15:49] it be me
[2:15:50] [Applause]
[2:15:58] final battle is shown in Revelation 12
[2:16:01] where Michael the Archangel fights
[2:16:03] for the liberation of God's people
[2:16:06] and brings about the Rapture of the
[2:16:09] Bride
[2:16:11] I could take a moment just take
[2:16:13] Revelation 12 and go down to it verse by
[2:16:15] verse
[2:16:16] we can just see it so plain in the
[2:16:19] scripture
[2:16:20] what belongs to Israel what belongs to
[2:16:22] us
[2:16:24] the first coming of Christ the last
[2:16:26] coming of Christ
[2:16:28] it's all Lays there brother Bradham
[2:16:30] tells us over and again in the fourth
[2:16:32] sea on third seal for seal he tells us
[2:16:34] again the Rapture takes place in
[2:16:37] Revelation 12.
[2:16:39] when Satan is cast out
[2:16:42] the bride goes up
[2:16:45] Hallelujah you know what it is it's
[2:16:48] where Angelic battles became human
[2:16:51] battles
[2:16:52] and the Bible said and they overcame him
[2:16:55] by the blood of the Lamb
[2:16:58] that's not Angels he's talking about
[2:17:00] blood was never shed for an angel it's
[2:17:03] only sons of God they overcome him by
[2:17:07] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[2:17:09] their testimony and they love not their
[2:17:12] lives unto the death they were faithful
[2:17:14] in everything come on Church
[2:17:16] [Applause]
[2:17:20] when they were shot down or killed or
[2:17:24] whatever they were facing forward they
[2:17:26] were going forward I'll tell you the
[2:17:29] holy spirit is calling out today for our
[2:17:31] people that go forward
[2:17:34] don't fall back don't retreat
[2:17:38] you're equipped you're upset and you've
[2:17:41] got more than muskets and carbines the
[2:17:44] arms Arcana but you got atomic bombs of
[2:17:47] the word of God admonition that has been
[2:17:50] given to you to defeat this enemy at
[2:17:52] this day
[2:17:53] [Music]
[2:17:57] the truth
[2:18:03] let's just go back over to Revelation
[2:18:05] 12. I wasn't planning on this but let's
[2:18:07] do it for a minute
[2:18:13] I'm just going to look I'm just going to
[2:18:15] take a moment on this
[2:18:17] revelation 12.
[2:18:19] if you go down to verse revelation 12.
[2:18:23] one through six
[2:18:26] you go right down there and of course
[2:18:29] this is where
[2:18:30] the man child is born
[2:18:33] there's a woman clothed with the Sun the
[2:18:36] moon under her feet
[2:18:37] on her head where crowns of 12 Stars
[2:18:40] this was Israel
[2:18:47] and she being with child she cried
[2:18:49] travailing to me in birth and pain to be
[2:18:52] delivered
[2:18:53] and she was expecting the Messiah
[2:18:57] then I saw another
[2:18:59] appeared another Wonder in heaven
[2:19:02] and beheld a great and red dragon having
[2:19:05] seven heads and ten horns and seven
[2:19:07] crowns on his head and his tail Drew
[2:19:10] through drew a third part of the stars
[2:19:13] of heaven and did cast them to the earth
[2:19:15] and the dragon stood before the woman
[2:19:18] which was ready to be delivered for to
[2:19:21] devour her child as soon as it was born
[2:19:24] brother Branham explains that over and
[2:19:26] again that was wrong standing right
[2:19:28] there
[2:19:30] a mountain Rome was there or not Rome
[2:19:33] but the devil was there in the days of
[2:19:35] Moses
[2:19:36] gonna kill the newborn children
[2:19:39] a man going to destroy them all are you
[2:19:42] with me
[2:19:43] he was right there to do it there in
[2:19:46] Moses but you know God's got bigger
[2:19:48] plans
[2:19:50] amen the devil is is he's not
[2:19:53] omnipresent
[2:19:55] and he's not omniscient he doesn't know
[2:19:58] all things
[2:19:59] but God is both

[2:31:27] would appear before God's Satan was
[2:31:29] present with him
[2:31:30] in the days of Zechariah when when he
[2:31:34] that there Satan was there to withstand
[2:31:36] him

[2:32:43] these are men and women just like me and
[2:32:45] you in fact This Is Us

[2:33:45] other than the sea for the devil has
[2:33:48] come down to you have a great Wrath

[2:34:04] all of those
[2:34:06] prisoners of War
[2:34:09] that are in the camps of
[2:34:10] denominationalism
[2:34:13] it's going to go after him and

[2:34:39] is at hand
[2:34:41] the great Warfare between the devil and
[2:34:43] God is going on and the scene has been
[2:34:46] set
[2:34:47] for the final front lines where the
[2:34:51] Clash will come
[2:34:52] and God will reign and Rule and the lamb
[2:34:56] was with them and overcome them
[2:35:00] for he is Lord of Lord and king of kings
[2:35:03] and he'll ride down over every
[2:35:06] opposition

[2:35:45] for the final battle
[2:35:48] the host of hell
[2:35:50] is against us
[2:35:53] but when hell turns loose
[2:35:56] Heaven turns loose also
[2:35:59] when you see the enemy come in like a
[2:36:02] flood the spirit of the Lord lifts up
[2:36:04] the standard against him God's got a
[2:36:06] standard batters wave and amen going

[2:42:17] in Pennsylvania
[2:42:23] and there they were they were they were
[2:42:25] playing David there it was a wonderful
[2:42:27] wonderful thing
[2:42:31] as we come through the town you can see
[2:42:34] the Amish
[2:42:35] come along with their little horse and
[2:42:37] Buggies and Mennonites with a little
[2:42:40] different color
[2:42:42] just seeing them held captive by
[2:42:45] traditions of men so under a nicolaitan
[2:42:48] Doctrine
[2:42:49] a bishop decides of his district
[2:42:52] they can have rubber on the tires
[2:42:56] or not have rubber owned tires
[2:43:00] everything is regulated
[2:43:04] write down whether you can have
[2:43:06] electricity in your home whether you can
[2:43:08] have a cell phone whether you can't have
[2:43:10] one and one Bishop says you can another
[2:43:12] says you can't you're just held under
[2:43:14] nicolaitan Conquering the laity with
[2:43:17] rules and regulations doomed
[2:43:21] to horse and buggy
[2:43:23] hampered by dogma of men
[2:43:29] so you see you know as we pass through
[2:43:32] all of that and we go to the Sight and
[2:43:35] Sound
[2:43:36] and there we assembled hair and we go to
[2:43:40] watch David there and the life of David
[2:43:43] and him killing Goliath his mighty men
[2:43:47] he had a battle to win you see Israel
[2:43:50] had never conquered all the land that
[2:43:52] was promised
[2:43:55] they that great generals like Joshua and
[2:43:58] but you know remember in the days the
[2:44:00] judges neither did neptulum and neither
[2:44:02] did
[2:44:03] neither did zebulun the neither dead the
[2:44:08] tribes of Joseph but neither did
[2:44:10] Simeon neither did they conquer her all
[2:44:14] that was given to them but the
[2:44:15] Canaanites dwelt in the land
[2:44:18] but in the days of David
[2:44:23] goes up as a great warrior king
[2:44:26] and he says I'm taking all the land
[2:44:30] everything that God promised
[2:44:33] so after becoming King he just wasn't
[2:44:36] satisfied to sit there with his crown
[2:44:39] and enjoy the little domain that he had
[2:44:42] but he began to expand the borders
[2:44:45] he said we're going to have everything
[2:44:47] God's word said we could have
[2:44:50] so he would send out his mighty man and
[2:44:53] he would go with him and he would fight
[2:44:55] Israel's battles and he'd come back with
[2:44:59] a with the crown of the malachites and
[2:45:01] the crown of of the Philistines and the
[2:45:04] different crowns of the Nations that he
[2:45:07] subdued around him and brought
[2:45:09] subservient to him
[2:45:13] and there was
[2:45:15] men that had gathered around him
[2:45:18] they are called David's Mighty Men
[2:45:22] and these men there were men of Courage
[2:45:25] man who would stand for science men who
[2:45:29] would risk their lives
[2:45:34] men who would go forward
[2:45:38] and David there and see what day in a
[2:45:42] great battle he was in he just
[2:45:45] God's so thirsty
[2:45:47] and he remembered it the well at
[2:45:51] Bethlehem but the Philip Steins was
[2:45:53] Garrison there
[2:45:55] you see they had taken David's on the
[2:45:58] Homeland and had got around the well and
[2:46:01] the devil wasn't going to let him have
[2:46:04] those blessings
[2:46:07] and David just breathed and cried and
[2:46:09] said oh oh if I just had a drink from
[2:46:15] that well of Bethlehem
[2:46:18] and those Mighty Men heard the King's
[2:46:22] request or this desire and remember you
[2:46:26] remember here he was one that had been a
[2:46:29] fugitive to he had been a fugitive and
[2:46:32] ran and everything else and they had
[2:46:33] come to him though he was a fugitive
[2:46:36] they was going to stand on the Lord's
[2:46:37] Side because he knew he was coming King
[2:46:41] and let me just say we know
[2:46:44] we know there might be president's rise
[2:46:47] the queen dies and the King Rises and
[2:46:50] all this hoopla that you got going on
[2:46:51] today but we know that the king of kings
[2:46:55] and the Lord of lords is going to rain
[2:46:58] we know he's coming into power
[2:47:02] of these men knew David was coming to
[2:47:05] power they knew the anointing oil had
[2:47:08] been poured on him and the word of the
[2:47:10] Lord was upon him
[2:47:11] are you with me amen and brother Brandon
[2:47:14] will look at that and he said oh
[2:47:16] Brothers I'm in a terrible spot
[2:47:18] he said we are Garrison today with men
[2:47:21] saying the days of Miracles have passed
[2:47:24] and Divine Healing is no more and the
[2:47:26] Holy Ghost isn't for today he said who
[2:47:29] is there a man that would draw his sword
[2:47:31] and come with me and get down to the
[2:47:34] well of Bethlehem and draw a fresh drink
[2:47:38] of Pentecostal water
[2:47:41] amen that's some formal religion not
[2:47:43] something just to jump in a shout but he
[2:47:46] said real holy ghost power and bring
[2:47:49] that back and refresh our King
[2:47:53] I wonder today in this battle
[2:47:56] as we hear the message
[2:47:58] urging us on
[2:48:00] climb the hill
[2:48:02] take possession
[2:48:03] Drive the canineers of Satan off
[2:48:06] the lutherans went so far as to say that
[2:48:10] just shall live by faith
[2:48:12] he crushed the squadrons of Rome but
[2:48:16] fell back and was conquered
[2:48:18] and they became prisoners of War to a
[2:48:21] system
[2:48:22] the Baptist stood on a mercen and away
[2:48:25] from infant baptism many of them
[2:48:28] heroically gave their lives
[2:48:31] but they fell back
[2:48:33] under the pressure
[2:48:35] of the satanic Army
[2:48:37] the methodists the nazarenes the pilgrim
[2:48:40] holiness
[2:48:41] made a charge for the heal of Ascension
[2:48:43] but they only got so far as
[2:48:45] sanctification
[2:48:47] and fell back and more worldly
[2:48:50] devil possessed
[2:48:52] satanic inspired in their churches
[2:48:55] rainbow flags on the outside Herald and
[2:48:59] Harold and the perversion of the sodomy
[2:49:02] of the age
[2:49:04] the Pentecostal Revival led by God's
[2:49:07] generals
[2:49:08] Brothers
[2:49:09] Seymour got so close to he actually
[2:49:13] spoke in tongues
[2:49:15] of that Heavenly dimension
[2:49:18] generals like Smith Wigglesworth and
[2:49:21] John G Lake and FF Bosworth Made A Way
[2:49:25] for the great healing campaigns that was
[2:49:28] to follow
[2:49:29] the Healer Revival
[2:49:31] that was led by a prophet of God
[2:49:36] the greatest General since the days of
[2:49:38] Paul
[2:49:39] drove out cancers
[2:49:42] Demons of heart disease
[2:49:44] demons had endlessly crippled God's
[2:49:47] people shot at them from every side
[2:49:50] but deaf ears will open the blind eyes
[2:49:53] could see
[2:49:55] and I'm not just talking about one
[2:49:57] little children Miracles here and there
[2:49:58] right here in Little Rock Arkansas I
[2:50:01] passed by I passed by the school of the
[2:50:04] death where in the early 1950s brother
[2:50:07] Branham there's went to the school of
[2:50:11] the deaf and 150 deaf men and women were
[2:50:15] healed by the glory of God
[2:50:18] amen are you see you see a that there
[2:50:22] were other there were other men we might
[2:50:25] call them corporals or sergeants or
[2:50:27] whatever but they were promoted like
[2:50:29] like um and you might know the story of
[2:50:32] Jack Cole he went to the meeting brother
[2:50:34] Bradham says a skeptic
[2:50:37] there was a man that would die that was
[2:50:39] blind with no eyeballs and brother
[2:50:41] Bradham told him said within three days
[2:50:44] eyeballs will form and after that you'll
[2:50:46] see
[2:50:47] Well Jack he was an Assembly of God
[2:50:50] Pentecostal preacher but he was a
[2:50:52] doubter a skeptic
[2:50:54] he said ah anybody could say that and
[2:50:56] make that kind of claim and his brother
[2:50:59] Branham left the building he walked by
[2:51:00] him patted him on the leg like that and
[2:51:03] on the knee and and prayed softly a
[2:51:06] minute
[2:51:07] and he said you know you're not sick
[2:51:10] you're just worn down from preaching
[2:51:12] meetings but don't be skepticals you
[2:51:14] were you were doubting whether this was
[2:51:16] of God or not I want to tell you that
[2:51:18] this is of God and we're both fighting
[2:51:20] the same devil going and continuing the
[2:51:22] Revival because you also were called to
[2:51:24] pray for the sick
[2:51:26] Jack Cole made it around for the third
[2:51:29] day
[2:51:30] came back to the meeting
[2:51:32] he's going to make sure that all of this
[2:51:34] was true that he could be thoroughly
[2:51:37] convinced
[2:51:38] not only
[2:51:40] that day early that morning the blind
[2:51:43] man passed him and the man with no
[2:51:45] eyeballs now had eyeballs in his head
[2:51:49] but by that evening those eyes were
[2:51:51] seeing
[2:51:52] and he was shouting all over the place
[2:51:54] the glories of God and Jack Cole said
[2:51:57] himself that he knew then that William
[2:51:59] Branham was called for dispensational
[2:52:02] purpose
[2:52:03] and I wanted to say to this congregation
[2:52:06] today we must not allow Satan to reclaim
[2:52:10] the grounds that have been won
[2:52:14] we cannot Retreat from Divine Healing
[2:52:18] we cannot Retreat from gifts of the
[2:52:20] Spirit
[2:52:21] amen we cannot be afford to be led Away
[2:52:25] by false apostles
[2:52:27] some have been routed and have retreated
[2:52:30] all the way back to baptist easy
[2:52:32] believism and now they fall to where and
[2:52:36] now fall where they fell into making the
[2:52:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost a mere I
[2:52:41] believe the message
[2:52:43] some of them dropped the weapons of our
[2:52:46] Warfare and tongues is gone and prophecy
[2:52:49] is gone and why somebody some don't even
[2:52:52] want to preach any preaching anymore
[2:52:55] don't even preach this play and take and
[2:52:57] they have been captured by the devil
[2:53:01] show the term churches into morgues
[2:53:05] denying the power of God to shout of
[2:53:07] Victory is gone
[2:53:14] but there's some mighty men on the Earth
[2:53:18] you have been called for this final
[2:53:20] battle
[2:53:22] you have been hand-picked and selected
[2:53:25] God predestinated you to this age
[2:53:28] you could have come up at another age
[2:53:30] before us
[2:53:32] you could have been born 200 years ago
[2:53:34] 300 500
[2:53:36] 700 a thousand in the Dark Ages
[2:53:39] but God called you and elected you for
[2:53:42] this age and this time
[2:53:44] he called you not to be defeated he
[2:53:47] called you to be a devil defeater
[2:53:50] a serpent Bruiser a people who in this
[2:53:53] day were to be fulfilled that they will
[2:53:56] bruise the head of the serpent thy seed
[2:54:00] shall bruise the head of that serpent
[2:54:03] and I wonder today are there men and
[2:54:06] women right here in this place that can
[2:54:08] identify yourself as David's Mighty Men
[2:54:12] you may not feel real mighty but you're
[2:54:15] there you're part of the troops
[2:54:18] amen and you are hearing that your king
[2:54:21] wants a fresh drink of water
[2:54:23] he wants an old-fashioned Pentecostal
[2:54:26] Revival like he had in the days of the
[2:54:30] book of Acts he wants the Holy Ghost
[2:54:31] poured out upon his children he wants
[2:54:34] the power of God back in the church
[2:54:36] again is there a man is there a woman
[2:54:39] that says mama that's me I understand
[2:54:42] today I'm pressing on
[2:54:45] claiming Higher Ground today I'm taking
[2:54:48] The High Ground for the Ascension I
[2:54:51] refuse to be a slave any longer
[2:54:56] Amen Let The Musicians come oh God
[2:55:00] oh God as we bow our heads today
[2:55:04] as we just dedicate ourselves for costs
[2:55:07] as it moves teardrops within my own
[2:55:11] heart
[2:55:12] as I wept thinking about the men who
[2:55:15] tried in vain
[2:55:17] Lord they tried for their country for
[2:55:20] their cause for their belief
[2:55:23] Lord we know that it was wrong slavery
[2:55:27] was wrong the evil the evil that was
[2:55:29] evil
[2:55:31] so is slavery of men's Souls it's evil
[2:55:34] we must defend this at every cost
[2:55:38] we must stand for Zion
[2:55:40] we must stand for truth
[2:55:42] I pray o God
[2:55:44] that today will March to the tune of
[2:55:46] Onward Christian Soldiers
[2:55:49] not Retreat and backwards not fall back
[2:55:53] but go forward
[2:55:55] I pray Lord
[2:55:57] help us in this battle
[2:56:00] Lord help us in this battle Lord this
[2:56:02] there can be even our generals that get
[2:56:06] shot by their own men
[2:56:08] Lord we take shots from different places
[2:56:10] sometimes around the world while meeting
[2:56:13] people
[2:56:14] but Lord oh God not understanding we
[2:56:17] must take this hill
[2:56:19] I pray that we'll press ever onward
[2:56:22] let this admonition just fall deep in
[2:56:25] the hearts of your children today as we
[2:56:27] ask it in Jesus name
