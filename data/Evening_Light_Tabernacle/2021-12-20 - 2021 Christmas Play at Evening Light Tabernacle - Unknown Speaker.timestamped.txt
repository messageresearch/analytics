[17:59] [Music]
[18:05] [Music]
[18:12] star
[18:17] [Music]
[18:26] light
[18:30] well my good man let us continue our
[18:32] journey
[18:33] i bet we are getting closer
[18:36] [Music]
[18:56] [Music]
[19:07] my
[19:10] so
[19:12] [Music]
[19:25] and it came to pass in those days that
[19:27] there went out a decree from caesar
[19:29] augustus that the whole world should be
[19:32] taxed
[19:34] and this taxing was first made when
[19:36] cyrenis was the governor of syria
[19:40] and
[19:41] all went to be taxed everyone in his own
[19:43] city
[19:48] [Music]
[19:53] and joseph also went up from galilee out
[19:56] of the city of nazareth and to judea
[20:00] into the city of david which is called
[20:02] bethlehem because he was of the house
[20:06] and lineage of david to be tasked with
[20:09] mary his espoused wife being great with
[20:13] child
[20:14] and so it was that while they were there
[20:17] the days were accomplished that she
[20:19] should be delivered
[20:22] [Music]
[20:34] and she brought first
[20:38] forth her firstborn son and wrapped him
[20:42] in
[20:43] swallowing clothes
[20:45] and laid him in a manger because there
[20:48] was
[20:49] no room for them in the end
[20:53] and there
[20:55] were in
[20:57] the same country
[20:59] shepherds
[21:00] abiding in the
[21:04] flock
[21:06] keeping watch over
[21:09] there
[21:12] by night
[21:14] and
[21:15] oh the angel of the lord
[21:19] came upon them and
[21:22] the glory of the lord
[21:24] shone round about them
[21:27] and they were so afraid
[21:30] [Music]
[21:43] and the angel said unto them fear not
[21:46] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[21:48] great joy which shall be to all people
[21:51] for unto you is born this day in the
[21:54] city of david
[21:56] which
[21:56] is christ the lord and shall be a sign
[22:00] unto you you shall find the babe wrapped
[22:02] in swaddling clothes lying in a manger
[22:09] and suddenly there was with an angel and
[22:11] multitude of the heavenly hosts praising
[22:13] god and saying glory to god in the
[22:15] highest on earth peace good will towards
[22:18] men and it came to pass as the angels
[22:20] were gone away from them into heaven the
[22:22] shepherds said one to another let us not
[22:24] go even unto bethlehem and see this
[22:26] thing which has come to pass which the
[22:28] lord hath made known unto us and they
[22:30] came with haste and found mary and
[22:32] joseph and the babe lying in a manger
