[55:07] come yesterday and clean up around here
[55:09] and help us with all the mud and things
[55:12] and the dirt dauber nests and the bird
[55:14] nests and things that was on the
[55:15] building though
[55:17] ugly
[55:18] stains that brother but aaron was
[55:20] speaking about you know life as it tries
[55:23] to take back over and and so uh we was
[55:26] able to get a lot done yesterday and we
[55:28] appreciate every effort and everyone
[55:29] that was able to come
[55:31] amen matthew chapter 5 and verse 14
[55:35] it says
[55:36] ye are the light of the world
[55:38] a city that is set on a hill that cannot
[55:42] be hid
[55:44] neither do men light a candle and put it
[55:46] under a bushel but on a candlestick and
[55:49] it giveth light unto all that are in the
[55:51] house
[55:52] so let your light so shine before men
[55:56] that they may see your good works and
[55:58] glorify
[56:00] your father which is in heaven
[56:02] amen we let you be seated today
[56:05] i've been on this subject or thought of
[56:08] light and i'd like to continue on it
[56:10] this morning on ye are the light
[56:14] ye are the light you know
[56:16] we we're witnessing
[56:18] each
[56:20] passing generation and really as we get
[56:23] further along in this it seems like
[56:25] every passing day
[56:27] is progressively getting darker
[56:30] you know with each generation it seems
[56:32] to be
[56:33] 10 times worse than it was the previous
[56:35] generation
[56:37] as we see sin begin to very rapidly
[56:40] as it were a snowball as it gathers amen
[56:43] as it rolls down a hill it goes faster
[56:45] and faster but it also gathers more and
[56:48] more and we can see that sin
[56:50] is more than it's ever been it's
[56:53] we see the the realms of sodom and
[56:55] gomorrah as it's coming into this very
[56:58] openly and very expressed uh to work you
[57:01] know
[57:02] we got a man that wants to act like a
[57:04] woman amen swimming against women and
[57:07] and acting like he's done something uh
[57:10] you know and you just see even more and
[57:12] more senseless murders and
[57:14] and things that are taking place men and
[57:16] and people of in this age getting more
[57:18] and more violent
[57:21] and
[57:22] why has all this happen is because they
[57:24] refuse to turn to the light
[57:27] and you when you refuse to turn to light
[57:29] you go into outer darkness
[57:32] and then we see this nation has gotten
[57:34] dark very rapidly amen since rejecting
[57:37] the light of the word and and you know
[57:39] brother branham would talk about it in
[57:40] shalom you know he says those who will
[57:42] not turn to light there's only one thing
[57:45] that will happen you're going to go
[57:47] darker and darker as the years go on now
[57:50] this is in 64. so here we are um almost
[57:54] uh 60 years later and we can definitely
[57:57] say day by day it has gotten darker and
[58:00] darker year by year has gotten darker
[58:02] and darker he said but to those who will
[58:04] turn to the light
[58:05] you will get brighter and brighter amen
[58:08] and it's very it's a it's very obvious
[58:10] what takes place because the darker it
[58:12] is the brighter light shines
[58:14] and so and but not just that but the
[58:16] light will begin to grow and grow and
[58:18] become brighter and brighter until that
[58:21] perfect day that we're looking for amen
[58:24] his appearing where all darkness will
[58:27] fade away
[58:28] now i don't know about you but i'm
[58:29] looking forward to that day
[58:31] that there'll be no more darkness
[58:33] there'll be no more sin there
[58:35] and you can go into all kinds of things
[58:37] of in that nature there'll be no more
[58:38] worries no more fears no more sickness
[58:41] no more sorrow no more partying no more
[58:43] darkness at all fade away and he said
[58:46] that's the reason i can say even right
[58:48] now as i'm looking brother brandon was
[58:50] looking at the oncoming darkness that it
[58:53] would begin to be it would look so dark
[58:54] to him that even he is a prophet would
[58:57] say i just don't see how it can last
[58:59] past 1977
[59:01] because he couldn't see past the
[59:03] darkness that was there and and here we
[59:06] are now uh uh what is that 30 years
[59:09] almost 30 years past that or 40 years
[59:11] past that 77 amen it's and here we are
[59:15] living in the time the past what he
[59:18] could even see as a prophet amen so it's
[59:20] very dark and but he said looking at the
[59:22] darkness looking at that he said i can
[59:25] that's why i can say to the church of
[59:26] the living god shalom
[59:29] because we are his lights and jesus said
[59:33] ye are the light of the world now there
[59:35] was a message there was a shout there
[59:37] was a calling out of darkness amen not
[59:40] just to stand in the light but to become
[59:42] the light amen to become connected to
[59:45] the source as we spoke about the last
[59:47] time on the source of life amen this is
[59:50] where you would see we can read many
[59:51] scriptures about this in ephesians
[59:54] chapter 5 and verse 8 amen he says ye
[59:57] are worth sometimes darkness but now ye
[1:00:00] our light in the lord walk as children
[1:00:03] of light so we were one at a time in a
[1:00:06] dark place many of us could look back
[1:00:08] and we could say yes i was in a dark
[1:00:10] place i lived in a dark place i come
[1:00:13] from a dark place but thank god i'm no
[1:00:15] longer in that dark place but light has
[1:00:18] dawned upon me in my life and now i'm
[1:00:20] walking not as a child of darkness but
[1:00:23] as a child of light and the light of god
[1:00:25] is growing and moving in my life
[1:00:27] colossians 1 and verse 12 says giving
[1:00:30] thanks unto the father which has made us
[1:00:32] meet to be partakers of the inheritance
[1:00:35] of the saints in light who has delivered
[1:00:38] us from the power of darkness amen has
[1:00:41] translated us unto the kingdom of his
[1:00:43] dear son so amen we were in darkness and
[1:00:47] we were living in darkness but he
[1:00:48] delivered us from the power that held us
[1:00:51] in darkness and not only delivers from
[1:00:54] the power that held us in darkness he
[1:00:56] put a power in us amen to give us light
[1:00:59] amen to in a dark world and so we can
[1:01:01] also see in first peter 2 and verse 9 he
[1:01:04] says ye are a chosen generation a royal
[1:01:07] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[1:01:10] people that ye should show forth the
[1:01:12] praises of him who hath called you out
[1:01:15] of darkness into his marvelous life
[1:01:18] which in times past you were not a
[1:01:20] people but are now the people of god in
[1:01:23] times in other words in times past you
[1:01:25] were not the people of god amen i called
[1:01:28] people but now you are the people of god
[1:01:31] which had once not obtained mercy but
[1:01:34] now have obtained mercy amen it's a
[1:01:37] wonderful thing to know amen we're a
[1:01:39] people that has obtained mercy that in a
[1:01:41] time that that people are rejecting
[1:01:43] mercy they're turning away truth they're
[1:01:46] turning away light and they're moving on
[1:01:48] towards darkness there's a people that
[1:01:50] has obtained mercy they've accepted the
[1:01:52] mercy of almighty god and they're not
[1:01:54] moving towards darkness but they're
[1:01:56] moving towards life they're not moving
[1:01:58] towards hell but they're moving towards
[1:02:00] eternal life amen there's a people here
[1:02:02] that's not going to go down in the
[1:02:04] darkness of laodicea
[1:02:06] and it's going to get so dark i mean one
[1:02:08] day the light last light is going to go
[1:02:10] out and it's going to be complete utter
[1:02:13] darkness but there's a people there's
[1:02:15] the lights being gathered and they're
[1:02:17] being moved from this realm to another
[1:02:19] place
[1:02:20] amen we can see here amen we know
[1:02:22] there's seven dimensions we're living in
[1:02:24] this middle portion brother brandon will
[1:02:26] describe it there's three above us and
[1:02:28] there's three beneath us and he said in
[1:02:30] this he said i want to give you a little
[1:02:31] picture there's a stream of life that
[1:02:34] we're living in it's a dark stream he
[1:02:36] talks about it being very dark he said
[1:02:38] but in this little channel
[1:02:40] there dwells mortal beings and he said
[1:02:43] and there's a lot of darkness there's a
[1:02:45] mass of folly and a mass he called it
[1:02:47] would call it deity and devils and
[1:02:50] blackness and strengths but every once
[1:02:53] in a while you'll see a light
[1:02:57] every once in a while you see a light he
[1:02:59] said but see all of that darkness and
[1:03:02] all that streaks and gaity and carrying
[1:03:04] on devil's getting people he said oh
[1:03:07] they might dress fine they might be
[1:03:08] highly cultured as they can be polished
[1:03:11] scholars but still the devil he said but
[1:03:13] there in that darkness this little
[1:03:16] born-again believer sitting in there
[1:03:19] there's little lights here and there he
[1:03:21] would say he said you know another place
[1:03:22] he'd say jesus christ is the same
[1:03:25] yesterday today and forever don't let
[1:03:27] anybody ever tell you anything else he
[1:03:30] raised from the dead he lives tonight
[1:03:33] supremely and wherever two or three are
[1:03:35] gathered together i'll be in their midst
[1:03:39] amen we ought to say praise the lord
[1:03:41] this morning amen i'll be in their midst
[1:03:43] no matter how small the church is i'll
[1:03:45] be there he can't lie he will not lie he
[1:03:48] never lied before and he never will lie
[1:03:51] he said but on this street that we're
[1:03:53] living in where mortals live mortals are
[1:03:55] influenced from an outside world he said
[1:03:58] i would should understand by the grace
[1:04:00] of god he said i deal with spirits he
[1:04:02] said i know what i'm speaking of he said
[1:04:04] when we look through this dark mass of
[1:04:07] gaiety
[1:04:08] amen a folly of partying and you know
[1:04:11] but darkness every once in a while
[1:04:14] you'll see a little light burning
[1:04:17] hallelujah amen you'll see a little
[1:04:19] light burning amen just like the it's on
[1:04:22] your table lights today like lights on
[1:04:24] your table lights burning he said that's
[1:04:27] christians and darkness giving light
[1:04:32] hallelujah and it can get as dark as it
[1:04:34] wants to but it'll never put out the
[1:04:36] light
[1:04:37] the only time this light is going to go
[1:04:39] out is when this light is moved from
[1:04:42] this mass of darkness into eternal light
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:04:46] hallelujah amen so every devil in hell
[1:04:49] can gather its forces it can gather
[1:04:51] everything it wants they can gather all
[1:04:53] the sin it wants together he can gather
[1:04:56] all the doubt it wants together he can
[1:04:58] gather all the fear he wants together
[1:05:00] it'll never put out that little light
[1:05:02] that's shining yonder and shining the
[1:05:04] under and shouting yonder it can blow
[1:05:07] against it he can howl against it he can
[1:05:09] push against it but it'll never put out
[1:05:11] the light
[1:05:12] the only way this light is going out is
[1:05:15] getting taken out by the presence of
[1:05:17] almighty god
[1:05:19] and he would say up above us is the holy
[1:05:21] spirit amen there's the realms of holy
[1:05:23] spirit there's the rams of the angels
[1:05:25] and then there's god himself and he said
[1:05:27] below amen there's devils and and and
[1:05:29] there's there's a place where jesus went
[1:05:31] and ministered to the souls that were
[1:05:33] lost in prison he said then there's
[1:05:35] devils and then there's hell so there's
[1:05:37] three above us and there's three above
[1:05:39] us he would call it the trinity of
[1:05:40] heaven and the trinity of hell he said
[1:05:43] so the darkness is being influenced from
[1:05:45] somewhere
[1:05:47] there's a connection that has taken
[1:05:49] place in this realm of life that we're
[1:05:51] living in that darkness that's here is
[1:05:54] being connected being connected from
[1:05:56] somewhere he said when the debt when the
[1:05:58] spirits of evil are showed out upon
[1:06:00] people they're being influenced from
[1:06:03] somewhere there is a connection that is
[1:06:05] there
[1:06:06] give me a little bit more there is a
[1:06:08] connection that is there amen that
[1:06:11] they're they're they're pulling from
[1:06:12] this something it's feeding that desire
[1:06:15] something is pushing that desire
[1:06:17] something is pushing listen people are
[1:06:19] not becoming what they're becoming
[1:06:21] because they want to become what they
[1:06:22] want to become people are becoming what
[1:06:25] they're becoming because there's an
[1:06:26] influence that is influencing their
[1:06:28] lives there's a connection that has
[1:06:30] taken place and they're being drawn
[1:06:33] they're drawing from a source
[1:06:37] amen homosexuals are drawing from afar
[1:06:39] as far from a source they're they're not
[1:06:42] you know they say well i just want to be
[1:06:43] what i want to be they're being what
[1:06:45] demons want them to be
[1:06:47] [Applause]
[1:06:49] amen you know nobody can be what they
[1:06:51] want to be you're influenced from one
[1:06:53] way or another you're connected from one
[1:06:55] place or another
[1:06:57] amen
[1:06:58] you know people you got this idea well
[1:07:00] i'm going to be what i want to be no
[1:07:02] you'll never be what you want to be
[1:07:05] amen he said there's darkness he said a
[1:07:09] sinner influenced by a spirit because he
[1:07:12] has a spirit
[1:07:14] but at the wrong influence there's a
[1:07:16] wrong influence the wrong that gives
[1:07:18] influence and a right that gives
[1:07:20] influence and those who are dominated
[1:07:22] with blackness and separation and things
[1:07:25] of that nature are dominated from the
[1:07:27] underworld of devils
[1:07:32] but the first thing you know he said
[1:07:33] you're going another place
[1:07:35] a whole conglomeration of blackness and
[1:07:38] darkness but there's these little lights
[1:07:40] flashing off
[1:07:42] and burning he said that's a christian
[1:07:44] born again light
[1:07:46] you are a light that's set on a hill
[1:07:50] do you notice where he puts you on a
[1:07:51] hill
[1:07:53] he wants the whole world to see you amen
[1:07:55] a candle that's set in a room that gives
[1:07:57] light to all the room that's what a
[1:07:59] christian is among darkness you're
[1:08:01] supposed you're supposed to shine when
[1:08:04] it's dark
[1:08:06] if you're not shining and people don't
[1:08:08] know a difference that means you ain't
[1:08:10] got much light
[1:08:12] if you're fitting in with the world and
[1:08:14] they don't think they don't notice that
[1:08:16] you're a christian and they don't they
[1:08:17] don't notice anything different about
[1:08:19] you that means you don't have much light
[1:08:23] you're blending in with what's around
[1:08:25] you you're becoming what's around you
[1:08:27] and pretty soon you won't be able to
[1:08:29] tell is that this one or who is that
[1:08:31] what is that i see nothing but darkness
[1:08:33] but when there's a light burning on the
[1:08:35] inside of you it don't take much to
[1:08:37] realize there's something different
[1:08:38] about you amen they're not like all
[1:08:41] these other people amen i want i believe
[1:08:43] that even the light tabernacle ought to
[1:08:44] be a church that there's something
[1:08:46] different about that church they ain't
[1:08:48] like all the other churches they don't
[1:08:50] they don't do like they don't worship
[1:08:52] like all the other churches
[1:08:54] amen there's something about them that's
[1:08:56] different what is it there is an
[1:08:58] influence
[1:09:00] same as there's a spirit from the
[1:09:02] underworld that's influencing people and
[1:09:04] you see it on their bodies you see it on
[1:09:06] their actions you see it in their
[1:09:08] thoughts you see it in murders and rapes
[1:09:10] and every kind of thing they're being
[1:09:11] influenced from another world but so is
[1:09:14] this light this light is also connected
[1:09:17] to another world
[1:09:18] and it's pushing the energy or the life
[1:09:21] down into that light
[1:09:25] why don't i act like that i can't help
[1:09:26] it because i'm connected to a source i'm
[1:09:29] connected to a body
[1:09:34] hallelujah
[1:09:37] the wicked
[1:09:38] or the unbeliever is influenced from
[1:09:40] beneath
[1:09:42] from hell
[1:09:45] there's evil
[1:09:46] powers it goes again to about about the
[1:09:49] trinity
[1:09:50] of hell and all the things that are
[1:09:52] there
[1:09:54] and then it goes into the influence
[1:09:57] of the upper world
[1:09:59] amen he said the christians are also
[1:10:02] influenced by spirit too
[1:10:05] the holy spirit
[1:10:08] so there must be a connection that takes
[1:10:10] place
[1:10:12] to have this light there has to be a
[1:10:13] connection
[1:10:15] to a source
[1:10:16] or you'll never have light as we've been
[1:10:18] talking about it these light bulbs are
[1:10:20] worthless if they're not connected to a
[1:10:21] source that helps produce the light
[1:10:24] i mean they're nothing but something a
[1:10:26] piece of plastic or a little piece of
[1:10:28] whatever that makes it up amen it's
[1:10:30] lifeless it has no no no heating ability
[1:10:33] it has nothing unless it's connected to
[1:10:36] a source
[1:10:37] a source of strength
[1:10:39] a and brother brandon would talk about
[1:10:41] being the candle in the lighting of the
[1:10:43] candle and he says you cannot receive
[1:10:45] the baptism of the holy ghost without
[1:10:48] having experience when it happens
[1:10:51] he said well you say well i believe
[1:10:52] every respect of the word well then the
[1:10:54] word is laying there waiting for the
[1:10:57] holy spirit to light it or to make it
[1:11:00] work
[1:11:01] but it takes the lighting of the candle
[1:11:04] here's the candle with the wick in it
[1:11:06] and with all the tallow everything
[1:11:08] around it and the wick looking just as
[1:11:10] pretty but until the fire comes upon it
[1:11:13] it'll never shine
[1:11:16] no matter how perfect the candle is no
[1:11:18] matter how pretty the candle is or how
[1:11:20] beautiful the candle is it's got to be
[1:11:22] lit to burn
[1:11:25] i mean that's that's pretty simple but
[1:11:28] when you believe and you're made up of
[1:11:30] the instructions of what the holy spirit
[1:11:31] is and things love joy peace lord
[1:11:33] suffering the fruits of the spirit it'll
[1:11:35] bear out but until
[1:11:38] that holy spirit with a fiery experience
[1:11:41] comes down and lights that candle then
[1:11:44] you hadn't received the holy ghost
[1:11:50] well i believe the word well have you
[1:11:52] had the experience coming down and
[1:11:54] lighting your candle
[1:11:57] you didn't go out there on that building
[1:11:58] out there we just put up it's a
[1:11:59] beautiful building looks lovely i mean
[1:12:02] everything looks so pretty and
[1:12:03] everything and there's wires hanging
[1:12:05] down from it
[1:12:07] you can grab them wires right now and
[1:12:09] you can touch them to your tone
[1:12:12] if you trust me
[1:12:17] they've never been connected up to the
[1:12:18] source yet
[1:12:20] they look like wires they act like wires
[1:12:22] in the sense of of having the copper and
[1:12:25] the coating and the white and the black
[1:12:27] and the neutral and the ground and the
[1:12:29] hot wire and the yellow covering and
[1:12:31] they got it all
[1:12:33] but there's no life inside of it
[1:12:35] but there's going to come a day that if
[1:12:37] you walk up there and put it to your
[1:12:38] tongue you're going to feel something
[1:12:41] there's going to be something that takes
[1:12:42] place or you can put it to your hands
[1:12:44] wherever there's going to be a life
[1:12:46] inside that wow
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:52] and it'll do something it'll it'll
[1:12:53] illuminate a fan it'll illuminate amen a
[1:12:56] light it'll it'll bring something to
[1:12:58] life but until it's connected to the
[1:13:00] sword it's nothing but dead works
[1:13:05] we work to put it up we work to put it
[1:13:07] there and we've done this and we've done
[1:13:09] that but until it's connected to a
[1:13:11] source it'll never turn a fan
[1:13:14] it'll never make a light burn it'll
[1:13:16] never make nothing work and that's the
[1:13:18] same thing with the word of god you can
[1:13:20] put it all there you can put it all
[1:13:22] together you can have it down pat you
[1:13:24] can quote it backwards upwards upside
[1:13:26] down every kind of way but until you are
[1:13:28] connected to the source it'll never work
[1:13:32] but when it's connected to the source
[1:13:34] it'll work every time
[1:13:37] it'll heal the sin it'll save the laws
[1:13:40] it'll turn the backslider back to
[1:13:42] repentance it'll destroy the works of
[1:13:44] the devil it'll can't say to now
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:51] has to be a connection
[1:13:53] a match
[1:13:55] it has
[1:13:56] to touch the wick
[1:13:59] you can light the match you can have a
[1:14:01] match burning but it will never make
[1:14:04] that candle
[1:14:05] burn until you touch it
[1:14:07] has to be a touch a connection made
[1:14:12] amen we can see in acts chapter 2 and
[1:14:15] verse 1.
[1:14:17] so when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:14:19] calm they were with all one accord all
[1:14:22] one accord in one place and suddenly
[1:14:24] there came a sound from heaven as a
[1:14:26] rushing mighty wind and it filled all
[1:14:29] the house where they were sitting and
[1:14:31] there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[1:14:33] like as of fire
[1:14:38] see the lord wanted more than to just
[1:14:40] lead you by fire
[1:14:42] i mean he has a pillow fire it's still
[1:14:44] here
[1:14:45] amen is still witnesses it's still being
[1:14:47] witnessed but he didn't want the pi the
[1:14:50] fire on the outside of it he wanted to
[1:14:51] put it on the inside of you
[1:14:54] amen that same tongue that same pillar
[1:14:56] of fire and it set upon each of them so
[1:14:59] there was a connection that was made
[1:15:02] amen and they were all filled with the
[1:15:04] holy ghost and began to speak with other
[1:15:06] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:15:08] utterance and we have the same
[1:15:10] opportunity to be connected to the same
[1:15:13] source
[1:15:17] amen well
[1:15:19] well let me read it to you padma's
[1:15:20] vision how threatening it is to think of
[1:15:23] those seven lamps drawing life and light
[1:15:26] from the resource of that main bowl
[1:15:28] because they had their whip with their
[1:15:29] wicks dipped into it each church aged
[1:15:32] messenger is depicted here his life is
[1:15:35] on fire with the holy ghost his wick his
[1:15:38] life has been immersed in christ though
[1:15:40] that wick he is through that wick is
[1:15:42] drawing the very life of christ and that
[1:15:45] life is giving light to the church what
[1:15:48] kind of light is he given the very same
[1:15:50] light that lit the first lamp
[1:15:53] and right on down to every age and the
[1:15:56] last day messenger the same life the
[1:15:58] same light is manifested by life as hid
[1:16:01] with christ and god you say well that's
[1:16:03] wonderful every messenger hallelujah
[1:16:06] not only do we speak thus of the
[1:16:08] messengers
[1:16:10] but every true believer is
[1:16:13] dramatically depicted here too
[1:16:18] they are all drawing from the same
[1:16:21] source
[1:16:23] well i wish i was back in this
[1:16:26] i wish i was back in the days of paul i
[1:16:28] wish i was back in the days of one of
[1:16:30] the messengers i wish i was 60 years ago
[1:16:32] and i could have that you can have the
[1:16:34] same source
[1:16:36] we have the
[1:16:37] ability to dip our lives in the same
[1:16:41] source and when the first life was
[1:16:43] dipped into this source and those 120
[1:16:46] begin to fill that surge of power
[1:16:50] how many has ever hurt felt the surge of
[1:16:51] just electrical power
[1:16:54] how many has ever been shot
[1:16:56] well it looks like almost 100 percent of
[1:16:58] us if you hadn't you ought to try it
[1:17:03] it'll light your life
[1:17:09] squeal holler
[1:17:12] scream
[1:17:14] carry on like a madman
[1:17:17] thing about that you're trying to get
[1:17:18] loose from it
[1:17:21] amen because they say it don't it don't
[1:17:23] exactly feel good
[1:17:24] but i guarantee you you know there's
[1:17:26] some there's some life there
[1:17:29] and i guarantee you haven't experienced
[1:17:31] you've had that experience you don't
[1:17:33] ever have to question it again you don't
[1:17:35] have to have to look at it and say well
[1:17:36] was it there well did it really happen
[1:17:38] no i know it was happy it happened i was
[1:17:41] there when it happened i felt the church
[1:17:43] through my body i felt it illuminate me
[1:17:50] i was there and you wonder why we get a
[1:17:52] little emotional you wonder why we
[1:17:54] scream and shout we get to run it around
[1:17:58] you grab a hold of this wire one time
[1:18:00] for yourself then you'll know why
[1:18:02] [Applause]
[1:18:05] you grab it for yourself and then you'll
[1:18:07] understand why somebody gets so
[1:18:09] overwhelmed they can't hold it no more
[1:18:11] and they begin to shout the praises of
[1:18:13] almighty god why it ain't some 120 vote
[1:18:16] they got to hold up they got a hold of
[1:18:18] the throne of almighty god and the
[1:18:20] source of life is pulsating their body
[1:18:28] you grab a hold of it
[1:18:30] and then you'll know why we shout
[1:18:33] you'll know why we run
[1:18:35] you'll know why there's something on
[1:18:38] well i just ain't emotional
[1:18:41] great let's find out how many says that
[1:18:43] all right ain't nobody gonna raise their
[1:18:44] hand right now
[1:18:46] if i get somebody to raise your hand
[1:18:48] that says i ain't emotional okay let's
[1:18:50] grab something
[1:18:51] some metal let's stick it in one of them
[1:18:53] plugs right over there
[1:18:56] let's see if you if you're not emotional
[1:18:58] that means you're dead
[1:19:03] you know where you belong in a morgue
[1:19:06] maybe in a seven six foot grave pushing
[1:19:09] up daisies because apparently you're
[1:19:11] dead
[1:19:12] or apparently there's something wrong
[1:19:13] with your body that has no receptors
[1:19:16] amen you know there's actually people
[1:19:19] there's actually i was talking about
[1:19:21] this yesterday there's actually a um
[1:19:24] a disease
[1:19:26] that goes that actually can attack your
[1:19:28] body to where you can't feel electricity
[1:19:32] why don't the devil know how to do stuff
[1:19:35] you can't feel it you can't it doesn't
[1:19:37] do anything there's been people that
[1:19:39] they hooked them up to prods and things
[1:19:40] and they just sit there and act like
[1:19:42] ain't nothing happening
[1:19:44] and if you got hooked up to it you'd be
[1:19:46] shouting you'd be carrying on because
[1:19:48] there's a receptor inside of you said
[1:19:49] hey
[1:19:51] there's something happening there that
[1:19:52] ain't supposed to happen
[1:19:54] now we're talking about physically
[1:19:57] amen but
[1:19:58] what's also in the physical realm is
[1:20:00] also in the spiritual realm there's also
[1:20:02] a spiritual disease apparently that gets
[1:20:05] on people's souls and lives until the
[1:20:07] presence of god can fall and their
[1:20:09] receptors are so tore up by that spirit
[1:20:11] that they cannot react because they
[1:20:13] don't know what's even happening
[1:20:19] hey man i heard a story of a man that
[1:20:21] they could stand there and i don't know
[1:20:23] if you've ever tried it it hurts
[1:20:25] i mean how many mechanics are people
[1:20:27] that wants to be a mechanic or thought
[1:20:28] about being a mechanic let's change your
[1:20:30] mind
[1:20:31] grab a hold of a spark plug
[1:20:33] spark plug wire and pull it off of there
[1:20:35] and just see if let me see if there's a
[1:20:36] little spark
[1:20:37] pull that engine and you got a hold of
[1:20:39] that metal on the end handle that dude
[1:20:41] it'll light you up
[1:20:43] it'll make you jump it'll make you shout
[1:20:46] it'll make you scream might run around
[1:20:48] that mower or whatever you're working on
[1:20:49] it cause what man it hurt
[1:20:51] but i've heard a man that was able to
[1:20:53] hold a car running and pull a spark plug
[1:20:56] off and hold it to their hand and not
[1:20:58] even feel it
[1:21:00] and another person walk up and say how
[1:21:02] you doing he reached over there and
[1:21:04] touched him on the nose and a blue flame
[1:21:06] leave his finger and hit him right on
[1:21:07] the nose
[1:21:11] and he felt it
[1:21:13] jumped back and screamed and said what
[1:21:15] do you think you're doing
[1:21:17] his receptors wasn't messed up
[1:21:20] come on somebody
[1:21:22] amen i don't want about say god
[1:21:24] electrify my life whatever's gotta be if
[1:21:26] you got to go in there and you got to
[1:21:28] change the whole makeup of me whatever
[1:21:30] you got to do i want to know when the
[1:21:32] presence of god is falling i want to
[1:21:34] know when the power of god is moving in
[1:21:36] his people i want to be able to respond
[1:21:38] to it
[1:21:45] every true believer is dramatically
[1:21:47] depicted here
[1:21:49] they are all drawing from the same
[1:21:51] source
[1:21:52] because they all have to be dipped in
[1:21:54] the same bowl and they're dead to
[1:21:56] themselves and their lives are hidden
[1:21:58] christ and god they're sealed in by the
[1:22:00] holy ghost ephesians 4 grieve not the
[1:22:02] holy spirit of god whereby whereby
[1:22:04] you're sealed into the day of redemption
[1:22:06] now no man can pluck them out of his
[1:22:08] hand their lives cannot be tampered with
[1:22:14] take that devil
[1:22:18] no man can pluck them out of his hand
[1:22:20] their lives cannot be tampered with the
[1:22:23] visible life is burning and shining and
[1:22:26] giving life and manifestations of the
[1:22:28] holy ghost and the inner invisible life
[1:22:31] is hidden in guard and fed by the lord's
[1:22:34] word satan cannot touch them
[1:22:39] oh praise the lord satan cannot touch
[1:22:41] them not even death can touch them for
[1:22:44] death has lost his stay and the grave
[1:22:47] has lost his victory thanks be to god we
[1:22:50] have the victory in christ jesus our
[1:22:53] lord
[1:22:57] but there has to be a connection
[1:22:59] there has to be a source
[1:23:01] there has to be something to draw from
[1:23:04] every person in this line of life
[1:23:08] if we get i'm trying to
[1:23:09] get the picture as a line and it's a
[1:23:12] the river of life
[1:23:14] every person in that body or in that
[1:23:17] body of water we could say it like that
[1:23:20] it's connected to something
[1:23:23] every person
[1:23:25] look at your neighbor and say every
[1:23:26] person
[1:23:28] everyone
[1:23:29] everyone 7 billion
[1:23:32] right now upon the earth is connected to
[1:23:35] a source that's right
[1:23:40] up above us
[1:23:43] is heaven
[1:23:45] and heavenly things
[1:23:46] all the way up to god
[1:23:49] down below
[1:23:50] is darkness
[1:23:52] it's regions of the lost demons and hell
[1:23:56] and everyone in this life is connected
[1:23:59] to one or the other
[1:24:03] and your eternal destination rests on
[1:24:05] where you're connected to
[1:24:08] now there is proof in this life already
[1:24:11] and now in this church that there were
[1:24:14] some here sitting there many of us all
[1:24:16] of us because we was all born in sin
[1:24:17] shape let me get that right all of us
[1:24:19] were born shaped
[1:24:20] born and sin shaped and iniquity so we
[1:24:22] came into this life channel connected
[1:24:24] from below
[1:24:26] but there was a power that broke the
[1:24:29] connection
[1:24:31] and once that broke that connection is
[1:24:34] broke i want you to understand something
[1:24:36] it don't ever have to be connected again
[1:24:39] now it can be connected again and it has
[1:24:41] been connected again but it don't have
[1:24:43] to be connected again but there's
[1:24:45] another power that wants to connect to
[1:24:47] you and to push life into your body life
[1:24:51] into your soul
[1:24:52] life into your thoughts life into your
[1:24:54] work life into your everyday life i mean
[1:24:57] light pushing out
[1:25:03] john chapter 15 and verse 5 says i am
[1:25:06] the vine
[1:25:07] ye are the branches
[1:25:11] now let me look this is very this is all
[1:25:13] very simple this morning but
[1:25:16] we read that we just skim over it as far
[1:25:18] as i know
[1:25:19] in my limited education maybe there's
[1:25:21] somebody with a higher education here
[1:25:24] but unless that branch has been cut off
[1:25:26] it's connected to the vine
[1:25:29] so the life of that that vine is flowing
[1:25:32] through the branch
[1:25:35] now brother brown would talk about the
[1:25:36] the the citrus tree that he saw with all
[1:25:39] the different fruits on it and there you
[1:25:41] can actually take other lives of the
[1:25:43] same kind of family and graft them in he
[1:25:46] and he talks about these these churches
[1:25:48] being grafted in and but they're not of
[1:25:50] the original life
[1:25:52] he said but when that vine gives out
[1:25:54] another branch it's going to bring forth
[1:25:56] of the original life amen because it
[1:25:59] can't help it if it's a peach it's going
[1:26:01] to bear for the peach
[1:26:02] if it's an orange it's going to bear
[1:26:03] forth an orange if it's a tomato it's
[1:26:05] going to bear forth a tomato it's going
[1:26:07] to bring forth whatever is in the roots
[1:26:10] amen and this is exactly what's taking
[1:26:12] place in this life you see where you
[1:26:14] very quickly you can find out what
[1:26:16] people are because of who they're
[1:26:17] connected to
[1:26:19] and what they're connected to
[1:26:25] i heard something very good today that
[1:26:27] all of us could use a little checkup
[1:26:30] he's on the christian radios listen to
[1:26:32] some christian music on the way in
[1:26:35] man come on there with a little
[1:26:37] with a little uh bible
[1:26:39] uh
[1:26:40] charge i guess or whatever
[1:26:42] just a very quick charge and he says you
[1:26:44] know he said in the time that we're
[1:26:46] living in satan and i'm just
[1:26:48] paraphrasing satan has programmed us to
[1:26:50] look down
[1:26:53] he gave us something to look at
[1:26:56] i'm guilty of it every one of us is
[1:26:57] guilty of our phones
[1:27:01] he said but a christian is not
[1:27:02] programmed to look down a christian is
[1:27:04] programmed to look up
[1:27:11] amen
[1:27:12] and he said what is it because in
[1:27:14] looking down you start looking at all
[1:27:16] the anything he take talks about and
[1:27:18] it's true there's a lot of good things
[1:27:19] there
[1:27:21] but we're not careful we get connected
[1:27:22] to the wrong things
[1:27:24] and before we know it we spend hours and
[1:27:26] hours on the wrong things
[1:27:28] when our eyes ought to be looking up for
[1:27:30] our redemptions drawing nigh
[1:27:32] amen he said i am the vine you are the
[1:27:35] branches he that abideth in me and i in
[1:27:37] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:27:40] for without me ye can do nothing
[1:27:44] amen
[1:27:45] this goes for any minister goes for any
[1:27:47] church goes for any people without him
[1:27:50] you're nothing
[1:27:52] goes forever father goes forever mother
[1:27:54] goes for every child goes for every
[1:27:56] person that's trying to make yourself
[1:27:58] something without him you're nothing
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:02] he says oh i'm going to be this and i'm
[1:28:04] going to be there without christ you are
[1:28:06] nothing
[1:28:11] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:28:13] forth as a branches we heard wednesday
[1:28:15] night god does not like fruitless trees
[1:28:21] and it's withered and the man gathered
[1:28:22] and cast them into the fire and they are
[1:28:24] burned
[1:28:25] but if you abide in me and my words
[1:28:27] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[1:28:29] and it shall be done unto you now i want
[1:28:31] you to understand as we're taught here
[1:28:33] it's not so how many tapes i'm listening
[1:28:35] to how many i got to buy it in them i
[1:28:36] got to buy it in the mail we're not in
[1:28:38] reference
[1:28:39] reformation and all that and i ain't
[1:28:41] spent 12 hours a day in prayer that's
[1:28:43] not no it's the holy ghost living on the
[1:28:45] inside of you
[1:28:46] it'll direct you in a prayer life it'll
[1:28:48] direct you and take life it'll direct
[1:28:50] you into bible life it'll direct you in
[1:28:52] all those things that is abiding and
[1:28:54] when you have the holy ghost inside of
[1:28:57] you then you can ask what you will
[1:29:01] and it'll be given
[1:29:08] and placed there and jehovah jireh
[1:29:12] he said jesus will come to this platform
[1:29:14] and these people will produce the same
[1:29:15] kind of life and do the same things that
[1:29:18] he did here on earth we accept him for
[1:29:20] your needs will you raise your hands to
[1:29:21] him say i'll accept him for my needs
[1:29:23] lord bless you
[1:29:25] he said brother branham aren't you
[1:29:26] afraid to make that kind of statement no
[1:29:29] sir he promised it and it's his promise
[1:29:32] and he will bring it to pass
[1:29:34] no matter anything contrary to it i say
[1:29:36] it anything contrary to that i say it's
[1:29:39] a lie god said so that settles it god is
[1:29:41] the same jesus is the same the works are
[1:29:44] the same his life is the same he acts
[1:29:47] the same he acts in you as if he would
[1:29:50] when he was here on earth
[1:29:53] if you're connected to the vine
[1:29:56] and what he did say ye are the vine i i
[1:30:00] am the vine ye are the branches
[1:30:07] and then you also see the other tree
[1:30:09] bringing forth fruit
[1:30:10] there was two trees in the garden right
[1:30:13] tree of life and the tree of good and
[1:30:15] evil
[1:30:16] so you also see when it puts out another
[1:30:18] branch
[1:30:19] it's of the same life
[1:30:22] we you know we focus on the tree of life
[1:30:24] and that's our that's our message but
[1:30:25] don't forget there's a tree of good and
[1:30:27] evil as well amen and when it puts out
[1:30:29] it's still the same life that's why you
[1:30:32] can see people that would stand there
[1:30:33] and curse him and mock him and make fun
[1:30:35] of him and 2000 years again and doing it
[1:30:38] all over again why it's of the same
[1:30:40] branch of the same vine
[1:30:42] it's of the same life it's coming from
[1:30:44] underneath
[1:30:47] amen he talks about the tree of life he
[1:30:49] said the roots of that tree goes all the
[1:30:51] way up through all those realms and
[1:30:53] wraps around the throne of god
[1:30:56] it has a source it has a strength it has
[1:30:58] a light and it feeds the body it's fed
[1:31:00] him now for two thousand years and it
[1:31:02] hasn't run out of strength
[1:31:06] we can rejoice we got strength for the
[1:31:08] journey as we heard sunday ago he's our
[1:31:11] shady eye
[1:31:12] he hasn't run out of strength he hasn't
[1:31:15] run out of peace and joy and happiness
[1:31:17] and healing and deliverance and he has
[1:31:19] it and he never will
[1:31:28] but we see those vines
[1:31:31] running through scripture
[1:31:33] twins of every revival
[1:31:36] i mean goodness you can go through all
[1:31:38] of them
[1:31:39] the branch is energized by the life of
[1:31:42] the vine
[1:31:43] therefore jesus
[1:31:45] has no lips tonight on earth but mine
[1:31:48] and yours
[1:31:50] he has no eyes
[1:31:52] but mine and yours now if this is for
[1:31:54] the tree of life it's also true for the
[1:31:56] tree of good and evil the devil has no
[1:31:59] lips but who gives it to him
[1:32:02] he has no voice but who gives it to him
[1:32:05] he has no life no abilities but who
[1:32:07] yields their body as his temple
[1:32:12] that's why you see all the piercings
[1:32:14] that's going on and people changing
[1:32:16] themselves and i mean people going
[1:32:18] through crazy amounts of surgery to look
[1:32:20] like cats and dogs
[1:32:24] and then we've got to change our whole
[1:32:26] school system as we talked about here a
[1:32:28] while back of of a woman that stood up
[1:32:30] and said look i quit
[1:32:32] so when i when a when a teacher gets
[1:32:35] gets fired or put on on leave because
[1:32:38] she wouldn't me meow back to a child
[1:32:40] that re
[1:32:41] identified themselves as a cat said i'm
[1:32:43] done
[1:32:47] this world is crazy
[1:32:51] and if you don't think it's crazy that
[1:32:53] means you're crazy with it
[1:32:59] cause people ain't crazy unless they
[1:33:01] different from you
[1:33:03] as long as they act like you they ain't
[1:33:05] crazy
[1:33:09] they might be but you don't know that
[1:33:11] because you right there with them and
[1:33:13] you acting like them just like them and
[1:33:15] you're doing everything just like they
[1:33:17] do and you look at them say man that's a
[1:33:19] fine guy
[1:33:21] that is awesome
[1:33:23] and somebody over here is looking at
[1:33:24] both of you saying you're a bunch of
[1:33:26] crazy idiots
[1:33:28] nuts
[1:33:30] the world don't think they're crazy
[1:33:32] apparently they think the sanity to
[1:33:34] believe in the things they believe in
[1:33:36] and they got all kinds of them to
[1:33:38] believe the same thing if you think the
[1:33:39] world and the majority has a sane mind
[1:33:42] you've lost your mind
[1:33:46] you're in the same boat with them
[1:33:48] amen
[1:33:49] and if you think this world is okay
[1:33:53] if you think this world is just fine
[1:33:55] there's something wrong with you
[1:33:57] you're connected to the same source that
[1:34:00] the world is connected to and this world
[1:34:02] is going to burn
[1:34:04] [Applause]
[1:34:06] that's not my words that's thus saith
[1:34:08] the lord
[1:34:09] read it right here
[1:34:11] you say well it ain't come to pass well
[1:34:13] look how many prophecies has come to
[1:34:14] pass what makes you think that one ain't
[1:34:23] the devil has eyes on this earth
[1:34:25] he has voices on this earth
[1:34:29] he has spirits that overtake people to
[1:34:31] the point that they can speak out of
[1:34:33] them
[1:34:35] come in a prayer line
[1:34:38] be there lay your hands on them and hear
[1:34:39] them
[1:34:44] it's
[1:34:44] real you want to go around life and
[1:34:47] think they ain't nothing real they ain't
[1:34:48] no god well i can tell you one thing
[1:34:50] there's a devil
[1:34:54] amen if there's a devil there has to be
[1:34:56] a god
[1:35:02] he has no hands but mine and yours he
[1:35:05] energizes us and brings forth his life
[1:35:08] as he brings it through us
[1:35:10] whether it's by preaching the gospel by
[1:35:12] lips or seeing the vision by eye whether
[1:35:15] whatever it is laying hands on the sick
[1:35:17] is christ working through the branches
[1:35:20] of his church every office literally
[1:35:23] electrified
[1:35:25] by his
[1:35:26] presence hallelujah amen we're seeing
[1:35:29] the world being lit up by the sodom and
[1:35:31] gomorrah spirit and their lives are
[1:35:34] electrified by hell there's also a body
[1:35:37] here on this earth the body of jesus
[1:35:40] christ as been literally electrified by
[1:35:43] his presence
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:48] it's electrified
[1:35:54] how can i be lit up
[1:35:56] like that brother timothy it's very easy
[1:35:59] plug in
[1:36:05] it's very easy just plug it in
[1:36:08] man i'm looking for something i don't
[1:36:09] see nothing here
[1:36:12] yeah i
[1:36:13] better not go digging around in there
[1:36:14] then
[1:36:17] you're gonna have whatever kind of your
[1:36:19] sister can have every kind of advice
[1:36:21] appliance
[1:36:23] in your house
[1:36:24] and it can look just as pretty sitting
[1:36:26] on your cabinet or in your closet and
[1:36:28] you can bring it out and put it on your
[1:36:29] cabinet
[1:36:30] and you can push every button on it
[1:36:33] and sometimes
[1:36:34] you're like what is wrong with this
[1:36:36] machine
[1:36:37] this thing's stupid i just bought it
[1:36:39] ain't working
[1:36:41] no you ain't plugged it in yet
[1:36:44] i've did it before
[1:36:46] man you wiggle every knob on there and
[1:36:48] you try to
[1:36:50] what's wrong with you
[1:36:52] come on this thing's supposed to work
[1:36:54] i've used it many times what's wrong
[1:36:55] with it
[1:36:57] there's a plug on the back of it
[1:36:59] and apparently it's for a reason
[1:37:02] and apparently if you don't plug it in
[1:37:03] it's just going to sit there like a dead
[1:37:05] person
[1:37:06] like a dog like a knot on a log and just
[1:37:09] sit there and
[1:37:10] oh and i'll see what's wrong with a lot
[1:37:12] of people
[1:37:14] well i'm not emotional that means you're
[1:37:15] dead and if your religion is dead you
[1:37:17] need to bury it and get you a new one
[1:37:19] that's the prophet of god amen so in
[1:37:21] other words you need to grab a hold of
[1:37:22] your life and the lifeline and say god
[1:37:25] where's my socket at
[1:37:27] where's my place at i want to be plugged
[1:37:30] in to the presence of almighty car i
[1:37:32] want to be plugged into the healing flow
[1:37:35] i want to be plugged into joy and
[1:37:37] speakable and full of glory i want to be
[1:37:39] plugged in to the presence of almighty
[1:37:41] god
[1:37:42] [Applause]
[1:37:47] literally
[1:37:48] electrified by his presence
[1:37:51] i am the vine here the branches
[1:37:54] the vine does not bear fruit the vine
[1:37:56] only energizes the branch
[1:37:59] the branch bears fruit
[1:38:03] oh brother branham was here he was a
[1:38:05] branch
[1:38:08] he was not the vine
[1:38:12] i know some people want to make him the
[1:38:13] vine but he wasn't the vine
[1:38:15] the vine is jesus christ
[1:38:17] let's get that straight real quick the
[1:38:19] vine is jesus christ brother branham was
[1:38:22] a branch that sprung out amen as it
[1:38:24] would the branches of that that
[1:38:26] candlestick as they come out in that
[1:38:28] seventh church eight and lit up growing
[1:38:30] from the same source he is a branch
[1:38:35] so are ye branches
[1:38:37] so are ye lights
[1:38:39] so are you the presence of god can come
[1:38:41] and illuminate you as it did that branch
[1:38:46] why because you're connected to the same
[1:38:48] source
[1:38:50] the same power that illuminated william
[1:38:52] branham's life it's the same power in
[1:38:55] the church of the living god that's why
[1:38:57] we have the power over blood pressure
[1:39:00] and over cancer and over every demon of
[1:39:02] hell it has been given to us not by that
[1:39:05] branch but by the vine
[1:39:14] it's energized
[1:39:16] there's energy taking place
[1:39:18] if it's a pumpkin it'll bear pumpkin if
[1:39:20] it's a watermelon it'll bring forth the
[1:39:21] watermelon if it's a grape it'll bring
[1:39:23] forth a grape if the church is in christ
[1:39:26] it'll bear christ like spirits
[1:39:29] oh oh
[1:39:32] when you see those spirits in a church
[1:39:34] that wants to divide and conquer
[1:39:36] and wants to separate families
[1:39:39] that's not a christ-like church
[1:39:42] no no
[1:39:44] cry it'll have christ-like works
[1:39:46] it'll have christ-like faith
[1:39:49] if it's properly connected
[1:39:54] a good healthy vine not cut off hanging
[1:39:57] down with it away but a real healthy
[1:40:00] branch connected to a vine will bring
[1:40:02] forth
[1:40:06] fruit i don't say this to be
[1:40:08] embarrassing to anybody
[1:40:10] but one of the greatest trials
[1:40:13] in the building of this whole church
[1:40:15] was
[1:40:16] these lovely speakers up here
[1:40:21] sound is like air conditioning you know
[1:40:22] it can't make everybody happy
[1:40:25] and brothers do an amazing job up there
[1:40:27] and i wouldn't want their job i had it i
[1:40:29] didn't like it and i don't want it
[1:40:32] because once the it's cut you don't have
[1:40:34] to be connected no more
[1:40:36] except some people
[1:40:38] some people ain't going to let them be
[1:40:39] disconnected
[1:40:42] but we had issues as many of you know
[1:40:44] with these speakers we hung them where
[1:40:46] both said hang them we did what both
[1:40:48] said do and they sounded terrible
[1:40:50] you could come in here and you could sit
[1:40:52] over there and be a wonderful one
[1:40:53] service the next service couldn't hear a
[1:40:55] thing go over here same thing over here
[1:40:57] be too loud over there be not loud
[1:40:58] enough and we're just having a fit then
[1:41:00] poor brothers i don't know how they
[1:41:01] ain't gray-headed today
[1:41:04] i got those strands right up in there
[1:41:05] just because of that
[1:41:08] and we're wondering what in the world
[1:41:09] we're trying everything we tried to put
[1:41:11] extra speakers try to do everything we
[1:41:12] could do we tried to we tried to buy
[1:41:15] whatever we had to buy whatever we had
[1:41:17] to do to make it make it work
[1:41:19] finally we got a hold of somebody
[1:41:20] against brother mike working through the
[1:41:22] people we bought it through got a hold
[1:41:23] of bows they sent their main engineer
[1:41:25] who had designed these things he came
[1:41:27] into this building
[1:41:28] and he began to walk up and down that
[1:41:30] aisle right there he turned on a certain
[1:41:32] kind of noise some kind of noise they
[1:41:34] listened to to hear all the frequencies
[1:41:36] and he walked up that aisle he walked
[1:41:38] back down and he walked back up and he
[1:41:40] turned back around he said i bet every
[1:41:42] dollar i got is right wired wrong
[1:41:51] wired wrong well you may wired wrong
[1:41:52] well we didn't know this bose is a
[1:41:54] little different
[1:41:56] it's got it's got i don't remember
[1:41:57] exactly now but it's not like a normal
[1:41:59] speakers
[1:42:00] normal would be positive negative
[1:42:01] positive negative bose did something
[1:42:03] like positive negative negative positive
[1:42:05] and so two of the wires were wired
[1:42:07] backwards in every every main every
[1:42:09] speaker everything and it was causing
[1:42:11] all the issues we had you know what it
[1:42:12] took it took an engineer who had
[1:42:14] engineered it and he come in with a
[1:42:16] little screwdriver in 10 minutes and he
[1:42:18] fixed it right it was all perfect
[1:42:21] and he said set it back to manufacturer
[1:42:23] settings we set it back in this whole
[1:42:25] room filled with music and it was so
[1:42:27] wonderful and it's so pleasant and it
[1:42:29] was so great and i was like wow it's
[1:42:31] amazing what the man who designed it can
[1:42:33] do
[1:42:35] he knows it inside and out he put every
[1:42:37] speaker he lined it all up he these
[1:42:40] speakers are called room that match
[1:42:42] speakers they're they got certain horns
[1:42:44] i don't i'm not i'm not educating all
[1:42:46] that but i understand it's got certain
[1:42:47] horns that point certain directions to
[1:42:49] have amen a perfect sound in every part
[1:42:52] of the building and we have we've been
[1:42:54] blessed by those things and and it but
[1:42:56] it wasn't working but the engineer that
[1:42:58] designed it came and he said i know
[1:43:00] what's wrong and i know how to fix it
[1:43:03] and he took the screwdriver and he
[1:43:05] changed over those wires and he said now
[1:43:07] set it back to what i had it in the
[1:43:09] beginning
[1:43:11] and in the beginning it'll produce it
[1:43:13] now
[1:43:15] hallelujah amen churches have come down
[1:43:18] through 2 000 years and they wired it
[1:43:20] wrong and they put this over here they
[1:43:22] didn't read the manual
[1:43:24] they didn't read what the bible said but
[1:43:26] the presence of god came in this age and
[1:43:29] it said this thing's supposed to make a
[1:43:31] certain sound it's supposed to sound a
[1:43:33] certain way
[1:43:35] hallelujah angels bring down the tool
[1:43:38] chairs bring down and come here and send
[1:43:41] it back to factory settings
[1:43:44] set it back to what it was in the
[1:43:45] beginning because it'll sound the same
[1:43:48] as it did in the beginning because it
[1:43:50] came from the same branch from the same
[1:43:53] vine
[1:43:56] hallelujah maybe this morning your your
[1:43:59] voice and your life is not sounding out
[1:44:02] you got high spots you got low spots you

[1:44:40] i think brother brother henry greene
[1:44:42] said something like this he said god
[1:44:45] started his church in the beginning like
[1:44:47] he wanted it
[1:44:49] and now he wants his church like he
[1:44:51] started
[1:44:55] brother brandon would say over and over
[1:44:56] he said when if that vine ever puts
[1:44:59] forth another branch
[1:45:00] it'll have the same life it'll have the
[1:45:02] same power it'll have the same
[1:45:04] everything
[1:45:06] it'll be the same light
[1:45:08] it'll be moving it'll be pulsating it'll
[1:45:10] be energizing there'll be something
[1:45:12] taking place in that church amen it
[1:45:14] won't be a church of dead works and dead
[1:45:16] letter and sitting like a dead stump on
[1:45:19] the law or dad's bumping the law it
[1:45:21] won't be sitting like that there'll be
[1:45:22] something pulsating on the inside it'll
[1:45:24] be a lie amen be like that spring the
[1:45:27] brother brandon would walk to he said
[1:45:28] are you bubbling because i'm here are
[1:45:30] you bubbling because a deer drink from
[1:45:32] you are you bubbling because the birds
[1:45:34] come down and they say he said if that
[1:45:36] spring could ever speak out it said i'm
[1:45:39] bubbling not because you're here not
[1:45:41] because of the deer not because of the
[1:45:43] birds i'm bubbling because there's
[1:45:44] something underneath me that's pushing
[1:45:47] out
[1:45:49] amen maybe you're on the stream this
[1:45:50] morning you wonder what's wrong with
[1:45:52] that church what's going on there what's
[1:45:54] happening there i can tell you what's up
[1:45:56] we've been connected to the same source
[1:45:59] that peter was connected to
[1:46:02] therefore we can walk to the same gate
[1:46:04] and lay me and be walking there and sit
[1:46:06] there and say in the name of jesus
[1:46:08] christ rise up and walk
[1:46:10] and they throw down the cigarettes and
[1:46:12] they throw down the drinking and they
[1:46:14] walk away from it why it's the same
[1:46:17] source
[1:46:19] is somebody with me this morning ye are
[1:46:22] the lights
[1:46:27] christ is in his church
[1:46:29] it'll bear christ like spirits
[1:46:36] christ like worst works
[1:46:39] christ like faith so how do we get it to
[1:46:41] where now
[1:46:42] we don't need what they had back then
[1:46:46] well then you're not an original bra a
[1:46:47] branch
[1:46:49] you've been grafted in
[1:46:51] you're just like the church of christ
[1:46:53] you can call yourself a message i'll
[1:46:54] call you message of christ that'll help
[1:46:56] you feel better
[1:46:57] church of christ
[1:46:59] you can call yourself whatever you want
[1:47:00] to call yourself
[1:47:03] but if you ain't got that original life
[1:47:05] flowing through you
[1:47:06] you've been grafted in
[1:47:09] well we don't need
[1:47:11] pentecostal things we we got the
[1:47:13] fullness of the word
[1:47:15] and there's nothing but a bunch of dead
[1:47:16] letter
[1:47:21] i don't know who you might think we are
[1:47:23] you want to put us off as a bunch of
[1:47:25] emotionalists
[1:47:26] but we ain't rejecters of the word
[1:47:29] we didn't reject the word and just take
[1:47:31] a motion
[1:47:32] we accepted the word of god and we're
[1:47:35] rejoicing in the word of god
[1:47:37] i'm not rejoicing because i got a
[1:47:38] tingling i'm not rejoicing because i
[1:47:40] gotta feel good time i'm rejoicing

[1:47:50] opening of the word it revealed so many

[1:50:34] little rejoice in there
[1:50:38] [Applause]
[1:50:44] a vine connected
[1:50:46] to a branch a branch connected to the
[1:50:48] vine and jesus said when that happens
[1:50:51] the works that i do
[1:50:52] shall you do also
[1:50:55] because you know why
[1:50:57] it's the same life
[1:50:59] so it can't do different works
[1:51:02] or it's not the same life that's right
[1:51:04] yes sometimes that's just too simple to
[1:51:06] go
[1:51:08] people go well we got something
[1:51:09] different now we got this we got that
[1:51:11] and their lives are dead
[1:51:14] there's nothing coming from them no
[1:51:16] no from the fruits of the spirit
[1:51:19] no true brotherly kindness
[1:51:21] people can say they got brotherly
[1:51:22] kindness and treat you like a devil
[1:51:28] ain't true brother kindness that's an
[1:51:30] evil spirit you took
[1:51:35] given by a creed or a dogma passed down
[1:51:38] by a man it's not connected to the
[1:51:40] original vine
[1:51:43] the works that i do shall ye do also
[1:51:46] even greater works
[1:51:48] brother brown dealt with that how could
[1:51:50] it be greater than what he did it ain't
[1:51:51] greater it's now not just one body
[1:51:55] this is not just one little vine coming
[1:51:57] up
[1:51:58] it's branched out
[1:52:00] and it's branched out over in russia
[1:52:02] ukraine europe it's branched out all the
[1:52:05] way down in the dark places of africa
[1:52:06] where they ain't no if you wonder how in
[1:52:08] the world i you know i was down in south
[1:52:10] america and i i got the privilege one of
[1:52:12] my first what was my first actually
[1:52:14] mission trip preaching trip
[1:52:16] when i went before that with my dad but
[1:52:18] this first time i went to minister in
[1:52:20] 2003
[1:52:24] i thought i'd go back never been back
[1:52:26] to that place
[1:52:27] flew an hour in this little puddle
[1:52:29] jumper
[1:52:30] held together what looked like bailing
[1:52:31] wire and duct tape
[1:52:35] it ain't always woo you get to see the
[1:52:37] world well sometimes you're like am i
[1:52:39] going to make it
[1:52:41] and i'm thinking well paul made it on a
[1:52:42] ship that was trying to you know seize
[1:52:46] mercy
[1:52:48] and i'll never forget
[1:52:49] went down there about the same time i
[1:52:51] called home and my papal butts was being
[1:52:54] taken to the hospital with heart issues
[1:52:56] mind battles
[1:52:58] oh yeah there was no phones to call home
[1:53:00] down in there for a whole week
[1:53:03] i didn't know if he'd be alive when i
[1:53:04] came out
[1:53:06] the devil tried to tell me all kinds of
[1:53:07] things
[1:53:08] i didn't know if i'd be alive
[1:53:12] i mean it's it was serious
[1:53:15] and i'd get in that boat we'd go eight
[1:53:17] hours up this river
[1:53:19] that was our highway was a river
[1:53:22] up to this little village
[1:53:25] they didn't even know where it's coming
[1:53:26] i think i've told this but
[1:53:28] and i'm thinking about it like how
[1:53:30] in the world
[1:53:32] did the message get up here
[1:53:34] this was no internet there wasn't no
[1:53:36] clicking on the website
[1:53:38] how in the world because we're not just
[1:53:41] eight hours now of a river there's no
[1:53:43] telling how far we are back
[1:53:45] to the mouth where it comes from the
[1:53:46] ocean because this river was connected
[1:53:48] to the ocean because it would go up and
[1:53:50] down with the tide
[1:53:52] and i don't know how far up in there we
[1:53:53] was but we was a ways
[1:53:56] and we took this boat eight hours and
[1:53:58] i'm i'm on my way i'm thinking how
[1:54:01] brother basil as he's talking
[1:54:03] began to describe he was out fishing he
[1:54:04] was a commercial fisherman out there in
[1:54:06] the ocean and some pirates got after him
[1:54:10] he thought he said man i thought this is
[1:54:12] going to be a bad day i'm about to lose
[1:54:13] everything
[1:54:14] he said i saw the mouth of this river
[1:54:16] and i ran up in it and hid up in here
[1:54:18] he said while i was up in here i began
[1:54:20] to go into the little village
[1:54:23] while i was hiding from them pirates
[1:54:25] i walked into the little village off the
[1:54:27] river and i began to spread the gospel
[1:54:29] and that's how the message got in here
[1:54:31] the dumb devil
[1:54:34] trying to ruin somebody's day you didn't
[1:54:36] do nothing but spread the fire
[1:54:38] [Applause]
[1:54:40] sometimes you need to realize some days
[1:54:42] your days ain't being ruined sometimes
[1:54:44] your days are being made
[1:54:49] thank you lord that was real good
[1:54:54] we'll get we always think man
[1:54:57] biting against the fight don't forget
[1:54:58] who's leading you
[1:55:01] we get so sidetracked by all the
[1:55:03] nonsense around us we forget who's the
[1:55:05] li the light in front of us
[1:55:08] i mean think of the children of israel
[1:55:10] they thought we're about to have a bad
[1:55:12] day
[1:55:13] been following this light and he led us
[1:55:14] right to a red sea
[1:55:17] and now the pharaoh's coming behind us
[1:55:19] there's mountains over here how are we
[1:55:21] going to get out their day was about to
[1:55:22] be made
[1:55:24] because the first time in history was i
[1:55:26] see you about to be open and walk across
[1:55:28] on dry land
[1:55:30] could you imagine the stories they was
[1:55:32] able to tell their children for
[1:55:33] generations after generations
[1:55:36] of what they witnessed and felt
[1:55:39] because of a bad day
[1:55:43] so this message gets up in there because
[1:55:44] of pirates
[1:55:46] we're on our way up in there and they
[1:55:48] didn't this this group of indians they
[1:55:50] didn't know we was coming we couldn't
[1:55:51] get we couldn't get to them we felt to
[1:55:53] go so we get out we pull off the mouth
[1:55:55] of this uh little river and pull into a
[1:55:57] creek and out of the bushes steps this
[1:55:59] white haired indian they just don't know
[1:56:01] how old he is
[1:56:02] they don't keep up with time they don't
[1:56:04] keep up with miles they don't keep up
[1:56:05] with nothing but food
[1:56:09] he steps out and he's got a couple guys
[1:56:10] with him and there he got something like
[1:56:12] a ain't a spear but it's something like
[1:56:14] a big rod and he's shouting
[1:56:17] shouting
[1:56:18] and i'm what in the world
[1:56:21] going on look over brother basil and he
[1:56:23] got tears coming down his eyes
[1:56:25] he looked over at me and brother danny
[1:56:27] and brother jackie benton he said this
[1:56:28] is the chief
[1:56:29] i believe there's a chief or one of the
[1:56:31] elders in that tribe
[1:56:32] he said last night an angel came to him
[1:56:35] in a dream he said go to the mouth of
[1:56:37] the creek i've got three white men
[1:56:38] bringing fire
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:46] that'll put some confidence in you
[1:56:49] god knows where i'm at
[1:56:52] he knows how many is there is of us
[1:56:55] he didn't say two he didn't say one he
[1:56:57] said three
[1:56:58] one two three he's talking about me
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:03] i don't know here we are
[1:57:06] no wonder paul had the confidence when
[1:57:09] they're grabbing that wood and that
[1:57:10] snake bit him and he just looked at that
[1:57:12] thing you said you dumb devil shook him
[1:57:14] off in the fire and killed him
[1:57:16] oh my god what we could do with that
[1:57:18] this morning as satan thinks he's going
[1:57:20] to try to defeat you and try to tear you
[1:57:22] down his bite is only an opportunity for
[1:57:26] his death
[1:57:29] hallelujah his attack on you is an
[1:57:32] opportunity for god to rise up in the
[1:57:34] light of god's word totally destroyed
[1:57:38] your enemy
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:57:46] christ in his church
[1:57:48] energizing
[1:57:50] bringing the same thing same things he
[1:57:52] did when he was on earth he's did it in
[1:57:54] all ages gone by
[1:57:56] so how come we think he's gonna do it
[1:57:58] different here
[1:58:02] he's in his church doing the same thing
[1:58:05] oh oh i see what it is it says it's too
[1:58:08] bad
[1:58:09] we've drawn lines
[1:58:11] and barriers
[1:58:12] and got different little sensations and
[1:58:15] isms instead of taking what god said to
[1:58:17] be the truth
[1:58:19] now we know why people think he's going
[1:58:21] to do it different
[1:58:25] but to make light
[1:58:26] up in these light bulbs that we're
[1:58:27] looking at this morning
[1:58:29] it takes
[1:58:30] two pieces of material it takes a a a
[1:58:33] neutral and a hot wire
[1:58:37] it takes it takes it to to bring a
[1:58:39] little bit i'll call it a dynamo
[1:58:42] and actually make it to make a and i
[1:58:44] don't know all the signs that brother
[1:58:46] i'd probably get brother james mitchell
[1:58:47] up here and he could tell us all about
[1:58:49] it but you only on a motor electric
[1:58:52] motor it has to take both forces to make
[1:58:54] it turn right
[1:58:56] it takes it to make it move like a
[1:58:58] dynamo dynamo
[1:59:00] that'll make that thing do to make it
[1:59:01] like make it light and he said when you
[1:59:03] get those two pieces of material to work
[1:59:05] together it'll make faith it'll make
[1:59:07] power it'll make healing when the
[1:59:09] believer and god gets to turning
[1:59:12] together
[1:59:14] so it sounds like to me you're not
[1:59:16] allowed if you want to work in this kind
[1:59:17] of capacity you're not allowed just to
[1:59:19] sit dead as a hammer
[1:59:23] it takes both of you you and god turning
[1:59:25] together
[1:59:26] amen turning together and that when that
[1:59:29] happens it generates the power of his
[1:59:32] resurrection
[1:59:34] when a believer takes his word in their
[1:59:36] heart it begins to generate her it
[1:59:38] begins to bring forth faith and it
[1:59:40] because he promised it everything is in
[1:59:42] line and the only thing you have to do
[1:59:45] to get electricity there is push the
[1:59:48] button
[1:59:50] that's all you have to do when the
[1:59:52] scripture is to be fulfilled press the
[1:59:55] button don't be afraid
[1:59:58] it will produce what it said it would
[2:00:04] but sometimes theology and church
[2:00:06] doctrines and
[2:00:08] everything clog up the faith line
[2:00:11] it becomes a break and a connection
[2:00:13] clogs up lines to you've been taught
[2:00:15] that those saints can't be and oh that
[2:00:17] oh now i know why people been taught it
[2:00:20] can't be that way
[2:00:21] so we're finding out it's not god that
[2:00:23] said it is man that said it man's
[2:00:26] decreed that to be thus and there we
[2:00:28] take man's ideas versus god's word
[2:00:32] it's pretty simple
[2:00:34] clogged up the lies till you've been
[2:00:35] taught but those things can't be
[2:00:37] and it puts a blockage there he said
[2:00:40] could you imagine this building here
[2:00:41] being energized tonight for light by by
[2:00:44] the electricity electricity is an unseen
[2:00:47] force
[2:00:49] when it was harnessed and brought on you
[2:00:50] know when benjamin franklin i believe it
[2:00:52] was
[2:00:53] i got a historian here he might could
[2:00:54] help me but i believe benjamin wants
[2:00:56] the thought is that benjamin franklin
[2:00:58] sent something up in the air
[2:01:01] and i guess lightning struck it was that
[2:01:02] him that did that it's a story
[2:01:05] sounds good
[2:01:06] send it up in there and had something
[2:01:08] tied on this line and like electric
[2:01:10] electro a lightning bolt hit it and he
[2:01:12] said i got it i got it but he didn't
[2:01:14] know what he had he had something but he
[2:01:16] didn't know what he had but along came
[2:01:19] edison and put it to work and today we
[2:01:21] can send a wireless telegram right from
[2:01:24] here anywhere in the world by wireless
[2:01:26] telegram it's an unseen force moving
[2:01:28] through space that no man can catch it
[2:01:31] now we're way beyond all of that right
[2:01:34] but so i but only machinery can catch
[2:01:36] you because it's too fast for the eye
[2:01:38] yet there's a force that there's
[2:01:40] telegrams coming right through here now
[2:01:45] i mean we could hook up
[2:01:47] a tv we can hook up a radio we can hook
[2:01:49] up all kinds of things there's there's
[2:01:51] unseen forces coming through this
[2:01:52] building
[2:01:54] even brother adam will talk about it he
[2:01:56] said there's unseen force of the holy
[2:01:58] ghost even that's moving through this
[2:02:00] building he said there's a sending
[2:02:01] station but there has to be a receiving
[2:02:03] station
[2:02:04] and the receiving station has to be
[2:02:06] wired correctly to be able to receive
[2:02:08] from the sending station
[2:02:11] that thing up there you ain't wired to
[2:02:12] receive anything like that but if you
[2:02:15] wired it correctly it would put pictures
[2:02:17] on there
[2:02:19] if you wired it correctly sometimes they
[2:02:21] have issues with it what is the problem
[2:02:23] something that got disconnected that
[2:02:25] something doesn't cause a problem
[2:02:26] something's wrong in the computer
[2:02:28] there's a disconnection or a blockade
[2:02:30] somewhere and once you get that
[2:02:31] connected it'll send it again but then
[2:02:33] it'll also receive it again
[2:02:36] and this is where he's at he said see it
[2:02:38] once handed in the right capacity amen
[2:02:41] to receive he said how much more could
[2:02:43] the power of the holy ghost once passed
[2:02:45] through a human heart by faith what
[2:02:47] could it do
[2:02:50] he talked about a man a mental guy that
[2:02:53] supposedly they can take by their mental
[2:02:56] capabilities could break glass
[2:02:58] look at it stare at it do whatever and
[2:03:00] break glass i don't know how they do it
[2:03:02] but he said that's he said that's a
[2:03:04] perverted thing
[2:03:06] he said imagine if they can do it by a
[2:03:08] perverted thing what a real thing will
[2:03:10] do
[2:03:17] see god has not promised us electricity
[2:03:19] only just might have to set them free
[2:03:21] but look what the holy spirit has
[2:03:23] promised to the believers today then
[2:03:25] when we look back and see that god put
[2:03:26] electricity here for a certain thing and
[2:03:29] science is moving in there and tapping
[2:03:30] into it but we as christians if we're
[2:03:33] not careful we become too clogged where
[2:03:36] we can't see it we can't feel it we
[2:03:37] don't know nothing about it the doctor
[2:03:39] said i can't well he said again well he
[2:03:41] said as long as you're thinking that
[2:03:44] he said but if you'll think god's
[2:03:46] thoughts
[2:03:49] he said but as long as you think that
[2:03:50] you're going to go into well i'm going
[2:03:51] to just die
[2:03:53] doctor said i'm going to die he said all
[2:03:55] regard best regards to the doctor that's
[2:03:56] the best of his knowledge
[2:04:00] he said you're going to die that's human
[2:04:01] speaking i believe the same thing but by
[2:04:03] the word i can't believe it
[2:04:07] amen because he promised it whatsoever i
[2:04:09] asked the father in his name it would be
[2:04:11] granted if god could just send that
[2:04:13] clear little channel and run that energy
[2:04:16] to that place then something's going to
[2:04:18] happen the whole body is set together to
[2:04:20] operate and life begins to move just as
[2:04:23] sure as it takes every member of my body
[2:04:25] to operate and give me life so does it
[2:04:27] take every member of the body of christ
[2:04:29] to operate together to get it right
[2:04:32] and some are put as teachers apostles
[2:04:34] prophets gifts of healing miracles
[2:04:36] speakers of tongues inter
[2:04:38] interpretations so forth all these
[2:04:40] things are for one great mystic body of
[2:04:43] jesus christ moving on earth today
[2:04:45] lights
[2:04:50] my goodness
[2:04:53] he says the body is correctly wired up
[2:04:56] when that heavenly father turns that
[2:04:58] master switch on
[2:05:00] something's going to move
[2:05:05] oh
[2:05:07] so either
[2:05:09] it ain't came time for the switch to be
[2:05:11] turned on
[2:05:12] or that he hits the switch and
[2:05:14] something's been disconnected somewhere
[2:05:17] because if he hits the switch and it's
[2:05:19] properly connected it's going to move
[2:05:22] it's going to hum it's going to happen
[2:05:24] it's going to take place there's nothing
[2:05:27] going to stop it amen he said now see
[2:05:29] what happens if it's properly taught and
[2:05:32] every fiber of your body lost in christ
[2:05:35] and his word he said now if you got
[2:05:36] theology if you got some doctrine you
[2:05:38] got some superstition you got some of
[2:05:40] them believe you got something that
[2:05:41] stops them somewhere then that energy
[2:05:44] can never pull through you
[2:05:53] but when you got to a place
[2:05:55] where you're perfectly wired
[2:05:59] and the master electrician is located by
[2:06:01] the ceiling of the holy spirit the only
[2:06:04] thing there is is to turn the switch on
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:09] i love this next statement and he said
[2:06:11] when you turn that switch on
[2:06:14] there will be a light show
[2:06:16] [Applause]
[2:06:19] i don't know about you but i like a good
[2:06:20] light show
[2:06:22] it's something about a light show i like
[2:06:23] watching it whether it's
[2:06:25] uh lasers or whether it's a fireworks
[2:06:27] whatever it is i enjoy a light show amen
[2:06:30] and i enjoy there's nothing more i enjoy
[2:06:32] than a person who's been so dark and
[2:06:34] dead and sin
[2:06:36] and they've been dead for years after
[2:06:38] years after a year but everything's
[2:06:40] being wired
[2:06:41] sometimes you don't know what's going on
[2:06:43] but he's wiring it up
[2:06:45] he's changing all the tied up knots and
[2:06:47] he's taking an untying and he's putting
[2:06:49] this wire here where it belongs that
[2:06:51] wire there where it belongs this over
[2:06:52] here justification where it belongs
[2:06:54] sanctification where it belongs and all
[2:06:56] of a sudden it comes time to hit the
[2:06:58] switch
[2:07:00] i enjoy those times amen a pastor you
[2:07:03] know sometimes can preach and preach and
[2:07:04] preach and never see a light show
[2:07:08] he's something he's the ox of the team
[2:07:10] he can preach and he can plant he can
[2:07:11] sow and he can hang he can he can till
[2:07:14] he can do all kinds of things and he
[2:07:16] never sees the harvest some too many
[2:07:17] times you don't see the harvest under
[2:07:19] his ministry but he'll bring a person in
[2:07:22] and that man will begin to preach a
[2:07:23] certain thing and something all of a
[2:07:26] sudden strikes that heart and a switch
[2:07:28] comes on and a light show takes off and
[2:07:31] light begins to dawn in a dark place
[2:07:34] [Applause]
[2:07:36] hallelujah that's why it's important for
[2:07:39] pastors and everything you can do it all
[2:07:41] by yourself amen we need the whole body
[2:07:44] we need the evangelists we need them all
[2:07:47] we need them to come because you never
[2:07:48] know who god will use to flip a switch
[2:07:53] and don't ever get weary in him and well
[2:07:56] doing because he's behind the scenes all
[2:07:58] the time wiring up the building
[2:08:01] [Applause]
[2:08:03] he said i ain't seen them in my child i
[2:08:05] ain't seen it in my husband i just keep
[2:08:07] praying god's working on the wire
[2:08:10] keep praying god's untying all the knots
[2:08:13] he's putting the red one where it
[2:08:14] belongs the black one where it belongs
[2:08:16] the white one where it belongs
[2:08:20] could you imagine what this building
[2:08:22] would do it would burn down to slap to
[2:08:24] the ground if this place wasn't wired
[2:08:25] right and you try to even throw every
[2:08:27] breaker and do some all kind of damage
[2:08:29] amen but it took somebody with the right
[2:08:31] knowledge to take the the right lines
[2:08:34] and run them to the right place hook
[2:08:35] them to the right things to the right's
[2:08:37] crews and tie it all in and now it works
[2:08:42] i mean this building's amazing you walk
[2:08:43] into a bill into a place in the and the
[2:08:46] lights come on
[2:08:48] now just in case some of y'all's
[2:08:49] wondering that doesn't mean you got some
[2:08:51] special blessing
[2:08:53] that means somebody wired it up that way
[2:08:56] you know we had heard a man one time
[2:08:58] went to an airport for the first time
[2:08:59] and he never seen uh water that
[2:09:01] automatically ran when you put your
[2:09:03] hands under he had never seen where you
[2:09:05] went over there to the place and also in
[2:09:07] the air or you got up and it
[2:09:08] automatically flushed or you walked away
[2:09:10] and automatically he ain't seen none of
[2:09:12] that you know what he thought
[2:09:14] man i just become real i must be real
[2:09:15] spiritual
[2:09:18] i put my hands there
[2:09:20] the water just comes on
[2:09:24] no somebody did that
[2:09:28] this building was wired
[2:09:30] for lights to come on
[2:09:32] it's a wonderful thing because we don't
[2:09:34] have to go around trying to make sure
[2:09:35] all these lights are out
[2:09:38] because they automatically go back out
[2:09:39] at certain times it was done that way
[2:09:42] and you don't know sometimes just what
[2:09:44] god's doing in your family
[2:09:47] you don't know just what how he's wiring
[2:09:48] it all up
[2:09:50] and he's working in the background
[2:09:51] there's so much in here in these walls
[2:09:53] you don't even see working but it's
[2:09:54] still working
[2:09:56] we see the fruition of it see the
[2:09:58] manifestation of it amen if it wasn't
[2:10:00] working we'd be sitting in the dark
[2:10:04] but it's working you don't see it all
[2:10:06] it's all behind sheetrock and painting
[2:10:09] rocking car carpet even underneath this
[2:10:11] building there's stuff working
[2:10:14] god's always working
[2:10:17] amen
[2:10:18] he's going to make your child's light
[2:10:19] shine
[2:10:22] you just make sure you be there and
[2:10:23] ready to see the flip the switch flipped
[2:10:25] on
[2:10:26] because there's going to be a light show
[2:10:31] i remember the testimony of sister
[2:10:33] kathy's nephew
[2:10:34] i was there right after his his
[2:10:36] experience with god if i understand
[2:10:38] right here's a boy that was out gone
[2:10:40] deep and i understand he walked into his
[2:10:43] bedroom
[2:10:44] and the presence of god met him there
[2:10:47] and his little fl his lit his uh his
[2:10:49] switch got flipped
[2:10:52] i love how i love how the chosen picked
[2:10:54] up on that all those fish swimming in
[2:10:56] one direction
[2:10:58] dark
[2:11:00] but all of a sudden they illuminate
[2:11:02] when they turn and go the other way
[2:11:04] this is exactly what happens in a
[2:11:06] christian's life
[2:11:08] amen if you're dark this morning you're
[2:11:10] swimming with all the other darkness
[2:11:12] you're going right along to the same
[2:11:13] place they're going but there is a man
[2:11:15] who can turn on the light
[2:11:17] he knows exactly how to wire your light
[2:11:19] you say brother timothy you don't
[2:11:20] understand all this went on in my life
[2:11:22] and all the things that i've done and
[2:11:23] all the mistakes and all my my dad did
[2:11:25] to me my mom did to me and this one over
[2:11:28] here did that and that would god knows
[2:11:29] how to make all uncross all of that
[2:11:32] and he knows how to take that wire yep
[2:11:34] it's in the wrong place i'm putting it
[2:11:35] right here where it belongs this one's
[2:11:37] on the wrong place i'm putting right
[2:11:39] here where it belongs this one's over
[2:11:40] here in the wrong place i put it right
[2:11:42] there where it belongs
[2:11:48] i was a brother derek coffee shop the
[2:11:50] other day sister rebecca said hey
[2:11:54] our sealer quit
[2:11:57] our car they got a nice little machine
[2:11:58] you just run them bags through and it
[2:12:00] seals them so you can coffee can come
[2:12:03] this is a shameless plug
[2:12:05] your coffee can be just sealed
[2:12:07] and delivered to you fresh
[2:12:10] good
[2:12:13] it went out
[2:12:16] you know why
[2:12:17] because somebody thought it was a good
[2:12:19] idea to put an emergency stop switch in
[2:12:21] that thing
[2:12:22] and that emergency swap stop switch had
[2:12:24] apparently malfunctioned and caused the
[2:12:26] whole thing to go off
[2:12:30] brother derek is over there like well i
[2:12:32] gotta do this i'm just gonna go order me
[2:12:33] another one sorry brother derek i'm just
[2:12:35] telling like it happened
[2:12:37] i'm gonna order me another one so we i
[2:12:39] mean sister ruth was there and we
[2:12:40] started looking for a fuse and see if
[2:12:43] finally since the roof found with this
[2:12:44] you know this thing was made in china so
[2:12:46] it's it's a
[2:12:47] it's a it's a different situation
[2:12:51] nothing's in english so you can't find
[2:12:52] those nothing that you can even
[2:12:54] understand
[2:12:55] so i'm just trying to follow wires
[2:12:56] where's this she finds the fuse the fuse
[2:12:59] is good we test it it's all good plug it
[2:13:01] back like this and that i said i looked
[2:13:03] at that emergency stop thing i said you
[2:13:05] know what
[2:13:06] somebody thought that was a good idea
[2:13:08] but now it's malfunctioning shut it off
[2:13:10] permanently
[2:13:13] you know a lot of people want some
[2:13:14] emergency stop switching the service
[2:13:19] and they'll wire them right in
[2:13:21] [Laughter]
[2:13:24] oh boy
[2:13:25] a lot of preachers are wired right in
[2:13:28] people get a little bit too fanatical
[2:13:31] no we can't have that that's emotion
[2:13:35] no somebody's getting sealed
[2:13:39] that's right
[2:13:41] boy this is good i didn't know this is
[2:13:42] gonna happen
[2:13:46] pretty soon i got up there and i looked
[2:13:47] at that wire and i said i'm gonna cut
[2:13:49] that thing i'm gonna bypass it we don't
[2:13:51] need it know how ain't nothing but bags
[2:13:53] being sealed
[2:13:55] big deal ain't gonna kill you amen if
[2:13:57] your finger runs through it it'll just
[2:13:58] be sealed
[2:14:02] and so i grabbed the wire cutters and i
[2:14:03] cut that wire and i hooked them together
[2:14:05] real quick we plugged her in and that
[2:14:07] thing come on
[2:14:08] i said yep that's what the problem was
[2:14:10] it's that dumb emergency switch right
[2:14:12] there and so we took something we made
[2:14:14] that permanent you know what we did we
[2:14:16] took that emergency switch it looks like
[2:14:18] it looks like it's there but you could
[2:14:20] hit it all you want to it ain't going to
[2:14:22] work
[2:14:24] you can knock it on it you can do
[2:14:25] everything you want to do it you can pop
[2:14:27] it up and down you say hey please please
[2:14:29] it ain't gonna work let me warn you come
[2:14:31] to this service you might think you've
[2:14:33] got emergency stop switch it ain't gonna
[2:14:35] work
[2:14:37] amen it's been bypassed by the word of
[2:14:40] god it's been taken away and we're
[2:14:43] running and energized by the presence of
[2:14:46] almighty god
