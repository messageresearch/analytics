as a bride gathers all over the place and just ask the Lord to move in a special way amen let's go together in prayer we serve God with all my heart that this is a predestinated moment seen by God before the foundation of the world and I believe we've been taught that the Lord Jesus keeps all of his appointments and if he predestinated this moment he's here this morning so let's treat it like he's here and let's give ourself away and give him everything let's take these needs before the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord that's the greatest desire of my heart Lord is that I could see more of myself laid down and laid aside and put aside and more of you manifested in my life Lord Lord I want to see less of me and more of you and I thought that's why we gather to hear your word Lord and allow it to changes in order to have the moving of the Spirit sweep over us Lord God and just time after time Lord mold us and make us Lord Lord this morning we come here and we lay ourselves Lord upon the potter's wheel as it were and we say father were just the clay this morning Lord you are the Potter Lord if you see things if there's things in our lives Lord that aren't like you nor the things in our lives Lord that would hinder us from growing closer to you things in our lives Lord Lord that may one day keep us here Lord when the rapture would goal or we lay it down this morning nor we say forgive us Lord of any shortcoming of any failure Lord and just sweep through this place this morning and moulders lord sweep through this place Lord God Lord convinced us of sin Lord God draw the backslider to repentance I pray Lord God made the sinner Lord God we persuade to Calvary Lord in each and every one of us Lord that may even have an experience and know you lord may we take

Lord Jesus Lord we speak those things because we are believers Lord were a believer in the never failing Word of the Living God nor were believer because you have never been defeated you have never

up but we know today that we are following the captain of the Lord's hosts and we will be victorious Lord nor we stand here with that testimony that no devil no spirit of Hell no depression no darkness no sickness nothing can stand before the word of the Living God nothing can stand before the Lord Jesus Christ and nothing can stand before us this morning Lord Lord because you have raised up an invincible army in this last day known as the bride of Jesus Christ and we take our position this morning and we stand there upon that promise Lord we stand there in that position Lord God

boy there in Texas is going to have surgery Lord brother Jonathan here not feeling well this morning Lord Lord you took strikes for these needs lord for sister Westerfield needs one Lord I don't

[Music] Jesus just tell me [Music] wretches already [Music] [Applause] a man will let you be seated this morning you know I believe every ever baby is a miracle amen I believe the life as mayor is a miracle I mean that's just waking up this morning as a miracle another day to live and but you know we have this baby here this morning that's the Lord's done really something special in our midst and I just like to to tell about it for a moment before we call for the baby dedication but just it was after four miscarriages and hemorrhage in the uterus at six weeks 12 weeks they couldn't find the heartbeat until we prayed 19 weeks they discovered a to vessel cord instead of three of course this could caused a lot of concern with doctors and also us that the baby wouldn't develop normally but but about nine and then about twenty nine weeks stomachs and legs was too small and so there's a lot of concern about that and the normal growth but you know right after the fall meetings Bethany was to go for another checkup and on that Saturday brother Ron had prayed for her and you know and she went back to the the meet the checkup there at the doctor and they were amazed just how quickly her stomach and legs and their nearly doubled in size and at birth you know she was a proportionate healthy baby and passed every test in her exam by the pediatrician that's a mighty God you know what the devil means for our harm God means for a good it just builds our faith that much more and this morning I'd like to sing maybe a different song that we normally sing for baby dedication but we just sing the course our God is awesome how many can say that this morning he man I like to sing it right in the face of every devil of Hell ever doubt her every spirit that would try to raise up and say God don't heal God don't deliver God don't save our God is awesome amen he's mighty he's a wonderful God amen our God is awesome [Music] Oh [Music] oh my god is also yes also Oh think that birds now also my god is also mounted ha from the rain my god is awesome here's me when I'm broken straight where I've been when he can river [Music] [Laughter] I'm so glad to be serving an awesome God a man and declare that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen what a wonderful thing to bring this family and their new little addition little Brook Kirsten Dexter to be dedicated to the Lord and this is some part of the very prayer that I prayed in Shiloh and we just see this is the first of many a man a man and it's also assigned to us that a barren church is going to give life a man and barren souls are gonna come to Christ a man so we certainly serve an awesome God here today I'm gonna ask my wife to join us today and also matthan Mary Dexter are here from from Arizona I'd like them to come and stand here with us today man is part of the family and extended family and we're the proud grandparents certainly amens the Pruitts and the Dexter's you know I just think of Michael many many years ago giving up his scholarships and heading out to Louisiana to find a place where he could raise his family and to be under a ministry that he felt that would that he could grow under and Michael has been a man of faith and of course as time went on he wound up marrying my daughter Bethany and have this wonderful family mother Michael is a tremendous addition to our church as he operates as a deacon the song leader technician you know a lot of the behind scenes that you see you don't understand that even goes on hours and hours this man spends - to make sure that the things are broadcasted around the world and many technical issues his dad also is has come over and helped us with sound and other Internet is used as well and so it's been a blessing so the Dexter family has blessed us tremendously and we're so thankful for them and of course we have David and Courtney here - that's a pardon Michael's brother and sister-in-law so you know we're a blessed people aren't we and then to hold this little miracle my god he's awesome a man to bring us through the valleys and through the rain and through difficult times and to bring us to this wonderful moment today and a little Brook um we don't have to explain what a brook is we all know what that is a small stream but Kirsten is it means a Christian a follower of Christ and and that's what our aspirations and our goals as for our children is that they would follow the Lord with all of their hearts a man and so may they follow in the footsteps of their parents and grandparents and follow the Lord and as we point them to Jesus and then as a congregation a church family you have responsibilities also of being examples in pointing these little ones to the Lord so we're are in all this together today let's talk to the Lord now father as we bow before your throne of grace today we want to say thank you we want to thank you that your Jehovah of miracles the God who heals and even in the womb that you have

not Lord we know little children will be together with us in heaven we have no doubt Lord but if time with Terri God Lord just guide her all the days of her life and director steps Lord that she would certainly be a follower of Christ as her name implies Lord today as we stand here we're almost feel like Moses parents as we turn our children loose in a troubled world Lord and we'd raise them in a time like this but Lord is our faith in you that you will guide our little Ark safely Lord until we're drawn out of the waters father we asked your blessings now upon this child in Jesus name as I

a trophy of the grace of God let's just worship Him today and man Jesus we love you today and Lord we're not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God and salvation Lord we're not ashamed to express our love and appreciation to you and sometimes our emotion just kind of gets the best of us Lord when we're just overwhelmed of the grace that surrounds us the mercies that always endure the blessings that just keep on flowing Lord we thank you we're asking for your grace today to permeate our lives and for your spirit to move Lord did every cloud every darkness every unbelief would leave I'm just looking to you today Lord as I just step here for a moment Lord I I don't know how to explain it but I'm just looking Lord like a child looking at the swinging of the rope for that right moment just to jump into the anointing Lord and then to move with that anointing Lord that may it be today that we not just be bystanders looking on but ever one of us become ones that put our faith into action I ask God did you'll speak to us now I know it's lord the needs of your people Lord the things that we we deal with around the world Lord your precious ministry Lord and their burdens around the world does God call them men that stands for truth my lord they stand in their pulpits today without fear or favor and preach the unsearchable riches of Christ I pray Lord that you'll do it today and then and then our service here today anoint us bless those that are around the world Lord oh god is it reaches globally today into the far-reaching lands Lord there are many burdens are many situations but may God they look they quit looking with the eyes of their own understanding and begin to look with eyes of faith and see things from a different perspective today I ask it in the name of Jesus I know what the words we speak for God's glory a man a man god bless you we love you in the Lord good to be in the house of the Lord together numbers chapter 33 verse 53 we're going to read this again these words given to Israel and then I would like to look at John 15:7 as we worship the Lord together this morning amen alright numbers 33 verse 53 and ye shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the Lamb and well therein for I have given you the land to possess it how doesn't that just sound wonderful then I would like you to turn with me to John chapter 15 and verse 7 and these are the words of our precious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ whom we alone believe in for our salvation a man John 15 in verse 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done to you and hearing as my father glorified that you bear much fruit and so shall you be my disciples a man god bless you you can be seated hey man what a wonderful words of life we're gonna be speaking today on the end the Lamb of the lamb where faith prevails Amen I believe that there is a prevailing faith for this day you know and and we preach some things like this because we are trying to get the church into the place that we can really see apostolic times moving among us I believe that's what we all hunger or is is that and of course I believe we're in the our fart we see it but we want more of it a man and I we wanted to flow we wanted to flow like the little baby's name was Brooke we want it to be a flow and Brooke a man and and we wanted to flow and help us and flow out to others so this is our desire to be a channel for that faith that God can move through now when we speak about the land we know the the land that the Israelites would leave from as we could look into the this time was as a time of redemption as they were redeeming God was redeeming Israel from Egypt and bringing them back into their land of promise and the book of Exodus is a book of redemption and of course in our Exodus this is the the the hour of redemption and I believe that we're in a time of full redemption this is why seven angels would appear to the prophet of God because it shows completion and that we are we're in the hour of full redemption and if so Egypt would be a land full of unbelief and bondage and slavery but we have left the land of unbelief and we've entered into the land of faith a man then this is a land where faith prevails because without faith you cannot please God and so to please God is to of course possess the promises that he gave you in his word to possess and and of course then we read from john the words of our Savior where he says if you live in me and my words live in you and then you shall ask what you will and it shall be done and so again we are to bide in that land because it's only in that land were that we can be blessed that's where our inheritance lays our inheritance does not lay out of the promises of God our inheritance lays in the Holy Ghost in the Word of God and so we are to bide it and be blessed in the promised land but the land that was given to Israel was given to you know was subject to one little word yes and that Judah Romani 20 and 28 15 it lists all the blessings ahead of this but then it says but it shall come to pass if now this is a very very um this is a clause in the Covenant if you would say in other words it makes it conditional on on this if and and this if that will not hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God to observe to you'll do all of his Commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day that all of these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee so again if they did not observe the commandments in his statues and listen to the voice of God then all the curses that were listed in the book would come upon them then them when we look at ours you know they I would like you to say the word to the spiritual Israelites is contingent upon the same if now I understand when I say that that we have an unconditional covenant and it's not based on what we do but about what God does and so again but I want to look back at verse 7 of chapter 15 and we're going to see the same word here if you abide or if you live in me and my words live in you you shall ask what you will so again I'm though it is an unconditional covenant and we have no argument about that that yet it is conditional it is only unkissed conditional if we live in the land if we dwell in Christ and that to dwell in Christ is to be filled with the Holy Ghost so the promises of God are continued can you know it's required upon this one thing this requirement that you must have the Holy Spirit to dwell in this land and then of course then abiding in him and he abides in us then we ask what we will and it shall be given to us in other words the whole land and everything in the promises of God belong to us because we are dwelling in Christ I mean with me now so if you abide now you said but how do we abide in Christ now the Reformers have a and there's many many books that they've wrote great books and men like him drew Murray um who wrote for he was a man from South Africa and he wrote for a movement there that was and wrote some many wonderful books on abiding in Christ and and many many of these were talking about how you abide in Christ and to bide in Christ was you know so much the reading of your Bible and so much study in the books and and and feeding on the word and here's how you abide in Christ that's not how you abide in Christ that's the understanding of the reformers but that is not our revelation the way that we abide in Christ is that the Spirit of Jesus abide in us you see is a oneness a unity if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will it's a oneness between you and God so how do you dwell in Christ there's only one way to dwell in Christ and that is being baptized into his body all right and that means that we are filled with His Holy Spirit for by one spirit we are all baptized into that body and so to be filled with the spirit means that you are living in Christ and you are your flesh of his flesh and your spirit of his spirit in other words you're the body that he's living and operating in so if you if my words live in you you shall ask what you will and the word will drive out the inhabitants of the land you know God would say even to Israel you know I will go before you and I will be a hornet and I will drive them I will I will drive them out of the lamb before you and this is what the Holy Spirit is saying to you that the Holy Spirit that you have within you will drive out every enemy in that is trying to possess a promise of your property that the Word of God clearly gives to you in his Holy Bible now so but again if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you then it should be come to pass that those things which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and so vex you in the land where you dwell so that's number 33 50 55 so he tells you if you let things stay there if you if you don't take some action then then you're gonna be vexed you're gonna be troubled there be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your side and so again we know that we're in a battle today and the battle is set array setting right in every heart of every person that's in this building this morning and he said he's sitting there saying well I've tried before or I've heard that before or we have made efforts before but you see you don't need to argue with the devil our job is to cast him out hey man so what the Bible say he said to cast him out in my name you shall cast out Devils amen we have been trained to do that and brother Branham would ask the question what's the matter with us preachers I wonder what kind of training that we've got the Gulf's training us for this great battle and Daniel 12 shows us that there be a troublesome time like never before but but in that hour Michael shall stand up in Revelation chapter 9 shows us a belief that would permeate the world and it would be like a smoke that has been let out of a pit and it would get an every crack and crevice of humanity and every kind of demon power would operate under that cloud of unbelief that would be released into this hour disease you read it in the Bible is a time where the bottomless pit is open and every kind of smoking and the spirit of unbelief is coming out and under that cloud of unbelief it allows every kind of demon power to take a hold of people a man but I want you to remember revelation 10:1 begins like this if you just put it up on there it begins with the conjunction because it's a continuation of the chapter before and the chapter before is told us of a great smoke in a great darkness and all worshiping the Beast and all falling down to today and worshipping and idolizing the spirits that are coming out of this this spirit of darkness but I want you to notice as it concludes that chapter it opens up into revelation 10 and it says that I saw another mighty angel now the other one describes a polygon the other describes a horrible devil the other and the other chapter describes the trouble sometime it describes a time where where where there's all kinds of spirits can you imagine the spirits that's got upon people today that they'll kill their own babies in the womb whether we're praying for the safety and the life of a child in the womb that they are actually taking the lives of their own babies as they're being born what an hour what a terrible day that we're living in a manner and so apollyon is there and he is there ruling like a lion but I want you to notice that he's not the only one on the scene and that we're not here by ourselves but he said and I saw another and he was a mighty angel I wouldn't say that at the name of Jesus apollyon hats of all the name of Jesus every demon that comes out of the pit that is destroying our families that is destroying the moral fiber of this country that is wrecking the world I'd say that's the name of this mighty angel this [Applause] everything at this morning [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] let's pop my eyes were pawned because I'm not binded by the unbelief of the smoke out of the out of the pit now the battle is here it depends on which one's your captain and the Goliath is here his name he's a lot worse than the Goliath back there David's time he's the polygon man yeah he's evil he's the one that deceived Eve from the beginning he's ill he is that old serpent called the devil and Satan a man but who will be a David in this hour take that little slingshot of faith and take it against the enemy but I want you to know God's army is moving forward we are not retreating but yet God has called men and women of faith men of power and men and women of understanding not that they're smart in this world not that they're educated but they but there are channels through whom the Spirit of God can flow down through [Applause] if we would look at this mighty angel in Revelation 10 we will see he conquers with his feet because he puts his feet upon the two beasts and the powers that are there that arising out of the land and the sea so he conquers with his feet and these feet are as it were pillars of fire so where he touches the earth man where where he has his boots on the ground and money his feet is his church with his church he is triumphant fire because why he divided himself on the day of pentecost 120 in the upper room and he's came in spirit within the church that every one of you that could have a look at the pillar of fire you could possess in your temple the holy one the almighty the King of Kings the Lord of lords within you is no less than his power but we have to be channels we all desire to be channels for this prevailing faith but in order to have prevalent faith we must be people who live and dwell in the word of the Bible in order to know their God and do exploits amen and of course by God dwelling in them they're God's sons and daughters and because his life and dwells them in this this makes them to live by faith and and of course they are marching if you remember in Revelation 19 for example there's an army coming out of heaven which is a future event but I just want to use it for a moment that that the armies of heaven follow they follow the word and I want you to stir I just want to just touch on it just for a moment because that that is a future application but I just want to take it right now that even on earth that there's an army and we're following the word amen we're following the word and of course we're we're exactly like him he was on a white horse we're on white horses if he comes and power the word we come and power the word a man that weirder if he yes and holiness we're dressed in holiness whatever he is we are a man and together we're NAR me hey ma'am so you see our captain is we want to just look at him for a moment we want to see that he upholds all things by the word of his power remember we saw in the scripture he would cast out devils with a word that's what he expects you to do with the word the word isn't to give you a diploma in knowledge the word is given to you to cast out devils with a man to push Satan out of your life to be an overcomer so you see in Hebrews chapter 1 in verse 3 who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power he by himself purged our sins and sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high so Jesus is not only the Creator but he holds dominion over his creation every Son of God that is born of the new creation is also one who has dominion if we look back and Eden and we we talk about the Adam the way that he was the one with God made him he gave him dominion now we can all come in the sonship and not how Dominion the Bible said he made us unto our God kings and priests and a man so you can't be a king unless you're ruling over something so a real son of God that is born of the Spirit of God is people who rules by the Word of God are you with me now so every son of God is born of the new creation and they have dominion in other words they have prevailing faith they have bait that will dominate in every situation you see everything Jesus did for needy humanity during his earthly ministry is a direct revelation of the perfect will of God for the human race so Jesus operated with perfect faith and that faith dominated it prevailed over every circumstance Jesus ruled the winds and the waves of the sea by faith hey man now now listen Jesus he didn't just have this plan for himself but he also had this plan for his children it was not only him that walked on water but he bade disciples to walk on water hey man and then Matthew chapter 8 verse 26 he said to them why are you fearful and you have little faith and then he arose now he uses prevalent faith and rebuked the winds and the Seas and there was a great calm so we see he ruled the winds he ruled to see he had dominion over his creation his authority then dumbfounded those that was around him they had never seen a son of God operate and the Son of God was now operating in his faith and they marveled in verse 27 saying what manner of man is this that even the wind's and the sea obey Him this was this was the character of Jesus it was a characteristic of his ministry now the reason I'm bringing this out is because the works that I do shall you do also these are the things that he cemented in the gospel to make sure that you understand that you are not to be the downtrodden you are not to be the weak you are not to be running from your enemy you are to be people who are overcomers and you are rising up above things and you expect the miracles that are promised in the Word of God are you with me my man so as I said you know the trademark of Jesus even his doctrine his that marveled at his doctrine because he didn't preach as a Pharisee or as sad you see but he had authority with his words this is the difference of real disciples of Jesus the real doctrine of Jesus come on now is because there is a party that is that is given with the word that is preached and that authority is over unclean spirits that authority is over sickness that authority is over diseases it is over sin are you with me now now when the word is preached correctly it will have a party with it that's why there's so many that are preaching and they're using quotes and the prophet of God but the message that they have is weak and it will not save and it will not heal and it will not deliver and it will not produce even joy or a rejoicing it is dead because their faith is dead the faith of Jesus is a living faith it is a prevailing faith it is more than just a doctrine but it is of the doctrine with authority people who know their God and they do exploits Jesus ruled the fish in the sea for the Book of Luke it tells of him saying the Peter put your net on the other side and Peter's could say now I'll tell you what I know I'm a fisherman there's not a fish around I've already fished all night and I didn't catch anything but nevertheless it that word I'll let down the net you see that's where the nets were filled instantly and because that's where faith prevails and the same was true after his resurrection Jesus had bread and fish on the fire bread that was never first wheat and then ground into bread and fish that had never been in the sea and yet he could say children have you hit him eat a man catch their net on the right side of the boat and cuz he had rule over the fish hey man there was a hundred and fifty three that they caught and they got so many until their nets begin to break is that right everybody already it showed he had Dominion he had a prevailing faith about Jesus and you said but that was Jesus Jesus was only demonstrated what God he gets to be in your flesh by man now in marker 132 when the Sun did set and they were brought in to him they brought unto him all that were diseased and them that were possessed with devils and all the city was gathered together at the door and He healed many that were sick of divers diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devil's to speak because they knew him you see Jesus ruled over Devils days demons had to recognize his Lord yep because he gave them or he had dominion over them and he commissioned his church to do the same and I'll tell you what today we ought to make it up in our minds in our hearts today I am gonna declare war on the devil I'm not gonna allow him live here on one piece of my property I have been told to drive him out I know the Lord will go before me with Hornets I know that God will torment Devils on my sake Amanda he'll go before me and the pillar fire moves before us is somebody with me now amen and because we must declare war on the every form of sickness and take authority over ever demon power through the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah now the book of John illustrates that Jesus is Lord over the grave I'll tell you we're gonna need some of that we're gonna need to be able to exercise that lordship even for at the tomb of Lazarus Jesus was master of the dead and no matter whether the circumstances wonder what they said Lazarus is dead he looked dead the doctor declared him dead he felt dead he smelled dead but Jesus had dominating faith over death anyway regardless of what the census said come on he had dominating faith over every bit of that he had dominion over the trees he would walk by three and say to that tree commanded to die no fruit come forth forth from you from this day on and by by his own faith it dried up from the roots he had prevailing faith hey man it was my faith he made the world's and it was by faith that the righteous are to live by come on now the just are the righteous shall live by faith we're we're not listen jerks we're not just a half faith we are to live by that faith we are the exercise of faith we're to move in that faith and we are to prevail with that faith now Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 this says I am crucified with Christ therefore I am I am dead to sin and unbelief right if we're crucified we're dead to sin and unbelief nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God here again we live by faith whose faith his faith you seem to be born of God is to be born and his attributes and God believes he believes his own word this is how he created the world he said let there be and he believed it a man he proclaimed and he stood behind it believing it that's exactly right and there's nothing such as for Balaam power as a revelation of the word it's a revelation of God than to give you a party of the devil and you wonder what kind of Revelation is that it's a revelation I am God and if I'm his son then I'm in his image and if we prevail empower and prevail in faith I have that same phrase that will prevail with my life that will defeat ever devil that will help me to overcome that nothing could stop us all right now so again that is our revelation by first birth when we were born as this little baby was born and we talked about it when we were born all of us like the same we used to live but and we were by our feet our five senses but you see our new birth we do not live by see taste smell feeling here it has nothing to do with this round it has nothing to do with God it is only things that you contact the earth it is not what you contact heaven with amen so again it is only faith is the only thing that contact centered around faith is the only thing that can see that other round faith can see what you cannot feel what you cannot see naturally what you cannot hear with your ears what you cannot feel with your hands what you teach smell with your nose what you gain taste with your mouth and man faith sees what your senses cannot declare and with how did you bind to all that heaven is this is why without faith you cannot please God now our first merchants have said it caused us to be born blind we were born in sin and so we were blind to the supernatural we were blind to to the rounds of things of God and the promises of God we were only since bound people we had no true faith the only mental faith our second birth the Holy Ghost gives us the faith for what was otherwise impossible when we when we look here today I'm looking at both men and women that it was impossible their situation was impossible to save impossible to be delivered on things that I couldn't help you with things that medicines that the doctors would give could not cure but it gave you the ability to do that which was impossible to believe far the impossible because those who believe all things are possible to them that believe a man but but you see too often we do not have real faith we have mental faith and that's the problem is the faith the people have requires feeling it requires seed it requires hearing and the biggest part of our faith today is mental of faith by hearing the Word of God it brings us into a mental recognition and acknowledgement of God we mentally agree mental fades is based on the five senses this is this is why brother madam would try to tell us in our new birth don't be dependent on emotion or a sensation or a tongue or dance don't let that be what you're looking for depending upon your your place and your faith in the unsalables Unsinkable Word of God and that's where your foundation is when you don't feel sane I mean when you're not feeling it anymore you know what God said and you can see the evidence were called down to the Bible and it works right here plumbers and it's worked in my life and today when I feel it or not I know I'm saved I'm where the outward man perishes then it's depressed not worried it's confused there is something that holds within the veil and everstorm it's an anchor but the soul but mental faith is based on the five senses it looks so much like real faith they're so deceiving that most people don't know the difference mental faith is a mental acknowledgment that the Word of God is true mental faith will see it mental faith admires it mental faith you know acknowledges it by all of this but although I'll saying is true but it's not my case you see mental faith agrees that the Word of God is a revelation then it comes of God and and the word is true yet when a crisis comes it don't work it simply recognizes the truthfulness of the wonderful promises that it contains but it acts upon it mental fades its intellectual fades it's a dead faith because real faith is alive and real faith acts the Bible tells us clearly that faith that doesn't act is dead says faith without works but it's the same thing if it has no action if it doesn't work it's dead we can say I believe in miracles but we must act upon that and my weekend we can say I believe is a healer but we must act upon that we might we can say well I believe the Holy Ghost is ever generation but we must act upon that and man we must believe we must profess it we must confess it we must hold it as our own and we must prevail with it now well this is what many people have received is just a mental faith an acknowledgment that the message is right and the glory of what it was done in the past but they know nothing of his power mental faith will not heal it will not see miracles I'll just show you a little quotation from God's only provided place the branham's was saying this just before he departs him this life in fact I probably was there when he when he spoke this I was a young boy but he says I believe the church is beginning to hear the message and beginning to understand it but Fritz's friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the Sun we've got to be ripened I'm right intellectually we're hearing the message that God has given us and we're seeing the signs that he showed us and proven it by the Bible it's there but all how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and get Sweden the spirits I can just bathe down sometimes speaking the message you get hearts and you have to break it in like that because you got a cleansing nail to make it whole but once the church when the church once gets it the elected is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it will be like it will be something like those people were beyond the curtain of time was was when it takes a rapture now you see beyond the curtain of time they don't question whether God is true beyond the curtain of time you know all doubts yourself the word is not argued there's no R within them I'm a beyond the curtain of time the word is settled eternally in heaven beyond the curtain of time then there's no doubt among them they're full of the Holy Ghost they never doubt they rest of them the fact that Jesus is coming back a man they rest upon knowing that this message is what Paul preached and there's no murmuring or second-guessing what they believe and we've got to be in that same state before the rapture comes that our faith is secure then it is settled that it is anchored and that is ripe and a mature faith a faith that prevails now again this is this is the hour that we're out you see we must know our position because even brother Branham would say once the church knows its position it when they realize who they are when you realize what the blood is done for you people don't even realize what's in the atonement they don't even realize that it's God's will for you to be healed that jesus paid it all that it's already paid for that he doesn't have to do one more thing to provide it for you it's a finished work man it's a finished working and you're under the blood and he has taken your sins and he has pardoned your transgression oh I want to say he's more than pardoned it he's removed them he's annihilated ever since and you stand justified let's do you never did it and yet you know you did it hey man but in his sight you've never done it because he's not looking at what you were as a child of the devil he's looking at who you are as a son of God and he sees you he didn't see you deform decrepit and your spirit he didn't see you weary and worn down he's sorry Josiah he said where were you when the sons of God were shouting for joy man what was he doing Eva's already seeing you shout right here in this layout of Oh [Applause] faith prevails but positionally people don't know who they are they don't even know what they don't they don't even sometimes there's been so much confusion that people don't even know he's still on the mercy seat that he's still the high priest that he still can be touched by the feelings of your infirmity they know they become so educated until God's out of the picture your sons and daughters of God that's who you are not will be the Bible declares snap you are the sons of God and a lot of times you're looking for something great to come but you've already got it you've got the greatest thing that can get me given to you to your body change and that's the Holy Ghost a man and you right now you are seated with him in heavenly places and if you're with him then you you can sit with him and expect every enemy to come under your feet because that thought he does on his throne he sat down expecting every enemy to come bow down before him and when you're sitting with Christ you're doing the same thing you are sitting there expecting that you're a son of God by the blood and have the authority to cast him out we're right now seated with him now when faith gets like that in the church the devil moves away from the church I want you to know and we're going to be speaking on this and services to come but Satan has no legal rights everything that he does to you is ill legally done God does not allow a dead guy you said well God he allowed this that listen God allowed man to sin in the beginning he didn't make him a robot God allowed him to make a choice hey man but friends don't go to talk about that choice hey man let's go back to this choice he chose me what about that choice we want to point back to man's choice and his choosen failure what about God choosing you to be one with prevalent faith and an overcomer he chose you to be a peculiar people to be a different somebody that he owns somebody that's his bride something that buddy Dennis he can say that's flesh of my flesh and right for my life I chose you to Pisa let's just go over just a simple simple thing let's go back to Ephesians 1 and verse 1 I'll have them bring it on the screen cuz I I can't I didn't have this in my notes but Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God one cent one cent that's what an apostle yes by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and not just to him but to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ hey man this is him saying like he did to Mary you're highly favored of the Lord that's got a lot of great cities upon your life you're highly favored grace be to you and peace from God our Father blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with some blessings oh I'm glad you wasn't asleep hallelujah I'm out I hope you don't throw me over in with a bunch of this even preachers well you got some of them but we're right here spiritual blessings where where it does these blessings vote in our position in the Holy Ghost a man will be his blessed us if we're in the Holy Ghost it with his word abides in us if we abide in him if we have his spirit that he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in our position so our position comes with blessings so we're blessed everywhere you look no harm can come come on hey man we we're blessed look at it next look at what he said according as he hath you didn't choose him he told you oh man when did he choose you ah when Oh them before you sinned [Applause] before you did anything wrong before you had that past he chose you he chose you in spite of everything that people tried to do to you he told you it how where did he choose you not at the altar but before the foundation of the world and to think about this God he can never [Applause] change his mind about you [Applause] get a new thought he can never change his mind he said well I wasn't that brother Tim but he chose you to me and because he chose you to be look what he did he didn't chose you because you because you were holy look at the Bible or without blame cuz you know good and well you were not holy and you were not without blame right but that's not what it said he chose you to be holy he chose you to be without blame he chose you to be a spotless bride and you said well I wasn't dad and brother timber but you see him God's chose you to be that and he said you would be that and that was in his mind and the devil did something to you that he's gonna do the work of redemption to do everything in all of his God ship and his lordship to bring you to this very place to bring a word that'll wash you to bring a black devil save you cleanse you and praise you and make his blackness because he said you're gonna be that now this is a God that demands perfection and when he was on earth he said be you therefore perfect how perfect lord as even my father in heaven is perfect well let's close up and go home ain't none of us can do that but that's only one side of the coin hey man if he thought if he said you got to be that and you can't and I couldn't and you couldn't and no man could then he came down into your sin so you can be his righteousness so you can be as perfect as your father in heaven is perfect hallelujah that's who I'm preaching to this lauren the men that there's no shame on you [Applause] that was the problem with the law he told him what he wanted done but they had no power to do it so Jesus came to give us the power and it's all in the atonement he paid it all get the next verse he predestinated you unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself do you know you were predestinated to become a son before you were known as a son he predestinated you to adoption he predestinated you to the Holy Ghost he predestinated you to the body change he's predestinated you all the way do you know what predestinated means it means he determined your destiny so do you know I'm talking to this morning I'm talking to people whose destiny has been determined come on I'm out if God enough stop this for me if God told David and He pours him on and oil over David and he anoints him there with oil and there it pours it upon that little loom God David and said you're gonna sit on the throne now the Goliath could come around and kill him God's Word isn't true so David could come up against the Goliath and know he had been anointed our prophet had anointed him with oil and told him you're gonna sit on the throne and so no Goliath could stand before him so when he looked at glad he already knew he's defeated hallelujah you can look at every obstacle you can look at every problem cause God sent a message in this day prophet has anointed you with the oil of the holy girls and poured out the anointing oil of all the people in the same time and you are invited to sit on the throne read your Bible read what it said about Laodiceans overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne now you're gonna do it without a battle but even as I overcame and I said that was my father in his throne you're gonna overcome I'm trying to tell you this morning you are going to over come I'm trying to tell you you're not in the winner's circle you're the winner hallelujah how are you gonna do this by the prevalent faith that's in me so he predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself just because of the good pleasure of his on will not cause what you did or didn't do because of his good pleasure of doing what he wanted to do cuz he wants to bless you because he wants to empower you because he wants you to walk in victory because he wants you to defeat that sickness in your body that cancer that heart trouble that disease that what because he wants you because he wants you to rise up over sin do you know the victory that Jesus has in you you know this is why he wears many crowns because it's not just his victory that he's wearing where he rose up over death head of the hell in the grave but here upon his head are many crowns because really he's the one that had victory in your life my life in our life come on man so therefore a man he is the one who is crowned with our victory this is what heaven laughs did somebody hear me heaven laughs when one sinner repents [Music] so it rejoices well okay I laugh when I rejoice I shall die scream I cry I laugh and heaven laughs haha you covered her up with haha [Applause] [Applause] and he knows nothing you've been through nothing the devil can do no matter how many trips he's tried nothing can stop his plan I'll take you from your destiny well that ought to give us or something to shout about your chosen elect precious valuable something he would leave all of heaven far and give up give up the very throne to come down and be one of us to take on our burden to prevail now let's think of this chosen us in him before the foundation of world hope your mind they didn't mind that little sachet right there Satan hadn't got any legal right on you everything he does to you is illegal he has no right to put sickness on your disease he doesn't have any right to do anything to you and man we got every promise in the Word of God what God said he would do come on now in circles in there the other people have no right to that land they cannot say they cannot stay on any piece of the property every bit of it belongs to Israel are you with me oh man the Golan Heights belong and the West Bank belongs everything that God said in his word belongs and ever devil there is was going to get off man he's gotta get in he's a squatter on your yield he's got to get off if he's a squatter on your joy he's got to get off if he's a squatter on the Indian to the promise of God he's got to get off and you have the right when you were born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost come into your heart everything you have needed for the journey is in you right then it's in the Holy Ghost and all you got to do is start drinking and push out just like a little little little apple seedling it's got ever Apple that will ever be in it in the seedling man it's got ever Apple it's got a belief it's got every branch all of it is in the seed and when God gives you the Holy Ghost and everything's in the Holy Ghost and all you got to do is just put your roots down in the Word of God and drink on the Holy Spirit those nutrients that are in the soil of the word and bring them up and push out and the more you drink the more and the more you push out the bigger your happen the more fruits you have now that's the problem though yram oh I remain a little dwarf apple when we can be a big fruit tree this is a father's wheel that you bring forth much fruit and that fruit shall remain this is what we found in in the in the book of John but since bound faith is dependent on feelings or seeing but you must act on the word as your probably as your as your personal property you know let me just share some thoughts of this when a man can have an intellectual faith and that's what most people get today calling themselves Christian the reason you're carrying on as you do under the name of Christianity is only intellectual faith this is why this is why people can call herself Christian and smoke and drink and when they're just Church donors and they they just go right on and because they have intellectual faith you see you said but what do you mean by intellectual faith well men believe it on the salvation and faith cometh by hearing here in the Word of God and we can preach the word and you can accept it and you say well that's right I believe it but if that's all the Varia far as you go you'll never get very far with God you see that's very that's just an intellectual faith that is an acknowledgment that the word is right and this is a reason that a lot of people don't get healed is because they're only taking an intellectual view of it what their mind conceived but the mind can't will reason and say it can't be I'm no better my sense of sight says my arm is no straighter than it was yesterday or my sense of Eden said I don't feel any difference then I used to have never felt before reasoning and mental theology will reason it out and say well wait a minute I got it that's got to be foolishness then you see and the moment you start reasoning you know it's it's it's showing that your faith was only intellectual but what's the faith comes from the mind the intellect down into the heart it'll never questioned it anymore it's absolutely a fact it'll agree with the Word of God and that's the reason people don't get where they should be is because they have a mental conception of God you believe in by the intellectual faith but that'll never work it'll never prevail it's a dead faith it's a faith that is scared that is dependent on how I feel today or my circumstances or something else you know but when your faith is brought down into the compartment of the heart wounded resident within the soul and that revelation is the gaudiest and that he rewards those that diligently seek Him then faith says it so it no matter what our feeling says no matter what I think it says no matter what our side the class Amen face says it so anyhow God's Word is true no matter what I see what I feel what I what the circumstances are now there must be a people with eyes of faith who can see beyond what the five senses declare they cannot be just blinded Laodiceans now Laodicea their faith is blinded by the glamour of what they see around them and they see the you know the success of Laodicea and and and they see that is God's blessings God's blessings is not I mean I think God could bless you with riches that's that's fine but there are the times riches is a curse I mean there's nothing more valuable than being a Christian a man your wealth a lot of people look for a lot of things but the value what's really value is being a son or daughter of God if you live in a pole barn or whatever you Olivia you know that doesn't matter you know that does he make who you are whatever it is the word must live now of course you know we can have generations that would start maybe maybe they would start with their eyes and they would bind them up and you start for generation after generation every child is born and you make them well you know where they can never see you know a baby when it's born it has the eyes but it can't focus it can it can there's a lot of things that it's not discerning and it's not focusing and it's not seeing clearly and it's only seeing do and it's not doesn't have the perception but through use that sense is developed a man and the older he gets the more he begins to see and becomes alert to what's around and begins to see further and further and further because his since is exercised now as we were saying that if you don't use your senses they become dormant they won't act at all it is said that if you bind up the tile for this generation and never let him see never learns to see and then the next generation after a while children well that the lineage will be born unable to see now because if we don't use our senses they become dormant that won't act at all and that's what the church has done to the sixth sense of faith that God put in him he played you know we placed faith off you know that we we don't have miracles no more we don't have healing we don't have and we set our eyes to faith until we refuse to see that science or to follow them that believe and we did we disk with this phantom and we become sightless and I'm being able to believe it's miracles and I just want you to understand this is all things we've had generations generations of chirps religion that is foot blinders on the eyes of the people Jason miracles are passive it was only for them and it ain't for now and God can but not God will all of the other mirrors and generations of unbelief until we got Christians who are born blind and faithless because they're only born with intellectual faith but God wants his children to have prevailing faith he wants them to have his faith amen to live by the faith of the Son of God a man so again we we begin to have things and and and first thing you know it's we know that a lot of it is because there's a lack of faith that is priest you can I just say something the reason they're not miracles that are happening in the Lutheran Church is because they're not taught it's not preached it's not preached Jesus is the saying I'm not picking on the Luther Jews any denomination you want to the reason it's not happening is because they have generations of black preachers who passed on their blindness and they passed out and the children born in those churches are born blind and they don't know the god of miracles they don't know God who heals a God who delivers kind of bring it down just a little more this is a problem around the the message today is we got too many blind preachers who are raising generations of blind people that can only talk about they could see back in the prophet's day but that was only for the prophet it can only be back there there's not now you know oh don't try to be the Prophet I'll tell you what Elijah wanted to be Elijah except he wanted a devil portion I mean what's wrong with us saying we want to be everything we saw what a son of God could do and what God could do suffer God in this generation why can't we be a son just like that son a man if he was a sheep that was wave saying there's more to come then there's gotta be a people ride that straight just like he had faith that believe just like he believed and preachers who are not binding their children it's a lack of faith being preached into the people faith has to be preached into the people that makes them let that sixth sense which is faith and it must not lay dormant it has to be preached and active faith so I'm preaching on these things brother Taylor couldn't you preach Ilsan brother Branham preached on perfect faith this is what we must have so you know again we can have preaching that actually neglects faith yet we can pre so hold my flower these sermons of great mysteries and oh my we don't even have the basic element of faith can't even see because you're to walk by faith but if you won't buy me you'll fall in the ditch this is Bible teaching hey man so we must we must have faith preached so you see the preaching of faith um Kenda can bring faith or the the priam preaching that neglects faith will cause blind children and the word preached without faith is a letter that kills and it does not bring to life but if the Bible said the word preached did not profit them it dude it didn't do them any good to hear the seals are open the mysteries revealed and oh these great wonderful truths and look at them in marvel it doesn't do any good to preach it unless we mix it with faith you know what I preached the other day about the opening of the seals and the title deed of redemption and the clearing of the deed let me ask you something brother Johnny did that give you faith man did that give you faith they give you faith and gave us all faith to know our deed is clear that's what the word preach has got to do it must produce faith faith to want to know who you are to know your position not just to know your enemy but to know who you are hey Matt but I want you to just stop for a moment we've got a lot of preaching today that that binds faith sometimes preach this preaching declares that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is only a temporal gift but that's only true if you're Balaam our seller KF is's and you're just anointed and ain't nothing temporary about the Holy Ghost it's eternal how could we call it temporary for us it's an eternal gift and when it's a gift he can't get he's not the Indian giver he never touched it back Oh somebody help me preach there man he God's not an Indian giver if he gave you the Holy Ghost he's not gonna take it back [Applause] I'm on notice notice again you see again the holy ghost our buys it dwells within them and it seals them until the day of redemption I want you to know the Holy Ghost you received is not temporary I stood I sat in a congregation I heard a preacher preach and he's the one the Holy Ghost we got today won't keep you and I looked at him and said huh well who wants it what good is it if it won't keep me I want you to know it will not only save you it'll keep you it not only cleanses you it fills you it not only feels you it sells you how long to the day of redemption to the day your body has changed Alleluia a man but more this faithless preach and say well the word develop the day of Pentecost will work today and when you take that out of context it's used to blind people and make them faithless hey man I want you to know this is the same doctrine that Paul preached this is the same word backward teaching by teaching line by line letter by letter we have returned back to the land of Pentecost back to the book of Acts and somebody here to help me preach we have returned wait a minute the book of Acts means the book of actions but we're the only up society in this people it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles laxa the Holy Ghost said the Apostle a man that we pray you know oh he go we want to preach and talk about all of the failures and all the problems and all the things they had in the book of Acts that's not what's being restored God ain't bringing us back to the bitterness and the problems and the failures of the book of Acts he bringing us back to the victories now you're the vine he's the vine we're the branches that's the doctrine of the vine the first vines the second branch has to produce the same doctrine if he's the mind with the branches whatever the doctor was and them in the in the in the vine has to be in the branch and the branch comes on the vine it'll do the same thing that the mind did a mind and you say well brother deal what about that and what word won't work but we don't have to we don't have to wait in the city of Jerusalem we don't have to make a trip back to Mecca or to Jerusalem to be endued with power from on high we don't even have to wait for the Holy Ghost anymore it's already here you can receive it today and then the reason why they had to wait is because the sacrifice had just been made and he was a sinner in heaven to make the presentation on what the blood is done so he can send back the Holy Spirit the life of the blood to come live in the church and that's why they had the way but we don't have to wait anymore we're not waiting on the atonement to be complete the Tollman is complete it is a bullet time and we can receive the holy up oh my you can receive it right in your seat you can receive it right this moment you do not have to wait on it any longer now you know there again unbelief blind in faith lambs left the mercy seat because the only atone fragrance why he certainly did atone for ignorance but it's ignorant to say that's all he atoned for that's pretty ignorant a man Heath he atoned for unbelief sin of every kind he atone for sickness every sickness there he is a man he took those tracks in his body Amen oh my when we just realized that's why there's healing and communions amen because the blood saved us but the facts healed us a man the bread that the body that was broken heals us come on man that's why that's why we're healing because it's in the atomic a man oh you know again again we were he's not off the mercy seat he's right to here and will remain until the physical return of Jesus Christ and he today the Bible's clear he ever liveth to make intercession this is a reason he lives he limps listen what he lives for you know sometimes people oh man I I just have to live for another by the Mamas chocolate cake I just live for my first cup of coffee but Jesus lives he ever lives he can't wait it seems delight to intercede on your behalf for you to take your burden and cast it upon him now he's got the cure for your cancer for your sickness for your pornography for your sin for whatever he's got the cure that you can cast your cares on him for he lives to do it I know this is not a repeat of Pentecost no never again where the Holy Ghost fall upon 100 Jews 120 Jews in the upper room and speaking mirrors of languages as as it did there but it'll fall on individuals it'll feel them and these signs shall follow them that believe and in my name they shall cast out devils and they will speak in tongues they'll prophesy they'll cast out devils but any message that blinds the people from a Living Christ is a perverted message of Satan and that's what's being offered into many churches today is a dead religion it's a dead religion of cold creeds saying the days of miracles are past now you know I I don't know about you know but I I like my food hot if my wife fixes me a bowl of soup and it ain't hot enough I said look get some more heat on this I can't eat this cold man I've never been a fan of cold sandwiches now you may like them that's okay but I won't mine throat in the griddle and I wanted heated from top to bottom and toasted on both sides I don't like cold food and when he so told us to serve the lamb he said don't serving cold rusev on fire ooh I haven't let the fire go out in the churches ever serving cold Creed's it will not satisfy the hunger of God's children they have their food hot they gotta bed gotta be sure with fire the Holy Ghost get out over what good is a sermon if it's cold what good is a message images a better cold theology it ain't no good get the fire the Holy Ghost warming that food moving in the church moving in the people who warm their bellies fire the energy to go out and meet the devil what is the message well it's not a gospel different from what Paul preached brother Branham was told when he went beyond the curtain of time that he'd be judged as to how he compared with Paul's gospel Romans 2:16 says God should judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel Paul would say to the Galatians I'm surprised you've turned another gospel which there is no other but rather a make-believe gospel just such a nomination of fiction you turn from the good news of our resurrected Lord Jesus and I want to say today who has bewitched us that we obey not the truth what kind of spirit would want to get in I'm on the stair that would would pull our focus away from who Jesus is because it's in who he is as to who we are man it's because of his atonement it's the reason we can stand where we stand a man we cannot turn from the good news of our resurrected Lord that good news of a resurrected Christ says it because I live you shall live also John 14:12 said the words that I do will identify you and the works that I do you son do all so I took by a church today on the way not picking on them you know I'm trying to not try to go with them as far as I can understand but it was a church said and they put a sign we preach Christ and him crucified well that's the problem as we're preaching and dead Christ we're preaching Christ and him dead and I say that's the fault that's the problem oh man that's the crux of the matter I want to declare today he was crucified these are living Christ I'm not preaching this they crucified Christ but I'm preaching a resurrected Christ a living Christ with a living faith and a fate that prevails and that's what our focus has got to be on a prevailing faith a faith that will overcome in the worst of crisis of faith that will overcome when everybody around you falls when the contemporaries around you are in every kind of evil thing and yet you keep living why because I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave His life for me god bless you that the musicians come you can find the key for that old song we used to sing we should still sing it I care not today what tomorrow may bring weather sunshine or shadow or rain the Lord that I know he rule is over everything and it's useless to worry all my worries in vain [Music] how many wants to be a church today that lives by faith the just shall live by faith I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave his life for me
