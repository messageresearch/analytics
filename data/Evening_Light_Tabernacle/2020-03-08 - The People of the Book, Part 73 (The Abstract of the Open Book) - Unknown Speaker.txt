praise and all our honor a man I believe he deserves in this morning he meant we've seen him heal diseases we've seen him save the loss we've seen him move miraculously among us he deserves our praise this morning a man in our glory oh thank you Jesus let's just stand together as we take some knees before the Lord brother Joe if you could just get ready to open our service in prayer amen we just want to remember all the shut-ins this morning those in the nursing homes I was unable to make it today elderly brother sister Hollis different ones a man they would love to be here no doubt man we just had some more with him today also remember the Tim winters he's been really having some issues with his back and so it's really been giving him a lot of issues as far as working things even I believe that God is big enough for back problems he took those stripes he knows what back problems are he knows what it's like for his back to hurt and have issues they're not better to carry the weight so we want to just remember our brother in prayer also definitely want to continue to member brother on on Friday he had brain surgery to remove the tumors and the doctors were very pleased with how it went and said that they were they were just looking for a full recovery in that in that area and so but he still having of course some bad headaches from it and also some blood pressure issues there at 2 o'clock today which I guess would be one o'clock hour time they're gonna have an MRI just to go back and check things make sure everything is ok so we're just believing that it's all ok amen and so is his pain levels been about eight he says but just as yesterday it went down to around five but I believe in a God that can make it zero a man and so that's what we're looking for him and put his blood pressure to become normal and also he's still having issues with his peripheral vision but as we've been testified or the Darrell Ward talked about you know how his daughter was in that accident and lost her vision but it began to come back and the peripheral vision was one of the last things returned but there was a lamb for her and also testified from about my mother and her vision that she lost but there was a lamb for her and I believe the lamb is still on the throne he's still the intercessor for this need and and I believe if he did it once he'll do it again a man and he's just that kind of God and so we want to just go together as believers let's pray together amen lift you in your voice any man is brother Joe comes he comes to lead in prayer but they each and every one prayed to the morning ask God to move for these situations today if you have a need you want to make it known to him you can definitely lift your hand and say Lord I have a need today come by my way Amen let's just pray together man before we bow for prayer just want to share report as many of you know I was out last week there in Tucson ministering for brother Matt Watkins brother Matt sent a message to brother Tim he just said I wanted to tell you that the Lord used brother Joe Adams in a very special way in Tucson I never received so many reports from a single service both were good but the morning service broke out into an altar call many came back to the Lord to gave their hearts to the Lord many were delivered from spirits of anxiety depression joy was restored to set free from addictions from demon spirits even two young men requested to stay in the sanctuary between the two services to pray and they stayed there at the at the altar until the evening service because I'm still receiving texts concerning how the Lord used brother Joe in a special way and I was just remarking to brother brother Matt by the Matthew and he said well you know you mentioned in there that you felt the presence of the Lord I mentioned to him I said I was about five people into the prayer line and I felt an anointing just come and stand right beside me as I began to pray and there's just a presence that you don't always feel but you know he's there but this in particular service he was there I felt that he was there and not only did I feel that he was there the people I was praying for begin to step into that presence and you know they were able to get the deliverance that they needed and I administered administered on God will meet your expectations and brother Branham preached expectations in 1961 in that same Tabernacle behind the same pulpit before it became Tucson tabernacle and I believe he's still God today he's here this morning to meet your expectations the Bible says he would do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think think about your greatest thought your greatest desire your greatest prayer your greatest ambition the God that we serve will super abundantly meet and exceed what you can eat them fathom so if you've got a need here today I believe we have a God that'll meet that need I believe we serve a God I surpass that need so let's just take our knees to the Lord in prayer father how we thank you for your grace this morning how we thank you Lord that you don't leave us here in laodicea drifting through fighting through Lourdes trying to get by on our own but we serve a living God a present help in our times of trouble and we believe today father that you're the same yesterday today and forever that's not a cliche that's not just terminology of a message but Lord for the believer we trust in that we believe that the same God that we relied on yesterday is gonna be the same God that's gonna meet us this morning he's gonna be the same God that a carry us through tomorrow when we face trials and afflictions ahead and we believe today father you're still a healer you're still a deliverer and we're asking blow it on the wings of our prayer this morning that you'll go to those that are in need today father you Lord your work declares and by your stripes we are already healed father may we reach up on the pulsation of the word this morning and grab hold to that promise well if there's those in need in their body this morning father may they just grab hold of that pulsation and claim that healing and claim that deliverance dear God we pray Lord for the Hollis's that are shut in and the others that are shut in this morning God may you just touch them continue to give strength to their bodies Lord we pray for brother Tim winters father down in this back truly Lord anybody that's ever hurt their back understands the affliction and the pain and the agony but Lord we believe in that God that heals today we believe in a God that can restore the back problem Lord God and get away completely and we're asking that you'll move on my scene this morning father and when we pray for brother Ron continue to lift our brother up in prayer we believe in a supernatural we believe we're gonna see miracles not only we're gonna see miracles Lord but we believe this morning that we are miracles everyone here this morning look that's been changed by the blood of Jesus they're a miracle and this our Father now may your Holy Spirit just flood into that hospital room this morning Lord and when he goes in for it in my ride father may not find anything there but may the God that restores may he begin to move right now father and making the restore his eyesight begin to restore his body to perfect health God we believe it therefore we speak it and we accept it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and what I believe you're to hear today to not only meet our expectations but take see them Lord to do super abundantly father more than we can fathom may this service this morning not just be another service but God may it be a service where your people come under an expectation to see God to feel God to experience the supernatural Lord you promised another outpouring of the Holy Spirit may we be the recipients of that outpouring this morning father now we just commit to service into your hands all the souls that'll be sung may they just tread an atmosphere Paul the worshipers in the congregation may they begin to create an atmosphere God and when the word comes forth may you show up father and just come and be able to break the bread of life to us this morning for we ask it in Jesus name Amen [Music] give us unto the Lord don't forget we have two services today 4:30 and

believing there would be the age we can't be any different and man no matter how much time passes and things changes the delay seems to be longer you hold on to that promise I'm coming back for people a man who had made herself ready let's believe him with all our hearts this morning let's prepare our hearts for that coming a man let's bow our heads together god bless you all as we just look to the Lord now just for a moment whenever one of you just to gather your thoughts in your hearts you just concentrate just for a moment on him who made the promise ask him to speak to you personally today father were your children and we have gathered in your name Lord it's wonderful that we could say in the name of the Lord I have come and here we are Lord today in your name we have been commanded to come and assemble ourselves together Lord even so much the more as we see that day approaching and here we are today as we come on the first day of the week to honor your resurrection we just ask Lord

seeking you today Lord with all their heart may this be the day they find you but those that are that are walking the Emmaus walk and may be going in the wrong direction Oh God away from where you told them to go may it be today that you join near them and walk with them and just open up the eyes of their understanding in the scripture to them so that they'll turn and go back seeing that you're the resurrected one and that you're still doing the same things you did 2,000 years ago Lord I ask God that ever was sold and is walking with you today in unity and harmony with the word made today they just get a refreshin of the Holy Spirit and he just comes so real and alive to them as we look into the word I pray God did you open up the scripture to us and our understanding would come open we not might know the hope of our calling in Christ Jesus father ever needs supply now we pray in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you amen and they're always good to be in the house of the Lord and amen have the privilege of serving him we want to welcome each one of you today and those that are with us that aren't normally here but you're gathered with us this morning we're just really they're happy to have each one of you that has assembled with us if you'll turn with me to Revelation chapter 5 we're going to read from the first verse and as you're turning just reminding you we have the two services today and we try to come back for the second service about 4:30 and between that we're going to be having a little bit of a business meeting and just discussing some of the things on the church if you're your if you tend to hear regularly and pay your tithes here you're welcome to come to that meeting and we're going to try that about four o'clock and we'll see how it works out anyway revelations five and verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and god bless his word you can be seated this morning we're going to be continuing our thought about the abstract and we'll be getting into some other portions of this as we go along I want to speak about this because you know because it deals with art legal rights and what God has promised for RJ and so we're going to be speaking on the abstract to the open book as we're looking this because we're living in the day with the book is no longer closed but God has opened the book and brought us back to Paul's gospel were that we can preach exactly what Paul preached and we're looking at the scene and we see the one on the throne is the creator of the universe and of course he holds the title in his hand and it's a book and that book is a title to everything that man lost and this book of course is the believer because it represents every believer and I believe that every one of our names are in this book and I'm glad to say that we have seen our names in the book of redemption every one that has been redeemed and saved he lets you know I've chosen you before the world began a man and so the book is a title to all that man lost represents every believer but it must be claimed or all hope for a resurrection of the New Testament Saints is lost and the call goes out for a worthy man and the book of Courts has held it in the hands of God on the throne but but the possession must move from God's hands back to man's hands and and of course we can look back in the historical records of the scripture and we can see that Matthew taught us and told us gave us a real clue of what happened at the resurrection when we learned that Jesus paid the debt of all mankind that the Old Testament Saints before us they have already obtained what Adam lost in the sense that they were resurrected from the from spoonful of ashes and they are now in immortal bodies Paul told us of Abel and Enoch and Noah Abraham Sarah Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses and Rahab and then in hebrews 11:32 he he just says and what shall i say more for the time would fail me to tell of gideon of ab a rock and of samson objecting and david also and samuel the prophets and who through faith subdued kingdoms and wrought righteousness and obtained promises and stopped the mouth of the Lions and quinces the violence of the fire and escaped the edge of the sword and out of weakness were made strong and waxed valiant in fight and turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others that cruel trial of cruel mockings and scourgings jaya moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned and that was sawn asunder and they were tempted and were slain with the sword and that wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute and afflicted and tormented of whom this world was not worthy they wandered in in deserts and and mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise but God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect they won't be complete without us so even though that they are in redeemed bodies and wait in heaven there that the earth has not been returned back to man again it is still under the power of the Prince of the power of the air which is Satan but at Calvary we know jesus paid redemptive price and there the Old Testament Saints race and doing corpora and corruptible bodies and ascended with Jesus in the heaven because Jesus cleared their debt now so he gave them the church and abstract are a cleared deed so understand this when Jesus paid the price at Calvary he provided an abstract and cleared the deed of all the records against the Old Testament Saints and not only the Old Testament Saints in that that he cleared the deed of where they failure to keep the law under failure to walk perfect and then he would he would redeem them and to set them free from from the place called paradise and they would come back to the earth and they would resurrect and there they would a sin with him and so you can see their death was completely cleared but then Jesus would send back an abstract on the day of Pentecost which is a clear deed so if you look let me just share it with you a little quote turn from brother Branham and God's provided places of worship he said let's take a look at those faithful ones at Pentecost they were all in the upper room there and they were all scared they had the title alright but they were afraid and all at once that came a sound from heaven the abstract was sent down to them like a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they were so quickened by that to all their cloudiness and one of them was even afraid that even denied he wasn't even a Pharisee yet or a Sadducees yet but when the Holy Ghost fell and baptized him into Jesus Christ he became flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and word of his word he was a new creation he was a new person it quickened his body so the early church we know could have been raptured had they not been planted as a seed because God had more names in the book beside them so you see he had to wait until every name on the book was manifested on the earth and their deed cleared so you see now again the court of wheat would have been would have to be planted it would come up again as a blade at aussolas shop until it comes back again for a harvest time and I'd like to report this morning we are back at a harvest season we are actually at another Pentecost and we have come down to the last stage we have had a week of ages and we are here now at the end of the seventh eighth the word Pentecost means 50 it occurred um it occurred seven weeks after the Passover the Passover would begin with a lamb without blemish and then the lamb was slain and then it would be serviced with unleavened bread and this Passover Feast was the beginning of the feast of unleavened bread and that feast of unleavened bread would go for seven days at which would also again represent seven church ages because we were are supposed to have been fed unleavened bread for the past seven church ages and so brother Branham would tell us in the rapture message he says as I was speaking in the communion when they kill that sacrificial lamb there was to be no leaven among them through the entire seven days no leaven no leavened bread everything had to be unleavened that represented the seven churches that we just get that we get in the book here and there's no leaven it is what it is something mixed with it and we mixed Creed and denomination everything else with the word and still try to call it the word no leaven shall be the entire seven days again and things are to be he would say similar common the southern Church ages in no no 11 no creed no nothing added it had to be absolutely unleavened bread no leaven shall be found among you at all just eleventh unleavened the word itself that only and that's the Word of God so you see this this whole feast of unleavened bread but also represent seven church ages and and this is where the real true bride of every age must eat the word only a man so let you know again we come down here to the end it's really important we keep the message pure man Lebanon and the bread will get you rejected we don't want to put our own ideas to the message also in the types is the Jubilee year and in action Israel ever 7 years was a Sabbath year and then after seven seventh years which would be seven times seven came at Jubilee and the Jubilee was a time where every man went back to his own possession it was a time of where every ever slave of Israel would receive personal freedom and the canceling of death and the restoration of poor a property so you know this is a very important time but you believe a time where slaves feel free and man of time where property is restored a time where again you get an abstract or the cancelling of debt and ever lien against the property is taken off this is really important because we are now in another Jubilee we have reached the seventh age of seven weeks of years and again is typed out we're at another Jubilee hey man it's illegal for Satan to make any of us slaves I'm and it's illegal the freedom bell rings the ram horn blows hey man it involved it blowing of the ram's horn the trumpet and the hole represents the Rams power I'm Manning through the round and the sounding of his trumpet every man went back to his possession and every slave of Israel was free oh I think of that here was that we are right back to the beginning again were that we go back to what was lost at Pentecost amen in the first stage and the death of every age has been canceled and every slave a denomination has now been set free and we can walk as children of God and the glorious liberty of Jesus Christ amen now so all of these were types and and on the and of course the 50th day after Passover was now after seven weeks had transpired would come the day of Pentecost and the fiftieth day is is really a representative of the Jubilee the 50th year and in the Old Testament each of the seven Sabbath represented a land rest and and of that would be followed by the fiftieth day and then and then on Pentecost that law was given in Exodus 19 and and the Ten Commandments were given and on Pentecost and again in the New Testament the Holy Spirit was given and that's to I think it's wonderful when we just compare it as the Holy Spirit would bring it down to the types in the Bible here after the Passover lamb was slain in the Exodus they would journey through the wilderness to finally Mount Sinai and they would come to the Mount of God and it would be seven weeks after the Passover and on the day of Pentecost the first Pentecost it would be the upon the mountain God would give the law his covenant to Israel hallelujah and so he would give that called that covenant the law to Israel and and and it would be there that God would take Israel for a bride are you with me and he would covenant with him but immediately we remember as soon as the law is given there they could wait for even the law to come down from the mountain without them breaking the Word of God and man and what happened there that word Arabelle and begin to worship a golden calf and with after worshiping the golden calf then the gold from it would be taken and ground up in powder and sewed into the waters and the people would drink of that water and then there would be 3000 of them died now but I want you to notice in the New Testament it would begin also with something happening it would be with again 50 days after the Passover after Jesus would die the true Lamb of God and there the law the Word of God would be given again and it would be written by the finger of God like the first law because they're on the Mount Sinai the finger of God would write the law in tablets of stone but now on the day of Pentecost God would take his finger and he would write not in tablets of stone but in the heart and he would change the very nature of man and put the Word of God as something is not external but something now internal whether you're not you're not obeying the word from a laws of sound and thou shalt not but now the word is living in you a man that has kept because it's the divine nature that is written in the life are you with me now and there on the day of Pentecost is somebody with me on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit would come down right in the word into the heart of the believer the fire of glob coming down like tongues of fire and carving out within the nature of matter put it in there the Word of God writing it in his nature hallelujah a mound and immediately as the news broke instead of three thousand died and three thousands were added to the church because the Old Testament was a covenant of death but this is a covenant of life now it's very interesting that at the beginning of the countdown from the Passover to Pentecost that after at the very beginning of the Passover and the countdown begins when they when the there is a barley wave offering this was the first fruit of the harvest season the barley would ripen before the wheat which would actually be 50 days later so there would be a span of seven weeks between the two harvest and so that the day after the Passover there under the first day of the week it would be that the priest would take the the the first of the barley and he would take him and impress it and he would make enormous of OMERS that he would hold of this barley and he would wave it before the Lord and it was saying in that that though it was given a thanks offering to God for the harvests but it was saying all while so it was thanking God for the rest that would be harvested hey man so now it is striking to know that when Jesus arose from the dead early in the morning and he makes his appearing to Mary Magdalene and to those at the tomb that in that moment in that time at that same time the high priest is in the temple and he has taken the first of the harvest and he is waving it before the Lord amen and at the same time Jesus raised from the dead as the firstfruits of the Resurrection and all the Old Testament Saints rise with him hallelujah a man and a percentage of Jehovah has a representative of the Saints that are yet to come hallelujah God is already Smith he has already been praised and thanked him for the great harvest here in this end time that he'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle it was identified in Jesus Christ the Bible said it in first Corinthians 15:20 that Jesus had become the firstfruits of them that slept a man now it was concluded that after that at the end of the countdown to Pentecost was when there would be a wheat harvest wave offering now notice two wave offerings one for the barri and one for the wheat and so it would be 50 days after the barley has been waved and it would be now the wheats turn to be weighed and of course it represents those Saints at the end of the age that would also be up from the grave here at this last day at this Pentecost because we are here in a Pentecost you see Jesus died the Passover lamb and he was the first fruit and the fever's the first fruit of the resurrection two ones are the Old Testament this was a barley harvest he was a sheaf wave he was the abstract holder he had cleared the deed and with him came up Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all the righteous dead of the Old Testament and all the paradises emptied that holding place where they were waiting for the one worthy the worthy Lamb that can pay redemption price but I want you to know that we are now in the seventh week or seven Church ages later in the harvest season in the week harvest season are you with me two thousand years ago was the barley the Old Testament they raised from the dead a man but now we are advanced to two thousand years forward seven Church ages later a man to wear that it's now a time for the for the the day of Pentecost for the very Holy Spirit to raise up a bride in this in time that it will wave before the world to say all of them will be raised just like this one has raised from the dead of the tombs of denomination all the dead and Christ were raised just like they have raised do we harvest the first ripened grains of the wheat their ground and baked until the two loaves of bread Norway before the Lord for there's to be another resurrection in this end time of the New Testament believers I believe we're in the hour of the resurrection I keep saying and I'll tell you again 1st Thessalonians 4 is not the funeral scripture and man if you know first Corinthians 15 is not just a funeral scripture and Manny it is a scripture it is a word that has been left to be fulfilled here in the end time we must keep our level of expectancy for the Word of God to be manifest among us until even the dead in Christ rise and appear among us who were changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye now notice here the coming of the Holy Ghost was at the same time on the day of Pentecost it was at the same time the priests were waving the wheat loaves in the temple so just as it was 50 days before it after the Passover and Jesus raised from the dead on the first day of the week the priests were waving the OMERS of the barley and saying you know this is the firstfruits and pronouncing the blessing on the harvest that at the same time now on the day of Pentecost there when they were gathered in the upper room over here in the temple there were the priests and they were holding up the wave loads of Pentecost of the bread of the wheat bread and was waving them before the Lord and at the same time that they are they're waving out the type over here in the upper room [Music] hallelujah amen where the Passover Feast was had been served in the upper room now on the day of Pentecost here comes a sound from heaven and it's not it's not just a type that is happening but the Holy Spirit Himself is coming down and begins to wave like a rushing mighty wind as the promise of the word has comes down and is being waved over the people hallelujah what was God doing by this waving of the Holy Ghost in the upper room his tongues of fire came down like a rushing mighty wind he was sending an abstract of title suing that the lamb was accepted in heaven come out and his blood - had a tone and sin debt was paid and the harvest was beginning Alleluia brother Branham told us and it is the rising of the Sun and bear with me as I read this quotations here but he said notice it was the first corn of God's wheat that it raised from the dead God's first quart of wheat you see they were dead and since trespasses but now they were raising up into life a man by God's quickening power got it quick in his life and raised him of them to death and he was the firstfruits of those who slept the first fruit he was that chief that's why they had to wave that chief it was the first one they come to maturity and it was waves as a memorial Thanksgiving that God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign and today because he is the first son of God to come to maturity to be in God he was plucked up from the earth and is waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had been tight many times but this was really the first fruits of them that slept he was waved over the promised seed that had promise of life and he was waved at the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty Russian wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that were at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come now watch and then he carries it over to our day and in order for this to happen there has to be another Pentecost and he said it is to be waived again we realize in the last day according to Luke 1730 in the Sunday again in the day that the CSO in a man will be revealed or waived over the people amen now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the Word of God by word of god by signs by wonders and we see today in the Book of Luke here's a 70 chapter xxx verse and Malik had formed the different scriptures that we were acquainted with that that word is a camera wave over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right among us giving us life hallelujah brother Branham was telling us that the word the coming of the word the restoration of the word in this day was bringing another Pentecost a man another waving of the sheaf and it was the word this time not not the person Jesus come on but now the person of the word being way back over the people what was it doing it was announcing we are in a harvest season and every son and daughter of God is going to be the word just like he's the word a man as a Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although type 2 many places he was the firstfruits of those who slept in the bright command of Christ what sis now we know 2,000 years ago he came as the groom but somebody help me now in this day yeah we're going to meet him in there the right will be the body form of Jesus Christ we will meet the physical body of Jesus Christ in the air that's what believers believe a man but in order for there to be a rapture there has to be a manifestation of Christ on the earth but this time not in grim form but in bribe form Alleluia so in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church don't have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days hallelujah the waving of the sheep what was the scene the first one that come to mature the first that proved it was a week that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people do you realize here we come down after 2,000 years and it's great time again that what was planted is now coming to fruition what was there on the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts is now manifested in bride for hallelujah there's been a star blade and there's been a stock and there's been a tussle and there's been a shock somebody helped me but now it comes back to again maturity get that word in your mind of maturity of mature church Alleluia that he's gonna that he takes to waver a man to his same signs have wandered through that same bride listen nobody said but for the first time will come forth for the bride a for resurrection out of dark denominationalism stop right there you were in the tent Baptists to Methodist tomb Pentecostal tomb they sealed your way come on put seals upon you you're not going to come out of there you got to remain dead we're gonna make sure the church stays dead there won't be any signs there won't be any wonders there won't be any miracles there won't be come on somebody can't be manifested in his power it's just got to go into corruption dead in tombs and man all of you were dead in tombs mom but I tell you him there there is a message and that message is declaring that the term has been open [Applause] and we no longer have to stay at dead forms of religion but there is a bride that has risen out that is come forth after two thousand years a man that feels alive now we talk about Jesus being alive let me talk a minute about this ride being alive man she's not a dead church she's a living Church she's a live church a man I'm full of the power of the Resurrection in life all for the first time there come forth for the bride a a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message Alleluia our message says not only does he live but you also live i message says you can't remain dead how do you some of you sitting here and sins and dad and dad and in trespasses but I'm just an ounce until you can't remain dead there is a message that is saying that the bride is rising might she not remaining in the tombs she's a living bride hallelujah and that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in full power and is being waved over the people but the same signs and wonders that he did there Amen because I live ye shall live also speaking to his wife because I live you shall live also what a resurrection that was oh my we got churches around the world today honoring the resurrection - meeting them Sunday they're talking about Jesus roads in which the glad he did because without that resurrection we would be lost is that right man but I'll tell you what a resurrection that was but what resurrection this is I'm going to be quickened from the dead to be made alive by in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power you see it ain't enough for Jesus to rise you two have got a rise because I live you're gonna live because the groom and the bride is gonna live hallelujah the same works that he did so you knew also and greater than these rock go to my father because the bride is not to be a dead church cxeh be a living vibrant church he was waved to them the word which he was waved to them back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest and he said and as I say it's to be waved again in the last day I'm just telling you get ready your own display a man in your own display a man it's a sign - it's a it's a waving unto God your bride is bone of your bone and flesh is fresh but it's also waving to our enemies to Satan itself that Satan is not triumphant that with the raising of this bride will come as the firstfruits of the resurrection will come all the dead in Christ and the halt of the Oh new testament church so what a day that we're living in now the descending of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost was the giving of an abstract to the believers to every believer that received it that their sin that was paid I'm gonna tell you they got a Jubilee this is why they came out of the Upper Room like did yet because they got a revelation my sins and paid my debt is over even I care will not be a slave to Satan any longer man I can return back to the property and then everything that Jesus paid for his mind hallelujah because he cancelled the debt a man so you see that that the sending of the Holy Spirit on that day of Pentecost was given an abstract of title to those believers now we come to the last days seven Church ages now after the Passover let's just go back and there's been the Passover where Jesus died at Calvary and we've marked now seven Church ages and it brings us to another day of Pentecost and we need once again the clearing of the deed because of the unbelief of the ages I'm gonna I'm gonna deal with this just for a little bit because I want you to understand why we need a clear deed we need the clearing of the deed because of the unbelief and the sins of the ages this is why that when you look in the book of Revelation which is a book allotted to the last day remember it was not even for their time was that even written when Paul was here upon the earth it would be written after Paul it would be the last book and it would be written in symbols because it would be reserved for last day people so I want you when you think about the book of Revelation is actually the apocalypse or the unveiling the unveiling of Jesus Christ it is showing his plan of redemption so now again when we look at it we see in this book of Revelation that there's the book that Jesus paid for but yet the book is closed it is held in the hands of God and it can only be taken by a worthy man to step forth from eternity and to take the book and to open its seals want you to get that I want you to get a visual here now when when we see it open in Revelation 5 it's a closed book but it ends with an open book and it concludes that chapter with all creation worshiping God so it is a process I mean the seals on the book keep it closed and it is closed but no man is worthy to look on the book it isn't you know it isn't we just can't take the book we can't even look at it now we went through it last week on how the seals were put on the book we know it was done by the Antichrist and it was kept and it has kept the rapture from the church for the past 2,000 years until and and and God has been waiting year after year until every name is manifested on earth whose names are in the Lamb's Book of Life now men throughout the ages wanted to enforce a claim for the book for example as we will look we'll talk about the different ones and even the ages prior to this but there was no man worthy there was no prophet there was no priest there was no Moses it was no Elijah there was no messenger the ages that was worthy and it could only be done until the worthy man is found and only until he claims the book now 2,000 years ago we had the purchasing and then and then of course we have had the an accessory work now for 2,000 years while Jesus has interceded waiting for every name in the book to be called and it manifests it on the earth as huh as hurry as I am for the rapture I can't go until your name is revealed in the book and map that means I'm waiting on you wherever you are around the world and man I'm waiting for your name to be revealed amen I pray it'll be this morning that you'll see your name in the book hallelujah amen brother Branham talked about he said John muster saw his name in the book that's why he was rejoicing I'll tell you what when you get to see your name in the book it'll make you start rejoicing to you start shouting a man until all the heavens hear you shout amen because you see your name and the book of Redemption I know what he did to me I know whether to do for you hallelujah - no ha ha was in his thoughts and he could never leave me out but now there would be men like Luther let's just imagine loser would probe into the book he wanted to understand the mysteries and you know he he understood what he could he probed into it enough and in the end would try and try to look you know on an unworthy man trying to understand what what was in the book redemption how to be redeemed want to understand the mysteries Luther wanted a rapture he wanted a body changed - he wanted to be the age that delivers all nature I let's just imagine and the loser spits up to claim the book and he says you know I probed in there and as I've seen - just shall live by faith but the accuser of the Brethren secret stem cells but I still got a claim on Luther you see we got a deed but we need an abstract and the abstract pays the debt that is against the man to take possession and so he said I've got a claim on Luther he only has justification all the revelation he's glad of the new birth is there just shall live by faith and he still got my my Trinitarian baptism you know the Trinitarian baptism is not gods it's Satan's a man and he's got you get there again he's it's got my my Trinitarian baptism in fact of the matter is if you want to go back to it for a moment the Roman Catholic Church will tell you it's their baptism and said anyone baptized in the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost is baptized into the Catholic Church because it's their baptism the Trinity formula was not even developed as 300 and some years after after the disciples everywhere in the Bible everybody used the name of Jesus Christ cuz it's the only name given among men whereby we must be safe there is no salvation and any other name but the name of Jesus Christ what are you doing word or deed you got to do it in the name of Jesus like I said and the water baptism is a part of salvation he that believeth and they're baptized shall be saved that's a part of salvation and the Bible said that his name is the only name given among men whereby we must be saved that right so you can say but he still has my baptism and he hasn't come to a full birth he's still just a child there is there is Ayaka you know you can't hand him the possession of the land because he's not an age wesley would long to look to deliver all nature and he longed for a rapture in his age Wesley had he tried to claim the book the accuser would have also said well I also got a claim on Wesley though he is sanctified and more qualified than Lutzer and a little more grown-up than Luther he still he's still not a full born son he's not a beige to claim it besides he still sprinkles and he's got my false baptism and he's he's not the the fullness of the word and it's not not even time yet to deliver all nature he's not of age so you know here we come down to this last age and the call goes out who is worthy and John saw no man was worthy so all of the all the efforts of all the ages had not produced and worthy man but then the hour arrives the lamb the one who started the process of redemption he steps Lord from eternity and he takes the book he is worthy amen Satan has no claim on him Amen well this is why he would say we've not the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed what the lion the king has prevailed how did the king do this and then the one on the throne became a man for the purpose of redemption to be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world and so the lion became the lamb were you with me now hey man another words he became the all his own sacrifice he became the attorney a man and he became the atonement himself and he would bear in his body the sins of the world he would bear your sins he would bear my sins he would also be wounded and stripes given to him for your healing man if you're wondering about your healing this morning all you have to do is look at the atonement and there is healing and salvation it's a dual atonement hey man yeah I know I know that healing is Amanar not a major the major is to get people saved but 86% of Jesus ministry was divine healing so it's not too minor is it it was still a major thrust of his ministry to see that not only was the body healed but the soul was saved it's all in the atonement how many's with me a man he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of your peace was upon him and with His stripes you were healed remember it is a finished work Jesus has to do nothing more he has finished the work is that right amen all you got to do is claim it now so again he hears a cry we've not Jonathan euro beer we because no man is worthy but look the lion the king hath prevailed to take the book and he goes to look to see what the king is doing and he sees a lamb Alleluia now the lamb takes the book he does it as kinsman redeemer God become kinfolk to you it's in the hands of a man again not no woolly lamb but a man Jesus John hears that the line is prevailed remember the line is a symbol of the king and he looks and he sees around which the lamb is is a symbol of the sacrifice atonement the priesthood hey man now Jesus was he's not only the lament he is the high priest and man he is the blood all of what was represented for the atonement Jesus is so wrapped up are encapsulated in him as high priest it is it is the sacrifice it is the blood for the atonement it is appeasement for sin now listen what happened I'll judge the King on the throne became our attorney [Music] hallelujah someone wanted someone to say he's no longer the lamb listen it was the lamb who took the book he didn't do it as a line he didn't salaam he didn't do it as the king of glory he did it as the sacrifice so he it was a lamb who opened the seals it was the lamb as intercessor who is interceding as a man with God upon the throne hey man this is Melchizedek Melchizedek Melchizedek was priest and king is that right that means he is attorney or intercessor and judge the same one the same God the same Melchizedek is both King and priest he is both lion and lamb hallelujah I want you to get this for a moment because when we talk about let's just go back to Esther for a moment Esther she she wanted to go before the King but she was afraid you know why she was afraid her husband was alive hey man he was fierce he could get angry real quick he had a quick temper a has us the moment the moment something didn't go his way welcomes your head he had all power in his hands and stru was afraid to go in there is that right because her husband was alive let me tell you about our husband our dog is alive he has Rath he has anger he has judgment he'll burn the world with fire he'll send sinners to hell and the devil with him a man he has anger he has wrath a man he's a liar remember when Esther notice when she walks before the king and he he looks out and sees what's coming there's a change comes all over the houses the king a man and all of a sudden this lion becomes a lamb [Applause] hallelujah and he holds out the Welcome come on here my darlin my bride because to her he is not her her judge he is her attorney somebody help me preach he's not somebody full of wrath with me and you when we go into his present brother something just melts in his heart why ever you want you can be heir with me John there just hops what you will whatever you want yes sir whatever you want little bride just come out in my presence now this Melchizedek he's priest and King he's attorney and he's judge as priest he is an Assessor an attorney to represent our case as king upon the throne he rules on our behalf and he hands the book back to man Christ the Redeemer not another God the same God yet the accuser of the Brethren the prosecutor says you're a sinner you're worthless you're guilty of death and let me tell you that's what the accuser says amen because he's trying to say that you're not worthy he can say that but he can't say it about this man a man this man he has no claim on him there's never come on somebody there was there is no claim there is no accusation that he could bring against this lamb he's without blemish even Pilate would have to say I've handled falls in him come on and then because he was a lamb without blemish now the Antichrist spirit has kept a rupture from the church for nearly 2,000 years but sealing away it's true the truth from us but I want to announce to you that just as there was a sound from heaven back on the first Pentecost and the second Pentecost that heaven has moved on her behalf because it's now time for God to bring redemption purposes down to earth if I can say it like this it's adoption time word that there is a maturing elect bride who is able to receive the book as shown in Revelation 10 8 and have been told go and take the little book and there have been the unit which is open in the hand of the angel would spend of the pond the sea and upon the earth so it shows you that there comes a time where that that the unworthy man John now can go now he's representing the bride he's representing the elect somebody help me revelation 4 he represents the entire churches each caught up into heaven at the end of the age that right so revelation 10 a he represents the entire bride as he it's this word say go and take the little buck that is open in the hand of the angel now again the only way that that could be that we arrived at that time is that there has to come the age again on maturity someone who that's not a child not as below the age but it's our beige that can take the inheritance a man where there is a maturing like bride who is able to receive the book so this is angel adoption where the air rise at the stage of maturity we are not the immature Lutheran Church we are not even the Commons with me we're not even that the immature Methodist Church we're not even the immature Pentecostal Church they were not a book of Acts church they were a Corinthian church one has a tongue and one as a prophecy and what is this and what is that all while sinners in the midst but we've got that kind of a church hallelujah it is a it is an Ephesian Church to where he could say you are chosen before the foundation of the world you have been electric you have been called you and the dispensation of the fullness of time were that all the times are now being wrapped up and finished and you are now arrived at an age where there is a mature bride on earth a man who can take the inheritance now at a mature age when childhood was passed the Romans who Paul would use this custom they had an adult they had a custom dedup a mature son or mature man as a son that means his adoption meant a son was now given power and authority we Westerners think of adoption is when we adopt a child is not her own but that's not what happened the Romans had a custom of adoption where he adopted his own son and placed him in power and authority so adoption in the Roman custom was or was to place a son born in the house into a place of power and authority over his business a man so when his son was adopted he was given legal rights to act in his father's name a man who he hai was hired who he fired was fired this and this is the age of adoption were sons of God are to be revealed and step into their rights and this is what you are seeing in revelation 10 8 after the transfer come on from the hand of God to the Lamb who sends it down the word down by the Holy Spirit a man and the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound his message finish the mysteries but it's not enough it's not enough to come down with the mysteries it's not enough to hand it to a prophet a man for him the sound that you must also take it become one with it digest it let it come on the inside of you or get written on the inside of the nature oh man it's the coming of the abstract where that all the sins of the ages who worked out but in order to do that there must be a mature elect people to take it now and here you him brother branham said this I want to take these last three words for text here you him and he says if we can have obedience to those three words you'll see a repeat of Pentecost and man if we can get the bride just not listening and trying to do like Peter a good man we'll build a we'll build a tabernacle for Moses and we'll build a a tabernacle for Elijah we'll build one for you and we'll get our eyes off a kingdom building for this one in that one and we'll go back to hearing him where the word has preeminence then he said we'll have will see another Pentecost now you know why because if we come back to adopted sons and here you him it'll be receiving the abstract again in other words the clear deed and this is why the same angel of the Covenant remembers this promise and says there will be no more delay no more holding back of the inheritance the time has come to deliver all nature I might give me revelations in 6 let's just look at this let me just bring it and just go back 1 verse and we'll come back to 6 and the angel which I so stand upon the sea of all the earth lifted up his hand to heaven now this is a sworn oath this is God declared with an oath they did this favour ham so I give this land to you and you're seeing and I swam with an out he confirmed it with an elf come on this is what he was there doing on the day of Pentecost he was confirming the resurrection and the power of God well with the weather no the Holy Ghost coming down into individuals but I want you to know here in Revelation 10 and 5 that he swears with an oath are you with me now here again is an oath that God cannot go back home he cannot laugh he cannot back up on his promise somebody help me preach them I might give me the next verse so let's see what it's about he swam by him that liveth forever and ever that's not a man that there should be time no longer this is what he swore there will be time no longer now what it had been referring to there was a time of silence because he said seal up the things of the seven bettors uttered this in the verses before and he told me there's a time was going to be silence it's going to be sealed you're not going to know it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel verse 7 when he said being began the sound the mystery of God should be finished by man as he had declared to his servants the prophets I want you to get this thought God has sworn with an oath that time will be no longer what time time to hold the mysteries back time to keep the book seal there's a time of its sealant and there's a time of its opening but yet he swears I will not leave it closed forever but I'm gonna open it hey man and I'm going to do it in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when the last messenger when there comes another Pentecost a man and it'll be a trumpet angels sounded out a message are you with me it's a ram's horn that is being blowed and it's a jubilee and it says we can return every man back to our possession we can go back to the book of Acts we can go back to what the Turks lost we can go back to total restoration and I'm given you in this age of promise but no matter how long it carries and how long it waits that delay is over hallelujah I want to get into your heart this morning that delay is over the time for holding back is over the time for you to be out of your possession is over the time for you to be a slave to some system of man is over hallelujah the delay is over we've waited for years and years and years and years and seven Church ages since the Passover at Calvary but now the day of Pentecost had fully come and the delay is over you don't have to wait any more we're not in a time of waiting we're in a time of fulfillment even you and your situation this morning whatever if you need to tell the devil the day is over I've heard the trumpet sound I'm throwing down my hope I'm not gonna be come on we just handed the other day we're not gonna be bearing no more the delay is over we've been waiting for sixteen years but the delay is over for a stir a man I'm telling the barren Church and the return of Jesus Christ but the delay is over a man that Jesus Christ has descended from heaven with a shout with a message in this day to turn our hearts back to the faith again imagine there is a people who are given flies through that resurrection and there said I was dead in the tombs of the nomination but I'm not there anymore behold I am alive forevermore and I've got the keys to death hell of hell a Mattel cannot hold me that cannot hold me the grave cannot hold me the delay is over even if you're waiting on the Holy Ghost this morning the delay is over you don't have to delay another day you don't have to work for sin another day you don't have to hold one more weed for the devil another day the delay is over you're sick in your body this morning your delay is over [Applause] hallelujah you got a need in your life that delay is over I'm telling a bearing Church the delay is over we're here in the coming of the Lord it is transpiring as we speak oh no we don't see the dead in Christ yet no we hadn't had a change it no don't don't go to pretending we don't have to pretend hey man we can talk about what's real and what is real is there is a message that it that this bride is not dead anymore she's not bound in chains anymore she's not sealed in a tomb anymore but the first one from the dead I love dr. nomination ilysm is here on your sewing with infallible proof he lives freely else he's alive hallelujah Oh God did this so many times through the prophets Minister but I want you to see even look among us he's showing he lives a man the rich the glorious coming back come on man we got a sign here among us of a little girl who was who was bald and lost all her hair and her glory was Kagome but God has given you a foretaste hey man it's a witness usually brother Tim you're grasping at straws well what are you grasping at a man you think it's just straws he wasn't just a straw it was a whole head full of hair not straws and the glory returned hallelujah I believe the glory is returning to the bride of Jesus Christ I believe there's a Samson owner who's who's gluing a new crop of hair amen the people who are now about to display the very power of God hallelujah sometimes you know we don't know where our paths will take us but brother rod was talking to me about the other day about the peripheral vision being gone and doctors doing an operation maybe losing his sight well he didn't lose the sight but nevertheless he was talking to me about it and I said hey okay if you lose your sight yeah that would be awful but let me just tell you that doesn't take away from our God who is the restorer of sight and there's nothing too hard for the Lord a man you say well brother Tim you're really trying hard to believe I I don't find it hard to believe sorry I don't find it hard to believe that God is God and he's still the healer and it shows with infallible proofs over and over again that he's alive a man that he is not dead but he's alive are you with me a man soul so again again you know the time has come to deliver all nature we're right here in the our part the message here you him brother branham gives example of that he said his son became a certain age he took the son out and adopted him our positionally placed him said that word adopt gets you confused just think positionally placed so you had a son born in the canada in his household but when he come on age he's positionally placed he's a age to handle the father's business and operate in the father's name and of course he was there but he was tutored from through time until he comes of age and then he reversed he says this Pentecostal church has had 51 years of growth and then he says why aren't we of age and then I'm gonna say as we're standing here on 54 years since the seventh angel finished sounding his message why aren't we of age because the Holy Spirit is to bring the message that we broke our selves up in denomination and drawed fences across it cutting in with the world and living like the world prayer meetin is gone and old-fashioned services is gone that's why we're not where we should be and that's exactly why the people won't stay placed and I'm just going to say this is this is exactly his message and the greatest battle ever fought what he built his whole sermon on was the backdrop of the universe as he looked into the heavens and he says that stars are those stars have stayed in orbit since God hung them in the sky and they're God's army and they're you know again the moon moves and the tide comes in and out the Sun comes and gives us energy upon the earth he said all that the sons of God that they are represented will stay steady like the heavens when we see trouble coming we see problems upon the earth we see sickness we see trials are you with me it's that time you've got to stand steady be still and know that I'm God but don't don't go run around cast a bow don't let your faith drop and hain't worry and all this just stay steady now but without castigated reminder a triple minded or blaming anyone I don't believe we have yet realize the full potential of what this message is to bring the book was open what was it to bring it was to open up the full inheritance I've seen a you know some camping down on parts and the neglecting of other parts we've learned mechanics of theology and we know it in theory but we're often lacking the dynamics of the fire of it we have a Church's set in order we got nice buildings we have educated people to understand doctrine we've had great teaching but we need an igniting of this truth in our lives now that ought to be the cry of every believer this morning Lord you packed me full of the word but I'd need an igniting of its truths in my life a man now of course when this when this would be a ceremony that that they would have in the Roman days of son after that ceremony he would have the same authority to write a check as his dad did if he fired a man he was fired to be hired a man he was hired Jesus said whosoever sins Yoram it is permitted and whatever you bind on earth i bind in heaven what you loose on earth i loosed in heaven remember in the church is the power of binding and loosing the right that's the power of God's church how do we remit sin don't come by magic one of a preacher comes by you repenting and then being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and your sins are a minute so you can receive the Holy Ghost but he said we we say this the same face we're sort of that because the church has drawn division and lines and so forth and except for other things instead of staying with God's love and the Holy Spirit and the Bible he said look he has predestinated us on to disinheritance I want you to know you have been our dangers like more decay I told Esther he says he said that you know you have come into the kingdom for this time and I want you to know you have been predestinated for this age God show you before the world and he chose you for this time you could have been born in Luther's time you've gotta been born in Wesley's time but God saw to that you would come in this day of this hour that this is your time are you with me cuz he has predestinated you to inheritance others have remained like a child but your people in predestined to an inheritance a man he said if I'm right a heritance is something God knocking at my heart saying William Branham I called you a long time before the foundational world had preached the gospel I have an inheritance and inheritance of eternal life now Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to inherit it it was blank it was valid there's nothing I could do but in the fullness of time God sin in his own good time Jesus a lamb slain before the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what what inheritance to sonship to be a son of God now we're not we're not ordained to be a prophet or the seventh angel but we are your danger in inheritance and that is inheritance of sonship and he said now this may choke you to death but do you know that men are sons of God or amateur gods how many never knew that how many of you know Jesus said so the Bible said Jesus said they're not your law see itself that you are gods and if you call them gods which God said in Genesis 2 that they were gods and because they had full dominion over the Dominion of the world he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his God ship he lost his sonship he lost his domain Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top were this when the sons of God will be when the full sons of God will be manifested and the power of God will walk out hallelujah and take every power that Satan's got away from him hallelujah now when we hear brother let him talk about the pyramid as he said we don't believe in some pyramid doctrine some mystic spiritualism that's associated with the priam pyramid he was just illustrating the workings of the gospel from the first stage to now starting at the base working upward with each age getting narrower so we're in the seventh age and now we're beyond the Xu's of street with nothing left but the capstone to come which is Jesus Christ now that capstone can come to you individually as the Holy Ghost see you to the day of redemption oh man the capstone revelation comes were the prandtl revelations our attitude to church finishing the mysteries of God and we have received that remember we as of all the body of believers are coming to another headstone are you with me and that headstone is the coming of Jesus Christ Himself to unite with his church and take that church in a rapture amen so even so there has to be a bride or people on earth to match the coming capstone or body of believers to take ever power that Satan has away from them this Christ did and he waits Jesus waits expectantly for every enemy to be made his footstool hallelujah he did that in Christ but now it must be done in his body come on hey man listen this is what Jesus is expect the Bible said he sits in the heavens and he waits for every enemy to be brought under his feet I wonder what trophy when you bring this morning oh man every one of you who ought to be bringing Maria a trophy here's another demon then I'm bringing laying at your feet because you said every enemy what happened be brought under your feet come on here's a here's alopecia we bring that under your feet here's cancer we bring it under your feet a man hears this situation we bring it under your feet here's a lost childhood we bring it under your feet everything has to be brought under his feet and he is very expecting you to do it the Bride of Christ a man who will come bringing their enemy put him there before you for his feet here's another one here's another trophy of the blood a man here's another trophy of the but what's now Romans 8:15 we'll bring it to a close here in a moment but in Romans 8:15 for you have not received a spirit of adoption again to fear but you have received the spirit or the spirit about a bondage again to fear but you received a spirit of adoption and that is the spirit of adult son you have received the spirit that is to bring you into a adult sonship whereby we cry Abba Father which that's a term of endearment my daddy halleluiah received the spirit of adoption the spirit of adult sonship whereby we called him father a man what verse 16 and the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God verse 17 what's now and if we're children then heirs and we're heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together and somebody with me there so we're a child we're now and if we ran and we're heir of God and we're enjoying our with Christ and then this is what he's doing he's sharing he is sharing the book man he has given you the inheritance as a child of God because we have received the spirit of sonship bringing us into maturity now I want to I want to look at this verse a little closer because we need to look at this verse a little little closer yeah we're to suffer - oh yeah we live in this life and we know we suffer because of it and I would you to think you get blow after blow after blow but I don't mean that in every bow he doesn't come back and bring a way of escape don't provide healing come on a man and we suffer and then suffering we know we develop character that we we need in order to reign right amen but I want you to look at this a little closer because not only do we suffer in that manner but we have our suffering vicariously in Christ so the reason we can reign with him is because he suffered for our sins the reason we can walk in freedom and and healing this morning is because he suffered by our healing so if we acknowledge we suffer with him a man that he paid our price we can have salvation or we can have healing salvation for the body or sub-basin for the soul because if we suffer with him we reign with him hallelujah how many can look in Christ and say I was in him a man I was in him and he separate from me and I suffer with him therefore I reign with him and because he resurrected and resurrected hallelujah a man because he rose I raised with him so I can raise fry up and over sin over sickness over any problem because if I suffer with that I reign with him now and since we are his through children we qualify to share in all his treasures and when we were heirs of God himself don't let this go over your head because we are his true children how many is a true child of God a man then we are qualified to share in his treasures and if we're we are heirs of God himself and since we're joined to Christ we are also inherent all that he is and all that he has and so we experience being Co glorified with him provided we accept his sufferance as our own so when you when you there again when you accept his sufferance as your own and you say he suffered for my sins then you receive his glory of the Holy Ghost that glory five European hallelujah and quickens you to the Word of God and the same thing happens for your healing when you realize I suffered with him I don't have to suffer anymore he paid the price my suffering is over I can stand it be filled hallelujah why because by I am glorified with him that is he raised I raised just as he raised then triumph over sin I can triumph over soon as he triumph over sickness I can triumph over sickness so my soul is saved when I realize that except that he paid for my sin that I don't need to suffer for my sin I accept his death for my own I accept his suffering for my own for my sins and for my sickness now look at verse 18 for I reckon the sufferings of this present time are not compared to be worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who subjected the same as in Hope because the creature itself also should be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God but we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together under now and not only they but ourselves also which how they firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit that is the redemption of our body so now let me just let me just share this in another translation beginning in verse 19 the entire universe is standing on tiptoe yearning to see the unveiling God's glorious sons and daughters if you just realize this right here this this word this word here of the unveiling it is it is there in that manifestation it comes from the word Apocalypto which means the unveiling it is the name of the book of Revelation that describes the end time well that there will be an unveiling of the sons of God I'm trying to get something to you you're living in the dispensation we're sons of God are being revealed I'm out word that it's the unveiling you said brother Tim I thought it was held veiling of a book it is but that book is you the believer a man the unveiling of God is the unveiling of a bride in band and Brad for God in bride form are you with me this is his plan this is a scope this is everything he was gonna do the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the apocalypse to the unveiling of sons God's been waiting to put you on display can I just say it you are the quick short work and if you want to if you want it and then you've been desired it you've been looking for quit looking for it you're in a man this is where he displays his power this is where his glory is shown I want you to get this the entire universe everything is standing on tiptoe and it's yearning to see the unveiling of God's glorious sons and daughters for against incense will the universe itself had they endured the empty futility resulting from the consequences of human sin but now with eager it's better all creation longs for freedom from its slavery to decay and experience with us the wonderful freedom coming to God's children can we get it down for a moment it's a Jubilee where the slaves go free where the earth gets liberated come on hey man it keeps right on all all creation verse 21 all creation longs for freedom from its slavery to decay and to experience with us the wonderful freedom coming to God's children to this day we're aware of the universal agony and the groaning of creation as it were in the contractions of Labor for childbirth and it's not just creation but we have already received the firstfruits of the Spirit the down payment the earnest also go in wordly groan as we passionately longed to experience our full status as sons and daughters including our physical bodies being transformed but this is the hope of our salvation hallelujah amen there's something in us Brown yes Lord we have seen you work but you won't see your work North we've seen your display we want to see in this play more and we've seen you manifest yourself but lord I will be manifested in that word and man let it be unveiled the unveiling not just a place in a book in heaven but an unveiling take place in my life that puts on display the words of this book hallelujah because those that know their God shall do exploits hallelujah that word the entire universe standing on tiptoe yearning to see the Velen the manifestations of the sons of God it is it shows that this is imminent it's soon to happen it's destined to take place the Christ's glory will come to us inner us full villus envelop us so we will be revealed as entertainers of this glory and all know that God will not share his glory with another we're not another we are one with him so the same glory that was manifested in Christ is to be manifested in his bride hallelujah amen that's what brother Branham would say go back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world and nature is groaning crying everything's are moving what for that matter the Stations of the sons of God when true sons born sons filled sons speak and that word is back I believe we're on the border that right now yes sir say to this mountain let it be so brother I desire so-and-so a certain thing to be done and I'm a believer in Christ I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's a manifestation oh my brother my crops is burning up yonder I haven't had a rain I send you rain in the name of the Lord God amen bless her crop Oh waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning he gave man the domain he gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it to his to in his name with assurance asked the father anything in my name and I'll do it waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the position the church as I said the book of Ephesians the book of Joshua just for placing the people word that belong now they wouldn't stand still but he buddy from here and he run over to Manassas land this is woody would come back a bussing and stewing how will they ever get along when once said I'm a Baptist I'm a method I'm a Pentecostal I'm oneness I'm Tunis I'm so so how you gonna do it stand still God's wanting to place his church his sons and daughters of God God let me live to see it as my prayer so close I can just feel it in my hand almost look like it's right there what I'm long to see waiting for the time when we walk down the street there's a layin from his mother's womb silver and gold have I none o waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God hallelujah when God will make himself known when they'll stop sickness they'll stop cancer they'll stop disease us you think cancer something the Bible Center is coming to town where men will rock right in there flush and buzzards will eat off the carcasses before they even die cancers are to take to what's coming look remember that horrible thing was forbidden and that data touch those who had the seal of God that's what we're striving for to get him and be positionally placed in the kingdom of God before those horrible plagues strike oh how good the dispensation of the fullness of time we've obtained them inheritance being predestinated now listen here we are we're living in a day we're seeing already pre-tribulation blanks I believe the bride goes home before the tribulation come on Amen but let me tell you we're seeing pre-tribulation plagues already striking the earth look what has happened and look at the scare that's in our nation you say well it's real it's not real its fake news it's real news we don't know - because right honest we don't have we we don't have a good handle on our news stop markets going crazy losing thousands of dollars crashing you know almost twenty thirty thousand dollars on couple hundred thousand a dollar portfolio just crashing down lose money here again losing value at least here again fierce all kinds of things that are coming here above the earth weary in the end time is that right amen but let me tell you something there is a seal of God that God promised to put upon his people and also a power that is within them to cast Satan out that when he attacks and it must be a people in this last day that know their God who does exploits are you with me here listen brother Branham in accepting God's plan provided way at the end time and he said some of them said well now to bleed false we'll just go in the hospital if the black happens of all you know what we'll do we'll go get dr. Jones he'll know how to take care of it it didn't work there was smart well if the plague falls we just go down beneath the ground and a cave shut the door that won't do one bit of good we'll stay at home put a mask over our face and put some disinfectant it didn't do a bit of good god made a provided way yes and it was what the blood God provided it as simple as it seemed to take the blood of the Lamb and sprinkled the door yet God said he his way that was his way and he honored it and all that was out from under the blood dad the first boy are you with me now Church it is time now that we realize we've got to be under the blood and that's the Holy Ghost and the blood death cancels all the sin death and gives you an abstract that your debt is paid and that you got a free pass and that you can take your token and display it and wave it in the face of the devil and say you can't cross over that's token you can't cross over that's black because he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you it's time like never before we put stress on the dynamics and not just the mechanics because mechanics is not gonna work it's going to take the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost working in the church or people who is a mature church who knows how to take that word and use that soul and bring it against the enemy that's what brother Branham said we put too much stress on mechanics we hadn't put enough stress on the dynamics people are worried it gets the same brother Tim aren't you putting too much stress on the dynamics I'm gonna tell you friends it's time to put stress on it we need the life of the resurrection not just to talk of the resurrection car can be full of the best gasoline in the world and without a spark it'll never leave the drive we can be chock-full of all the word know the Bible inside not be a walking quote book but without the dynamics to make it work it might as well be water we can have all the professions of faith might even be in a gasoline can might be in a collection of tapes or books it might all be right on the label but unless there's some dynamics to make it work in your life it might as well be water we have an abstract of title that's been given us it's an open book what was closed what was hidden what was veiled another ages is now open to you the land is yours the Covenant is the deed to the land but the enemy that possesses it and claims it must be struck off today you're getting your getting a reminder we're in a Jubilee you get a reminder this is a day of freedom you're getting a reminder you don't have to be a slave any longer you got a reminder this is a day that we can receive the Holy Ghost just like they did 2,000 years ago not a portion not a part not just a justification or sanctification or a tongue of it but the person himself to come and feel your life and write his nature in your life power has some musicians come I want you to think on this it's more than a deed it's more than just having a promise it's knowing that everything against you has been struck off I believe that God sent a prophet in this day an hour with a message to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers strikes and cancels the debts of the past ages there's no claim on us his rapture hour is wrapped her time he just say waiting for each one of you to personally receive that abstract in your life not just a promise I got the message but an abstract that ever sin has been struck off then unbelief is gone I want you to just look at your life this morning we've got an abstract of title where the deed has been searched claims against it is settled what about your personal property what about your personal inheritance what about in revealing your name in the book is every claim against you been wiped off has ever sin been put in the blood are you standing before him justified that when he sees your name there's not even a smudge against it [Music] why don't you just ask the Lord today the Lord come searching my record I don't want to stand up there come down to the end time and there's a claim on my life and I got to go through the tribulation for more purging but I won't ever claim that the devil has on my life taken off I want a full surrender I want to be able to reach and take every promise I don't want to be disqualified by being an immature brat I want to be a full-fledged born-again child of God who I can walk up and say it's my book I can walk up and take the book from the hand of the angel and then that word will become spoken out of my life [Music] once you ask god there's got to be a clear another deed we're gonna take communion here in a little bit you can't take it with sin in your life and unbelief [Music] if you were just for a moment consider your own self view just for a moment stand in his presence save Lord wipe every sin out of my life every bit of unbelief everything that disqualifies me if the Bible said if our hearts condemn us not we can receive what we ask of him that's not a condition that you want to be just on the occasion that's the condition you want to walk in no condemnation you can say there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus I'm freed from my past freed from my sin and I've got proof Who I am as a child of God we took him with labour this put it out an abstract God's clearing deeds he wipes out the false doctrines of the past ages to give you a message that is pure so there can be a rapture even there would be a claim in sobriety he wants to take your life and he wants to purge you take care of sand and darkness every shadow of it he wants to take his word and just write it in your heart in your nature or that you and the word is to say this same pitchers in Revelation 10 take the word take it in prophesy let it be a life lived out Acts chapter 2 all his spirit coming down writing into the very nature of man changing him in his presence would you just say Lord at this moment at this moment I look at your sufferance and I realize if I suffer with you if I count your suffering as my own I'll be glorified with you resurrected out of death into life would you look back and you look at him and say was his blood sufficient did he pay your price can you say the year identified in his suffering then be identified in his resurrection or you cease from dead works to serve the Living God I meant where the Holy Spirit does this manifestation in your life what about you what about you this morning would you just say Lord I just need to grow up a little bit more I want to be able to take what's inheritance I need some maturity in my life Lord I can know what you want done with your word I can act in your name operate in your name you're gonna have a people this day you're gonna display yourself through purge my life cleanse me wash me in the blood Lord today in your presence so I can come in some real fellowship with you in Jesus name thank you lord thank you lord thank you Jesus so
