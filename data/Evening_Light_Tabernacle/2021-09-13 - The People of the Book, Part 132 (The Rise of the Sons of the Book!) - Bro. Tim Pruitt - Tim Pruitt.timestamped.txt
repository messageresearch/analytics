[1:01:55] to me by brother
[1:01:56] buzz bosey from uganda he's also been
[1:01:59] down in ethiopia established a lot of
[1:02:02] works down there he's in the midst of
[1:02:03] right now
[1:02:05] translating the three little booklets
[1:02:07] that i written i wrote they're not about
[1:02:09] me or my ministry they're about
[1:02:11] they're about the message god sent
[1:02:14] and one of them is jesus the name above
[1:02:17] all names it covers the godhead and
[1:02:19] baptism you can ask for it at the
[1:02:20] library or there um
[1:02:24] if you're online you can actually write
[1:02:26] us and we'll point you to where you can
[1:02:29] get that and also we have the five
[1:02:31] comings of elijah that explains of how
[1:02:34] god sends the spirit of elijah five
[1:02:37] different times and how that we have
[1:02:40] experienced in our day
[1:02:42] and elijah ministry and there's one yet
[1:02:44] to come to the jewish people
[1:02:47] and then um the other was on the
[1:02:49] original sin where we spoke where we we
[1:02:52] taught about um the serpents eden
[1:02:55] and it's a bible principle that if you
[1:02:57] get that it unlocks all the scriptures
[1:03:00] in the bible
[1:03:01] so
[1:03:02] um you know if you haven't received that
[1:03:05] or you would like a copy of it we do
[1:03:07] have it in english and i think there's
[1:03:09] several different languages now that

[1:03:13] chinese japanese um different uh
[1:03:17] spanish different other languages that
[1:03:19] we that we haven't and so it's a it's a
[1:03:22] good outreach that's what i wrote it for
[1:03:25] it was for outreach but anyway they are
[1:03:27] printing right now ten thousand copies
[1:03:29] of each into a
[1:03:31] uh another language into uganda we
[1:03:33] already printed ten thousand of each
[1:03:35] copy in in um
[1:03:39] another language and there's several of
[1:03:41] them there and we're putting some into
[1:03:43] english and brother buzz bosey is
[1:03:45] helping me with that but in this
[1:03:47] prophecy he said through your ministry
[1:03:50] i'm raising up a generation of young
[1:03:53] people that will stand with my word
[1:03:56] without fear or favor of man
[1:03:59] this is true and thou already know this
[1:04:01] thing because i've even told you of it
[1:04:04] this is the hour for to call a bride
[1:04:06] without spot
[1:04:08] a generation that will see all the
[1:04:10] promises of my holy writ
[1:04:13] you have carried out the mission i have
[1:04:15] laid in your hands and sacrificed all
[1:04:18] for this i the lord will therefore not
[1:04:21] forsake thee i will make myself manifest
[1:04:24] and continue to do so speak and fear not
[1:04:28] for i am your defense and strength i
[1:04:31] will make it good
[1:04:32] saith the lord
[1:04:34] amen amen and i believe that don't you
[1:04:38] amen many of you even though you're now
[1:04:41] in your 40s and 50s you're part of those
[1:04:43] young people
[1:04:44] that god gave me to this ministry and
[1:04:47] and
[1:04:48] as we we have
[1:04:50] ministered to those and helped with the
[1:04:52] youth camp and now many of those are are
[1:04:54] um now deacons and pastors and ministers
[1:04:58] wives and lay members and holy
[1:05:00] ghost-filled men and women uh all over
[1:05:03] all over this nation
[1:05:05] because of those efforts and god is
[1:05:07] raising up a group of young people even
[1:05:09] now
[1:05:10] and i'm glad to see this crop of young
[1:05:12] people
[1:05:13] amen continuing on and moving on with
[1:05:16] god
[1:05:17] amen john chapter 14 verse 1 is where
[1:05:20] we're going to read from this morning
[1:05:22] you pray with me that as we minister
[1:05:24] that we'll just catch the holy spirit
[1:05:28] some of these things i had spoke about
[1:05:31] last time i ministered on i'm going to
[1:05:33] regroup some of those and bring them
[1:05:35] back thoughts and bring them back in
[1:05:38] and in a little bit more of an
[1:05:40] evangelistic way if god will help me
[1:05:43] john chapter 14 verse 1 let not your
[1:05:45] heart be troubled you believe in god
[1:05:48] believe also in me in my father's house
[1:05:51] are many mansions
[1:05:52] if it were not so i would have told you
[1:05:55] i go to prepare a place for you and if i
[1:05:58] go and prepare a place for you i will
[1:05:59] come again and receive you unto myself
[1:06:02] that where i am there you may be also
[1:06:05] and whether i go you know in the way you
[1:06:07] know thomas said unto him lord we know
[1:06:10] not wither thou go us and how can we
[1:06:13] know the way and jesus said unto him
[1:06:17] i am the way
[1:06:18] the truth and the life and no one cometh
[1:06:22] to the father but by me
[1:06:24] if you had known me you should have
[1:06:26] known my father also
[1:06:28] and from henceforth you know him and
[1:06:30] have seen him philip said in him lord
[1:06:33] show us the father
[1:06:35] and it satisfies or suffices us
[1:06:38] and
[1:06:40] jesus said unto him have i
[1:06:42] been so long time with you and yet hast
[1:06:46] thou not known me philip
[1:06:48] he that hath seen me
[1:06:50] has seen the father and how sayest thou
[1:06:53] them show us the father
[1:06:56] believeth thou not that i'm in the
[1:06:58] father and the father and me the words
[1:07:00] that i speak unto you i speak not of
[1:07:02] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[1:07:06] me he
[1:07:07] doeth the works
[1:07:09] believe me that i am in the father and
[1:07:13] the father in me or else believe me for
[1:07:15] the very work's sake verily verily i've
[1:07:18] seen you he that believeth on me the
[1:07:21] works that i do shall he do also in
[1:07:24] greater works than thee shall he do
[1:07:26] because i go unto my father and
[1:07:29] whatsoever you shall ask in my name i
[1:07:31] will do
[1:07:32] that i will do that the father may be
[1:07:34] glorified in the son if you ask anything
[1:07:37] in my name
[1:07:38] i will do it
[1:07:41] what unfailing words of promise god
[1:07:44] bless you can be seated
[1:07:48] now we're going to be speaking on the
[1:07:51] rise of the sons of the book
[1:07:54] because i do believe that this is a day
[1:07:56] and hour where
[1:07:58] that there is a rise of sons sons that
[1:08:02] know their god
[1:08:04] and who do exploits
[1:08:06] they know their position they know their
[1:08:08] place
[1:08:09] they know their calling if you notice
[1:08:11] philip was saying show us the father
[1:08:14] i had asked you while we were um
[1:08:18] you know
[1:08:20] taking a little time off because some
[1:08:22] were sick with the with the covet and
[1:08:24] trying to find out how many were were
[1:08:27] infected and to stop the spread we we
[1:08:30] canceled a couple of services and i ask
[1:08:32] you to listen to the tape of show us the
[1:08:34] father
[1:08:36] and there's a number of them any of them
[1:08:38] would have been good but brother branham
[1:08:40] preached on this many many times and he
[1:08:42] would also call it god in his word or
[1:08:44] god and his people or
[1:08:46] um you know god in his universe um and
[1:08:50] he would take four things to show which
[1:08:52] was god in his universe then god in his
[1:08:55] word and god and his son and then god
[1:08:57] and his people
[1:08:59] and of course he would start here with
[1:09:01] with with philip's question of show us
[1:09:05] the father
[1:09:06] uh you know he was wanting them to show
[1:09:09] us god
[1:09:11] you know where where is he
[1:09:13] and yet they were looking at the father
[1:09:16] and he was but he was hidden
[1:09:19] manifested in the sun
[1:09:21] the father was standing right there in
[1:09:23] the form
[1:09:24] but they didn't recognize him because he
[1:09:27] was dwelling in the sun
[1:09:30] and people are asking today where is
[1:09:32] jesus you know there's trouble all
[1:09:34] around
[1:09:35] we got more trouble than there's ever
[1:09:37] been and we are here at the end time
[1:09:40] where all the evil of all generations it
[1:09:43] all keeps up all the sin all the evil
[1:09:46] points right down here to this last day
[1:09:49] and people are asking well where is
[1:09:51] jesus you know we we can see diseases
[1:09:54] and that they hardly know what to do
[1:09:55] with and trouble in the land and
[1:09:57] political strife and national strife and
[1:10:00] and but where is jesus
[1:10:03] and and we we want to
[1:10:06] we want to establish once again that we
[1:10:09] are in the coming of the lord
[1:10:12] this is the day of his coming if i could
[1:10:15] if i could kind of say it to you in this
[1:10:17] way it's the hour of the seventh seal
[1:10:20] where the silence is broken concerning
[1:10:22] is coming
[1:10:24] where god lets us know
[1:10:26] the day the hour that we're living in
[1:10:28] that we have reached the end of the ages
[1:10:33] and and i'm so so um we we want to just
[1:10:37] say of course that god is not here in
[1:10:40] the form of jesus the nail scarred body
[1:10:43] walking around in this congregation this
[1:10:45] morning but rather god is here but he's
[1:10:49] in his people
[1:10:51] amen in his people it this is the second
[1:10:54] phase of the rapture
[1:10:57] where and and this people are the
[1:11:00] resurrection and the life resurrection
[1:11:03] power lays in them
[1:11:05] you see because they are the first from
[1:11:08] among the dead
[1:11:10] the first after 2 000 years has come for
[1:11:14] the bride out of the tombs of religion
[1:11:17] that have been sealed away there you may
[1:11:20] have had a baptist tomb or methodist
[1:11:22] tomb or a pentecostal tomb
[1:11:24] but it was a tomb right amen and they
[1:11:27] had sealed you sealed it away but we
[1:11:30] have our people that have risen up out
[1:11:33] of the traditions of man and we have
[1:11:36] come back to the word of god again and
[1:11:39] it's a resurrection life
[1:11:41] that is on the inside of us
[1:11:44] and it raises us up from dead works and
[1:11:47] from sin and unbelief and from the
[1:11:49] dogmas of the past and into a
[1:11:52] resurrected life and we're we're people
[1:11:55] are unique people because we are not
[1:11:58] predestined to fall and to go down into
[1:12:01] the ground again as many denominations
[1:12:04] has that they would rise up only to fall
[1:12:07] back and become again cold and formal
[1:12:11] and and powerless but we have been
[1:12:14] predestinated not to fall
[1:12:17] you see this bride has been placed upon
[1:12:20] a rock
[1:12:21] and it's a solid foundation that the
[1:12:23] gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:12:26] her destiny she has been predestined to
[1:12:31] adoption to be recognized as sons
[1:12:35] we want to understand that today because
[1:12:37] we are actually the fulfillment of joel
[1:12:40] chapter 2 where that god empties what he
[1:12:43] started pouring out on the day of
[1:12:45] pentecost
[1:12:46] and over and over we have been assured
[1:12:49] time upon time that joel 28 2 28 is the
[1:12:54] light of this last day
[1:12:56] amen i will restore saith the lord in
[1:12:59] the last days i'll pour out my spirit
[1:13:02] along with malachi 4 and luke 17 30 and
[1:13:06] john 14 12 that we read and revelation
[1:13:09] 10
[1:13:10] all of these are the light of this end
[1:13:14] time
[1:13:15] where god is doing something very unique
[1:13:19] and very special calling a people out
[1:13:22] for his namesake this is the day that
[1:13:24] scriptures that have been held in
[1:13:26] silence for thousands of years how are
[1:13:30] now the the power of them have been
[1:13:33] released
[1:13:34] and and are now being manifested as
[1:13:37] brother branham said in the mighty god
[1:13:40] unveiled before us he said in joel 2 28
[1:13:43] he promised in this last days there
[1:13:46] would be a ladder rain poured out upon
[1:13:48] the people in this last days i think the
[1:13:51] greek word the error is kinah which
[1:13:54] means that he emptied himself out not in
[1:13:57] the way we would say like was something
[1:13:59] was on the inside of somebody that he
[1:14:01] empty out but he poured himself out
[1:14:05] now he's referring to what paul said
[1:14:08] when he was speaking of jesus let's look
[1:14:09] here at philippians chapter 2 and verse
[1:14:12] 6 who being in the form of god thought
[1:14:15] it not robbery to be equal with god but
[1:14:18] made himself of no repetition that word
[1:14:21] is kinah
[1:14:22] and they took upon him the form of a
[1:14:25] servant and was made in the likeness of
[1:14:28] man
[1:14:29] so he changed his morphe he changed from
[1:14:33] what he was to what he is notice what
[1:14:36] he's doing he
[1:14:37] he emptied himself of his godship to
[1:14:41] take on the form of a servant to come in
[1:14:45] likeness of man
[1:14:46] so god would actually pour himself out
[1:14:50] into a human vessel
[1:14:53] hallelujah so he he never changes his
[1:14:56] nature though
[1:14:57] amen but on the day of pentecost he
[1:15:00] comes and he changed himself from being
[1:15:02] son of man to son of god
[1:15:05] now he came not with the people he came
[1:15:08] in the people the same god to carry his
[1:15:12] ministry on through in this great age he
[1:15:15] prophesied in the bible there would come
[1:15:17] a day that would neither be in day nor
[1:15:20] night but in the evening time it should
[1:15:23] be light now the sun geographically
[1:15:26] rises in the east and sets in the west
[1:15:28] it's the same sun all the time now when
[1:15:30] the sun s-o-n reveals himself in the
[1:15:33] manifestation of the promised word to
[1:15:35] israel the eastern people we've had a
[1:15:38] day of gloom we've had enough light in
[1:15:40] the reformers and so forth to make
[1:15:42] churches and denominations and just
[1:15:45] join them and come in and kiss the
[1:15:47] babies and marry the old uh
[1:15:49] marry the old himself and buried the
[1:15:51] dead i'm sure he means the young but
[1:15:53] they'll get married too and so forth and
[1:15:56] live in the church and then but in the
[1:15:58] evening time it shall be like he said in
[1:16:02] the evening time and no scripture can be
[1:16:04] broken and the same s-o-n that poured
[1:16:08] himself out keno on the day of pentecost
[1:16:12] promised to do the same thing in the
[1:16:14] evening time
[1:16:16] it's according to the promise he said
[1:16:19] get the time together and remember let's
[1:16:21] look what's happening and look what he
[1:16:23] promised and then you'll see where we're
[1:16:25] at get the thing together you can see
[1:16:28] the unveiling of this great and mighty
[1:16:31] one traditions are blind to the people
[1:16:33] again to the great things that has been
[1:16:36] prophesied remember his whole thought is
[1:16:39] the mighty god unveiled
[1:16:42] this is what jesus was trying to do to
[1:16:44] philip here unveil that god when you've
[1:16:47] seen me
[1:16:48] you've seen the father it's not me that
[1:16:51] doing the works it's not this human
[1:16:53] being but it is the father dwelling in
[1:16:56] me
[1:16:57] and he is doing the work now notice he
[1:17:00] changed
[1:17:01] and that's how they missed him
[1:17:04] he the great father
[1:17:06] amen by whom the worlds were created
[1:17:09] amen he fathered himself a body
[1:17:13] and became the son
[1:17:15] and even the disciples didn't recognize
[1:17:17] him
[1:17:18] you know it wasn't another god it was
[1:17:20] the same god
[1:17:22] condescending it was the jehovah of the
[1:17:26] old testament becoming the jesus of the
[1:17:29] new
[1:17:30] which by the way jesus is jehovah's
[1:17:32] savior that's what that name is
[1:17:35] amen it was god changing his mask
[1:17:38] coming in a different form
[1:17:40] he come from the form of god to become
[1:17:43] one of us a man for the purpose of
[1:17:46] redemption then on the day of pentecost
[1:17:49] he changed forms again now remember he
[1:17:53] went away and he said i'm going to come
[1:17:55] again
[1:17:56] and i'm going to come again in like
[1:17:58] manner
[1:17:59] surely we're going to have a great time
[1:18:01] one day where we're going to meet him in
[1:18:02] the air
[1:18:03] that's what believers believe as brother
[1:18:06] branham said no matter how old the story
[1:18:08] has been told or the story is he said
[1:18:11] it's still the truth and that's what
[1:18:14] believers believe
[1:18:15] amen that there will be a literal lord
[1:18:18] jesus that will meet in the air
[1:18:21] amen but the world won't see him when he
[1:18:23] comes that way
[1:18:25] amen but here it'll be the left will be
[1:18:28] caught up in that dimension in the air
[1:18:31] to meet him are you with me but on the
[1:18:33] day of pentecost he changed his form
[1:18:36] again he didn't come as a man again but
[1:18:40] he came and poured out by his spirit the
[1:18:43] same jesus coming not as a man but this
[1:18:47] time as the holy spirit the spirit of
[1:18:49] jesus and this time he would come not in
[1:18:53] a body he created but multiple bodies
[1:18:57] that he redeemed
[1:18:59] hallelujah amen what was that it was the
[1:19:02] coming of the lord
[1:19:05] on the day of pentecost but he came out
[1:19:09] not as a man a son of man a prophet
[1:19:13] but he comes as a god revealing himself
[1:19:17] in his people
[1:19:19] amen now in spiritual food induced
[1:19:22] season brother branham said if he
[1:19:24] appeared to us in the physical body and
[1:19:26] looked just exactly like hoffman's head
[1:19:29] of christ at 33 and blood running out of
[1:19:33] his hand and so forth nail scars all
[1:19:35] over him i wouldn't accept it
[1:19:40] no no no no when he comes himself every
[1:19:44] eye shall see him every tongue shall
[1:19:46] confess him as lightning comes from the
[1:19:48] east to the west and so shall it be see
[1:19:50] we don't believe in these cults and
[1:19:52] clans we believe god is the word
[1:19:55] so the rapture is is coming but i wanted
[1:19:58] to say to you it's more of a going away
[1:20:02] than a coming
[1:20:04] amen it is the secret rapture of the
[1:20:08] church
[1:20:09] and every eye will not see him
[1:20:13] instead we will be cut away to meet him
[1:20:17] and then after the marriage supper come
[1:20:19] back with him and take the world over
[1:20:23] for the millennium and at that time ever
[1:20:25] i will see him
[1:20:27] and every every tongue will have to
[1:20:29] confess he's lord
[1:20:31] amen
[1:20:33] but now but that does not keep him from
[1:20:37] being here
[1:20:39] amen he embodies himself taking your
[1:20:42] body and mind
[1:20:44] my body and gives you gifts gives me
[1:20:47] gifts and through these gifts he makes
[1:20:49] himself known
[1:20:51] that's the secret food no matter how
[1:20:54] much he would make himself known by me
[1:20:56] you've got to believe it you've got to
[1:20:57] have a gift of faith too to believe it
[1:21:00] amen now let me just get something very
[1:21:03] very clear
[1:21:04] because i don't want to be misunderstood
[1:21:07] this is not
[1:21:09] that a repeat of the day of pentecost
[1:21:12] the azusa movement repeated that by
[1:21:15] going back into death again
[1:21:18] amen neither is it just a return to
[1:21:21] pentecost
[1:21:23] this is a continuation
[1:21:25] of the book of acts amen where an
[1:21:28] invincible army rises where sun rises
[1:21:33] coming and coming forth to take every
[1:21:35] power that satan has away from him
[1:21:39] this is the fulfillment of every type
[1:21:42] and every shadow of pentecost it is when
[1:21:45] the day of pentecost fully comes
[1:21:48] amen now in his comings he is coming
[1:21:51] three sons names let me get past some of
[1:21:54] this just for a minute and we'll get
[1:21:56] we'll get right on into it there's
[1:21:57] things i want to say this morning but he
[1:21:59] comes in three sons named son of man
[1:22:02] son of god and son of david
[1:22:05] now of course son of david will be the
[1:22:07] millennial reign where he'll be the king
[1:22:10] over the earth his bride will reign with
[1:22:11] him son of man was aware that he came as
[1:22:15] a prophet and walked among men you
[1:22:18] remember what is men that are mindful of
[1:22:20] him are the son of man that thou that
[1:22:23] reveals thyself to him because god
[1:22:25] reveals himself to the prophet the son
[1:22:28] of man so he came as a prophet the god
[1:22:32] prophet
[1:22:33] right
[1:22:34] amen and and then of course he comes as
[1:22:37] son of man son of god and that is and we
[1:22:41] know through his earthly ministry jesus
[1:22:44] came as the son of man as the god
[1:22:47] prophet
[1:22:48] but on the day of pentecost he came as
[1:22:51] the son of god spirit
[1:22:54] amen because god is a spirit and this
[1:22:56] brought in the son of god dispensation
[1:23:00] that is reigned through the ages
[1:23:03] but here at the end of the ages were not
[1:23:06] another baptist age of presbyterian age
[1:23:09] or lutheran age or pentecostal age but
[1:23:11] now a bride age
[1:23:14] let me just say infancy is past
[1:23:17] amen he's not taking a little girl to
[1:23:19] get married to
[1:23:21] a little eight nine year old girl no
[1:23:23] he's taking a mature elect lady
[1:23:26] immaturity is past infancy is past it is
[1:23:30] adoption age it is a mature grain age it
[1:23:34] is the eagle age it is the rapture rates
[1:23:37] amen all of that is culminated into the
[1:23:41] end of this laodicean age it is the age
[1:23:44] of the son of man that is why we don't
[1:23:47] look for another upper room where 120
[1:23:51] are gathered and the churches born this
[1:23:53] is not the birth of the church this is
[1:23:56] the coronation of the church it's when
[1:23:59] the son of man again is revealed as it
[1:24:02] was in the days of sodom
[1:24:05] and that visitation brings about a
[1:24:07] change and a long-awaited promised son
[1:24:11] amen it says in revelation 10 and i saw
[1:24:15] another mighty angel
[1:24:17] and the mighty angel of revelation 10
[1:24:20] is the son of man dispensation and its
[1:24:24] anointing
[1:24:25] now notice that the people of this
[1:24:28] dispensation are under this anointing
[1:24:31] they are more than shouters
[1:24:34] am i more than
[1:24:36] dancers
[1:24:37] more than just a bunch of noise makers
[1:24:40] more than a bunch of emotional workup
[1:24:43] they are a prophetical class who will be
[1:24:46] the final prophecy
[1:24:49] understand what i'm talking about the
[1:24:51] last they will they are the last
[1:24:54] prophecy and the last
[1:24:56] voice hallelujah god in a bride his last
[1:25:01] voice
[1:25:02] amen his last sign
[1:25:05] amen the son of man a prophetical class
[1:25:08] of people
[1:25:09] are people who know their god are people
[1:25:12] who experience their god
[1:25:14] amen of people there who are who are
[1:25:17] absolutely a class of prophets
[1:25:26] you say brother tim
[1:25:28] where in the world would you get
[1:25:30] something like that from well listen to
[1:25:32] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:25:36] you recall i mentioned at the beginning
[1:25:37] of this
[1:25:38] message that this book the book of
[1:25:41] revelation
[1:25:42] is the actual revelation of jesus
[1:25:44] himself in the church and his work in
[1:25:46] the future ages
[1:25:48] then i mentioned it takes the holy
[1:25:50] spirit to give us revelation or we will
[1:25:53] fail to get it
[1:25:55] bringing those two thoughts together you
[1:25:57] see it won't take just ordinary study
[1:26:00] and thinking to make this book real
[1:26:03] you can't pass it on
[1:26:05] intellectually
[1:26:07] rule number one
[1:26:09] amen it is going to take more than
[1:26:11] ordinary study
[1:26:13] and thinking
[1:26:15] and class teaching
[1:26:17] and educating a bunch of people
[1:26:21] come on we turn message churches into
[1:26:23] educational seminaries
[1:26:26] until people are dead it's 12 o'clock
[1:26:29] midnight and they got a knowledge but
[1:26:31] they don't know jesus
[1:26:39] now
[1:26:40] it's going to take the operation of the
[1:26:42] holy ghost
[1:26:44] that means this book cannot be revealed
[1:26:46] to anyone but a special class of people
[1:26:51] it will take one with prophetic insight
[1:26:54] what
[1:26:56] a people with a prophetic insight
[1:26:59] it will require the ability to hear from
[1:27:01] god
[1:27:03] hallelujah
[1:27:04] somebody's going to hear what the spirit
[1:27:06] had to say
[1:27:07] it will require supernatural instruction
[1:27:11] not just a student comparing verse by
[1:27:13] verse
[1:27:14] though that is good but a mystery
[1:27:16] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:27:19] it never becomes clear
[1:27:21] how how we need to hear from god and to
[1:27:24] lay ourselves open and become yielded to
[1:27:26] the spirit to hear and know
[1:27:28] so it is not going to come it is not
[1:27:31] going to come by educating people
[1:27:34] teaching you a doctrine
[1:27:36] come on amen is going to come by the
[1:27:39] holy spirit dwelling on the inside of
[1:27:41] you that quickens the word to life on
[1:27:44] the inside now so it's more than an
[1:27:47] anuser street a azusa street anointing
[1:27:51] just upon the flesh and upon the spirit
[1:27:53] realm
[1:27:54] it's not an empty jump and a shout with
[1:27:58] no change of life it's upon the soul and
[1:28:01] it seals you to the day of redemption
[1:28:05] it's not temporary and it doesn't come
[1:28:08] and go i'm talking about the holy ghost
[1:28:11] it doesn't come and go it abides like it
[1:28:14] did upon jesus when the comforter comes
[1:28:16] it will abide with you forever
[1:28:19] and when it came on jesus it abode upon
[1:28:23] him it didn't leave him
[1:28:27] i'm talking about sons
[1:28:29] i'm talking about the rise of sons
[1:28:32] amen who are not just having an
[1:28:34] experience and going back and
[1:28:38] drooping back down in sin again no i'm
[1:28:40] talking about overcomers
[1:28:43] hallelujah i'm talking about power pack
[1:28:48] amen anointed
[1:28:50] on fire
[1:28:52] won't ever burn down
[1:28:56] hallelujah
[1:28:58] now it's on the soul and it seals you
[1:29:01] to the day of redemption
[1:29:04] yeah
[1:29:05] you can shout and
[1:29:07] jump and speak in tongues and backslide
[1:29:09] and fall away from the holy ghost
[1:29:12] but only
[1:29:14] if you're anointed in the human spirit
[1:29:15] realm
[1:29:18] that was the problem with azusa street
[1:29:21] they had to manufacture tongues and
[1:29:23] manufacture a shout and work up
[1:29:25] something and it was only temporary
[1:29:28] but what we got is not temporary
[1:29:33] amen so you can jump shout and speak in
[1:29:35] tongues and backslide and fall away if
[1:29:38] you can as brother brandon said you can
[1:29:40] have the holy ghost every day of your
[1:29:41] life and still go to hell if it's on the
[1:29:43] spirit realm
[1:29:46] amen
[1:29:48] that's exactly right
[1:29:49] amen i could just stop right there for a
[1:29:52] minute and tell an experience
[1:29:54] or i had a young you know a young mother
[1:29:56] there that
[1:29:58] that that was so possessed
[1:30:00] with an evil spirits
[1:30:02] that was upon her she'd have about five
[1:30:04] children from about five different men
[1:30:07] some of them she didn't even know who
[1:30:09] the daddy was
[1:30:10] but she was pentecostal
[1:30:12] and every time that you know she
[1:30:15] she would
[1:30:16] need another man she'd backslide and go
[1:30:18] get her another and then come back to
[1:30:19] church and speak in tongues he was all
[1:30:21] right
[1:30:24] one day she was
[1:30:26] she was in a desperate condition she had
[1:30:28] started to run off with a another guy
[1:30:30] she just started coming to my church
[1:30:33] and she see you know what
[1:30:35] was starting to run off with another guy
[1:30:37] and her young son run out
[1:30:39] caught her and said mama don't do it
[1:30:40] don't do it said you'll go to hell
[1:30:43] and they got about a block away and she
[1:30:44] got a conviction and she called me and
[1:30:46] she said brother tim you got to do
[1:30:48] something here
[1:30:49] i i gotta i gotta have help
[1:30:52] i've got the spirit upon me that once
[1:30:54] wants men
[1:30:56] and said i said well
[1:30:57] i said i can come but there's got to be
[1:30:59] somebody there i said my wife can't come
[1:31:01] right now i said i can come but who's
[1:31:04] there at the house so well
[1:31:05] my my daughter and
[1:31:08] daughter-in-law and son is are here and
[1:31:10] i said well if they'll be there when i
[1:31:12] get there i'll come so i went there to
[1:31:15] the house
[1:31:16] and i go to their house and
[1:31:18] and they were they were backslidden and
[1:31:21] away from god there's this couple was
[1:31:23] and and i'm going to deal with the young
[1:31:26] man's mother and and uh
[1:31:29] and i i i said well you know i can't
[1:31:31] deal with this with unbelief but i gotta
[1:31:33] have you in this in this room so i
[1:31:35] turned her i said take your chairs turn
[1:31:37] around face the wall
[1:31:39] while i deal with her
[1:31:40] and i began to speak to her about her
[1:31:43] sin about her wrong
[1:31:45] and all of that
[1:31:47] and and then i commanded the demon to
[1:31:50] leave her
[1:31:53] and as i did she threw up her hands and
[1:31:56] began to speak in tongues and i stood
[1:31:58] there for a minute and i watched that
[1:32:00] and i just kind of walked around
[1:32:02] watching this oh she's speaking in
[1:32:04] tongues
[1:32:05] and as i
[1:32:06] looked at her the inspiration hit me and
[1:32:08] i said satan you've hit all these years
[1:32:11] behind speaking in tongues
[1:32:13] but you've been exposed now
[1:32:15] now you come out of that woman right now
[1:32:17] in the name of jesus christ
[1:32:19] she took her hands and bowed down to me
[1:32:21] seven times to the holy spirit within me
[1:32:24] seven times and claps on the floor
[1:32:27] never to go back in the sin again
[1:32:32] it was over
[1:32:34] i remember you can dance and shout and
[1:32:36] speak in tongues and backslide and fall
[1:32:39] away only
[1:32:41] if it's just on your spirit realm
[1:32:44] but if it ever ignites that soul
[1:32:48] that seed gene of god on the inside of
[1:32:51] you there is no going back
[1:32:55] you can't go back you won't go back the
[1:32:58] desire of the world and sin is taken
[1:33:01] away
[1:33:12] but now don't take that negatively
[1:33:15] there are those who also have shouted
[1:33:16] spoken tongues which by the way
[1:33:19] is one of the signs that follows
[1:33:21] believers these signs shall follow the
[1:33:23] believers
[1:33:24] that's among believers and we have young
[1:33:27] people and old people
[1:33:28] who are getting more than a good feeling
[1:33:30] on their human spirit
[1:33:32] amen their soul is sealed and that holy
[1:33:35] ghost abides with them forever
[1:33:37] they not only had the stimulation to
[1:33:39] jump and shout but they got the life of
[1:33:41] christ to go with it
[1:33:45] amen brother branham said in the i was
[1:33:47] at third fourth seal he was said he was
[1:33:49] talking about those who you know jumped
[1:33:52] and shouted with us when the music and
[1:33:53] play and he said now that's all right
[1:33:55] too i believe in that as long as you
[1:33:58] leave the live the life
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:03] but now you see the life of christ has
[1:34:06] to go with it
[1:34:09] that is your true absolute
[1:34:12] amen that's your thai post
[1:34:15] where that you have met jesus christ
[1:34:17] yourself
[1:34:18] now this is more than justification and
[1:34:22] forgiveness of your sins where you
[1:34:24] believe the message of the gospel a lot
[1:34:26] of people stop right there
[1:34:28] a lot of good message people have
[1:34:30] stopped right there
[1:34:31] they profess i believe
[1:34:33] i believe the message i believe the odd
[1:34:35] sin of prophet i believe jesus savior i
[1:34:38] i believe i believe i believe and they
[1:34:40] stop right there
[1:34:42] it is more than sanctification where
[1:34:44] your own life is cleansed
[1:34:47] and there there again this is a problem
[1:34:50] many people stop right there oh brother
[1:34:52] tim i don't drink no more i don't even
[1:34:53] have the desire to drink you still need
[1:34:55] the holy ghost
[1:34:59] said well it had to be the holy ghost
[1:35:01] that took it yes the holy ghost took
[1:35:02] that from you it was the cleansing power
[1:35:05] that came and cleansed you from sin but
[1:35:07] you got to be possessed with the holy
[1:35:10] ghost or you could go ten years from now
[1:35:13] and explode with the devil coming back
[1:35:19] how many times have we seen them time
[1:35:21] bombs go off
[1:35:23] well you know i want you to listen to a
[1:35:24] quote here from hidden life
[1:35:27] i noticed among our brethren
[1:35:29] many of you as coming from into you as
[1:35:32] full gospel people coming from the
[1:35:33] baptist church myself
[1:35:35] which
[1:35:37] the baptist church believes you receive
[1:35:38] the holy ghost when you believe and
[1:35:41] that's not scriptural
[1:35:44] and he said coming to you among you as
[1:35:46] full gospel people coming from the
[1:35:48] baptist church myself and accepting
[1:35:51] the doctrine
[1:35:53] of the baptism of the holy spirit being
[1:35:56] a separate work of the holy spirit
[1:36:01] did you catch that
[1:36:03] accepting the doctrine of the baptism of
[1:36:06] the holy spirit
[1:36:08] being a separate work
[1:36:11] of the holy spirit
[1:36:13] you see justification is a work of the
[1:36:16] holy spirit you could be forgiven of
[1:36:17] sins past and still smoking
[1:36:22] drinking i believed on the lord there's
[1:36:25] many many a good baptist that does that
[1:36:29] and they said well i you know i i i
[1:36:31] thought with the man one day brother tim
[1:36:33] you know i need some advice on marriage
[1:36:35] he was wanting married for his third or
[1:36:37] fourth time
[1:36:39] and he's talking to the wrong person
[1:36:43] but wait but he said you know i i i want
[1:36:46] some advice on this marriage and i i've
[1:36:49] been seeing this girl and he goes to
[1:36:51] explain and see he said now i'm not
[1:36:54] needing salvation
[1:36:55] and he's lighting one cigarette off
[1:36:57] another
[1:37:00] it's a chain smoker he had just been
[1:37:02] arrested the week before for drunk
[1:37:04] driving
[1:37:07] and he said now i'm not
[1:37:09] not needing salvation i am i know
[1:37:12] without a doubt if i would
[1:37:15] would die this minute i'd go right
[1:37:17] straight to heaven
[1:37:20] you see he
[1:37:22] something had happened to him he had
[1:37:24] made a profession of faith but he hadn't
[1:37:28] went far enough to for sanctification to
[1:37:30] come and cleanse him
[1:37:32] so he was still now smoking you know
[1:37:35] fornicating and and thinking of an
[1:37:37] adulterous marriage and all of this kind
[1:37:40] of stuff and and you know because why
[1:37:43] his nature wasn't changed he wasn't
[1:37:44] cleansed
[1:37:46] now you you see
[1:37:49] but that was but again sanctification is
[1:37:51] a
[1:37:52] work of the holy spirit
[1:37:55] and and so he says
[1:37:58] except in the doctrine the doctrine of
[1:38:00] the baptism of the holy spirit being a
[1:38:02] separate work of the holy spirit
[1:38:06] so you see the holy spirit must come in
[1:38:09] after you have repented of your sins
[1:38:13] some of us want i want to get baptized
[1:38:15] well the first thing you do is repent
[1:38:18] turn from your sins
[1:38:20] calling on the name of the lord
[1:38:23] amen it starts right there godly sorrow
[1:38:26] bring forth repentance
[1:38:27] amen will you dry out your sin the
[1:38:30] desires of sin
[1:38:31] and then be baptized in his name but
[1:38:33] don't stop at water baptism that's only
[1:38:35] an outward work of an inward confession
[1:38:38] it's he's only telling that you know
[1:38:40] you're testifying something's happened
[1:38:42] on the inside of me but friend you've
[1:38:44] got to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:38:48] it is it is the token it is it is a
[1:38:51] prerequisite for the rapture
[1:38:54] you wind up in the tribulation with a
[1:38:56] sanctified life
[1:38:59] you wind up being left behind with just
[1:39:01] a justified life
[1:39:03] you've got to be filled with the holy
[1:39:05] ghost
[1:39:10] so we believe the doctrine of the
[1:39:12] baptism of holy ghost is being a
[1:39:14] separate work of the holy spirit than
[1:39:16] just a profession of faith in the
[1:39:18] doctrines of the message
[1:39:20] we believe in the doctrine of the
[1:39:22] baptism of the holy ghost being a
[1:39:24] separate work of the holy spirit than
[1:39:27] even cleaning up and changing your
[1:39:28] manner of dress
[1:39:32] amen
[1:39:34] you know
[1:39:35] you can join the amish and conform
[1:39:40] people do it
[1:39:42] you can join the mennonites and put on
[1:39:44] the bonnet prayer bonnet and the long
[1:39:46] dress and
[1:39:47] you know get a horse and buggy
[1:39:52] you can join a message church
[1:39:58] come on
[1:40:00] amen now but to be a part of the body
[1:40:04] you got to be born in it
[1:40:08] are you with me so it's more than an
[1:40:10] anointing that comes and goes and you
[1:40:12] know it it's it's
[1:40:14] the holy ghost sealing you unto your day
[1:40:17] of redemption
[1:40:19] where god is sealed in your life
[1:40:21] and
[1:40:22] listen satan is sealed out
[1:40:28] ephesians 1 13 let's take some scripture
[1:40:31] in whom you also trusted after you heard
[1:40:34] the word of truth after you received and
[1:40:36] believed and heard the word of truth the
[1:40:39] gospel of your salvation in whom after
[1:40:43] somebody say after
[1:40:45] after that you believed
[1:40:47] what you were sealed with that holy
[1:40:50] spirit of promise
[1:40:52] so the seal comes after believing
[1:40:56] hey man you can't you can't get it until
[1:40:58] you believe
[1:41:00] you got to believe it's for you
[1:41:02] you got to believe it is for this day
[1:41:05] you got to believe it's for you
[1:41:07] personally
[1:41:08] amen he that cometh god must believe
[1:41:12] that he is and that he'll reward you if
[1:41:14] you'll diligently seek him
[1:41:16] amen but after you believe you were
[1:41:18] sealed with the holy spirit of promise
[1:41:20] acts 19 2 have you received the holy
[1:41:22] ghost since
[1:41:24] somebody say since
[1:41:26] since you believed
[1:41:28] you see the holy ghost comes after
[1:41:30] hearing the word of truth it comes after
[1:41:33] you believe but it is a definite
[1:41:36] experience that seals you in
[1:41:39] and seals satan's out let me say it
[1:41:41] clearly it makes god a father and makes
[1:41:45] you a son
[1:41:47] hallelujah remember the purpose of jesus
[1:41:50] coming was not that there would be one
[1:41:52] son but to bring many sons
[1:41:55] somebody said many sons
[1:41:58] now
[1:41:59] i just say it right now because some of
[1:42:01] you are wondering satan can he might get
[1:42:04] on your spirit realm
[1:42:05] and tempt you
[1:42:07] and make you feel so dirty
[1:42:09] but let me assure you he cannot get to
[1:42:12] your soul
[1:42:14] no trial can shake you
[1:42:16] no disappointment can shake you
[1:42:19] you are on that solid rock of revelation
[1:42:22] where christ was personally revealed to
[1:42:25] you and let me tell you at the gates of
[1:42:27] hell
[1:42:28] cannot prevail against it
[1:42:31] hallelujah no storm can blow you off of
[1:42:34] that rock
[1:42:35] no wave no water no nothing that the
[1:42:39] devil ever throws at you can blow you
[1:42:41] off of that rock
[1:42:43] you're not on sinking sand
[1:42:46] on this rock
[1:42:48] knowing me knowing me personally
[1:42:51] knowing who i am the revelation of who i
[1:42:54] am that tells you who you are
[1:42:59] this is what i'll build my church on
[1:43:03] and when you get there
[1:43:05] no devil can prevail against you
[1:43:10] now this bride is not another church who
[1:43:12] ends up in failure
[1:43:14] she cannot fall
[1:43:16] she
[1:43:18] she is unlike pentecost of 2000 years
[1:43:22] ago
[1:43:23] because that was as a seed of wheat
[1:43:26] mature grain
[1:43:27] but it would go down in the ground it
[1:43:29] would rot it would decay and it would
[1:43:30] bring up a loot or a wesley all the way
[1:43:33] down
[1:43:36] but she's unlike pentecostal 2000 years
[1:43:38] ago she instead is predestinated
[1:43:42] not to fall
[1:43:44] amen we have been predestined to hold to
[1:43:48] the word regardless of what the world
[1:43:51] has to say about it
[1:43:54] amen no matter how discouraged i get
[1:43:57] i always remember i'll have a church
[1:44:01] and she'll be without spider-wrinkle
[1:44:04] or a blemish or any such thing i don't
[1:44:08] know how god's going to do it sometimes
[1:44:11] but i know he's going to do it
[1:44:13] because he made a promise
[1:44:18] now
[1:44:19] of course we get criticism they say
[1:44:22] we're pentecostal and we are
[1:44:25] but not like they want to label us
[1:44:28] well you know
[1:44:30] i can already get it you know i i don't
[1:44:32] like those
[1:44:33] those people shouting and dancing and
[1:44:35] rejoicing and running the aisles
[1:44:38] well you know brother branham was asked
[1:44:40] about that by dr reed head
[1:44:43] and he said
[1:44:45] he said in response to that because
[1:44:48] he didn't believe that was the holy
[1:44:49] ghost doing that he said well i can
[1:44:52] stand this is your prophet i can stand a
[1:44:55] little wildfire and kicking furniture
[1:44:57] over
[1:44:58] before i could sit on an old church so
[1:45:01] cold till the spiritual thermometer goes
[1:45:03] 40 below zero i'd rather have a little
[1:45:06] wildfire
[1:45:08] than no fire at all
[1:45:10] [Applause]
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:15] well i don't want nothing that would
[1:45:17] make me cry or shout or dance or speak
[1:45:20] in tongues or prophesy
[1:45:22] it don't look like church order to me
[1:45:24] well brother branham did say we ought to
[1:45:26] get out of order long enough to get
[1:45:28] saved
[1:45:32] and he tells an experience of how he was
[1:45:35] in oregon one time
[1:45:37] and there was two little catholic
[1:45:39] reporter girls that
[1:45:41] were um were there and um and they
[1:45:45] wanted to interview him and
[1:45:47] and uh and he said i caught their spirit
[1:45:50] just as soon as he come in and said i
[1:45:52] said all right now what criticism have
[1:45:54] you got up your sleeve now this girl she
[1:45:56] pulled out a cigarette and started
[1:45:58] saying well don't like that while you're
[1:45:59] in my cabin let's leave that alone so
[1:46:01] they sat there and she looked at me like
[1:46:03] she could run through me and she began
[1:46:05] to talk something so i want to ask you
[1:46:06] some questions she said he said say on
[1:46:09] she said well how come you're connected
[1:46:12] up there with this bunch of holy rollers
[1:46:14] up here
[1:46:15] are you one of them and he said i'm one
[1:46:17] of them
[1:46:18] after all one of his sermon titles is
[1:46:21] why i am a holy roller
[1:46:24] i'm one of them and she said well you
[1:46:27] mean to tell me there'd be anything
[1:46:28] godly about that i said not to you as a
[1:46:31] catholic
[1:46:32] you wouldn't believe said how do you
[1:46:33] know i'm a catholic said i know you're
[1:46:35] catholic i'll tell you what your name is
[1:46:37] see and who you are and that took her
[1:46:39] off her feet
[1:46:40] and she said well you mean to tell me
[1:46:42] that kind of people they say well live
[1:46:45] here on earth and be in heaven i
[1:46:47] wouldn't want to be in heaven with such
[1:46:48] a people as that
[1:46:50] and he said he said i said you don't
[1:46:53] have to worry very much as long as you
[1:46:56] think that way you won't be there anyhow
[1:46:58] see i said you won't have to worry about
[1:47:00] that
[1:47:01] and i stood there and looked right here
[1:47:03] in the face and a couple of brothers
[1:47:05] sitting in the building i said i'm not
[1:47:07] being irritable but i want you to know
[1:47:09] where you're standing you're going to
[1:47:11] write you want to come here and find out
[1:47:12] some stuff you would never write what i
[1:47:15] told you you'll make up your own story
[1:47:17] you go ahead and do that but i want to
[1:47:18] tell you one thing
[1:47:20] you write any scandal you want to
[1:47:23] and before you die
[1:47:25] my voice will call back in your ears
[1:47:29] if you duh if it doesn't then know i'm a
[1:47:31] false prophet
[1:47:33] and you i just want to say out here on
[1:47:35] the internet that you that sent me a
[1:47:36] warning the other day
[1:47:40] i want you to hear right now
[1:47:43] amen when you die
[1:47:44] you'll hear this prophet's voice
[1:47:46] screaming in your ears
[1:47:50] the very one you denied
[1:47:54] the very one you made fun of
[1:47:57] now go write whatever you want to and i
[1:47:59] said wrap it up
[1:48:02] put up your
[1:48:03] put up your internet accounts and all
[1:48:05] that why i'ma give us a message and why
[1:48:07] i left the message
[1:48:09] i'll tell you why you left it because
[1:48:10] you never had the holy ghost
[1:48:13] before you die you'll hear my voice
[1:48:15] screaming in your ears it'll do you no
[1:48:16] good now you go ahead and write whatever
[1:48:18] you want to
[1:48:19] she stood there a lot a little bit and
[1:48:21] said well what do you think about that
[1:48:23] idiotic bunch up there screaming and
[1:48:26] carrying on last night
[1:48:28] i said they're all christians she said
[1:48:29] christians
[1:48:30] i said sure they're christians they're
[1:48:32] christians filled with the holy ghost
[1:48:34] she said that's not no holy ghost i said
[1:48:36] well what would you call the holy ghost
[1:48:39] see what she had to say about it said
[1:48:40] i'd like to tell you something
[1:48:42] so well i wouldn't want to associate
[1:48:44] myself with a bunch like that
[1:48:46] i said well i don't think there's much
[1:48:48] danger
[1:48:49] of you ever associating yourself like
[1:48:52] that because if you're ever associated
[1:48:54] with god or any of the saints uh you
[1:48:57] would associate like that she said the
[1:49:00] bible say i said yes your blessed virgin
[1:49:03] mary you call her who is your goddess i
[1:49:06] said before god would ever let her come
[1:49:08] to heaven she had to go up onto the day
[1:49:11] of pentecost and receive the holy ghost
[1:49:14] and stagger under the power of god like
[1:49:17] a drunk woman
[1:49:20] she said that's a lie i said hold your
[1:49:21] peace and turn over the book and i said
[1:49:23] look here it's right here in the in the
[1:49:25] bible and she turned her head and said
[1:49:27] and he she wasn't reading he said you
[1:49:29] don't even have the audacity to read
[1:49:31] god's word you're disrespectful now you
[1:49:33] take your pack of cigarettes off the
[1:49:35] table there and go when you're ready but
[1:49:36] i want you to know one thing you write
[1:49:38] whatever you want to but remember the
[1:49:40] last words i say in the name of the lord
[1:49:42] you'll remember before you die she never
[1:49:45] wrote nothing that's right she just let
[1:49:46] it go
[1:49:49] she had more sense
[1:49:51] than some of these others out there
[1:49:54] but let me just tell you we are not
[1:49:56] let's understand we are not a repeat of
[1:50:00] pentecost
[1:50:01] pentecost declined and slid into the
[1:50:04] dark ages
[1:50:05] we are continuation of the book of acts
[1:50:08] and we will finish it
[1:50:11] with the coronation of the church the
[1:50:14] resurrection of the dead and the chains
[1:50:17] of our bodies
[1:50:19] let me quote the messenger they are
[1:50:21] predestinated
[1:50:23] to stand there the adoption of jesus
[1:50:26] christ of children by jesus christ
[1:50:28] predestinated the church to that
[1:50:31] glorious stand
[1:50:33] i want you to know we've been seen in
[1:50:34] the vision
[1:50:37] hallelujah when the rest of the world
[1:50:39] was out dancing to the tune of rock and
[1:50:41] roll this bride was seen going up
[1:50:45] the same one that was in the beginning
[1:50:46] come again
[1:50:48] we have been seen
[1:50:51] we individually now let's get this
[1:50:54] individually we are predestined to
[1:50:57] adoption that is where the person
[1:51:00] is recognized as a son
[1:51:03] by receiving the baptism of the holy
[1:51:05] ghost you come to the altar and you get
[1:51:07] the baptism of the holy ghost you don't
[1:51:09] become a son
[1:51:10] you always were a son
[1:51:12] and because you were a son you could be
[1:51:15] reborn
[1:51:17] amen you could be quickened and non-seed
[1:51:19] there's nothing to quicken but because
[1:51:21] there is a seed in you you can't be
[1:51:23] quickened
[1:51:25] but at the altar you just find out who
[1:51:27] you are
[1:51:28] this is where he says back to you this
[1:51:31] is my beloved sin
[1:51:34] in whom i'm pleased to dwell in
[1:51:38] that's when you recognize god as your
[1:51:40] father
[1:51:41] now as the elect church
[1:51:43] we are predestinated to adoption now
[1:51:46] that's a different adoption that is the
[1:51:48] change of our body
[1:51:50] our destiny has been set and that
[1:51:52] destiny is a full
[1:51:54] grown
[1:51:56] manifested church
[1:51:58] the elect lady is the rise of sons
[1:52:01] full sons mature sons who speak in his
[1:52:05] name
[1:52:06] we are the sons of god and as sons we
[1:52:09] are not called
[1:52:10] sons
[1:52:12] because god saved the devil's children
[1:52:15] and then adopted them
[1:52:18] are you with me we have always been his
[1:52:22] by for knowledge and but now we are
[1:52:25] people born of the very blood of god
[1:52:30] how so because the holy spirit is the
[1:52:33] life of the blood therefore we are born
[1:52:36] of his blood
[1:52:38] thus we have his life
[1:52:40] we have his dna
[1:52:42] how else could he write his laws within
[1:52:45] us
[1:52:46] you see the coming of the holy spirit in
[1:52:48] in the form of the mighty angel with the
[1:52:51] open book
[1:52:52] as shown in revelation 10 it brings
[1:52:55] the people into a messianic age
[1:52:59] where that there is a messianic sons of
[1:53:03] god upon the earth what do we mean
[1:53:05] messianic sons
[1:53:07] we mean the anointed ones of god
[1:53:11] men and women who have been anointed set
[1:53:15] apart
[1:53:16] filled
[1:53:17] sons
[1:53:19] the mighty angel is here to to answer
[1:53:22] him the final work
[1:53:24] he will accomplish the work
[1:53:28] amen to oversee it he's here to oversee
[1:53:30] it
[1:53:31] it's incredibly personal to him
[1:53:34] he will not abandon the project that he
[1:53:37] started
[1:53:39] then he comes in 1946
[1:53:42] and he begins to reveal himself to a
[1:53:44] prophet and he continues through the
[1:53:47] unfolding unfoldings unfolding unfolding
[1:53:50] come on
[1:53:51] amen and god is still unfolding himself
[1:53:54] he has not stopped
[1:53:56] he is still working in his church
[1:53:59] he's still moving in his people
[1:54:02] in fact the matter is it's not getting
[1:54:04] lesser the countdown is own
[1:54:08] amen oh my now wait don't go back to the
[1:54:11] invention of the wheel like in luther's
[1:54:13] day
[1:54:14] don't be satisfied with the horse and
[1:54:16] buggy experience and you know uh of of
[1:54:20] uh wesley's day i mean that's a pretty
[1:54:23] rough ride you know you know bouncing
[1:54:25] along you know you don't hardly get
[1:54:27] nowhere
[1:54:28] see you know sanctified one day and back
[1:54:31] down again and heck you'll get
[1:54:32] re-sanctified again
[1:54:34] over and over and over and fall down
[1:54:36] into pornography and up you come again
[1:54:39] and you got to get it out no you know
[1:54:41] get beyond that
[1:54:42] and don't be satisfied with flying
[1:54:45] around and bouncing you know like the
[1:54:47] turbulence and
[1:54:49] of the azusa street you might be flying
[1:54:51] but be you got to go beyond that
[1:54:54] be an astronaut
[1:54:56] amen get out of here you know get beyond
[1:54:59] the realms of the sense
[1:55:01] world
[1:55:03] amen into the supernatural where all
[1:55:05] things are possible
[1:55:07] amen now i don't mean
[1:55:11] let me pardon pause here
[1:55:13] i don't mean to advance
[1:55:16] beyond the seventh angel in his message
[1:55:19] i do not mean that
[1:55:23] in the message paradox
[1:55:25] he said there's going to be no more
[1:55:26] church ages this is the end of it
[1:55:29] the laodicean age was the last age and
[1:55:31] pentecost is that
[1:55:33] leo the seen age and we know that there
[1:55:35] will never be
[1:55:36] no more above pentecost that's it like a
[1:55:39] man
[1:55:40] another no creature can ever
[1:55:44] come up from this evolution coming up
[1:55:46] into higher species and man because man
[1:55:48] is the image of god who created him and
[1:55:51] there'll never be nothing higher the
[1:55:53] word wouldn't let it go any farther
[1:55:55] because he is the word and neither can
[1:55:58] the word climb above any laodicean
[1:56:03] church age
[1:56:05] so it ain't gonna go beyond this age
[1:56:08] or this messenger
[1:56:11] so well we're in the bride age as if
[1:56:13] that's a separate age
[1:56:15] amen that's right here in this laodicean
[1:56:17] age where overcomers sit with him on his
[1:56:20] throne it ain't another age where some
[1:56:23] other knucklehead comes up with his own
[1:56:26] ideas and leads a bunch of people out in
[1:56:28] the wilderness again
[1:56:30] oh no it ain't that it ain't a
[1:56:32] personality cult
[1:56:34] amen it is saying what the spirit has
[1:56:37] already said
[1:56:38] prophesying again
[1:56:43] so though we can't go beyond the
[1:56:44] messenger
[1:56:46] we should at least advance to the
[1:56:48] fullness
[1:56:50] of what he taught
[1:56:54] we're in the stage of advancement
[1:56:56] not regression
[1:56:59] where we
[1:57:00] climb only to fall back down
[1:57:03] as brother branham said
[1:57:05] and who do you say this is give me a
[1:57:08] church
[1:57:09] that's so completely anointed with god
[1:57:11] to their ever move in action their
[1:57:14] action and move is thus saith the lord
[1:57:17] walk in that shekinah glory and i'll
[1:57:19] show you a messiah
[1:57:21] an anointed one of god standing upon the
[1:57:24] earth
[1:57:25] we're talking about the rise of sun
[1:57:28] we were foreseen as coming as brother
[1:57:30] branham said in the adoption brother
[1:57:32] we're waiting for the manifestations of
[1:57:34] the sons of god who will come back and
[1:57:37] take it over again we're waiting for the
[1:57:40] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[1:57:43] to the top and full sons of god will be
[1:57:46] manifested when the power of god will
[1:57:49] walk out hallelujah and take every power
[1:57:53] that satan's god away from him
[1:57:56] hallelujah that's what the holy ghost
[1:57:58] power will do in a man
[1:58:00] that's what we saw it do in our
[1:58:02] messenger it took him beyond anything
[1:58:05] that denominations could experience
[1:58:08] amen it took him so beyond his peers
[1:58:11] until christ was revealed in him as a
[1:58:14] prophet and the denominations were
[1:58:16] saying show us the father
[1:58:19] and where and their christ was
[1:58:22] manifested
[1:58:23] amen as a son of man in a prophet come
[1:58:26] on as the word came to a prophet
[1:58:29] but don't stop there
[1:58:31] and then revelation shows the same thing
[1:58:34] as first thessalonians 4 of the
[1:58:36] descendant of christ our lord is the
[1:58:38] mighty messenger of his own covenant
[1:58:41] his covenant is coming as three phases a
[1:58:44] shout
[1:58:45] a voice
[1:58:46] and the trump
[1:58:48] amen
[1:58:49] now the shout is the cry of the loud
[1:58:52] voice in revelation 10. we went through
[1:58:54] that
[1:58:55] you know it's the word coming to a
[1:58:57] prophet
[1:58:59] in order to get a bride now listen he
[1:59:02] couldn't take a denominational bride
[1:59:05] their their class in the bible is
[1:59:07] and harlots you say white so because
[1:59:10] they've taken the seeds the doctrine the
[1:59:12] man over the word of god that's whatever
[1:59:15] denomination is built upon
[1:59:18] and so it makes them adulterers
[1:59:22] it's the spirit of adultery
[1:59:24] amen a spirit of fornication taking
[1:59:27] seeds of man rather than the pure word
[1:59:29] of god and every denomination does that
[1:59:34] amen
[1:59:35] but
[1:59:36] god is calling for a virgin
[1:59:39] a bride
[1:59:40] without a spot
[1:59:42] without a wrinkle somebody help me
[1:59:44] preach
[1:59:45] amen who will be a virgin to the word
[1:59:48] who is not open to man-made creeds and
[1:59:50] dogmas
[1:59:52] amen but she will be an unpolluted
[1:59:55] virgin
[1:59:57] to the word
[1:59:59] who has one handship and that handshape
[2:00:02] is christ
[2:00:04] come on now
[2:00:06] listen listen pastors across the land
[2:00:09] you may be the head of a church but
[2:00:11] you're not head of the bride
[2:00:16] come on
[2:00:17] you may be head of the body the church
[2:00:20] but you're not head of the of the
[2:00:23] husband
[2:00:24] and and head over to women
[2:00:30] you're not head over
[2:00:32] people families your head over the
[2:00:35] church body
[2:00:36] the local body
[2:00:39] amen but every person's got to have the
[2:00:41] holy ghost the head of every man is
[2:00:45] pastor
[2:00:46] no
[2:00:47] the head of every man is
[2:00:50] christ
[2:00:51] and the head of every woman is the the
[2:00:54] man okay i know feminists don't want to
[2:00:57] hear that so you know if you're not
[2:00:58] feminist say it you know the head of the
[2:01:01] of of every man is
[2:01:04] and the head of the woman is
[2:01:07] the man
[2:01:14] now
[2:01:15] so again a pastor is not to be your holy
[2:01:18] ghost
[2:01:21] i preach against sin
[2:01:24] but i ain't coming to your house and
[2:01:25] enforcing it
[2:01:27] that's your problem
[2:01:28] that's your territory
[2:01:31] amen but i'll preach it in the church
[2:01:34] i'll preach against television but i
[2:01:35] ain't coming ripping yours out
[2:01:39] i will tell you you're not going in a
[2:01:41] rapture with one
[2:01:45] gumming that kind of filth down
[2:01:50] take this
[2:01:53] i'm in the fighting mood now
[2:01:58] again you see the head of the man is
[2:02:02] christ amen sure the head of a local
[2:02:05] body is a pastor
[2:02:07] we got that now but let me he doesn't
[2:02:10] rule over you tell you when to take
[2:02:11] vacation or what kind of house to buy or
[2:02:13] where you got to live or even where you
[2:02:15] go to church
[2:02:17] people come to me and say brother tim
[2:02:19] you know what should i do i said i don't
[2:02:21] know
[2:02:23] should i move you i don't know
[2:02:26] you're to pray over where you go to
[2:02:27] church because churches have spirits
[2:02:32] you're to pray over it
[2:02:34] you're to find out where you belong
[2:02:37] i'm not too
[2:02:38] you get a revelation
[2:02:40] you find out where god wants you
[2:02:43] amen my ministry won't feed everybody
[2:02:46] and they can be bribed and i don't feed
[2:02:47] them
[2:02:50] oh yeah my ministry won't feed everybody
[2:02:54] neither will anybody else's
[2:02:58] amen but there will be a ministry
[2:02:59] somewhere that will feed you
[2:03:02] exactly right but now listen let me
[2:03:04] again let me let's let's get back on
[2:03:07] track now and bring it back to back to
[2:03:09] center again on our thoughts you know
[2:03:12] there again his coming is in three
[2:03:14] phases of shout which is the loud voice
[2:03:18] it is the lion's roar of revelation 10
[2:03:22] as the mysteries are revealed to the
[2:03:24] seventh angel
[2:03:26] and it is the word coming to a prophet
[2:03:29] so the first thing he has to come in
[2:03:32] word form
[2:03:34] because he's going to create a bride
[2:03:36] finding none in denomination he's going
[2:03:38] to create a bride by his own word
[2:03:43] are you with me now
[2:03:44] now so it's the word coming to a prophet
[2:03:47] and brother branham told us in spoken
[2:03:49] words original seed my mission to the
[2:03:51] earth is to forerun the coming of the
[2:03:53] word the coming word which is christ
[2:03:58] so the message is christ
[2:04:01] i don't believe the message well you
[2:04:03] don't believe christ
[2:04:06] it's just all there is to it that's what
[2:04:07] the message is christ
[2:04:10] so well i'd rather believe the bible
[2:04:12] than to believe the message they're one
[2:04:14] and the same
[2:04:16] there's no difference
[2:04:21] come on
[2:04:23] our bible is our absolute
[2:04:26] amen
[2:04:27] it's where brother branham got the
[2:04:29] message
[2:04:30] it didn't come out of the book you you
[2:04:33] want you want to say well i believe the
[2:04:35] bible no you don't
[2:04:37] you believe the baptists
[2:04:39] and their theological books
[2:04:41] you believe the pentecostals and their
[2:04:43] theological books well we're not men
[2:04:45] followers yes you are
[2:04:48] if you're a catholic you're one of the
[2:04:50] three billions that follows a man the
[2:04:53] pope
[2:04:58] amen and if you've owned one of these
[2:05:00] denominations you belong to a church
[2:05:03] full of cross dressers
[2:05:06] women
[2:05:08] who are running the church
[2:05:11] telling how everything is to be done
[2:05:13] come on
[2:05:14] led by silly women
[2:05:17] instead of the bible
[2:05:19] get a preacher in and vote him out and
[2:05:21] get him and set his salary and you know
[2:05:23] and it's reverse it's reverse
[2:05:26] nicolaitanism
[2:05:30] nicoletism with a man rule when a man
[2:05:32] rules over like a pope rules over the
[2:05:34] church
[2:05:35] and that reverses where a committee
[2:05:38] rules the church
[2:05:43] and one of them
[2:05:45] is as wrong as the other they're both
[2:05:46] led by men
[2:05:50] amen
[2:05:52] you know i went to therapy here while
[2:05:53] back and and they they won't know what i
[2:05:56] was i was well i'm a pastor well okay
[2:05:58] where'd you go where did you graduate
[2:06:00] where was what's the school
[2:06:02] of seminary did you graduate i said same
[2:06:04] one jesus did
[2:06:12] now
[2:06:14] but notice notice again my mission he
[2:06:18] said is to forerun the coming word which
[2:06:20] is christ so the word had to be the
[2:06:24] first thing to come and it was
[2:06:26] forerunned with signs and wonders to
[2:06:29] show it was the word
[2:06:31] and would come with gifts of of
[2:06:34] discernment which only the the word can
[2:06:36] discern the thoughts and the intents of
[2:06:38] heart and it never failed
[2:06:42] that's exactly the truth amen but now
[2:06:45] this word would be christ not the
[2:06:47] corporal coming but the word coming
[2:06:50] christ would come in the fullness of his
[2:06:54] word
[2:06:55] amen that's the first phase of his
[2:06:58] coming a prophet bringing a message
[2:07:02] now
[2:07:03] we thought when we received the message
[2:07:06] that was it we thought that was the
[2:07:07] summit we can't go no higher than that
[2:07:10] but god had more than god sent in a
[2:07:13] prophet he didn't want a prophet he
[2:07:16] wanted a bride
[2:07:19] sure he had to get one man in his hand
[2:07:23] sure he had to have the seventh angel
[2:07:25] which is one of the stars in the hands
[2:07:27] of jehovah
[2:07:29] sure he had to get him and train him and
[2:07:31] set him apart from others
[2:07:34] but that's not the end results
[2:07:37] that's not all what god's doing and we
[2:07:40] have colonized now bear with me but
[2:07:43] we've colonized ourselves in the camps
[2:07:46] of thunder and perusia and returned
[2:07:48] ministry until we're organized tighter
[2:07:51] than denominations
[2:07:53] and what is it is nothing but another
[2:07:55] denominational move personality cults
[2:07:59] amen even but let me tell you the word
[2:08:02] has to take on flesh it cannot remain in
[2:08:06] books and tapes he's not going to
[2:08:07] rapture books and dates he's going to
[2:08:09] rapture a people for his namesake
[2:08:13] hallelujah so the son of man would be
[2:08:16] revealed in a prophetical class of
[2:08:19] people of bride hallelujah the rise of
[2:08:23] sons
[2:08:24] who are the sons of the book
[2:08:27] they are offsprings of that word
[2:08:30] they are the creation of that word
[2:08:35] i have been born again
[2:08:37] not of corruptible seed but of the word
[2:08:40] of god that liveth and abideth forever i
[2:08:43] am born of the word i am born of this
[2:08:47] message i cannot deny the message
[2:08:51] because i in the message are one
[2:08:59] amen
[2:09:01] now
[2:09:02] that's the way it's got to be with you
[2:09:05] you got to be the revival
[2:09:07] you got to be the message
[2:09:11] come on not written not written in paper
[2:09:14] or magnetic tape
[2:09:16] no not written in books lying on
[2:09:18] yourself and pictures on your wall
[2:09:20] written in your nature
[2:09:23] that's what the holy ghost does
[2:09:25] he comes and writes the law of god in
[2:09:28] your heart
[2:09:30] now notice again brother branham would
[2:09:33] tell us over and again he said jesus
[2:09:35] said as it was in the days of sodom so
[2:09:37] will it be in the coming of the son of
[2:09:39] man elohim the strong one would come
[2:09:41] down in human flesh you get it elohim
[2:09:43] the strong one would come down in human
[2:09:45] flesh and would manifest himself by
[2:09:47] knowing the secret of heart the one he
[2:09:49] was talking to just exactly what his son
[2:09:51] did when he was here on earth dwelling
[2:09:53] in human flesh
[2:09:55] what flesh
[2:09:57] your flesh
[2:09:58] my flesh the holy spirit himself coming
[2:10:01] down in human flesh and dwelling showing
[2:10:05] signs
[2:10:06] amen
[2:10:07] again he would say in the message
[2:10:10] abraham god would represent himself
[2:10:12] again in human flesh just before the
[2:10:14] coming of the son of man what flesh your
[2:10:16] flesh my flesh god coming down from
[2:10:19] heaven god longing for fellowship
[2:10:23] god becoming one with a people
[2:10:26] again he said see what the here in the
[2:10:28] elected church is god in your flesh
[2:10:31] manifested and jesus said as it was in
[2:10:33] the days of sodom so shall it be of the
[2:10:36] coming of the son of man you see it now
[2:10:38] we pass justification sanctification
[2:10:41] baptism of the holy ghost the place and
[2:10:43] the gift of the son and the church now
[2:10:45] is god manifesting himself for that sign
[2:10:48] in the message trial i challenge you to
[2:10:50] believe
[2:10:51] that jesus christ is revealed in the
[2:10:54] form of son of man in human flesh
[2:10:57] through the bride's body
[2:11:00] where through the bride's body
[2:11:03] amen a prophetic class of people
[2:11:07] a people who can hear the voice of god
[2:11:10] or people who are speaking the voice of
[2:11:12] god
[2:11:15] the forerunner would point to you
[2:11:18] coming
[2:11:19] he said brother branham was a forerunner
[2:11:21] that's right he was not the product he
[2:11:23] was not the christ he was the forerunner
[2:11:26] but now let me tell you he said as the
[2:11:28] first forerunner came from the
[2:11:29] wilderness and cried behold the lamb of
[2:11:31] god the second forerunner will probably
[2:11:33] do the same by pointing the people to a
[2:11:35] word born bride
[2:11:39] so he was for running
[2:11:41] you're coming
[2:11:44] now that brings us
[2:11:46] to the anointed people
[2:11:48] a bride who is the anointed one the
[2:11:52] easter seal and if he was messiah by
[2:11:55] being the anointed one for that day to
[2:11:58] fulfill the word of god to be the
[2:11:59] redeemer the anointed one and god raised
[2:12:01] up that body his bride is the anointed
[2:12:04] one for this day
[2:12:08] again christ's a mystery he would this
[2:12:10] time he would come forth he would
[2:12:11] express himself in the fullness of his
[2:12:14] godhead deity through his church have
[2:12:16] preeminence in his church
[2:12:18] the anointed man
[2:12:20] now the anointed people
[2:12:23] almighty bring back the anointed bride
[2:12:26] and bridegroom
[2:12:28] hallelujah by what accepting what eve
[2:12:31] turned down and adam coming back with
[2:12:33] the anointing of the word because he
[2:12:35] said my word is spirit
[2:12:37] amen anointed with that word and when
[2:12:40] eve what eve turned down he comes back
[2:12:42] and we accept now what did eve turn down
[2:12:47] she turned down the supernatural
[2:12:50] birth
[2:12:52] and rejected the word what word that
[2:12:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:12:57] forever that he'll keep his word
[2:13:00] amen let me tell you his power is the
[2:13:02] same his deity is the same the
[2:13:06] experience is the same his gifts are the
[2:13:09] same he is the same in every detail
[2:13:13] except his physical body
[2:13:21] now brother branham tells us in god of
[2:13:23] this evil age
[2:13:25] adam's bride believed every bit of the
[2:13:27] word just confused on one promise
[2:13:30] that he's the same yesterday today and
[2:13:32] forever
[2:13:33] and that's where the confusion is today
[2:13:38] they want to make this something
[2:13:39] different
[2:13:41] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:13:45] forever
[2:13:46] amen now so just
[2:13:49] as those in the upper room were charged
[2:13:51] with the holy ghost
[2:13:53] and were under his influence
[2:13:56] even so the same holy spirit has been
[2:14:00] once again
[2:14:01] released
[2:14:03] you know though it's been held back or
[2:14:06] bound by the doors of creeds and dogmas
[2:14:08] through the ages and the holy spirit
[2:14:11] couldn't work because of man-made
[2:14:13] systems
[2:14:14] she is liberated
[2:14:17] amen the holy spirit has been loosed by
[2:14:19] the evening time message the holy spirit
[2:14:22] back in the church again christ revealed
[2:14:25] where in human flesh
[2:14:27] show us the father
[2:14:30] and where's the act in sans
[2:14:35] now revelation 10
[2:14:38] shows the supernatural descendant of the
[2:14:40] spirit
[2:14:41] first god sent in a prophet now
[2:14:44] god's sending anointed sons
[2:14:47] who have consumed the book
[2:14:49] and the book has become flesh
[2:14:52] so much
[2:14:53] until they prophesy
[2:14:56] now when this happened this brings a war
[2:15:01] because
[2:15:02] god has is raising up sons
[2:15:06] for the last day battle
[2:15:09] come on not kids
[2:15:12] mature sons
[2:15:15] amen and it brings the war brother
[2:15:17] branham said she's going to be liberated
[2:15:19] she's coming back that's what the bible
[2:15:21] said those two meet one another on the
[2:15:24] battleground lucifer and michael again
[2:15:27] like in the beginning
[2:15:30] so here we come micah
[2:15:33] amen the great prince
[2:15:35] stands up
[2:15:36] the seals are open the mysteries are
[2:15:39] revealed and he's leading us to what
[2:15:41] whoa
[2:15:47] you see the gates of hell
[2:15:50] is against the spiritual revelation
[2:15:53] of jesus christ being here now the same
[2:15:57] yesterday today and forever
[2:15:59] the gates of hell is not against even
[2:16:01] like tabernacle
[2:16:04] the gates of hell is not against any
[2:16:07] kind of local body or denomination the
[2:16:10] gates of hell is against the spiritual
[2:16:12] revelation
[2:16:13] here's what the devil don't want you to
[2:16:15] get that spiritual revelation
[2:16:18] of christ being here now
[2:16:22] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:16:30] you can
[2:16:30] identify the antichrist spirit it must
[2:16:33] be withstood
[2:16:35] it's that evil spirit that wants to keep
[2:16:37] christ in a tomb
[2:16:39] wants to keep him dead
[2:16:41] wants his church to be a corpse
[2:16:44] it's that spirit that says christ was
[2:16:47] and not that christ is
[2:16:50] amen or that he will be but he isn't now
[2:16:54] how many things do we put up when the
[2:16:56] squeeze comes
[2:16:58] how many times when the third pull
[2:17:00] happens this is the third pull
[2:17:02] that's what this message is it is that
[2:17:04] third pull
[2:17:05] amen and the anointing they make the
[2:17:08] anointing used to be
[2:17:11] and will be ours later but it isn't now
[2:17:16] amen we got people thinking
[2:17:18] now bear with me buckley everybody stop
[2:17:21] just a minute buckle your seatbelt
[2:17:25] because
[2:17:27] we're we're going out of space all right
[2:17:29] but you need to be latched in
[2:17:33] because we got people thinking
[2:17:36] if you take the kobit vaccine it's the
[2:17:38] mark of the beast
[2:17:40] and if you believe that i just take it
[2:17:43] from me you're spiritually ignorant
[2:17:47] and you do you know what you're saying
[2:17:49] do you have you even thought about what
[2:17:51] you're saying you're saying if that you
[2:17:53] don't
[2:17:54] you're saying you're admitting you don't
[2:17:56] have the holy ghost
[2:17:59] and you miss the rapture
[2:18:02] because you're in the tribulation where
[2:18:04] the mark is forced
[2:18:07] and if the mark is forced with this
[2:18:09] vaccine
[2:18:11] if i could roll up my sleeve i'd show
[2:18:13] you a mark
[2:18:15] i was about six years old when i got it
[2:18:17] right here on this arm
[2:18:25] it vaccinated me and a bunch of other
[2:18:27] millions of kids and some of them died
[2:18:29] from it
[2:18:30] and some of them reacted severely from i
[2:18:32] saw a kid with his arms swallowed way
[2:18:34] out like that smallpox vaccine
[2:18:37] five needles going in one time
[2:18:40] and we had to take it
[2:18:42] and it wiped out a disease don't be
[2:18:44] stupid
[2:18:47] now
[2:18:48] so you know you you that's not the mark
[2:18:51] of the beast
[2:18:53] do you because you see
[2:18:55] you say well it's being forced okay
[2:18:58] we're americans
[2:18:59] we don't like to be forced at nothing i
[2:19:01] get that
[2:19:03] well brother tim
[2:19:05] i'm not a demorat well then you're a
[2:19:07] publican
[2:19:11] sinner either way
[2:19:12] well i'm conservative that's what i am
[2:19:15] really
[2:19:16] when sean hannity puts on bruce jenner
[2:19:19] as a conservative running for governor
[2:19:20] of california and that's the
[2:19:22] conservative voice and they're all roman
[2:19:24] catholic no that's not my identity
[2:19:29] i ain't of this world
[2:19:32] you want to make this a political thing
[2:19:34] or right or wrong or right side or left
[2:19:36] let me tell you it ain't
[2:19:39] amen right now the mark of the beast is
[2:19:42] spiritual
[2:19:45] and i want to get it to reject the seal
[2:19:48] of god to reject the holy ghost i've
[2:19:50] been preaching about is to take the mark
[2:19:53] of the beast
[2:19:54] [Music]
[2:19:54] [Applause]
[2:19:56] some of you have refused the holy ghost
[2:19:59] because you don't want to receive it
[2:20:01] like mary did on the day of pentecost
[2:20:03] and i'll tell you right now to refuse it
[2:20:06] doomed you to the tribulation and to
[2:20:08] miss the rapture and you take the mark
[2:20:11] of the beast some of you've already been
[2:20:13] marked with the beast
[2:20:14] i'll tell you the mark of the beast is
[2:20:16] upon you sin is in your life pornography
[2:20:18] is in your life the addictions all kinds
[2:20:21] of things are in your life it's the
[2:20:22] marking of the beast it shows the seal
[2:20:25] of god ain't there
[2:20:27] i told you this would be rough
[2:20:29] amen
[2:20:35] every spirit
[2:20:37] that doesn't witness that christ is come
[2:20:40] in our flesh is the antichrist spirit
[2:20:43] well brother tim i'll tell you i tell
[2:20:45] you to tell you
[2:20:46] the catholics are going to take over
[2:20:47] when
[2:20:48] we already got one in the president's
[2:20:50] office
[2:20:51] we're already our supreme court is full
[2:20:53] of them and all the conservatives on the
[2:20:55] radio are all catholics
[2:21:00] and conservatives today as yesterday's
[2:21:02] liberals
[2:21:04] are worse
[2:21:06] i don't identify with them
[2:21:09] amen
[2:21:11] every spirit that doesn't witness that
[2:21:14] christ has come in our flesh is the
[2:21:16] antichrist spirit
[2:21:18] now
[2:21:19] again
[2:21:20] these little organizational moves like
[2:21:23] we've had and lee vale with the perugia
[2:21:25] the two lord you know two jehovah's all
[2:21:27] the other things that had you know
[2:21:29] coleman's thunder myriads of others even
[2:21:31] so-called mainstream groups have
[2:21:34] crucified him again
[2:21:36] and put him to an open shame and
[2:21:38] entombed him
[2:21:41] amen and put him to an open shame
[2:21:44] haven't entered him that want him dead
[2:21:46] no movement of the spirit
[2:21:50] no divine healing
[2:21:52] no rejoicing of the believer
[2:21:54] no spiritual gifts
[2:21:56] amen that killed the prince of life
[2:21:59] putting him to an open shame and i'll
[2:22:02] just tell you you've already been
[2:22:03] indicted and doomed to miss the rapture
[2:22:05] and awake to
[2:22:06] tribulation amen these false prophets
[2:22:09] are prophesying
[2:22:11] their churches right into the
[2:22:13] tribulation
[2:22:19] the third exodus brother branham said
[2:22:21] they think because our churches have
[2:22:24] become intellectual
[2:22:25] that we got the best dressed crowds
[2:22:28] the biggest organization the most
[2:22:30] smartest ministers
[2:22:32] that we have no use of the holy spirit
[2:22:34] in the way it was back there that
[2:22:36] they're full
[2:22:37] in other words action speaks louder than
[2:22:40] words
[2:22:41] that they're seminars the brain of their
[2:22:43] being they're coming together the
[2:22:44] disgustingness are more able with their
[2:22:47] own intellectual intellectual mind to
[2:22:48] set a church in order better than what
[2:22:50] the holy spirit could do they don't need
[2:22:52] it anymore it's something we don't need
[2:22:54] today it's the days that's past now
[2:22:56] isn't that right we don't need the holy
[2:22:58] spirit to heal to say we got doctors we
[2:23:01] don't need the holy spirit to speak with
[2:23:02] tongues we're all intelligent people and
[2:23:05] when you do you take right from your
[2:23:08] framework the lifeline
[2:23:11] jesus said them jews in his last days
[2:23:14] and you uh in his days he said haven't
[2:23:16] you read that the stone that was
[2:23:18] rejected as a cheap cornerstone that all
[2:23:21] the building is setting upon now you see
[2:23:23] what i mean i'm sure you catch that the
[2:23:25] reason of it is because they thought
[2:23:28] they would never have need of that
[2:23:30] spiritual boy joseph so they sold him
[2:23:32] down to egypt
[2:23:34] we don't need speakers with tongues
[2:23:38] we don't need interpreters of tongues
[2:23:41] we no longer need prophets to set us in
[2:23:43] order by the holy spirit we understand
[2:23:46] that they've adopted a man-made system
[2:23:48] to take place in the holy spirit
[2:23:50] therefore there is a people
[2:23:53] hallelujah that is elected that has
[2:23:55] their names on the lamb's book of life
[2:23:58] i mean they can't go for that
[2:24:01] they are spiritual minded and therefore
[2:24:04] they cannot go for that they can't stand
[2:24:06] it no matter if their fathers and
[2:24:08] mothers would live in whatever
[2:24:10] organizational church when a church
[2:24:13] makes or does maybe it wouldn't speak
[2:24:15] that out oh no they won't speak it out
[2:24:17] but their actions prove it here's the
[2:24:20] word and the holy spirit proves it among
[2:24:22] and when he gets them gathered together
[2:24:24] that he heals the sick and raises the
[2:24:26] dead and speaks with tongues and casts
[2:24:28] out devil so it depends on what's on the
[2:24:31] inside
[2:24:33] of a person
[2:24:36] indicted
[2:24:38] that's why he preached the message
[2:24:40] indictment
[2:24:41] he said i indict
[2:24:43] this generation
[2:24:45] these denominational churches and many
[2:24:48] of the independents
[2:24:50] well brother timothy knows we're a small
[2:24:52] group they're some of the worst
[2:24:57] us for no more
[2:25:01] sitting around with pride in our hearts
[2:25:03] and the holy spirit hadn't moved in
[2:25:05] years
[2:25:06] there's no burden for the lost
[2:25:10] they're dead and cold and dried up
[2:25:15] brother brandon says no wonder they
[2:25:17] can't believe in miracles
[2:25:19] no wonder you can't believe in the
[2:25:20] supernatural
[2:25:22] no wonder they condemn it same reason
[2:25:24] they condemned it back there is the same
[2:25:26] they reason they condemn it today there
[2:25:28] is guilty as can be because it's only
[2:25:32] under the shed blood
[2:25:34] and those who would dare some little
[2:25:36] brother who dares under humility take
[2:25:39] god at his word and walk out there
[2:25:41] confess his sins forget these dogmas and
[2:25:44] the things and stand there under the
[2:25:45] blood and believe it and they want to
[2:25:47] call him fanatic they want they want to
[2:25:49] call him it's not good word is used in
[2:25:51] the pulpit they want but you'll
[2:25:52] understand he's an oddball and today i
[2:25:55] indict
[2:25:56] this bunch of
[2:25:58] ordained ministers and their creeds in
[2:26:00] denomination they're crucified to the
[2:26:02] people the very god they claim to love
[2:26:05] and serve i indict those ministers in
[2:26:08] the name of the lord jesus upon their
[2:26:10] doctrine that claim
[2:26:12] that the days of miracles are passed
[2:26:16] you don't think they do it oh yeah
[2:26:18] they do it
[2:26:19] oh we're just not in the season for it
[2:26:23] you know you know it's going to be but
[2:26:25] it ain't now
[2:26:27] you are indicted
[2:26:29] for crucifying
[2:26:31] and keeping the warts hey i tell you if
[2:26:34] i couldn't manifest it i'd at least
[2:26:36] preach it
[2:26:39] because you're never going to manifest
[2:26:41] it until it's preached
[2:26:43] amen healing's got to be preached the
[2:26:45] holy ghost has got to be preached
[2:26:50] the power of god has got to be preached
[2:26:52] faith comes by hearing i'm hearing the
[2:26:54] word of god and it causes people to
[2:26:56] believe
[2:26:58] it's got to be preached
[2:27:06] when the church allowed herself to move
[2:27:08] from the original like adam and eve
[2:27:10] death set in
[2:27:12] there's no strength in her
[2:27:14] she becomes a monstrosity
[2:27:16] the minute the church moved from toward
[2:27:19] form and ceremony
[2:27:21] and toward priesthood by organizing the
[2:27:24] ministers into a group that decided
[2:27:27] leadership apart from the holy spirit
[2:27:29] and his word
[2:27:30] that very moment death entered and she
[2:27:33] started to get sick and as she got sick
[2:27:36] she changed into a powerless group of
[2:27:38] people whose only weapon was argument
[2:27:43] she could produce nothing in the spirit
[2:27:45] for hopes were built on program and not
[2:27:48] on faith in his word
[2:27:50] they sowed programs so they reap
[2:27:52] programs they sowed perversion and so
[2:27:55] they reap perverted children
[2:27:58] that's the condition
[2:28:00] too many places
[2:28:02] that we don't want here
[2:28:04] amen but there is a bride
[2:28:07] in all of this there is a bride
[2:28:10] amen who has received the spirit of
[2:28:12] adoption
[2:28:13] and who recognizes themselves as the
[2:28:16] sons of god
[2:28:19] turn with me to romans 8 14 as many as
[2:28:22] are led by the spirit of god they are
[2:28:23] the sons of god
[2:28:25] for you have not received the spirit of
[2:28:27] bondage again
[2:28:28] [Music]
[2:28:29] this ought to be quoted in every message
[2:28:31] pulpit we have not received the spirit
[2:28:34] of bondage
[2:28:36] again to fear
[2:28:39] oh if you don't do what i say you'll
[2:28:41] you'll go to hell you'll miss the
[2:28:43] rapture if you you don't obey me you're
[2:28:45] not in the church
[2:28:46] amen we have not received the spirit of
[2:28:49] bondage again to fear but we have
[2:28:51] received a spirit of adoption
[2:28:55] whereby we cry at the father we
[2:28:58] recognize and we know we have come from
[2:29:02] god
[2:29:04] amen and that heals our father and we
[2:29:07] recognize ourselves as his sons
[2:29:11] but not only that the spirit itself
[2:29:15] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[2:29:18] our spirit that we are the children of
[2:29:21] god and if we are children oh hallelujah
[2:29:24] if we are children somebody get with me
[2:29:27] now if we are children that we're heirs
[2:29:30] and we're here to god and join us with
[2:29:32] christ and if be we suffer with him we
[2:29:35] might be glorified together
[2:29:38] i hear this prophet say oh brother you
[2:29:41] that are born again are sons and
[2:29:44] daughters of god co-equal with jesus
[2:29:46] christ
[2:29:47] in his presence oh my that makes the
[2:29:49] devil angry is to let the church realize
[2:29:52] who they are
[2:29:53] let me read it again if it makes the
[2:29:55] devil mad amen you that are born again
[2:29:59] sons and daughters of god are co-equal
[2:30:02] with jesus christ in his presence that's
[2:30:05] what makes the devil angry is to let the
[2:30:08] church know who they are
[2:30:11] hallelujah bride the people who are
[2:30:14] missed jesus christ bone of his bone
[2:30:17] flesh of his flesh life of his life
[2:30:20] there is representation upon the earth
[2:30:23] now we are adopted sons
[2:30:26] not going to be
[2:30:28] we are adopted
[2:30:29] by receiving the baptism of the holy
[2:30:31] ghost
[2:30:32] sure there's an adoption word to it is
[2:30:34] the change of our body but right now
[2:30:36] individually we have received it and as
[2:30:39] adopted sons i've got a message for you
[2:30:42] get out and fight
[2:30:46] what do you mean by adopted son once
[2:30:48] again let me say it
[2:30:50] adopted satan don't mean god goes out
[2:30:52] and adopts the devil's children it means
[2:30:54] that sons who are his by predestination
[2:30:58] have received power and authority to act
[2:31:00] in their father's name
[2:31:02] as his sons and a rule and taken
[2:31:06] dominion
[2:31:07] in his kingdom
[2:31:10] hallelujah that's what the opening of
[2:31:12] the seals does it makes us unto our god
[2:31:15] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[2:31:18] the earth
[2:31:21] sonship is not future it is now now
[2:31:26] we are the sons of god
[2:31:28] and as sons we have checkbook authority
[2:31:32] hallelujah oh it's war you know the
[2:31:35] first thing jesus began to do is is
[2:31:37] declare war on the devil
[2:31:40] tearing his kingdom down
[2:31:42] that's the first thing jesus did
[2:31:44] amen brother branham said in greatest
[2:31:47] battle satan's army brings diseases and
[2:31:50] god's army is commissioned to cast him
[2:31:53] out
[2:31:54] there you are every time satan throws
[2:31:57] anything into you god's army is to cast
[2:31:59] him out
[2:32:00] a lot of this fiery dart says hey if you
[2:32:03] get this fiery dart you're not a son of
[2:32:05] god throw it back at him and say i am a
[2:32:08] son of god i know in whom i have
[2:32:10] believed i had the experience i've got
[2:32:13] the experience here it goes devil back
[2:32:16] in your face amen the word of god
[2:32:19] declared me i am a son of god
[2:32:24] cast out
[2:32:25] that is the very tactic god used
[2:32:29] satan used the army of destruction to
[2:32:31] disbelieve god's word so now satan's
[2:32:34] going to come along and try to make you
[2:32:36] believe you didn't get nothing
[2:32:40] but that's when you ought to shout back
[2:32:43] i know in whom i have believed
[2:32:46] and i am persuaded he's he's able
[2:32:49] to keep that which i committed to him
[2:32:53] that soul i committed to him against
[2:32:55] that day
[2:32:57] amen cast out reasoning
[2:33:00] cast down diseases cast down sin you're
[2:33:03] above it resurrected in christ jesus
[2:33:06] setting in heavenly places with every
[2:33:09] devil under your foot
[2:33:12] amen daniel resisted
[2:33:15] the angel resisted
[2:33:17] there was war in heaven daniel
[2:33:20] persevered
[2:33:22] daniel wouldn't give up
[2:33:25] come on
[2:33:26] and i and there was war in heavens as
[2:33:28] revelation was coming to the prophet
[2:33:31] daniel give me just a little more
[2:33:33] but michael stood up on the behalf of
[2:33:36] god's people
[2:33:38] amen and remember
[2:33:40] he prevails not
[2:33:42] neither is this place found in heaven
[2:33:45] amen this is a rapture for the casting
[2:33:48] down of satan the bride goes up
[2:33:51] the last thing you're going to do
[2:33:54] before you leave here is pull the devil
[2:33:57] out of heavenly places and take that
[2:33:59] place
[2:34:05] that's your last job
[2:34:08] amen and hear the raptured saints in
[2:34:11] heaven and i heard a loud voice in

[2:34:17] voice in heaven now is come salvation
[2:34:20] and strength in the kingdom of our god
[2:34:22] and the power of his christ for the
[2:34:24] accuser of our brethren is cast down
[2:34:26] which accuse him before our god day and
[2:34:29] night and they overcame him
[2:34:31] by the blood i thought this was angels
[2:34:33] no this ain't angels
[2:34:36] this is sons of god amen blood was not
[2:34:39] shed for angels
[2:34:41] blood was shed for sons of god and they
[2:34:44] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[2:34:46] and by confessing what the word said and
[2:34:49] they love not their lives unto the death
[2:34:53] therefore rejoice you heavens and you
[2:34:55] that dwell in them but woe to the
[2:34:57] inhabiters of the earth for the devil
[2:34:58] has come to you he has great wrath he
[2:35:00] has three and a half years left
[2:35:03] so how do you overcome
[2:35:05] how do you win this battle
[2:35:08] by the blood life that was in christ is
[2:35:10] in you
[2:35:11] the same holy spirit the same power
[2:35:14] that's the threefold purpose of god
[2:35:16] that's the inspiration i'm talking about
[2:35:18] that's what god was in christ christ is
[2:35:21] now manifested in you taking us back to
[2:35:24] eden
[2:35:25] and yes michael has stood up he's going
[2:35:27] to defeat every devil but guess what
[2:35:29] he's going to use your body to do it
[2:35:34] amen
[2:35:36] amen he's going to use your body to do
[2:35:38] it
[2:35:39] you know when sister karen was so sick
[2:35:42] there was a somebody who's a preacher
[2:35:43] said to me we're praying for you brother
[2:35:45] tim
[2:35:46] through this trial i said thank you
[2:35:48] we need jesus
[2:35:50] i said we need jesus men
[2:35:53] that is
[2:35:55] men who know they are his corporal body
[2:35:58] and the hands he can use
[2:36:01] that's what we need
[2:36:03] we need men we need jesus
[2:36:08] jesus man that is
[2:36:10] men who know their god
[2:36:13] amen men who are know they are his
[2:36:17] corporal body and the hands that he can
[2:36:21] use
[2:36:23] hallelujah
[2:36:25] let me just share a couple little quotes
[2:36:27] with you and then we'll bring it down
[2:36:29] everybody knows how we do here
[2:36:31] we combine two services into one so
[2:36:33] you're not coming back tonight
[2:36:38] unless somebody else is preaching
[2:36:40] because i'm one and done
[2:36:43] now if the bible said in hebrews 13 8
[2:36:46] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[2:36:48] and forever that's the truth or it's not
[2:36:50] the truth
[2:36:51] if jesus christ is the same yesterday
[2:36:53] today and forever he has to be the same
[2:36:56] in principle
[2:36:57] the same in power the same in compassion
[2:37:00] the same christ or he's not the same
[2:37:02] correct and if he's the same and
[2:37:05] promised the same things that he did
[2:37:07] there back there in his literal body he
[2:37:09] would do here in his corporal body of
[2:37:12] his believers these signs shall follow
[2:37:14] them that believe
[2:37:16] the words that i do so you do also for i
[2:37:19] go to the father a little while the
[2:37:20] world won't see me no more yet you will
[2:37:22] see me i'll be with you even in you
[2:37:25] to the end of the world those are the
[2:37:27] promises
[2:37:28] door to the heart if he's the same he's
[2:37:31] got to be the same in principle
[2:37:34] the same in word
[2:37:35] the same in action the only thing he
[2:37:39] isn't the same in and that's his
[2:37:41] corporal body because he's in your body
[2:37:47] queen of sheba and now if it's the same
[2:37:50] yesterday today and forever he's got to
[2:37:52] be the same in principle the same in
[2:37:54] power the same in manifestation only
[2:37:57] thing is a corporal body his body is at
[2:38:00] the right hand of god the father in the
[2:38:02] heaven sitting on the throne you believe
[2:38:04] that a high priest and his holy spirit
[2:38:06] is here which the spirit was upon christ
[2:38:09] which is god in human flesh your flesh
[2:38:12] my flesh as the blood cleanses us he
[2:38:15] preaches the gospel through the preacher
[2:38:17] prophesies through the prophet reveals
[2:38:20] the secret hearts speaks through tongues
[2:38:23] interprets tongues and everything's set
[2:38:26] in an order you believe that
[2:38:29] that's only three of many
[2:38:31] so he's in your body
[2:38:35] he's taking on your flesh
[2:38:38] he's gonna whip the devil
[2:38:41] but he's going to use your body to do it
[2:38:46] now if michael's fighting then you're
[2:38:48] fighting
[2:38:49] resisting turns
[2:38:51] is
[2:38:52] his kingdom down
[2:38:54] you overcome him by the blood life
[2:38:57] of the lamb
[2:38:58] now many people think of only the
[2:39:00] bloodshed at cro at calvary on the cross
[2:39:03] and and if we're
[2:39:06] and that's true if we're only talking
[2:39:07] about the chemistry of the blood that
[2:39:09] actual
[2:39:10] substance
[2:39:11] but no we're talking about the life the
[2:39:14] spirit

[2:39:23] a blood cell
[2:39:25] built a body around it it was born in

[2:39:41] body
