[Music] Are you past the point of weary? Is your burden weighing heavy? Is it all too much to carry? Let me tell you about my Jesus. Do you feel that empty feeling? Cuz shame's done all the stealing and you're desperate for some healing. Let me tell you about my Jesus home. He makes a way with rainbow way. Rises up from an empty grave. Ain't no sinner that he can save. Let me tell you about my Jesus. His love is strong and his grace is free. And the good news is I know that he can do for you what he does for me. Let me tell you about my Jesus. And let my Jesus save your life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Broken life away from broken dreams to wasted years until the past disappear. Oh, let me tell you about my Jesus. in all the wrong turns that you would go and undo if you could. But who can work it all for your good? Let me tell you about my Jesus. He makes a way where there ain't no way. Rises up from an empty grave. Ain't no sinner that he can't save. Let me tell you about my Jesus. His love is strong and his grace is free. And the good news is I know that he do for you what he's done for me. Let me tell you about my Jesus. Let my Jesus take your life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Who would take my cross to Calvary? Pay the price for all my guilty. Who would care that much about me? Let me tell you about my Jesus. Oh, he makes a way where there's no way. Rises up from grave. Ain't no sinner that he can save. Let me tell you about my Jesus. His love is strong and his praise is free and the good news. I know that he did for you what he done for me. Let me tell you about my Jesus. My Jesus came. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. [Music] [Applause]
