[0:05] well hello everybody
[0:07] it's great to have you with us we are
[0:09] the ministry team of eaten in like
[0:11] tabernacle and we hope that you will
[0:15] invite friends to join with us today and
[0:18] let everybody know that we're we're on
[0:21] for another session tonight or today
[0:24] whatever time it would be as you're
[0:27] listening and so we welcome you to even
[0:33] ask questions by email or two if you
[0:38] something comes in your mind of your
[0:40] heart that you would kind of like to
[0:42] know more about this subject please do
[0:44] so let us know even by email or other
[0:48] ways to contact us where today we have
[0:53] been speaking in past sessions about the
[0:56] birth of the church and today we're
[1:00] going to be talking about the closing of
[1:03] the Gentile dispensation and the events
[1:06] that led up to the closing of the I'm
[1:12] sorry the Jewish dispensation and the
[1:14] closing of that and the Old Testament
[1:16] and bringing in a new covenant and so if
[1:21] this was a time period of course when
[1:25] there was a changing of dispensation a
[1:29] junction and we feel like that the
[1:32] ending of the Jewish dispensation is
[1:35] parallel to the ending of the Gentile
[1:39] dispensation so I think it's a great
[1:41] study how would you define dispensation
[1:44] brother Tim how would you well
[1:47] dispensation by definition is a divinely
[1:50] ordained the order prevailing at a
[1:53] particular period of time so for example
[1:57] the law was a dispensation that would
[2:02] cover a particular period of history
[2:05] where that God would use a nation
[2:09] to demonstrate what he would do in a new
[2:15] covenant when he would take a people for
[2:18] his namesake
[2:19] and so you know it's a dispensation a
[2:23] divinely ordained order prevailing at a
[2:26] particular period of history
[2:27] I see so there were there were times of
[2:30] judges
[2:31] there were times of kings there were
[2:33] times of the prophets the times of the
[2:36] law and these are times where God would
[2:39] do specific things down through the ages
[2:42] in specific ways for instance the law
[2:45] he's he's bringing something to Israel
[2:48] that is to the nation of Israel he built
[2:51] Israel then he brought them a law and
[2:53] then he's going to build this nation
[2:55] upon this law is this something that he
[2:57] is doing and under the umbrella of the
[3:00] dispensation of the law came the judges
[3:04] the Kings the prophets and so that were
[3:07] as it were many aspects of this
[3:11] dispensation and so you will find the
[3:15] same thing that happens similar in the
[3:17] Gentiles for example going from
[3:19] justification which would be a
[3:22] dispensation of a revelation divine
[3:26] order of knowing your sins are forgiven
[3:30] and a message come in as it did with
[3:33] Luther and then Wesley come in with
[3:35] sanctification and then on into
[3:38] [Music]
[3:39] Pentecost in the fulfillment right down
[3:42] to the rapture time you mentioned the
[3:44] judges and the prophets and the
[3:46] difference that but but never had there
[3:48] come a junction like this
[3:50] never had it come such a major turn a
[3:53] major event and you find in that time
[3:55] you mentioned how we feel like it
[3:57] parallels today and you see the troubles
[4:00] in the world today and you see the
[4:01] things going on around as a governments
[4:03] in turmoil and in every and there's just
[4:06] chaos in the world and if you look
[4:07] historically at that time period right
[4:10] there as Jesus is about to come on the
[4:13] scene you see the exact same thing in
[4:15] the world of that time with the Roman
[4:18] question the rebellions going on and
[4:20] historically it was a very time' it was
[4:24] an uproar
[4:24] everything was in chaos and you always
[4:26] see that happens at the time of a major
[4:29] event when God's about to do something
[4:31] Satan's tries to stir things up and
[4:35] there is there something that we can
[4:37] look and see like a sign of a change of
[4:39] a dispensation I mean I know we went you
[4:42] know from the law to what Jesus brought
[4:44] us to but like an angel or a pillar of
[4:47] fire or well I think always at a change
[4:51] of dispensation there's always a display
[4:55] of the supernatural I think it's very
[4:57] interesting from from Malachi the
[5:00] last prophet of the Old Testament to
[5:02] John the Baptist's which of course would
[5:07] come in the days of Jesus there was
[5:09] hardly anything that is recorded that
[5:12] God spoke during that period of years
[5:14] which perhaps was 500 or more years and
[5:18] so yet then all of a sudden an angel
[5:23] starts appearing first to Zechariah and
[5:26] then to Mary and then to Joseph in a
[5:29] dream and then the Shepherd's and then
[5:31] the wise men and then it's basically
[5:33] nothing that will happen for thirty
[5:36] years except for a tiny glimpse of Jesus
[5:41] life at the age of 12 when he was at the
[5:44] temple and then then there comes John
[5:47] the Baptist's out of the wilderness and
[5:49] then for a space of three and a half
[5:51] years more or less hundreds hundreds
[5:55] literally hundreds of scriptures or
[5:57] suddenly and rapidly fulfill wonderful
[6:00] but before that happened before you hit
[6:02] that I like how you said you know
[6:04] suddenly an angel appears so it wasn't
[6:06] that these things happen without any
[6:08] type of warning or without any type of
[6:10] warning may not be the right word but
[6:12] the angel came and that and let them
[6:14] know that something's about to take
[6:16] there's a turning of the corner they're
[6:18] not changing now God is moving you know
[6:20] brother Tim it's the similar in
[6:23] in the days of Moses because there was
[6:27] 400 years where the children of Israel
[6:30] was in bondage
[6:31] there was no miracle but the moment God
[6:34] was going to deliver them and change
[6:35] that dispensation an angel appeared on
[6:37] the scene and the miraculous began to
[6:39] happen and God began to speak and it was
[6:42] same with the 400 years of silence from
[6:44] the time of Malachi to the time of John
[6:47] the Baptist
[6:48] there was a changing of dispensation you
[6:51] can always expect the supernatural
[6:53] element to begin to work when something
[6:56] like this is about to take place yes and
[6:58] I think this is why today is a day of
[7:00] great miracles not days of miracles are
[7:02] past but days of mirrors are are
[7:04] prevalent and looking forward to and
[7:07] preparing for the greatest miracle which
[7:10] will be the change of our bodies the
[7:13] resurrection of the saints and and the
[7:16] glorious rapture they service the
[7:18] meeting in the air praise the Lord so
[7:22] the dispensation that took place at the
[7:24] closing of the Old Testament at the
[7:26] closing of the Jewish dispensation what
[7:31] were the changes that took place there
[7:33] there was a law an Old Covenant we moved
[7:38] to the New Covenant there was an old
[7:40] Lamb sacrificial lamb and imperfect lamb
[7:43] and it was fulfilled in the new in
[7:47] Christ what are what are some of the
[7:51] aspects of that change that we could
[7:53] visibly see there was a major corner
[7:55] turned there yeah it was it was very
[7:58] huge because actually as Aaron was
[8:01] asking you know well you know what
[8:04] things with was had happened or not just
[8:09] an angel appearing all of a sudden but
[8:11] no there had been years and years and
[8:13] years of prophecy and now there's layin
[8:16] in the Bible all of these prophecies
[8:19] like seeds waiting for the right
[8:22] atmosphere and the right season to come
[8:25] Poland for example um
[8:28] I would speak of an elijah prophet that
[8:32] would come to forerun the coming of the
[8:36] Messiah
[8:37] yes and it would like dormant in the
[8:39] scripture until all of a sudden light
[8:41] would shine right on that scripture and
[8:43] quicken that word for that moment so
[8:46] there were yes there was many many many
[8:48] prophecies laying there in the scripture
[8:51] that just needed to be ignited by the by
[8:57] the fire of God and and from there it
[9:01] was an explosion a little explosion of
[9:04] many many many scriptures fulfilled
[9:08] well even Isaiah when he said a virgin
[9:10] shall could say that was seven hundred
[9:12] years yes before and it just laid there
[9:14] you know just because it had laid there
[9:16] for hundreds of years
[9:18] that word was just waiting for the
[9:20] predestinated moment you know for a
[9:22] predestinated woman Mary for that that
[9:25] virgin to come on the scene and when the
[9:27] time came it was ready to take place and
[9:29] sometimes I think we get people get
[9:32] lulled to sleep Bible what's happening
[9:34] what's happening and it can all happen
[9:35] like that
[9:36] absolutely when the moment hits it's
[9:38] gonna just boom boom boom boom yeah it's
[9:40] going you know very quickly and rapidly
[9:41] like you said to went 400 years without
[9:44] seemingly anything happening Sammy back
[9:47] in Moses 400 years slaves yes and all of
[9:50] a sudden only Manhattan and it's just
[9:53] one thing after another being fulfilled
[9:55] and it was an exodus you know that took
[9:58] place in Moses as a day the exes it took
[10:01] place in Jesus wonder day and there's an
[10:02] exodus in this day so we we should also
[10:05] look and say hey maybe it seems like
[10:09] nothing's happening but things are
[10:10] happening past yeah there is actually in
[10:12] our day another explosion squadron
[10:15] taking place that has taken place where
[10:17] that light is coming up different
[10:19] promises of the word and so you know
[10:21] this is why you would say in Ephesians
[10:24] 1:10 that in the dispensation of the
[10:27] fullness of time so we come to a new
[10:30] dispensation and even in our day we're
[10:33] times have come to us for filming so we
[10:36] come to
[10:37] times of the Gentiles where that it is
[10:39] fulfilled the times of the church ages
[10:41] where they are coming to in the end you
[10:45] know the dispensation of grace actually
[10:48] will come down to its inward that he
[10:51] that has filled his filthy steel he that
[10:53] is holy is holy stream he that is
[10:55] righteous his righteous still so you
[10:57] know it comes down to a closing time and
[11:01] we are at a very pivotal time in world's
[11:06] history right now hey man you know I
[11:09] believe a lot of it has to do with the
[11:11] expectation of the people you find
[11:13] people in that era selling Moses the
[11:16] people were under that persecution and
[11:18] under their judgment for 400 years they
[11:21] knew there was a promise given to
[11:22] Abraham that your seeds gonna sojourn in
[11:24] a strange land so there has to be an
[11:26] expectation I'm gonna deliver even
[11:29] though I've seen you there and then you
[11:31] find even in John the Baptist when they
[11:33] came on the scene there was there was
[11:34] the word that was prophesied Isaiah a
[11:37] virgin sound shall conceive where was
[11:39] the expectation Mary didn't falter with
[11:42] the expectation she knew it was in the
[11:44] scripture being unto me what about us in
[11:46] this day that we see so much around us
[11:49] the time still types the same we find
[11:52] ourselves in a very dark hour but yet
[11:55] what is the expectation of the people
[11:56] there's a promise rapture that's right
[11:58] right talk about a dispensation of
[12:00] change what is the expectation of the
[12:02] church to receive that promise word yeah
[12:04] I mean we should be like Mary be it unto
[12:06] me according to that somebody's gonna
[12:08] fit the scripture yeah yet at the same
[12:11] time that there was an expectation among
[12:14] some because God always has somebody
[12:17] that's a witness exactly somebody that's
[12:20] gonna stand for right here isn't truth
[12:21] and have that holy expectation yeah but
[12:25] at the same time the you know at this
[12:29] dispensation and even with in the time
[12:33] of Moses there was a time of lukewarm
[12:35] exact
[12:36] where that in complacency were that the
[12:39] majority of Israel was was not under
[12:43] this expected even though they were
[12:45] groaning and travailing and yes desiring
[12:49] and hoping but yet there was still a
[12:52] luke oneness and and there was a man by
[12:55] the name of amram that began to cry out
[12:58] together yeah exactly
[13:00] you know far a delivery man and and so
[13:03] it would be to that family that would be
[13:06] born a messiah as it was you know a
[13:10] savior as it was a redeemer which a
[13:14] deliverer is is the better word and so
[13:17] you know this would this would give rise
[13:20] but I want you to notice that would come
[13:23] a time of after a silence that would
[13:26] become a time of of Great Awakening and
[13:29] then a little time of silence and then
[13:31] another time of awakening right even
[13:34] within the fulfillment yes yeah and so I
[13:37] think we should never let down on our
[13:39] guards they're good you know to to
[13:44] realize just because that we may go
[13:46] through a little small law in between
[13:50] the Moving's of God don't give up on the
[13:54] promise I'm saying exactly man yes I
[13:56] mean there was a law in the time of
[13:57] Moses from the time his birth so a great
[14:00] expectation and and then you know he
[14:02] rises up and you can imagine as they
[14:06] would talk about human what was going to
[14:08] happen in that time is you know here he
[14:11] is being trained by the Egyptians that
[14:14] you know you can imagine the excitement
[14:16] there's people were looking at that and
[14:18] then see it seem like all fall apart
[14:20] right that's right only forgot to pick
[14:23] it up again that is very when he's 80
[14:25] years old and meet him was a pillar of
[14:27] fire and send him out hmm
[14:28] and so um the same thing would be here
[14:32] in and this God which God would appear
[14:35] by an angel to Zechariah and then then
[14:39] the to the Virgin Mary and then there
[14:42] would be that loll of years right the
[14:44] space of time would seem like nothing
[14:47] was
[14:47] until all of a sudden here comes John
[14:50] out you know preaching repentance and
[14:53] preparing the way for the coming of
[14:55] Messiah
[14:56] so just because there's ups and downs
[14:58] and laws and times of quietness and seem
[15:02] like we're godless silent
[15:03] does not mean at all gone silent God is
[15:06] right
[15:07] all the while and the thing is the
[15:09] people didn't see John we don't see what
[15:11] was going on with John but God was
[15:13] dealing with him the whole time
[15:14] preparing him yes right preparing him
[15:17] with the message to come out you know
[15:19] the way to prepare the way it to be a
[15:22] forerunner and let me ask for people
[15:25] listen we're talking about the end of a
[15:27] dispensation do we place it at a
[15:29] specific moment is there it ended as
[15:33] there at what moment does it begin to
[15:35] turn is it a gradual blinding tour to
[15:38] where the Jews begin you know was it
[15:41] like a moment we're okay no longer the
[15:43] Jews that they can't see the truth is it
[15:46] is it a moment or is it a gradual thing
[15:47] that took place no but was more gradual
[15:49] don't you think I believe it was gradual
[15:52] and it was on many levels
[15:54] politically religious spiritually on
[15:59] many levels as we see the first coming
[16:02] this is how we pick up for the second
[16:05] there's no record in the Bible that said
[16:10] that the first coming would be a mystery
[16:12] right but there is that the second will
[16:15] be the he'll come in this the thief in
[16:17] the night and if they missed it in the
[16:19] first they're certainly going to be
[16:21] people missed it in a second but the the
[16:25] first coming sets the stage to give us a
[16:28] pattern and we want if we study the
[16:32] political world as it was spoke of us in
[16:35] Daniel we see the religious theater as
[16:41] it were the stage that was set when
[16:44] Jesus arrived Jesus says it will repeat
[16:47] again and so I believe it was gradual
[16:50] and I believe that it was on many fronts
[16:52] that God had set the stage for this
[16:54] deliverer I guess a lot of the time or
[16:57] even most of time the religious people
[16:59] though were blah
[17:00] did not their own traditions buy their
[17:03] own histories because it's not that they
[17:05] couldn't see it all but Nicodemus come
[17:07] to says we know that that you're a
[17:10] teacher sent from God so they could see
[17:12] that yeah so they weren't completely
[17:14] blinded there was something that would
[17:15] not allow them to accept the fullness of
[17:18] that truth yes and was that is that
[17:20] their own teachings and their own
[17:21] stubbornness and their own traditions
[17:23] you know of their churches that was
[17:25] keeping them from accepting that Jesus
[17:28] said you by your tradition make the Word
[17:30] of God of none effect when they exalted
[17:33] the men's traditions over God's Word
[17:35] they were on their way out well you know
[17:39] we're living at another time in another
[17:41] junction of time and this is a time war
[17:44] that men's traditions are being have
[17:49] been given preeminence over God's Word
[17:51] and just like the Jews in that time took
[17:56] the oral traditions that was taught by
[17:59] the rabbis over the literal and written
[18:02] word of God even so today there has been
[18:06] many many traditions that have been set
[18:09] by the people and by theologians that
[18:13] men actually believe in more than they
[18:17] do the Word of God the written word of
[18:20] God and so again it always goes back to
[18:23] my church said this is what my church
[18:26] believes instead of what the Bible says
[18:28] but I believe it as the church returns
[18:31] back to the gospel again that there will
[18:35] be a people that will rise that will
[18:37] give the Word of God the proper place
[18:39] the headship and the preeminence in the
[18:43] church and god bless you folks we're so
