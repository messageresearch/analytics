[22:00] Amen. Is that your desire this morning

[22:06] Amen. to come and meet your needs this
[22:08] morning? Want to have a we have have a
[22:10] few prayer requests. Want to remember uh
[22:13] Sister Linda Butts in prayer. She's
[22:15] having extreme pain in her shoulder.
[22:19] Remember brother James Hollis having
[22:21] cataract surgery on Wednesday. As for
[22:23] prayer also uh Sister Felicia Liddell's
[22:27] dad is sick, very sick in the hospital.
[22:31] They're with him this morning. Remember
[22:33] them today. Also want to pray for sister
[22:36] Loretta. She's home from the hospital
[22:37] but still needs help getting around.
[22:40] Needs complete healing. So just ask the
[22:42] Lord to touch her. Also remember the Joe
[22:45] Adams is the way preaching this today.
[22:48] And so ask the Lord to be in her service
[22:51] and to minister the needs there. Ask
[22:53] brother Aaron if he'd come and pray over
[22:55] these prayer requests. Let's just pray
[22:57] together for these needs.
[23:02] Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[23:05] Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[23:07] just enter into your presence this
[23:09] morning humbly.
[23:11] Lord, recognizing today, Lord, that your
[23:13] word cannot fail and that your word
[23:15] promised that you would be here in our
[23:16] midst, Lord. You said that where two or
[23:19] three gather, you would be there. And
[23:20] we're coming today trusting that, Lord.
[23:23] And we can trust that. We can trust
[23:24] every part of your word, Lord. Your word
[23:26] said you'd never leave us or forsake us.
[23:29] Your word, Lord, said that you were the
[23:31] healer. By your stripes, we are healed.
[23:33] It says that you are the same yesterday,
[23:35] today, and forever. Lord, we praise you
[23:37] today, Lord, and we thank you and we
[23:39] stand upon that solid rock, Lord. As we
[23:41] heard our brother Timothy minister on
[23:43] Wednesday, it's a solid, sure
[23:45] foundation. It will not be shaken, Lord.
[23:48] So, we just thank you today that we have
[23:50] that rock to stand upon, Lord. We read
[23:52] in the scripture where the rock followed
[23:54] them in the wilderness. So it doesn't
[23:55] matter what situation we're in, how dark
[23:58] our day is, how dismal it is, and Lord,
[24:00] how dry it may seem. There's water and
[24:03] the rock is right there with us today.
[24:05] And we just want to say thank you, Lord.
[24:06] We've come to praise your name and lift
[24:08] you up, Lord. Cuz yours truly is the
[24:10] name above all names. It's the only name
[24:12] that deserves worship and praise and
[24:14] glory and honor, Lord. I pray today as
[24:17] we lift up your name that it'll please
[24:19] you, Lord, and that your spirit will
[24:20] just begin to move in this place. It'll
[24:22] deal with hearts and deal with lives,
[24:24] Lord. Lord, regardless of where we find
[24:26] ourselves today, every one of us need
[24:28] more of you. Every one of us need a
[24:30] refilling of the spirit. Every one of us
[24:32] need to draw closer. So our prayer
[24:34] today, Lord, is draw us closer to you
[24:36] today, Lord. Lord, that we can truly
[24:38] fulfill your will in our lives, Lord,
[24:40] and lay aside our ideas and our
[24:42] stubbornness and just come subject to
[24:44] you today, Father. Lord, you saw every
[24:47] need and heard everyone read across this
[24:48] desk, Sister Loretta and Sister
[24:50] Felicia's dad. And Lord, I just pray
[24:52] that you'll heal her sister and and
[24:54] touch Sister Felicia's father and sister
[24:57] Linda Buts and the pain she's in. Lord,
[24:59] Lord, you knew each one and you died on
[25:01] Calvary and took stripes, Lord. Lord,
[25:03] for our healing, Lord, our salvation,
[25:06] Lord, for all of it. And we come and
[25:07] just, Lord, ask you to move and be with
[25:09] our our brother Hollis, Lord, as he has
[25:12] this surgery and see him through it,
[25:14] Lord. Lord, I pray, Lord, every other
[25:16] need gathered here today. Lord, I know
[25:18] deep in the heart of of these men and
[25:20] women, there's there's needs, there's
[25:21] situations, and Father, I'm just asking
[25:23] that you minister to them today. Speak
[25:26] directly today by your word so there be
[25:28] no question, no doubt, Lord, that it's
[25:30] you moving on their behalf. Lord, we
[25:32] commit this time to you. I just ask that
[25:34] Lord, you'll anoint our brother Tim to
[25:36] speak today that he can step aside and
[25:38] allow the Holy Spirit to use him. Lord,
[25:40] I pray you'll anoint every one of us.
[25:42] Lord, may we Lord, get give worship
[25:45] today from an anointed life and a filled
[25:47] heart and a heart that recognizes, Lord,
[25:49] how much we have to be thankful for
[25:52] because you have been so good to us,
[25:53] Father. And we just want to say thank
[25:55] you. We love you. We invite you into
[25:57] this service now. Lord, we ask you to
[25:59] have your way in this service and and
[26:01] there with brother Joe where he's
[26:02] ministering. May you have your way there
[26:04] as well. Use him in a mighty way.
[26:06] Father, we look to you now. We ask you
[26:08] to move and that you alone receive glory
[26:11] today from this service. In Jesus name
[26:13] we pray. Amen.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you turn around, shake one
[26:19] of his hand, welcome each other to the

[33:44] against me, you will always hear me say,
[33:49] "That's no heel for a climber. It's no
[33:53] battle for a child of God. Satan's
[33:56] already been defeated and the victoryy's
[33:59] been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary
[34:03] when he died for you and me. So now
[34:06] Satan, get behind me. For I claim the
[34:10] victory.
[34:13] Every time I try to do a little
[34:16] something for the Lord,
[34:19] Satan tries to block my path and keep me
[34:22] from my goals.
[34:24] But I don't care how high the heels seem
[34:27] to be today. I'll take my Savior by the
[34:31] hand and he'll help me when I say,
[34:35] "Oh, that's no heel for a climb. No
[34:39] battle for a child of God. Satan's
[34:42] already been defeated and the victories
[34:45] been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary
[34:49] when he died for you and me. So now
[34:53] Satan, get behind me for I claim the
[34:56] victory.
[34:59] And that's no heel for a climber. It's
[35:02] no battle for a child of God. Satan's
[35:05] already been defeated and the victory's
[35:08] been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary
[35:12] when he died for you and me. So now
[35:16] Satan, get behind me for I claim the
[35:19] victory.
[35:22] So now Satan, get behind me for I claim
[35:27] the victory.

[50:14] As we go to prayer this morning, I want
[50:17] all the young people that are going to
[50:19] be going to Ohio camp and they got
[50:22] meetings there coming up this weekend to
[50:25] be traveling. We didn't get a wasn't
[50:28] able to get a bus this year for them all
[50:30] to go in. So, they're going
[50:32] individually. I want you to step out of
[50:33] your seat. Won't you stand right up here
[50:35] in the front and let me pray with you?
[50:38] You won't be here Wednesday night and so
[50:41] we'll just have a moment of prayer.
[50:43] We're very proud of our young people,
[50:45] those of you that are going, those that
[50:47] can't go. And I know there's some of you
[50:50] that will not be able to go, but you
[50:54] know, the Lord will provide and be with
[50:57] you and every step of the way. I believe
[51:00] these meetings will be lifechanging for
[51:03] many and uh bring deliverance,
[51:07] salvation, and a closer walk with God.
[51:11] Amen. So that is the whole motive for
[51:14] meetings like this that we might draw
[51:16] nearer to the Lord. So let's pray.
[51:18] Father, in the name of Jesus, we want to
[51:21] say thank you for your blessings to us.
[51:24] We want to say thank you for this
[51:25] service, for this time of of worship
[51:29] where we can come and praise the name of
[51:32] our creator and savior where you left
[51:36] all of glory and became one of us, Lord,
[51:40] and paid the price of redemption. Thank
[51:43] you, Lord. Thank you for these young
[51:45] people that you've entrusted us with.
[51:48] Those that are here that, oh God, that
[51:50] will remain here. those that will be
[51:52] able to travel. Lord, I I pray that
[51:54] you'll be with those on their journey.
[51:57] May your hand of grace be upon them. I
[52:00] ask for the power of the Holy Spirit to
[52:02] move in the meetings ahead. Lord, not
[52:05] only there, but here at home and let
[52:08] your Holy Spirit just reign supreme for
[52:10] every need. And oh God, let our young
[52:13] people here be a light and a testimony
[52:15] to others and show forth the evening
[52:18] light as we love you and we give you
[52:20] praise and glory in Jesus' name. Thank
[52:24] you now for the word today. I pray that
[52:26] you'll bless it to our hearts and you
[52:29] anoint it to our lives. We pray in
[52:32] Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[52:36] It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[52:38] today. We pray God's blessings upon each
[52:41] one of you and it's a very special way
[52:43] and he'll speak to you and in a very
[52:47] real and living way today and manifest
[52:50] his glory in your life. Amen. And as you
[52:54] remain standing now for the reading of
[52:56] the word, we want to just um read a
[52:59] couple of scriptures. First of all,
[53:02] we're going to be speaking today. Um if
[53:05] you can get my my um keynote up. Today
[53:10] we're going to be speaking on um the
[53:13] mountain movers. We're here in the age
[53:15] of Leoda. It is the bride age.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; It is the age where the true church
[53:21] would return to being the bride she was
[53:25] at Pentecost. And we're not speaking of
[53:27] Isuza Street there. We're talking about
[53:30] the original Pentecost. Amen. And so we
[53:34] um as we are looking at that, we're
[53:37] going to be speaking on our theme that
[53:39] we've been on on the mountain movers.
[53:42] We're in Zechariah 4:7. It says, "Who
[53:45] art thou, oh great mountain? Thou shalt
[53:48] become a plain, and the headstone shall
[53:50] be brought forth with shoutings, crying,
[53:54] grace, grace unto it." and and I believe
[53:56] we're in the days of the great capstone,
[53:59] the coming of the Lord Jesus where we
[54:01] will meet him in the air. He'll cap off
[54:04] the church um and and finish it off. And
[54:08] I believe we're some of the finishing
[54:09] stones that are being added to to the
[54:13] building to the kingdom that he has. Now
[54:16] this morning we're going to be reading
[54:17] from Revelation chapter 3 and verse 18
[54:21] where he said I counsel thee to buy of
[54:24] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[54:26] mayest be rich and white raignment that
[54:29] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[54:31] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[54:33] anoint thine eyes with thyself that thou
[54:35] mayest see. As many as I love I rebuke
[54:39] and chasten. Be zealous therefore and
[54:42] repent. Behold, I stand at the door and
[54:45] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[54:48] the door, I will come into him and will
[54:52] s with him and he with me. To him that
[54:55] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[54:57] in my throne. Even as I also overcame,
[55:01] and am sat down with my father in his
[55:03] throne. He that hath an ear, let him
[55:06] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[55:10] churches. Amen. God bless you. You can
[55:12] be seated. May the Lord add his
[55:15] blessings to the reading of his word and
[55:17] here we are today and it's already
[55:20] August. God's blessed us with a couple
[55:22] of days of of cooler weather and we're
[55:25] thankful for that. We have a wonderful
[55:27] day ahead of us with a communion service
[55:30] to follow this and foot washing for
[55:32] those that will participate in this. Now
[55:36] we, you know, we um combined two
[55:38] services into one. So the service today
[55:41] will be a little longer uh and a little
[55:44] bit more lengthy than maybe some are
[55:47] accustomed to, but you know we do this
[55:50] um many travel in from different places.
[55:53] We have we have some folks right here
[55:55] that travel up three three and a half
[55:57] hours all the way from down in South
[56:00] Texas to be with us today and and here
[56:03] regularly. So, you know, they come a
[56:05] long ways and and um they expect to get
[56:08] a full meal while they're here. Amen.
[56:11] So, we appreciate the Wiggins family
[56:14] coming up and not only them but many
[56:16] others that are here that come in from
[56:18] different places. We're made up from all
[56:21] from Arkansas that drives in here all
[56:24] the way from you know, Bojer, Shreport,
[56:27] Homer, Mendon all the way down in
[56:30] different other parts of Louisiana. So
[56:32] we just want you just to enter in today
[56:34] and receive from the Lord. We have um
[56:38] you know something very special I want
[56:40] to make mention of. We have um today um
[56:44] another family has been added to the
[56:47] church and uh we have brother Joe and
[56:50] sister Stephanie Green that have moved
[56:52] here from Oklahoma and we want to
[56:54] welcome them to our assembly today and
[56:57] pray that God will bless them as they
[56:59] journey towards us toward the or with us
[57:01] toward the rapture. Amen. Will you stand
[57:03] brother Joe, sister Stephanie, so
[57:05] everybody can see you. Amen. We welcome
[57:07] you today in the name of the Lord.
[57:10] Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you.
[57:14] Amen. It's great to be in the house of
[57:16] the Lord. See the von Brontton's here
[57:18] all the way from Belgium still with us
[57:20] today. So, you know, I think they're
[57:23] plan on traveling on um from today, but
[57:25] they've been in the area for a week or
[57:27] so. And so, we're just been happy to to
[57:30] to have them have fellowship with them.
[57:32] We got to hear a little bit about their
[57:35] conversion and what God did and his
[57:37] glorious deliverance. And um we're you
[57:40] know part of it was climatic when
[57:43] brother Timothy was there ministering um
[57:46] in in the Belgium youth camp and he was
[57:48] there in those services and God
[57:51] gloriously saved him and delivered him
[57:54] from a life of of alcohol when their
[57:57] marriage was on the brink of of divorce
[58:00] and God rich in mercy turned their lives
[58:04] around. Now, if he'll do it for them,
[58:07] Amen. If you got loved ones out there,
[58:09] he'll do it for them, too.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; He's a God rich in mercy. Amen. And I'm
[58:14] glad to know that he's still saving.
[58:17] He's still delivering. And he's still
[58:19] setting people free.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, today as we go into the word,
[58:26] you know, I I you know, there are a lot
[58:28] of things as we minister and uh kind of
[58:32] feel led on our heart to do. And yet
[58:34] sometimes we kind of secondguess
[58:37] ourselves and and um you know uh maybe
[58:42] sometimes uh wonder why the Lord is
[58:45] leading us this way and and if it's
[58:48] really something that is pertinent and
[58:50] important because we just don't want to
[58:52] waste time. We want to really put um our
[58:57] efforts into these last few hours that
[58:59] we have. And um and so I I just received
[59:04] a a um an a text today, a WhatsApp t
[59:10] from from South Africa, one of the
[59:13] pastors there that has a little group
[59:16] there in South Africa and he was just um
[59:19] you know encouraging me today to bring
[59:22] these things forth. He said in last
[59:23] Sunday's service toward the end you made
[59:25] us write you made this remark and asked
[59:28] us to write it down. spiritual truths
[59:31] must never be used to cancel out literal
[59:35] promises.
[59:36] And he said, "This is still lingering
[59:38] with me because this is what we have
[59:41] been taught by ministers. It's caused us
[59:43] problems to live and to live below our
[59:47] God-given rights." And it was it's so
[59:49] profound and been such a liberating
[59:53] thought. And you know it's for reasons
[59:55] like this that we do this is is to take
[59:58] the chains off. Amen. To enlighten us to
[1:00:02] where we are and and encourage us to
[1:00:05] take our inheritance. Now I have read
[1:00:09] from this um um today where we read from
[1:00:14] Revelation chapter 3 concerning the
[1:00:17] Leodysian church. Now, we believe that
[1:00:21] this is more than just seven churches
[1:00:23] over in Asia, but this was symbolic as
[1:00:27] the book of Revelation is symbolic of um
[1:00:31] of of things that would happen in the
[1:00:33] end time. Now, God could not tell them,
[1:00:36] "It'll be 2,000 years or seven Gentile
[1:00:39] church ages before I come back because
[1:00:43] he had it in he had to to know that
[1:00:46] Satan would get a hold of that and would
[1:00:48] do great damage with it." So, he would
[1:00:51] do damage with it by causing every age
[1:00:54] to be um lazy and lethargic and and not
[1:00:59] uh ready for his coming. So he wanted
[1:01:02] every age, you know, fulfilling his
[1:01:05] words that Jesus said about his coming.
[1:01:08] Most common words he uses about the
[1:01:10] rapture is watch. So he wanted everybody
[1:01:14] on a state of watchfulness. Now if
[1:01:16] people go down prepared in their age,
[1:01:20] whether it be the Ephesians or the
[1:01:21] Smyrnian or Sardis or Philadelphiaian or
[1:01:24] or even here in the Leodysian age, if
[1:01:26] they go down ready, they're going to
[1:01:28] come up ready,
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; right? prepared to meet the Lord. And so
[1:01:33] this is uh very very important. Now, as
[1:01:36] we're speaking of that, I'm going to be
[1:01:39] titling this Leoa, the bride age. Now to
[1:01:44] some this is going to be incredulous
[1:01:47] because if had we read the whole message
[1:01:50] to this church age which we did last
[1:01:54] Sunday um that we would have read how
[1:01:58] that Christ was on the outside of the
[1:02:00] church. He wasn't even on the inside. He
[1:02:03] was already been pushed out by the
[1:02:06] religious systems and he was knocking on
[1:02:09] the doors and then he was given an
[1:02:11] invitation. If any man hear my voice and
[1:02:16] will open the door, I will come in and s
[1:02:18] with him and he with me. So it wasn't
[1:02:21] that mercy was over, but now God was now
[1:02:25] through with the denominational system.
[1:02:28] He would no longer send another revival
[1:02:31] to them. and and another reformation for
[1:02:34] them to go and continue on in organized
[1:02:38] religion. He would call out and pride a
[1:02:40] people for his name. And so when we look
[1:02:44] at this, you know, there that is
[1:02:46] described as wretched and miserable and
[1:02:49] poor and blind and naked. Now that would
[1:02:52] be the the spiritual condition of the
[1:02:56] church in the last age. And that's where
[1:03:00] we are is in the last age. And so you so
[1:03:04] to call this the bride age you you would
[1:03:08] question and say well then how could
[1:03:11] anyone call Leodysia that Christ
[1:03:15] rejecting lukewarm church the bride age
[1:03:20] and and because that is certainly not a
[1:03:23] description of the bride. The bride is
[1:03:25] without spot or wrinkle or blemish or
[1:03:28] any such thing. But it is an accurate
[1:03:32] description of the false vine. And that
[1:03:35] Christ rejecting system as described in
[1:03:39] Revelation 3 is not the bride.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; You see, it is the shuck or it is the
[1:03:45] outer husk that once served its purpose.
[1:03:49] But the but in the end it releases the
[1:03:53] grain. It it had the form of life for a
[1:03:57] season. You see, but it refused the
[1:04:00] continuation of the word. And in doing
[1:04:03] so, it rejects Christ himself. And what
[1:04:07] does the Lord say of her? Because you
[1:04:10] are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I
[1:04:13] will spew you out of my mouth. Now that
[1:04:16] word spew actually means to vomit. It's
[1:04:20] a graphic and final expression of divine
[1:04:24] disgust and rejection.
[1:04:27] There are no words in the scripture that
[1:04:30] are more that more bitterly denounce a
[1:04:33] people who arrogantly claimed Christ
[1:04:37] while denying his present truth. And so
[1:04:41] this is not the bride, but all of
[1:04:45] Leodosa,
[1:04:47] not all of Leodosa has rejected him.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we must not miss on this
[1:04:55] important truth that that not all within
[1:04:58] Leodosa rejects Christ. That there's
[1:05:01] somebody, as brother Phil sang this
[1:05:03] morning, going to be victorious.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's somebody going to be an
[1:05:07] overcomer. So you see, even in the
[1:05:10] darkest hour, you see there's a remnant
[1:05:13] that hears his voice. Behold, at the I
[1:05:17] stand at the door and I knock. And if
[1:05:20] any man hear my voice and will open the
[1:05:23] door, I will come into him and suck with
[1:05:26] him and he with me. So no, the door of
[1:05:29] mercy is not closed. Amen. I I want to
[1:05:33] get this, you know, because even as
[1:05:35] brother Brandham says in one of his last
[1:05:38] sermons, one of his very last sermons, I
[1:05:41] think today the hearts are becoming
[1:05:44] stony, filled with the world,
[1:05:47] indifferent church members, lukewarm
[1:05:50] like the rich young ruler, and don't
[1:05:52] know that the great Holy Spirit is
[1:05:55] standing knocking at the door in this
[1:05:58] Leodysian age. He that will hear my
[1:06:01] voice, the word, and will open his
[1:06:04] heart, I will come into him and will s
[1:06:07] with him. So, you know, this shows us
[1:06:09] several things. It shows us first the
[1:06:12] door of mercy is still open.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Secondly, it shows us where he's
[1:06:17] at. He's still standing in the Leodysian
[1:06:21] age knocking.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is this is where he is
[1:06:26] because this is the last sermon now
[1:06:29] before the communion service that he had
[1:06:32] just before he departs. And he's he and
[1:06:35] he's humming as he as he says these
[1:06:37] words he's actually humming the
[1:06:39] invitation song just as I am. And and
[1:06:44] what does it tell us again? Door of
[1:06:46] mercy is open. The Holy Spirit is still
[1:06:49] here. And three, there are people in
[1:06:53] this age within Leodysia who does not
[1:06:58] conform to the lukewarm spirit.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; They answer his knock. They receive his
[1:07:04] counsel. They they are the they receive
[1:07:06] of the gold tried in the fire. They are
[1:07:10] w receive white raignnt. Amen. And isab
[1:07:14] so they can see. and they commune with
[1:07:17] him in intimacy. These are the
[1:07:20] overcomers and they are the bride. Now
[1:07:25] the terrors who are maturing very fast
[1:07:28] today under corrupt teachers and and
[1:07:32] they are already turning people away
[1:07:34] from the word and and of course this
[1:07:36] continues right on to this day. But the
[1:07:40] wheat also must mature. I want you to
[1:07:44] understand the age produces two people.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It produces tears and it produces
[1:07:50] wheat.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; The grain that will be taken into the
[1:07:53] garner. Now, so again, the the wheat
[1:07:57] must also mature. And to her, God has
[1:08:00] sent a prophet messenger with a
[1:08:03] vindicated message and ministry that he
[1:08:06] might be accepted by the elect. And they
[1:08:08] will hear him as the first word. First
[1:08:12] church heard Paul and will m she will
[1:08:14] mature in the word until becoming a word
[1:08:18] bride and the mighty works will be found
[1:08:21] in her that are always attended upon the
[1:08:24] pure word and faith. So you see the
[1:08:28] bride age is an era of time within this
[1:08:33] leodyian age. The bride in this age is,
[1:08:38] you know, is is until the until the
[1:08:42] consummation, until the finishing of the
[1:08:44] age, she is its light. She is the flame
[1:08:48] of its lampstand. And she is absolutely
[1:08:52] not of this present darkness.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, now the bride age as we
[1:08:59] speak about is not a new age apart from
[1:09:02] Leodysia. Now, if that was true, we
[1:09:04] would need another angel messenger. And
[1:09:07] and the scripture only gives us seven,
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; right? Seven. And so, as seven, you see,
[1:09:14] are um speaks of seven lampstands and
[1:09:18] seven flames of fire and seven stars to
[1:09:22] the seven ages. And those stars were the
[1:09:26] angel messengers in his hand to reveal
[1:09:30] his word for the age. Are you with me?
[1:09:34] And so there are only when we get a
[1:09:36] picture of the lamb in Revelation 5,
[1:09:39] there are only seven horns on the lamb
[1:09:42] and it has seven eyes. So there's not
[1:09:46] another age to come there. We are in the
[1:09:49] last age.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; We have come to the climax. And I want
[1:09:53] you to understand that that the bride
[1:09:56] age is the climax of Leodysia,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; the weak coming to full maturity and
[1:10:04] being separated from the shock.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Now, so this is where we are. To him
[1:10:10] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:10:13] me in my throne. You see, somebody
[1:10:17] somebody is going to be raptured in this
[1:10:19] hour.
[1:10:21] Now, of course, these words were not
[1:10:23] spoken to Isuza Street or to the early
[1:10:26] Westlands or even to the shack of
[1:10:28] Pentecost. They were spoken to the final
[1:10:31] overcomers, the bride of this age that
[1:10:35] are triumphant. They are exalted to the
[1:10:38] throne of God with the highest honor
[1:10:41] ever conferred upon any group of people.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you see though
[1:10:50] there are there are those that will go
[1:10:53] into chaos. They will go into the
[1:10:56] tribulation and face the wrath of God.
[1:10:59] But yet I I want you to understand the
[1:11:02] bride of Christ does not end in failure
[1:11:06] but in a raptured victory.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So yeah the nominal church ends in
[1:11:13] apostasy.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the true church, the bride
[1:11:18] does not end in defeat.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. She is raptured, glorified, and
[1:11:24] enthroned.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is this bride age
[1:11:30] then is the capstone of the ages.
[1:11:34] It's what God wanted to produce when he
[1:11:37] said, "I will build a church and the
[1:11:40] gates of hell will not prevail against
[1:11:42] it."
[1:11:43] So you see here again the seven ages end
[1:11:47] with the coronation of the bride.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The selecting of a queen
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; and the crowning. Hallelujah. This is a
[1:11:59] crowning moment that all ages have been
[1:12:02] looking for. And you have been called to
[1:12:05] the marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; What an age that we are living in. So
[1:12:11] you see you see the this is where the
[1:12:14] grain returns to the original word. This
[1:12:18] is the last call and the spirit and the
[1:12:21] bride speak the same thing saying come.
[1:12:25] Amen. And the false vine of course will
[1:12:28] be spewed out. The true vine will be
[1:12:30] caught up. And as the Bible said they
[1:12:33] that were ready went within with him to
[1:12:36] the marriage and the door was shut.
[1:12:41] Amen. Now, as we as we look at this, I
[1:12:46] want you to understand of the false
[1:12:48] vine, it is said that no words ever
[1:12:52] spelled out a more bitter denunciation,
[1:12:56] and no proud and arrogant religious
[1:12:59] people ever deserved it more. Now,
[1:13:02] that's said of this age. but of the true
[1:13:05] vine which is also said of this age that
[1:13:09] we we find the true vine, the true
[1:13:13] spirit, the true church people exalted
[1:13:17] to the very throne of God with the
[1:13:19] highest compliment ever paid to humble
[1:13:24] steadfast spiritual group.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. One gets a bitter denunciation
[1:13:31] that because God is sickened by him.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He is sickened by religion without a
[1:13:38] true experience.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; He is sickened with a with a because of
[1:13:43] confession without a poss possession.
[1:13:46] Are you with me? He is sickened by just
[1:13:50] lukewarm membership.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He spews them out of his mouth and
[1:13:55] said they don't speak for me. But at the
[1:13:58] same time in the same age to the bride
[1:14:01] age he says he says that that we find
[1:14:04] the true vine the true spirit true
[1:14:07] church people exalted to the very throne
[1:14:10] of God. The highest compliment
[1:14:15] ever given or paid to a humble group of
[1:14:18] people.
[1:14:22] My goodness, church, that ought to put
[1:14:25] something in you this morning. Cause you
[1:14:28] to lift your head up high and re and
[1:14:31] receive a compliment.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; This is what he said to me. Amen. He He
[1:14:38] ex He is exalting me to have dominion.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; What does he take you when you were a
[1:14:45] sinner and and he saved you from sin? He
[1:14:48] exalted you.
[1:14:51] to have dominion.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; To have dominion over cigarettes and
[1:14:56] alcohol and and and sex spirits and and
[1:15:00] and anger and every kind of other thing
[1:15:02] that you had in your life and and broke
[1:15:05] the family trees of your past. Amen. And
[1:15:08] there made you put you in a position,
[1:15:11] exalted you to a place of dominion where
[1:15:14] that Satan is under your feet.
[1:15:20] Hallelujah.
[1:15:22] Now, so this is the highest honor ever
[1:15:25] paid to a group of people ever promised
[1:15:27] to sit with him on his throne. Notice,
[1:15:31] not beside him, not under him, but with
[1:15:34] him,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; sharing his dominion.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. His authority, his eternal
[1:15:40] victory. And this promise is not made to
[1:15:43] every churchgoer.
[1:15:46] Even if you go here, it's not made to
[1:15:47] every church go to evening like
[1:15:49] tabernacle. It's not it's not given to
[1:15:52] the casual believer or to the lukewarm
[1:15:56] professor. It is given to the overcomer.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; So what am I telling you? Take your
[1:16:02] sword and fight
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; against the lukewarm spirit of the age.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. that would just want to make you a
[1:16:10] cold formal Christian
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; and not fervent and on and on fire for
[1:16:15] God.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Now, so you see this is again not the
[1:16:21] reward of the other ages. Amen. Although
[1:16:24] there will be a bride out of every age.
[1:16:26] I'm not discounting them. I'm talking
[1:16:28] about those that are here churches,
[1:16:30] grandchildren and great grandchildren of
[1:16:33] previous movements. You see though that
[1:16:36] movement was once filled with God's life
[1:16:38] and played a role even they like the
[1:16:41] Isuza movement you know it it played a
[1:16:44] role in restoring the gifts but it was
[1:16:47] just another stage of the wheat plant.
[1:16:49] It was the sh it was a stage in the
[1:16:53] maturing process and and in the end it
[1:16:56] becomes dead and dry and without life.
[1:17:01] the life that was there moved out into
[1:17:05] the grain.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; So the promise is for the grain, the
[1:17:09] elect, the wordborn bride, those who
[1:17:11] have come all the way to the full
[1:17:13] maturity of the word in this last hour.
[1:17:16] So yeah, we call this the bride age, but
[1:17:20] not as a separate dispensation.
[1:17:22] It is not a new church age that requires
[1:17:25] a new messenger. No, the the the bride
[1:17:28] age is the prophetic fulfillment and the
[1:17:31] climatic conclusion of the Leodysian
[1:17:34] age. It is the portion of Leodysa where
[1:17:38] the wheat or the grain is separated from
[1:17:41] the chaff. Now Jesus promised and in
[1:17:44] fact if you go back and you look at the
[1:17:46] first forerunner in the Bible that would
[1:17:49] forerrun and he said when when when
[1:17:51] Christ come when the Messiah would come
[1:17:54] what would he do? He would thoroughly
[1:17:56] purge his floor. Then he would separate
[1:17:59] the chaff from the grain. And he would
[1:18:02] take the grain into the garner and the
[1:18:05] rest would be burned with unquenchable
[1:18:08] fire.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Right? Now remember again, you know,
[1:18:12] it's fire that cannot be quenched
[1:18:14] because in the tribulation period, they
[1:18:17] go through the purging of the
[1:18:18] tribulation that wind up at the great
[1:18:20] white throne. Judgment there just for
[1:18:22] the deeds done in their body. Not all of
[1:18:25] them are lost.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the great grace that we've
[1:18:29] received in this day is to know that not
[1:18:32] all of them that are lost.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are many of them will be
[1:18:35] purged in the tribulation hour. But not
[1:18:38] the bride.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you have been
[1:18:42] accounted worthy to stand before the son
[1:18:45] of man, the word, and be judged by that
[1:18:48] word and judged now by that word.
[1:18:53] separated from the sin of unbelief of
[1:18:56] the prior ages. Come on, somebody help
[1:18:58] me preach now. Amen. And you have stood
[1:19:01] before the word and he has discerned
[1:19:03] your heart. He has judged you. He has
[1:19:05] separated the unbelief from you and he
[1:19:08] makes you without spot or wrinkle or
[1:19:10] blemish or any such thing. A rapture
[1:19:13] ready people prepared for the coming of
[1:19:16] the Lord.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I look into the mirror of that
[1:19:21] and I say, "Mama, that's me."
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. So you see we are the
[1:19:28] prophetic fulfillment the climatic uh
[1:19:32] conclusion of the Leodysian age where
[1:19:35] the wheat is separated from the chaff
[1:19:38] where the bride breaks free from
[1:19:41] denominational systems
[1:19:44] and steps into her prophetic identity. A
[1:19:47] chosen people a pure virgin prepared to
[1:19:51] meet the bridegroom.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we've come, the church has
[1:19:58] come through Luther's justification.
[1:20:01] That was a move of God. Through Wesley's
[1:20:03] sanctification, that was a move of God.
[1:20:06] Through the Isuza Street, the
[1:20:08] Pentecostal and their gifts. But now she
[1:20:11] is to return to the original Pentecostal
[1:20:15] life and power, not in part, but in
[1:20:19] fullness. You see, the church began as a
[1:20:23] bride, spotless. This is how she began.
[1:20:26] Her beginnings on the day of Pentecost
[1:20:29] was a spotless bride, full of the Holy
[1:20:32] Ghost, rapture ready.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; And now in this last portion of time,
[1:20:38] she returns to what she was. It's like
[1:20:42] planting a grain and you end up with
[1:20:45] grain.
[1:20:46] in between is the life that passed
[1:20:49] through, but it wasn't the grain.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's only harvested or
[1:20:53] raptured when it returns back to grain
[1:20:55] form again. Now, so because he made a
[1:20:59] promise and listen church, when I get
[1:21:01] discouraged, I go right here to this
[1:21:03] promise. When I look around and I see
[1:21:06] people fail and failures around me, I
[1:21:09] look at his promise. He said, "I will
[1:21:11] present to myself a glorious church, not
[1:21:15] having a spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:21:18] thing."
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I don't know, sometimes don't
[1:21:21] know how God's going to do it. But I'll
[1:21:24] tell you, the capstone is called coming
[1:21:26] crying grace, grace,
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; the favor of God, the double favor of
[1:21:32] God to a people of this last day because
[1:21:35] God will not be defeated.
[1:21:39] He will have a people, a bride in his
[1:21:42] image.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; There be a people return right back to
[1:21:46] the faith of the fathers. Now, I want to
[1:21:49] review this quote right here. The whole
[1:21:51] of the gent of the church ages is God
[1:21:54] dealing with the Gentiles
[1:21:56] and calling out a gentile bride to
[1:21:58] himself. And that makes the church ages
[1:22:01] and the fullness of the Gentiles a one
[1:22:03] and the same thing. So it is the bride
[1:22:06] age when the Gentiles reach their
[1:22:09] fullness.
[1:22:11] All right. Now again as we look at this
[1:22:16] I want to to establish that when the
[1:22:19] last member
[1:22:22] now remember this this book this seventh
[1:22:27] sealed book that God had that the lamb
[1:22:29] had. It had names in it.
[1:22:33] And when that last name is manifest on
[1:22:36] earth,
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; and that person has been dipped in
[1:22:39] blood,
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; are you with me? And is added to the
[1:22:46] body, then the rapture comes.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why we're interested in
[1:22:53] outreach.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; That's why we're interested in youth
[1:22:57] meetings.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; That's why we're interested in old
[1:23:01] people's meetings.
[1:23:03] Because there's many people that have
[1:23:05] sat on the pew for years and years and
[1:23:07] years who have not been recognized in
[1:23:10] that book.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Their name may be there, but it hadn't
[1:23:13] been recognized yet. They hadn't been
[1:23:16] dipped in blood. Now, so the when the
[1:23:20] last one comes in, the rapture will
[1:23:22] come. Now each age has received a
[1:23:26] portion of the word and the spirit but
[1:23:30] in the last notice fullness of the
[1:23:33] Gentiles. This is actually from Romans
[1:23:35] um is it 9 or 12? But anyway it's the
[1:23:38] book of Romans. And and the fullness of
[1:23:41] the Gentiles, I want you to get it. That
[1:23:43] when the fullness of the Gentiles comes
[1:23:46] is not that they just simply, you know,
[1:23:50] the last one is saved, but also when the
[1:23:54] word at and the spirit at last comes to
[1:23:58] its full measure.
[1:24:01] So he said in the last days, the last
[1:24:04] 2,000 years, I will pour out my spirit
[1:24:07] upon all flesh.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; This is the day he empties it out.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Each other age got a portion. They got a
[1:24:16] dip of the spirit, you know, a little
[1:24:18] bit of the spirit. Luther had it. Wesley
[1:24:21] had it. That was the Holy Ghost moving
[1:24:23] in those ages, but not in the fullness
[1:24:25] that it is.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not in the fullness. Just in the
[1:24:29] in the in the in the in the first early
[1:24:31] stages of justification or
[1:24:33] sanctification, same thing. Restoration
[1:24:35] of gifts, more of the spirit poured out.
[1:24:37] It was the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now God comes to pour out his
[1:24:45] fullness
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; in the last church age.
[1:24:50] And the bride leaving here will not
[1:24:53] leave here a weak a disbelieving
[1:24:56] unbelieving group of people but a people
[1:24:58] who are full of faith full of power full
[1:25:02] of the Holy Ghost baptized aresh having
[1:25:05] a new and upto-ate experience not
[1:25:08] dependent on yesterday's
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; but alive
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; not a dead church but a living church
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; now so the entire span of the church
[1:25:21] ages is God's redemptive work among the
[1:25:24] Gentiles.
[1:25:26] Ever since that Israel stumbled at that
[1:25:30] stumbling stone,
[1:25:32] you find in in Romans 11 that God turned
[1:25:35] to Gentiles to call out a people for his
[1:25:38] name.
[1:25:40] That's Acts 15:14.
[1:25:42] And that means the church ages and the
[1:25:44] fullness of the gentiles are not two
[1:25:47] separate events or dispensation. They
[1:25:50] are they are one and the same prophetic
[1:25:53] timeline. Now this is the bride age
[1:25:58] al which is also called bride time is
[1:26:02] the final phase within le oysia which
[1:26:05] we're here at the very end of the age
[1:26:08] when the gentile bride receive reaches
[1:26:11] her completion her fullness when the
[1:26:15] last predestimated
[1:26:17] member is washed in the blood of the
[1:26:19] lamb filled with the holy y sealed in
[1:26:22] the body of Christ and then the rapture
[1:26:24] takes takes place and that's when the
[1:26:26] gentile dispensation closes and God
[1:26:30] turns back to Israel. That's when the
[1:26:34] church ages close. You see, throughout
[1:26:36] the seven ages, each generation, as
[1:26:39] we've said, has more uh received a
[1:26:42] portion of the word in the spirit. But
[1:26:44] in this final moment,
[1:26:47] the bride receives the full measure.
[1:26:51] Amen. Not just a portion but the
[1:26:53] fullness of the word.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Matched by the fullness of the
[1:26:58] spirit.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Now in this union the revealed word
[1:27:02] joined with the indwelling spirit. It
[1:27:05] produces a people who will not see death
[1:27:09] but will be changed in a moment and
[1:27:11] twinkling of an eye and be translated
[1:27:14] just like Enoch was
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; into the very presence of Christ.
[1:27:19] Oh, I hope you're ready for it because
[1:27:22] we're right here on the cusp of the
[1:27:24] rapture.
[1:27:26] I want to just bring you right now to
[1:27:28] what the Apostle Paul said in Romans
[1:27:31] 11:25.
[1:27:33] Paul would write and he says for I would
[1:27:37] not brethren that you should be ignorant
[1:27:39] of this mystery
[1:27:42] and that the blindness in this in part
[1:27:44] is happened to Israel until the fullness
[1:27:48] of the Gentiles come in. So they will be
[1:27:51] blind. They will not recognize their
[1:27:53] Messiah until the fullness of the
[1:27:56] Gentiles come in. Now, this statement
[1:27:59] draws a prophetic boundary around the
[1:28:02] church ages. You see, Israel as a nation
[1:28:05] was temporarily set aside. If you read
[1:28:08] Romans chapter nine, and that'd be good
[1:28:11] homework for you to do. Read your Bible.
[1:28:13] Romans chapter nine, the Bible tells you
[1:28:16] that she she was set aside. She was
[1:28:20] actually cut off because she stumbled
[1:28:23] over the stone Jesus Christ and he was
[1:28:27] the rejected cornerstone.
[1:28:30] All right. So again, as we look here the
[1:28:34] next we're going to Romans nine. But
[1:28:36] Israel which followed not after or which
[1:28:39] followed after the law of righteousness
[1:28:42] had not attained to the law of
[1:28:43] righteousness. Wherefore, because they
[1:28:46] sought it not by faith, but as it were,
[1:28:49] by the works of the law, for they
[1:28:51] stumbled at that stumbling stone. And it
[1:28:55] is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion."
[1:28:59] Look, Zion represents the church. It
[1:29:02] represents Israel. Israel is our natural
[1:29:04] the natural church. The the church is
[1:29:06] the spiritual church. I lay in Zion a
[1:29:11] stumbling stone and a rock of offense,
[1:29:15] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[1:29:18] be ashamed.
[1:29:20] Now, as brother Timothy brought that out
[1:29:22] Wednesday night, will not be twisted,
[1:29:24] will will not be like a rope that's in a
[1:29:27] mass of tangles. He that believeth on
[1:29:30] him, you know, the mysteries of God will
[1:29:33] be made known, the truth, the
[1:29:36] revelation. So you see her blindness,
[1:29:39] the blindness of Israel opened the door
[1:29:43] for the Gentiles.
[1:29:46] Are you with me?
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Who were like wild olive branches. Now
[1:29:52] this is the way it's described in Romans
[1:29:54] chapter 11. And they were like wild
[1:29:58] olive branches and they were grafted
[1:30:01] into the root of God's covenant.
[1:30:05] And the church ages are the times of the
[1:30:08] Gentile.
[1:30:09] And God does not deal with the Gentiles
[1:30:11] for redemption purposes outside of these
[1:30:15] seven ages. So the seven church ages
[1:30:18] found in Revelation 2 and three are
[1:30:21] God's specific dealings with the gentile
[1:30:24] bride. But the season is not indefinite.
[1:30:28] It comes to an end. Right? There is, let
[1:30:31] me just tell you, there is a divine
[1:30:34] countdown that is ticking
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; because what did it say? Until
[1:30:42] the fullness of the Gentiles come in.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; So that is a divine countdown.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, it wasn't so in the first
[1:30:55] stage. Wasn't so in the second age. It
[1:30:57] wasn't that close in the third. But the
[1:30:58] further we get to it, the closer we get.
[1:31:00] And we're right here.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Ju come on, church. I mean, ju just like
[1:31:06] our nation is and and the and the world
[1:31:09] today. The atomic clock says that we're
[1:31:12] 3 minutes to midnight and now they moved
[1:31:13] it over to just seconds before midnight.
[1:31:16] And here we're right here on the verge
[1:31:18] of nuclear destruction. And you say,
[1:31:20] "Oh, it can't happen." The Bible said it
[1:31:22] would. The it will burn with a fervent
[1:31:25] heat.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Malachi 4 said we'll walk
[1:31:29] out on the ashes of the wicked.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; It'll burn with unquenchable fire.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Th this is this is where we are
[1:31:39] at.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; And just like the the the the clock is
[1:31:43] ticking right down to the midnight hour.
[1:31:46] Even so, there's another clock that is
[1:31:48] going on that we can look at right now.
[1:31:50] And it's called the fullness of the
[1:31:51] Gentile. And we are nearer now than any
[1:31:54] other age has ever been because we are
[1:31:57] here in the last age at the very end of
[1:32:00] it.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; So you see this divine countdown is
[1:32:09] ticking
[1:32:10] and that is when the last predestinated
[1:32:14] gentile soul is baptized into the body
[1:32:19] of Christ.
[1:32:20] Then the bride will be complete
[1:32:23] and the rapture will take place.
[1:32:26] Now at that moment, at that moment,
[1:32:32] just as Israel was cut off because of
[1:32:35] unbelief, so will the Gentile nations be
[1:32:39] cut off. Why? For the same reason. They
[1:32:43] have rejected the headstone.
[1:32:47] Christ is on the outside of the church,
[1:32:52] right? Amen. Because they rejected the
[1:32:56] capstone or the headstone, the final
[1:32:59] revelation of Jesus Christ, the very
[1:33:02] capstone of the gentile dispensation.
[1:33:05] Now Jesus said this even in his day
[1:33:08] because this is what Israel did. And
[1:33:11] Jesus in Matthew 21:42 said, "The stone
[1:33:14] which the builders rejected, the same
[1:33:17] has become the head of the corner."
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; So the very one that they rejected, the
[1:33:22] Jews became the head of the corner and
[1:33:24] he became the foundation stone which the
[1:33:27] church is built upon.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Because as Paul said, no other
[1:33:33] foundation can any of man lay other than
[1:33:36] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So you see Zachchariah
[1:33:40] prophesied also that we read at the
[1:33:42] beginning you know he prophesied that
[1:33:44] the capstone the finishing stone will
[1:33:47] come with a shout.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me?
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; With a shout and and that shout is a
[1:33:56] message.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do do you realize even the coming
[1:34:01] of the Lord is with is in stages of
[1:34:04] shout voice and trump. It begins with a
[1:34:06] shout, a message
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; to turn our hearts back to the original
[1:34:12] faith.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And it comes crying, shouting. Oh my.
[1:34:17] It's not weeping. It's shouting. It's a
[1:34:19] shout. This is And it's crying grace.
[1:34:22] Grace,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; brother. If we ever need a grace, it's
[1:34:26] this. It's this hour that needs grace.
[1:34:29] We not only need a rapture in faith, we
[1:34:31] need a rapturing grace.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it comes with such grace that
[1:34:38] in the most wicked evil age where
[1:34:40] Satan's Eden is all around you and where
[1:34:43] Satan is the god of this evil of this
[1:34:46] evil age, it comes with such grace that
[1:34:48] a bride is raptured out of it.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You think back over with
[1:34:57] Eve, you know, they couldn't keep one
[1:34:58] word of God and they were in a perfect
[1:35:01] Eden. Yes.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. In a perfect Eden and Satan
[1:35:06] deceived her. But here in this last day,
[1:35:09] the second Eve is coming forth and she
[1:35:11] will not be deceived.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She's walking right back
[1:35:16] into Eden again. Right back into the
[1:35:19] kingdom, right back in the full power of
[1:35:21] the Holy Ghost, going in a rapture.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:28] As I concluded last Sunday, who is that
[1:35:30] I see leaning on the arm of her beloved?
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Not a defeated church, a redeemed
[1:35:38] church,
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; an overcoming church.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm struggling." Brother
[1:35:43] Tim, you are an overcomer. You can't
[1:35:46] overcome it without struggling against
[1:35:48] it. Fight against it. Resist the devil.
[1:35:51] He'll flee from you.
[1:35:56] You were predestined for this moment.
[1:35:59] You were called and ordained for this
[1:36:02] very hour.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; As he said about Esther, for this moment
[1:36:06] have you come into the kingdom.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:14] Now I want to just go for a moment and I
[1:36:18] just want to speak about it just a
[1:36:19] moment. And all we all know what
[1:36:21] happened in our generation.
[1:36:24] We know when you know when when brother
[1:36:27] Brandham for example received the the
[1:36:29] vision of the coming of the seven angels
[1:36:33] and they were to reveal the seven
[1:36:35] thunders of Revelation 10.
[1:36:38] Those voices of thunders revealed the
[1:36:41] mysterious symbols contained in the
[1:36:43] seven seals. It was not something
[1:36:46] outside the Bible. It's something
[1:36:47] written in the Bible. But as Jesus said,
[1:36:50] I speak in parables. And he wrote the
[1:36:52] whole book of Revelation in symbolic
[1:36:54] terms. And it couldn't be revealed by
[1:36:57] theologians. It would take a prophet.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; And so as we as we see this happen, you
[1:37:04] know, in doing so, these seven angelic
[1:37:06] messengers came from glory to reveal
[1:37:09] these mysteries. And these seven angels
[1:37:12] swept Brother Brandham up into the
[1:37:15] vision. And as it concluded,
[1:37:18] as it concluded, he was left sitting in
[1:37:22] the corner of his room reading his
[1:37:26] Bible.
[1:37:28] Now, I want to go to this right quick,
[1:37:32] and I'll just give you the reference.
[1:37:34] This is this is this a sign of the
[1:37:36] insurers. I found myself over in a
[1:37:38] corner. I could hear my wife somewhere
[1:37:41] trying to shake the door. The door in
[1:37:44] the bedroom was locked. I had a Bible
[1:37:47] open. I was reading. I don't know what
[1:37:49] but it was in I believe Romans 9th
[1:37:52] chapter the last verse. Behold I lay in
[1:37:54] Zion a cornerstone a stumbling stone a
[1:37:56] precious stone. And whosoever believeth
[1:37:58] on him shall not be ashamed.
[1:38:01] And I thought it's strange I'd be
[1:38:03] reading that. The spirit's still packing
[1:38:05] me in the room. And I I closed up the
[1:38:08] Bible and stood there and I went over
[1:38:09] the window. It was about 10 o'clock in
[1:38:10] the day or better. I raised up my hands
[1:38:13] and I said, "Oh," I said, "Lord God, I
[1:38:16] don't understand. This is a strange day
[1:38:18] to me and I'm beside myself almost." And
[1:38:21] I said, "Lord,
[1:38:23] what does that mean? Let me read it
[1:38:26] again if it let me read it again if it
[1:38:29] be you." Now, sounds juvenile, but I
[1:38:31] took up the Bible and just flipped it
[1:38:34] open. And it was there again. Same
[1:38:38] place. Paul telling the Jews try tell
[1:38:41] the Romans that the Jews tried to accept
[1:38:43] it by works but it's by faith that we
[1:38:46] believe it.
[1:38:48] Now I this this is a very very important
[1:38:53] thing that we understand because history
[1:38:57] repeats itself.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as the Jews rejected the
[1:39:02] outpour of the Holy Spirit on the day of
[1:39:05] Pentecost,
[1:39:07] turning away from the living Christ for
[1:39:09] tradition and for their temple worship,
[1:39:12] the Gentile in this final age repeats
[1:39:16] the same era. She becomes entangled in
[1:39:20] religious systems
[1:39:22] in in with lukewarm and rich in goods
[1:39:25] and yet fiercely bankrupt.
[1:39:29] You see, just as the Jews were blinded
[1:39:33] to the first coming of the word made
[1:39:35] flesh, the Gentiles stumble over the
[1:39:39] capstone revelation.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; The word again made manifest in bride
[1:39:45] form.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to get it. Remember,
[1:39:48] there's seven mighty angels that came in
[1:39:52] this that caught him up in this
[1:39:54] constellation of of themselves
[1:39:57] and told him to go back to the east and
[1:39:59] and preach and reveal those seven seals
[1:40:02] that are there in the book of
[1:40:03] Revelation. Now, we know they're
[1:40:05] revealed by the lamb, but there has to
[1:40:06] be somebody on earth that receives it,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; right? So you you see as he as he
[1:40:13] receives this climatic vision
[1:40:17] and and I don't have time to go into all
[1:40:19] the symbolics symbols of it and and and
[1:40:22] share with you the whole event but just
[1:40:24] catch the the the top of it when when
[1:40:28] here the angels came and here he's now
[1:40:32] left
[1:40:34] by the departure of the angels
[1:40:37] reading the scripture.
[1:40:41] And the scripture is that he's reading
[1:40:44] is Romans chapter nine
[1:40:48] where that the Jews had received
[1:40:53] Christ
[1:40:55] and rejected him.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; And they stumbled at that stumbling
[1:41:03] stone. And it shows now the Gentiles
[1:41:06] will do the same thing.
[1:41:10] Revelation 3 shows you they will
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; outside his own church
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; knocking
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; rejected.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're still singing about him.
[1:41:21] They're still going through church
[1:41:22] motions, but they have neglected the
[1:41:24] word.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; They've turned him down.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; And when the Gentiles reject the final
[1:41:30] move of the spirit, the call and the
[1:41:32] ceiling and the adoption of the bride,
[1:41:35] God turns back to Israel. That's where
[1:41:37] we're at. That's when the two prophets
[1:41:39] of Revelation 11 will appear. That's
[1:41:42] when the 144,000 will be sealed in of
[1:41:45] the remnant of the Jews. And that's when
[1:41:47] the bride will have already been taken
[1:41:51] in the flight and the glory. So, as
[1:41:54] we're talking about this fullness of the
[1:41:56] Gentiles, it's not about just numbers.
[1:41:58] It's about rightness and readiness and
[1:42:00] revelation. Because once the grain is
[1:42:03] matured and the shuck has served its
[1:42:06] purpose, the sickle is thrust in
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; and the harvest is taken and a bride
[1:42:13] goes into the garner.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; A rapture ready people.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the times of the Gentiles
[1:42:23] reach their climax, then history repeats
[1:42:27] itself and they reject their
[1:42:32] Just as Israel stumbled over their
[1:42:34] stumbling stone, over the cornerstone,
[1:42:36] rejected Christ as his first coming. So
[1:42:39] the gentile church stumbles at the
[1:42:43] return of the headstone.
[1:42:46] Now hold this thought. He is the author
[1:42:49] and finisher of our faith.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; So he was the cornerstone and he's the
[1:42:55] capstone.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so again, it's in our day
[1:43:02] that the headstone comes.
[1:43:09] Now, it's it's it's in our time that the
[1:43:13] word comes to cap off the ages. It's
[1:43:16] it's the same cry that was rejected
[1:43:20] before is now repeated. Grace, grace to
[1:43:22] it. And it was grace when he came to
[1:43:26] Israel. How many believes that was his
[1:43:28] grace?
[1:43:29] walking on the shores of Galilee
[1:43:32] bringing the gospel.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And his grace now in this hour of
[1:43:38] restoration.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; But when but the church, the Leoian
[1:43:43] church is blind just like Israel,
[1:43:48] wretched, naked, and does not know it.
[1:43:52] and she puts Christ on the outside
[1:43:55] shutting the door on the final light of
[1:43:59] the final age.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Now, so the Gentiles are now repeating
[1:44:08] the era of the Jews.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; They have having received the early and
[1:44:14] the latter reign. They now reject the
[1:44:16] capstone which is the full revelation of
[1:44:18] Christ and his word. Because of this
[1:44:21] rejection, God cuts off the Gentiles
[1:44:26] and the gospel turns back to the Jews.
[1:44:29] We're right here in a transition moment.
[1:44:34] But in that moment when God turns from
[1:44:37] the Gentiles,
[1:44:39] he has a remnant.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; For even within the failing Leodysian
[1:44:45] age, there is an overcoming bride.
[1:44:50] a people who hear the knock, open the
[1:44:52] door, and receive the word in its
[1:44:55] fullness.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; And they are those that are called out
[1:44:58] by the message of the seventh angel.
[1:45:00] Revelation 10:7 says, "In the days of
[1:45:03] the voice of the seventh angel, when he
[1:45:05] shall sound his message, the mystery of
[1:45:07] God will be finished." And they are
[1:45:10] called out to receive the token of his
[1:45:12] life. And they're raptured to sit with
[1:45:15] Christ. They are separated from the
[1:45:17] shock. They are gathered into the garner
[1:45:21] and they do not stumble but they receive
[1:45:24] the headstone.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Some stumble at it.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Others receive it. And because of this
[1:45:32] they do not face judgment but enter to
[1:45:35] glory with their bridegroom.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; So the bride age or bride time is within
[1:45:44] le oysia. So yeah, right here in this
[1:45:48] last age, there is an elect lady. She
[1:45:52] rises within the age and her emergence
[1:45:56] marks this as the bride age. But let us
[1:46:00] be clear, it's not a a separate
[1:46:02] dispensation from Leodysia. If it were,
[1:46:05] it would require as I said another
[1:46:07] messenger. And and and scripture and
[1:46:09] prophecy make no such provision for
[1:46:11] that. So but the bride age rather is the
[1:46:14] climax is the ripened fulfillment of
[1:46:19] Leodysia itself. Now the age began with
[1:46:24] great potential.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; It did.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; It opened with powerful
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; stirrings of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; of the Zuza Street Pentecostal revival.
[1:46:35] It was it was a move of God. Don't ever
[1:46:38] think it wasn't.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; That was God back there.
[1:46:42] That was him working among his people.
[1:46:44] It was a move of God that brought a
[1:46:47] further light than what the Methodists
[1:46:50] had.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; It was a past It was another move past
[1:46:55] sanctification.
[1:46:56] It was a baptism of the Holy Ghost being
[1:47:01] poured out. It was a move of God that
[1:47:03] brought it into a further stage of the
[1:47:07] wheat plant, the shuck stage, close in
[1:47:10] form, but yet not the grain itself.
[1:47:15] That was a glorious phase. But let me
[1:47:18] just say it this way. It was still
[1:47:20] immature adolescence.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now in this final
[1:47:28] portion of Leodysa,
[1:47:31] the shuck is peeled back and the grain,
[1:47:35] the true bride emerges.
[1:47:38] She is mature, ripened and ready for the
[1:47:42] garner. So the last of this age is the
[1:47:46] bride age where the wheat sown in tears
[1:47:49] returns in joy, ready for the harvest.
[1:47:53] It's the climax of all church history.
[1:47:58] You're what every one of them were
[1:48:01] prophesying of and pointed to.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; You would be justified like the
[1:48:06] Lutherans, sanctified like the
[1:48:09] Westlands.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Have the gifts of the spirit like the
[1:48:12] Isuza Street.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. But even more, the bride age is
[1:48:18] not just the end of Leodysia. It's the
[1:48:21] crown, the culmination of all the ages.
[1:48:25] It is the final product of the gospel
[1:48:28] seed planted at Pentecost 2,000 years
[1:48:32] ago. Think of that. From Luther's
[1:48:35] justification, the blade to Wesley's
[1:48:37] sanctification, the tossel to
[1:48:39] Pentecostal's gifts of the spirit, the
[1:48:41] shock. You see, um, the life pressed
[1:48:46] forward through the stalk, but only now
[1:48:49] in the closing of the age does a return
[1:48:54] to what it was at the beginning, a
[1:48:57] mature, wordfilled, spiritquickened
[1:49:01] bride,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; just as she was in the upper room.
[1:49:10] Now I want to say this. This is not the
[1:49:15] first bride age.
[1:49:20] The first bride age was Pentecost.
[1:49:25] 2,000 years ago
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; when the church was born in power
[1:49:30] was a pure golden seed of wheat.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was it was it was the
[1:49:38] culmination of all the scriptures of the
[1:49:42] Old Testament
[1:49:45] encapsulated
[1:49:47] in a body
[1:49:50] called the bride.
[1:49:53] And she was rapture ready. I want you to
[1:49:56] get this. She should have been in the
[1:50:00] rapture.
[1:50:04] She was as rapture ready then just as
[1:50:07] she is to be now.
[1:50:09] But as Eve fell before the wedding, the
[1:50:13] early church fell to the nickelan
[1:50:16] doctrine and denominationalism.
[1:50:21] And she went from a chase virgin
[1:50:24] to look at her in the Bible in
[1:50:27] Revelation 17 called a
[1:50:31] She polluted her womb with men's ideas.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; But now in the evening time, there's
[1:50:42] light again and the bride is restored to
[1:50:45] her original condition. Not something
[1:50:47] new, but a restoration. Not another age,
[1:50:51] but a ripened fulfillment of the
[1:50:53] seventh. And she is now ready. The grain
[1:50:56] is ga being gathered. The trumpet is
[1:50:58] about to sound. and the garner is
[1:51:01] awaiting us. This is where we're at in
[1:51:04] time now. So, let's talk about this for
[1:51:07] a moment. The birth of the church at
[1:51:10] Pentecost. As Adam was given a bride
[1:51:13] fresh from the hand of God and was
[1:51:16] undefiled for a free brief time, so was
[1:51:19] Christ, the last Adam, given a pure
[1:51:22] bride, pure and fresh at Pentecost. And
[1:51:25] she remained separate and undefiled for
[1:51:28] some time.
[1:51:30] and the and of the rest does no man join
[1:51:33] himself to them. And the Lord added
[1:51:36] daily such as should be saved.
[1:51:39] Right? How long this continued, we don't
[1:51:42] know. But one day, even as Eve was
[1:51:46] tempted and seduced by Satan, so the
[1:51:49] church was contaminated by the entrance
[1:51:51] of the Antichrist spirit.
[1:51:54] And as John said, 1 John 4:3, "And that
[1:51:57] this is that spirit of the antichrist
[1:51:58] whereof you all have heard that it
[1:52:01] should come and even now already is in
[1:52:05] the world." So here he's already
[1:52:08] recognizing the antichrist is moving.
[1:52:11] And Jesus said concerning his bride in
[1:52:13] that first age, he said, "I have
[1:52:16] somewhat against thee because you left
[1:52:17] your first love. And remember therefore
[1:52:20] from whence thou art fallen, repent." I
[1:52:22] want you to get something.
[1:52:24] In the first church age, they had
[1:52:27] already began a fall.
[1:52:33] It went from a rapture ready state to a
[1:52:36] fallen church.
[1:52:40] Think of that. Now,
[1:52:44] you see, she was a bride once before.
[1:52:48] She was a pure bride. She was born in
[1:52:50] power. Oh, yeah. She was clothed in
[1:52:53] glory. She's filled with with not a
[1:52:56] portion of the spirit, God's fullness.
[1:52:59] The Bible, the Bible said in the book of
[1:53:01] John, of his fullness we have received.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Grace for grace.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's why when grace grace
[1:53:09] comes again, it's fullness time again.
[1:53:12] So you see as Eve came fresh from the
[1:53:14] side of Adam and so a bride came fresh
[1:53:17] from the sight of Christ and she was
[1:53:20] washed in the blood and she was baptized
[1:53:22] in the spirit and and and look
[1:53:27] the church was in that first age already
[1:53:30] a fallen woman
[1:53:34] as Satan had got to Eve before Adam.
[1:53:36] Even so, Satan seduced the church and
[1:53:39] the bride of Christ before the marriage
[1:53:41] supper of the lamb. And what
[1:53:43] specifically was in her midst that
[1:53:45] caused the fall? What? But Revelation
[1:53:47] 2:6, the deeds of the nickelans,
[1:53:51] something went out to conquer the leoty,
[1:53:54] the church
[1:53:57] already that first age had turned from
[1:53:59] following the pure word of God. They
[1:54:00] turn from God's demand of a church uh
[1:54:03] absolutely dependent upon him dependent
[1:54:06] entirely upon God to fulfill his word
[1:54:08] from start to finish apart from human
[1:54:11] government to nickelanism
[1:54:13] which is organizing a human government
[1:54:16] within the church which is all
[1:54:19] governments do legislate for the people
[1:54:24] and that's what every organization does
[1:54:26] is legislate for its people.
[1:54:32] And God never intended
[1:54:35] for a denomination to rule over us.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:43] Which one did God ordain? Which one does
[1:54:45] the scripture ordain? Never. They're
[1:54:48] moves of men.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; They're when men rise up and they have
[1:54:55] this little fear within them. Oh, we're
[1:54:57] going to lose what we have, but we got
[1:54:59] to we got to we got to keep these
[1:55:01] truths. So, they organize
[1:55:03] around them and they put a period
[1:55:07] to what God's doing.
[1:55:10] And what happens when they organize?
[1:55:13] They die. The life leaves.
[1:55:17] Oh, they may still have a form, but let
[1:55:21] me tell you something. This is what Paul
[1:55:23] realized when he wrote and he says, "I
[1:55:27] am jealous over you
[1:55:30] with a godly jealousy.
[1:55:34] I have espoused you to one husband that
[1:55:37] I may present you as a chase virgin to
[1:55:40] Christ."
[1:55:42] This is what he wanted in his age to
[1:55:45] present to Christ a chasteed virgin. But
[1:55:48] I fear, lest by any means a serpent
[1:55:51] begile Eve through his subtlety, so your
[1:55:54] mind should be corrupted from the
[1:55:57] simplicity that's in Christ. For if he
[1:56:00] cometh, he that cometh preaches another
[1:56:02] Jesus whom we have not preached, or if
[1:56:06] you receive another spirit which you
[1:56:09] have not received, or another gospel you
[1:56:12] which you have not accepted, you might
[1:56:14] bear with him. I'm I'm afraid you'll
[1:56:17] receive another Jesus.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Now, he may be called Jesus, but let me
[1:56:23] just tell you, the Jesus of Rome is not
[1:56:26] the Jesus of the Bible.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. The Jesus of many churches
[1:56:35] today, the Bible said he would sit in
[1:56:37] the church, the man of sin, claiming to
[1:56:42] be God.
[1:56:46] So he would actually hide himself in the
[1:56:49] church and and there be enthroned in the
[1:56:53] church and be worshiped in God as God
[1:56:55] and he ain't even God. It's the devil
[1:56:58] when you take the mask off of him.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'll just take Rome for a
[1:57:06] minute. I mean, come on. Their Jesus
[1:57:07] that they have manufactured,
[1:57:10] they have made in their image, in the
[1:57:13] image of the church is a Jesus that has
[1:57:16] to obey his mama.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Is a Jesus that you have to say so many
[1:57:23] Hail Marys.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Is a Jesus that cannot save you, but one
[1:57:28] day when you get over there after
[1:57:30] somebody's prayed you out of purgatory,
[1:57:32] you can might be saved.
[1:57:37] You see, it's a Jesus they have made.
[1:57:40] Now, friends, that's just the mother.
[1:57:43] What about her harlot daughters?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Look, look what look what look
[1:57:51] what this last move did. You know, get
[1:57:53] people down the altar, shake their chin
[1:57:55] up and down, pat them on the back, and
[1:57:56] say, you know, until they get a
[1:57:58] confusion of language. That's not what
[1:58:00] happened at Pentecost.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; It wasn't manufactured tongues. It was
[1:58:06] the Holy Ghost giving utterance.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a confusion of words of Jesus
[1:58:12] to you until you're stammering and just
[1:58:14] saying things that are incoherent.
[1:58:16] That's not speaking in tongues. That's
[1:58:18] manufactured
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; impersonations.
[1:58:23] But that gets in the church creeds
[1:58:28] and they put out the real Holy Ghost.
[1:58:34] And let me tell you, this Holy Ghost
[1:58:35] will make you live right.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul is talking about this and
[1:58:43] he said, "I'm jealous."
[1:58:45] He recognized this threat of corruption,
[1:58:48] the same satanic subtlety that deceived
[1:58:52] Eve in the garden. He feared the church
[1:58:55] would also fall from the simplicity of
[1:58:58] Christ into a into doctrinal deception.
[1:59:03] So he said, "I fear less by any means as
[1:59:06] a serpent begal Eve." So you know how
[1:59:10] would it happen? By receiving another
[1:59:13] Jesus,
[1:59:15] another spirit and another gospel.
[1:59:20] Counterfeits
[1:59:22] watch that look and sound like the truth
[1:59:27] but are perversions of the original.
[1:59:33] So the fall came just as he discerned as
[1:59:36] Paul feared it happened. The early
[1:59:38] church who was once spiritfilled pure
[1:59:42] began to compromise lose their first
[1:59:44] love. The antichrist spirits crept in
[1:59:47] through during that first age and by the
[1:59:49] time of the third and fourth century the
[1:59:51] nian um na formalized the fall and and
[1:59:56] the church left her espouseed husband
[1:59:58] and committed spiritual fornication
[2:00:01] adultery with the kings and the systems
[2:00:04] of the world. And by the time we reach
[2:00:06] Revelation 17, this fallen church is no
[2:00:09] longer described as a virgin, but the
[2:00:11] great
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; full of blasphemy,
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; clothed in scarlet, drunk with the blood
[2:00:19] of saints.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's why this message to
[2:00:26] this final age is so urgent.
[2:00:30] Because the same serpent that beguiled
[2:00:32] Eve in the beginning there in Eden and
[2:00:36] later crept out into the church with
[2:00:38] subtle corruption is still working
[2:00:41] today. He's doing everything he can to
[2:00:44] pull us away from the original faith.
[2:00:48] His tactic hadn't changed. You know,
[2:00:50] only faces has.
[2:00:53] He still slithers in with with whispers.
[2:00:59] Yayath God said. Of course, you know, he
[2:01:02] wasn't a he wasn't a snake in a tree. He
[2:01:06] was a he was like a man. He stood
[2:01:08] upright. He had he was able to talk.
[2:01:11] He was able to reason.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Right. But you see, he comes in. Yeah.
[2:01:16] As God said, and he questions the word
[2:01:20] and then twist it.
[2:01:23] adding a little here, removing a little
[2:01:26] until what is left is no longer truth,
[2:01:29] but a perversion of the truth.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:01:34] here's the tragedy. Deception works.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it works. The modern church, like
[2:01:44] Eve, listens too long to the wrong
[2:01:47] voice.
[2:01:49] She ends up rejecting the voice of God,
[2:01:53] the real Jesus of the word. And she
[2:01:55] receives an impostor, a man-made Christ
[2:01:59] that has been shaped by creeds and and
[2:02:04] dogmas and traditions of man and
[2:02:07] stripped of deity, divorced from his
[2:02:10] word, and powerless to save or deliver.
[2:02:20] So what road?
[2:02:23] Going out in the first stage, a white
[2:02:26] horse,
[2:02:27] an impostor,
[2:02:29] a deceiver,
[2:02:32] looked like Christ, but it wasn't him.
[2:02:38] And I saw, and behold, a white horse,
[2:02:41] and he that sat on him had a bow, and a
[2:02:44] crown was given to him, and he went
[2:02:46] forth to conquer and to conquer.
[2:02:50] Notice this. This is prophetic symbols
[2:02:55] in the Bible where this writer goes
[2:02:58] forth
[2:03:00] and and at first glance it is on white,
[2:03:02] you know, it's dressed in white. It has
[2:03:04] a bow. It he's a mighty conqueror going
[2:03:07] out. Oh, that's got to be Christ.
[2:03:13] It suggests purity because he's wearing
[2:03:16] white, but it isn't. It's deception.
[2:03:20] How many is with me?
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; This is not the lamb of God.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; This is a a usurper. It's a false
[2:03:30] Christ. Is a religious impostor. Is the
[2:03:33] Antichrist that rides out in the very
[2:03:36] first age. Listen, he didn't start just
[2:03:39] finally show up in our age.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; He's been working in every age.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; He just changes tactics. It's the same
[2:03:47] writer, but he'll be on the on the next
[2:03:49] one. It turns bloody red as he gets the
[2:03:51] power of the state and a sword to kill.
[2:03:53] And now he begins to wipe out everything
[2:03:55] that don't agree with him. He gets the
[2:03:56] power of governments behind him. And
[2:03:58] they begin a huge persecution where 68
[2:04:02] million are slaughtered down through the
[2:04:04] ages. And then wipes out the true
[2:04:06] remnant that to where they're just such
[2:04:08] a small number until he can ride out now
[2:04:10] with a with a black horse
[2:04:15] and very sell the very source of life. A
[2:04:18] measure of wheat for a penny, a measure
[2:04:20] of barley for a penny.
[2:04:24] selling the very things that Jesus paid
[2:04:27] and gave freely his life for and prayed
[2:04:30] for it.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; And now you have to buy your salvation
[2:04:34] and buy a candle to pray your your your
[2:04:38] lost ones out of purgatory in paying for
[2:04:42] what Christ died for and paid freely.
[2:04:49] And he winds up as an amalgamation of
[2:04:52] all three of these as a pale horse.
[2:04:56] And his name now is revealed by the last
[2:04:59] living creature of the lion, the ox, the
[2:05:02] man, and the eagle. The eagle screams
[2:05:05] out.
[2:05:06] His name is death.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; But before he's not identified and
[2:05:14] people think it's Christ.
[2:05:20] until the last age and his mask gets
[2:05:24] pulled off of him.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; The man of sin is revealed, the son of
[2:05:29] predition.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; And we trail that serpent all the way
[2:05:33] from Eden all the way down to the end.
[2:05:35] And we see him in the last day. Why?
[2:05:37] Because he's going to have a bride that
[2:05:39] will not be deceived. her eyes will be
[2:05:44] will receive the eyesight and be open to
[2:05:46] the truth in the last day.
[2:05:50] This is God's word. Now, I want you to
[2:05:53] notice he has a bow. The Bible says no,
[2:05:55] this says nothing about arrows.
[2:05:58] He's symbolizing dominion. No arrows
[2:06:01] meaning he had no real power.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Just the appearance of it.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; You know, that's what churches have come
[2:06:09] down to today. No real power, just the
[2:06:12] appearance of it.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; And he was then given a crown, not
[2:06:19] earned by victory on the cross like
[2:06:21] Christ.
[2:06:23] Come on, but by given by men, a
[2:06:27] political religious authority given by
[2:06:30] councils, not by Calvary.
[2:06:33] And he went forth conquering, but not by
[2:06:36] truth, but by deception,
[2:06:39] not by spirit, but by dogma,
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; taking parcels truths, organizing on it,
[2:06:50] and then making bodies of believers.
[2:06:55] And this was that Antichrist spirit
[2:06:57] appearing religious,
[2:06:59] writing within the church, blending in
[2:07:01] with the wheat. But at the heart he was
[2:07:04] a deceiver.
[2:07:06] He had religious
[2:07:08] profession. Oh yeah. Very religious.
[2:07:11] Lots of forms there. Beautiful lithogy
[2:07:15] rituals. My goodness. You know uh a
[2:07:19] claim to divine authority but no
[2:07:22] indwelling spirit. He could quote the
[2:07:25] quotes.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Oh he can today.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; But he couldn't produce life.
[2:07:32] He wore a crown but not the scars of
[2:07:35] Calvary. He held a bow but no arrows of
[2:07:38] deliverance of truth.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; It was all a show.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Come on somebody. A religious system
[2:07:47] that mimicked Christ but denied his
[2:07:51] power. Amen.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; As Paul said, having a form of godliness
[2:07:58] but denying the power thereof from such
[2:08:00] turn away. And the same spirit rides on
[2:08:04] through the ages culminating in the
[2:08:07] final leodysian age where Christ is
[2:08:10] pushed outside
[2:08:13] a system of religious rules in his name.
[2:08:18] But without his person, his presence or
[2:08:21] his power church,
[2:08:24] it ain't going to be as one bit of good
[2:08:27] to symbol. And Jesus ain't here.
[2:08:34] A church without the spirit is a church
[2:08:37] that is powerless.
[2:08:39] And she is a church that is rejected her
[2:08:41] husband and is an adulterer.
[2:08:46] And the final call to the bride is
[2:08:48] receive ass. And that's not optional.
[2:08:51] It's vital. You got to have it. It's not
[2:08:54] just revival. this restoration back to
[2:08:56] the original word, the original life, to
[2:08:58] the original Jesus Christ is the only
[2:09:01] way to escape the great deception of
[2:09:04] this age and be joined to Christ, the
[2:09:07] the true Christ, not the impostor.
[2:09:10] The spirit and the bride say, "Come."
[2:09:15] And the bride is crying out in this hour
[2:09:17] in unison with the spirits.
[2:09:19] same urgency that the prophets and
[2:09:21] apostles had that said, "Come out of
[2:09:24] her, my people."
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm looking at men and women that
[2:09:28] are sitting here today. You heard that
[2:09:31] call
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; and that's why you are here.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; You came out of false religion and you
[2:09:38] came out of lukewarm system and you came
[2:09:40] out to be joined to the word of God made
[2:09:43] flesh in this hour. Christ in you, the
[2:09:46] hope of glory. Amen.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister Gy, that's why you
[2:09:51] left the Hutter rightites.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you lift left it all
[2:09:55] behind your loved ones, your K folks,
[2:09:57] and everybody else and walked out.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you didn't. You heard the
[2:10:02] call that said, "Come out of her
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; and you responded to that vine divine
[2:10:07] call."
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; And Christ is now still calling out a
[2:10:12] bride, a true word bride. And she won't
[2:10:15] fall like Eve.
[2:10:17] She will not compromise like the early
[2:10:19] church,
[2:10:21] but she will stand unblenmished,
[2:10:24] filled with the spirit, clothed in the
[2:10:26] pure word.
[2:10:28] He said to that first age, I have
[2:10:31] somewhat against.
[2:10:34] And that age would fall
[2:10:37] before the marriage could take place.
[2:10:40] And the original bride who was meant for
[2:10:43] the rapture was diverted and not
[2:10:47] raptured to the garner but
[2:10:50] was planted.
[2:10:53] Look at your neighbor for a moment. Say
[2:10:55] they were she was planted
[2:10:59] because
[2:11:01] God would not leave his church in that
[2:11:04] condition.
[2:11:06] And his work of redemption began to even
[2:11:11] restore the church to original glory as
[2:11:14] he himself instead of coming back sat
[2:11:18] down to intercede on her behalf.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, you say, "But brother Tim,
[2:11:29] he was there and he was he sat on there
[2:11:32] for for ignorance sake." And now
[2:11:34] ignorance is over. Not for everybody.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; There's still members of the bride of
[2:11:39] Christ whose names are on the book
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; that the light hasn't dawned on yet.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Amen. So, they
[2:11:49] ain't all come to the knowledge of the
[2:11:51] faith and to the unity of the spirit.
[2:11:54] And until that happen, he's still
[2:11:56] knocking. Until that happen, he's still
[2:11:58] seeking.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Until that happens, there are people
[2:12:01] that are still respond to him. He's
[2:12:04] still saving. He's still delivering.
[2:12:06] He's still setting free. He's a God rich
[2:12:09] in mercy.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; More grace than ever. It's double grace.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; The caps don't come and crying. Grace,
[2:12:17] grace,
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; grace that will pardon and cleanse
[2:12:20] within.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; God's word never fails. The wheat that
[2:12:26] was planted at Pentecost went down in
[2:12:28] the ground during Na, but it's come back
[2:12:31] again. Word for word, life for life, the
[2:12:33] corner weed has returned to its
[2:12:35] original. And we're not going out as a
[2:12:37] weak church,
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; but a victorious church.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; To him that overcometh,
[2:12:44] like I always say, and I say it again
[2:12:47] this morning, he could not say to him
[2:12:50] that overcometh unless somebody's going
[2:12:54] to overcome.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The very word of God
[2:13:02] prophesied
[2:13:03] over you and spoke of your coming that
[2:13:07] you will overcome.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; So whatever sin, whatever problem,
[2:13:14] whatever unbelief, no matter what it is,
[2:13:17] you will rise above it.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; You are not of the fallen world, you're
[2:13:22] not of the fallen church. You are of a
[2:13:24] rising church,
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; a triumphant church.
[2:13:30] said, "Well, Brother Tim, I got a few
[2:13:32] wrinkles this morning." But he didn't
[2:13:34] worry about the wrinkles. He said, "When
[2:13:36] I get through with you,
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; you'll be without a wrinkle."
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Well, I got a few blemishes this
[2:13:42] morning. Well, confess the thing and put
[2:13:45] it under the blood. It'll be white as
[2:13:47] snow.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Though your sins be as scarlet,
[2:13:50] they shall be white as snow. You don't
[2:13:52] have to live with that. You don't have
[2:13:54] to live in that unbelief. Come on.
[2:13:57] applied the blood to it. Repent of it.
[2:13:59] Move on. Let it wash you white.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; He said your garment would be without a
[2:14:05] spot.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; You look at yourself and you say, "I'm
[2:14:12] not what I ought to be." I'll tell you
[2:14:14] what, let the word of God wash you this
[2:14:17] morning. Let it cleanse you.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my goodness. We're not a
[2:14:23] defeated church. We're queen to the
[2:14:26] king. We're standing with him in this
[2:14:28] final hour. Just as he overcame and sat
[2:14:31] down. Remember, he went through it
[2:14:33] himself and overcame, we will overcome
[2:14:36] and take our seat with him. Glory. For
[2:14:38] he has said he hath made us kings and
[2:14:41] priests.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we suffer with him, we will
[2:14:47] also reign with him.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the same life that was in the
[2:14:52] seed of Pentecost is right now back to
[2:14:55] the grain
[2:14:57] gathered into the garment restored to
[2:14:59] original form passed through the blade,
[2:15:01] the tsle, the shut. And now the word
[2:15:04] bride stands full and mature and
[2:15:07] prepared to meet her bridegroom.
[2:15:10] Leodysia is the age of maturity, the
[2:15:12] adoption age where a bride is exalted to
[2:15:16] the throne. they become co-regent with
[2:15:19] him to reign with Christ to the
[2:15:22] millennium.
[2:15:24] Now,
[2:15:26] I'm just going to take the next few
[2:15:28] minutes
[2:15:30] and we'll bring this down to a close,
[2:15:32] but I I got to get to at least a portion
[2:15:34] of this today.
[2:15:37] And and this is the words of Jesus. Now
[2:15:41] Jesus told us that the kingdom of heaven
[2:15:45] or the realm of the Holy Ghost would be
[2:15:48] like this. He said as the earth bringeth
[2:15:52] forth fruit of herself first the blade
[2:15:54] then the ear after that the full corn in
[2:15:58] the ear.
[2:16:00] So Jesus likens us
[2:16:04] to a grain of wheat that is planted.
[2:16:09] And he says the church will come forth
[2:16:13] in in stages
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; that she after her planting that into
[2:16:20] the earth that it would bring fruit. The
[2:16:22] earth would bring fruit of itself and it
[2:16:25] would bring first the first the blade,
[2:16:28] the ca the the the ear and then the full
[2:16:31] corn in the ear. Now, so as we start
[2:16:35] right here, I want you to look at what
[2:16:38] was original. As you see up top, you see
[2:16:41] the golden grain ripe and ready for the
[2:16:45] garner.
[2:16:47] That was the early church, the seed at
[2:16:50] Pentecost, the original word bride.
[2:16:55] In Acts two, she is born in power and
[2:16:57] unity and pure doctrine. She's filled
[2:17:00] with the spirit and walking in the full
[2:17:02] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:06] Oh yeah.
[2:17:08] Oh, I I know there I know people want to
[2:17:10] argue with me and say, "Oh, we got
[2:17:12] things today they didn't have then." No,
[2:17:14] we're just understanding things of
[2:17:16] symbols that was written in mysteries
[2:17:19] that was pertinent to our age.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; But what has been restored is the
[2:17:25] original message Paul had.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; So therefore we are walking they were
[2:17:32] walking in the full revelation of Jesus
[2:17:34] Christ. And the same life that was in
[2:17:37] the early church
[2:17:39] was now in that early or that was in
[2:17:42] Christ rather was now in that early
[2:17:45] bride. So the life of Christ, the full
[2:17:48] measure, the Holy Ghost was poured into
[2:17:51] the church. All that God was, he poured
[2:17:55] into Christ. And all that Christ was, he
[2:17:58] poured into the church.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; And that church was the original grain.
[2:18:03] And she was ready. But now I want you to
[2:18:05] look at the the bottom picture there.
[2:18:08] You see decay
[2:18:11] and a move away from the original had
[2:18:14] started.
[2:18:16] Now anybody knows if you're going to
[2:18:20] take a grain into the garner, you cannot
[2:18:23] take it when it sprouted.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; It's too late.
[2:18:31] It has already started to decay.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; And this is what happened. You know, it
[2:18:39] was ready for the garner. It was ready
[2:18:42] for the rapture. It was the bride age.
[2:18:46] It was marriage time. But she got
[2:18:49] deceived
[2:18:52] like Eve.
[2:18:54] Now then she gets polluted little by
[2:18:58] little and the seed breaks down until
[2:19:03] finally you will find in the plant there
[2:19:06] is absolutely no remnant of this
[2:19:09] original seed.
[2:19:14] Nothing left of it. It's totally
[2:19:17] decayed.
[2:19:19] But the life of it has went into a
[2:19:22] little Now it's working right here
[2:19:25] underground. You can't see it yet, but
[2:19:28] it's there in the darkness. A little
[2:19:30] chute putting down some roots and and
[2:19:34] and and as some will argue with me about
[2:19:37] this early church said, "Well, they
[2:19:39] didn't know the seals." It wasn't sealed
[2:19:40] to them.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; The book was open. It slowly became
[2:19:44] closed because of the Antichrist spirit
[2:19:46] that rode out to conquer and the seed
[2:19:49] deteriorated in the soil and the life
[2:19:52] moved from grain to a blade. And that
[2:19:55] blade had the life of the grain in it
[2:19:59] but was no longer like the original
[2:20:02] grain of wheat at Pentecost. Now it was
[2:20:06] still the seed but it could no longer be
[2:20:09] taken into the garner. It was underneath
[2:20:12] the soil and the church entered the dark
[2:20:14] ages. But even as the spirit of life was
[2:20:16] still moving, it would emerge now in a
[2:20:20] different form that would even be like
[2:20:23] the original.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Nothing like the original seed, but
[2:20:30] bearing his his life in a different
[2:20:32] form.
[2:20:35] Now I want to show you now as we come
[2:20:37] now to this to this to the the blade. it
[2:20:40] emerges out of the dark ages
[2:20:44] and it comes up you know with these
[2:20:47] little fingers of blades and we will
[2:20:51] just really talk about one which is
[2:20:52] Luther and but I mean and there there's
[2:20:56] also other leaves like the Baptists the
[2:20:59] Anabaptist movement they come back to
[2:21:02] water baptism by immersion and not
[2:21:04] baptizing babies but you know but but
[2:21:06] adults and you know they got that
[2:21:09] revelation and Luther gets a
[2:21:11] a revelation of truth of salvation by
[2:21:13] grace through faith. And not only that,
[2:21:18] guess what? After all these years of
[2:21:21] coming out of the dark ages, they didn't
[2:21:23] even have a Bible.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; And Luther under that man age, you know,
[2:21:30] the ox, the man, the lion, the ox, the
[2:21:32] man, and eagle. Now we're in the man
[2:21:33] age. And here he with the intelligence
[2:21:35] of a man invincutenberg press. The first
[2:21:38] thing that they're printing is the
[2:21:39] Bible.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; And they print the Bible and they get it
[2:21:45] in the language of the common people
[2:21:47] because before now it's all written in
[2:21:49] Greek or Latin and is hidden away in the
[2:21:51] courses of Rome. But now it's brought
[2:21:54] out into the light. So here now the
[2:21:56] church emerges from the darkness into
[2:22:00] the light. And now Luther restores the
[2:22:04] truth of salvation by grace through
[2:22:06] faith. This is all he he kind of, you
[2:22:09] know, the book is sealed, but he kind of
[2:22:11] cracks it open enough to to look in
[2:22:14] there and say, "Ah, but the just shall
[2:22:16] live by faith."
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Now, you don't see the full revelation.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; He just gets a portion. And with the
[2:22:25] portion of truth comes a portion of the
[2:22:27] spirit. And as the Holy Ghost is poured
[2:22:29] out, they are justified by his faith.
[2:22:31] Now, let me tell you, these Lutheran
[2:22:32] people that really believe will be in
[2:22:35] the great resurrection,
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; and they're part of the bride of the
[2:22:39] seven ages.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; But there comes a time in the harvest.
[2:22:49] This blade no longer has life
[2:22:53] and it's all dry
[2:22:56] and it's left behind
[2:22:58] when the grain is raptured.
[2:23:04] See? Now watch. So we come right here
[2:23:09] is with a return to the authority of the
[2:23:11] scripture and then we have the
[2:23:14] pollination age, the tassel. Now, if you
[2:23:18] look right there, you'll see little
[2:23:20] golden slivers there.
[2:23:24] And I I don't know what they're called.
[2:23:26] I I forgot to look it up, but it's it's
[2:23:28] pollen.
[2:23:30] And it it as a plant begins to mature,
[2:23:35] John Wesley is emphasizing, but yet
[2:23:39] Luther's revelation was good,
[2:23:42] but we're an advancement of the Lutheran
[2:23:45] age.
[2:23:48] And so he said, "We got to have some
[2:23:51] holiness and a sanctified life to go
[2:23:54] with it."
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; I wish they believe that today, but
[2:23:57] they're dead on the vine,
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; right? They lost all of their holiness.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; I mean, they're embracing every kind of
[2:24:07] thing.
[2:24:09] And you know during this age revival and
[2:24:13] missionary uh spreads like pollen and
[2:24:15] and and there and a deeper personal
[2:24:17] commitment is restored. And so yet it
[2:24:21] was reformation yet there was restored
[2:24:23] truths.
[2:24:27] And then I I want to take you one right
[2:24:29] on down to the next one. And of course,
[2:24:31] now we come to another age, which is the
[2:24:36] Isuza Street Revival, the Pentecostal
[2:24:38] movement with restoration of the gifts.
[2:24:43] And the plant now looks close to the
[2:24:47] grain,
[2:24:48] but it's still not the original seed.
[2:24:52] Now, this is different, but it's like,
[2:24:56] you know, when you go out and you uh
[2:25:01] you pick regular corn
[2:25:04] and you pull back the shock
[2:25:08] and you look in there and you can see um
[2:25:12] little tiny, you know, if you get it
[2:25:15] really early, you you'll see where it's
[2:25:17] beginning to form, but it's not there.
[2:25:22] Amen. It's not ripe.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Now, if you make a mistake as a farmer
[2:25:26] and go out there and and and harvest
[2:25:28] your crop, you ain't got nothing to eat
[2:25:31] but chucks. That's
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this exactly what this is that
[2:25:39] spiritual gifts return to the church
[2:25:41] speaking in tongues healing prophecy and
[2:25:44] the outward appearance resembles
[2:25:47] Pentecost but it's not yet the full
[2:25:50] word.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this is I want you to get
[2:25:56] this. This is one and this is going to
[2:25:59] be important when I I'm going to teach
[2:26:01] you on the Holy Ghost. The evidence of
[2:26:03] the Holy Ghost. We're going to we're
[2:26:05] going to speak about adoption, all of
[2:26:07] these things in in some of the things
[2:26:10] that I have that I want to teach to the
[2:26:12] church.
[2:26:14] But this produces
[2:26:16] the most deceptive time that the church
[2:26:21] ever known.
[2:26:23] And it's not because of open rebellion
[2:26:26] and blatant atheism, but because of
[2:26:29] imitation and impersonation. Look at it.
[2:26:33] It looks like it's grain,
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; but if you take it in the harvest now,
[2:26:42] you'll have nothing.
[2:26:48] So the Enusa movement bore the outward
[2:26:51] resemblance to the original Pentecostal
[2:26:54] outpouring.
[2:26:57] And they even called it Pentecost,
[2:27:00] but it wasn't.
[2:27:03] It was just another stage of the life on
[2:27:05] the way back to Pentecost.
[2:27:08] Now watch. The Isuza street bore outward
[2:27:12] resemblance to the original outpouring,
[2:27:15] but it lacked the full manifestation of
[2:27:17] the word made flesh. It looks like
[2:27:19] grain. It talks like grain.
[2:27:22] It shouts like the grain, but it's not
[2:27:26] the grain.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; It's the shock.
[2:27:31] And it's a twin.
[2:27:34] Get this now. It's a twin
[2:27:37] to the real Pentecostal church even
[2:27:40] though it bears the same name.
[2:27:45] And that's what makes it so deceptive.
[2:27:50] It's not Antichrist outside the church.
[2:27:54] It's Antichrist in the guise of the
[2:27:56] church. A shuck wrapping itself around
[2:27:59] the life of the grain. It has all the
[2:28:02] externals of Pentecost, gifts, music,
[2:28:05] emotional expression, tongues, gifts of
[2:28:07] the spirit, healing, miracles, but it
[2:28:10] lacks the quickened seed of the word
[2:28:13] that brings that that brings a life into
[2:28:16] full maturity and and its churches are
[2:28:19] full of grandchildren and great
[2:28:21] grandchildren
[2:28:23] of those who once had life but failed to
[2:28:26] move with the light.
[2:28:30] Did you hear me?
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; And that, you know, that's what we're
[2:28:33] looking at when we when we examine them,
[2:28:36] even the membership of these churches
[2:28:38] today. They're filled with grandchildren
[2:28:40] or great great grandchildren or great
[2:28:42] great grandchildren of what was once a
[2:28:45] move of God, but they're lacking the
[2:28:48] same life that they had and the same
[2:28:51] power they had.
[2:28:54] That's why that we must not produce
[2:28:58] grandchildren cuz God has no
[2:29:01] grandchildren. He only has sons and
[2:29:04] daughters. That's why everybody must
[2:29:07] have a new birth, a personal experience
[2:29:10] with God. It can't be handed down
[2:29:13] secondarily from somebody else in
[2:29:15] another generation. and you're wearing
[2:29:17] grandma's religion
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; and you're trying to walk around with
[2:29:23] daddy's religion on you. You've got to
[2:29:26] be clothed with the Holy Ghost yourself.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:29:34] as the grain ripens,
[2:29:38] the truck pulls away.
[2:29:41] Now, this is Bible church. We're not
[2:29:44] going on hearsay. This is Bible we're
[2:29:48] basing this on.
[2:29:52] When he comes,
[2:29:54] he will thoroughly purge his floor.
[2:29:58] He will separate the wheat from the
[2:30:00] chaff. He will gather the g grain into
[2:30:04] the garma. The shock will burn in the
[2:30:08] tribulation with unquenchable fire. The
[2:30:11] wrath of God will be poured out. The
[2:30:14] seven vials will be poured out of stored
[2:30:17] up judgments
[2:30:19] in the tribulation to come.
[2:30:23] So this is the hour when the word bride
[2:30:27] is forming and Christ and his bride the
[2:30:29] hope of glory. And as the full grain
[2:30:31] appears, the husk begins to dry.
[2:30:37] Now, that which once looked alive
[2:30:40] is now dead.
[2:30:43] Now, wait a minute. The grain isn't
[2:30:46] dead.
[2:30:47] That's where the life is. It's mature.
[2:30:52] It's ready for the garner. It's ready
[2:30:54] for the harvest. But look at the blade.
[2:30:58] Life is lifted.
[2:31:01] It's no longer there. Where is the life?
[2:31:04] Do you see any life there?
[2:31:06] Yeah, there's some life. It's in the
[2:31:08] grain.
[2:31:10] That's where the life is.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; It all left the other stages of the
[2:31:15] plant and comes into a form that can be
[2:31:19] raptured.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; Now watch.
[2:31:25] Here's the deception.
[2:31:28] People are still worshiping in the
[2:31:29] shock.
[2:31:32] mistaken the outer revival with his
[2:31:34] emotion and church structure is for
[2:31:36] inner life. But the real bride,
[2:31:39] friends, she's not just dancing or
[2:31:41] shouting in the spirit. She's feeding on
[2:31:43] the hidden mana.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's ripening under the sunlight
[2:31:48] of this evening time and she's becoming
[2:31:50] one with the word. See, the the true
[2:31:53] grain must be identical to the original
[2:31:56] seed that was sown at Pentecost. Not
[2:31:59] just in gifts, but in life, in doctrine,
[2:32:01] in purity, in power,
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; it must be the word made flesh again.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Where? In a people,
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The manifestation of the son of
[2:32:17] man, Christ in bride form.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; And when that grain is fully formed,
[2:32:26] there's no more use for the shock.
[2:32:29] It separates.
[2:32:31] The shuck cannot follow the grain into
[2:32:34] the harvest. It has served its purpose.
[2:32:44] It had a purpose,
[2:32:46] but it served its purpose.
[2:32:51] Everything of the stalk,
[2:32:55] the shuck,
[2:32:57] the blade, the pollen is left behind.
[2:33:02] None of it goes in the garner.
[2:33:06] Only the original bride word goes back
[2:33:11] in a rapture.
[2:33:14] And this age is not going to be planted.
[2:33:21] We're not going to go through seven more
[2:33:23] ages.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; Read your Bible. There's not 14.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; There's only seven and we're at the last
[2:33:29] one.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; So, we're not going to perpetuate the
[2:33:32] ages. This is the bride age where a
[2:33:34] bride receives her bridegroom
[2:33:38] is changed in a moment of twinkling eye
[2:33:41] and goes to the rapture. That is the age
[2:33:43] we're in.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:46] So therefore, you see, yeah,
[2:33:51] that Pentecostal shock was that
[2:33:55] movement. It was a significant part of
[2:33:58] God's redemptive cycle. My goodness,
[2:34:01] great men of God. Smith Wigglesworth,
[2:34:04] Frank Bartleman, you know, uh, all all
[2:34:07] of all the different ones, you know,
[2:34:10] that that that you could think of. You
[2:34:12] could call her names, you know, uh, FF
[2:34:14] Bosworth and great men of God. John G.
[2:34:17] Lake,
[2:34:18] men, men of God. That's where the life
[2:34:22] was.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; And I want you to say, if you wanted to
[2:34:25] be saved in that hour, that's where you
[2:34:27] had to find salvation.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; That's where the life was.
[2:34:32] Amen. Now, but now the life had moved
[2:34:37] out of the Methodist age.
[2:34:40] And when it moved into the shuck, it was
[2:34:42] now manifested in a fresh outpouring of
[2:34:46] the spirit.
[2:34:47] But according to the cycle of wheat,
[2:34:50] after the shuck comes the grain.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; What did he say? The not the immort, the
[2:34:59] full corn.
[2:35:02] of the ear. And when the seventh angel
[2:35:06] sounds his message,
[2:35:08] remember Goliath delivered the final
[2:35:11] message to the final age. The life left
[2:35:15] the shock.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; And from that point on, it was no longer
[2:35:20] the Pentecostal age or the Zuza Street
[2:35:23] age. It now was the bride age where a
[2:35:26] bride was called out
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; not out of leodyian age or the seventh
[2:35:32] age or under out from under the seventh
[2:35:34] angel but it was called out of the
[2:35:36] lukewarmness.
[2:35:37] It was called out of religious systems.
[2:35:40] It was called out of the ship.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it only way out of the
[2:35:46] seventh age is a rapture.
[2:35:51] Yes, sir.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; That's why we're not merely in the
[2:35:54] Pentecostal age or the era of the Zuza
[2:35:57] Street movement anymore. We are,
[2:35:59] although we're still in the seventh age,
[2:36:01] we are now in the bride age, bride time,
[2:36:04] bride era, a prophetic time of union,
[2:36:07] maturity, where the life has now moved
[2:36:10] into the grain.
[2:36:12] This is the time of the marriage of the
[2:36:14] lamb.
[2:36:16] How many believes that?
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:20] Revelation 19:7 says that now listen you
[2:36:25] don't look you don't take
[2:36:35] you don't take that and harvest it. You
[2:36:39] will just have bailed hay straw.
[2:36:44] You don't take that and harvest it. It's
[2:36:47] not harvestable.
[2:36:50] You just have bail's bail. Hey, animal
[2:36:53] fodder.
[2:36:55] You know, you know, you don't even take
[2:36:57] that.
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; It will not keep.
[2:37:02] You know, in that in that stage, it's
[2:37:04] it's still in the milk stage. It will
[2:37:06] not keep.
[2:37:11] It won't last for eternity.
[2:37:15] Most time it won't last from one revival
[2:37:17] to the other. They're right back at the
[2:37:20] altar trying to get the Holy Ghost
[2:37:21] again.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's only in this stage that
[2:37:30] you can take in the garner
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; where it is laid in the presence of the
[2:37:35] sun, the word of God, and is ripened and
[2:37:37] come fully matured like the bride was at
[2:37:41] Pentecost.
[2:37:43] Then it can be taken in the gardener.
[2:37:45] Now, let me bring it to another
[2:37:47] illustration. Now he types it as a
[2:37:49] marriage, right? The marriage of the
[2:37:52] lamb has come.
[2:37:54] You don't take a child to be married.
[2:37:59] Luther's age was like a little girl at
[2:38:02] let's say eight or 10 years old.
[2:38:06] Wesley brought her into adolescence
[2:38:10] at Isuza Street. She reached the a the
[2:38:14] stage of a young woman, but she still
[2:38:16] wasn't ready for marriage.
[2:38:19] And now under the reveal in the word,
[2:38:21] she comes to full maturity.
[2:38:25] Just like the church began 2,000 years
[2:38:27] ago at Pentecost with the people filled
[2:38:31] with the spirit, fully married to the
[2:38:33] word. So the bride finishes as a mature
[2:38:37] woman clothed in the righteousness of
[2:38:40] Christ, full of oil, ripened by the sun
[2:38:42] of the evening light. And she is now the
[2:38:44] grain, the part that is gathered into
[2:38:47] the garner.
[2:38:49] As James said, be patient, therefore,
[2:38:52] brethren, to the coming of the Lord.
[2:38:55] Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the
[2:38:58] precious fruit of the earth. And he has
[2:39:01] waited now for seven ages. And he is
[2:39:04] about to throw in the sickle.
[2:39:08] And this is where we are where the same
[2:39:10] life that was in the seed has now
[2:39:13] returned. Not just gifts, but the full
[2:39:16] mature revealed word. Although it has
[2:39:19] ever divine promise in it, healing
[2:39:21] gifts, miracles, signs, wonders, it
[2:39:23] can't be the full word without having
[2:39:25] it. Come on, somebody help me preach.
[2:39:28] Amen. The bride is pure, mature, and
[2:39:30] ready for the harvest. Amen. She is a
[2:39:32] bride that has made herself ready. And
[2:39:37] guess where the grain appears?
[2:39:42] She appears in the last age where the
[2:39:47] book is revealed.
[2:39:49] And that's where we are in this very
[2:39:52] time in the fullness of the word.
[2:39:57] ready to be gathered into the garner.
[2:40:02] I'm going up.
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; I'm part of those that are rising.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not a part of the fallen church and
[2:40:10] I'm one of those that are communing with
[2:40:13] him. I've opened the door for him to
[2:40:16] break the bread,
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; reveal himself, make his word known, and
[2:40:22] me eat it and become one with it. Can't
[2:40:26] you see why I'm happy?
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; I've accepted the word of the Lord.
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the musicians come.
[2:40:38] Oh, I' I'd have loved to been able to go
[2:40:41] on. I'd love to taken you and maybe
[2:40:44] maybe I will, but I'd love to take you
[2:40:46] on and into into you know what happens
[2:40:50] next. You know what where where we go
[2:40:53] from here? We go into the garner. were
[2:40:55] there at the marriage supper and from
[2:40:58] there we come back with him in
[2:40:59] Revelation 19 and and and we could
[2:41:02] discover all the wonderful truths of the
[2:41:04] battle of Armageddon of of of the the
[2:41:07] the final rebellion of Gog and Magog and
[2:41:10] and then we could we could come and see
[2:41:12] what happened to Jews and what happens
[2:41:14] to the false prophet and the beast and
[2:41:16] all of these things and where Satan is
[2:41:18] bound for a thousand years. It's there's
[2:41:20] so many things laying here in the word,
[2:41:23] so many truths that God wants you to
[2:41:25] see.
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; One thing he wants you to see that
[2:41:29] you're not a part of the tribulation
[2:41:32] ahead.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; You see why this had to be revealed.
[2:41:38] Otherwise, you'd be trying to be the the
[2:41:40] that multitude without number that
[2:41:42] washed the robes in the blood of the
[2:41:44] lamb and made them white in the
[2:41:45] tribulation. You be trying to be that.
[2:41:47] But God is showing you, you are not that
[2:41:49] people. That's the church going through
[2:41:51] the tribulation, but the bride is
[2:41:53] raptured out before that. He's showing
[2:41:56] you, you're not the 144,000. That is not
[2:41:58] your message. Don't try to take that
[2:42:00] part.
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He expire He unveils and shows
[2:42:06] the whole inner system where where he
[2:42:08] can say, "Here is that Antichrist system
[2:42:10] and you are outside of it. You're not a
[2:42:13] part of it.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; You are redeemed. You are washed by the
[2:42:17] blood. You are the bloodwashed church.
[2:42:19] You're ready for rapture. Amen. You are
[2:42:22] the grain return. You are the people of
[2:42:24] the bride age. You are the people of the
[2:42:26] book. You are the overcomer in the age.
[2:42:28] You are the weak. You have token life.
[2:42:30] You have God on life in you. You are
[2:42:32] sons and daughters of the great king of
[2:42:34] glory. You are the overcomer in this
[2:42:37] age. Let's stand together and let's
[2:42:39] rejoice. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name
[2:42:43] of the Lord. Why don't you just raise
[2:42:45] your hands and worship God right now as
[2:42:48] you love him with all your heart?
[2:42:55] [Music]
[2:43:03] I'm so happy
[2:43:09] I've accepted

[2:43:22] word

[2:49:52] thee.
[2:49:55] Oh, I
[2:49:57] exalt
[2:49:59] thee.
[2:50:03] Oh,
[2:50:05] how I need thee.
[2:50:09] Yes, how I need
[2:50:14] thee.
[2:50:16] Oh yes, I
[2:50:20] need thee.
[2:50:24] Oh yes, I need
[2:50:29] thee.
[2:50:32] Oh
[2:50:35] Lord.
[2:50:37] Oh, how I need thee. How I need
[2:50:43] thee.
[2:50:46] Oh, how
[2:50:48] I need thee.
[2:50:52] [Music]
[2:50:53] Oh, how
[2:50:56] I need
[2:50:58] thee.
[2:50:59] [Music]
[2:51:00] Yes. Oh
[2:51:03] Lord, I exalt thee.
[2:51:07] Oh, I I exalt
[2:51:12] thee.
[2:51:14] Yes, I
[2:51:17] exalt
[2:51:19] thee.
[2:51:22] Oh, I
[2:51:24] exalt
[2:51:26] thee.
[2:51:30] Oh
[2:51:31] Lord.
[2:51:35] Oh, I
[2:51:37] [Applause]
[2:51:40] [Music]
[2:52:04] Amen. We're going to at this time
[2:52:07] dismiss those that need to leave. We're
[2:52:10] going to be having um communion and foot
[2:52:15] washing and um and then of course after
[2:52:19] that we will gather here in the
[2:52:21] fellowship hall for a fellowship meal
[2:52:24] that we will enjoy together.
[2:52:28] So no one has to leave.
[2:52:32] you know, you are welcome to stay even
[2:52:35] if you're not taking the communion.
[2:52:38] You can just remain at your seat
[2:52:42] and uh let me give you a little
[2:52:43] instruction of what we're going to do.
[2:52:47] The ushers will come and they will call
[2:52:49] you by row
[2:52:52] and they will bring you up two sides.
[2:52:56] You'll meet here at the table. You'll
[2:52:57] take the communion. You go out these
[2:53:00] doors. the men go to the right, the
[2:53:02] women go to the left, go to foot
[2:53:04] washing. If you're up in age, elderly,
[2:53:07] or got a situation that you you you
[2:53:11] don't take the the foot washing, well,
[2:53:15] then you just go right back to your
[2:53:16] seat. You wait and we'll be coming back
[2:53:19] for the dismissal and dismiss the
[2:53:22] audience then all together as we just
[2:53:25] worship the Lord. Now, we want to make
[2:53:27] this really a time of worship just for a
[2:53:29] moment.
[2:53:30] Before I read the scripture, I want to
[2:53:32] sing the song, He Was Wounded for Our
[2:53:35] Transgressions.
[2:53:37] And after that, I'm going to dismiss the
[2:53:39] musicians.
[2:53:41] We'll turn on a some music
[2:53:45] so that they can come to the line first
[2:53:47] so they can be back here for the
[2:53:50] conclusion of the service very very
[2:53:53] soon.
[2:53:55] So
[2:53:58] our personnel will be going through the
[2:54:00] line first and then out to foot washing
[2:54:03] and then back.
[2:54:06] So right now I want you just to
[2:54:08] consecrate yourself.
[2:54:12] We don't have a closed communion here.
[2:54:15] Communion is open to any believer.
[2:54:19] You don't have to belong to our church.
[2:54:22] If you profess Christ as your savior,
[2:54:24] you're living a a life that is
[2:54:26] sanctified
[2:54:29] and you receive that portion of his
[2:54:30] spirit, then you're welcome to the
[2:54:33] communion table.
[2:54:36] And today we are doing this to observe
[2:54:41] the last things that Jesus did and he
[2:54:43] commanded us to do them.
[2:54:46] [Music]
[2:54:48] And he took bread that was unleaven
[2:54:53] representing his own body free from sin
[2:54:57] and he broke it
[2:54:59] and he said take eat. This is my body
[2:55:02] which is broken for you.
[2:55:05] And then he would take of the blood of
[2:55:10] the grape.
[2:55:13] That was the life squeezed out. And he
[2:55:15] says, "This is my life
[2:55:18] that was squeezed out for you."
[2:55:21] [Music]
[2:55:23] When you take this, do this in
[2:55:25] remembrance.
[2:55:27] I want you to remember what I did for
[2:55:29] you. I want you to remember Calvary.
[2:55:34] Now as we will take this bread,
[2:55:38] it came from one loaf
[2:55:41] but we have taken it and we have torn it
[2:55:44] into
[2:55:46] hundreds of people pieces representing
[2:55:50] people
[2:55:52] because now his body on earth is his
[2:55:57] church.
[2:55:58] She's the corporate body of Christ.
[2:56:02] [Music]
[2:56:04] And when we take of this communion,
[2:56:07] we are confessing that we're part of
[2:56:09] Christ and part of his church.
[2:56:14] And we're confessing that we have drank
[2:56:19] of his blood, his spirit, the life that
[2:56:22] was in him. and we have received his
[2:56:23] spirit
[2:56:26] and we are making that profession before
[2:56:29] this congregation.
[2:56:31] Now, if we do that unworthily with sin
[2:56:34] in our lives,
[2:56:36] we're we are telling a lie before the
[2:56:39] church of God. And the Bible said
[2:56:43] because of this,
[2:56:45] many are weak and sickly among us. And
[2:56:49] many are asleep
[2:56:52] because they have not discerned
[2:56:55] this is the Lord's body.
[2:56:57] [Music]
[2:56:58] So today when we're coming here, we want
[2:57:02] to come consecrated
[2:57:04] ever sin under the blood, our lives
[2:57:08] cleaned up before him. We should have
[2:57:11] done it before we come to the church.
[2:57:14] But if we've done something to someone
[2:57:17] else, mistreated them or offended them,
[2:57:20] we should have made that right. This is
[2:57:22] a time of healing.
[2:57:24] It's not only a time of healing for the
[2:57:28] the
[2:57:31] spiritual healing, but it's a time of
[2:57:34] healing for the body.
[2:57:37] That as you come through this communion
[2:57:39] line and you take of this,
[2:57:43] it is symbolic just like when we anoint
[2:57:45] you with oil, it is symbolic of the Holy
[2:57:48] Spirit that we're placing between you
[2:57:50] and that sickness.
[2:57:53] this you are confessing. I'm a part of
[2:57:55] this body. I'm receiving of his spirit.
[2:57:58] I've received of his spirit. I have a
[2:58:01] right to the divine covenant. And
[2:58:03] therefore,
[2:58:05] in eating this, I am partaking of
[2:58:08] everything Christ has to offer. Healing,
[2:58:12] deliverance, salvation.
[2:58:16] And when you come through, I want you to
[2:58:18] believe for the healing of your body.
[2:58:23] It's afforded to you.
[2:58:26] Let's sing this together.
[2:58:28] He was wounded
[2:58:32] for our
[2:58:35] transgressions
[2:58:39] and he was bruised
[2:58:43] for our
[2:58:45] iniquities.
[2:58:47] He took all your punishment.
[2:58:51] Surely
[2:58:53] he bore
[2:58:56] our sorrow
[2:58:59] and with his stripes
[2:59:02] now
[2:59:04] his stripes we
[2:59:06] are healed. One more time.
[2:59:11] He was wounded
[2:59:15] for ruins
[2:59:17] transgressions.
[2:59:19] Make it personal.
[2:59:22] He was bruised
[2:59:25] for my
[2:59:27] iniquity.
[2:59:29] [Music]
[2:59:32] And surely
[2:59:35] he bore
[2:59:38] him sorrow.
[2:59:43] And by
[2:59:46] his strip
[2:59:48] is
