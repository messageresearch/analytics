John 113 which were born not of the blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man but of God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

And we want to thank you very much for this tonight. and all of you parents, what you put into your children. And these are just little glimpses of what um the love gifts that God has given us through his son Jesus Christ. And as we have this play, it's all about Jesus. And that's what this time of the year is about is Jesus. Because we don't celebrate as the world does. We don't bring in the paganism of the world, but we do it as the prophet did. And we remember this time of the year, a day set aside to honor and remember the Lord's birth. We know he wasn't born on Christmas Day on December 25th. We realize there's paganism that is around us, but that's not what we do. We are we are showing forth the light in this evening time. to show forth that there is a truth to Christmas that God did send a love gift to the world. And so, thank you for coming out today. Thank you for being a part of this. And thank you teachers, all that you've done, you young people. God bless you. We love you. Let's just pray. Talk to the Lord. Father, we thank you tonight for your goodness to us, your grace in our lives. We thank you, Lord, for the love gift that you sent to the world. that you did. You gave your only begotten son that whosoever would believe in him would not perish but have everlasting life. So we are asking Lord a special blessing on these children, upon these parents, upon these teachers, upon grandparents, everybody that is here, friends, loved ones that have come, Lord, to enjoy this little moment and to realize that everything that we have comes because of that love gift where you gave your life for us. Thank you Lord that you condescended throughout the eternals and came down into our world to be one of us to give your life for a ransom paying the price of redemption and given them us the gift of your own spirit. I ask your blessings now upon the food refreshments that we will take in Jesus name. Amen. So, we have a little bit of refreshments that are there in the fellowship hall and you're welcome to join us there. Thank you very much. God bless you. [applause]
