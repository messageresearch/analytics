[42:04] you believe in god believe also in me
[42:07] for in my father's house are many
[42:09] mansions

[42:13] i go to prepare a place for you and if i
[42:16] go and prepare a place for you i will
[42:18] come again and receive you unto myself
[42:21] that where i am
[42:23] there you may be also
[42:25] and whether i go you know in the way you
[42:27] know thomas said on him lord we know not
[42:29] whether thou goest and how can we know
[42:31] the way
[42:32] jesus said unto him i am the way
[42:35] the truth and the life
[42:37] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[42:40] he said if you had known me you would
[42:41] know my father also from henceforth you
[42:44] know him and have seen him
[42:46] and philip sayeth unto him lord show us
[42:48] the father and it sufficeth us
[42:51] and jesus saith unto them have i been so
[42:53] long time with you and yet hast shall
[42:56] not know me philip he that has seen me
[42:59] has seen the father how saith thou then
[43:02] show us the father believeth thou not
[43:04] that i am the father and the father and
[43:06] to me the words that i speak unto you i
[43:09] speak not of myself but the father that
[43:11] dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[43:14] believe me that i am in the father and
[43:16] the father in me or else believe me for
[43:18] the very work's sake
[43:20] verily verily i say unto you he that
[43:22] believeth on me the works that i do
[43:25] shall he do also
[43:27] and greater works than thee shall he do
[43:29] because i go
[43:30] unto my father and whatsoever you shall
[43:33] ask in my name that will i do that the
[43:35] father may be glorified in the son and
[43:38] if you ask anything in my name i'll do
[43:41] it if you love me keep my commandments
[43:43] and i will pray to the father he shall
[43:45] give you another comforter that he may
[43:47] abide with you forever
[43:49] even the spirit of truth in the world
[43:51] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[43:54] neither knoweth him but you now know you
[43:57] know him and he for he dwelleth with you
[44:00] and shall be in you

[44:15] my in my father and ye and me and i and

[44:28] and i will love him and will manifest
[44:30] myself to him judas saith unto him not
[44:33] iscariot lord is it
[44:36] how is it that thou wilt manifest
[44:38] thyself unto us and not into the world
[44:41] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[44:43] man loved me he will keep my words and
[44:46] my father will love him and we will come
[44:49] unto him and make our abode with him
[44:52] he that loveth me not keepeth not my
[44:54] sayings

[45:52] speak to you on a been on this thought
[45:54] of light
[45:55] for a few months now but
[45:56] i just want to continue on that but i'd
[45:58] like to speak to you on the most
[46:00] precious light
[46:02] the most precious light
[46:05] i was looking at these words
[46:07] and you know twice in the scripture
[46:09] reading at the very beginning he would
[46:11] say it and again here in verse 27 he
[46:14] would say it again let not your heart be
[46:16] troubled
[46:17] neither let it be afraid
[46:20] this trouble is to agitate
[46:23] or to cause one inward commotion
[46:26] it's to take away his calmness of mine
[46:29] to disquieten him to make him restless
[46:32] to stir one up
[46:34] to str to trouble
[46:36] to strike one's spirit with fear and
[46:38] dread
[46:40] to render him anxious or distressed
[46:43] to perplex
[46:44] the mind of one by suggesting scruples
[46:48] or doubts
[46:50] and that's what the trouble that we're
[46:51] looking at tonight and i i believe that
[46:54] is very fitting for the time that we're
[46:56] living here
[46:57] uh there's a lot of inward commotion
[46:59] there's a lot of
[47:01] fear that is arising upon the land and
[47:03] there's a lot of
[47:05] restlessness and anxiousness and worry
[47:08] and perplexities of mind not knowing you
[47:11] know what's going to happen how it's
[47:12] going to be but he said let not your
[47:15] heart be troubled and and how could why
[47:17] and in making that statement he said
[47:19] because i go to prepare a place for you
[47:23] and that's why our heart can be at peace
[47:25] in this time of of trouble in this time
[47:27] of perplexity that this we know that
[47:30] this world is not our home but we have a
[47:32] place prepared to go
[47:34] and you know and then speaking of this
[47:36] he said he would say twice again and he
[47:39] would begin to speak about the comforter
[47:41] that he would sin and this comforter is
[47:44] someone that's summoned or called to be
[47:46] at one side
[47:48] it's called to be one's aide one who
[47:50] pleads in others calls before a judge or
[47:53] or a counsel for defense a legal
[47:56] assistant an advocate
[47:58] it's one who pleads as an intercessor so
[48:01] of christ as he would plead for us and
[48:04] pardon pleading with god for the
[48:06] pardoning of our sins in other words
[48:08] it's a helper
[48:10] aider assistant so the holy spirit is
[48:13] destined to take the place of christ in
[48:15] the apostles because he could not come
[48:18] in you as a man he had to come in you as
[48:21] a spirit
[48:22] amen so he would come to lead them amen
[48:25] into deeper knowledge of the truth to
[48:27] give them divine strength to hold them
[48:30] and enable them to undergo great trials
[48:33] and great persecutions on the behalf of
[48:35] his kingdom
[48:37] now i i got to looking at this thought
[48:39] on the most precious light and it came
[48:41] from a little statement that i saw said
[48:43] the most precious light is the one that
[48:46] comes in your darkest hour
[48:49] when you're in your darkest moment and
[48:50] your darkest time that's when life light
[48:54] is very precious to you you go through a
[48:56] desert water becomes very precious to
[48:59] you you might be at a place that you can
[49:01] have water at your fingertips right now
[49:03] and go to your sink and get water you
[49:05] can go uh to your refrigerator and pull
[49:08] up a bottle of water i mean why even
[49:10] right here i have water here available
[49:12] for me but you get into a desert you get
[49:14] into a place where there is no water one
[49:17] little drop becomes very precious to you
[49:20] and we find that in the in the darkness
[49:22] the darker it gets the more precious
[49:25] light is
[49:26] and we know that we have a precious
[49:28] light in this hour is the truth the
[49:30] revealed word of god amen not some man's
[49:33] theology not some man's ideas or man's
[49:36] creeds or dominance that he's dreamed up
[49:38] in some headquarters somewhere amen but
[49:40] it is the mind of god that has been
[49:42] revealed in our generation
[49:44] and it's a precious light and the darker
[49:46] it gets the more precious this light
[49:48] will be amen the darker it gets and the
[49:51] more anxiety comes the more fear comes
[49:54] the more precious the word of god is
[49:56] going to become to you because you can
[49:58] see as as the world is in turmoil in the
[50:01] world is in all kind of trouble and the
[50:03] world is all kind of fear i don't forget
[50:06] i was just looking up things that have
[50:07] happened since you know 2020 when covet
[50:11] hit how the explosion of anxiety has
[50:13] taken place the explosion of fear and
[50:16] the explosion of worry and the explosion
[50:19] of all those kind of things but in the
[50:20] middle of all of that you can still be
[50:23] at peace amen because we're not
[50:24] depending on if the world is at peace
[50:27] we're dependent on his kingdom amen
[50:29] because this world is not our kingdom so
[50:32] our peace is not depending upon whether
[50:34] the world is at peace or whether
[50:36] governments are at peace or whether
[50:38] things are working out all right that's
[50:40] not what our peace is based upon our
[50:43] peace is based upon i have gone to
[50:46] prepare you a place and if it was not so
[50:48] i would have told you but it is so
[50:51] therefore he told you i have a place
[50:53] prepared
[50:54] for you amen and so in the moment of
[50:56] darkness in the moment of great darkness
[50:59] and that's where we're at as is getting
[51:01] darker and darker and more evil and more
[51:04] evil all the time amen light is becoming
[51:07] more and more precious it's becoming
[51:10] more and more amen you right now you
[51:12] might go over there and you might flip a
[51:14] light switch anywhere in this building
[51:15] the light come on or at your home amen
[51:17] but you know how it is when you when
[51:19] your lights go out how precious light is
[51:21] to you there you don't think about it
[51:23] any time when you walk in a bedroom and
[51:25] just flip a light switch but how many
[51:26] times have you went into your dark
[51:28] bedroom the lights be out and you hit
[51:30] that switch and nothing happens it's
[51:32] because of something that's precious to
[51:34] you want to see or what you're going
[51:36] through you want to see where you're at
[51:38] and darkness is coming upon this earth
[51:40] and and i'm thankful that we have
[51:42] something to see by and we can see where
[51:45] we are we can see where we're going amen
[51:48] we're not blind as the blind leading the
[51:50] blind but we have eyes that can see we
[51:52] have a word that has illuminated our
[51:54] path and we can see where we're going we
[51:57] can see the things that are around us
[51:59] and all the things that are happening
[52:01] people are getting stirred up by russia
[52:03] all that they're doing that's only a
[52:04] pawn in the hand of god and they're only
[52:07] doing what god allows kingdoms are only
[52:09] doing what god allows him to do and you
[52:12] can see it written in the word therefore
[52:14] we don't have to get all tore up about
[52:15] it we don't have to get all disquiet and
[52:18] our emotions tore up about things that
[52:20] are going on because our emotions is not
[52:22] tied to fox news our emotions ain't good
[52:25] one day because the news is good but a
[52:27] matter of fact if you went by that your
[52:29] emotions would never be good because
[52:31] there's no good news out there in this
[52:33] world
[52:35] but there is some good news here tonight
[52:38] and we can stand upon the word of god
[52:40] and we can stand firmly we can stand at
[52:42] peace we can be at peace in our darkest
[52:45] hour because there is a light that is
[52:48] shining you know brother brandon would
[52:49] tell the story about carlsbad canyon or
[52:52] cavern and he talked about a man and a
[52:54] wife and a bunch of children that went
[52:56] there and they got down on the bottom of
[52:58] it and they turned the lights out and he
[53:00] said it was midnight dark down in there
[53:03] and he said they turned all the lights
[53:04] he said maya you could put your hand in
[53:06] front of your face and you couldn't see
[53:08] nothing have you ever ever experienced
[53:09] that i've been there in czech republic
[53:12] in a place like that he said there there
[53:14] was a little girl that was standing
[53:15] there and she began screaming oh help
[53:18] help screaming she was scared to death
[53:21] because it was so dark now in that
[53:23] moment light became very precious to her
[53:27] light became something that was more
[53:29] important than eminem's more important
[53:31] than a starburst more important than
[53:33] mcdonald's down the street she wanted
[53:35] light more than anything so she could
[53:37] see who was around the support thing
[53:39] began to grab and begin to scream begin
[53:42] to holler for a papa and mama and
[53:44] everything amen because she couldn't
[53:46] stand it it was so dark she had never
[53:49] seen such darkness and this is where
[53:51] you're seeing people at today the lights
[53:53] are going out and they're beginning to
[53:55] scream as we we could read about the ten
[53:58] virgins five wise and five fur foolish
[54:00] what was very important during that time
[54:03] it was light it was the oil the lamp to
[54:05] be burning amen it was a light to be
[54:08] burning amen this is where people are at
[54:11] they're finding themselves lost in
[54:13] darkness they don't know which way to go
[54:15] they don't know what to believe they
[54:17] don't know to believe this one or that
[54:18] one or the other but there is a truth
[54:21] amen there is a true genuine light
[54:24] that'll shine on every verse it'll shine
[54:26] on every scripture amen you don't have
[54:28] to take your bible and tear it halfway
[54:30] out because you don't believe it but
[54:32] there is a light of god that'll shine
[54:34] and make it illuminate every verse every
[54:37] scripture every line every book every
[54:40] promise

[54:54] screaming at the top of her voice about

[54:58] hysterical about that he said it's about
[55:00] like the little bride

[55:05] in that very moment her brother spoke up
[55:08] and said little sister don't fear
[55:12] maybe i can say that for you tonight
[55:14] little sister don't fear
[55:16] because he's standing right by the
[55:18] engineer he was right there and he saw
[55:20] the man as he saw what was taking place

[55:43] it might not be according to what you
[55:45] think or how you think is going to take
[55:46] place but there is somebody here who

[56:57] gentiles for my name say they'll have my
[57:00] name
[57:02] they'll have my name
[57:05] not the name of baptist not the name of
[57:07] methodist not the name of lutherans
[57:11] but the name of jesus christ
[57:15] for he is the light
[57:17] he is the truth
[57:19] he is the way and in him there's no
[57:22] darkness at all and he scatters the
[57:24] darkness when he comes in because he is
[57:26] the word
[57:28] bear with me for a minute the word is
[57:31] light
[57:33] because when he spoke it in the
[57:34] beginning he said let there be light
[57:37] that was the word that become light and
[57:39] when he speaks it the light of this age
[57:42] it'll light up
[57:45] he is the vindicated word he is
[57:47] absolutely the light in the time of
[57:50] darkness
[57:54] all these false glares and everything
[57:56] else is going to fade away yes sir he's
[57:58] here don't fear he will turn on the
[58:00] lights
[58:01] there is a man presence
[58:05] hallelujah i'm not talking about this
[58:07] man here or these men here or anybody
[58:10] else in this building and then i'm
[58:12] talking about there is a man his name is
[58:14] jesus christ and he is present
[58:19] we just heard him speak at the other
[58:20] wednesday night he's never left us he is
[58:23] in the midst of her and he's moving and
[58:26] he's orchestrated and he's making things
[58:28] happen and he's making things come to
[58:30] pass because he is present
[58:36] he's a never failing presence he's
[58:38] always there and he can always turn on
[58:41] the light he's just waiting to see what
[58:44] you're going to do
[58:46] are you going to scream out in fear or
[58:48] are you going to scream out in faith
[58:53] hallelujah he can he listen to this he
[58:55] said he's seeing what you're going to do
[58:57] he can flip the switch anytime he wants
[59:00] to
[59:03] so if you're sick tonight he can flip
[59:05] the switch anytime he wants to
[59:09] if you're depressed tonight he can flip
[59:11] the switch anytime he wants to if you're
[59:14] down in your delusion and you don't know
[59:15] where to turn to and you're full of fear
[59:18] and anxiety he can flip the switch
[59:23] hallelujah what does that do it turns
[59:26] the tide on the devil because in
[59:28] darkness devil hides in darkness he is
[59:31] there but when the light comes on it
[59:33] exposes him for who he is
[59:41] hallelujah i want to look at matthew 4
[59:43] and 13 and leaving nazareth he came and
[59:46] dwelt in capernaum which is upon the
[59:48] seacoast and the borders of zebulon and
[59:51] nephilim
[59:53] that it might be fulfilled which was
[59:55] spoken by isaias the prophet isaiah the
[59:57] prophet saying the land of zebulon and
[1:00:00] the land of nephilim by the way of the
[1:00:02] sea beyond jordan galilee of the
[1:00:04] gentiles the people which sat in
[1:00:07] darkness saw great light
[1:00:11] and to them which sat in the region and
[1:00:13] the shadow
[1:00:14] of death light is sprung up
[1:00:18] i got to looking into this while seeing
[1:00:20] why this prophecy was given over zebulon
[1:00:23] and naftali and actually if you look
[1:00:25] where they're at they're one of the
[1:00:27] outward lying areas in israel and
[1:00:30] they're closer to the gentiles and
[1:00:32] closer to attack and closer to being
[1:00:34] bombarded and closer to being invaded
[1:00:37] and you know not only that they're
[1:00:39] further away from the center of worship
[1:00:43] they're farther away from the movement
[1:00:45] of the spirit of god they're further
[1:00:48] away from the things but listen god
[1:00:50] don't always he won't leave you there if
[1:00:52] you're one of his children you may be
[1:00:54] sitting in darkness you may be sitting
[1:00:56] in disillusion you may not know which
[1:00:58] way is up and which way is down but
[1:01:00] those that sat in darkness they saw a
[1:01:03] great light because the light of god
[1:01:06] that came two thousand years ago born in
[1:01:08] a virgin walk down their street and
[1:01:11] begin to do miracles among them and
[1:01:13] signs and wonders happen and they begin
[1:01:15] to realize there's a light there's a god
[1:01:19] there's a man here who's more than a man
[1:01:24] hallelujah there is a man here that can
[1:01:27] turn on the lights
[1:01:29] amen those who sat in the regions of the
[1:01:32] shadow of death some of them under
[1:01:34] cancer
[1:01:37] hallelujah some of them under the death
[1:01:39] of denomination some under their creeds
[1:01:41] of death some on untraditional death all
[1:01:44] kinds of death but they saw a great
[1:01:47] light
[1:01:48] hallelujah a man that flashed the lights
[1:01:51] on is the same one that said let there
[1:01:53] be light and he's the same yesterday
[1:01:56] today and forever he can still turn on
[1:01:58] the lights don't get scared
[1:02:02] hallelujah you say well what about this
[1:02:04] out there don't get scared
[1:02:06] what about this trouble over here don't
[1:02:08] get scared what about all of this over
[1:02:10] here don't get scared
[1:02:15] he's the same god
[1:02:17] when persecution comes
[1:02:19] don't get scared
[1:02:22] there is a light
[1:02:24] he said he's going to catch his people
[1:02:26] away
[1:02:27] listen to this she'll not go through the
[1:02:29] tribulation she'll never do it
[1:02:33] he said she wouldn't
[1:02:35] she'll be caught away how's they gonna
[1:02:38] do that brother branham looks awful dark
[1:02:40] no matter how dark it is you two you
[1:02:42] can't see your hand before you just
[1:02:44] remember there's a man who can flip the
[1:02:47] switch
[1:02:48] and rapture the church
[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:02:52] hallelujah tomorrow might be your
[1:02:54] darkest day but don't you ever forget it
[1:02:57] could be the same day that the flip the
[1:02:59] light the switches flip and you step out
[1:03:02] of this whole mortality into immortality
[1:03:05] you step out of that old ragged body
[1:03:08] into a new body you step out of that
[1:03:10] depression into happiness you step out
[1:03:13] of cancer into healing you step out of
[1:03:16] backslidden condition to being on fire
[1:03:18] for god he knows how to flip the switch
[1:03:23] i say god tonight flip the switch
[1:03:28] there's some depressed here tonight flip
[1:03:30] the switch there's those that's got fear
[1:03:32] and anxiety in their life flip the
[1:03:34] switch there's backslidden about it flip
[1:03:37] the switch
[1:03:43] don't get away there is a man
[1:03:45] [Applause]
[1:03:52] this man stays with us
[1:03:54] no matter if it's dark
[1:03:56] notice the engineer didn't leave the
[1:03:57] building
[1:04:00] he said
[1:04:01] where's that at psalms 42 8 by day the
[1:04:04] lord directs his love
[1:04:05] at night
[1:04:07] his song is with me
[1:04:11] hallelujah
[1:04:12] he will light our past through darkness
[1:04:14] you're in second samuel 22 and verse 29
[1:04:17] you lord are my lamp
[1:04:19] the lord turns my darkness into light
[1:04:25] and psalms 91 5 and 6 says you will not
[1:04:27] fear the terror of night nor the
[1:04:30] pestilence that stalks in the darkness
[1:04:34] hallelujah
[1:04:36] the pestilence that stalks is what they
[1:04:37] walketh in darkness stalks in the
[1:04:40] darkness
[1:04:41] he says a roaring lion stalking seeing
[1:04:43] me who who he made of fire
[1:04:46] same bed trying to see who he's going to
[1:04:47] destroy who he's going to pull away but
[1:04:50] there's an angel of god that encamps
[1:04:52] about those that fear him and that angel
[1:04:55] has the power over the light and over
[1:04:57] the darkness
[1:05:00] hallelujah

[1:05:27] anxieties he's already faced worries and
[1:05:30] doubts
[1:05:32] he's already faced complexes
[1:05:37] you don't think he had complex as sure

[1:05:41] he was human and he was telling him all
[1:05:43] the time he was born in an out of an
[1:05:46] adultery such an adulterous situation he
[1:05:49] had to face those complexes

[1:06:11] that does now shine within us
[1:06:13] is held in a perishable container
[1:06:17] that is in our weak bodies
[1:06:20] everyone can see that the glorious power
[1:06:23] we're in must be from god and is not our
[1:06:26] own
[1:06:28] hallelujah that's why the light that's
[1:06:30] in you hasn't went out because it's not

[1:06:36] since the beginning of time
[1:06:39] amen when there wasn't even a world that
[1:06:41] light of eternity is what has been
[1:06:43] deposited in those who's got the holy
[1:06:45] ghost therefore the devil can blow at it
[1:06:48] he can push at it he can come try to put
[1:06:50] it out he can do everything he can and

[1:10:21] that light's still giving out
[1:10:23] it's still moving
[1:10:25] it's still having something of some
[1:10:27] effect
[1:10:32] it's in the darkest hour
[1:10:34] is the most precious light
[1:10:38] so god
[1:10:40] would put
[1:10:41] the most precious
[1:10:42] in the darkest
[1:10:47] do you hear that
[1:10:49] i ain't nobody
[1:10:50] you're most precious
[1:10:55] he's waited
[1:10:56] 2000 years
[1:10:58] and it's got as dark
[1:11:00] as it's ever going to get
[1:11:02] and getting darker
[1:11:03] but yet all down through midden over to
[1:11:06] bosu louisiana texas all over the united
[1:11:09] states
[1:11:10] all over the world there's these little
[1:11:12] lights
[1:11:15] and he's looking let me tell you what
[1:11:16] he's doing god is looking over the
[1:11:18] banister as he did for those three
[1:11:20] hebrew children and he's looking down
[1:11:22] look at that precious
[1:11:27] look at that precious light
[1:11:29] you're precious in his eyes
[1:11:34] you think sometimes god doesn't care
[1:11:36] about you god cares everything about you
[1:11:44] you get in those kind of situations
[1:11:46] it's in dark times you think people
[1:11:48] don't care people don't understand
[1:11:49] people don't want to know me about
[1:11:53] darkness
[1:11:55] there's many of them through the
[1:11:56] scriptures they came to that moment
[1:11:59] very familiar
[1:12:01] but we know
[1:12:02] the family of lazarus came to that
[1:12:04] moment
[1:12:05] came to a very dark time in their life
[1:12:08] they call for jesus their brother's sick
[1:12:11] and their friend
[1:12:12] the one they're claiming to be the
[1:12:13] messiah goes the opposite direction
[1:12:18] could you imagine the post that was
[1:12:20] going to be on facebook if it was today
[1:12:24] i just gotta rant tell somebody
[1:12:27] no you don't
[1:12:32] don't have to tell nobody tell jesus
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:37] when jesus came along
[1:12:40] that in that dark hour
[1:12:42] he said he comes he said that's him
[1:12:45] it's in the dark moment
[1:12:47] that the light is precious
[1:12:49] he lets it happen that way
[1:12:51] the darkest of hour then jesus comes
[1:12:53] along
[1:12:54] why
[1:12:55] because his presence
[1:12:57] always brings hope
[1:13:01] that's why it's very important to fight
[1:13:04] for the presence of god to be free in a
[1:13:06] service
[1:13:08] we want a service with hope
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:12] amen the darkest hour
[1:13:15] his presence always brings new hope he
[1:13:18] said it may be the darkest hour for some
[1:13:20] tonight
[1:13:21] the doctor has given you up with cancer
[1:13:24] the man has done all he can to save you
[1:13:26] your life but it's beyond his knowledge
[1:13:29] it's beyond his reach he has no more to
[1:13:31] work with he's done all he can do you're
[1:13:33] going to die it might be the darkest
[1:13:35] hour you ever seen but remember it's in
[1:13:38] the moments when he's there to flip the
[1:13:40] switch
[1:13:42] that's when he comes to bring new hope
[1:13:45] it brings new hopes when he comes his
[1:13:47] presence always brings hope
[1:13:52] martha you know she she had seen enough
[1:13:54] out of jesus to know he was god's
[1:13:56] representative that day but they watch
[1:13:59] him as he walks away and he travels
[1:14:01] further and further and further and they
[1:14:03] watching on the other hand his brother
[1:14:04] brother going down down down down until
[1:14:06] he takes his last breath
[1:14:08] and they go have a funeral
[1:14:10] and one day jesus still ain't there two
[1:14:12] days
[1:14:13] three days
[1:14:14] four days
[1:14:16] martha hears he's coming
[1:14:18] and she goes out to meet him
[1:14:21] you know brother brother said should
[1:14:22] have had a right to
[1:14:24] say something maybe
[1:14:26] why didn't you come
[1:14:28] why why
[1:14:30] we sent for you
[1:14:32] we left our own churches we left
[1:14:34] everything
[1:14:36] and then we get in this situation
[1:14:39] we've done all of this look what we've
[1:14:42] done
[1:14:43] he said that's a lot of people's
[1:14:44] attitude look what i've done look what
[1:14:46] i've given up
[1:14:49] he said it ain't about what you've done
[1:14:51] it's what he's already done for you
[1:14:55] matter of fact all you ever done you're
[1:14:57] still unworthy
[1:15:02] but she didn't do that she ran to him
[1:15:05] and she began to move out there and said
[1:15:08] you know he if i'd have been here my
[1:15:09] brother would not have died
[1:15:12] but even now lord
[1:15:16] even now that no matter how bad the
[1:15:18] situation is you know even now
[1:15:23] yes lord he said well thy brother will
[1:15:25] rise again yeah lord at the last day of
[1:15:26] the general resurrection he's a good boy
[1:15:28] he served you he said i am the
[1:15:31] resurrection and the life
[1:15:33] he was wanting to bring her to right now
[1:15:36] amen after turned her down how could a
[1:15:38] man that's a resurrection life ever
[1:15:40] treat a friend like that
[1:15:45] that's a good question
[1:15:47] sometimes
[1:15:48] he's just testing you
[1:15:51] to see what you're going to do
[1:15:55] to see how you're going to react
[1:15:57] to see how what's going to happen what's
[1:15:59] going to really come out of you
[1:16:02] because you know we can put on all kind
[1:16:04] of facades
[1:16:06] especially in a good happy moment
[1:16:09] things are going good and we're jumping
[1:16:11] and shouting and having a good time and
[1:16:13] we're just hallelujah glory to god but
[1:16:15] all of a sudden we have a bad day
[1:16:19] and we sit and we want to make sure
[1:16:20] everybody knows we had a bad day it
[1:16:23] ain't nothing about wrong you don't have
[1:16:24] bad days you don't have to let everybody
[1:16:26] know you had a bad day
[1:16:30] amen you know you got to put your heart
[1:16:33] into it no matter what you want
[1:16:35] something from god you got to put
[1:16:36] everything you got into it
[1:16:39] amen come to even now lord

[1:16:45] i've done this i've had this i've had
[1:16:46] that i'm i don't know how am i going to
[1:16:48] get it even now lord
[1:16:51] even right now in my bad day you can
[1:16:54] come and minister to me
[1:16:56] you can come and meet me
[1:17:06] put the thing before you sometimes he
[1:17:08] does to see just what you're going to do
[1:17:09] with it
[1:17:10] he might do that
[1:17:12] he's been doing it just to see what
[1:17:14] you'll do about it
[1:17:17] we find out that when this was done she
[1:17:19] said i believe you are the son of god
[1:17:20] that was coming to the world that's
[1:17:22] exactly what he had confessed
[1:17:25] and even now though my brother is dead
[1:17:26] though he's embalmed though he's buried
[1:17:28] though he's stinking in the grave even
[1:17:30] now whatsoever he asks god god to give
[1:17:32] it to you there you are that's the
[1:17:34] keynote she believed in what he said
[1:17:37] she believed in what he asked even
[1:17:39] though it was dark around her this light
[1:17:41] that stood before her was very precious
[1:17:45] this moment with him was very precious
[1:17:48] this time with him was very precious it
[1:17:50] was the difference between life and
[1:17:53] death
[1:18:01] you say well
[1:18:02] the doctor turned me down and said he
[1:18:03] couldn't do no more even now
[1:18:08] i haven't walked for years even now
[1:18:11] i haven't moved in years even now
[1:18:14] amen even now he's there sitting on the
[1:18:16] right hand of god making new sessions
[1:18:18] upon your confession even now i mean if
[1:18:21] you ask you shall receive
[1:18:24] even now no wonder he said thy brother
[1:18:27] shall rise again he said i am the
[1:18:29] resurrection life he that believeth in
[1:18:31] me though he were dead yet he shall live
[1:18:33] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:18:34] shall never die believeth thou this
[1:18:38] and she said lord yeah i believe it
[1:18:42] now he said notice when he spoke and she
[1:18:45] responded in that matter he said what
[1:18:47] was it you have real faith and your
[1:18:50] faith goes to that word cogs go together
[1:18:53] and the will starts to turn something is
[1:18:56] going to take place
[1:18:58] something is going to happen because
[1:19:01] faith has responded to the word
[1:19:05] the word was precious and faith went out
[1:19:09] and said i believe what you said i
[1:19:11] believe you can do it even now i believe
[1:19:13] you're the same yesterday i believe it
[1:19:16] with all my heart
[1:19:19] even now
[1:19:24] you know to make a light happen
[1:19:26] it takes two coming together
[1:19:29] can't just come off a one it takes two
[1:19:33] it takes a ground and a positive it
[1:19:36] takes two are neutral and a positive it
[1:19:38] takes two coming together to make light
[1:19:41] and if they come together the dynamos
[1:19:43] together it'll make light it'll make
[1:19:46] faith it'll make power it'll make
[1:19:47] healing it'll make whatever the promises
[1:19:49] of god come to pass because it becomes
[1:19:52] in line the only thing you have to do to
[1:19:54] get electricity is push the button
[1:19:58] that's all you have to do when the
[1:20:00] scripture is supposed to be fulfilled
[1:20:01] now press the button don't be afraid
[1:20:06] hallelujah that's what's the matter with
[1:20:08] people he said i've seen two classes of
[1:20:10] people one who has money in the bank but
[1:20:12] they don't know how to write a check one
[1:20:14] that has a check but they don't have no
[1:20:15] they know how to write a check but they
[1:20:16] don't have no money in the bank
[1:20:19] that don't ever do you any good
[1:20:21] one or the other
[1:20:23] you can have all the money in the world
[1:20:24] and you don't know how to write out a
[1:20:25] check or you have nothing to know how to
[1:20:27] write a check you can write them all you
[1:20:28] want to
[1:20:30] they'll bounce as high as a ceiling
[1:20:32] but if you can ever get that together
[1:20:35] and he said i believe there's a people
[1:20:36] that's got that together
[1:20:40] not only has the ability to write the
[1:20:42] check but also has the ability amen the
[1:20:46] money in the bank ask anything in my
[1:20:48] father's name it'll happen she had heard
[1:20:51] him and she said he's right i am the
[1:20:53] resurrection life i believe with all my
[1:20:55] heart even when all hope was gone
[1:21:00] she wasn't saying this when it looked
[1:21:02] like something good was about to happen
[1:21:05] she didn't know what was about to happen
[1:21:10] this word was coming out of her before
[1:21:12] she ever saw one move of lazarus body
[1:21:16] before she ever saw anything happen at
[1:21:18] that tomb words were already coming out
[1:21:20] of her mouth i believe it
[1:21:23] i believe it and that's the way you got
[1:21:25] to be
[1:21:26] many times we like to wait till we see a
[1:21:28] symptom go down or so you know something
[1:21:30] happen or a rock move or something's
[1:21:32] going on amen then we say oh i believe
[1:21:33] it i know you got to start saying it
[1:21:35] with your mouth you got to start
[1:21:37] speaking it you got to start confessing
[1:21:39] it and saying i know it's true and i
[1:21:41] know he's true and i know his word is
[1:21:44] true i know he won't let it fall to the
[1:21:46] ground what he said will come to pass
[1:21:48] and i'm going to ask him i'm going to
[1:21:50] push the button
[1:21:55] even now lord
[1:21:57] in that dark hour
[1:21:59] resurrection life took place

[1:23:28] you we know god's blessings on you we
[1:23:31] can see it all and then all of a sudden
[1:23:33] it switched
[1:23:35] he lost his children he lost his wealth
[1:23:38] he lost his home he lost everything amen
[1:23:41] until he came to a part in his life he's
[1:23:44] sitting on an ash heap scraping balls
[1:23:48] darkness was all around him and closing
[1:23:51] in on him
[1:23:53] but job just stayed right with it
[1:23:55] brother reynolds said he said he didn't
[1:23:57] move away because he knew i had offered
[1:23:59] a sacrifice
[1:24:02] i had done all that god had provide
[1:24:04] required therefore i'd done it and god
[1:24:06] it was up to god to bring it to pass but
[1:24:08] he finds himself in that situation and
[1:24:11] even to where his wife turns against him
[1:24:14] and job said job you're miserable why
[1:24:16] don't you just curse god and die the
[1:24:18] death
[1:24:20] look what he said he didn't call her a
[1:24:22] foolish woman he said thou speak is like
[1:24:25] a foolish woman
[1:24:26] in other words you speak
[1:24:28] foolish the lord gave and the lord
[1:24:32] taketh away blessed be the name of the
[1:24:34] lord
[1:24:38] you know listen to that i thought this
[1:24:40] was a very wonderful wonderful lesson
[1:24:41] right he said he knew he had influenced
[1:24:44] people he knew his life had been useful
[1:24:47] he said see god never gives us our life
[1:24:50] just to hang around and we do this and
[1:24:53] we do that he give it to be useful to
[1:24:55] him
[1:24:58] do something
[1:25:00] tell somebody if you can't talk whistle
[1:25:03] him
[1:25:07] do something for him do something that
[1:25:10] god knows your life is fulfilling his
[1:25:14] purpose
[1:25:18] and job began to look at the flowers and
[1:25:20] how they die and there's a resurrection
[1:25:22] the tree it goes down and out of its
[1:25:24] roots burst up new trees and he said but
[1:25:26] a man layeth down and he giveth up the
[1:25:29] ghost
[1:25:30] and he's
[1:25:31] his sons come to honor him and then he's
[1:25:34] just as dust and he's gone what about
[1:25:36] this
[1:25:37] he couldn't understand it how could a
[1:25:39] man have much that was much more
[1:25:41] glorious than a flower much more
[1:25:43] glorious than a tree built in the very
[1:25:45] image of god yet he's planted in the
[1:25:47] ground and that settled it
[1:25:55] he's getting darker
[1:25:56] he's questioning more he's wondering
[1:25:59] more what about this what about that
[1:26:02] what about this when all this distress
[1:26:04] comes
[1:26:06] all of his friends turned their back on
[1:26:07] him
[1:26:10] accused him of being a secret sinner
[1:26:12] his wife turned away from him the bible
[1:26:14] said his breath was strange to his wife
[1:26:18] all the things that happened to him
[1:26:20] looked like god had turned him
[1:26:22] completely down
[1:26:25] but then all one in another chapter god
[1:26:27] comes and speaks to him says job i want
[1:26:29] you to gird up your loins i have to i'm
[1:26:32] going to have a talk with you
[1:26:34] you see the tree never sin the flower
[1:26:36] never sin it served my purpose there was
[1:26:39] dramatized one to another it didn't sin
[1:26:41] so it arise up again but as man sin
[1:26:43] therefore he's cut off and job began to
[1:26:46] wonder all these things distresses and
[1:26:47] the darkest hour but all of a sudden
[1:26:50] god began to speak to him and begin to
[1:26:52] show him but
[1:26:54] man's hope is not out
[1:26:57] he might be cut off but i want you to
[1:26:59] look past the grave joke i want you to
[1:27:01] look past the trouble job i want you to
[1:27:03] look past the darkness and god took him
[1:27:06] up to a place to where he could look
[1:27:08] thousands of years down the road and he
[1:27:10] could see a man called jesus bear his
[1:27:13] old sins up to a cross and he said
[1:27:16] i shall know him my redeemer liveth
[1:27:23] though these skin won't destroy my body
[1:27:25] yet in my flesh i shall see god
[1:27:30] it was in his darkest moments
[1:27:33] god revealed himself to him
[1:27:42] he began to look up
[1:27:44] in this vision he's caught up in
[1:27:46] lightnings and thunders
[1:27:48] and he's seen him in the last days
[1:27:55] i know my redeemer liveth
[1:27:58] in the last days he'll stand upon this
[1:28:00] earth
[1:28:01] though the skin worms destroy this body
[1:28:04] yet in my flesh
[1:28:06] shall i see god
[1:28:09] the darkest hour
[1:28:11] was when god
[1:28:12] could show him
[1:28:14] the last days
[1:28:20] we got tons of others moses
[1:28:23] pretty got pretty dark on moses
[1:28:25] he tried and killed an egyptian ran out
[1:28:29] got on the backside of a desert
[1:28:32] away from god thousand miles a million
[1:28:34] miles away
[1:28:37] but all of a sudden in that dark hour he
[1:28:39] saw a light
[1:28:42] and it goes to that light and we know
[1:28:43] the scriptures and i'm not going to go
[1:28:45] through all of these very very deeply
[1:28:47] but
[1:28:48] he finds himself
[1:28:51] and it so changes his thinking
[1:28:54] to where he's not not even thinking like
[1:28:56] a normal man thought anymore
[1:29:00] in that dark moment he saw a light
[1:29:03] and that light spoke out of him and
[1:29:04] began to reveal who he truly was
[1:29:07] and what
[1:29:08] that light became very precious to moses
[1:29:12] because he had been in a lot of darkness
[1:29:14] he had no doubt had all kind of
[1:29:16] complexes and things he had been
[1:29:17] fighting for 40 years
[1:29:20] why didn't this i
[1:29:21] i thought it was going to be this way
[1:29:23] why didn't it be this how how was all
[1:29:25] how is
[1:29:27] how is god going to do it
[1:29:28] how is he going how in the world i tried
[1:29:31] i tried to take it i tried to and all i
[1:29:33] did was kill some of my own brothers
[1:29:35] turned against me and here i'm out i
[1:29:36] ain't heard from god in 40 years all of
[1:29:38] a sudden he looks and there's a light
[1:29:41] that light was precious enough to him
[1:29:44] that he walked up there to see what it
[1:29:45] was all about
[1:29:50] hello somebody and if i understand
[1:29:53] correctly the scriptures
[1:29:56] bear with me if i'm wrong
[1:29:58] but the scripture talks about gathering
[1:30:00] together even the much more you see that
[1:30:02] day approaching
[1:30:04] why because he said where two or three
[1:30:06] are gathered i'll be there
[1:30:08] so you got to get to where the light is
[1:30:10] more precious to you than the darkness
[1:30:16] because if the darkness is more precious
[1:30:18] you'll stay home
[1:30:20] maybe i'm talking to somebody streaming
[1:30:22] right now you'll stay home as i got no
[1:30:25] you're staying home because there's
[1:30:26] darkness
[1:30:28] but if the light will come become more
[1:30:29] precious you'll leave those babbling
[1:30:32] sheep and old things around you and your
[1:30:34] work and everything you've got to gather
[1:30:36] to the light
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:40] god has a way of forcing the issue
[1:30:43] sometimes
[1:30:45] to make you come face to face with the
[1:30:48] light
[1:30:53] you know jairus in the bible he came to
[1:30:55] that moment
[1:30:57] he tried to divert away from me tried to
[1:30:59] out still be on the outskirts he tried
[1:31:01] to you know try to
[1:31:03] sidestep the issue tried to but all of a
[1:31:05] sudden his little girl got sick
[1:31:08] and something became very precious to
[1:31:10] him
[1:31:13] light becomes very precious than
[1:31:14] darkness
[1:31:16] well you can have the you can have money
[1:31:18] in the bank and you can have everything
[1:31:20] going your way and all of a sudden
[1:31:22] things begin to turn
[1:31:24] and all of a sudden you realize man the
[1:31:25] house of god
[1:31:27] is precious to me
[1:31:29] i i it didn't take me very many services
[1:31:31] to realize how pressure it was to me and
[1:31:33] covet
[1:31:34] that sealed the deal
[1:31:38] it was precious to me to come together
[1:31:40] with the children of god it was precious
[1:31:43] to me to hear the word of god come
[1:31:45] service after service and the spirit of
[1:31:47] god move and me be free that's precious
[1:31:49] to me
[1:31:51] it's precious to me to sit in his
[1:31:53] presence and bask in the glow of the
[1:31:55] holy ghost it's precious to me to be in
[1:31:58] that atmosphere
[1:32:01] i think about it men will pay thousands
[1:32:04] and thousands of dollars to get a
[1:32:06] courtside seat to watch a man run up and
[1:32:08] down a court or watch something happen
[1:32:10] or pay thousand thousand dollars to go
[1:32:12] kill a big trophy amen but what should
[1:32:15] be precious to us is this life
[1:32:19] amen their jobs become more precious all
[1:32:22] kinds of things around i didn't expect
[1:32:23] it to go here but we're going amen
[1:32:25] things become more precious but this is
[1:32:27] the most precious thing you'll ever come
[1:32:30] in contact with
[1:32:33] amen you can stack the gold to the
[1:32:35] ceiling and out the door it'll never
[1:32:37] compare to what this word of god can do
[1:32:40] for you
[1:32:43] hallelujah
[1:32:45] man has been looking for the fountain of
[1:32:47] you he's so kingdom so look for the
[1:32:49] fountain of you he has sold everything
[1:32:51] he's burned boats he's tried to conquer
[1:32:54] all kinds of things countries and
[1:32:55] everything else killed people for the
[1:32:57] fountain of you but we have it tonight
[1:33:00] we have a fountain we there is a
[1:33:03] fountain open in the house of david
[1:33:06] it ought to be precious to us amen i
[1:33:08] think about even david himself how many
[1:33:11] drinks he used to take from bethlehem
[1:33:13] but one day he got away from it and
[1:33:15] there was a philistine army all the way
[1:33:17] around it and something began to cry out
[1:33:19] i want a drink
[1:33:21] that dream became very precious to him
[1:33:25] and let me tell you something if you
[1:33:27] find yourself in the tribulation you're
[1:33:29] going to wish this was precious
[1:33:32] you're going to waste the services that
[1:33:33] you stayed away from what's more
[1:33:35] precious to you
[1:33:37] listen this ain't me this is god crying
[1:33:39] out right now amen you're gonna wish
[1:33:42] that you'd have gave your all you're
[1:33:44] gonna wish i'd have gave everything to
[1:33:46] be there
[1:33:52] god i get you there somehow
[1:34:06] the darkest hour
[1:34:11] jairus was walking down
[1:34:18] he finds the lord jesus
[1:34:21] he said well you come pray for my
[1:34:22] daughter
[1:34:25] takes him
[1:34:26] begins to walk down the road towards his
[1:34:28] house just as hard as he can go
[1:34:30] so please lay your hands on my child
[1:34:31] come lay your hands and she'll live
[1:34:34] now
[1:34:35] this light
[1:34:37] was more precious
[1:34:38] than his sect of pharisees
[1:34:42] and things that he had held on to for
[1:34:44] thou
[1:34:45] all of his lifetime
[1:34:47] traditions of men
[1:34:49] he found something more precious
[1:34:52] and he's willing to do whatever it took
[1:34:55] to get to him
[1:34:57] because it was dark
[1:35:00] he was in a dark time of his life and
[1:35:02] his baby was dying
[1:35:05] i got to get to jesus
[1:35:08] maybe that wasn't a thought
[1:35:09] three days with prior
[1:35:12] maybe he even said a few scornful things
[1:35:14] i don't know
[1:35:15] mocked him made fun of him but all of a
[1:35:17] sudden his daughter gets sick he's like
[1:35:20] i got to get to jesus so something
[1:35:22] flipped
[1:35:24] something changed to where he didn't no
[1:35:26] longer care what the pharisees thought
[1:35:28] about him he didn't no longer care what
[1:35:30] his family thought about him he didn't
[1:35:32] no longer care what anybody thought
[1:35:34] about him i got to get to jesus listen
[1:35:38] god knows how to get you to that spot
[1:35:41] amen he finds himself in that place and
[1:35:43] then he starts walking towards his road
[1:35:45] with his child with jesus and the news
[1:35:47] comes she's died it gets darker
[1:35:53] and i said i can see jesus look at him
[1:35:55] did i not tell you fear not
[1:35:57] you'll see the glory of the lord
[1:36:01] i imagine his heart went to beating
[1:36:02] right
[1:36:03] right back went up the road
[1:36:05] oh she's dead she's asleep and jesus
[1:36:08] said she's not dead she's asleep
[1:36:10] and they begin to laugh and make fun we
[1:36:12] heard you were crazy now we know you are
[1:36:14] he said get get get get all the
[1:36:16] unbelievers out
[1:36:18] get them out i can't do nothing with you
[1:36:19] unbelievers sitting here put them all
[1:36:21] out and he walked over to the child and
[1:36:22] said rise up
[1:36:24] and the darkest hour death has struck
[1:36:26] the home jesus walked in and light came
[1:36:29] on
[1:36:31] hallelujah when his little girl was sick
[1:36:33] he didn't wait like nicodemus for a
[1:36:35] private interview his need was right
[1:36:38] then he had to get an action right then
[1:36:41] and the same is right now if there's
[1:36:44] ever a time you want to get healed right
[1:36:47] now is the time if there's ever a time
[1:36:50] you want to get saved right now is the
[1:36:52] time if there's ever a time you want the
[1:36:55] holy ghost right now is the time don't
[1:36:58] wait for another time right now is a
[1:37:01] time of action
[1:37:04] he got desperate
[1:37:05] and jesus came and he called her from
[1:37:07] the dead
[1:37:10] there was another man named zacchaeus
[1:37:13] he was in a real dark place
[1:37:15] his wife was even facing darkness even
[1:37:18] though she was a believer praying
[1:37:21] here zacchaeus had his own sect again of
[1:37:24] religion and
[1:37:25] businessman
[1:37:27] had the wealth of things and going on
[1:37:29] with rebecca's wife a believer in the
[1:37:31] lord jesus
[1:37:33] said he didn't believe it himself
[1:37:34] because the rabbi told him there's no
[1:37:36] more prophets
[1:37:37] wayne had prophets knows a bunch of
[1:37:39] nonsense don't you ever believe in
[1:37:41] nothing like that you're too fine
[1:37:42] cultured of a man to believe that your
[1:37:44] business just go about and do your
[1:37:45] business
[1:37:48] but you said you know
[1:37:50] rebecca
[1:37:51] had prayed
[1:37:55] don't ever give up on your prayers
[1:38:00] don't ever give up on your prayers
[1:38:03] he said she prayed until her little
[1:38:05] heart was about to break
[1:38:08] she wanted
[1:38:09] him to meet jesus
[1:38:12] and that morning zacchaeus decides you
[1:38:14] know what i'm gonna go up and see what
[1:38:15] this is all about
[1:38:17] he was a man of little stature
[1:38:19] about brother joe's height maybe a
[1:38:21] little shorter
[1:38:22] just couldn't see past most of the crowd
[1:38:24] so i'm gonna find out if he's truly a
[1:38:26] prophet or not i'm gonna see if he's
[1:38:27] just like any other man so he climbs up
[1:38:29] a tree and pulls some leaves around him
[1:38:32] so he passes by i'll see him and as
[1:38:34] jesus began to pass by walking down the
[1:38:37] street he got right under the tree
[1:38:40] right to the place right to the mark and
[1:38:43] he looks up and he says zacchaeus come
[1:38:46] down
[1:38:46] i'm going to your house
[1:38:50] oh may that be a service you can have
[1:38:52] tonight that jesus would come to your
[1:38:54] hiding spot where you've been hiding and
[1:38:56] you've been hiding behind complexes
[1:38:59] you've been hiding behind fears you've
[1:39:01] been hiding behind things in your life
[1:39:03] but tonight i'm coming to your house
[1:39:06] tonight i'm coming to where you are and
[1:39:08] i'm going to call you by your real name
[1:39:12] the devil's calling you fear the devil's
[1:39:15] calling you anxiety he's calling you
[1:39:17] depression he's calling you complexes
[1:39:19] but i'm calling you the bride of jesus
[1:39:22] christ and i'm going to your house
[1:39:26] it's a dark moment
[1:39:28] but it came by
[1:39:32] we get in dark spots
[1:39:35] we could talk about the woman at the
[1:39:37] with the blood issue and all that she
[1:39:39] had to press through
[1:39:41] the woman at the well and all she had to
[1:39:43] press through
[1:39:48] i want to end it on this one
[1:39:51] dark moment
[1:39:53] because we're on a ship
[1:39:56] it's called the ship of zion
[1:40:02] one night the disciples was on the sea
[1:40:06] all hope was gone
[1:40:08] maybe you're sitting there tonight
[1:40:11] in that same place on the boat
[1:40:16] seems like all hopes are gone
[1:40:18] boats water logged it's going down they
[1:40:20] were screaming and crying they'd went
[1:40:22] away without him
[1:40:24] they were scared
[1:40:26] they didn't know what to do and here he
[1:40:27] came walking on the sea
[1:40:31] do you understand that
[1:40:33] he uses the very thing that's trying to
[1:40:35] kill you to come to you
[1:40:40] the very thing that was trying to drown
[1:40:42] them he comes walking over it
[1:40:47] cancer to him is only a footpath
[1:40:53] situations in your life that's why you
[1:40:55] that's why you have them it's because he
[1:40:57] uses them to walk to you
[1:41:00] he uses them to come to where you're at
[1:41:03] so he can move and you might be in the
[1:41:05] darkness but all of a sudden you can
[1:41:07] look in the middle of that darkness and
[1:41:08] you see a light glow and it starts
[1:41:10] getting brighter and brighter and
[1:41:12] brighter as it's walking down the very
[1:41:14] thing
[1:41:16] the waves and the winds were trying to
[1:41:18] destroy them fear and anxiety and all
[1:41:21] kinds of things were happening that
[1:41:22] little boat was like a little bottle
[1:41:24] topper looked like nothing out there on
[1:41:26] let's see but all of a sudden here comes
[1:41:28] somebody walking on it
[1:41:30] man if i don't give you confidence
[1:41:32] tonight to know that no matter what
[1:41:33] trouble you have god can walk on it
[1:41:37] oh hallelujah did you feel that no
[1:41:40] matter what you're facing tonight god
[1:41:43] can walk on it
[1:41:47] i'll say it like this no matter what has
[1:41:50] your child bound tonight god can walk on
[1:41:53] it
[1:41:54] god will use it to get to where they are
[1:41:59] hallelujah and jesus is the same today
[1:42:02] as he ever was amen he's a man walking
