[40:09] Revelations 5 and verse one and said I
[40:12] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[40:15] the throne a book written within and on
[40:19] the backside sealed with Seven Seals and
[40:22] I saw a normal angel or a weak angel no
[40:28] a strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[40:31] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[40:35] the loose the seals thereof it didn't
[40:37] even say I saw an angel he said I saw a
[40:41] strong Angel and no man in Heaven Nor on
[40:43] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[40:45] to open the book neither to look there
[40:47] on and I wept much because no man was
[40:50] found worthy to open and to read the
[40:51] book neither to look there on and one of
[40:54] the elders said to me weep not behold
[40:57] the lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[40:59] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[41:02] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[41:04] and I beheld and low in the midst of the
[41:07] throne and the four beasts in the midst
[41:09] of the elders stood a lamb as it had
[41:11] been slain having seven horns and seven
[41:14] eyes which are the seven spirits of God
[41:16] sent forth into all the Earth and he
[41:19] came and took the book out of the right
[41:20] hand of him the S of the throne and when
[41:22] he had taken the book The Four beasts
[41:24] and four and 20 Elders fell down before
[41:26] the lamb having every one of them Harps
[41:29] and golden vows full of odors which are
[41:31] the prayers of the Saints and they sung
[41:34] a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to
[41:36] take the book and to open the seals
[41:38] thereof for thou was slain and H has
[41:41] been redeemed and has redeemed us to God
[41:43] by their blood out of every Kindred
[41:45] tongue people and nation and it made
[41:48] unto us un made made us unto our God
[41:51] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[41:53] the earth and I beheld and heard the
[41:55] voice of many angels round about the
[41:57] throne and the beasts and the elders and
[41:59] the number of them 10 was 10 times 10
[42:02] thousands times 10 thousands and
[42:04] thousands of thousands saying with a
[42:06] loud voice Worthy is a lamb that was
[42:08] slain to receive power and riches and
[42:11] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[42:13] and blessing to every creature which is
[42:16] in heaven and on the earth and under the
[42:18] Earth and such as are in the sea and all
[42:21] that are in them heard I say in blessing
[42:24] and honor and glory and power be unto
[42:26] him that sth upon this throne and the
[42:30] lamb forever and ever and the four
[42:32] beasts said a man and the four and 20
[42:35] Elders fell down and worshiped him that
[42:38] liveth forever and
[42:40] ever amen we'll let you be
[42:46] seated been on thinking about this
[42:48] thought for some time
[42:50] and I I don't know
[42:53] hopefully can bring it out
[42:58] i' like to speak to you on weep
[43:00] not weep
[43:03] not as I as I read there as we kind of
[43:07] made a point of a strong Angel it was a
[43:10] strong angel that was crying with a loud
[43:14] voice proclaiming who is worthy worthy
[43:17] for what who's worthy to take the book
[43:21] and and I got to looking at this word
[43:23] strong it's one of great strength a
[43:26] warrior or one of great Authority a
[43:29] master and mighty and strong and I was
[43:33] reading in Psalms chapter 103 and verse
[43:35] 20 it says bless the Lord ye his angels
[43:39] that excel in strength amen so these
[43:43] angels excel in strength they Excel they
[43:46] excel at being Warriors they excel at
[43:49] being masters of every
[43:51] circumstance and we can also see the
[43:53] same word used for the mighty angel that
[43:56] came down from heaven Revelations 10
[43:58] it's a forcible or boisterous mightier
[44:01] powerful stronger Valiant so in other
[44:05] words we're not in the hands of someone
[44:07] who is incapable of handling any
[44:10] situation that we're in he is in control
[44:13] and he's always been in control and he
[44:16] always will be in control amen you know
[44:20] we can read through the scriptures of of
[44:22] the of the of how that the Bible would
[44:23] try to Define this mighty one it says in
[44:26] zephani 3 and verse1 17 it says the Lord
[44:29] your God he is the one that's in your
[44:31] midst and he is a mighty one who will
[44:35] save who will save he will rejoice over
[44:38] you with gladness he will qu You by his
[44:40] love but he is a mighty one that will
[44:43] save amen Deuteronomy 10 verse1 17 says
[44:46] for the Lord your God is God of gods and
[44:49] Lord of lords the great the Mighty the
[44:52] awesome God who's not partial and takes
[44:55] no bribes hey amen Psalms 145 says great
[44:59] is the Lord and he's greatly to be
[45:02] praised and his greatness is
[45:05] unsearchable amen Hebrews 1 would say he
[45:07] is the radiance of the glory of the God
[45:10] and he ex he's the exact imprint of his
[45:13] nature and he upholds the universe by
[45:15] the word of his power so just by the
[45:18] word his word has power and it's
[45:20] upholding the universe today as we think
[45:22] about just that thought along as we
[45:24] think about all that's going on in our
[45:26] world and and and not not even the
[45:28] political world but just the world
[45:30] itself and how how how the how the world
[45:33] is sitting here in this great Universe
[45:35] and Everything perfect time and Perfect
[45:37] Harmony it is held there by the word of
[45:40] his power and it's a sign for us to look
[45:43] at every day of our life that if God's
[45:45] word holds that world God's word holds
[45:48] your world Amen that is nothing out of
[45:51] cader there's nothing out of out of
[45:53] whack but it's all working according to
[45:56] his plan amen for he is a great God and
[45:58] he's in control amen Psalms 147 says
[46:02] great is our Lord and he's abundant in
[46:05] power and his understanding is beyond
[46:09] measure amen Jeremiah 32 says oh Lord
[46:12] God it is you that has made the heavens
[46:15] and the Earth by your great power and by
[46:17] your outstretched harm nothing is too
[46:21] hard for you amen so we're looking at a
[46:23] great God that amen that holds the world
[46:26] in his hand hands and blew it off of his
[46:28] fingertips as it were and created the
[46:31] stars and created the Sun and created
[46:33] this little Dot and all of this that
[46:35] we're living in and then all of this
[46:37] Great Dot there's a little dot called
[46:39] you on there and you are in his mind and
[46:42] he's not forgotten about you that's how
[46:44] great this God is he said how could he
[46:47] said not even natat could bad desire or
[46:50] a flea could flicker or a bird could
[46:52] fall to the ground see God was trying to
[46:54] show you the express uh uh how how how
[46:58] how Mighty he is and how great he is
[47:00] that he's he's on every little situation
[47:03] he's watching every little detail
[47:06] there's nothing that's getting by him
[47:08] amen he's not like a man that can be in
[47:10] a room and may not notice this or that
[47:12] or whatever but God notices every detail
[47:15] of Our Lives he notices everything that
[47:18] we go through job says that he's a wise
[47:20] God and hard and and mighty and strength
[47:23] and amen he said so who can Harden thems
[47:26] against him and succeed so if God if
[47:29] you're a seed of God I love that
[47:31] scripture because if you're a seed of
[47:33] God yeah you may harden yourself and you
[47:35] may harden yourself and become hard but
[47:37] you will not succeed because if there's
[47:39] a seed on the inside of you that God's
[47:42] going to go down to where it's at and
[47:44] bring it to life amen so that ought to
[47:47] give us confidence even about our own
[47:49] children and things that we're dealing
[47:51] with in everyday life that God has these
[47:54] things in control that every seed will
[47:56] will bring forth of its kind amen
[47:58] there's not a seed that God has planted
[48:01] that will not come
[48:02] up but it's been predestinated to life
[48:06] amen 1 Chronicles 29 says yours oh Lord
[48:09] is the greatness and the power and the
[48:11] glory and the Victory and the Majesty
[48:14] for all that is in heaven and all that
[48:16] is in Earth is yours yours is the
[48:19] kingdom of Lord and you are exalted as
[48:22] head above
[48:23] all amen so I'm here to remind the devil
[48:26] again he's not in charge he's not in
[48:29] charge of your life he's not in charge
[48:31] of your situation he's not in charge of
[48:34] your body he's not in charge of your
[48:36] children he has no nothing to say Amen
[48:39] well butless God gives him the ability
[48:41] or the the moment to do something only
[48:44] God can do that but he has nothing he
[48:47] can do or say without the permission of
[48:49] almighty God and God has not walked off
[48:52] the job but he's still standing here in
[48:54] complete control and he's watching
[48:56] watching over us even now he's watching
[48:59] over your children he's watching over
[49:01] your life he's watching over your body
[49:03] he's watching over your finances God is
[49:06] in
[49:08] control amen so we find here amen that
[49:12] there was something that was lost we
[49:14] know the book the book that was in that
[49:16] was in in limbo so to speak it was it it
[49:20] was back to its original owner but
[49:22] because it had been forfeited by a son
[49:24] and the first son of God's race Adam and
[49:27] forfeited that rights to that book what
[49:30] did he do he accepted Satan's wisdom
[49:33] instead of God's word amen this is where
[49:36] we get off track is when we accept
[49:38] Satan's wisdom that's why the Bible says
[49:40] we need to cast down every imagination
[49:43] and every thought that would ex exalt
[49:45] itself against the things of God Amen he
[49:48] said sons of God sometimes will take
[49:50] seminaries idea about it instead of the
[49:53] word of God see same thing Abra Adam did
[49:56] he forfeited his rights to that when he
[49:59] did it it went right back to where it
[50:00] was right back to God again it went
[50:03] right back to the original holder but
[50:05] John as we heard I thought this is
[50:07] wonderful I already had this quote and
[50:09] John in the spirit yeah we heard about
[50:13] getting in the spirit if you want to see
[50:15] what God is doing you're going to have
[50:16] to get in the
[50:18] spirit amen the world is getting in the
[50:21] spirit amen we're going to have to get
[50:23] in the spirit as our our pastor so
[50:24] eloquently said us on Sunday but amen he
[50:27] got in the spirit standing up here in
[50:30] heaven looking lifted up amen saw those
[50:33] things he said he said there in chapter
[50:35] four come up higher he said here was
[50:37] John he got in the spirit amen here he
[50:40] was in his church age here he was in his
[50:42] flesh but he was caught up to see those
[50:45] things right amen and here we are in our
[50:48] church
[50:50] age here we are in our in our flesh but
[50:53] somebody's going to be caught up to see
[50:56] the things of of God the presence of God
[50:59] Among Us that is more than a man that is
[51:01] dictating these things is more than a
[51:03] man that's in
[51:05] control well I'm so happy Trump got
[51:07] elected well I'm here to tell you
[51:08] Trump's not in
[51:10] control amen if the other one who got
[51:13] elected she would not been in control
[51:15] God is in control of this thing and he's
[51:17] bringing it down to an end
[51:20] time amen there's prophecies that's got
[51:22] to be fulfilled and they are being
[51:24] fulfilled what we got to be careful of
[51:27] is we're seeing it happen amen we're
[51:29] seeing the word
[51:31] [Applause]
[51:35] fulfill but here's the book of
[51:36] redemption here's the Plan of
[51:39] Redemption the only way you'll ever re
[51:41] be redeemed is there's a titled deed of
[51:44] the whole heavens and earth and someone
[51:46] must come forward to redeem it someone
[51:50] must come forward and he said it
[51:52] couldn't be an
[51:53] angel all right it had to be a Kinsman
[51:56] Redeemer had to be someone like
[51:59] us oh my Hallelujah cuz what good would
[52:04] the the word be just in God's hands he
[52:06] wanted it back in man's hands
[52:09] again amen so he said look at it's like
[52:11] this oh my now speak or forever hold
[52:14] your peace but let him come forward and
[52:17] claim this book who's worthy and John
[52:19] said there's no man in heaven and no man
[52:21] on Earth that was worthy and was found
[52:23] worthy no man beneath the Earth that
[52:25] ever lived or died that was found worthy
[52:27] no man was
[52:30] worthy the Angel's call was for a
[52:32] kinsman redeemer amen that as God said I
[52:36] have a law a kinsman redeemer can be a
[52:39] substitute where is that King kinsman
[52:41] redeemer who's able to do it and it came
[52:43] from Adam all the way down through the
[52:45] apostles and the prophets and everyone
[52:47] that already died nobody in heaven
[52:49] nobody in Earth nobody had ever Liv
[52:51] Elijah Moses didn't matter all the
[52:53] angels and there was no one found worthy
[52:57] that's right cuz he asked for a
[53:00] Kinsman and he said John said no man was
[53:04] worthy so it wasn't like there wasn't
[53:06] world world worthy people like an angel
[53:09] for instance would you know he'd say you
[53:11] know a worthy beings he said like
[53:13] Gabriel or or Michael or but it had to
[53:17] be a Kinsman not an angel not a
[53:20] seraphim they had they hadn't sinned but
[53:22] they had they were in a different
[53:24] category because they had never fallen
[53:26] before before amen so it had to be a
[53:28] kinsman redeemer no man because there
[53:31] was none of them had been redeemed so no
[53:33] man no man was worthy to take it he said
[53:37] it looked it took a Kinsman he asked for
[53:40] it and he wasn't there nobody my he said
[53:43] that's pretty strong but there was
[53:45] nobody available so the Bible said John
[53:48] wept cuz he knew if nobody come then
[53:52] everything was
[53:53] lost there would not be no Resurrection
[53:56] ction there would not be no change of
[53:58] the body there would not be anything
[54:00] like this take place if he didn't step
[54:02] out and John wept and he said here's
[54:05] what I think he wept for because no one
[54:08] was worthy and could open the book of
[54:10] redemption and if no one was worthy the
[54:12] whole creation was
[54:15] lost here's the book here's a little
[54:17] title D but it would be offered to the
[54:20] Kinsman that can meet the qualifications
[54:22] he said but John looked and he looked
[54:24] this way and he looked that way he
[54:26] looked that way and no one was worthy
[54:29] and he be to
[54:32] weep he said but his crying didn't last
[54:35] for just a
[54:38] minute oh I got to thinking about that
[54:41] when you realize there is a worthy one
[54:43] when you realize there is somebody that
[54:46] has taken your case that has taken what
[54:49] you have done and wiped away your sins
[54:52] amen amen it'll take away your Gloom
[54:54] it'll take away your doubt it'll take
[54:56] away your unbelief when you see it's not
[54:58] me that's worthy but I have a worthy
[55:03] lamb Hallelujah absolutely and you'll
[55:07] realize all the crying that's taken
[55:09] place in 6,000
[55:11] years 6,000 years of
[55:15] crying crying at grav
[55:18] sides crying at lost loved ones crying
[55:22] about this crying about the Gloom yeah
[55:25] when you you look at it in the grand
[55:28] scheme of things 6,000 years of human
[55:32] little little little Drop In The
[55:34] Eternity Circle 6,000 years and then you
[55:38] add all of eternity to it you won't be
[55:41] crying
[55:44] long amen 20 if you live 60 80 years 100
[55:49] years you're not going to be crying long
[55:52] amen because all of these things are
[55:53] going to be made right I think about
[55:56] brother Brandon as he talks about a
[55:57] mother's day he said he said when those
[55:59] Majestic hands come down and begin to
[56:02] untangle all the knots that's in your
[56:05] mind and he'll tell you don't weep no
[56:07] more don't cry no more it's all over now
[56:11] amen we won't be crying
[56:15] long oh my where is the man I want a man
[56:20] that's able to do it I want a man that
[56:21] can redeem and John just broke loose
[56:24] everything was lost and he wept bitterly
[56:26] he was
[56:27] sad seemed like it was
[56:32] lost rights of redemption the rights of
[56:35] eternal life the right to live all these
[56:38] rights would be forfeited and John
[56:40] started crying because no one was worthy
[56:43] no one could even look at the book it
[56:45] took a human being and John wept and
[56:47] there came a voice from one of the
[56:49] elders standing in the midst of the
[56:51] throne and said that great host of
[56:53] Heaven said don't weep John he said oh
[56:55] my the grace of of God don't be
[56:57] brokenhearted John don't weep for the
[57:01] line of the tribe of Judah the root and
[57:04] offspring of David he has prevailed yes
[57:08] he and I'm here Proclaim it again he has
[57:12] prevailed brother Timothy what about my
[57:15] situation he has prevailed what about my
[57:18] children he has
[57:20] prevailed what about the situation that
[57:22] I got to face tomorrow he has prevailed
[57:27] what about my sickness he has
[57:29] [Applause]
[57:31] prevailed prevailed means he wrestled
[57:34] with it and he overcame
[57:37] it hallelujah amen oh my The Garden of
[57:40] Gethsemane when the Bloods dropped down
[57:42] of his face sweat turned into blood he
[57:45] was overcoming the line and the root of
[57:48] David overcame he prevailed like Jacob
[57:52] the supplanter amen when he got in
[57:54] contact with the angel and he held on
[57:56] the angel tried to pull away and said
[57:57] I'm not going to let you go he held on
[58:00] until he got what he
[58:02] wanted and his name was changed from
[58:04] supplanter which means deceiver to what
[58:07] a prince with God why because he
[58:11] prevailed and the lion of the tribe of
[58:13] Judah has prevailed so we don't have to
[58:16] weep about it John for the lion has
[58:18] prevailed the root of David has
[58:20] prevailed he's already overcome it he's
[58:24] already done it it is
[58:29] finished what do you say about cancer
[58:31] brother Timothy he have
[58:36] prevailed
[58:41] Hallelujah he's already overcome he's
[58:43] done it's over

[1:06:51] touch of his hand fevers departed at the
[1:06:53] touch of his hand he conquered
[1:06:55] everything well you said you know a
[1:06:56] woman came to me not long ago said
[1:06:58] brother Mr brandom said I like to hear
[1:07:00] you speak there's one thing that you do
[1:07:01] have that's wrong I said well sister I
[1:07:03] I'd be very glad to be straightened up
[1:07:05] if I got anything wrong that's what I'm
[1:07:07] here for and she said she belonged to a
[1:07:09] church that does not believe in the
[1:07:10] Supreme D of to of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:13] Christ huh and they think he's a prophet
[1:07:17] and he's just a prophet just a man he I
[1:07:20] don't say this to hurted feelings anyone
[1:07:22] knows it and I don't take up for
[1:07:23] anybody's religion to condemn anybody's
[1:07:25] she was Christian Science and they
[1:07:26] believe in healing and so forth but they
[1:07:28] believe that Jesus was virgin born they
[1:07:30] didn't believe that Jesus was a virgin
[1:07:32] born son of God they didn't accept his
[1:07:34] blood and and he said if you do that it
[1:07:37] takes all the
[1:07:39] cream amen that's the very Lifeline of
[1:07:43] Christianity he said but she said Mr
[1:07:45] Brandon you said he was he was a
[1:07:46] fundamentalist as far as I know I
[1:07:48] believe every word the Bible says and if
[1:07:50] you'll prove it by if I prove it by your
[1:07:51] Bible there was nothing but a man you
[1:07:53] make him God I said he was God he was a
[1:07:56] God man she said I can prove that he
[1:07:58] wasn't Divine by your Bible I said lady
[1:08:00] do it if you can do it she said all
[1:08:03] right it's in St John the 11th chapter
[1:08:05] when Jesus was going to the grave of
[1:08:07] Lazarus and the Bible said he
[1:08:14] wept Mr brandom could you believe he'd
[1:08:16] be divine and weep he could not be
[1:08:19] divine and then weep I said lady you
[1:08:21] failed to see who he was he was a man on
[1:08:24] the outside but on the inside he was
[1:08:27] Jehovah God Amen see there was a time
[1:08:30] for weeping but then there came a time
[1:08:32] to
[1:08:34] speak amen and the life that was inside
[1:08:37] of him conquered
[1:08:39] death why because he said I am the
[1:08:41] resurrection of the life he said he was
[1:08:43] a man when he was weeping but when he
[1:08:45] stood at the grave and those skin worms
[1:08:48] were crawling through their body and he
[1:08:50] straightened that little figure up and
[1:08:53] he said Lazarus come forth and man had
[1:08:56] been dead 4 days stood to his feet and
[1:08:58] lived again I say that was more than a
[1:09:02] man that was a conqueror and who was
[1:09:05] speaking out of
[1:09:13] him she said if you don't believe that
[1:09:16] I'll go a little better than that he was
[1:09:18] a man when he come down off the mountain
[1:09:21] hungry looking for a fig to eat he was
[1:09:25] hungry but when he took five little
[1:09:27] biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000 that
[1:09:31] was more than a
[1:09:33] man that was God speaking through human
[1:09:36] lips true it's true he was a man when
[1:09:39] he's laying in the back of a boat out on
[1:09:41] a stormy sea and the boat was tossed up
[1:09:43] up and down 10,000 Devils of the sea had
[1:09:46] swore they drown him that night he was
[1:09:48] tired he was man tired he was laid in
[1:09:50] the back of boat as a man but W once he
[1:09:52] was aroused and walked forward and put
[1:09:55] his foot on the bread of the boat and
[1:09:56] looked up towards heaven and said peace
[1:09:59] be still the winds and the wave obeyed
[1:10:01] him that was more than a man speaking
[1:10:04] there that was God the mighty conqueror
[1:10:07] he spoke to the wind and it went to the
[1:10:10] cave like a puppy dog in the sight of a
[1:10:15] lion he spoke to the waves and they
[1:10:18] folded their hands and perfect rest upon
[1:10:21] the Sea's bosom he was more than a man
[1:10:24] he was the mighty God the Conqueror he
[1:10:27] could conquer n nature he could conquer
[1:10:29] death he conquered waves he conquered
[1:10:31] air there he is there's never been one
[1:10:33] like him I know you think I'm excited

[1:24:13] chapters of our
[1:24:17] life he conquered every
[1:24:20] Temptation he conquered it all so we
[1:24:22] could resist the devil and he will flee
[1:24:25] from
[1:24:26] you he conquered sickness he conquered
[1:24:28] Temptation he broke down the gates he
[1:24:31] took the key and he handed it over to
[1:24:33] every believer of Abraham's seed and he
[1:24:36] said if he tempts you resist him and he
[1:24:40] will
[1:24:42] flee
[1:24:45] hello don't sound like a real strong
[1:24:47] dude does
[1:24:49] it comes against a little child daughter
[1:24:52] of God in her mind mind begins to try to
[1:24:56] torment her and she begins to put the
[1:24:57] word of God in her mind resist and he
[1:25:01] flees what's he scared

[1:25:18] conquered Temptation he's and now we are
[1:25:21] more than conquerors to him that loved
[1:25:22] us and he gave his life for us be in
[1:25:24] Royal seat of Abraham with the same
[1:25:26] spirit of God that was in him now in us
[1:25:29] we're more than conquerors every gate
[1:25:30] has been conquered the only thing we
[1:25:32] have to do is possess it because it's
[1:25:33] already been conquered sicknesses are
[1:25:36] conquered death is conquered health is
[1:25:38] why you keep saying this cuz I want the
[1:25:39] devil to hear it and I want you to hear
[1:25:42] it hell is conquered the grave is
[1:25:44] conquered everything and we hold the
[1:25:48] keys by his
[1:25:51] grace by his grace
[1:25:55] listen we're we're past the time of
[1:25:59] gloom and doubt and
[1:26:01] worry how is all this going to
[1:26:03] end how is all this going to be how is
[1:26:07] this day going to
[1:26:09] go it's going to go as God has decreed
[1:26:12] it to go just walk in faith and not by
[1:26:16] sight because if you walk by sight
[1:26:19] you'll see all kind of things around
[1:26:21] you and you'll start sinking as PE Peter
[1:26:24] did on the waves why he was standing
[1:26:27] right before the one who had conquered
[1:26:28] all this we're talking
[1:26:30] about but he started looking at all this
[1:26:33] because he thought it was greater
[1:26:35] apparently he thought that the waves
[1:26:38] around him was greater than the one
[1:26:39] standing in front of
[1:26:41] him and when you begin to think that the
[1:26:43] waves that Satan makes in your life and
[1:26:46] the situation he makes a riseon your
[1:26:48] life is greater than the one who's
[1:26:50] called you he will conquer you but if
[1:26:53] you'll keep your eyes on
[1:26:55] Jesus wipe those tears
[1:26:58] away and say the lamb has
[1:27:02] prevailed he's in control of this
[1:27:05] situation and no matter what happens I
[1:27:08] know he is in
[1:27:10] control that's B our
[1:27:14] hearts got a ton more we could go
[1:27:17] through but I just feel to just
[1:27:21] stop weep not
[1:27:25] quit
[1:27:26] crying quit don't moan about it groan
[1:27:29] about it look to your lamb that's
[1:27:35] prevailed Look to
[1:27:39] Him brother Phil can you sing that song
[1:27:41] Look to Him I know I'm springing one on
[1:27:43] you but that song been on my heart
[1:27:46] should have asked you
[1:27:47] before maybe do you play that Andrew
[1:27:57] Look to
[1:27:59] Him that's what we got to
[1:28:02] do brother Timothy what about the waves
[1:28:04] look to Jesus what about the situation
[1:28:07] look to
[1:28:08] Jesus what about the problems around
[1:28:10] look to Jesus Keep Your Eyes on
[1:28:14] him keep your eyes on him how many we
[1:28:17] just say Lord let me turn my eyes away
[1:28:20] from the things of this
[1:28:22] world turn them on you
[1:28:24] Lord with my whole heart keep my eyes
[1:28:29] focused in Jesus name father bless your
[1:28:33] people tonight
[1:28:35] Lord take these words Lord and just
[1:28:37] drive them into our hearts
[1:28:40] Lord help us father to just look to you
[1:28:45] Lord look to you when all around us
[1:28:47] seems to be sinking and all around us
[1:28:49] seems to be just rocking and carrying on
[1:28:52] but Lord we can look to Jesus
[1:28:55] the author and the finisher of our
[1:28:59] faith so thankful for that scripture
[1:29:02] Lord because you didn't just start the
[1:29:04] work you're going to finish
[1:29:07] it you have
[1:29:11] prevailed touch each heart tonight we
[1:29:13] pray in Jesus
[1:29:17] name well I
[1:29:20] know the Bible says
[1:29:24] when you've done all that you can to

[1:29:49] scaring those hands
[1:29:55] but just

[1:30:04] find
[1:30:07] surely youve not reach the
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:13] end and when the whole
[1:30:16] world has let you
[1:30:19] down

[1:30:33] him and look to
[1:30:37] him for he
