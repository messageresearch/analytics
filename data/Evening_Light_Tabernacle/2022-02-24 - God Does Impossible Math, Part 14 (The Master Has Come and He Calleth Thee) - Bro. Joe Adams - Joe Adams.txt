set aside consecrated and dedicated for the service of the lord and father we want to make you the welcome guest tonight we want to invite you lord and we do that right now father on the wings of our prayer we invite you lord not only to the service tonight but to our situations our struggles our sicknesses the trials that we are facing god we're asking and we're inviting the king of kings and the lord of lords to come on the scene lord and we just commit this time to you this evening father we just pray you'll anoint the lips of the speaker lord but may you not only anoint those slips may you anoint the ears of the listener dear god that we can be in one heart and one accord we can be receiving and pulling on the gift of god and pull you to our need tonight lord because we believe that you're a need supplying god and we just commit this service to you tonight lord in jesus name amen if you have your bibles tonight we'll get started here i want to turn to uh john 11. we're going to look here very familiar scripture reading for all of us amen it's good to be in the house of the lord i tell you you work a long day on the job and you come here and you're just thankful for a church a body of believers that you can take a refuge in and knowing that we're all of like precious faith believing the same message believing the same god believing the same supernatural getting away from the cares of this life and so grateful and so honored to be a part of it tonight proud to be a part of even like tabernacle i'm proud to be a social associated with each and every one of you and we're just going to look to him tonight to be the speaker so we look here in john 11 verse 1 it says now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha and it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick and i believe they sung about that mary tonight therefore his sister sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou love us is sick when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus and when he had heard therefore that he was sick he had both two days still in the same place where he was then after that he said to his disciples let us go unto judea again now verse 11. if you skip down these things said he and after that he had said unto them our friend latharis sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep and his disciples are then said as disciples lord if he sleeps he shall do well howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of a rest in sleep and then jesus said unto them plainly lazarus is dead and i'm glad for your sake that i was not there to the intent that you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him verse 20. then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou had been here my brother had not had died but i know that even now whatsoever thou ask god god will give it jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again martha said i know martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection it's the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth out this she said unto him yay lord i believe that thou art christ the son of god which come into the world and when she had said so she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and he calleth thee you can have your seats this evening just want to take some time this evening just want to speak something very familiar to us but i want to pick back up on god does impossible math part 14 and i i do trust that you're not getting tired of this series uh but i want to look here just for a little bit this evening on the master has come and calleth thee and we find that this is a very familiar scripture reading and brother branham would tell us that you know joseph had died and when joseph jesus's father had died that he went to live with martha and mary and lazarus and he became their pastor and he was good friends with them and really loved them and he said that they had left their church they left everything that they uh what they were used to and accustomed to and they left it all behind to follow him and to follow his teachings and in that day if you know anything about that that day to leave the orthodox church with meant penalty of death and they left all that risking their life so they can follow this one that they claim to be the messiah and yet we find that it's in their weakest moment it's in their darkest hours when their greatest need that they really need the lord the most and he's nowhere to be found we find in their their greatest despair when they meet him most they didn't see him they didn't hear him they didn't feel him and many times we find ourselves in the same place many times you find yourself in need of god and you don't hear god you're in need of a supernatural touch and he's nowhere to be found there's times when you need to see god and you need to see the manifestation and it feels like he didn't come to church tonight but it's at their lowest point and you would have thought that martha and mary would have lost confidence in jesus he would have thought that they had lost confidence in this one that they had risked everything for to follow in their darkest hour their lowest point their greatest trial their greatest need now they were left alone to mourn the loss of their brother and jesus was nowhere to be found they were left to answer all the critics well i thought you said he was a healer i thought you said he was the messiah i thought you said he could do this i thought you said he opened up the blind house i thought this and i thought that and they were left there to respond to the critics that didn't believe in the supernatural and i asked you what about our human nature some of you criticized the ministry because they're not present in your need oh we're going to get a little quiet we're not going to touch long on that but we fine you know the pastor doesn't call you when you're sick or the ministry doesn't reach out to you but if i recall correctly the bible tells us might you call the elders of the church and let them pray for you and then we find here notice now we find satan begins to work on what we would call a climb a complex in this arena and he'd go into your mind and start chattering into your mind thinking well the pastor doesn't care about you and this that and the other i mean we are the sheep he should call he should know what i'm going through i mean my goodness he's a pastor he don't have anything else in life to do but just go study the word and take care of my needs sometimes that's how we think and yet the devil's in the ear then the devil not only gets in the ear of that person that doesn't have a real experience or confidence real confidence in the ministry then they sit around the dinner table and then the chatter that was once in the mind in the ear of that person now becomes dissipated throughout the dinner table not only for the wife but also for the young children and then when your children get of age then you wonder why don't they serve god why don't they have any kind of love or any kind of desire for the things of god let me tell you why because you murdered the character you murdered the man's influence you destroyed his influence how can he help your kids when you've done this work but we found martha and married they didn't lose confidence in jesus though he left they saw for him and though they called after him and jesus tarried two days and didn't respond to their need notice his response was this sickness is not unto death but that the glory of god could be fulfilled see god has a purpose and god has a plan in everything that he does god does not make mistakes you may look at your trial you may look at your sickness you may look at the thing you're going through the situation that you're facing and you may look at it and you may think god deserted me when i needed him no god didn't god put you right there so that the glory of god could be made manifest that's what god is doing in that situation that's what god is doing in that trial that's what god is doing in that sick body god is bringing you to a place that god can show who he is in your life because when you're on the mountaintop you have no need of god so we think but it's in that valley as we spoke the last time it's in that valley that you really learn to trust god notice now jesus says this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby then we look down in john 11 15 and he says and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there what a pastor i'm glad i didn't show up i'm glad you were in that hospital room by yourself no not quite like that but anyway i'm glad for your sex that i was not there to the intent that ye may believe notice his purpose his purpose is to get you to believe in your darkest hour to get you to believe in your weakest moment to elevate your faith to grab hold of a promise god had to let it get so dire so dead so stinky so miserable that he can manifest himself because he is god jesus delayed his coming because he knew what the father had already showed him see he already had a vision of what was going to transpire therefore he could say this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god and let me just say god knows about your situation god knows about your sickness god knows about that doctor's report that you received this week god knows but he says it's not unto death but for the glory of god you got to look at the promise and quit looking at the situation quit take your eyes oh look i understand maybe you did get a report that says you got this and you got that and that's part of it take your eyes off the report and put your eyes on his report his report says you're already healed by my stripes so we fail to see jesus has allowed these things or god had allowed these things to come to pass in in lazarus life so that he can display his supreme deity he wanted to open up the eyes of martha that she would never have another doubt in her mind who he was she want he wanted to show himself so allowed to marry more than just washing his feet but he was going to be a living manifested god in their time of need there would never be another doubt across their mind because they seen the effects of the supernatural god in their midst and not only for them but for the disciples that they would believe that they will never come in your mind a frequent of doubt or unbelief or anything no matter what you're going through we believe who he is because we see who he is let me ask you these things that this situation with lazarus wasn't just for lazarus this man's no doubt he's in a new body he's enjoying his new life he ain't worried he's 18. walking on streets of gold maybe something i don't know but it wasn't so much for him that it got that dire but it was for his sisters it was for all the believers there that was mourning the loss of lathers it was for the disciples god had a purpose and notice why did god allow cancer to strike sister atlanta why did god allow alopecia to strike mariah why did god allow drew to be born crippled or whatever it was where he couldn't walk for many many many years why did god allow those things it wasn't for sister atlanta it wasn't for sister mariah it wasn't for brother drew no it was so that god can declare himself a living god in this age in a godless age god was showing he's going to have somebody that's going to believe the works of god that he's going to manifest himself that it would encourage you in your community when you're at your darkest tower when you're at your weakest moment he's still god he's still god why did he do it so that you can't believe oh to relevate your faith tonight to believe no matter what you're facing no matter what you're going through no matter how hard the trial is just to get you to believe that he's still god he's god and laodicea and he's god in your trial he's god in your sickness he's god and your need and he's god here tonight and when god comes he calls the master has come and he's calling you he's calling your faith up another notch to get you to believe to get you to believe so he had a purpose that strengthens our faith to prove that he's mindful of our needs to prove that he's a living god to reassure us that he's on the throne and that he's in control four days late no he's in control but four days late don't worry about four days like he's in control see he wants you to believe his word no matter what you're facing now i know that's easier said and done right it's easier said and done but notice they sent for him 11 3 therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou love us is sick now jesus loved martha and her sister in lazarus but when he had heard therefore that he was sick he'll bow two days still in the same place oh my that's a great pastor goes off on a vacation leaves you high and dry you call for them hey you rung them up on the phone you sent messages to them and he refused to come to your aid what a great pastor no don't look back here bro tim when he talking about him talking about jesus in their greatest hour of need they sent for him and instead of coming he went further instead of coming he takes the vacation another city away oh i'm not going to shred porn no sir i'm going here then you send form there and he goes a little bit further then he goes a little bit further what is he doing he knows the vision he already knows what's going to happen i love how brother branham will say this he said verily very i say you uh i say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing see the father had already told him to go away and to be away for so many days and after the days was accomplished then he said our friend lather is sleeping so you think god was caught by surprise that he didn't know what was going to happen in lazarus situation nor is he caught by surprise with your situation god knows before that doctor puts his name on that report what your situation is but more importantly god knows the end he has the final say he is the final say notice now he said he is dead and for your sakes i'm glad i wasn't there because then they'd be trying to get him to go and heal him notice you know we want that we want healing we want deliverance but see lazarus had to operate or not last but jesus had to operate according to the vision so god has a purpose in allowing these things to happen and he has a purpose for allowing the things that happen in our life some of you get sick some of you get cancer some of you have disappointment some of you face sorrows some of you lose a close friend or maybe we lost a companion but nothing that we face in this life is by chance god doesn't make mistakes see no situation that we will ever encounter has ever taken god by surprise see he knows the final verdict he knows what the ultimate say is going to be and he knows what the end of your story is i was telling brother timothy in the back i wish we knew the end i wish we knew the end but if we knew the end it wouldn't be by faith but this is a faith walk and we're challenged to believe when you don't have the strength you're challenged to believe when you don't feel like it you're challenged to believe when you feel like giving up he's asking you to believe all things are impossible to them are possible to them that will believe nothing impossible brother brethren would tell us now in the message then jesus came and called he said all hopes was gone lathers had died every hour they kept thinking he might come on the scene but he might come on the scene and he'd come back or and he might come back but finally he died and the breath left them notice they went they embalmed his body take the blood out of his body wrapped them in linen spices and bonded and laid them in the grave put a rock over the grave which was their custom of bearing in those days a hole was cut in the ground a rock put over the top of it and there he was none of you were in that dire condition tonight but we find here all hopes was gone now it's too late lathers has taken his last breath and where is jesus the life has now left his body and there was no jesus they drained the blood from his body and still know jesus they poked him with embalming fluid and still no jesus they wrapped him in linen and they put spices on them and still jesus was not there they threw his body in a borrowed tomb and still jesus was not there in their darkest hour and their weakest moment jesus was not there but i want you to know brother says jesus was on his road back because he knew the end of the story he knew what was about to transpire he said the first day passed second day passed no jesus third day passed no jesus but the fourth day passed and the man was already rotten in the grave all hoax was gone and it may appear in your situation that there's no hope there's no way it's useless i gotta give up i gotta throw in the towel let me tell you you're not in lazarus condition tonight it may be that you're four days dead and your body begins to rise but he's still jesus and he's still a longtime god [Applause] all hopes of seeing him was gone but they had waited maybe he'll come maybe he'll come tonight in this service oh i love i love now how the bible would tell us in 11 20 then martha as soon as she heard jesus was coming oh he was coming to even like tabernacle on wednesday night or he was going to make an appearance before the weekend meetings he was coming for what to call he was coming the prophet god would say when jesus comes it brings new hope it brings new desires it brings new ambitions and when martha heard that he was coming something just flooded in her heart oh i got an opportunity now now i can get before this jesus oh i know my brother is dead i know he's been in the grave for four days but it doesn't count the master is coming he's coming and i know there's hope yet because the master he is coming and i see him blind eyes open i see crippled legs walk i've seen him manifest himself the master is on his road [Applause] it's a master's outside she didn't stay shut up in the house streaming the service oh my no she came out on a wednesday night cold rainy she came out because she heard the master was coming oh jesus came in the dark hour when every hope was gone that's usually when he comes he comes just at that darkest time notice now he come and called for martha his presence brought new hopes no matter if the boy was dead yet the presence brings new hope you might be sitting here tonight my friend where the doctor has given you up with cancer god doesn't make mistakes i'm here to tell you the doctor may have given you up with cancer heart trouble maybe it's a chair crippled all signs and said there's no hope for you that a positive calcium has nodded your bones and you can't bend no more either your heart is so bad the doctor says you might go anytime but the great bunch of people with cancer and tb may be the last hope you got and it seems like the doctors turned you down but yet in the presence and the recognition of presence of jesus christ he brings new hopes that's why we're here tonight you're not here to listen to me preach you're here to hear something from god to give you new hope oh that i can make it out of this trial i can be healed i can be delivered cancer ain't gonna take me down i'm in his presence with new hope with new desires with a new faith believed by god can and not only that he can my god will he's able tonight he's able to meet your needs he's able to heal your body he's them deliver you from your situation because my god is on time and the master is coming he's coming tonight he's here tonight for your need church [Applause] the master is here and when he's here his presence oh my you may have drug in bound by the situation you may have drug in ready to give up but oh his presence when it comes down my my my new hope oh revitalize revitalize faith notice maybe you got a surgery that you got to endure but in his presence brings new hope maybe a high blood pressure is taking a toll on your body but in his presence it brings new hope it brings new hope hear me i'm talking to you i'm preaching at you now it brings new hope his presence i'm not talking about mind over matter i'm not talking about psychology i'm talking about the dynamics of the holy ghost i'm talking about the person of christ i i preached this message last week at brother jason jackson's and the lord kept leading me back this way and i kept preaching and kept preaching and kept preaching and there was a young lady come in the prayer line she came up and she said she said i'm backslidden i'm backslidden i've crossed the line i've gone too far i made a mess of my life and i looked and i said that's lies i said it's all live she was taken back i said the devil has lied to you i said he's lied to you look where you're standing right now he said you've gone too far but look where you're at he said you crossed the line but look where you're standing he said there was no hope for look at you your desire for things of god or it may look like he's given up it may look like you crossed a lie but in his presence it brought you hope and she stepped into that prayer life oh beat down wore out and she wanted to give up on life but she went back to her seat because the master had come and he called her and he delivered her and she gave her heart back to god and she put a smile on her face because the master came to her knees and it gave her a new hope i can live i can live free i can live victorious i can live above sin i can live up other character this life i can live now oh church let me tell you his presence brings new homes in south africa there's a man who never had a pair of shoes on his feet he'd been way back in the jungles born there years ago by missionary parents he was born with deformed feet he come walking up through there clubbing clubbing his feet but he had a shoe box under his arm oh had a shoebox he came on a friday night service and he witnessed the power of god he seen the presence of god he came back on a saturday night surf and he seen the same god that was there friday night came back again on saturday night oh he came on sunday and he had a little shoe box in his hand and he kept walking and they said oh what you got in your box there he says i got me a pair of shoes probably a pair of johnson murphys because i like them that's right oh i got me a parachute what do you think for your daddy said nope i'm going to wear these before the service is over and the prophet god said before that service was over he had those shoes on his feet and he was running all over the place why because he said i've seen the presence of god on friday night i seen him heal the i see them open the blind tonight and i know if he's there tonight he won't turn me down i'm gonna tell you a church god won't turn you down he's here for you the master's calling you oh he's calling you now he's calling you out of sickness unto hell he saw the witness in the presence of almighty god and he gained new hopes notice what he did his faith say i want you to go and purchase you a pair of shoes matter of fact could you think how stupid he looked walking into the shoe store with club feet but his face wasn't looking at his feet his face was looking at the promise i've seen god move i witness god move he won't turn me down and before the service was over he was wearing the purchased possession he was did you hear what i said he was wearing the purchase possession faith told them to reach out there go do something that may it may appear like you're some holy role it may appear like you've lost your mind but that faith totally go by a pair of shoes and fake before the service was over had those shoes on his feet and that same kind of faith made him run up and down let me tell you you can do that tonight church he's the same god tonight he's the same god for your name he's the same god if you if you're just like you're i believe tonight you won't turn me down you heal sister atlanta you put hair back on little morale you gave drew ability to walk i know you won't turn me down tonight he won't turn me down not psychology not mind over matter but the dynamics the dynamics of the holy ghost and when you preach the dynamics of the holy the cripples will walk when you preach the dynamics of the holy ghost to sick will be made well when you preach the dynamics of the holy spirit the baron will give life nothing is impossible with god nothing is impossible with god and nothing is impossible with you that'll take god at his word tonight see it brought new hopes he brought new hopes notice verse 20. now martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming she went and she met him but mary sat still in the house but see it brought new hopes to her she heard oh it may look like it all hopes was gone but she heard jesus was coming see brother brown would say she seemed to manifest the word of god she seen that age if she wouldn't have she would have still been an orthodox she would have still belonged to the church but she had seen the promised word she had seen the promised word manifested by him and she knew that he was the living word and he's a living word in this hour he's the living word she's seen the blinded eyes open she's seen the walk she's seemed to the spots on the leopard vanish and be made clean see there was no denying that she had witnessed the living manifestation of the word of god and there's no denying that we have witnessed the same at this church in this hour in this age in the darkest of all times the light has all but almost gone out but yet she believed notice maybe she heard the story how god was in elijah and there was a shooter white woman who believed and she had a little boy and he had died and she called for her life said i'm not going to leave i'm not going to leave until you come to my son and elijah came and laid his body on the boy and life came back to him and she knew that if god was in elijah surely god is in christ and if he can do that in a prophet what can he do with the living manifest manifested word church he's here tonight he's here for your need tonight no matter how bad the situation or how many how many days the brother's been laid in the grave she knew that god was in elijah she knew that god was in christ she knew these times will follow them that believe and i'm asking you do you believe tonight do you give witness tonight how do you get witness by your voice by your amen by your response back to the word she believed and look the impossibilities were made real because she took god at his word and brother said he's the same yesterday today and forever and he has not changed he's as very much god for your need tonight as he was for blind bartimaeus as he was for the woman at the well as he was from arthur as he was for the shudomite woman he's still god he's still god notice here in verse 21 then said martha unto jesus lord you just you've just been here you know that's how we would be we all pity patty she didn't have a pity party lord if you'd have been here my brother would not have died but i know lord that even now whatsoever thou has god god will give it but lord you don't know you don't know my sorrow you don't know lord we called out to you in four days god you we we just gave up that wasn't her attitude her attitude wasn't attitude to defeat her like there wasn't attitude to giving up no it looked like it was all gone it looked like all hopes were gonna look like him i mean they've done putting her brother in the grave they'd embalmed his body drain the blood but yeah she said lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now lord even on the wednesday night god no matter how dark my situation even now lord whatever you ask god god will give she came to service looking for god to speak to her and i'm asking what did you come for or you come and say even now god whatever you ask god god will give it to me tonight i need healing from cancer he's still god tonight i need deliverance in the home he's still god tonight whatever that will ask god god is still here he's still god she said i believe that thou art the one the son of god that came into the world although my brother is dead laying out there in the grave his body decaying now but even now oh i wonder if we can have that same response that's why we're here church in this service tonight is to hear the word of god just speak healing over my sickness speak deliverance over my situation speak salvation to my loved one even now even now lord so brother bran will say she had to believe for the impossibles she had to believe and he said you got to believe for the same sister ruth you got to believe you got to believe it's not so much for me for the tim or the timothy brother aaron to believe for you and to pray for you but you got to believe you got to bring your faith to that level and say lord i've seen the signs of god i've witnessed some testimonial sister atlanta i witnessed testimony a little drew i witnessed a testimony of this one and that one countless times we have seen the physical supernatural manifestation of a living god and god is asking you to believe for the impossible because your situation it may be impossible to you but it's not impossible with god and if i can get you to believe tonight nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer not even heart heart trouble not even high blood pressure nothing will stand before your prayer if you can't believe if you can't believe that even now lord even now lord on a wednesday night lord i believe you're a healer i believe you if by deliver i believe you're a miracle work i believe lord even now even tonight on the wednesday night lord i believe you're a healer even now lord that was her attitude i believe she went out she didn't have a complex she didn't get all upset because the pastor didn't call nope she went out to meet him i gotta get in his presence because i know in his presence it's a fullness of joy in his presence her attitude was an attitude of even now no matter how dark no matter how bleak no matter how lost even now her attitude and her response to her trial is what moved god to that need do you hear what i'm saying tonight your response to your situation moves the heart of god to come to your scene come to your need come to your trial come to your sickness come to your crippled body come to your cancer-ridden body come to your lost loved one your response to the word of god your response to that situation is what moves the heart of god she could have berated him she could have ridiculed him we waited on you you didn't show up wow you couldn't come when we needed you what's the use now that was not her attitude even now lord even tonight i may be the only believer here tonight lord but even now speak the word to my situation before i came out to preach i pray god will be a discerner of the very thoughts and the very intents of the heart because me as a man these brothers back here though godly as they are they're just men we're just men we don't know what your day-to-day struggles are unless you tell us but if we can sovereignly pray and invite the presence of the living god on the scene to minister to your needs we can study we can pray and the god can lead us this way in that way but i'm praying god may there be a spirit of the sermon that'll reach into that heart it may be dark it may be bleak if they may feel like giving up they may be so bound by depression and anxieties and fears and suicide whatever it may be pornography may be ravishing their life but even now lord lord if you can just anoint these lips tonight if you can just move the heart of your servant to go to that need minister to that life elevate that faith lord they'll put the key into that like lord and unlock the promises of god to him even now lord do it tonight father may there be such a spirit of liberty here tonight that you won't stay shackled you won't stay back in the sea but you'll be like martha oh even now lord whatever you ask god god to give it to me tonight i know he's here i feel his presence i witness his testimony i believe lord even now for my need [Applause] even now think about this how great are even now prayers i remember an even now prayer sitting about right there where sister katrina is sitting about four years ago february 18th even now lord at the end of a service cancer said i'm going to take you to an early grave cancer didn't have the final saying because even now lord showed up see your loved one may be dead and smelly as lathers but even now lord your situation may be four days dead but even now lord whatever you ask god gotta give it oh church don't stop knocking don't stop knocking don't stop praying don't stop believing even now lord lord you don't you you don't answer that's fine i'm having a good time of knocking i'm going to stay here i'm going to be on your hands until that door of opportunity wakes up and opens up and when it does i'm going to walk through that door i'm going to be on time for my healing i'm going to be on time i'm not going to be sleeping a grave i'm going to be waiting lord for your appearance i'm gonna be looking lord for the signs of the supernatural i'm gonna come to service with an expectation even now lord whatever you ask god whether you speak tonight through brother joe i'm gonna believe it for myself i'm gonna believe it from my family i'm going to believe lord because you're here tonight and you get testimony to the word of god even now prayers even now even tonight oh my notice john 11 23 jesus said unto her well your brother's going to rise again well you know i know he's going to rise again in the resurrection in the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and not only am i am the resurrection but i am the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this even like tabernacle believeth thou this yay lord i believe tonight notice he said i am the resurrection and the life he knew who he was see he identified not with what he was but with who he was see he was he is the i am i am the resurrection and i am the life notice jesus didn't claim to have resurrection in life he didn't claim to understand the secrets he didn't underclean understand or claim to have the psychology of it he claimed emphatically that i am the resurrection and i am the life and though your brother be laying in the grave though his skin worms destroy his body i am here tonight to give life to your brother because look if i can raise him up in the end time i can raise him up right now and he's the same god i'm the resurrection tonight is the same resurrection power that we're gonna take a body change because what i am the resurrection and i am your life i'm not talking about it i'm not uncertain about it i know who i am i am the power of god i am the living manifestation of god i am that i am i am the one that met moses in a burning bush i am what moses liked and he's what you like tonight he's faith for your belief notice he raised her hopes he raised he elevated her face you're not just standing in the presence of a mere preacher no sir you're standing in the presence of almighty god i am i am i am the one who didn't have beginning of days and i am the one that has no ending of life i am the creator of heavens and earth i am the i am god i am the one who's formed and fashioned your body i am the one that knows the very intricate details of the cells and molecules that make up your being i am him and i'm here to give life the master has come and he's calling he's calling you out of sickness he's calling you back to life he's calling out of a broken marriage he's calling you into a a marriage that's consummated and consecrated on god he is still the i am god he is still the healer he is still the deliverer he is still the miracle worker he is still the waymaker he is the i am god he was not uncertain about who he was he knew he who he was he says i always was i always will be i am the resurrection and the life notice his next phrase he recognized who he was and he was elevating her faith on a wednesday night service so that she can see she wasn't in just a man's presence but she was in his presence and she looked he looked at martha where have you laid them take me to your brother see he knew who he was he already seen in the vision what was about to happen oh if i can get you to believe just like god has already seen you in the vision he knows what's about to happen church oh we're just a few chapters away remember we're just a few chapters away to our greatest supernatural experience there's about to be a body change for this bride we're just a matter of time away let me tell you we you may be in a dark hour but we're only a few chapters away you may be in a dark moment you may be laid in a tomb somewhere but where have you laid them because the i am is here on a wednesday night and he's here and he's he's here to invoke faith to you tonight show me where you laid god about to raise him from the dead i'm about to raise your situation i'm about to elevate your faith that you can believe cancer ain't too big for my god my god is able to destroy cancer he's able to destroy high blood pressure he's able to destroy sugar diabetes he's able tonight because the i am is looking for the grave the eye said take me to him where have you laid him i'm here he was about to manifest the vision he was about to bring the total climax see he had a purpose god had a purpose he waited four days where have you laid them see there was a jewish superstition that said that the body or the soul would hang around the grave for three days so he had to wait till the fourth day so there was no possibility of resurrection or resuscitation because he knew who he was and it may appear tonight that you're four days late oh but even now lord notice what he tells martha in john 11 39 jesus said take he away the stone see we got something to do church we got a part to play on a wednesday night oh y'all want the ministry to do all the work don't you that one of us come up here and study for all well we came here and we halfway studied you wouldn't get nothing out of this service no we studied all week weeks hours and it'll tell how many hours we put into a service and you expect us to do all the work jesus said no you take me where he's at but i want you to roll the stone away you got a part to play in a wednesday night service on a sunday night service on a friday youth service on a saturday banquet service we got a part to play even like tabernacle it ain't all for the ministry we got a part to play in this we got to roll the stone away we got to push away the doubts we got to push away the fears we got to push away the anxiety we got to grab hold of every promise of god and say yeah it ain't mean it's for me tonight it's for my family it's for my loved one it's for my children it's for the family of god it's more even like tabernacle yes lord i believe it tonight and if you can believe tonight church if you can believe tonight that he's god he's as very much god tonight as he was for martha and mary you're going to see the supernatural you're going to see a display so see god had a purpose he let it get four days late so that he can prove his deity so that he can prove that he's not a superstition so that he can prove no matter what stage four cancer says no matter what this doctor says no matter what the family dynamics say he has the final say notice martha and mary they took away the stone from the place where they laid him and jesus lifted up his eyes and he said father i thank thee that thou has heard me and i knew that thou hearst me always but because of the people we stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me he had a purpose to elevate their faith to believe no matter who's preaching to elevate your faith to believe and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound with the napkin and jesus said unto them loose him and let him go he's the same god tonight and the prophet of god would say that martha was at the right place in the front of the right man with the right attitude and with the right approach she didn't come in on a wednesday night and sit down on the preacher she didn't come in with a complex her tongue all bent out of shape scold him because you didn't do this and you didn't do that even now lord he said notice now he said she was at the right place with the right attitude he says that can be done if we'll take the right attitude towards him if we'll come to see him to love him and to worship him then god is obligated to give us them things which we desire he said the right attitude or the right the right mind or mindset to any divine promise of god will bring it to pass so your tragedy is all you see how many is in a difficult spot tonight nobody okay we got a bunch of cherubs here praise god your tomb is only a miracle in the waiting your trial is only an opportunity for god to display his dynamics your situation may be dead but god says i'm the i am i heard a brother say last week your miracle is in the room your miracle is in the room your miracle's not brother joe it's not brother timothy brother tim brother there your miracle is in a room though it's here he's just waiting on you to appropriate the faith to believe it he's waiting on for you to say i'm going to push that stone away of unbelief tonight and i'm going to believe god notice now all this took place so that the glory of god could be made manifest notice what he did to moses told moses moses you're going to take my people out you're going to take them out of egypt you're going to cross over here you're going to take them to this mountain you're going to worship me over there and moses did exactly what god said he went to pharaoh showed out who he was said moses you let my people go got his people out of there and they get down and then they find the self mountains on both sides a great big sea in front of them and pharaoh's army coming behind them they were in a dark place but god had already told moses moses you're going to worship me in that mountain let me tell you there's not enough pharaohs there's not enough devils in hell we've already been seen in a vision god has already sold it there's going to be a rapture i'm going to have a bride she's going to be without spot she's going to be without regal i ain't enough devils and help to stop god's purpose or god's plan you've already been seen there church you've already been witness on the other side i don't shout right now thank you god it may be dark let me just say this if the red sea would have never opened god would have washed him right off top of the water because he's god tonight moses told him stand still you're about to see the witness of the holy ghost you're about to see god move and those enemies that you face today you're gonna face him no more see he knew who he was he knew that he had been called he knew that god gave him a promise and god gave him a commission and god has given you that same promise and that same commission see god likes to he likes to let it get to the darkest hour but he says it's the darkest hours when jesus comes on the scene in your darkest hour let me just skip down so in your darkest hour that's when jesus appears and see the way we get things from god is the way that we approach it so you have to approach it the right way god i believe he said maybe it's the darkest hour you've ever seen or you've ever seen or you or you he says but maybe the doctor's given you up but jesus comes along just in the darkest hour he comes in just in the darkest hour hebrew children in the darkest hour that last step off that platform was the first step into his presence and he was there he wasn't a minute early and he wasn't a second late he was on time and he's that same god for you tonight in their darkest hour the furnace heated up seven times hotter than it ever been hit before but yet jesus met them there blind bartimaeus we know the story of blind bartimaeus the man that sowed this that and the other to try to make a living for his family and he here he was they put him out on a street corner and jesus comes passing by thousands of people hundreds of people screaming hosanna to the hives and he hears what's going on he says oh that's jesus another he's compassion by the way and blind bartimaeus in his mind oh they set me at the wrong place but he began to cry oh jesus thou son of david have mercy on me he said there was hundreds of people all around crying out and he said there's no way that he could have hurt but something stopped him and when it stopped jesus jesus called bartimaeus to his side let me tell you the master's come for you tonight and he's come to call you he's come to call you out of blindness he's come to call you out of sickness he's come to call you to himself the master has come and he's calling you think about the woman with the blood issue so to all her living well the man said she hocked the farm and gave the the team away and everything spent all her money trying to trying to just get to where she can be healed she was sitting there and she looked down and she seen the multitudes around him so if i can just get if i can just touch the hem of his garment if i can just muster enough faith just to get down and fight my way through the crowd fight my way through through all those that may say something oh you little holy roller you act this way and you act that way if i can just fight my way to him and touch to him of his garment and when she touched him he turned around and he called i perceive virtue has left me he's the same god tonight a woman at the world the woman at the well right in her darkest hour immoral jesus had a need to go by samaria of all places the racial tension between jews and samaritans and yet he had a need to go by there he had a need brother elle to go to mississippi he had a need why because he had a seed to meet that need he had seeds over there he had a seed at the well oh it didn't look like she would see she was scarred up i had five husbands one she living with now wasn't hers but yet the master came and he called her from that living from that livelihood and he made a daughter of god out of her now as we bring this to a close musicians can find your way back i want you to know the master has come tonight the master has come in this day in this age brother braum says here is a lady sitting here praying
