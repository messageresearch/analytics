would give ourselves to you in Jesus name Malachi chapter 3 in verse 1 says behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom he seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom he delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts but who may abide in the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appears for he is like a refiners fire and likes fuller soap and he shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may be offered unto the Lord and offering that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness amen will let you be seated like to speak to you this evening on pressure what fresh Erised pressurizer know we're living a great age of pressure and there's pressure all around us and it seems to be gaining every day you know brother Branham would speak about pressures and he would speak about AIDS day of Ages having pressures you speak about a thought tyre in church age talks about the Dark Age the pressure was either to bend or to be broken to bow or die it was the Inquisition and the power of em of the Empire backing up satanic worship being organized be organized or pay with your life see each age has its pressures for example the great burden of the last ages of pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in and I believe that don't seem like the tensions are getting any less it seems they're getting more you know it's one thing after another anymore as this new year has broken out on us you know we started with a plague that came upon the earth and you know whether a lot of it was government this that and the other I don't go get into all of that but you know it's just one thing after another on every side and now we have racial tensions and all things that are going on in the in this world and it's not going to get any better it's going to continue to get worse and it's going to continue to go down you know you know this this nation has been prophesied to be destroyed and you know and I know there's a lot of people that's crying pray for this nation pray for this nation but you know this nation this world is prophesied to be burnt with fire and and you know it's a place that is not a place to prepare for a future it's not a place to prepare for a you know a life here as far as in this world that we're living in this is not what we're here for we're here to leave this world and I think it's very very that we should have our mind made up that we're gonna keep our eye on one thing we're not gonna get drawn into political cynicism we're not going to draw it into whatever things that's on facebook or whatever things on social media that's not what our eyes are upon our eyes are upon another dimension and our eyes are our pone leaving here you know and and but in it for age of pressure or age of tension he would have to have a people who can take those those pressures or those tensions now you cannot take the pressures that that are in this age with your own human ability or your own human understand him because humanly you cannot understand how humans can treat other humans the way they treat them humanely you can't understand why the world or how the world is going this way and the way that it's going but the only way that you can take this pressure or the pressure of this age is to be pressurized is to have something around you as to as as song was singing thou art my shield thou art my dance my portion hey ma'am there's a people upon this earth that are pressurized they're not there their happiness or their joy is not determined on whether it's a good day or a bad day or or whether it's a good post on Facebook or bad put news on Facebook or bad news or good news on Fox News CNN or whatever you look at amen but they're there there everything about them is because is under a certain a pressure because they they're under another guidance earn under another realm a mam and you know as we lit read the scripture he said the scripture would speak about said he sits as a refiner or a purifier of silver now you know as you would put gold or you'd put silver in the fire it goes under a pressure it goes under you know it's intense heat and in 10 that builds up pressure in it but there's something that has taken place there's something that's going on as that pressure begins to build up around that gold or that silver and begins to aim and something begins to happen to it it begins to pull out the impurities are there and it begins to move and so it's very interesting that in this time that we're living in and this thing that we're going through that he said he shall sit as a refiner or a purifier of silver you know and I got to looking at this and I've come across a story of a people that was in a Bible study and they were studying this scripture and they begin to wonder what does this mean does this mean something about the character or the nature of God that he would sit as a refiner and he would sit over this and so this one person decided that she would go look up a silversmith him and make an appointment to watch him at work and and she began to watch as he would look at this and he would begin to heat the fire up and he would place the silver in there and he would he would hold the silver right in the middle of the fire where the flames were the hottest and and to burn away all the impurities and you know they did this person began to think how God is holding us in such a hot spot and we're in a hot spot if it ain't viruses is this over here is that over here it's a hurricane is coming as this that is always something we're in a very hot spot but you know she thought of you he thought this person thought again of this says God sitting as a refiner and she asked the silversmith of his truth that he had to sit in front of the fire the whole time the silver was being refined the man answered yes he not only had to sit there holding the silver but he had to keep his eyes on the sill hallelujah not only did he sit there holding the silver in the fire he kept his eyes on the silver and if this because he said if the silver was left even for one second too long in the flames it would be destroyed and then this person Allah silent for a minute and she said well then how do you know when the silver is ready to come out he smiled and answered oh it's easy when I see my image in it hallelujah and I'm thankful as we read the scripture and all the chaos and all the things that are going off on around us he hasn't taken taking his hand off of us hey man he hasn't taken his eye off of us proverbs 15 would say it like this the eyes of the Lord are in every place keeping watch on the evil and on the good amen so he keeps his eyes on us and second chronicles that saying for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the o earth to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless towards him so God's hands are upon you God's hands is holding you why you're in the fire God's eyes are on you while you're in the fire hallelujah isn't taking the day off he hasn't turned away from you while you're in this trouble I mean it may not mean you may not even be even tonight may be something totally different than what I'm even spoke about as far as the plagues or some political thing that's going on but it maybe it's something else maybe it's something personal but I want you to understand you may be in the fire but God's holding you there hey man he hasn't night and you may be in the fire but God's eyes are upon you hey man you know knowing that he is with you and nothing can harm you amen the fire is actually for your good the things that you're going through the trials of this life or actually for your good Amen that you shall come out of them as pure gold amen all these things worked out of your life and you can understand there's nothing can harm you there's neither powers there's neither things present there's another things future hallelujah there's nothing they're the things future so no matter what's coming in the future it's for our good it's far leaving here it's the is ready to leave nothing can separate us from him we are in him therefore we can take the pressures of this if you're in Christ you can take the pressures of this world hallelujah since we never caught your brother man will sit like this he's never we never come in by our own wheel but he by choice elected us and brought us into himself so it's his business to take care of of what he has taken into himself hallelujah don't you understand that you're in the fire but he's in the fire with you hallelujah he's taking you into himself it's his business to take care of you and it says no man can pluck you from my hands because he's a and he says it's the father who will take care of it and who's got more power than God there's government's a Mendes political political people and all this all this stuff that's going do they have more power than God come on somebody who has more power than God so what kind of power have you got that is holding you it's the power that created the universe it's the power that's holding the earth in this place it's the power that held the Sun there this morning it's the power that holds the Stars in their place that is the power that is holding you hallelujah amen it took the solar system anyway brother man I'm sitting with he was like that and it blew it out and every star went into its place and he's still holding there and that power is watching over you what kind of father do we have even you may be in the fire of sickness tonight but there's a father watching over you you may be in the fire of depression or the fire but fear the fire torment but there is a father that is watching over here and he's got his hands on you and he knows exactly the moment to snatch you out because he I'm not putting more on you than what you can bear but I'll make a way of escape and what is your way of escape tonight it's not too simple some party somewhere or some Republican or some Democrat or some government somewhere our way of escape it's not a government my way of escape this out of here however Escape is leaving this old file world that we're living in hallelujah that's what kind of father you have oh my he's watching everything he knows exactly when to take us out whoa be some pieces sweep over yard he knows exactly when the rapture said that button and we won't be left here a second too long but we're in age of pressure feels like it's coming from every side sickness deaths plagues political unrest but God is watching God sees it he has his hand on a brown his bride and he hasn't left the fire she's built for pressure amen it was a say here he tested this to make sure it would hold he he would go down to a river and be baptized in the Spirit of God would come upon him and indwell went inside of him and he tested it and it held him he tested that in intense pressure and political pressure of his day and unrest of his day and things going on in his day it held when he went to the Garden of Gethsemane and it said such pressure are you talking about pressure as he would fight amen as he would die and he would lay his life down and he would say not my will but thy will be done pressure he knows pressure he knows what it's like toads I have so much pressure on him till the sweat comes out like blood he knows all about pressure but it held as he walked to the cross inhaled as he took the nails in his hand they didn't take nails to hold him on the cross it held God always he would say it like this is that God always likens his people's to Eagles so he calls himself Jehovah eagle and we're his eaglets he said I made an illustration of many times how an eagle gets her little ones ready to fly and she takes him up in the air and turns him loose he said if a crow tried to get up there every feather would fall out of him he's not pressurized for it he can't stand the pressure but the Eagle is the only bird that's born with that kind of feather well you look different because I got a different feather that can go so high to a hawk can't even see around him he's hit the higher you go the further you can see and what good would it do a hawk to get up there if you don't have the eyes to see anyway he couldn't see back where it came from and he said that's the way it is with a Christian he said some of the people maybe got a buzzard this disposition and eating all the things of the world and the vultures and tried but trying to fly up with the Eagles if you try that you'll just blow up but there because there's too much pressure there a man you've got to be made for it and he was saying another place of my attention he said people want to paint a little a little almost a fairy tale on a mere exact words but and say when you come to Christ there's no tension he said when you come to Christ there's more tension than there's ever been a man but when you accept what when you're when you're pressurized or when you you have that spirit of that eagle inside of you you are made for that you know we know the story of him shooting a gun that was a different type of gun they tried to make it into a Weatherby my rifle I can no doubt get brother Mike up here and he can tell us all the all the caliber and this set and the other and exactly how it all went he's told me it before but that Weatherby that rifle was tried to be to me made into a wither B but it wasn't a Weatherby from the factory it was trying to maybe made into it maybe had some of the similar kind of steel on different things but it wasn't made to whether be to shoot a Weatherby rifle bull or the caliber that was a Weatherby powder or whatever he said but that's the way we find ourselves sometimes he said we find so many times that people just can't stand the pressure of being a Christian the pressure of being a Christian he said why it's because they have never died out to self and been born again hello somebody made from the dies of God to stand the load the pressure that comes against a real Christian he said you try to walk with a real saint of God and find that pressure hit against you you'll blow up and be back where you wants to begin with but if you've been born again and filled with God's Spirit then you're pressurized by God to stand the pressure you're pressurized by God to stand the pressure that the world can put against you but that must be first be born again he said he would talk about fish how they're pressured to live in a certain area you know I've I've been out with a deep-sea fishing you can actually when he pulled us fish up from so far down you pull them up and there's they're built for certain pressures a certain pressure down there can give you the exact but a certain is different than what you're up there on so when you bring them up they actually start blowing up and then you know if you go fishing they tell you to take take a something and they poke it in a certain spot and let that air back out and that fish a live but you know he said the fish is pressurized so it can live down there and if he comes up here to explode he said we're pressurized for the earth he said you said sea but said but what if that little fish would ever come to me would I ever want to go back to the midnight ink down there would ever want to be that kind of animal again and them kind of scientist insights and senses no sir I want to be a human he said now multiply that by a hundred million and I don't know maybe that's not even good enough but that's just almost an innumerable number a hundred million and then God has a chain has to change this mortal billion where we are and we're repressurized and taken up to his presence where we never want to be that kind of thing again far beyond that we're changed from the creature that we once was but you see people they're getting caught up in the political spirit they're getting caught up and supporting things they don't even know what they're supporting it's the truth well Johnny your breath bless me today with your prayer just touch me back there and sunders my hands shut up and begin to talk to the Lord and felt this presence move so near I'm so thankful brother Johnny that in this is this life that we live it ain't about how much money you got or don't have it ain't about how what color you are or you're not come on somebody oh my it ain't about none of that there's so much confusion what's true what's false there's only one thing that's true that is the Word of God there's only one thing you can stand upon in this time that we're living in that is the Word of God you can repost this and you can repost that I don't know if it's true or if it's false or what it is it doesn't make no difference to me I know what's true hallelujah and in this Bible he said I have a people I'd ever race every kinder every tongue and every people hallelujah it's not depending upon what color you are if you're making it a rapture hallelujah it's not depending upon what you have or what you don't have whether you go it's depending upon what's on the inside hallelujah and there is a people that are ready for liftoff hallelujah amen I got through watching as I mentioned Sunday about those men that was in their rocket and they begin to you know how they how the extra are sitting on top of a rocket could you imagine the power that is under them the pressure that is there it is very back up but it just for just any time the the buttons going to be pushed and all of a sudden those it was incredible I watched it as it took place as this big old huge frame of iron begin to lift up off the earth and sitting right on the top of this was a couple of men you think at that time they're worried about cope in nineteen hello or hurricane somewhere out there this unrest over here this war over here no there's they're looking up they're actually seated looking up because that's where they're going now you can look over here you can look over here if that's where you're going but if you're going that you better be looking this way you better be looking up amen the Bible says look up because your Redemption draweth now when you see all these things that Caesar roaring this is going on and then you know even in the Bible right you know it talks about the multitudes as he played with as the angel of God would coming down and put his hand his foot upon the land upon the sea it speaks about the land of the sea as being multitudes of people and Jesus would use seas roaring in this time and we see multitudes of people roaring things are going on unrest everywhere Amen not just in our nation it's all over the world seas are roaring this is not the time to be looking over there or over there or over there or in this spot device or that device this is the time to be looking up cuz that's why I'm going that's what I'm going there's a power under me at any moment control senator gonna say one two three four hey man that's how we count I know they may have been accounting ten nine eight seven brother Brennan said count down and our time is different its first stage second days third age fourteen fifteen six days seven days blast off and a man can make enough power to put under himself to take him out of this dimension don't you know God's got enough power amen under you tonight and is sitting there ready at any moment to push the button and we're leaving this whole world we're leaving this whole racism we're leaving this whole problem we're leaving this whole thing a division and disharmony we're leaving it all behind matter of fact we're leaving cancer behind we're leaving sugar diabetes behind wasn't even high blood pressures were high we're leaving sorrows behind wasn't even it all behind because these are people that's looking up hallelujah amen you see why people are looking at this looking at this because they don't believe they're leaving with them to iced Ranaut's had enough in them to believe we're leaving I'm getting in that thing hallelujah you know I don't know what to do I don't know what to believe I don't know what I say I don't know if I should say something or not say something there's only one thing to do look up its takeoff time do you a man it says there I'll read it for you now there's to be signs in the Sun and the moon and the stars and the earth distress of Nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear for looking after those sangwich are coming upon the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh oh praise the Lord you know the achievements of men has been able to do with all these natural achievements it's happening on the earth well Brandon would say it's just a forerunner of a spiritual achievement that God has done by his church all the natural danger just types of the spiritual things he said well how's that well he said let's take transportation first transportation was walking then horse and then they'll automobile then science built us an airplane first one to move one horsepower and then car maybe 20 horsepower and airplane goes up to hundreds of horsepower and just so when we come with a horse and then the automobile was made the next thing is airplane we just keep achieving higher and higher greater and greater this is the achievement of science but this is only a forerunner of the spiritual things hallelujah amen listen if we see a man take off into another dimension we ought to have enough about us to realize we can come to church and leave this old dimension and worship God in spirit and truth leave our old funny feelings behind and old things that as our little fuzzy things is going on leave it all behind and just worship God hey man this is a forerunner of the spiritual things that happened of God by his Spirit has been in his promised word the natural man by knowledge looks backwards for his achievement that science see what God has done is a former creation they go out and pick up clods pick up pieces of rock fossils element I'm together see on that achievement they're taking what God has done and perverting it from the original estate and making it his living quarters and so forth and his economy a little better by what it has been created that's the natural achievement by man but God in the spiritual achievement is going forward not backward he's going forward looking into the word believing the promises for things that has never come yet for the spiritual revelations to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised he sees them come to pass just as a scientist in his laboratory are working on different things to help man take creation the taking creation the spiritual man is looking forward to something God promised and I want you to understand even a science progressed it wasn't go here and here and here and then go backwards no it's kept going forward one horse two horse fifty horse hundred horse thousand horse rockets view so if the physical world is doing at how much more is the spiritual world moving forward I'm not looking for less of God I'm looking for more of God I'm not looking for less of God's power I'm looking for more of God power I'm not looking for less of healings I'm looking for more of healings I'm not looking for less salvations I'm looking for more salvation I'm not looking for enough less of nothing - what comes to God I'm looking for more of God the natural church he says then taking back the natural so they look back to Phinny sank he nods Calvin that was alright but that was their day we on the other hand are looking forward to something else the promise that's greater and higher hey man what God has promised science goes back and picks it up but the Word of God goes forward so we see here science has been able to achieve more horsepower did it by taking the power and making greater instruments and automobiles and airplanes and God is achieving in the same manner way back in the loot days of Luther their power was horse power by getting Luther in his hands by God getting Luther in his hands in the fire the refiner in the fire sitting at the fire controlled out of a great organization out of a great system he let the man see that just shall live by faith and when he was able to achieve justification and preach it and the church came to life it come to life and begin to move just a little bit back under the days of one horsepower when the horsepower was ready to get fade out Nick and all the sudden of the carriage and the horse and buggy hit now he achieved justification and moved on a little further and a little further down the road Amen justified by faith and now sanctification by the spirit it was a man named John Wesley under his control it took him out of all the isms away from him he was able by John Wesley to bring the church into sanctification moving forward the automobile now moving forward could you imagine the first time a man you see funny videos of people doing things to their old folks you know and putting these new-age technologies on them and things could you imagine and now today Oh a car isn't it just everyday thing is this a progress and it's gotten greater and bigger and better and all that I had more functions and more buttons and more of this and that the other but it's still a car when you get down with the bones of it it's still a car and so and so anyway when when they when they could you imagine the first person has it maybe living to stick somewhere and all he knew was a horse and well here it comes his put put things up his driveway and the guy says get in it's safe get in take a lot of convincing to convince a man like that and you go on down to the next stage they're playing God might have been doing pretty good in a car but I love a sudden you're telling me to getting something that's going to leave this good old terra cotta there's earth that I'm standing on and you're gonna tell me to getting something to leave this place no if he didn't know about it didn't see all the things that were going on and maybe miss the days of over and Wilbur Wright he missed all of that and all of a sudden somebody comes to getting this thing where we going we're going to Walmart no we're going up there hub where it was a progression it was moving things were taking place and you can see even and that why the Lutheran's didn't want to go on with the Westlands and the Westlands didn't want to go on with the Pentecostals and the Pentecostals don't want to go on with us hey man see sanctification raised the church to his feet and got it able to walk now at the end of Wesley's age was automobile we realized he said now see every former comes out at the end of the age we find out the Weslie at the last of his church agent comes just before the Pentecost we did see the church got enough strength through sanctification to walk away from the things of the world separated for the glory of God it's too bad it lost that but it got strength enough Luther gave it light into the horse and buggy Wesley gave it life through sanctification separating the self from the world and then through the little branches of pilgrim holiness and Nazarene let's learn more down through the sanctification but remember it couldn't stay still the pillar of fire kept moving ke mezuzah street represented their playing days from the automobile God was able by the Wright brothers to take a motor in a little same kind of metal same kind of everything but have just a little design different design to it and make it lift off this earth mercy when the Holy Spirit fell on the Zuza Street supernatural was made known no tongues fell in things were happening miracles were taking place a man what happened he said would notice all these things are achievements he said but the Spirit of God is still moving home see he always does it that way he told us in the sides and watch for the signs OB in the sky that things would be happening just we just read the scripture just before the coming of Christ we see that it's only a pointings flood it's only saying look look what's taking place we see science where they're at but we all see won't see what God has achieved by his church don't ever forget that what God is achieved by his church you know man don't the far as I know is there anybody in here that want to go back to a horse and buggy and to be honest with you if you had the money and the ability to own maybe a helicopter or airplane to take you off on trips you wouldn't ever want to go back to a - it - it to a car and I've seen some of you post if y'all could have got on that rocket you did got on it but see what is it a horse and buggy - a car it's just more horses than just more power horse them buy a car - uh-uh airplane what is it is just more horses at it it's just more something going home when John Wesley found sanctification a set-aside work from justification he didn't condemn justification is only more power added to it when the Pentecostals found the baptism the Holy Ghost the restoration the gifts they never denied sanctification or justification they just went more power and raised up and went on more while they had more powernow all those things foreshadowing as they come up what was it God's achievement in his church and we find from the Azusa Street planes took off over we're a great revival swept the world heavenly places speaking in unknown tongues gifts war the world being burnt over by God got his hands on a group of people in the fire me going down he said what happened says she left these intellectual churches grounded pinnacles left these intellectual churches grounded when Pentecost took office speaking in tongues and gifts of healing they healed the sick they done great things they've done it there's no doubt but what they've done is proof what they've done sure it did they left this intellectual church sitting on the ground saying well you can't do this and you can't do that brother Branham used as a statement I tried to look it up and I couldn't find it anywhere and I don't know what it's referring to maybe somebody here somebody out there that's in this time frame might know what it's meant but he said like a little boy in jail for shooting the gumbo a gumbo only I know about gumbo is eating it I thought maybe something to do with marbles or song I don't know shooting a gumbo but somebody came in and said the little boy came in to visit him who had he got throwed in jail he said all they can't put you in jail for that and he said they can't and he was because he was said what you mean they Caine I'm already here so browner wasn't nothing that seemingly he put in jail for whatever it was he said Vidal they can't look I'm already here and he said that's the way they say about the Holy Ghost they say the Holy Ghost is for another age that's what they think it's here hallelujah we know it's here we've been flying in the air under the influence of it amen seeing the things that the intellectual people know nothing about only thing they can do is sit down there and sing and just make fun of it he said like a little cat from the stall one time you know the story out of the stall I said well you know he's big fat and round and sassy he jumped out of the stall when he's let out on that beautiful day and he began to kick it up his heels and and shout or you can move and have a good time he said what was he had a fine farmer that fed him good vitamins all year round the other old lazy farmer over there had this little calf born in the winter and a little fella hadn't eaten nothing but weeds and when he come out he's so poor he couldn't hardly move and every time the wind would blow it shove him sideways he said they'd seen this little fat calf up there kicking his heels and having a great time and he goes huh fanaticism he said well what was the difference the different was one was full of good vitamins he said no wonder he could kick up his heels he said and when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost there's something in him that's full of God's spiritual vitamins it makes him want to praise God for what he's done it makes him on a shout it makes him want to act different why he's no longer out to bound he's in the heavens he's left them earthbound on their bicycles and their automobiles saying days of miracles are past ain't no such a thing as a Holy Ghost saying we're here like Jesus was at the cross the spirit left him now we're here by ourselves baloney when that spirit lifts off that is the power that's taken us he's about friends may I say this it has come to the age of the astronaut we got more power now did you hear me did you hear the prophet of God we got more power now how many believes that the astronaut ages here we're coming to the spiritual age of the astronaut it's the same spirit only more power only lifting us up power and the higher we go and the more we can believe and the more like Christ not the automobile not the horse and buggy not in the airplane but the astronaut moving us up above each one it's called the Eagle H in the Bible God calling his prophets Malachi for the promise of the last days God is able now to achieve for himself a bride he's going to in the last days be able to get a bride hello to somebody he said well look at all this chaos he's going to be and the last in the last age able to get himself a bride with the ministry that's so exactly like a man whose wife becomes one so exactly like him went to Hobart gets to his fish people like him he lives and his people they are one he's a dinner will fulfill the scripture John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll come on somebody not a prophet a people and it will also fulfill what Jesus said would take place as it was in the days of Sodom so shall I be in this coming of the Son of Man but I astronaut age the astronaut sees things that the horse rider and the automobile and the airplanes and either sees he goes higher did you hear me he sees things greater and beyond what we can see those astronauts up there not seeing the riots they're not seeing the co vid 19 they're not seeing all the political unrest and the problems all over the world and wars and rumors they're not seeing none of that they've traveled around the earth about seventeen hundred two hundred seventeen thousand two hundred miles an hour 16 sunrises and sunsets a day that's moving and we're called to be astronauts they're moving faster than the problems they're moving faster than the sickness they're moving faster than the unrest and the problems going on in this earth they're moving around and around and around and around we have been called to this heavenly atmosphere to this place not to be and we're not to be in a bicycle no more not an automobile no more seeing all the problems around us and all the things and our focus it's all out there somewhere he said just as sure as God has testified by the natural things happening here so is he testifying that if we have achieved an astronaut God has achieved what he promised to achieve in the last days according to Malachi for only thing he has to do is get somebody in his hands that can cut loose from the airplanes and the automobiles and whatsoever Lord that's keeping you art bound not look back to what it was but more power to lift him high and lift him into the presence of God lift you up where all things are possible see that's what's happening listen I I can't help but believe as he says he's speaking about here in the countdown of what the natural types of spiritual and here we are again in this year amidst all this chaos a rocket takes full out the spiritual astronaut goes above the planes planes are wrecking up fussing in the clouds and did you hear that fussing in the clouds that where Facebook is in the clouds Instagram in the clouds our problem is our heads are in the clouds and not on the coming of the Lord this is why you get people so discouraged and people posting this and posting that and posting this they've got their eyes on the wrong thing either we believe this message or we don't believe it it gets greater gets more airplanes are still down there wreck and fuss and grounded everything like that but the astronauts that are not grounded he goes above the clouds he goes above the Creed's he goes beyond the denomination's above what anyone says is this isn't so or that is so he has got a God and that God is the Holy Spirit and the word tells him so and he moves on how does the science make an astronaut he takes what power they got and it keeps going into it and going into and further and further until he can move out of this atmosphere into another he said what does how does he find out how to do this he takes what's off paper and he figures it out and the same thing as any man can sit down and read the Word of God and see what's promised searched the scriptures search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life said Jesus he said that earthbound BOTS they head back there in them days didn't know who he was but he said you begin to take it off the pages and put it into action that's exactly what they've done they drew they drew and they drew and they drew and they drew and they drew and they drew all kind of blueprints for rockets and rocket fuel and how to do this and how to do their test and test but one day it was time to take it off the paper and put it on the pad and get ready to light it up hey man it's time that we get off the paper we're gonna be written epistles read of all men living a living voice not just quoting the scripture but living a scripture not just quoting a quote but living a quote not just quoting some man this and something but living the gospel of Jesus Christ define ever devilled define ever spirit of hell define sickness right to his face and say by my His stripes I am healed and that stryn OTT he moves out beyond all those things he's not bound by the car anymore do all he can see is right around him all he can see is the things on this earth that's going on no he's seeing them different place he said when the astronauts in the air there's something controlling him it's called radar and I'm sure it's developed even further ZnO doubt beyond the 664 radar moves him shows him where is that tells him what he's doing and it's directing him that's an astral astronaut I watched them as they would they would had lifted off and this you know parts fell away and this set and they go onto there and they get ready as I spoke about his Sunday a little bit and they got lined up with that International Space Center and they begin to move and you see this little puffs they look like puffs of smoke would blow out this way or blow out this way and then one day they were lining up to a perfect connection what do you think's going on in this age that we're living here he's the refiner and he's holding you this may pull over here and it pulls it over here and it put but just keep your eyes we're lining up for a perfect connection the spiritual astronaut has a control power it has a control tower it has a power in a control tower isn't it it's not down here it's like the like man is it's up there it's the Holy Ghost that's in him that's controlling him the tower of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's under control it keeps him in control by the word not a bunch of fanaticism not a bunch of whooped up nonsense but thus sayeth the Lord and it happens it's always under control he's got a control tower that's the Holy Ghost then the word is his program and he lays right in that program and the power of the Holy Ghost and douse him to move out and it brings him over this way and it brings him over that way to get him in perfect line to achieve what God wants to be achieved for his people my he goes on down he talks about the clock ticking to midnight and the destruction that's going on then it is about to take place in this world this world is about to burn with fire that's not a man's words that's these words and either we either we believe it or we don't he said the clock of science they say it's three minutes to midnight I almost wonder how many seconds we got to midnight we're at the end they have found the thing that will destroy them it's here what's going to destroy this earth it's already here it ain't waiting to be developed it's not in some development someone it's already here they found the thing that will destroy them they found everything the astronaut can get in the air and go over with the atomic power powers of simpler and say surrender or be blowed up three minutes until midnight they have worked on what God had done they biz able to provide it instead of trying to make life they're always trying to find a way to kill somebody or I don't do the next thing or beat the next nation or beat the next place that's what you're trying to do but man looks on calling man his brother and trying to lead him to home where he won't have to die one is death the others is life but these and death only does that represent life he said the clock is ticking upon the achievement of science today three minutes to midnight God's great clock is still ticking though Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we have arrived he says one is clicking to death one is clicking to life one is clicking the destruction one is clicking to get out of here he says we have arrived the works that I do shall you do also we have arrived hello somebody we are here and just as the powers are here to destroy the earth the power to fulfill the Word of God is here right now and the works that he did shall we do also and even greater than these things shall we do more Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's on the earth and the power of the Holy Ghost to make the word live and do for his church that's exactly what he promised it to do and he's filling his astronauts whoa how do we maybe I need to preach that to you he's on the earth in the power of the Holy Ghost to make his word live and do his church do for his church exactly what he promised it would do it's a power here to fulfill everything that the word has been spoke and it's filling his astronaut his astronaut so not for destruction not for death not for plagues not for political unrest it's less filling us up to leave this old world to leave it all behind so they got in their big scientific tube he says not long ago astronaut tube taking the countdown headed for the moon they're going off of here too they got an astronaut in a big tube powered by atomic power where they can send it plumb to the moon they claim they got in a tube and we're waiting for the countdown the spiritual astronaut has also gotten to Christ and is listening to the countdown of the word what are you listening to tonight hello somebody what do you listen to tonight are you listening to the countdown of the world or the word is that he said now you Lutheran's ought to shout you Baptist Presbyterian watch the countdown of the word and we're not headed to the moon we're headed for heaven [Music] they'll pass the moon so fast they won't even see it waiting for the countdown what are they're doing they're wrapped in Christ and rapture and grace nothing they did themselves Christ took the uneducated the foolish things of the world wrapped his and astronauts in it and empowered them with the Holy Ghost for what to take off this world is going to be left alone to burn I don't think it's coincidence that there's people on this earth today they're supposed to be highly educated people that says we never went to the moon there's still people even message people apparently that I've heard believes this is a flat earth somebody's got a virus or I just called the Moroni virus listen there's viruses I was think about this today there's viruses out there that I'm a lot more scared of than Corona it's viruses of laodicea that are inflicting people and you see it out there they put it out there for the world to see no shame yet say their message they're not message they got a virus and people are today or say it ain't there and never went to the moon and got all these conspiracy stuff no idea no doubt they're trying to denied the super into the power that took an astronaut off of the earth into another atmosphere and you see it in the spiritual realms there's no such a thing as a prophet there's no such a thing as a man who's seen the other side come on somebody same spirit it's a demonic spirit let me tell you what we're seeing today in this earth is not god it's the denominator it has taken over the minds of men but there's also another people that's being taken over like we heard Sunday now with the mind of some psychotic or some denominator D demonic spirit but the mind of Jesus Christ it is so far far into this world and they're thinking that they think we're the ones that's crazy we're the ones that's crazy to believe a man could leave this atmosphere and to go somewhere else we're the one that's crazy to believe in a body change we're the one that's crazy to believe that God can heal we're the ones that's crazy to believe that we can shout and sing and dance and praise of God that they don't think exists the ear infected with a virus and as a virus much worse than Corona when John Glenn and I asked him not God in a big tube to take off the nation stood speechless they didn't know that morning when he took off when he did he got in the - everybody's crying waiting watching nation stood spellbound TVs blare and everything so everybody could see they're not sure I couldn't see it because they had to put it on a television so the world could see it he said when he got placed up in the tube just right and when he did they started ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero and off there if he lifted begin to catch fire beneath him begin to break and the smoke begin to roll and all of a sudden is that things shimmered and they begin to move that big tube took off in the air into the unknown somewhere he took off in man's achievements the greatest achievement man has ever had but let me tell you that's just a small thing one of these morning's one of these morning's God's achievement of his astronauts that have climbed into Jesus Christ and been born by the Spirit of God filled with this power Oh hallelujah one of these morning the whole universe will be screaming and wailing and gnashing of teeth when they realize they missed it but that great Eagle powered by the Holy Ghost and fire whoa hallelujah it begins to spread her wings and the astronaut will take off and go to meet the bridegroom in the air oh my water power hallelujah and we can hear it counting one two three four five six seven takeoff oh what a day that's going to be what a moment that's going to be but the only way you're gonna realize that it's because you've been pressurized by the Holy Ghost to take off from this dimension into another world however I believe there's a people on this earth that is not they they're not pressurized or not not under the proton and the influence of some denomination demonic spirits somewhere or some satanic thing somewhere or some political thing somewhere that's not where they're getting their influence but they're getting it from the mind of Jesus Christ and they're sitting on a power that's greater than any power ever known to the earth it is a power that raised the man for days from the dead it is a power that changed the life and one moment was a drunkard and the next day of sober man is a power that took a chain-smoker and sheathe wrote it down and never smoked again it's a power that raised you up and you were and you up were hallelujah and it's here on this herd and we are getting ready for takeoff we're getting ready to leave there so he'll bounder and all his problems and all the situation and all its viruses and all the sickness cancer is about to be left behind the bird sure the diabetes has left behind the bird depression and fear and anxiety left behind the bird why you lift off from this place who's going who's going who say Lord I'm ready I'm ready to leave it so he'll pound earth and lift into another dimension hallelujah there is a power that will take the bride officer to meet her bridegroom are you pressurized tonight how you're wrapped up tired of tangled up in Jesus Christ and you don't care what the world says or what it believes where this was in power or that one's in power it makes no difference to me cuz I know who reigns our God reigns he's alive he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's got a power that will lift you up out of the little doldrums lift you up out of that old sickness that you're dealing with and lift you about that place she is getting ready she is getting resurrected power in her to fly beyond the things of the world who know hallelujah says get ready get in my brother if you ain't in get in get in get pressurize the pressure won't hurt you when you get on the inside Oh hallelujah hallelujah there's nothing present nor future that can take you out of away from here if you're in inside with Christ none of that pressure will hurt you it's only God in here you listen this get in Christ and you no longer will care what the world says hello somebody you're safe you're tucked in Jesus Christ is our great glorious astronaut two musicians can come then we're in it and we will be propelled by the Holy Ghost in power and fire and when she begins to fly out of one of these morning's the Holy Ghost fire hit the earth like that like never before and the church will be lifted up know hallelujah hold God lift us up he asked the question are you driving a horse and buggy did you are you riding in the automobile are you in the clouds with the plane he said I got something to tell you get in the astronaut tape get it this is an astronaut H we're leaving here Jesus Christ is here that great astronaut tube that were to be in cloud overs won't mean one thing he'll break every cloud of doubt he'll break every unbelief he'll sweep it yonder into space if you haven't gotten to him yet get in now it's takeoff time let's bow our heads are you pressurized or are you under pressure is it weaken your faith or are you stronger in the faith [Music] well yet only you know are you on a bicycle a car airplane are you in the tube [Music] the astronaut [Music] people are Craig cave into this pressure getting so caught up in it [Music] this very nation rejected the Word of God there's nothing left for her but destruction nothing I'm as patriotic as anybody but there's nothing left of this for this world this nation but to burn and she's going to burn that's thus saith the Lord and none of your prayers are going to stop it it's going to happen what you need to be focused in are you in the tube are you in Christ Jesus are you pressurized or is the pressure getting to you [Music] get in the tooth humm go I'm go can you really sing it there's nothing here to hold me Oh [Music] ah have you caught Oh [Music] I know [Music] Oh
