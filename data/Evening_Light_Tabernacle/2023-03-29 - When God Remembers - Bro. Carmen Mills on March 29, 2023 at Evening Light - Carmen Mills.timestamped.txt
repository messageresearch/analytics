[47:37] able to speak personally

[47:51] brother Brandon was a year I go and he'd
[47:53] see a vision but you don't need that the
[47:55] word is a discerner if you ever need

[48:29] me you know these people Lord you know
[48:32] the needs that might be among them you
[48:33] know where a word might be needed Lord
[48:36] and I pray that you would allow us to
[48:39] say those things that would be helpful
[48:41] that would be edifying Lord to your
[48:43] people tonight we pray we just commit
[48:46] this part of the service to you now For
[48:47] Your Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's
[48:50] name we pray
[48:51] amen
[48:53] we'll have you turn to the the
[48:55] scriptures I don't want to keep you
[48:56] standing to Genesis 19.
[49:00] Genesis 19.
[49:03] read beginning from the 27th verse
[49:12] through to the 29th verse
[49:15] and Abraham got up early in the morning
[49:17] to the place where he stood before the
[49:21] Lord
[49:22] and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah
[49:24] and behold all the land of the plain
[49:27] and be held and lo the smoke of the
[49:28] country went up as a smoke of a furnace
[49:31] and it came to pass when God destroyed
[49:34] the cities of the plane that God
[49:35] remembered Abraham and sent Lord out of
[49:38] the midst of the overthrow when he
[49:40] overthrew the cities in the witch law
[49:42] dwelt
[49:43] may be seated
[49:46] before I
[49:48] before I speak on on what the Lord's put
[49:50] on my heart tonight there was I was
[49:52] listening as I was coming up here I was
[49:53] in New Orleans here for for work and I
[49:56] and I drove up today which is a little
[49:58] bit of a drive and so I had the
[50:00] opportunity to listen to a message and
[50:03] and the message I listened to was I
[50:05] stand at the door and knock
[50:07] and in there brother Branham
[50:09] you know gives the example and he uses
[50:11] it in many places he talks about
[50:13] he said if I was hungry and somebody
[50:15] gave me 25 cents he said you know I
[50:17] could be just as happy with that as with
[50:20] the bread that I need
[50:22] but in this message he hit he went on in
[50:24] a little bit more detail because and I
[50:27] think it's something that maybe we miss
[50:30] so the purchase power is is is
[50:32] equivalent to the faith that we that we
[50:34] get when we you know that's the piece
[50:37] but but the but the prophet preached
[50:39] another message that said tested Faith
[50:41] produces goods and we're maybe not
[50:44] accustomed to the fact that many times
[50:45] God tests us a little bit with our faith
[50:48] because you don't need faith if your
[50:50] need is met if God comes tonight and you
[50:52] reach out and you you get an instant
[50:54] healing an instant answer well there's
[50:57] no faith being exercised too much there
[50:58] but but the faith is what stands there
[51:01] in the place of the thing that you hope
[51:02] for that's what the Bible says it's an
[51:04] actual substance and so and so brother
[51:07] Brandon said I'm just as good with this
[51:08] 25 cents in my hand but I want you to
[51:11] notice some things he said that really
[51:13] kind of struck me he said he said I get
[51:15] this 25 cents and he said I go down the
[51:17] street
[51:18] and you said I cross over the river and
[51:20] I go through the Briar Patch so you know
[51:23] he doesn't get the bread rate off
[51:26] doesn't happen overnight sometimes
[51:28] he said I'm getting hungrier I'm getting
[51:30] hungrier all the time he said I haven't
[51:32] got the bread yet but all the time I'm
[51:34] going I'm rejoicing
[51:37] because I've got the purchase power but
[51:40] not just the purchase power brother
[51:42] Brenham said but the assurance that the
[51:44] bread belongs to me
[51:47] oh yeah and that's the thing the devil I
[51:49] think gets a lot of us at is is we
[51:52] believe that God can do it
[51:54] we believe God can heal us we believe
[51:56] God can deliver us we believe God can
[51:58] save our loved ones he can do it
[52:00] but you got to go from the can to the
[52:02] will
[52:03] that God will do it that it's mine
[52:06] it's not just possible but that it's
[52:07] going to happen
[52:09] and that's where the faith comes in so
[52:11] he said he said I've got to purchase
[52:13] power and the assurance that the bread
[52:14] belongs to me
[52:16] and he goes on he said before I get
[52:18] there he said I might have cramps I'm so
[52:21] hungry
[52:22] so I might have cramps I I might get
[52:25] Delirious he said until I'm fighting my
[52:27] way through the bushes like a madman
[52:31] he said I could get like that that's how
[52:32] bad it could get but as long as I'm
[52:34] holding the 25 cents
[52:37] he said the bread has got to come
[52:40] it has got to come
[52:42] so what is the devil doing when you get
[52:44] that faith in a service that the Lord is
[52:46] going to meet your need now the devil's
[52:48] trying to get you to lose that 25 cents
[52:50] you've got it in your hand but he's
[52:52] trying to knock it out of your hand life
[52:55] about a year ago and it's a story for
[52:57] another day but I was running I run a
[52:59] little bit for exercise I was going
[53:01] across the road street with a fellow I
[53:03] was ahead of him and this lady was
[53:05] coming in a car I thought she saw me but
[53:08] she didn't and she was traveling fairly
[53:10] quickly and I got hit and thrown about
[53:12] 20 feet in the air but I had pulled my
[53:14] phone out because I was near the end of
[53:15] my run and it and it knocked the phone
[53:17] out of my hand but I didn't actually
[53:19] know it did
[53:20] and if it wasn't for the fellow that was
[53:22] there I wouldn't have even got it back
[53:25] probably I wasn't even looking for it
[53:27] because of the distraction
[53:28] so you're you're claiming something you
[53:30] got the 25 cents
[53:32] you're claiming something then the Devil
[53:34] comes along with something else and he
[53:35] tries to get you to let go
[53:37] of that Faith you got
[53:39] but you've got to hold on to that for
[53:41] dear life because that is your Assurance
[53:43] of your victory of whatever it is that
[53:45] you're claiming
[53:47] because God will come through he will
[53:50] he'll come through he'll bring it to
[53:52] pass but we can't prescribe when
[53:55] Prophet said we can't say we can't tell
[53:57] God when he will answer but we can't
[54:00] prescribe when it's going to be
[54:02] no I want to go to my side I want to
[54:04] speak on the thought of when God
[54:06] remembers
[54:08] when God remembers
[54:10] now God we know
[54:12] the Bible says God he doesn't look like
[54:15] us the Bible says we have never seen God
[54:17] no man has seen God at any time he
[54:19] dwells in another dimension Prophet said
[54:21] he dwells in a place he's he's a being
[54:24] he dwells in a place but we don't know
[54:26] what he looks like you know he's in that
[54:28] realm that other dimension that we can't
[54:30] see but we know that he can come to this
[54:32] one whenever he chooses to and declare
[54:34] himself but we do notice also in the
[54:37] scripture because God wants to be
[54:39] personal with us that throughout the
[54:41] scriptures we see
[54:43] the Bible described him with these
[54:46] personal attributes he personifies many
[54:48] of his attributes so we read about God
[54:51] hearing we read about God speaking
[54:53] and and touching and all these things
[54:55] that are human attributes but we see God
[54:59] expressing those and we also read and
[55:02] can see where it speaks about God's mind
[55:04] and about God's memory and about God
[55:07] remembering is where we're coming to but
[55:09] of course God's memory is not like our
[55:11] memory our memory is is not good many
[55:14] times you know it is said that every
[55:16] experience we ever have that that those
[55:19] thoughts and those experiences are all
[55:21] there in our mind our trouble is
[55:23] bringing those memories and those
[55:25] thoughts to the Forefront
[55:28] sometimes it takes a trigger I was
[55:29] somewhere one time many years ago and
[55:31] and I smelt a certain smell and when I
[55:35] smelled that it took me back to when I
[55:37] was in elementary school when my mother
[55:40] used to pack me a lunch in this
[55:41] particular I had a lunch box a yellow
[55:43] lunch box that flipped open I had a
[55:45] thermos on one side my lunch in the
[55:46] other and she used to tape a dime or 15
[55:49] cents in the top I'd used to buy milk
[55:51] and all of a sudden that memory which I
[55:53] probably hadn't thought about maybe
[55:55] since then
[55:56] come flooding back just from that
[55:58] trigger
[55:59] but God doesn't need a trigger for his
[56:02] memory because he knows everything that
[56:04] has ever happened or ever will happen
[56:07] but God does remember and and but his
[56:11] his remembrance if you take the
[56:13] definition of remember it just simply
[56:14] means to call to mind
[56:17] and with God he can call to mind any
[56:19] thought at any time
[56:20] and so every promise that God has ever
[56:22] made in the scriptures he has not
[56:24] forgotten it but there's a time when he
[56:26] will bring that thought forward he will
[56:29] remember it it could be triggered by
[56:31] something that we do or could be just
[56:33] something he does and we want to look at
[56:34] a few examples in the scripture just to
[56:37] build some background for this thought
[56:39] I want to look at Noah first of all
[56:42] we all know the story of Noah how that
[56:44] he was called out that God was going to
[56:47] send a judgment upon the earth a flood
[56:48] of waters he understood that he believed
[56:51] that he preached the message he built an
[56:53] ark and then there was a day that came
[56:55] when God sent the animals in and told
[56:57] Noah it's your turn now to go in the ark
[57:00] and he closes the door I want to look at
[57:03] this timeline there's many descriptions
[57:06] of how the timing of this went I'm just
[57:07] taking one of them they're all fairly
[57:09] close but we know that he went in the
[57:11] ark and he was there for seven days
[57:13] first of all nothing happened no rain
[57:15] brother Bram talks about that I'm not
[57:18] going to take that time so he's there
[57:19] for seven days then the rain begins and
[57:23] it rains for 40 days and 49 so now he's
[57:25] in the ARK for 47 days now the purpose
[57:27] of this flood is Noah understands it is
[57:30] to destroy all flesh that breathe the
[57:33] breath
[57:34] well after that 47 days maybe add a
[57:37] couple days if you want pretty much
[57:39] everything was gone then the work was
[57:42] accomplished
[57:44] and it doesn't say much about what Noah
[57:46] thought but if I was Noah sitting in the
[57:48] yard with what I understood about things
[57:51] I'd be kind of thinking it was soon time
[57:53] to get out
[57:55] you know because the work is done why am
[57:57] I still here
[57:58] but yet we know that the flood covered
[58:01] the Earth
[58:02] for another 150 days after that so now
[58:05] we're up to 197 days why
[58:08] and and I I can't imagine that Noah
[58:10] wouldn't have thought that in his mind
[58:11] you know why is God waiting why is God
[58:15] delaying you know taking me out and
[58:17] maybe somebody has an answer but we know
[58:19] that many times we go through things in
[58:21] life for which the answer escapes us
[58:24] we don't know why it happens
[58:27] and the why question is not wrong it's
[58:29] just the it's the attitude with which we
[58:31] we have it but but wondering why is
[58:34] normal
[58:35] it's normal
[58:37] you remember Gideon in the Bible
[58:39] Gideon was there a faithful man a
[58:43] Believer but but you know he was under
[58:45] the pressure of the enemy all the time
[58:47] and this man this Angel of the Lord
[58:49] comes to Gideon and you remember what he
[58:51] says to him he says you know you you are
[58:54] he calls him a mighty man of Valor
[58:58] now Gideon I'm sure Gideon was just
[59:00] scratching his head over that because
[59:02] how on Earth is that possible
[59:05] I'm a mighty man of Valor and I'm being
[59:07] I'm being overrun by these by this enemy
[59:09] of Israel
[59:11] and and yet he was because God sees you
[59:14] and he sees me differently than we see
[59:18] ourselves
[59:19] because we see our faults and we see our
[59:22] failures and we fail every day brother
[59:23] Brown said we fail every day
[59:25] and so those failures the enemy loves to
[59:27] bring them up he loves to condemn us
[59:29] because of them and and that and that
[59:33] dwelling on those things hinders our
[59:34] faith many times because we think well
[59:36] God's not going to answer my prayer
[59:38] because I'm such a failure but that's
[59:40] not true and that's not the way God sees
[59:42] you
[59:43] but Gideon asked you know asked why
[59:47] and even Jesus
[59:49] you know on the cross Jesus was on the
[59:51] cross there
[59:53] and we know the weight of the sins
[59:54] coming upon his shoulders and as that
[59:56] takes place we know that the the father
[59:58] whose presence he's always felt his
[1:00:00] whole life
[1:00:01] and now in his darkest time sometimes
[1:00:04] that's the way it seems in your darkest
[1:00:06] trial when you're looking for God it's
[1:00:08] when he seems to vanish
[1:00:11] and so he feels the presence of the
[1:00:13] father pulling away and he cries out he
[1:00:15] says my God my God why
[1:00:17] why have you forsaken me why
[1:00:21] and so the why question is not the
[1:00:23] problem
[1:00:24] but remember God never goes far even if
[1:00:28] he seems away remember Job in the Bible
[1:00:30] in his trial
[1:00:31] in his deep trial he went looking for
[1:00:33] God you read the scripture I look
[1:00:36] forward
[1:00:36] can't find him I look backward I look
[1:00:38] left and I look to the right he's not
[1:00:40] there in fact he even said he even
[1:00:41] acknowledged that God was hiding himself
[1:00:44] he was hiding himself
[1:00:47] but he had a revelation which we all
[1:00:48] need to have that even if you can't see
[1:00:51] God he can always see you
[1:00:54] job said he knew that the Lord knows the
[1:00:57] way that I take he said
[1:00:59] he knows where you are there's no pet
[1:01:00] that's so black
[1:01:02] that God's eyes can't Pierce down into
[1:01:05] there's no place you can be where God
[1:01:06] doesn't see where you are
[1:01:09] and so Noah is in the ARK for all this
[1:01:11] time 150 197 days now
[1:01:15] but then we come to Genesis 8 and 1.
[1:01:17] and in Genesis 8 1 we don't see any
[1:01:20] trigger for this we don't see somebody
[1:01:22] praying or crying out we're going to see
[1:01:24] some examples of that but in this case
[1:01:26] the Bible just simply says and God
[1:01:28] remembered Noah
[1:01:31] but God had never forgotten no it's not
[1:01:33] because he forgot about him but it was
[1:01:35] time now and when God when God remembers
[1:01:38] it's because he's about to do something
[1:01:41] he's about to act
[1:01:42] the Bible says God remember no every
[1:01:45] living thing and all the cattle that was
[1:01:47] with him in the ark and God made a wind
[1:01:49] to pass over the earth and the waters
[1:01:51] assuaged
[1:01:54] but now you look at that and Noah
[1:01:55] probably recognized he probably heard
[1:01:57] the win and thought now God is doing
[1:01:58] something I'm going to get out of here
[1:02:00] soon
[1:02:01] but you know
[1:02:03] he was there
[1:02:05] for a while another 74 days
[1:02:08] a God could have dried those Waters up
[1:02:10] in a day
[1:02:12] but 74 days he's there the wind's
[1:02:15] blowing he hears it and all of a sudden
[1:02:17] as after after 74 days they can see the
[1:02:20] tops of the mountains so we're getting
[1:02:21] there
[1:02:23] but then there's another 40 Days no one
[1:02:25] sends out the Raven and the Dove and so
[1:02:27] on and then there's another 14 days
[1:02:29] after that and finally the dry land
[1:02:32] appears and so now you think okay
[1:02:34] everything's done it's all dried up
[1:02:36] let's go nope he's there for another 57
[1:02:39] days
[1:02:40] for a total of 382 days over a year
[1:02:44] Noah knew that God was the one that put
[1:02:47] him in there
[1:02:49] and he was waiting for the god to say
[1:02:51] it's time to get out
[1:02:53] he was faithful and we have to be too
[1:02:55] and so so God lingers sometimes
[1:02:58] sometimes he allows us to go through
[1:03:00] things but we have to hold on to that 25
[1:03:03] cents we have to hold on to that faith
[1:03:05] God will remember us
[1:03:08] he will remember us he hasn't forgotten
[1:03:10] us and that memory will come at some
[1:03:12] point to mind and then he'll begin to
[1:03:14] act on our behalf
[1:03:18] the Bible says in the Book of Psalms
[1:03:19] that many are the afflictions of the
[1:03:21] righteous and that word afflictions
[1:03:23] means hardships
[1:03:25] or perplexing circumstances it's not
[1:03:27] just sicknesses it could be anything
[1:03:30] are the afflictions of the righteous
[1:03:31] we're not talking about the world they
[1:03:32] have their troubles but the righteous
[1:03:34] have all these problems and there are
[1:03:36] many of them
[1:03:37] so so that shouldn't surprise us that we
[1:03:39] have many it's not because we're bad
[1:03:40] it's not because we're failures yes
[1:03:42] sometimes we bring trouble on ourselves
[1:03:45] but even if we aren't if we're doing the
[1:03:47] best we can the devil brings lots our
[1:03:49] way
[1:03:50] but we have a promise the Lord
[1:03:52] delivereth us out of them all
[1:03:55] there's not one circumstance there's not
[1:03:57] one trial that you will ever face that
[1:04:00] God will not bring you out of
[1:04:02] he will
[1:04:06] now there is something unique about the
[1:04:08] memory of God and the mind of God we
[1:04:09] said God's memory is perfect and all of
[1:04:12] that is not like ours but he has this
[1:04:14] other unique ability
[1:04:17] and that is God is capable and able to
[1:04:20] forget a memory
[1:04:24] the Bible speaks in Micah about the Sea
[1:04:26] of God's forgetfulness but I want to
[1:04:27] read this quote because brother Branham
[1:04:28] really states that well in the message
[1:04:30] Investments he said when your sins are
[1:04:33] confessed
[1:04:34] and your sins are dropped into the
[1:04:36] bleach of the blood of the son of God
[1:04:38] he said it remits sin so much
[1:04:41] it's put in the sea of God's
[1:04:43] forgetfulness notice this now
[1:04:45] it can never be remembered in his sight
[1:04:49] anymore
[1:04:50] we remember it that's the problem that's
[1:04:53] the problem with our memories we
[1:04:54] remember things that we should be
[1:04:55] forgetting
[1:04:56] and we forget the things we should be
[1:04:57] remembering
[1:04:59] but God's able to actually forget it
[1:05:01] completely it's gone and so that's why
[1:05:05] you have to be so careful you know when
[1:05:07] a brother and sister accuses another
[1:05:09] you know if somebody's put us in under
[1:05:11] the blood and it's truly been put under
[1:05:12] the blood and it's forgotten from God
[1:05:14] and you're accusing them what do you
[1:05:17] think God thinks about that
[1:05:18] he doesn't even know what you're
[1:05:20] speaking of you are falsely accusing
[1:05:22] your brother or your sister
[1:05:25] if you take that in the the real truth
[1:05:27] of it before God if it's been put under
[1:05:29] the blood
[1:05:31] it can never be remembered in his sight
[1:05:33] and he said then what does that make a
[1:05:35] man he said a son of God
[1:05:37] God he notices he said God never
[1:05:39] remembers you to be a sinner imagine we
[1:05:43] remember that though and that's what
[1:05:44] that's what a lot of our trouble is
[1:05:46] we remember those mistakes but God
[1:05:49] doesn't remember them if we confess them
[1:05:51] he said he doesn't remember you are as a
[1:05:54] sinner you are a son you are a daughter
[1:05:56] he said there's no more remembrance of
[1:05:58] sin at all none
[1:06:00] he puts it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:06:02] the bleach the sea of forgetfulness
[1:06:04] brother Brown said is Christ's blood
[1:06:06] that we shed for you and therefore he
[1:06:08] said then you and you and God are Father
[1:06:11] and Son by Jesus Christ Grace not by
[1:06:14] anything you've done but by his grace
[1:06:19] but you know we we think of those things
[1:06:21] and we hang on to those things and and
[1:06:23] we remember them and sometimes we
[1:06:24] remember other people's sins too as I
[1:06:27] just said
[1:06:28] sometimes we have trouble with that if
[1:06:30] we've been hurt sometimes we have
[1:06:32] trouble to forgive we were brother
[1:06:34] Timothy might remember that when we were
[1:06:36] in Israel we went to this glass Art
[1:06:37] Museum I remembered we went into this
[1:06:39] room
[1:06:40] real dark lit room and they had this
[1:06:42] sculpture there with these uh faces on
[1:06:45] it that kind of blood and it was just a
[1:06:47] gory looking thing and it was a memory
[1:06:50] of the Holocaust and the lady that was
[1:06:52] that was touring us there she said you
[1:06:55] know this here is so that we will never
[1:06:58] forget
[1:06:59] and that we will never forgive I
[1:07:02] remember all of us yeah you know the
[1:07:03] people in the room just gasped because
[1:07:05] that's not the way a Christian is but
[1:07:07] that was her attitude they were still
[1:07:09] harboring that from all of those years
[1:07:12] and it wouldn't be easy if it was you
[1:07:14] and your family maybe she had relatives
[1:07:17] you know that that died you know it's
[1:07:19] possible but she said it's here so we
[1:07:22] don't forget and we don't forgive
[1:07:25] but you have got to forgive
[1:07:28] you might not be able to forget that's
[1:07:30] just a limitation of these minds but
[1:07:32] you've got to forgive
[1:07:33] you've got to forgive
[1:07:36] so it's it's different you know God
[1:07:38] thinks differently in that respect but
[1:07:40] it's important to remember that so when
[1:07:42] we're approaching God if we put these
[1:07:44] things under the blood we we can tell
[1:07:46] the Devil he's a liar when he comes at
[1:07:47] us with these things
[1:07:49] because God doesn't know about them
[1:07:51] they're they're not on your record you
[1:07:53] say well you know is there going to
[1:07:55] brother Brandon said when you do wrong
[1:07:56] you know you're going to get a weapon
[1:07:58] for it but that's not your problem
[1:07:59] that's gone he'll do that and we all
[1:08:01] know that we do wrong things we're going
[1:08:04] to get a weapon for it but that's all it
[1:08:06] is
[1:08:06] God does that and then you keep going on
[1:08:08] brother Brad said you go on you confess
[1:08:10] that thing and you go on and you rejoice
[1:08:12] with a Hallelujah on your heart you
[1:08:15] don't have to live under condemnation
[1:08:16] you don't have to do that because you
[1:08:18] feel like you have to punish yourself
[1:08:20] you don't have to do that God takes care
[1:08:22] of whatever needs to be done you are
[1:08:25] part is just to put that thing by
[1:08:27] confession under the blood
[1:08:29] I want to talk about Rachel
[1:08:31] in the Bible another character who you
[1:08:34] know Jacob saw her at the well and he
[1:08:36] and he loved her and wanted to marry her
[1:08:38] and he served for seven years and then
[1:08:41] was tricked into taking Leah and then
[1:08:44] another seven years he served for Rachel
[1:08:46] well
[1:08:47] God noticed and it's in the it's in I'm
[1:08:49] just going to read a few uh selected
[1:08:51] verses in Genesis 29 and verse 31 that
[1:08:55] God noticed that Leah was the Bible says
[1:08:58] hated but really it's that Leah wasn't
[1:09:00] really loved by by Jacob and so the
[1:09:04] Bible says he opened Leah's womb because
[1:09:07] of that he openly his womb but Rachel
[1:09:10] was barren
[1:09:12] now if you would take it from the
[1:09:13] perspective of Rachel
[1:09:15] Rachel could not help that she was born
[1:09:18] more fair than Leah Rachel could not
[1:09:21] help that Jacob loved her more than he
[1:09:24] loved Leah wasn't her fault it was the
[1:09:26] way God made her
[1:09:28] and so it's like she's being punished
[1:09:30] and so she's she's Desiring to have
[1:09:34] children
[1:09:35] and uh you know uh
[1:09:38] uh well in fact neither wife was very
[1:09:40] happy because Leah I don't think Leah
[1:09:43] was too concerned about children as she
[1:09:44] was she wanted Jacob's love you can see
[1:09:47] that in the scripture she wanted Jacob's
[1:09:48] Lobster so she was having children
[1:09:50] thinking and in fact even in one of the
[1:09:53] verses it'll say after she had a child
[1:09:55] now he will love me and it was like that
[1:09:58] was the only reason she was having but
[1:09:59] Rachel more wanted the children so that
[1:10:01] neither wife was very happy
[1:10:04] and Rachel at one point tells Jacob you
[1:10:06] know give me children unless I die
[1:10:08] what could he do about it he wasn't the
[1:10:10] one that closed her womb
[1:10:12] but just I want to just go through
[1:10:13] quickly these of course from these
[1:10:16] children come the patriarch these are
[1:10:18] the Patriarchs
[1:10:20] so Leah has has four children one right
[1:10:25] after the other the first four
[1:10:26] Patriarchs
[1:10:28] and Rachel's still Baron
[1:10:31] and then as we as we go through we see
[1:10:33] Rachel has this idea well I can't have
[1:10:36] children I'm going to offer my maid and
[1:10:38] so she offers her maid Bill and to Jacob
[1:10:41] and he has a son by her which was Dan he
[1:10:44] was the fifth patriarch and then a
[1:10:45] second son napped to lie which was the
[1:10:47] sixth patriarch
[1:10:49] well Leah didn't want to be left out so
[1:10:51] she offers her maid because at this
[1:10:53] point Leah had stopped conceiving
[1:10:55] and so she offers her maid and they have
[1:10:58] two more children Zopa she has Gad and
[1:11:02] then Asher Sons seven and eight now
[1:11:04] we've got eight Patriarchs Rachel still
[1:11:06] hasn't had any children of her own then
[1:11:08] the Lord opens Leah's womb again
[1:11:10] and she Bears her fists on issachar the
[1:11:13] ninth patriarch she Bears a sixth son
[1:11:15] zebulun which became the tenth patriarch
[1:11:18] now we know there's only two more coming
[1:11:21] and this happened over a period of years
[1:11:23] so if you think about from the time that
[1:11:25] Jacob met Rachel it was 14 years before
[1:11:27] they even got married and depending on
[1:11:28] who you you read the scholars say it
[1:11:30] could have been almost that much time
[1:11:32] again
[1:11:33] before we come to Genesis 30 and 22
[1:11:36] because in all of this time I know she
[1:11:39] we see in the scripture where she was
[1:11:41] after Jacob you know but I believe that
[1:11:43] Rachel sought the Lord as well that God
[1:11:45] would open her womb because the Bible
[1:11:47] says in Genesis 30 and 22 it says and
[1:11:51] God remembered Rachel
[1:11:54] and God hearkened to her and opened her
[1:11:58] womb
[1:11:59] but it was years it was years that it
[1:12:02] took how many times would Rachel have
[1:12:04] asked God how many times has she had
[1:12:06] treated him to to open her womb and then
[1:12:09] all of a sudden God remembers her not
[1:12:13] that he had forgotten it's not that he
[1:12:14] didn't know that she was asking but it
[1:12:17] was now time to bring that thought
[1:12:19] forward he always intended to open her
[1:12:21] womb and now the time had come
[1:12:24] and she opens her womb and of course she
[1:12:25] has Joseph and then Benjamin dies in
[1:12:28] childbirth and those are the those are
[1:12:30] the 12 Patriarchs but you know you can
[1:12:32] look and say well why was she made to
[1:12:33] wait so long and other people you know
[1:12:36] we see in the scripture they they prayed
[1:12:38] and they got an instant answer
[1:12:40] that's not up to us
[1:12:42] the question I think about the parable
[1:12:44] of the man that hired the workers in the
[1:12:47] Book of Matthew and he hired some early
[1:12:50] in the morning and in the if you read it
[1:12:53] I don't want to take the time because I
[1:12:54] have a little bit to get through and
[1:12:55] everybody hires them in the morning and
[1:12:57] he tells them that he's going to give
[1:12:59] them a penny
[1:13:01] and so then after he hires them the
[1:13:04] Bible says the third hour and then you
[1:13:06] know he goes on the sixth hour and a
[1:13:08] different times during the day hired
[1:13:09] more and in that he said I will give you
[1:13:11] what's right he didn't say what he was
[1:13:13] paying them
[1:13:14] and he come up to the 11th hour and he
[1:13:17] hires someone he's hired some people at
[1:13:19] the 11th Hour
[1:13:20] comes to the end of the day and those
[1:13:22] workers who worked the shortest amount
[1:13:24] of time got paid first and they got paid
[1:13:26] a penny as well
[1:13:27] and of course the people that labored
[1:13:29] the whole day they didn't like that
[1:13:32] but you know he said am I not able to do
[1:13:34] with what I want am I not just
[1:13:37] and I want you to think about it you
[1:13:38] know we've been serving the lord I've
[1:13:39] been I was a boy when when the message
[1:13:41] came our way and so it's been you know
[1:13:44] 50 plus years that the message has been
[1:13:46] that we've been serving the lord in this
[1:13:48] message and
[1:13:50] but you know there's going to be people
[1:13:51] come in at the last hour like the thief
[1:13:52] on the cross
[1:13:54] thief on the cross lived his entire life
[1:13:56] in sin
[1:13:57] he gets on the cross
[1:13:59] and he's there and he recognizes and he
[1:14:03] says Lord remember me remember me he
[1:14:06] says
[1:14:07] and here he's in his dying moments
[1:14:09] but you know those ones that come in in
[1:14:11] the final hours of this age that we're
[1:14:13] in which I don't believe we're going to
[1:14:15] be here a whole lot longer they're going
[1:14:16] to get the same reward as us
[1:14:19] but you know I I don't feel bad about
[1:14:21] that
[1:14:22] I've got loved ones out there I'll be
[1:14:24] quite happy
[1:14:26] if they when they come in not if they
[1:14:28] come in but when they come in
[1:14:30] and that's how you have to look at it
[1:14:31] too when they come in
[1:14:34] so there will be some that come in and
[1:14:36] those Final hours gone will remember
[1:14:40] and we'll save those ones
[1:14:43] now Abraham we know that God gave a
[1:14:45] promise to Abraham
[1:14:46] that he would be the father of a great
[1:14:49] nation and that they would be a stranger
[1:14:51] in a land would serve them you know for
[1:14:53] 400 years and so on and we know that
[1:14:55] that that happened and then it comes
[1:14:59] down to the time closer to the time of
[1:15:01] their Deliverance
[1:15:03] and what happens there I want to go to
[1:15:05] Exodus 2.
[1:15:07] in Exodus 2
[1:15:09] what's very interesting is that you know
[1:15:10] the children of Israel went down into
[1:15:12] Egypt as guests
[1:15:13] and they were comfortable there
[1:15:15] and there was no pressure
[1:15:18] and when it comes time for them to be
[1:15:19] delivered God had to turn the heat up on
[1:15:21] them a little bit
[1:15:22] because they really were enjoying things
[1:15:24] too much
[1:15:26] and I want you to think about the time
[1:15:27] we're in now you know I fear sometimes
[1:15:30] that we might be a little bit too
[1:15:32] comfortable but we see what's going on
[1:15:34] in the world now I know for me and it's
[1:15:37] not just because I'm getting older but
[1:15:38] this world is not as nice a place as it
[1:15:41] used to be
[1:15:42] and and more and more year after year I
[1:15:45] feel myself
[1:15:46] Desiring to move on
[1:15:49] really there's there's a lot less that I
[1:15:52] enjoy about this life now
[1:15:54] because of the sin and because of the
[1:15:56] direction it's going
[1:15:58] and I think that that's intentional
[1:16:00] because the Bible says you know when you
[1:16:02] see these things become come to pass
[1:16:03] look up for your Redemption draws nigh
[1:16:05] he says that he is coming for those who
[1:16:08] are looking for him if we're not looking
[1:16:11] for him now I would be a little bit
[1:16:12] fearful that we might be left behind
[1:16:14] he's coming for them that were looking
[1:16:16] it says in Revelation even so Lord Jesus
[1:16:19] come
[1:16:21] when we are praying those kind of
[1:16:23] prayers then I think we're getting
[1:16:24] really close because that's what
[1:16:26] happened here Exodus 2 verse 23 it come
[1:16:29] to pass in the process of time that the
[1:16:31] king of Egypt died and the children of
[1:16:33] Israel Side by reason of the bondage and
[1:16:36] they cried
[1:16:37] and their Cry came up unto God by reason
[1:16:40] of the bondage and notice verse 24
[1:16:43] here's the trigger in this case and God
[1:16:47] heard their groaning and God remembered
[1:16:50] his Covenant with Abraham he hadn't
[1:16:53] forgot it
[1:16:54] but now they were in the condition to
[1:16:56] receive it and their groaning was that
[1:16:57] trigger okay it's time to bring that
[1:17:00] thought forward
[1:17:02] he remembered his Covenant and he looked
[1:17:04] upon the children of Israel it says in
[1:17:05] verse 25 and had respect unto them and
[1:17:08] from there we know that he begins to
[1:17:10] call Moses and and and and and bring him
[1:17:13] there for the Deliverance
[1:17:18] I want to look at Hannah
[1:17:20] another one in the Bible who had a
[1:17:22] problem where she was not able to Bear
[1:17:24] children
[1:17:27] and she was you know just like Rachel
[1:17:30] desirous that the Lord would Minister to
[1:17:32] that and and but she had
[1:17:34] you know her husband had another wife
[1:17:36] penina who
[1:17:38] who was able to have children and so she
[1:17:40] rubbed it in a lot
[1:17:42] to her and and uh and in fact the Bible
[1:17:45] refers to her as an adversary in many
[1:17:48] ways you know the devil loves to rub
[1:17:49] things in when things are not going the
[1:17:51] way you want to or you're trying to to
[1:17:54] move on with he loves to to rub it in
[1:17:56] when when you don't seem to be making
[1:17:58] progress
[1:17:59] that's just he loves to do that and so
[1:18:02] she keeps praying she was just so so
[1:18:04] upset but she finally goes down there to
[1:18:07] Shiloh and and before the priest and she
[1:18:10] begins to to speak to him about that and
[1:18:12] and there the Lord at that time began to
[1:18:16] Quicken a seed of faith in her heart and
[1:18:19] the Bible says and just saving time
[1:18:21] again that she went away from there with
[1:18:23] that Faith with that 25 cents as it were
[1:18:26] and and her countenance was no more sad
[1:18:29] you can read it in the scriptures there
[1:18:31] and when she comes back from there
[1:18:35] the Bible says and just for reference
[1:18:37] sake it's in first Samuel 1 and verse
[1:18:40] 19.
[1:18:42] it says they rose up early in the
[1:18:43] morning early sorry in the morning early
[1:18:45] and worshiped before the Lord and
[1:18:47] returned came to their house to Rhema
[1:18:49] and Elkin knew Hannah his wife and the
[1:18:53] Lord remembered her
[1:18:55] Lord remembered her
[1:18:57] and and and and and the and the next
[1:19:00] verse actually says when we come to
[1:19:01] passive when the time was come about
[1:19:03] after Hannah had conceived she bear a
[1:19:05] son called his name Samuel Samuel saying
[1:19:08] because I have asked him of the Lord
[1:19:11] so God was responding to her prayer it
[1:19:15] was her prayer he was responding to he
[1:19:18] was remembering her
[1:19:20] he was remembering her
[1:19:22] now I want to go back to the original
[1:19:23] scripture that we read
[1:19:25] here and we just read a portion of it
[1:19:27] but I want to go back and look at this
[1:19:29] this story and this is when God comes
[1:19:32] down and visits Abraham with the two
[1:19:35] angels that we're going to go to Sodom
[1:19:37] and so I want to pick this up and look
[1:19:40] at it in just a little bit of detail in
[1:19:41] Genesis Chapter 18 beginning at the 16th
[1:19:44] verse
[1:19:46] they're there and they have a have some
[1:19:48] time of Fellowship together
[1:19:51] and then it says in the 16th verse that
[1:19:53] the man rose up from thence and looked
[1:19:54] towards Sodom and Abraham went with him
[1:19:56] to bring them on the way and of course
[1:19:59] they're getting ready now to go to Sodom
[1:20:01] and we know why they're going to Sodom
[1:20:02] but Abraham doesn't know why they're
[1:20:04] going to Sodom not just yet
[1:20:06] and notice verse 17 and the Lord said
[1:20:09] shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[1:20:12] which I do
[1:20:14] seeing that Abraham shall become shall
[1:20:17] surely become a great and mighty nation
[1:20:19] and all the nations of the Earth shall
[1:20:20] be blessed in him
[1:20:22] and notice this part verse 19 4 I know
[1:20:25] him
[1:20:27] for I know him
[1:20:29] see God knew that when Abraham became
[1:20:32] aware of what was going on
[1:20:34] that it was going to cause Abraham to do
[1:20:36] something that actually made a huge
[1:20:38] difference in the outcome
[1:20:41] he said for I know him that he will
[1:20:43] command his children in his household
[1:20:45] after him that they shall keep the way
[1:20:46] of the Lord to do justice and judgment
[1:20:48] and that the Lord may bring upon Abraham
[1:20:50] that which he has spoken of him
[1:20:54] so God knew the reaction so he tells
[1:20:56] Abraham what's going on that they're
[1:20:58] going to in verse 20 he said because of
[1:21:01] the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great
[1:21:02] and because their sin is very Grievous
[1:21:04] and Abraham knew this he said I'm going
[1:21:07] to go down and see whether they have
[1:21:09] done all together according to the Cry
[1:21:11] of it which is coming to me and if not I
[1:21:14] will know
[1:21:15] and so then the man the two angels
[1:21:17] turned their faces from thence and went
[1:21:19] towards Sodom and Abraham stood yet
[1:21:22] before the Lord
[1:21:24] now it sinks in Abraham realizes what is
[1:21:28] coming he knows that when they go down
[1:21:29] there the condition of Sodom that God is
[1:21:32] not going to let it let it get by
[1:21:35] and so he's thinking about that and so
[1:21:38] his response his very next response in
[1:21:41] the 23rd verse Abraham draws near to the
[1:21:44] Lord he says wilt thou also destroy the
[1:21:46] righteous with the wicked
[1:21:49] now you might think why would Abraham
[1:21:51] ask that question why would he ask
[1:21:53] because they're they're all Wicked
[1:21:55] he asked because he had family there
[1:21:59] he had a nephew there
[1:22:02] and and you know lot is referred to as a
[1:22:06] righteous man but brother Branham said
[1:22:07] he was really lukewarm and half backslid
[1:22:13] but he was a believer of some of sorts
[1:22:15] but he wasn't really where he should be
[1:22:17] or he wouldn't have been down there in
[1:22:18] the first place
[1:22:20] and so Abraham begins to ask these
[1:22:22] questions you know would you destroy for
[1:22:25] 50 and for 40 and so on he goes down to
[1:22:27] 10.
[1:22:28] and he said well if there's 10 righteous
[1:22:30] I won't destroy it and then
[1:22:32] and then they go their separate ways
[1:22:34] Abraham goes to his place
[1:22:36] and the Lord goes and he goes home
[1:22:39] and you know Abraham was probably
[1:22:41] thinking well is there even ten
[1:22:43] righteous there and he you know he's
[1:22:45] doing the math you know he got law and
[1:22:49] his wife you got the two daughters maybe
[1:22:51] maybe their husbands so you're up to
[1:22:53] about six but
[1:22:55] and it doesn't mention about any
[1:22:57] children if they had children
[1:22:58] but he's he's a little short
[1:23:02] of 10.
[1:23:03] and so Abraham probably went to bed that
[1:23:05] night you know kind of wondering how is
[1:23:07] this going to turn out how is this going
[1:23:09] to play out
[1:23:11] well we flipped the scene over to to
[1:23:14] Sodom in Genesis 19
[1:23:17] and verse 12 the Angels come to lot's
[1:23:20] house it's interesting why did they go
[1:23:21] to lot's house we'll find out
[1:23:24] here soon it says in verse 12 the man
[1:23:27] said to lot has that many here besides
[1:23:30] son-in-law and sons and daughters and
[1:23:32] whatsoever thou Hassan the city bring
[1:23:34] them out of this place for we will
[1:23:36] destroy this place because the Cry of
[1:23:38] them is waxing great before the face of
[1:23:40] the Lord and the Lord has sent us to
[1:23:42] destroy it well that's pretty strong
[1:23:44] words I should have been enough for lot
[1:23:46] and it did stir him up the Bible says in
[1:23:49] verse 14 he goes out and speaks to his
[1:23:51] sons-in-laws
[1:23:52] which married his daughters and said you
[1:23:54] know get you out of this place for the
[1:23:56] Lord will destroy the city but he seemed
[1:23:58] as one that mocked to his sons he
[1:24:00] couldn't even convince them
[1:24:03] the only ones he could convince were his
[1:24:04] own flesh and blood
[1:24:06] so it was just the four
[1:24:08] but the interesting thing is when the
[1:24:10] morning comes in this 15th verse the
[1:24:13] morning comes Lots not really ready to
[1:24:15] go
[1:24:17] the Bible says when the morning arose
[1:24:18] the Angels hastened law pressed him
[1:24:21] urged him saying you need to take your
[1:24:23] wife and your daughters which are here
[1:24:25] unless thou be consumed in the iniquity
[1:24:27] of the city but lot didn't rush to leave
[1:24:29] verse 16 while he lingered the Bible
[1:24:31] said that men laid hold on his hands
[1:24:34] they weren't really going to go without
[1:24:37] being forced
[1:24:40] he said the men laid hold on his hand
[1:24:41] one upon his wife and upon the hand of
[1:24:43] his two daughters notice what it says
[1:24:45] the Lord being merciful unto him and
[1:24:49] they brought him forth and set him
[1:24:50] without the city
[1:24:53] so when you look at this
[1:24:56] launch salvation as it were from the
[1:24:59] destruction of Sodom
[1:25:01] really hadn't didn't have much to do
[1:25:02] with lot
[1:25:04] it was the mercy of God but why was it
[1:25:08] that way
[1:25:10] why was it that way well let's look at
[1:25:12] the verse 27.
[1:25:15] Abraham gets up in the morning probably
[1:25:17] didn't sleep a whole lot thinking about
[1:25:19] what might take place the Bible says
[1:25:21] Abraham gets up early in the morning to
[1:25:23] the place where he stood before the Lord
[1:25:26] and he looks over at Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:25:28] and toward the land of the plane and
[1:25:30] behold the smoke of the country went up
[1:25:32] as a smoke of a furnace
[1:25:34] and so he sees the destruction I imagine
[1:25:36] he's wondering what happened what
[1:25:39] happened to law what happened to his
[1:25:41] family but notice the 29th verse
[1:25:43] he came to pass when God destroyed the
[1:25:45] cities of the plain that God remembered
[1:25:48] Abraham
[1:25:50] it wasn't Lottie was remembering it was
[1:25:52] Abraham
[1:25:54] and sent lot out lot didn't even want to
[1:25:57] go out but it was Abraham
[1:26:00] it was Abraham's request you say I don't
[1:26:02] know if I believe that well let me tell
[1:26:03] you what brother Brown said in hearing
[1:26:05] recognizing and acting on the word of
[1:26:06] God
[1:26:08] brother Branham said
[1:26:09] speaking about lot
[1:26:11] he said he'd have never come out
[1:26:14] he had he'd have never been called out
[1:26:16] called out not even called out
[1:26:18] if it had not been for the mercy
[1:26:21] of Abraham
[1:26:23] the mercy of Abraham
[1:26:26] can I find 50 men when he asked those
[1:26:28] questions it was the mercy of Abraham
[1:26:30] that lot was called out now think about
[1:26:32] your loved ones that you're praying for
[1:26:36] you say what what influence do I have
[1:26:38] I'm going to read you something towards
[1:26:39] the end about that but your prayers
[1:26:41] don't think that they have no effect you
[1:26:44] might look at them out there and say
[1:26:46] well they don't seem like they're coming
[1:26:47] any it looks like they're going further
[1:26:49] away
[1:26:50] it's going to be your one of these days
[1:26:51] it's going to be your mercy one of these
[1:26:54] days God is going to remember you he's
[1:26:56] going to remember your prayers for your
[1:26:58] loved ones
[1:26:59] and he's going to bring them out
[1:27:10] and you know prayer is so powerful we
[1:27:12] underestimate it that even the prayers
[1:27:15] of those that have passed on
[1:27:18] you know it's God's answers though
[1:27:20] sometimes after they're gone
[1:27:24] brother Branham was having a baptismal
[1:27:26] service for his son Billy Paul and his
[1:27:28] nephew Melvin 1950 he was he was getting
[1:27:31] ready to baptize him and he's he relates
[1:27:33] this statement
[1:27:36] he said Heavenly Father 1900 years since
[1:27:39] the scripture has been written and your
[1:27:40] promise is still moving on
[1:27:42] and he said now Lord hear these young
[1:27:43] people there were two young ladies on
[1:27:45] his right they've accepted you as their
[1:27:47] savior they believe the gospel story to
[1:27:49] my left Lord is my little nephew Melvin
[1:27:52] and my own boy
[1:27:54] he said oh God if it's possible this
[1:27:56] morning that the two mothers could be
[1:27:58] called to look over the banister and to
[1:28:00] look down and see their boys now
[1:28:02] he said how happy I am Lord to know that
[1:28:06] you answer prayer
[1:28:08] he said that poor little mother Ruth
[1:28:10] that would have been Melvin's mother he
[1:28:12] said that poor little mother Ruth she's
[1:28:13] gone on years ago
[1:28:15] but her prayer is answered now
[1:28:18] your prayers answered now
[1:28:20] she prayed that he would love you and
[1:28:22] serve you and he's making this stand
[1:28:23] this morning
[1:28:25] to these others their mothers maybe has
[1:28:27] gone on Lord we don't know
[1:28:29] thou does but whatever he said answer
[1:28:32] prayer
[1:28:34] there's another time brother Brown gives
[1:28:36] an altar call it's actually it was in
[1:28:38] Shreveport the message love in 1956 and
[1:28:41] you're probably familiar with this quote
[1:28:42] but this this piece of the quote was
[1:28:43] always stood out to me
[1:28:45] the young people had come to the Altar
[1:28:47] and brother Branham made the statement
[1:28:48] he said I feel God that everyone here at
[1:28:51] this altar has been accepted in your
[1:28:52] sight
[1:28:53] that's pretty rare thing
[1:28:55] you know I've been at youth camps at
[1:28:57] different times people come to the Altar
[1:28:58] and a lot of them go through the same
[1:29:00] and put on the you know go through the
[1:29:01] same motions but a lot a lot of them
[1:29:03] walk away the same as they came
[1:29:05] unfortunately
[1:29:07] but brother Brown said I believe every
[1:29:08] one of these at the altar has been
[1:29:10] accepted he said their names are on the
[1:29:12] book angels are singing bells of Heaven
[1:29:13] Are Ringing Satan's defeated and the and
[1:29:16] they're moving back down the corridors
[1:29:17] of hell with their black flags draping
[1:29:20] but I want you to notice this he said
[1:29:21] the angels have gone to heaven to
[1:29:23] Rejoice around the throne where mothers
[1:29:25] and fathers are waiting to hear the
[1:29:28] message coming back from this meeting
[1:29:30] he said they've got boys and girls
[1:29:32] sitting here where loved ones has gone
[1:29:34] on and they're waiting I believe those
[1:29:36] loved ones that have gone on and also
[1:29:37] prayed for them
[1:29:39] I've got two older brothers that don't
[1:29:40] serve the Lord my mom and dad prayed for
[1:29:42] them absolutely all the time
[1:29:44] and they're both gone
[1:29:46] but I believe one of these days God's
[1:29:48] going to remember
[1:29:49] those prayers
[1:29:52] you know there's a scripture and it's
[1:29:54] it's been quoted often in Jeremiah where
[1:29:56] it talks about God is going to come and
[1:29:59] perform his good word and that he knows
[1:30:01] the thoughts that he thinks of us
[1:30:03] thoughts of peace to give us an expected
[1:30:06] end
[1:30:08] you know the the believer we we know
[1:30:11] what's coming we know what our end is we
[1:30:14] know where things are going we may not
[1:30:16] know tomorrow and specifically in our
[1:30:18] life but we know where this is going to
[1:30:19] end up
[1:30:21] and God's got good plans and good things
[1:30:23] in store for his people
[1:30:25] but you know the world doesn't have that
[1:30:27] the sinner doesn't have that but we have
[1:30:29] that confidence that God has an
[1:30:32] objective and everything that God brings
[1:30:34] our way it's with purpose
[1:30:37] nothing happens just accidental nothing
[1:30:39] just happens randomly
[1:30:41] might seem that way to you
[1:30:43] and it might seem surprising as well
[1:30:45] sometimes things happen it just shocks
[1:30:47] you sometimes almost paralyzes you when
[1:30:49] when you encounter some trials and tests
[1:30:51] but nothing surprises God he knew it was
[1:30:54] coming
[1:30:55] he allowed it to be he may have even
[1:30:56] ordained it to be
[1:30:59] but God is is going to bring everything
[1:31:02] the Bible says all things work together
[1:31:03] for good to them that love the Lord very
[1:31:06] simple scripture we quoted all the time
[1:31:07] but sometimes it's hard to believe that
[1:31:09] when they're in the middle of the
[1:31:10] trouble
[1:31:11] it's hard to believe there's going to be
[1:31:12] a good outcome how can good come of this
[1:31:15] but if you're a Believer when you get on
[1:31:17] the other side of that trial you can
[1:31:18] look back and
[1:31:19] and see how God brought you through
[1:31:22] and the purpose sometimes maybe you
[1:31:24] won't know all of all the ins and outs
[1:31:26] of it but God will bring you through
[1:31:27] it's not all Valley you know the god of
[1:31:30] the mountain is God in the valley too
[1:31:35] so he has plans he's going to give us an
[1:31:38] expected end you know I read one time
[1:31:40] Charles Spurgeon said blessed be God it
[1:31:42] is an expected end he said the ungodly
[1:31:45] people can only look forward to a
[1:31:47] dreaded end
[1:31:48] an end of your foolish mirth an end of
[1:31:50] your carelessness and end of your
[1:31:52] boasting he said you fear your end but
[1:31:54] God will give his people an expected end
[1:31:58] suppose he said that end should be the
[1:31:59] coming of Christ or how we long for it
[1:32:04] he said brother and the Saints are
[1:32:05] prepared before they go
[1:32:07] our Lord does not pluck his fruit on
[1:32:09] wisely
[1:32:11] foolish State people he said May tear
[1:32:13] the green apples from the tree with a
[1:32:15] pull and a ranch and Bruise them as they
[1:32:17] throw them into the basket but our Lord
[1:32:18] values his fruit and he waits until it
[1:32:21] is quite right and he gathers it
[1:32:23] sometimes we wonder why our loved one's
[1:32:24] different things but God knows he has a
[1:32:27] purpose he has a time for everything he
[1:32:28] doesn't make any mistakes
[1:32:33] when he puts forth his hand and he said
[1:32:35] the fruit bows down to it imparts from
[1:32:37] the bow without a strain
[1:32:39] when the believer comes to die will not
[1:32:41] be to an end when which he feared but to
[1:32:43] an end which he expected
[1:32:48] now at the very end of things when the
[1:32:51] we go to the Book of Revelations when
[1:32:52] things are wrapping up there's two
[1:32:53] things that God is going to remember
[1:32:55] since we're speaking about God's memory
[1:32:58] in Revelation 18 it talks about how that
[1:33:01] God will remember the iniquities and the
[1:33:04] sins of the unrepentant sinner speaks of
[1:33:07] that in Revelation 18 and 4 and 5 but he
[1:33:10] also will remember the prayers of the
[1:33:11] righteous in Revelation 5 and 8. it
[1:33:13] talks about how that when when he took
[1:33:16] the book The Four beasts and the Four
[1:33:18] and Twenty Elders fell down and it
[1:33:19] talked about they had Harps and golden
[1:33:21] vials full of odors which were the
[1:33:23] prayers of the Saints so some of your
[1:33:25] prayers you know they're they're used
[1:33:27] now and they're going to accomplish
[1:33:28] things some of those prayers are going
[1:33:29] to be poured out one day
[1:33:32] over there
[1:33:35] now I was reading one when I was looking
[1:33:37] at this message in the Book of Malachi
[1:33:39] and there's a reference in there to
[1:33:41] something called The Book of remembrance
[1:33:44] we know there's a book of life and all
[1:33:46] these things that write your life story
[1:33:48] and The Sinner and it has a book to has
[1:33:51] things that track what happens in their
[1:33:53] life but there's this it was interesting
[1:33:54] the way that it reads in Malachi 3 and
[1:33:57] so I just wanted to to mention this
[1:33:59] Malachi 3 verse 16.
[1:34:03] so then they that fear the lord spake
[1:34:06] often one to another which is a good
[1:34:09] thing for a believer
[1:34:10] to do to Fellowship but notice what it
[1:34:13] says the Lord hearkened and heard it so
[1:34:16] the Lord pays attention
[1:34:17] to our conversations
[1:34:19] to the things that we do he said look
[1:34:21] they that fear the lord speak often one
[1:34:23] to another the Lord hearkened and heard
[1:34:25] it and a book of remembrance was written
[1:34:27] before him for them that feared the Lord
[1:34:30] so this is very specific to these groups
[1:34:32] this group of people that fear the lord
[1:34:34] and that thought upon his name
[1:34:37] so the contents of this book
[1:34:39] are things that God took note of in our
[1:34:42] lives the things that were important
[1:34:45] that were memorable
[1:34:47] of those that feared the Lord and verse
[1:34:50] 17 referring to these people of whom I
[1:34:53] trust all of us are apart
[1:34:55] he said and they shall be mine
[1:34:57] saith the Lord of hosts in that day when
[1:34:59] I make up my jewels and I will spare
[1:35:01] them as a man spareth his own son that
[1:35:04] serveth him
[1:35:06] God's Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know
[1:35:09] he watches me he's looking at us and
[1:35:12] mindful of us
[1:35:16] and so
[1:35:17] when we look back in our lives we see
[1:35:19] the flaws and we see all of those things
[1:35:22] but God as I said earlier looks at us
[1:35:24] differently than we look at ourselves
[1:35:26] brother Brown said the things that you
[1:35:28] do the words that you say and how you
[1:35:29] treat your neighbor and what you do
[1:35:31] about Christ will be an everlasting
[1:35:33] Memorial
[1:35:34] you know we have the opportunity as
[1:35:36] Christians that God can because he can
[1:35:39] forget the sins that we make you know he
[1:35:42] can edit our record
[1:35:43] you know like you do when you're typing
[1:35:45] up something you know you can get that
[1:35:47] thing just perfect well God's wanting to
[1:35:49] do that with each one of us
[1:35:51] yes we make mistakes every day but God
[1:35:53] just kind of takes care of that
[1:35:55] so that when the record is done it's all
[1:35:57] good things
[1:35:59] and a real good way to look at that
[1:36:02] is to compare the Old Testament in the
[1:36:04] New Testament when you look at Hebrews
[1:36:06] 11 you read Hebrews 11 it's a summary of
[1:36:10] Of The Heroes of Faith
[1:36:11] and you know those those men and women
[1:36:13] that are referenced because there's
[1:36:14] women reference there too in those in
[1:36:16] that scripture you know they had
[1:36:19] mistakes and made mistakes and if you go
[1:36:21] to the Old Testament which didn't leave
[1:36:23] anything out you can read about Abraham
[1:36:26] and Sarah for example you can see things
[1:36:28] with Abraham you see Sarah you know we
[1:36:30] often criticize Sarah oh she she didn't
[1:36:32] believe how much doubt she had
[1:36:34] but you know the record in Hebrews of
[1:36:36] Sarah doesn't mention that
[1:36:39] Hebrews 11 11 you know it's a memorable
[1:36:42] actually even a memorable scripture
[1:36:44] because we know uh you know we we
[1:36:46] celebrate you call it Veterans Day here
[1:36:48] but on November 11th the 11th day the
[1:36:50] 11th month the 11th Hour of the day we
[1:36:53] call it Remembrance Day at home
[1:36:55] well on the the 11th verse of the 11th
[1:36:58] chapter of Hebrews talks about Sarah
[1:37:01] and I want to read that scripture
[1:37:02] because this is her this is the summary
[1:37:05] this is the memory this is what's
[1:37:07] memorable about Sarah in the New
[1:37:09] Testament through faith also Sarah
[1:37:12] faith
[1:37:14] herself through faith also Sarah herself
[1:37:17] received strength to conceive seed
[1:37:21] and was delivered of a child when she
[1:37:23] was past age why because she judged him
[1:37:26] faithful who had promised we know
[1:37:28] Abraham was faithful when we talk about
[1:37:30] Abraham's Faith but with Sarah we often
[1:37:32] go back to the Old Testament we often
[1:37:34] point to the mistake
[1:37:36] but doesn't mention the mistake here
[1:37:39] because Sarah did have to come to a
[1:37:41] place where she believed just like
[1:37:43] Abraham for her body to be changed it
[1:37:46] wasn't enough for Abraham to believe she
[1:37:47] had to believe
[1:37:48] and she come to that place finally might
[1:37:50] have took her a little bit longer than
[1:37:52] him but she got there and that's what
[1:37:55] God remembers that's what was important
[1:37:57] enough that it was written of her here
[1:37:59] in the scripture
[1:38:01] and so if we can look at if we can I
[1:38:03] mean that's a good example
[1:38:04] we look at our lives we can see those
[1:38:06] times when we weren't very faithful when
[1:38:08] we've had you know made mistakes and
[1:38:10] said things that were not very good
[1:38:13] but if you put those things under the
[1:38:14] blood
[1:38:15] they're gone
[1:38:16] they're gone from the record and then
[1:38:18] what's left are those good things the
[1:38:20] times you did reach out in faith the
[1:38:21] times you did stand
[1:38:23] those are the things that God will
[1:38:25] remember of you
[1:38:28] brother Brown preached the message and
[1:38:30] I'm going to close here soon in just a
[1:38:32] few moments
[1:38:34] with this thought
[1:38:36] he preached a message called Mother's
[1:38:38] Day in 1959 he was 50 years old at the
[1:38:40] time
[1:38:41] you know and by that time he had lost a
[1:38:43] number of his loved ones and in that
[1:38:45] message he was reminiscing about what it
[1:38:47] would be like when he got over to the
[1:38:49] other side and he began to meet some of
[1:38:52] those ones and he he related in that
[1:38:54] message he said the first one probably
[1:38:55] he would see would be his baby Sharon
[1:38:58] and he said you know she won't be
[1:39:00] shaking with meningitis when I see her
[1:39:02] and then he thought about his wife hope
[1:39:05] he said she won't have those bony hands
[1:39:07] and the sunken cheeks which is the way
[1:39:09] he remembered her when she left then he
[1:39:11] then he mentioned Edward and Charles
[1:39:14] he said Charles won't be dragging his
[1:39:16] leg his dad his brother Howard who had
[1:39:19] got right with the Lord just a few days
[1:39:21] before he left he was just reflecting on
[1:39:23] these and then he made the statement
[1:39:24] after that he said we'll come brother
[1:39:26] Seward and brother Frank broy brother
[1:39:28] George the ark always said the
[1:39:30] resurrection means a lot to me
[1:39:33] he had a lot of a lot of people that had
[1:39:35] gone on and and as we get older we have
[1:39:37] those things too I got my parents and
[1:39:39] different ones that have gone on soon
[1:39:41] there'll be more over there maybe than
[1:39:43] here in many ways
[1:39:44] you know but he said the resurrection
[1:39:46] means a lot to me I'm anticipating on
[1:39:47] that great crowning hour he said as the
[1:39:50] light begins to spread he said we'll
[1:39:53] know
[1:39:54] as we are known
[1:39:55] and we'll understand and we'll remember
[1:39:57] our acquaintances the ones that's been
[1:39:59] here been there
[1:40:01] and I want you to catch this here and
[1:40:03] you may have heard this before but this
[1:40:05] has always been really striking to me
[1:40:07] it's always been really encouraging to
[1:40:09] me brother Branham said they'll he said
[1:40:12] he said many
[1:40:13] many he said there will be many there
[1:40:17] that we didn't even think would be there
[1:40:21] many there think about that can you I
[1:40:24] can think of people
[1:40:26] I can think of some of my loved ones
[1:40:27] right now that if the Lord was to come
[1:40:28] tonight I would think I don't know
[1:40:30] in my flesh
[1:40:32] he said when we get over there there'll
[1:40:34] be many there that we didn't even think
[1:40:37] would be there
[1:40:40] but I want you to here's the thing why
[1:40:43] will they be there I want you to notice
[1:40:44] what he said he said for I know it's at
[1:40:46] that time I believe that the bread that
[1:40:48] we have cast upon the human Troubled
[1:40:50] Waters will return to us upon that day
[1:40:53] why it was your effort it was my effort
[1:40:56] what we have sown the seeds that we have
[1:40:58] sown he said when we see the effects of
[1:41:00] Our Testimony
[1:41:02] on people that we didn't understand
[1:41:03] their action toward it
[1:41:05] how many times have we tried to witness
[1:41:07] or we tried to you know shed a light
[1:41:10] somewhere and it just seemed like it
[1:41:11] wasn't accomplishing anything
[1:41:13] but it was but it was
[1:41:16] we didn't understand why they were
[1:41:18] acting that he said they'll probably be
[1:41:19] there what a day that will be and here's
[1:41:22] what it goes on he said in the seeds
[1:41:23] that we sowed
[1:41:25] not even thinking what they would do we
[1:41:28] just sold the seeds he said
[1:41:29] but here they are
[1:41:31] the seeds that we sowed and who are
[1:41:34] those seeds he said they brought forth
[1:41:36] precious fruits those seeds that we sow
[1:41:38] those seeds that you have sown
[1:41:40] he said they brought forth precious
[1:41:42] fruits and we will see them on that day
[1:41:44] the Wayward loved ones and relatives
[1:41:48] and we all have them we all have those
[1:41:50] Wayward loved ones and relatives that
[1:41:52] we've been trying to sow seeds with and
[1:41:54] sometimes we don't see seems like it's
[1:41:56] not doing anything but don't stop sowing
[1:41:59] the seeds
[1:42:00] because God will remember don't stop
[1:42:03] praying for them because God will
[1:42:05] remember one of these days it may not be
[1:42:08] until we cross over that we see the
[1:42:10] realization of some of those
[1:42:12] but that doesn't mean we should stop
[1:42:14] God will do it God will remember
[1:42:18] he will remember you
[1:42:20] he will remember your prayers
[1:42:23] he knows you

[1:42:45] to that he will not bring you through

[1:47:38] today I met with Brother Carmen
[1:47:41] for lunch and you mind if I use this
[1:47:43] right here maybe
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:49] I met with Brother Carmen for lunch
[1:47:52] today and
[1:47:54] I was eating lunch and he began to
[1:47:56] express some things upon his heart
[1:47:59] how the
[1:48:00] he's truly believed that God was still
[1:48:03] the discerner
[1:48:04] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:48:07] I did mention to him that I've been
[1:48:09] ministering on that scripture for
[1:48:10] several times now and
[1:48:13] and how he also spoke of how he was
[1:48:15] looking for God to speak directly to a
[1:48:18] situation
[1:48:19] I say he did
[1:48:21] God remembered
[1:48:24] you know brother Carmen if you remember
[1:48:26] on that trip to Israel
[1:48:29] I believe it was our last day in Israel
[1:48:32] are there right about the last day
[1:48:34] we got up early that morning to go into
[1:48:36] Jerusalem or what we thought
[1:48:39] and before we knew it
[1:48:41] the brother George Martin who's actually
[1:48:44] passed on now but
[1:48:46] he come over the speaker or maybe
[1:48:49] there's Israeli God one of them said
[1:48:50] today I believe it was the Israeli God
[1:48:52] said I have a little surprise for you
[1:48:54] today said something that we wasn't
[1:48:57] planned to do but just wanted to throw
[1:48:59] this in with you we'll take you to a
[1:49:01] place I'd like I think you alike and and
[1:49:04] so we wandered through the different
[1:49:06] roads didn't have a clue where he was
[1:49:08] going and he said we're going to want to
[1:49:10] go to Shiloh
[1:49:11] and uh you know normally we'd had
[1:49:14] moments to prepare ourselves as we know
[1:49:17] the next day where we was going so the
[1:49:19] night before I would like to get my
[1:49:21] Bible or we'd look through notes and
[1:49:22] things and kind of familiar familiarize
[1:49:25] ourselves with the different places we
[1:49:26] were going to see all that happened
[1:49:28] there and things
[1:49:30] so it kind of a sprung on us and before
[1:49:32] we knew it
[1:49:33] were taken up to a real nice place and
[1:49:36] and uh little building that was up on
[1:49:39] the hill and we sat down in that hill
[1:49:41] and that little building on top of that
[1:49:43] hill and looking out over the landscape
[1:49:45] just rocks and bearing Wilderness looked
[1:49:48] like
[1:49:49] and they begin to play a scene before
[1:49:51] our eyes
[1:49:53] before we knew it we was looking we
[1:49:55] didn't know at the moment but when that
[1:49:57] scene started playing the screen would
[1:49:59] turn from the windows remember how that
[1:50:01] was so neat how that did that it would
[1:50:03] turn into a screen to show a movie
[1:50:06] and it would begin to play out Hannah's
[1:50:08] life
[1:50:10] and we're getting to realize we was
[1:50:12] actually right looking down where the
[1:50:14] Tabernacle was for some years before
[1:50:16] they moved to Jerusalem
[1:50:18] so he watched that and I can remember as
[1:50:20] my dad and my mom and me and sister Ruth
[1:50:23] was sitting right there on the front row
[1:50:25] and
[1:50:26] tears streaming down our eyes because
[1:50:28] there was a burden in our heart
[1:50:31] there's a burden for Esther for her to
[1:50:33] have a child
[1:50:35] and we got LED right down to the place
[1:50:37] where Hannah prayed
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:39] and uh
[1:50:41] and so we were
[1:50:44] looking at the scriptures and things
[1:50:46] that were hanging around and begin to
[1:50:47] realize some very same scriptures that
[1:50:50] was hanging there we'd read just a few
[1:50:52] days before another story but
[1:50:56] before we knew it we was right there at
[1:50:58] the place Hannah prayed
[1:51:01] and so we had prayer and I remember the
[1:51:05] guide as he would leave their tears he
[1:51:07] was wiping Israeli God he was wiping
[1:51:09] tears out of his eyes and he said wow I
[1:51:11] didn't expect that to be so emotional
[1:51:14] you know and
[1:51:15] but my dad would lead us all of us I
[1:51:18] don't know there was about 11 or so
[1:51:19] Brothers Minister Brothers quite a few
[1:51:21] of us standing there praying and dad was
[1:51:24] leading in prayer about the different
[1:51:26] needs in the body and the different
[1:51:28] Barren women in a Barren Church
[1:51:32] and I remember he called different names
[1:51:35] out and
[1:51:36] and one of them was Sister Candace I
[1:51:38] believe
[1:51:39] and even Bethany and things of her
[1:51:42] wanting a child another child and of
[1:51:44] course Esther
[1:51:46] and here we are again tonight
[1:51:48] Esther still looking for that child
[1:51:52] and God brings us all the way back
[1:51:54] around to the same place with a man that
[1:51:57] was there at the same place with us
[1:51:59] speaking to us tonight God remembers
[1:52:04] I'm here to say I still got my 25 cents
[1:52:12] Esther God's remembered

[1:52:47] word to pass I don't know how he's going
[1:52:49] to do it or when he's going to do it

[2:12:50] a couple of testimonies you know
[2:12:53] we said the word is a discerner of the
[2:12:55] thoughts and and you and you can receive
[2:12:57] what you need right in the when the
[2:12:58] preaching's going forth but you know
[2:13:00] this is singing and the worship of the
[2:13:02] Lord God can do a lot too
[2:13:04] I just want to relate a couple
[2:13:05] testimonies I was I have a brother he's
[2:13:08] a real witness for the Lord and if you
[2:13:09] ever get to meet him he'll always relate
[2:13:11] one testimony and that was that he had
[2:13:14] suffered with back trouble for I think
[2:13:16] two years and he just could never get
[2:13:18] relief from it and he was sitting in a
[2:13:20] service and they were singing the song
[2:13:21] Jehovah Jireh my provider
[2:13:24] it was just a song Nobody laid hands on
[2:13:26] him and as they were singing that the
[2:13:28] Lord began to Quicken the faith to his
[2:13:30] heart and when it come to the part
[2:13:31] Jehovah Rapha You're My Healer
[2:13:33] God came and instantly healed his back
[2:13:37] [Applause]
[2:13:38] [Music]
[2:13:46] God can do that tonight too
[2:13:50] I was in I was in Quebec and I was
[2:13:52] preaching a service and there was a
[2:13:54] brother so Quebec is a province and that
[2:13:56] neighbors hours and I traveled there to
[2:13:58] preach and a brother from the Far West
[2:13:59] drove for a couple of weeks and he was
[2:14:01] coming to visit and so I'd never met him
[2:14:03] before and he was coming there we just
[2:14:05] we come to the same place and I was
[2:14:07] preaching and but when he come he had
[2:14:09] mentioned to me before the service that
[2:14:10] he something had happened to his arm I
[2:14:12] think it was his right Army it's like he
[2:14:14] lost the use of it he had no strength he
[2:14:16] couldn't lift it he had to use one arm
[2:14:18] to lift the other
[2:14:19] and he had been that way for for days
[2:14:21] many days
[2:14:23] after finished preaching we just started
[2:14:25] worshiping just like this right here
[2:14:27] and the Lord just told him simply in his
[2:14:29] seat to lift his hand
[2:14:32] and all he did was obey that
[2:14:34] and his hand went up and he never had a
[2:14:36] problem ever again with it
[2:14:38] and so it's in these moments too that
[2:14:41] when God quickens That Word of Faith you
[2:14:42] need to grab a hold of your of your 25
[2:14:45] cents as he talks about and don't ever
[2:14:47] let it go
