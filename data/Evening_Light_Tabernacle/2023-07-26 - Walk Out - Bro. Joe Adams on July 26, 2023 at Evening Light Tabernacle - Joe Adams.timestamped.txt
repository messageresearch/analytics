[39:49] Lord

[40:29] we need you to lead us we need you to
[40:32] guide us we humble ourselves before you
[40:34] father and we just invite you to have
[40:36] the preeminence tonight
[40:38] Lord we love you and we just Commit This
[40:40] service now to you in Jesus name
[40:42] if you have your Bibles tonight
[40:47] you turn to acts 12 we're gonna
[40:50] I was studying earlier this week looking
[40:53] at part six of the series that I've been
[40:55] under
[40:55] taken here and just never really felt
[40:58] the leadership to go that direction the
[41:01] Lord kind of changed my thought on
[41:02] Saturday and
[41:04] so brother Timothy kind of touched on
[41:06] this
[41:08] phase here of Peter on Sunday service so
[41:11] you that were there you understood it
[41:12] you understand where we're going but
[41:14] Lord changed my thoughts so I just ask
[41:16] one thing tonight let's be honest with
[41:18] ourselves
[41:19] so there'll be things that may be spoken
[41:21] that may be very personal and I'm
[41:23] speaking to this from a very personal
[41:24] standpoint tonight things that I've had
[41:27] to battle things that I've overcome
[41:28] things that I've faced and I know that I
[41:30] can guarantee you you face the same
[41:32] things so don't think well I'm just
[41:34] picking you out and I'm just using you
[41:35] an example and I'm just preaching at you
[41:37] tonight that's not the case because if
[41:39] that's the case if that's my heart then
[41:40] I don't need to be standing behind here
[41:42] tonight but I believe God laid this on
[41:44] my heart to help all of us and I'm
[41:46] asking that you'll just be be honest
[41:48] with yourself and I want to speak to you
[41:51] on a message that I want to call walk
[41:53] out
[41:53] and we look here and we find here in
[41:56] Acts 12 and verse 3 and because he saw
[41:59] that it pleased the Jews he proceeded
[42:01] further to take Peter also then were the
[42:04] days of unleavened bread and when he had
[42:06] apprehended him he put him in prison and
[42:09] he delivered him to four quadrians of
[42:12] soldiers to keep him intending after eat
[42:14] after Easter to bring him forth to the
[42:17] people Peter therefore was kept in
[42:20] prison
[42:21] but prayer was made without ceasing of
[42:24] the church unto God for him and when
[42:26] Herod would have brought him forth the
[42:28] same night Peter was sleeping Between
[42:30] Two Soldiers bound with two chains and
[42:33] the keepers before the door kept to
[42:35] prison
[42:36] and behold the angel of the Lord came
[42:39] upon him and a light shine in a prison
[42:40] and he smoked Peter on the side and he
[42:43] raised him up saying arise up quickly
[42:46] and his chains fell off of his hands and
[42:49] the angel said unto him gird thyself and
[42:51] bind on thy sandals and so he did and he
[42:54] saith unto him cast I garment about thee
[42:57] and follow me God bless you I'll let you
[43:00] have your seats tonight
[43:01] so we recognize just here and we're
[43:04] going to kind of jump off we'll come
[43:05] back to this passage of scripture here
[43:07] in just a little bit but I want you to
[43:09] recognize tonight
[43:11] where Peter was at
[43:13] because all of us at some point in our
[43:15] in our life in our Christian Journey we
[43:17] find ourselves in the same place
[43:19] now Peter had been to Pentecost Peter
[43:22] has received the Holy Ghost Peter was a
[43:24] spokesman for the church and yet because
[43:26] Peter was all those things the devil
[43:28] knew exactly what he was going to try to
[43:31] do and after his Pentecostal experience
[43:33] after him becoming the spokesman after
[43:36] him having that Holy Ghost experience
[43:37] yet the enemy came in through Peter into
[43:40] a prison
[43:42] and I want you to know just because you
[43:43] have the Holy Ghost tonight just because
[43:45] you're a Son of God and a daughter of
[43:47] God it doesn't mean that the devil
[43:49] doesn't come and attack us and try to
[43:51] shut you into a prison
[43:53] because that's his tactic that's his
[43:55] desire that's what his effort that's
[43:56] what he's trying to do and we look in
[43:58] Isaiah 59 the Bible tells us behold the
[44:01] hand of the Lord is not shortened that
[44:04] it cannot save neither is his ear heavy
[44:08] that he cannot hear
[44:10] and in verse 14 of the same passage and
[44:13] judgment is turned away backward and
[44:15] Justice standeth far off for a truth has
[44:17] fallen in the street and Equity cannot
[44:19] enter yea truths faileth and he that
[44:21] departed from Evil maketh himself a prey
[44:23] and the Lord saw it and it displeased
[44:26] him that there was no one there was no
[44:28] one there was no judgment excuse me and
[44:30] he saw that there was no man and he
[44:32] wondered that there was no intercessor
[44:34] therefore his arms brought salvation
[44:36] unto him and his righteousness and it
[44:38] sustained him for he put on a Vengeance
[44:41] as a breastplate a helmet of salvation
[44:44] upon his head and he put on the garments
[44:46] of Vengeance for her clothing and he
[44:48] clad with zealed as a cloak and
[44:50] according to their deeds according as he
[44:52] will repay Fury to your adversaries
[44:55] recompense to his enemies to the islands
[44:57] he will repay recompense so shall they
[45:00] fear the name of the Lord from the West
[45:01] and his glory from the rising of the son
[45:04] so when the enemy shall come in like a
[45:06] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[45:09] up a standard
[45:11] now many of us here and I ask you be
[45:14] honest with yourself tonight many of us
[45:16] here at some point in our Christian
[45:18] journey and our walk with the Lord we
[45:21] have felt the overwhelming flood of the
[45:23] enemy
[45:25] we have felt his constant attacks his
[45:27] bombardments we have encountered his
[45:29] accusations we've endured his sickness
[45:31] and all his evil schemes and sometimes
[45:34] we've even stumbled at some of his
[45:36] tactics we even entertain his lies
[45:42] we've even entertained his lives but you
[45:45] know the best way to win a battle
[45:47] now I've done a lot of World War II
[45:49] reading I've done a lot of reading on
[45:50] the Native American Indians but I've
[45:53] realized the number one way to win a
[45:54] battle is to surround your enemy on all
[45:56] sides
[45:58] you you take them from the front you
[46:00] attack their Left Flank you attack their
[46:01] right flank you Ambush them from the
[46:03] rear so they have no retreat and that's
[46:05] exactly what the enemy tries to do to us
[46:07] as Believers he attacks your mind he
[46:10] attacks your body he attacks your family
[46:12] he attacks your children he attacks your
[46:14] marriage he'll attack your church he'll
[46:16] attack everything that you stand for to
[46:19] get you to to surrender
[46:21] because his focus and his goal is to
[46:24] shut you into a prison
[46:27] I want you to understand that that's his
[46:28] Focus that's his goal nobody here
[46:30] tonight is against you
[46:33] not one brother not one sister not one
[46:35] mom not one dad not one believer is
[46:38] against any other person here tonight
[46:40] those present those on the stream nobody
[46:43] is here against you the only one that's
[46:45] against you tonight is your adversary
[46:47] the enemy and the bibles are declared he
[46:49] would be an adversary to your adversary
[46:51] he will pour out vengeance upon your
[46:53] adversary tonight recognize what we're
[46:56] fighting recognize who we're fighting
[46:58] and quit fighting one another and let's
[47:00] turn our efforts on the enemy tonight
[47:03] because his focus and his goal is to
[47:06] shut you into a prison
[47:08] we find the Bible tells us for when the
[47:10] enemy shall come in and we know that
[47:12] there is a there's a comma there when he
[47:14] comes in like a flood comma but I want
[47:16] us to read it like the way as a Believer
[47:18] we should read it when the enemy comes
[47:20] in comma like a flood
[47:23] think about that like a flood the power
[47:25] God has poured out upon your adversary
[47:28] because your sons and daughters of God
[47:29] see the Lord would not allow your enemy
[47:32] to get away with attacking his children
[47:34] he will repay Fury to the adversary
[47:37] recompense to the enemy so like a flood
[47:40] he said he's going to lift up a standard
[47:41] now you know the thing about water water
[47:43] can change its state it can be a solid
[47:45] it could be a gas and it can be a liquid
[47:47] pretty powerful source
[47:50] and you yet you find have you ever been
[47:52] to the Grand Canyon that wasn't created
[47:54] by a sandstorm that was created by water
[47:57] and it may have started as a trickle but
[47:59] that trickle picked up steam and that
[48:01] water came in and cut deep Canyons into
[48:04] some rocky soil and what am I telling
[48:06] you tonight the power of the Holy Ghost
[48:08] has enough power and authority behind it
[48:11] tonight that it can cut deep Canyons
[48:12] into your life and it can go down into
[48:14] the D the things that you have
[48:16] suppressed the things that you had put
[48:18] down you put out of your thought and it
[48:20] can go down to the depths of your soul
[48:22] and begin to discern and withstand and
[48:25] pull up things so that you can get
[48:27] deliverance and it can wash all those
[48:29] sediments out of your life and make you
[48:30] a son and make you a daughter of God
[48:33] the Bible would tell us in Hebrews that
[48:35] the word of God is sharper it's quick
[48:38] and it's powerful and it's sharper than
[48:40] any two-edged sword
[48:42] the word of God is still a discerner
[48:46] but yet we are so human humanistic that
[48:49] we will walk out of church and say
[48:51] somebody told them you're exactly right
[48:53] that's somebody being the power of the
[48:55] Holy Ghost he told me on Saturday night
[48:57] to preach this message so if you get
[48:59] offended tonight take it up with my God
[49:04] but we look here and I want to share
[49:05] some things from my heart tonight
[49:08] so we find that there's things that we
[49:10] put out of our mind things that maybe
[49:12] things that maybe you were you hurt when
[49:15] you was a child
[49:16] and it influenced your thinking it
[49:19] influenced your behavior it influenced
[49:21] your attitude and it influence your
[49:23] actions and some of you tonight are
[49:25] still trying to overcome those
[49:27] influences
[49:30] come on I ask you to be honest with
[49:31] yourself
[49:33] let me tell you I didn't have the
[49:34] greatest upbringing okay I've shared my
[49:36] testimony with some of you it wasn't the
[49:38] most flowery bed of ease but I'm
[49:40] overcoming still yet today things that I
[49:43] endured as a child things that I endured
[49:45] and you know what and when you're a
[49:46] child you don't have a mature mind so
[49:48] you perceive things that are not as
[49:50] though they may actually have been
[49:53] so you br you you perceive them with an
[49:55] immature mind and it may not be as bad
[49:58] and devastating as you perceive it but
[50:01] yet because it's so influenced you in
[50:04] that area and so it moved in your life
[50:06] in that area now there's a wall up
[50:09] you had built yourself a wall that you
[50:12] can't get over
[50:15] maybe somebody said something hurt you
[50:18] as a child
[50:20] better yet maybe somebody said some
[50:21] about somebody else and now your
[50:24] perception of that person is Tainted
[50:27] you'll never see them Through The Eyes
[50:29] Of God with that in your mind you will
[50:33] only see them with the taintness of that
[50:36] negativity that they put on it
[50:38] and you know how hard it is as an
[50:41] individual to overcome the negative
[50:43] thought maybe you had never met somebody
[50:45] and somebody said something
[50:48] and that what they said so impressed
[50:51] upon you you never give that individual
[50:53] the benefit of the doubt
[50:56] you put a wall and say you're not coming
[50:58] into my life you're not coming into my
[51:00] family look church I've been guilty
[51:03] we're all guilty I ask you to be honest
[51:05] be honest with yourself because if we're
[51:08] going to get out of prison we got to be
[51:09] honest
[51:10] if we're planning to get free tonight we
[51:12] got to be honest brother Aaron did a
[51:14] wonderful job last week speaking on one
[51:16] mind one Accord that's what it's going
[51:18] to take tonight and we heard a fabulous
[51:20] message again on Sunday about the change
[51:22] the light the change I'm entertaining
[51:24] he's able to change your situation
[51:25] tonight if you'll be honest with
[51:28] yourself and not be under false pretense
[51:30] that I don't need this kind of preacher
[51:35] so we find now listen to what brother
[51:37] Brown says here notice notice now he
[51:40] says something
[51:42] may have impacted you as a child it
[51:44] could be laying there for years
[51:46] listen to this quote here and this is
[51:48] whatever he saith unto you do it he says
[51:50] you have a nervous trouble sitting there
[51:52] don't you lady only you have spells of
[51:55] nervousness that makes you feel like
[51:56] you're going to lose your mind
[51:59] and you thought she was all alone in
[52:01] that
[52:02] he says now Satan sometimes tells you
[52:05] that you cross the line
[52:07] and nobody ever heard that tonight have
[52:09] you
[52:11] oh you practically you've been nervous
[52:13] all your life notice what he says you
[52:15] had a scary sort that when you were a
[52:18] child just a little girl
[52:20] and now here he goes here is you're
[52:23] trying to do something make beds or
[52:25] something and you get so nervous that
[52:28] you have to sit down but you've been
[52:30] praying you've been trying to be healed
[52:31] he goes when this lady was being prayed
[52:34] for just now you felt something strange
[52:36] come over you if that is right raise
[52:38] your hand if that's true I've told you
[52:40] the truth I've never seen you you're he
[52:42] goes you're just a lady that's walked up
[52:44] there and sat down and I tell you in the
[52:46] name of Jesus you are healed go home
[52:48] your well notice it happened to her when
[52:51] she was a child
[52:53] maybe a negative thought maybe a scare
[52:55] maybe something so impacted her in her
[52:59] youth but yet now as a young Christian
[53:01] or as a Christian mother or a Christian
[53:03] woman or a Christian father now you're
[53:06] fighting against something that is so
[53:08] deep
[53:09] and so far removed from your conscience
[53:11] but the word of God is still a discerner
[53:14] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[53:16] and he's able to come down with the
[53:19] anointing of the Holy Spirit through a
[53:21] five-fold gifted Ministry and cut those
[53:23] things right out of your life so that
[53:25] you can rise up and do exactly what the
[53:27] prophet of God said go home you're
[53:30] healed in the name of Jesus
[53:34] maybe somebody hurt you
[53:36] and I know none of y'all here tonight's
[53:39] been hurt
[53:40] but let's just be honest with ourselves
[53:42] there's not one of you here tonight that
[53:45] has not been hurt
[53:46] by the Maybe by your neighbor and I'm
[53:49] not talking about the one that lives at
[53:50] the physical address that you live at
[53:52] I'm talking about the neighbor that's
[53:53] sitting on the Pew with you
[53:55] it's part of humanity church it's part
[53:58] of overcoming it's part of recognizing
[54:00] the enemy and all of his tactics and
[54:03] recognizing that your brother is not
[54:04] your enemy but the devil will try to use
[54:07] your brother and maybe use a curse word
[54:11] maybe use a ugly look
[54:16] or maybe
[54:17] they just completely ignored you all
[54:19] together
[54:21] and now you're offended
[54:25] see some of these things happen to us
[54:27] and we have to be careful
[54:30] see but the word has the ability to
[54:33] reach down into your life
[54:35] on a Wednesday night
[54:37] and begin to cut
[54:39] and begin to perform surgery
[54:42] he's got a steady hand he knows exactly
[54:44] where he's going
[54:46] see the word of God can diagnose the
[54:48] condition way better than any surgeon
[54:51] and notice he can go down and he can cut
[54:53] those things and he he exposes your
[54:56] human weaknesses things that you didn't
[54:58] know laid there because they were so far
[55:01] removed from your conscience but they
[55:03] hindered you from moving with God they
[55:06] hindered you from growing they hindered
[55:08] you
[55:09] from really being born again or taking
[55:12] that next step from walking with a God
[55:15] and giving up your past
[55:17] things that you didn't know laid there
[55:19] they're there but he's still a discerner
[55:22] of the thoughts and in the intents of
[55:24] the heart notice now brother Brandon
[55:26] would tell us this and I know I preached
[55:28] this several times before
[55:30] but we recognize the greatest battle
[55:32] that's ever been fought is the Battle of
[55:34] your gray matter
[55:38] you know you could have great big
[55:39] muscles brother Daryl
[55:42] but that little bit of great matter man
[55:43] it could really it could throw your
[55:45] world your life for a loop
[55:47] so the greatest battle that you'll ever
[55:49] face you may never face an enemy and
[55:52] physically be in confrontation but you
[55:54] fight a battle in your mind on a daily
[55:57] basis and notice he said there has to be
[56:00] a place selected a mutual ground no
[56:03] man's land that they fight here at this
[56:05] place he said they just don't fight over
[56:07] here and and one down here and one run
[56:09] over there he says that there's a
[56:11] Battlefront where they meet and they
[56:13] test their powers so Satan is trying to
[56:16] test his powers against yours
[56:19] he's trying to test his powers his
[56:22] reasoning his doubt his unbelief against
[56:25] your faith and what you claim to be the
[56:27] mess of the hour
[56:28] he's going to attack your faith oh you
[56:31] believe God's in a prophet and he's
[56:32] going to attack the message and make you
[56:35] stand or or run away from it because it
[56:38] comes under attack or maybe it be well
[56:40] you know if you've prayed for healing
[56:43] and he attacks your body he may strike
[56:45] you with cancer and you prayed and you
[56:47] prayed and you prayed and you're on
[56:48] chemo you lost your hair and you lost
[56:50] this and you lost that and yet Satan is
[56:53] there to see whether you truly believe
[56:54] that I am the Lord thy God that heals
[56:57] all thy diseases so he's testing his
[57:01] powers against your powers but I want
[57:03] you to know tonight when you receive the
[57:05] Holy Ghost that's the power that he
[57:07] can't overcome that's a test and he
[57:09] can't defeat and I want to encourage you
[57:11] tonight don't give up just recognize
[57:14] seek that tonight more than anything I
[57:17] need the Holy Ghost though because when
[57:19] he comes with his test then you've got
[57:21] the tester to be able to withstand every
[57:23] accusation and trial of the enemy
[57:26] he said when this battle started on
[57:28] Earth there had to be a mutual meeting
[57:29] place there had to be a place selected
[57:31] for the battle to begin for the battle
[57:33] to rage that the Battleground begins in
[57:35] the human mind
[57:37] why because decisions are made from that
[57:41] gray matter
[57:44] so we realize tonight whether you're
[57:46] young and whether you're old
[57:48] Satan is attacking your mind
[57:51] young people you face a completely
[57:53] different battle
[57:55] in the mind than what I will or some of
[57:57] the older grandparents will
[57:59] see the battle is different when I I may
[58:02] look at something I may have a battle
[58:03] and you may look at me like man would
[58:05] you please just get over yourself
[58:07] but see it's my battle
[58:10] it's not yours it's not something you
[58:11] contend with and I may look at your
[58:13] about I'm like man come on pull yourself
[58:15] out of your bootstraps and get with it
[58:17] but that's your battle I don't
[58:20] understand it I'm not in your battle but
[58:23] I know that we still all face the same
[58:25] adversary and we have our own battle and
[58:28] if we could just step back for a minute
[58:30] and just have enough compassion for our
[58:32] human brothers and sisters and recognize
[58:34] we all everyone here tonight are facing
[58:37] a battle
[58:38] and if you're here and I said well I'm
[58:40] not having a battle of my mind brother
[58:41] Joe I'm a good Christian I'm a righteous
[58:43] man and I'm just you're just a liar
[58:45] oh you're just a big fat lie I'm here to
[58:47] tell you I'll call you out tonight
[58:48] because we all face it because that's
[58:50] the Battleground but I'm here to tell
[58:52] you God doesn't want to leave you there
[58:54] he don't want to leave you fighting
[58:56] alone he has come to you on a Wednesday
[58:58] night to declare that he can take you
[59:00] from where you are in the battle of the
[59:02] mind and place you where he desires you
[59:04] to be
[59:07] so our battles are different
[59:10] we struggle different things different
[59:12] ways
[59:13] but yet we struggle and the Bible says
[59:17] encourage one another all the more
[59:21] man if we really put that into action
[59:23] what about elt
[59:25] I'm not saying we're not a lovely church
[59:27] I'm not saying we're not a church that
[59:28] encourages us but I'm just saying if we
[59:30] would really put that in action instead
[59:32] of turning your finger on them and and
[59:33] told them about them and talking about
[59:35] this when well so and so did this and so
[59:37] and so did that and I didn't like the
[59:39] way the pastor did this and I didn't
[59:40] like the way brother Joe did that and I
[59:42] didn't like the way the song leader did
[59:43] this and I didn't like the way the
[59:45] singers did this and I didn't I didn't I
[59:46] did not if we would just encourage one
[59:48] another how much further down the road
[59:51] would we be
[59:53] how much more sincere would we be as a
[59:56] local church body
[1:00:02] see Satan
[1:00:04] he knows that you're going to make
[1:00:06] decisions
[1:00:07] there's not one person hitting here
[1:00:08] tonight that hasn't made a decision
[1:00:10] making a decision or going to make a
[1:00:12] decision because we make decisions but
[1:00:14] he knows if he can influence
[1:00:17] your decisions
[1:00:19] by the Battle of your mind the decision
[1:00:21] you make will also bring forth the
[1:00:24] actions and the words from your tongue
[1:00:26] the Bible tells us from the abundance of
[1:00:29] the heart speaketh the mouth
[1:00:31] so the things you're dwelling on things
[1:00:34] you're thinking on those things that
[1:00:35] begin going to be lived out in your life
[1:00:37] and confessed out of your mouth
[1:00:41] so Satan tries to influence your
[1:00:43] decision-making
[1:00:44] by putting thoughts in your head
[1:00:48] some of you even here tonight have
[1:00:49] contemplate leaving this church because
[1:00:51] you've been hurt
[1:00:54] contemplate I'm gonna move I'm gonna go
[1:00:56] to another state I'm gonna go to brother
[1:00:57] Donnie's I'm gonna go to brother Roz I'm
[1:00:58] gonna die I'm gonna hear and it's just
[1:01:00] got to be better no it ain't gonna be
[1:01:02] better because you're gonna show up
[1:01:04] and you're going to show up with your
[1:01:05] own human failures your own human
[1:01:07] weaknesses your own human desires your
[1:01:09] own complexes when you show up it's
[1:01:11] downhill from there what am I telling
[1:01:13] you work through the thing today
[1:01:16] we got to begin to work through issues
[1:01:18] and work through situations and let God
[1:01:20] get the glory when Satan tries to come
[1:01:22] in and separate God is here he's not a
[1:01:25] separator in that regard he wants to
[1:01:27] bind us closer together when you
[1:01:29] recognize the devil and every one of his
[1:01:31] attacks then you can recognize who's
[1:01:33] trying to weasel his way into the midst
[1:01:35] and split the church and divide the
[1:01:37] people and kill the fellowship and stop
[1:01:40] the influence from a Godly Ministry
[1:01:46] and yet God is sin and other people
[1:01:49] to move in here
[1:01:52] because they're blessed by the ministry
[1:01:54] they're blessed by the church they're
[1:01:57] blessed by the fellowship
[1:01:59] and all you can see is the negative all
[1:02:01] you can see is the faults all you can
[1:02:04] see is what the devil wants you to see
[1:02:06] take your stinking eyeglasses off
[1:02:08] tonight and look through the eyeglasses
[1:02:10] of the Holy Spirit
[1:02:12] and see what God sees
[1:02:14] I've been preaching to you about the
[1:02:16] seed of God God sees sons and daughters
[1:02:19] that are maturing in the faith sons and
[1:02:22] daughters that are displaying his life
[1:02:24] sons and daughters that is in his own
[1:02:26] image quit using or quit allowing
[1:02:29] yourself to be used by the enemy
[1:02:36] the Bible tells us
[1:02:38] that we're to cast down imaginations
[1:02:41] now I ain't know I know nobody here
[1:02:42] tonight had any kind of crazy
[1:02:43] imaginations have you
[1:02:46] man we are good at Building Bridges
[1:02:48] everybody here tonight is an engineer
[1:02:52] brother Mark not by yourself
[1:02:54] man we can we can fabricate some stories
[1:02:57] in our mind
[1:02:58] man we can build this and build that and
[1:03:01] that brother I remember one time years
[1:03:03] ago brother Andrew I'm sorry but I'm
[1:03:05] gonna use you tonight many years ago
[1:03:06] before he got married before he got to
[1:03:08] Holy Ghost I took him to Iowa with me I
[1:03:10] was doing up there preaching a lot and I
[1:03:11] took him on a trip and on the way back
[1:03:13] he was brother Joe I didn't even think
[1:03:14] you like me
[1:03:17] like why would you think that because
[1:03:18] the devil got in his mind and he thought
[1:03:21] well because you looked at me at one
[1:03:23] time on a Sunday I think it was you
[1:03:25] looked at me funny and I thought well he
[1:03:26] don't like me
[1:03:29] I never said it I said man if I didn't
[1:03:32] like you you wouldn't be in this car
[1:03:33] with me right now
[1:03:35] on a 13-hour trip there 13-hour trip
[1:03:38] back spending all night in a hotel room
[1:03:40] if I didn't like you you wouldn't be
[1:03:41] here but that's how the enemy works
[1:03:45] he plays on your weakness he he battles
[1:03:48] your mind
[1:03:51] but the Bible says we have to cast down
[1:03:54] those things you got a part to play in
[1:03:56] this cast those things down Satan trying
[1:03:58] to tell you he'll never be healed cast
[1:04:00] it down trying to tell you you'll never
[1:04:02] make it cast it down trying to tell you
[1:04:04] you can't have your children cast those
[1:04:06] things down
[1:04:07] to rise up and recognize Who You Are
[1:04:11] so he brought the program tells now the
[1:04:13] mind accepts the life which is the word
[1:04:15] of God and there it brings life just
[1:04:18] your thought doesn't do it it's not mind
[1:04:19] over matter he says but what is your
[1:04:21] mind controlled by it's controlled by
[1:04:23] your spirit and the spirit catches the
[1:04:26] word of God and that's the thing that
[1:04:28] has life in it and it brings life into
[1:04:30] you
[1:04:32] so here tonight the spirit of God is
[1:04:34] here moving in the service and you're a
[1:04:36] spirit that's control your mind is
[1:04:38] controlled by your spirit and if your
[1:04:40] spirit can reach up and understand what
[1:04:43] I'm preaching tonight that is not my
[1:04:45] voice but it's his voice trying to tell
[1:04:47] you you can be free tonight and grab
[1:04:49] hold of that and it'll bring freedom
[1:04:51] inside of it it'll break the shackles
[1:04:53] off of your life and you can walk out of
[1:04:55] this place free tonight no longer bound
[1:04:57] no longer in prison no longer in
[1:05:00] shackles but you've got to realize who's
[1:05:03] trying to speak to you and receive it
[1:05:05] and let it come inside of you
[1:05:10] you have to doubt your doubts
[1:05:12] he says it must be accepted into mind
[1:05:15] then believe with the heart then the
[1:05:17] word of God becomes a reality
[1:05:21] then every sense of the soul and body is
[1:05:24] just scoured out by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:27] so you got to believe
[1:05:28] that it's for you
[1:05:30] you got to believe that Deliverance is
[1:05:32] for you you got to believe that
[1:05:33] salvation is for you you got to believe
[1:05:35] that the Holy Ghost is for you you got
[1:05:37] to believe that healing is for you
[1:05:39] you've got to believe that every person
[1:05:41] in this church is here for you
[1:05:45] I go a lot of places
[1:05:49] I'm gonna tell you I've not found a
[1:05:50] better Church
[1:05:51] and when I say church I'm talking about
[1:05:53] the character of the people
[1:05:57] that's not all brother Tim
[1:05:59] is that all brother Timothy
[1:06:01] but it's the body
[1:06:03] we are if you just understood
[1:06:06] what is sitting next to you tonight
[1:06:10] as I told y'all last week
[1:06:13] what a great people we have here
[1:06:16] but you know all we see sometimes is
[1:06:18] their faults
[1:06:20] we see their failures because we see
[1:06:22] their faces and they didn't make a
[1:06:24] pretty face at me
[1:06:25] and we get caught up in all the church
[1:06:27] politics
[1:06:29] who said she said this one said
[1:06:32] we get all worried about all that
[1:06:34] frivolous stuff that doesn't matter
[1:06:36] nothing
[1:06:39] doesn't matter
[1:06:43] and what is he trying to do trying to
[1:06:45] influence your decisions
[1:06:48] trying to influence your thought process
[1:06:51] program says this and now if he can get
[1:06:53] you to stop for a minute
[1:06:57] if he can get you to stop for a minute
[1:06:58] he can make you reason it out notice
[1:07:02] he can make you think with your mind but
[1:07:05] God doesn't use man's head
[1:07:08] God chose to Heart
[1:07:10] so here Satan uses the head
[1:07:13] and the Bible tells us in Proverbs 23 7
[1:07:16] for as he thinketh in his heart so he
[1:07:18] said God chose your heart so when Satan
[1:07:20] attacks your mind to imprison you to
[1:07:22] pass failures
[1:07:23] to imprison you to regret to imprison
[1:07:26] you to doubts and unbelief he will make
[1:07:28] you think that you're lost because you
[1:07:30] make a mistake that you never had the
[1:07:32] Holy Ghost because you stumbled and
[1:07:33] failed he makes you think that you've
[1:07:35] crossed a line and there's no hope for
[1:07:37] you because of things that you did in
[1:07:38] your past
[1:07:43] he tries to get you to reason the word
[1:07:46] to make you think it's not for me
[1:07:49] now no I'm just preaching to myself but
[1:07:51] let me preach to myself tonight if
[1:07:53] that's okay
[1:07:55] see Satan tries to get you the to say oh
[1:07:57] well healing everybody's getting healed
[1:07:59] but it's not for me and the Holy Ghost
[1:08:00] is for everybody else and I see people
[1:08:02] running and Shout like we did last
[1:08:03] Wednesday but it's not for me I see
[1:08:05] people you know they believe this
[1:08:07] message but I'm still on the fence
[1:08:08] whether it's not for me
[1:08:11] he wants you to think everything
[1:08:12] negative
[1:08:16] makes you feel that you're not accepted
[1:08:19] in the local body
[1:08:22] that you're not accepted
[1:08:24] nobody likes you
[1:08:27] oh my
[1:08:29] so Satan's attack is to what disbelieve
[1:08:32] God's word
[1:08:34] so he wants you to disbelieve the word
[1:08:38] so what does he do he attacks the
[1:08:39] ministry
[1:08:42] he attacks to officials of the church
[1:08:45] he attacks the church
[1:08:48] and you walk through those doors with
[1:08:49] those devil glasses on and all you see
[1:08:51] is failure and faults
[1:08:54] all you see is negativity
[1:08:57] oh
[1:09:00] I ask you to be honest with yourself
[1:09:03] you walk through that door and he crowns
[1:09:04] you with a critical spirit all that
[1:09:06] running and shenanigans up in the house
[1:09:09] of God we need to get some order
[1:09:13] see that's how the devil talks so I'm
[1:09:15] asking you to recognize who's doing the
[1:09:18] talking
[1:09:21] recognize that that's not of God
[1:09:25] so notice what he says here now so we
[1:09:27] found out the the Battle Ground is the
[1:09:31] mind
[1:09:32] that little bit of gray matter houses a
[1:09:35] whole lot of power
[1:09:37] think it with your mind it's a powerful
[1:09:39] organ it's a powerful weapon because
[1:09:41] notice man with a powerful mind
[1:09:45] has created automobiles created uh
[1:09:48] created airplanes and and spaceships and
[1:09:51] they've landed on the moon
[1:09:54] man with that gray matter created an
[1:09:56] iPad that you can FaceTime your brother
[1:09:58] or sister or crossover sees a family
[1:10:00] member so the mind is a powerful weapon
[1:10:04] just think about if you can turn your
[1:10:07] weapon against your enemy
[1:10:09] versus allowing him access all the time
[1:10:14] see the thoughts that pass through your
[1:10:16] mind they are responsible for a lot of
[1:10:18] things that happen if not everything
[1:10:20] that happens in your life
[1:10:21] the things that you're dwelling on even
[1:10:23] here tonight as I'm preaching
[1:10:27] notice see not all thoughts are equal
[1:10:28] your predominant thoughts the ones that
[1:10:30] repeat often they will influence your
[1:10:32] behavior
[1:10:33] they will influence your attitude they
[1:10:35] will affect your actions and your
[1:10:37] reactions and they will shape your
[1:10:39] reality
[1:10:40] so when you come into the house of God
[1:10:42] on a Wednesday night and your attitude
[1:10:44] ain't in check and your actions ain't in
[1:10:46] check because your mind ain't in shape
[1:10:48] because you've been dwelling on the
[1:10:49] negative and you're expecting to get
[1:10:51] something from the house of God
[1:10:55] I'm asking you to be honest with
[1:10:57] yourself tonight
[1:10:59] and just recognize who it is that you're
[1:11:02] at war with
[1:11:04] brother Roger you're not at war with any
[1:11:06] of us
[1:11:07] brother Mark we're not at war with you
[1:11:09] but the devil is at war with all of us
[1:11:12] he's got one purpose one goal to destroy
[1:11:16] destroy destroy destroy destroy destroy
[1:11:20] family destroy marriages destroy
[1:11:22] children destroy homes to destroy this
[1:11:25] church and to destroy this ministry
[1:11:28] and if we could recognize who it is
[1:11:31] that's attacking
[1:11:33] maybe we'll pull our own guns up
[1:11:36] pull them back for a little bit and
[1:11:37] encourage one another
[1:11:40] notice what the Bible says here in
[1:11:42] Philippians 4 8 finally brother
[1:11:43] whatsoever things are true so let's
[1:11:45] start with the truth first
[1:11:47] whatever things are true whatsoever
[1:11:48] things of honest honesty is a great
[1:11:50] place to start as well
[1:11:52] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:11:53] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:11:55] lovely whatsoever things are of a good
[1:11:57] report if there be any virtue if there
[1:11:59] be any praise think on these things Paul
[1:12:03] the first messenger is telling you
[1:12:05] tonight quit thinking about the devil's
[1:12:07] things quit looking at his lies quit
[1:12:09] entertaining all the negativity and look
[1:12:12] on these things that are true that are
[1:12:14] honest that are just that are pure that
[1:12:16] are lovely that have virtue and strength
[1:12:18] in it and praise in it he's telling you
[1:12:20] dwell on these things because if you
[1:12:23] dwell on these things you won't pile on
[1:12:25] the other things and what you dwell on
[1:12:27] influences your actions it influences
[1:12:30] your tongue it influences your behavior
[1:12:32] then you wonder why those can jump and
[1:12:34] Shout because they're dwelling on the
[1:12:36] things of God it puts something inside
[1:12:38] of them it makes them on a shout it
[1:12:40] makes them want to jump it makes them
[1:12:42] respond to the word but as long as
[1:12:44] you're beat down and you're dwelling on
[1:12:46] the negative you take your eyes up let
[1:12:48] me just say you will not rise up so
[1:12:50] dwell on the things of God tonight
[1:12:55] put your focus
[1:12:57] put your focus on this
[1:13:01] we must make sure that the things that
[1:13:03] we're dwelling on
[1:13:04] they're Godly things pure things honest
[1:13:07] things
[1:13:08] notice
[1:13:09] let me say this tonight and you can't
[1:13:12] stand
[1:13:13] between two opinions

[1:13:20] the devil built it and he owns it
[1:13:23] okay
[1:13:24] well I'm on the fifth let me just say
[1:13:26] this you can't support the word of God
[1:13:28] and still entertain lives of the enemy

[1:13:33] tonight I'm not telling you this to beat
[1:13:35] you down and draw you in a corner but
[1:13:36] I'm telling you you can't stand between
[1:13:38] two opinions you can't say oh I want the
[1:13:40] Holy Ghost but yet you got a loose
[1:13:42] tongue and you're running everybody down
[1:13:45] no when you stand between two opinions
[1:13:47] you get spiritual Amnesia and the
[1:13:49] prophet of God said and you don't know
[1:13:51] who you are and I've been preaching to
[1:13:53] you over and over time declared to you
[1:13:55] that you are a son of God that you are a
[1:13:58] daughter of God you're not the devil's
[1:14:00] whipping post you're not the Devil's

[1:14:16] righteousness stand for godliness stand
[1:14:18] for truth and honesty tonight

[1:14:29] to flood your mind

[1:14:35] mama
[1:14:36] I'm just going to turn out like my daddy

[1:14:59] you do God will stand for you
[1:15:02] God will place you he will establish
[1:15:05] your feet but as long as you're

[1:15:23] there's a lot of tears that I have shed
[1:15:25] because of choices I had to make
[1:15:27] because I was going to stand for this
[1:15:28] truth I got a lovely family
[1:15:31] because I stood for this truth
[1:15:34] because I wasn't going to allow
[1:15:35] influences from others to influence and
[1:15:38] impact my childhood or a
[1:15:41] attack or attach yourself to my family
[1:15:44] tree
[1:15:45] and influence in a negative way
[1:15:49] cycle Breakers
[1:15:51] chain Breakers tonight
[1:15:53] notice the Bible says in First Peter 1
[1:15:55] 13 and I hope you're patient tonight
[1:15:57] because I'm not worried about time I'm
[1:15:59] sorry I'm just going to get this off my
[1:16:00] heart tonight
[1:16:02] First Peter 1 13 says wherefore gird up
[1:16:06] the loins of your mind
[1:16:09] so you got to protect your mind
[1:16:12] you just think well that's just great
[1:16:13] matter my IQ is one it ain't even in the
[1:16:16] hundreds
[1:16:19] big deal but the Bible says gird up the
[1:16:22] loins of your mind
[1:16:25] but see be sober and hope to the end for
[1:16:28] the grace that is brought unto you at
[1:16:30] the revelation of Jesus Christ see the
[1:16:32] mind is the bedding ground to the soul
[1:16:34] otherwise it's the place where things
[1:16:37] come to life
[1:16:39] your mind
[1:16:41] brother Mark if you thought I had
[1:16:42] something against you guess what it'll
[1:16:44] come to life
[1:16:46] and you see me in the hallway you just
[1:16:47] turn
[1:16:50] because you brought it to life because
[1:16:52] it's in a betting ground of your mind
[1:16:55] you young girls oh my girls they have a
[1:16:57] worse time with this than anybody
[1:16:59] dear Jesus
[1:17:01] man they didn't like my post they didn't
[1:17:04] like my locket or it's what's that be
[1:17:07] real
[1:17:09] nobody clicked on my be real today
[1:17:11] nobody likes me
[1:17:16] we get so caught up we're in a world
[1:17:19] that's so caught up well what everybody
[1:17:21] else thinks
[1:17:22] I'm gonna tell you if you want to get
[1:17:23] caught on what other people think think
[1:17:24] about these people sitting next to you
[1:17:27] what do they think about you
[1:17:28] they're here to support you young people
[1:17:30] they're here to encourage you they're
[1:17:32] here to have Bible studies with you
[1:17:33] they're here to pray with you they're
[1:17:35] here to to shed tears with you we're
[1:17:37] here for you don't worry about what the
[1:17:39] world thinks about you what the politics
[1:17:41] think about you and and what this woke
[1:17:43] generation is trying to do to you and
[1:17:45] the transgender movement trying to come
[1:17:46] after your kids you think about what God
[1:17:48] has done for you where God has placed
[1:17:50] you in a solid Church in a solid family
[1:17:53] that loves the Lord that loves this
[1:17:55] message you are a blessed people tonight
[1:17:57] so quit looking at the negative in
[1:17:59] everybody and everything
[1:18:04] see the mind is a Betty ground and what
[1:18:07] you allow in your mind is what you're
[1:18:09] going to believe and what you're going
[1:18:11] to believe is what you're going to
[1:18:13] produce
[1:18:14] and it's going to influence your actions
[1:18:16] it's going to influence how you speak to
[1:18:18] people
[1:18:20] how you respond to people how you
[1:18:22] respond in church
[1:18:27] notice Luke 6 45 says a good man out of
[1:18:30] a good Treasure of his heart bringeth
[1:18:31] forth that which is good and an evil man
[1:18:34] out of the evil Treasure of his heart
[1:18:36] bringeth forth that which is evil
[1:18:38] for of the abundance of the heart
[1:18:42] speaketh
[1:18:43] the mouth
[1:18:45] now I'm just going to tell a story on
[1:18:47] myself
[1:18:49] many of my close friends that are here
[1:18:52] tonight
[1:18:53] they know when I had that hospital job
[1:18:55] oh I was a little tear to be around
[1:18:59] brother Aaron told me he says we took
[1:19:01] bets in the parking lot at your house we
[1:19:03] like we don't know what kind of joke we
[1:19:04] getting tonight I guess we're going to
[1:19:06] see
[1:19:08] I'm glad you said that after I quit the
[1:19:11] hospital
[1:19:13] but see because some of us
[1:19:16] we're not able to hide our emotions
[1:19:20] we're not able to suppress our feelings
[1:19:24] and you let's just be honest some of you
[1:19:27] knew when you came to my house and I
[1:19:29] wasn't up for company I wanted to
[1:19:31] introvert
[1:19:34] and I had to suck it up you knew it it
[1:19:36] was all over my face
[1:19:40] but that's that's our Humanity we have
[1:19:43] to bear with one another
[1:19:45] we're not all created extroverts
[1:19:48] not everybody look my my fellowship
[1:19:50] meter pegs out
[1:19:52] it reaches a spot during the week I mean
[1:19:54] man when our I retired the hospital we
[1:19:56] Fellowship so much now think hey I got
[1:19:58] to take a break on Sunday evening
[1:20:01] but you young kids it's like y'all like
[1:20:03] to energize a bunny you just keep on
[1:20:04] going
[1:20:05] fellowship tonight tomorrow night the
[1:20:07] next night we're going to just keep on
[1:20:09] we're going to Sonic after church
[1:20:10] tonight
[1:20:12] my high word run out of gas please
[1:20:19] but we find sometimes out of the
[1:20:22] treasure or out of the abundance of our
[1:20:24] heart and sometimes we don't mean to be
[1:20:26] that way look I don't intentionally look
[1:20:28] I ha I do not like when I become that
[1:20:31] person
[1:20:32] okay let me just be honest with you so
[1:20:34] you don't think well brother Joe just
[1:20:36] loves being ugly like that when I come
[1:20:37] to his house keeps his air on 78 no we
[1:20:40] we started cutting it down thank you
[1:20:42] very much
[1:20:44] put it on 74. it's probably why I got a
[1:20:46] cold tonight
[1:20:50] we don't like going over his house he
[1:20:51] don't know what you're going to get with
[1:20:52] brother Joe he's like man I hope you
[1:20:54] just flipping a coin and you may get
[1:20:56] ugly Joe or good Joe you don't really
[1:20:57] know what you're gonna get
[1:20:59] but see
[1:21:00] from the abundance of a heart the things
[1:21:02] we dwell on when you dwell on stress you
[1:21:04] dwell on negativity that's all it's
[1:21:06] going to come forth
[1:21:10] when you think oh I can't make it I
[1:21:11] can't rise up I'm never gonna overcome
[1:21:13] I'm never going to achieve you will
[1:21:15] never overcome with that confession and
[1:21:18] the prophet of God said never let a
[1:21:20] negative testimony enter your mind
[1:21:23] you can help it
[1:21:26] but he says if they do what did he tell
[1:21:28] us about the former he said don't let
[1:21:30] them Roost there see that's the thing
[1:21:32] you got something to do and it takes a
[1:21:35] lot of effort
[1:21:36] to shoot down the negative
[1:21:38] to cast down imagination and all the
[1:21:41] lives of the enemy see Satan presses in
[1:21:44] your mind to destroy you
[1:21:48] notice what the Bible says in John 10
[1:21:50] and verse 10 the thief cometh not but to
[1:21:53] kill or to steal to kill to destroy but
[1:21:56] I've come that that they may have life
[1:21:58] and that they might have it more
[1:22:00] abundantly so Satan tries to destroy
[1:22:02] your fellowship with believers
[1:22:05] Pit Brother against brother
[1:22:08] and we're all striving for the same goal
[1:22:10] brother Tim
[1:22:11] we're all striving for a body change
[1:22:14] if our hearts as Ministers of the Gospel
[1:22:16] if our hearts are not to help you shame
[1:22:19] on us we need to be at the altar
[1:22:22] but we give our lives we give our time
[1:22:24] and our efforts to study so God can use
[1:22:26] us and put words in our mouth in a
[1:22:29] spirit in our heart to be able to speak
[1:22:31] things to the body of Christ to edify
[1:22:34] and to Build You Up
[1:22:37] we're not here to destroy you that's the
[1:22:39] devil recognize who he is so he just
[1:22:42] tries to destroy Fellowship he tries to
[1:22:45] destroy your own self-esteem how you
[1:22:47] view yourself
[1:22:50] because maybe your past failures destroy
[1:22:53] your relationship with God destroy your
[1:22:55] confidence in God's word destroy your
[1:22:58] confidence in the fifo ministry
[1:23:01] destroy your confidence in a god called
[1:23:04] Pastor
[1:23:05] and A God Called Ministry
[1:23:07] see say That's what Satan tries to do
[1:23:11] I'm asking you to be honest tonight with
[1:23:13] yourself
[1:23:15] remember makes this statement here in
[1:23:16] Hebrews chapter 7.
[1:23:18] you people with these saw blade tempers
[1:23:21] I know there ain't a person in here with
[1:23:23] a saw blade Timber tonight
[1:23:25] you people here with these saw blade
[1:23:28] tempers that's always spouting Alf in
[1:23:31] the mouth that somebody can't put up
[1:23:33] things like that he said be careful
[1:23:36] he says you're guilty if you speak a
[1:23:38] word against your brother that's not
[1:23:40] right
[1:23:45] so all these dinner conversations
[1:23:47] because you got hurt you know I've been
[1:23:49] hurt a bunch of times and I'm sure you
[1:23:51] have too
[1:23:52] I've been hurt by the ministry not on
[1:23:54] purpose
[1:23:56] but you can ask one of my kids any of my
[1:23:58] kids we never speak about the hurt
[1:23:59] around the dinner table
[1:24:02] you never speak about those things you
[1:24:05] learn to overcome your hurt
[1:24:07] and you recognize that's the enemy
[1:24:08] that's not your brother he didn't
[1:24:10] intentionally do that that was not on
[1:24:12] purpose
[1:24:14] but see Satan's trying to get in your
[1:24:16] mind bring that thing down to you to
[1:24:19] cause Division and to destroy
[1:24:21] so notice what the prophet of God says
[1:24:23] here because to me this is a very
[1:24:24] powerful quote he goes if he goes you're
[1:24:27] guilty if you speak a word against your
[1:24:29] brother that's not right
[1:24:32] let me just say it like this whether it
[1:24:34] even it has a 98 truth to it if it's
[1:24:38] spoken in the wrong attitude
[1:24:42] you've done done the damage because what
[1:24:45] you have done you've influenced that
[1:24:47] child sitting around that table
[1:24:50] and so now they're going to have a hard
[1:24:52] time receiving from the ministry now
[1:24:55] they're going to question whether or I
[1:24:58] feel like going up but I don't know if I
[1:25:00] can I don't have confidence in them
[1:25:09] he says go around and tear it down he
[1:25:11] says you don't have to stick a knife in
[1:25:13] a man's back to kill him
[1:25:16] you can break his character and kill him
[1:25:18] kill his influence speak against your
[1:25:21] pastor here say something bad about him
[1:25:24] you just might as well have shot him
[1:25:29] that's a powerful quote
[1:25:31] because there ain't one person in this
[1:25:32] building tonight that has not never said
[1:25:34] a negative word against another person
[1:25:37] shame on us I'm telling you I'm speaking
[1:25:39] to myself tonight
[1:25:42] because I want to be right with God I
[1:25:44] want to move on
[1:25:46] so we got to be careful
[1:25:48] but I asked you parents and grandparents
[1:25:51] you got to be extraordinarily careful
[1:25:53] around the dinner table
[1:25:55] yeah you're going to be hurt that's part
[1:25:57] of living
[1:25:58] but how you respond to that hurt is a
[1:26:01] part of Christ
[1:26:03] how you overcome in the face of
[1:26:05] adversity is a true character of a real
[1:26:07] golly man and godly daughter God
[1:26:09] but when you go running it down
[1:26:12] brother Joe looked at me he was in his
[1:26:14] little attitude he didn't want me around
[1:26:17] yeah you're probably right
[1:26:19] I feel like introvertent and you just
[1:26:21] brought the extrovert devil out of me
[1:26:26] and then you go run me down to everybody
[1:26:27] and then we have a youth service and
[1:26:30] your kids won't even show up
[1:26:32] because you don't kill brother Joe's
[1:26:34] character
[1:26:35] you destroyed my influence to help your
[1:26:38] children
[1:26:39] and when you do that against your pastor
[1:26:41] you do that against the ministry that
[1:26:43] ain't a man on this platform can help
[1:26:45] you or help your children
[1:26:47] because they don't have confidence
[1:26:49] you've killed it and you want to blame
[1:26:51] the ministry you want to blame the
[1:26:52] church you want to blame somebody else
[1:26:54] look when you point one finger you got
[1:26:56] three pointing back at you
[1:26:59] I'm asking us to do a self-assessment
[1:27:03] this church is going to get in one mind
[1:27:05] and one Accord and let the light change
[1:27:07] our dimensions
[1:27:08] that we've been hearing about
[1:27:10] church we got to have a reality check
[1:27:13] these things ain't gonna happen without
[1:27:15] effort
[1:27:16] but notice now so Satan will get you to
[1:27:19] see your failures and he will get you to
[1:27:22] see everybody else's failures he will
[1:27:24] Crown you with a critical spirit
[1:27:27] you won't move you won't raise your hand
[1:27:31] however as soon as you get out of that
[1:27:32] parking lot you just spatting It Off
[1:27:35] see your attitude says it all but it
[1:27:37] shows what you're dwelling on
[1:27:40] so we find now
[1:27:42] he'll never see the blessings
[1:27:45] of belonging to a local body
[1:27:48] I'm glad that my family and I get to be
[1:27:51] a part of your lives
[1:27:54] I'm so honored to be a part of this
[1:27:56] ministry team I'm honored to be a part
[1:27:58] of this church
[1:28:00] have we all we've been hurt absolutely
[1:28:03] but it's still an honor because when I
[1:28:06] sit and I rub shoulders with you and I
[1:28:07] have conversations with you and I've
[1:28:09] seen you struggling I've seen you
[1:28:11] overcome and I've seen you whether the
[1:28:13] attack of the enemy it gives me Faith
[1:28:16] because you failed to give up because
[1:28:18] you're not giving up
[1:28:20] but yet when Satan can Crown you with a
[1:28:23] crowded spirit and a critical spirit you
[1:28:25] will not see the good in those that you
[1:28:27] fellowship with those that you worship
[1:28:29] with all you will see is a Humanity
[1:28:33] and let me tell you our Humanity stinks
[1:28:38] it stinks it gets into a way a lot of
[1:28:40] times
[1:28:43] thankfully we have short-term memory
[1:28:45] loss and you know somebody offended you
[1:28:47] you don't see them and you don't get
[1:28:48] around them you may have purpose not to
[1:28:50] go to the house for three or four months
[1:28:51] you let that thing die down a little bit
[1:28:53] and you you try again
[1:28:55] that's who we are
[1:28:58] and I don't say those things in just to
[1:29:00] be joking but I'm saying it because the
[1:29:01] reality is Satan is against you
[1:29:05] and he's against your family he's
[1:29:07] against your church
[1:29:09] and he's against everything that we
[1:29:11] stand for
[1:29:13] notice now let me let me speed up I told
[1:29:15] you I'm just gonna if y'all don't mind
[1:29:16] I'm just going to take my time a little
[1:29:17] bit tonight
[1:29:19] so Satan would try to do something and
[1:29:21] I'm that that we're all familiar with
[1:29:23] and let's put a complex on you
[1:29:27] now this complex here is an emotionally
[1:29:29] significant ideas that are completely or
[1:29:31] partly repressed that cause psychic
[1:29:34] conflict leading to abnormal mental
[1:29:36] States boy that just sounds wonderful
[1:29:37] don't y'all want to sign up for a
[1:29:39] complex
[1:29:40] abnormal mental state tie me up
[1:29:44] but yet
[1:29:46] we can believe God for healing we can
[1:29:48] believe God for deliverance we can
[1:29:49] believe God for you know Deliverance
[1:29:51] over smoke and drinking line cussing or
[1:29:53] depression nervousness and fear but some
[1:29:55] of y'all most of us walk in the doors of
[1:29:57] this church over and over and over and
[1:29:58] we pack our complex in here
[1:30:02] won't you just pack that thing on up to
[1:30:04] the altar
[1:30:06] because all it is is a demonic Spirit
[1:30:10] trying to Crown your life with the
[1:30:12] reality that's false and it's a lie of
[1:30:15] the enemy
[1:30:16] so you find complexes we all have them
[1:30:19] don't act like you don't
[1:30:22] like I told you be honest with yourself
[1:30:25] so what causes complexes parental
[1:30:28] attitudes and upbringing things I just
[1:30:30] spoke about having that dinner table
[1:30:32] conversation around your kids cause a
[1:30:34] complex maybe negative remarks about
[1:30:36] somebody some brother some sister in a
[1:30:38] church negative comments about the
[1:30:40] ministry how they handle the situation
[1:30:42] or situations as a child remember you
[1:30:44] like mental maturity to be able to truly
[1:30:47] decipher and filter exactly the
[1:30:50] conversation
[1:30:51] and what it does it impairs your
[1:30:54] judgment of that individual for a
[1:30:56] lifetime
[1:30:58] for a lifetime
[1:31:00] it takes a lot of effort to look past
[1:31:03] that and get to know that person for who
[1:31:04] they are
[1:31:06] takes a lot of effort
[1:31:08] causes physical defects disproportional
[1:31:11] facial features weight height speech the
[1:31:13] effects vision things like that mental
[1:31:16] limitations and we find notice the
[1:31:19] manifestation of a complex
[1:31:22] withdrawal from social contact
[1:31:25] you turn introvert
[1:31:28] excessive seeking for attention
[1:31:32] criticism of others
[1:31:35] over overly dutiful obedience
[1:31:40] somebody's got to do everything for
[1:31:41] everything everything here they just
[1:31:42] constant
[1:31:43] fear and worry are manifestations of a
[1:31:48] complex in the most renowned one is the
[1:31:51] inferiority complex or the Napoleon
[1:31:53] complex
[1:31:54] you know he's got the short man syndrome
[1:31:58] overcompensating for something
[1:32:01] but see we all hear tonight if you're
[1:32:03] honest
[1:32:05] if you're honest
[1:32:07] you'd raise your hand say yes brother
[1:32:08] Joe
[1:32:09] whether you're a child whether you're a
[1:32:12] mother whether you're a father whether
[1:32:14] you're a grandparent whether you're
[1:32:15] single or not we all have face complexes
[1:32:20] all of us you're not alone
[1:32:23] you say well brother Joe you need to
[1:32:24] back that up with a quote I'm glad you
[1:32:26] asked me to I got it right here brother
[1:32:28] bam in the flashing red light the sound
[1:32:30] of his company he says I was making My
[1:32:31] Confession this is your Prophet I was
[1:32:34] making My Confession of having a complex
[1:32:36] now your Prophet wasn't too much of a
[1:32:37] man that he couldn't share his heart
[1:32:41] and expose his own self and his humanity
[1:32:43] and say I was making a confession of
[1:32:46] having a complex and I guess if I'd
[1:32:48] asked tonight in this audience of people
[1:32:50] how many here knows you have a complex
[1:32:53] he said practically every hand would go
[1:32:56] up
[1:32:59] he said there was a handsome young man
[1:33:00] sitting there this is in he cares that
[1:33:02] you care just in the peak of Life a
[1:33:04] leader of young men sitting there Satan
[1:33:06] bound him he never noticed but I took
[1:33:08] him took my hand left to shake his hands
[1:33:11] with his right hand to see if some
[1:33:13] disease had plagued him but there was no
[1:33:15] sign of vibration coming right out of
[1:33:17] the room from praying and fasting and
[1:33:19] waiting on the Lord the anointing of the
[1:33:21] Holy Spirit was there and that's why it
[1:33:23] led me let that's why it led us he goes
[1:33:25] then sing the shadow of Darkness over
[1:33:28] him notice a complex brings a shadow of
[1:33:31] Darkness
[1:33:33] that's ain't that's not life it's trying
[1:33:35] to destroy you and kill you
[1:33:38] he says I never said what I was doing
[1:33:40] but in less than a couple moments time
[1:33:42] it was all gone the coldness
[1:33:44] the coldness of his hands had left and
[1:33:46] he was shouting and praising God see how
[1:33:49] Satan was trying to upset that young man
[1:33:52] by referring him to some complex
[1:33:56] to be built back which the Holy Spirit
[1:33:59] knew and I seen it by a vision of the
[1:34:01] Lord see but God care for that man and
[1:34:05] God cared for that young boy and I want
[1:34:07] you to know God cares for you tonight
[1:34:10] that's why he changed my thought for
[1:34:12] tonight to come and speak to you and
[1:34:14] walk out
[1:34:15] notice what brother Brown says here he
[1:34:17] says
[1:34:18] you don't get a complex by the blood of
[1:34:20] Jesus you get love
[1:34:22] you get love not a complex I'm a little
[1:34:25] bigger than somebody else a little
[1:34:26] better than somebody else
[1:34:28] a little no better than somebody else he
[1:34:30] goes you got to get your arms around
[1:34:32] everybody it's on the basis of love
[1:34:38] now brother bear I'm in the message
[1:34:39] standing in the gap
[1:34:41] he says will you do this one favor for
[1:34:43] me both here and on tapes also you
[1:34:46] brethren pray that God will place in my
[1:34:49] heart that something that I lost
[1:34:51] out there in a complex
[1:34:54] wow
[1:34:56] what a man of God
[1:34:58] can come to reality with himself and
[1:35:01] recognize he lost feeling for the people
[1:35:04] because of a complex and if we're not
[1:35:07] careful we can lose feeling for one
[1:35:10] another because of a complex
[1:35:14] he says notice it's easy
[1:35:17] to build a complex
[1:35:20] because I had an interview the other day
[1:35:22] where brother way sitting here sitting
[1:35:24] here in the front in front of us a good
[1:35:25] man but he built himself around the
[1:35:27] complex another kind of complex did the
[1:35:29] same thing by the way you can easily do
[1:35:31] it he goes you just get to a little
[1:35:33] something in your mind and you keep
[1:35:36] thinking on it
[1:35:40] Well everybody's against me
[1:35:43] you're not good enough seems like I
[1:35:45] can't do anything right
[1:35:47] I don't feel accepted and even like
[1:35:49] Tabernacle I'm gonna find me another
[1:35:50] church
[1:35:52] nobody likes to have me around well you
[1:35:55] take that sour look off your face people
[1:35:57] want to have you around
[1:36:00] just seems that I'm always in the way I
[1:36:02] don't fit in with anybody any group
[1:36:04] if I'm gonna have any Fellowship I gotta
[1:36:06] invite them to my house nobody invites
[1:36:08] me over
[1:36:11] I never get invited
[1:36:13] I don't have a gift like sister Jessica
[1:36:15] or brother Timothy sure King priest like
[1:36:18] brother Tim all this Satan's there just
[1:36:20] working on you
[1:36:21] having you compare yourself with
[1:36:23] somebody else
[1:36:25] he loves to do that
[1:36:28] oh I'm Too Tall I'm too fat I'm too
[1:36:31] short my breath stinks well brush it
[1:36:33] I'm socially awkward
[1:36:38] see that's all the attack of the enemy
[1:36:42] comparing yourself
[1:36:44] to others
[1:36:45] you know God placed in every one of us
[1:36:47] his attributes
[1:36:50] his attributes your attribute may never
[1:36:52] stand behind this desk you may never
[1:36:54] stand over there and saying you may
[1:36:56] never play an instrument but what God
[1:36:58] placed in you is essential for the body
[1:37:01] some of you are wonderful hosts
[1:37:06] your wonderful host you invite people at
[1:37:07] your house all the time
[1:37:09] for y'all that don't get invited well
[1:37:12] you missed invitation because some
[1:37:14] people here open the doors to anybody
[1:37:16] and everybody
[1:37:17] but the Satan will tell you well I don't
[1:37:18] ever get invited I got to do all the
[1:37:20] inviting and some of us don't really
[1:37:22] know the legwork that goes into hosting
[1:37:24] a family or hosting the young people or
[1:37:26] hosting people period
[1:37:29] they do it because they love you because
[1:37:31] it's an attribute of God that he
[1:37:33] deposited in there but Satan will have
[1:37:35] you look at somebody else's gift and
[1:37:37] compare and then you sell yourself short
[1:37:40] because you can't sing like Sister Laura
[1:37:43] or you can't play the piano like brother
[1:37:45] Andrew
[1:37:47] you don't run like Sister Laura over
[1:37:49] here
[1:37:50] her sister Lana like a gazelle
[1:37:53] I mean oh
[1:37:55] I better not do that huh
[1:37:59] but I want you to know tonight we are
[1:38:01] all essential
[1:38:05] we are all essential there would be no
[1:38:07] Ministry at evening like Tabernacle if
[1:38:10] you wasn't in that chair
[1:38:12] with your peculiarities and with your
[1:38:16] attributes of God
[1:38:19] but that's placed here so that the
[1:38:22] ministry can develop those attributes to
[1:38:25] help you through hard times
[1:38:27] to help you through those complex
[1:38:29] moments
[1:38:30] when you're dead on yourself and you're
[1:38:32] dead on everybody else we're here to
[1:38:34] encourage you to lift you up
[1:38:40] to help you find a place that you can
[1:38:42] really have an experience with him
[1:38:46] see I can tell you my experience but my
[1:38:48] experience doesn't do you any good but
[1:38:51] you got to have your own experience
[1:38:53] you got to meet him for yourself
[1:38:57] in this church
[1:38:58] in these people
[1:39:00] have been very conducive and conductive
[1:39:03] to the spirit to call him and to pull
[1:39:05] him down in our midst and to allow him
[1:39:08] to penetrate beyond all that Humanity on
[1:39:12] all those mind battles and Pierce into
[1:39:15] the depths of your heart
[1:39:17] so that you can truly respond to the
[1:39:19] word of God
[1:39:20] so you can live the life that you want
[1:39:23] to live
[1:39:25] but Satan
[1:39:27] has imprisoned some of you tonight
[1:39:30] and I'm gonna bring this down here
[1:39:31] shortly
[1:39:32] Satan's in prison some of you with a
[1:39:34] false reality he's imprisoned you of
[1:39:36] reality of his own choosing his own
[1:39:38] making
[1:39:41] and even though you're a Christian
[1:39:43] even though you have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:45] yet you still battle things
[1:39:48] from your past from negative thoughts
[1:39:50] others may have put on you
[1:39:52] or maybe even hurt feelings has happened
[1:39:55] from people even here in this church
[1:39:56] tonight
[1:39:59] maybe you even battle your own self
[1:40:03] you know the genetics that you were born
[1:40:05] with
[1:40:06] some of us are hot tempered
[1:40:08] God can use it
[1:40:11] but you got to make sure we channel that
[1:40:13] in the right way
[1:40:16] but Satan is there
[1:40:17] and brother bam tells us kill him at the
[1:40:20] beginning it's not how long we can let
[1:40:23] the battle linger
[1:40:25] those negative thoughts come in your
[1:40:26] mind
[1:40:27] maybe you're not able enough when you're
[1:40:30] on strength
[1:40:31] you got a Ministry team here at this
[1:40:33] church call us up
[1:40:35] call your brother call your sister call
[1:40:37] those that you have confidence in and
[1:40:39] ask them to pray with you my wife can
[1:40:41] tell you there's been many a nights and
[1:40:43] I laid in bed and I said honey I need
[1:40:44] you to pray with me because I'm in a
[1:40:46] battle
[1:40:48] can I just share a personal testimony
[1:40:50] and maybe this may show my own weakness
[1:40:52] in my own Humanity several months ago a
[1:40:54] year ago I was called full-time in a
[1:40:56] Ministry I thought the doors are going
[1:40:57] to bust wide open
[1:40:58] and for the most part they did for a
[1:41:00] while I was out two or three times a
[1:41:02] month for the first seven eight months
[1:41:04] but things started slowing down
[1:41:07] and Satan began to work on me
[1:41:10] and work on my my drive because I'm a
[1:41:13] very driven person I got to be busy I
[1:41:16] spend four or five hours a day studying
[1:41:17] in the mornings and I go do something
[1:41:18] else in the evening and then I have
[1:41:20] nowhere to preach I'm like man the doors
[1:41:21] were not opening
[1:41:23] and I've allowed a complex
[1:41:26] to set over me and wanted to do it it it
[1:41:29] just clamped off
[1:41:32] shut me down for who I really wanted to
[1:41:35] be in that Easter camp
[1:41:37] brother Timothy called me to the back he
[1:41:39] text me
[1:41:40] come back here to the back
[1:41:42] and I'm just being personal because I
[1:41:44] told you I'm honest with myself
[1:41:47] and I went to the back and my brother
[1:41:48] Aaron were back there I was like man
[1:41:50] what's wrong with you
[1:41:51] what's going on with you you don't seem
[1:41:53] right
[1:41:54] and I'll say you know what I'm not right
[1:41:56] I was honest brother Derek I was honest
[1:41:59] every little thing infuriated me at camp
[1:42:03] I sat normally in the middle I got moved
[1:42:05] I was upset I got booted and then I got
[1:42:09] booted and nobody that was supposed to
[1:42:10] sit there sat there and I got Buddha for
[1:42:11] no reason but see that's how the devil
[1:42:13] works
[1:42:15] that's how the devil works now brother
[1:42:17] Daryl that's no hey YouTube is doing
[1:42:18] your job
[1:42:20] good job you booted me out I never sat
[1:42:22] back there again
[1:42:24] but that's how the devil works so
[1:42:27] because of that that was not it was not
[1:42:30] influenced by Brother Daryl it was not
[1:42:32] influenced by the ministry it was
[1:42:34] influenced by
[1:42:35] myself and my humanity and my makeup
[1:42:39] and because I came with that and didn't
[1:42:42] push that off every little thing that I
[1:42:45] saw rubbed me the wrong way
[1:42:48] and I allowed myself to be cheated out
[1:42:51] of a wonderful Youth Camp but in the
[1:42:53] back room brother Timothy called me back
[1:42:55] to he says what's going on with you and
[1:42:57] I just opened up my heart
[1:42:59] I didn't want to I'll be honest with you
[1:43:01] I didn't want to say nothing but I did
[1:43:03] because I knew I needed relief I needed
[1:43:06] to get out of that prison that I was in
[1:43:08] I was shut in there and it was only
[1:43:10] killing me it was only hurting me it was
[1:43:14] only hindering me and he said brother
[1:43:16] Joe what's wrong with you
[1:43:18] I said man I've been getting up at four
[1:43:20] o'clock in the morning I can't sleep I'm
[1:43:22] dwelling on this I said you guys are
[1:43:24] going all over the world preaching I
[1:43:25] ain't got an invitation and it's just by
[1:43:27] and he stopped he said brother the
[1:43:29] problem with you is you're so driven
[1:43:33] you're you have to be busy and Satan has
[1:43:36] anointed your drive and caused you
[1:43:39] to get to this point
[1:43:41] see the spirit of the Lord is still a
[1:43:44] discerner of the very thoughts and
[1:43:46] intents of the heart
[1:43:48] and he cut there just like that that's
[1:43:50] how quick it was brother Timothy and it
[1:43:52] point he pinpointed it right there and
[1:43:55] then him and brother Aaron prayed with
[1:43:56] me and that thing began to lift off
[1:44:00] now I could have held that I could have
[1:44:02] harpered that I could have just kept
[1:44:03] that to myself and brother Aaron's like
[1:44:06] did I do something I said no it's not
[1:44:08] about you or anybody
[1:44:10] well brother Timothy Lord used him to
[1:44:12] pinpoint what it was
[1:44:14] so I had to make a choice
[1:44:17] do you walk out
[1:44:20] or do you keep it
[1:44:22] do you walk out
[1:44:24] and be free
[1:44:25] and enjoy the freedom of the Lord that
[1:44:28] he brings because where the presence of
[1:44:30] the Lord is there is liberty or do you
[1:44:33] just hold that to yourself because you
[1:44:34] know what you don't want nobody to know
[1:44:36] what you're battling with her you don't
[1:44:37] want the Victory and you just want to
[1:44:38] pet this thing remember the maniac that
[1:44:40] came to brother Branham in Oregon when
[1:44:42] he fell over the prophet's feet
[1:44:44] they asked him is he delivered he said
[1:44:46] no is he dead he said no he said what
[1:44:49] then he said he worships that thing
[1:44:52] and as long as you worship that complex
[1:44:56] and you worship that Grudge and you
[1:44:58] worship that little feeling and you
[1:45:00] worship that depression and you worship
[1:45:02] that anxiety and you worship your
[1:45:04] failures you will never get free
[1:45:08] so I had to make a choice
[1:45:10] do you walk out
[1:45:12] or do you stay bound
[1:45:15] you know Harriet Tubman made a good
[1:45:16] comment she said I've freed a lot of
[1:45:18] slaves
[1:45:19] she goes I would have freed a thousand
[1:45:21] more if they would have only known they
[1:45:24] were slaves
[1:45:26] and I'm telling you tonight church if
[1:45:28] you be honest with yourself and know
[1:45:30] that you yourself had battle mind
[1:45:32] battles struggles in your mind struggles
[1:45:35] in your home struggles in your marriage
[1:45:36] struggle in your with your children
[1:45:39] if you would just be honest with
[1:45:41] yourself
[1:45:43] we can get free tonight
[1:45:45] we can get free tonight
[1:45:48] we can get into one mind one Accord and
[1:45:51] let that powerful light of the Holy
[1:45:53] Spirit Come and change our disposition
[1:45:57] see when I walked out of that back room
[1:46:00] at Easter camp
[1:46:02] there was a smile that came upon my face
[1:46:05] because it wasn't brother Timothy he's a
[1:46:08] smart man but he ain't that good
[1:46:11] God intervened
[1:46:14] God dropped down in that back room
[1:46:18] on a Sunday morning
[1:46:19] and spoke words of life
[1:46:22] words of life
[1:46:25] see the devil hit me at my weakness
[1:46:29] I was very vulnerable and so are you
[1:46:33] if you're honest with yourself
[1:46:35] if you're truly honest with yourself
[1:46:38] that's why the Bible tells us in Hebrews
[1:46:40] 12
[1:46:41] seeing that we're in compassed about
[1:46:42] with such a great cloud of witnesses
[1:46:46] let us lay aside every weight
[1:46:49] you know we think about that great cloud
[1:46:51] of witnesses and we think about the
[1:46:53] cloud of witnesses up here I'm talking
[1:46:54] about the cloud of witnesses right here
[1:46:57] look at this cloud of witnesses I'm
[1:46:59] looking at devil defeaters
[1:47:01] I'm looking at men and women who have
[1:47:04] overcome pornography overcome depression
[1:47:06] overcome fear I'm looking at those that
[1:47:09] have overcome addictions to to drugs and
[1:47:11] to alcohol I'm looking at those that
[1:47:13] have overcome fear and and Ambitions and
[1:47:15] and their own selfish desires oh you're
[1:47:17] talking about being compassed about with
[1:47:20] a throng of Holy Ghost Field Devils
[1:47:22] stomping no compromising tongues
[1:47:24] speaking praise worship Supernatural
[1:47:26] believing Victory dancing Believers
[1:47:28] that's what we're crowned about that's
[1:47:30] what's stoned around us tonight don't
[1:47:32] worry about The Throne of heaven I'm
[1:47:34] talking about your brothers and sisters
[1:47:35] here that are supporting you in your
[1:47:38] journey
[1:47:39] lay all the things aside every heart
[1:47:42] feeling every negative thought lay it
[1:47:44] aside and run this race it's time that
[1:47:47] you run quit thinking about quitting
[1:47:49] quit thinking about giving up and push
[1:47:51] out to the battle push on to the mark of
[1:47:53] the hot calling keep pressing on keep
[1:47:56] running don't give up don't back down
[1:47:58] don't quit God is on your side
[1:48:02] we are for you tonight we're not against
[1:48:04] you we're not against one another
[1:48:07] but we gotta lay aside every weight
[1:48:09] every complex every doubt every guilt
[1:48:12] every failure
[1:48:14] you gotta lay it all aside
[1:48:16] and I'm going to tell you
[1:48:18] it's hard
[1:48:21] but Christ wants you to be free
[1:48:23] I want you to live free want you to walk
[1:48:25] free want you to worship free he wants
[1:48:27] you to be free
[1:48:29] now let me bring this down
[1:48:31] go back to our scripture 12. Acts 12.
[1:48:37] before we get there as you
[1:48:39] before we turn there
[1:48:40] God's provided way
[1:48:43] Los Angeles
[1:48:44] Bob said don't make any difference what
[1:48:46] your past has been
[1:48:48] some of us say praise God
[1:48:51] don't make a difference
[1:48:53] don't make a difference what my past has
[1:48:55] been
[1:48:57] when you've got an invitation to come
[1:48:59] you're ready to come
[1:49:01] if you've been bad
[1:49:04] I know some of you cherubs out there
[1:49:06] don't know what I'm talking about but if
[1:49:08] you've been bad if you've been a street
[1:49:09] walker if you've been a gambler if
[1:49:11] you've been a drunkard if you've been a
[1:49:13] murderer no matter what you've been if
[1:49:16] God gives you an invitation knocking at
[1:49:18] your heart he will take care of the rest
[1:49:21] of it
[1:49:24] he said don't be weary well you say I'm
[1:49:27] a lukewarm Church remember he will take
[1:49:29] care of that
[1:49:30] some of you old house out there then got
[1:49:33] a little bit cold and got a little bit
[1:49:35] of lukewarm he'll take care of that you
[1:49:37] don't got to remain that condition you
[1:49:39] don't have to remain in that critical
[1:49:41] spirit no he'll take care of that
[1:49:46] notice
[1:49:48] acts 12 and verse 4 we're going to bring
[1:49:49] this home
[1:49:51] when he had apprehended him he put him
[1:49:53] in prison and these prisons
[1:49:55] were designed to psychologically and
[1:49:57] physically torture the prisoner
[1:50:00] prisons often had poor circulation the
[1:50:03] lack hygienic facilities they had rats
[1:50:05] and Vermin most prisons were in Chains
[1:50:08] they had chains on their feet shackles
[1:50:10] around their hands sometimes around
[1:50:11] their neck their movements were
[1:50:13] restricted
[1:50:15] prisons would be designed to strip the
[1:50:17] prisoner
[1:50:18] of his dignity
[1:50:21] and Satan throws you into a prison of
[1:50:24] his own choosing to strip your dignity
[1:50:30] strip your dignity
[1:50:33] and if you think I'm talking to you
[1:50:34] you're absolutely right
[1:50:38] because I've been behind those bars
[1:50:41] abandoned behind that lie I believed it
[1:50:44] myself
[1:50:46] sometimes I thought some of y'all were
[1:50:48] against me
[1:50:54] I'm just being honest
[1:50:58] sometimes you wonder do you have a
[1:51:00] friend in the world
[1:51:02] so yeah
[1:51:04] this is coming home I'm speaking to you
[1:51:06] tonight
[1:51:07] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:51:09] putting the words in my mouth to tell
[1:51:10] you you don't have to be that
[1:51:13] see he throws you into a prison of his
[1:51:16] own chosen to strip you of all your
[1:51:20] godliness
[1:51:23] notice now and Herod would have brought
[1:51:25] him forth the same night Peter was
[1:51:27] sleeping Between Two Soldiers bounding
[1:51:29] with chains and the keepers before the
[1:51:30] door kept in prison notice now here he
[1:51:32] was Peter was bound with chains
[1:51:37] one hand he had a chain chained to his
[1:51:40] right hand chained to the left hand of a
[1:51:42] PR of a guard his left hand chained to
[1:51:44] the right hand of a guard he was held in
[1:51:46] bondage he was held in chained he had 16
[1:51:49] men watching over him and what they did
[1:51:51] they put guards at the front door the
[1:51:54] second door and the in the the gate they
[1:51:56] had men and they could and it was a
[1:51:58] felony it was a crime for the guards to
[1:52:01] go to sleep they had to be on duty
[1:52:04] so I'm here to tell you tonight as
[1:52:06] brother Timothy alluded to on Sunday and
[1:52:08] I thought it was a great job he said it
[1:52:09] doesn't matter how many guards they got
[1:52:11] around you when God wants to step in and
[1:52:13] God's ready to break those prison bars
[1:52:15] and God's ready to rescue a son and
[1:52:17] daughter God it don't matter what you
[1:52:18] chained to it don't matter who's holding
[1:52:20] your captain tonight he's able to break
[1:52:22] you loose and free you and liberate you
[1:52:25] from those chains
[1:52:27] he's willing even tonight Church to
[1:52:29] forgo your past and say yes you're my
[1:52:32] son you always must my son
[1:52:35] Satan can't hold you
[1:52:37] when God's coming for you
[1:52:41] here he is is held bondage
[1:52:44] guards holding them back but the angel
[1:52:46] of the Lord came upon Him notice who
[1:52:49] came the angel of the Lord came upon him
[1:52:52] in a light shined
[1:52:55] in the prison
[1:52:59] and he smote Peter on the side and that
[1:53:01] word smoke means a gentle stroke to
[1:53:04] arouse him from his sleep
[1:53:10] and the Bible would tell us
[1:53:14] saying to rise up quickly
[1:53:18] and it's changed
[1:53:20] on a Wednesday night
[1:53:22] fell off
[1:53:25] his chains
[1:53:27] of humanity
[1:53:29] fell off
[1:53:31] his chains of past failures fell off
[1:53:36] his chains
[1:53:38] oh come on I said it's changed tonight
[1:53:41] they said you can't have your children
[1:53:43] Satan's got him he was a poor parent he
[1:53:46] should have done a better job or they'd
[1:53:48] be in the house of God those chains fell
[1:53:50] off
[1:53:51] those chains saying well what did I do
[1:53:53] to lose respect what did I do to you to
[1:53:55] cause his heart or cause his hardship
[1:53:57] those chains fell off
[1:54:00] and no matter what's holding you tonight
[1:54:02] I'm here to tell you the change that
[1:54:04] Satan has changed with they can't hold
[1:54:06] you because the angel of the Lord came
[1:54:09] in that room he came in that prison cell
[1:54:11] and he's come for you tonight and he's
[1:54:13] telling your brother and sister those
[1:54:15] chains can't hold you because God's here
[1:54:17] to liberate you you don't have to be
[1:54:20] bound any longer by lies of the Enemy by
[1:54:22] Broken chains you want to be free I'm
[1:54:25] telling you tonight freedom is here
[1:54:26] Liberty is here salvation is here a Holy
[1:54:30] Ghost is here a power of God is here you
[1:54:32] can be free tonight you can rise up I
[1:54:35] said you can rise up and the chains fall
[1:54:38] off and the chains fall off those things
[1:54:41] that once held you those complexes those

[1:55:21] my heart
