[6:20] who gives this woman to be married to
[6:22] this man her mother and I do you may
[6:25] have your seat
[6:38] could we bow our hearts for a word of
[6:41] prayer Our Kind Heavenly Father we come
[6:45] here on this special occasion at the
[6:48] joining of two hearts that you've put
[6:50] together we want to thank you for these
[6:52] two lives that have surrendered their
[6:55] heart to you and now they surrender to
[6:57] one another to be United
[7:00] we ask Lord that your loving hand would
[7:02] be upon them to bless them in their
[7:05] Union in the lovely name of Jesus Christ
[7:08] we pray
[7:12] amen wow what a what a special occasion
[7:15] here this afternoon to gather together I
[7:19] know the hearts of the Paris family and
[7:24] also the Green family is just swelling
[7:26] tonight with pride and we're so happy
[7:29] happy together for them going to read
[7:32] from Mark 10 and verse
[7:35] 6 as we look to the scripture and appeal
[7:39] to the words of almighty God for this
[7:44] moment but from the beginning of the
[7:46] creation God made them male and female
[7:51] and for this cause shall a man leave his
[7:53] father and his mother and cleave to his
[7:57] wife and they twain shall be one one
[8:00] flesh so then they are no more Twain but
[8:03] one
[8:04] flesh what therefore God hath joined
[8:08] together let not man put a
[8:11] ther what we're witnessing
[8:14] today is the
[8:16] ceremony of the oldest institution in
[8:20] the world before there was death
[8:24] sickness which are all the results of
[8:27] unbelief there was marriage
[8:30] marriage was before
[8:32] kingdoms and before
[8:34] governments marriage is truly
[8:38] Timeless and what is so important for us
[8:41] to understand is that marriage is not
[8:44] simply some man's
[8:46] idea man has tried to make it an
[8:49] idea but it is not something that man
[8:52] thought of first therefore it is not
[8:55] something that can be easily thrown
[8:58] aside
[9:00] it is not something that you can just
[9:01] vote away either in government or in
[9:05] lifestyle it is not something that you
[9:07] can change the value of or the meaning
[9:10] of without
[9:12] consequences if marriage was just an
[9:15] idea then we could ignore it or perhaps
[9:18] even discard it but because marriage
[9:23] comes from God's Own desire then it is
[9:26] doubly important to do it God's will
[9:30] way what we know about God is that he
[9:33] always brings things in
[9:35] harmony God is one of Perfect Balance
[9:39] that's why he created the heavens and
[9:41] the
[9:42] Earth and he brought everything in
[9:45] Perfect
[9:46] Balance nothing was out of
[9:49] Harmony everything was created for
[9:52] something else they are created to
[9:57] give and as God was created
[10:00] he created the Earth the Seas and he
[10:03] called it good and he created animals
[10:07] and he called them good he created plant
[10:10] life and called it good but as men dwelt
[10:14] alone after all of creation was finished
[10:19] God made the statement it is not good
[10:21] that man should be
[10:23] alone remember God makes everything run
[10:27] in harmony so so in order to achieve
[10:30] good out of what he saw was not good he
[10:34] fashioned out of the man the
[10:38] woman then it was good as the Book of
[10:42] Proverbs says whosoever findeth the wife
[10:45] findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor
[10:49] from the
[10:51] Lord and this is God's perfect balance a
[10:54] man and a woman God has brought together
[10:58] God's son and God's daughter and what is
[11:02] important to realize about the first man
[11:04] and woman is that before they met one
[11:08] another they met
[11:11] God and that became the glue that saved
[11:14] them and saved their marriage when
[11:17] trouble
[11:18] came the first wedding never performed
[11:22] was by God
[11:23] himself so this is his institution and
[11:27] we want to do it God's way
[11:30] not only to honor God but to achieve
[11:32] that balance that is so vitally
[11:37] important the scripture says what God
[11:40] has joined together let not man put us
[11:44] under well man has and is doing
[11:49] everything in his power to dissolve the
[11:52] institution of marriage by changing the
[11:55] meaning of it by changing whom it is
[11:59] too by putting Escape Clauses in
[12:03] marriage by marri marrying on
[12:07] conditions people enter into marriage
[12:09] preparing for the
[12:11] worst but it is only acknowledging that
[12:15] God is not the centerpiece of their
[12:18] life today this marriage is being
[12:21] performed in the name of Jesus
[12:24] Christ not as a matter of
[12:27] tradition but because we believe that
[12:30] what we do in his name will last it's
[12:34] not a lip service it's not a flippant
[12:37] acknowledging of of a God that we do not
[12:40] honor with our lives but as the one who
[12:44] is the glue in our lives the one who
[12:48] makes everything run right even when
[12:51] things go wrong For Better or For Worse
[12:55] is not just a phrase it is acknowledging
[12:59] that God is the
[13:00] centerpiece of this
[13:02] marriage for richer for poor is not a
[13:06] phrase is
[13:08] acknowledging that material things is
[13:10] not the means by which we are
[13:13] happy happiness does not consist of how
[13:16] much of the world's Goods you own but
[13:19] how contented you make yourself with the
[13:22] portion that is a lotted to
[13:24] you and it is because we have Christ as
[13:27] a center of this home he is your life
[13:32] and today your life is
[13:34] changing it is changing
[13:37] dramatically but it's changing for the
[13:40] good not that life wasn't good
[13:43] before but now your life is expanding
[13:46] and that's God's will is God's will that
[13:50] two walk together in agreement and the
[13:53] harmony that he designed it is important
[13:57] that we not let the cult of this age
[14:01] intrude on this harmony this age you see
[14:05] is designed to break up God's Harmony in
[14:08] marriage that's why the majority of
[14:11] marriages do not last in this age
[14:14] because people enter to marriage
[14:17] selfishly instead of before God but when
[14:21] God has joined two
[14:23] together let no man put us under for it
[14:27] is a love an eternal love that comes
[14:30] from God you know we live in times that
[14:33] are constant with constant challenges
[14:37] and and marriage is not to be an escape
[14:40] from the world but it is indeed a
[14:43] commitment to Greater service to the
[14:45] World by demonstrating to a Fallen World
[14:48] the power of the Gospel we live in a
[14:51] world of trouble world of strife and
[14:54] sorrow and pain and there's drunkenness
[14:57] and drugs that are pre prent and
[14:59] infidelities and anger issues that can
[15:03] overwhelm and destroy a home and wreck a
[15:06] marriage however even in this wicked and
[15:09] evil age know for a certain someone will
[15:16] overcome and Jesus spoke of the end time
[15:19] like as it was in the days of Noah when
[15:22] men's hearts on evil continually and
[15:25] because of this there would be marriage
[15:28] and given in marriage by divorce and
[15:31] remarriage but what is joined together
[15:34] before God and the Holy Angels should
[15:37] never be put
[15:39] aunder by any man or woman our behavior
[15:43] and our attitude toward each other
[15:45] should not result in dissolving the holy
[15:51] Union but it should it should result in
[15:56] bringing two together with life lives
[15:59] that are surrendered to God but
[16:03] unfortunately so many unions are
[16:05] dissolved because men and women fail to
[16:08] keep that sacred the the holy Union that
[16:12] God makes between a man and a woman and
[16:15] God is pushed from his place of
[16:18] preeminence by our own stubbornness and
[16:22] selfishness Silas and
[16:26] Lily you have found in each other life's
[16:31] companion the one that you
[16:33] will this journey with the rest of your
[16:37] life on this journey you will share joy
[16:41] and heartache together you will share
[16:44] secrets but not have secrets your life
[16:48] will be Fuller now because you're
[16:50] becoming one with each other it is a
[16:53] lifetime of commitment a road that'll
[16:56] take you to many places and he's PL
[17:00] is one where memories will be made it is
[17:03] because of our Lord Jesus Christ that we
[17:05] realize that no matter what life throws
[17:08] at us we're both committed to him he can
[17:12] turn what's bad into good and make good
[17:15] even better the joy of this day is not
[17:19] just the joining together of you both
[17:22] but the complete Joy is knowing that
[17:25] because the Lord Jesus is the
[17:27] centerpiece of this m marriage it's
[17:31] Eternal it's important to understand
[17:33] that there's only one way to approach
[17:35] marriage and that's God's way in 1 Peter
[17:38] 3 we are told to dwell together as
[17:41] husband and wife and that if you fail to
[17:44] accept God's given roles that God places
[17:47] you in that even your prayers can be
[17:50] hindered you see he is the answer and
[17:53] will be the answer and will be the
[17:55] solution to everything you will face in
[17:57] life that's why we do this in his
[18:02] name Silas and Lily you stand before us
