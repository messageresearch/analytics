they have so appreciate it we just want to give them a a warm welcome and just so happy that they're here with us and of course you know um a while ago that song was sung for brother Ron boo devil that's his song when he woke up from the coma Z from the burn he said boo devil amen I tell you what he's been taking the word of God and backing him up ever since so we are we're here today to claim our promise our inheritance and what belongs to us as the children of God and you know as we look around and see what God has provided for us we are thanking God for allowing us to gather and honor him for these great Provisions that he has given us and I thought about it today as we bought this property back in 2013 and started building and God provided Miracle after miracle and I'm announcing tonight that God is not through doing the miraculous amen I'm announcing that there's victory over your enemies Hallelujah and I am prophesying that the enemies who have troubled you will trouble you no more amen that every service you will hear this weekend will prophesy you into Victory amen you know the brother Bram said about the false prophet he said he he prophesies people into the tribulation well we're we're prophesying by the word of God people into a Rapture amen now you may have forgotten the victory's past but we should remember like David you know he remembered the bear and the lion fell in defeat and so would the Goliath before him and so will your enemy fall before you and in moments of trouble with we sometimes get like Israel when they were slaves down in Egypt they forgot the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and The Marvelous Deeds that he did to their fathers or for their fathers and you know the Troubles of years of bondage had had overwhelmed them and they had forgotten his power and forgotten his Works brother brandham said in the message Victory Day that's what's the matter with the church today we've too long forgotten that Jesus Christ is a same yesterday today and forever we forgot that God as a Healer can make the sick well we forgot the baptism of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the disciples and was given from generation to generation for anybody whosoever will could come we have forgotten that long ago then he speaks on about Moses went down and he said he had to get his glasses focused and I'm just want to say this that's what we are here for this week we're going to focus right on the Promises of God cuz we're right here in the last day amen and so he went down after he got his glasses focused you know how he did that he met with a pillar of fire anden he heard the voice of God was sent with a commission he got his glasses focused and he seen that it was God's program what he was to do he went down he fought hard he had many great battles one of his great trying battles he said I'd like to bring it when he had um achieve by showing signs and wonders by different things that God had spoke to him and showed him to speak the word and it would become material and happen same thing we have today speak the word over the sick and watch it heal and do these other things that God's word spoke through human lips you say to this mountain and be moved and don't doubt it but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said Jesus said so now we believe that and hold to it and take it and believe it so the word this weekend will be spoken and it will go over the audience and and over the people and they will be healed they will be saved they will be delivered they will be filled with the Holy Ghost we will be revived and we're going to leave from here Victorious Brother David spoke on Sunday the book is open and we will dance with victory over our enemies and brother Bram told is give me a church that's so Anointed with god Till there every action and move is thus sayith the Lord and walk in that CH kind of Glory I'll show you a messiah an anointed one of God standing on the earth and I believe tonight that brother Tom Ray is an anointed one that is walking in the Shan glory of the Holy Ghost and Heaven is here to back up the word with signs following I'm telling you tonight tonight get ready for victory amen this is a time of Triumph Hallelujah shutting with God in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his place his face now what I want you to do I want you to forget everybody that's around you right now and I want you to shut in with God and say Lord I'm made every effort to be here and I'm now here but the devil is going to come in every way that he can to distract you to pull you aside to get your thoughts here and there but I want you right now to shut in just say Lord I'm going to hear what the spirit has for me tonight not just tonight but every night every service of this meeting I'm going to hear from you but to do that I know I'm going to have to is shut in going to have to shut the other things off get in the sh Glory the veil around me shut off the noise of everything else and lock in and say Lord now speak to me you sent a minister all the way here you ordained these meetings and it was before the world was created they were ordained and God has this predestined moment for you don't miss it don't miss it lock in says brother Tom comes tonight ask God to speak to you personally shut in with God right now shut in with God in the SE place in the spirit beholding his face to gain new power to run in the race I love to God in a SE great in the spirit [Music] be power to run a race I [Music] maybe you could continue playing and we'll pray okay father we love the presence of God Lord because when you come something good is going to happen Lord we're gathered tonight joining one another our lick of Fire Lord that we could be in that one mind one Accord that Lord we could see the supernatural move Lord from Pew to Pew front to back Lord that you would have your own special way every service Lord that you come is special and so Lord we're just asking that you would take the speaker the hearer that the word of God lord would find good ground within our hearts Lord I'm not looking for tenfold or 20 Lord but that would be great but Lord would you give us aund fold you said in your word ask abundantly that your joy be filled so Lord as the pastor already prophesied over the people may there be a manifestation of your word may it take a hold of every life and every heart For Your Glory GL and for your honor break the bread of life to us we pray in Jesus name amen don't let me look at you let me look at you I love you much I love your pastor much you've been prayed for over the years and you've been the world to us in Cloverdale brother brother Tim puit brother Timothy puit has had a profound effect upon our church upon me and upon my family so we deem it an honor brother Tim to stand here we don't really do we don't say those accolades without empty words it's from the depths of my soul so I'm thankful to have my family here my sons and their wives ious one is brother Darren roxan from the church is show you're somewhere I saw you God bless you I trust you put your order in you got to you got to expect something right you're just not looking at me who me right I'm a Nobody But if you put your order in to him you will have a wonderful time in the presence of God Amen and some of the Saints from Texas God bless bless you and all around brother Tim has mentioned I just trust you'll have a special time this week this weekend David started the services and I'm just going to say Amen to whatever Brother David preached and I'll just try and put my shoulder to the wheel and trust you could use it so you could be affected and that the word would find an entrance and that you could not be the same again all Ministries are different all Ministries are different and so I just trust the Holy Spirit could remove the man and and take the vessel so that your need could be met tonight God bless you all nice to see you Diana God bless you you know what mingling sheep is that what we call it sheep mingling well we're going to be all sheep mingling in heaven so we're just getting a little taste of it I have my one of my best friends brother Ron and his family here sister Connie God bless you thank you so much I'm humbled that people travel that far I'm sure it's not for me I'm Michael right or brother Ron but anyway we'll take the word if you don't mind to turn to Mark chapter 5 God bless you you now you got to do a a real big favor for me a real big pull that's that's the biggest favor I can ask pull amen Mark chapter 5 verse 37 Mark 5: 37 and he suffered no man to follow him save Peter James Peter um Peter and James and John the brother of James and he come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and he seeth the tumult and them that wept wailed greatly and when he was come in he saith unto them why make ye this ad do why weep and then Dam D is not dead but sleepeth the damsel is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn can you imagine now you're coming to a set of meetings you've got a request on your heart might have told a friend or a family member said I'm going to church God's going to meet me at church and they laugh in their heart they say nah that's impossible but I want to tell you I'm the impossible you're the impossible the word of God has found an entrance and God has brought forth the very life of God Amen why makees a do why weep and the damsel is not dead but she sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when he put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entered in where the damsel was lying and he looked at the damsel and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her T Kuma which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise and may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats various needs amongst us we're ready for a Rapture we're not just coming to church but we're coming to come with a purpose that God wants to meet us individually God wants to get a hold of young men and young ladies that have not had an experience with God let the Holy Ghost fall meet their heart's need and awaken them to the realities of Christ once you get that spark or that fire you will never ever be the same again you say how can you say that preacher because when I was 21 God lit my lights saved my soul and I've never been the same again yes but you got weaker as you got older no sir this word has unfolded greater than at any other time in my life God's not weak he strong and in my weakness then a lot of times we we try to muster up our own strength and we say well we can do it I'm going to do this I'm going to meet it but I want you to remember in why Christ speak brother Braham said it was him that said to me speak that's right that's what we need to be in tune with God so that when he says something to you you're not going on your own authority you're going on the word Authority he said when those squirrels were were spoken into existence it was him that said how many when the little fishy was dead it was him that said raise up the little fishy it was he it was God that used the prophet huh for sister hadie right you can have a million you can have your sister's healing but it was him that said ask anything it wasn't him under his own power or his own Revelation it was God that revealed the word to him right so there's more power in you than you actually realize how many it's just this is just you know me getting warm and you getting used to me okay how many here is Born Again filled with the Holy Ghost I I I hold it high like like what does that do to me that doesn't do anything to me come on who's I'm not ashamed of the [Applause] Gospel so we're filled with the Holy Ghost then we've got God in us we're not we're not we're not a Pentecostal group we moved past that the word has unfolded and as you've heard over the years this seven seal is unveiled and it was the opening of the word that gives us power it's not our ability it's the open word which is Christ amen so anything you desire When you pray you can have what you ask it's true brother Tim he said if you say to the mountain be removed cast into the sea you say not the preacher not the Deacon truste or Elder it's it you say we're getting to the place SS of God where the Prophet said when she realizes who she is I'm sorry I'm quot as I've said both other places I will quote the message this is what I put my life for there's no other message but this message you eat the message you consume it daily Hallelujah yes sir he relied on what the word said he did he relied on what the word told who he was he knew he was Messiah Malachi 4 knew he was Malachi 4 come on the bride knows who she [Applause] is this is the greatest event that's ever taken place Satan is being crushed come on put him under your feet tonight don't be a wimper don't be a wishbone have a [Applause] backbone I hope this happens and I hope that happens no that that is a useless English word it's useless faith hope and charity if you look at the word hope it is not hope like the English language I hope it happens but if you got the hope of the scripture that's an Earnest expectation that it's going to take place so I wonder what your expectation is tonight God's going to save me God's going to deliver me God's going to Grant my heart's desire tonight amen I I heard a pastor tonight said you're going to have Victory well then you got to believe who you are Jesus believed what the word said he was can't we believe what the word says you are and saints that lays there we read it sometimes sometimes we forget about it but when you read it next time underline it Circle it put it on your desk do whatever you want to do because those are key thoughts those are key thoughts he had to believe what the word said he was so the word had to believe the word hello we are the word made flesh today this is what the scripture says then you have to believe what the word says you are my children aren't saved ask my wife's not delivered ask my wife need or my husband needs a holy ghost ask amen open your mouth I've never heard the scripture said God does mind reading huh no sir who God Jes Jesus attention blind bar the woman with the blood issue they followed the word they reached to the word and the word responded don't sit and look at me just say Lord It's not the preacher I need it's the word that's being ministered it's going to meet my [Applause] need Hallelujah I believe that the Prophet prophesied this church will be victorious not defeated Victorious I got Christ M of God revealed now we are the sons of God not we will be but we are that's a fact it's already been spoken and now all I am doing is getting caught up in that word yes sir Hallelujah brother Tim pro preached serpent Stompers I don't know how many years ago I love that message it's been branded in my mind that's been my whole life Stomp The Devil beat him up he's be you up enough why don't you start beating him up Take God at his word say Satan I bind you in Jesus name amen I believe in Victory I've lived in Victory I have Victory it's not a hope so but it's a it's a hope of the scripture that there's Earnest expectation for desired results Hallelujah are you still with me all right you help me preach now now in the message gyus in the message gyrus but in that the Lord Jesus and this has been a an anchor for me for a long time but in that Lord Jesus he was possessed with a power that went beyond these Earthbound Traditions you write this one down you put it and just you can make reference 1954 0803 gyrus but in the Lord Jesus he was possessed with a power that went beyond those Earthbound limitations yes sir he walked over to that cold stiff form of a dead girl oh Hallelujah listen what he said he took her by the hand looked all around where is everybody they're outside making fun criticizing and everything but he was possessed with a power that could speak into another world Amen let's awaken to this reality the prophet came not just that we can live a nice life here but to pull us into another dimension Hallelujah he said that's not my voice that's his voice From Another Dimension yes sir sir hallelujah oh he took her by the hand he looked all around where's everybody they're outside the crising and everything he was possessed with a power that could speak into to another world oh we say that's wonderful and it is indeed wonderful that's glorious but it doesn't stop there he spoke in tongues and he said tell what do you like that people don't want to speak in tongues huh is

you that's right I'll say that's right that's right that's right can I hear that's right that's right that's nothing but the truth brother Tom Hallelujah okay so he's given us we're possessed with the

look Beyond the Veil and say God redeem that daughter God redeem that son hallelujah amen so we're possessed with the power well you say brother Tom where do you get that in the scripture can I take you to revelation 22 you don't need to turn can I take you to revelation 22 and read verse 16 I jesus sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David I'm the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride what is they say the same thing she's speaking his language so I say to you tonight if you're not born again come if you need the Holy Ghost come if you need Victory come if you've been around this message for even a month and have no Victory I doubt your experience I'm going to trip over that thing but you know what SS of God that's why you you need to be filled with God in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face it's very important not to learn the message oh and people they can quote you under the table and they can say this the prophet said this and the prophet said that says I'm not interested even what you're saying he said I'm interested in your life amen that nullifies the knowledge of carnal man but there is a knowledge that comes from above and that's the kind of knowledge we want and that knowledge will translate you into another kingdom because your voice and your body have to match your theophany and I want to ask you are you listening or hearing from your theophany tonight well you say that's a big word Tom and I get confused with that you don't need to get confused let me help you with this okay theophany if you die you go to your theophany all right you go into another dimension that's your theophany Okay then if Jesus raptures when we're in our theophany he actually takes you takes your body in the grave lifts it up and that's your glorified body it's not complicated you're making it complicated it's not you had a body here prep prepared for you before you came and God put that Tom Ray into that little baby that wasn't supposed to live that wasn't supposed to live my mom was supposed to die I was supposed to die but guess what when God's got his hand in your life there's no devil there's no situation there's no car accident there's no nothing no virus no nothing can destroy you amen amen we're mean to do business tonight I know we're moving along in the [Music] clock I'm not a long preacher don't worry brother Tim says I am I was testing him out in the car say what's Sunday morning like he said you can as long as you want I said wonderful so I'll be short tonight so I don't make you mad okay so so now the spirit and the bride say they're saying the same thing so then the prophet says the final under her messenger she's the final voice to the who's who's that person now if I had two hands which I do I'll go like this and if my leg was a hand I put that up too I want the devil to know I really do I love what brother you say brother Tom you're getting old is your memory gone not yet not yet I think brother Donnie Reagan was out part place in 1991 uhhuh he and he told us he said when I get out of bed I want the devil to know Donnie Reagan's getting out of bed I thought that was a tremendous that was tremendous so I said I want the devil to know that Tom Ray got up this morning no I'm not around devil I'm going to no I'm going to walk I know who I am going to walk it talk it speak it live it love it hallelujah amen that's the way with a Christian Hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of God something in us that we come from somewhere and we're going back again by the power that's pulling us you sing the chorus I'm sure or the song I Feel the pull I hear the call huh well it's not just a song it's a reality I'm not getting pulled over into Leia I'm not getting pulled over to the bar when I drive by the bar I'm not getting pulled over to the world I'm getting pulled into the presence of God to where I came from I've come from God and I go back to God that's what the Bible says Jesus said i' come from the father I go back to the father where did you come from where did you come from huh you came that spiritual Gene came from the very thoughts of God forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever Invincible amen We're Going Back Again by the power of God that's pulling us that little do drop that glistened and shine shines and shouts because it knows where it came from and it's going to be draw back up again Hallelujah a prophet tells us that little story and who is this mount kzdc a very important message you say oh that's a cute little analogy no that's my analogy that's why I came down then the sun came and it started beating on me but one day one day when that light so shines I'm going to raise up into the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus yes sir oh my you know what now this is Brother Tom brother Tim can correct me and forgive me and all that sort of stuff thanks brother Tim I hate a weak need lukewarm message believer I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't know maybe you're still coming because there's still hope all right and I not the hope of leod deia but the hope of the scripture that there's an Earnest expectation for a completion not that you might get it but you're going to get it so keep persevering keep being [Applause] persistent amen there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word hearing that voice and become aware of our father calling us and recognizing that we're the sons of God God we heard his voice we cried out as did the prodal son save me oh my father I'm returning to thee that's all you have to do tonight I don't need to see your hand but I'd lift it if I was you brother Bram said that was actually a supernatural act to do that you're showing that you're Defying Gravity and you're letting God know here I am here I am [Music] Hallelujah now if you want to turn to it you don't have to but it's Daniel 4:31 don't need to it's just a short verse while the word was in the king's mouth well the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from Heaven well I want to say and when they heard the voice out of the Queen's mouth there came down a voice from heaven now do you how many here think it was just brother brownon no good because it wasn't it wasn't that was God using the vessel so then when that word came the Bible said there fell a voice from heaven now that voice that was crying to that King was a correction you can read the chapter uh Daniel 4 when you get home but when that voice comes down to you and me it's to raise you up from where you came from so that word in the Hebrew it means cap batco it means now the voice which is being revealed that voice revealed is a Divine will of God so you think it's just the voice but the Hebrew Hebrew says when that voice comes down from heaven it's the Divine will of God for us so it's not something you put on a shelf it's actually something you consume because the voice came down the word is unfolded and you said give me the book and the angel said take the book then the John said give me the book amen and that's a little bit of desperation there give it to me that's give it to me that I might consume the word amen because it's the Divine will of God for us amen I know that gets a little bit squeaky but it's true nevertheless because it wasn't our voice that came down it was God's voice that came down as John the Baptist forrun the first coming of Christ your message will forun the second coming of Christ that was not William brandom's voice that was the voice of almighty God that was that Pillar of Fire moving praise be to God a voice fell from heaven came from heaven and was heard or it preceeded from Heaven it's a heaven relation a revelation of the Divine will of God given to the believer as one speaking in the first person it's God speaking through the prophets God speaking in the first person that's right wow yes looking to the Unseen he says I know it's truth it's God's word it's truth something begins to pulsate in your bosom that is truth then make ready you're coming out of there just as certain as I stand stand in this Pulpit tonight don't look at what you see or how bad I'm crippled or how sick I am what the doctor said don't you look at that you look to the Unseen and what God Said say what God Said don't add to it don't subtract from it say what he said amen before the pain leaves and before the hand moves and before the eye can be open open it's made ready it's already made ready it's already unfolding make ready for it's going to come okay I you got a little quiet on me on that one okay we'll just preach away okay make ready what did what did John Ryan say what did John Ryan say Okay simple I I know this is all you know all this I'm just saying it by God's grace for a little meeting tonight what did John Ryan say though he was blind a prophet prayed for him is that true Prophet prayed for him and laid hands on him and said Do you believe you're healed yes I believe and he goes away nothing happens comes back the next day and he goes to brother Brown gets in the prayer line he says I thought you told me I'm here he said I thought you told me you believe huh you told me you're a Believer you told me you got the Holy Ghost then you got power to speak worlds to have that power you better now start speaking to this carcass come on get your flesh under subjection get your flesh under subjection amen because why that spirit of God in you will pull this body subject to the word of God has it yes it has you can ask these brothers ask ask ask one but has it changed you well then it'll keep changing you cuz God once he starts never stops come on if God started a work in your life

unsaved loved ones you want to get saved how many all right claim it then speak it I want to hear those names come on 1 2 3 oh no come on speak to the mountain speak it that's it this is mouth called open put some Force into it let tell the Lord how much you love him he's never failed me and he'll never fail me ever fail me that's right so let your body come subject you to your confession that mountain is going to move the mountain is going to move brother said even if it was a little grain of sand he said it's still moving don't doubt believe amen so there's brother John Ryan he says all right I do believe you okay I do believe you didn't he say that he said he said you said brother BR said you said you believe me he said I do believe you he said then go testify testify testify I wish I could sing huh testify he's making what they think a fool of himself but what he's doing is getting the scoffers out of the room he's getting the doubters out of his way amen extra extra read all about it I am healed they mocked him they scoffed him but that didn't move him didn't move him I don't want this word to move you either you take Christ not the words of a [Applause] man Oh I thought you said I believe I thought you said I believe sitting in a barber chair you know the story you know the story it's good to rehearse it you know the story I know the story preach many times on it but

Ghost Hallelujah at the most unassuming time Lor watch God come behind your confession hallelujah hallelujah glory be to Jesus then why don't you start making ready just go to them and say you're

looks like God's turning to Israel who's in the news Israel Israel they're fighting for their existence they know how to do it too they don't just bomb a house they annihilate the enemy may maybe we shouldn't hold that tape you know brother Tom's getting too explicit here that Israel has a right to exists because God loves Israel but let's hold it down it's not just Israel it's 144,000 not one bomb not one bomb vest not one grenade not one bullet is going to make it 143,00 430 whatever right look at not one of them is going to be missing on that day can I give you a flash news report not

feeding from a banquet table of man's Breads and grapes of this Vine we're feeding off the body word of the son of man not me a son of man is him the son of man that's Amen brother Brown didn't have anything for himself he knew who he was in Christ and that is why we're preaching tonight Lord who am I and then you can say I am she change your question to the [Music] answer soon the lamb will take his bride that's what we're living for that's why we come to these special meetings 1 Thessalonians 4:13 I would not have you ignorant Brethren ignorant Brethren concerning them that are asleep but ye shall not sorrow even as others which have no hope for we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them which are asleep in Jesus God will bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord not the word of a man but the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain yes unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them that are asleep for the Lord himself shall desend now we know the scripture but I'm saying Israel's in their land Israel's fighting for their existence God's turning from the Gentiles to Israel come on brother Tim and I we were speaking in the car Russia wants to push the button North Korea wants to push the button but God's holding it off maybe for that one that's here this weekend M would he do that yes he would if God Can Count 144,000 and not one would be lost uh-huh surely your name that's written in the book he is not going to lose you no sir for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout well we know the shout was the prophet is that right we know that we're in the coming then yeah it's say we're not oh I'm waiting for the coming of this great Millennial Day Saints we're in that we're in it and if you aren't in it I would get in real quick I wouldn't delay that's right I wouldn't delay for the Lord himself shall descend with a shout and the voice of the Archangel which is the voice of the Resurrection and the Trump of God shall sound say we're we're living it oh we thought the Messiah was to come we thought John was to come and what did Jesus say John is already come but I say unto you that he shall come that blows the minds of the theologians but a seventh grade educated Prophet takes that scripture of Matthew 11 and lets them know is that right Matthew 1711 I believe is that right somewhere in there it's in the Bible go read your Bible check me out fact check me don't worry I get it at home all the time I'll say some story and the kids the children that are come from our little school they'll go on Monday morning and fact check by the Tom gives me a complex taper you'll get it one day Revelation 101 a mighty Angel has descended that we've lived in that and now we're looking past at that telling you that that is passed now because that happened we can preach what we're preach we're not looking for it to happen it's already happened amen we're speaking another language all right and he had in his hand a little open or closed it's open right so it's the open book it's not a closed book we should be able to Rejoice What I Hear on last last Sunday you should be dancing around this place I saw my name it's opened up it's a revelation I'm going to be changed in a in the twinkling of an eyee let me show you a mystery we shall not all but we shall be changed what day brother Tom this day I'm living in this day amen so in the breach brother BR starts with this question who was it he said the owner the original owner owner took the book of redemption in his right hand No Angel no Angelic being nothing else could take its place it was the bloody lamb that walked out and took the book out of his hand so people look at that well what takes place go God can do anything he wants to do God can change form can change veils can change theophanies can change and people try to understand how could be on the throne and take the book from the throne oh my I am not not confused at all I hope you're not God's doing this it's all God and not man it's all God what is it brother this is the most now listen to me this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture you know when the seals were being broken and the Bible says all Heaven heard John Rejoice because there was one worthy to take the book right yeah all Heaven rejoice and all under heaven and all in heaven all around her and rejoice and when the seals were being open in Jeffersonville yeah it's about as quiet as it is right now but John was rejoicing Hallelujah there was one worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof it will never be amen it will always be God that's right [Music] Hallelujah Jesus answered them saying the hour has come the son of man should be glorified you're at the end of an age in the first seal his ministry is ending see The Hours come when the son of man should be glorified what about it the hour has come when the bride shall be taken away and I heard a there a time now we're living in the time don't look for another time look for this time it's happening all around us look at America look what's coming into your political system see the shaking that's going on she's going to go bankrupt and I heard an amen around the whole place your nation's going to be bankrupt we're going to be bankrupt but Rome has to come in you say they're giving money away they're giving this away they have to to bankrupt the system so Rome can come in and take it back with Wall Street Jews but here's the best part of the story it's not a story when that pack takes place the bride's gone oh we're going to have nothing that's right we came in the world with nothing we're leaving with nothing hallelujah praise the lord it's happening and if I was a young person that wasn't saved filled with the Holy Ghost I'd get a little serious tonight I'd say brother Tom I need salvation Dilly ding wai waiting pausing the Rapture is upon us this stage is set to go I'm not saying that to make it a fearful thing but it is a fearful thing amen God spoke from his eternal Throne the prophet said to say that the seal was to be revealed and when it was placed before John it was in symbol then John saw it it became a mystery why it wasn't even revealed then it cannot be revealed until what he said at the end time but it come in a symbol but you know that God made a prophet on Sunset mountain and say go back to Jeffersonville and I'll meet you there he said I would have made a terrible mistake this morning I was looking at uh what whatever books he was looking at and he said but I would have made a terrible mistake but then he came amen so it wasn't a man that opened and revealed the book it was God that opened and revealed the book and it's not complicated cuz he preached before the seals God hidden and revealed in Simplicity after the seals God hidden and revealed in Simplicity say it's all too complex to me no it's your lifeline amen amen hallelujah now is my soul troubled Jesus said in John 12:27 and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came you into this hour got to put your name there because I'm in him yes sir he said father glorify thy name then there came a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified and I will glorify it again can I say to you this morning or tonight whatever day it is I broke into another day father glorify your son next verse that thy son might glorify thee come on come on the glory of God is God's thought opinion about you when Christ who is our life shall appear we shall also appear with him in glory which is God's thought and for God to reveal his glory to you in the Greek means you're worth it there's no way he's going to reveal his glory to somebody that's not worth it but if you look up in the Greek if God's going to show you his glory he's telling you personally you are worth [Applause] it Hallelujah when Christ who our life shall appear thanu be manifested then we shall be manifested unveiled what is this display of the Bride it's a manifestation of Christ yes sir that's right so when Christ whose our life shall appear he's been appearing amongst us brother said un recognize presence of God he said why is he appearing like this he said to awaken your desires that you have for him to you that is glorious that is glorious so this unrecognized presence of God the world can't see it but you shall see me the world can't see me no more but you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world we have arrived then I say to you tonight rejoice and again Rejoice because you are bound found worthy as he Reveals His [Applause] glory oh my oh when the saints come on Go Marching In I'm going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I'm not going

courage I want a double portion of God's love in my S I need his devotion I can't what got to go there live this life alone it's true I've been converted it's all true but God save me God delivered me and he didn't lose me he didn't lose us it just gets richer and deeper and I love him more I love him more Hallelujah John the Baptist brother said proven his word I better watch my time here what time did we start okay s oh I haven't changed my clock yet I got lots of time I'm two hours behind love it I'm sure happy I'm not one of those church goers that goes and I learned a lesson a long time ago I never say give me five more minutes because the kids will challenge you on that they'll put their stopwatch on huh he said five he's taking 15 so give me some [Applause] time open-ended right John the Baptist was Malachi 3 that's right Matthew 11 says so if you can receive it this is he who spoke of behold I sent my messenger before my face it was Elijah certainly Jesus said it was but not the Elijah all right of Malachi four it's very very clear very clear he said now in my commission I am just your brother are you listening I am just your brother by the grace of God but when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then the voice of God to you amen hallelujah so you don't put on a tape for background it's the voice of God to you come on it's the voice of God to you when he comes down I'm just your brother but when he comes down I'm the voice of God to you so next time you pick up the tape you just say before you listen to a tape tape what is it now computer when you click the computer on yeah say just a second that's God's thought coming through this channel yes sir and that's God's word speaking to me it's amazing how people so casually just discard it they come to the message five six years walk away they had no Revelation all they enjoyed was Fellowship I'm sorry I might get in trouble here huh they just come to a church because it's nice because you sisters are lovely and the brothers are so kind and they enjoy that kind of Fellowship only for so long and then all a suddening they're gone because they've never been revelated because the gates of hell can never Prevail against the Revelation you become a prisoner of love to Jesus Christ do you understand that it's very simple he said but when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you maybe it offended you for me saying that forgive me I felt that that might have been resented but I am the voice of God to you hallelujah what that same voice that came from that other realm coming into this realm to pull us into that realm that's right it didn't just for us to quote brother brandham it's for that word to stimulate us say I'm going home I'm going to take a change not because brother Tom said so or any Minister says so it's because the word of God said so it's the voice of God to you maybe if I've offended you I forgive me but I felt that might be resented but I am God's voice to you and I say that again that time under inspiration you see I felt bad about it the first time but I repeated it amen that's sometimes why we repeat he said he said that five minutes ago well we'll say it again repeated it now I can say nothing in myself but what he shows me you believe it that was not my my voice I heard that voice from the excellent Glory coming to this dimension for a purpose not just to be heard but to pull us back to where we came from so he said that was not my voice that was him now nothing could be hid from him whatever that voice was speaking just a few minutes ago it wasn't your brother it was Jesus Christ using my voice are you are you hearing me all right now you are suffering with a nervous condition you're extremely nervous person then you're pending an operation it's a large tumor located in your stomach inwardly those things are true that was not my voice that was him so oh brother Tom we've heard that before hear it again do you know now believe the voice that's speaking then was not my voice it was my voice but it wasn't me operating my voice I do not know what's wrong with the woman whatever he said is on the tape down here and you can read it tomorrow whatever he said is true true and that's the truth a voice came and said as John the Baptist forrun the first coming your message will for forrun the second coming when they stood there and witnessed the Morning Star coming down out of Heaven circling like that and said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming here that Pillar of Fire came whirling out of the air coming down where I was standing and the voice said as John the Baptist foran the hour has come when your message will spray the world I love that because brother Bram uses that spray in another another quote where he said the blood of Christ sprayed the world it has gone around and around the world that's right we have a we all have enjoyed the message Hub brother bisc had a a great burden and vision to put a message Hub and brother Darren has been very one of the most ingal integral parts of of creating that Vision to materialize and what is it brother Darren right now how many countries have not downloaded uh last four four countries and one's the Vatican so that doesn't count sorry seed of Satan I mean North Korea can you imagine this world has gone around the world under the Great Commission go therefore in all the world and preach the gospel but it couldn't the Great Commission couldn't be sent until the seals were open and it's amazing that it's going around and around and around the world we don't want to miss what God's doing right now you've been wonderful pulling and very attentive but I just want to prepare to close now don't miss it whatever you do don't miss it it's happening and I I and I felt that coming here tonight when your pastor was speaking on these things and I'm thinking how perfect brother Tim how perfect the subject and what was spoken was coming together and just giving me a little bit of a charge that you're in the right channel preach it it's happening we see it happening I want you pinch yourself pinch yourself Lord awaken me to the reality of what's happening when you get in your car young man don't talk about what you got big how many hamburgers you can eat or what milkshake you're going to have you might have banana I know some people put an order in already but let's put our order in the word we got we got some meetings to to to preach and to let the Holy Spirit deal with us and I'm believing that you can take the word even right now and you can be a different person than when you came into this room I believe that with all my heart I believe it with all my heart but let it be according to you to you according to his word but then you've got to say Let It Be unto me Let It Be unto me according to your word Lord be a Mary be a Mary I am the Lord God that raised up Christ from the dead amazing quote unseen looking to the Unseen amazing quote Brothers have preached on it over the years tremendous quote I love this quote here brother Brandon and said don't don't you feel that pulsation of Faith don't you just feel that and I'm feeling it right now I don't you feel that pulsation of Faith but just lift up your hands he said just lift up your hands if you want to come to the front you come to the front he said just lift up your hands let's just worship Him and the Holy Spirit comes down I am the Lord God that raised Christ from the dead amen I'm the one that sent the Holy Ghost I'm the one that give you the promise brother Brenham has nothing to do with this I have S he has surrendered his life to me and I'm using his spirit and I'm talking through his lips that's me I am the Lord we should Rejoice this is not a message of man this is the message of almighty God and I Heard a Voice from his excellent Glory this is my beloved bride hear ye her come on not a nice quote but a reality it's a lovely reality it's lovely the church brother Bram said here's the the quote that you you know so well out the latest see in church age the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouthpiece God's turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride he never left you out he never left you out I come from him I go back to him right amen now listen I will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her so now let me ask a question is it the brothers that are speaking or is it God speaking I know that gets to be a hard gospel to swallow cuz you're looking at my veil but you have to pierce with eyes of understanding to go past the veil and hear the word of God that's what you got to do you got to do it Saints you have to do it he will confound her it's another language you're speaking from another realm God's speaking to you in that realm and you're speaking back that word into that realm and you can say I feel the pull brother Tom I'm being drawn to his bosom we're winding up in this great hour Brother David this is for you as we came down from Switzerland we're coming off the mountain we're coming down coming down and as we come down around the mountain we come down and there is a horizontal rainbow not an arch rainbow a straight rainbow brother Bram said there's something great laying ahead of us right now the years have been the joy that we've looked forward to the pressing the coming of that great light and now we can see the breaking over that horizontal realm is breaking between Mortal and and immortality we can see it breaking Between Heaven and Earth from an Earthbound sickness and troubled world into a bright shining day of immortal life and an immortal body in an immortal Earth

the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself I say whether things on earth or things in heaven blotting out I want you to listen to this now in closing blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us now I want you to think about that it was contrary to us took it by the way nailing it to the cross that was not the voice of a man that was the voice of God speaking through Paul your sin Washed by the blood of the Cross now I want you to think about it blotting out the ordinances of sin that were against you if you take a word of blotting out of ordinances it means when God looked at the record of your sin God took the blood and sponged it that means he took the blood and smeared it so that he could never read what you have ever done so if God can't read it you can't read it this is a voice from Heaven your sins they were Scarlet they're white as snow pulling you to this next Dimension it's a sponged it's a smearing it can't be read well he did that I did not I did not do that all my sin pass present and future come on past present future gone this is not the voice of man this is the voice of God may you go in the victory of that Revelation that when you wake up in the morning and the devil says you did this I did not you did this I did not do that it's underneath the blood of the Cross of Calvary it's been
