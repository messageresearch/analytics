hallelujah you love him today isn't he wonderful to us we come tonight with great expectation of what the Lord would do for our hearts you know many times we especially in my case you go to doctors and set all day long and doctors do the best that they can but they're only practicing Physicians but you've come to a meeting where there's a living [Music] God and he's not practicing and he knows your needs even before you call and he's here tonight to meet your needs he's not a God that has to go back and check if he's got enough funds he's already got it provided for that's what makes the devil so nervous cuz he knows that he is loser again he's been fighting some 6,000 years and he knows that it's a people like you that he can't hold with gravity much longer you're getting ready for a body change not just a healing but for a body change we certainly love you with all of our hearts and I'd like to thank all of you for being here like to thank you for your efforts for coming and once again and I know you've been touched by the presence of the Lord thank every Minister for being here brother Tim and brother Timothy and all the team that's here I'd like to for them thank them for having us to be a part of this again this year we never take these things for granted we never take it for granted and we so thank you so glad to have our people from our church and and my grandchildren that are here and and uh little teddy that's here Teddy would you raise your hand and he believed last night God healed his eyesight amen legally blind in one eye and he believed last night God touched him in a special [Applause] [Music] way don't you love him amen let's talk to him just now now you talk to him like a friend cuz he hears and answers every prayer Heavenly Father how we love you tonight we ask you tonight that you would forgive us of our sins our mistakes maybe words out of place or attitudes Lord this week you've changed all of our lives from the youngest to the oldest we felt you sweep by and Lord there's just nothing like your presence that warm presence that comes in a special way and we know that you're standing in the room now father if we would become aware tonight that there's Angels standing all over this building but greater than all of that is you're here I would ask you tonight that hands have went up and every one of us have needs and on this special service we believe that we can walk in this service one way and walk out completely different now Lord I Surrender myself to you I ask you that you would come and borrow our body brother Brandon would use the term give us a temporary Resurrection now not only for the speaker but also for everyone in this building let us put aside tomorrow or our trip home or what we've got facing us Lord come and speak to our hearts in a special way we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen and amen God bless you God bless you if you will turn with me to Revelations chapter 21 and verse one wow I have certainly enjoyed brother Danny and brother Andrew this morning Hallelujah I've heard brother Andrew for a long long time now that was the best I ever heard him preach and so he just got himself out of the way and let God borrow his body and so amen I was so blessed by that amen if you missed that on the internet go back and watch that it was so tremendous Revelations chap 21 and verse one and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth that's where we're going for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death we ought to be able to shout right there neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely and he that overcometh shall inherit all things he's talking to you and I will be his God and he shall be my son you may be seated we have a special guest with us Brother Lou Leo however you say it from China and uh over over here here we are he he been a real friend and we was in China with them and we had prayer lines that went one six hours one about three hours and God came and did some phenomenal Miracles there and amen and so we just are so thankful that you're here with us to stand in the prayer line tonight and may you see many more miracles tonight and but thank you and your wife for being here thank each and every one of you uh my grandchildren are here could you guys stand up for for me just now I I want amen amen God bless you God bless you thank you Titus you got the same color suit and the same color tie amen we got the memo didn't we when I first came and the reason I did that is when I first started coming to this meeting I remember it was Lydia and Esther and Bethany I I think they must have had reserved seity they sat basically right in front of the preacher and they were young ladies then and now they're married and and being blessed and God has watched over them and their incredible part but I look back and life has has came and our journey is still with you and we we certainly have been blessed throughout the years four and a half years ago I stood in brother Tim's Church during his fall meeting and I stood and preached a sermon that you may remember it was called take it back I I'm four and a half years later not aware that I would be fighting cancer within a couple of months after that sister Connie that's here she said that that sermon made the devil mad and cancer came and and we have fought it for four and a half years we're going to win it we're going to win it I want to hear the doctor say you don't have to take chemo anymore that's what I want to hear him say I I want to hear them say that to me and I want to hear them say zero cancer I believe that can happen over the last few weeks God the Lord has dealt with me I was going to take a different subject on this evening and the Lord continued to deal with me and and continue to turn my thoughts over and over again and tonight I'd like to speak to you take it back so what I look at as as I examine these thoughts and look to step into this service this evening we can look at that sermon four and a half years ago as prophecy and I want to look at tonight as fulfillment in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 8 it's very familiar to us because I'm not the only one fighting a battle I believe every person here fights a different battle so this service is not about me I'm just going to be your speaker for the evening it's about you we are troubled on every sight yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair Hallelujah persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be man made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have in the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I belied and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore we speak now we realize that when God said says he can do something he not only shows that is that he can do it and shows his purpose but he confirms his word we serve a God that has never failed he has never lied he has never been in a crisis he never calls his angels together and say I don't know what I'm going to do with this next situation it was pre-planned before the foundation of the world and you're an attribute of God that is now made physical on the earth born a certain day you're sitting in this building people in Noah's age would have liked to have lived here in Jeremiah's age would have liked to have been here but God reserved you come on on to be the final Runners of the final age the final voice of the final age your life is is playing out a symphony it's playing out life a song and Satan is doing everything he can do to stop you he has gambled hell against you but I would like to say this to him tonight he has never been able to stop us right and he never will even Jesus body laying inside of the Tomb the scripture said that corruption could not touch his body you and I was inside of him and no matter how much the devil says he's going to destroy you if he couldn't corrupt you 2,000 years ago he can't do it tonight the scripture says and if you would just hang with me just for a moment in 1 Samuel chapter 25 and verse three now the name of the man was nabal and the the name of his wife Abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance she was beauty and brains together amen yeah Hallelujah but the man was curlish and evil in his doings and he was of the House of Caleb here was a woman that was trapped in marriage she was trapped with an abuser she was trapped with a man that did not appreciate who she was how beautiful she was and amen how brilliant that she was so was you I didn't just read that scripture just to read that scripture so was you you was married to your first nature and the enemy was cruel made you a slave put a lot of things in your life that you're very ashamed of today but there was a man that was on his way to being King he had been anointed by the prophet Samuel that he would be the king and God had great plans for him in his life God watched over him he became an exile and while in Exile he would become Abigail's husband and he took because of that nebal died he took her as his wife and she had great wisdom yeah and she was incredibly beautiful God looked at you as beautiful God looked at you and saw something that the devil could not [Applause] see let's move forward in Chapter 30 in verse one and it came to pass that David and his men were come to zigg and on the third day the ambl kites had invaded the South and zigg and the smitten had smitten zigg and burned it with fire and he had taken the woman captive and and were therein and they they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way and so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive and David and the people were with him lifted up their voice and wept until there was no more power to weep and David's two wives taken captives and he says and Abigail the wife of nabal the the camelite I didn't read the first one don't know how to say it and David was greatly distressed you ever been greatly distressed yes sir for the people spake of stoning him because of the soul of the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters notice these words but David encouraged himself and the Lord is God and David said unto Abel and amal's son I pray thee bring me a hither the ephod and Abel brought the thither the ephod to David now notice these words and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them and he answered pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail I love God's words recover all now can we preach to you just for a little while Philistines amalekites other in other different types of demons fight on different ways the Philistines will fight you in the front scream at you make all different kinds of boast Bluff you do everything they can against you but all you need to do is pick up some rocks amalekites will sneak in behind you when you're away at War you're mighty in Valor and when you come home to see them you're home and all of the relationships will be destroyed now I want you to just think what's in your home it's peace it's love children relationships that God give to you Satan would do his best to destroy all of your friendships and your Rel relationships he would do his best to get in behind you and sneak and you're away at service on Sunday and on Wednesday and whatever times your services are and your prayer meetings are he'd like to destroy your home he'd like to destroy your life he'd like to become a squatter now remember brother bam says a squatter is a Satan is a squatter he don't legally own this and he's had 2,000 years to fuss whether he owns it or somebody else owns it but Christ came as a kinsman redeemer and he re redeemed it back to us but Satan possessed it but you know after a while this great fight's over and he'll be cast into the Lake of Fire but the HS of Salvation will come with Christ I love that part don't you now I want you to just notice David is a man that's on exile he's he's a man that is now fighting against enemies and he's winning war after War we know of many of the wars that he's won men have gathered themselves to be with him because they have a revelation that he's headed for to be the king amen Mighty Men will gather with him and you could talk about the three mighty men that killed hundreds and hundreds going to get him a drink we could talk about David picking up a rock and then men taking a hold of faith and going after those Philistines Army but he's been away at War and now he's away at War and the amalekites have come to his home and they just they they have they've made a decision we're going to burn his houses down we're going to burn The Vineyards down we're going to burn everything up but we're going to take that which is the most precious to him and we're going to possess it now you can imagine you've been away fighting the devils and you come home and now your home is destroyed now everything seems to be falling apart David just only few hours ago is a Great Hero he's a man on the way to being the king but now it's just not David's home that's destroyed it's your home that's destroyed do you think that the devil is just after the pastor do you think he's just after brother Brown he's after every one of us and if he could he would come and and destroy you at a moment's notice if he could he would take your life he sends his best allegiance of demons against you and God standing their guard over top of you Satan can't touch a hair of your head until he gets permission from God and God has a testimony service about you that you don't know nothing about you heard it about job listen more than just job God's had a testimony service he has a testimony service about you there's none like this Bride on the earth there's none like them and Satan begins to make challenges against it and begins to bring up things and and begins to bring different things up and look how they failed and look how but under the blood of Jesus Christ Our God don't see none of it but how quickly he reminds you of your mistakes last week two weeks ago months ago but if it's under the blood of Jesus Christ and you've truly repented not even God can see [Music] it not even God can look at it and if God can't so it see it why do we beat oursel up about it thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ don't get yourself your eyes on other people's mistakes it is Satan that'll point out failures you keep your eyes on Jesus Christ it's easy to stand and stand strong when you're when you're with a hundreds of people but listen when you're alone that's where you prove who you really are now you can imagine putting yourself in the spot you come to a spot and you're standing on the ashes of your house what a tragedy that it would be standing on the ashes of your failures standing on the ashes of your mistakes amen and people around you now become critics instead of warriors with you David was on his way to being king and a Great Hero but now he can hear the murmurs of L ston him it's because of him we've lost our family it's because of him all of this tragedy isn't amazing how Satan's will quickly try to turn us against one another that's right but that's when you've got to stretch your arms bigger that's when love has got to project that's when you've got to forgive that's when you've got to have a heart bigger than all the mistakes in the world that's where you show godliness like never before in spite of Satan's works even when you're standing in the ashes sure we pick up rocks but those rocks are not for one another they have followed this wondering Outlaw now we've come into a we've come to a spot now that our homes are destroyed you know as long as Jesus was on the scene nobody wanted to Stone Peter James and [Music] John you know as long as brother Brandon was here all the focus was on him that's right but now it's your [Applause] turn now it's your turn and you say well brother Ron I just feel so unimportant let me just say this to you if there's anything that you could have got out of this camp and every one of us that's right every one of us are important in God's eyes and even the devil has to recognize that you as a Believer when you roll out of bed can shake the kingdom of hell I don't live where you live but God put you there there I may not be in your family but God put you there I may not be in your church but God put you there and every one of us have a responsibility fight like you've never fought before we must overcome Le we must finish this race Satan will not win we've read the book we will fulfill the [Applause] vision brother Ron why are you going there David was going to be king he was on his way to being King one of the greatest kings that ever would live in Israel God knows your future don't you get yourself hung up on temporary circumstances don't you stop and fall away just because something's grabbed a h of you God will help you through your battle David was going to be king and there was nothing the devil could do to stop it think about that just for a moment just because his home is burned he's still going to be king amen just because they're wanting to turn and stone him he's still going to be K just because you're going through a horrific battle tonight you're still the Bride of Jesus Christ there's still a Rapture right in front of you we're going to set at the marriage supper of the Lamb stupid devil he can't do nothing about that thank you Lord I'm going to talk personal to you now for a moment yes sir how many families in this building or children young people in this building your family has been affected by cancer yes yes yes cancer is one of the most Dr Ed diseases in the world brother brand explained that cancer was a demon that takes a bruised cell and then begins to has a life that comes to it and then it begins to eat on your good sales and begins to try to destroy and it goes from one organ to another organ to another organ and maybe you've sat in doctor's offices your loved on sat in doctors' offices and heard some of the most horrific reports that they could hear that's right and listen No Doubt the doctors are doing their best to give you a quality of life we pray and we pray and pray and pray but we've heard another report that's right now you see let's just go back just for a moment our Prophet was standing in a cave how many you raise your hand again he was talking about your family all right he was talking about the disease he was talking about that and the conversation went that if you can get the people to believe not even cancer right not even cancer not even cancer not even a burned house not even a destroyed [Applause] home not even a destroyed home will stand before it heart conditions how many families have been touched with heart conditions divorce prodal you're praying for prodal prodal a lost Mom and Dad the devil's getting nervous he's getting nervous he enjoyed it it was just a house but now he's getting nervous he's getting nervous cuz you're identifying that our God is greater no doubt David as he stood there his heart was broken it was shattered he felt like he couldn't go how many of you have cried until you can't cry anymore I've heard my wife weeping in the night I wouldn't let her know it but I heard her weeping in the night she's an incredible Warrior you as a family when you're when you're with your loved ones that are suffering from cancer don't you give up don't you give up and I want to just say this to you if your loved one time runs out and life expires let me just say this you Satan never wins he never wins if a heart attack strikes a real believer in that moment that last breath here is the first ble breath in [Applause] heaven cancer takes a patient and it takes it in life cannot be sustained in this body God has prepared a body are you with me he's prepared a body for you you heard it this morning he's borrowed your body to live in but it just don't throw you away like the devil throws you away when he's done with you he's got a house he's got a house likeing under his glorious body that will never taste of of sin again it'll never taste cancer again it'll never have a heartache again there'll be no pain Hall when David got to the bottom of his barrel all right and you say well brother Ron why are you preaching this because God spoke to me that some of you are standing on ashes all right that's right and you feel like that you just can't press on another day I want to tell you Victory is right in front of you the scripture says that David encouraged himself now this is a dangerous thing for hell hallu because the only place to encourage yourself is in God's word and he began to rehearse powerful scriptures he be to rehearse the promises of God he'll never leave me he'll never fail me he will be with me yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff you're with me God when I don't see you you're with me when I don't feel you you're with me you're with me when nobody else is with me I failed you God but you have never failed me I have run out of energy but you've never run out of energy I've done things to hurt you but you've never hurt me you've never failed me you've never give up on me I don't know about you but you know after a while you begin to see yourself in the promises and you start reading the self and the strength starts coming inside of you and now he's not dancing and killing lions and bears and goli now it's his turn because now it's [Applause] personal now it's personal it's not my brother it's not my sister it's new when you can look at the mirror and say devil you're a squatter that's right you've took some things away from me I'm coming to get it back why don't you this in the next five minutes in your minds just start thinking God I want to make a list I want to do some reporting brother Gabe you're you're a police officer an investigator with the state police you're also a deacon you're also my nephew that married my niece that sounds strange don't it we're all family here but they were no blood kin they just happened to be in marriage situation but don't that sound funny you in the blue blue blazer right there right there right there yeah you stand up right there there believe you Daddy has cancer is it right heard that I'm not Discerning I just heard that now the devil has done some squatting where's his cancer at okay yeah he's probably stage three four four so the doctors are saying we're giv up so we're going going to treat you even with paliative care we're going to treat you in this form and life not going to be much longer you've heard those things I'm not telling you something you don't know but you're a Son of God how old are you he's he's you're not married are you now you could just sit there and go oh my what a horrible thing or you could call a law there it is now the law has a right to do whatever they got to do not just to arrest the criminal but to get back the goods so you send the Holy Ghost after that death and it's a disease that you can't see you can't feel but the Holy Ghost goes after that thing the doctors are only treating the symptoms but by his stripes on Calvary by his stripes at poock judgment Hall he refused to give up he refused because Isaiah 53 said he was wounded for my trans transgression he was bruised for M iniquity and the chastisement our peace was upon him and by his stripes we got a promise we got a Biblical god-given promise and he's never failed he's never give up there's not a case too bad I choose to believe the doctor the doctor Jesus over top of all of it you can be seated you was used this morning I believe I'm going to use you tonight tonight you didn't get mad this morning you get mad tonight I'm going to get you his name is Brad I knew Brad for what 25 years Brad and I I went and brother Brad sorry friends are Brad and so brother Brad and I we've known each other I've been in their homes stayed in their home and we actually rode bicycle together we enjoyed that he came to a tough spot and I heard that he was in a tough spot you you spoke about it this morning you know God don't give up on you cuz you get in a tough [Applause] spot I believe you call me if I'm right my my memory serves me right and I was underneath a power line and I was there and I picked up a very negative attitude a lot of blame and bitterness you remember those days you remember those days you didn't give up did you sis you didn't give up you probably felt like it we're just going to be honest here just for a few minutes you probably felt like it you probably felt like shooting him you know I didn't I didn't get off of the phone and go man I hate that for him God send the Judgment after him no no no no no no amen when I hung the phone up I got on my knees I got on my knees and I said God he's a prodal I don't know what's caused bitterness and I don't know what's caused negativity and I don't know why he's where he's at but he don't need to stay [Applause] there but brother Ron he's a preacher yeah now he can preach Grace like never before now we can talk about a burned out house like never before and you know David stood there on that Ash pile and he started thinking about the promises of God I don't have happened to think that he just stood there and said Hallelujah I'd say he got in such a spot till the spirit the Lord came down on him and all of a sudden those feet were that were so despondence now feels like dancing those hands that were seem to be hanging down now starts feeling like shouting Hallelujah that voice of singing it's no longer cled with negativity now it's singing the Praises of God you know so many times that we think well you know after the victory we'll shout no he already had Victory standing on the ashes are you with me now so tonight I want to make this personal they say I still have stage four cancer they say I we just looked at the the the scans the other day still have tumors in my head on my brain I've got cancers all over my lungs but I want to stand on some ashes here we go here we go and David looked around at the congregation and they were standing on their House's ashes and they saw their leader dancing why don't you just dance on the ashes right now I want to declare to you tonight let tonight be the first day of your Victory let tonight be the night of stepping into your vision sons and daughters are coming home cancers are leaving heart situations is over marriages is coming back together and greater than all that a refilling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is here for you tonight you see they could steal his property they could steal his animals they could steal his wife they can steal his children but they can't steal [Applause] God so many times we in our negative and our in our feeble condition we go well I lost this and I lost that and I lost this but you ain't lost God and the Shadows may be dark in a lot of situations going in your life but just remember you won't always stay there blind baras was not always blind was blind Lazarus was dead was you was a sinner was you what did have a porn habit you did have a negative attitude you was a rebellious child but once you get the Holy Ghost I love it when you realize it when you realize I'm not that man no longer come on you don't need a king no longer you don't need a probation officer no longer you know that you know that you know that you know that you know you met him and you're not that man no longer and I'm never going back I'm never going back I'm never going back Satan is defeated and I'm never going back I'm never going to be a slave to him no longer I'm never going to be a servant to him no longer he don't live here no longer stop on the ashes for a while now when Adam fell that meant the Earth fell when Adam fell that me the whole Animal World fell but it's only a temporary situation God just didn't take the Earth and throw it out into the zillions of miles away he just didn't kill every lion and tiger and bear vulture now they have fallen and they become Predator now they eat one another but God says okay I'm going to redeem the Earth I'm going to go take it back Satan thinks he owns it and God says I'm going to take it back you say well brother Ron how in the world is he going to do that well I'd say Noah's day give us a good example and you may have forgot the story but Noah Builds an ark he don't build it just just for his family he doesn't realize he's building a zoo Noah did not have the time to gather all of those animals but he had stood there and preached a message and believed a message and though that AR didn't look like it would float the message said it would the message said there was coming a storm and he was going to water the Earth cuz God said I'm going to take it back that's right then he came to a certain time in one of his sermons all of a sudden he begin to see creatures coming two by two are you with me God's creatures Amen brother Ron I can't explain it I don't need to explain it I just know it happened God had something on the inside of them that they travel for thousands of miles and step after step they made their way to safety you're going to have to do some walking but you just keep walking cuz you're walking toward safety storm's coming but it ain't for you two by two they gathered you know people begin to make fun and criticize he's preached 120 years about the message it ain't never happen look he's building us a zoo how did he gather all that got to be witchcrafter some way no it was God o d how did they do that God made them in the beginning right and whatever he made he still got control over it and just for a News Bulletin the Satan if he can look back a to that time Lambs lions tigers and bears were on the same Ark none was missing when they got off so God's got an atmosphere if you can get in his ark he's got an atmosphere you travel from all over the Earth to be here in this [Applause] meeting and Satan battles you and battles you and battles you but in this atmosphere all of a sudden you don't hate one another all of a sudden you love one another it's the atmosphere that atmosphere wants to just hover over you he wants to live inside of [Applause] you and God says now just to give you a projected Vision I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also he's talking to guys that are around him that are standing just feet away from him that loves him so much when they get the Holy Ghost in a few days they can't do it at this point but when they get the Holy Ghost in a few days they'll be willing to give their life and when it comes their time to be crucified they'll say Turn me upside down I'm not even worthy to be crucified like my Lord when they drag their head through the street when they cut them aunder when they pull them apart they'll never give up that's right now how many of you just be honest now how many of you have succumbed and felt the urge to quit while you're a preacher's daughter and you feel the urge to quit you're honest you're honest raise your hands back up you felt the urge to quit God didn't make you feel like that temporary situations made you feel like that you felt like you didn't have a friend and you've got thousands of them yeah brother Ron I'm sitting here tonight and I feel so lonely why don't every one of you guys look at one another's go I love you in the love of the Lord hallelujah now if you're sitting with your husband or wife you better do it you guys got back there y y'all go ahead and do it again just for good practice I'm giving you time Satan will make you feel like quitting now let me just clue you in on something Jesus felt like it father let this cup pass from me right he was tempted in all like manner like you and I brother Brandon felt like quitting what do you think he was doing in 62 when he wanted to go up in the mountains he wanted to quit pressure was too much but I got news for you tonight quitting is not in our DNA remember brother Brenham standing over his little girl he wanted to quit but just when he was getting ready to give up something on the inside of him you're not holding on he's holding on when you would give up and when you would quit he's got a hold to you sometimes you just need to turn loose and realize I got you that's right why don't you just raise your hand and say God's got me now you know after you get done dancing on ashes the instruction says pursue you remember yesterday I told you that you were Satan's worst nightmare cuz you're not just going to always stand still amen oh yeah you're not just going to run from the Shadows you're just not going to be timid and shy after you get instructions from him you're going to chase him down you're going to chase it and you're going to chase it and you're going to chase it cuz he's got something that belongs to you you're going to run after him you're not afraid of him cuz greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world he's got something that belongs to you there's going to be some running going on there's going to be some dancing that's going on now Satan in his memory he's stupid I guess that's okay to say he's stupid he's got shortterm memory he forgot you killed a Goliath he forgot you killed a line and you killed a bear and just because you got into a dark spot all of a sudden now you rekindle the fire and you begin to encourage yourself this isn't just a one time encouragement you're going to have to do it over and over and over and over again in your life and all of a sudden his nightmare starts to become alive and he can hear your size eight shoes coming and he could hear the spring in your voice you're not depressed no more you're not defeated no more and before the doctors ever tell you your canc are free you're declaring it before they take you off a Teemo you're declaring it while your back still hurts you're declaring it while your heart's having trouble you're declaring what are you doing you're taking it back let him run let him run you got the energies to go get [Applause] it your prodical can run to the end of the Earth God knows how to go get them they can tell you every disease in the world that's in your body but you got a God that says by his stripes I'm Healed God knows how to fix marriages he knows how to fix relationships he knows how to fix jobs you're fighting depression tonight's a good night to start running you're fighting dark clouds tonight's a good day for the sun to come out in your life you may have a book of excuses of why you haven't been able to do a lot burn the book don't look look back victory is mine victory is mine Victory today is mine I told Satan get

whispering in his ear well look there 600 of them one of you but he hadn't read the scripture that's right that's right the scripture said that one will take a thousand the stupid devil only brought

that list some of you came with habits that you know are not right some of you came with attitudes that you know is not right but you came to the right Hospital in this hospital we have a doctor that fixes every situation if you'll believe if you're honest and you want him to fix it he'll fix every situation there was a prayer line here a few years ago and I was praying and I was getting weak and I was getting weak and I felt like I was going to fall at it in a minute and a voice was saying in my ear wait till Jessica gets here I did not know what her need was I didn't not know who she would be praying for it would be a prayer line that Mariah would get a healing it would be a prayer line to where that I would have a vision of my grandson and see him in a Mickey Mouse shirt with his left hand up in the air walking across the yard to a mom and dad that could not have children could not it was impossible to have children and God showed me a vis of my little baby Isaac where you at man hey come on up here come on up here we might as well Kill Devils while we at it you carried me back to the room you carried me back probably there's times that you wish you hadn't carried me back remember those words as you stand there this guy's a great big guy and I turned to him and said you'll never be the same after this night right you'll be you called to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ I'll never be the same I told him I said just tell the world I'll never be the same I'll never be the same God just didn't make him a a preacher he made him a convention speaker cuz when God does work he does work well you see God knew he would be a preacher and he also knew he would have a heart condition so the same doctor showed up tonight [Applause] on I don't know where you was at but you wasn't with God God was with you but you Wen with God you was an alien from the Commonwealth of God you had been raised in a preacher's home a great preachers home with a great mom the Holy Ghost throughout that home but you was like that Rich Young Ruler you was making choices and they wasn't good and it was taking you further and further and further away from God but God don't give up if you're in the Lamb's Book he don't give up when your mom walked across the platform and we were praying for her God spoke through my lips and said I give you my son I give you my son God's not nervous about where you at prodal he's not worried about where you're at homeless on a street somewhere another doped up somewh another laying with the wrong kind of women God's not nervous about that he sees the end the vision you say brother Ron but God God don't you know maybe he can't touch my need that's the greatest one he can listen that's the same expression of Hatty right that's absolutely the truth brother brandom your cancer is not no greater than that Eternal part sir that broken home is no greater than that part right there if God can do the Eternal works I'm not talking about some temporary situation if you was in the book God never forgot you God don't forget you I don't care about your temporary situation God's got you in his hands the musicians can come if you will now I want to put you in David's shoes just for a moment you're going to leave this building you come back to church tomorrow morning you're going to wear that guy out in the morning preaching to you you're going to pull every bit of ounce of in your with your amens and your Hallelujah cuz you went to the enemy's camp and none of them were too big for your God you went down to the enemy's camp and the enemy was not too strong the enemy couldn't hold you up the enemy didn't steare you no more his fear tactics didn't work anymore you took back what the enemy had stole from you I want to ask you do you believe do you believe do you believe do you believe there's some more of those guys in this building right now there's some more of those guys in this building all right amen how many of you say brother Ron I'm praying for my prodal loved one right now and if God could do it for him yes he'll do it for me Satan's scared right now and I want to speak to him on I was on the run and was 21 years old I'd been raised in the message and I got mixed up in some really bad things and I don't have time to tell you but Satan was destroying my life but there was a blood that had already been applied and there was a Praying Mom and Daddy that believe this message with all their heart and they refuse to give up sister Rachel I'm preaching do you know God don't look at our temporary situations and wash his hands my God don't even know what impossibilities [Music] are you're in a fractured relationship with your mate God can heal that other on it looks impossible for my daughters to come home not with God it'll even be a greater testimony now I come to the last lines of my sermon I was burned and laid in a hospital and the doctors gave up on me and God so healed my lungs he did such a good job job that not even the cancer can destroy the lungs doctors have testified if your lungs wasn't so strong the cancer would have already eat him up the burn was a horrible event what God was making way for the next trial I fell 40 ft and they said I'd never walk again doctor said you may as well convince yourself You'll Never Walk again and I with my words said you don't know who you're talking to from not ever being able to walk again to dance across this pull pit is a wonderful thing but I believe with all my heart I'll come back and preach to you if time should last and give you their testimony yeah the devil took some part of my life come on but I went to the enemy Camp Hallelujah now tonight as you're getting ready to walk through this prayer line tonight with these great

a lot of times we don't make it and my daughter made a promise to me said I'll never go to a camp or be in a meet and and just follow the crowd but I if I go I'll go because I'm sincere I I I really made a start for God so brother Tim at that meeting at Youth Camp you baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'll always be eternally grateful because today my 16-year-old daughter died
