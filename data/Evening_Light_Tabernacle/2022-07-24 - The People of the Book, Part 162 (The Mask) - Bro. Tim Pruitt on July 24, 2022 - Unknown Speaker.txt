lord i pray that you'll just be with us now as we open up the pages of the word of god i pray that you'd also open up our hearts lord that we can receive father with the word there's all kinds of services and teaching and instruction evangelistic ministries and jubilation of services there's all kinds and in your great arsenal of ministry you've got all kinds that you use lord these maybe some are soft-spoken some are maybe very bold and maybe blustery in the way they say things and ones this way and one's another but you use them according to your glory we want to thank you lord for every ministry that is out there and how that you're using them for your glory lord you're not a cookie cutter god but you've got a god you're god a variety and you have a variety of people and even in this church today lord we're all different there's none of us need to feel strange or or weird because that we're different but you made us lord to be the way that we are lord and you're molding us in your purpose and for your plan and i pray that you'll use us today each one of us in a mighty way that you'll give us ears to hear what the spirit has to say in this last day lord there's not many with the here and here that the ears are dull and their their eyes they have closed that they would lord that they could hear with their ears and see with their heart and be converted but lord thank you father we are so thankful to for years to be able to hear we're so thankful lord that not only do we have the ears to hear but you spoke a message particularly to us in our day so that we would not be a part of those that are deceived but we'd be that that called out group that you're going to change in a moment a twinkling of an eye and taking a rapture i pray you'll bless your people lord may they know the presence of the lord is in this place lord oh god may they when they walk out from here today they'd be able to say god met with us in a special way in jesus name amen amen god bless you good to be in the house of the lord today and have each one of you that is assembled with us amen we thank you for the music today and the singing the praises unto the lord and amen isn't god good to give us so many blessings i was thinking of that song there his um goodness is running after me that's the book of psalms chapter 23 and and and the last verse says and surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever aren't you glad to have that promise this morning amen and knowing then that his mercy will follow us his goodness is going after us don't worry about it you've given your heart to god your life belongs to him amen he's never he's never going to reject you or push you away he's just saying come unto me all you that are heavy laden and i will give you rest amen and so we're looking for that rest today amen good to have each one of you here with us we have the hoffman family here over all the way from arkansas and they they tell me uh it's a mother's birthday over there so happy birthday that's wonderful that you could come and share your birthday with us that's um that's that makes it really special to me i remember brother um brother wade came over with his with his new wife sister jule wade they were older couple and they were both widows widows of widowers and got married and and you know fell in love and got married and brother ruby weighed his what was the brother and sister jewel his wife and and they come all the way over here from arkansas and she said brother tim she wanted to go one place for her honeymoon and that was the evening light tabernacle well i'll tell you what i'm not very big but i grew about 10 inches about that time amen and i i tell you that really thrilled my heart there she's a brother ruby has went on to be with the lord but she's a wonderful wonderful saint of god we we love her she would hear this sermon all the way now if she's living in north carolina that the lord will bless her abundantly bless you abundantly today amen we got brother joe ministered brother sean martin's brother aaron uh he's ministering up in newfoundland and um they're coming home this week um brother joe will be home to coming home tomorrow or starting home at least and brother timothy and i we're going to be heading out on wednesday to edmonton and um we'll be preaching the annual meetings there with brother ron spencer and so we will be there god willing for the weekend of services there and so if you remember us in prayer amen i certainly appreciate that we serve a big god and we need him to minister to the hearts of the people without him we can do nothing so we're looking to him and looking to you to pray for us and and just remember the work of god everywhere around the world amen there's many that are listening in from around the world today and we give you greetings wherever you're at and uh you know i we just pray that the lord will minister you in a special way and that you'll be ministered to today from the word let's turn to genesis 18 verse 1. i want to read that today from down to verse 3. and there's just so many wonderful things that lays in the word of god and how we appreciate that so much genesis 18 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord this is very key my lord if i if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant amen god bless you you can be seated i'm going to be speaking today on the mask and so we're going to be looking here into this part of the of this service and this revelation that god has given us remember what we have read is not just a page in the bible that is history but it is prophecy and so we are here in the in the very fulfilling of this prophecy so actually when jesus took the bible and he opened the book and he opened it to isaiah 61 and he said he said the spirit of the lord is upon me for he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor and to bind up the broken heart and so on that jesus actually turned to the place that he was in the scripture what we're doing today is we're looking in the bible and we're looking to see ourself because it is about us it is a revelation of jesus christ and his church so now as we look at this we see abraham is sitting in the tent door and he is watching for his appearing now i think this is very important when we come to a service even like this or even even every day in our daily life we should be watching for his appearing there should be a certain expectation uh you know not not just to treat this as another denominational church service and we do our religious duties that's not what this is about if we if that's what it's about we just might as well stay in some denominational system but you see god has called us out for a purpose and that is a that is that he is appearing to his people in the last day so we should come with every service with anticipate anticipation for the lord's appearing now he may appear in one service and it may be a jubilant service and we dance the owls and we shout and we scream or he may appear again and it be very sobering and very serious and dealing deeply with the soul and and and you may be you may sat in your your pew weeping or he may he may appear and it be instruction and you're not shouting at all about it but you're you're you're learning and you're into being instructed in the knowledge of god so you see there's not just one way that god appears so we but we are look we should look for his appearing every service and have an expectation that god is going to speak something very clearly and precise to us today because we are his bride his people and he is here to fellowship with us and to speak to us things concerning himself you know what he's doing is whispering the love secrets like a man and a a boy and a girl that are that is going together and they're sitting close and they're whispering to each other their love secrets and sharing the the very intimate desires and thoughts of their hearts amen now so you see they're learning about us and we've got to know our bridegroom before that we go to the meeting in the air so these are things in his appearing that he does now abraham is sitting in the tent door and he is watching for his appearing now of course sarah is in the tent now that she's also the church so you know there are there are some that are watching and some that are maybe they're just waiting maybe they don't even know what they're waiting on maybe they haven't got connected yet but i want to say this even if you're out of step today that does not make you non-bride amen listen to the voice of the prophet of god saying get back in line get back in step so you see i mean there there's always that for you that is calling you you know never take the word of god as condemnation always take it on the positive side when you read the bible i'm not a judas though it's in the bible amen i'm not a balaam though he's in the bible i'm not the great in the book of revelation though that's in the bible that's not who we are we look in the word to identify who we are as the sons and daughters of god and we take that part for ourselves now now of course brother branham as a typologist he always referred to abraham as a type of the bride and paul did the same i'd like to turn with you to galatians 3 16 and and we'll just put it clearly now why abraham is so important now to abraham and his seed word the promises made he said not unto seeds as of many but as a one into thy seed which is christ so so to abraham and christ the seed were the promises made amen so it was made to abraham and jesus now go down to verse 29 and if you be christ and it belongs to him then you are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so now if you be christ then dave you've been born to him that you are abraham's seed and you are heirs of this promise so we're looking here in genesis 18 to see what we are air to it's like going into a variety store and you and somebody gave you the whole store where you're going in there and look and see what all we got amen we just walk in there we look and we climb up on a stepladder if it's out of reach and we get up a little higher with god and we look in there and we see but we're going to receive everything that god has for us amen because we are heirs according to the promise now so brother branham would preach many many sermons on abraham he would mention abraham in almost every sermon there's probably not a sermon that he preached that he don't mention abraham and but there there would be very few because abraham the promise is to him and to his seed which is christ and if we be christ then we are abraham's seed so the promise then is ours and we are heirs according to the promise now this is this was really important to the galatians who were gentile people and they were trying to cram down them the law and tell them they had to have circumcision and go back to judaism and and paul come along and said no he said you are abraham's seed and you are you are alienated and away from god but you are abraham's seed because you have been born again all israel is not israel amen so there's a natural seed and there is a royal seed and you happen to be the royal seed of abraham so therefore every promise that was abraham's is christ and every promise that was christ is yours so that makes you an error and a joint heir with him now abraham just quoting a few things that brother madam has to say about him abraham is a perfect type of the true believer so if you want to know what kind of believer you are go back to abraham amen who was a believer who is washed into the lamb whose affections was set on things above and then he says abraham is a perfect type of abraham seed after him in the church a people out of the gentiles for his name the royal sea now you're going to see in the in this study and this and this it's it's preach teaching uh teaching and preaching that there are three groups or classes of people that are represented here in this genesis story and because genesis is the seed chapter so whatever you find in its infancy there in seed form is going to be in maturity in the end time so it will be magnified and come to multiple harvests so for the seed chapter that there are three groups or classes of people represented here one number one is abraham and abraham represents the elected called out church so the elected called out church is in the book of genesis and then two lot the church's natural who goes through the tribulation so you find him also in the book of genesis and then the sodomites who are the cannon fodder for the burning they are also in the book of genesis so three classes of people abraham lot and sodomites and now so you you have you have there um you have those those three kinds right here all the way to the end time now again abraham was a type of the caught the church called out wasn't in sodom he was sitting way back on the barren grounds of the mountains above the riches and the cares of the world there's your three classes abraham called out the and the word church means called out abraham the elected church we know there's an elected church we know that god predestinated the church it's going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle this is why when god looks back at it through the blood of the new testament he says abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief it never mentions his failures it never mentions his faults the blood has totally annihilated all of his sins are you with me amen so abraham we know he is the elected church we know god predestinated that church he and here he he types it out in the bible before we ever get here he uses abraham to live out the mystery of the bride in the end time now so there's that elected church going to be there without spot or wrinkle he said so and we know we're a member of it how do we get a member of it by dying to yourself and being born again so if you're born of the spirit of god then you are the seed of abraham abraham himself which is the type of the church it was the last sign he received so where we're at right here in genesis 18 is the last sign before the body change the last appearing of god before the rapture and that's where we're at we are in the last appearing of god god is appearing now remember there's a difference between his coming and his appearing he when he comes that's the meeting in the air but he is appearing now in in among his people are you with me now so abraham which is the type of the church it was the last sign that he received for all the other signs that he received was the last one before sodom was wiped out so before the burning before the before the the millennial reign we are receiving the last sign in fact of the matter is we are that last sign now abraham abraham is the seer the seer in the bride church remember genesis 20 and 7. now therefore restore the man his wife he says to abimelech for he is a prophet this is the first time prophet is mentioned in the bible and abraham is god's prophet notice he is representing the bride church in the end time who will have a seer prophet and it will be that seer prophet that sees and recognizes and identifies his appearing now notice here and he is in the tip door anticipating and watching for god's appearing so he's not just gifted you know to heal the sick and and cast out devils and and uh and and just preach some nice sermons no he's a seer he's a prophet messenger god's prophet would be in the last day in the bride church in the abraham church and when we think about abraham think of a church a bride elect church not just one person see abraham isn't brother branham my brother branham is in abraham brother branham was just a part of the bride church and abraham and sarah are representing the bride church and all his encounter and and of course there are those that went along with him for the ride you know they also believed in jesus and also believed in calvary and and they also you know went along because abraham said god was real and and whatever you see and and he comes along that's lot and they go through the tribulation so there is a church and there is a bride now so in this end time event this abraham the abraham the true church has a seer in it he has prophetic eyes the eyes of his prophet catches god's appearing and in disappearing is a revelation of deity oh a revelation of who god is now i want you to get it where we're at because we are in one of the greatest unfoldings of deity that the world has ever seen now in this and even though that abraham sees three men that suddenly appeared beside him but as a prophet by revelation he knew that there was just one of them that was the lord so his first and foremost revelation is that there is one lord amen now turn with me to genesis 18 and 2 and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo and three men stood by him and he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord he sees three men but he only addresses one amen amen there is no greater revelation than the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ it is the foundational revelation that the church is built upon who jesus is now the greatest of all revelations is the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ there is absolutely no greater revelation than that so to begin with the prophet gets what the revelation of one lord one jehovah are you with me and so in the revelation of jesus is also the revelation of the bride of christ and all other unfolding revelations of church ages seven seals is all encapsulated in the revelation of the person of jesus christ because it's all a revelation of him so you can't even get to first base unless you believe in the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ amen now listen don't act like this is all ho-hum this ought to be something that you rejoice in that you're not like the sodomites you're not even like what amen when he saw something come he said my lords but when abraham saw him come he said my lord is that right amen here not like the church this actually identifies you as the people of the book and when you're the people of the book there isn't but one god not multiple deities or two lords or one god and jesus is just a man and all the other ideas that have come out listen friends it's it in in this in this revelation to abraham for just a few hours in time the eternal god puts on a mask of flesh to appear before abraham and this was a revelation of one god to abraham no matter how many manifestations that abraham saw and there was still one god never never was there more than one god it never was in his mind that there's more than one god amen he said here oh israel the lord thy god is one lord and there's only one lord one jehovah that's what he said hero israel the lord thy god is one jehovah amen so you see the lord thy god this this is the bible that is being preached hero israel the lord our god is one lord that is that is junior romantic six and four and this is the earliest introduction of god to the human race where god is unfolding himself and he makes it known israel know this here's the first commandment here's the first thing i want you to know hero israel the lord thy god is one lord one jehovah there's not more than one there's only one amen that's the first commandment and jesus confirmed that was the truth and the church of jesus christ is built on that truth god is one jehovah not two or three jehovah's in fact there is there is no such thing as two or three jehovah's and there's no such thing as one or as as two or three lords amen one lord one faith one baptism one god amen listen we to be abraham's seed we got to be a one god people preaching a one god bible amen a one lord truth are you with me now now mark 12 29 jesus answered him the first of all commandments here it is the very first foremost revelation of god is hero israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all that mind and with all that strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thus that love thy neighbor is myself there is none other commandment greater than these so these are the greatest commandments amen now so how can you love the lord your god with all your heart and then cut him up and make him three how can you truly love the lord jesus and dissect him and deny his deity and say he was just a man the true revelation of his presence would never question the deity of jesus christ amen now so note the appearing to abraham's royal seed in the last day here are prophetic eyes looking out of the door of the church as abraham was watching from the tent door and he has this epiphany he has a manifestation a divine presence he has a moment of sudden revelation or insight now listen now here we come down to the end time and the prophet messenger whose name ended like abraham's with h.a.m are you with me has seven letters like abraham and was seeking divine revelation he was on watch for the appearing and i want you to understand he's going to be the eyes of the seer that catches his appearing and the revelation is going to come first to the prophet so it comes to the church but it comes to the seer first remember even the message to laodicea is to the messenger to the messenger of laodicea write these things so you see he would write it to the messenger to the angel of the church the messenger who would give the message to the people that's why it was important in this day to have a prophet messenger because we're here in the last age where it's very very important for for someone to catch god's appearing in the last days otherwise you totally miss out on what god is doing now you know it wouldn't it wouldn't have took very much sleep it wouldn't take too much closing of the eyes it wasn't a catch it took too much not enough for abraham to miss the appearing but he was watching he was looking he was anticipating revelation he was realizing this is the last day this is the last age this is the last times and we must have the full word restored or there's not going to be a bride going to rapture so he's looking for the appearing now watch brother adam talked about this in message of grace with his eye caught the appearing and he said i looked again and there it was growing taller and taller three rainbows now notice once again the prophetic eye sees this and when he sees it he don't make three gods out of these rainbows he knows there's one god and he says i took off my hat and i set down my gun and i started walking towards it with my hands up and it see just something seemed to tell me this is close enough and i was going to sit down and take my boots off that i had on see if i could walk a little closer but when i got within a few yards of it i seen the color of it misting like a fog moving around and i stood still a few moments and it was coming right out of the top of the little mountain and as i watched as these three one to the right one to the left one in the center running down into a bowl like whatever what it was was alive it was moving it was making motions and i stood there it was gray and dawn i just want to stop here and say what an appearing what an amazing appearing the pillar of fire coming down and manifests itself and and the colors like a rainbow and three rainbows they're coming up out of one little bowl like a fair at the top of the mountain and i looked again and i screamed out oh god what would you have your servant know and just then the spear of the lord came in and said jesus of the new testament is jehovah of the old he only changed his mass from spirit to man that was confirming of course my message of him let me know assured that these 31 years hadn't been in vain hallelujah so again there was the spirit of the lord coming in and what was the revelation when he saw it it disappearing he saw the revelation was jesus of the new testament is jehovah of the old reminds me of when one day i had a man come up you know a couple had a couple of men come up because he comes for two and they were jehovah's witness and then knocked on my door and i invited the man and he said well most people just turn us away won't invite us in well i said well i'm not afraid of anything you got come on in so i sat down for a few moments and he said i said so you are jehovah's witness he said yeah yeah that's what we are i said yeah i'm jehovah's witness too oh yeah yeah yeah we're all witnesses of jehovah aren't we aren't we you know he just kind of brushed it off i said no no no i'm you misunderstand i'm a real jehovah's witness i said because jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new. you know you know they didn't get nowhere that day and about a month later they brought a whole team about 12 people back with all of their with their big teacher from little rock and he was going to show them how to put somebody like me in their place and when they left my house they dusted their clothes off amen they didn't get anywhere because it's just like this all you have to do is stand right there at that hole where the rabbit gets out he's got to come right back there amen and there is where our revelation is that jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new it was only god changing his mask so here god comes to abraham with a mask on he has taken cosmic light and dust and potassium whatever and he's re and he's there he molded and made himself a body and he stepped in it and it's gonna have some fellowship amen he's going to have some fellowship with abraham that he's going to do the same in this end time except this time he uses redeemed bodies to reveal himself and have fellowship with a bride in this last day aren't you glad to be a part of abraham's group amen that class of people so he said when i saw them rainbows about as wide across as that halo is of the angel lord and there were three of them running into one how it helped my heart to know that god that jesus is not just a man as people think he is amen he are just a prophet as this modern idea today that thinks jesus was just a prophet he is jehovah of the old testament made flesh and dwelt among us and and there that sure did comfort me and then thinking on that subject he said now there there's a group of people calls himself oneness or jesus only i don't agree with them and their theory neither i did agree with the trinitarian group that says that there are three different gods the extreme of the trinitarian but i believe that the three father son and holy ghost is one that they are three offices of one god he lived in the fatherhood in the pillar of fire he lived in the sonship in jesus christ he now lives it he lives now in the holy ghost in his church so guess where he's going to appear at he's going to appear in your flesh and my flesh because that's where he's appearing in this last day not in a body that he created out here of cosmic light and potassium whatever steps into it nor in the body that he created made in the womb of mary but a bride that he has created hallelujah by the word birthing the bride into existence so that god could come down and have fellowship with his people hallelujah now so the same lord jesus that was made flesh and dwelt among us is with us this day among us in the form of the holy spirit and all the experiences when i turned and seen it thinking first it could be the sun beat through a cloud somewhere but it was before the sun rose and when i turned back and seen it wasn't a light it was a rainbows and i looked and seen it i became numb all over and someone said to me do you feel like shouting no he said i didn't feel like shouting those experiences never make you feel like shouting they just make you feel anchored just word that you know there's something that tells you just a satisfied thing amen now you see a service like this you may not jump up and shout and run the aisles but it ought to just give you an anchor a real satisfied feeling that god appearing among us is by revelation revealing himself hallelujah not as one of three gods or one of three persons or not not jesus as a a minor god nor jesus as just merely a man but jesus the almighty now he tells you accounts a second time and let your light so shine before men said i go to the mountains friends it isn't so much to go hunting i'm going there to get alone with god so again he's looking for the appearing some of you notice my greatest experience as i have is when i'm out hunting when i meet god out of all my experiences i never had one like i had the other morning right up going squirrel hunting i i've seen many things in my life signs and wonders and so forth but that struck me stronger than anything i've had yet oh i pray it strikes us today just imagine just about to break a day rainy solid cloudy all over see me see it standing in front of me rising up like from like a couple and sitting on a hill sitting there three rainbows rising higher and higher until you're so numb to you could hardly speak and then walk closer and hear him speak and confirm the very message that you're preaching to be the truth said jesus of the new testament is jehovah of the old he just changed his veil well i said studying that and i find out that the very sad the same word that he changed his countenance in the in the greek did mean change in his mask not exactly his veil but his mouth it come to the place he was transformed that means he changed his way he was jehovah god and jehovah god jehovah changed himself from spirit and became a man and he's the same jehovah god which was the father and this is the son being the same person so there's not three persons of god after all here are there amen now abraham had this epiphany paul had this same sudden appearing that brought revelation to him so here abraham has an epi epiphany and paul gets the same epiphany he has the same revelation there is an appearing to paul the prophet of the first age to make him know for sure before he got started on anything who jesus is because it is the foundational fundamental truth that we that the church is built upon and when they're built solid upon that the gates of hell will not prevail against it amen now let me tell you something friends you can find fault with brother branham's character you can try to assassinate his character you can say this and this and this about it but what we are preaching and what we believe is not about him it's about who jesus is and in jesus is the seals and jesus is the mystery in jesus is everything and jesus is a bride you are in jesus and jesus is in you and because of that i don't care what they say they can come up with every kind of accusation against the prophet of god but i this revelation is who jesus is and when he made known to who jesus is he may know to me who i am hallelujah because that's what he did to peter when peter got the revelation of who jesus was and he said and i say unto you that thou art peter you're a stone too amen and on this rock amen i'm going to build my church and i'm going to start with the foundation of apostles and prophets with jesus christ being the first cornerstone all right so on this foundation i'll build my church now when you are built there solidly in the message in the bible the gates of hell cannot prevail against you that's why these stains none of these things move me none of the conflict none of the arguments none of the things i just say this to some of them out there what have you got better to offer me than what i got it changed my life it saved my soul it put holiness in the church come on amen it took out sin and ungodliness it gave me a happy wonderful marriage it gave me four wonderful children and many grandchildren amen it gave me a church full of believers whose i'm not going and cleaning after them all the time and changing their diapers but because they've got a hold of the rock that they're build upon amen they don't have to be bottled and cared for like that but they can be adult sons and daughters of god who know how to believe when crisis arise paul got the same revelation that's what he that brought him in his epiphany he was a jew and he was acquainted with the pillar of fire he had heard about it amen it had been the very thing that had led his people out of egypt they followed this pillar of fire and when he saw that pillar of fire when the appearance came to paul he asked the question who art thou lord now the first revelation paul gets is who jesus is now you know a lot of you come to christ and you know you think it's all about me and lord i'm the sinner and i'm this and it's my problems that that's not the revelation you you get the revelation who jesus is when you know him is life understand that get your eyes on jesus you get your eyes on yourself and your faults and your problems and how bad a sinner you have been and what you you'll never get salvation look at jesus he is savior if he can't save you who can it's impossible for you to be saved without him so go ahead and get that verse revelation who jesus is he's almighty god and when he says you're forgiven you are forgiven when he pardons you you are pardoned your sins and your iniquities i'll remember them no more now this is paul he's on the road to damascus he meets the pillar of fire he has an epiphany he's cheese he sees the appearing of the lord and here he appears as a pillar of fire and him being a jew he knew that was god so he said who art thou lord and he he knew him as lord but who are you and the voice came back from the pillar of fire and said i am jesus and it's hard for you to kick against the priests now from that time on paul knew that the jehovah of the old testament was the jesus of the new. this is why he could preach the godhead and all the other revelations because it all began with that foundational truth now brother branham tells us in voice of the sign and what's it the sign has a voice so again you know the that's what he was trying to make clear there's a message that is coming with a sign the sign was showing your name is so-and-so and you're from so and so and discerning the heart like it did in sarah in the tent behind him right amen so that was a sign but there was a voice with design and the voice is making known first god's deity all right same way with paul he had the sign you believe he was a prophet so what kind of sign did he see a pillar of fire amen and on the road to damascus you know jesus had died crucified and rose and descended into heaven paul's on his road to damascus when a great light struck him down and he says lord who are you and he said i'm jesus then he was told you're a chosen vessel i'll tell you when he reveals to you who he is you are from then on a chosen vessel actually you were chosen before that but you come to realize you were chosen hallelujah no notice what did paul had the rest of them didn't have he had abundance of revelation of the word of god because but it was paul who recognized that jesus in the new testament was the jehovah of the old testament and brother brandon says hallelujah i could say something here he had a revelation of he wrote it and revealed it because god permitted it to be added to the bible and the word only comes by the bible by the prophet so then god revealed to paul he wrote the letters inspired god put them in the bible oh my revealed christ that he is christ of the old testament because he met him he couldn't understand how that pillar of fire was that one that led this people out of egypt that one that had been with the hebrews all down to the age and here he is he's seen him and he said lord what is it you want with me i'm jesus and he's seen this one that had led his people that moses met that i am the ever present the same yesterday today and forever was now manifested in the flesh and it was his revelation and he added above all the others because he saw him after his death burial resurrection and ascension and then he had descended in the holy ghost and it was appearing to the people in the form of a pillar of fire and in this appearing he's revealing i am jesus amen now because of this great revelation of course to keep him humble the messenger of satan was allowed to buffet him but what he do to his revelation now i want to quote this from brother branham his revelation then was a prophecy for today think of that it was a voice coming forth wrote in the bible to be vindicated today again hallelujah is the voice being vindicated again what he wrote because he was god's prophet revealing the sign was speaking of something so you see the voice of the sign revealed to paul that the jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new and of course that was a prophecy that in the last day there would be an omega people who would get the same revelation again now so the end time messenger is to the last stage we'll have to preach the same that paul preached amen before brother branham preaches the church ages before his first sermon of the series and he begins it he begins it with the revelation of jesus christ so i want you to understand as the mysteries begin to break it begins with the revelation of jesus christ because from that revelation all the others are going to burst forth and if you don't get that one right you're not going to get the rest of it right and if you get confused come back to this truth amen now so the end time messenger his first sermon as the word is being revealed to him the church ages are being made no it's messenger the first sermon he preaches is the revelation of jesus christ and he preaches in that sermon of the supreme deity of the lord jesus christ make it known that jesus is no mere prophet but the god prophet no mere man but the god man no junior god but the almighty god so let's go to the beginning of revelation where everything starts unfolding because the book of revelation is our book it was it was written it was written even after apostle paul was dead and john's on the isle of patmos and god leaves this righteous and simple form and so much of it is in symbol because it's not to be made known until the appearing in the last day and then they appear in the last day there'll be a prophet sitting in the tent in the church watching for that appearing to reveal these mysteries so that it would no longer be symbol because it wasn't needed for them but it's needed for you so the book of revelation is your book so now you're in the alpha book book of genesis and now you're over here in the omega book the book of revelation and when you get down to the book of revelation in many ways it's about two women it's about a spotless bride and an awful think of that and so in that last of that book he's going to reveal things to this last age that the other ages wasn't privy to know and the reason for it is in the last ages the age of his coming where the appearing will will move into his coming this will be the climax of the appearing when we meet him in the air so it begins with abraham revealing to him the mysteries and to him he sees there is one lord and begins with that foundational truth and now he'll understand what happens with lot he'll have what happens to sodomite he'll understand what his promise of his change of sarah's new name of his name all of these mysteries are truths that are laying there and disappearing now so the end time messenger will have to preach the same thing that paul does so he comes there and he starts because it's prophesying the alpha church has to also be the same as the omega church right i said that backwards the omega church has to be the same as alpha church because he is alpha and omega so revelation 1 8 it starts right here in the book of revelation 1 8 i am alpha and omega so the first thing god wants to do in the revelation of jesus christ is make known who he is i am alpha and omega i am the beginning and the ending i was in genesis and i'll be in revelation i was in the first time in the first age in the sea chapter and i'll be there in the harvest time i am alpha omega the beginning the end and saith the lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty now if he was reading this in your red letter bible you would see this is jesus saying this he is saying i am alpha and omega i am the beginning and the indian saint the lord i am that which was which is which is which was and which is to come in other words the same yesterday which was which is today and forever which is to come the almighty i'm the same yesterday today and wherever i am the almighty remember if you miss that key that he is the same in every detail except his mask his corporal body if you miss that truth that understanding then you miss who jesus is and what he's doing now brother branham tells us in the revelation of jesus christ remember this is what he's preaching revealing jesus christ and he says what is he trying to put before the church he's trying to show his deity today they want to make him a prophet he's more than a prophet and some people try to make him three gods he's not three gods he is one god that lived in three offices are three manifestations of the same god remember this is a book of revelation and it and he said whosoever heareth it and don't keep the saying of this book his part will be taken from the book of life so brother branham is warning us there he said the book of revelation once if you do not hear and keep these sins you see you've got to keep the godhead straight if you mix it up your part's taken out of the book of life you're identified with either lord or the sodomites all right so now jesus not revealing himself as three god but one god in three offices and then that evening he takes the patmos vision where john's on the isle of patmos and he's talking about the appearing of god to john and john is described he's writing down his appearing and this is going to be prophetical because his appearance prophetical of the appearing in the last day remember it's all prophecy and you are the interpretation amen now this morning said we took the supreme deity of the revelation of jesus christ who god revealed to him as supreme deity the great i am not i was or will be i am always notice in the first chapter of revelation what's the revelation of jesus christ what is the first thing he reveals himself here as the god of heaven not a triune god but one god one god he reveals himself the same same way in the first of the of revelation and it and it speaks it four times in the first chapter so that there will not be a mistake the first thing you got to know that he is not a prophet he's not a junior god he's not a secondary god he is god so that's the first thing you've got to know who is disappearing it's god appearing now four times in the in the first chapter he does this so you don't miss it the prelude to all the other revelations i don't want you to miss this this is the key it is the key of revelations revelation 1 4 john to the seven church churches which are in asia grace me unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and then verse eight i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty and then verse 11 i am alpha and omega the first and the last what the seals write in a book send it to the seven churches which are in asia to ephesus smyrna pergamus tytara philadelphia to laodicea to the end of the ages you see he will be the first and the last the alpha for you young people that means alpha is the first letter of the greek alphabet omega is the last so he says i am first and i am the last and at the end aged by the prophet seventh messenger that seer amen god will be known as the omega in the beginning he was the alpha in the end he's omega but whatever he was in the beginning that's what he is in the end who he was in the beginning is the same that he is i am the lord thy god that changes not amen now so we can put that principle to everything if it's healing we know we need that whatever he was yesterday he's the healer today amen for salvation that we need amen he is savior today whatever he was is what he is whatever his attitude was toward the sick 2 000 years ago is his attitude toward you that are sick this morning he is the healer of all diseases he was willing to make stripes for you your punishment so that by those punishments you could be healed verse 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and i have the keys of hell and death so the first book of the bible the alpha book begins like this genesis 1 1 in the beginning god so he's the beginning and then the gospels begin with saint john bringing it out the beginning of john brings it like this in the beginning was the word so you see the last book of the bible the omega book now look it begins like this revelation revelation 1 1. watch now hear the last book of the bible first book of the bible begins like this in beginning god the first of the gospels begin like this in the beginning was the word they met the last book of the bible begins like this the revelation of jesus christ for jesus christ is the revelation of god now so in the in the pakmas vision there's one standing forth and his voice is like a trumpet in disappearing he knows someone is coming now remember this is all is appearing that we're preaching about and in this appearing there's there's a trumpet that is sounding a voice like a trumpet and it's somebody approaching it's a great one approaching somebody's coming hallelujah and he says i am alpha and omega the first and the last notice he's not announcing a second party or third party but the only party amen before i show you anything he says i want you to know i'm alpha and omega and i will before i show you anything i want you to know who i am so the greatest of all revelations is the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ amen you can't get first base until you believe that repent if you repent you'll see the deity amen come on if you repent you'll receive the gift of the holy ghost repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of sin know who it is that the deity that you're being baptized in his name so you repent you can't get the first base as a christian without first repenting of your sins and then repenting of your sins you'll see the deity you'll receive the gift of the holy ghost are you with me now so in and and you will take on the name of jesus christ or the name of the deity that you are worshiping hallelujah that's why we baptize in his name because there is no salvation in any other name than the name of jesus christ so the first thing you've got to know even as a christian is the the deity of christ i'm alpha and omega i am a to c there's no more but me i was at the beginning i'll be at the end he that was which is shall come the almighty amen that's what the trumpet is announcing as the appearance begins we're talking about revelation 1. so you know john is entered into the spirit i was in the spirit on the lord's day what was happening he was going to something was going to be revealed to him and he says the trumpet sounds i'm off and omega first of all revelation first thing that he lets him know that approaching his king jesus amen i just king jesus or king god or king father or king holy ghost i'm all of it i am i'm a to z i'm the beginning and the ending i'm the immortal the eternal one this is what he's saying now so watch him now you know all the way down through as as he reveals himself in the in this now that we come down to just before the last age and then the philadelphian age he comes and he says he he begins to reveal himself again in in the alpha church in the omega church in the omega church he reveals the supreme deity of christ in the alpha church in the omega church he's going to do the same thing so look right here in revelation 3 and 7 as we approach the last age look what he says and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things say that he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth no man shouted to shutteth and no man over there i knoweth thy words behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it so he says right here right here now i'm sitting before you just as they entered into the last church age before the last churches dawns or opens he said it is a door open and this open door is going to be is going to be this a door that no man can shut i want you to know the revelation of jesus christ the gates of hell cannot prevail against it i want you to understand that that the truth of the godhead there's not enough devils in hell that will ever be able to shut the door to that truth because he said when i open it no man touch it and now the truth of god has been lost down to the ages but he promises it will be restored in the last age by opening the door who is the door christ is that door so open up who he is the revelation of who he is so the last age gets the revelation hallelujah and in that revelation all mysteries are revealed and finished up to produce a bride in the last day of people created by the word of god hallelujah so that open door is this is the revelation of the supreme deity not being the second person of the trinity but god himself made flesh and dwelling among us and let me say again nobody can shut this door once he opens it to the elect the elect will not be deceived oh you might fool them for a while but once god opens the door revelation no man can shut it somebody else can come along and feed you sermon after sermon you know of two lords and two jehovah's and three three gods and ephedra sermon after sermon or that but let me tell you if god ever opened the door of revelation to you you'll never be able to stomach that stuff you'll sit there and say huh i can't figure out what he's saying where is he going with this what's he saying about that i don't know where that means because as he left you cannot be deceived amen a warning buzzer goes off and lets you know that's wrong now think of this men have tried to make jesus one of the three persons of a trinity of gods but there is one lord one faith one baptism look how the church is divided along this line you see this divides the church and the elect group so in his first chapter of revelation he reveals his supreme deity because his church is going to be built upon the divine revelation of himself that's matthew 16 18 remember he says on this rock i'll build my church his whole church is built on the revelation of himself now you know a lot of people have taken it the catholics said it was built upon peter so he was the first pope and then the protestants said no it was on christ because that's who it's built it's on the revelation of who jesus is so the church is built on that revelation of god now and when you're built there the gates of hell can never prevail against you that's why i said you repent you see the deity amen you receive the holy ghost you're baptized in his name you receive the holy ghost then the gates of hell will not prevail against you i'll tell you what if i can get our young people if we can get our young people filled with the holy ghost you'll never have to worry about pornography you'll never have to worry about fornication you'll never have to worry about drinking and smoking because when their faith when they are built on that revelation of who jesus is hallelujah and the first thing all you ought to know he's my god he's not my daddy's god he's not my neighbor's god he's not just their god he's my god my lord god is jehovah and only him will i serve so you see it's the supreme deity of jesus christ and no one can stop that message no one can not it can stop that message of the supreme deity in baptism in the name of jesus christ the gates of hell will never prevail against it that's why i say some of you question the message some people are maybe you're listening to me today and your question the message go back to the rock go back to the foundational stone go back who is jesus you know once you get that revelation you can never swallow three gods again you can never go with two lords again you can never go and just make jesus like the jehovah's witness and the and the and the um the the others do the mormons do that just makes him a minor minor god an elder brother but not truly god you'll never do it you can never do it you can never go back you'll give you go back to the rock that's what we're preaching on this this morning go back to the rock the foundational truth of who jesus is now see when the angel comes in the last day he has to have the same message paul had if he comes along and he preaches something different he's accursed is that right so he'll preach the baptism in jesus name he'll preach one god not two or two lords amen and you know again he'll preach circumcision of the heart he'll preach divine miracles he will he'll preach divine workings workings of power like they had on the day of pentecost the very original blessed pentecostal blessing will come back to that little remnant to take it up yonder hallelujah that's what the last messenger will do he will be an omega messenger like paul was an alpha now jesus said he'd have a church that that the revelation that was built on revelation now the great main revelation i'm just going this again always is who jesus christ is the book of revelation which is a revelation of jesus christ opens the same way showing the deity of jesus christ his supreme deity it's the first of all revelations now watch in this last day appearing now john when he is appearing he he sees him and he says see seven spirits before his throne right seven angels we come to this last day and seven angels was his wig representing the seven spirits of god which is just seven manifestations of the one holy spirit amen of the spirit of god for every age and here we see a cloud in the skies and it's showing when it's turned right when it's turned right what does it do it shows us what uh there that he is christ is veiled with a cloud amen and that white cloud was his wig with the angels being his wig come on now what was this doing now it was showing us now the supreme deity of jesus christ and that's what brother branham said when when he saw that he said i saw that wig he's supreme judge look at this like the judges in england or our older judges you know might be a young man that's a judge but before he sat on on the on the judgment seat he put on a wig he put on a mask a wig and when that wig was white and it was showing age and showing authority god was showing to you in the heavens the supreme authority of his word hallelujah and this supreme deity that his supreme judge are you with me he said he is supreme judge there is none other about him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth this is the truth and making him not a third person but the only person amen again he talks about this and the what's attraction on the mountain he said see the supreme deity supreme deity no other voice no other god no other nothing in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily and the angels themselves was his wig brother branham preaches a sermon of christ is the mystery of god revealed remember the mystery of god is christ so when he preaches he said it's one god expressed in three attributes to be father to be savior to be a son to be healer his expressions god expressed in jesus christ who was who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now i'm happy to announce this part now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church all that god was he poured into the church and all that christ was was poured into christ and all that christ was is poured in the church the believers so jesus was not the second person of god he was the person of god who is jesus christ he is the full manifested god that's who he is the the church is built upon that rock the full manifestation of god not a father son holy ghost and him being the second person but on this rock of who he is amen a revelation of jesus christ note the bride church is built on that rock that revelation of who jesus is the revelation of christ of who christ is then is our foundational stone that the church is built upon amen and anointed once at the end time he said i was talking to a gentleman a christian scholar a gentleman mr branham we refuse all revelation i said then you have to refuse jesus christ for he is the revelation of god god revealed in human flesh unless you see it you're lost jesus said except you believe i am he you will die in your sins he is the revelation of god the spirit of god revealed in human form if you believe that if you can't believe that you're lost you put him a third person second person or any other person beside god you are lost except you believe i am he you'll die in your sins now you see why this is so important and you see now why the devil wants to get you off that rock because if he can get you on that rock that's where he has off that rock he'll have you defeated now as god's prophet he unveils that god so he preaches a sermon the unveiling of god remember we're talking about the appearing the epiphany and in the appearance he's going to unveil that god this is what abraham does he looks out and he sees three men but he only knows there's only one god all right now in the unveiling of god brother branham said jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new testament he's the same god just changing form and i said a baptist minister out in tucson said how can you say that jesus and god would be the same person he said well it's easy if you let your own thinking get away and think bible terms of it they are the self-same being god is a spirit jesus is the body he was dwelled in or he was veiled in so he goes on and explains that whole thing you know you know he said many want to say oh he was a jew he said he wasn't a jew he wasn't a gentile he was neither jew or gentile he was a created being by the hand of almighty god god created the the tabernacle he lived in that we know is the son of god that's right the deity supreme deed of jesus christ because god dwelt in him amen so you see all of these truths once we know that truth the gates of hell are against that restored truth but it shall not prevail against it now we've had creatures or men with their own thinking they put in it and they want to reduce jesus what in the world is wrong that anybody would want to reduce jesus christ to just a mere man that would want to deny his deity what kind of a spirit is that that has to be a devil that cannot be god god made the saint jesus both lord and christ are you with me amen so here we come right down to it the truth of godhead is that there's one supreme one eternal being known as the father and he manifested or made himself known in flesh why do why is he called the son because the eternal spirit father the body by creation father the body which we called the son because he came from the father and then the father came and dwelt in him what's so hard to understand about that it's exactly what happened in the days of abraham god made himself a body and came and dwelt in it walked right down to abraham and he called him lord come on church amen that's what he did then that's what he did in jesus christ the only difference was he started the life in mary's womb and then all the minerals and vitamins and everything else and the calcium in the pot gathered around the seed that god had put in there from the from the eating of mary and she took this food and that and made a body but then god came and dwelt in that body amen so god fathered a body that's what he did there in the days of abraham he was the author of that body and he comes and walks among men now he does the same he only did that for less than less than 12 hours i don't know it was long enough for sarah for them to kill a calf and skin it and cook it and sara to make bread and you know get old granny sarah out of the tent and get her to knead and bread and all of that you know it took a little while after all she was 90. are you with me so just a small window of time in abraham's day but in the days of jesus it was 33 years that that body walked on the earth and god came and dwelt in him you look at the miracles it was done it wasn't the flesh that did that flesh can't do that flesh can't create it was the father he said it's not me that did the work it's my father that dwelleth in me he's the one living through me doing these things what's now so you see you see he manifests himself made himself known in the flesh in the son jesus christ it was the same eternal spirit that also manifested himself as the holy ghost who dwells in us if we're born again amen it was eternal spirit that revealed himself as god above us in the old testament and then he would reveal himself to his prophets amen god above us manifests himself by the word coming to his prophet through the ages and as he revealed himself as god above us and then he would come and be god with us and then he would appear again as god in us so you see god above us as he revealed himself from creation and through the old testament that god with us as he manifests himself in christ and then god in us in the form of the indwelling spirit in the believer so you see it doesn't matter it wasn't three gods it was three different manifestations it was god changing his mask it was there god in the old testament pillar of fire it was there god in the new testament jesus christ it's now the holy ghost comes in on the day of pentecost and a pillar of fire he had returned back he said i come from god i go back to being god again amen and so he comes back to the earth as god in the form of the holy spirit not another god not another person to save god all the time changing his mask now so ever in each dispensation god has revealed himself his father god above us son god with us holy spirit god in us these are not three persons of god but these are rather three manifestations of the same great eternal being now god is a god of unfolding revelation he starts with abraham you know with the divine call he carries him on you know and and he will begin even in the book of revelation it says you know in our the book of genesis genesis 1 the bible begins with god in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth genesis 2 4 it says these are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god this is jehovah elohim made the earth and the heavens so now he he is jehovah elohim did you notice here again jehovah elohim lord god jehovah elohim lord jehovah god elohim so now he unfolding himself in revelation you see the primary name of lord jehovah is a self-existing one you know literally he that is who he is therefore the eternal i am but have a which which from jehovah or why yahweh is formed signifies to become or become known thus pointing to a continuant to continuous and increasing self-revelation so the name jehovah would mean the self-existing one who reveals himself so he's a god that is constantly unfolding himself and you've got to see him as he's appearing so he's been appearing and and unfold himself in revelation down to the ages now in genesis 12 1 he is known to abram the lord had said genesis 12 1 the lord had said this is where he he appears to abram as lord of jehovah and he says get out of your country get to the land that i will give you so then in verse 8 he removed from there and he builds an altar unto the lord did you notice that's capital l o r d that is jehovah and he called upon the name of the lord and and so it's the name of jehovah he called upon here's the one he's worshipping now in genesis 14 8 18 genesis 14 18 there is one named melchizedek now paul speaks of melchizedek as one without beginning the days or ending of life he is a high priest unto god continually he was the eternal one so now it's again another mask it's not another god or another deity is another god and and there he is the priest of the most high god in other words he is the intercessor or the mediator between god and man so here is the mystery of god i want you to guess this the flesh man jesus christ was not melchizedek but melchizedek became jesus christ are you with me this is what happened melchizedek became jesus jesus was not melchizedek jesus is the body created the mask that god created to dwell in called the sun but here melchizedek now comes to dwell in jesus christ for he is the fullness of all the expressions of god in the old testament no matter what it is whether it's jehovah or elohim or melchizedek or adonai or whether it's el shaddai it's all in jesus hallelujah now so later god would uh reveal himself after melchizedek he would reveal himself we've been over this in genesis 17 1 as else said i this was not another person nor another god but it was now another unfolding of his revelation again this is what he would do almighty in the in the he said i am the almighty god and and that is translated from the word i which means almighty most powerful this is what he said jesus said he takes his title to himself in the book of revelation 1 8 i am the almighty i am el shall i i am the god of the old testament i'm he which was which is and shall come i will always be i'm the eternal one now no matter what form or name that god revealed himself to abraham abraham knew there was but one god in all these various manifestations whether it was jehovah melchizedek or in this case of of genesis 17 el shaddai there was never three different gods or multiple deities in abraham's mind no he knew he knew it was the same god just revealed himself in a different manner now down to the scriptures god has progressively more and more revealed his care to mankind and it was often done by given a new name notice these are not all the same names lord jehovah right el elohim else said i almighty god and so all of these different names but when he would give a new name in that name was a revelation of what he was doing in that present moment for example when abraham offered the realm and a ram appeared and god uh provided around he called himself jehovah jirei it was not another god it was a new name of god jehovah jireh it was just a further revelation of the same god god was expressing himself by a new name i am the provider the i will provide myself a sacrifice say provided a lamb right and there you see god was expressing himself by a new name there was more depths of that name that he was expressing jehovah rapha means god a healer and so when people want to know more about god they would seek to know his name that's why moses said who is it that i'm going to tell the people that has sent me and he says i am who i am i am that i am in other words i am he that was which is and shall come i am the i am i am the present god for this situation i am jehovah amen i am the self-existent one and the self-existent one i am going to do this nobody has to help me do it i existed before everything i made everything i'll even make a pharaoh who was made by me to obey me because i made it i am the altar i am the creator i am the beginner and i'm the ending i am all of it i am who i am hallelujah if you get that revelation this morning he's the end of your cancer he's the end of sin he's the end of your problems come on amen he is the beginning he is beginning and you were in him in the beginning and when this world is no more you will still be here because you were part of the beginning therefore there is no end all down to the ages when people want to know more about god they sought to know his name who do we honor who do we give credit we want to know his name that's what jacob asked tell me i pray thee thy name you know he said why do you ask my name but because of asking his name he blessed him there's a blessing in and wanting to know him judges manoa said to the angel lord said what is thy name when that saiyans come to pass there again it was there um there again that that where when solomon built the temple he said i build this temple that they may fear thee as thy people israel do and that they may know that this is thy house and which i'm building and is called by thy name so his people will always be called by his name you see like the interpreter dictionary the bible says to know the name of god is to know god as he revealed himself let me repeat that to know the name of god is to know god as he revealed himself so when re use of god the name in the old testament has revelatory content in other words god is revealing himself through that name so jehovah rapha means god the healer i am the healer amen jehovah jairo i'm the provider amen all of these things elohim i'm the self-existing one there's a revelation in the name jehovah coming over the earth and dwelling in the man christ jesus took upon himself a new unfolding of the name jehovah i want you to get this jesus was not named something different he took on his father's name the one who made the body he named him after himself hallelujah amen what's this now matthew 1 21 and she shall bring forth his son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sin so there's a revelation in this name jesus about salvation and this name jesus is literally means jehovah savior so jehovah's coming again and appearing again but he's appearing in a revelation of his name in a way that has never been known before as redeemer savior so he says and he shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sin so it's unfolding revelation now why does why does jehovah come in jesus christ to save us from our sins why will they call him jehovah's savior every time you say jesus you're saying jehovah's savior for he shall save his people from their sins in that name is a revelation of what he's doing are you with me his name shall be called now watch they will call his name or here's a title or a definition his name emmanuel in the words the meaning of his name emmanuel will mean god is with us not a second person come on somebody amen but the person amen behold a virgin shall be for child to bring forth a son they shall call his name emmanuel which is interpreted god with us so this jehovah's savior would be god with us he was god above us but now he's taken home flesh the word has become flesh created a body and now god is with us for what purpose salvation now she took on a name to characterize his redemptive work yeah he was spoken of as redeemer in the old testament but mankind had not known him fully as redeemer as man had not yet fully been redeemed until jesus came there was no full redemption in the old testament israel had only been redeemed out of bondage but still need to be redeemed from sin so yeah he was a redeemer in that he took them from bondage but man was still in sin you see there was a greater slavery or bondage in the slavery down in egypt so they they need a redeeming from the slavery of sin come on now amen we were all slaves not just a few of us all of us we were born slaves we were sold as slaves from our father adam and we needed a redeemer and that's why jesus came to set us free from sin are you with me so in the name that his name would be jehovah's savior jesus to save his people from their sin in him would be redemption salvation would only be in his name no other name that is given among men whereby we must be saved no other name given are you with me but the name of jesus now this was very important in that day very it's important in this day but it was important to those jewish believers because they had to seek god with his mask they had to look behind the human flesh and say that's the lord abraham had to do that he saw he sees a man walking up two angels with him and he looks there and he said my lord it's jehovah he had to recognize him in his mask and then see it's like a drama and one character can play different different scenes he just goes and changes his clothes into the mask and he comes back out he's one on the stage and he's this and another he's he's another character well that's what god did this is a great drama and so god would come on the scene and he would reveal himself as elohim in the beginning elohim created the heavens and the earth curtains close comes back over and then the lord god made the seas and the curtains open there in the lord god lord jehovah elohim then he comes and reveals himself el shaddai milk kills the deck it's the same god all the time and he's just changing his mouth and now you see because of his mass they crucified him they did not recognize the lord of glory amen you see now they knew him as jehovah of the old testament of the old testament but they had to know him as the jesus of the new testament it was no longer enough to know him as jehovah who led them out of egypt now they must know him as jehovah savior because jehovah had now come to save them and they had to know god in the revelation of his name as he was revealed in christ when paul saw him he you know he was instructed he says arise and be baptized washing away thy sins calling on the name of the lord what was the name of the lord what was the name he was going to call on you see he was told for his sins to be washed away arise and be baptized calling on the name of the lord invoking the name of the lord you see this this is an important part of salvation there is no salvation in titles of father son and holy ghost salvation only is in the name although he is father son holy ghost he's also wonderful counselor prince of peace none of them will work for salvation but the name of jesus just a few days earlier paul had asked that question who art thou lord he said i'm jesus i'm the one you're persecuting so he revealed himself he revealed himself jesus revealed himself to paul is lord paul knew about the lord god of the old testament but at that time he did not serve the jesus of the new testament you see here he was going about trying to do service for jehovah and jehovah was now here in a different form and he was trying to destroy him why persecuted thou me and so when he learned he learned that the lord of the old testament was the same as the lord of the new testament and to his amazement the lord's name was jesus it was the same god the same person it was an expression of his name and a redemptive word and there's no salvation in any other name or any other god or any other person than jesus christ remember why did he do this he had to take on a mask he had to come and step down among man he had to allow now that flesh body to die for redemption's sake to become the lamb to become the redeemer are you with me amen but now so here we come jesus is the highest name of god ever revealed to mankind hallelujah you'll never get the first base if you don't believe in the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ it is a supreme revelation of god today no other name i want to say it real clear no other name of god has ever been so full of god's glory that's revealing his nature his character to humanity as much as the name of jesus no matter whether he expressed himself as el shaddai or melchizedek or elohim or jehovah the old testament jesus literally means jehovah's salvation and it's the fullness of the revelation of god as redeemer it lies all lies within that name when you say jesus you are saying my healer when you say jesus you are saying my provider when you say jesus come on when you call on that name you are saying savior whatever need humanity has all lays in the name jesus it is the highest name of all name that at the mention of that name every demon has to bow every spirit has to fall hallelujah in that name encapsulates and encounter encompasses all the former revelations of god jesus amen in jesus is melchizedek amen he is el shaddai he is jehovah jireh he is jehovah nishi he is jehovah rapha my healer amen everything is encapsulated in that name there's not a greater revelation of god than in jesus and from him is the source of all other revelations amen so if jesus if the name jesus is god incarnate then jesus is the greatest name ever been revealed think of that amen his name shall be called jesus for he will save his people from the sin jehovah will save his people this is the greatest thing you see even in the former names of jehovah jehovah rapha jovanishin jehovah driver el shaddai melchizedek never in there was salvation none of that melchizedek didn't save abraham from sin jehovah jireh did not save him from sin all the other names over initial said i didn't save him from sin come on somebody salvation from sin is only in that one name jesus and without that name you cannot be saved it might become a common name to you but the name of jesus is the greatest name above all names there is no other name like jesus there is no higher name than jesus you see he's a great this is a direct fulfillment of this prophecy isaiah 17 7 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold the virgin shall conceive beareth son call his name emmanuel this emanuel means god with us as matthew 1 23 said so literally god was humanity since god himself was incarnate in jesus christ jehovah savior there you have in those two parts jehovah's savior the fulfillment of a manual which includes two part meaning god with us see god with us two parts and that fulfillment is in jehovah savior god coming down to take on human battles god coming down to deliver you from slave owners that devil that had rule over your life from the first birth he's now coming his savior to save you from sin it's simply it's simply another another a manner of extending the revelation of himself as he did in the old testament call himself jehovah provider jehovah healer melchizedek el said i all of these other names all these characteristics was in jesus and all the new testament saints saw something that abraham didn't even get to see all right and that being deliverance they've seen the characteristics of god that was never fully revealed to the old testament think about it in the omega church it's a greater revelation because they didn't know him as savior they still had to live in their sins but you can't be set free from your sins sin nature dies and you're born again and since salvation is the greatest revelation ever given to man then the name jesus is the highest name ever given because it is jehovah coming to save and without him there is no salvation and cannot be salvation this is why paul would say in philippians 2 and 9 wherefore god hath highly exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name hallelujah so if you're questioning whether it's the highest name or not you ought to be able to look right there and see it he gave him a name which is above every name this name is greater than melchizedek no salvation in that name greater than else said i no salvation in that name amen this name is greater come on there's healing in this name deliverance in this name salvation in this name a rapture in his name every promise in that name hallelujah that's why god wanted you his bride to know him by name because you are the people to become a covenant with him and take on his name a people of the book of people of his name you know if jesus is not god's name then we have a person who possesses a greater name than god's own name so the conclusion must be that jesus must be god's name oh my look the bible said in philippians 2 10 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things on earth things under the earth every knee would bow every other thing has to bow to that boy great name there's no salvation in the other name there's no salvation when you invoke melchizedek no salvation when you invoke jehovah jireh there's only in the revelation of the name jesus is their salvation now i'm going to try to bring this down to close because i want to say something you see in acts 4 and 10 peter said be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus of nazareth whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him that this man stand hold but before you hold this is a stone that was said at night of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name among under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved so peter is saying to those jews you've known him as melchizedek elohim jehovah all of these great names but you know what you can come now and you can scream and cry and use those names and get nothing you cannot be saved in any other name you want to be delivered you got to come to this you've name to realize who this is you've got to see god behind this mask you've got to know who it is and peter's saying you can pray scream cry get nothing you will not find deliverance in the other name unless you know god by this name jesus this expression of his revelation jehovah's savior you cannot be saved think of that about 99 of christians don't have that revelation too many message believers don't have that revelation but god has made it known to you that he is this same jesus he has made both lord and christ let's go to acts chapter 2 and verse 36 i'm going to try to finish with this last scripture at his birth he was given the name jesus but after he died and bear and rose again this is what peter said of him therefore let all of the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made this same jesus whom you have crucified both lord and christ now watch this jesus who was crucified after his death barrel and resurrection is now both lord and christ he is no longer just a mere man he is the supreme lord almighty god because when he was raised up from the dead and ascended on high and his body glorified are you with me he becomes both lord and christ so the very body of jesus was glorified can i say it deified and i want you to understand in the ages to come he will still be lord when all redemption is complete and he surrenders the kingdom back to his father showing that his work of kinsmen redeemer is now over when the last person has been saved and the earth has been fully restored and redeemed and it's all over and his whole purpose of kinsman's work is finished he will be god the very god and that body that was flesh but now glorified will always be the only visible manifestation of god because that's his body it will not be done away it will not be discarded it will not be set aside just as your glory by body will always be the visible manifestation of your eternal spirit so will the body of jesus always be the visible manifestation of the eternal god just as your body makes your human spirit visible now and will make it visible in heaven when it's glorified even so jesus made the eternal and holy spirit visible john 1 18 said no man has seen god at any time the only begotten of the father which were the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him nobody could see god but he had to have a mask for abraham to see him he had to have a mask for him to be seen two thousand years ago and walk to the shores of galilee he needed a mask in the great eternals ahead for him to be seen he will have a body let me just say there's no eternal son and one day sonship will be finished his purpose of being the son will come to the end jesus work as savior will be over with and the sonship will cease but the body of jesus will never return to cosmic light and potentially clay his body like yours will never be annihilated and he will never ever just become one of of of the brothers he will always be through eternity the body where the fullness of god dwells and that day when it's all over and the kingdom is surrendered and handed back to the father we will still bow and reverence jesus christ as god almighty never annihilated that mask that he took on two thousand years ago that sets now as a man to be our approach to god the invisible god the only way we can approach is through jesus so we come to the throne with our prayers to the man christ jesus who understands us as a man but that very man is the almighty god and that very man through the eternities will be the visible manifestation of almighty god and one day you will have your opportunity to stroll hand in hand with the almighty god sit an audience with him as his queen rule and reign with him through the millennial reign you know why because you're jesus too he's jesus you're miss jesus and that's where he's manifested in this day it says miss jesus but one day mr jesus will come and miss jesus will go and meet him in the air and they'll have a marriage supper together for three and a half years and after that a honeymoon of a thousand years and we'll rule and reign with christ hallelujah amen the lion will lay down with the lamb there'll be nothing to hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain and then at the end there be satan loose for a short season and then will come the final battle while the saints camp on the breath of the earth and then the battle is finished and satan his angels and all the evil ones cast into hell and will be no more amen in the millennium he's only bound for a thousand years but in in this he will be annihilated because you can't be annihilated but he can so when in the eternal ages to come you will look back and see the things that have troubled you have only been temporary they're not eternal they have a little short space of time your cancer your trouble your sickness your affliction is only temporary but not you amen when it's all over they will be annihilated and you will be living on what an amazing plan of redemption and it's all wrapped up in the revelation of who jesus is oh do you know who jesus is let the musicians come that man of galilee he healed the sick he raised the dead he he calls the blind to see or some say he was just a poor man who upon this earth he trod but he was jesus my lord and my god that's who he is you see on that day oh no when when it comes that day and they all bow to him i've already bowed to him he's my lord there is no other one amen let's say let's stand together he's my lord there is no other one who can calm the storms of life like my lord he gives rest to the weary he gives hope to the hopeless aren't you glad to know him do you know him this morning aren't you glad you received a message that let you know him not as one of three gods not as one or three person but the only god the lord jesus christ he's my lord there is no one who can call [Applause] [Music] memphis [Applause]
