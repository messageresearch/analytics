[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] Do you feel
[0:12] like something is wrong here?
[0:16] Like you don't belong here.
[0:19] It's not just you.
[0:23] [Music]
[0:24] Do you look
[0:27] at a night sky full of stars
[0:31] feeling aching in your heart?
[0:35] I feel it too.
[0:40] We might be here for now, but don't
[0:43] forget where we're going.
[0:48] Going to trade this world for a better
[0:51] place.
[0:52] Say goodbye to the hurt and the pain.
[0:56] We'll dance on trees
[0:58] when we get where we're going.
[1:04] See what our hearts have known forever.
[1:08] We were not made for here. We were made
[1:11] for heaven.
[1:15] Oh,
[1:19] do you want
[1:22] to see your father's face
[1:26] to wipe your tears away
[1:30] and all you love?
[1:34] Oh, do you know
[1:38] that this won't be the end?
[1:42] There's so much more than this.
[1:46] We're almost
[1:52] here for now, but don't forget where
[1:55] we're going.
[1:59] Trade this world for a better place.
[2:02] Going to goodbye to the pain. We'll
[2:07] dance on trees when we get where we're
[2:11] going.
[2:14] Going to see what our hearts have known
[2:18] forever. We were not made here. We were
[2:22] made for heaven.
[2:26] Oh,
[2:28] [Music]
[2:30] and the ones we've lost along the way
[2:35] will run to meet us at that gate. Oh, my
[2:40] heart can hardly wait for heaven.
[2:45] [Music]
[2:47] Where has finally lost his name? We will
[2:52] stand in victory
[2:55] and bow before the king of kings.
[3:01] [Applause]
[3:03] We might be here right now, but don't
[3:06] forget
[3:07] [Applause]
[3:13] [Applause]
[3:23] where we go.
[3:25] [Music]
[3:26] We're going to see what our hearts are
[3:30] forever. We were not made for you. We
[3:34] were made for heaven.
[3:39] Oh,
[3:42] we were made for heaven.
[3:46] Don't forget where we're going.
[3:50] Don't forget where we're going.
[3:54] We were made for heaven.
