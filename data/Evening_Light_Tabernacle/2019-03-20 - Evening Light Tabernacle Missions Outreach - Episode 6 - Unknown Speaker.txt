TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello everyone we are the ministry team at evening light tabernacle in Minden Louisiana and we're glad that you joined with us here this evening for our time of discussion around the round table to share about God's Word we'd love it if you would share with your friends that we're on to today and let others know that we're alive and and bringing a message tonight sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ so we're happy that you've joined with us in this discussion and in our past sessions we have talked about what defines the church and we know there are at least 41,000 different denominations that we have talked about and each one of them have their doctrines and their beliefs and standards and views and but you know Jesus said I am the vine and you are the branches but today we have 41,000 different denominational branches that are all seemingly living off the life of Christ how is this possible how does this happen that we come to this point in in time when the first church was born it produced a certain kind of fruit a certain kind of doctor a certain kind of life because the life of Christ was in the church and it produced miracles signs wonders the power of God the love of God the doctrine of Christ but in the illustration that you used of organized religion today it Purdue produces diverse doctrines diverse life diverse nature and directions and it can be very confusing it's kind of like the the citrus tree that we talked about you know and have many different branches that have been grafted by man into what we know is Christianity because in Christianity I know Christ wanted one church right right and now we have 41,000 that have been grafted into that and so awful one tree for example a citrus tree you can have lemons and limes and kumquats and men mandarins and seumas and all different kinds of varieties that are grafted in there but we know this that if it was an orange tree to begin with if that orange tree ever puts forth another branch it would also have oranges and the same would be true of Christianity that you know if the the original vine put forth a book of Acts then wouldn't wouldn't then if it puts with another branch that it would also write another book of Acts behind it absolutely it would have to because it's the same life and the same lights going to produce the same fruit this signs the wonders and the life lived out of the believer it's going to produce that because it's coming from that original vine it would have to that's what they said in the book of Acts the Bible said that in the book of Acts they called them Christians and it said they perceived that Peter and John had been with Jesus yes because the works that Jesus was doing they were doing not the gate a beautiful it was the same life and it wasn't something they called themselves people recognize this is the same life the same fruit mm-hmm the same thing now there's just more right when the life comes from the bond to the branches it's you know with Peter it was very amazing to see the difference it made in his life you know you had a man that went from denying Christ you know the things that he'd done the situations that he was in you know and Jesus's even said get behind me Satan you know things like that and then he but he comes to Pentecost into the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and the man gets up boldly he denied in front of a you know one person they're denied Jesus but now after the Holy Ghost came the life coming through that vine into him he gets a boldly and preaches a sermon and saves three thousand three thousand people give the heart he's a different person in four together living totally saying I don't know him just standing up there in acts 2:22 and proclaiming Jesus of Nazareth a man you know approved hold him by the name that's what I called him by name and said by these signs and these wonders you approved by God to you he wasn't no longer ashamed or afraid a man a man praise the Lord well so in the case of the vine then Jesus was original and then from him then after he ascended there come a vine or a branch out of that vine out of the root which was Christ which was a book of Acts church I just wonder you know when we think of this it it just amazes me to think of it you know here was Jesus men and women men and women that were filled with the life of Jesus Jesus man Jesus women I wonder what Satan really saw there when that that day when the upper room opened and they spilled out of there and they're speaking in other languages and all glorifying God and now there's not just one Jesus there's a hundred and twenty that has been birthed by the same spirit of Jesus the same Holy Ghost and what he saw the day of Pentecost was the emergence of a victorious church wonderful he saw the same thing that he saw when Jesus stepped out of the boat at the maniac exactly that's right and that come charging it up there to Jesus and he's looking you know no doubt looked in his eyes and said what are you doing in there yeah yeah God had come into man now it's not a one-man but many I like to think it was an emergency and held that day here he is thinking he has victory and he stomped this one out and in one day not only was it 120 but by the end of the day it was 3,000 120 yeah in one day so he saw the men and women under the influence of something that had really never been seen before except in Jesus Christ amen and that they were under the influence of the Holy Ghost and that dynamic power of God was now flowing through their lives and gave them a bonus in their lives beautiful beautiful yeah man well the Jesus was a man approved of God by signs wonders and miracles in other words Jesus never was a self-promoter no it would he allowed God to promote him and he said if you don't believe me believe the works for they testify of me Ryan so God was approving the Ministry of Jesus Christ but on the day of Pentecost we see a church approved of God by signs wonders and miracles yeah the same God that that vindicated Jesus Christ is now vindicating the church and it's flowing through and they are in fact the branch that bears the fruit the vine don't bear the fruit it's the branch that bears the fruit right and it's the bear the branch that is manifesting the life of the vine and now the energy is being poured into the church right now this is God's desire to bear fruit and the people could glorify God to see God manifested in his people no easy to see in the book of Acts but so come to today if we're gonna say we are the church or were a part of that great body the church then it must be a church approved by God with the same signs wonders and miracles if he's the same yesterday today and forever and he is the God that does not change then the church cannot change that God would never change his pattern right and that means that there must be an endtime Church that he'll return for that is bearing the fruit of God the Norns bears forth again it comes puts out a branch it's gonna be an old man very simple time yes so all the other branches are given a false witness on the life of the vine because they're truly not on the vine they've wrapped it in I think that's what we're finding in our day you said there's 41 different thousand forty-one thousand different denominations grafted into this vine which is Christ we know that's Christ so I believe to me personally I just think that it's men who may have gone before they were commissioned to do something for God and they got ahead of the plan of God and they taken their own idea and they made it fit into the vine versus allowing the vine just producing other branch through their life or through their ministry and now that's why you find 41 different thousand denominations well many of them started out though his true men that was moved by the Holy Spirit of God man and they they something became real to them and and they started out with a real sincere desire to serve God but then you know as time along and their followers then just kind of made a little set out of that move of God and and they camp down on that rather than going on into the Full Gospel so every one of these 40 1000s have a portion of truth you know they they they have a truth that that were even founded on but they fail to go into all of the truth and produce that very life of Christ you know um this brings me to the scripture the Peter on the day of Pentecost that he referred back to the book of Joel yeah and he said as they you know where some mocking saying these people are full of new wine and so on well then he said but these are not drunk as you suppose seeing this is the third hour today but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel so he could go back to the scripture and see where this move of God was in the scripture where God had promised this that he would promised a pouring out of God's Spirit and it said and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions your old men shall dream dreams now notice it it said in the last days and that last days covers 2000 years of the times of the Gentiles where God has been pouring out his spirit and so you know each one have received a measure of the Spirit but this is a day at a time where God promises and calls for a full restoration amen so you said on my servants of mine my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit they some prophecy I'll show wonders in the heavens above signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke and the Sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord shall come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved what a wonderful promise that is beautiful wonderful brother Tim do you believe that that that scripture that that Peter is quoting he seems to he seems to apply it to that day but he also seems to apply it to a future day do you believe that Scriptures can be used more than once oh yeah descriptors can have dual meanings and and dual applications for example he would use the scripture out of Egypt have I called my son well he called Israel out of Egypt he called Jesus out of Egypt we know when they took the young child in there and so and so and I think even today that God still will apply that scripture because out of Egypt out of bondage out of sin out of unbelief out of sectarianism and denominationalism he's calling his son sons and daughters back to him amen amen and like you said calling his son donors there is not that you don't we don't think that there's not sons and daughters of God within those 41,000 different denominations but what we what we're saying is he's not calling those denominations of he'll call people out of those denominations unto himself that's right and that's what we will see people brought to right that's the only place true salvation is found is in Christ and we can never substitute Christ for an organization or for any kind of program it'll simply not work so we must get the people to Christ as ministers of the gospel as Christians that witness Christ to the world the only place salvation can ever be found is in Christ and I think any true minister any true church any true son or daughter of God will honestly point the people to Christ if they want to see people saved that's true a major failure the failure of the modern church is getting people to church within not getting them to Christ that's right get them in the pews you invite them for some type of supper some type of program and they get them there but then there's no nothing there to change that person's life because they're not pointing them to the power of Jesus Christ right to true salvation but if Christ is returning for a church then we should earnestly contend for the faith that was delivered by in that first church that's what we should be fighting for striving for and reaching for so really I mean if you get people to Christ they'll come to church that's that's right there you know yeah that bear forth the fruit I mean that's what Jesus said you know and so that is the point and that's the drive that's everything that we want everything that we desire is to get people to Jesus Christ now it took freed not to a Dogma not to a building not to a church but to Christ and then if you get them to Christ then you don't have to have all the programs and the whole truth to try to hold them to try to hold them or get involved forget it you get a young person to Christ hey if it gets what what they got on the day of Pentecost that's all our God in his like see the power of the holy guilty man you won't have to beg them to to worship you won't have to beg them to come to church no yeah it won't be programs that and and you know entertainment that brings them if you won't need a rock-and-roll band you won't you won't need some artificial smoke you'll have the glory of God in that your last Ray's the Lord and that's what we want to see is the glory of God working in the church and they had that right there and that's what we're talking about they had him on the day of Pentecost and we know they operated in it for a time that's right so so where did where did things turn at what point do we start seeing that change because obviously between men and now there's this vast chasm between that church and what people called the church today and surely it didn't happen overnight well no it didn't you know it didn't happen overnight but you know it happened where that Satan remember I talked about how that he he saw that book of Acts Church and what he saw he saw men and women powered and empowered but what Satan also said I want to church and I want this worship and and so you know the the whole work of the devil has been to try to get himself into the church and defile it and make it lukewarm and turn the worship away from the true God to himself and and so were that Satan according to the Bible would become the god of this evil atheist and he would be worshipped by millions yes sir and so it's it's a it's a very bad thing that that has happened that the church because once you once you get off the foundation you lose that power there was numerous scriptures in the New Testament prophesying and indicating that there would be a falling away so it was no surprise to God as he prophesied through Paul and different writers of the New Testament that there there was coming a falling away of the church and also a restoration of the church and I think it would be good to maybe deal with that in the next session oh that would be wonderful in and so in our next session we want to deal with that about the church and how that Satan got into the church and defiled it and made it lukewarm and powerless and took it off its original foundation and then the promised restoration because jesus said I will build a church and that church the gates of Hell will not prevail against a man so I'm convinced that here you know in the endgame that Jesus will have a church that the gates of Hell will not prevail against right and in our next session how we'd like to talk to you about this church that God is raising up in the end time because prophecy will be fulfilled there will be a rapture yes Church of Jesus Christ amen they'll be a bride without spot and raises god bless you thank you for
