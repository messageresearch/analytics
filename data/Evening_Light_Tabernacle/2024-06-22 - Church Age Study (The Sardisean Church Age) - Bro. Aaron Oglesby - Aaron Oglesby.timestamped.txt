[14:06] through verse 6 it says and unto the
[14:07] angel of the church in Sardis write
[14:11] these things saith he that hath the
[14:13] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[14:16] I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name
[14:19] that thou livest and art dead Be
[14:22] watchful and strengthen the things which
[14:25] remain that are ready to die for I have

[14:55] they shall walk with me in white for
[14:57] they are worthy he that overcometh the
[15:00] same shall be clothed in white rment and
[15:02] I will not blot out his name out of the
[15:04] book of life but I will confess his name
[15:07] before my father and before his angels
[15:10] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[15:13] the spirit saith unto the churches amen
[15:15] you may take your seats we just pray
[15:17] that the Lord will add his Blessings Now
[15:20] to the reading of the word and and as we
[15:23] start here um we're looking into the
[15:25] beginning of of the sardan church age I
[15:28] just want to tell take a moment and and
[15:30] say some of the things that I say most
[15:32] times that we gather and is that you
[15:34] know these these services and what I do
[15:38] are really just to supposed to add to or
[15:42] help you with what I hope you're doing
[15:44] on your own with your own reading and
[15:46] and reading these you know this was
[15:47] probably about a 45 50 minutes worth of
[15:51] reading that we ask you to do so
[15:53] hopefully you did that I know several of
[15:54] you have have already come and told me
[15:56] that you're ahead of me and you've
[15:57] already finished the church age book and
[15:59] I'm so thankful for that but but we just
[16:02] really believe that there's so much in
[16:04] this church age book that that will help
[16:06] you understand why we believe what we
[16:08] believe and why we preach what we preach
[16:11] that it's not just man's ideas but it
[16:13] bases everything in the word of God and
[16:16] that's where we want to base everything
[16:18] that we believe amen so as we begin
[16:20] looking at this
[16:22] tonight you know we're looking and I've
[16:24] I've gone over this before but we're
[16:26] looking at a city which is Sardis but
[16:30] we're studying an age and what it is is
[16:32] the holy spirit identifies things in
[16:35] certain cities that he knows will become
[16:37] manifested in a in a later age and he
[16:40] identifies those things and those traits
[16:42] and and and he puts this this age with
[16:45] this certain city and the fifth age is
[16:47] identified with Sardis and Sardis was uh
[16:51] the age lasted between 1520 and
[16:55] 1750 and and you see it there on the map
[16:58] just in between thara and Philadelphia
[17:01] Sardis was the ancient capital of of of
[17:05] Lydia and um in the days of of the
[17:09] emperor Tiberius it was desolated by
[17:12] earthquakes and by plagues and and Roman
[17:15] and Greek historians actually record
[17:17] these earthquakes and and they recorded
[17:19] it and said it was the greatest
[17:21] earthquake in all human history it
[17:24] affected 15 different cities included
[17:27] some of the ones that we have studied
[17:28] and will study like Philadelphia and
[17:30] pergamon and Ephesus they were they were
[17:33] impacted greatly but the city of Sardis
[17:36] was the most effective and history would
[17:39] show that even though it was rebuilt and
[17:41] a lot of funds was given to help rebuild
[17:44] it it never would recover from this
[17:46] earthquake that that hit and and so
[17:49] destroyed the city and as we look here
[17:53] it was a very important uh City
[17:56] commercially for for a period of time it
[17:58] was it was a center of wool dying it was
[18:01] a center for carpet weaving it was the
[18:04] first place that gold coins were were
[18:06] ever Meed and and the ruins that you see
[18:09] there are actually ruins from the temple
[18:12] where they worshiped the goddess cybel
[18:15] now as we've talked about before in
[18:17] other ages going back even into
[18:19] Babylonian religion the concept of
[18:22] mother son worship is carried over from
[18:26] the time of Babylon and it's found found
[18:29] in the city of Sardis in the form of Cel
[18:34] the mother and her son
[18:37] theosis now the religion in Sardis I'm
[18:40] going to go over this just briefly you
[18:42] had Cel who's the mother and dioses who
[18:45] is the son she was the moon goddess and
[18:48] he was the Sun God she was the Queen of
[18:50] Heaven he was the Lord of Heaven she's
[18:53] the revealer of Mercy he the revealer of
[18:56] Truth she holds a key to the invisible
[18:59] world and he also holds this exact same
[19:02] key and and so once again the reason we
[19:04] show this and the reason we talk about
[19:06] this so much is so that you can clearly
[19:09] see where the Pagan ideas of Rome come
[19:12] from we can tie it back to to the
[19:15] ancient world and to paganism and we
[19:17] want you to see that the things they
[19:19] teach and the things they believe are
[19:21] not even tied to Christianity they're
[19:24] not based on Christianity they're not
[19:26] based in the Bible but they're literally
[19:28] just Pagan traditions and Pagan ideas
[19:32] that were that were blended with
[19:34] Christianity by by these polytheistic
[19:37] Romans amen and and so when you look at
[19:40] these two things here you can see how it
[19:42] was an easy progression for them to just
[19:45] take their Pagan worship of mother and
[19:48] son in the form of CBO and and diois and
[19:51] plug in the names Mary and Jesus you can
[19:55] see how that progression was so easy and
[19:58] they can they could carry on worshiping
[20:00] the way they always had they could tie
[20:02] in these little Christian aspects but
[20:05] keep believing and worshiping the Pagan
[20:07] ways the way that they always had done
[20:10] and just like you find in in ancient
[20:12] Babylon over time the focus begins to
[20:16] shift from the worship of mother and son
[20:19] to just the worship of the mother and
[20:23] more and more Focus gets shifted away
[20:26] from the authority of the son and more
[20:29] and more focus is put on worship of the
[20:31] mother and and what we see in the Sardis
[20:34] religion is it gets to a place where
[20:37] it's cybal alone and they don't even
[20:40] worship the son anymore but cyal alone
[20:43] who gets praise and who gets the glory
[20:46] and brother brandham says all one needs
[20:48] to do is go over her various titles and
[20:52] recall the lovely attributes accorded to
[20:56] Mary by the Roman Church to understand
[20:59] where the religion of this age comes
[21:02] from so I want to ask you a question as
[21:05] we go back into things that we've
[21:07] discussed and that we've talked about in
[21:10] the church I mean in the Bible the
[21:12] church is always identified as a can May
[21:16] finish that for me woman the church is
[21:19] always identified as a it's a woman and
[21:21] it's a woman who's supposed to be
[21:24] subject to her head it's a woman who's
[21:27] supposed to be subject to her to her
[21:29] head who is Christ the word amen and
[21:32] we've covered this and we've shown how
[21:33] this woman though the false Vine the
[21:36] Roman Catholic Church is a dominating
[21:39] female who does not want to be subject
[21:42] to the word and doesn't want his
[21:43] leadership she doesn't want his headship
[21:47] and what we find is it's directly
[21:49] reflected in them elevating a woman to
[21:52] the position of authority and a position
[21:55] of worship you can see their attitude
[21:58] ude about not wanting the woman to be
[22:00] subject by taking the woman and
[22:03] elevating her to a place of authority so
[22:07] because of this they teach what brother
[22:08] brandham calls mariolatry or the worship
[22:11] of Mary elevating the woman to a place
[22:14] with power elevating the woman to a
[22:17] place with authority and a place to be
[22:18] worshiped and even prayed to as if she's
[22:21] deity why why do they do this because it
[22:25] correlates directly with the desire
[22:29] of the Catholic Church her desires are
[22:32] reflected in her elevation of the woman
[22:35] Mary because she the church wants to
[22:38] worship she the church wants the power
[22:41] she wants the authority She Wants to
[22:43] Rule she wants the authority that
[22:46] belongs to him she even wants to control
[22:49] who can have salvation and who can be
[22:51] excommunicated and who can be put out
[22:54] and she says I'm going to be the one
[22:56] worshiped I'm not going to be subject to
[22:58] the head and give him the worship I'm
[23:00] going to be the one worship and it's
[23:01] reflected with what they do with the
[23:04] woman Mary but who is it that they're
[23:06] reflecting in all this I want the
[23:08] worship I want the worship we find what
[23:11] she's reflecting there in Isaiah 14
[23:13] and13 for thou H has said in thine heart
[23:16] I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt
[23:19] my throne above the stars of God I will
[23:21] sit also upon the Mount of the
[23:23] congregation in the sides of the north
[23:25] she's reflecting her true husband Satan
[23:28] brother brandham calls her the Bride of
[23:30] Satan and she's reflecting his desires
[23:33] by elevating herself and not coming
[23:37] subject to the word what I find so
[23:40] amazing about this is that the woman who
[23:42] does submit the true bride of Christ who
[23:45] does come underneath his headship and
[23:47] who does become subject to to the people
[23:50] that surrender all their will to him
[23:53] they actually receive all the things
[23:55] that the false Vine craves they think
[23:58] about it what do we hear Wednesday night
[24:00] who has his authority you have his
[24:02] authority who has his power you have his
[24:05] power but how do we get it we get it
[24:07] from him and through him and by him and
[24:10] for him we have it for the right reason
[24:13] and he gives us everything that the
[24:16] false fine wants why does she hate you
[24:18] so much why does Satan hate the position
[24:21] you have it's the very thing he's tried
[24:23] to assert down Through the Ages and try
[24:26] to steal by deceit and try to come in
[24:28] and take over and over again and Jesus
[24:30] says oh little bride here you can have
[24:33] my authority you have the rights you
[24:36] have the power of course he hates you
[24:39] the very thing that they want you have
[24:43] brother brandom says it right here don't
[24:45] fear Little Flock all that I am you are
[24:47] air to all my power is yours my
[24:51] omnipotence is yours as I stand in your
[24:53] midst I have not come to bring fear and
[24:56] failure but love and courage courage and
[24:59] ability all power is given unto me and
[25:02] it is yours to use you speak the word
[25:05] and I will perform it that is my
[25:08] Covenant and it can never fail how
[25:11] wonderful is that church it can never
[25:13] fail what are you facing tonight speak
[25:16] the word it can never fail what
[25:18] situation are you in speak the word it
[25:21] can never fail all power and all
[25:23] authority he gives unto you
[25:29] it's during this age that that we see
[25:32] the first real break away from the
[25:35] Catholic
[25:36] church and those who break away from
[25:38] from the church will will turn their
[25:40] worship away from from Mary and and from
[25:43] the church itself and towards faith in
[25:47] the Son of
[25:48] God and all the while the Catholics will
[25:51] increase their their deification of Mary
[25:54] and they'll continue their persecution
[25:56] of all that stand against her
[25:58] and that's one thing that we're not
[26:00] really going to have time to go into
[26:01] tonight is necessarily is the
[26:03] persecution but but just because we
[26:05] don't understand that the persecution is
[26:07] still going on just as heavy as in other
[26:10] other times that we've talked about
[26:11] there's great persecution but during
[26:13] this age God raises up a messenger and
[26:16] we know that brother brandham talked
[26:18] about it over and over again he uses the
[26:20] key he calls it the Keystone of the
[26:22] Bible and that is that God cannot change
[26:24] and that his ways are unchangeable and
[26:26] he uses that and he says if he chose
[26:28] this type of man for the first messenger
[26:30] he'll use that same type of man and same
[26:32] type of ministry as every messenger and
[26:34] he uses that to determine who The
[26:37] Messengers are and during this time God
[26:39] raises up a man to be the messenger of
[26:42] the
[26:42] age and that man is Martin
[26:45] Luther and Luther would live from 1483
[26:48] to
[26:50] 1546 he was German very well educated he
[26:55] abandoned the study of Law and entered
[26:57] Monastery in 1505 and he's considered to
[27:01] be one of the most influential figures
[27:03] in the history of
[27:06] Christianity now Luther was raised in a
[27:09] in a town called Mansfield Germany where
[27:11] his father flourished in the in the
[27:13] copper refining business and who was
[27:15] also a politician he was a town
[27:18] counselor and involved in politics there
[27:20] and and and so Luther was educated in at
[27:24] a very young age he was educated in
[27:26] Latin at a very young age um he would
[27:28] leave and go to the university of efort
[27:31] which was the most prestigious
[27:32] University in all of Germany here he
[27:35] receives a master's degree so this a a
[27:37] very affluent person up and coming with
[27:40] lots of opportunity and and lots of
[27:43] career options in front of him and he
[27:45] enters law school and he seems on his
[27:47] way to a very prestigious career in
[27:51] law and it was during this time that
[27:53] several situations and several events
[27:56] rose up in his life that led him to
[27:59] begin searching his own heart and
[28:02] searching his own life concerning his
[28:04] spiritual condition you know I think
[28:07] that's good for all of us all the time I
[28:09] I realize that we believe that once
[28:11] you're sealed with the you know with the
[28:13] token life that that that that you've
[28:14] got the seal and and you're going to be
[28:16] there and I believe that but by the same
[28:18] time I believe that uh one true sign of
[28:21] having that is that you always want more
[28:24] that you're always hungering for more
[28:25] and that you want to please God and you
[28:27] want to grow in God God and so I feel
[28:29] like we should all take a moment tonight
[28:31] and consider our spiritual condition you
[28:34] know maybe it doesn't even mean lost or
[28:36] saved maybe it does but maybe it means
[28:38] you know where am I at today where am I
[28:41] yes I was saved and yes things are
[28:43] wonderful but how have things been in
[28:45] the last week how how are things going
[28:47] to be next week am I am I determined to
[28:49] press on am I determined to know more of
[28:51] God and this is where Luther finds
[28:54] himself you know searching his life for
[28:56] where he's at and what spiritual
[28:58] condition he's in and and so he leaves
[29:01] law school after only 6 weeks and he
[29:03] enters into
[29:05] Monastery and he enters into a life
[29:08] devoted to to an interweaving of daily
[29:12] work and and worship to God and Luther
[29:15] lived a life of of extreme discipline a
[29:19] a life completely dedicated to God a
[29:21] life of penance and if you don't know
[29:24] what Penance is penance is a voluntary
[29:29] self-punishment inflicted as an outward
[29:32] expression of repentance for having done
[29:36] wrong and so he lives like this
[29:38] constantly trying to make sure he's
[29:40] right constantly checking up constantly
[29:43] you know tearing himself down for every
[29:45] little flaw and every little failure and
[29:47] he devotes his whole self to doing works
[29:51] that might satisfy his
[29:54] conscience and yet he says this
[29:58] he says I tormented myself to death to
[30:02] make peace with God but I was in
[30:06] darkness and found it
[30:10] not listen he was trying to do
[30:12] everything exactly right and yet that
[30:14] burden of sin that burden of guilt still
[30:18] stayed upon him he he couldn't find
[30:20] Freedom from that he couldn't find the
[30:22] Peace of Salvation he was playing the
[30:25] part he was in the monastery you
[30:27] probably couldn't hardly put a finger on
[30:29] him listen young people you can dress
[30:32] the part you can play the part you can
[30:35] act the part you can never miss a
[30:37] service you can line up to all the
[30:40] standards or even go above and beyond
[30:42] and have stricter standards than anybody
[30:44] else around you and yet that's never
[30:47] going to do it until you recognize that
[30:50] it's an inner work and it's a work of
[30:52] Grace that God Saves Us by grace and
[30:56] it's an inner work
[30:58] just like Luther comes to understand
[31:00] salvation starts on the inside not what
[31:03] you can do
[31:04] outwardly and Luther comes to this and
[31:06] he realizes it's a work of Grace it's an
[31:09] experience that changes you from the
[31:12] inside sure we sure we teach proper
[31:15] dress sure we're going to preach you
[31:18] know that you should talk right and and
[31:20] act right and live in a way that brings
[31:22] glory to Jesus and and and Christians
[31:24] should live a certain way and present
[31:26] themselves a certain way but you can do
[31:29] all of those things and never be changed
[31:31] on the
[31:32] inside you can do all of those things
[31:35] but listen once you meet him once you
[31:38] come in contact with the pillar of fire
[31:41] once you have your backside of the
[31:42] desert experience then all of that stuff
[31:45] will begin to come out of your life as
[31:48] fruits of Salvation fruits that there's
[31:51] been a change you won't have to put it
[31:53] on you won't have to work it up but
[31:55] it'll be an inward work coming out of
[31:57] your life fruits of that inward work
[31:59] will begin to be obvious to those around
[32:02] you and Luther's just trying to find his
[32:05] way and by by doing these all these
[32:08] works and he becomes a priest and he
[32:11] becomes so respected for his knowledge
[32:13] of the word he becomes sought out to
[32:16] that people want him to preach in their
[32:17] church and they they want him to speak
[32:20] and and they want him to come and teach
[32:22] and he's so respected and rever and
[32:24] revered and yet he still didn't have the
[32:27] peace
[32:28] of
[32:30] Salvation listen if you don't have that
[32:32] peace of Salvation tonight you can have
[32:34] it maybe you've been sitting in a
[32:36] message Church your whole life and
[32:37] you've lined up and you've lined up and
[32:39] you've lined up listen there's so much
[32:41] more to it than just lining up lay that
[32:44] burden down and just get in Christ quit
[32:46] Towing it around as some kind of anchor
[32:48] some kind of judgy well I have to I have
[32:51] to I have to listen there's a peace and
[32:53] a freedom that comes with real salvation
[32:59] he says though I lived as a monk without
[33:02] reproach without
[33:04] reproach I felt that I was a sinner
[33:07] before God with an extremely Disturbed
[33:12] conscience and I was studying and
[33:14] reading some of Luther's biography and I
[33:17] came across this article and he wrote
[33:20] about at the very beginning he talks
[33:21] about the fact that he was teaching from
[33:24] The Book of Romans and Galatians and
[33:27] Hebrews those three now notice what we
[33:29] find in those three
[33:31] books look at these three verses Romans
[33:35] 1:17 for therein is the righteousness of
[33:38] God revealed and we're going to come
[33:40] back to that statement in just a minute
[33:42] but it says from Faith to Faith as it is
[33:45] written the just shall live by faith
[33:49] Galatians 3:11 but no man is justified
[33:52] by the law in the sight of God it is
[33:55] evident for the just shall live by faith
[34:00] Hebrews 10:38 now the just shall live by
[34:03] faith but if any man draw back my soul
[34:06] hath no pleasure in him and in this
[34:09] article he talks about how there in
[34:11] Romans 1 how it speaks about the
[34:14] righteousness God of God being
[34:18] revealed and Luther at this point is
[34:20] actually very angry with
[34:22] God because he's done all he can do and
[34:26] he realizes I don't measure up
[34:28] he's done everything and he's saying
[34:30] you're going to talk to me about your
[34:32] righteousness and and hold that over me
[34:34] and he says you know man's already been
[34:36] kicked out of the garden and lost
[34:37] eternal life and we're doing all we can
[34:40] and you just want to point to your
[34:41] righteousness and hold that over my our
[34:44] heads and he says I did not love this is
[34:47] quoting Luther he wrote this yes I hated
[34:51] the righteous God who punishes Sinners
[34:55] and secretly if not blasphemously
[34:59] certainly murmuring greatly I was angry
[35:02] with God and said as if indeed it is not
[35:06] enough that miserable Sinners eternally
[35:10] lost through the original sin are
[35:12] crushed by every kind of Calamity by the
[35:15] law of the decalogue without having God
[35:18] add pain to Pain by the gospel and also
[35:22] by the gospel threatening us with his
[35:25] righteousness and Wrath
[35:28] what was it all the rule
[35:31] following all the Penance all the self
[35:35] sacrifice and yet Luther realizes I
[35:38] still fall
[35:39] short he knew he wasn't righteous and
[35:42] his heart's crying out his start saying
[35:44] Lord what what else can we do what else
[35:47] can I do where else can I turn I know
[35:51] this isn't what you want from me I know
[35:52] you want more but but can I ever measure
[35:55] up can any man ever ever measure
[35:59] up but then this is his account of his
[36:02] conversion it comes from that same
[36:04] article he says but At Last by the mercy
[36:07] of God I think we can all say that
[36:10] tonight meditating day and night I gave
[36:13] heed to the context of the words namely
[36:16] in it the righteousness of God is
[36:18] revealed as it is written now this is
[36:21] how he words it but this is how we would
[36:22] say the just shall live by faith he says
[36:25] he who through faith is righteous shall
[36:29] live there I began to understand that
[36:32] the righteousness of God is that by
[36:35] which the righteous lives by a gift of
[36:38] God namely by Faith by the righteous
[36:40] lives by a gift of God namely by faith
[36:43] and this is the meaning the
[36:45] righteousness of God is revealed by the
[36:48] gospel namely the passive righteousness
[36:51] with which merciful god justifies Us by
[36:54] faith as it is written he through who
[36:57] through faith faith is righteous shall
[36:58] live here I felt that I was all together
[37:01] born again and had entered Paradise
[37:03] itself through open Gates there a
[37:06] totally other face of the entire
[37:08] scripture showed itself to me listen
[37:11] just reading that you can tell there's
[37:13] been a weight lifted off his shoulders
[37:15] suddenly there's a lightness recognizing
[37:18] I'm saved and it I don't have to work
[37:21] for it I don't have to do this I don't I
[37:23] don't have to beat myself to death I'm
[37:25] saved by faith in the son of God by the
[37:28] grace of almighty god listen if you're
[37:30] trying to work it up tonight if you're
[37:32] trying to be good enough you're never
[37:34] going to do it but if you'll just come
[37:36] to this Revelation right here that by
[37:38] faith and by Grace you are
[37:41] saved lay your burdens down and accept
[37:45] the gift of faith the gift of
[37:48] Salvation brother brandham says the
[37:50] Evangelical truth of the scripture
[37:53] flooded his mind and he was set free
[37:56] from sin and Born Into the kingdom of
[37:59] God and Luther goes and he begins to
[38:03] preach and he begins to defend the
[38:05] scriptures with a with a burning passion
[38:08] and with Incredible
[38:11] results he focuses on the word of God
[38:14] and and and he focused on that because
[38:16] it was that alone that had set him free
[38:18] and he begins to turn the focus of all
[38:21] those around him to the word not to the
[38:24] church and to this Pope and to this
[38:26] Creed he begins to turn people to the
[38:29] word it's the word look into the gospel
[38:31] faith is in the gospel salvation is in
[38:34] the gospel and he begins to turn them to
[38:36] the gospel but what he finds is soon the
[38:40] word comes in open conflict with the
[38:43] abuses of the church Creeds and
[38:45] doctrines he was still in the church
[38:48] matter of fact at the time he wasn't
[38:49] looking to leave the church he just
[38:51] starts preaching the word but what you
[38:54] find is the word's going to come in
[38:55] conflict with the denomination
[38:58] it's going to come in conflict with the
[38:59] false Vine and he comes and he writes
[39:02] what becomes very famous and and most
[39:05] people who who know much history or
[39:07] religious history know about what's
[39:08] called the 95 thesis and brother
[39:11] brandham
[39:12] says thus when Leo the 10th became Pope
[39:16] and John tetel came to sell indulgences
[39:19] for sin Luther had no choice but to rise
[39:23] up against this antis scriptural
[39:25] teaching first he thundered from the
[39:27] pull pit against it and then he wrote
[39:29] his famous 95 thesis which on October
[39:32] 31st
[39:33] 1517 he nailed to the door of the castle
[39:37] church this was a great Act of Courage
[39:39] you got to understand this is a time
[39:41] where you can still be put to death for
[39:43] heresy you're you're going to be put out
[39:45] of the church and and the Catholics
[39:47] taught if you were put out of the church
[39:48] you didn't have a way to heaven and he
[39:50] goes and he makes a public
[39:53] Proclamation this is where I stand this
[39:56] is what I believe I'm going to stand
[39:58] with the word regardless of what the
[40:00] church says regardless of what people
[40:02] say I'm going to stand with the word and
[40:05] he Nails this to the church door and
[40:07] what the thesis was is it it detailed
[40:10] Luther's opposition to what he saw as
[40:13] the Catholic Church's abuse and
[40:15] Corruption by the clergy or by the
[40:17] priest who were selling
[40:19] indulgences now for those of you who
[40:21] don't know what that is an indulgent was
[40:24] was a
[40:25] certificate that you paid money for That
[40:27] was supposed to reduce your punishment
[40:30] in
[40:31] purgatory for sins committed by the
[40:34] purchaser or by their loved ones so you
[40:36] could actually go and pay for a
[40:38] certificate and that certificate said
[40:41] when you die this is going to make it to
[40:43] where you don't have to be punished as
[40:45] much or punished at all so imagine how
[40:48] convenient this was for rich
[40:50] people they could just buy all the
[40:52] indulgences they wanted now where where
[40:54] is that in the word where is that in the
[40:56] scripture
[40:58] what is that other than a moneymaking
[41:01] scheme and it says it got to the point
[41:04] where they were selling future
[41:05] indulgences where you could buy it in
[41:08] case you send later there's a get out of
[41:10] jail free
[41:11] card and they come around selling it
[41:14] listen I'm going to tell you something
[41:15] we have a get out of jail free card it's
[41:18] the blood of Jesus Christ it's the new
[41:20] birth whatever you've done wherever
[41:22] you've fallen short I'm offering you a
[41:24] get out of free jail get out of jail
[41:26] free card tonight just accept his his
[41:30] offering tonight repent be baptized be
[41:33] filled with the Holy Ghost get the new
[41:35] birth you don't need a church to tell
[41:37] you the gospel tells you you can be free
[41:41] tonight and he rises up and he Nails
[41:43] this to the door and he begins to preach
[41:46] that that the repentance that is
[41:48] actually required was an inner spiritual
[41:51] repentance that came with real Godly
[41:54] sorrow and he says that selling these
[41:56] indulgences says LED Christians to avoid
[41:59] true repentance they weren't sorry they
[42:01] just had a oh well here I got one of
[42:02] these
[42:04] indulgences you have to remember at this
[42:06] time Luther's a professor at the at the
[42:09] University of Wittenberg he holds a
[42:11] priesthood he's a man with a position
[42:14] he's sought after he's revered and with
[42:17] this one action he turns all the hatred
[42:21] and all the vitri all of that false Vine
[42:24] right on his
[42:26] Direction it was a man with a backbone
[42:29] it was a man who whose eyes had come
[42:31] open it was a man just like Peter who
[42:34] maybe one day was a coward but he came
[42:36] out of the upper room and the man that
[42:38] had denied that tells everybody listen
[42:40] up this is the prescription and he
[42:42] begins to preach boldly you see a man
[42:44] listen you come in contact with Jesus
[42:46] Christ you won't be a coward no more you
[42:49] won't be afraid to testify anymore you
[42:51] won't be ashamed of the standards
[42:53] anymore you'll be proud to declare I
[42:56] know a living God
[42:57] there is Mercy there is Grace there is a
[43:00] new birth you'll be willing to Proclaim
[43:03] that there's a God that can save you
[43:05] from the destruction coming on the earth
[43:07] and he does this and he sells out to God
[43:11] and he sells out no matter the cost
[43:14] young people whatever it is holding you
[43:16] back you got to sell out no matter the
[43:18] cost no matter if every friend turns
[43:21] away from you no matter if if it cost
[43:24] you jobs if it cost you relationships if
[43:26] it cost cost your positions whatever it
[43:28] costs it gained you a lot more than
[43:30] it'll ever cost you you got to sell out
[43:33] Lock Stock and Barrel and Luther sails
[43:37] out completely and history tells us that
[43:39] immediately Rome perceived him as a
[43:42] threat that tells me he was doing
[43:44] something
[43:45] right there were calls for him to be
[43:47] excommunicated there was calls for him
[43:50] to be burned at the Stak and what you'll
[43:51] find if you study it is he goes on the
[43:53] Run he even hides and and and lives in
[43:56] castles and hides in different places
[43:58] for years because they're literally
[44:00] after him but one of my favorite quotes
[44:03] of his that I love so much Luther said
[44:06] Peace if
[44:08] possible but Truth at all
[44:13] cost peace if POS yes we want peace if
[44:16] it's possible but I'm not going to
[44:18] compromise on Truth for the sake of
[44:20] peace peace if possible but Truth at all
[44:23] costs I'm thankful that we live in a
[44:25] time and a day and a generation where
[44:27] God sent a prophet who wasn't worried
[44:29] about dollar signs he wasn't worried
[44:31] about denominations but his attitude
[44:33] reflected what Luther said Truth at all
[44:37] cost and because he was willing to do
[44:39] that church we have the revealed word of
[44:41] the hour we have a message that's going
[44:43] to get us out of here we're not wander
[44:45] around in blindness and in darkness but
[44:47] there was a prophet who came in this day
[44:49] who said Truth at all costs 10,000 may
[44:53] walk away from me when I preach this
[44:55] denominations are going to shut the
[44:56] doors but I'm going to preach truth I'm
[44:59] so grateful for that Prophet we had in
[45:01] this
[45:03] day and in this time Luther his Fame and
[45:06] his teachings begin to spread like
[45:08] wildfire and with it so does the
[45:11] Protestant
[45:14] Reformation so the
[45:16] Reformation says in a short time Germany
[45:19] was
[45:20] Ablaze and the Reformation was
[45:23] on what is the Reformation somehow
[45:26] another I got the end down there what is
[45:28] the
[45:32] Reformation it was a movement in which
[45:34] Christians protested the Catholic church
[45:37] that's where the word Protestant comes
[45:39] from Protestants they were
[45:42] protesters all right and so they
[45:44] protested the Catholic church and they
[45:47] began trying to reform the Church away
[45:50] from the things that they saw as wrong I
[45:53] want you to key in on that word there
[45:54] this is called the Reformation what were
[45:56] they trying to do
[46:00] reform they began to challenge the
[46:02] authority of the Pope and the Catholic
[46:04] church and it resulted in the beginning
[46:07] of what we call
[46:09] protestantism brother brandham says
[46:11] God's time was ripe for a definite move
[46:15] that would be the beginning of the
[46:18] restoration of the church now notice
[46:21] this wasn't
[46:22] everything brother brandham says it was
[46:25] the beginning and we're not going to go
[46:27] into it all tonight but we know how
[46:29] brother Brandon would would use the the
[46:32] the wheat or the corn coming up and how
[46:34] to go through the different stages of
[46:36] life and he says this was that first
[46:37] blade coming up through the ground this
[46:40] was that first shoot it was it was the
[46:42] beginning and brother Brown makes it
[46:44] very clear that in this
[46:47] movement that that there were failures
[46:50] in this movement there were great
[46:52] shortcomings not just in the movement
[46:53] but even in Luther himself
[46:57] but he says it was the move of God and
[47:00] it was the message of the hour for that
[47:03] day and he points at some of the places
[47:06] and some of the shortcomings but he
[47:07] comes back around and says but this was
[47:09] the move of God this was the message of
[47:11] the hour and there were great things
[47:13] done in this movement and there were
[47:15] shortcomings and we'll get into some of
[47:18] that here in a
[47:19] minute but some of the things that
[47:21] helped during this time there there was
[47:24] advancements and the printing press
[47:26] comes out
[47:27] and it helps fuel the reformation and it
[47:30] had a huge role in the spread of
[47:32] pamphlets and sermons and and essays and
[47:35] the Bible itself while hiding in the
[47:37] wartberg castle Luther translated the
[47:40] New Testament into German what was he
[47:43] had a passion because for years and
[47:45] years and years the word of God had been
[47:47] withheld from the common people it was
[47:50] all in Latin and only the priest had
[47:52] access to it so you had to believe what
[47:54] I told you it's no wonder had gotten so
[47:57] far away there was nobody there was no
[47:59] checks and balances there was nobody to
[48:02] check what the priest said there was
[48:03] nobody to check the authority of Rome
[48:06] but Luther had this desire to put it
[48:08] back in the hands of the common people
[48:10] because he recognized it's not you and
[48:12] the church it's a relationship with you
[48:15] and God so you need to know what the
[48:18] word says listen don't take for granted
[48:20] the blood that has been spilled so that
[48:22] you can have this in your hands read
[48:24] this digest this live by this people
[48:28] have given their life for the
[48:30] opportunity to open up one of these
[48:33] books don't ever take that for granted
[48:35] that you can go to a bookstore and buy
[48:36] it or look at it on your phone or pull
[48:38] it up on the computer there were years
[48:40] and years and decades and generations
[48:42] who never had the opportunity to read
[48:44] one word of it never one word of it and
[48:48] Luther was determined to put it back in
[48:50] the hands of the to the of the common
[48:52] people and he he published his German
[48:54] Bible and it quickly became a bestseller
[48:57] and it became the model for other
[48:59] vernacular translations including
[49:01] tindale's English
[49:05] Bible he began to teach the med
[49:07] mediation of Christ apart from man that
[49:10] you're saved because of what Christ did
[49:12] for you he began to teach salvation by
[49:15] grace apart from Works he was the fifth
[49:19] messenger and his message was the just
[49:22] shall live by faith
[49:27] but this was a
[49:29] reformation and not a
[49:32] restoration we talk about the
[49:34] restoration we talk about how the Bible
[49:36] says I will restore sayeth the Lord so
[49:38] we know that that's coming and brother
[49:41] brandham says this is the beginning of
[49:43] it but this move in and of itself is
[49:46] just a
[49:47] Reformation Luther was not a
[49:50] prophet but he was a reformer brother
[49:54] brandham says so he was not able because
[49:57] he's not a prophet he was not able to
[49:59] lead the church back to the whole truth
[50:02] as would a man like the Apostle Paul who
[50:05] was both Apostle and a prophet so he's
[50:09] he's led by God he's anointed by God but
[50:12] he's still not a prophet but he's one
[50:14] that God has opened his eyes to the
[50:16] truth that the just shall live by faith
[50:18] and and the erors of the church so he
[50:20] begins to try to
[50:21] reform the Church that is there and
[50:25] that's one of the errors that we're
[50:26] going to
[50:27] delve into because they didn't build new
[50:31] they didn't start from scratch and build
[50:33] on the foundation of the word instead of
[50:36] starting over on the foundation of the
[50:38] word they kept the form of the same old
[50:41] Catholic church and they tried to reform
[50:44] it but you can't reform something that's
[50:46] dead that church was dead and gone and
[50:49] they're trying to reform it and and and
[50:51] bring it up instead of building on a on
[50:53] a New Foundation yes they were closer to
[50:56] the truth of the word yes they had more
[50:58] of the word but but if that and if they
[51:01] would have looked to the word instead of
[51:03] the old Catholic teachings that still
[51:05] lingered in their mind they would have
[51:07] been in a better place it was a powerful
[51:10] time as anointed men rose up and began
[51:13] to reform what they saw as wrong but the
[51:16] prophet tells us it was an unfulfilled
[51:19] age he says because they could have and
[51:22] should have pressed further into
[51:25] restoration
[51:27] instead of settling for just
[51:31] Reformation so we begin to look at this
[51:33] the salutation Revelation 3
[51:36] And1 it says and unto the angel of the
[51:38] church and Sardis write these things
[51:41] saith he that hath the seven spirits of
[51:44] God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works
[51:48] that thou Hast a name that thou livest
[51:51] and art
[51:54] dead now we we learned earlier and all
[51:57] you got to do is be able to read it
[51:59] doesn't even take Revelation what the
[52:01] Seven Stars are because it tells us
[52:03] exactly what they are in Revelation one
[52:05] Revelation 1 says the Seven Stars are
[52:08] the Angels of the seven churches that's
[52:10] Revelation 120 it's cut and dry we we
[52:13] know what the Seven Stars are but let's
[52:15] take a look here at the seven spirits of
[52:18] God these things saith he that hath the
[52:21] seven
[52:23] spirits of God now now after all that
[52:25] we've learned and all that we've talked
[52:28] about down through this study and all
[52:30] that you've been taught from this pull
[52:32] pit about the godhead and different
[52:34] things I hope that you read that and
[52:36] that you know there's got to be more to
[52:38] it than just God is seven different
[52:42] Spirits because we've established that
[52:45] God is one God that he is one Holy
[52:49] Spirit then then how can there be seven
[52:53] spirits of God I want to linger on this
[52:56] just for a minute brother brandham does
[52:57] in that reading so we're going to to
[52:59] make sure we get this
[53:01] clearly it's mentioned four times in
[53:05] Revelation Revelation 1 and4 says
[53:07] there's seven spirits Before the Throne
[53:10] Revelation 3 and one he that hath the
[53:12] seven spirits that's the one we just
[53:14] read Revelation 4:5 says the seven
[53:17] spirits equal the seven lamps Revelation
[53:20] 5 and six the seven eyes equal seven
[53:25] spirits all right so let's start by by
[53:28] saying that we know that the word
[53:30] teaches that God is a spirit and that
[53:32] God is one that's established God is one
[53:37] but we do see there in Corinthians it
[53:39] teaches us that the Holy Spirit manifest
[53:42] itself in nine different ways one Spirit
[53:47] nine different
[53:49] manifestations okay and so brother Bram
[53:51] says thus we know that the seven spirits
[53:54] of God mean it is the one one and Same
[53:57] Spirit coming forth in a
[54:00] Sevenfold way I want us to start here by
[54:04] looking at the lamps it says there let's
[54:07] see which one was it Revelation 45 seven
[54:10] spirits equals seven lamps let's look at
[54:14] this the seven spirits of God Seven
[54:17] lamps Proverbs 20:27 says the spirit of
[54:22] man is the
[54:25] candle of the the Lord now we talked
[54:28] about earlier in one of our earlier
[54:30] studies that candlesticks and lampstands
[54:33] were the same
[54:35] thing all right so Proverbs 20 here is
[54:38] saying the spirit of man is the lamp of
[54:42] the
[54:42] Lord Spirit of man is the candle of the
[54:45] Lord Spirit of the man is the lamp of
[54:47] the Lord and that's actually how brother
[54:48] brandham puts it in the church age book
[54:50] is as the lamp of the
[54:55] Lord John the Baptist in John 5:35 was
[54:59] called a burning light which should
[55:01] actually be translated this is Brother
[55:03] Bram quoting not me which should
[55:05] actually be translated as burning lamp
[55:09] he was a light talking about John the
[55:11] Baptist or a burning lamp to the people
[55:16] so what Revelation 4 tells us is is that
[55:19] Spirits equal lamps we got that Spirits
[55:24] equal lamps and we just found out that
[55:27] lamps equal
[55:29] what
[55:31] man Spirits equal lamps lamps equal man
[55:34] we're doing a little basic algebraic
[55:36] equation here so if we do it backwards
[55:38] men equals lamps equals seven
[55:42] spirits okay I'm gonna move on to the
[55:46] the seven spir uh to to the seven
[55:49] eyes the seven eyes it says are the
[55:52] seven spirits we read in Zechariah 4:10
[55:54] for who hath despised the day of SM
[55:56] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[55:58] see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel
[56:00] with those seven for they are the eyes
[56:04] of the Lord what is it here brother
[56:07] brandham says this it is very evident
[56:09] that the word they refers to men so once
[56:14] again men equal eyes equal Spirit we're
[56:20] breaking this down easy to make it easy
[56:23] for us and we already know what the
[56:24] Seven Stars are so let's go back I'm
[56:26] going to go back here seven spirits
[56:28] Before the Throne he that hath um the
[56:30] seven spirits equals seven lamps and
[56:33] what are those seven lamps they equal
[56:35] what men seven eyes equal seven spirits
[56:39] and those seven eyes equal what men and
[56:42] we already know what the Seven Stars are
[56:44] they're
[56:45] what
[56:48] men so if we take I I if we take what we
[56:52] found here in our search of the
[56:53] scriptures brother brandham says putting
[56:55] our scriptural discoveries together it
[56:58] is evident that the seven spirits of God
[57:01] refer to the continuous Ministry of the
[57:04] same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven
[57:07] men with whom God identifies himself
[57:11] with very closely they are his eyes and
[57:14] they are his lamps who these seven men
[57:17] are can easily be seen because the next
[57:20] phrase calls them the Seven Stars which
[57:22] are already known to us as the seven
[57:25] Messengers to The Seven Ages how
[57:28] beautiful that is so what we're seeing
[57:32] here is actually one Holy Spirit working
[57:35] in seven different men revealing himself
[57:38] as the same yesterday today and forever
[57:41] down through seven different ages but
[57:44] it's the same Holy Spirit doing it all
[57:47] the time that's why Paul comes and says
[57:50] if any man teaches anything different if
[57:53] any man why because it should all be
[57:55] coming from the same same exact
[57:58] Source he tells us in Galatians 1:8 but
[58:01] though we are an angel from heaven
[58:03] preach any other gospel unto you than
[58:06] that which we have preached unto you let
[58:09] him be ACC cursed so there may be
[58:12] different Messengers but they will all
[58:14] be anointed by The Same Spirit the one
[58:19] true Living God that's anointing them
[58:22] and working through their Ministries
[58:24] they're all anointed by the same Holy
[58:26] Ghost given the same light of the Gospel
[58:29] with signs following that's what they're
[58:32] going to be each and every one of them
[58:34] because remember we already said this
[58:35] but what is the Keystone of the Bible
[58:38] the Revelation that God does not
[58:41] change so if the messenger is from God
[58:45] and and God cannot change then the
[58:48] messenger from one to the next is not
[58:50] going to change because it's the
[58:52] continuation of the same Ministry it's
[58:55] the continu ation of the ministry of the
[58:57] Holy Spirit that's what's so great about
[59:00] this these Messengers were not appointed
[59:02] by men they weren't called by Churches
[59:05] they weren't placed by popes but they're
[59:07] seen in the hand of God God called God
[59:11] appointed God equipped with the
[59:13] authority of God not in the hand of
[59:16] organization not bound by The Squeeze
[59:18] and the the influence of denomination
[59:21] but here they are with the authority of
[59:24] the word in the hand of God
[59:26] authorized by God sent by God for what
[59:29] purpose for you that you could see
[59:32] clearly that you could be restored
[59:35] back the Seven Stars in the hands of God
[59:38] free from organization free from the
[59:41] influence of man and free to move
[59:43] according to how the spirit would lead
[59:46] them and what we find is just as each
[59:49] true Messenger was free from bondage and
[59:53] each messenger was anointed by the same
[59:55] Holy Spirit down Through the Ages then
[59:57] so too will the True Vine be the true
[1:00:00] church is going to be anointed by the
[1:00:02] same holy spirit that fell in the book
[1:00:05] of Acts The Same Spirit anoints the
[1:00:07] messenger then the same spirit that was
[1:00:09] there is the Same Spirit on the true
[1:00:11] church today in the last
[1:00:15] Age The Same Spirit Through the
[1:00:19] Ages these are quotes from from our
[1:00:22] reading brother brandham says and
[1:00:24] anybody that is truly the body of Jesus
[1:00:27] Christ the true church WIll manifest the
[1:00:30] same works as did Jesus and the
[1:00:33] Pentecostal church because the same
[1:00:36] spirit will be in them any other church
[1:00:39] that does not have the spirit and the
[1:00:42] manifestations is going to have to
[1:00:45] account to
[1:00:46] God he says and if the church is the
[1:00:49] true church it will have the very same
[1:00:51] spirit and word and acts of power that
[1:00:54] they had at Pentecost by experience it
[1:00:57] will be a Pentecostal church and there
[1:00:59] will be tongues and interpretation and
[1:01:02] prophecy and healings God will be in the
[1:01:04] midst of her and God will declare
[1:01:06] himself in the midst of her as he always
[1:01:09] has Hallelujah and she will be
[1:01:12] unorganized don't forget
[1:01:15] that listen as we read those things
[1:01:17] young people I want you to understand
[1:01:19] that that that we preach the
[1:01:21] Supernatural and we preach the gifts not
[1:01:23] to elevate them out to some unbalanced
[1:01:26] position but we preach them because the
[1:01:28] word preaches them the word declares
[1:01:30] them it's not just us because we want
[1:01:33] some emotions and we want our church to
[1:01:35] stand out no that the church is going to
[1:01:37] have those things and I don't want to be
[1:01:39] one that gives account for why we don't
[1:01:43] if anything I would rather be found
[1:01:45] guilty of trying my best to set up
[1:01:47] before the congregation all the promises
[1:01:50] of God and saying over and over and over
[1:01:53] again it's got to be there it's it's got
[1:01:56] to be there it's got to be there why are
[1:01:58] you focusing on that cuz it's got to be
[1:02:01] there that's what the word says it's
[1:02:05] going to be the same the signs will be
[1:02:08] there the manifestations will be there
[1:02:09] the gifts will be there I don't want to
[1:02:11] be lacking any of that I don't want to
[1:02:14] place it in some place here and I don't
[1:02:16] want to place it some place there I
[1:02:18] place it in its rightful place it's in
[1:02:20] the word what's your focus the word and
[1:02:24] the gifts and the manifestations are
[1:02:25] part of that
[1:02:27] word and it says you will be have to
[1:02:30] give account to God listen if it says
[1:02:34] that's what the true church is going to
[1:02:35] have then let's have
[1:02:37] it we don't have to work it up we don't
[1:02:40] all we got to do is let it operate it's
[1:02:43] his
[1:02:44] promise it's his promise we just accept
[1:02:48] his promise I don't want to stand and
[1:02:51] give account for the lack of it
[1:02:56] we're going to wrap this section up on
[1:02:59] the Same
[1:03:01] Spirit brother Brown says for in each
[1:03:03] age the church goes
[1:03:05] astray and it is not just the leoty but
[1:03:07] the clergy group shepherds are wrong as
[1:03:11] well as
[1:03:13] sheep then God brings himself on the
[1:03:16] scene as the chief Shepherd in the
[1:03:18] ministry of these seven men to lead his
[1:03:21] people back to the truth and the
[1:03:23] Abundant power of of that truth I love
[1:03:28] that it's not just truth but with that
[1:03:31] truth it's a restored word and with that
[1:03:34] comes a restored power a restored
[1:03:37] Authority he says the seven
[1:03:39] Spirit-filled Messengers are the Lords
[1:03:41] they may be repudiated they may be
[1:03:43] questioned indeed to human minds they
[1:03:46] may not even seem to qualify
[1:03:48] nevertheless they are The Messengers for
[1:03:53] their age amen
[1:03:56] moving on now to the
[1:03:59] denunciation once again my ends are not
[1:04:04] cooperating Revelation 3 and one I Know
[1:04:07] Thy works and he takes a portion of each
[1:04:09] of these scriptures this isn't all of
[1:04:11] one or all of two but these are two
[1:04:13] different portions here he says I Know
[1:04:15] Thy works that thou has a name that thou
[1:04:18] livest and art dead and then in verse
[1:04:21] two for I have not found thy works
[1:04:23] perfect before God
[1:04:26] now what we find is that in most ages
[1:04:29] the spirit has praised the true
[1:04:32] church he's he praise upon the true
[1:04:34] church and then turn and denounce the
[1:04:37] false
[1:04:38] church every time he he'll have all this
[1:04:41] praise and then he'll say nevertheless I
[1:04:42] have somewhat against
[1:04:44] thee but here the entire message to the
[1:04:48] fifth age is one of condemnation there
[1:04:50] isn't no you've done this good you've
[1:04:52] done this good he just goes straight and
[1:04:55] and entire message is one of
[1:04:57] condemnation and we're going to see that
[1:04:59] why that is as we go a little
[1:05:01] further first of all we know that ages
[1:05:04] overlap and we find that the that the
[1:05:08] some continuation of some of the same
[1:05:10] things from the fourth age that so
[1:05:12] displeased God continuing on in this age
[1:05:16] and in fact growing
[1:05:18] worse here's some of the things one the
[1:05:21] leadership of the holy spirit is
[1:05:22] superseded by human hierarchy two the
[1:05:26] pure word of God and its free benefit to
[1:05:28] all men was put aside for Creeds and
[1:05:31] dogmas and politics three Worship in
[1:05:34] spirit and gifts of the Spirit were cast
[1:05:36] aside four Mar olry was assuming a
[1:05:40] greater place in the Christian
[1:05:43] worship so during this time period in
[1:05:47] history we we've said just a little bit
[1:05:49] about this but there were great
[1:05:50] advancements in technology and along
[1:05:53] with that came great things like we said
[1:05:54] the printing press and and travel
[1:05:56] increased and ideas began to spread and
[1:05:59] and with that brother brandham says
[1:06:00] Scholars began to come from the East Who
[1:06:03] had who had the Greek manuscripts and of
[1:06:05] the word and its Purity and and and
[1:06:08] these things combined with the printing
[1:06:10] press began to allow the word of God to
[1:06:12] spread amongst the Believers and that's
[1:06:14] what began to push the the Reformation
[1:06:16] so strongly and books and and tracks
[1:06:19] were spreading with great fervency and
[1:06:21] and the Bible was being put into the
[1:06:23] hands of the common people and because
[1:06:25] of that many great men got inspired and
[1:06:28] got anointed and began to rise up during
[1:06:30] this time men like Calvin and and men
[1:06:33] like
[1:06:34] ziggly and yet as great as they were and
[1:06:38] as great a move as it
[1:06:39] was their minds were still tainted by
[1:06:43] the hierarchy of
[1:06:45] Catholicism they were so used to Bishops
[1:06:48] and Arch archbishops and people that
[1:06:50] were supposed to rule over them that
[1:06:52] they just didn't see the need to get
[1:06:55] away from it totally to 100% break free
[1:06:59] from all that and yes they had more word
[1:07:01] but they began to patter themselves
[1:07:04] after their
[1:07:05] mother their Catholic church and because
[1:07:08] of this they were still
[1:07:11] Shackled says for one thing brother
[1:07:13] brand says they did not oppose the
[1:07:16] church State marriage of the nine
[1:07:18] Council but actually fostered that union
[1:07:23] he says in spite of Luther's constant
[1:07:25] teaching against outside interference in
[1:07:27] local church matters he was not able to
[1:07:29] clear men's minds of the bishop
[1:07:32] Archbishop concept of church government
[1:07:35] thus the church took one step in the
[1:07:37] right direction but still remained
[1:07:41] Shackled he says if there ever was a
[1:07:44] time of denominational Zeal it was at
[1:07:48] this tragic time what's happening here
[1:07:52] that God's moving and the Reformation on
[1:07:55] but a Propet of God looks at it and says
[1:07:56] it's a tragic
[1:07:58] time something's going on because we're
[1:08:00] like yes it's a move of God yes that's
[1:08:02] the messenger of God and yet our Prophet
[1:08:04] says it was a tragic time it's because
[1:08:06] of the denominational Zeal and what it
[1:08:10] is is what happening here is it it's a
[1:08:12] breakaway time it's a freedom time it it
[1:08:15] seems like restoration time but as they
[1:08:19] begin to recognize the the errors of
[1:08:21] Rome and then the teachings of Rome and
[1:08:24] it seems like a return to truth and
[1:08:26] power of that first church age is is the
[1:08:28] next step it seems like they're right
[1:08:30] there but in the midst of all that they
[1:08:32] get snared in the snare of denomination
[1:08:35] and
[1:08:36] organization they get snared in that as
[1:08:39] each one begins to jockey for who's got
[1:08:41] the greater Ministry wh which church is
[1:08:44] the is the church that's right which
[1:08:46] group of reformers in right is right and
[1:08:48] who's the most
[1:08:50] influential who's going to be the one wh
[1:08:53] which church and they began fighting
[1:08:54] over members and and splitting hairs and
[1:08:57] not recognizing they had a common
[1:09:00] enemy young people listen to
[1:09:03] me we have a common
[1:09:06] enemy regardless of what Strife or hurt
[1:09:09] feelings or little thing Rises up or
[1:09:12] drama that comes up in a youth group you
[1:09:14] are not each other's
[1:09:16] enemies your mom and daddy is not your
[1:09:19] enemy the ministry of this church is not
[1:09:21] your enemy the young people of other
[1:09:23] churches and Ministers of other churches
[1:09:25] those are not your enemy whether we see
[1:09:27] things exactly the same or don't we have
[1:09:30] one common enemy and that Satan that is
[1:09:33] the Antichrist that's going around
[1:09:35] blinding eyes but we have a common enemy
[1:09:37] I say let's train our guns on the common
[1:09:40] enemy in order to attain Victory quit
[1:09:43] firing at one another quit fighting one
[1:09:45] another quit getting caught up in little
[1:09:47] nitpicky stuff that one day will not
[1:09:50] matter one day you're going to be
[1:09:52] walking on the streets of gold and I
[1:09:53] promise what that sister said won't
[1:09:58] matter that hurt that hurts so bad right
[1:10:01] now won't
[1:10:02] matter let those things go and let's get
[1:10:05] refocused on what
[1:10:07] matters it is during this time that
[1:10:09] commenius wrote and I'm going do three
[1:10:11] slides of this it's lengthy but I think
[1:10:13] it will help explain to us what God what
[1:10:17] Jesus here is saying in Revelation why
[1:10:20] he's so unhappy commenius wrote in in
[1:10:22] his essay one thing needful
[1:10:25] each Church reckons itself as the true
[1:10:27] one or at least as the purest truest
[1:10:31] part of it while among themselves they
[1:10:33] persecute each other with the bitterest
[1:10:36] hatred what a shame these people have
[1:10:39] just come out together and now their
[1:10:40] persecution is right back on each other
[1:10:45] out of the Bible they Forge their
[1:10:46] different Creeds these are their
[1:10:49] Fortress and bullworks behind they which
[1:10:52] they entrench themselves and resist all
[1:10:54] attacks
[1:10:56] in Divine service the words of men are
[1:10:58] usually heard more than the word of God
[1:11:01] each one Chatters as he pleases or kills
[1:11:03] Time by learn disquisitions and
[1:11:07] disproving the views of others listen if
[1:11:10] your experience or your ministry or
[1:11:12] whatever is based on disproving other
[1:11:14] people and attacking others you don't
[1:11:16] have
[1:11:19] one it says of the new birth and how a
[1:11:23] man must be changed into the likeness of
[1:11:26] Christ to become a partaker of the
[1:11:28] divine nature scarcely anything is said
[1:11:32] May that never be said of evening like
[1:11:34] Tabernacle that that the new birth is
[1:11:36] never spoke of that what it takes to be
[1:11:39] to be changed into the likeness of
[1:11:41] Christ is never spoke of but may that
[1:11:43] always always always be the focus here
[1:11:47] brother Brandon would tell us that after
[1:11:49] the Seven Seals that the token was the
[1:11:51] highlight of his ministry the token
[1:11:54] what's the token the new
[1:11:56] birth what's the message about brother
[1:11:58] and well it's about it's about the
[1:12:00] doctrine there's a lot of people that'll
[1:12:02] be able to explain to you every single
[1:12:03] Doctrine way better than anybody else
[1:12:05] can that are going to go to hell because
[1:12:07] they don't get the new
[1:12:09] birth never lose sight of the importance
[1:12:12] of that what' Jesus tell Nicodemus well
[1:12:16] you're good because you know all the
[1:12:18] Scrolls you know all the doctrines of
[1:12:20] the prophets why I know all the
[1:12:22] doctrines of the prophets so did
[1:12:24] Nicodemus and Jesus said you must be
[1:12:27] born
[1:12:29] again he goes on to say the faith has
[1:12:31] been split into a thousand little Parts
[1:12:35] listen we of all people know all about
[1:12:37] that how many different people can take
[1:12:39] a message and split it into how many
[1:12:41] different ways from a thousand different
[1:12:43] views and and then disfellowship because
[1:12:45] you see it a little different
[1:12:47] way let me
[1:12:49] reate our brothers and sisters are not
[1:12:52] our
[1:12:53] enemies they're our
[1:12:56] allies you say well I don't get along
[1:12:58] with them they see things different they
[1:13:00] talk different they preach this listen
[1:13:03] I'm just going to say this we didn't
[1:13:05] really like Russia but we were allies
[1:13:07] with them in order to defeat
[1:13:08] Germany we had a common enemy and it may
[1:13:11] have been an uneasy Alliance but it was
[1:13:13] an alliance and it got the job done quit
[1:13:15] nitpicking every little thing that
[1:13:17] everybody else does and let's recognize
[1:13:19] that we need one another to defeat the
[1:13:20] common
[1:13:21] enemy he says the faith has been split
[1:13:24] into a thousand little parts and you are
[1:13:26] made a heretic if there is one of them
[1:13:28] you do not
[1:13:29] accept what can help only the one thing
[1:13:33] needful listen what is your situation
[1:13:35] how tore up is your life I got a million
[1:13:37] things going wrong I tell you what let's
[1:13:39] look right here what can help only the
[1:13:42] one thing needful return to Christ
[1:13:45] looking to Christ as the only leader and
[1:13:47] walking in his footsteps setting aside
[1:13:50] all other ways until we all reach the
[1:13:53] goal and have come to the Unity of the
[1:13:57] faith the one common goal brother Aaron
[1:14:01] what do I need what do I need there's
[1:14:02] only one thing for you needful tonight
[1:14:03] and that's Jesus Christ that's the one
[1:14:06] thing
[1:14:07] needful but what it is is just the the
[1:14:09] Corinthian attitude of well I'm of Paul
[1:14:12] and I'm of Apollos I'm of sephus that
[1:14:15] was coming out in the people and it it
[1:14:17] caused the body to be
[1:14:19] fragmented and because of this the
[1:14:21] spirit of God finds it
[1:14:23] deplorable brother Brown says here they
[1:14:26] were living a name but were dead
[1:14:30] certainly they were dead they died the
[1:14:32] minute they organized we're talking
[1:14:34] about Luther's great movement we're
[1:14:37] talking about the Reformation we're
[1:14:39] talking about the first shoot of Life
[1:14:41] the beginning of the restoration oh how
[1:14:43] wonderful they
[1:14:45] died the minute they
[1:14:48] organized the great groups organized and
[1:14:51] tied themselves in matrimony to the
[1:14:53] state that did it they were finished
[1:14:56] here were those
[1:14:58] lutherans who had criticized the Roman
[1:15:00] Church they knew the unrighteousness of
[1:15:03] political and spiritual unions yet
[1:15:05] Luther as when Peter was
[1:15:07] overbalanced by the J judaizers went
[1:15:10] right ahead and made the state instead
[1:15:12] of God the defender of the faith this is
[1:15:15] the first denomination of repute that
[1:15:17] came out of the Harlot but when Luther
[1:15:20] died it was not long until it had a
[1:15:23] hierarchy like the one it had
[1:15:26] fault and this is why God is so
[1:15:29] unhappy by the second generation they're
[1:15:32] right back under the wing of the
[1:15:33] Catholic Church gone back and didn't
[1:15:36] even know it turned right back to where
[1:15:38] it came out of and didn't even know it
[1:15:41] how how did they do this and how did it
[1:15:44] happen so quick the second
[1:15:45] generation how did it happen so quick
[1:15:49] because instead of living the name of
[1:15:51] Jesus instead of making his name and his
[1:15:54] word great they took the name of their
[1:15:56] new churches they begin to say we're
[1:15:59] lutherans and we're of Calvin and we're
[1:16:02] of this one and and we're of that one a
[1:16:05] name that said we're alive we're the
[1:16:08] lutherans we're alive we're the
[1:16:11] calvinist but God was looking for
[1:16:14] Christians list that's the same thing
[1:16:16] he's looking for today well I'm in the
[1:16:17] message I think God you're in the
[1:16:19] message but he's looking to people sold
[1:16:21] out to Jesus Christ dedicated to Jesus
[1:16:24] Christ Christ not sold out to evening
[1:16:26] light Tabernacle or whatever church but
[1:16:28] your life is in Jesus it's dedicated to
[1:16:31] Jesus your will is surrendered to Jesus
[1:16:34] you're living every day for Jesus that's
[1:16:37] what he's looking for today not just
[1:16:40] part of a movement we would call the
[1:16:41] message well it's it's a movement
[1:16:44] different from others and and we have
[1:16:46] different dress codes and different
[1:16:47] doctrines and that's not it I hope we
[1:16:51] recognize that's not it it's about being
[1:16:53] surrendered to Jesus
[1:16:55] being born again and God rebukes this
[1:16:59] age because he made a way of Escape now
[1:17:03] we're going to start bringing this down
[1:17:04] pretty quick here and I want you to
[1:17:05] really key
[1:17:07] in why is he
[1:17:10] displeased because he made a way of
[1:17:14] Escape he opened the door to their
[1:17:16] freedom and instead of taking it they
[1:17:18] begin to sew seeds of denomination and
[1:17:21] they begin to organize right back into
[1:17:23] the system that they came out out of
[1:17:26] instead of patterning after the word
[1:17:30] patterning after the new re the
[1:17:31] Revelation that had come in that age
[1:17:34] they patterned after their mother just
[1:17:37] like Jezebel's daughter athelia had done
[1:17:39] there in Israel and that's why God
[1:17:41] doesn't praise the church at all even
[1:17:44] the ones who had experienced Freedom he
[1:17:46] doesn't praise them look great things
[1:17:48] were done it was a mighty move of God
[1:17:51] the the Yoke of Rome partially was
[1:17:53] broken and and men could now receive the
[1:17:55] word again and a door even was opened up
[1:17:58] for the great missionary age that was to
[1:18:00] come after this but they weren't taking
[1:18:03] his
[1:18:04] name just like Rome had done before
[1:18:07] they're taking the name of the woman
[1:18:09] they're taking the name of the church
[1:18:10] instead of the name of Jesus they were
[1:18:13] living a name that wasn't his he said
[1:18:17] you're living a name but you're
[1:18:21] dead comes with a warning in Revelation
[1:18:24] 3 and2
[1:18:25] Be watchful and strengthen the things
[1:18:28] which remain that are ready to die for I
[1:18:31] have not found thy works perfect before
[1:18:35] God brother Bram here says the word does
[1:18:38] not call it a restoration but certainly
[1:18:40] calls it a Reformation had it been a
[1:18:43] restoration that age would have been
[1:18:45] another Pentecostal age but it was not
[1:18:49] the best that could be said of it was
[1:18:52] strengthen that which remains that is
[1:18:55] ready to
[1:18:57] die sure the age had
[1:19:00] justification but it missed
[1:19:02] sanctification it missed the baptism of
[1:19:05] the Holy Ghost look what brother bandam
[1:19:07] says that is what God's original plan
[1:19:10] was that is what they had at Pentecost
[1:19:12] they were Justified they were Sanctified
[1:19:16] and they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:19] young people that's the very reason for
[1:19:22] justification that's the very reason
[1:19:24] reason for
[1:19:26] sanctification we thank God for those
[1:19:28] works if you are Justified tonight I
[1:19:30] thank God for that I I if you're
[1:19:33] Sanctified tonight I thank God for that
[1:19:35] but God never allowed justification for
[1:19:37] the sake of justification he never
[1:19:39] allows you know sanctification for the
[1:19:42] sake of sanctification those are steps
[1:19:45] to the to the end of what God really
[1:19:46] wants us to fill you with the spirit of
[1:19:49] God is to give you the baptism of the
[1:19:52] Holy Ghost that's what it's all for and
[1:19:55] that's what they stopped short of
[1:19:59] don't don't be like those in the
[1:20:03] Reformation don't be like those in the
[1:20:05] Reformation young people that God comes
[1:20:08] by your
[1:20:09] way and opens the prison
[1:20:12] door and gives you an opportunity at
[1:20:14] complete freedom and you walk out about
[1:20:17] this far and say thank God I'm free but
[1:20:21] you're still chained inside that wall
[1:20:24] free but
[1:20:26] Shackled it's like a SL a slave in in
[1:20:29] the old days if a slave ran away and and
[1:20:31] escaped from their slave master and ran
[1:20:34] off the Master's property and said oh
[1:20:37] I'm free thank God I'm free but they
[1:20:39] didn't go to a land of
[1:20:41] Freedom they was fit to be caught again
[1:20:44] they was fit to be trapped again I'm not
[1:20:47] telling you God didn't come by your way
[1:20:48] I'm not telling you you hadn't had a
[1:20:50] mighty move of God in your life I'm
[1:20:51] saying go all the way to the New Birth
[1:20:53] cuz if you stop just outside the jail
[1:20:55] cell they're going to get you throwed
[1:20:56] right back in it you're begin to build
[1:20:58] your foundation on your old ways instead
[1:21:00] of starting from scratch and building on
[1:21:02] the new experience and building on the
[1:21:04] foundation of the word and letting the
[1:21:05] Holy Ghost have preeminence in your life
[1:21:07] and you begin to realize I'm kind of
[1:21:09] doing the same things I did before I met
[1:21:11] Jesus I'm kind of doing the same things
[1:21:13] I did before I had that altar experience
[1:21:15] why because you got set free he came by
[1:21:18] your way and he loosed you but you
[1:21:20] didn't go all the way to the New Birth
[1:21:23] you stopped close enough for those
[1:21:24] things to get a hold of you you got rid
[1:21:26] of some of you said I'm free but there
[1:21:28] was a chain of Music still on your life
[1:21:30] there was a chain of entertainment still
[1:21:32] on your life there was less things that
[1:21:34] you didn't deal with and before long
[1:21:37] just like this age of reformation you're
[1:21:39] right back under the wing of the
[1:21:41] Taskmaster that had you prior to the
[1:21:43] move of God but brother Aaron I thought
[1:21:45] it was a move of God it was I thought I
[1:21:48] got something you
[1:21:50] did but I'm saying don't stop where
[1:21:52] you're at go all the way to the New
[1:21:55] Birth get to the land of Freedom get to
[1:21:58] the Holy Ghost get to a place where the
[1:22:00] slave owners can come and the hounds can
[1:22:02] track you but they can't never bring you
[1:22:05] back get into a place of safety
[1:22:09] tonight God was unhappy that he' opened
[1:22:12] the prison door and they'd only gone so
[1:22:15] far so he doesn't even give them any
[1:22:18] praise for that don't just clean up
[1:22:21] some don't reform your life
[1:22:26] clean up some and yet you're still
[1:22:28] chained well I do this and I do this and
[1:22:31] I'm way better than I was that's a
[1:22:34] Reformation you've been reformed I'm
[1:22:37] thankful that's great but we're not
[1:22:40] called to be reformed we're called to be
[1:22:41] restored he wants to restore you back to
[1:22:44] the image he had of you in the his mind
[1:22:46] before the foundation of the world was
[1:22:48] sin had no chain on your life he wants
[1:22:51] to overcome through your life he wants
[1:22:53] to lift you up as a trophy of his grace
[1:22:56] and his Mercy not one that's just barely
[1:22:59] right outside still chained to a few
[1:23:01] things my God's able to break every
[1:23:03] chain and when he opens the prison door
[1:23:05] you run and you go and you don't look
[1:23:08] back the hounds of Hell may be on your
[1:23:10] Trail don't stop don't listen don't
[1:23:12] entertain it just keep going till you
[1:23:14] get to
[1:23:20] safety did you break
[1:23:23] loose and then build fresh on the word
[1:23:26] or did you
[1:23:27] reform because just like the reformers
[1:23:30] if you stop short you're going to find
[1:23:32] yourself right back in the same
[1:23:34] situation they escaped that's what
[1:23:37] Sardis means to
[1:23:39] escape but they never made it to
[1:23:42] Freedom they just escaped and that's as
[1:23:45] far as they
[1:23:47] went brother Brown says that is the
[1:23:49] reason that there is a
[1:23:52] church it is the temple of God filled
[1:23:55] with God he's talking about the baptism
[1:23:56] of the Holy Ghost and he says that's the
[1:23:58] reason the church even
[1:24:00] exist it is the temple of God filled
[1:24:02] with God even the Holy Ghost The Same
[1:24:05] Spirit that was in Jesus while he was
[1:24:07] here on Earth causing him to do the
[1:24:08] mighty Works which he did came back upon
[1:24:10] the church at Pentecost so that they did
[1:24:12] the works that he did this age did not
[1:24:15] have those
[1:24:17] works but fear not little flock God said
[1:24:20] I will restore and this reform was going
[1:24:23] to be the the start of it he was going
[1:24:26] to according to his promise take the
[1:24:28] church back from the depth of Satan in
[1:24:30] the dark ages to the depth of God that
[1:24:33] they had at Pentecost to the depth of
[1:24:36] God that they had at Pentecost I love
[1:24:38] what he says here I'm going to circle
[1:24:41] back to what I just said to you maybe
[1:24:42] you did just reform maybe you hadn't
[1:24:44] been restored but he says right here
[1:24:47] that this Reformation was going to be
[1:24:48] the beginning of the restoration I'm not
[1:24:50] telling you to go back and say well I
[1:24:52] didn't get nothing I'm saying quit SL
[1:24:54] back towards that prison cell drive a
[1:24:56] steak in the ground white where you're
[1:24:57] at tonight and say from this day forward
[1:24:59] I'm going forward to Restoration I'm
[1:25:01] going forward to the next step I'm going
[1:25:03] forward to where every fiber of this
[1:25:05] being is filled with the baptism of the
[1:25:07] Holy Ghost I'm not going to stop short
[1:25:09] I'm not going to be happy just cuz I'm
[1:25:10] doing a little bit better and I've
[1:25:12] overcome this and I overcome that I'm
[1:25:14] going all the way to a complete
[1:25:17] restoration you want to Rapture you got
[1:25:19] to go all the way you want to overcome
[1:25:21] you got to go all the way you cannot
[1:25:23] stop short you can't stop short and
[1:25:27] don't hang your head in shame because
[1:25:29] you realize you have I'm saying tonight
[1:25:31] tonight to say I'm going to drive a
[1:25:33] state down and go
[1:25:35] forward go forward
[1:25:40] tonight in verse two it
[1:25:43] says I have not found thy works perfect
[1:25:46] before
[1:25:47] God that
[1:25:49] means they're
[1:25:51] unfulfilled when it says not perfect
[1:25:54] brother Brown says it means
[1:25:55] unfulfilled it was a
[1:25:57] start but it was not the complete
[1:26:01] restoration so they now had access to
[1:26:04] the written word but it wasn't the
[1:26:07] revealed word aren't you glad it's been
[1:26:10] revealed in this day listen here think
[1:26:12] of it they had access to it again they
[1:26:15] could read it again they could look at
[1:26:16] it again such a mighty start such a
[1:26:19] great thing but they didn't have a total
[1:26:21] revelation of what they were actually
[1:26:23] reading remember it was a
[1:26:26] Reformation they under their
[1:26:28] understanding wasn't complete they could
[1:26:30] read it but their understanding hadn't
[1:26:31] completely been restored so so they
[1:26:33] could read it and do their best but what
[1:26:36] God really
[1:26:38] wanted what he really wanted restored
[1:26:41] was not yet
[1:26:43] revealed but brother Bram says it was
[1:26:45] the start of something great it was the
[1:26:48] start of something great it was the
[1:26:50] growth coming up out of the ground it
[1:26:51] was it was the beginning of something
[1:26:53] that God was going to do in the future
[1:26:55] ages because God was going to send a
[1:26:57] messenger to the last day in the spirit
[1:27:00] of Elijah and all the mysteries of God
[1:27:03] was going to be finished listen you're
[1:27:04] living in an age where you don't have to
[1:27:06] guess you don't have to wonder you don't
[1:27:08] have to beat yourself up like Luther did
[1:27:11] it's all open it's all revealed access
[1:27:13] to the throne access to his Mercy access
[1:27:16] to his grace access to the Holy Ghost
[1:27:19] it's all there for you tonight you don't
[1:27:22] have to wonder and hope and guess and
[1:27:24] it's all open it's all right there and
[1:27:26] he's saying come and drink freely and
[1:27:29] whoever that's thirsty come and drink
[1:27:31] from the Water of Life tonight I love
[1:27:34] how brother brandham talks about when he
[1:27:36] says when Adam and Eve left the garden
[1:27:38] that the cherubs were put there to guard
[1:27:40] the way so nobody could go to the tree
[1:27:42] of life he says but now those same
[1:27:44] angels are driving people back to the
[1:27:47] tree of life and he's calling you
[1:27:49] tonight if you hadn't eaten from it go
[1:27:51] to the tree of life tonight if you
[1:27:53] hadn't drank from it go to the tree of
[1:27:54] life tonight don't just reform tonight
[1:27:57] but be restored
[1:27:59] tonight
[1:28:02] Hallelujah he says Be watchful and
[1:28:05] strengthen the things which remain that
[1:28:08] are ready to die it means to be
[1:28:11] alert and to establish what you do have
[1:28:15] permanently it's referencing what truth
[1:28:18] they do have what Freedom they do have
[1:28:19] in other words it's broken down like
[1:28:21] this he's saying you hadn't gone all the
[1:28:23] way back in the prison yet but you're in
[1:28:25] danger of
[1:28:27] it you haven't gone all the way back to
[1:28:29] where you started yet but you're in
[1:28:31] danger of it You Better Be watchful
[1:28:33] because even what you have is ready to
[1:28:35] die that little flame that you still got
[1:28:38] burning Satan's coming to Snuff it out
[1:28:40] he's coming to kill the one thing you
[1:28:42] got he's saying be mindful Be watchful
[1:28:45] protect what you do have don't go all
[1:28:46] the way
[1:28:48] back that right there is showing you
[1:28:50] that whatever you do have is worth
[1:28:52] fighting for brother and I don't really
[1:28:54] have much I know I didn't get it all
[1:28:56] what you've got it's worth fighting
[1:28:57] for he says strengthen that thing which
[1:29:00] remains yeah you've lost a lot you've
[1:29:02] given up a lot you hadn't held on to
[1:29:04] everything you had but whatever you've
[1:29:06] got left fight for it tonight fight for
[1:29:09] it and build on it and turn around and
[1:29:11] go the other direction tonight he says
[1:29:13] you haven't escaped totally but you're
[1:29:15] in danger of going all the way
[1:29:20] back and maybe you find yourself in this
[1:29:23] spot tonight
[1:29:25] maybe you escaped the devil and God
[1:29:27] moved for you and yet you found yourself
[1:29:29] slipping back towards what you came out
[1:29:31] of strengthen
[1:29:34] yourself strengthen yourself in the word
[1:29:36] tonight wake up tonight be aware tonight
[1:29:38] of the position you find yourself in and
[1:29:40] don't go all the way back don't let him
[1:29:43] lie to you and tell you it's not worth
[1:29:44] fighting for just drive a Stak down
[1:29:47] right now I may have stumbled I may have
[1:29:49] struggled but tonight I want to break
[1:29:51] loose into total freedom that's what you
[1:29:54] you can have tonight that's the
[1:29:56] opportunity given to you
[1:29:58] tonight because after the warning comes
[1:30:02] judgment remember therefore how thou
[1:30:05] Hast received and heard and hold fast
[1:30:10] and
[1:30:10] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[1:30:14] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[1:30:17] shalt not know what hour I will come
[1:30:21] upon thee brother Bram says it's very
[1:30:24] evident from this verse that God had
[1:30:26] given them truth as a permanent
[1:30:29] deposit it was received and it is
[1:30:32] irrevocably theirs it now re remains to
[1:30:36] be seen what they will do with it
[1:30:39] whether they will regard it or
[1:30:43] not they had heard the truth in that age
[1:30:46] the just shall live by faith brother
[1:30:49] Brown said there never was an age with
[1:30:51] so many men with so much light to
[1:30:55] shed but he says apparently the word was
[1:30:58] being heard in an academic matter
[1:31:01] manner in other
[1:31:04] words it was just head knowledge it was
[1:31:07] just something to lift themselves up and
[1:31:09] I know more than this one and I see this
[1:31:11] a little different from this one and it
[1:31:12] became something that they debated over
[1:31:14] and and argued
[1:31:16] over and I ask you tonight what good is
[1:31:20] truth if we aren't Changed by
[1:31:22] it what what good is I know God sent a
[1:31:25] prophet what good is the message if you
[1:31:26] don't let it change your
[1:31:29] life what good is it if we just reform a
[1:31:31] little bit these men were aware of the
[1:31:34] move of God they were aware of the
[1:31:37] errors of all the others that they were
[1:31:39] aware of Luther's message but what were
[1:31:42] they doing with that
[1:31:45] awareness brother Bram says
[1:31:47] vigilance and preparation alone will
[1:31:51] suffice to be ready for for his
[1:31:55] coming he says the eight saved he's
[1:31:57] talking about Noah's day and we're
[1:31:59] closing right now the eight saved were
[1:32:02] all aware of the impending flood and
[1:32:05] being aware they were
[1:32:08] prepared and
[1:32:12] saved there were many that were aware of
[1:32:16] Noah's
[1:32:18] message but it was those that were
[1:32:20] prepared that were saved
[1:32:24] we're all aware everybody sitting here
[1:32:26] is aware of the message of Malachi
[1:32:29] 4 you're all aware of the message of the
[1:32:32] hour you're aware that you're in the
[1:32:34] last days you're aware that he's coming
[1:32:36] soon you're aware that you got to have
[1:32:38] the token what are you doing with that
[1:32:42] awareness are you using your awareness
[1:32:44] for
[1:32:46] preparedness are you making sure that
[1:32:48] you're
[1:32:49] ready because he says I will come on
[1:32:52] thee as a thief
[1:32:54] and thou shalt not know what hour I will
[1:32:58] come upon thee you bow your heads with
[1:33:00] me this
[1:33:04] evening young people as I prepared this
[1:33:06] and studied this and looked over it I
[1:33:08] had no intention of it going this way
[1:33:11] but this afternoon as I just began to
[1:33:12] see it and I began to recognize how many
[1:33:15] of us I was guilty of at one time more
[1:33:19] than once have
[1:33:22] reformed I I just want you to know that
[1:33:24] a Reformation may be the start of
[1:33:26] something but a Reformation in and of
[1:33:27] itself will never hold
[1:33:29] you a Reformation in and of itself will
[1:33:32] never get you in a Rapture it'll never
[1:33:35] get you in a body change it'll never
[1:33:37] make you miss tribulation and that great
[1:33:39] day of
[1:33:40] judgment this message didn't come to
[1:33:43] reform
[1:33:44] us Jesus didn't die and send back his
[1:33:46] holy spirit to reform us he came to
[1:33:50] change us
[1:33:55] how many tonight would
[1:33:56] sayl I don't just want to be
[1:33:59] reformed I need a real change in my
[1:34:02] heart how many be willing to just lift
[1:34:04] the hand to God and say God I got to be
[1:34:06] changed I want to be restored I I want
[1:34:09] to go beyond Reformation I want to go
[1:34:11] beyond rules I want to go beyond I can
[1:34:13] and can't and I want to go to a place to
[1:34:15] where the Life of Christ lives out of me
[1:34:17] and the fruits of that life lives out of
[1:34:19] me and I'm completely totally changed
[1:34:25] changed oh
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:28] God God that's our
[1:34:32] desire lord it's our desire tonight Lord
[1:34:34] that we be changed what good is it if
[1:34:37] we're not changed what good is is it if
[1:34:39] it's rules and regulations what good is
[1:34:41] it if it's just another
[1:34:43] Doctrine Lord I thank God for what you
[1:34:46] did in Luther's day but Lord may we not
[1:34:48] be guilty of doing with this message the
[1:34:50] same thing they did and only com in a
[1:34:52] little ways with it but let us go all
[1:34:54] the way Lord you called a people out for
[1:34:57] your name's sake you called a bride out
[1:35:00] you you called a people Lord a people
[1:35:02] that aren't going to take the name of a
[1:35:04] church but a people that just long to be
[1:35:06] called Miss Jesus Christ Lord we lay our
[1:35:10] will down we don't just want to reform
[1:35:11] tonight we want you to have complete
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:15] control Lord you see the hands across
[1:35:18] this place Lord you know the hearts of
[1:35:20] these young people you know the battles
[1:35:22] they fight you know the struggle Lord I
[1:35:24] don't even
[1:35:26] pretend Lord to know how difficult it is
[1:35:28] things change so rapidly every 5 years
[1:35:31] every year every day every month is
[1:35:33] changing and the attacks are changing
[1:35:34] but what I do know is that the Holy
[1:35:36] Ghost works the Holy Spirit works the
[1:35:39] token works it is a power that will
[1:35:41] overcome everything the devil can ever
[1:35:43] come with Lord you said that this bride
[1:35:46] was predestined not to fall and I
[1:35:48] believe I'm preaching to a portion of
[1:35:49] that bride
[1:35:50] tonight Lord I pray that everyone that
[1:35:53] has struggled
[1:35:54] has beat themselves up and tried to
[1:35:56] attain it may they recognize tonight
[1:35:57] like Luther did by Faith Lord in a
[1:36:00] finished work by Grace Lord what you did
[1:36:04] may they accept that forgiveness may
[1:36:05] they walk into that justification may
[1:36:08] they not stop there but may they go into
[1:36:10] that sanctification and not stop there
[1:36:12] but go into the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:14] Ghost and may I say it not stop there
[1:36:17] but go from glory to glory to glory and
[1:36:21] continually be changed until one day
[1:36:23] these mortal bodies will put on
[1:36:25] immortality Lord that's my desire Lord I
[1:36:28] love these young people they come week
[1:36:30] after week Lord every service that these
