there for us you know we don't know from one day to the next when things will happen problems will come maybe even have sometime of loved one to slip over on the other side I I thought of a classmate

may have need in your life today that maybe you you uh are Desiring something from God maybe there's an answer that you're searching for well I want you to know in this generation he especially made himself known as a personal God a God that could let you know I know your name your address what the doctor said about you even a lie that was told on you or whatever he knew the whole heart because he's a personal God and he wants to be personal to you allow him to do that today amen ask him come to My Heart Lord come to me father in the name of Jesus as we bow before your throne of grace we

name of Jesus for your glory amen amen God bless you if you'll turn with me to Mark 11 and verse 12 we'll read the scripture and then let you be seated and um I'll wait then to to give some of the greetings I want to do Mark 11:12 and on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree of far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and in the morning as they passed by they saw the viig tree dried up from the roots this is verse 20 now in verse 21 and Peter calling to remembrance Seth unto him Master behold the victory which thou curses is withered away and Jesus answered and said unto them have faith in God verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen God bless you God bless you brother Aaron spoke about a moment ago about the the event of the last couple of days where that you worked so hard for the young people and providing for them and I want to say thank you and and say add my appreciation for that for all of you that contributed and helped and did what you could for our our young people I believe that they're they are um very vital important to us here in this church and and to see them encouraged and strengthened and helped and and support him to go to youth camps and things like that that we do through the years is so very very important and this kind of helps um lift the strain off of on all the other rest of the family and and helps to provide so thank you very much I was very proud of you as the church and uh I thank you for what you've done as you know I just returned from France with had to fly into actually Geneva Switzerland and then go over about an hour's drive over in through the city traffic into France it's not really that's far away it's just a a commute to work for Brother David mayor who works in Switzerland lives in France has a church there in France and he has a meeting there every October that he's had um for the last several years he also has an Easter meeting that I can come to and so so because I couldn't come to that he's he made another meeting for me and brother Timothy to come and Minister well I just tell them you know when I'm going that far away I'm not going without Timothy so that's the way it is so um we uh we bring him along and he's a he's a real good help amen and and in fact the matter is I sometimes I don't know if I'm there to help him or he's there to help me but we're um worked together as a team and U he certainly carries his his part really well they really appreciate his ministry and blessed him I I did a little teaching over there if you want to we put it on YouTube um for the people for the French speaking people as well as for the American people I felt there were key sermons that um that was necessary one I preached on the secret of his coming and the second I preached on we have come to the seventh seal and it's just explaining things in our day uh things that you know you got different areas where there are certain problems and misunderstandings and things that have caused confusion for years and you just try to try to do that part as brother brandham saw he said the bride as he watched her in the vision she got out of step and and um he said it was some in the back he said maybe some of them foreign ones back there so you know we're now I think way in the back you know I mean from where he was in the vision to now we're way in the back some of the last ones coming in and and uh some of the confusions that have come um through the years because that we didn't have all the message and it wasn't printed it wasn't available uh I try to explain to people back in the early days of the message um you know know a set of brother brandham sermons was about $8,000 and you know you could buy uh three pickups for that brand new ones and so you know um it was very very expensive to own a whole library of them and then they were on real to reels and very difficult then to really search it out so somebody come up and come up with a doctorine that you wasn't familiar with like what happened in the 70s with the seven Thunders it was because of um the seventh under doctr went forth and got a hold because the messages wasn't available we didn't know it we didn't have it it wasn't wasn't searchable and and so today you know there's still a lot that are that have these things as divisions and separates them and separates families separates churches separates uh people from fellowship and and they're just era and so we spoke there on several things there to try to help them in that area and there were Believers there from switchel and of course from France and um Belgium uh Germany Serbia Norway and other countries from Europe as well also Brazil was a had of representation there and and uh a brother flew in all the way from India a pastor over there he's near hyderbad he listens to our Services all the time and said I I just wanted to come and and meet you so he he flies 12 hours across um the continents there to come to Europe and meet us there and he um he's a had had a very very fine spirit I enjoyed meeting his brother Boaz ktha and uh then there was Brother David iers from Belgium brother friends W epar from Switzerland others who supported the meetings and and it it was just a wonderful time that we had together with the Believers there with Brother David mayor who's doing a fine work there and as you've heard him he's a fine preacher amen and we thank God for raising up men like that in this end time to carry the burden of the word I believe we're living in the last days we we just had our October's meetings and and you know I I'm very amazed every year to find people even ministers you don't realize it but you know I've had I've had pastors fly down here from from Indiana all the way from Indiana coming down and and um and and other places but in particular this one come down he said brother tell my pastor church but I don't have what you got and I need the Holy Ghost and I'm thinking dear God you know we got pastors without the holy ghost that have never had an experience with God and have the dynamic power of God to change their lives I said you know H how does this happen I I you know I had ministers even in this meeting here that come to me amazed they' never seen a prayer line they had never heard us they' never heard speaking in tongues or or prophecy and I find that very sad I find that very sad that we have drifted as a movement until the supernatural has become so far removed from us and and the least of the gifts which is speaking in tongues is now even far to many that's just the least of them and it's one that Paul said forbid not to speak with tongues despise not prophesying and it was one that Paul said I would that you all speak with tongues but rather that you prophesy and then he said desire spiritual gifts and and brother bradam even told us that if you laid under the altar long enough sooner or later you would speak with tongues it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not something that is prerequisite for the Rapture but it's something God does it's something that you can experience and that every believer should desire uh a closer walk with God and experience even more of God sure we know it's been a mockery and everything else but um that that is done to it and manufactured and imperson needed but that doesn't take away from the real and from the genuine and I think as a body of Believers that we should desire to have a the the supernatural among us if if not I mean do you think we're just going to go along coasting on all the way to the Rapture Day and and then all of a sudden Supernatural things going to happen with the resurrection and and our change no it's not going to happen that way amen it'll be God manifest himself among us as the same yesterday today and forever and we should expect that in every Church in every local assembly amen and then and and so you know as I as I look and I see a a movement that is dying becoming more and more secular more and more to the point where the the the things of of the supernatural gospel is unheard of and never been experienced I I think it's very sad I think it's wrong I think it's a something that the devil has done to try to move us away from the real moving of the spirit of God and I think there should be a longing in every believer's heart Lord I want more of the Holy Ghost you said the Rapture would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have worked in a small measure while the Capstone came down to unite with the body but then the full power of the Holy Ghost would lift us up amen I I tell you I I want it more for my life I want it for your life amen for you to experience God in a greater way I think that is very important I I never go to sleep at night I never go to bed at night without saying Lord you know don't let my conscience be so far away that you can't speak to me that you can't reveal yourself to me and I I think that ought to be the desire of every one of us today I'm going to speak speak on the mountain movers When Faith becomes perfect and as we do this maybe maybe some will think this is quite Elementary and maybe even not needed but I find that you know it's it's necessary to affirm and reaffirm and to show by the scripture of the things that God has done in our generation and you know when you talk about faith faith is not something brother brandom said that you have to fast and pray for but it is in long hours of prayer to have faith he said faith is really common and and he said you know actually it's as common as you go into your car and and and and turning the key and and putting in the gear you expect it to go that's Faith it's an expectation and so again he he he tells us again that faith is something that is that is every believer has well you're born of faith and and not only are you born of Faith but the Bible said to every man and woman is given a Measure of Faith so you all have faith if you're a child of God and faith is common he he liken it to his up hup being um a common weed you know and and it's a applied the blood would be applied by the hisp he said you just reach down anywhere and you get a handful of it and he said that's exactly what faith is Faith is just like this common weed it's everywhere you use it all the time you don't realize it he said faith is an unconscious thing it's not something that you're even a conscience or you're even aware of but you have faith down down on the inside of you but what we what we want to do is talk about perfect faith and and how that Faith becomes perfect and so you think well but if it's common and it's there but well for miracles and I'm quoting brother brandham now for for miracles and for healing brother brandom it's some different kind of Faith No he said it's the same Faith there's only one faith and all good things and all things are are are original so as he as he tells us it is for the believer it is the six sense you know we you have the five senses which are um of course we know for the body is um which is uh cast smell feeling here and that's for the contact the Earthly realm but the believer has illuminated by the Holy Spirit his faith and Faith allows you to see things that you cannot and experience things that you cannot experience with your five senses and so again if you look in this in the Scripture it was even in the Old Testament even though Faith wasn't a word that was used often in the Old Testament yet Paul would say it was by faith Noah it was by faith Enoch it was by faith he looked back and he says they were putting Faith to work and and and of course it was that six sense he and brother Brandon would preach about this he said it was the six sense that the walls of Jericho fell flat to the ground and and it was the six sense that couldn't were the that that became activated that that so that the sea could not drown Paul when and when all hopes was gone and he saw a vision of the angel of Lord he came back and said be of good courage what was it no moon or Stars 14 days a night just as black as it ever was the storm just as great as it ever was but that six sense went to work and when he seen the angel of the Lord and then he then he said it was that six sense that got Peter out of the jail and it was the power of God that sent an angel there to deliver him and so the six s delivered Paul and Silas from the stalks that held them bound and God sent an earthquake and shook the whole thing you see they were operating in faith they didn't know how God was going to do it they just began to have confidence in God and begin to sing and begin to worship God and as they did the earthquake took place and their stocks came loose and they were freed from their bondage you see it was it was the six sense operating that the fire couldn't burn to Hebrew children it was that six sense that that operation in in Martha that pulled Jesus to bring forth the resurrection and and again it was the six sense that would CLE cleanse the leopard and that would raise Jesus from the dead amen it was it was again the six sense he said we'll Rapture the church one of these days and take it out of here into Glory so we're going to need faith for the Rapture amen and when we we say brother randam told us again he said that it was for healing for miracles it's not a different type of Faith it's the same Faith now so again we have the faith that is in us now brother Brandon preached from this text and and he he actually spoke on speak to this mountain and and then and where he where Jesus said that whosoever shall say to this m Mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe now that's faith shall believe that those things that he saith shall come to pass he can have whatsoever he said then whatsoever things you desire When you pray you believe that's faith that you receive them and you shall have them so brother randam tells us in the message speak to this mountain he said I believe the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world this is the first time has been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being ask anything that you will and it shall be given to you anything that you desire and he said don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled oh it's going to happen pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen now that that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she'll rise to her feet like a mighty Army the sick will be healed by a word the blind will see the deaf will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now I believe it's soon coming the P I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to strike the Church of God soon and is going to start a Revival to shape the world now again this is then a very important scripture to us this one I started with it would be it would be the substance or the scripture for the third phase of his ministry and know we know that the third phase of brother Brandon's Ministry we call it the third pull and there's a reason for that because of a vision that he had where he was making three pulls and and would be catching catching a fish we won't go and explain it but just to tell you it just represented the third phase of his ministry and for the third phase of his ministry we know it was the opening of the word amen it was revealing of the Seven Seals it was making known of the Mysteries but at the same time it was based on this scripture of and I want to get it back to you if we believe in the opening of the word it's based on this scripture right here that I read this morning that whatever you ask you will receive amen you speak it I'll back it up amen so it is a word it is the scripture that goes with the opening of the word you see the the opening of the word just don't give us more Creeds and dogmas and doctrines the opening of the word in opens up the entire Bible to us therefore we have in there we have healing we have deliverance we have uh yeah tongues is in the Bible prophecies in the Bible every everything's in the Bible come on yes there are understandings of the Mysteries that are there there there are knowledge of the word that comes but with that also is a dynamic Supernatural power of God that is released because the word is open and if it isn't the word still close to you I don't care what how much knowledge you think you have it's still close to you because it is evidence the dynamic power of God is missing so you can claim all the knowledge and oh I know I've got understanding and we got Revelation Beyond anybody else and brother we're in the opening of the word well then it must have the manifestation now brother brandham read the scripture and of course you know this was a scripture that he was contemplating him on while he was out squirrel hunting and it was there that as he began to think on that God showed him the power of it and he did that by by telling him to speak and he spoke and squirrels came to existence now listen we wouldn't believe all of that if it wasn't for the thousands of evidences of divine manifestation that had already come that's it wasn't this was not some random preacher just getting up and say hey I spoke a squirrel into existence this was a man with a background in a history of thousands upon thousands of visions that never failed prophecies that never failed is somebody with me amen healings and miraculous that was uh you know Unthinkable to the human mind amen so again this is why we freely say yeah squirrels were created by the word this man took that scripture and spoke something out of nothing so why would that even be important well because one day we're going to get a new body amen and it's the same thing that's right amen you know it will materialize that from that other dimension and here exactly there come on somebody if it can create a squirrel it can create a new body if it is if it can create a squirrel if you got a if you got a sick heart it can give you a new one what what do you think that when sister Lana was healed of cancer and one day a dark clouded lung and the next day clear it took a it to Creation to create a new new cells amen we we saw the power of creation that's what it is now so you say but if I knew now I'm quoting brother brandom if I knew there was a scripture that pertained to me like that and he's referring to this scripture I believe I could have the same Faith well he said well my beloved friends every Divine promise in the Bible belongs to you remember the quote I read to you here the other day that every one of us sees the vision when we read the word every one of us that that is a vision amen that's God's word on paper but yet brother when it's taken and put on a human lips it's the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go so now when he said if I knew there was a scripture that pertained to me like that I believe I could have the same Faith well my beloved friends every Divine promise in the Bible belongs to you and it's just as essential to you as it was to him you find One Promise here that God has made and all all heavens and earth will pass away before that promise would ever fail to act in your stead because it's through the believer whosoever will may come and be partakers of it and I think that one of the main things that causes us to miss the blessing are you with me and remember faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God and the reason that we miss it is we don't feed on it enough Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God let me let me shorten that for you man shall live by every word amen so man shall have his Daily Bread by the word of God but we try to make it more and less some far off promise way away in some other age but the Bible said now we're the sons of God not we will be we are now and God has not made it complicated and many people try to think of that way that it's complicated therefore they miss the real blessing of the word by trying to make it some hard thing and my purpose is to reveal to you the best I can by his blessed word that God is not complicated in any way the believer makes it complicated and God makes it simple so what do we do we complicate things and we complicate it by by taking things which is doubt and trying to mix it with our faith now there's a great misconception about perfect Faith too many have made it complicated perfect faith has been thought by some to be something only a prophet could have and this is this is unbelief that that is these are direct direct attacks from those demons that are released from the Euphrates that are coming against us in this day now I I want you to we have been talking about Revelation 9 but it is so pertinent to us in this day I want you to know hell has been Unleashed amen now and he he said those Spirits there were bound with tradition that it can't let loose because it's against Christian principles and it's still the same ungodly Pagan spirit and that spirit is caught into the nations of the world and he said while this group has got here 2,000 bound at the Euphrates and has been bound for 2,000 years also the church listen the church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under martyrdom back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the river Euphrates but at the door of Creeds and dogmas so just as those Spirits were hindered from coming over into the promised land even so there are spirits released and brother Brandon said it's not the rivers Euphrates it's the doors of Creeds and dogmas that will bind and hinder the Holy Spirit from working in his people amen now so you see that he said that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems and she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the Bible said in the two meet one another on the Battlegrounds Lucifer and Michael again like in the beginning they've been bound for 2,000 years for almost 2,000 years now so here we are been bound at the doors of Creeds and dogmas but as brother brandham tells us in that message she's going to be liberated the holy spirit is being liberated and there's a people amen entered into every promise that God has in his word now I'm just going to show you these Creeds and dogmas I'm going to show you a door I just went on today you know yesterday actually I went onto a website called Christian christianity.com and you know in it's it has a tradition and established thinking of modern Babylonian Christianity to day and like the spirits Bound in Euphrates these get Bound in the rivers of unbelief and unfortunately these tried to hinder the elect from going into the promised land of the Bible so you know I I went on this site just to see it's christianity.com and they were explaining how the early church began how it began with signs and wonders and the miraculous and the moving of the spirit now you know by the prophets teaching that what they were there we are to be that same kind of church in the end time that the seed planted will match the seed harvested or vice versa now so in this in this they that we're talking about laying on a hands and this is why I went there I went to see what they said about laying on their hands and they talked about the early Christians and laying on their hands and it's worth noting they say however that even as early as the beginning of the 2 Century only the apostles were able to physically lay hands on others in order to empower them with the Holy Spirit such as in the case of the Apostles Peter and John traveling to Samaria in order to perform this ritual so again they they tell you this die with the death of the Apostles this is what they're saying and and said you know it's shown Peter and John they had this this gift so they go down to Samaria on them that had believed and baptized and they they laid hands on them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and the Bible said and they spake with tongues and prophesied and said you know and he said that only they you see the apostle Peter and John traveling to Samaria in order to perform this ritual given the fact that the church had not completed its embryonic stage it was actually the miraculous gift of the Holy Ghost that was meant to confirm the validity of the message that had been once delivered uh that had been delivered once and for all by the apostles so he said they said these miraculous gifts they were to confirm the validity of the message that had been delivered it's important to remember that these gifts were temporary due to the fact that the apostles were commissioned to deliver the word of the New Covenant and it's clearly stated in first thessal 1 Corinthians 138-10 that Miracles are temporary gifts from the spirit and they're only to be used for limit time now this is this is where they're getting this from they take the scripture where Paul said in our perfected State when we are changed when we know as we are known when we enter into that perfected State and our bodies are changed we won't need any more prophecies we won't need healings we need won't need work of Miracles but you see they say it was for limited time and it stopped back there this is what brother Bram dealt with over and over and over his entire Ministry days of Miracles are passed the age of the Apostles are over and this is what he he had to come against over and over he was fighting against this unbelief just to get people healed just to get people filled with the spirit because you see you see the doors of Creeds and dogmas had sealed it up from the people this is not the Bible the Bible doesn't teach this they take scripture and they apply scripture and I'll tell you why they do it cuz they don't have it they don't have it amen and because they don't have it then they make reasons why it's not needed that's right so he says so they say there is no one today who has the miraculous power to lay hands on the sick in order to heal them owing to the primary reason for the apostles having the miraculous power to lay hands on the sick and the fact that the miraculous gifts have seed with the Revelation and the completion of the will of God through Jesus Christ which is evident in scripture and then they go on to say Jesus healed the sick especially the termin terminally ill he encouraged the early Christians to do the same this is their writing and when the early stages of Christianity began the apostles were temporarily given the power to heal leprosy by laying their hands on it after the time when the the scripture began to be written down this power ceased to exist now this this is a demonic attack that's right trying to bind the Holy Spirit which the message liberates but they want to bind the Holy Spirit to keep it from doing its work now these demonic attacks is against the bride of Christ and they continue I I I regret to say this but they continue to be hurled like bombs and even some from from those in the message Community saying we now have the perfect word same thing you know that that that only happened to vindicate the message so all the Divine Healing all the miraculous all the thing was only done to vindicate it once it Vindicated we don't need it no more because now we have the perfect word so things like speaking in tongues or gifts of the Spirit or Gifts of healing are all over since we now have the perfect word well you know I will say this I I I I've got a couple of things to say about it but if if all of that is over the gift of healing listen the most massive divine heal and move that will ever be will be the change of our bodies healing now you got a bad heart God May fix that one you got cancer in the bloodstream God will remove it you got bad eyes he'll give you New Vision but he don't fix the rest of the body you come up 80 years old and you walk home 80 years old it doesn't change your body but in that Divine Healing yeah you're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an ey gray hair will come back the right color come on Amen missing limbs will be restored that's all a part of this word that has been released in the end time now but these are wounds from the pulpit as the effects of the Gospel is crucified notice you can't crucify the Bible you can burn it if you wanted to you can put it on a pole you wanted to but you can't crucify the Bible you can't crucify Christ once again he cannot be crucified again but you can crucify the effects and that's where the crucifixion takes place is against the effects of the Gospel so they don't take away your Bible they don't burn it they don't forbid you to read it they just crucify the effects of it and this is why brother brandham as a prophet of God to the the seventh angel indicted this generation that's right he did it for crucifying Christ the second time right and he took the scripture you know there they crucified him he said there in Jerusalem they the most holy people so the most holy city the most holy people crucified the most awful death him the Prince of Life and he said they're doing the same thing now listen the the the G the Jewish age ended out with the crucifixion of Christ the Gentile age ends with the crucifixion of Christ but you cannot crucify the man and back to that the matter you know they loved the word they did they were so careful with the you know so careful with it I mean if they messed up one little bit and had to scratch something out the whole thing was burned it had to be written copied perfectly they knew it so well it said that they could roll up their scroll and run a pin through it and tell you which one what words it went through they loved the written word but they hated the word made flesh the man of Galilee today it's the opposite come on Amen what will they do they love the man of Galilee oh Jesus oh Jesus the love the lovely kind wonderful Jesus but they crucify his word how do they do it by denying its parts and removing Parts Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments I love God brother de well keep his Commandments this is how we know you love God you keep his Commandments well I tell you I don't think it matters about my hair well okay you don't love him that's your problem you ever get in love with Jesus things about the word come on will no longer be be questionable is that right now so again you know brother brandham in the indictment he said today where they're taking some man's word which is a lie in the way of death and refusing to take the way of life God's word I condemn this generation I indict it in the word of the Lord that they're wrong they're guilty of crucifixion or trying to crucify the spirit they call reev for Revival everywhere and how you going to have a Revival when the word itself can't work through the people I like for someone to answer that for me how can you can it do it when you deny the very Revival itself well did the prophet speak of them forms of godliness their own forms back there denied the Word of Life their own forms today deny the same thing that can bring them a Revival their Creeds and forms yes sir they take the denomination and their Creeds instead of the word and that crucifies his word and makes his word of no effect to the people when they see the word of God so vividly and just Place itself that God made the promise that he would do that and here he's doing it and they make fun of it and get away from it it's blasphemy they try to crucify the word itself how why do they crucify they can't crucify the word no more they can crucify God they could crucify the body that held God the Son of God they could crucify that but they can't crucify God he had to be that time on account of being the sacrifice to bring in many sons that predestinated to eternal life they had to do it then but they can't do it now they can't do it for the word itself will live on what did they do how did they do they form what are you saying preacher how you building your platform that they're they crucify him then they're crucifying the effects of the Gospel upon the people by their Creeds that's the crucifixions that's where the public sets in these big mors called churches denominations draw lines of a Creed and the the word of God can't have an effect upon them because they would condemn the very things that Christ said would take place it just don't come according to their Creed oh they have crucify ified the effects of the word They Crucified how do they crucify the word when Jesus said that he's the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 138 they say in such a way he is and Jesus said his last commission to the church go into all the world go into all the World Mark 16 preach the gospel these signs shall followed them that believe and all the world and every creature in had half reached yet and there's a million do every year that don't never heard the name of Jesus so it's still the general orders it is still a commandment of God Amen all the world and preach the gospel to every creature that he that believeth and his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe watch now in my name they will cast out Devils amen they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it shall not harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and they say that was for that generation and they make the Commandment of God of none effect of this and they crucify the effect of the word to the people so we come right on down and then you hear no more prayer lines and you you he people's never seen one people's never been a part of one people's never experienced it laying on of hands it's just a tradition where you where you pray to God for Providence or God's Will and and you just offer encouragement you know that that's that's what happens today when many times when prayer is given for those that are sick they're just offering encouragement and asking for God's will to be done there's no expectation of healing because the days of its past now I want you to say it's not a tradition it is I'm what shall I say it like this I want to correct that I want to say it's not just a tradition it is a principal doctrine of the church and it's something Jesus commissioned not only for the apostles but for believers to do these signs shall follow them that that are Apostles that are the original 12 that believe amen wherever I can find faith and this is what Jesus said will I find this ingredient Faith now so it's not it's not just a tradition it's a principle doctrine of the church let me just say it this to you you because we we who have the full word because all the Seven Seals are open we are the only ones that can truly fulfill the Great Commission I mean listen invisible Union of the Bride brother Brandon said they they cannot this generation cannot fulfill the Great Commission because they cannot take all the word they cannot take the opening of these seals that open up all the word they can they part but you can't fulfill the Great Commission because Jesus said this gospel this gospel must be preached in all the world and then shall he end come now brother badam tells the me in the message earnestly contending for the faith and he said he says let me die the death of the righteous and let my li in be theirs you may not know it but in this meeting while he's in somebody takes a a model plane of some sort that's motorized and flies it through there to try to cause a a distraction while right while he's preaching this and he says he's preaching let me die the death of the righteous let my last end be as theirs and that ought to be the goal of us let us die the death of the righteous let our last end be as theirs if anything let us be like that first church amen a book of Acts church amen the original gospel with the original word look at that little remnant of people down to the age look at it wind its way to the of the Bible that little church always rejected look at the other side so close would deceive the elect just as fundamentally right just as perfect fine churches keeps the doctrine of the Bible so soall they do it they go out and say yes sir we believe in the birth of Jesus Christ we believe that he was a virgin born son of God we accept him we have faith in him that's good why brother it's by faith you're saved is that's right but listen if in accepting of your faith God confirms your faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you say you believe and don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you do not your faith isn't accepted in the sight of God you've got a mental Faith instead of a heartfelt Faith a heart Faith that's right and when you truly believe God God is under obligation to pour the Holy Ghost on you and then if he does pour the Holy Ghost on you say well I got the Holy Ghost too well if you do you're bound to believe in the Supernatural signs and wonders because you added to it that's the faith or you say oh no I don't believe in Divine Healing I don't believe in all that rocket and carrying on and believe in all that shouting and praising God and crying tears running down your cheeks and think I don't believe in all that and I know there's no such thing as that it shows you haven't got it that's exactly right and he talks about balum fundamental in writing his Doctrine was was Moses each one of them offering their sacrifices and seven altars and so on and he said but Moses had healing and signs and a big Pillar of Fire hanging over him Hallelujah I hope you get that a pillar of fire hanging over him signs wonders Miracles everything going on Divine Healing glories of God and the other side didn't have it though they were just as fundamental as others is that right that's what it is having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away I want you to turn with me to Matthew chap 23: 13 in here Jesus speaks seven woes against the religious systems of that day and in this verse it tells of one of them says woe to you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites now this is a new word used in that day Hypocrites Jesus used it it was a Greek word hypocrite originally had a good meaning we don't think of it today that a Hypocrites good meaning but in that day it was an actor so an actor was acting out Parts on the stage he was called a hypocrite that was that was the name for actors Hypocrites Jesus said you actors yeah you're you're scribes and Pharisees you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven remember now the Kingdom of Heaven is what righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost so it's the Holy Ghost so you shut up the Holy Ghost against men for you you will neither go in yourselves and neither will you allow them that are entering to go in so this is what J Jesus indicted that generation for in that day he said it was because they shut up the holy ghost from men and they wouldn't go in it themselves neither would they allow those others to go in now so this is where brother brandham is saying it has been closed up at the doors of Creeds and dogmas you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men you keep the holy ghost from moving from filling from baptizing come on Church from delivering from healing from casting out Devils from speaking with new tongues come on this is what you do I mean even against preaching we're told now today we're preaching just push play because why men are trying to shut up the kingdom of God they're trying to keep the holy ghost from moving but I'll tell you what friends for me the Holy Ghost has been released amen it's no longer bound it's been released Hallelujah as brother Brandon said it's been bound up now for all of these years but now by the evening time message it's being released it releases to bring forth Deliverance healing miraculous salvation now in the seed of discrepancy which is a 65 sermon one of brother bram's last his last year upon the Earth and I always say the last things that the seventh angel was imparting to the church it was the message of Jesus Christ remember it wasn't his message he was a messenger so the Bible said to the angel of the Church of leoda which is Angelo's messenger and he says now this is Harvest Time at the beginning when God sowed his seed upon the Earth and gave it in the hearts of his children his family to keep that word that was their only defense keep that word and here come the enemy in and broke that barrier by sewing the seed a discrepancy contrary to the word of God and if that was discrepancy in the beginning it's still anything that add to the word of God is still seed of descri y I don't care where it comes from it's from organization from military sources from political Powers anything contrary to the word of God is seed of discrepancy and when a man stands and says he is a gospel preacher and says the days of Miracles are passed that is seed of discrepancy and when a man stands and says he's a minister pastor of a church somewhere and he does not believe that Jesus Christ is the same in every detail except the physical body same yesterday today and forever that's the seed of discrepancy when he says Miracles and Apostolic age passed that is seed of discrepancy when they say there's no such thing as Divine Healing that's seed of discrepancy and the world is full of it and what's now what's the statement it crowds out and chokes out the wheat so just as one shuts the door just as those the those Bound in the river just as those Bound by Creeds and dogmas here the seed of discrepancy is planted to choke the wheat from coming to its fullness now I want I want to say it's not true that only the prophet could have perfect Faith it's just it's just faith that may have started out to be as Tiny as a grain of mustard seed and and it wasn't perfect but then it had the potential to become a mighty tree and mean you know there's been a serious misunder understanding the perfect faith we we know without perfect faith we can't go into Rapture however the faith that we have that we have can be perfected so whatever faith you have this morning can be perfected amen so again it it has to be the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that's why Malachi 4 was sent to perfect our faith Amen to turn us from unbelief back to Faith again to the faith once delivered to the Saints or quoting brother Brams to the original Pentecostal Doctrine word by word so first of all what is perfect Faith it's not super duper unattainable Faith it's simply your god-given faith tuned to Perfection perfect faith is your god-given faith tuned to Perfection you know brother Brandon talked about his own gift he said now many of you say well I believe I believe i' I've got all the faith in the world he said you don't he said you think your way up here but your way down here and he said what my gift does by Discerning your heart and shows you that Jesus is the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of in eternity of of your infirmity he says it Tunes your faith to where it it matches God's promise and he said it brings it from down here to up here to the level of the word so you can have faith even a sinner can have faith brother Brandon would say that's good faith for a sinner right amen you know here they were believing but again then he would get them to accept the Holy Spirit and he says now I call you he said now sister go receive what you have asked for he said you notice I called her a sister what was it because here she was a sinner but here in the presence of God I'm not talking about brother brandom I'm talking about the presence of God in the presence of God there when her heart was discerned and she knew God was present and she repented of her sin it tuned her faith to where she was no longer a sinner but a sister it can happen in a service just like this you can be sitting there a sinner and the word go forth and tune your faith and habits of the world drop off and cigarettes and alcohol and everything else can happen amen now so you see it's not perfect faith is not a super duper unattainable Faith it's simply your god-given faith tuned to Perfection where that you receive then what you have asked now how do you tune your faith as I said brother bradam would would do that to show that God was was present and and also as I said it happens when the word is preached when your faith agrees completely with God's word word and it dovetails with the word that's perfect Faith that's when your F faith is made perfect amen now so this misunderstanding has been taught that if you truly have faith well you don't need a prayer line you don't even need to come no you come for prayer when your faith you have faith but it's imperfect to make your faith perfect it's an action that shows or demonstrates that you believe the prayer of faith will save the sick and God shall raise them up sure if your faith was perfect then no prayer is needed for you would have what you asked for right see brother Brandon said if you had perfect Faith you'd look right straight to God and believe it walk away you never need nothing of even coming to a prayer line you have no need of these things because your faith has already made it so and then others will come along and say well if you have the third pull then then you don't need don't even need a prayer line you know how wrong is that when when the third P's Vision when the very vision of the third pull showed a prayer line being formed and called and you know the third po then would operate in that prayer line as they pass through the little room now I know that's Greek to some of you that don't know the visions of brother Brandon's but you know you'll get it just hang on we you know maybe there'll be something else you'll get today but anyway coming for up for prayer and and even forming a prayer line it is an obedience to the word it is part of the Great Commission for they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall cover amen now brother brandham brother brandham said this says Lord Jesus as these people come May the power of almighty God Quicken their faith immediately as they pass by in Jesus name so this was his expectation he was expecting Faith to be quickened as it come through the prayer line now I realize that laying on our hands is a Jewish tradition so well W it up throw it away it's a Jewish tradition well what is a tradition a tradition is a long established or inherited way of thinking or acting that has passed down from generation to generation so it's a long established way of thinking for example the Jews did it they laid on hands to confer or to bestow a blessing upon another and and they also would would would be commanded to take and the priest would lay his hands on a goat that would be the sacrifice and what he was doing there by that he was he was placing a placing God's righteous curse on the animal instead of the sinful people and they would do it when they were pronouncing a blessing on another they anointed their Kings they laid hands on the priesthood they blessed others by laying on of hands so it's a long established way of thinking or acting passed down from generation to generation that's what laying on the hands is it is a Jewish tradition so is it a Bible tradition it's something something handed down from the scripture from generation to generation so it's a Biblical tradition not just Jewish Jesus did it Peter did it Paul did it come on I wanted to say to you all Traditions are not wrong for example here's a Christian tradition that we learn from Jesus and that is to bless our food as as he took bread and blessed it all Christians do that don't they Paul taught us to do the same thing he dealt with the judaizers who wanted to keep them them to keep the Old Testament law and and and forbid them to eat certain meats and so on in 1 Timothy 4:3 he said they commanded them tostain from Meats which God created to be received with Thanksgiving which of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the word of God and prayer and if we thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good Minister the of Jesus Christ nursed up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine where unto thou Hast attained so you see as Christians we keep this tradition Jesus did it Paul did it Paul taught it and we do it you know brother brandham talked about it himself he said you welcome him in your house and let him be the Unseen guest you sit in that down at the table then and never even thank him you eat without even thanking him for it he said I see many Christians never return Thanks so they're just like a hog under an apple tree hog can sit under apple tree you know and eat apples and those apples fall from the tree and beat him on the head he never looks up to see where they come from and brother Brandon said that's the way that people will become in the last day unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers and continent Fierce despiser of those that are good and and headyy and high minded and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof so you see that that that that is a tradition I'm just showing you it is a tradition that we do just one of the many now so the Jews believed and laying on our hands and in Matthew 918 when when there was a certain ruler came and worshiped him sayeth my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand on her and she said live so this was this was the Jews understanding this is a long tradition I know this I just come and lay your hands confer a blessing that's right by laying on our hands confer a blessing but the Gentiles showed that there could be healing without hands laid on because he said I'm a centurion and he said I I I he didn't have the way of the thinking of the Jews he didn't have that long-term tradition come lay hands so what did he do he said just speak the word and my servant will live and by doing that he demonstrated that g greater Faith than even that of Israel you see because he believed the word could go forth and heal without requiring the physical presence of Jesus but the word would go forth in the of the spirit and heal even without a physical touch now Jesus taught by by tradition by example and we inherit this tradition from Jesus or this way of acting From Him Luke 4:40 when the sun was setting and all they that had that was had any sick and diverse diseases brought they to him and he lay laid his hands on every one of them and healed them you see this happened over and over and over again in Jesus ministry now he didn't do it once he did it over and over and then he commissioned Believers to do the same thing so we learn to do it from Jesus example but I also want you to know it's a doctrine of the true church so in Hebrews 6 verse one therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ Paul is saying I'm going to leave these principles of the doctrines I'm teaching I'm going to go now into deep Waters and teach you about MDC and these others he's not saying we don't do these anymore he says now in my teaching we are going to advance beyond the doctrine of Christ we're going on into Perfection I'm going to teach you some deep Mysteries now of MDC and and the sacrifice and the blood and all of these things and he says let us go into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from uh uh from dead works and of Faith toward God and and of doctrines of baptism and of laying on our hands and on Resurrection of the dead and on eternal judgment he says you know I'm I'm not going to be teaching on that now we're moving on in our in our teaching our discourse on the Hebrews and what I'm going to do is we're going to go beyond this part but here I'm going to go beyond these fundamental doctrines and I'm going to take you over into the deep Mysteries of the priesthood and of MDC and how Jesus fit the the order of mzc because he wasn't a Levi and could not be a priest at in the order of Levi of the aonic priesthood he was of the tribe he of Judah himself so he could not be that but he was of the order of MDC a spiritual priesthood but I want you to know I want you to know that here the Paul said the principal doctrines that we have is repentance Faith baptism laying on our hands resurrection of the Dead and eternal judgment so it is a Doctrine laying on the hands is a doctrine that rates right up with repentance Faith water baptism resurrection of the Dead Eternal judgment it R right with that it is a Doctrine a fundamental doctrine of the church oh we're beyond that brother Tim we're in the third pull no we're never beyond that we are [Music] commissioned by the third pull message to fulfill the Great Commission they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now so not only is it a principal doctrine of Christ but he commissioned us to do it when he gave the Great Commission and said this is what Believers will do Believers will cast out Devils do you know do you know that's Healing The Sick every time that we pray for the sick we're casting out Devils so well brother Tim many will come to me in that day and say have I not I've done it but he said also you're going to do it sure impersonators come this is what PE people can't get it in their brain just because just because impersonators are doing things doesn't mean we're not to do it they're mocking us they're impersonating us you said wow brother Jim false anointed ones at didn't time yeah but the anointing is true and it wasn't sent for them he was sent for the [Applause] elect brother Bram said you know it's not the anointed is false it's the Holy Ghost that's right well who don't want that I want it it's for the wheat it's for the grain so what if it falls on the on the unjust that don't make it wrong so what if they shout and rejoice the say it doesn't make it wrong I'm still going to shout and rejoice so what if they misuse it and they try to build kingdoms with it so what it is for us it's for our children it's for them that are far off it's for as many as the Lord Our God shall call hide behind these that want to keep the door closed oh you you you you may be one of those you dece the very elect now dece the very elect no the elect not going to be deceived come on read the Bible the elect will not be deceived it can only do that if it were possible but it ain't possible we are predestinated not to fall we are predestinated to overcome in this [Applause] age let me just tell you from my personal experience I sat there I sat there as a young boy in brother Brandon's meeting in his last prayer line that he would ever have last public one anyway cuz I don't know what he did privately but the last public prayer line that he had on the wings of a snow white dove I saw him lay hands on the sick I saw him pray the prayer of faith you tell me we're not to do that no more we're not to have a prayer line we're not to lay hands on the sick I don't know what department of demons you came from but you're not welcome here amen amen I I've seen it I saw it manifested now you see I was there I you can't it's kind of arue hard to argue with somebody was there you know I've been an advocate and I tell you to do it start with ver this the time follow the message all the way through you'll have a complete different Viewpoint of it you'll see as brother Brown built thoughts and the Holy Spirit would correct things people expect a prophet to be infallible he wasn't infallible he was a man if he's infallible he's God that's right but there's a evil spirit in this message that wants to make him infallible so you know brother brandham would be corrected by the Holy Ghost and and you have to catch those things you have to see where he turned made and and and turned a corner but I was listening along to brother brandom years ago I was listening reading at the same time studying it out hearing listening at and reading at the same time exercising ears and eyes trying to get as many senses glued in on it to not miss it and as I did I'd run up to brother Bram he'd say well you know my old Pastor used to teach he used to teach that now Billy I'll tell you here's the way it was you know we're Baptist and we believe in baptizing everybody's got to be baptized and we believe in baptizing we believe in immersion that was a Doctrine they didn't do it right but they believed at least in immersion they baptizing titles and he said said of course when brother Brandon want to be baptized he said you baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said I'll do it so he he was he said now Billy we're Baptist and he said um here's what happened that day on the River Jordan said there Jesus you know had to fulfill all righteousness so you know it was a righteous thing to be John to be baptized and John hadn't been baptized neither had Jesus so when Jesus B was baptized he then baptized John and brother brandham said well that was good Baptist teaching Doctrine but it wasn't that wasn't right said Jesus did not baptize John and I said well you know scripture doesn't say that it doesn't say that he baptized John but it's reasonable John need to be baptized too well you know going to fulfill all righteousness isn't that reasonable so you know I I would say yeah this is what brother brandham said but how did he know I mean the Bible doesn't say one way or the other how does he know I'm not doubting him I'm just wondering I mean where do we place this and so I put on another tape and after another and then he'd come on he'd bring it back up again and he'd say the same thing over again and he said NOP Jesus did not baptize John my old Pastor Baptist but he had it wrong I said Okay I I I believe that but how do you know I mean John needs to be baptized too so Bible doesn't say one way or the other so you know it's reasonable I mean give it to the old Baptist pastor it's reasonable you know but so how do you know I mean you got one man's word and another man's word and of course you know this is a prop you know this a't so you certainly ain't doubting him but yet you're wondering then I put on another tape and he said very emphatically again Jesus did not baptize John and I stopped the tape and I said how do you know and I pushed the button again he said because one day in the vision I saw the whole thing Hallelujah you can't argue with somebody that was there God was able to take him by Vision set him down on the river of Jordan see the holy VI that's you see we are not following kindly divis fables but this has been revealed and by the angel of God the pillar of fire as he said when he finished up the seals them revelations in the Pres of that Pillar of Fire so now can't argue with me I was there you know let's go to James 5:14 James 5:14 and I'm quoting brother brandom he says it is a Divine remedy for your sickness if you'll accept it as God's remedy so I'm going to read you God's remedy the Divine remedy for your sickness watch this is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he's committed sin they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed and again here watch this the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man aileth much now I'm trying to tell you today you as a Believer can pray the effectual fervent prayer amen and it avails much because he didn't say the apostles he said righteous come on Amen the righteous man his prayer availeth much well you say but I made too many mistakes that's where the blood comes inall amen sure we have many mistakes we do things wrong we have to ask for forgiveness we we we have to say God I you know help me to overcome that let me rise above it but again brother bradam reads this John 5 5:14 he said that's the duty of every Christian minister every minister of the Gospel has a right to pray for his congregation they have a right to believe God and be healed Divine Healing doesn't belong to one man or one group it belongs to all the people the gift of healing was not given to be sent out to to have different healing campaigns across the country it's all right for them to be but that isn't the purpose there ought to be a healing campaign in every Church all the time going on everywhere amen and let me tell you the reason we call for so someone a righteous man to pray with us is because there's power in agreement Matthew 18:18 whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven and again I say to you if any if two of you shall agree on Earth touching anything that that they that they shall ask it shall be be done for them of My Father which is in heaven then he goes on to say where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst Hallelujah so there's power and agreement Paul it was Moses that would say h you know one man will chase a thousand and but two will put 10,000 of flight so there's a power when Believers come together and they believe it's important for atmosphere to be right listen healing can be on the soul that's salvation that's where many times where we cast out Devils out of the Soul healing can be on the body healing can be in the spirit that's the mind the attitude the atmosphere of your life may not be a physical thing could be a mental thing it's spiritual Devils come drive you to Suicide drive you to thinking wrong driving you to grudges or to hatred or whatever that's spiritual in the mental in the spirit realm your body Spirit soul soul once it's saved even if you go mentally insane you're still saved well I know that person I thought they were Holy Ghost feeling they killed theel well they went insane and didn't Chang their Destiny God didn't take away his salvation but now I'm just going to tell you I wouldn't I wouldn't choose that for a way out do you can you imagine could you imagine me standing there before God and God saying okay Tim why are you here well I chickened out it's too hard after I went to the Cross well you quit why did you quit Tim why'd you give up why'd you think it was too hard well I was just overcome what when I gave you the Holy Spirit to overcome [Applause] with and you did this because of a selfish motive cuz you come and turned Inward and was so self-centered it was all about you that you forgot about all the others you would wound and hurt now I'm make it to Heaven I ain't saying you didn't and I don't saying you won't but I am saying this you're going to give an account and when I when I do I want don't want God to say Tim you did really well but you wound up a quitter rather than trusting on me you just try to take a easy way out for yourself you were selfish s because you're self-centered you looked on your own self and your own ways don't do that brother brandom said in Easter seal this is a 65 sermon now if you're sick will you lay hands on one another let's pray just lay your hands on somebody by you regardless of what's wrong with you have faith now if I ever told you the truth I tell you now Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe you're Believers you just raise your hand don't doubt there's some poor suffering person that's you got your hands on somebody has got their hands on you remember that quickening power that power that raised up Jesus from the grave now you have faith in what you got in your own body it's going to help that person you got your hands on if it indwells you it'll also Quicken your mortal bodies so again you know in the sermon Messiah is great sermon if You' never listened to it 1961 sort brother Bram said he he told of a report of where scientist actually took an x-ray where a minister was laying hands on the on the sick and praying for the sick and it showed by x-ray a light transmitting from the one praying to the sick and then God's provided place of worship brother brandom said a 65 sermon he said said Grant now that quickening power will Quicken their Faith Lord to what they're going to going there is there is Believers got hands on a Believer a body to a body a power to a a power and it's the power of God by a Son of God or a daughter of God by the Son of God oh God May Satan turn this people loose may they be healed this afternoon by the resurrecting power quickening power of the presence identified Christ in the name of Jesus Christ may it be so you may wonder what does our dirty hands have to do with Healing The Sick well I'll tell you you know preaching is not just expounding the word it's demonstrating the gospel the Bible said in Corinthians 12 for one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another word of knowledge to by The Same Spirit another Faith by The Same Spirit to another Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another working of Miracles to another prophecy to another deserting of spirit to another diverse kinds of tongues to another interpretation of tongues but all these that all these work at that one and selfs Same Spirit dividing to every man severly as he will but what does our dirty hands have to do with Healing The Sick well you see the work of Jesus was to lift the soul of man from The Curse of sin and to take men who were born in sin shape in iniquity and make them by of the power of creation make them sons of God with power and authority against the satanic rulers of this world when you pray it literally is spiritual warfare It cast out Satan's kingdom it cast out Devils now though the what that man but through what was the dirty hands of a now transformed man or woman God's power can be transferred through those hands to someone oppressed by the devil and actually cast Satan out hands I want you to get this hands that once did Evil hands that once the devil used hands that once held a cigarette or alcohol or lifted drugs to the to the mouth amen are hands that caressed another in fornication those hands oh Hallelujah now redeemed can lay hands on another and Cas cast Satan out and heal The Afflicted that's the power of the blood brother brandham said in this message God's provided place of worship 65 sermon your hands on the people has got quickening power in them stop it just a minute what did he say about you you're not your own you've been bought with a price your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost know you not the spirit of God dwelleth in you and brother Brandon said your hands on the people has got quickening power in them if you've been quickened have you come to life has Christ become real to you has the power of God been manifested are you the in that church God's provided Church how are you in it how do you know you've been quickened in it your whole thoughts your whole being is in Christ now and Christ is in the midst of the people proving himself alive proving that he's here at the days of Sodom with them hand with them hands of these people that that lives that have been changed from Street walkers from drunkards from prostitutes on the street to genuine saints of God Quicken their hands are laying on you there in the church by Holy Ghost baptism the same power that was upon Elisha's Bones the same power is laying in your shoulder upon your hands upon your heads that that same quickening power with him standing in here proving that he's alive from the dead shows that he's alive here not doing the same things he did and prove it's the truth can you believe him now can you believe that them hands laid upon you are Godly hands can you believe that Spirit that's quickening us now making us act crazy the world do you believe that that's his quickening power and I plead this portion of the tape for myself or the sermon and he said you can and and you can actually hear them people screaming and shouting on the recording and he said you believe that's his quickening power that's making you act crazy to the world and do you believe you're in his church then if you are believe that those hands that are laying on You Are Holy hands commanded by God then I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to stand your feet and accept your healing he said you realize you've been raised from Death to life and has been baptized into the body of the Living God that's quick in your body where they is speaking in tongues interpreting tongues and and seeing Jesus manifest Among Us why sickness could not stand in such a group as this let your faith go to him believe him say Lord I believe with all my heart and you'll be made well amen they're not dirty hands no more amen Paul said to Timothy and Timothy 1 Timothy 2 and8 I desire therefore men pray everywhere lift it up holy hands the Bible calls you as a Believer having holy hands them are God's hands to work through Jesus can't come and do what he did on the shores of Galilee and walk down and lay hands on the sick but he has your hands come on now he has your hands amen and through you he can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover oh yeah see they're not dirty hands anymore for I was made in his likeness I was created in His image you see I was born but when I was reborn sure enough I was born to serve the Lord and I can't deny him I will always always walk beside him for I was born to serve the Lord my hands they were made to help my neighbor my eyes were made to read God's word my feet were made to walk in his footsteps and my body is the Temple of the Lord Amen brother bramman future home said Satan come out leave every sick persons is in there in the name of Jesus Christ holy hands that's been redeemed because they believe the word and our attributes of God's thoughts now them hands is upon each other you can't hold them any longer Hallelujah he speaks of him s he said I had a friend a minister that supported the meetings and a and a big wall fell on him while he was doing work and and masked him down and his liver was mased and and and busted his spleen knocked out of place and tons had Fall Fallen fallen on him he said honey said if Jesus was here you know what he would do he this man when he sponsored me he was sponsoring Jesus and he said I believe that word he was he was sponsoring Christ when he sponsored me and he said that's a trick of the devil and if Jesus was here he would go lay his holy hands upon him and that boy would get well I don't care if his liver is versed I don't care the circumstances he get well cuz Jesus walking there knowing exactly who he was knowing his calling knowing his SC the scripture knowing who he was what he was no Shad down out he' lay hands on him said Son be well there wouldn't be enough devils in hell to kill that boy he'd get well he said but see honey he's talking to his wife that was Jesus and those were holy hands the holy hands of God I'm a sinner and I was born sexual birth my mother and father were Sinners and I'm just a no good nothing but you know what if God would give me a vision he said I'd go right down there lay my hands on him and he'd come out if he gave me a vision and I began to think he said but now you see it's the same dirty hands anden the same man praying for him the same dirty hands and I began to think I'm his representative then God doesn't see me that blood of that righteous one lays up there on the altar makes intercession for me he's my sufficient he's my life the only thing that make me put my hands on him with faith was because I had V faith in the vision but without the vision the same Faith would do the same thing as I reckon myself nothing and reckon him my all in all he's my commissioner no denomination sent me he sent me Hallelujah I go in his name I lay hands on him I walk down there and lay my hands on that boy and in that midnight he was in the meeting well Hallelujah why his thinking got changed and that's the way you've got to begin to realize friend you're not a slave to sin that's not who you are you're a new creature in Christ amen and maybe you can't have Aion but with the same faith in the word of God as a Son of God you can go and lay hands on the Zink and they shall recover Hallelujah brother Brandon said what would what would we do we transmitting our faith the Unseen power of God that's exactly right friends we're here in the last days brother brandham had this experience of this scripture he said there was a super anointing came every time a super anointing came on me and I spoke squirrels now remember he didn't just go out there and say I you know I want this I want that and do things by whim God told him to do it what are you looking for what are you doing I'm hunting what do you need how many you need I need three speak it storm same thing speak it had he writes speak it God told him to you see it isn't human mind going around doing what their own whims are is people walking in the spirit and as he walked in the spirit a super anointing came on him that's what comes with this message amen that's what accompanies the the the the the word that has been revealed in this day you see God showed him in there the power of the spoken word and demonstrated that power it showed him the power of the word I I keep tell telling people all the time speaking squirrels speaking to the storms speaking speaking to hatti right's Children uh speaking to the tumor and his wife all those things none of them was the third pull that was manifestation of the third pull the third pull was the opening of the word if you have the word come on now amen if we've received the word we have that third phase of it we are in that third phase we're not over in the first pole of his healing campaign we're not in this prophesying times we're right here where the word has been revealed and in that word there is power it'll heal your sick come on now it'll raise the dead to life yes it will it will save you're lost amen it will it will vanish tumors in a moment the word the word that we have received has that kind of power in it but what would happen a super anointing come down oh God that's what we need we need that super anointing that would come down it happens every once in a while not near enough do August the 10th 2015 I stood in ICU waiting room with my wife's when she had her first brain bleed my children gathered around looking at the concern on their face I just began to talk and I trying to console them as a daddy would I said now children we've been taught to believe when things like this happen I said you know that's what we do we don't fear we believe I say like brother John le said you know when I asked him could he do this or that he said yeah yeah I'm a you know that's what I do I'm a carpenter I I can do that talking in his Minnesotan language and I and and I said see I said we are believers that's what we do when moments like this come we believe and we're going to believe we're not going to fear

came to my office said I met a man who said he would help us go to Japan so well you know how it is probably won't give $300 and at that moment something rose up in me I said no he won't give $300 he will write this church a check for $10,000 to send all of you to Japan plus he will write another check that will pay for your personal experiences while you're gone and the next the next Sunday he walks back in without asking for it a check for $110,000 and received another check for $3,000 to pay his own expenses while he was away I don't know how and I don't know when but I'm I'm fully
