[39:36] I'll just I pray you'll be patient with

[39:47] get there eventually but I want to look
[39:49] here and I want to also give it a
[39:50] subtitle nothing can separate the seed
[39:52] from the promise now the seed being the
[39:56] thought
[39:57] original thought the promise being the
[40:00] Fulfillment
[40:01] so nothing can separate the original
[40:03] thought from the Fulfillment
[40:06] so I want you to bear that in mind as we
[40:08] speak tonight and we look here God said
[40:10] let us make man in our image after our
[40:12] likeness and let them have dominion over
[40:14] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[40:16] the air and over the cattle and over the
[40:18] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[40:20] creepeth upon the Earth God created you
[40:22] to be a ruler
[40:24] to have jurisdiction
[40:27] over animal life and not only over
[40:29] animal life but this animal life
[40:31] and we find that so God created man in
[40:34] his own image in the image of God
[40:36] created he him
[40:37] male and female created he them let's
[40:40] look here in Ephesians 1. we're going to
[40:42] look here in verse 4.
[40:44] we'll look at verse 4 and verse 5 then
[40:46] we'll turn to Romans 9 6 to 8.
[40:49] Ephesians 1 and verse 4 says according
[40:52] as he has chosen Us in him before the
[40:54] foundation of the world
[40:58] that we should be holy Without Blame and
[41:01] that word blame there or Without Blame
[41:02] means without blemish as we heard about
[41:04] that on Sunday faultless unblameable
[41:07] before him in love having predestinated
[41:10] us unto the adoption of children by
[41:12] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[41:15] good pleasure of his will notice it's
[41:17] his good pleasure
[41:19] to adopt you
[41:21] to predestinate you to his to his
[41:24] sonship or to sonship look here in
[41:26] Romans 9 and verse 6.
[41:32] Romans 9 and verse 6 not as though the
[41:35] word of God had taken on effect
[41:37] for they are not all Israel which are of
[41:41] Israel
[41:42] neither because they are the Seed of
[41:44] Abraham are they all children but in
[41:48] Isaac shall thy seed be called
[41:51] that is they which are the children of
[41:53] the flesh these are not the children of
[41:55] God but the children of the promise are
[41:58] counted for the seed God bless you you
[42:00] can have your seats tonight
[42:03] just to kind of look back over our last
[42:05] thought that we spoke we looked at
[42:07] election and we look here in Romans 9
[42:08] and verse 8 the Bible says for the
[42:10] children not yet being born
[42:13] neither having done good or evil that
[42:16] the purpose of God according to election
[42:18] might stand not a works But A Hymn that
[42:21] calleth and this word election is the
[42:24] act of God's Free Will by which before
[42:26] the foundation of the world he decreed
[42:29] His blessings on certain persons it's
[42:32] the act of picking out our choosing
[42:34] notice it's God's election that we're
[42:37] here tonight it's God's choosing he
[42:39] doesn't choose US based on our abilities
[42:41] or our inabilities he doesn't choose US
[42:44] based on how fit we are our how unfit we
[42:47] are how intelligent we are how
[42:50] unintelligent we can be see God has
[42:53] chosen US based on election and that's
[42:57] God's choosing God's sovereignty on his
[42:59] own and we think about brother bam tells
[43:01] us now he says after the interlude of
[43:03] Destruction the wiping off of The World
[43:06] God
[43:08] excuse me hold on
[43:11] he said God started the people out again
[43:13] he found the man by the name of Abraham
[43:15] his he was his father was Hiram and he
[43:18] come down probably from Babylon he was
[43:20] an idol worshiper from shine already
[43:22] dwelt into child dear the city of Earth
[43:24] and he married his half-sister but
[43:26] notice they came down here and they came
[43:28] into a land and this land was full of
[43:30] all kind of other people and brother bam
[43:32] says Abraham wasn't any better than
[43:34] anyone else
[43:36] but God by Sovereign Grace and election
[43:38] called Abraham according to election
[43:41] that is not a thing that Abraham was any
[43:44] better than anybody else see don't even
[43:47] say he was a Believer but in the
[43:48] beginning God with this unmerited Grace
[43:51] Abraham was saved and Not only was he
[43:54] saved but when God called Abraham he
[43:57] saved him and he gave him his Covenant
[43:59] unconditionally
[44:01] and he says now he says now Abraham is
[44:03] not what certain things that you do it's
[44:05] not Abraham you do this and I'm going to
[44:08] do this he told Abraham it's going to be
[44:10] an unconditional Covenant I've already
[44:12] done it not that you got to read so many
[44:14] scriptures in the morning or or at night
[44:16] losing so many sermons God says I've
[44:18] already done it I've already called you
[44:20] I've already saved you I've already
[44:22] predestinated you I've already elected
[44:24] you already chose you it's not anything
[44:27] that we have to do with it it's God's
[44:29] election and God's grace and he says
[44:31] when you get that thinking thinking that
[44:33] without any marriage without any
[44:35] anything God's covenant was
[44:37] unconditional to Abraham God told him he
[44:40] saved him and not only Abraham but his
[44:44] seed
[44:46] come on sons of God come on seeds of
[44:48] Abraham it wasn't just to Abraham that
[44:51] it was an unconditional Covenant but to
[44:53] you tonight the same Covenant that was
[44:56] bestowed upon Abraham is bestowed upon
[44:59] you tonight and you can't separate the
[45:02] seed from the promise
[45:04] God has given you a promise tonight that
[45:07] you are Sons and Daughters of God
[45:11] he said it in God by solving Grace and
[45:14] election not because that Abraham was
[45:17] was better than anyone else but because
[45:20] God by election for a nation called
[45:24] Abraham
[45:27] Abraham was just an ordinary man just
[45:30] like you and I
[45:33] no supernatural abilities just had
[45:36] enough Faith to believe
[45:39] not Mr America or Mr ciao DIA
[45:42] but he had enough Faith to believe
[45:45] the Bible says that Abraham's staggered
[45:48] not
[45:49] at the promise
[45:52] what about the seeds of Abraham tonight
[45:54] do we look at our wish sons of God that
[45:57] we stagger not at the promise
[46:00] to Caesar Abraham looking at the
[46:02] promised word to be fulfilled not in
[46:05] tomorrow not in yesterday but in our day
[46:08] at this moment this service in our life
[46:10] In This Very event right now God is
[46:13] calling the people that's going to
[46:14] manifest himself and be the bring the
[46:17] Fulfillment to the word to this age and
[46:20] I'm talking to seeds of Abraham tonight
[46:22] and you can't separate that seed from
[46:25] the promise of fulfillment
[46:27] God is going to have sons and daughters
[46:31] notice now he says it's by Sovereign
[46:34] Grace and election not because that
[46:36] Abraham was better than anyone or or was
[46:39] better than anyone else but God by
[46:42] election for nation called Abraham
[46:44] Abraham was just an ordinary man had
[46:47] nothing to do with it neither have you
[46:49] got anything to do with it neither have
[46:52] I got anything to do with it it's God's
[46:54] business to make the choice
[46:56] I say thank you God you made me your
[46:59] choice
[47:00] come on you may be having a rotten day
[47:02] today but thank God you made me your
[47:04] choice you may be down in the MoneyGram
[47:07] today but thank God you made me your
[47:10] choice when I didn't feel like it when I
[47:12] didn't act like it when I've been taught
[47:14] like it God you still made me your
[47:17] choice
[47:18] I say oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[47:20] tonight let you be able to make you look
[47:22] at Monday morning in the face say I got
[47:25] this because my God made me his choice
[47:27] oh my God's bigger than my tomorrow
[47:32] Hallelujah
[47:34] see it's God's business to make the
[47:36] choice not him that willeth or him that
[47:38] running but it's God they showeth mercy
[47:41] and he says all together by election
[47:46] see now God made his Covenant with
[47:48] Abraham absolutely unconditional
[47:51] you know brother Mike I'm glad that that
[47:53] same Covenant applies to me tonight
[47:56] because there's days I don't feel saved
[47:59] but it doesn't do away with the Covenant
[48:03] it doesn't annihilate the promise
[48:06] he doesn't eradicate that I've been
[48:08] called it doesn't stop the fact that
[48:10] I've been chosen by God see because it's
[48:13] an unconditional Covenant there was no
[48:16] ifs ands about it the Covenant was
[48:18] absolutely had no strings attached to it
[48:21] at all and Abraham had nothing to do
[48:23] with it
[48:25] God was so determined that he was going
[48:27] to save Adam's Fallen race and so he
[48:29] made a covenant with Abraham
[48:31] unconditionally not if you'll do
[48:33] something but I have done it
[48:37] Hallelujah
[48:39] what about your sons and your daughters
[48:41] what about those prodigals I have done
[48:44] it
[48:46] come on moms and dads grandparents oh
[48:49] you're worried about the prodigal but
[48:50] God's already said it's an unconditional
[48:53] Covenant to the seeds of Abraham
[48:56] you got to claim them as seeds of
[48:59] Abraham and when you claim them and you
[49:01] believe it for him let me tell you every
[49:03] gun in hell is going to be trained on
[49:05] you but Abraham staggered not at the
[49:07] promise of God through unbelief and you
[49:09] couldn't separate the seed from the
[49:11] promised word and you can't separate
[49:14] this bride from the promised word
[49:17] she is gonna come forth this word will
[49:19] be made manifest in her life
[49:23] and in your prodigals
[49:28] not if you do something but I have
[49:30] already done it
[49:35] you know you say well if God will make
[49:36] that Covenant with me
[49:38] the program says he didn't only make it
[49:40] with Abraham but his seed after him
[49:44] oh my
[49:47] god let's help you look at Thursday
[49:48] morning with a bright eye
[49:50] notice you say well I if I was a Jew it
[49:54] doesn't take a Jew outwardly
[49:56] hourly is not a Jew see it's a Jew
[49:59] inwardly for if we are dead in Christ we
[50:02] take on Abraham's seed
[50:04] and notice and we're heirs according to
[50:08] the promise
[50:11] oh don't you just love how God just
[50:14] dovetails it all together
[50:15] heirs and this word air I'll get to it
[50:18] here in just a little bit but just think
[50:20] about it the same way God called Abraham
[50:22] the same way God chose Abraham it's the
[50:25] same way that God called you tonight the
[50:28] same way God chose you tonight look you
[50:31] you got your faults you got your mishaps
[50:33] but yet God called you tonight not by
[50:36] anything that you've done not by how
[50:38] good you are how good looking you are
[50:40] how tall and skinny or short and fat you
[50:43] are it doesn't have any bearings on it
[50:45] at all how much descriptions you read
[50:48] how many sermons you listen to it has no
[50:50] bearing on the fact at all before you
[50:53] was even able to read or write God
[50:55] already called you God already told you
[50:57] God already put your name in the last
[50:58] book of life it's already there it's a
[51:01] finished work Church
[51:02] God's already done it by his election
[51:08] see it's by not what we do but it's what
[51:11] he has already done for us
[51:14] not I'll do something God says I've
[51:16] already done it
[51:19] so a lot of us can make a mess of our
[51:21] own life because we want to take the
[51:22] steering wheel away from God
[51:24] because like hey let me drive
[51:27] let me drive I know your life better
[51:30] than you know your life and every time
[51:32] you take the steering wheel away you end
[51:34] up in a ditch
[51:37] but God says I got it I know the end
[51:39] from the beginning I know hot off I know
[51:42] how it all plans out
[51:44] God knows see we're already called
[51:46] church already Chosen and it's an
[51:48] unconditional Covenant how can you lose
[51:55] how can you lose
[51:57] and we come dragging in
[52:01] I don't know my plate brother Joe
[52:04] how can you lose
[52:07] you're sons of God you're elected of God
[52:10] called of God chosen of God you can't
[52:13] lose no matter how low you get tonight
[52:16] you can't lose because God came loose
[52:19] and you can't separate the seed of God
[52:21] from the promise of the Fulfillment
[52:23] there's no losing to it you've already
[52:26] been declared the Victor church God's
[52:29] already declared I'm going to have a
[52:31] bride with thou spot without wrinkle
[52:34] without blemish oh she's gonna be
[52:37] perfect and I'm gonna bestow upon her
[52:39] all by adoration and all my Splendor and
[52:43] all my praise let me tell you you may
[52:45] not look like it tonight but that's who
[52:47] you are
[52:48] your Road in God's Splendor tonight
[52:55] and we think well I chose God
[53:00] 15 16 says you have not chosen me
[53:04] but I have chosen you and
[53:07] I've ordained you that you should go
[53:11] and bring forth fruit God is looking for
[53:13] fruit out of your life
[53:15] God is looking for fruit
[53:17] bear the Christian Life
[53:20] bear signs and wonders bear healings and
[53:23] miracles and they're Supernatural not
[53:25] just oh I believe God sent a prophet
[53:28] that's just making an announcement but
[53:30] God is looking for you to bring forth to
[53:33] Bear he has ordained you he's ordained
[53:36] us as his bride to bring forth his life
[53:40] that that seed that was there that he's
[53:42] placed there that thought that God had
[53:44] of you is going to come to manifestation
[53:46] and there's going to be an overcoming
[53:48] life match the word of God now it's
[53:51] going to be a young boy young girls
[53:53] young people in this house that's going
[53:55] to overcome The Temptations of laodicea
[53:58] why because the word has already been
[54:00] declared that he's going to have a bride
[54:02] he's going to have a young person he's
[54:04] going to have a single wife or a single
[54:06] mother he's going to have somebody
[54:07] that's going to rise up in Satan's
[54:10] eating and take God and his word
[54:13] and they're going to become the
[54:15] Fulfillment of that word
[54:17] notice he says you've not chosen me in
[54:19] that word chosen there means to pick out
[54:21] for oneself
[54:23] God chose you for himself he didn't
[54:26] choose you to share you with the Devil
[54:31] you know sometimes
[54:34] two girls can like the same guy
[54:37] and two guys can like the same girl or
[54:39] three or four
[54:41] but not that way with God
[54:44] chose you for himself he's a jealous God
[54:49] he's not sharing you with anybody or
[54:52] anything
[54:54] and so God chose you you didn't choose
[54:56] God and therefore even when you make
[54:59] mistakes
[55:00] you're still chosen
[55:02] you mean brother Joe even when I don't
[55:04] feel like I'm safe you're still chosen
[55:07] even when you hit the bottom of the
[55:09] barrel you're still chosen
[55:11] even with things like your prayers don't
[55:13] go past a roof you're still chosen
[55:17] see it has nothing to do with it you and
[55:19] your mistakes has nothing to do with it
[55:21] all your ups and downs has no bearing on
[55:24] God's choosing he already chose you and
[55:28] declared you to be seeds of God
[55:33] well bam I like the way he says his
[55:35] hearing question his answers 1959 note
[55:37] he said he loved you I say hallelujah
[55:40] come on I need y'all to be working with
[55:42] me this evening now come on this is good
[55:43] stuff I know I've been on it quite a
[55:46] while but let's just get on let's just
[55:47] get behind it look he loved you a
[55:49] Hallelujah he loved you before there was
[55:51] a world he knows your nature Oh you mean
[55:54] God knows my nature yeah he knows it he
[55:57] knows your nature he knows your weakness
[55:59] he knows your habits he knows all about
[56:01] you what you was going to be and then
[56:04] when he looked all over the great
[56:05] Universe he said I Choose You Anyway I
[56:08] said oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[56:10] in my lowest moments God knew my nature
[56:13] and yet he chose me brother Mike
[56:15] God knew the nature I would have he knew
[56:18] the temper I would have he knew the
[56:19] things I would struggle with with my
[56:21] whole weakness and yet God looked all
[56:23] over the great universe and he says I
[56:25] chose you Joe Adams turn your car around
[56:27] get back home go back to the father's
[56:30] house you wasn't meant for the chicken
[56:32] yard but you are meant for my heaven you
[56:34] was meant for a Heavenly place I caused
[56:37] you to be Brian I called you to be
[56:38] chosen elected of God
[56:41] thank you
[56:44] looked all over
[56:46] and he says I chose you
[56:49] oh my
[56:51] I don't know what you're going through
[56:52] today but you're chosen
[56:55] think about it he knowed the nature
[56:59] that you were born with
[57:01] I want to look at this just for a minute
[57:04] because not all of us had the same
[57:05] nature
[57:09] is that all right
[57:11] see God knows how matter of fact you are
[57:16] he knows how temperament or
[57:19] temperamental Moody you are
[57:23] he knows what kind of temper you possess
[57:26] he knows also if you're Meek humble
[57:29] gentle loving caring God knows all that
[57:32] about you see that's your nature that's
[57:34] your Human Nature
[57:36] but I want you to realize God put that
[57:38] in the seed
[57:42] and every seed is going to bring forth
[57:44] of its kind but notice we're not all
[57:47] going to bring forth of the same nature
[57:51] and you look we do I do
[57:54] I'm just going to be honest and
[57:55] transparent man you see somebody like a
[57:58] brother John Andes hope bless God I want
[58:00] to be like that upbeat happy positive
[58:03] all the time
[58:04] man I've tried I fake it till I feel it
[58:07] and I still don't feel it
[58:09] they say fake it till you make it well
[58:11] I'm batting zero brother there there's
[58:13] only one brother John
[58:15] but you see something somebody else and
[58:17] you begin to desire to be like that
[58:20] and again guess what happens you begin
[58:23] to despise who you are you begin to
[58:26] despise the nature in which God has
[58:28] given you but I want you to know tonight
[58:30] in Psalms 139 verse 13 says for thou has
[58:35] possessed my Reigns thou has covered me
[58:37] in my mother's womb I will praise thee
[58:40] verse 14. for I am fearfully and
[58:43] wonderfully made
[58:45] oh Hallelujah with that temper you're
[58:48] still fearfully and wonderfully made
[58:51] even with that meekness and that
[58:53] gentleness where people can run ramrod
[58:55] all over you you're still fearfully and
[58:57] wonderfully made and what you find will
[58:59] Satan will anoint that human nature and
[59:02] he'll get you to say things that you
[59:04] wish you would never have said
[59:06] or hurt people that you didn't intend to
[59:09] hurt
[59:11] that's why the Bible says You must be
[59:14] born again
[59:15] so you got to bring that nature
[59:18] that nature you can't do away with that
[59:20] nature God put that nature in the seed
[59:23] it's got a purpose it's going to bring
[59:25] honor it's going to bring glory to God
[59:28] we're in that nature has been brought
[59:31] subject to the word and you take that
[59:34] same nature hot tempered I know none of
[59:36] y'all here got a hot temper
[59:39] no no no none of y'all screw them
[59:43] shoulders back come at me like that not
[59:45] y'all this is even like Tabernacle we're
[59:48] gentle doves
[59:51] but you take somebody's got a fiery
[59:53] nature and a strong disposition and you
[59:56] let them get converted and God begin to
[59:58] anoint that same nature that the devil
[1:00:01] used to cause hurt and destruction God
[1:00:03] will anoint that nature and make a
[1:00:05] prayer Warrior out of them God will make
[1:00:07] him somebody that he's Relentless in the
[1:00:09] face of the enemy he's Fearless in the
[1:00:11] face of devil why because he stands on
[1:00:13] the same word God put that there to
[1:00:16] bring glory to himself because it's
[1:00:19] God's nature
[1:00:20] God's possessing God bringing forth
[1:00:23] attributes of himself
[1:00:27] so don't despise
[1:00:30] to Nature you have
[1:00:32] just bring it subject to the word
[1:00:36] I think I've shared this time or two my
[1:00:39] mom told me when I was 23 or 21. she
[1:00:42] said Joe you're going to be in jail or
[1:00:44] you're going to be in prison
[1:00:46] that's the same thing you're going to be
[1:00:47] dead excuse me are you going to be in
[1:00:49] prison by the time you're 23 years old
[1:00:52] because of my fiery disposition
[1:00:56] because I didn't back down
[1:01:00] but when God got a hold of that life
[1:01:03] I don't back down off a promise
[1:01:07] and let me tell you church that same
[1:01:09] nature don't despise it you're fearfully
[1:01:12] and wonderfully made
[1:01:14] God made you in such a way that only you
[1:01:17] can bring honor from your life
[1:01:20] and God's not going to share it with
[1:01:22] anybody or anything now we find here
[1:01:25] let's keep going on if we don't we okay
[1:01:28] yeah I got plenty of time
[1:01:30] says now this these elect are not only
[1:01:34] the Eternal thoughts of God which were
[1:01:36] to be expressed in their flesh notice in
[1:01:39] the flesh in their due season but these
[1:01:42] same elected are called by another name
[1:01:45] Romans 4 and verse 16 would tell us
[1:01:48] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[1:01:51] by grace to the end that the promise
[1:01:55] might be sure to all the seed
[1:01:58] not to that only witches of the law but
[1:02:00] to that which is also the faith of
[1:02:01] Abraham who is the father of us all
[1:02:04] Romans 9 and verse 17.
[1:02:07] neither because they are the Seed of
[1:02:09] Abraham are they all children but in
[1:02:12] Isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:02:15] see that is they which are the children
[1:02:16] of the flesh these are not the children
[1:02:19] of God but the children of the promise
[1:02:22] are counted for the seed
[1:02:25] the children of the promise what promise
[1:02:29] I will have a son
[1:02:32] let us make man in our image in our
[1:02:36] likeness
[1:02:37] God's desire as we heard just briefly
[1:02:40] again we're going to hear a lot tonight
[1:02:41] where brother Tim spoke again on Sunday
[1:02:43] because we're kind of Crossing uh
[1:02:45] channels here but see God had a desire
[1:02:48] to have a family
[1:02:50] and you're that family
[1:02:52] you're part of it and all your mistakes
[1:02:56] and all your failures and all your
[1:02:59] peculiarities and all our corpse and
[1:03:02] everything that we have to offer God yet
[1:03:04] God has chosen us and it's that we're
[1:03:07] the children of the promise
[1:03:10] because God's promise brother would tell
[1:03:12] us in Israel in the church number one he
[1:03:14] said the children of the promise promise
[1:03:16] what what kind of promise that kind of
[1:03:19] that God promised before the foundation
[1:03:22] of the world he called them that's the
[1:03:25] seed
[1:03:26] before the foundation when were you
[1:03:28] chosen
[1:03:31] oh did y'all not hear that question
[1:03:34] when were you chosen before the
[1:03:36] foundation of that was not a trick
[1:03:38] question I promise you that was hey
[1:03:40] that's open book
[1:03:42] before the foundation of the world not
[1:03:45] because you quit doing this and quit
[1:03:47] doing that quit lying quit stealing
[1:03:48] those are just more moral acts well a
[1:03:51] good citizen will do that you can't tell
[1:03:53] yourself you're a Christian yet until
[1:03:55] something here has happened until you've
[1:03:57] been regenerated something that's
[1:03:59] happened in here notice Children of the
[1:04:02] promise promise what that God said I'm
[1:04:04] going to have a son let us make men in
[1:04:06] our own image God having Sons and
[1:04:09] Daughters who would not be conformed to
[1:04:11] this world but they're going to be
[1:04:13] transformed by the renewing of their
[1:04:15] mind when the word comes forth they
[1:04:18] receive the word and the word begins to
[1:04:21] work and their mind drops into their
[1:04:22] heart and life begins to manifest what
[1:04:25] does it manifest it's manifesting the
[1:04:27] life that was in the seed the entire
[1:04:29] time
[1:04:31] that's why you can believe
[1:04:34] see the Promise
[1:04:35] to the seeds of Abraham Brothers tell us
[1:04:38] now if you and Galatians where he says
[1:04:40] this in the Smyrna Church age Galatians
[1:04:42] 3 and verse 29 and if God if you be in
[1:04:45] Christ then are you Abraham's seed
[1:04:49] and your heirs according to the promise
[1:04:52] that word air there means you're a
[1:04:54] sharer
[1:04:56] oh
[1:04:58] Sheriff
[1:05:00] that means you're an inheritor
[1:05:02] it means you are a possessor
[1:05:07] now let's read it like that if you be in
[1:05:10] Christ then are you Abraham's seed and
[1:05:13] you're a sharer of the promise you're an
[1:05:16] inheritor of the promise you're a
[1:05:18] possessor of the promise
[1:05:21] if you're Abraham's seed you can't
[1:05:24] separate the seed from the promise
[1:05:27] whoo
[1:05:30] see then here we come into this
[1:05:32] consolation as the Eternal logos God was
[1:05:35] manifesting the son and in Jesus
[1:05:37] throughout all the fullness of the
[1:05:39] godhead Bali can we say Amen to that
[1:05:43] and that Eternal one was the father
[1:05:46] manifesting the Flesh and thereby gained
[1:05:49] he the title of son
[1:05:52] but we're not going to finish we're not
[1:05:54] going to stop reading listen to what he
[1:05:55] says next even so we
[1:05:59] Eternal in the thoughts in our turn
[1:06:02] became the many membered-spoken word see
[1:06:05] manifest In the Flesh and those Eternal
[1:06:08] thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are
[1:06:11] the sons of God even as we are so called
[1:06:14] we did not become seen by the rebirth we
[1:06:18] were seed therefore we could be reborn
[1:06:22] come on Church why are you here tonight
[1:06:24] they chose that you are sea and he goes
[1:06:27] on to say in non-seed there is nothing
[1:06:30] to Quicken
[1:06:34] see that's the reason why you can catch
[1:06:36] the word is because you're seed
[1:06:38] that's why you can believe this message
[1:06:40] is because you were seed you are seed
[1:06:43] the reason you stopped drinking and and
[1:06:45] smoking
[1:06:46] and partying and living that life that
[1:06:49] old life is because you are see the
[1:06:51] reason why you can pack up and leave
[1:06:53] your family leave your friends leave
[1:06:55] everything you've ever known and come to
[1:06:57] a place where they preach the fullness
[1:06:59] of the word is because you are seed
[1:07:04] see because in non-seed there's nothing
[1:07:07] to Quicken
[1:07:09] so aren't you thankful
[1:07:11] that that old nature that you had
[1:07:14] crabby
[1:07:16] always depressed always down
[1:07:19] always temperamental
[1:07:23] aren't you glad it could be reborn
[1:07:26] oh that was a weak amen for some of
[1:07:28] y'all
[1:07:30] my my
[1:07:32] man I'm so glad
[1:07:34] I'm so glad none of y'all knew me before
[1:07:36] I came to this church
[1:07:38] you will see the a huge contrast brother
[1:07:42] Mike of what standing before you today
[1:07:45] versus what I was 20 30 years ago
[1:07:48] see I'm so glad that old nature no
[1:07:51] longer has jurisdiction over my life
[1:07:54] see because I was a seed because you are
[1:07:57] seen you could be reborn you can you
[1:08:00] could be quickened because seeing
[1:08:02] non-seed there's nothing to Quicken see
[1:08:05] Nazi can dress herself up
[1:08:08] they can go to church
[1:08:10] they can sing the same songs they can
[1:08:12] raise their hands and worship they can
[1:08:14] Cry tears but in non-seat there's
[1:08:17] nothing to Quicken and you find Nazis
[1:08:20] will begin to officially walk out quit
[1:08:23] coming to church because why there's
[1:08:24] nothing there to Quicken but in that
[1:08:27] predestinated sea God put a seed in
[1:08:30] there a German life and when that life
[1:08:33] comes in contact with the word oh let me
[1:08:36] tell you the word begins to respond and
[1:08:38] that life begins to be quickened by the
[1:08:40] word of God
[1:08:43] for the man would tell us the word can
[1:08:45] only recognize the word
[1:08:49] why are you here tonight
[1:08:51] it's not because I'm your favorite
[1:08:52] preacher
[1:08:54] no because the word in you has
[1:08:57] recognized the word for this hour
[1:09:00] and it responds no matter who's
[1:09:02] preaching the word in your response to
[1:09:05] the word of this hour
[1:09:08] that's why we're here see it can't
[1:09:10] recognize a denominational or a
[1:09:12] perversion it knows better it's the word
[1:09:15] it can only recognize the word a week
[1:09:19] can only be a wheat
[1:09:23] oh my
[1:09:25] see it started off as a wheat it'll
[1:09:27] always be a wheat it may be a small
[1:09:30] wheat but it's still a wheat
[1:09:32] we got a lot of Wheats here tonight
[1:09:35] cream of the crop not all of us are the
[1:09:38] same size we but I want you to know
[1:09:40] right now A Tear can never be a wheat
[1:09:43] that we're rejoices with the same rain
[1:09:45] though it lifts His Hands Up In Christ
[1:09:47] it will never be a week let me tell you
[1:09:49] always was a wheat you always was a Son
[1:09:53] of God quit looking back at your past
[1:09:55] great worrying about yesterday and all
[1:09:57] your mistakes and look with what God had
[1:09:59] called you a promise is to be a son A
[1:10:03] promise is to be a daughter of God A
[1:10:05] promise is to be that Pride with that
[1:10:08] spot without wrinkle Without Limits The
[1:10:12] Promise is to be changed in the moment
[1:10:14] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:10:19] see if we can never be a wheat
[1:10:22] I'm not calling you a weed
[1:10:25] so get that out of your head
[1:10:29] yet it's water by the same anointing
[1:10:31] but it ain't wheat
[1:10:35] see God knows exactly where
[1:10:38] you belong
[1:10:41] why are you here
[1:10:42] Why'd You Come From the state of
[1:10:44] Washington

[1:10:50] Texas
[1:10:53] why'd y'all come from Arizona
[1:10:55] why why did y'all come from Washington
[1:10:57] because God knows exactly
[1:11:01] where
[1:11:03] you need to be
[1:11:05] for what purpose so that that seed
[1:11:08] can begin to be nourished
[1:11:10] built up in the life that was inside of
[1:11:13] that seed it always was
[1:11:17] it was always there you didn't get that

[1:13:33] 3 and verse 1.

[1:13:41] this for a minute
[1:13:42] behold
[1:13:45] God's telling you stop what you're doing
[1:13:47] allele to see you behold
[1:13:50] what manner of love the father has
[1:13:54] bestowed upon us
[1:13:56] somebody needs to be waving their hand
[1:13:59] mama that's me
[1:14:01] there it is right there the father has
[1:14:04] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:14:06] called sons of God
[1:14:10] see therefore the world knows us not
[1:14:12] because it knew him not but see beloved
[1:14:16] notice verse 2.
[1:14:18] beloved now
[1:14:23] come on now
[1:14:26] not tomorrow
[1:14:28] not next week
[1:14:30] not when you get saved not when you get
[1:14:33] filled with the Holy Ghost but even
[1:14:35] right now are we the sons of God and it
[1:14:39] does not yet appear what we shall be but
[1:14:41] we know
[1:14:42] I said we know we got a word we got a
[1:14:45] promise that's declared to us what it
[1:14:47] will be when we come into the
[1:14:49] manifestation of sons of God we got a
[1:14:53] promise and the seed is already there
[1:14:55] and you can't separate the seed from the
[1:14:58] promise
[1:14:59] oh you say brother Joe but you said if
[1:15:02] we don't have the Holy Ghost yet you're
[1:15:04] still a son
[1:15:06] but when you get that Holy Ghost
[1:15:08] that seed begins to manifest
[1:15:12] it begins to be quickened she does
[1:15:14] quickening power in this word
[1:15:17] there's quickening power in this message
[1:15:19] you know Jesus has been dead over 2000
[1:15:21] years
[1:15:23] but people are still being changed by
[1:15:24] this book
[1:15:26] you know brother Brandon's been off the
[1:15:28] scene 58 years almost 60 years but yet
[1:15:30] this message is still transforming Lives
[1:15:33] why because there's quickening power in
[1:15:36] the word
[1:15:37] you know there was a time there was a
[1:15:39] prophet called Elisha he's done so many
[1:15:41] miracles and he was one Miracle short of
[1:15:43] doing Twice The Miracles that Elijah
[1:15:44] done and he died and he rotted his skin
[1:15:47] fell off his his bones and they threw
[1:15:49] him in a grave but one day
[1:15:52] one day the children was in a battle and
[1:15:55] they had a man that died and they drug
[1:15:56] him so far and they finally choked him
[1:15:58] into the grave and let me tell you they
[1:16:00] didn't throw him in there long enough
[1:16:01] because they mean he come up out of the
[1:16:03] Grave why because they were still
[1:16:04] quickly in power on those bones what am
[1:16:07] I telling your church I'm telling you
[1:16:09] tonight there's quick and Power in this
[1:16:11] word
[1:16:12] we're gonna preach quick and Empower

[1:16:18] we're going to believe by quickly and
[1:16:20] Power

[1:16:25] God
[1:16:29] now
[1:16:32] so quit putting it off to tomorrow
[1:16:35] I want you to believe it right now I'm a
[1:16:37] son of God
[1:16:38] you may have made some bad mistakes
[1:16:40] today well screw yourself back
[1:16:43] get up and do it again
[1:16:48] now at this present time
[1:16:51] we are to be expressing the thoughts
[1:16:53] that God had of us
[1:16:56] thoughts
[1:16:57] that originated
[1:16:59] before the foundation of the world
[1:17:02] now are we the sons of God quit dwelling
[1:17:05] on your mistakes
[1:17:08] well you know brother I come to church
[1:17:10] and I want to do this and I want to do
[1:17:12] this and I want to do this and I can't
[1:17:13] do nothing

[1:17:27] am
[1:17:29] I'm a son I'm a seed
[1:17:31] I'm a thought Eternal thought of God

[1:17:37] in hell
[1:17:38] there's not one trial there's not one
[1:17:40] situation there's not one circumstance
[1:17:43] there's nothing that can separate us
[1:17:46] from what the promise of God
[1:17:49] of God the Bible says nothing can
[1:17:51] separate us from the love of Christ

[1:19:43] nobody said Amen to that one did they
[1:19:47] you know we're going to make mistakes
[1:19:50] we're not going to do it willfully
[1:19:52] but you're going to make mistakes even
[1:19:54] being filled with the Holy Ghost you're
[1:19:56] going to do things
[1:19:58] that if you're not careful would be
[1:20:00] considered sinful
[1:20:02] but the Bible tells us in First John 3
[1:20:05] and verse 9 whosoever is born of God do
[1:20:08] us not commit sin
[1:20:11] for his seed remaineth in him he cannot
[1:20:15] sin because he is born of God
[1:20:18] you don't commit sin you make a mistake
[1:20:21] you fall you come short of the glory of
[1:20:24] God but you get back up you're quick to
[1:20:26] repent he said father I'm sorry I did
[1:20:28] that and you call that person on the
[1:20:30] phone he said I'm sorry I said that I'm
[1:20:33] sorry acting like that I'm sorry I made
[1:20:35] that bad business decision I'll make
[1:20:37] those things right
[1:20:39] it won't hold over you you cannot sin
[1:20:41] because the seed of God remains inside
[1:20:45] of you
[1:20:48] brother them tells us in Hebrews chapter
[1:20:50] 7 he said the believer can't sin
[1:20:52] certainly not the seed of God the
[1:20:54] blessing of God remains on him
[1:20:58] see God can't see nothing but the blood
[1:21:00] of his own son no matter what it is in
[1:21:02] the church what it is God don't see it
[1:21:04] because Jesus is making intercessions
[1:21:07] constantly
[1:21:08] the high priest no way for him to sin
[1:21:12] when such a sacrifice is laying there
[1:21:14] for him like that now I'm not giving you
[1:21:15] a a privilege to go out live any way you
[1:21:18] want I'm not saying that at all
[1:21:20] but I'm saying a Son of God a real born
[1:21:22] again son and daughter of God they don't
[1:21:24] commit it they don't willfully go
[1:21:26] looking for sin their minds are not
[1:21:28] willfully going to that that internet
[1:21:30] site and clicking on and doing they may
[1:21:32] get trapped
[1:21:35] but they're not willfully doing it
[1:21:37] because the brother says if you're
[1:21:39] willfully doing it then you ain't been
[1:21:40] changed yet
[1:21:42] so let's make sure we draw that but the
[1:21:44] Bible says once purged by the blood they
[1:21:47] remaineth no more desire
[1:21:50] see because there's a seed on the inside
[1:21:52] and that seed is declaring you different
[1:21:54] than the world
[1:21:56] you know how many of you when you were
[1:21:58] young
[1:21:59] children maybe Elementary School and
[1:22:01] kids will do things and you couldn't do
[1:22:03] it because it just bothered you
[1:22:07] only two three of us okay well maybe
[1:22:09] we'll have a meeting when we're done
[1:22:11] but you know there's things other people
[1:22:12] could do but you couldn't do brother bam
[1:22:15] said because that life that germ was
[1:22:17] always there
[1:22:19] it wouldn't even allow you as a child to
[1:22:22] do things that others were doing
[1:22:24] I wish it would have kept me from a lot
[1:22:26] of the things that I did but praise God
[1:22:28] had kept me from doing a lot of things
[1:22:29] that I didn't do
[1:22:31] because the seed was already was there
[1:22:33] but sometimes I walked over it sometimes
[1:22:36] you walked over it sometimes you were
[1:22:39] going to do what you want to do but it's
[1:22:40] because you were going to be the man of
[1:22:41] your own ship
[1:22:44] oh but there's a captain
[1:22:47] there's a captain
[1:22:49] when you realize you're tired of running
[1:22:51] that ship of ground
[1:22:52] Lord get me out into some deep seas and
[1:22:54] let's set sail I thank God for that
[1:22:57] tonight notice now he says now then
[1:22:59] after a while you heard the gospel
[1:23:01] maybe you went to church you picked out
[1:23:03] this and that and you went from the
[1:23:05] nomination to the nomination but one day
[1:23:07] you being a part of God you had to be a
[1:23:09] part of the word and when you heard the
[1:23:12] word
[1:23:12] you know where you come from you know
[1:23:15] what the truth you always notice that
[1:23:17] you were always deceit was always in you
[1:23:21] the words seemed the word that was in
[1:23:24] you that was before the foundation of
[1:23:26] the world saw the word and you come to
[1:23:29] it
[1:23:31] brother Johnny
[1:23:33] the word was always there
[1:23:36] now I know a little bit you told us your
[1:23:37] testimony many years ago
[1:23:39] about the life that you live but there
[1:23:41] was the word was always there and when
[1:23:44] that word that was here came to the word
[1:23:48] that was there you that word came to
[1:23:51] that word
[1:23:52] and now you don't live the life that you
[1:23:55] used to live
[1:23:56] can I get a witness somebody
[1:23:59] oh I can declare it to you brother help
[1:24:01] maybe the same thing for you tonight
[1:24:03] when that word came to this word this
[1:24:07] word came to that word no longer we
[1:24:09] can't be Earthbound chickens going
[1:24:11] around clucking around in denominational
[1:24:13] pest house no why because we've heard
[1:24:15] from our mama bird we've heard from Mama

[1:28:42] because when you got it it's eternal
[1:28:46] see there's the difference when you got
[1:28:48] it

[1:29:28] you know I'm gonna keep preaching some
[1:29:30] of y'all gonna go out here you go like
[1:29:31] you know what I really believe what bro

[1:29:44] just need to be encouraged you just need
[1:29:46] to keep hearing it and keep hearing it
[1:29:47] and then finally something drops down
[1:29:49] and you start really believing I am what
[1:29:52] the word says I am now because brother
[1:29:54] Joe said it but because the word has
[1:29:57] already declared it I am a Son of God I

[1:30:34] and you square them shoulders back
[1:30:37] come on devil
[1:30:38] I was born for this purpose
[1:30:42] this is who I am
[1:30:45] that nature
[1:30:46] that disposition
[1:30:48] quit letting the devil anoint it
[1:30:51] bring it subject to the word and let God
[1:30:54] bring Glory from your life
[1:30:56] let God bring honor he put it there
[1:31:00] to bring himself honor you know what

[1:31:19] but who I am
[1:31:21] I want to be the best who I am I can be
[1:31:26] he said bro Joe you you mean you got to
[1:31:28] work at that that means I got to bring
[1:31:29] myself subject to it
[1:31:32] means I got to get into the word daily
[1:31:34] I got to pray I got to have a prayer
[1:31:35] life I got to have a time of devotion
[1:31:37] with God so that I can know who I am
[1:31:40] and when you know who you are then you
[1:31:42] know who you are not
[1:31:45] and I'm trying to declare it to you
[1:31:46] tonight who you are not
[1:31:48] you always was
[1:31:52] you all with brother man says when Paul
[1:31:54] this great Theologian when he came face
[1:31:56] to face with the word Jesus quickened it
[1:32:00] he quickened this seed that was in
[1:32:02] Paul's like a man who persecuted the
[1:32:04] church see your past has no bearing over
[1:32:06] your future
[1:32:08] he was always a son and he was always a
[1:32:11] prophet
[1:32:13] he was always the first church age
[1:32:15] messenger though he did things you don't
[1:32:18] think the devil reminded him
[1:32:21] of Stephen
[1:32:23] when he stood there and watched this
[1:32:26] saintly Son of God be stoned to dead for
[1:32:29] a stand
[1:32:31] probably wasn't a day that Paul didn't
[1:32:33] go by for what the devil reminded him
[1:32:35] look what you did you allowed this you
[1:32:38] instigated this
[1:32:40] but Paul said I bring my body under
[1:32:43] subjection daily
[1:32:44] to not let my past Define my tomorrow
[1:32:48] I'm recognizing who I am and I'm also
[1:32:51] recognizing who I am not I recognize who
[1:32:53] I belong to and I also recognize who I
[1:32:55] don't belong to
[1:32:59] see
[1:33:02] Titus 2 and verse 13 my I got so much
[1:33:04] here I might have to have part eight
[1:33:09] let's go to Colossians 1 and verse 21.
[1:33:11] and you
[1:33:13] that were sometimes alienated and
[1:33:16] enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet
[1:33:19] now
[1:33:20] hath he reconciled
[1:33:23] that's everybody in this room tonight
[1:33:26] now hath he reconciled we were alienated
[1:33:30] we were aliens in our minds by Wicked
[1:33:32] Works evil desires the first nature or
[1:33:36] that nature that was unconverted
[1:33:39] well yet once that nature comes on
[1:33:41] subject to the word
[1:33:42] reconciled to God God can make a
[1:33:45] glorious Redemption out of it and use it
[1:33:47] for his honor look at Paul
[1:33:51] Paul's temperament
[1:33:54] somebody like Paul he persecuted the
[1:33:56] church so for uh so vigorously And yet
[1:33:59] when it came time to establish the
[1:34:02] Church of God
[1:34:04] man Paul reared them shoulders back and
[1:34:06] he was relentless
[1:34:08] he went through shipwrecks he went
[1:34:10] through scourges he went through this he
[1:34:12] went through that he went through it all
[1:34:13] but he declared the name of Jesus
[1:34:16] see the nature was always there
[1:34:19] but he just had to get it converted had
[1:34:22] to get it under subject to the word
[1:34:23] program says now notice redeem needs to
[1:34:26] buy back see it restores to the original
[1:34:28] owner God by his death the shed Blood
[1:34:31] Bought back his son he bought back the
[1:34:35] spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my
[1:34:38] voice the word and they follow me you
[1:34:41] always were a sheep
[1:34:45] you never were a pig
[1:34:48] you never was a dog turned into a sheep
[1:34:52] you always was a sheep
[1:34:58] so quit going around identifying
[1:35:02] as a pig
[1:35:04] we got kids so they they can identify as
[1:35:06] cats and dogs in school
[1:35:08] go send them a little tray over there in
[1:35:10] the corner and they can go do their
[1:35:11] business they're a cat
[1:35:13] give them some kitty litter
[1:35:16] and Satan will want nothing more than
[1:35:18] sheep sons of God to go
[1:35:21] and identify themselves for something
[1:35:24] that you are not
[1:35:26] and I'm here to tell you I'm going to
[1:35:28] keep preaching until you really believe
[1:35:29] it you are sons of God let that be your
[1:35:34] identification
[1:35:36] put the token on display
[1:35:39] your shoulders back
[1:35:42] it's time to believe it's time to have
[1:35:44] faith time to rise up
[1:35:47] program said it's not the person that
[1:35:49] comes predestinated from God but it's
[1:35:52] the word or the seed that is it now
[1:35:55] let's go on down so I can try to wrap
[1:35:57] this up I'm gonna just cut it short
[1:35:58] sorry Church
[1:36:01] the Bible tells us in Romans 8 and verse
[1:36:04] 20 verse 29
[1:36:07] for whom he did for no
[1:36:10] he also did predestinate
[1:36:12] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:36:17] that he might be the firstborn of my
[1:36:19] many brother moreover whom he did
[1:36:21] predestinate them he also called those
[1:36:23] he called he justified to whom he
[1:36:25] justified them he also glorified see
[1:36:28] those that God had for knowledge of he
[1:36:31] predestinated that word for knowledge
[1:36:33] means God had a relationship with you
[1:36:36] you were in his thinking in his thought
[1:36:39] process
[1:36:40] so that takes us back to Genesis 20 20
[1:36:43] Genesis 1 26 let us make man in our
[1:36:47] image and our likeness see we're
[1:36:49] predestinated to be conformed
[1:36:52] to the image of his son
[1:36:57] I want you to believe it
[1:37:00] I want you to believe it that's who you
[1:37:02] are
[1:37:04] that should be your aspiration
[1:37:07] I'm gonna match that word
[1:37:12] that word before you go to bed at night
[1:37:13] you get on your knees and you pray to
[1:37:15] God God I want to match that word when
[1:37:17] you get up in the morning before that
[1:37:19] footsteps off that bed God let this be
[1:37:21] the day that I match that word Let There
[1:37:24] Be overcoming quickening power
[1:37:26] Supernatural Revelation strike me today
[1:37:28] let me live as a son of God
[1:37:32] that I can declare and manifest you to a
[1:37:36] dying generation
[1:37:37] notice what he says now oh my church
[1:37:40] he goes
[1:37:42] many are called but few are chosen
[1:37:46] and you are chosen
[1:37:48] and you were chosen and you were chosen
[1:37:51] and you were chosen many are called but
[1:37:54] few are chosen
[1:37:56] see the difference
[1:37:58] chosen the word means for God's Own
[1:38:01] purpose
[1:38:02] God chose you because you are the ones
[1:38:05] he's making his family with
[1:38:08] no matter
[1:38:09] what nationality or authenticity
[1:38:12] whatever it may be that we come from
[1:38:14] whether we're black yellow blue green it
[1:38:16] doesn't matter to God
[1:38:18] already saw us
[1:38:20] and he put us in his great bouquet
[1:38:23] with all our peculiarities and natures
[1:38:26] and he says that is going to be my
[1:38:29] family
[1:38:31] that and when one flower starts to wilt
[1:38:34] there's going to be others there to
[1:38:36] encourage it see God's Got Confidence in
[1:38:38] the seed that he put inside of you
[1:38:40] sometimes you don't have confidence in
[1:38:42] yourself but God does
[1:38:44] like brother Timothy spoke the other
[1:38:46] night God is faithful when we're not
[1:38:48] faithful
[1:38:49] thank God that God is let me say this
[1:38:51] thank God we have a church family
[1:38:53] that'll rally we're around you
[1:38:57] thank God you got Ministry they won't
[1:38:59] tell you what you want to hear but
[1:39:00] they'll tell you what you need to hear
[1:39:02] we can preach you up in the Heights some
[1:39:04] of us can brother Tim some of them they
[1:39:06] can preach you up into the heights of
[1:39:07] this word some of them can preach you
[1:39:09] right where you're living
[1:39:10] see because he told he told Peter Peter
[1:39:13] do you love me yes Lord you know I love
[1:39:14] it then feed my sheep Peter do you love
[1:39:17] me yes Lord then feed my Lambs see you
[1:39:20] got to feed it all eat a light
[1:39:22] Tabernacle we can feed you all it's not
[1:39:24] us but it's because we're staying in the
[1:39:26] word of God to show you who you are
[1:39:30] to my brother Tim said on Sunday to put
[1:39:33] that Perfect Bride without spot for that
[1:39:37] wrinkle without blemish
[1:39:40] put that before you preach it before you
[1:39:42] take that other one and say put it right
[1:39:44] beside it you always was a Son of God I
[1:39:46] created you in my image the Bible says
[1:39:48] you're fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:39:49] put it back there and you marry the two
[1:39:51] of them up and he says now you start
[1:39:52] walking to that
[1:39:54] start walking into that that's why a
[1:39:56] young man can turn his head and turn his
[1:39:58] head walking through laodicea with all
[1:40:00] the smut and everything around they'll
[1:40:02] keep their eyes focused on the cross
[1:40:03] they're not going to look this way or
[1:40:05] look that way they're looking toward the
[1:40:07] promise of God let me tell you Church
[1:40:08] the same way with us tonight you're not
[1:40:10] looking at these things of the world
[1:40:11] it's the things of the world are pulling
[1:40:13] on you something hadn't happened yet
[1:40:15] you need to get that thing taken care of
[1:40:18] and get it to the Altar and let God burn
[1:40:21] it out of your life but what I'm telling
[1:40:22] you tonight is you put that body you put
[1:40:24] that Revelation you put that image right
[1:40:26] in front of you and you begin to walk
[1:40:28] into it yes I am a Son of God yes I am
[1:40:31] that bride yes that's who I am I may not
[1:40:34] look like it tonight I may have failures
[1:40:36] tonight but that's the word of God I
[1:40:38] always was the word of God
[1:40:47] and I'm bringing this to a close here in
[1:40:49] a few minutes but now he's standing in
[1:40:52] the midst of the church this is the
[1:40:54] level to see a message he stands there
[1:40:57] revealing who he is in the last stage
[1:41:01] he calls himself the author of the
[1:41:03] creation of God this is not another
[1:41:05] creation this has to do with the church
[1:41:07] this is a special designation of himself
[1:41:10] he is the creator of that church
[1:41:16] Colossians 1 8 he is the head of the
[1:41:19] body of the church who is the beginning
[1:41:20] of the firstborn from the dead that in
[1:41:23] all things he might have preeminence
[1:41:25] second Corinthians 5 17 therefore If any
[1:41:28] man is in Christ he is a new creation
[1:41:32] you can't be new with the old habits
[1:41:35] you can't be new and have old desires
[1:41:38] you can't be new and you can't get to
[1:41:40] the house of God
[1:41:41] we're talking about a new creation
[1:41:45] notice now old things have passed away
[1:41:47] old desires old habits old longings old
[1:41:51] nature had passed away and behold All
[1:41:54] Things become new
[1:41:56] Ephesians 2 10 for we are his
[1:41:58] workmanship created in Union with Christ
[1:42:02] unto good works Ephesians 4 24 and that
[1:42:06] you put on the new man
[1:42:09] put on the new man which after God is
[1:42:12] created in righteousness and true
[1:42:14] Holiness program says now the new
[1:42:16] creation is not the old creation made
[1:42:19] over
[1:42:20] he cannot be called because it's a new
[1:42:22] creation that's exactly what it says
[1:42:24] it's a new creation it's another
[1:42:26] creation distinct
[1:42:28] from the old one no longer is he dealing
[1:42:32] with the ways of the flesh
[1:42:34] see but now out of every Kindred tribe
[1:42:36] people and Nation he has purposed a new
[1:42:40] creation
[1:42:42] got his purpose a new creation this is a
[1:42:45] true revelation of God this was his
[1:42:48] purpose this purpose took form through
[1:42:51] election that is why he could look right
[1:42:54] down to the last age when all the world
[1:42:56] would be over or all would be over and
[1:42:58] he can see himself standing in the midst
[1:43:01] of the church as the author
[1:43:03] of the new creation of God
[1:43:07] God
[1:43:09] says let us make man
[1:43:12] in our image in the beginning and now we
[1:43:15] find him in our day
[1:43:18] walking in the midst of his creation
[1:43:25] see before there was a world ever
[1:43:27] started God saw us and God put your name
[1:43:31] on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:43:33] he said that name is there and there
[1:43:36] ain't a devil in hell can touch it
[1:43:40] because you always were
[1:43:44] indelible
[1:43:46] there ain't nothing that you'll go
[1:43:47] through that'll ever erase your name off
[1:43:49] of that book
[1:43:51] did you hear me
[1:43:55] the seed
[1:43:58] cannot be separated
[1:44:00] from the promise
[1:44:03] the sea cannot be separated it was God's
[1:44:07] purpose to bring forth the people like
[1:44:09] unto himself that would be a bride
[1:44:13] oh my
[1:44:15] he says remember brother man tells you I
[1:44:17] no longer call you Church
[1:44:19] but I call you a bride what a
[1:44:21] distinction
[1:44:22] he's separating you from the rest
[1:44:26] because he's showing that you were never
[1:44:28] part of the church but you always was
[1:44:31] the bride
[1:44:33] see she was chosen before the
[1:44:35] foundational World in him she was
[1:44:37] foreknown beloved before she she ever
[1:44:40] was brought forth during the ages upon
[1:44:42] the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood
[1:44:44] and can never never come under
[1:44:46] condemnation
[1:44:48] some of y'all need to shout
[1:44:50] because you walking in condemnation day
[1:44:52] after day after day after day but the
[1:44:55] Bible says therefore there is now no
[1:44:57] condemnation to them that walk not after
[1:44:59] the flesh but after the spirit
[1:45:02] you know the emphatic diet Glide brother
[1:45:04] brother Bram talked about that and
[1:45:06] brother Tim made mention to it on Sunday
[1:45:08] but when you look at the emphatic dog
[1:45:10] and you look at Romans 8 it says because
[1:45:12] whom he foreknow also before he marked
[1:45:16] out copies
[1:45:18] God already marked out copies of himself
[1:45:22] and I'm looking at at marked out copies
[1:45:25] you know you take a sheet of paper and
[1:45:27] you're gonna or a cloth and you cut a
[1:45:30] design out of it
[1:45:31] God said you know what I'm going to
[1:45:33] replicate that I'm going to have sons
[1:45:35] and daughters in my own image he didn't
[1:45:37] take another sheet he didn't take
[1:45:39] another piece of cloth he took of the
[1:45:41] same cloth and he took the same pattern
[1:45:43] he took the same as I and he began begin
[1:45:46] to cut out of it the same thing church
[1:45:49] I'm here to tell you you're made from
[1:45:51] the same call that Christ is made from
[1:45:54] you're exactly the same you're marked
[1:45:56] out copies of God himself I mean that's
[1:45:59] why you're here tonight that's why you
[1:46:01] come to receive the word tonight it's
[1:46:03] because God had already called you for
[1:46:05] this he mocked you out you don't belong
[1:46:07] to the devil you belong to God
[1:46:12] oh
[1:46:14] and I meant that here musicians please
[1:46:16] come if you would
[1:46:17] Romans 8 and verse 31 what shall we say
[1:46:20] to these things if God be for us
[1:46:24] who can be against us
[1:46:27] oh he that spare not his son but
[1:46:30] delivered them up for us all how that he
[1:46:32] was how that he shall not with him also
[1:46:35] freely give us all things who shall lay
[1:46:38] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[1:46:40] is God that justified
[1:46:43] is he that condemneth it is Christ that
[1:46:45] has died rather that is risen again who
[1:46:48] is even at the right hand of God who
[1:46:50] maketh intercession for us verse 35 and
[1:46:53] this is where we draw our thought who
[1:46:56] shall separate us
[1:46:58] from the love of Christ
[1:47:01] shall tribulation
[1:47:05] that's a question shall tribulation
[1:47:09] shall distress
[1:47:11] shall persecution shall famine or
[1:47:15] nakedness our Peril our sword
[1:47:19] oh Church the Bible says who shall
[1:47:21] separate us from the love of God there's
[1:47:24] nothing and we find in verse 38 he says
[1:47:27] for I am persuaded that neither death
[1:47:30] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:47:33] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:47:36] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[1:47:40] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:47:42] us from the love of God which is in
[1:47:45] Jesus Christ Our Lord I'm going to tell
[1:47:48] you tonight this word is going to bring
[1:47:50] forth of his own kind and the seed of
[1:47:53] God there is nothing that can separate
[1:47:55] that seed from the word from the promise
[1:47:58] there ain't no persecution there ain't a
[1:48:00] sickness there ain't cancer ain't enough
[1:48:03] demon power ain't enough depression
[1:48:05] ain't enough anxiety ain't enough fear
[1:48:07] ain't enough heart trouble ain't enough
[1:48:09] sugar diabetes there ain't nothing can
[1:48:12] separate the seed from the promise
[1:48:15] your sons of God your daughters of God
[1:48:18] Rejoice Church rejoicing that revelation
[1:48:22] God you call me for this you made me
[1:48:26] dust
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:28] I didn't make myself the bride God you
[1:48:31] called me you made me
[1:48:34] and there ain't enough
[1:48:37] there ain't enough powers
[1:48:40] that can separate me
[1:48:42] from my promise
[1:48:46] oh but love it
[1:48:49] what manner
[1:48:50] of love the father has bestowed upon me
[1:48:55] that right now

[1:48:59] I'm a son of God
[1:49:01] and when I get out of bed on Thursday
[1:49:03] morning I'm a Son of God and when I get
[1:49:06] to Monday I'm still a Son of God and
[1:49:08] when I get to next year I'm still a Son
[1:49:11] of God and when I face my hardest trial
[1:49:13] I'm still a Son of God and when sickness
[1:49:15] ravishes my body I'm still a Son of God
[1:49:18] and when I feel like giving up and
[1:49:20] giving it I can't give up I came back up
[1:49:23] I can't give in why because I am a Son
[1:49:26] of God
[1:49:27] and it does yet appear what I shall be
[1:49:30] but I know one thing what he shall
[1:49:33] appear buddy I'm gonna be just like him
