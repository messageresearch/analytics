before the lord we want to continue to remember whether gary steinke is he recovers from heart surgery [Music] quite a quite a heart surgery he went through and so i want to remember him today lord just give him strength and full recovery also remember brother dennis sister diane simonelli and brother john and sister marie lay as they recover from covet 19. both of both couples are doing well but we're going to just ask the lord to continue to touch their bodies brother and sister hollis desired prayer today to join us on streaming they're happy to see everyone but ask for prayer today also brother stephen fraser gives his greetings he joins us every service but he needs prayer for deliverance from health problems i want to remember him today also brother jason watkins and the beaufort church has been shut down this today because of coffee brother matthew watkins has tested positive for it so i'll remember them in prayer and remember him in prayer as well also brother kevin keith from johnson city having heart issues is in the hospital i remember sister nancy herron's sister anna her and her husband both have severe physical problems and marriage problems there's a butch bollinger he's on a vent in north arkansas a friend or relative of his reached out to brother aaron for prayer and for our church to pray for him also barney watts a friend of brother sam patton sister melinda patton passed away just yesterday i believe on a member of the family in prayer so there's a lot to pray about [Music] a lot to talk to the lord about i know if we ask for hands today it'd be hands lifted up all over this building but you know in the middle of prayer in the middle of needs there's always something to thank god for amen i know the devil always wants to point at our sicknesses or our problems and you know and make it a negative thing it's not a negative thing it's only an opportunity for god to operate for god to come on the scene and we saw that very wonderfully and it done in our church many times but today we want to remind the church and remind the people of god of god's unfailing promises and this healing power amen sister atlanta said she just had her first pet scan in a year and a half i've been doing labs before that the scan was perfect my blood work was perfect doctor says i'm doing wonderful [Music] yesterday was three years exactly since i found out i had lymphoma what a mighty god we serve well my if god can do that for cancer and none of these we read was anything too hard for him amen and i like to remind the devil of that there's nothing too hard for our god amen i might as brother joe if he'd come and take these knees before the lord let's pray together remembering these needs this morning you believe that this morning all things are possible all things are possible for them that believe if you can believe that sister atlanta believed sister karen believed as we as a church that believed nothing will stand before the believer's prayer not even cancer so let's turn our attention away from fears and anxieties and worries and stress and let's believe this morning let's bind together this morning for the needs that were mentioned because god already has the answer in place he's just looking for somebody to take him at his word and believe so father we just come before your throne this morning and lord and we bow our heads in appreciation and respect because lord we're able to approach the throne of mercy and you would tell us in your word father that that we as a people can find hope we can find help in our time of need and we're we approach your throne this morning to give our adoration and our praise in order in our our our songs of deliverance to you this morning father we just want to rejoice in the goodness of god and though there may be a long list of prayer as brother timothy said father we have so much to be thankful for lord think about the body of christ that is assembled right here this morning lord there's churches around the nation around the world who are not able to assemble themselves together lord there's other churches that may be assembling but they don't quite have the faith to believe and yet lord we're a church that i believe we're a church that takes god at his word this morning and for every request that was mentioned brother gary god is he underwent a sixth bypass lord we're asking this morning that you just bring a speedy recovery and a great touch in his body and lord we thank you for brother dennis and sister diane as they overcome the cobra 19 and we continue to pray for for for the ladies lord brother john and sister mary as maria as they continue to to recuperate from this and brother stephen fraser lord and the the hollis and brother jason watkins in his church so many needs god but you're a great god this morning and we're just gonna believe this morning lord for the supernatural we're gonna believe god you're gonna do something at the evening time that you've done many times before and our eyes become open and we can see who jesus is what jesus does and what he wants to do today so we're asking father for every need that was mentioned this morning may your holy spirit drop down even now father and begin to move begin to touch begin to administer healing and deliverance god may you just come on the scene today come on the scene today in a mighty way god we're under expectation for the movement of the spirit lord we're here today assemble together to see christ to see the power of god in display not just the mechanics of the word but the dynamics married to the mechanics and see the supernatural perform what it says it will perform lord you told your prophet if you can get the people to believe nothing would stand before their prayer and lord i just want to say this morning not even cancer not even high blood pressure not even c diff not even uh whatever heart troubles or whatever it may be this morning nothing will stand before the believer's prayer and we believe this morning father that whatever things we ask in your name you said we can have it so lord according to your word and our faith this morning may you just meet every need every hand that was lifted may you meet every heart's cry this morning every person going through a difficult situation lord may you be their comforter and their peace at this time we committed to you lord bless his service lord bless brother tim as he has prayed and studied and prepared all week god may there just be an outpouring of the supernatural may there be a

proofs of your resurrection lord we've seen you in this day raised up from out of history lord that you have shown yourself to be the living god not a god of the past alone by the god of the present not a god of the future alone but jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we're so thankful today for your blessings we're just asking lord of your anointing that you'll speak to us in a real and living way enjoy may we enjoy your presence lord your people just bask in your presence you know those that are listening in from around the world down in africa south africa down in this in south america and canada different churches that are even shut down now that they aren't able to meet i pray god that you would bless your people lord the enemy is come in like a flood but lift up a standard i pray god that you would be merciful to us in this evil age that we're living that we would be a standard for righteousness that we would be a beam of light to the world a city that cannot be hid i pray in the name of jesus lord that you'll just bless your people in jesus name amen and amen god bless you thank you bye we just had some wonderful singing and worship to the lord and man i looked at all of those young ones there and that ain't all of them that was just a part of them there that was um our young people our young children and i remember oh was it some years ago now when we broke the the ground here on this building that i looked at all the the young little ones there and we we sang this song building up the temple you remember that and and those were little tikes at that time now they're our senior youth group and so we we uh see things move right along now we got another little generation coming up and out of these that you saw on the stand today there are two that's going to be baptized today in the wonderful name of the lord jesus john paul and and his sister haven are going to be baptized taken on the name of the lord and i think that is a wonderful thing that the lord would get a hold of their hearts while they're young amen you say well it can't happen it don't mean anything well i gave my heart to the lord at five years old i guess they can too amen there so we just um prayed the lord well we'll bless them today in the baptismal service amen and my what a beautiful song they sang and we so appreciate their their um teachers for getting that together and looking forward to the wonderful program tonight i know um i'll tell you our young people are are very very important to our church and i just got a um a note from south africa this morning as i was waking up i looked at it and and a little brother and his family uh from down in south africa they're taking heart today because they see young people that are living for god and have a you know holy dress that aren't looking like the world and we got so much to be thankful for you know sometimes you may look out there and you may see one or two or somebody struggling along but you know i'm thankful too that we got young people that are solid that love god and wants to do right and are progressing in the grace of god amen so god bless you it's so good to be together this morning let's turn back to john 14 and verse 12. i want to read from there this morning and as we're looking there i want to just remind you that that this is the message of the church jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever performing the same works doing the same things that jesus did and that's the message of the church if the church isn't teaching that it's teaching some false theology but that's what jesus commanded them to preach so here we're going right here to this john 14 12. as the prophet said this is what we were commanded to preach and he says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go to my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the sun if you ask anything in my name i will do it what a wonderful word's a promise amen now you know to be able to ask in his name that's not just a talisman or a good world good luck charm or a good luck words in order to use the name of jesus you got to be born into his family amen so if we ask anything in my father's name that he in my name i will do it this is what he made the promise for now then of course we want to um look also in the mark 11 21 and peter calling to remembrance speaking of the of the victory master behold the victory which thou curse us is withered away in jesus answer and said unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen god bless his word god bless you as you're seated i'm going to be speaking today on the call for sincerity and you know we have read some very powerful words in the scripture very challenging words in the scripture and they are words that we learn that and that is our message that we must be projecting and portraying to the world that we are living in and then we we also know that the works of christ are to be magnified as he said that greater than these shall you do for i go to my father and so they they are magnified by the power of creation the voice of a redeemed son standing under the blood of jesus christ knowing his position led by the holy ghost the father given him the words to say now you know under the blood of bulls and goats we we see moses striking the dust and calling for lice and he took that dust made lice out of it and jesus took fish and he pulled more fish to make more fish and bread to make more bread but he challenges our faith in this end time to believe the greater works amen a man of creating things out of nothing because this is what god has done in our generation just you know he showed us the display of his power to challenge our faith to believe because um we're the generation now that will see the dead in christ to rise amen where that we we will call and they will come forth even as the voice of the son of man will be resounded through his body upon the earth the bride of christ and so we know then that these works that i do shall you do also and even greater than this shall you do it'll be magnified so again it's a magnification of um of what what he even done when he was here on the earth is the greater magnification of what the old testament prophets did so and we must know that creative work belongs in the church of jesus christ and that awesome to know that creative work belongs in the church of jesus christ now i'm going to just share with you a description of the holy ghost field son or daughter of god and that is just chock full of the holy ghost walking in harmony with the will of god now you know just uh just a touch of god is omnipotent amen there's no weak spots or heavy little big heavy spots in god the very smallest touch of god is omnipotent and when you have jesus on the inside of you then then that is omnipotent power it's a resource that is not far away in the heavens but right here within you and we must learn as believers to operate because we are a two-part being we are first born a human being second we are second born sons and daughters of god and so it takes a it's it must be now in our converted state that we're in that we we stay in contact with the holy spirit that's on the inside of us to be led by the holy ghost and this is what god will have in this end time is men and women led by the spirit directed by the holy ghost so here's a description of a holy ghost field son or daughter of god and this is from god hiding himself in simplicity he said the blood of jesus so thoroughly cleanses that there's no more nothing amen that the complete word of god rests within them that the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the holy ghost and this holy ghost is a creator he makes things comes to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes god in action now this don't happen at the whim of our human spirit but this happens only by the impulse of the holy ghost but a man to think of it a man under the blood of jesus christ so filled with the spirit and can yield to that spirit until god can use their voice to move mountains so he yielded until god actually takes a hold of the vocal cords of a man and speaks through him now this is what we this is what we saw in fact of the matter when i was just a young boy in brother branham's meeting and seeing the hearts discerned and people's names called and who they were and where they were from and what their situation was i knew that was not a man with that knowledge i knew that was that was that was god a great power that was revealing those things that it wasn't this was beyond human capabilities but god was actually using the vocal cords of a man to be able to discern the thoughts and the inches of heart accurately time not just once but time after time after time without any error at all amen now of course as i said this does not happen at the whim of our human spirit it has to happen by the impulse of the holy ghost i i'd like to see some you know us live in a higher realm where we are we are acting under the impulse of the holy ghost not so much by human nature or human desire or human compassion even but where the holy spirit is directing the words that we are speaking now that's what i'm talking about an end time people now brother bradham told us as soon as he can get his church in speaking conditions to a place where he can flow through and love and persuade and fellowship then there are coming eden amen he'll take his church back to where it left him back to an eden where it fell the eden is where it made its first star to fall and that's where to be taken right back with a clean slate of redemption and this is where we're at we're we're right on the very edge of going from mortal to immortality it's a wonderful hour that we're living in and sometimes i think we don't fully grasp because satan has so designed his age to be so full of of every kind of nonsense and things of of the of um this life and we're we're over burdened the bible said that that we would be our hearts would be overcharged with sophiety and drunkenness so drunk on this world and its ways until we're out of touch with god that's what its design is i think of it you know even as this thing has come through of this coveted 19 and hitting our nation not just our nation but nations around the world are suffering today and churches have not been able to meet some of them not been able to meet since this thing began we're very blessed people today amen we're very blessed people that we can meet the way we are amen but but many of them are forbidden by law to do so and they're they're not able to meet as we are meeting this morning but satan has so designed that as i as i passed by the little um little baptist church on the corner today again was running a little bit late so it was even closer to what their scheduled service time not one car in their parking lot nobody's assembled together for months and you know this is satan's design and you can see it's destroying the faith of many and and many are becoming very cold even even the secular christians that were church goers and people of righteousness are are becoming very very cold and distant toward god and the things of god because they have been unable to worship together you know and and yet we were told to worship together even so much the more as we see that day approaching but satan of course says he's about to as he is he is about to enter in completely and fully into this dimension as the bride leaves remember we're the ones holding him off the righteousness of god's people is holding him back but then he who letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then the the man of sin will be revealed the son of perdition so we're living right here on the the very custo of eden can you imagine ready to go from mortal to immortality ready to go to to meet right here on the earth to meet right here on the earth the dead in christ amen not only of our age but over other age before and that meets with the old testament states there in the great marriage supper of the lamb so you see you know this is where we are at in time and and the bible tells us in romans 8 he says all creation is groaning with travail and they're looking for the revealing or the apocalyptic the manifestations of the sons of god where sons of god will be revealed and listen to brother branham in the message adoption he said go back to genesis to the original what it is what is it and now the world and nature is grown and crying and everything's a move in what for the manifestations of the sons of god when true sons born sons field sons speak and their words are bound and i believe we're right on the border of it now yes say to this mountain let it be so and brother i desire such and so and so a certain thing to be done i'm a believer in christ i give it to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen there's a manifestation oh brother my crops are burning up out younger i haven't had any rain i'll i'll send you rain in the name of the lord god bless your crop oh waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god right here here we are standing and in the last age as i have been saying you know god has showed us we are on the brink of eternity we're standing right on the edge of it now you know and let me just tell you even as 2 000 years ago heaven was moving as angels were descending and voices from that other realm was coming are you with me and messages from the other realm was coming into this dimension and that was at his first coming and now we're here at his second coming and there again the supernatural must be on display amen we're angels are descending and where messages are coming and it's happened in our age amen now you know in time-tested faith brother branham said we know that man could not move a mountain just by speaking to it that the only thing that could do that would be deity so then if the mountain is before us an objective is right and our motive is right then it isn't not speaking anymore it's deed is speaking then it has to move and he said i believe the church is on the brink of one of the greatest outporns that's ever had in this age i believe it i can't say the lord has told me anybody there's just something inside of me just catching a hold of something that i haven't seen all my life till just now and how glorious it is to know that just before the coming of the lord that these things are happening again just before that he will be taken home to be with the lord he says i'm only building the hour is close at hand you're going to see something happen when something is going to take place and all this background here has been only laying a foundation for a short quick message that has shaped the whole nations what a promise that is amen we're in the age of adopted sons the sons that have been able to see their names in the book of redemption and understanding their position uh you know you say well brother tim what is what is it my position say you're a preacher you you know you're a pastor you're uh you know brother timothy is a song leader and a preacher and brother joe's a preacher and brother aaron's a preacher and sister jessica she's a great singer and and brother philip and sister mandy and all of the others they're great singers what is my position those are not positions those are gifts and amen what is my position your position is one of sonship amen by your new birth you have been placed in the body of christ and you are a son or daughter of god amen and so that is your position it's the position of sonship you are the offspring of god amen you you were born human and mortal by your first birth for whatever is born of flesh is flesh but then whatever is born of the holy spirit is spirit amen whatever is born of god is god oh my god is positioning sons in this day giving them power and authority because of his blood now and hear him he would say it this way now jesus had proven to god that he'd been the right kind of son and god took him up on the top of the mountain of transfiguration and brought witnesses out there and heavenly witnesses and earthly witnesses and he clothed him in immortality and when they looked up they said his garments shine like the sun and supernatural something was taking place and his garment glistening like the sun in the middle of the day as white as they could be and god placed on him that robe of immortality showing that he had received him and that's the same thing that god will do to his sons here on the earth someday he will call you a side church if you only obey him and stand on his word and believe it he will place into the church before the coming of jesus christ he'll place into the church all the powers that christ had in him will be in the church and all that god was he poured into jesus and all that jesus was he pours into the church god wanting his work done he sent it into his son the son is wanting his work done and he sent it to the church at that day you'll know that i'm in the father and the father in me and i knew and you and me at that day because the same power of god was in jehovah god rested in jesus christ and the same power that rested in jesus christ rest in place sons in the body of christ hallelujah now these these are i'm i'm sharing these things because i'm challenging your faith brother branham talked about the squirrels that were spoken to existence and he said god asked me to do that he told me to do that he challenged me to do it he said it was my own faith that brought squirrels into existence things that god challenged me to ask for i wonder if we can be challenged in this day to ask for a resurrection to ask for the change of the body amen come on we're divine healing is just a minor and we look at the at the real thing that god wants to bring in this day and age again and here you hear the placing of the sun take him out to a certain place have a ceremony before angels positionally place him what he is in the body of christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you kept me a fanatic from this night on that the very same thing i'm speaking up will be done there will be a power put into the church and now coming in that the holy spirit was so anoint to people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen powers likes coming into the church now i know it for a fact because he saw it demonstrated say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said shall come to pass you can have what you said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes in the church and he says them critics mouse will be shut it'll be a short time jesus came right off the mountains and went straight to calvary notice it won't last long but it'll be there you know sometimes we just need to stop and see stop and and take note of what we are to expect set our expectations high israel in the church he said i believe we're on the borderline tonight i was wondering about all my meetings and things and i had to cancel them out i truly believe before the church can have the rapture it's got to have rapture and faith we can't have faith for divine healing let alone rapture in faith got to have a faith that'll change and quicken this body and be taken away i believe there's a church on its road tonight a power of the living god that man will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning and a church is coming out not a a not a psychologist not somebody that's put on make believe but a real genuine anointed holy ghost called out church amen well hallelujah whatever age before the word demonstrated itself it was like a sword it went out in the cut you know like a flaming cutting sword you saw him today was it um was it jehovah's shama it was flashed up there where the lord of hosts means the lord of armies amen god's got an army and he's the lord over that army and he equipped us with a word to defeat the enemy with you listen church we've only done minor stuff yet you think of that we've only seen minor things yet and so what's promised in the word he said like a surgeon's knife he said that that word cut out diseases it set the captives free and everywhere the early believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and god confirmed that word was signs following the sick were healed the devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action and the word is never failed in the mouths of believing christians and what about now brother tim what about this last age and in this last age it is here stronger and greater in the true word bride oh little flop you little minority hold on to the word so fill your mouth and heart with it and someday god will give you the kingdom again you know he he would say these things and these are just little snippets that i'm bringing out so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and then places it upon his lips what is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man again in the last day last age that will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ well church we we've come through a long journey i've been talking about it from some time where the church left him at pentecost and we've come and we've made some great advancements it's like science has made advancements and you know so the church has advanced you know we come through luther and wesley and the azusa street movement and luther walked in one light and wesley walked in another light and the azusa movement pentecost walked in another but we're walking on higher today and if and brother branham stopped there and he says now if it goes another generation it will go beyond us now that was 1959 so he said if it goes another generation it'll even go beyond us and he said now the age we're living in is beyond pentecost speaking of azusa movement but it's all coming forth of the holy spirit to the great churches being filled up and choke full hallelujah of the great powers of almighty god until it's got to a place until the very works that jesus has has done has been manifest right here in the church now we're close friends again he says you know satan has been coming in it's been getting darker and more evil but he says when we need it god raised the standard amen what is it he's pouring in his spirit now get the picture church it's an outpouring it's a refilling hey man it's a it's a it's a given out of the holy spirit he said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh he's been doing it too you know throughout the ages and and he's been pouring it was a jib poured out with luther and a greater dip with wesley and a greater dip with you in the azusa street but we're in the day where he empties it out amen now it's god it's god manifests himself in a people and he says he said that he's pouring in his spirit and those resting out in the grave are under the altar of god as the scripture said are crying how long lord how long how much longer let me stop there just for a moment and i want to remind you when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time that he heard the voices coming in first keep pressing the battle you don't know what lays at the end of the road you don't see the joys that are ahead keep pressing the battle keep pressing on now and he said they're there in fact to the matter is they were anxious to come back they would say to him you know when he said they said we're going to go back one day and we're going to take on our bodies again and we we will we we don't eat or sleep now but we'll eat then and he said well take up our bodies and they they were longing for that time i want you to understand they were under anticipation there was a longing in them there was something that was calling them for the completion of redemption you said brother tim they're fully redeemed no they're not they have they have been redeemed by the blood they are there in theophany bodies i'm talking about the dead saints they are there in theophany bodies but they are waiting on their bodies to be redeemed amen for them to be changed in a mortal and a twinkling of an eye and they are longing for that now so he's pressing his spirit and those resting out you under the grave under the altar of god or christ how long lord how long how much longer what brother if that's where they're crying and they're at ease and peace come on yet what about how we ought to be this morning it ought to be screaming out in us amen how much longer lord amen how long how much longer you see there ought to be a real sincerity and a dedication looking toward the promise amen he says god is waiting on me and you oh now we come right down to it they're waiting on us the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when god can pour out into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and christ become so close together until christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture amen now so everyone that we've seen every move of god before has been a deeper breath of god it's been a more a greater breath of the spirit as he breathed you know remember jesus would breathe on his disciples before pentecost and he would say receive ye the holy ghost he'd breathe upon the breath of god this breath becomes a mighty rushing wind on the day of pentecost is that right and it filled them where they were sitting now we're also been promised you know again the return back the faith of the children turned back to the faith of the fathers are you with me and the holy spirit has been moving and there's been a breath it was the breath of god upon luther and a little better and greater blow up on wesley and a deeper blow up on azusa street but now he says the breath and the spirit has become the same and she's uniting together and bringing forth that same blow of the holy ghost like he did back there is manifesting the same works that he did back there is being manifested right today the same thing what jesus said verily verily i say to you the son can do nothing except he sees the father do it first what the father does he shows the son the father dwelleth in me he doeth the works if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will because you're asking his word understand you're not asking you know the whim of some humanistic person but you're asking there what the holy spirit gives you to speak i'll be with you i'll be with your mouth and then you will speak things amen man i you know i i tell you you can look around at this building today and you can just see things that god just gave to us we just spoke it and it happened he put it in our hands you're witnesses of that no matter what it was if it was stoned around the building and and i looked at it and said that's what we want but we can't afford it and right there is put in our hands and when we look around we need a we need a road and the the the man the man who's building the the parking lot you'll never get an entrance on the 371 you'll never get it but we got one amen whatsoever things we desired when we prayed we believed that we received it and we had it and god provided until today we're sitting in a three million dollar building without a debt because god provided every step of the way are you with me amen wha what was it we're we've already been been seeing whatsoever things we desire believe that you receive them and you shall have them i want to you to remember that this church this building this this place right here was was it happened on an account of brother gary stanky was there in the hospital room dying three weeks without nourishment or food unable to digest anything and was in dying until demons were coming into the room howling and threatening him and we walked in there that day and i pulled up a chair right by him because i said gary stanky is a saint of god and the devil has no business tormenting him if god's taken him that's fine and then he's past 70. you know god's taking him that's okay you know blessed uh and the side of the lord the death of his saints man we don't see him go but i mean if he's going he's the saint of god but i'm not going to let devils torment him [Music] amen i'm not going to allow that to happen and i walked in there that day there pulled up a chair by him and you know he has his testimony was he said my faith was like an anchor and it was like dragging the bottom it was bumping here and bumping there and just couldn't get a hold but there in a moment's time as he come down to the jets of sincerity and when you know he's always been a sincere man i would say very sincere dedicated christian long time christian but one of the finest of the finest you'll not find a better man to watch in shoe leather than gary stanky christian all the way to the heart through the soul and there are a man that you know loves the lord and loves god a wonderful man but he reached a level of sincerity that he had never tapped into and in that moment there is he shared with me his heart the holy spirit came down and healed him and by that evening or at least by early the next day he was eating jello and back on the way to recovery amen why was it because it was it was that depth of sincerity and i'm i'm reminding you church this is our foundation here and when a man reaches a depth of sincerity things that was on his heart then was to have a place that we could meet more that people from who traveled in could could rest and be and we have all of that the whole facilities and even more because god's a shady eye he's more than enough he was able to do exceeding above whatsoever we could think or even ask i'll be honest with you i mean i was willing to do with with gravel parking lots i was willing to do anything well you know without any frills or whistles just to get in without debt i didn't want any debt i didn't want to enslave you or put you in bondage amen although somebody you know wrote me a nasty email and told me i was pharaoh and putting all the men and the women in bondage and so on like that and whatever else but god shut their mouth and gave you the building anyway debt free anyway but you see what was it it was we we have seen the manifestations we have seen what god will do and we see that where we're at we are built on that very principle of sincerity reaching a depth of sincerity as i said you know he he asked for those things that were that it was shared as hard as some things that was needed for the church and where we were located we couldn't provide it we had we were out of space everything and god just took and put it in our hands had this property right here put it in our hands we offered a lower price for this place and the man said i got greater i'll offer but this is what i want my father's land to go to i feel good about this i'm giving you the the piece of property and god provided it for us amen he gave it with some money but anyway it was given anyway we won the contract and look what god has done look what he has provided are you with me amen but you see again you know if you abide in me and my words in you ask what you will because you're asking his word and his word is life speak it if god said it you're sure he said it and the holy spirit spares witness that the word is right then there you are brother speak it there is say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your hearts but believe that that which you have said and it's going to come to pass it's not you that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in you he doeth the talking it's not you talking to that mountain it's the father that's in you speaking to that mountain it has to move and all heavens and earth will pass away but he said my my word shall not pass away it's certainly it cannot pass away again as he would say you know what is the holy ghost it's god in you what's it for to continue his work among his people to bring the church together i want to get it to you if you receive the holy ghost it's not just for you to sit down occupy pew and be a good church member amen but it's that god can continue his work among his people that's the purpose of god giving you the holy spirit in your life amen that he might bring the church to a place in this day far beyond lutheran methodist and jesus street pentecost into a place to adoption and a raptured grace that when this part of the church when the spirit moves into this church here are you with me when the spirit moves in this church here are you ready to avoid to move amen for the outpouring of the holy spirit for him to finish his work to pour it out when it moves in this church here it'll just raise and it'll bring forth all that's redeemed that's touched that spirit those lutheran who stood in the light that they had in justification those methodists that fell on the floor and they threw water in their face from the spirit striking them through sanctification those pentecostals who walked up and down the streets and they called them tongues demons and jabbers and goose language and all that they'll stand in the righteousness and the sight of god at that day just as certain as this bible is here if you believe me to be a servant you call me as prophet i don't call myself that but you but you listen i'm telling you in the name of the lord that those that are in christ will god bring with him that is coming at the resurrection and only those that are in christ we all remember the story of hattie wright a poor woman a widow raising two sons her husband killed in a tractor accident rolled over on him she's a widow woman trying to make a living sons you know being raised by a single mom getting rebellious in a rebellious age she had a heart and a concern for them i'll tell you what when you see your children go through things that ought to be the greatest desire amen she didn't think of a million dollars handed to her she didn't think of edith walking some temporary healing her sister who was having infantile paralysis or something like that some kind of horrible disease there it didn't she didn't think of asking for that none of that was on her mind she had one thing she was focused on and i'll tell you when we when we see our our children our young people when we see even older ones floundering it'll be the number one thing on our heart god somehow get a hold of their lives don't let them stray out there into sin and those that have bring them back in lord somehow by your grace and she was listening there as they sat around the table she was listening to brother branham talk and tell about the squirrels being created he said i just said impossible places there in that briar patch they're in the sycamore tree they're over over the impossible places where they don't go and he said there there was and i shot them we brought them home we skinned them and ate them and he said that little woman listened there she responded god's listening for your response she said that's nothing but the truth brother branham and when she did that response move god on her behalf think of that and brother branham was told right then sister hattie you've said the right thing see he said you got to watch what you say and she said the right things it was what in other words she was in unity with the harmony of god with the heart of god and when she did she asked for a mountain to be removed which was her two sons rebellious teenagers and the holy spirit struck that room there as he said i'll give you your son in the name of jesus christ and they fell down repenting right there gave their hearts to god amen amen see jesus said say to this mountain i'm just showing you your mountain may not be a huge debt your mountain may not be a literal mountain your mountain may be the terrible mess you made in your family some people have built big mountains your mountain can be many many things but your mountain has got to hear you respond to the word in faith amen and and say the greatest desire i have and i wonder if you were given that opportunity what would be your greatest desire i wonder if you're in the depths of sincerity where that you could ask what god wants said instead of just human desire i'm purposely speaking very methodically and straight jesus said say to this mountain we know what took place as brother branham thought on that scripture he said that had to be before the atonement he said because you know that that couldn't be done now you know and god began to speak to him he said no it was in the atonement and then he began to challenge his faith to speak for what he needed and he said that's the ministry we're entering into well i don't know that we've exited out of it we're way up the road now soon to come in the lord jesus and we've got to have rapture and faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out and or will not go but don't worry it'll be there amen listen again let me read that again i want you to grab your faith to grab this right now he said we've got to have raptured faith in the church that can be changed in a moment or a twinkling of an eye to go out or we'll not go but don't worry it'll be there amen it'll be there but when the power of this church rises it'll bring its brethren and the power that church rises it will bring its brethren and then the power of that church will bring the other brethren and then there will be a general resurrection and we're looking forward to it do you hear what he's saying when the power rises in the church the dead in christ is going to and rise those of the of this lashing see the first shall be last and the last shall be first so the last ones that went down will be the first ones who will be resurrected amen oh my that's that means you you're you're blessed people you're not gonna have to wait and see a bunch of people you never ever knew never seen before start appearing among you claiming to be peter or paul or james or john you're going to see your loved ones appear right before you and you will recognize them and when you see them you're going to be feel a change sweep over you and you're going to be changed in a moral a twinkling of an eye as we say there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down am i because this is rapture hour this is resurrection hour you see this continues unto the voice of god becomes so strong in the bride of christ that she actually gives voice to the resurrection amen already time is blending with eternity we're already seeing things has happened with the opening of the seal seven angels comes out of that dimensions right into this dimension and reveals things that was previously unknown to the church there are things and i want you to get this because as you as you study the the message you're going to come you have to come to realize that brother branham was a tire of loose ends you're going to have to understand that he took strands from from from this truth from this one and strands from this of this truth from that one and strands of that of a truth from another and tied it into one message the critics would want to say well he was a plagiarist you know he he borrowed from this and that one the other and and i i don't know the preacher alive that ain't a plagiarist if i hear something good i'm going to borrow it and i'm going to use it for myself i figure if it's god's word it belongs to god and i'm his child too so i'll just use it amen but you know i you know it no longer stumbles me it does not stumble me at all to to have a prophet who is a man he wasn't god he wasn't infallible and every word wasn't thus saith the lord he was he was a man he could speak thus saith the lord but he also spoke a lot of things he said this is william branham i'm presuming here i i give him the i give him the it doesn't bother me for a prophet of god to be to be able to embellish to be able to sometimes exaggerate sometimes speaking off the cuff not have perfect recall i think we ought to be grown up enough to understand he was a human being he wasn't god you know when we're young in our infancy you know we we have we we make it a personality cult so our hero can do nothing wrong that's why these people can overlook all these football players you know with with their with uh 10 women hanging off of their hands and and children by all kinds and dope and alcohol and shoddy life because they're blinded amen so they they they they can't they can't see what their hero was is really like and when you have hero worship and that's what it is with the personality called you know you have hero worship well then you know nothing can it all has to be god you know you know you make a god out of him but we must realize it wasn't he was not a god he was a man and as a man he could conjecture he could have opinions he could have beliefs he could have thoughts he could express those things but now as we're speaking of it as we as we come down here to to this we we realize that that we're here on the very edge of eternity we're about to blend from time to eternity and as i said seven angels coming from those other dimensions and there night after night revealed the seven seals where that the silence has been broken and that we're no longer in the days of silence anymore but now god has spoke out and shown us where we are in time and this is what i'm trying to convey upon you is because of where we are in time that we're about to split from time into eternity now in how can i overcome brother brandon said we see this age we're living in it's one of the grandest of all ages of all ages this laodicean church age the grandest of all church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity time and eternity are blending together some of y'all will remember in the early ministries of brother branham he tells about this one of the first times in 1950 but it would happen in the 40s he was having a meeting over here in camden arkansas and of course you know in that time it was a a difficult time in our nation and here in the south were that the black people were were um kept separated and treated as subhuman it was so wrong and and and you know and you know they're there again you know they couldn't even sometimes worship together in the same building and so on especially here in the south and brother branham was being taken out of the meeting and as he was he let's see set up on a little knoll there's a there's an old colored man with us with his hat in his hand and and he's kind of running it around his fingers like this and he was saying oh mercy mercy have mercy upon me i'm a blind man have mercy on me and the the man that was with brother branham was pushing him trying to get him out of the crowd and back to his car and he said i want to go over there i feel the pull of the holy spirit to go there and they said you can't go there you'll cause a race riot and you're leaving all these white people going to that black man you can't do that he said but the spirit of god is telling me to do it and i don't care anything about your laws i want to obey the spirit of god as he he they said but you can't go over there he said but the lord is telling me to go there so they made a way and he got over there and as he approached the man's wife said now honey honey settle down the parsons coming to you and and said and so he got up close and he reached out and as a blind man would would feel of his face so while you're a young man said is this you parson branham and he took his little quivering hands and put it over his face like that and he said can you listen my story just for a minute and he says yeah go right ahead tell me your story and he said parson branham said my old mammy had had legend like you got her never told me a lie in all her life and she's been dead for now 10 years and i've been blind for about eight years and last night i've never heard of you in my life and last night about eight o'clock i live 150 miles from here my old mammy stood right there by my side of my bed and she said honey child you go down to camden arkansas and you ask for somebody by the name of parson branham and you'll get your site he said i reached over and i put my hands on the old uh on his old dark wrinkled face and i just began to pray and said lord jesus i don't understand this but i asked for sight in his in your name and as he moved his hands down he said god would judge me at judgment bar but as i moved my hands down tears began to run down that old man's cheek and he looked over his wife and said honey i can see and she began to scream can you see honey he said it shows that there's a red car sitting right there and there stands parson branham and himself screaming like that he was perfectly well we're living in an age of the blending of dimensions we all remember the great experience of brother branham going beyond the curtain of time i've already mentioned that hearing the voices from the other side say press the battle you're just starting to keep pressing the battle in other words don't give up now this is the heaven's message that was resounding back to a prophet messenger that's they're saying on the other side and i think it's that message to you this morning keep pressing the battle amen you know you just don't know you can't imagine the joys that lay at the end of the road [Music] don't quit don't lose your confidence don't listen what are you going to trade your confidence for you can't trade it for nothing the world has there's no guarantee with anything that they have you think the vaccine is gonna end your anxieties it won't do it there's only one vaccine that will end your anxiety and that's the baptism of the holy ghost the toxin from heaven if i don't quit i mean my goodness it's a it's an hour to press him harder than you ever pressed him is urging a song he said brother tim that ain't even scriptural well what do you what he say that in in in in hebrews chapter 12. won't you put that up for me adriana uh hebrews chapter 12 verse 1. amen what does he say after he sees all these heroes of faith and he names bayrack and and ruth and and and rahab and he names david and abraham and noah and anna can all of these and he says wherefore sin we are compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses let us lay your side ever wait and the sin which does so easily beside us and let us run let's see a people with a passion let's see a people with a drive a drive to finish this and we'll see it come to conclusion a people of sincerity of dedication he says seemed like it here could hear somebody singing a song i'm so homesick and blue and i want to see jesus and i think that ought to be the song of our heart this morning if they're saying they want to come back here then we should be saying we want to meet them there and he says the song said kept saying you know would you just let me get a glimpse beyond the curtain of time said would you just like to see on that curtain said it helped me so much and he said just a moment one breath i come to a little place that was slanted i looked back and i saw my body laying on the bed and i said this is a strange thing and as he moved up he stepped out into onto a big grassy field looked like bluegrass is a panoramic and a huge view a wide open field and as he did here come young women and young men robed in white running to him throwing their arms around him and said brother we knew you were coming we're so glad a month ago back in november my daughter bethany had been asking the lord for just reassurance you know during these troubled times you would just want to make a call in an election sure hey man and now within a couple of weeks of specifically praying about that she had a dream and she was sitting she's visiting with me and her brother timothy here and we were sitting there in their living room and all of a sudden she began this just a dream she began to receive texts and photos on her phone and it was from it was from sister butts we don't know mamashe is a great sainted woman there's two godly people jerome and jerome lovett butts and his wife louise she's a great sainted woman she passed away some years ago now but there she was in heaven and she was sending her back messages and these messages says i cannot wait to be with you again you're going to have such a wonderful time you've already been seen here in heaven and then she began to see photos of her future and there the photos was someone was on a couch sitting cheek to cheek oh you said brother tim that can't be realistic hey when brother branham would be there he saw a mars chair something similar to what he was had on the earth amen you know heaven heaven you know is is it has things in heaven that is has earthly simmer and similarities and and so then another photo was of them in a gorgeous field hand in hand with long flowing hair and dresses she began viewing these messages and crying along with me and her brother and just praying that that day would come quickly and it was rejoicing began to talk about how beautiful and how wonderful heaven must be just a few nights ago brother ron spencer he had an amsterdam visit uh thursday night and he said my father's mother which has been his grandmother visited me about 1am she was young had long black hair she was standing very beautifully with a beautiful smile and and she was a powerful woman extremely gifted but here she's already gone on but she's standing there and she said the other time that this happened with her she was in the room 12 years ago when i woke up and you were there brother tim and brother branham and and this happened you know the day he woke up from nearly a month in the hospital from burns all over his bodies and god honored the prayers of believers and raised him up from death you remember i was sent over there with a divine commission the lord sent me there and i walked into the hospital room laid my hands upon brother ron he was there they were going to harvest his organs with just in hours he's in a dying condition he was an organ donor so they were they were about to to harvest his his organs he was pronounced brain dead that he wouldn't make it this would have to be in what three weeks in the hospital and there i walk into the room there and we pray with him and the lord jesus comes down in a great way and brings a deliverance and raised him up to preach the gospel again amen but as he was coming to that day he was between two dimensions he could look over here and he could see he could see some of those that had went on it was brother branham that was his grandmother there was other and then he could see me and i looked at him and i said brother ron this is not what you think this is not your death i haven't come to anoint you for death i have come to anoint you for life and you're coming up out of that bed in the name of jesus christ in just a few days he's released to go home dimensions are blending the other night lydia had a dream in this dream she dreamed she was dreaming i don't know this is a little different but she dreamed that she was telling me about a dream that she'd had and in her dream she received like a phone call from heaven and it was brother branham brother branham called her and said go be sure to check on your dad he said that your dad to he said your dad is needed and when i when i told her the dream i said back to her yes do remember to pray for me and that's all i'm asking i'm asking that you become a real sincere church that you pray for me that to do the work that i needed to do amen i believe that god's got a purpose i remember back in 2017 you know i i i dreamed it was may the 11th i dreamed that you know that it was so it was so much like a dream it was i i it was hard to tell whether i was dreaming or if it was real but i'll just say it was a dream and i saw a beautiful young woman come into a room and remember a vision and a dream is the same thing it's your you are somewhere some someplace somewhere and then this in this i saw this beautiful woman she had kind of a darker complexion like just really beautiful i i noticed how clear her skin was as she walked in she was dressed in white and and she she she was kind of come in and she come in my view she was looking at me and i was looking at her trying to figure out who she was and as i did as i did i looked at her and i i was kind of thinking and i i looked around to try to see somebody that that i knew to talk to and i i saw brother ron spencer standing there and i said brother ron you see that young lady coming in right there she looks remarkably like my mother and he said yes she does you're right and you know she went over to a place and she she sat down just away from me and as i watched her i could i it was like that i could put in my mind her her old face at 92 years old or so and put it right there and mix those two faces together and pull it back because i've never seen my mother young and it was done as though you know i could recognize her and and she at that moment spoke to me and said yes to him it is me and you know you know my mother my mother was whether it was a great woman she was a in many ways a spiritual woman she loved the lord she was a dedicated christian but you know she was also had her own mind about things and she thought her son ought to just do what she said and so you know i would never let her direct the church and and and give a give um let her opinions be over what the message said because she had her she was opinionated and she gave me a lot of trouble she said in the meeting some of you noticed she was sitting i mean she didn't like a song she just hold her plug her ears like that very disrespectful you know she she would um there was there was just a lot of things that would would go on that i've never told about it's not even necessary to tell but as she come in she and she sat there i looked and i said she said to me yes tim it's me and i've just come to say that you are greatly loved over here and i want you to know i'm sorry for all the trouble i caused you now why am i telling all of these things because this whole thought calls for greater sincerity amen insincerity is a wholeheartedness it's an honesty sincerity is a mixed of seriousness and honesty so you see if you're sincere you're serious if you're sincere you're honest amen you know to be genuine you know to we're not asking with sincerity many times because we don't really believe remember it's only whatever god can lead your soul to believe that's yours so you know sometimes we're not really stopping and realizing and recognizing what the blood has made us he has made us kings to reign on the earth do we genuinely believe that amen we must believe from the heart you see jesus addressed the hypocrisy of his age and he said well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it's written this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me so one way you know they're saying one thing with their lips from their human spirit but in their heart it's not where their lips are this is why he would say many times he said when you ask you receive not because you ask amiss because you're asking something from from your head from your spirit round for your mouth then you're in your heart you don't really believe it now we must believe what the blood has done for us as i've been saying that is that's what the opening of the book to transfer the title just for sons of god it makes us kings with a domain and that domain is the word of god and the priests to intercede forever promise to appropriate that promise so as a priest we appropriate the promise and as a king we rule over situations and brother branham would tell us what the blood did to position us as sons and again there again we're not and he tells us why that it's not working it's because we're not approaching it with sincerity with real honesty with the real seriousness god hiding himself in simplicity i've asked you to listen to that god taking a humble sinner and cleansing him by the blood and dropping that confessed sin in the clorox bleach of the blood of the son of god putting his own life into that man by the baptism of the holy ghost do you believe that the very life of god is in you by the baptism of the holy ghost amen then we have the genuine baptism of the holiest what's wrong with us when the tribe when elijah dropped the road for elisha he got a double portion of it and jesus said the works that i do so you do also and greater than this so you do for i go to my father what's wrong church now you call this belgium of visions and things like that get off my back brother get down the cross get to the gospel well we don't have to impersonate why do you want to take an impersonation why should you take some false conception of it when the skies are full of genuine pentecostal power that makes a man or a woman a son or daughter of god and that takes him back into the presence of god there you are god revealing himself in humility what did he do he humbled himself to death on good friday afternoon that it might rise on sunday easter sunday amen send back the holy spirit upon the church with a double portion on it that we might do the same things that he did and then he promised these signs to follow them that believe how far we get away from him by our own traditions there you are god hiding himself simplicity revealing himself in the empower that's the way god does it that's god's program of doing it yes sir that he might bring many sons across this chasm the blood has permanently are you with me permanently and judas with inborn power so then what's the matter with the church today you know mountain moving power is in the atonement jesus died so we could have it so why aren't we stepping up in faith where is the church that is rising to the occasion who has the sincerity the dedication the faith that says he will not fail us [Music] amen now brother branham is asking the question what's the matter with the church today there's something wrong my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity to the right thing if god could do that by the blood of bulls and goats and and that only covered sin and made a perpetuation for the sinner but sin is still there only covered over what could he do to the blood of his son that emits sin and god is not manufactured but created a blood that takes away all sin i know i know we live in a day of scientific you know where you know people poopoo the whole gospel and they they say well you know i've grown up now you know when i was a child sure i i believe that um they went through the red sea you know and and a fish swallowed jonah but i don't believe that now i'm growing up i know we are living in a day where the faith of many has been overthrowed is somebody with me amen that is being taught in our schools and you know pounded into our young people you've got a tremendous amount of unbelief to overcome and sadly the answer isn't to hide you away in some clustered cave somewhere amen but because you know you must overcome in this evil age there's still got to be believers who write in the face of science says god's word is true amen we know that it works and my way we are the greatest testimony you know people want to come and discredit the message of the hour let me just tell you we we are the greatest testimony of this message that it works it changed us we were sometimes darkness but now we are light in the lord and we are one of the greatest witnesses of the truth of this message you know it was a careful following sincere following of elisha as he followed elijah that brought about being given a double portion it was that same carefulness and sincerity that allowed joshua to have good success because he would not turn right or to the left but he had that dogged that dog sincerity and dedication to follow the word amen as he was told only be thou strong and very courageous that you may observe to do according to all my word and somebody's going to fulfill the word for this age amen you may observe to do all that is written therein if it writes that he's the lord to healeth all diseases we're going to preach that amen if it writes that there's a holy ghost that is safe from sin and change of nature we're going to preach that and we'll see the results of that are you with me amen but it's that same sincerity and holy boldness that we need to bring about that promised double portion brother branham would say god hates a powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity and sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine power worship to know you pass from death to life god wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word when the church explains it away and says it's for some other day and something how can god who wants to fulfill his word perform his word among the people that people denies he does it yet they go through all the rituals that's right you see it's sincerity that is needed amen go with me for a moment mark 16 verse 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe how many believes that now those things are among believers not that every believer does all of those but they are among believers they're going to be in the church and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents now we're not going to break out the snakes now i don't have a surprise for you hey man i think it's more than i'm i think it's more than handling literal snakes when moses picked up the serpent it was showing dominion over the cobra and the cobra was the god of israel and it's his or the god of egypt and his king priesthood and to egypt the sacred serpent represents supreme power and wisdom and when moses there his he cast his rot down and become a serpent impersonators come with janice and jamborees and there swallows them up and he preached that servant up by the trail he was taken up serpent what he was doing was showing supreme power over satan's kingdom from the king all the way down to the peasant in the field amen so therefore he was showing this very supreme power and he said i give you power listen luke 10 19 i give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy now he explains what he is it's the power of the enemy and he says and nothing oh somebody get with me now and nothing shall my enemies hurt you [Music] all the evil in the world including death sickness demonic oppression is the work of satan and demons snakes and scorpions and he says you're going to take them up in other words you're going to render them powerless you're going to bring them nut to nothing when moses serpent took and swallowed at the other the others was no more and i'll tell you amen there is a people that is called in this day and hour to destroy and pull down satan's kingdom they are serpent bruisers that have been prophesied from the book of genesis to come thy seeds that bruise the head of the serpent and i believe right here in this church this morning are serpent bruisers and devil defeaters and overcomers who are empowered by god to defeat the enemy anywhere any place anytime because they extend the world over everything [Applause] and they're not afraid to speak it demons can bluster and rage in order to terrify people amen there's so doubt and there's so fear but i want you to know the very least in the kingdom of god is able to trample on them he's nothing but a bluff brother branham would have a vision of this end time and he would see in there something he said i always wanted to see and that was the serpent bound he said he was there and then the vision remember these are prophecies said i was lifted up and setting on a narrow highway and i said i know this is a vision the lord got us here but it seemed like everybody's afraid i said what are they all afraid of and the voice came and said there is a great danger in these days there's a great hideous things that's death when it strikes you and i'll tell you church we're there we're here where revelation 9 shows that a an angel falls from heaven and he he is given a key to the bottomless pit and he's given permission to bring all of the all of the vermin and the evil out of that pit and it comes up like a smoke and it's a blinding delusion it gets into every crack and crevice of humanity everybody gets affected by it just like smoke it blinds the eyes it causes you to tear up it causes you to you know to not be able to breathe it begins to choke you down that smoke that smoke out of the bottomless pit from which all kinds of evil is about to ascend out into this age in this time and we see it you know you would have to be blind deaf and damn not to see it you can see the evil is in the land there's no hope nowhere except the coming of the lord jesus are you with me about the end of revelation 9 they all become worshipers of idols and worshipers of of gods of all kinds and have you ever seen where the where god has been pushed away and every false idol put in his place some madonna some cover girl some bald star why do you want to be like a ball star spit with your tobacco you're not too tough of a guy you're addicted football too many christians know all their names and how much they raced and how far they went and how many touchdowns they made i wonder if you can become that serious about the word of god i wonder if we're not getting too caught up about the news that we forget the good news i wonder if we're too concerned about the election and who's really going to win this election is all a toss up and what's going to happen and we're in eternal and we forget about the real election and that real election is to put christ there that's the king of our lives [Applause] everybody was afraid if you don't think fear is real you ought to have seen what happened when coveted you just look around just stop and think everybody got afraid everybody's trembling in their boots economy shut down around the world oh yeah there's been people die from it right as people got sick went to hospital from it but i faced it and i found it nothing to fear my wife faced it haven't had three billion brain bleeds in the past there she faced it it lasted for six hours i believe christians can take dominion over those states your yours may last two weeks it doesn't matter but you're taking dominion over it amen don't matter how long the battle goes you know but you just take dominion and that's what believers do they take dominion amen now and so brother branham said i must see this thing that's causing this great danger and he saw it like a big mamba snake and he was crashing through the see the weeds a big monster snake and here he comes it's a great serpent it's sin it's unbelief it's a great danger in this day and it's prophesied that death will ride amen that's the fourth seal the last rider that goes forth the divorce seal is a pale horse and he that sits on him his name is death and hell follows him is that right listen friends things don't ain't gonna get any better death is on its way just as soon as this bride leaves and we can already feel the blow of the nostrils of that horse as he changes from from the black to the pale and as he moves into the pale and becomes he that sat on him is death and hell follows him and that's what's going to follow when the bride leaves her hell will break loose and they ain't got no back seat for it either except for the jews there's 144 000 of them receive the seal of god in their forehead and death can't touch them this has to do with end-time prophecy we're going to land where where all the promises lay but there's something we have to face we have we're going to have to face something called death but he told him you've been given the power to bind him the worst or any you see it's the last plague the last horse rider we've been warned by the eagle i'm not pulling things out of the air this isn't bible prophecy in revelation there are four living creatures the lion the ox the man and the eagle these those are anointings of the holy spirit and the last anointing amen to give you power over the pale horse that is riding and that is the eagle anointing that identifies for the first time who the writer is so that you know who the evil one is you know where the antichrist spirit is coming from you know the truth and that truth has liberated you are you with me and you have yet been given power to bind him the worst or in it here we are seeing the bottomless pit open and the kind of evil spirit that's bringing its death everywhere amen people are dying everywhere from inhaling the deep dark black smoke as it goes into every crevice and crack of humanity and the mind of satan has come in this society in such a way that no age has ever faced even they know it on the political side you know your colleges are set in full of every kind of liberal pushing things down trying to destroy the faith wrecking even the constitution of our united states of america and they've got in and wormed their way in everywhere until you can't even have trust anymore in your elections i'm telling you our hope isn't getting mr trump in our hope is getting out of here [Music] brother branham said he looked at this snake as it came toward him and he said he looked angry at me i i told you that's the way i hope he looks at me he licked his tongue and he'd come and he would run right up and as he'd get closer and closer to him he'd get slower and slower and just quiver and stop because it was something that would hold him off that's what it's got to be for you amen an inoculation of the holy ghost amen that he gets closer and closer amen the closer he gets to you the slower he comes until he stops because if something won't let him bite you i mean turn around and try another side and you try another side and we're watching the devil come from every angle [Music] you get back and get a start swish that's go slower and slower to stop and shake move back couldn't strike me he said i looked and i saw another man there and he said that man he took after my friend and he was jumping at him and the man was just jumping this way jumping that way and up in the air and over him and things striking at him city tried it strikes him if it hits him in sense of death no wonder everybody's so afraid i said god have mercy on my brother that serving strikes me to kill him and the serpent turned to me again when i said that and a voice from above said you've been given power to bind him the worst or any you see it was the serpent that bit eve at the beginning she didn't stay with the word she moved from behind the word and the serpent bit mankind amen was a servant of death that jesus defeated at calvary amen as the first the first of the god race he defeated satan but there are more than sons that has to face that same serpent and overcoming because jesus said you will overcome even as i overcame so you see he's already led the way down through to the church that it can be done that even as jesus had to go to gethsemane and the man jesus you can't say he wasn't dedicated you couldn't say he wasn't sincere you couldn't say jesus wasn't consecrated but it had to come down to a struggle between wills until jesus could say not my will in other words it had to come a deep honesty even deeper expressed by jesus than it ever expressed and he did this in gethsemane we would say but not my will he would ask even ask for his will if it be thy will amen let this cup pass don't let me have to drink this but then he would come back and he would say but nevertheless not my will but thing be done the voice said to brother branham you've been given the power to bind him the worst or any and he says there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere you must be more sincere i said well god forgive me of my insincerity and let me have sincerity and when i raised my hands him again there was something that came on me just lifted me up something like my whole body was charged with something hallelujah when when he prayed there and said lord forgive me of my insincerity and made me more sincere you know i think about the man who came to jesus i think he's a lot like us when he when he came first to the disciples and wanted his his son cured of an epileptic spirit it was a deaf and dumb spirit the bible said but anyway he would throw him into the fire he would have fits the devil would take him over he brought him to his disciples and there was prayer made over him they did everything they knew to do and it wouldn't move there that day when jesus came they met a life and this was a life of prayer it was a life of sincerity it was a life that when a crisis rose there was power to bind the enemy and cast him out that's what i'm talking about a church that lives there in that place where that they have that sincerity about them that when the crisis arises there's faith that rises to the occasion and in this case jesus said how long will i suffer you oh you have little faith why why did you doubt see he had given him but they hadn't had the holy ghost yet to anchor them and stabilize them in that power he said bring him to me and the man said these notable words he says if thou can do anything now look at the question you can see the doubt if thou can do anything heal my son it's my son if you can do anything and jesus said if i can do anything he said all things are possible when you believe it isn't a lack on god's part it's a lack on man's part and this is where that man said in notable words lord i believe help me up my unbelief and that's where the church is right now lord i believe i'm doing everything i can to believe but i need some help i need a child to come over me hey man it comes by when we realize i need that sincerity in my life i need a greater dedication i need a greater consecration i need a more sanctified dedicated walk lord help me forgive me of my insincerity it'll be at that moment like gary stinky the anchor grabs hold it quit bouncing along on the bottom the anchor will grab something and stabilize your faith when he said i did that my whole body was charged with something we need that charge we talked about the power we talked about right right beyond the brink of it but look what it requires it requires a greater sincerity listen you know as he submitted himself to the word you know even brother branham here in this case when he said you know be be more sincere you're going to have to be more sincere you could say well look you know i was eight days and nights in the prayer line i've been as sincere as i know how to be but he realized that there had to be a greater depth of sincerity than what he'd ever reached and he admitted he just said lord forgive me of my insincerity and help me to be more sincere and a charge came over him he didn't throw his arms up to god and say i've been sincere what do you think ah brother i drive two hours to church on sunday every week for church i'm even here on wednesdays and you know i drive and you know i have to listen to we we we're in church for three hours what do you mean we ain't sincere brother branham made no objections he didn't disagree with god and say no i've been sincere uh-huh he just admitted the word was right and said forgive me and let me be more sincere and when he submitted himself the word of charge came home he said it was a great something that just came over me and lifted me up and see my my whole body was charged with something and in the message paradox he said i looked at the serpent he started toward me and said satan in the name of jesus christ i bind you and he said a blue smoke flew out of him and curled up made like an s sign like an n sign and he said it means buying this one or anything beneath him it was in other words when you do this it continues you bind this one every power under it false well i'm telling you church we've got to be the people that bind even death itself what we are changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye that what it does it binds everything beneath and even the dead from seven ages rise this is where we're at but to do this it requires more sincerity then of course you know he took i don't know i'm running a little overtime we got a program this evening but that's okay i got a program right now some things i want to want to bring to you just for a few minutes he said he said lord forgive me he took his bible said that this ain't right forgive me but just show me something in the bible and took his bible and let it fall open said in this time of emergency like that before your spirit leaves me he says let me see and he took and opened up to first corinthians fifth chapter eighth verse when you come to the feast don't come with the old leaven of malice and so forth but come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and brother branham told us again he says he said in there i was not sincere enough actually to come i wanted to come down to purge myself he said to have a purgatory now he said purgatory is not something after you die your purge he said right now you've heard your souls before god and he said i wanted that which has kept me from being sincere it purged out of my life and that ought to be the desire of ours today we hear a prophet saying to do this you're going to have to be more sincere then lord then purge the insincerity out of us and make us more sincere let me take you to first corinthians um five and verse one it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication has not so much as named amongst the gentiles that one should have his father's wife now this was the deplorable condition sin was happening openly in the church and there was a member of the church that it actually did things that the gentiles wouldn't even do you know jewish had jewish people had a law and a a higher order of holiness like you're supposed to have amen but the gentiles they you know they would do a lot of things that that should that the jews would never do immoral acts but he said this is such is not named among the gentiles that one should have his father's wife now this man had taken his father's wife and look at the condition and he said you're puffed up and you have not mourned that he that has done this thing might be taken away from you look at verse six your glory and is not good you're puffed up you're saying we're the bride we're the elect we're the people of god and you're letting sin sit right there and go right on be a member right in the church and he says your glory is not good no you're not that a little 11 11 at the whole lump purge out there for the old 11 that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feasts not with old leaven neither the leaven of malice in wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth you know let me just tell you let me talk personal for a minute as a pastor as a shepherd it's hard sometimes to know what to do sometimes although you know a person is a tear you can't pluck them up without plucking others up and you have to let them grow together but even then there comes a time where the terror must be separated from the wheat and taking his father's wife this man in the book of corinthians was living in sin and he refused to repent and paul rebuked the church saying they had not mourned you're not crying about it that's right you're not you're over here glory and you know what we got so many members and we're so we've got this and we've got this influence and we got this gift and we have this tongue or we have this you know how the corinthian church was and they were boasting and proud and yet they were letting sin how go on in their midst and was not mourning about it and he instructed them he said to purge out the old leaven you know sometimes a church just needs purging you don't like to see it happen but sometimes it just needs purging it needs a cleansing from those who want membership to the society of a church but refuse to repent so you purge out the old leaven that you might be a new lump in other words the church is in danger becoming as described in the book of revelation a cage of ever unclean and hateful bird people sitting there with all kinds of ugly spirits and hard feelings and malice amen well some of your families you can't even have thanksgiving or christmas together shame on you you should be mourning amen come on purge out the old levin that you might be a new lump you see now listen every church has got people who are at different levels in their walk with god some are justified and they've never been sanctified in other words they've repented of their sins but they've still got old worldly habits still on them you know and some are sanctified that means they've been cleansed from the morally habits and they hadn't been filled with the holy ghost now this latter is the most dangerous the most dangerous because the external evidence of holiness is applied without being filled with the spirit and these can even become deacons and trustees and preachers and they had their lack of the holy ghost behind the facade of manufactured holiness we have young people that struggle with sin cutting their hair other elements of the worldliness some of you will drive miles to make sure they're in a ball game when the soul is much more important but you're not serious you see we we have you know it you see we have young people as i said who struggle with sin cutting the hair elements of worldliness it's not it's not intended to push them out of the church that's not what we want but to rather these in the womb to develop and become fully matured and birthed by the breath of god so we will always have those among us who are babes in christ but for people to sit on the pews for years in blatant unbelief and contagious sins that encourages others and leads others to a rebellion and this has to be purged from the church the days of ananias sapphira are here and may the holy spirit bring back painful but necessary separation from the church of the leaven now you're puffed up you have not mourned that he that's done this deed might be taken away from you now notice what happened in the end this man was reconciled back to the church so the intent was never to push him out but to get him to repentance you see there ought to be mourning in the church when we see sin amen not gods have been in the church but mourning in the church amen and i'm just going to say some things here don't take all the medicine on the shelf that i might dish out this morning but if there's something there that the lord preached your heart about make a change amen you know there ought to be mourning in our church when we when we see our young people struggling with sin amen there ought to be mourning we ought to be mourning we're not puffed up oh we're the bride we're the mighty we got the power we you know but we when we see our married couple struggling in their marriage arguing and fussing with them with one another and the home and not in harmony it ought to cause a mourning in the church when we see little sisters in our church struggling with with makeup and cutting hair and short and tight dresses it ought to cause the whole church to mourn when we see preachers committing adultery and falling into sin it ought to cause us to mourn morning when you see people longtime believers struggling to make it to church i don't take this to the extreme because i don't mean it to the extreme but people see long time believers struggling to make it to church and would rather go off camping and fishing and hunting or cruising and the evidence of lukewarm laodice oh to see in spirit taking charge of their lives it ought to cause the church to mourn morning when we know this when we see men are not being fathers taking jobs away from church not setting a godly example being a leader in their families it ought to cause the church to mourn amen when we see more emphasis put it on material things rather than spiritual things it ought to cause the church to mourn you say shut up on that preacher well listen paul said this to him in titus 2 and 6 young men likewise exhort to be serious or sober minded be serious about the things of god and then in all things showing ourselves a pattern of good works in doctrine showing uncorruptness gravity sincerity mourning it ought to cause us to mourn when we see the sick not healed as god promised amen morning it ought to cause it ought to cause crying in the church when we see the move of the spirit stifled brother branham said in what house would you build me he said he said i know each one of you if you feel like i do i'm so hungry to see the spirit of god moving i wonder if there's anybody here like that so hungry to see the spirit of god moving i just can't hardly stand it some experience i've had up the mountain just to feel that once again that's something that when i was first saved was so glorious to my heart and we can come to a place where we can sit and see it among us that we're drying we sit in the desert i get them on my brother and they talk with me i talk with them always a little way of watching feeling out with the spirit and see the condition of that brother see what's wrong and i began to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must worship in the spirit with the spirit of god not only our message uh should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame of our hearts see it's got to be in our heart or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself amen you so so again he said keep the message honorable live the right kind of life don't let no smut come upon it we're living through late night we're too late in the hour let's live it clean my life your life all our lives needs to be picked up before god you've got he said our young people ride from place to place and show this show drifting further and further away from god now that's the truth i see it my children i see it myself getting a place where you've got to assemble ourselves together to worship god the bible says when we see this day approaching that's so much more come together if only two people hear you be one of them and when we if we come together then we just be something about it jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst but we can't be puffed up say well we're just the bride of christ i'm telling you friends you might look at one and i said well we're more we're more dedicated than the methodist people over there we're more dedicated than baptist people over there and we're more dedic is that enough i'm asking you is that enough unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and the pharisees it requires more seriousness a more dedication and agonizing with god to fulfill his word that's what i'm asking you you know lydia was instructed there in that dream pray for your dad he's got a work to do pray for him heaven coming down giving a word to her pray for him but i i'm just wondering are we really agonizing with god to fulfill this word to that we might finish this course that we might run this race with perseverance am i putting everything we got into it oh i know you can turn and look and point fingers and that one needs this and this needs that but what about you brother what about you sister it's not my brother it's not my sister it's not my neighbor but it's me oh lord i'm the one standing in need of prayer that vision of that binding of that great servant death god brother told brother branham god requires a greater sincerity and that's what god's required now there's a call for sincerity there's a call for reconsecration there's a job to be done there's a race to be run and to do it it requires a greater depth of honesty of sincerity a genuineness of wholeheartedness putting your whole heart into it it's what people don't have chaffed at me about our musicians i've told them over and again i preach with my whole heart you put your whole heart into your singing into your music put your whole heart into it every service we should be putting our whole heart into it everything that we got answering the call for sincerity if god is requiring it we ought to say yes lord and i have to say lord i i haven't been sincere enough and you have to look at your own self and admit it admitting it is half the battle you know brother branham had people coming in a prayer line one time and he said they would come in and they would actually be healed read the bible they're blind read the bible words out of the bible and so on and walk off the platform and lose their healing and he said the holy spirit woke him up early one morning and pulled him aside and he's and he's as he as he stood there at the window looking over the city and he says there must be a sincere confession tell these people to confess their unbelief their sins before they come in that prayer line otherwise they won't keep their healing you see what it requires sincere confession we're not playing games it's a serious hour the death angel's in the land and there should be mourning in this church let the musicians come you see this is a time of full restoration full redemption not just redemption foolish virgins are redeemed people they're in the book of redemption they're saved they're redeemed before the bride takes a rapture this side the tribulation but they missed the rapture foolish enough to have made a profession look here they got a lamp they're pretending but they have no oil with their lamps their virgins have made great steps but they ain't went far enough they have a profession of faith but no possession of the oil that's required to keep the lamb burning if your lamp keeps going out and has to be re-lit all the time it's not the fault of the fire it's the fault there's no oil in the lab god's calling for a new dedication a great consecration are you ready to make that consecration are you ready to surrender everything you come into gethsemane well you can quit saying not my will but i want the will of god done i am called for purpose in this end time now let me find that purpose and my purpose isn't to enrich myself it isn't to gain great glory to win great trophies to have great things to have big houses and lands our to our our goal is to be standing there all of a sudden young people start walking in this room tapping you on the shoulder and saying it's owned i've come from that other dimension to tell you that you're no longer needed here but you're needed for this change let's put our heads together father thou knowest lord every heart never desire and every soul you know what the longing is you know what you spoke to them about as i told them don't take every pill in the on the shelf just take what's needed but the holy spirit just saying to all of us is going to require a greater sincerity may it do it today lord may we get forgiven of our sin in sincerity forgive me lord lord there's not a message that i don't put my heart into not hours and hours and hours and praying and praying to the night and even tonight i'm praying through the night couldn't go to sleep till we hours of the morning but yet lord i know you're calling for a greater faith a greater

jesus because we don't believe in infant baptism where that we baptize them before they have any sense of right and wrong but these children have been taught what's right and what's wrong and they've made their mind that they want to serve the lord they come from a wonderful heritage brother john and sister rebecca pruitt love the lord and serve the lord trying to raise their children right but these children on their own have wanted to be baptized taken on the name of the lord jesus and they are sincere about it and they are giving their hearts to the lord and so today we're just going to follow the lord in water baptism now a lot of times young children like this will be baptized at a later date again and maybe when they come a little older and they realize a little more as they make a re-consecration that's all right but we as soon as they um are of age or that they make up their mind in their heart they want to serve the lord and and whatever we follow the we get them to follow the lord in obedience to water baptism john paul is here john paul pruitt and john paul the lord jesus sent brother tim to the world to preach the gospel and he commanded us everywhere that we go to baptize those that believe on the lord in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost now in obedience to that divine command i'm going to baptize you now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord he said lord little sister haven is coming here she wants to obey the lord in water baptism too and you know as i've said many times you know we're not too young to serve the lord i started serving him when i was five years old and he went to the altar gave my heart to the lord later time was baptized but these young children are wanting to follow the lord and today we're here to fulfill a divine commission haven the lord jesus sent me to preach the gospel and he ordained me to do so and he told me in his word that when those believed on the lord that i was to baptize them in the name not titles but the name of the lord jesus christ so it's the in that name that we come so knowing that he commissioned me to baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord amen thank you [Music] there's a light in the window the table spread and splendor river i must be near
