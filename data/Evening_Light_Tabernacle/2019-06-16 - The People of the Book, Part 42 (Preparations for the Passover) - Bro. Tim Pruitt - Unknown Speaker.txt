your mercy and that your your promises are yes and amen and you never fail us you're always with us you never leave us or forsake us what a mighty God you are how we need your touch today and the anointing of your spirit because with that it is that anointing that breaks the yoke Lord it takes the yoke of sin and darkness and unbelief off of us and helps us to believe I pray Lord your blessings upon your people today in its you would anoint 'im of God from on high you touch hearts and tender lives and change us in your presence may not one of us leave from here the same person we were when we came in but find us changed in your presses I ask Lord for healing and deliverance for your children not only here but from around the world and we just ask that you've administered our hearts and lives we ask in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning a man could deceits one of you that has assembled together with us today and we want you to feel welcome is happy that you're here to be with us today and amen see ya brother Steve Martin coming under glad to have him his family today and sitting there in the mezzanine so happy to have you in the service today and in it good to be a Christian in it good to have a father a man I'm glad that we know Jesus and that we can say he is our father we have been birth by him and of him Amen and in him his life and he is the source of our life this morning a man so trusting that God will just speak to us today I just came back of course last Sunday was the or Saturday was the wedding that we had here and we had where the window Martin was a guest Minister Forrest so we certainly enjoyed that I knew you would enjoy him and then saw I didn't want you to miss that treat so we had him to minister while he was here and so but I just come back from brother Jason Jackson's there and we just had some tremendous meetings as the Lord blessed us I think there were about 10 very major miracles that happened in that meeting and God bringing some real deliverance and brought a real healing to some situations there that man couldn't handle man couldn't touched and but God knew how to do it he come right down and brought a deliverance that was just just phenomenal this supernatural because only God could do it brought a healing to his brother Jason's family and to his church and I believe it will have a lasting effect amen so then we then we also was with spoke with brother Mike price while we was up in that area at his church and he just told us the Wednesday night before they had they had six very major healings that had taken place and that service and so we just hear the the Lord moving all over the place Amen I'm glad to know that it's not just in one little place but God's moving by his spirit and you can expect God to move when you start believing we start testifying on his his wonder-working power we're gonna look at Exodus chapter 12 today and we're going to be reading from the first verse and I want to read about the Passover that the first Passover were there was actually the death angel passing over this is not the commemoration that would be done by Israel for thousands of years but this was the actual Passover so we're going to be speaking today on preparations for the Passover because we are also living in another time and this is not another commemoration of a feast where it's just a tradition but this is actually where there's a death angel in the land and there must be an exodus from here amen and we we must make preparations for that Exodus chapter 12 verse 1 and the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking to all the Israel a congregation of Israel sayin in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls and every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb and your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper post doorpost of the houses William they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh and that night with fire and unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not a bit wrong or sudden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence dare of and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your stop in your hand you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I was passed through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt may God bless you can be seated right now we are in another great time of an exodus this is a rapture our I believe we are in an end time and as it is in a rapture our I think is the the prophet of God said in in this about the seventh age this last age that we're living in is the age that takes the rapture and he is clear that even as there are night watches even so God you know through the church ages he also had watches and so Jesus is to come for his bride in the seventh watch which is the seventh church age that we're living in so we're right here in the very time of the coming of the Lord we know this is also shown by examples in the scriptures as is typed out for example Enoch was raptured the seventh from Adam it's showing that it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture and so there's no doubt that we are here in the seventh chapter our seventh church age nor the last last age where there is to be a rapture for the raptured without death will be called out of the seventh church age and we are now bearing record of that church age so we're living in a very awesome wonderful hour today and the rapture hour in this Exodus is a time of the Passover as the death angel is definitely going through the land you can see it death is upon upon the world that we're living upon in its upon Society it's a it's here in America it's shown in our marriages is shown in family units is found in you know among our youth is found everywhere the death angel is definitely going through the line and as the death angel goes through it will plunge this whole world into great tribulation where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth even as in that first Exodus that there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth as a mourn because of the results of what the death angel had done and the night of the Passover they were on they were also on the eve of great joy you know he was it was not just a time of of great trepidations in trouble but it was also a time where they were at an anticipation and it was a with great joy that they were they were looking to in Israel was going home at last I wonder where it will be I mean the realization as a people that we're going home at last that the trouble the sorrow the problems of the AIDS of problems of this life the sicknesses that are in the body will be free from it we're going home at last 101 up expectation to look to and and even though we know that death is coming on the world and we know that death is coming into our society and death is in our schools and deaths is in our nation yet at the same time we can have a great joy because we have an expectation we're under an anticipation that we're leaving here and we're going to escape the things that are coming on the earth but not only and leaving here we're going to be free from slavery amen free at last rapture bound I believe that's who I'm talking to this morning a people that are rapture bound that are saying I am a part of this Exodus I am getting ready to leave now for the world around them to own it was a lot of time of joy but it was a time of sorrow and trouble in wool and the Bible describes us in Revelation 12 where he says woe to the earth for the come down to you with great wrath so it tells us about the approaching death angel and Satan coming himself to become king of the earth for just a short time while the bride is in glory with with Christ and but yet upon the world will come a great time of trouble and so Cyril and will like neighbors been upon the earth and for Israel dis was it was a this night was the birth of a nation it was our birth into a new land and they were going by an accident sand and irises quite different ours is not a birth into a physical land like that but this date is a earth into a rapture it's a birth into a heavenly round that all believers have longed for down through the years and for ages and ages and what I'm preaching about is something that is very real it's not an imagination it's real the Passover was not just so saving from death but it was the birth into new life and so we want to think about it even every time that a person comes under the token comes under the blood it's filled with the Holy Ghost you see it's the idioms a birth into a new life it is not just to saving from death but it's the burden to a life and so this this birds would begin as a new life of grace and fellowship with God and it was this fellowship God wanted it renewed perpetually a man that every generation would also have this fellowship and would enter into this Passover Feast and have this time of remembers when the Death Angel passed now so we want to think though about this Passover this morning when we use this phrase I don't want you to think about a feast a physical feast like this word that it would be commemorated year after year but I want you to think of the first time the very first time when the death angel was coming right down to every dollar the very first time when Passover didn't mean a feast it meant there was death passing over that those that were under the sentence of death and I'll just tell you we're all under the sentence of death remember there's a lamb that died in our place and because of that lamb he took our sentence of death and won the rap that we should have God was poured out upon him are you with me now and so I don't you to think of this is just a Passover of a celebration and a meal and a remote memorial I want you to realize we are in another Passover where the death angel is again in the land now it's a time of desperation the reason for the command was not to go to not go out of the door or the house was in this night of judgment there would be no safety anywhere except behind those blood-stained doors everything else that was not behind that blade blood-stained door I want to get it to you even this celebrates perhaps in Egypt many other people were doing you know having meals and banquets and and other things but if there's not a blood stained or that that the angel still comes in I want you to understand it's not about just having church and coming together for spiritual feast but if we must be under the blood the blood life of Christ must have been set for us and accepted and applied and as we dealt with it it's applied on both side for both side posts and then over the lentil which which means were for us it would be the body here's the entrance into us the body the spirit realm and the soul and it must be applied in all three places remember not one place not two places not just on the body not just on the spirit but it must be in all three places it must be in that soul now death was approaching and I did want to share with you some scripture that shows you in the fourth seal that of how that as if actually you see things are changing we're in a very time of change where the horse riders of revelations has started out you know with just a white horse a very insidious spirit but maybe looked quite harmless you know rider one white horse with the bow and no arrows and even many in many of the theologians would think it was Christ but it wasn't it was the Antichrist and he starts rising and he's a spirit and then he becomes crowned and the next time and changes to red and he slaughters there's 68 million down to the ages where that just on their record of a word he got it sort bloody chilling the chilling the elect of God are you with me and it all happened within a religious system then it changes from that to a black horse rider and there again with the black horse of the rider on the black horse he's he's selling the staples of life which would happen were that you know the church would begin to charge so much for repentance and so much for novenas permission to sin and and covers for sin when the blood of jesus paid it all but now finally it changes from that to the last horse to ride now remember it's the same horse it just Saints his colors it's the same rider he just morphs into a different one he just changes their accordingly as he starts out an insidious spirit then he gets crowned then he goes forth but with the with the power state behind him then he begins to slaughter with it with the sword and then then he begins to to distort knowledge and begins to bring about a dark ages and finally here's his last ride and we're approaching it what I'm talking about death this is what's coming revelations six and eight and I looked and behold a pale horse now this pale horse is no certain color he's a mixture of white red and black so he's called pale he's a he's a combination of all three his name that saddled him was death now we find out who it was all the time it was death starting out in the first church with the Volt's doctors come on then it was it was death riding there with the sword there conquering through political systems Rome would do this Rome would take and use her political power there to to slaughter sixty-eight million Christians that it wouldn't bow down to the Pope then you come into the next one then it brings his Dark Age know what and it sells have any staff of life a major wheat for a penny a measure of barley for a penny it sells a very stop of life but now he changes and we're right here in the middle of the change he can't come into full power until there's an exodus he can't come and do his full work until a people leave here the death angel can't do its damage and Childers of people under the blood and prepared for an exodus are you with me and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death now we know who he was all the time and hell followed him amen now you all you have to do is read the book of Revelation and you see that I was a bottomless pit comes every kind of evil spirit because he'll follows this and he says power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth so now power is given to him to kill so here we come right back down to where we are here in this end time and death is about to ride through the land I wanna I want you to I want to impress upon your this congregation I want to impress upon you young people death is coming in it's coming in and every kind of way that man is coming in through media is coming in through pornography it's coming into every kind of sin that you can imagine it sin has now become and become greater than ever and all of the powers of hell is heaping up against this generation and pressing in on you and without the blood you'll never keep him out of your door and the blood is the Holy Ghost it's not just a magic word it's the spirit or the life of the blood which is the life of Christ the Holy Spirit you must have the Holy Ghost this is very important now I would like to to just show you this in the scripture because spirits can take on different forms now this is shown in in 2nd Corinthians 11:13 for such a false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore there's no great thing if his ministers be also be transformed as men the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works so now Paul is very clear he said that the Satan is a transformer he will transform himself from one thing to another we've seen it just with the horse riders when we talk about that the first four seals and we see it there transform him from white to red to black the pale and it's the same spirit all the time just changing now you know brother Branham would solve many many visions and I want to just speak about one this morning I'm not going to read to you all the account I just want to just share with you but he he saw himself in a vision coming down to Jordan you can find this in the message paradox so that was coming down to Jordan and look like I was standing on the map of Palestine and I could hear this song say him I'm going down to the Jordan and he said because I drew near the river I look back I look back the way that I'd come and I was now two-thirds of the way of the journey he had come through two phases of his ministry and he said - oh praise the Lord on the other side is where all the promises like every promise lays in the promised land now this is true for you as an individual your Jordan is death to self and man and entered into the Holy Ghost and then the Holy Ghost is wherever promised lays this is true of the church our promised land he is the Holy Ghost man and we must cross we must cross Jordan of death to ever idea map and enter into the full promises of God because where would there in the Holy Ghost is wherever promised lays a map the promise does not lay in theology it is not lay in man's ideas or our great knowledge and wisdom of man it lays in the Holy Ghost amen now and of course as we as he said I was looking here and we were approaching the crossing over into the fullness of the promise and he said again he said I I then saw a highway a highway and it was an hour highway and I had been lifted up on it and and he said I know this is a vision I I know God is here said but seem like everybody's afraid because you know here again they're trying to get into this promised land and I'd hear there's there's all kinds of reason to be afraid and he said this voice came and said there's such danger in this day that there's a great hideous thing that his death when it strikes you and then he said I saw here come a monstrous snake he said I knew it was a Mamba it was the most poisonous one it could be and he said yeah you know I saw it there and he was on the highway and he said you know he would run up fast to me and he's sick but something would hold him back now that's where you want to be in this hour that you're living in when death is all around are you on me are you with me these people here Ivania if this was the original Passover that had something to hold death back it was random to know and every individual every one of us every Church was something that I hold back that that vigil because he's gonna approach every one of us a man sent over take you the wickedness of this world you're not strong enough you're not able to keep it back you must have the Holy Spirit you must have the Tok so he said I looked over and he said I saw him after what a friend of mine and said he was jumping in and dodging it and and he was chasing him and he was running from him with everything and he was about to get him and he says Oh God Oh God you know what can I do he's gonna he's gonna get my brother and then the voice of God said but you have the power to bind him now I want you to understand something we've got to have that power and I believe the binding power to bind the serpent it's right here in this build in this moment I believe it's right in God's church I believe it's right in God's people the power to bind the serpent I'm at the power to bind sin and to bring an individual under place where they too can be it'll situation where it holds the death angel back a mouth so as as he was speaking of it and he came out of that vision and this is where I want to get to brother Branham was told he said now to bind a serpent you're gonna have to be more sincere hey man you're gonna have to be more sincere see this is the reason to be able to bind the serpent you're gonna have to be more sincere there's got to come of sincerity along with the message of the hour with that sincerity comes a desperation comes an honest word that we we get serious with God and brother Branham was asking then well then what must I do and he said surely Lord there's something here in the Bible that would show me what I am to do and and he he said I you know you know the kids are leaving for school and and I've got to drive them to school midnight this emergency Lord we just show me as I open the Bible is there a scripture is there scripture you can just you could just show me and he said it opened up right here to this scripture and this is where we want to read from first Corinthians 5 and verse 7 and by the way I didn't plan this but when my Bible opened it opened right there I didn't have a marker they just fell open there we're here right at that place we're gonna have to be more sincere first Corinthians 5:7 purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feasts not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth amen I just need a confirmation is it there is it there is it there so he's a witness we're not playing Church anymore we're in a very serious hour now as I go forward here maybe some things might just kind of go over your head but hold on there Bible truths because we happen to be living in a day an hour where that the book of Revelation is very pertinent to us very important because it talks about the end time plan God reserved things for the end time and and so in the Bible it speaks about the seven seals which I just shared with you for them and speaking about the horse riders these were symbols symbolic rode as in symbolic form in the Bible because God reserved them to the end time in there in Revelation chapter one through three it would tell about seven churches and these are Gentile churches and these would be symbolic of seven ages and we're now at the last one Laodicea and as I told you we're gonna be raptured from the Laodicean age not another not beyond it but in this age now so the revelation of the seven seals it opens back to us our homeland it brings us back to where we were before that now this is something I'm going to emphasize on this morning it brings us back to where we were before in other words Israel had been in the land will call it Palestine for lack of a better word but they had been in the land of Palestine and they had sojourned now for four hundred years down in Egypt and this was a time to go back to their home life are you with me now this is it we're that we are out we are the revelation of the seven seals it opens to us the homeland it brings us back to where we were at the beginning to the original Pentecost amen where the power was given first to bind the serpent to bang sin to give a power to the church that sin would no longer reign in your mortal body we're quoting Romans chapter six now now brother Branham would speak of the token message and and it was a message on the Holy Ghost you must have the life of the blood the Holy Ghost so the token message he called it the highlight message of his entire ministry can you imagine summon all his entire ministry these are his words my entire ministry he says is the highlight message now why because weird another Exodus and like in Moses did he where he gave a message for the exodus so did he and you know so does so did he did the same he brought us a message on how to get ready to leave here and that ought to be the the joy of the church right now is that we're leaving we're not staying it'll get darker it'll get more even there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth there will be a Great Tribulation to follow I'll even but we're not going to be here for it we're going to escape and this Exodus was an escape from the death things and man it was escape from Egypt's bondage and this is an escape we're escaping the things that are coming on the earth what Jesus told us always pray always pray always that you escape the things that are coming on the earth so after his sermon on the on the message of token he preaches a sermon desperations now this is to follow this highlight sermon it's it's it's actually a really a part of it because he carries his whole thought right on over into the evening desperations and he reads from Jeremiah 29 in verse 10 and I want to I want to get this to you jeremiah 29:10 from dust saith the lord that after seventy years we accomplished that Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you and causing you to return to this place now here was Israel in another exile and now they were going to return back to this place the place of their beginning they had been down in Babylon come on but now they're coming back to their homeland Exodus was a back to the homeland now they're in a another time of coming back to their homeland now understand that's what we're at as a people we are returning back to the original coming right back to Pentecost again hey map now so he says again he says I I will perform I will visit you he saw these ought to be just magnificent words to us look at this scripture go back in that verse verse 10 please he says I will visit you we're in our visitation I'm a visit you after the time of exile is over and we're at the time where that's all is over can i bounce it to you amen the dispersal is over where we have wondered down through seven churches we are with now over is the time to return return with all your hearts and the reason that this return is happen is because people faster than you my good word not just preach my work but performant I'm vindicated again with signs and wonders and miracles and healings with delivers calls you to return to this place and I believe there's a V people that are being caused to return back to that original place where the church fell from a man now so as we look at it he says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you there are thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in these are my thoughts that I have for you my thoughts is not to leave you here vulnerable to the death angel my thoughts are not to send you through tribulation for more purging my thoughts that I have toward you are a piece of evil because I'm going to bring you an expected here back to that land then shall you call upon me and you should go and pray unto me and I will hearken to you somebody say yes Lord a madman you shall call upon me you separated me and I'll listen to ya I'll hear you do you know they've been prayers that have been prayed that God's that I can't answer that now one of the last prayers of the Bible was even so come Lord Jesus but we're an hour the time where he's listening to that prayer every time you say don't leave me here every time you do something God God's hearing he's making preparations rooms people he's getting you ready for Exodus and you shall seek me and find me Amen when now here it is here it is when ye shall search for me with all your heart you see when you quit being half-hearted and halfway about it but when you really get sincere when you really begin to say Lord I want you both the life itself I will not let apply more than life itself more than getting married more than happened uh you don't this spotter doing there sir all right this subtraction I love you both I want you you take the whole world just give me Jesus hey ma'am when you saw search for me with your whole heart and I will be found of you what words I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I'll gather you from all nations and from all other places whether I have been driven you saith the Lord and I'll bring you back into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captain now brother madam reads a scripture in there and he's this is what he adds when he says this I'll bring you back to the place where I caused you to be carried away captive and he says back to Pentecost now I put that in myself it doesn't say that but that's what I was meaning to the church so where is he going to bring his back back to the place of our origin now soon so you see before the Passover there that must though be a cleansing of eleven and eleven is a type of sin and of course one source of leaven is doctrine is that right we'll deal with some other sources maybe another service but right now that one source of Lebanese is doctrine because Jesus told him said beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and he said that the disciples said you know what are you trying to tell us he said the Pharisees doctrine is 11 so doctrine is leaven some doctrine is lemon added to the word are you with me now so you see the seals the opening of the seals expose eleven and in his giving us bread without the addition of corruption you see the lemon is a yeast and it makes the bread more you know palatable it more pleasant more desirable you know sin is always desirable even these doctrines become appealing you know they excite the mind and people get excited over over this lever talk all them doctors and doctrines of devils from seducing spirits so seduction is always an excitement goes with it you take a man and a woman in there you know married to each other and dullness comes in their marriage and there there's what well this extramarital affair comes in there's a there's something you know goes on and it becomes a drive and a conquest and the Bible calls these things seducing spirits and doctrines of devils doctrines of devils that are seducing spirits spirits of seduction and they have the euphoria let's just go back to Genesis chapter 3 and verse 4 where the first spirit of seduction was shown on earth and this serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die now listen they wouldn't have died if they would have stayed with the original unleavened bread of the word of God but here now comes in leather they have the pure word given from God but now here the serpent comes in with kids interpretation so now here he says here he says for God that know that the day you eat thereof that your eyes can be opened and you some years God's knowing good and evil and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her a husband with her and he did eat so he had a leaven he just twisted the doctrine of God just a little bit and just changed one word and brought death on the whole human race now if they did just realize the death angel was standing there in the front of the and in front of them called the serpent a man they have a word are you with me then a word that would keep him out but he just opened just a little of it and he steps ready so this is what has happened today because we're seeing the serpent read between the lines again read between the lines as to what God says and it brings death what was read between the lines wasn't matching what was on the line is that right the severn added his leaven to make it desirable it and it's so cheesy that they would could eat knowledge and knowledge puffs up the bread it makes it lighter and easier to eat and today men have added all kinds of Lebanon into the bread and to do so contaminates the message of the hour and what it does the message is no longer pure and it loses its power now as I was saying this first Passover was not a tradition it was not a reenactment it was not commemorating and remembering that that things it was real and there was more to it than just the blood striking on the door now we get that you know we got to get the Holy Ghost brother to him we gotta get the Holy Ghost got a had the Holy Ghost we gotta have the we've got to have that experience we got that but that's not all of it I want you to understand that's not all of it in behind the Holy Ghost there's a life that is going on that is a pure life with unleavened bread and the whole lamb there's a lot of things that goes with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and people are saying they're under the bud and this ain't happenin here is because there's no real lamb back there we're just imagining and we're pretending because behind the blood behind the Holy Ghost after you receive the Holy Ghost it's gonna bring you into a sincerity a preparation a man is going to bring you into feast with the Lord it's going to bring you to where you eat the whole lambeth and it's going to bring you to eating unleavened bread these are a lot of the signs that you really got the blood on the door it's not just oh I had experience down the altar and I prayed through brother Tim my brother Tim how I remember ho ho I remember that day lay in my hands on the lamb and feeling this suffering yo yes brothers him I remember doc Calabria I remember how he died and bowed his head and cried oh I remember it I remember brother Tim when I when the blood struck my body of there and make up left in the shorts and the pants and the cigarettes and the beer and all those other things they just fell off them yeah I remember when that happened I remember when the blood struck my spirit and there in my memory my imagination my conscience my affection my reasons all changed everything about the Bible became different my reasoning changed my memory was washed I've no longer looked at a drunken party and thought wow didn't we have a good time right you have that memory once right you look back on the party oh man wow wow you know did we I mean we drinking there was girls and there was you know all of the other things that went with it I mean you remember that it was a great memory but when the blood was applied to your memory you look back at that same memory and your member had been changed you remember something different about that are you with me hey man you know I saw the wrong my conscience was purged by the blood my affections in was settle things above all brother Jim I assure them that that Holy Ghost struck my soul I'm sealed in the day of redemption I I'm protected from the Angel of Death and it's true it's true we're sealed behind the blood to never go out again and Satan's sealed out we're sealed in but the accepting the the death of the Lamb and applying gives life to your your doorpost of your body spirit and soul remember all rounds there was three sets of bud one on each side and one over the door and it represents we're at least we're using that for this sermon it's representing the body the spirit and the soul because those are all entrances and the entrance must be covered by the blood so you see now and accepting that into your life and applying that blood it's only a part of the death angels Passover so me it's only a part you see that wasn't all the instructions applied the but now you're free to run around you're free to go out you're free to watch the fireworks as the Death Angel comes ya know you apply this blood you got to be inside and you got to be making preparations for leaving your hope has got to be in one thing I'm leaving here I'm not staying here you've got to have an anticipation of a rapture I don't know what's going on today with preachers that taken away the anticipation for a rapture but brother we should be looking every day every moment for the coming of the Lord under its axis don't wrap that from the church now but do you see there were preparations for the journey you know these were part of the same instructions you must get ready to go you you dress yourself you have your garments on your shoes on your feet you have your stuff in your hands and then your needs are you with me he just getting the blood and glory to God hallelujah I'm really happy now that's where I'm bringing the deficit it really happened and the death angel who you know it is going to pass you by then it's going to be more than just saying oh I had this experience that the Holy Ghost and it washed my body and it washed my conscience and my memory and affection and I'm sure so my soul isn't if it's really there you're gonna be making preparations to leave here you're gonna have an expectation and anticipation a desperation I must not miss it now and then you are d now eating is a part of your salvation now that sounded good to somebody somebody's stomach just ground right there it's a part of the requirement to cause the death angel to pass over so part part of this was the plan of the blood part of it was done leavened bread and the whole lamb and also Pilate is eating it now you cannot are you with me you cannot expect to see the Death Angel pass and you're eating every other kind of nonsense feeding on every kind of things of the world and your minds and every kind of video gaming the evil thing and imaginations ready here and running there you're attracted here that it's gotta be at one thing I believe in bread because I got a hat straight for the journey I'm gonna have face for a rapture and Lord I have that strength that comes by that faith by that bread and that lamp I won't believe I won't be able to go I'll be too weak to leave so eating it as part of your salvation did you know coming to church as part of your salvation people come half hearted half the time mostly none of the time they won't come to the house of God they saved that that thing's wills getting the kids death angels working in their families your attitude toward Christ is gonna have a huge impression on your children a man and that's an attitude it's an attitude of it doesn't matter it does matter it don't just matter you know it's just not I eat it every day for the team but buddy I'm really into those traits and I'm really listening into that word and I'm really really reading my Bible I really didn't well then come to church then I mean if you read your Bible you'll come to church I mean you'll forsake not the assembling of your something you can't read the message and decide to stay home from church you'll be here every time the door is open hey mom why because it'll burn in your heart I've got to get there I'm desperate about this I'm sincere about this the servant must be bad I must keep him out of my hog and man he must not get a place in there anywhere is somebody with me a man now so it's part of your salvation the whole lamb must be eaten with unleavened bread and it must be Oh eaten I'd like to show you this and we will get into it in a later sermon because I'm acting like an old man and preaching kind of slow this morning but I'm trying to let you just seek Him I'm trying to land every word with a meaning you don't miss it Exodus 12 8 and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread with bitter herbs shall they eat it eat not a bit raw nor sudden it all with water but roots with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinents thereof and you shall lack nothing of it remain until the morning oh now we we got this idea of this this and this lamb sitting on this platter you know a nice leg quarter we are maybe a rack of ribs that ain't the bass over the Passover is the whole lap it was from the head to the tail and man I mean it's kind of like my wife and I you know went into into a woman when the country is over in Europe one time and which we ordered trout and it comes out but you know I had two eyeballs and a whole body of fish you know laying out on the platter and she said I just can't eat this with it looking at me but in this Passover it's all served I want you to get it now because if you look down in verse 46 in chapter 12 and what house shall it be eating thyself not carry forth out of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall you break a bone thereof so there couldn't be a bone broken I mean it was cooked it was cooked from Ed from head to tail hoods all pertinents thereof no some say they wash the insides I don't know how they did it all I know is the whole lamb had to be served ever been it we're in another Passover and in order to go in this Exodus you must eat the whole lamb you see other ages have cut it up separate the lamb discarded what they didn't like I'd see them saying spirits that gets right in a message and you find that you know to make their doctrine work they have this whole pile of discards quotes that they have to discard to make their doctrine work you know why cuz they they can't they don't want the whole lamb it's Susan not under the token because if you're under the token under the life of Christ you are get out you want the good punch you up the back part you are things that are difficult to swallow down and you want things that are pleasant you want it out let it come down to preach and holiness you love that man when it comes down to preaching about tithing you love that when it's written about church attendance you love that when it comes down to the seals of the mysteries atop you love that you love it out the whole lamb must be sold not just your part denominations have done this three years they discard some of it serve only the pieces they want they've added eleven to the bread but this is our the Passover this is not just another feast this is not just a commemoration and well it doesn't we don't have to pay attention to details because there's no that thing's all this time no we're in another time where there's another death things and this was a time where everything's gonna be eaten everything's gotta be served some our desperation if you don't pass over you you'll be left with weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth you must escape what is coming on the earth having part of the lamb will not work having bread with 11 of denominations won't work either it must be the fuel it must be the whole and unbroken I love it now denominations have run off with parts this part this part they serve ribs this part here serves the breast this denomination over here they like the hindquarters you know you know they you know these this southern they want lamb chops and it's something with water and spiced up and the word the mean of the lamb is impregnated with with the flavor of denominations you can go with a favorite Baptists or Methodists or Pentecostal or whatever and you can get your lamb flavor to all kinds of ways it can be flavored for the times hello you know today we want a gospel flavored for the times and so will flavor everything I think brother Timothy spoke about the vegans the other day you see that's just the spirit and the way in the land and the last days and brother Bantam called it this isn't he said it's a non meeting he coat he described it a coat and is there is there because of the animal rights and animal worship and it's a satanic spirit that's exactly what it is and you come around you know then the spirit gets on our girls that you know they don't want to lose their identity in their husband anymore so they hyphenate their names so they can keep their own identity it sounds exactly like what has happened in the spiritual round there's all kinds of things you know that we we're the flavour for the times you know you're not to preach against sin and you know not to say homosexuality and perversion is a sin you're not supposed to do that because we want it flavored for the times and that's what is happening today that's what people want a gospel they want a gospel flavor again to their liking and so if they can't find it here for their like in they find it somewhere else where it's a little easier to eat and they serve the pieces I like flavored the way I want it that I can have Christ and salvation and I can flavor it where you know anything can be accepted hey ma'am so you know as I said denominations have have flavored it time we wanted flavored for them for the times then I'm gonna come down to something because we're in our where it's desperation where it requires more sincerity come on Amen for the first time the pillar of fire has cooked the lamb it's been roasted with fire of a real fire not a painted fire but a real science you pay the fire believes it raw and he said don't eat around it it not suck with water and impregnated with all your flavors but I want you to do this get the pillar of fire and get it hot I'll tell you that ain't nothing wrong with the message today the problem is we ain't [Applause] [Applause] give the right flavor to a holy man's taste but the first time the pillar fires cooked the whole lamb from head to tail I'm sure the Pentecostal partner was served a divine healing and joy and baptisms of the Spirit it was heated - he got warm got hot I'm sure Luther got his hot when he started but I'm bringing it down to you we're not in the day a part of the lamb we're in the day word the whole lamb is required the whole lamb is not being served the only thing it's unsealed see the skins been taken off you don't kick it you don't cook it with the skin on it right so in order to cook it you know it took cooking to see if the skin the lamb must be unsealed are you in the now and ordered for this word to be received you can't cook it with the skin on it I'm seeing lab so Allah we believe that's all open but the second well you still got skin on it you can't cook it with that it's got to be skinned got to be unsealed the seven seals are open by the revelation thereof must be pure bread without leaven no knowledge of man's interpretation added to it to puff it up you know knowledge puffeth up and when you get man's knowledge in the bread it pops it up a man and so and so you see again we're back to a time where it's pure bread without leaven no leaven no knowledge of man's interpretation added to puff it up that's what is now being served the whole lamb that Paul served is the whole I'm that we're now serving a man brother madam would talk about this in the masterpiece and he said the first ministry and the last ministry is the same the first message and the second last message is the same thing we don't have a new message I want to get that if I can get anything in this part of this service today I want you to get something we do not have a different message than what Paul please this is the original message the fresh message and the last message is the same thing I was alpha and I'm Omega now this is what is happening people can see the truth and hear the message and say well you know now we got we got we got something they didn't have brother Tim you see we we got something old Paul didn't have you know well I'll tell you if you do if you do have something different than what Paul preached you're cursed well we have something more than Apollo you're cursed we have the seals at and before you know Matt and before the seals heaven declared that brother Branham preached what Paul preached but after the seals brother Bradley got something more than you're cursed by the way just to straighten all of that out he was seen himself when he would enter into death and when he entered into death they told him you preach what Paul preached [Music] in the Laodicean age he said the spirit will not speak in another age this is the last message the ages are over but thank God at this moment this agent is not over he is yet crying in his cries not only in the spiritual ears of men by his spirit but once again a prophet is in the land once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul somebody came in on this man once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the Laodicean age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benefit beneficence effect of that province ministry day that will hear him will be blessed become a part of that bride in the last days who are mentioned in revelation 22:17 the spirit in the bride's that come the quart of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground that Nicaea has come back to the original word grain again again not a different one again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last stage what he says from God the bride will say and the spirit and the prophet and the bride would be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word hey man you know when brother Branham first approached the seven seals and he tells us in services this the time he speaks about them he said their seals in the book and then their seals on the backside and that's what he thought he thought those seals on the backside were revelations on the outside the book but then he comes down to one of his last sermons and he says at the beginning of the seals so seven angels came down this is from spiritual food and due season angels came down in that pyramid Foreman stood down and told me to return back to speak on those seven seals and he'd be with me he'd show me what they were the lost things the seals were the lost things I always thought it was sealed on the back of the book and it was something it be something that wasn't wrote in the book but it turned out then it was made known that he cannot do that it is not something written in the book is something that's been hid in the book for whosoever shall take one word from it or add one word to it so it's a mystery that has been the in the book in these seven ages and each one of them produced a mystery about water baptism these other things they stumbled of so long so brother Brennan said no it's not on the outside the book it's not a it's not something added to the book it was something hidden in the book and what I'm trying to get to you if we you see it was previously known to the church now brother bang tells his story of talking to a man who tried to trap him and the man said you know brother Brandon with your great gifts you can get you can get a direct word from God and breathe names that are not even in the Bible and you know the marlins did this Joseph Smith claimed to receive tablets which were they made us they claimed were additions to the Bible so they have the Book of Mormon but I want you to understand what we received today is not an addition to the Bible we don't have the Bible plus we have the word has revealed the Pope now he tells him this theologian that tried to catch him and said to him with your experience brother Brown that the Lord has given you first people you'd be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word that God has manifested now what's it sounds real good you you know with your gifts with what you have is a gifted man you can write a Bible to yourself and brother Branham said but you see I couldn't do that he said well why couldn't you you've got the qualifications he said but look one word cannot be added or taken away so well then seven thunders wouldn't it be great then seven thunders blasting out would that be a revelation given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something or taking something from it's all revealed in there and the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was that's what it was and it C is still in the word you see you can't get out of the word it won't leave the word and God's Spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word behind did something open to the eyes of others he'll always do that you see it's a terrible misunderstanding that somehow today we got something different a further revelation than st. Paul we got something more I think that we made that conclusion by acknowledging that Paul didn't know the mysteries of the book of Revelation from what we can tell in the time and that Paul was called home before the book of Revelation was revealed to John it would come sometimes some years afterwards so Paul didn't know that and so now because we are now privileged to understand these mysteries so that we come to the conclusion now we got something to Paul didn't out while it's true that the book of Revelation wasn't given until after Paul went off the scene and yeah he had never heard about the horse riders and the seals and the seven thunders he'd never he'd never heard of that vision and he it wasn't he it wasn't made known to him you know and it wasn't given until Paul was off the scene yet Paul for Paul the truths of the book had not yet been sealed I want to give something to you Paul had and preached from an open book he did not preach from a sealed up book it got closed because of the Antichrist spirit would close it off to us but it would be it would be the removing of those Antichrist doctored that would bring us back to what Paul preached not something different the same gospel so when some Paul did not need to add the seals open the book was already open you see for Paul the truths of the Bible are not sealed water baptism predestination security of the believers all the other truths even about the Anti Christ all in these truths then you know what would happen is to the agents that became obscure and that's mysterious and through the church Aegis they they become unclear to man and we didn't know and we had different Reclamation's that come along to reveal parts of it or make parts of it known they couldn't get the whole line brother Brandon have said my job is to tie up the loose ends to bring it into one message truths that they had here and revealed Darren whatever to bring it into one message so well the seals that do that that's not what he said he said the seals tied up the loose ends it brought it back into one message again it exposed the Antichrist spirit and how he had brought deception to the jurors so you see again again what we do how by God's grace we understand now the journey you see the the book of Revelation would show the journey that the church has been through it would show the seven ages seven messengers it would show I endtime prophecies and and how the Antichrist spirit come in with that with a with the the white horse rider and the red and the black and the pale it would do all of these so we by God's grace we can understand the journey of the church as we come down to the aegis and we received as the Bible said in Revelation 10 the voices of thunders that revealed the symbol of each seals but the seals did not open up new truths if it opened up the truths that the church what's happened so you see these were truths that were previously known it opened up the Bible forests and it brought us truths that had been lost to thee through the denomination ages we are not preaching today I want to emphasize it we are not preaching truths that Paul didn't preach denominations are the ones guilty of preaching what Paul didn't preach that preach the Trinity come on listen this is a one God Bible here lives with the Lord that God is one Lord and it's Regenesis - revelation of one God Bible he was God witness in the Old Testament God witness in Christ and now God witness in the Holy Ghost same God same one not three persons one God and baptism never was in titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost all through the book of Acts every place he ever baptized was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so you see you see they they preach a Trinity Paul didn't breach the Trinity they preach frequent instead of a Mersenne Paul didn't preach sprinklin they preach that even Apple Paul didn't preach that he said it's a serpent Batali's so I'm afraid you lose your virginity she did come on hey man Paul didn't preach that you see the opening of the seals over at the book and showed the truth of what denominations had made mysterious and these were these were were however revealed truths to the Apostle Paul we did not have another gospel than what Paul preached it is not a further word it is a continuation of the Apostles doctrine now I can I can hear some protests but Paul didn't know the symbols of the horse riders right Paul didn't need to know that the riders were demon powers that distorted the truth and closed the book and made it mysterious but these truths were known by Paul and we had returned back to his gospel Paul was already telling us about the rider that would come riding through the church to concrete he told us this was the a as I said this was a known truth to Paul he said listen these brothers were preachers Democrats is already here said he's a spirit of the Antichrist they called him what it was a spirit he said it's already working and it's already of the church he would go ahead and he would preach about the man of sin of spirit of seduction that would soon conquer the church and finally with the man of sin being worshipped in the church instead of the real Christ Paul preached this so these these were truce these were Tris Paul preached some brother branham in question answer 64 would say said some great theologian tried to corner me on that said brother branham dog will give you some day the secret of those seven seals and those seven seals will be something that we've never learned yet that'll be something that's not even the Bible he said no no it won't be that because if you do if I told you that I would be a false prophet because this were there everything that the whole revelation of Jesus Christ is all completed in this word and if the seven seals pertained to the seven churches it had to be already passed because we're in the Laodicean church the seven seals is only revealing what they had left off back there listen I only revealing what they had left off back there and it opened up what they left then he explained what Luther laughs what Wesley left all the Reformers and Pentecostals all down to this present time what am I trying to tell you this is not a new message this is a same message we from the beginning it's the same gospel man this is return back to the same gospel back to the beginning back to Pentecost again back to the purity of the book of Acts again he said he would even he repeats this several times tells his story he's a brother branham this theologian said that seven seals brother Branham be revealed the last day some great mystery how to get closer to God he said you see that's what the Mormons think they think they can they're closer to God because of their addition their sacred plates or tablets that Joseph Smith found and this brings him closer to God he said no sir he can't me whosoever shall take one word from this mic or add one form to it his part will be taken the book of life what it is is a revelation on what has been missed back there to bring it's already wrote here it's in here it's to reveal what has already been written because you can't add one thing to it or take one word from it and then he holds up his Bible and he and he Pat's the Bible he says this is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the seven seals had the mysteries here of what it was and is all supposed to open in the last day at the Laodicean age at the end of time hallelujah and that finishes a message to the church because it brings us back to the Bible again he would speak of this and he says it's the mystery seven seals would be open reveal all those mysteries that's been hid through the Reformers not hid from Apostle Paul hid from the Reformers and hit by them there again said you can't add he said you can add to the church to take from the church but don't you add to that word to take from it because God would take your name right off the book of life and that's your finish then you can't add to it or take from it finally in conclusion of this as we go on he tells us in Shreveport one of his last sermons he says now somebody said to me well now some day the Lord will probably use seeing visions brother Branham will reveal to you what these things are and we can all get closer to God and have more power than we get and speaking in tongues and things I said it can't be that way because I believe the word to be the truth and the Bible said who servants will add one word or take one word from it it has to be in this word it's the mystery that the people's overlooked and right there is word my message the Serpent's Eden to true believers security of the believer so now what is he emphasizing does we didn't get a new message we got the same message therefore it must have the same results and will when we eat the whole lamb you see it's not a new doctrine it's the original doctrine it's the original word back again oh this is this is really important that we understand that this is where we have been brought to in this hour of the death angel we must have the pure word again Amen not an addition now so he tells about you see because some of them they want this apartment they don't want that and yet they say we believe this word we believe this Bible and so tell us about a man was on a radio program down in Tucson said the Pentecostal religion is nothing but a sham don't listen to it it's unstable any man who spoke in tongues and these things claimed they were healed is sick and so forth my prayer it was to leave away from it and to pray for those poor decrepit people because they were in an illusion that there's something wrong with him he's at all how I don't like to talk to that brother for a little while and he said he said that was only given for the Apostles on the day of Pentecost and that's all it was now that same devil tells us we can't have all the land today everybody comes and says it was only given to the Prophet you know recently I was up in Arkansas with brother Ron Spencer there and they he testified about some of the visions that we know personally firsthand that took place some woman comes running up to him after church and says you you say you saw visions only brother Branham could do that now where do we get this so we got to strike that out of the Bible we've got to take that part of the Lamb that says all men sin during dreams and young men shall see visions we got to take parts of the lamb away today because it's we've got to change it for the times you see even recently another preacher after hearing the testimonies of healing the miracle working power God said we don't need another Superman you see they don't want the Spirit of God working in the church so with their gentle spirits they condemn it if it's not working through the ministry that has it on the one through the lanty and when god's always walked through the ministry he had downs them he sets them apart and gives a special gift for their ministry oh man and they're part of the body hey man we're not we want Peter and James and John to testify what God was doing and say we don't want to hear such testimonies of that I'd rather just hear a mother you know give a testimony than to hear the ministry you see jealous spirits don't want to supernatural but let me tell you this the supernatural makes supermen and if you get the super gospel if you get the supernatural you'll have Superman you'll have super weapon come oh yeah well we just would you know I'd rather hear I've read here just some some mother telling testimony that and then another Superman well let me just tell you let's tell a testimony let's tell the testimony of a man by the name of Philip and he had four dollar virgin daughters at prophesied a man wonder wonder if we would like to hear that there's virgin daughters or there's two daughters of God that prophesy what we like to hear that they're still healing the sick casting out Devils demonstrating the gospel would we want to hear that and what to do that there's got to be a super Church [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Devils are being Casa and the sick are healed the needs of the people are met mine case you don't like to hear all of that maybe I should just down the line and go through what a super Church is doing hallelujah right here in this super Church the supernatural God is working in a supernatural way man there's sister Lila City right over there and met one day with cancer all through her lungs and the next day none I'll go into his name because we were leaning on the everlasting arms it happened it's not an imagination it happened there's little pariah through it without a piece you they're totally for glory has people in a separates and then even ministers faces brother Branham said will bless when you when they're asked but do you believe the Word of God Word said these signs shall follow them that believe even ministers faces will bless are you saying to say Oh divine here are you saved to the fall gospel the full lamb are you saying that your Pentecostal experience that's being ashamed of this word that's his word made flesh in him hallelujah are you at me to a man all brother branham said in the indictment he said no wonder they can't be in miracles no wonder you can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they condemn it the reason they can dim it back there is the same reason they can dim it today they are guilty as guilty believe because only under the shed blood and those who are dare some little brother who dares walk under the under humility to take God in His Word and walked out there and confess his sin and forget all these dumpers and things and stand there under the blood and believe it they want to call him a fanatic they want to clasp him as we'd say it's not a good word in a pulpit to use but doing so you'll understand he's an oddball in other words we don't want a Superman you see this gospel don't make one man a Superman but it makes the churches super jerks a church that can testify hey ma'am you lured to go to church that can testify I'm sure you you've already heard of it where I stood there with a and preached about ARRA was there in Israel and spoke about a barren church and a bad trade for a barren women and men one was one of them that I prayed for was my daughter Bethany and she's coming right now into her third or fourth month of pregnancy again and carrying that baby with a strong heartbeat why because God is still working in the supernatural he's still God my wife right there's a testimony of a woman that with a brain bleed ain't that big as a saucer and God Richard mercy moved on the scene doctor would say look there you've been looking there I'd wear a vision had been taken away and was now restored and would say marvelous wonderful look back at the MRI and say girl you're a miracle what is that because of a supernatural church amen because we eating the whole lamb and in the lab that's healing there's reasons let's get to the spirit divine healing there's a seven seals have been revealed and the procedure may be a priest ball of desert the whole lamb is there now let's bring it down Father's Day this is Father's Day what if your brother branham uses this illustration what if your son you said this little boy here is my son and he says who me beat your son but what do you think I am what you think that would embarrass you is a father you say that about your boy this is my son me have not that old man son and he said that's today is what's wrong with so-called Christianity if you name the name of denominations okay they all accept the fatherhood a denomination but when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word of God Christ no they're embarrassed they don't want to say yes I have spoke with tongues yes I have seen visions yes I believe in divine healing yes I praise the Lord I'm free from all organization so I'm not bowing down vide of that I'm a servant of Christ oh my that just tear them to pieces hmm and he says but when you come in contact with God which is the word no words been made plain and manifested to him there's no sameness about it you're not embarrassed it don't embarrass me to say I believe every word of God it don't embarrass me when the Lord says to say anything you go you go say it and do it it don't embarrass me to say I've been filled with the Holy Ghost it don't embarrass me to say I've spoken with other tongues it don't embarrass me to say our Lord has showed me visions it don't embarrass me to say he's the same yesterday today and forever a man now so the whole line is this man was saying on this radio program that was only given for the Apostles at the day of Pentecost and that was all he said find thirty years later Paul was ordained and these gifts in the church in 1st Corinthians 15 and he sat in the church the gift of speaking in tongues and miracles and all these other gifts were said in the church jesus said go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature how far all the world who to every creature and they've never received it yet and these signs of all of them that believe how long all the world who to ever greets heard these signs and following all the world ever greets heard these signs of other than that believe in my name they shall cast out devils speak with new tongues they said taking up deadly things or serpent drinking a deadly thing it was not harmed they they lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover that was his last commission to his church mark 16 and Paul is ordained and these gifts in the church 30 years later and it glazes what age sent him an angel from heaven preach to you any other gospel than this which is already received already been preached let him be accursed I believe that Pentecost begin without ending I believe it is to ever creature all times at all places that the Pentecostal blessing should be among the people amen brother we're at the time a very serious hour the lamb must be served all of it Pentecostals went with just the joy of it hey that's all they got they have the joy the shoutings the jumping of course you have joined shout and jump they call you a Pentecostal well I'm as Pentecost as much as they're in the Bible but there's a lot more to it than this joy amen the joy of it is wonderful the sensations running down the aisles speaking another time all of those are good we you know they demonstrate the joy of it but we are here to manifest the whole life and even the joy of it oh man so don't criticize us for having the joy because that's in the land and don't criticize cuz some people get a little happy
