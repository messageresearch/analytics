[37:08] I'm a child of [music]
[37:11] God. Yes, I [singing]
[37:13] am.
[37:17] In [music] my father's [singing]
[37:20] house. Oh, there's a place.
[37:25] Oh, I'm a child. [music]
[37:30] Oh yes, I sing it now. Say in my
[37:35] father's in my [music and singing]
[37:37] father's
[37:39] house
[37:41] there's a place for [singing and music]
[37:44] me. Oh I'm a child of God. Oh yes I am.
[37:52] [music]
[37:53] [singing]
[37:55] Oh
[37:56] father's [music]
[37:58] house.
[38:00] There's a place [singing]
[38:02] just for me. Oh, I'm a child [music]
[38:06] of God.
[38:09] Yes, I think God I am chosen. Say I am
[38:14] [music and singing]
[38:15] chosen, not forsaken.
[38:19] I am who you say I am.
[38:23] You [music and singing] are for me, not
[38:27] against me.
[38:29] I [music] am who you say I [singing]
[38:32] am.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; I am chosen, [music]
[38:36] not forsaken. [singing]
[38:38] And I am who you say I am.
[38:43] You are for [music] me, not against me.
[38:48] I am [singing and music] who you say I
[38:51] am.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; [music]
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Who the sun [singing] sets free.
[39:00] You are free. [music]
[39:03] [singing]
[39:04] Oh, I'm a child.
[39:08] Oh yes, I am [music and singing]
[39:12] in my father's house. Take my heart.
[39:19] [music]
[39:25] [music]
[39:31] [singing]
[39:34] Hallelujah. [music]
[39:36] &gt;&gt; How many children of God here tonight?
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just thank the [music] Lord for
[39:40] that. Let's just go to him in prayer.
[39:42] Father, we come to you, Lord. Just
[39:46] asking [music] once again that you'd
[39:47] come and take control, Lord, and speak,
[39:50] move, that you would just touch us,
[39:53] Lord, by your grace and mercy [music]
[39:54] tonight, Lord. And God, you just wash
[39:57] over us with your presence. And Lord,
[40:00] that thanksgiving can come from our
[40:01] hearts and our lives, Lord. So thankful
[40:04] for all that you've done for [music] us,
[40:06] who we were and where we were headed,
[40:08] God, but Lord, you turned us around and
[40:11] you picked us up. We got so much to be
[40:14] thankful for. We just ask, Father, you
[40:16] just come and just minister to us in
[40:19] your word. We pray in Jesus name.
[40:20] [music]
[40:22] Amen.
[40:23] Amen. Let's turn to First Thessalonians
[40:25] 5 verse 16.
[40:40] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[40:42] the Lord.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Says, "Rejoice." I'm going to read
[40:46] the amplified version if that's okay.
[40:48] But rejoice always and delight in your
[40:51] faith.
[40:53] Be unceasing and persistent in prayer in
[40:58] every situation, no matter what the
[40:59] circumstances be. Be thankful and
[41:03] continually give thanks to God for this
[41:06] is the will of God for you in Christ
[41:09] Jesus. Amen. We let you be seated.
[41:15] I actually sometimes you put things in,
[41:18] you don't read it all yourself when you
[41:19] put it in there. And just struck me as
[41:22] it's written here. Rejoice always and
[41:24] delight in your faith. I I want to I
[41:27] want to speak on thankful faith.
[41:30] Thankful faith. You know, we just come
[41:31] through Thanksgiving and and it's a
[41:34] wonderful a wonderful holiday just to
[41:36] stop for a moment and and to think about
[41:38] and reminisce and to be thankful for all
[41:41] that God has given us in our life. And
[41:43] you know, but anymore, it's almost a
[41:45] overlooked day. Uh definitely an
[41:48] overlooked holiday. Commercially,
[41:50] people's minds have already been geared
[41:52] towards Christmas and toward the
[41:54] commercial aspects of that. And too many
[41:57] are no longer even taking the day to
[42:00] remember what all we have to be thankful
[42:02] for.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; You know, being thankful is is actually
[42:06] is an expression of gratitude. But too
[42:08] many have become unthankful and
[42:10] ungrateful for all the bountiful
[42:12] blessings God has even given this
[42:15] country or even you know never even stop
[42:18] for a moment to think about where all
[42:20] these blessings come from like brother
[42:22] Brandham referenced many times of a hog
[42:25] that's under an apple tree and you know
[42:27] he eats apples all day long and they'll
[42:29] fall even from the tree and beat him on
[42:31] the head and he'll never look up to see
[42:33] where they're coming from and he said
[42:34] that's just the way we are many times we
[42:37] absolutely absolutely will. God will
[42:38] pour his blessings upon us and then
[42:41] we'll never look up to say, "Thank you,
[42:43] Lord. I'm so glad to be here. I'm
[42:46] thankful you've given me something to
[42:47] eat." We just go ahead and just like he
[42:49] owed it to us, but actually he owes us
[42:52] nothing.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; We owe everything to him.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We owe all that we are to him. And
[42:58] so, you know, actually unthankful was a
[43:01] word that Paul would even use speaking
[43:03] to Timothy about the last days. He said
[43:05] there'd be, you know, perilous time
[43:07] shall come. And he would use that word
[43:09] unthankful. And I I believe we're
[43:11] actually living in that day, the last
[43:13] days. And and we see people that are
[43:15] very unthankful. They're unthankful for
[43:17] things that's very common. You know,
[43:19] that's really really reason times things
[43:22] that people get in that condition
[43:23] because things become very common. And
[43:26] sometimes when something becomes common,
[43:28] people stop noticing its value. You
[43:31] know, I I I I one time preached a
[43:33] message on on the on the whale that
[43:36] David had and because I actually, it's
[43:39] kind of a humorous story. I was in the
[43:41] early years of my ministry and
[43:43] struggling on a Wednesday to come up
[43:44] with something with a to preach, you
[43:46] know, and and brother Aaron at that time
[43:48] was in school. And so he actually called
[43:50] me and said, "What are you doing?" He
[43:51] was living there down the street at my
[43:53] dad's place while he was going to
[43:54] school. And and so he said, "What are
[43:57] you doing?" He said, "I want to take you
[43:58] for lunch. Let's go." I said, "Well, I'm
[43:59] studying. I don't have anything. I'm
[44:01] trying to come. I'm cramming, you know.
[44:02] And he said, "Well, sometimes and study,
[44:04] you know, it's just good to get away
[44:05] from it and come back and maybe
[44:07] something to open." And so, actually, at
[44:09] that time, we had a little restaurant
[44:10] there in Homer. It was a Chinese
[44:12] restaurant. And got through eating and
[44:14] opened up. And it says, "No, the little
[44:16] cookie, you know, it says, "No one knows
[44:17] the worth of water until the well is
[44:19] dry." And I would take that and to David
[44:22] how that he longed for a drink from
[44:24] Bethlehem. And no doubt many times he
[44:27] would go by that day after day. But it
[44:28] was that day that it was no longer
[44:30] available that it became something that
[44:32] was very important to him. And people,
[44:35] you know, do that in their own lives.
[44:37] Unfortunately, many times people are not
[44:39] as important to us until they're gone.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I mean, our daddies,
[44:45] our mamas are not sometimes so important
[44:47] to us until they're gone. And then we
[44:49] won't we would be so thankful to have an
[44:51] opportunity to sit down with them again
[44:53] to talk with them to speak to them you
[44:55] know because things become common you
[44:57] know and people stop noticing his value
[44:59] and they know comfort and stability
[45:02] actually can make blessings feel normal
[45:04] rather than sp special. Amen. So, and
[45:07] then other another reason people become
[45:10] unthankful is they begin to compare
[45:12] themselves to others and to other people
[45:14] who are more successful or are more
[45:17] wealthy and seemingly more happy and and
[45:19] you know this creates a sense of lack
[45:21] which overshadows what one really has
[45:24] and what one one really has to be
[45:26] grateful for. Amen. And you know
[45:28] actually I just read a in studying this
[45:30] I read many statements on thanksgiving
[45:32] and thankfulness and one of them was
[45:34] Amen. A grateful heart or a thankful
[45:36] heart actually makes what you have
[45:39] enough.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in this world you know
[45:43] it's it's geared towards you got to have
[45:45] more and you got to have more and you
[45:46] got to have more. There's never a place
[45:49] where you can come to having enough.
[45:51] Amen. And another one is entitlement. is
[45:53] entitlement where believing one deserves
[45:56] certain benefits or a certain treatment
[45:58] or expecting others to meet their needs
[46:00] automatically reduces the appreciation
[46:03] when the need is met. Stress can also
[46:06] overwhelm you and over being overwhelmed
[46:08] with exhaustion or being anxious or
[46:11] overloaded. Gratitude becomes harder to
[46:14] access and problems begin to feel larger
[46:17] and a and and and then the positives
[46:20] that you have in your life and you know
[46:22] even negative past experiences that come
[46:25] from trauma or betrayal or you know
[46:28] hardships make people more guarded and
[46:31] they struggle to trust good things or
[46:34] trust good friendships or trust good
[46:37] people. Amen. And we live in a world
[46:39] it's hard to trust anybody anymore. You
[46:41] know, you should didn't think about
[46:43] anything about stopping and fixing a
[46:45] flat for somebody or stopping. Now, the
[46:46] first thing that goes to your mind when
[46:48] you see somebody with a flat that it's a
[46:50] setup that they're trying to rob you or
[46:52] something you why it's the world that we
[46:54] live in become people have become amen
[46:57] so guarded because of negative things
[46:59] and negative issues and and negative
[47:01] problems and negative situations and in
[47:04] turn become more unthankful for what
[47:06] they have.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it actually starts a lack of
[47:10] reflection. and it's a moving path too
[47:13] fast that that to just pause and
[47:15] appreciate what you have that's going
[47:18] well.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, uh and then of course,
[47:22] you know, there's a a strain some people
[47:25] have that's really haunts them is
[47:26] perfectionism where you're focusing on
[47:29] what's not good enough instead of what
[47:31] is good enough. And and you have such
[47:33] high expectations that it makes
[47:35] gratitude or thankfulness difficult.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's never good enough.
[47:40] You know, it seems that way in in a
[47:43] church, you know, in church settings
[47:45] especially, the the temperature is never
[47:47] good enough. The sound's never good
[47:48] enough. Nothing's never good enough for
[47:50] some people. And and it shouldn't be
[47:52] that way. We ought to be thankful for
[47:54] what we have.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know. Maybe maybe you just
[47:57] don't travel enough. You go to enough
[47:58] churches, you'll realize we are we got a
[48:00] lot to be thankful for.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got a lot to be grateful for
[48:05] that. Amen. There's churches that don't
[48:07] even have AC. They don't even have
[48:08] heating. They don't even have padded
[48:10] pews to sit on. Listen, we got a lot to
[48:13] be thankful for. I I want to bring it
[48:15] back to our forefront that there is
[48:17] something that you have to be thankful
[48:19] for.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so and then you know if you
[48:23] surround yourself with influences that
[48:26] are are negative and constantly
[48:28] complaining and ungrateful it'll shape
[48:31] your mindset and and begin to make it to
[48:33] where you're less grateful and le more
[48:36] complaining and and and it begins to
[48:38] shape a lot of things. So there's a lot
[48:40] of reasons but I I don't really want to
[48:42] focus on all the ungratefulness. I want
[48:44] to focus on being grateful.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; I want to speak again on thankful faith.
[48:49] You know, it's a mindset where gratitude
[48:51] and trust work together. And it's the
[48:54] kind of faith that recognizes blessings
[48:57] even in ordinary or difficult moments.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT TRUSTS THAT GOOD can come when
[49:04] the outcome is not clear.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. IT RESPONDS WITH GRATITUDE.
[49:10] THIS tra this fa this THANKFUL FAITH. IT
[49:13] RESPONDS WITH GRATITUDE rather than
[49:15] responding with fear or worry. Thankful
[49:18] faith sees the gift of the moment. It
[49:21] sees there's a purpose in every moment.
[49:23] Amen. IT SEES A HOPE BEYOND WHAT IS THE
[49:26] NATURAL eyes can even see. Amen.
[49:29] Philippians 4 and verse four says,
[49:31] "Rejoice in the Lord always with delight
[49:34] or take pleasure in him." Again, I say
[49:36] rejoice. Let your gentle spirit, your
[49:39] graciousness, your unselfishness, your
[49:42] mercy, your tolerance, your patience be
[49:44] known to all people. The Lord is near.
[49:46] DO NOT BE anxious or worried about
[49:48] anything, but in everything. Somebody
[49:50] say everything. By prayer and petition
[49:54] with thanksgiving.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Prayer and petition with
[49:59] thanksgiving. Continue to make your
[50:01] specific request known to God. So
[50:04] thanksgiving is not just after the
[50:06] request.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving is part of the request.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Did you get that? It's not just after
[50:15] the request. and and the request is
[50:17] fulfilled and and you say, "Thank you,
[50:19] Lord. I thank you for giving me that. I
[50:20] I thank you for giving me that
[50:22] promotion. I thank you for giving me
[50:23] this money. I THANK NO, IT'S THANKING
[50:25] HIM BEFORE YOU EVER receive a dime."
[50:28] &gt;&gt; IT'S THANKING HIM BEFORE YOU EVER SEE
[50:31] THE OUTCOME. IT'S THANKING HIM WHILE
[50:33] YOU'RE PRAYING. SAY, "I WANT TO THANK
[50:35] YOU, LORD, THAT YOU'RE FAITHFUL. I WANT
[50:37] TO THANK YOU, LORD, THAT YOU SEE my need
[50:39] and you see me where I AM AND YOU KNOW
[50:41] WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH. I WANT TO THANK
[50:43] YOU FOR BEING THAT kind of God." Amen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; And in turn, gratitude or thankfulness,
[50:49] it actually opens the door of peace.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Because it continues there. And the
[50:56] peace of God. Amen. The peace that
[50:59] reassures the heart. That peace which
[51:02] transcends all understanding. So in
[51:04] other words, when you can't understand,
[51:06] you can still have peace.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; When you don't understand, you can still
[51:11] have peace. That peace which transcends
[51:14] all understanding stands guard over your
[51:17] heart and your mind in Christ Jesus.
[51:19] Amen. Colossians 2:6 says, "And ye
[51:21] therefore receive Christ Jesus the Lord.
[51:24] So walk ye in him rooted, builded up,
[51:28] established in the faith as you have
[51:30] been taught, abounding therein with
[51:33] thanksgiving." So notice faith and
[51:35] thanksgiving is tied right directly
[51:37] together at the hill.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Overflow. In other words,
[51:41] abounding is overflowing with
[51:43] thanksgiving. So faith and thanksgiving
[51:45] are inseparable. True faith produces
[51:49] gratitude and gratitude strengthens
[51:51] faith.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And gratitude strengthens faith.
[51:56] It is not a gratitude or thanksgiving
[51:59] after a blessing or an ANSWERED PRAYER.
[52:01] IT'S THANKFUL WHILE praying and waiting.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S THANKFUL BEFORE THERE'S A SIGN OF A
[52:08] BLESSING. That's right.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; And then it's, you know, it's not only
[52:12] rooted AND IT'S NOT ONLY BUILT UP AND
[52:14] YOU'RE NOT ONLY ESTABLISHED BUT ALSO
[52:16] ABOUNDING OR OVERFLOWING WITH
[52:18] THANKSGIVING. SO THANKSGIVING IS A TRAIT
[52:21] OR A SIGN OF A mature believer.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Negativity is a sign of a shallow
[52:30] believer.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; All they can find is something to be
[52:34] negative at. You're a shallow believer.
[52:36] Go on and get rooted a little deeper.
[52:38] Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thanksgiving is a sign of a mature
[52:41] believer. The more rooted and built up,
[52:44] the more established
[52:46] &gt;&gt; and the more established, the more
[52:47] thankful.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have myself a lovely time
[52:54] studying all this. The more ability YOU
[52:56] HAVE TO THE MORE ABILITY YOU HAVE TO
[52:59] TURN YOUR EYES FROM YOUR DISAPPOINTMENTS
[53:01] AND THE PROBLEMS, THE MORE ABILITY YOU
[53:03] WILL HAVE TO TURN YOUR EYES TOWARD
[53:05] THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE REGARDLESS OF
[53:08] THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; You know, Colossians 3:15, it says, "Let
[53:14] the peace of God rule in your hearts to
[53:17] the which you are called in one body,
[53:20] and be ye thankful."
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Period. Right.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; I didn't I didn't I didn't see no uh
[53:28] small print past thankful, you know,
[53:30] thankful if everything's going good and
[53:32] thankful if there's money in the bank
[53:34] and thankful if you got a lot of friends
[53:35] and thankful if everybody loves you and
[53:37] you're getting patted on the back and
[53:38] nobody's No, it says, "And be you
[53:40] thankful."
[53:42] &gt;&gt; So you come to church, be you thankful.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; I got a church to come to.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I got believers to be with. I GOT A GOOD
[53:52] PASTOR. I GOT I GOT GOOD MINISTRY. I I
[53:54] GOT GOOD SINGERS. I GOT GOOD MUSICIANS.
[53:56] I I GOT A LOT TO BE THANKFUL FOR. I I
[53:59] GOT PEOPLE SITTING BESIDE ME THAT'S
[54:01] HELPING ME CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE
[54:03] THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND MIRACLES CAN TAKE
[54:05] PLACE.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Another saying I read was a a
[54:11] thankful heart is a magnet for miracles.
[54:18] [clears throat]
[54:18] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[54:20] So it's not be you thankful if all's
[54:22] going good and the bills are paid and
[54:24] everyone loves you and nobody said a bad
[54:26] word to you and you know everything's
[54:28] great on Facebook and all this is
[54:30] happening. You know this is not a
[54:32] suggestion.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; That is a command.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Be ye thankful.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; It's a command and everything give
[54:39] thanks. WE WE DON'T GIVE THANKS FOR EVIL
[54:41] but we do give thanks in the midst of
[54:43] evil.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE FAITH LOOKS AND SAYS ALL
[54:47] THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR MY GOOD. A
[54:49] THANKFUL FAITH SAYS, "NO CIRCUMSTANCE IS
[54:52] EXEMPT FROM MY GOD'S ABILITY TO USE IT
[54:55] FOR MY GOOD."
[54:58] &gt;&gt; SO EVEN WHEN BLESSING SEEMS ABSENCE AND
[55:01] EVERYTHING'S AGAINST US, FAITH REMAINS
[55:04] THANKFUL.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? This is what we read in Habacook
[55:09] 3 and verse 17. If you can turn there.
[55:11] Although the fig tree shall not blossom,
[55:14] neither shall fruit be in the vines and
[55:17] the labor of the olive shall fail, and
[55:19] the field shall yield no meat, and the
[55:22] flock shall be cut off from the fold,
[55:24] and there shall be no herd in THE
[55:26] STALLS. YET I WILL REJOICE in the Lord,
[55:30] &gt;&gt; and I will enjoy IN THE GOD OF MY
[55:32] SALVATION. THE LORD GOD IS MY STRENGTH
[55:35] AND HE WILL MAKE my feet like hind's
[55:37] feet and he WILL MAKE ME TO WALK UPON my
[55:40] high places. Hallelujah.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, MY GOD'S GOING TO EXALT
[55:44] ME.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; CUZ NONE OF THIS ON THIS EARTH HAS
[55:48] ANYTHING. IT'S ALL TEMPORARY.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY ETERNAL
[55:52] VALUE AND WHO I AM ETERNAL. IT'S ONLY A
[55:55] TEMPORARY DWELLING PLACE. IT'S ONLY A
[55:57] TEMPORARY TIME. IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY
[56:00] TROUBLE. COME ON. IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY
[56:02] SICKNESS. IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY PROBLEM
[56:05] THAT you're going through.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT HAS NO BEARING ON WHAT'S ON THE
[56:10] INSIDE OF YOU. THAT ETERNAL JES
[56:14] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; So no matter if there's money, let me
[56:21] just read it in our language. All right.
[56:23] If there's money in the bank and my
[56:25] job's going good and nobody's about to
[56:27] fire me and everything's perfect and
[56:33] You know, we get so unthankful
[56:35] sometimes. God gives us a job and we
[56:36] find out all the faults he's got.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Okay, I get on something there.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; You know,
[56:47] listen, what's the first thing you do
[56:50] when you buy a car? Okay, I'll just
[56:51] speak about me. First thing you do when
[56:53] you buy a car, you get buyer's remorse,
[56:57] right? Why did I do this? And then that
[57:00] turns into, man, do you hear that noise?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? I hear all kind of
[57:06] problems going on.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Listen to that. Do you hear that? And
[57:10] you get a mechanic in there. He can't
[57:11] hear nothing.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Car don't ever make that noise when I
[57:15] get a mechanic in here, I tell you. And
[57:16] you get in back and it starts making up
[57:19] and what is it? And all this negativity
[57:21] starts building up.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. And it turns from being
[57:24] thankful that God gave me a job to where
[57:26] I could able to buy a car that I can be
[57:29] able to have a car to go get my
[57:30] groceries that I can have groceries so I
[57:32] can eat and I can have I can eat so I
[57:34] can have strength and I have strength.
[57:36] INSTEAD OF BEING THANKFUL we it turns
[57:38] into regret
[57:40] &gt;&gt; and there MEANWHILE PEOPLE WHO WOULD
[57:41] DREAM OF OWNING THE WORST CAR IN THE
[57:43] PARKING LOT.
[57:48] AMEN.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE THEIR DREAM [screaming] TO
[57:50] HAVE THE WORST CAR SITTING OUT THERE IN
[57:52] THAT PARKING LOT.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; I know. I I was a 17 year old boy went
[57:57] to Africa for the first time and drove
[57:59] in this car and it was the only car that
[58:00] would show up at a churchyard church in
[58:02] a churchyard full of 500 people in the
[58:04] church and this man as 30ome years old
[58:07] had finally been able to buy his first
[58:08] car. And it wasn't a nice car.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; It was a it was a great car for him and
[58:13] and this area, I'm sure, but it was not
[58:15] what we look at AS A NICE CAR.
[58:20] RIGHT?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; We become so unthankful
[58:27] &gt;&gt; and God gives us the abilities and God
[58:29] gives us things and he gives us all the
[58:32] things that we have around us and it
[58:34] becomes so common and all I go I I wish
[58:36] I had that car and I wished I had that
[58:38] house and I and it's a constant rat race
[58:42] &gt;&gt; instead of just being thankful for what
[58:44] God did give you.
[58:47] Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Listen, let let me just bring it on
[58:53] down. There's a lot of people that would
[58:55] dream of having your seat.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD LOVE TO. THEY'D LOVE TO BE
[59:02] SITTING RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AND WE GET
[59:04] TO SIT THERE ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
[59:08] &gt;&gt; We get to come ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
[59:10] THIS AIN'T SOMETHING TO BE A DRUDGERY.
[59:12] THIS IS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR. I
[59:14] HAVE THE ABILITY. I HAVE THE RIGHT AS AN
[59:16] AMERICAN TO COME ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT
[59:18] AND GIVE THANKS TO MY GOD FOR WHAT HE'S
[59:21] DONE FOR ME. [applause]
[59:24] &gt;&gt; I don't have to hide. I DON'T HAVE TO BE
[59:26] I DON'T HAVE TO RUN AWAY. I AIN'T GOT TO
[59:28] WORRY ABOUT SOMEBODY STEPPING IN. I GOT
[59:30] ALL THE RIGHT IN THE WORLD TO
[59:32] [screaming] LIFT MY HANDS AND PRAISE MY
[59:34] GOD.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; There's a lot to be thankful for.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what we should do when
[59:42] we come in in Psalm 69 and verse 30
[59:45] says, "I will praise I will praise the
[59:48] name of the Lord with a SONG AND WILL
[59:50] MAGNIFY HIM WITH THANKSGIVING."
[59:54] &gt;&gt; INDEED.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; SO THANKSGIVING MAGNIFIES GOD'S
[59:57] GREATNESS. NOW, CAN YOU JUST for a
[59:59] minute take that WORD AT FACE VALUE? IT
[1:00:01] MAGNIFIES, IN OTHER WORDS, IT MAKES HIM
[1:00:03] GREATER. [screaming]
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And in MAKING HIM GREATER IN TURN, IT
[1:00:08] MINIMIZES YOUR PROBLEMS. AMEN.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; IT MINIMIZES YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. WHEN
[1:00:14] YOU BEGIN TO THANK GOD, IT MAKES GOD
[1:00:16] GREATER THAN YOUR PROBLEMS AND YOUR
[1:00:18] PROBLEMS GET SMARTER AND YOUR GOD GETS
[1:00:21] BIGGER.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Psalms 100 verse1 says, "Make a
[1:00:29] joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye land,
[1:00:31] serve the Lord with gladness. Come
[1:00:34] before his presence with singing. Know
[1:00:36] ye that the Lord, he is God. It is he
[1:00:38] that has made us and not we ourselves.
[1:00:41] We are his people and the sheep of his
[1:00:43] pasture. My God, there's so much to be
[1:00:45] thankful for right there.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T PUT MYSELF HERE. GOD PUT ME
[1:00:50] HERE. I DIDN'T CALL MYSELF. GOD CALLED
[1:00:53] ME.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT HERE ON YOUR OWN WILL. YOU'RE
[1:00:56] HERE BECAUSE OF GOD'S WILL TO PUT YOU
[1:00:58] HERE. AND THE DEVIL HAD A WILL, BUT GOD
[1:01:01] HAD A GREATER WILL. AMEN.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; So we enter into his gates with
[1:01:08] thanksgiving and into his courts with
[1:01:11] praise.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Be thankful unto him and bless his name.
[1:01:14] For the Lord is good. His mercy is
[1:01:17] everlasting and his truth endureth to
[1:01:19] all generations.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; So thanksgiving actually opens the door
[1:01:24] into his presence.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Did we not just read that? Entering his
[1:01:30] gates with thanksgiving. Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; It literally lifts you out of your
[1:01:34] problems and into his presence.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; So, no wonder the devil wants us to be
[1:01:40] unthankful
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; cuz all we can see is our problems and
[1:01:44] all we can see is the issues and all we
[1:01:46] can see is this and can't get nothing
[1:01:47] out of church and we we won't sing
[1:01:49] because it ain't this.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving opens the door into his
[1:01:58] presence. David does not say enter in
[1:02:01] with perfection.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; He don't say enter in with rituals. He
[1:02:06] don't say enter in with grace. He says
[1:02:08] enter into his courts with thanksgiving.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving is the key THAT OPENS THE
[1:02:13] GATE. THANKSGIVING IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
[1:02:16] GOD IS THE GIVER OF EVERY GOOD THING. IT
[1:02:19] SHIFTS YOUR FOCUS FROM YOUR LACK TO YOUR
[1:02:22] GOD IS FAITHFUL. AMEN.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; A THANKFUL HEART DECLARES CONFIDENCE IN
[1:02:27] YOUR GOD BEFORE YOU EVER SEE THE FIRST
[1:02:29] RESULT.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving is not a feeling.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; It's a choice.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; It's a choice.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; If it was a feeling, we wouldn't none of
[1:02:44] us ever hardly give thanks,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Right. Because you don't always feel
[1:02:49] thankful.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Your body don't feel thankful.
[1:02:54] Right. Right. Brother Andy went over and
[1:02:58] helped Brother Andy lay a floor
[1:02:59] yesterday. My body ain't feeling
[1:03:00] thankful right now, but I'm thankful
[1:03:02] it's done.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Thankful you can enjoy it.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; But my body ain't feeling thankful.
[1:03:08] It's hurting. Sore, right?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Don't look at me like you ain't never
[1:03:14] been there.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. We But we don't always
[1:03:21] feel that way. So we don't come in here
[1:03:23] feeling thankful sometimes.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; But a thankful heart or a thankful faith
[1:03:30] declares confidence in your God before
[1:03:33] you ever feel anything.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; It it's you know thanksgiving comes from
[1:03:37] the Hebrew word to toadah. Can anybody
[1:03:41] say that? Toadah.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Toadah.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; That means you're thankful. Toad. That's
[1:03:47] a good word to learn. Toad. It's a
[1:03:49] confession. It's a praise. It's a
[1:03:51] thanksgiving. It's giving praise to God.
[1:03:53] It's thanksgiving. This is the meanings
[1:03:54] of it all. In songs of worship or hymns
[1:03:57] of praise. It's thanksgiving in a choir
[1:03:59] or a possession or a line or a company.
[1:04:01] It's thanks offering or sac sacrifice of
[1:04:03] thanksgiving. It's a confession. And the
[1:04:05] word is actually drawn as a hand.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; It's interesting. IT'S DRAWN AS A HAND.
[1:04:11] IT'S AN ACTION and lifting of hands.
[1:04:14] It's a noun meaning PRAISE OR
[1:04:16] THANKSGIVING. THE WORD DESCRIBES AN
[1:04:18] OFFERING OF THANKS OR A SACRIFICE OF
[1:04:20] THANKSGIVING. THE WORD DEPICTS WORSHIP
[1:04:23] BY THE PRES PRESENTATION OF SONGS OF
[1:04:25] THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE that extol or
[1:04:28] lift up the mighty WONDERS OF THE LORD.
[1:04:30] IT REFERS TO SHOUTS OF JUBILATION AND
[1:04:33] THANKSGIVING.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SACRIFICE OF THANKSGIVING. BEING
[1:04:38] THANKFUL EVEN WHEN THE FEELINGS are not
[1:04:41] there. That's right.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; It means you enter in EVEN WHEN YOU
[1:04:46] DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU AIN'T HAD THE BEST WEEK.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; SO THIS IF you ain't had the best week,
[1:04:53] this is the best time to praise him.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You enter in EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL
[1:05:02] BURDENED DOWN.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; You enter in EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:05:06] ALL THE ANSWERS. RIGHT.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And you enter in thankful
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; by thanksgiving
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; in spite of all the devil has done to
[1:05:15] beat you down and to keep you bound and
[1:05:18] maybe try to keep you from being here
[1:05:19] tonight. I'm still going to praise him.
[1:05:22] I'm still going to thank him for all
[1:05:23] he's done. I'm still going to magnify
[1:05:25] his name. I'm still going to glorify
[1:05:27] him. I'M STILL GOING TO WORSHIP HIM. I I
[1:05:29] DON'T CARE WHAT THE DEVIL HAS TO SAY
[1:05:31] ABOUT IT. I'M GOING TO PRAISE GOD
[1:05:33] ANYHOW. AMEN.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT MY BODY HAS TO SAY
[1:05:37] ABOUT IT. I'M GOING TO PRAISE GOD
[1:05:39] ANYHOW,
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram talks about a
[1:05:43] sacrifice. He says, "What is a spiritual
[1:05:45] sacrifice?" That's what sons and
[1:05:47] daughters do, which are kings and
[1:05:49] priests, yet not in full possession, but
[1:05:51] they're making sacrifices, offering to
[1:05:53] God spiritual sacrifice. The fruit of
[1:05:55] your lips to praise him. The fruits of
[1:05:57] our lips. You say, "Well, brother
[1:05:58] Brandham, I don't feel like praising
[1:06:01] him." That's the time to make the
[1:06:03] sacrifice.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Praise him. Anyhow,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; you understand what is happening. And if
[1:06:10] you could really see what's happening in
[1:06:11] the other world, the devil's trying to
[1:06:13] keep you from that
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; cuz he knows if you can ever get that
[1:06:17] hand that to die up.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all just need to tell the
[1:06:22] devil to die anyhow.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; I'm done with you.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; You've been on my tail all weekend, all
[1:06:28] week, and you've been beating me down.
[1:06:30] You've been putting REGRETS AND YOU'VE
[1:06:31] BEEN PUTTING fear on ME AND ANXIETY TOO.
[1:06:34] I'M GOING TO PRAISE GOD ANYHOW. I'M
[1:06:37] GOING TO WORSHIP GOD ANYHOW. I'M GOING
[1:06:39] TO ENTER IN INTO THANKSGIVING. I'M GOING
[1:06:42] TO ENTER I'M GOING TO LEAVE MY PROBLEMS
[1:06:44] AND I'M GOING TO ENTER INTO HIS
[1:06:45] PRESENCE. I'M GOING TO LEAVE MY
[1:06:47] CIRCUMSTANCES AND I'M GOING TO ENTER
[1:06:48] INTO THE PRESENCE OF ANGELS.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; I DON'T FEEL LIKE PRAISING. THAT IS THE
[1:06:56] TIME.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Praise him anyhow.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; When a little confusion comes in the
[1:07:07] church, said don't run over to one side
[1:07:09] and pout.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; If you do, he says, "You're sure not a
[1:07:14] priest."
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; You pray through
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; spiritual sacrifice and fruits of your
[1:07:20] lips giving praise to his name. See what
[1:07:22] I mean? Well, you say, "Well, I I don't
[1:07:24] feel like going to church." But you're a
[1:07:26] priest.
[1:07:27] It's your duty. You got to be there.
[1:07:29] Well, I don't feel like taking part in
[1:07:31] the service. You're a priest. MAKE YOUR
[1:07:33] DUTY. MAKE A SACRIFICE.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; MAKE A SACRIFICE.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; PUT THAT OLD TIRED BODY ON AN ALTAR.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; PUT THOSE OLD HURT FEELINGS ON AN ALTAR.
[1:07:44] SAY, "IT AIN'T ABOUT MY FEELINGS ANYHOW.
[1:07:47] IT'S ABOUT MY GOD.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T ABOUT WHAT I LIKE ANYHOW. IT'S
[1:07:53] ABOUT WHAT PLEASES HIM. AMEN.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; People get so tore up about what they
[1:07:59] Well, I don't like this and I don't like
[1:08:00] that. Quit worrying about what YOU
[1:08:02] DON'T. IT AIN'T ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T
[1:08:03] LIKE OR you like.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T ABOUT WHAT I LIKE OR DON'T
[1:08:06] LIKE.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; We We all brother brother I think
[1:08:13] brother Daniel Williams always used they
[1:08:15] said everybody's got opinions like
[1:08:16] noses. Everybody got one.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; We all got them. We all got preferences.
[1:08:21] Every one of us do.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; We got favorite instruments. We got
[1:08:24] favorite preachers. We got favorite song
[1:08:26] leaders. We got favorite deacons. We got
[1:08:28] Yeah. favorite deacons. We do.
[1:08:31] Which means we have some with ain't so
[1:08:33] favorite. Right. You got the favorite.
[1:08:35] You got some not so favorite. I'm just
[1:08:37] saying anyway.
[1:08:40] Right. You got favorite people that you
[1:08:43] like to hang around. You like So you got
[1:08:45] all these. We all got preferences.
[1:08:46] Everyone we're human.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; But let's don't make our preferences
[1:08:50] something as spiritual.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; It's not spiritual. JUST LEAVE THEM AS
[1:08:55] PREFERENCES.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LET YOUR PREFERENCES OVERRIDE
[1:08:58] WHAT'S SPIRITUAL.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, DON'T LET WHAT YOUR
[1:09:03] PREFERENCES ARE WHEN YOU COME INTO
[1:09:04] CHURCH SERVICE. WELL, THEY AIN'T GOT MY
[1:09:06] FAVORITE MUSICIANS UP THERE. THEY AIN'T
[1:09:08] GOT LISTEN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT NONE OF
[1:09:10] THAT. LIFT UP YOUR HANDS ANYWAY. TO DIE.
[1:09:12] [screaming]
[1:09:13] I'M GOING TO PRAISE GOD.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Going to worship him no matter what.
[1:09:21] [crying]
[1:09:22] He said, "Notice it was for everyone
[1:09:24] that was a priest in the Old Testament.
[1:09:28] Everyone in the New Testament that
[1:09:29] becomes a Christian, born again, becomes
[1:09:31] a priest of God."
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; So that tells me a real key right there.
[1:09:37] If you can't offer a sacrifice of
[1:09:39] praise, that tells me you're not born
[1:09:40] again.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Just simple.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; So if you're not born again, let's get
[1:09:47] that fixed first. Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Then if you get born again, I bet you a
[1:09:52] lot of your preferences won't be nowhere
[1:09:54] near as important.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz before you born again, some of you
[1:09:58] had a preference. What beer you drank,
[1:10:00] what cigarettes you smoked, right?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going deep deep off here, but all
[1:10:05] this stuff that you used to do, but all
[1:10:06] of a sudden when you got born again,
[1:10:07] none of that mattered anymore,
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Well, same thing happens with your
[1:10:13] personal preferences and things that
[1:10:14] ain't considered a sin. WHEN YOU GET
[1:10:16] BORN AGAIN, YOU REALIZE NONE OF THAT
[1:10:17] STUFF MATTERS NO MORE.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; We give God the sacrifice of our lips,
[1:10:25] giving praise to his name, saying,
[1:10:26] "Well," you say, "I don't feel like it."
[1:10:28] Well, do it anyhow. That's a sacrifice.
[1:10:30] I'm too tired. The devil will tell you
[1:10:33] that till you go to hell.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Direct quote,
[1:10:41] right? I won't appeal to the prophet on
[1:10:43] that one cuz nobody throwing no wigs at
[1:10:45] me.
[1:10:47] Power decision. He says it. I feel too
[1:10:50] tired. The devil will tell you that till
[1:10:51] he takes you to hell.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; You're to make a spiritual sacrifice.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; But we have Look, we have so many
[1:10:59] reasons to be thankful.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; There's nearly probably 100 whatever 150
[1:11:06] people in here. Every one of them is a
[1:11:08] reason to be thankful.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Right. every one of them. We in spite of
[1:11:13] what's going on around you, what you
[1:11:14] went through this week, you got a lot of
[1:11:16] reasons to be thankful.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; First off, we have salvation through
[1:11:20] Jesus Christ.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; We were rescued from sin.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; WE WERE RESCUED FROM ETERNAL SEPARATION
[1:11:28] AND BROUGHT NIGH UNTO HIM.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; We have forgiveness of sins.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you some things you can be
[1:11:38] thankful for, right? Maybe you ain't
[1:11:39] know. You don't know what you, but I'm
[1:11:41] TELLING YOU SO. YOUR RECORD IS clear

[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; I I tell you, I when you when when you
[1:13:39] have children, you realize how how
[1:13:42] thankful you are to have a healthy
[1:13:44] child.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; When you see other parents that going
[1:13:47] through struggles and things with their
[1:13:49] children because of sicknesses and stuff
[1:13:51] and the grab bag of life,
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; got a lot to be thankful for.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Have work income.
[1:14:01] There's a lot of people that would beg
[1:14:03] to have your job.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Puts a little different perspective on

[1:14:15] everywhere you go. You have angelic
[1:14:17] protection. YOU HAVE GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY.

[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You're you have creation's beauty.
[1:15:10] You have the mountains, the oceans, the
[1:15:12] stars.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody has preferences. Some people
[1:15:15] like the mountains. Some people like the
[1:15:16] oceans.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; But God made it so all of us could enjoy
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; laughter and joy in relationships.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:26] We have music,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; worship, and praise.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And I might be biased, but I'm going to
[1:15:33] say it. We have some of the best music
[1:15:34] in this world.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Biased or not.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; We do.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for them.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for the gift that a s make
[1:15:48] a sacrifice. They ain't paid to do what
[1:15:50] they do.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; These men up there sit up there. the
[1:15:53] ladies, they ain't paid to be up there,
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; And I don't see a line behind them
[1:15:58] wanting to sign up.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; So, let's be thankful for them.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Instead of finding every opportunity to
[1:16:04] be aggravated at them. Come on,
[1:16:06] somebody.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Sister pastor coming out. I'm sorry.
[1:16:12] WE HAVE REST. WE HAVE SLEEP.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE GOD'S PROVISION IN SMALL THINGS.
[1:16:18] WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE.
[1:16:22] RIGHT.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, the scripture says it's better
[1:16:24] to give than to receive.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; There's a wonderful truth there if YOU
[1:16:29] REALIZE. IT'S BETTER TO BE IN THE
[1:16:30] POSITION TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THAN HAVE TO
[1:16:32] BE IN the position to have TO RECEIVE.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S BETTER TO BE IN THE POSITION TO
[1:16:37] BE ABLE TO SERVE SOMEBODY THAN TO HAVE
[1:16:39] TO BE WHERE you have to be served.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Trials that strengthen your faith. Said
[1:16:47] we to have they're to be joyful things.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. Awesome.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I don't know about that.
[1:16:53] That's what the scripture says.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; The promise that God works all things
[1:16:58] for our good, the blessed hope. And this
[1:17:01] blessed hope, our Lord, our Savior, our
[1:17:04] God, our Jesus is coming again.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 107 and verse 20 says, "He
[1:17:13] sent his word and he healed them and
[1:17:16] delivered them from their destructions."
[1:17:17] Oh, that men would praise the Lord for
[1:17:19] his goodness and for his wonderful works
[1:17:22] to the children of men. AND LET THEM
[1:17:24] SACRIFICE THE SACRIFICES of thanksgiving
[1:17:27] AND DECLARE HIS WORKS WITH REJOICING.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; SO, I have a direct responsibility by
[1:17:38] scripture to give testimony of what
[1:17:39] God's done.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; He said he sent his word and he healed
[1:17:43] them. So if I know somebody's been
[1:17:44] healed by the word of God, I have the
[1:17:46] direct responsibility to go out and to
[1:17:49] declare his works with rejoicing.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; So don't get mad at me. I ain't tell I
[1:17:54] ain't pumping up myself. Ain't no real
[1:17:56] preacher, no man of God pumping up.
[1:17:57] BROTHER BRANDON DIDN'T pump up himself.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; HE WAS TELLING THE ACTS OF GOD.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THE DEVIL WANTS TO PUT CLAMPS
[1:18:07] ON OUR MOUTH. DON'T YOU DARE tell that
[1:18:08] somebody think you're trying to MAKE
[1:18:10] YOURSELF SOMEBODY. I'M NOT TRYING TO
[1:18:12] MAKE MYSELF ANYBODY. I'M MAKING GOD WHO
[1:18:15] HE IS. I'M MAKING JESUS WHO HE IS.
[1:18:18] SOMEBODY THAT'S WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE,
[1:18:20] ALL GLORY, ALL HONOR. [cheering]
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Psalms 116 and verse 16. Oh Lord, truly
[1:18:30] I am thy servant. I am thy servant and
[1:18:34] the son of thy handsmade. Thou hast
[1:18:36] loosed my bonds. Has any bond anybody
[1:18:39] had that where the Lord loosed your
[1:18:40] bonds?
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; All right. Therefore, I will offer to
[1:18:44] thee the sacrifice OF THANKSGIVING AND
[1:18:46] WILL CALL UPON the name of the Lord.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; That's what happened in Jonah. Jonah was
[1:18:52] found himself in the belly of a fish. We
[1:18:54] can read it in Jonah chapter 2 and verse
[1:18:56] one. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his
[1:18:58] God out of the fish's belly and said, I
[1:19:00] cried by reason of my infliction unto
[1:19:02] the Lord and he heard me. out of the
[1:19:04] belly the out of out of the belly of
[1:19:06] hail cried I and thou heardest my voice
[1:19:09] for thou hast cast me in the deep in the
[1:19:11] midst of the sea and the floods compass
[1:19:12] me about all thy billows and thy waves
[1:19:15] pass over me and I then I said I have
[1:19:18] cast out of thy sight yet I will look
[1:19:21] again toward thy holy temple the waters
[1:19:24] compass me about even to the soul the
[1:19:26] depths closed around ABOUT ME THE WEEDS
[1:19:28] were wrapped ABOUT MY HEAD I WENT DOWN
[1:19:30] TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAINS THE EARTH
[1:19:32] where their bars were about me forever.
[1:19:35] Yet hast thou brought upon MY LIFE FROM
[1:19:37] BROUGHT UP MY LIFE of corruption. Oh
[1:19:39] Lord my God, WHEN MY SOUL FAINTTH WITHIN
[1:19:42] ME, I REMEMBER THE LORD, AND MY PRAYER
[1:19:44] CAME unto thee in thy holy temple. AND
[1:19:47] THEY THAT OBSERVE LYING BANDIES FORSAKE
[1:19:49] THEIR OWN MERCY. BUT I WILL SACRIFICE
[1:19:52] UNTO THEE WITH THE VOICE OF THANKSGIVING
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; IN THE BELLY OF A FISH.
[1:20:01] I DON'T SEE anybody in here today in a
[1:20:03] belly of a fish.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; I don't see anybody coming to church
[1:20:07] today in wells vomit or fish vomit. I
[1:20:11] don't right
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; seaweed wrapped around.
[1:20:16] What's that smell?
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; No, you came here in a plush car heated
[1:20:22] most to most time heated seats.
[1:20:27] That's right.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Powered by an engine.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; You didn't have to work at
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; barely had to push your foot.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Kick back
[1:20:39] listening to maybe some tunes or a
[1:20:40] message.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Sit down on a padded pew.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Didn't have to walk hardly more than 100
[1:20:48] yards. Maybe.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Whoopde-doo.
[1:20:56] It's the truth, church. We get so
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; caught up in our stuff that we don't
[1:21:00] realize what we really have to be
[1:21:02] thankful for.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; So, I was talking about that 17 year old
[1:21:07] boy, pregnant women walking 70 miles. 70
[1:21:11] mi, not 70 feet, 70 miles to be in a
[1:21:15] service.
[1:21:17] not sit on that seat like you got.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe not even a seat.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; But at best just a a little slat of
[1:21:24] wood.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; It'll Some of us need to travel some
[1:21:28] more, I think, to some places like that.
[1:21:29] Then we'll be a lot more thankful. That
[1:21:31] that trip has never left me.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And listen, I I went back just a few
[1:21:39] years ago and it ain't hardly any
[1:21:41] better.
[1:21:44] Hello. And we've been enjoying all we
[1:21:46] got for how many years?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Come on. I I I'm just be be very very
[1:21:52] open and very We We We've not We ain't
[1:21:54] had just one nice church. We've had
[1:21:56] several nice churches.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; God's blessings.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; God's abilities to put in men that would
[1:22:03] give of their sacrifice. And listen,
[1:22:05] it's God's blessings. There's people
[1:22:06] that would long to just have a little
[1:22:08] structure, a little little tin hut to
[1:22:10] worship their God. Amen.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And we have all this. Don't let it
[1:22:15] become so common.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; To where we come and it's just a ritual
[1:22:21] anymore. That's that's where where where
[1:22:23] where sacrifices became
[1:22:27] actually became a profane thing in God's
[1:22:30] nostrils. And if you look up that
[1:22:31] profane, it actually means it became so
[1:22:34] common
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; to them that they didn't really put the
[1:22:37] effort anymore. So they they just
[1:22:39] brought whatever they could get and they
[1:22:40] just brought the the just whatever lamb
[1:22:42] they could find. They they just brought
[1:22:43] whatever. It's just maim and the halt
[1:22:45] and the stinking and the that wasn't
[1:22:47] what God required.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we'll do the
[1:22:51] same thing.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Just like Israel, we might not bring a
[1:22:54] physical lamb, but we'll bring our
[1:22:55] stinking attitudes and we'll bring this
[1:22:57] and that and everything else. Come on,
[1:22:58] somebody.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Don't get nothing out of church. And
[1:23:02] we're sitting in one one of the GREATEST
[1:23:03] PLACES EVER UNDER one of the greatest
[1:23:05] ministries. I I'm just being honest.
[1:23:07] Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WOULD LONG TO be where we're at
[1:23:12] in this seat. I'm not I'm not trying to
[1:23:14] say anything out of order. I'm just
[1:23:15] trying to LET YOU KNOW YOU GOT A LOT TO
[1:23:17] BE THANKFUL FOR.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13 and verse 15 says, "By him
[1:23:30] therefore let us offer offer the
[1:23:32] sacrifice of praise to God continually."
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Uh oh. So, in other words, it's not
[1:23:38] seasonal
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; or optional
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; a command. It's not It's not like I
[1:23:47] said, it's not a season of say, "Well,
[1:23:49] I'm in the season of life, so I I just
[1:23:51] don't feel it." No, that's the time to
[1:23:52] do it.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; It's not whether you feel it or you
[1:23:56] don't feel it, but in SPITE OF ALL THE
[1:23:57] CIRCUMSTANCES, STANCES AND FEELINGS AND
[1:23:59] PROBLEMS, I'M GOING TO CONTINUALLY THANK
[1:24:01] GOD FOR HIS GRACE. I'M going to
[1:24:03] continually thank him for his love and
[1:24:05] his FAVOR AND HIS MERCY. I'M GOING TO
[1:24:07] THANK HIM THAT HE NOT ONLY GAVE ME
[1:24:09] CHILDREN, BUT HE GAVE ME CHILDREN THAT
[1:24:11] BELIEVE HIM, that worship HIM, THAT WANT
[1:24:13] TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE. I'M NOT GOING TO
[1:24:14] JUST THANK HIM FOR JUST A CHURCH. I'M
[1:24:16] GOING TO THANK HIM THAT HE GAVE ME A
[1:24:18] GOOD CHURCH AND A GOOD PASTOR AND GOOD
[1:24:20] MINISTRY. NOT JUST GOOD MINISTRY, BUT
[1:24:22] GOOD WORSHIP AND AND GOOD SINGING AND
[1:24:24] GOOD SAINTS AND GOOD musicians
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; and good MEN AND WOMEN SITTING BESIDE ME
[1:24:31] HELPING ME IN MY TROUBLE, HELPING ME IN
[1:24:33] MY PROBLEMS.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Daniel found himself in a spot one time
[1:24:41] in Daniel 6 and verse 10 said he kne
[1:24:44] said he kneel on his knees three times a
[1:24:46] day and prayed and gave thanks to his
[1:24:49] God.
[1:24:50] He was under political attack.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; His life was in danger.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; When obedience, if he obeyed, if he
[1:24:58] obedience was going to carry a cost.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; But before deliverance came, Daniel
[1:25:05] trusted God enough to thank him before
[1:25:08] the miracle ever took place.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus took loaves and and when he when
[1:25:17] he had held them, he'd give thanks.
[1:25:22] didn't look like much.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; He gave thanks before the multiplic
[1:25:29] multiplication happened.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Thank you, Father, for
[1:25:35] you fed the 5,000 when we have 12
[1:25:37] baskets left over." He gave thanks while
[1:25:39] he was holding two fish and five loaves
[1:25:41] of bread.
[1:25:46] When you give thanks for what you have,
[1:25:49] even if what you have seems so little,
[1:25:53] you must remember you serve a God who
[1:25:55] multiplies.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 16 and verse 25, we find
[1:26:03] Paul and Silas.
[1:26:05] It was their thanksgiving that unlocked
[1:26:08] a breakthrough.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises
[1:26:14] unto God.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; If you look into that, I've studied on
[1:26:18] it, preached on it before. IT'S ACTUALLY
[1:26:19] THE PASSOVER PSALMS, WHICH is Psalms 113
[1:26:22] through 118 and 136. It's actually seven
[1:26:25] psalms designated for the Passover. I
[1:26:28] think that's wonderful because there's
[1:26:29] seven church ages. God just don't leave
[1:26:31] anything out.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the very first thing, put up,
[1:26:35] put up real quick Psalms 113. Could you
[1:26:38] I just want to set the scene again
[1:26:39] because one of my favorite stories. Here
[1:26:41] they are in pain, in chains, in darkness
[1:26:45] without knowing what God would even do.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Praise ye [screaming] the Lord.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that. Oh man, we could have a
[1:26:59] praise shouting service after the
[1:27:00] sickness is gone and the answers are
[1:27:02] made and all this. NO, THIS WAS BEFORE
[1:27:04] ANY OF THAT HAPPENED.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; PRAISE YE THE LORD. PRAISE OH YOU
[1:27:08] SERVANTS OF THE LORD all the way down
[1:27:10] through 113. Amen. NEXT VERSE. PRAISE.
[1:27:13] BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD FROM
[1:27:15] THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVER MORE. FROM
[1:27:18] THE RISING OF THE SUN UNTO THE GOING
[1:27:20] DOWN OF THE SAME. THE LORD'S NAME IS to
[1:27:23] be praised.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Stop there for JUST A MOMENT. THE LORD'S
[1:27:27] NAME IS TO BE PRAISED. HE didn't say
[1:27:30] when you get up in the morning and it
[1:27:31] just goes all good and everything's
[1:27:33] lovely and everything's hunkador and
[1:27:35] there's no problems and there no
[1:27:36] situation the sun goes down. Praise ye
[1:27:38] the Lord. HE SAID FROM THE RISING OF THE
[1:27:41] SUN TO THE GOING DOWN.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; He didn't dictate ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS
[1:27:46] IN BETWEEN. BUT WHAT HE DID DICTATE FROM
[1:27:48] THE RISING [screaming] OF THE SUN TO THE
[1:27:50] GOING DOWN. HIS NAME IS TO be praised.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Next verse. The Lord is high above all
[1:27:59] the nations. His glory above all the
[1:28:01] heavens.
[1:28:03] Who is like unto the Lord our God who
[1:28:04] dwelleth upon high? Who humble himself
[1:28:08] to behold the things that are in heaven
[1:28:09] and are on earth.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; He raises up the poor out of the dust
[1:28:14] and lifts the needy out of the dungill.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That he may set him with
[1:28:19] princes, even the princes of his people.
[1:28:23] He maketh THE BARREN WOMAN TO KEEP HOUSE
[1:28:25] AND TO BE A JOYFUL mother of children.
[1:28:28] Praise ye the Lord.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. YOU MAY BE THE POOREST OF
[1:28:35] THE POOR, BUT HE'LL TAKE WHAT YOU HAVE
[1:28:37] AND HE'LL MAKE IT WORK IN YOUR BEHALF.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; SO IN PAIN AND DARKNESS, THEY RESPONDED
[1:28:46] WITH PRAISE.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Before there was an
[1:28:50] earthquake, before open doors happened,
[1:28:53] before broken chains came, before
[1:28:56] salvation for a household,
[1:28:58] thankful faith
[1:29:01] shakes spiritual prisons.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Thankful faith is praising before the
[1:29:12] answer ever comes.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; It's trusting God when everything is
[1:29:17] uncertain. Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; It's expressing gratitude continually.
[1:29:23] It's seeing trials through the lenses of
[1:29:26] God's goodness.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; It's believing that every situation is
[1:29:33] under God's care.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Thankful faith is not a feeling. It's a
[1:29:39] declaration of trust.
[1:29:44] Brother Brandon would actually preach a
[1:29:47] Thanksgiving message here in Streetport,
[1:29:49] Louisiana. I
[1:29:51] go listen to it. Invisible Union of the
[1:29:53] bride.
[1:29:55] He said, "I have a little title with a
[1:29:57] few remarks I want to make in some
[1:29:59] scriptures, Lord willing, to a
[1:30:01] Thanksgiving message,
[1:30:03] the invisible union of the bride of
[1:30:05] Christ."
[1:30:07] The invisible union of the bride of
[1:30:09] Christ. It doesn't sound like a
[1:30:12] thanksgiving message
[1:30:14] though the scriptures were are thankful
[1:30:16] for all of it. He said I'm thankful to
[1:30:18] God to be living in this time of the
[1:30:20] closing scenes of this world's history.
[1:30:21] I don't know if I ever had would had a
[1:30:24] say a say so before the foundation of
[1:30:27] the world and God would have laid out
[1:30:29] the whole program to me and said I want
[1:30:31] you to preach now. What age do you
[1:30:33] desire to go to the earth and preach? I
[1:30:35] would have chose this age. I think this
[1:30:38] is the golden age. Amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; I certainly would have loved to been
[1:30:43] there during the time of his visit to
[1:30:44] earth, but I still think I would. This
[1:30:47] right now is a greater time because it's
[1:30:49] a time that he's coming to take the
[1:30:51] people he redeemed and he's nearing the
[1:30:54] resurrection when all the redeemed will
[1:30:56] come forth.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; WHAT A GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY we have
[1:31:00] today to speak to a dying people. IT'S A
[1:31:02] GREAT TIME AND we are enthused about it.
[1:31:05] We know that history IS CLOSING OUT. THE
[1:31:07] WORLD'S HISTORY will soon BE OVER. THEN
[1:31:09] WE'RE GOING TO STEP INTO A NEW DAY, the
[1:31:11] great millennium. That is one believer.
[1:31:13] I believe in a millennium, a millennium
[1:31:14] reign WITH CHRIST, A THOUSAND YEARS upon
[1:31:17] the earth, a physical return of the Lord
[1:31:18] JESUS TO TAKE A PHYSICAL PEOPLE
[1:31:20] GLORIFIED BY HIS cleansing blood. Well,
[1:31:23] LET ME TELL YOU THAT RIGHT THERE ENOUGH
[1:31:25] IS TO ME A THANKSGIVING MESSAGE.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; But he don't end it right there. He goes
[1:31:34] through so many wonderful thing. I ain't
[1:31:35] got time. But he goes into how your
[1:31:37] husband you were first married to was
[1:31:39] divorced and done away with and now
[1:31:41] you've been put on the unmmerited favor
[1:31:43] of almighty grace of almighty God. Put a
[1:31:46] wedding band upon your finger. And he
[1:31:48] goes into justified as though you never
[1:31:50] done it in the first place. You're
[1:31:51] talking about a thanksgiving. He says
[1:31:52] you're thou standing completely. You
[1:31:54] never sin. It's in the sea of God's for
[1:31:57] forgetfulness. You never did it. You
[1:31:59] were accused of it from the beginning,
[1:32:00] but you were predestinated at the
[1:32:02] beginning to be a son or daughter of
[1:32:03] God. And now you're standing washed
[1:32:06] absolutely out of the existence now even
[1:32:08] of the mind of God. YOU'RE THE VIRTUOUS
[1:32:10] BRIDE OF CHRIST WASHED IN THE BLOOD of
[1:32:12] Christ, precious, virtuous, SINLESS SON
[1:32:14] OF GOD, STANDING WITH A PURE UNDULATE.
[1:32:17] APPARENTLY, they didn't hear the same
[1:32:18] message I heard.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Because of my understanding of history,
[1:32:22] they wasn't very thankful for that
[1:32:24] message right there.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; But I'm thankful. I'm thankful that a
[1:32:30] man would stand in front of his peers
[1:32:32] and declare the gospel,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; the message
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; and tell me who I am in the face of
[1:32:39] adversity, in the face of men that
[1:32:41] wasn't even agreeing with him, that was
[1:32:42] actually pulling away from him. In the
[1:32:44] face of it all, he was still I'm
[1:32:46] thankful for a man like that.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; mercy.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; We just end it with this.
[1:33:03] It's [snorts] a prayer.
[1:33:06] So wonderful. The Jehovah miracles.
[1:33:08] Heavenly Father, our hearts are so happy
[1:33:11] tonight.
[1:33:13] Oh, we just feel like we could just take
[1:33:15] off. It seems like you just raised us
[1:33:17] back the roof of this old building. We'd
[1:33:19] go home tonight knowing that the great
[1:33:21] name of the Lord Jesus, that magnificent
[1:33:23] name, that precious name, a name that is
[1:33:26] above all names, a name that even in
[1:33:28] heaven they bow to. Everything on earth
[1:33:30] will bow to it. Oh God, every devil will
[1:33:32] bow to it and recognize it. You give
[1:33:34] that name to us.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Ask the father anything in my name and
[1:33:39] I'll do it. Oh Lord God, who made the
[1:33:41] promise through your son Jesus, let the
[1:33:43] name of Jesus Christ tonight, set every
[1:33:46] sick person free, set every sinner free,
[1:33:48] set every person free. May this be a
[1:33:50] free meeting right now that the Holy
[1:33:52] Ghost can come in and move and give
[1:33:54] glory and praise to God. Granted, Lord,
[1:33:56] WE ARE YOUR PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT UNDER ANY
[1:33:59] BONDAGE. We are free. THE SON HAS MADE
[1:34:01] US FREE. THEREFORE, WE'RE FREE INDEED to
[1:34:04] serve our LORD AND OUR FATHER. WE THANK
[1:34:06] YOU. YOU TALKING ABOUT A THANKSGIVING
[1:34:08] DAY FOR FREEDOM. WE GOT A REAL
[1:34:10] THANKSGIVING DAY. EVERY HOUR OF A
[1:34:13] BELIEVER IS A THANKSGIVING DAY.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; I WHO WAS ONCE BLIND CAN NOW SEE. I WHO
[1:34:20] WAS ONCE A SINNER AM NOW SAVED. OH GOD,
[1:34:23] HOW FREE WE ARE. HOW WE GIVE YOU
[1:34:25] THANKSGIVING. THANKSGIVING FROM MY HEART
[1:34:28] THAT JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD, IS
[1:34:30] NOT DEAD, BUT HE'S ALIVE AND HE'S WITH
[1:34:33] US TONIGHT. AND HE'S POURING OUT HIS
[1:34:35] HOLY GHOST UPON THE CHURCH IN THE LAST
[1:34:37] [cheering and applause] DAYS.
[1:34:39] WOO! JUST BEFORE HIS APPEARANCE AND
[1:34:43] SIGNS AND WONDERS ARE EVERYWHERE,
[1:34:45] MARVELOUS THINGS. AND THE GOD OF HEAVEN,
[1:34:47] OH HALLELUJAH, GIVING PRAISE TO THE
[1:34:50] GLORY TO GOD. HOW WE THANK YOU FOR THESE
[1:34:52] THINGS. IT'S A REAL THANKSGIVING IN OUR
[1:34:54] HEART. RECEIVE THE PRAISES of your
[1:34:57] people, Lord.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; RECEIVE THE PRAISES OF YOUR PEOPLE,
[1:35:01] LORD. WE LOVE YOU. WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE
[1:35:04] AND YOU ARE A reorder of those who
[1:35:06] diligently seek you.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, I realize in another place he said
[1:35:15] it's their own personal faith. The
[1:35:18] minute they believed you, that's the
[1:35:21] minute you received them.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my, that's a lot to be thankful for.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Didn't have to crawl up miles of
[1:35:29] cobblestone.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Just had to believe him.
[1:35:33] You said, "No man can come unto me
[1:35:35] unless my father draws him and all that
[1:35:37] comes, I will give him everlasting life
[1:35:39] and will raise him up at the last day."
[1:35:41] That's your word, Lord. We believe it
[1:35:43] and it's done.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; The work is finished. And we thank you.
[1:35:48] We thank you for it. We thank you for
[1:35:49] the healing of everybody, for every
[1:35:52] weary soul, for everything that's here.
[1:35:55] Those who had feeble hands hanging down.
[1:35:56] Those who have been fearful. Those who
[1:35:58] have wondered. David said, "When I was
[1:36:00] afraid and got scared, I trusted in you
[1:36:02] and I walked on." God, let us stick our
[1:36:04] head up this morning. Not cowards, but
[1:36:06] Christians who believe in Jesus Christ.
[1:36:08] May we walk with our testimony shining,
[1:36:10] made through the healing of our bodies,
[1:36:12] through the testimony of our salvation.
[1:36:14] May we win under win others to thee.
[1:36:16] Granted, Lord, all that on the altar
[1:36:18] we've laid, granted for your glory. We
[1:36:19] believe you. We wait on you. We're just
[1:36:21] bathing in your beauty. Just bathing in
[1:36:23] your promise. Feeling the glorious Holy
[1:36:25] Spirit. Wooing to us. Wooing us to thee.
[1:36:27] How we love you. How we praise you. How
[1:36:29] I worship you, Lord, myself here behind
[1:36:31] this sacred desk with my hands up to
[1:36:33] thee. I worship thee, my God. I worship
[1:36:35] thee. You are my healer. You're my
[1:36:37] savior. You're my king. YOU'RE MY
[1:36:39] PROVIDER. YOU'RE MY FATHER. YOU'RE MY
[1:36:41] BROTHER. YOU'RE MY ALL AND ALL. AND I
[1:36:43] REST in thee. You're my strength. DAVID
[1:36:45] SAID, "I WILL PRAISE YOU BEFORE THE

[1:38:20] It's not our life. It's your life. It's

[1:38:25] It's not our heaven, it's your heaven.

[1:38:29] not our works, it's your works, it's not
[1:38:31] our grace, it's your grace.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT OUR GLORY, IT'S YOUR GLORY.
[1:38:37] IT'S NOT OUR POWER, IT'S YOUR POWER. HOW
[1:38:40] WE LOVE YOU. IT'S NOT OUR CHURCH.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY. IT'S NOT OUR CHURCH.
[1:38:46] IT'S HIS CHURCH.
[1:38:49] [cheering]
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; How we praise you
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; and we bless you. Bless our hearts and
[1:38:55] receive us. Oh God, he says, "Send
[1:38:57] little Brandham Tabernacle and
[1:38:59] outpouring of the spirit." I say, "Oh
[1:39:00] God, send evening light and outpouring
[1:39:02] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; We Lord, we we are needy here in this
[1:39:06] corner." God send down the showers of
[1:39:08] blessing. Pour out the rain of Notice
[1:39:11] how much he praised him before he
[1:39:13] requested.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; We want to request him and get the
[1:39:18] answer and then praise him. And we got
[1:39:20] it all backwards, saints.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Baptize our pastor a new. Set him on
[1:39:28] fire with the gospel. We love him today,
[1:39:29] Lord. He's your servant. We pray that
[1:39:31] you'll anoint his heart. Anoint the
[1:39:32] hearts of other preachers in the
[1:39:33] wilderness. Every member,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; every member. God, send out the showers
[1:39:39] of blessings. Pour out the reign of God,
[1:39:41] the former and the latter.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:46] I wonder how many can say, "God, I want
[1:39:48] some thankful faith.

[1:39:53] to be able to say to
