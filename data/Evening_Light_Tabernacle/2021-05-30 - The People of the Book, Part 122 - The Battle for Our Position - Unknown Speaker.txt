reality for many of us here today that we've been gathered back to the homeland of the word of god and the promises of god are true and real and yes and amen but lord we know there's even a bigger picture than that because one day you'll gather us back to that home lord to be with you forever lord we're looking forward to that time and we thank you for this privilege of serving you today and just asking that you would bless us now in your presence let your anointing just break every yoke take fear and doubt and unbelief out of our lives and cause this lord to to walk in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god until we're a perfect man in christ lord i pray for your children everywhere lord may they hear the voice of the son of man and live today may that rise up lord from the places that they're in maybe some of them in darkness but lord find them wherever they are bring them back home to know you lord i know there's moms and dads and brothers and sisters and lord different ones that are crying out lord because they know their loved ones are out there estranged from you and they want to they want you to reveal yourself to them may it be today wherever they are that you knock on their hearts door that you reveal yourself to them and only as you can do it lord that you can get a hold of a heart that you can change a life lord i i know there are husbands wives different ones lord even children that are crying out for their parents or don't we don't want to leave one behind not a hook so we pray dear god that you'll do that work of grace reach out and get them lord bring deliverance to the house of god today wherever your people are around the world may you just minister to them we're here for service and we're here to give our best we're here to surrender our all we're here oh god to speak as an oracle of god so i stand here today yielding myself to you knowing that i can do nothing without you so we're just asking that you minister to us through us today in jesus name amen amen praise the lord could be in the house of the lord today be in his presence amen sing the songs of zion and i love that song i'll bring you back home my children amen i believe that there has been a work of grace in this day to bring his bride his elect people back to the land of promise amen it's so good to be with you and you to be here with us we miss those that are not here but we pray that they will receive a special blessing today we're going to read from daniel chapter 12 again today it's a scripture that i have been ministering on in the last little bit but i want to go beyond that today into some things that i really um want to share with you as the lord has been dealing with my heart we pray earnestly and and um put our hearts into every service so we're believing that we're here right at the scripture where we need to be this morning amen amen god bless you daniel chapter 12 verse 1 and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that time that same time and at that time that people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book aren't you glad your name is in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake someday everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end and many shall run to and fro in knowledge shall be increased amen god bless you can be seated we're going to be speaking here today as we look here at the people of the book and we're going to be speaking on our the battle for our position because we have been commissioned and called and ordained in this age and been given a promised land but like israel was when they were given a land they found it possessed and inhabited and they had a job of dispossessing the adversary and taking possession of the promised land so today we're going to be speaking along that line and we see again that michael stands up or he arises for the purpose of deliverance it is um during a time of trouble such as never before and i believe we are have arrived these things were prophesied in the scripture and spoke about an end time and i believe that we are here and we also know that in a few chapters before for your reference it would be chapter 10 that there was a war in the heavens and there were angelic battles that were going on where gabriel fought against the prince of persia in order to get revelation to to daniel daniel was was searching in the books to be able to find out what was to be done in his hour he knew the time was at hand he knew it was a time for the people to leave babylon and go back to their promised land and so he began to fast and began to pray and began to call on god and um and it was 21 days that he prayed and he wouldn't give up he kept persevering and we always need to take admonition from that because we know when a promise of god is there you don't give up on it you keep seeking and keeping on seeking you keep asking and keeping on asking knocking and keeping on knocking you don't you just don't knock once and well he didn't answer so you give up on it but no you you hang on to that promise jesus told us it was like the unjust judge um and the the widow woman that come to him to say uh advent me of mine enemies and so um he said i i don't fear man and i don't even fear god it was unjust judge but he said that this is what i do fear i fear this woman will wear me out by coming and if i don't adventure of her enemies she's not going to give up so i'm going to adventure of her enemies and this is what he taught us to do to pray and not to faint or not to give up and and so um in the if we just could realize that uh if we stay believing holding on to promise we're going to win the battle amen now we we know from the reading that we just read that only those whose names are written in the book will be delivered and in this time the wise shall shine as the stars or as the sons of the messiah and those who know their god shall do exploits and we we can look back in the biblical histories and we can see men like abel or enoch or noah or abraham isaac jacob joseph men who shone as the stars amen that they were the bright lights in their age and their time and he tells us in here that this end time people is going to shine just like they did amen that they will persevere in their days and their hour just as the sons of the messiah and that they that know their god will do exploits and so it's a time of trouble but yet it's also a time of deliverance and this deliverance includes a resurrection and of course we new testament believers know by the further revelation of the scripture that the alive and remain also at the coming of the lord are to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and um so again this is this is something that we know there's not just something done for the dead but for also those who are alive and remain will be changed and we also notice that this book is sealed until the time of the end so the words of the prophecy were not meant to be understood until the last days and it would be at the last days that that the book would be open so we can see it is alluding to the fact that there will come an end where the book will be opened was a time of sealing of of hush quiet is not through this time go that way daniel rest in your lot but um there's going to come a time of fulfillment and i'm thankful to know we are in an hour of fulfillment where all the word that has been pointing to this day and pointing to this hour is now being fulfilled and so it is during this time though that angelic wars begin and i want to really capitalize on this we've been speaking for some time on the angels and the angelic influence and but we also want to realize that this is a time of war where that there are battles that are not just going on the earth although angelic wars uh become human battles but yet at the same time that there is a disturbance in the heavenlies where that there are things that are happening bringing about these end time events when these it's not an accident we're here where we are this has been pre-planned and predestined of almighty god and you are predestined and pre pre planned to be right here in this hour in this time for this great battle and so in this great battle is a where angelic wars begin where michael arises to to bring an escape in the time of trouble now this this parallels many scriptures it parallels end times events of the lamb taking his stand of revelation 10 1 the mighty angel standing on the land in the sea they're standing all of these things are symbolic representation of the rising the moving of the of god as he moves about bringing this rapture this deliverance that is promised now we can see by natural evidence in natural israel israel that uh how that nothing's short of the miraculous but by heaven's decree and by interventional intervention of angels that but that israel israel is the bride's natural counterpart israel is in her homeland now after thousands of years how was it that she was gathered back to that homeland is nothing short of the miracle working hand of god and the tender hand of jehovah brother branham would parallel them he said it was a tender hand of jehovah leading them back to the tree of life because they have to be in their promised land in order to receive their messiah for the two prophets to come to them and we have to be as a people also people under the tender hand of jehovah called out of the denominations rooted up from our homes the churches we were in for hundreds of years our families was there maybe your family on on the pew there or they uh they were charter members or they were in this denomination or whatever and you you had to leave from there why was it because they had turned them into into a holocaust they had come there into concentration camps to where that your soul was starving and you know you but yet it was a tender hand of jehovah leading you to the tree of life putting a hunger in you when others would die there when others would perish there god had uh something better in mind for you and that was to bring a word of deliverance and that word of deliverance would bring you to the tree of life amen back to the promised land where you can receive your messiah where a rapture could take place you see a rapture couldn't take place in the denomination it couldn't take a resurrection couldn't take place there god had to call you out back to the land to reveal to you the real christ the son of the living god this is what god had to do and all of this has been in this last age as natural israel types the spiritual bride who has returned to her ancient homeland as the people of the book and this has been our theme for some time because it is the unsealing of the book the revealing of its seals that gives us our rights to take a position in the land you see this this was um the ancient proof that was given to uh the the to israel when they when they found when there was a little baboon boy bedouin boy threw a rock down into a cave and and heard a a seal break amen and went in there and found the dead sea scrolls right amen this gave them the this gave them the book to the land or the title to the land this was our people we were here before anybody else this predates the muslim this predates the catholics this predates all the other churches that want to hang on to the holy sites we were here first this is our land god gave it to us it's written in the scrolls and i'll tell you the opening of the book it shows our inheritance in the land this is our land this is our scripture this is our message there are others that want to lay claim to it but it belongs to the bride of jesus christ my name is in this book this is my family heritage this is where i descend from this is my anchor in the land it is the proof that i've always been here that i lay claim to this promise that my fathers were were there matthew mark and luke and john my fathers were peter and and paul and and all the other disciples my father was jesus christ and it goes back into the old testament it is that was me there and david i have a claim to the lamb we are just now celebrating a memorial day and god bless all the veterans that have stood and helped to bring freedom to this land of america and god bless you for your service those of you that have and but how however you know we have now a woman in the white house her name is kamala she has no ties to this land her family one come from from my what was it jamaica and another from india and she was just born here and got got the right to stay and and maybe her parents had become naturalized but she has no ties to lincoln she has no ties to washington and and this this week it was notable that when she sent out her tweet she said have a happy long holiday nothing said about our troops nothing reminding and remembering the men who had died so we could have holidays you see she has no ties to the land even her fathers didn't help to get this land her grandparents didn't help get this land i mean they have no vested interest in this land there wasn't she wasn't freed by lincoln she has no attachment to our heritage and i want to tell you there are people that are claiming christianity that have no attachment to the book they have no attachment to the promises they have no attachment to the man of david or or daniel or isaiah or jeremiah they have no attachment to peter or paul or the the books of the bible they don't find their identity there they find their identity in a social club rather than being their identity written in the book they don't rejoice in the wars that are won they have no appreciation for the freedoms except the freedom to turn the grace of god into lasciviousness now but we have an attachment to the book we have an attachment we have connection there that was my father that was my god amen that was that was him that became flesh and dwelt among us i have descended from him i am his child this is my land and my promise when it speaks of a rapture it may not mean anything to anybody else but it means something to me because it's speaking of me amen it is my promise when it speaks of healing maybe everybody else discounts it and say well we don't believe that these and miracles are passed it is for you because you have no attachment to the book [Music] now you see it is the unsealing of the book the removing of its seals that gives us our rights to take our position in the land because it opens the book breaks the seals on it so we can see our identity with the promise now our kinsmen as we see in revelation 5 is handed the seven sealed book of redemption and it is handed him from the original owner we lost possession of this great title deed book when adam sinned and he lost his position of sonship and the book then went back in the hands of the original owner which was god but now satan contests it because he says it does not belong to us because of sin we sold out to him so he claims that there are liens on the book or liens on the title that keeps us from possessing our inheritance now and of course since adam did this and sinned and lost his position of sonship and surrendered his title of of the to the lamb that there has been a squatter on the land since that time and that's the devil satan has does does not own the earth it does not belong to him and what i wanted to say i also want to put satan on notice this morning that this body is of earth and it doesn't belong to the devil he has no right to it he is only a squatter and we're only here at a time where he can squat because we are at a point of the jubilee and the purpose of the breaking of the seals is to fully give inheritance back to the sons of god as noted in revelation 5 we see that the lamb does not keep the book for himself but he takes the book and he removes its seals and then in revelation 10 you see a transition of the book from from heaven to earth and i want to i want to get it back to you the the title deed has now been brought by the anointing of the mighty angel down to earth where that you can be a possessor of the title deed now this this is shown as heaven moves and as revelation describes another mighty angel with a rainbow over his head whose countenance is like the sun this covenant angel christ coming as the messenger of his covenant and he is seen descending with this book that is now open and he positions his feet on the land and the sea you can see he is claiming possession now satan is a squatter he doesn't legally own title to you or to this earth let me just make it clear you never originally belonged to the devil god had first claims on you it meant long before you ever even breathed your first breath here you had a beginning with him in the eternities because you began in the very mind and the thoughts of god which are eternal this gives an eternal quality to all of god's elect that remains that you are not just a time being but you are an eternal being and as an eternal being you are like jesus who said i came from god and i'm going back to god i fell from a position because of sin but i'm going back to where i come from amen i am i am only here so journey through this time of mortality but i have a greater future than that of this mortal realm i have a future in the eternals with my god as an eternal son of god who will never die who will never fall amen fall away forever one who whose fall was only temporary because of redemption he has come to restore us now satan is a squatter he doesn't legally own title to you or the earth but he possesses it right now even if he doesn't possess your soul you're born again he no longer possesses your soul no longer does that dark shadow that spirit his brother brethren would say you have a trouble it's cancer but you got a deeper shadow than that and that you are that that is your center you see we were all sometimes darkness but now we are light in the lord is that right amen his brother branham would see as they were healed i see it turned light around you see they were sometime darkness but then they were light when redemption comes it is the day star the sun as the sun shining into a a darkened place and is bringing the light of the glory of god amen oh my when you know that they the morning the bible speaks of it as the wings of the morning and when the sun rises you remember what it was like when the sun rose in your heart and man it defused the doubts it diffused the fears it it it revealed the sin it exposed it where you could get rid of it where satan had no place to hide the the time of your your past darkness now fled away as the as the light shone and the wings of the morning began to show its rays of lights and and there you know the morning came and dawned within your soul as the day star the sun rose within you yes the wind of god now satan is a squatter he doesn't legally own title to your earth he doesn't look entitled to this earth but he possesses it but i want to tell you and i want to remind satan of his final place revelation 2010 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone here you're in though satan you may be a tormentor today you may be a squatter today but i'm telling you about your end the devil to see them was cast in the lake of fire and brimstone where the beasts and the false prophets are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever amen i don't know how long that will be but i know he'll eventually come to an end satan will not be saved no sir he will be torment listen amen i i don't know how long he'll be tormented but i'll tell you as long as he has tormented the earth he will be tormented ten times more amen now so again as we look at this revelation 2014 and not only that but his instrument death and hell are death and the grave were cast in the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire amen why because they don't belong here now in revelation 12 revelation 12 he is seen in the heavens i'm talking about lucifer heaven a place where he is ruled there now since the fall of man as the accuser of the brethren now for thousands of years he has contested man's rights to the earth including the earth of his own body it was the prayer of jesus and every saint prays the same way as jesus taught us to pray that that thy kingdom come god's kingdom come again to the earth where god's will will be done in this earth as it is in heaven amen now right now i can't control all the earth out here but there is this earth this body that i have amen that i can say that kingdom has come it is the holy ghost it's where he is the king and where he is the king god's will is done in this earth just the way it would be done in heaven this is the striving of every true believer to give god that kind of preeminence in their earth [Applause] now there was in the old testament some laws that were set forth that reflected god's great plan one of them was the law of jubilee in the old testament if a man through indebtedness lost his inheritance the squatter could only hold it until the year of jubilee in other words he could take it for a time he's just showing you the squatter has a time amen somebody asked me the other day you know why is it that after the bride is gone that all satan's venom is poured out upon the remnant of the woman's seed and upon the 144 000 and upon the upon the gentile church that goes through the tribulation why is that i said because the bible said that satan is cast out and he knows he has but a short time you see he has but a time i want you to understand you're not a time being you're not temporal you will be here throughout the eternal ages when satan is no more come on now you are here you predate him and you amen you predate him and you also will be here long after he's gone amen and you can look at your sickness your troubles your problems and things that you face today and you know they're only temporary but you're not temporary thank god we're not temporary amen amen we are not the people who can be conquered or defeated but we are people who are undefeatable now when the when the jubilee trumpet sounds it's time to throw down your hole and return to your inheritance as we have spent some time on this i've shown you that this is where the day of pentecost fully comes it is the pentecost of pentecost as we have explained of the seven weeks after the passover then comes the then comes the time of jubilee or the time of the 50th day which jubilee means the 50th and so when the jubilee trumpet would sound it's time to throw down your whole and it shows us and it's a time of the sounding of freedom and if there's anything that this message should all do to you it should be a sound a trumpet call of freedom amen that today you can lay down your hope you can drop your shovel amen you don't have to turn one bit of soil more for the devil you work no more for him you're not his slave any longer you are not in bondage to some of his denominational systems you are free people you have been set free and he that the son is set free is free indeed amen now this is shown in type from calvary where jesus died for 50 days the resurrection was questioned you know they questioned the resurrection for 50 days you know people could wonder some who had not seen him could wonder and the and it was questioned satan said he didn't raise from the dead he still says today he's not alive even even paid the soldiers to say that the disciples came and stole away his body by night the thought of it was you know it was just another creed of new denominations starting up and and you know you you look at all of this time since then the signs of his resurrection we we have longed to see that but we're living in the hour where the signs of the resurrection has been manifest but now there for that 50 days or those seven weeks after the passover and the resurrection there there were many that could question it there were many that could ponder and wonder and but on the 50th day on the day of pentecost the legal owner came down and showed it was more than just a new creed a new denomination starting up another same old ism of judaism or another phariseeism or sadducees it was more than another ism it was the filling of the holy ghost that burst sons into the in in houses of earth that was once enslaved by the devil men and women boys and girls who had been once laid enslaved by the devil whose members defied god whose hands did evil whose eyes run to do evil whose whose thoughts was on evil continually men and women who were born enslaved to sin that they got liberated not only were they liberated they were built by the spirit of god and then bodies that once served the devil that was a slave to sin whose hands were left to do and evil now they were their bodies the members of their body are yielded to do righteousness that was god's earnest money to his church and it showed it would not be controlled by organizations it would be the earnest of the baptism of the holy ghost with power and the love of god but i want you to notice it was the earnest amen in my other words it was the first payment which means there comes a day when the full payment is made where one had partial redemption another age finally comes to the time of full redemption and in this redemption possession of their land of their promises now the holy ghost of course is when god possesses you it is not rules and regulations passed down by bishop or a pope but by the spirit of the living god living in you now as i told you about my dream the other day i'm bringing and drawing a lot of inspiration from christ is the mystery of god revealed where that where brother branham tells us that god's great plan was revealed first in christ in order that he might get the preeminence in the church by bringing his life into a people and i want you to understand in our christian walk today it must be christ heaven preeminence now when we say that we do not mean a church having preeminence or a pastor having preeminence are rules and regulations of that church having preeminence you see people by church governments can be made to do a lot of things and factor that matter is church governments permit or prevent some people in the amish mennonite community from driving a car or it prevents them from driving a red car and they can only they can only drive a black car with a with a black bumper or you know it gives regulations on what kind of clothes that they will wear and in order to to do this you see they are not converted they are actually ruled by church governments now the idea that god has in this end time is not to rule you by pastoral rule or church governments like a lady you know a woman actually came to the church one time and she said you know i think brother tim is a reasonable man i think if you sisters would all go to him and talk to him real kindly and nicely that he let you wear pants and he'd allow you to cut your hair i'm sure he's a he seems like a nice man to me and if you'd all go to him and just you know talk to him reasonably he would agree to that but you see i didn't make the rules and i'm not the government and i'm not the enforcer of the government amen the enforcer is the holy ghost he abides in you and man he there is the rule of your life and he tells you what's right and wrong for he leads and guides you into all truths but you see denominations wants a man or a set of rules to give you that if you if you if you're in these boundaries you're safe you know you're going to go to heaven with the rest of us this is where your salvation is tied to a church but our salvation is not tied to evening like tabernacle our salvation is in christ and christ alone amen if we leave from here and go to another place somewhere you know we will not be lost amen we don't have to be here to go in the rapture amen you don't have to come here to get the holy ghost it's not the requirement and then your requirement is to meet christ salvation is in christ alone it's not an obeying church governments that means you can you can come along and you find the rule is well among these women they don't cut their hair well i'll never cut mine well they wear their dresses well they'll always wear dresses you know they don't paint their will we'll we'll do we'll throw away our our paint you know we'll none of that saves you none of that there is only one place of salvation and that's in christ and christ alone and you can tell if he's your husband by your obedience to the word but you see denomination puts a rule of man over man and man can change the rules but i can't change god's rules nice a man as i am and thank you for the compliment but i can't change the rules i can't change what god says now so you see the holy ghost is when god possesses you not rules and regulations passed down by a bishop or a pope but by the spirit of the living god dwelling in you amen i'm just telling you i this is why i refuse to be people's holy ghost if the lord don't convict you well then you know i me me going and making you do it is not going to do it amen you're going it's going to have to be a revelation of christ personally to you in christ the mystery of god revealed brother madam told us that so many people got the wrong conception and they do to convert people to christianity and this government is not god's thought at all you say well we make converts to christianity by his government that's not it well we're they're not they're not supposed to drink they're not supposed to lie see these are rules we don't drink we don't lie we quit doing this and we don't do that and he said do you know the muhammadans can outshine you you know the heathen in africa then black men they got laws among their tribes that outshine anything you can produce in christianity now but he's but it's not that you see it's not an organizational life of laws and mandates where you have to try to conform to the rules of the church but it's god making himself known personally in every individual every person where christ has the preeminence in you now we know when he has the preeminences because when you come subject to his word right amen but he said we're not supposed to make converts to christianity by government but by revelation the christ in you as god was in christ as god was in christ christ in you how did god come into christ he came into him first he prepared him as a body and there at the river jordan he comes fills him with his life is that right so what god did in christ to fill you with his life he does the same thing as he did with christ when god did that in christ a christ does in you what signs god did in christ god does in you christ doesn't you isn't that beautiful oh my i like that at that day when this that's this day at this day when this revelation is made known you will know that i am in the father and the father in me and i you and you and me when the revelation is made manifest at that day you will know that i am the father one i'm in the father and the father is in me and then when the revelation comes forth then it's i in you and you and me now he's not talking about a doctrinal revelation he's talking about the revelation of christ personally you in the new birth an experience where you meet god on your own are you with me now that day on pentecost was god's earnest money depositing the baptism of the holy ghost until full redemption of the ever son of god and then there would be a resurrection and a change in the great jubilee of jubilees and that's where we are the trumpet is sounding for that jubilee of jubilees you hear the trumpet i know what it said it said come out of her my people look at israel they heard a sound they heard a trumpet and them jews from all over the place they heard it said come out of her my people come back to your promised land come back amen amen here we are in the jubilees of the jubilees where the book has been taken by the lamb and not only have we received the irony of our inheritance but we're receiving the title to full redemption we have something that they didn't have at pentecost in the book of acts they had earnest money we are receiving the fullness now here in the jubilee of jubilees where we are receiving that full redemption mysteries that have been sealed become open because the angel of the covenant the pillar of fire we know what he did the one in the old testament that he became the lamb and the lamb as a man claimed the book and now as in the last day at this pentecost at the end of the seven ages the church is receiving the book and the title to their inheritance the title to the inheritance of truth of the one and living god the name of god amen not father son and holy ghost but the name given and revealed amen it's important that the children know who their father is so now the title to eternal security to the believer where we are sealed to the day of redemption the title to eternal life showing there is no eternal life in hell no one burns eternally there the fire is eternal because god's a consuming fire but as far as eternal life only in god dwells immortality so no one can live in more immortal without the immortal life of god so therefore only god dwells in immortality so we know the souls that sinneth you shall die the bible said there comes an end amen now but however all of these mystery truths and i just named two or three of them and one reason for that is because where i was studying that's those are the three that brother branham mentions i just mentioned them but i i just want you to know that all the mystery truths that are laying in the scripture all of the uh of the definition the landmarks of the promised land amen have now been revealed and we are living in a time where we can see the full scope of everything that god wants us to possess are you with me now looking today at modern israel and what is happening there the enemies of israel so perfectly type satanist squatters and they are insisting on possession without title but i want you to notice that every time that we make a claim on our inheritance satan is just like there in israel there is a riot that he is there to riot to hurl bombs our direction but god honors his covenant and continually defends his people although it seems all the world is against her and i assure you all of hell is against this bride all of hell has assembled against you fact of the matter is he even has more in his in his arsenal in this day in his army that there are there are 300 million more demonic spirits if you really got to that that that word 300 million is really not 300 million that's king james version for a large number it's an innumerable number you can't count how many demons have been allowed to come into here to make satan's eden and he's using every tool at his disposal come on now he's coming in every direction and every voice to keep you from hearing the true voice amen there's all kinds of voices going on and there the den of it is louder and louder that's why you young people you've got to hear the voice you can't just be hearing the voices of hollywood's in your video games and caught up in in a realm of a fake world in fake news and man you got to come back to the real gospel and hear his voice [Music] because if any man will hear my voice i will come in and i'll suffer with him and he with me you got to come to the place where you're hearing where you're listening do you hear the trumpet sound do you hear the jubilee saying you can go free because there'll be a people that actually refuse to hear whose ears will be bored with an awl and they'll never hear another jubilee trumpet there's a line that can be crossed oh thank me to god he saved us from that line i was drifting deep in sin far from the peaceful shore you were too very deeply stained with sin seeking to rise no more but aren't you glad there's a master that reached down for you these squatters in the land of israel they insist on possession without title and so it is it was satan he insists on possessing though he doesn't own title and but you know but but again you can see that plainly the protection of the lord and his love for us that he continually shows that he will not allow his bride to be defeated they have sworn they would push israel into the sea and they have yet to do it and the devil has sworn that he will destroy us as he did in ancient egypt they're pushing the israelites trying to push them in the sea but in that moment god made a way through the scene now god uses his ministry like a like a armed military to take the land that he has given us to in his word and you look at israel you can see the mighty hand of jehovah the rebirth of israel is so genuine it's such a genuine miracle and the rebirth of the bride of jesus christ is nothing short of a miracle i want to i want to give something to you you you people that can come up a little late this message was founded on miracles it began with the miraculous hand of god showing us the possessions of the word of god and it's going to end with the miraculous hand of god as god raptures the people out of here changing us with a massive divine healing from the top of the head to the soul of the feet [Music] this message began in the miraculous it's going to end in the miraculous amendment and let me just tell you it is now working in the miraculous it's not just something future and in the past it is a present because jesus christ was saved yesterday today and forever he is the i am the i am god that's who we serve the i am the ever-present god ever-present water from the rock the rock would follow israel and remember it was always in speaking distance that rock was christ and he's always in speaking distance even in your murmurings and you're crying and in your wanderings and your troubles he's still there speak to him out of him will come life given water but it's nothing short of a miracle it's because god is fighting our battles or we wouldn't exist you know you if wouldn't hadn't been fighting your battles look at the mess you'd be in today all you have to do is look around just a little bit with your friends or some of your siblings or somebody else all you have to do you don't have to look very far and you can see the mighty hand that god was on your life he watched over you from the time you were born to now he brought you by his tender hand to this place today you are not here by accident you're here for a predestined moment you have been handpicked amen when god chose out the seeds before the world began as to what seed he would plant on an age he reserved you for this time amen no matter how weak you may feel maybe maybe how how how unloved or uncared for you may feel how insignificant you may feel i want you to know this god had plans for you before the world began and he placed you right here in this age and this time for this hour for this moment to overcome all of the gates of hell and he'll take a week and press down and but the people who could have never made it on their own and he'll take it he'll make something out of them where they could have made nothing out of themselves [Applause] in 1948 within the hours within hours of israel's declaration of statehood the moment they proclaim to be a nation tens of thousands of soldiers from six arab nations armed with state-of-the-art british and french weapons they came and they were raid against an israeli army that was made up of high school students women men the majority who had never seen a battle who never had a day of real training much less genuine battle 45 million arabs were intent on pushing 400 000 jews that were there bunkered on a little tiny strip of land that comprised only one-eighth of one percent of the 6.1 1 million square miles of arab lands and they were bent on pushing them to the sea that's right there was hardly anybody that gave israel any hope shall never make it and i just want to quote to you from psalms 1 24 1 because this is true of israel it's true of you if it had not been the lord who was on our side now mans will say let's repeat it again maybe israel here this morning spiritual israel hearing your pew right now maybe you'll say it with me if it had not been the lord who is on our side now may israel say well man if it had not been when the lord was on our side when men rose up against us they had then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us of satan's forces all the powers of hell were anointed men it would anoint men like stalin and hitler who had heartlessly killed the jews about who would take your babies and your little jewish babies and out of their mother's arm and dash their head up against a wall dr death who would stand there and take a young athlete who had a little problem with his foot and come in for examination who was there in their concentration camp how did you get to be an athlete i'm i'm a runner there and i've been i've trained for the olympics okay we're going to give you a little something to sleep here while we check your foot and they take him and dissect him piece by piece the experiments that they learned on the jews and they did on the jews as a part of what makes up a large part of our of our science that we have today in medical terms when you go and get an operation thank a jew why are you with me when you look at israel you know if it had not been that the lord was on their side they would have swallowed them right quick millions against 400 000 think about you know all of these millions 45 million arabs and i want to say if it had not been that the lord was on our side as demons fled as blind eyes opened as cripples walked and cancer screamed for mercy then and then it was that denominational theories would give way to the name of jesus christ don't you realize if the lord had been not been on our side where would you be today some of you would still be wandering around and around in the confusion of the past amen you wouldn't be where you are today but for the grace of god god was on your side and when you look at israel's existence you have to know it's because the lord is on their side when you see our existence in this evil age when you see all of hell is against us it has to be the lord is on our side god is fighting their battles but he's using them to do it god's fighting our battles too but he's using you to do it you are his soldier his feet on the ground now come on quit quit murmuring about your heavy load now quit murmuring about your heavy army quit murmuring about oh this problem i'm i'm in this fight take the hill hold the line don't retreat quit murmuring and complain and say this is my battle and i'm gonna win it it is a battle for my position amen i will not be defeated in this amen i will not complain i will not get depressed i'll keep the right attitude toward the promise i mean i'm going to press the battle harder than i ever have a sword that's an invincible sword well it's hell with the hand of faith and i will believe in that sword i'll believe it enough to quit using it as decoration and press it to the heart of the enemy it's been a battle having it sister phyllis see you not in your head back there she's rejoicing because she can see again it's been a battle but isn't the victory sleek don't tell me he will give our sight to the blind i'm a witness that he doesn't don't tell daryl ward that that he gives that he don't give sight to the blind he's the witness of it amen we ought to be witnesses of how great our god is how miraculous is his power i gotta hurry i got a lot on my plate now god is using you to fight these battles god is using your battles too he's fighting your battles too but you're his army that he dwells in remember this is where he's fighting you are the boots on the ground he's already shown you he's led in the battle he's went ahead and he conquered hell the grave and every sickness now you go get your goliath that's your job he held up his head come on like david did he held up his head and shook him for the rest of the sea this is why he had to cut his head off and man he couldn't just leave goliath on the ground he had to show all of israel and the man was dead so he takes his own sword and he cuts his head off is that right then he holds up that head for all of israel to see this is what god did at calvary he took the head off of the devil he took the head off of goliath who called who who was who was lord over the grave over the over hell the grave over death come on somebody and he rose up a mighty conqueror and hell holds the head of death up and he says now i conquered this goliath you go conquer yours you got to fill this thing to chase off you got land to conquer every one of you got inheritance in the book if you've got your name in the book but guess what you got to say like caleb give me my mountain this is my mountain god gave it to me brother branham said in this let me read this quotation this is from putting on the whole armor he said god makes his self presence in his army you believe that now god said i sent them the word you just walked right over the top of it disbelieved it i'm god said i made it manifest and they crucified it i'm just getting tired i'm coming to myself so here you come god and you god above us the pillar of fire god with us in jesus christ god in us the holy spirit exactly what i dreamed about the other day my weapon the inspiration christ the mystery god in christ christ in you taking us back to eden same thing and i said that equates with the same sermon never thought of it before till that dream but that equates with the same sermon god above us god with us now god in us so god above us the pillar of fire god with us in jesus christ god in us the holy ghost no more trusting in anything else god come down himself amen this was a man-sized job so he brought it down he's talking about calvary now he didn't trust that with moses elijah any great prophet but he come down himself they won't have nothing to do about it but just let them now surrender themselves to me and i'll walk in them i'll talk in them i'll speak in i'm not working them i'll i'll do the work just let them be humble let them that's that's it you can't do it in yourself now you're no match for satan but if you just let god do it get the word in you then it'll all be taken care of now god fortified his army with what himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was god doing listen did you ever think what the offices of the church is it is god's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a tea a seer foresee before satan ever gets to it then told it what is his god dressed up in his church these offices is god's dress wear when you see those offices of pastors teachers evangelists what is that that's god's dress where god's presence god's spirit working through man now he said if that man denies any of the words you know that ain't god because god cannot deny himself but now notice here again you know there there it was i'm just reading about joshua going into the land how did he do it put the word on the shoulder of the levites and let him lead the way amen put the word let the word go before you let the preachers carry the word and you follow the word and the waters are going to open now the other day did you know hamas fired over 4 000 rockets at jewish communities but over there in their little control centers israeli women soldiers i kind of like it women soldiers not that i'm far women going to war but just equating this taking women soldiers and they sit at ease with a button release and they release powerful missiles to shoot down the incumbent missiles of the enemy and it produces a shield of protection against the enemy and when you get this little woman soldier come on this little bride of christ you get her sitting behind the word amen and in prayer there she's releasing the missiles against the attacks of the enemy it produces a shield of blood a shield of protection against the enemy [Applause] god is equipped as people with powerful weapons so that even the weakest among us are able to shoot down the missiles that satan continually launches and we're not just dodging missiles but this victorious bride is taking back her land amen that which was hours before satan's attack in the garden of eden i want to say oh what a warrior our god is he's a warrior god spiritual israel is under attack also everywhere she's under attack but our god's word is a perfect missile destroyer and no weapon can you hear me no weapon let him go get satan's best let him try something new let him come from another direction amen but no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper less is the heritage of the saints of god [Applause] what is the fight over why in the world i mean you know people are saying well why won't big old israel leave poor old palestinians alone what is a fight over well let me just say here back in in in in the 1940s the united nation gave the largest part of israel to trans jordan including half half of of of jerusalem actually they had all of jerusalem until they took it half of it from them but the palestinians don't want that land they want what israel is living on although they gave the majority of the nation the land that belonged to israel to the trinity to jordan and made the state of georgia jordan they don't want a place there you see egypt could easily give them a piece of land there but they don't want that land they want what israel has what is the fight over you may wonder what in the world is the fight over and i just tell you it's because satan wants the place where god has chosen to put his name now and where is that it's jerusalem start this for me or what i have to do oh she starts it i wanted to show you a few little things here and and i wish the people online could see this too i don't know how that can happen but i want you to see this you see the fight is over where god has chosen to put his name and first kings 11 36 jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there [Music] so this is where that that at one time all men were to come to jerusalem to worship this was a place of sacrifice amen now there there is a scripture in the bible that is called deshima and it is it is the scripture of deuteronomy uh 6 and 4 that says hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and literally that means jehovah our god is one jehovah there's never two jehovahs there's no no not jehovah god there's not god the father and god the son and god the holy ghost there is one jehovah and he became in his sonship but created a body and father to body and kind of lived in it and his name was a given name it was given by the angel himself his name shall be called jesus which is jehovah the savior for he will save his people from their sins so this time jehovah is coming as a man he's coming to fight human battles he's the lord of glory he's the man of war he has been fighting for the people but he's coming now to take on flesh to fight it in human battles to defeat sin and darkness for them so you see the words the word here in there the word hero israel it begins hero israel this becomes the word shema oh there's a whole sermon maybe i'll preach on it one day i've got some notes put away on being the ability to hear but shema means to hear hear o israel the lord thy god is one lord or the lord your jehovah is our god is one jehovah the lord if you see it in all caps when you see that that's jehovah in the king james now so this first verse of the shema this is called the shema hero israel the lord thy god is one lord or jehovah god is one jehovah now jehovah's witnesses and some message revisionists say that jesus was not god shame on them most post-catholic denominations including the catholics believes that jesus is just a second person of the trinity of gods one god in three persons or three persons of one god that is a roman catholic invention here it comes back hero israel the lord our god is one lord he's not two lords he is one lord jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new that is the direct revelation that is given to you in this day to destroy the devil with that first of all you know who your god is he amen you you know some people have said who do i pray to god the father god the son or god the holy ghost or do i give them equal time you know when you realize that here that it's one god one lord one faith one baptism amen that so it takes away the pluralities of god and shows that god is one god now so this jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new jehovah the savior of the new same god who is manifested in the pillar fire who is the same god who came flesh and went back to the pillar of fire i came from god the pillar fire i returned back to the pillar of fire when the pillar of fire is asked who he is i am jesus now again that is my name that is who i am i am jehovah the savior now ages ago ages ago the hebrew children chose the letter sheen to represent the unspeakable name of the one and only god kind of looks like a little bit like our letter w so this letter became to represent you know of all of the hebrew alphabet which happens to be the 21st letter of the hebrew alphabet there are they are here uh to make 21st there has to be three sevens seven is completion and god is complete in sevens and perfected in threes so it's not three persons but it's three manifestations of the same person so if you look there that is not three three distinct letters that is one letter with three different strokes of manifestation so now again you know keeping that in mind that you know keeping that in mind now here's what we want to show you here on this because this is beautiful that right here i've got a map of jerusalem and and in in what makes up jerusalem here is three distinct valleys very significant valleys within the city of jerusalem and one of them runs through the middle of the old city is the kindred violin there's the hennen valley in the tyropian valley these three valleys here are there in in jerusalem and i i want you just to see here that when you lay the letter when you lay the letter over there of the name of god that represents the name of god right in jerusalem is the shima or the sheen which is the the 21st letter representing god and it is shown here in the three valleys that make up jerusalem god literally remember when he formed the world he took his finger and he marked right here and he put with his finger there and he marked out valleys that would symbolize the name of god here is where and all the earth i put in my name now this is incredible as you think of it because again that the very city has upon it the name of god now watch this city also has three mountain heads this city has to see the zion ophel and moriah those are the three mountain heads there and it represents again one god in three different manifestations not not it's it's not three cities it's one god now notice again as we we look at it before the full revelation of the new testament the revealing of christ these names were already given to the mountain heads this isn't a recent conv invention but i want you to notice in the first one is ophel which in hebrew means my fortress my tower my stronghold this is who god was known in the old testament god above us was known as the fortress the tower and the stronghold he is a fail are you with me the lord is my rock jehovah is my rock my fortress my deliverer my god my strength and whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower so this mountain here is one of the one of the the peaks are the mountain heads of the same mountain also on that mountain is a mount moriah it's called moriah in its peak and it's mountain head moriah we know is the place where way before then god sent abraham out with isaac to offer him he had to go was it three days journey something like that to go there god it wasn't just any place he wanted him at a certain place and he saw the place from afar off no doubt he had seen it by vision and he carries with him his son and he's going to offer his only son remember he you know ishmael has been sent away and now isaac is his only son in fact this is the only son god ever recognized he never recognized this mill at all he said to abraham take thine only son because the child of the bomb's woman is not to be heir with the free woman neither is the child of denomination to be heir with the bride she's a child of the bones woman are you with me now in hebrew the name moriah means to see god now let's stop here for a minute let's look here what happened here again abraham goes up this mountain his son is packing the wood just like jesus will pack his cross and man many many years later amen because god is acting out listen he needs somebody you think it's cruel god say go slay your son and god don't even slay your son but he's going to have god don't even receive human sacrifice is what i'm meant to say but he said go and sacrifice his son i've got to have a type i've got to have something to foreshadow this and you are the beloved father and now you have a son of the promise because it's a miraculous son that after sarah could not conceive i gave you a child so it's the son of the spoken word and i changed your body in order i is the son of the miraculous it's the son of the word now won't you there take him up there now he gets up there and he said here's the word here's the fire where's the sacrifice abraham said the lord wills provide the sacrifice he lays them there upon the altar and it was there that god spared isaac and revealed the lamb a ram that was tied in the thicket by his horns is that right showing us we should have been the one who died but god took our place by becoming the lamb are you with me now so he takes and he types all of this out and and he calls this jehovah jireh this mount jehovah torah the lord himself will provide a sacrifice or in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and i want you to know mariah is important because mariah here is expressing something very great it means to seek god or to be seen of god and it was in jesus christ in his manifestation of sonship that we saw god and that man was able to look god in the face thomas would be able to kneel before him and say my lord and my god amen there they they would recognize him as jehovah himself come on somebody because of moriah it was where god was seen come on now amen and where we see god face to face man to man and that is where god is with us so you have awful which means god god above us my fortress my high tower amen now you have moriah which in hebrew means to be seen of god or seen of god where god was seen among men hallelujah god with us amen now the last one here is zion the last of this mountain head is zion and it means the mark of the sign the pillow the pillar and you know what if ephesians 1 13 says that after we believe we are sealed or we're marked with the seal of the holy spirit and because it's the mark of every born-again believer so god in us so he places his name in jerusalem and and again it's it's all foul god in his fatherhood moriah god and his sonship zion god in us the holy spirit not three gods but one god amen and his name is placed there and the only name that is given unto man where by men might be saved is the name jesus who came in his father's name so the father's name was jesus the son's name is jesus and the holy ghost name is jesus and there ain't three of them there's one amen now there you are so this is what all that fuss is about that's right we want the place where god puts his name can i have just a little more time okay well you know okay i know i'm guilty i i preach a button sermon every once in a while i'm hoping it won't be a button sermon this morning but i want you just to see hear what all the what is all the fight about what what is our battle about in second thessalonians two and three let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there cometh fallen away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called god or that is worship so that he is god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god so here again we see the very the very plan of the antichrist and that is to be sitting in the temple being worshipped as god i want that place of worship you see it's supposed to be in christ but i want it for myself this is where it happens this is where organization starts up that's why we got 45 million today organizations denominations is because in every one of them every little man wants to be god now so he says i will be worshiped i will have preeminence remember this whole thing of christ is a mystery when god can get preeminence in a people and now here's the fight colossians 1 and 18 and he is the head of the church or the body the church who is the head the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence so the battle is all about satanic preeminence trying to keep you from your sonship so now what was the fall in heaven satan wanted preeminence over the sons of god he wanted worship what was the fall in the garden god in his word was to have preeminence is that right and satan uses a serpent to get headship and preeminence over the eve and thus he got headship over adam and he took positions over the sons of god amen and we were everyone born in this condition we were born dead to god in the lives of sin when you turn with me to ephesians 2 and 1 and you at to quicken that means he made you alive because you were actually born your first time dead you were dead to god and allowed to sin you were dead in your trespasses and sins where in times past you you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our conversation or our conduct in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the atmospheres that ruled over us made us do it we were the children of wrath even as others but oh i'm glad there's a bud here but god who is rich in mercy amen for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin he hath quickened us or made us alive together with christ resurrected us with him for by grace you were saved and his raises up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus so he has enthroned us with christ this is our real position his grace gives us a seat of dominion enthroned with christ over the desires of the flesh the lust of the flesh and desires of the mind the changing of our atmosphere being from sin with its doubt and unbelief so what is the physical fight over let's go back and look at israel for a moment israel they are the original owners given by god to possess the land nobody else is god ever give that land to muslims catholics baptists you know greek orthodox all of them that's got their little churches built here and there and it's quieting down on holy places it is not theirs amen israel are the original owners given by god to possess that land and you look at the history the bible proves it the dead sea scrolls reveal it and they show israelis israel's ownership of the land let me just say it this way the jews controlled jerusalem 1500 years until about 70 uh 70 a.d that rome took it and they controlled it to 600 a.d then the muslims could took control holding it to 1100 a.d and then from 1100 um to 1250 the crusaders with the christians attempted to take control back from the muslim and the power shift back and forth in 1250 muslim turks gained control into 1917. so in 1917 the british gained control so when you hear of the ishmaelites the children of the bombs woman laying claim to the land and the city in the natural that's the muslims in the spiritual that's the catholic and protestants did not nomination all of them lay and claim to be the place where god chose to put his name that they own jerusalem and it's here all men have to come to worship if you ain't with us you're lost that's the spirit of denomination i'm allergic to it you ought to be too but i want you to know they're not people of the book they are squatters on the lamb all of them romans were squatters come on amen the others were squatters all of them were squad the catholics have been squatters uh crusaders were squatters the irons have been squatters none of them are owners there's only one owner and that's the people of the book and i want to just tell you you know other people they may they claim to healing or deliverance or this or that yet but you're the owner that is your inheritance you have first claim on it you have first claim on every gift you have every first claim on every promise you have first claim on the baptism of the holy ghost you have first claim of divine healing you have first claim on any promise of the word of god it's yours first because you were there first that was you and david that was you there come on you're not a kamala that was you there that was you fighting over in delaware that was you there that was you with washington that was you brother adam was telling us that was you i was there i was there and he said to be a christian i was there that was me and david fighting goliath that's me today i'll fight my goliath amen that was me and moses i held the rod of the name of jesus and i'll take that rod today and i'll defeat it into me i'll call down heaven and strike the enemy till he's dead dead dead until he lets our people go that's me hallelujah that was me and daniel who said shut up the words until the last day and i'm here daniel i'm here to pick up where you left off because again michael has stood up the lamb has stood up the mighty angel has put his feet on the land of the sea and i'm here it's my hour it's my time it's my day it's my moment and that was me i have a claim to this land i have the claim for my children that's what the promise is unto them and to them that are far even as many as the lord our god shall call hallelujah i have a promise for divine healing it's just as real today as it ever was because i served jehovah that i am god it's mine praise god it's mine and i'm going to just say they're not people of the book we're the people of the book our names are written we've been revealed in that book and that day everyone should be delivered whose names are written in the book and mama that's me i see that when the seals come open i saw my name that's my identity i know who my god is i know my father i know where i come from i know where i'm going [Music] and i was surely in jesus christ when he defeated hell i was in him there you realize the bride had not been separated from the groom yet and when he went down to hell come on somebody amen i went there with him when he died i died with him when he rose i rose with him when he ascended i ascended with him i am there with him enthroned as a son of god i know my position i know my place and that's what the battles my land oh it's now it's not very much it's just one book in the massive world of man's literature but this is not man's literature this is god's literature they can lay claim on darwin you can have him amen come on they can lay claims on the edicts of the popes you can have them that's your land have it have at it enjoy it but this is my land it's not muslim land first of all muhammad never visited jerusalem you see islam landed in that land 2600 years after the jews were founded by abraham two thousand years after joshua established the nation of israel sixteen hundred years after david made jerusalem the capital of israel 600 years after christianity was founded there and the islamic dome of the rock is was not built on the temple mount until 687 a.d long long after solomon put the temple there the jewish temple was there long before the islamic dome of the rock laid claim to that land it's not theirs it was a place where god chose to put his name and where the blood was accepted to take away sin for the meeting place is where the blood is there's where we're going to stop this morning because i want you to see the battle that we're in is over your possession of your promise and the higher you go in god the more you go to take your position the more you're going to be opposed by demon spirits some of you have made peace with the devil you're contempt to stay where you are you've traded a lot of land for peace you're willing to give up promises so he'll leave you alone you're real you're willing to be slacker and laodicea and have an apathetic view because you've never been revealed that you have acclaim to the land when i trace my genealogy back i'll trace it all the way to the pilgrim fathers when i signed up into ancestry.com i even can trace it back to the cherokees when they owned the land that predated the white settlers when i look into my genealogy i can go back and i can see my seventh great-grandmother was john adams sister and she was an aunt to john quincy adams i'm american that's who i am i have a vested interest in this land my people fought wars in this land to have the freedoms we have today that's me as an american but i want to tell you something as a child of god you have a greater inheritance than that you have a vested interest in every promise jesus is yours yes he's yours let the musicians come amen i i'll tell you if i go to preaching again it'll be a button sermon amen oh god help us today let's look at the promise of god amen a little sister come one time when i was preaching a meeting and she said brother tim said i left you some candies on the desk today so i left you some candies on the desk you know so you won't preach so long you know the little story you know the preacher was going to preach a long time and he got or he he had preached a long time and and they the deacons called him in and said well why did you preach so long say well sir said i always put a little mint in my mouth there and when that candy's gone i know it's time to quit but today i reached in my pocket and i got a button she laid those two pieces of candy up and i said oh wonderful i got one piece of candy is one hour and two pieces of candy for two hours i can do it don't you love the lord today amen what a freedom we have in jesus
