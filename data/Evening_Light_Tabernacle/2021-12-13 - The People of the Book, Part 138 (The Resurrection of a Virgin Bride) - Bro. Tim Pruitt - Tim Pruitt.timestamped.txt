[45:54] amen

[46:12] amen thank you amen let's turn to
[46:14] ephesians chapter 5 and verse 22 and
[46:18] i ask for your prayers today i hope you
[46:21] have been praying for me
[46:23] as we approach the services that we can
[46:26] you know find the very mind of god and
[46:29] to
[46:30] speak on some things there's some things
[46:32] here that
[46:33] i have
[46:35] been pondering on and thinking about and
[46:37] actually
[46:38] has been laying in my heart for now for
[46:41] probably the last year
[46:43] or better
[46:45] and um
[46:46] and and actually i could actually go
[46:49] back to the starting of this series on
[46:51] the people of the book
[46:53] and even some of the prayers that i
[46:54] prayed while i was is at israel and at
[46:57] shiloh
[46:58] and i'm praying for
[47:01] the barren women the barren church
[47:04] and um because there's got to be
[47:06] somebody
[47:07] in this day that brings forth jesus
[47:09] christ back to the earth
[47:12] we have perpetuated
[47:14] the ages as it was coming down through
[47:16] seven we can't go any further
[47:19] there's no more
[47:20] and you know some will say well we're
[47:22] now in in the bright age the this
[47:25] laodicean age
[47:26] is the bright age that's what the
[47:28] message produced was a bright age
[47:31] a place where
[47:32] there will be a bride without spot or
[47:35] wrinkle or blemish
[47:36] so ephesians 5 22 is where we'll begin
[47:40] reading this morning
[47:42] and um
[47:43] so we will speak some things today
[47:46] and i i don't want to just come across
[47:49] harsh or dogmatic or
[47:51] as you know some vindictive way
[47:54] i want to say a lot some things in the
[47:56] spirit of love but um
[47:58] i i pray that
[48:00] that the love of god will help correct
[48:03] us and keep us on
[48:04] on the straight and narrow path as the
[48:06] body of christ
[48:08] i speak to you as a congregation and i
[48:11] speak to those around the world who are
[48:13] listening in as well
[48:15] and maybe the bride of christ wherever
[48:17] you are
[48:18] be touched today by the word ephesians
[48:21] chapter 5 verse 22 wives submit
[48:24] yourselves to your own husbands
[48:26] as unto the lord for as the husband is
[48:28] ahead of the wife even as christ is the
[48:31] head of the church and he is the savior
[48:33] of the body
[48:35] therefore is the church is subject unto
[48:37] christ so let the wives be to their own
[48:40] husbands and everything
[48:42] husbands love your wives even as christ
[48:45] also love the church
[48:47] and gave himself for it
[48:50] notice now
[48:51] the purpose of him giving himself his
[48:54] own blood
[48:55] shedding his life
[48:57] dying on the cross
[48:59] was that he might
[49:00] sanctify and cleanse it
[49:03] with the washing of the water by the
[49:06] word
[49:07] that he might present it to himself
[49:10] a glorious church not having a spot or
[49:13] wrinkle
[49:14] or any such thing
[49:16] but that it should be holy and without
[49:19] blemish
[49:20] so i want men to love their wives as
[49:22] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[49:25] loveth himself god bless you you can be
[49:28] seated
[49:30] i'm going to be speaking today on the
[49:33] resurrection
[49:34] of a virgin bride
[49:37] and we're going to
[49:39] we're going to deal quite a bit with the
[49:42] virginity of the church
[49:44] and what she has been
[49:47] prepared
[49:49] and called for
[49:51] in this age in this time
[49:53] now in the beginning god created the
[49:56] heavens and the earth
[49:58] and god had a very special reason and
[50:01] purpose for the earth
[50:03] and that was that he might put his life
[50:07] upon it
[50:09] and in fact the matter is it would be
[50:12] that heaven would come down in the form
[50:14] of a paradise and
[50:16] and there god would reproduce himself
[50:20] in his sonship and was in a son of god
[50:23] which would be in his likeness so we
[50:26] could look upon the earth that god
[50:28] created the earth as a womb where god's
[50:32] seed could be manifested
[50:35] within the earth god by his word he
[50:37] planted seeds of life
[50:39] he commanded let the earth
[50:42] bring forth grass and their herb
[50:44] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[50:47] yielding fruit after its kind whose seed
[50:49] is in itself upon the earth
[50:51] and it was so
[50:53] and he brought up bird life animal life
[50:56] and told each to be fruitful and
[50:58] multiply and and uh and the womb of the
[51:01] earth again brought forth life
[51:05] and then he brooded upon the earth and
[51:07] brought
[51:08] as we said heaven down to earth in as a
[51:11] eden a paradise
[51:14] and god ultimately brought a man in his
[51:17] own image
[51:19] from the dust
[51:20] from the womb of the earth
[51:22] and this man was made to portray god's
[51:26] image and his likeness
[51:29] so you know so then that he would
[51:32] prograde god's image and likeness
[51:35] he
[51:36] god had a a
[51:38] a bigger plan than just adam and eve but
[51:41] he
[51:42] wanted a family
[51:44] these were to be the first
[51:46] of a of a race of a god race
[51:50] and of course we we know in order to do
[51:53] this
[51:54] that uh god would not only
[51:57] want to
[51:58] express himself and
[52:00] and his fatherhood
[52:02] but he would also want to express
[52:04] himself in his sonship
[52:06] and so you know as he did he would make
[52:10] man to portray god's image and his
[52:14] likeness
[52:15] so
[52:16] then and then and portraying his
[52:18] likeness i want to get this thought to
[52:21] you that out of this man
[52:24] would come a woman
[52:26] and and as the earth was to be the womb
[52:30] for seeds of life so was the woman to be
[52:35] the womb for life
[52:37] but there was another suitor as you know
[52:40] in the story of redemption
[52:43] a deceiver a slicker who also he wanted
[52:46] a wound
[52:48] you see he wanted to be god and he
[52:50] wanted to be worshipped also
[52:52] and he wanted to reproduce himself but
[52:57] having no life within himself he could
[52:59] only do this by a perverted life by
[53:02] perverting the life that god had already
[53:04] placed upon the earth
[53:06] and so he doesn't work on me you know go
[53:09] and start working on mars and juniper
[53:12] or um our jupiter or our venus or some
[53:17] metal planet or universes that are
[53:20] billions and billions of light years
[53:22] away as they tell us they are he began
[53:24] to work right here upon the earth
[53:28] because here he was going to work and
[53:32] and tried to get the womb of the earth
[53:35] to bring forth a perverted life his own
[53:38] life
[53:40] and and so sin would enter into the
[53:43] earth by
[53:45] perversion and that would be by
[53:47] perverting the word of god by getting
[53:50] a god's
[53:52] son and daughter to doubt god's promise
[53:55] in god's word
[53:57] now sin or unbelief is the seed of the
[54:00] old serpent
[54:02] it is unbelief
[54:04] unbelief is the word
[54:06] perverted changed into lie
[54:09] and from sin would come every kind of
[54:12] heartache
[54:13] adultery and fornication and cleanliness
[54:16] and lasciviousness and idolatry and
[54:19] witchcraft and hatred and variance and
[54:22] emulation and wrath and strife and
[54:25] seditions and heresies and envy and
[54:28] murders and drunken and
[54:30] rebellions
[54:32] and so you know from
[54:34] and from eve's womb
[54:37] now this this womb that god would give
[54:40] adam to to bring forth a life from
[54:44] which would come by the spoken word and
[54:47] then
[54:48] you know would again what the dust would
[54:50] be
[54:51] formed around it like jesus was in the
[54:54] dust of mary's womb
[54:57] but cain
[54:58] you know from that from um eve's womb
[55:01] would now come
[55:02] not just
[55:04] the the life but a perverted life
[55:07] and that provided life would come from a
[55:10] perverted word
[55:12] and and cain was of that wicked one and
[55:14] then of course from there would also
[55:16] come abel
[55:18] and and then
[55:20] abel would be killed by cain and then
[55:22] south would be raised up in abel's place
[55:26] and out of these two now
[55:28] cane
[55:29] the seed of the serpent the bible said
[55:31] he was of that wicked one and and then
[55:35] seth who was of the lineage of
[55:39] of adam here would come two
[55:41] separate peoples
[55:44] and they would have two very separate
[55:46] genealogies
[55:48] and they would be kept apart
[55:50] by god
[55:52] but then in noah's day these two races
[55:55] identified as cain's children the sons
[55:57] of men
[55:58] and seth's children the sons of god
[56:01] would mix and meld together
[56:04] and this would bring an evil to its
[56:07] heights
[56:08] in the days of noah and it would cause
[56:11] god to destroy the earth with the flood
[56:15] and from there god would
[56:17] he would have to start all over
[56:20] and of course the earth would go through
[56:22] his first stage of redemption which
[56:24] would be a baptism with water
[56:27] and and god would begin to seek a godly
[56:31] seed
[56:33] and he would call a man by the name of
[56:35] abraham
[56:37] and out of abraham
[56:39] of course would come a woman
[56:42] and that would be israel
[56:44] and israel would be the womb
[56:47] from which would bring the man seed
[56:50] jesus christ are you following me
[56:53] are you with me now so because again god
[56:57] would need a womb to bring forth his son
[57:02] he would need an earth as a womb to
[57:04] bring forth life
[57:06] amen he would you know adam would need a
[57:10] womb to bring forth to life
[57:13] to reproduce
[57:15] again again
[57:17] we would see that the serpent would need
[57:19] a womb also
[57:21] and he would come with a perverted seed
[57:24] in order to bring forth a perverted life
[57:28] now so so again now god begins to work
[57:32] because he still has in his mind to
[57:34] bring forth a messiah
[57:37] to bring forth a second adam to bring
[57:40] forth one in his image
[57:42] to again have a god race
[57:45] and that is not mixed up but something
[57:48] that is
[57:50] is pure and sinless and perfect there's
[57:54] somebody with me now
[57:56] and so god would call abraham
[57:59] and out of for the purpose out of
[58:01] abraham that would come a
[58:04] woman and out of that woman israel that
[58:08] would come a messiah
[58:10] now and so a nation would rise now
[58:13] sarah would portray
[58:15] um israel
[58:17] as a
[58:18] because she would be a very old woman
[58:21] when this when this seed would come
[58:23] forth
[58:24] and you know that that um and this old
[58:27] woman israel
[58:28] and and and stay with me just a minute
[58:30] kind of follow my line of thinking this
[58:33] old woman israel who after turning
[58:35] returning from babylon she would be
[58:38] renewed
[58:39] like sarah was of old in order to bring
[58:42] forth the man child the messiah
[58:45] and then out of that seed
[58:48] christ out of that seed christ
[58:52] he would have a woman
[58:54] he would produce a womb that he could
[58:57] reproduce himself
[59:00] the church and this church is to be bone
[59:02] of his bone and flesh of his flesh and
[59:06] power his power and life of his life
[59:10] now this woman israel was to be a womb
[59:12] that god could bring forth his likeness
[59:16] the second adam now we remember that god
[59:20] chose her for a wife
[59:23] she was to be his womb through the seed
[59:26] would come
[59:27] now david would reflect him and isaiah
[59:30] would reflect him but they were not the
[59:32] seed that he had in mind
[59:34] his seed was to bring forth the sun in
[59:36] his own image
[59:38] now and so he there we but he would
[59:41] marry he would marry israel at 50 days
[59:45] after the passover after they left egypt
[59:47] 50 days at the first pentecost there he
[59:50] would covet himself with the woman
[59:53] israel he would become married to her
[59:57] she was to be a womb from which the seed
[1:00:00] would come
[1:00:02] right
[1:00:03] amen but the devil knows this
[1:00:06] and the devil's watching everything that
[1:00:08] he's doing and the devil wants that
[1:00:10] wound too
[1:00:13] to bring forth his own perverted life
[1:00:15] from
[1:00:16] so he's followed right along to bring
[1:00:18] his perversion
[1:00:20] remember the true spirits will be so
[1:00:22] close in the last day it would deceive
[1:00:25] the very elect if it were possible
[1:00:28] that was how they intertwined all the
[1:00:31] way down we could go down to the twins
[1:00:33] starting in heaven michael and lucifer
[1:00:36] the twins on earth
[1:00:38] which which was the which was the
[1:00:41] serpent
[1:00:42] a man like creature and adam then the
[1:00:45] twins that followed there a cane and an
[1:00:48] abel the twins that would come forth
[1:00:50] there in abraham's day two sons you know
[1:00:54] ishmael a wild seed and the m and isaac
[1:00:58] the true seed the seed of the promise
[1:01:00] the seed of faith and then we could go
[1:01:02] right on down and we could look at a
[1:01:04] jacob and an esau more twins again and
[1:01:08] on down and off because every revival
[1:01:10] produces twins and don't forget
[1:01:13] that this revival also
[1:01:15] will produce twins
[1:01:17] [Applause]
[1:01:20] because satan is looking for the womb
[1:01:24] to try to bring forth
[1:01:27] his own life
[1:01:30] a perverted life
[1:01:32] a perverted message
[1:01:35] a perverted christianity
[1:01:39] now
[1:01:41] so god would take this woman israel
[1:01:44] out of here whom he had called as a
[1:01:47] nation
[1:01:48] and he would remind her in
[1:01:51] and i believe this is in ezekiel 16
[1:01:54] where he would remind her yes in ezekiel
[1:01:57] 16 he would remind israel how he called
[1:02:00] her from the heathens
[1:02:03] am i'm saying that birth that nativity
[1:02:06] of of what was of the land of canaan and
[1:02:09] that father it was an amorite and a
[1:02:11] mother a hittite
[1:02:12] and he tells of of of her
[1:02:16] how he called her out
[1:02:18] of the heathens
[1:02:20] to be a people unto himself to be a
[1:02:22] virgin woman
[1:02:24] to be a church that would be a womb to
[1:02:27] him that he could bring forth his life
[1:02:30] amen because it had become one the
[1:02:33] serpent bruiser who would bruise the
[1:02:35] head of the serpent
[1:02:37] and it would have to come through a
[1:02:38] virgin
[1:02:40] now as an infant nation with starting
[1:02:43] with abraham isaac and jacob and his
[1:02:46] twelve sons god would care for her
[1:02:50] as a he and described her finding her
[1:02:52] like an abandoned child and whose navel
[1:02:56] was not cut or none pity dim
[1:02:59] well and
[1:03:00] and was rejected it was as a rejected
[1:03:03] unwanted
[1:03:05] infant cast into an open field
[1:03:09] and he said nobody wanted you you know
[1:03:11] you would have died out there
[1:03:13] you'd have never survived i called you
[1:03:16] out of the heathen and you'd have never
[1:03:18] made it
[1:03:20] but i come along and i pitied you
[1:03:23] amen i passed by you ezekiel 16 6 when i
[1:03:27] passed by you and i saw thee polluted in
[1:03:30] thine own blood i said unto thee when
[1:03:32] thou was in thy blood live
[1:03:35] yea i said unto thee when thou would
[1:03:37] send thine own blood
[1:03:40] you see it was the word
[1:03:42] that came from god that gave them life
[1:03:47] amen it was that word that protected
[1:03:50] them it was that word that sustained
[1:03:53] them when they were an infant nation
[1:03:56] amen at the end and he gave them life
[1:03:59] because he breathed upon them when they
[1:04:02] were when they were an infant dying
[1:04:05] abandoned unwanted people and god called
[1:04:10] her out of the of the nations
[1:04:14] amen out of the heathen remember
[1:04:16] remember abraham was a gentile
[1:04:19] remember he was a heathen
[1:04:23] amen remember he had to be taught about
[1:04:25] one god he had to be taught how to
[1:04:28] worship
[1:04:30] remember he he was and there in their
[1:04:33] infancy god watched over him god looked
[1:04:36] after him god carried him he called him
[1:04:39] out
[1:04:40] to make him a people for his namesake
[1:04:46] and they grew into a nation
[1:04:48] and ezekiel 16 7 said i caused thee to
[1:04:52] multiply as the blood of the field
[1:04:55] and thou hast increased in wax and great
[1:04:58] and our come to excellent ornaments that
[1:05:01] breast are fastened the hair is grown
[1:05:04] worrying that was naked and bare in
[1:05:06] other words i watched you mature
[1:05:09] i watched you grow up
[1:05:11] and and and he says where you were naked
[1:05:15] and bear yeah i swear to thee
[1:05:18] and i entered into a covenant
[1:05:21] i entered into a covenant with thee
[1:05:23] saith the lord and thou became as mine
[1:05:27] notice what he said i i found you
[1:05:30] you know and i established you and i
[1:05:32] called you out of the people to be mine
[1:05:36] amen and then i waited to you grow up
[1:05:39] until you matured and i was good won't
[1:05:42] take you for pride and i entered into a
[1:05:44] covenant with you i swore to you and i
[1:05:48] you became mine
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:52] why because god wanted her as a womb to
[1:05:56] bring forth himself
[1:05:58] to bring forth his own life
[1:06:01] amen
[1:06:02] now ezekiel goes on to talk about her
[1:06:06] how she became rich then
[1:06:08] and a great nation
[1:06:11] self-assured and self-independent
[1:06:15] no longer needed to rely upon god and
[1:06:18] wanted to be like the other nations and
[1:06:21] became a horus woman
[1:06:26] in jeremiah 3 he spoke of her
[1:06:29] as one who became a polluted woman
[1:06:32] she played the harlot
[1:06:34] with many lovers and polluted the line
[1:06:36] with her whoredoms yet he pleaded with
[1:06:39] her eternal backsliding children
[1:06:42] saith the lord for i am married to you
[1:06:46] and i'll take you one of a city and two
[1:06:48] of a family and i'll bring you to zion
[1:06:51] and i i will restore i i'm married to
[1:06:55] you i i want to restore you
[1:06:58] she's carried off to babylon
[1:07:00] and god brought her back why why did god
[1:07:03] do all of that
[1:07:04] why would he go and and
[1:07:07] seemingly waste all the effort on a
[1:07:09] nation that had been taken away as
[1:07:11] slaves into a foreign land what not
[1:07:14] forget about him like all the other
[1:07:16] philistines disappeared
[1:07:19] amen all the other nations disappeared
[1:07:22] they got swallowed up in the sword but
[1:07:24] but why israel
[1:07:26] why was israel restored why did god work
[1:07:29] upon her he needed a worm
[1:07:32] to blame for this offspring
[1:07:35] and finally from a remnant of israel
[1:07:38] within that nation
[1:07:40] there came a virtuous woman
[1:07:43] i want to get this to you for a moment a
[1:07:45] virtuous woman a virtuous church
[1:07:48] who we could give his seed
[1:07:51] we know
[1:07:52] we know the names of some of that virgin
[1:07:55] church
[1:07:56] there was simeon
[1:07:58] anna
[1:07:59] elizabeth zachariah mary joseph
[1:08:04] just to name a few and there was others
[1:08:07] who were waiting for the consolation of
[1:08:10] israel there was more than them there
[1:08:12] were unnamed peoples called shepherds
[1:08:15] in the field to whom god the angels of
[1:08:18] god could appear to
[1:08:21] are you with me amen and it would be to
[1:08:23] this little virgin group of believers
[1:08:27] that the word would come
[1:08:29] amen that the message would come
[1:08:32] amen here again the message would come
[1:08:35] which would be glory to god in the
[1:08:38] highest at peace on earth and my good
[1:08:41] will toward man here i am i found the
[1:08:45] people
[1:08:46] hallelujah that has the faith to bring
[1:08:49] forth the messiah
[1:08:51] i found a virgin's woman amen more than
[1:08:55] virgin mary but a virgin church died of
[1:08:58] her could come and deliver
[1:09:05] now to this little virgin group of
[1:09:07] believers
[1:09:08] came the word to seed
[1:09:11] a man child that was born of the virgin
[1:09:15] god took on flesh
[1:09:18] so that out of christ now really
[1:09:20] remember
[1:09:21] he has a purpose of bringing the man
[1:09:23] forth
[1:09:24] just like he had a purpose to bring
[1:09:26] abraham
[1:09:27] it was so that out of him would come a
[1:09:30] woman a womb
[1:09:32] there was adam in the beginning but out
[1:09:34] of him would come a woman a womb
[1:09:38] somebody followed me
[1:09:40] amen so now again he would do the same
[1:09:43] he would have a church
[1:09:46] and she would bring forth
[1:09:48] all what all the scriptures what all the
[1:09:51] prophecies had prophesied what david had
[1:09:54] prophesied jeremiah isaiah ezekiel what
[1:09:58] sarah typed out what esther every one of
[1:10:01] them was pointing to this messiah
[1:10:06] jesus would be the fulfillment in the
[1:10:08] embodiment of every word of promise
[1:10:11] that would be manifested in a little
[1:10:13] small
[1:10:14] virgin group of people
[1:10:16] who would receive a messiah the man
[1:10:19] child
[1:10:22] but his whole purpose
[1:10:24] of bringing him forth
[1:10:26] was that out of him
[1:10:28] would come a womb
[1:10:29] a woman
[1:10:31] a church
[1:10:34] which he could bring forth himself
[1:10:37] his offspring
[1:10:39] more of the god race
[1:10:41] than jesus
[1:10:43] are you with me now
[1:10:45] so dare put him in to sleep as he did
[1:10:48] adam
[1:10:50] out of christ would come the elements to
[1:10:52] make a bride water
[1:10:54] blood
[1:10:55] and spirit
[1:10:57] so that a church a womb could be born
[1:11:00] that could reproduce him
[1:11:03] and on the day of pentecost in the upper
[1:11:05] room he coveted in marriage this church
[1:11:10] she was a virgin
[1:11:13] untouched by man
[1:11:15] a pure virtuous church
[1:11:18] and now i can say she was without a spot
[1:11:20] or wrinkle
[1:11:22] amen and paul paul is clear paul is
[1:11:25] clear about this woman he said she is a
[1:11:28] virtuous church
[1:11:30] hey man she is a church listen let me
[1:11:33] tell you something friends
[1:11:35] if there wasn't lord to be manifested if
[1:11:37] god had wanted her just for another womb
[1:11:40] for more to come
[1:11:41] are you with me they could have been
[1:11:43] raptured back then
[1:11:46] they were a seed church they were mature
[1:11:48] church
[1:11:50] hallelujah and paul is clear about what
[1:11:53] happened with eve in the garden and used
[1:11:56] it to foretell what would happen in the
[1:11:58] church he said now he says here we got a
[1:12:02] virtuous church
[1:12:03] a spotless church
[1:12:05] amen she don't have any false doctrines
[1:12:09] there's nothing sealed to her book her
[1:12:11] book isn't close the inheritance is open
[1:12:14] she has the abstract the title
[1:12:17] she's got the correct baptism
[1:12:20] amen she don't have creeds of man
[1:12:22] there's never been a wrong seed ever
[1:12:24] entered her
[1:12:27] she has not perverted she is
[1:12:29] solely belongs to christ
[1:12:36] but
[1:12:37] ii corinthians 11 12
[1:12:40] but
[1:12:41] for i am
[1:12:43] jealous
[1:12:44] over you
[1:12:45] i keep guarding you
[1:12:48] i'm doing everything i can
[1:12:50] you know here
[1:12:51] to keep you
[1:12:53] with jealousy with godly jealousy second
[1:12:56] corinthians 11 2
[1:12:58] amen try to catch these scriptures
[1:13:01] i am jealous over you with godly
[1:13:03] jealousy
[1:13:04] for i've espoused you to one husband
[1:13:07] get this one husband
[1:13:10] a man that i may present you as what
[1:13:14] a chaste a pure virgin to christ
[1:13:19] this is my desire this is what you how
[1:13:22] you must be presented as a chaste virgin
[1:13:25] nothing else will work
[1:13:27] a polluted womb won't work
[1:13:30] amen i've got to have you as a chase
[1:13:33] virgin but i fear
[1:13:36] lest by any means as the serpent be
[1:13:39] godly through his subtlety so
[1:13:42] your mind should be corrupted from the
[1:13:44] simplicity that's in christ
[1:13:47] for he that cometh preaches another
[1:13:49] jesus oh here's another husband
[1:13:53] but he's an imposter
[1:13:55] he's calling himself a savior too
[1:13:59] he's a beguiler
[1:14:01] he's a slicker
[1:14:03] come on whom you is another one that
[1:14:06] preaches another jesus whom i didn't
[1:14:08] preach
[1:14:09] or receive another spirit oh what a
[1:14:12] spirit
[1:14:14] amen which you have not received
[1:14:17] or another gospel oh my goodness another
[1:14:20] gospel
[1:14:22] yeah yeah you know it's going to use the
[1:14:24] same bible
[1:14:26] he's going to use the same words and say
[1:14:29] yeah hath god said
[1:14:33] isn't it written in the bible
[1:14:35] but a twist
[1:14:39] just a little turn just just enough to
[1:14:42] put a doubt there
[1:14:50] another gospel which you have not
[1:14:52] accepted
[1:14:54] you might bear well with him he said i
[1:14:56] i'm afraid you would give him to him
[1:15:00] i'm really concerned about you
[1:15:03] amen now he was jealous of the woman the
[1:15:05] church
[1:15:06] trying to keep you pure for he feared
[1:15:08] she would be corrupted
[1:15:11] lose her virginity
[1:15:13] by receiving another gospel
[1:15:15] a seed from another spirit
[1:15:18] the and the offspring of this church
[1:15:22] instead of being from christ
[1:15:24] would be of that wicked one
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:30] that wicked one would be another jesus
[1:15:35] oh bear in all similarities to this
[1:15:39] using the word too
[1:15:42] coming along talking about the jesus of
[1:15:44] 2000 years ago
[1:15:47] but when you pull the mask off of him
[1:15:50] it's not that jesus
[1:15:53] you're not the same in works the same in
[1:15:55] power
[1:15:56] the same in the holiness he's not there
[1:15:59] are you with me
[1:16:00] and the resume of the church agent
[1:16:02] brother bradham told us with these
[1:16:04] principles of mind we start to trace the
[1:16:06] church to the various seven ages
[1:16:08] the birth of the church was at pentecost
[1:16:11] the first adam was given a bride fresh
[1:16:14] from the hand of god and was undefiled
[1:16:16] for a brief span so was christ the
[1:16:20] second adam given a bribe pure and fresh
[1:16:22] at pentecost and she remains separate
[1:16:25] and undefiled for some time
[1:16:28] and the rest does no man join to them
[1:16:31] acts
[1:16:32] 5-13 and the daily the the lord added
[1:16:36] daily such would be saved acts 2 and 47.
[1:16:39] how long this continued we do not know
[1:16:42] but one day
[1:16:45] even as eve was tempted and seduced by
[1:16:48] satan so the church was contaminated by
[1:16:51] the entrance
[1:16:53] of the antichrist spirit
[1:16:55] so here she was virgin for a time
[1:17:00] come on
[1:17:01] but here comes the entrance now
[1:17:04] of an antichrist spirit
[1:17:07] and this is the spirit first john 4 3.
[1:17:11] this is that spirit of antichrist where
[1:17:14] have you heard that it should come
[1:17:16] even now
[1:17:18] already it is in the world
[1:17:21] so it's already he said
[1:17:23] it's made its entrance
[1:17:25] paul's got a reason to be afraid
[1:17:28] there's another suitor
[1:17:32] amen there's one that's one thing before
[1:17:36] we can consummate it all before we can
[1:17:38] bring an end to all things before we can
[1:17:40] hear it
[1:17:41] there's a suitor coming in and i'm
[1:17:44] warning you
[1:17:46] i'm warning you
[1:17:48] he will have found you
[1:17:52] just like the serpent defiled eve
[1:17:56] and you bring forth out of your womb a
[1:17:58] perverted child
[1:18:04] now
[1:18:06] revelation 2 4 and 5
[1:18:09] i have somewhat against thee he would
[1:18:11] say to them
[1:18:13] because thou has left thy first love
[1:18:15] look the first age they're already
[1:18:17] losing their first love
[1:18:20] remember therefore from once thou art
[1:18:22] fallen and repent so already before the
[1:18:25] church gets out of the first aid she's a
[1:18:27] fallen woman
[1:18:34] the thing that paul fear
[1:18:37] is now already on the church
[1:18:40] and the church is already beginning
[1:18:42] already falling she's already making the
[1:18:45] moves
[1:18:48] now
[1:18:50] the church
[1:18:51] brother branham said was in that first
[1:18:53] stage already a fallen woman
[1:18:56] as satan had got to eve before adam even
[1:18:59] now satan seduced the church the bride
[1:19:01] of christ before the marriage supper of
[1:19:03] the lamb
[1:19:05] amen he promised her
[1:19:08] a marriage supper
[1:19:10] he promised her a new home in the new
[1:19:12] heavens and the new earth
[1:19:14] he promised her a honeymoon of a
[1:19:17] millennial reign
[1:19:18] come on somebody he had given her an
[1:19:21] abstract to the title deed a clear deed
[1:19:24] a perfect word
[1:19:26] to wash her by to keep her clean by
[1:19:30] and my but before the marriage supper
[1:19:33] she got seduced
[1:19:39] now what specifically was in the midst
[1:19:42] it was in her midst that caused the fall
[1:19:45] revelation 2 6
[1:19:47] the deeds of the nicolaitans
[1:19:50] already that first aids had turned from
[1:19:54] following the pure word of god
[1:19:56] they turned from god's demand of a
[1:19:58] church absolutely depended upon him
[1:20:01] dependent entirely upon god to fulfill
[1:20:03] his word from start to finish apart from
[1:20:06] human government to nicolaitanism
[1:20:09] which is organizing a human government
[1:20:12] within the church which is all the
[1:20:14] governments do legislate for the people
[1:20:16] and that's what exactly what they did
[1:20:19] what israel did and they took the
[1:20:20] expediency of human government instead
[1:20:23] of the word in the spirit
[1:20:26] now so in contrast
[1:20:28] to this lovely woman
[1:20:32] the church who is the bride of christ
[1:20:36] now comes in contrast to her strong
[1:20:40] contrast
[1:20:41] is another woman
[1:20:44] this fallen woman
[1:20:46] and she's called the great
[1:20:50] now just as much as there's in the bible
[1:20:53] a pure spotless virgin church
[1:20:57] there is a contaminated defiled horus
[1:21:01] church
[1:21:05] as white and pure as this one is
[1:21:09] without spot or wrinkle without a
[1:21:10] blemish
[1:21:12] there is another woman
[1:21:14] and she is filthy
[1:21:16] lewd
[1:21:17] a drunkard
[1:21:20] amen oh yeah a drunkard
[1:21:22] yet beautifully dressed
[1:21:25] ornate
[1:21:27] oh my she's
[1:21:28] she's affluent she's wealthy
[1:21:32] she's beautiful to look upon but she's a
[1:21:34] murderer
[1:21:37] amen oh brother she's such a murderer
[1:21:40] she'd cut her husband up in three pieces
[1:21:44] make him into three gods
[1:21:47] she's such a murderer she would take
[1:21:49] that physically and would kill 68
[1:21:52] million
[1:21:54] who would dare to disagree with her
[1:21:57] she's ruthless
[1:22:04] speaks of her in revelation 17 as a
[1:22:06] great and she sits upon many
[1:22:10] waters and the waters are symbolic of
[1:22:13] multitudes and nations and people and
[1:22:15] tongues or languages
[1:22:19] she she rules many
[1:22:22] but
[1:22:22] in the world population there's about
[1:22:25] three
[1:22:26] three billion of them
[1:22:30] if you want to know the truth even islam
[1:22:32] is one of her daughters
[1:22:36] amen even brother branham said communism
[1:22:40] is a product
[1:22:42] an offspring of the catholic church
[1:22:45] because of her because of her ways and
[1:22:48] her doings it causes him to rise up this
[1:22:52] woman is so lewd and vulgar
[1:22:55] though she's beautifully dressed and
[1:22:57] purple and scarlet she's wearing gold
[1:23:00] and precious stones and pearls
[1:23:02] but she causes inhabitants of the earth
[1:23:04] to be drunk
[1:23:06] with mind-altering
[1:23:08] wine of abominations and filthiness of
[1:23:12] fornications
[1:23:14] upon her forehead
[1:23:16] was a name written
[1:23:19] mystery babbling to great
[1:23:21] the mother of harlots and abominations
[1:23:24] of the earth
[1:23:26] and then it goes on down and said and i
[1:23:28] saw the woman drunken with the blood of
[1:23:30] the saints with the blood of the martyrs
[1:23:33] of jesus
[1:23:36] amen
[1:23:37] now this woman who is this woman
[1:23:41] she too is a church
[1:23:43] [Music]
[1:23:45] i mean just as paul said
[1:23:47] you know of a church without spot or
[1:23:50] wrinkle or blemish this woman is a
[1:23:52] church and she is she is affluent she
[1:23:55] sits on seven hills she claims she is
[1:23:58] the first
[1:24:00] church are you with me
[1:24:03] amen she sits upon seven hills and
[1:24:05] claims to be the
[1:24:07] first church and she's the mother of the
[1:24:09] rest of the churches
[1:24:12] on record she's killed more than 68
[1:24:14] million of the saints
[1:24:17] and then in revelation 18
[1:24:19] you find an angel declares
[1:24:22] that this mystery woman who models after
[1:24:25] an ancient babylon is fallen
[1:24:29] and she has become the habitation of
[1:24:32] devils
[1:24:34] hey man she is the hold of every foul
[1:24:37] spirit a cage of ever unclean and
[1:24:41] hateful birds
[1:24:44] and then the voice would scream out come
[1:24:47] out of her my people
[1:24:50] am i my people separate yourself
[1:24:54] cut out of her
[1:24:56] amen that's not the unclean thing don't
[1:24:59] be a part of that don't drink our wine
[1:25:03] i've got a people
[1:25:06] even in all of this i'm getting people
[1:25:08] somewhere
[1:25:10] that's going to hear my voice
[1:25:12] amen that will rise up that will be a
[1:25:15] womb that i can bring my life through
[1:25:18] my power can be demonstrated through her
[1:25:21] my glory can be shown upon her
[1:25:24] but my life will radiate through her
[1:25:33] revelation 17 18 gives a
[1:25:36] very sordid picture
[1:25:38] of this sleazy immoral
[1:25:41] foul
[1:25:42] vulgar woman
[1:25:46] the church
[1:25:50] the church
[1:25:52] that would start out like i'll do
[1:25:55] a virgin
[1:26:00] and yet
[1:26:01] she's beautiful now to look home
[1:26:05] see glorifies in her own self
[1:26:09] we're the church
[1:26:12] she said red and purple and scarlet
[1:26:15] precious stones
[1:26:17] she's got wealth and affluence
[1:26:19] in fact the matter
[1:26:21] she controls a good port of the part of
[1:26:24] the population of the earth
[1:26:26] billions
[1:26:30] and god is marked her as a ho as a
[1:26:32] harlot
[1:26:33] as a as mystery babbling the great
[1:26:36] the chord the great because she
[1:26:39] has incorporated the the ancient
[1:26:42] babylonian worship with christianity and
[1:26:44] as a mother of harlots and the
[1:26:46] abominations of the earth
[1:26:50] and her womb out of her womb instead of
[1:26:53] coming forth christ
[1:26:56] has come for more harlots
[1:27:00] not sons and daughters of god
[1:27:02] but corrupted offspring
[1:27:05] for
[1:27:06] who dwells in her
[1:27:08] or her habitation inner habitation is a
[1:27:12] habitation of devils
[1:27:15] and the hold of every foul spirit and a
[1:27:18] cage of uncle ever unclean and hateful
[1:27:21] bird listen i'm not preaching hate
[1:27:23] messages this morning
[1:27:25] i'm preaching the bible
[1:27:28] i am calling it the way the bible calls
[1:27:31] it
[1:27:36] are you with me now
[1:27:38] get rid of your political correct
[1:27:39] thinking just for a moment
[1:27:41] and then look at it from the bible
[1:27:44] perspective how god looks at it
[1:27:46] and man i want you to see here she is a
[1:27:49] she's a cage of every unclean and
[1:27:51] hateful bird these birds are men and
[1:27:54] women
[1:27:57] let me read it from jeremiah 5 25 your
[1:28:01] iniquities have turned
[1:28:03] away these things
[1:28:05] and your sins have withholded good
[1:28:07] things from you for among my people
[1:28:11] are found wicked men
[1:28:14] they lay weight as he that sell the
[1:28:17] snares they set a trap they catch men
[1:28:21] and as a cage of under uh full of birds
[1:28:25] so are their houses full of deceit
[1:28:27] therefore they have become great and wax
[1:28:29] and rich
[1:28:33] so this woman
[1:28:34] is a false religion
[1:28:37] a false church
[1:28:38] who's impersonating making a false claim
[1:28:43] to be the queen of heaven
[1:28:45] i said as a queen
[1:28:48] and the people that are caught in a trap
[1:28:50] of false religion
[1:28:52] they true are religious people
[1:28:56] now we're going to look at ii timothy 3
[1:28:59] and 1 and down through those verses for
[1:29:01] a moment but that this scripture
[1:29:03] describes her offspring and the
[1:29:05] condition of these religious people who
[1:29:08] are drunk on her wine
[1:29:12] thinking that jesus is going to take
[1:29:13] them to heaven in their sins
[1:29:16] that's where that's their the drink
[1:29:19] they're not real believers
[1:29:21] they are
[1:29:22] impersonators the bible were going to
[1:29:24] say for as janice and jeffrey's
[1:29:26] withstood moses
[1:29:29] so they were impersonators that these
[1:29:32] were
[1:29:33] impersonators they will corrupt the
[1:29:35] truth
[1:29:36] and he so they're not real believers but
[1:29:38] they're impersonators who withstood
[1:29:41] moses
[1:29:42] and so will these corrupt men re resist
[1:29:46] the truth
[1:29:48] now claiming to be the bride of christ
[1:29:51] yet
[1:29:52] here is the true condition of the these
[1:29:55] impersonators i want you to see we're
[1:29:57] going to take the cover off of them
[1:29:59] let's see if they're without spot or
[1:30:01] wrinkle or blemish second timothy 3 1
[1:30:04] this new also in the last days perilous
[1:30:07] times to come
[1:30:08] this is going to be matthew 24 24 it'll
[1:30:11] be so close to see the elect if it were
[1:30:13] possible
[1:30:14] for men
[1:30:16] shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:30:20] covetous
[1:30:22] boosters proud
[1:30:24] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:30:27] unthankful unholy without natural
[1:30:30] affection
[1:30:31] truth breakers
[1:30:33] false accusers incontinent
[1:30:36] fierce despisers of those that are good
[1:30:39] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[1:30:42] pleasures more than lovers of god
[1:30:46] didn't say they didn't love god
[1:30:49] said they love pleasures more
[1:30:52] and they have a because what they're
[1:30:54] religious next verse they are religious
[1:30:57] to have a form
[1:31:01] of godliness
[1:31:03] they have a pretension
[1:31:06] amen they they're carrying themselves as
[1:31:09] i'm a believer in christ i've accepted
[1:31:12] his pardon i i'm his church i'm a part
[1:31:15] of his body because we're drinking the
[1:31:18] wine
[1:31:19] of a church
[1:31:25] because they they're drunk on it
[1:31:27] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:31:30] the power thereof
[1:31:33] and then the same thing he says of the
[1:31:36] mother come out of her my people
[1:31:38] he says this from sense turn away
[1:31:45] because these are her offspring
[1:31:50] now another translation
[1:31:53] or paraphrase of this says you need to
[1:31:56] be aware in the final days the culture
[1:31:58] of society will become extremely fierce
[1:32:02] haven't we seen that
[1:32:05] people
[1:32:06] will be self-centered lovers of
[1:32:08] themselves
[1:32:10] obsessed with money that will boast to
[1:32:12] great things they strut around with
[1:32:14] arrogant pride mock all things that are
[1:32:16] right they will ignore their own
[1:32:18] families it will be ungrateful and
[1:32:19] ungodly
[1:32:21] they will be addicted to hateful and
[1:32:24] malicious slanders that's called news
[1:32:31] are you with me and they're addicted to
[1:32:33] hateful and malicious slander
[1:32:37] amen they're slaves to desire slaves of
[1:32:40] porn slaves of adultery and filth
[1:32:44] they will be ferocious but belligerent
[1:32:47] haters of that which is good and right
[1:32:50] with brutal treachery that will act
[1:32:52] without restraint bigoted wrapped in
[1:32:54] their clouds of their own conceit they
[1:32:57] will find the light in the places of
[1:32:59] this world more than the pleasures of
[1:33:01] the loving god they may pretend to have
[1:33:03] a respect for god but in reality they
[1:33:05] want nothing to do with god's power
[1:33:09] stay away from people like these
[1:33:13] on such turn away
[1:33:15] come out of her my people
[1:33:17] so you see here is the conditions of the
[1:33:21] end time
[1:33:22] and its people
[1:33:26] they will have a form of godliness
[1:33:28] religious men
[1:33:30] but deny the power thereof
[1:33:32] and he says to them as such turn away
[1:33:35] like was said a great come out of
[1:33:36] her my people be not partakers with them
[1:33:39] notice now
[1:33:41] and the word comes to them
[1:33:43] oh they read the bible like you do
[1:33:46] they listen to gospel sermons they
[1:33:48] listen and they cry with gospel songs
[1:33:52] amen but the word comes to them but not
[1:33:54] on good ground
[1:33:56] not on prepared ground
[1:33:58] and they have a form of godliness but
[1:34:01] not deny the power thereof by the way
[1:34:03] i'm reading from wisdom versus faith and
[1:34:06] then ii timothy said you know having a
[1:34:08] form of godliness
[1:34:11] you know denying the power thereof watch
[1:34:13] the holy spirit signs
[1:34:16] of eternal life they deny that
[1:34:20] people our ought to speak with tongues
[1:34:22] no no such thing as divine healing
[1:34:24] baptism of the holy oak that stuff was
[1:34:27] for the apostles
[1:34:29] look look where they are
[1:34:31] amen they deny the power thereof
[1:34:34] let me read again the signs holy spirit
[1:34:36] signs of eternal life they deny that
[1:34:39] people want to speak with tongues no no
[1:34:41] such thing as divine healing baptism of
[1:34:44] the holy ghost that stuff was for the
[1:34:46] apostles
[1:34:47] having a form
[1:34:49] paul prophesied in the last days these
[1:34:51] things would take place not in the in
[1:34:54] them days but these days the spirit
[1:34:56] speaks expressly in the last days latter
[1:34:59] day some will depart from the faith and
[1:35:01] all these things and here that that
[1:35:03] there it is having a form of godliness
[1:35:08] notice religious
[1:35:11] yet denying the power
[1:35:14] i want you to hold this thought now
[1:35:16] because we are to come out from among
[1:35:18] that
[1:35:20] they are covetous
[1:35:22] come on
[1:35:23] they're not changed
[1:35:25] boasters proud blasphemers still
[1:35:28] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[1:35:30] without natural affection oh yeah but
[1:35:32] brother tim we may we now you're gonna
[1:35:38] but but we have accepted the message and
[1:35:40] we know it's doctrines and when we we
[1:35:42] got the holy ghost by believing
[1:35:45] and yet they're still boasters and proud
[1:35:48] and blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:35:50] and unfaithful and unholy and without
[1:35:52] natural affections and truths breakers
[1:35:54] and false accusers and incontinent and
[1:35:56] fears and despisers of those that are
[1:35:59] good
[1:36:05] but a religious
[1:36:07] having a form of godliness but yet they
[1:36:10] deny the power of the gospel to cleanse
[1:36:13] you
[1:36:16] i'm going to dwell on this for a minute
[1:36:17] a form of godliness but no power to live
[1:36:19] it
[1:36:21] they claim to be the church but they're
[1:36:23] unclean and hateful birds
[1:36:26] that condition covetous boasters proud
[1:36:29] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:36:32] unthankful unholy
[1:36:34] false accusers
[1:36:36] how do we wind up here
[1:36:40] people call themselves christians
[1:36:44] impersonators
[1:36:45] as janice and jamboree withstood the
[1:36:48] words of the true prophet of god
[1:36:51] they are not offsprings of god
[1:36:55] come on
[1:36:56] amen they are offsprings of a religious
[1:36:59] system
[1:37:00] or the society of a church
[1:37:04] amen and they live sorted lives
[1:37:07] but when it comes to christ they're not
[1:37:09] loyal to him
[1:37:12] amen they're harlots
[1:37:14] with a blatant refusal to be
[1:37:17] loyal to
[1:37:18] christ amen
[1:37:21] now like i said they'll they'll still
[1:37:23] they'll sit right there hey they'll sit
[1:37:25] right there and defy you
[1:37:27] in a message church
[1:37:30] let me just bring it down to home we can
[1:37:32] talk about baptist methodist and
[1:37:34] presbyterian let's bring it right down
[1:37:36] here defy you defy will stand the
[1:37:39] vindicated prophet and boys still
[1:37:40] wearing their shorts
[1:37:43] defy the prophet of god
[1:37:46] girls still wearing their makeup
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:49] amen defy what the prophet god said
[1:37:53] heady high-minded
[1:37:56] lepers are places more than lovers of
[1:37:58] god
[1:37:59] go right on with their unholy filthy
[1:38:01] dress
[1:38:04] amen one that they can't get to cover a
[1:38:06] knee when they're standing or sitting
[1:38:08] too tight
[1:38:10] i mean trim their hair
[1:38:12] paint their nails
[1:38:15] waves like a harlot
[1:38:17] because they are mirroring their birth
[1:38:22] and their mother
[1:38:24] because if they mirrored the mother of
[1:38:27] the world
[1:38:29] they would be holy and without blemish
[1:38:33] before him in love
[1:38:39] the way back brother branham said number
[1:38:40] one killer is sin trouble sin his number
[1:38:43] the number one killer not heart trouble
[1:38:45] many say brother branham you say these
[1:38:47] things too hard
[1:38:49] we have to sin a little every day we
[1:38:51] just got to
[1:38:53] someone said you know brother branham i
[1:38:55] hear you condemning smoking and i do
[1:38:57] believe and he says and i do believe men
[1:38:59] shouldn't smoke i believe in holiness
[1:39:02] cleanness throughout soul body and
[1:39:04] spirit
[1:39:05] and say well we i we gotta i gotta just
[1:39:08] i just gotta smoke i just gotta smoke a
[1:39:10] little you know some you know what you
[1:39:12] know hey
[1:39:14] don't go throwing eggs at me this
[1:39:16] morning i have dealt with men
[1:39:19] who claimed this message and witnessed
[1:39:21] this message and testified of this
[1:39:23] message and claimed to be holy ghost
[1:39:25] field and their anointing came by going
[1:39:28] out and smoking a joint of marijuana
[1:39:34] amount
[1:39:36] so don't don't throw eggs at me i know
[1:39:38] what i'm talking about i'm not we're not
[1:39:41] pretending we're not being pretentious
[1:39:43] this morning we're exposing it
[1:39:46] amen so many we say i've got to take a
[1:39:49] little social drink in order to hold my
[1:39:51] job or others you know i've got a
[1:39:54] you know it's my self medication my
[1:39:56] alcohol
[1:39:59] i gotta have it you know to calm me down
[1:40:01] you know i i've gotta i gotta have it
[1:40:04] there to cope with life's trouble
[1:40:07] don't tell me i just met a girl in the
[1:40:09] prayer line who was drinking because you
[1:40:12] know there was trouble in her marriage
[1:40:13] and adulteries that had taken place and
[1:40:15] and she had turned to alcohol to calm
[1:40:18] herself yet she looked like a message
[1:40:20] person
[1:40:22] long hair long dress no makeup
[1:40:36] we hear women say
[1:40:38] i just got to cut my hair and wear my
[1:40:40] dresses up to date
[1:40:42] to keep my social standing in my church
[1:40:46] if i don't the women will say i look too
[1:40:48] old
[1:40:51] i just wonder how many you know are
[1:40:54] really
[1:40:55] really thinking about modest apparel
[1:40:58] but rather trying to look
[1:41:00] 25 years younger
[1:41:04] forgive me i'm going to say this this is
[1:41:06] brother branham forgive me i'm going to
[1:41:08] say something that's pentecostal
[1:41:11] prostitution
[1:41:14] that's right the reason they do it is
[1:41:15] because they hadn't tried the
[1:41:16] inoculation they hadn't tried god's
[1:41:18] serum for sin and these things that's
[1:41:21] right but now in hebrews it tells us a
[1:41:24] worshiper once wants purge he has no
[1:41:26] more conscience or otherwise no more
[1:41:28] desire to sin the whole thing's come
[1:41:30] from and he says there's no more you
[1:41:32] don't have to sin every day
[1:41:36] you don't have to do these things
[1:41:39] you do it because you willfully want to
[1:41:41] and the reason you willfully want to is
[1:41:43] because you never died to yourself
[1:41:46] oh brother i know that scorching but
[1:41:48] it's good when you die to yourself you
[1:41:50] become a new creature and then those
[1:41:52] things are gone
[1:41:55] amen hallelujah amen and if you try to
[1:41:59] act like you got him before you have
[1:42:00] it's like a black bird trying to put
[1:42:02] peacock feathers in his wing and say
[1:42:03] look i'm a peacock he isn't he's that's
[1:42:06] something he's stuck in his self it has
[1:42:08] to grow from the inside out
[1:42:11] and that's what the holy spirit is it's
[1:42:12] not something you smear on or something
[1:42:15] like that it's a new birth you've got to
[1:42:17] be born again and these virtues of the
[1:42:20] holy ghost has to come from the inside
[1:42:22] out
[1:42:23] listen now and when the world and sin
[1:42:27] and cutting hair and painting comes out
[1:42:30] against the word of god it shows the
[1:42:32] holy spirit is not there that's a direct
[1:42:36] evidence so what would you call it
[1:42:38] pentecostal prostitution
[1:42:43] that's exactly right committing
[1:42:44] spiritual the fornication with the god
[1:42:47] of heaven what a shame and disgrace it
[1:42:49] is
[1:42:50] prostituting themselves
[1:42:55] looking at what a prophet of god said in
[1:42:57] his
[1:42:58] in the message
[1:42:59] god's message to this end time
[1:43:02] and then want to take and twist it
[1:43:10] how did the church
[1:43:12] who began as a virgin without spot or
[1:43:14] wrinkle
[1:43:16] and was to produce christ bring forth
[1:43:18] such offspring
[1:43:22] now brother branham said the church
[1:43:24] was in that first stage was already a
[1:43:26] fallen woman as satan had got to eve
[1:43:28] before adam even now satan seduced the
[1:43:30] church the bride of christ
[1:43:32] before the marriage suffered the lamb
[1:43:33] and what specifically was in her midst
[1:43:35] that caused the fall
[1:43:36] what but
[1:43:38] revelation 2 6 the deeds of the
[1:43:40] nicolaitan already that first church had
[1:43:43] turned from following the pure word of
[1:43:45] god
[1:43:46] and by the so by the first age the
[1:43:48] church had already began to lose its
[1:43:50] first love
[1:43:52] and the first seal when it opens it
[1:43:54] exposes the antichrist
[1:43:58] amen he and and he's writing and notice
[1:44:03] in his first right he's an impersonator
[1:44:05] of christ
[1:44:07] he's on a white horse
[1:44:10] he has a bow but no arrows
[1:44:12] he is a bluff
[1:44:16] amen he starts out as an insidious
[1:44:18] spirit progressing in a gradual way and
[1:44:20] as a slicker moving the virtuous woman
[1:44:24] toward seduction
[1:44:27] now brother branham in the second seal
[1:44:29] tells us what happened you know he he
[1:44:31] recaps what he preached in the first
[1:44:33] seal and brings it out in the beginning
[1:44:35] of the second seal and he talks about
[1:44:38] how that a spirit come out of hell
[1:44:41] called nicolaitanism
[1:44:44] a nicoleth spirit which means to conquer
[1:44:48] the laity
[1:44:49] to take the power of god out of the
[1:44:53] church
[1:44:57] somebody with me now
[1:44:59] amen
[1:45:00] and to conquer the laity moving the
[1:45:04] little virgin church from her simple
[1:45:07] uncultured uneducated ways
[1:45:12] just this little humble girl and mover
[1:45:17] pushing out toward a woman of wealth
[1:45:21] and power
[1:45:22] dressed in scarlet
[1:45:24] purple deck with cold and and and and
[1:45:27] precious stones and pearls
[1:45:31] first
[1:45:33] let me just describe it
[1:45:35] and i'm going to give you the the
[1:45:36] references to it in
[1:45:39] paragraph 122 of the second seal and on
[1:45:41] down
[1:45:42] but let me let me just for the sake of
[1:45:45] not just reading quotes but just to put
[1:45:48] it in my own words
[1:45:50] so first this humble virgin girl when
[1:45:53] the holy ghost fell
[1:45:55] everybody began with everything in
[1:45:57] common there was no big ones or little
[1:45:59] ones
[1:46:00] there were great signs and wonders among
[1:46:03] them
[1:46:03] and there were prophecies and tongues
[1:46:07] and interpretations healings miracles
[1:46:11] discernments of spirits
[1:46:14] amen demons were cast out
[1:46:17] sins were cleansed
[1:46:19] they were everyone baptized in the name
[1:46:22] of jesus christ
[1:46:23] there were not three gods among them
[1:46:25] there were not two lords there was no
[1:46:27] confusion on godhead they served the one
[1:46:29] true and living god
[1:46:31] amen they were zealous for god
[1:46:33] and when they prayed the building joke
[1:46:37] with the power of god and they were
[1:46:39] filled with the holy ghost
[1:46:41] they went about from house to house
[1:46:42] breaking bread there was no unholiness
[1:46:45] no uncleanliness among them they were
[1:46:47] not ashamed of the manifestations of the
[1:46:50] spirit
[1:46:51] and then satan started to murmur among
[1:46:53] them
[1:46:57] because as they testified of the god's
[1:46:59] great power
[1:47:00] their rich masters and men of affluence
[1:47:03] heard the great work god was doing and
[1:47:06] they wanted to dress it up
[1:47:12] soon army captains and centurions and
[1:47:15] celebrities and dignitaries and men of
[1:47:17] wealth and affluence
[1:47:20] begin to join in their members
[1:47:23] and you know when they embrace
[1:47:25] christianity
[1:47:27] you know there it was hard for them rich
[1:47:30] men to go down to that old dingy dark
[1:47:34] hall where they clapped their hands
[1:47:37] where they shouted and speaking in
[1:47:39] tongues and getting messages now i'm
[1:47:40] quoting
[1:47:42] why he could never take his competitor
[1:47:44] his business associate whatever it is
[1:47:47] in his business he can you know he'd
[1:47:49] never believe it like that so he had to
[1:47:51] dress it up
[1:47:54] so it begins very subtly first
[1:47:58] there are
[1:48:00] and and yet
[1:48:01] there are those in that age that are
[1:48:03] actually commended
[1:48:05] for hating the deeds of the nicolaitans
[1:48:08] but then it comes in gradually as a
[1:48:10] doctrine
[1:48:13] just moving them a little bit at a time
[1:48:16] and soon joy was gone
[1:48:21] shouting was gone
[1:48:23] next darndest prayers were gone
[1:48:27] people didn't pray no more
[1:48:29] you know then the gifts of the spirit
[1:48:32] were gone
[1:48:33] and there was no more speaking in
[1:48:35] tongues
[1:48:37] and divine healing was gone
[1:48:40] and miracles didn't exist anymore
[1:48:44] hello this is how it came in that early
[1:48:49] church nicolaitans began to work and
[1:48:52] began with doctrine to take away the
[1:48:54] power of god
[1:48:57] and experience with god would be would
[1:49:00] be substituted by accepting a doctrine
[1:49:04] well i accept the message i believe god
[1:49:06] sent a prophet
[1:49:08] they lowered the bars and soon goats
[1:49:10] come in and took over
[1:49:12] unchanged
[1:49:15] the crowd of joy was gone the freedom
[1:49:16] the spirit was gone oh they kept like
[1:49:19] they keep on with the form but the fire
[1:49:21] had died down and the blackness of ashes
[1:49:23] was about all that was left
[1:49:27] you see it was a nicolaitan doctrine
[1:49:30] it was called in the bible antichrist
[1:49:33] because it was against the original
[1:49:36] doctrine of christ and his and his
[1:49:38] apostles
[1:49:40] so it came against the movement of the
[1:49:42] spirit
[1:49:43] it came against shouting
[1:49:46] it came against speaking in tongues
[1:49:49] it came again listen wanted to strip the
[1:49:52] church of power
[1:49:55] come on somebody and it embraced well
[1:49:57] the gospel don't have the power to
[1:49:59] change you so you got the holy ghost and
[1:50:02] you're still in porn
[1:50:04] you got the holy ghost and you're still
[1:50:05] married two or three times
[1:50:08] amen you've got the holy ghost and you
[1:50:10] can still cheat business deals
[1:50:12] you've got the holy ghost and you can
[1:50:14] still be an alcoholic
[1:50:16] but you got the holy ghost come on
[1:50:19] you you've got the holy ghost and you
[1:50:21] can still smoke a joint or you can do
[1:50:23] this or you can do that what and first
[1:50:25] thing you know the power is gone from
[1:50:28] the church instead of being a virtuous
[1:50:31] church without spot or wrinkle it
[1:50:33] becomes a cage of every unclean and
[1:50:35] hateful bird
[1:50:45] don't hang up on me i ain't half through
[1:50:49] nicolaitan means to conquer the laity to
[1:50:51] remove the power of god from the lay
[1:50:53] people
[1:50:54] put it all up on a ministry
[1:50:57] listen the words of your prophet paul
[1:50:59] saw it coming
[1:51:00] he warned him about this subtle
[1:51:02] priesthood that would come
[1:51:03] and take over with his false doctrines
[1:51:06] he knew they would implement a way of
[1:51:08] worship that excluded the people from
[1:51:10] any part in a holy spirit ministry
[1:51:13] listen a way of worship that excludes
[1:51:16] the people from
[1:51:18] any part in a holy spirit ministry
[1:51:22] and even right today among those who
[1:51:24] claim to be free
[1:51:25] and full of the spirit there's not too
[1:51:27] much freedom in the laity and the best
[1:51:29] we can find is a few preachers with
[1:51:32] inspired preaching while the flock just
[1:51:34] sits there and tries to absorb it
[1:51:41] now watch the spirit today
[1:51:43] look what it produces
[1:51:45] look what it wants to do
[1:51:47] by
[1:51:48] by educating
[1:51:51] by somebody help me now
[1:51:53] my man pray for me really hard right now
[1:51:56] what's that spirit today we you know
[1:51:58] comes in
[1:51:59] hardly an amen in the church
[1:52:02] youth they can't have a revival
[1:52:05] amen the gifts or the the you know the
[1:52:08] the the
[1:52:09] the spirit of god or the spirit of the
[1:52:12] naked nicolaitanes don't want the
[1:52:15] delayed the church to have the gifts of
[1:52:17] the spirit
[1:52:18] speaking in tongues is forbidden
[1:52:21] prophecy is the spice
[1:52:23] altar calls are forbidden
[1:52:25] and for that demon
[1:52:28] somebody listen don't want the seeker to
[1:52:31] receive an experience with god
[1:52:34] but instead just receive a knowledge
[1:52:37] imparted through from a teacher
[1:52:40] and no you are not allowed to shout
[1:52:43] only the preacher can do that from the
[1:52:45] pulpit and only then when he's angry
[1:52:52] and when you do that
[1:52:55] you're fast on your way
[1:52:57] to proving yourself as an offspring of
[1:52:59] the great
[1:53:10] you're starting to fit in a different
[1:53:11] category
[1:53:13] than the bride of christ
[1:53:18] balaam
[1:53:22] you see
[1:53:23] brother branham said this about and
[1:53:26] we're just going to speak about balaam
[1:53:27] in just a minute but let me take you
[1:53:29] this quote
[1:53:30] he said you see
[1:53:32] if you take away the word of god in the
[1:53:34] movement of the spirit as a means of
[1:53:36] worship
[1:53:37] they that worship me must worship me in
[1:53:39] spirit and in truth then you have to
[1:53:41] give people another form of worship as a
[1:53:43] substitute
[1:53:45] and that substitution spells balaamism
[1:53:53] if you take away the word of god and the
[1:53:56] moving of the spirit as a means of
[1:53:57] worship
[1:54:00] they that worship me must worship me in
[1:54:02] spirit and in truth
[1:54:04] then you will have to give the people
[1:54:06] another form of worship as a substitute
[1:54:09] and that substitution spells balaamism
[1:54:13] now
[1:54:15] balaamism was
[1:54:17] what was called in the old testament in
[1:54:19] the new testament it's called
[1:54:20] nicolaitanism
[1:54:23] because again
[1:54:25] balaam his design was to keep the people
[1:54:28] from the promised land
[1:54:32] where there's healing miracles signs
[1:54:34] wonders
[1:54:35] real deliverance
[1:54:37] true salvation
[1:54:39] now
[1:54:39] in the old testament there was this
[1:54:41] nation who wanted to keep israel out of
[1:54:43] her land
[1:54:44] so
[1:54:45] balak sent balaam to talk her out of
[1:54:48] what she had
[1:54:50] and balaam looked down upon listen now
[1:54:54] look down upon
[1:54:56] pentecostal people
[1:55:00] hello balaam
[1:55:02] who looks down on pentecostal people
[1:55:04] today
[1:55:06] amen yeah pentecostal people because
[1:55:09] israel had covenant with god and married
[1:55:11] him at sinai uh at pentecost
[1:55:15] they were the first pentecostals and a
[1:55:17] marriage took place 50 days after the
[1:55:19] passover and balaam looked down upon
[1:55:22] that woman israel and she's not
[1:55:24] denominated but she has a pillar of fire
[1:55:27] with supernatural signs she has a
[1:55:29] smitten raw she has divine healing and
[1:55:32] she has a shout of the king
[1:55:35] amen amen i'll tell you this we had that
[1:55:38] before the prophet left us
[1:55:40] [Applause]
[1:55:42] amen we had that in the 40s we had that
[1:55:44] in the 50s we had that in the 60s
[1:55:47] and i'm gonna say that today there's a
[1:55:49] church that has that right here in this
[1:55:52] last day right here in the end time
[1:55:55] hallelujah
[1:55:58] but you see he didn't want them
[1:56:00] pentecostal people to get in their
[1:56:02] promised land
[1:56:04] and receive their inheritance
[1:56:07] so he tried cursing them
[1:56:09] and all he could do was get god to bless
[1:56:12] them
[1:56:14] amen you know i've had men come along
[1:56:17] and try to curse me literally because
[1:56:19] try to call curses down to heaven and i
[1:56:21] just laugh at them and mock them and say
[1:56:23] curse on man
[1:56:25] curse some because the more you curse
[1:56:27] the more god's going to bless me
[1:56:30] amen but again you know here he tried
[1:56:33] cursing him and god kept blessing them
[1:56:36] and he said but he finally figured out i
[1:56:38] know how to get him to fall
[1:56:41] and what he couldn't do by cursing he
[1:56:44] did it by telling him oh but we're all
[1:56:46] one
[1:56:48] and you really don't need that pillar of
[1:56:50] fire with signs and wonders
[1:56:52] and divine healing you see that was for
[1:56:54] another age and and the shout of the
[1:56:56] king you don't need that
[1:56:59] let me dress you up and make you more
[1:57:01] dignified
[1:57:03] you see because we we we believe all
[1:57:05] that too but we're more dignified
[1:57:08] you know now balaamism is the subjection
[1:57:11] of the people to their system of creed
[1:57:13] and worship in order to hold them
[1:57:18] listen again balaamism is a subjection
[1:57:21] of the people to their system of creed
[1:57:23] and worship in order to hold them
[1:57:26] now in the pergament age brother brandon
[1:57:28] said moses or moab represented the
[1:57:31] nicolaitans
[1:57:32] now just for a minute
[1:57:34] israel represented the true church
[1:57:36] balaam was one of the bishops of hopes
[1:57:39] now we see carnal christianity now we'll
[1:57:41] notice he was gifted there was no doubt
[1:57:44] about it
[1:57:45] many of them are fine speakers and
[1:57:47] doctors of philosophy and great men you
[1:57:50] can't deny that but having a form of
[1:57:52] godliness but denying the power there go
[1:57:55] back to that original pentecost
[1:57:58] don't get away from there
[1:58:00] if you do you are lost stay with that
[1:58:03] blessing that's the the blesser of the
[1:58:06] blessing
[1:58:09] so what he was trying to do was move
[1:58:11] them away from the spirit moving
[1:58:14] to man's leadership
[1:58:17] now
[1:58:18] let's go back to this lewd woman just
[1:58:20] for a moment
[1:58:21] she's a church
[1:58:23] that's impersonating
[1:58:25] claiming to be the church
[1:58:28] she's the queen of heaven
[1:58:30] pretending to be the bride of christ
[1:58:33] and remember that's how the antichrist
[1:58:36] started his ride
[1:58:38] pretending
[1:58:40] he was on a white horse impersonating
[1:58:42] christ
[1:58:43] a bow with no arrows
[1:58:46] now in the first seal brother branham
[1:58:48] tells us this he said he's a bluff
[1:58:51] this is this is the first seal he's a
[1:58:54] bluff he has no power you say the power
[1:58:56] of the church where is it out
[1:59:00] what do they do they say we're the
[1:59:01] original church the original church cast
[1:59:05] out devils healed the sick raised the
[1:59:07] dead saw visions everything else words
[1:59:10] of that now see he's a bluff a bow with
[1:59:12] no arrows
[1:59:15] you see again
[1:59:17] he has a form of godliness
[1:59:20] but he denies the power
[1:59:22] so don't you see how the antichrist
[1:59:24] spirit wants to reduce us to a powerless
[1:59:27] religion
[1:59:29] because why god hates
[1:59:33] a powerless religion
[1:59:36] come on
[1:59:37] amen are you with me he hates a horus
[1:59:40] church don't say brother tim he don't
[1:59:43] hate the horse he hates the horace
[1:59:45] church
[1:59:47] and he will burn her with fire
[1:59:51] read the bible he will stone her with
[1:59:53] stones like a prostitute
[1:59:57] come on now we're talking about jesus of
[1:59:59] the new testament
[2:00:03] god hates a powerless religion it's got
[2:00:05] to have power
[2:00:07] it's got to have power to save a man
[2:00:09] from sin
[2:00:11] is a power that can do signs and wonders
[2:00:14] miracles is jesus promise
[2:00:16] you see you zero in on the word of god
[2:00:19] and they zeroed on it back there and
[2:00:20] believed it hit the target you zero the
[2:00:22] same way on the word of god it'll hit
[2:00:24] the target again because it's got to
[2:00:27] because he's the same yesterday today
[2:00:28] and forever god don't like a powerless
[2:00:31] religion god don't want that god wants
[2:00:33] to perform god wants to show himself
[2:00:36] alive
[2:00:37] yeah our hopes is the resurrection is
[2:00:39] that right our hopes is of life is
[2:00:42] resurrection the resurrection of jesus
[2:00:44] christ you see god wants to work in his
[2:00:47] church
[2:00:49] jesus said i'll be with you always to
[2:00:51] the end of the world the works that i do
[2:00:53] so you do also
[2:00:57] so he's a bluff
[2:00:59] but we're not bluffing
[2:01:01] we're christians come on we're
[2:01:03] overcoming somebody help me now we are
[2:01:06] conquering and in the true church devils
[2:01:10] are cast out
[2:01:12] hallelujah the sick are healed
[2:01:15] visions are sown
[2:01:16] amen our boat has arrows and it'll hit
[2:01:19] the target if it hit it two thousand
[2:01:22] years ago he's still the same yesterday
[2:01:24] today and forever amen and it'll hit the
[2:01:27] target again and again and again
[2:01:32] but you can't hit a target with no
[2:01:33] arrows
[2:01:38] we're not bluffing as christians
[2:01:40] we're overcoming and conquering
[2:01:43] amen our flesh amen wait a minute we're
[2:01:46] not just talking about on one side
[2:01:48] supernatural things because many will
[2:01:50] come to me in that day and say lord lord
[2:01:51] have i not cast out devils in your name
[2:01:54] and they're still workers of iniquity so
[2:01:56] some work iniquities do believe in
[2:01:58] miracles
[2:01:59] and other workers iniquity don't
[2:02:04] neither one uplift
[2:02:08] are you with me
[2:02:09] amen
[2:02:11] but notice
[2:02:13] in the true church
[2:02:16] the devil's has to be cast out as i've
[2:02:19] said this has got to be the number one
[2:02:21] thing
[2:02:23] that we do as a body of christ cast
[2:02:26] satan out
[2:02:27] [Music]
[2:02:29] cast him out of lives casts him out
[2:02:34] come on somebody amen cast every demon
[2:02:37] of alcohol tobacco
[2:02:40] drugs
[2:02:42] come on this is this spirit that wants
[2:02:44] to come long hair on men and short hair
[2:02:46] on women cast out the devils out
[2:02:51] amen the sickness be healed
[2:02:54] visions must be shown
[2:02:56] amen our bell has to have arrows
[2:03:01] but our flesh also has to be made
[2:03:03] submissive
[2:03:07] and it's true
[2:03:09] i want to talk about this for a moment
[2:03:11] your flesh is unconverted
[2:03:15] oh yeah
[2:03:16] and still has sinful tendencies
[2:03:19] it still can be tempted
[2:03:21] it wants to doubt
[2:03:24] amen brother branham would we would
[2:03:26] would pray every day god forgive me of
[2:03:28] my sins what was it doubting
[2:03:33] unbelief
[2:03:35] of every kind of form
[2:03:37] coming and warned against you we're in a
[2:03:39] battle
[2:03:42] amen we're in a battle
[2:03:44] amen amen you see when we have a flesh
[2:03:47] here that that has a tendency that is
[2:03:49] pulled toward doubting
[2:03:52] fear
[2:03:53] fear has torment
[2:03:55] is the opposite of faith
[2:03:57] even jesus after receiving the holy
[2:03:59] ghost was tempted of the devil with all
[2:04:02] kinds of temptations against his flesh
[2:04:05] is that right and as long as you have
[2:04:07] this life as long as you're in this life
[2:04:09] and i'm quoting brother branham here you
[2:04:11] are going to have us be sticky and have
[2:04:14] a carnal nature that's going to bother
[2:04:16] you as long as you live
[2:04:20] but the inside of you
[2:04:22] you're born again and when you're raised
[2:04:24] up you're in the likeness of christ and
[2:04:26] all sin is gone from you
[2:04:30] hallelujah
[2:04:31] let me tell you though though the body
[2:04:34] is weak
[2:04:35] though the flesh is unconverted the holy
[2:04:38] ghost is greater than the weakness of
[2:04:41] your flesh
[2:04:42] and it will keep you in the hour of
[2:04:45] temptation
[2:04:47] and i'm telling you i'm telling you we
[2:04:49] are not bluffing we are real warriors
[2:04:52] against the devil
[2:04:57] hallelujah
[2:04:59] you cast down imaginations you cast down
[2:05:02] wrong thoughts
[2:05:03] you cast down wrong tempers

[2:08:51] christ
[2:08:53] yes sir

[2:08:59] the bible said
[2:09:02] that how shall we that are dead to sin
[2:09:05] live any longer therein
[2:09:07] so why are we why are we advocating
[2:09:09] living and on in sin
[2:09:13] the bible said in romans 6 6 knowing our
[2:09:15] old man is crucified with him that the
[2:09:17] body of sin might be destroyed that
[2:09:19] henceforth we should not serve sin
[2:09:22] there's a people that don't serve sin
[2:09:26] amen for he that is dead is freed from
[2:09:28] sin
[2:09:30] amen
[2:09:31] romans 6 12 let there let sin therefore
[2:09:34] let not sin therefore reign in your
[2:09:36] mortal body that it should be obeyed the
[2:09:38] luster of
[2:09:40] it goes on to save your sins and i have
[2:09:42] dominion over you
[2:09:44] because being made friends free from sin

[2:09:49] the desire of sin is gone
[2:09:54] hallelujah
[2:09:55] amen you don't want to be like that you
[2:09:57] want to be more like jesus
[2:10:00] right
[2:10:00] amen the message of the gospel is to
[2:10:03] prove to the world that he's living
[2:10:07] not 2 000 years ago but living
[2:10:10] where in bright form in his people
[2:10:14] hallelujah amen it's the light in the
[2:10:17] evening time amen where he says i'll
[2:10:19] prove to my disciples i'm not dead but
[2:10:23] i'm alive i'm so living in them people
[2:10:27] they're not slaves to sin anymore
[2:10:29] they're not slaves to unbelief anymore
[2:10:31] they're not slaves to fear or doubt come
[2:10:34] on somebody amen they're free-born their
[2:10:37] children are the free woman they are not
[2:10:40] bonds women
[2:10:41] they are not prostitutes they are not
[2:10:43] they are not pilots they are
[2:10:46] virgin to the word of god
[2:10:49] they prove that his life is in them
[2:10:54] hallelujah and you can't do that just by
[2:10:57] word only
[2:10:58] it comes with power
[2:11:00] and great assurance
[2:11:02] amen it's not a make-believe gospel
[2:11:05] it's not a denomination of fiction
[2:11:08] oh god's going to take us all in heaven
[2:11:10] just say jesus i i'm sorry for my sins
[2:11:13] okay you're you're saved and going to
[2:11:15] heaven your life's got to be changed
[2:11:18] you've got to die to sin
[2:11:20] amen you can't continue on as brother
[2:11:23] branham told us and i just say it's a
[2:11:25] problem worldwide
[2:11:28] it's a problem worldwide i i wanted to
[2:11:30] say it's a problem even in this church
[2:11:35] i'm afraid to admit today many of us are
[2:11:37] not getting the people to christ
[2:11:40] we're getting them to church
[2:11:43] to a theory
[2:11:45] but we must get them to christ
[2:11:48] he's the only one and the only one that
[2:11:50] has life he has the he that has the son
[2:11:53] has life
[2:11:55] and he said i'm afraid of this and i'll
[2:11:57] tell you what just just stand with me
[2:11:59] sometimes in prayer lines with people
[2:12:01] when when sin becomes exposed and
[2:12:03] devil's there are being exposed and
[2:12:07] people realize i need christ i need help
[2:12:11] and they come up in prayer lines and
[2:12:12] sins are exposed and troubled and
[2:12:14] everything else and you'll find out we
[2:12:17] haven't got him to christ
[2:12:19] we got to do the church we got them to
[2:12:21] the theory
[2:12:23] we got them to believe god sent a
[2:12:24] prophet maybe maybe
[2:12:30] but we never got them to christ
[2:12:33] their lives are still unchanged
[2:12:36] but it's a life
[2:12:38] of a dead man be projecting you you'll
[2:12:41] live the same kind he lived
[2:12:44] for life of another
[2:12:47] and if your spirit is wrecking dead and
[2:12:49] the life of christ comes into you how
[2:12:51] can you help but live the life of christ
[2:12:54] so i'm going to say there has to be a
[2:12:55] virgin bride
[2:12:57] the people of the resurrection prepared
[2:12:59] to meet the bridegroom
[2:13:01] and god left it for this age
[2:13:04] for there to come a bride without spot
[2:13:08] somebody with me now
[2:13:10] not an immature girl
[2:13:12] like in the days of luther
[2:13:14] not a preteen like in the days of wesley
[2:13:17] not a little teeny bopper like the azusa
[2:13:20] movement infatuated and dazzled with
[2:13:22] gifts and not together
[2:13:25] amen but a mature elect lady
[2:13:30] ready and willing to take on his name
[2:13:34] and unashamed of anything that he has
[2:13:38] his name his identity
[2:13:40] his gifts
[2:13:42] his miracles his signs
[2:13:44] his wonders
[2:13:46] come on one who has his identity
[2:13:49] you know remember this lewd woman of
[2:13:51] revelation 17 blasphemes his name by
[2:13:55] rejecting it
[2:13:56] as the only name of salvation
[2:14:00] come on
[2:14:03] he said he carried me into the spirit
[2:14:05] into the wilderness
[2:14:06] i saw a woman sitting on this girl a
[2:14:08] scarlet colored beast
[2:14:11] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[2:14:13] heads and ten horns
[2:14:15] there it was
[2:14:17] this this one
[2:14:18] that was full of names of blasphemy
[2:14:23] these would be a there would be a
[2:14:24] departure from the faith
[2:14:26] in these perilous times and these
[2:14:29] religious men with forms of godliness
[2:14:32] that be blasphemers by claiming the name
[2:14:34] of christ
[2:14:35] and not departing from iniquity
[2:14:40] name's a blasphemy
[2:14:42] brother bradham told us he said names
[2:14:44] mean something
[2:14:46] he said don't name your child ricky or
[2:14:48] elvis or something like that he said you
[2:14:51] know it's a it's a name for this day it
[2:14:53] goes
[2:14:54] you know it means something so our name
[2:14:56] means nothing he said well why did he
[2:14:58] change abram's name to abraham and why
[2:15:00] did he change uh saul's name to paul and
[2:15:04] why did change simon's name to peter why
[2:15:06] did he change his own name
[2:15:09] what he changed jacob to israel
[2:15:11] not until he wrestled with the lord not
[2:15:13] only overcome but when jesus overcome
[2:15:16] death hell and the grave the bible said
[2:15:18] he had a new name amen he was the
[2:15:20] conqueror and he said if the church can
[2:15:23] overcome
[2:15:24] she will stop saying i'm methodist
[2:15:27] baptist and presbyterian
[2:15:31] are you with me now
[2:15:33] if the church can overcome
[2:15:37] she'll quit trying to identify her as
[2:15:39] little groups
[2:15:41] of two souls in perusian
[2:15:43] seven thunders and
[2:15:47] this and that and the other
[2:15:50] i'm methodists i'm baptist and
[2:15:52] presbyterian
[2:15:54] you see these are these are defined in
[2:15:57] the bible it's blasphemous
[2:15:59] names
[2:16:01] or names of blasphemy
[2:16:04] because to be called anything
[2:16:06] other than the name of your bridegroom
[2:16:10] is the marking of a headless woman a
[2:16:14] harlot
[2:16:17] but she as a virgin bride receives a
[2:16:20] name change
[2:16:23] hallelujah this is why when we water
[2:16:25] baptized we take on his name
[2:16:28] we are buried in his name we rise in his
[2:16:30] name
[2:16:31] everything we do in word of deed we do
[2:16:33] it in the name of jesus christ
[2:16:36] amen she's a virgin bride who receives
[2:16:38] his name notice when she can overcome
[2:16:41] her creeds and the world that's drawn
[2:16:44] her in there she'll come back to being
[2:16:46] the bride of jesus christ miseras jesus
[2:16:50] christ
[2:16:52] hallelujah
[2:16:53] now
[2:16:54] you see they've taken on names
[2:16:56] of blasphemy
[2:16:59] remember we're only to have his name
[2:17:03] but they take on names of blasphemy
[2:17:06] like a grafted lemon
[2:17:08] living in the life of an orange tree
[2:17:11] it's an on an orange tree but it's
[2:17:14] barren lemons
[2:17:16] so but he said every time that tree gets
[2:17:19] a year older puts forth a new branch
[2:17:21] it puts forth more oranges
[2:17:24] if the vine puts forth its branch
[2:17:26] and what we tried to do is we joined
[2:17:28] members into him and live under the name
[2:17:31] of christianity energy because it's a
[2:17:33] common way of saying we are the citrus
[2:17:36] fruit the christian church
[2:17:38] but when the vine itself puts forth the
[2:17:40] vine it'll be like the first vine it put
[2:17:43] forth if the first vine had put forth
[2:17:45] they wrote a book of acts behind it if
[2:17:48] it if it puts ever puts forth another
[2:17:51] one it'll write another book of acts
[2:17:53] behind it
[2:17:54] right so you're only joining lodges when
[2:17:57] you're born of the vine you got a fruit
[2:17:59] and you got a fruit what do you do with
[2:18:01] it you have a form of godliness
[2:18:05] denying the power thereof
[2:18:08] so they deny the fruits
[2:18:11] you see instead of bringing forth
[2:18:13] oranges they're bringing forth
[2:18:16] another life
[2:18:17] and so he says you deny signs i'm
[2:18:20] quoting your prophet you deny wonders
[2:18:23] you deny the holy ghost you deny
[2:18:25] speaking in tongues you deny visions you
[2:18:28] deny prophecies
[2:18:30] you deny healing and yet you call
[2:18:33] yourself a name no wonder the holy ghost
[2:18:35] said a power a group of people full of
[2:18:38] blasphemous names you're calling
[2:18:40] themselves christian with forms of
[2:18:42] godliness but denying the power
[2:18:47] from such
[2:18:49] what were we commanded turn away come
[2:18:52] out of her my people
[2:18:54] amen oh my notice he opens his mouth and
[2:18:58] blasphemy teaching for doctrines and
[2:19:01] commandments of man heady high-minded
[2:19:03] lovers of pleasure having a form of
[2:19:05] godliness denying the power thereof
[2:19:07] blasphemes the name of god changing that
[2:19:10] name to titles refusing to do otherwise
[2:19:14] amen
[2:19:15] as delilah a harlot betrayed samson
[2:19:20] all right let me tell you that spirit
[2:19:22] will betray you
[2:19:26] don't lay your head down in her lap
[2:19:29] are you with me are you hearing me even
[2:19:32] across the lands today don't lay your
[2:19:34] head down in her lap
[2:19:37] no sir it'll convince you that you can't
[2:19:39] live an overcoming life
[2:19:42] it will point to your flesh and say
[2:19:45] well
[2:19:46] you know
[2:19:48] but you're still tempted and
[2:19:51] and you have a temper and you have bad
[2:19:53] thoughts and and unbelief and
[2:19:56] and you have to repent sure you do
[2:19:58] your flesh is not converted
[2:20:01] but it's no longer your ruler
[2:20:04] amen for we walk not after the flesh but
[2:20:06] after the spirit
[2:20:08] say yeah it's a black dog but it's a
[2:20:10] defeated black dog
[2:20:13] and we don't pet it and we don't feed it
[2:20:16] and every day we crucify it
[2:20:19] hallelujah don't deny the power of the
[2:20:22] gospel that you can live and overcome in
[2:20:24] life
[2:20:27] you see when you do that that empowers
[2:20:29] the black dog
[2:20:32] amen don't don't are you with me now
[2:20:34] that will empower the black dog
[2:20:37] let me tell you feed them the right
[2:20:38] things shun the appearance of evil
[2:20:41] repent turning from your beastly flesh
[2:20:44] and given lordship to the one who is
[2:20:46] filthy
[2:20:48] and but give the our lordship to the one
[2:20:50] who is king of kings and lord of lords
[2:20:53] amen we're not filthy who can't
[2:20:56] live right we have the power of god
[2:20:59] under salvation
[2:21:00] hallelujah he'll have a glorious church
[2:21:03] without spot or wrinkle
[2:21:06] delilah's looking for the power to turn
[2:21:09] us into a powerless people
[2:21:12] he's always she's always was trying
[2:21:14] probing here trying there
[2:21:17] to find the secret of her power
[2:21:20] i'll tell you what the secret of his
[2:21:21] power was was his covenant with god
[2:21:24] it was shown in the sign of seven locks
[2:21:28] now's the right vowel
[2:21:30] are you with me a man and when she cut
[2:21:33] off them locks
[2:21:34] she cut off his power
[2:21:36] when you cut off your covenant with god
[2:21:40] come on
[2:21:41] amen because you're to be a virgin
[2:21:42] church
[2:21:44] and we call when you cut off that
[2:21:45] covenant with god and you lose your
[2:21:47] prayer life
[2:21:49] amen and the holy spirit is absent from
[2:21:52] the church and there's no side of the
[2:21:54] king there no more and there's no more
[2:21:56] glorious to gods and hallelujahs and
[2:21:58] thank you jesus anymore and there's no
[2:22:01] more divine healing and miracles and
[2:22:03] signs and wonders in the church anymore
[2:22:05] that's the devil that's delilah cutting
[2:22:08] off your locks
[2:22:10] separating yourself from your covenant
[2:22:12] with god that gives you power
[2:22:15] power over unclean spirits
[2:22:19] unclean spirits that makes you live a
[2:22:22] filthy dirty life
[2:22:28] brother branham said she delight
[2:22:31] and i just want to say
[2:22:33] i wonder if it happened hasn't happened
[2:22:35] again
[2:22:36] and again and it just keeps repeating
[2:22:39] she's tipped
[2:22:40] the cup of her fornication into the
[2:22:42] mouths of god's church
[2:22:45] that's been raised up to show his signs
[2:22:47] and wonders as jesus last commandment
[2:22:50] was to do in mark 16 and we find she's
[2:22:53] taking god's little faithful group and
[2:22:55] organize them together that's exactly
[2:22:57] like like the way he did herself and
[2:23:00] she's got them standing stripped
[2:23:02] denying the power thereof denying the
[2:23:05] holy spirit denying the power to speak
[2:23:07] with tongues denying the power of the
[2:23:09] holy spirit to raise the dead heal the
[2:23:11] sick cast out devils
[2:23:14] and now the philistines are on us
[2:23:22] but in the midst of all of that
[2:23:26] when israel was rising and there she was
[2:23:29] coming out of babylon and here she would
[2:23:32] be such a rude woman
[2:23:35] she would actually hang her husband on a
[2:23:38] cross
[2:23:40] and crucify him
[2:23:44] but in the midst of all of that
[2:23:47] god raised up
[2:23:49] a virgin
[2:23:52] a zechariah an elizabeth
[2:23:55] and a mary and a chosen
[2:23:57] an anna and a simian and shepherds on
[2:24:00] the hill
[2:24:02] hallelujah in the midst of all of that
[2:24:04] god found him a little virgin group of
[2:24:07] people who would bring forth the messiah
[2:24:10] who would pray for
[2:24:12] christ hallelujah and that's what god's
[2:24:15] looking for today is a worm
[2:24:18] a womb that he can bring his life in
[2:24:21] nothing's also bringing out another
[2:24:23] perverted life but a church without
[2:24:25] spider-wrinkle
