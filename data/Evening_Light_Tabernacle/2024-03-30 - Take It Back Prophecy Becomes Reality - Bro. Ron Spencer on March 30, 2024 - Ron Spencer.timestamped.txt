[56:36] Hallelujah I've heard brother
[56:39] Andrew for a long long time now that was
[56:42] the best I ever heard him preach and so
[56:45] he just got himself out of the way and
[56:47] let God borrow his body and so amen I
[56:50] was so blessed by that amen if you
[56:53] missed that on the internet go back and
[56:55] watch that it was so
[56:57] tremendous Revelations chap 21 and verse
[57:00] one and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[57:03] Earth that's where we're going for the
[57:07] first Heaven and the first Earth were
[57:08] passed away and there was no more
[57:11] sea and I John saw the holy city the New
[57:15] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[57:17] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[57:20] her husband and I heard a great voice
[57:23] out of Heaven saying behold the
[57:25] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[57:28] will dwell with them and they shall be
[57:30] his people and God
[57:31] himself shall be with them and be their
[57:35] God and God shall wipe away all tears
[57:39] from their eyes and there shall be no
[57:41] more death we ought to be able to shout
[57:44] right
[57:44] there neither sorrow nor crying neither
[57:49] shall there be any more pain for the
[57:52] former things are passed away and he
[57:55] that set up on the throne said behold I
[57:58] make all things new and he said unto me
[58:02] write for these words are true and
[58:06] faithful and he said unto me it is done
[58:10] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[58:13] the end and I will give unto him that is
[58:16] a thirst of the Fountain of Water of
[58:18] Life freely and he that
[58:21] overcometh shall inherit all
[58:24] things he's talking to
[58:26] you and I will be his God and he shall
[58:31] be my son you may be
[58:41] seated we have a special guest with us

[58:59] prayer lines that went one six hours one
[59:02] about three hours and God came and did

[59:31] you God bless
[59:36] you thank you Titus you got the same
[59:40] color suit and the same color tie amen
[59:43] we got the memo didn't
[59:44] we when I first came and the reason I
[59:47] did that is when I first started coming
[59:49] to this meeting I remember it was Lydia
[59:53] and Esther and Bethany I I think they
[59:57] must have had reserved seity they sat
[1:00:00] basically right in front of the preacher
[1:00:02] and they were young ladies then and now
[1:00:04] they're married and and being blessed
[1:00:08] and God has watched over them and their
[1:00:10] incredible part but I look back and life
[1:00:12] has has came and our journey is still
[1:00:15] with you and we we certainly have been
[1:00:18] blessed throughout the
[1:00:24] years
[1:00:26] four and a half years ago I stood in
[1:00:29] brother Tim's Church during his fall
[1:00:34] meeting and I stood and preached a
[1:00:37] sermon that you may remember it was
[1:00:40] called take it
[1:00:44] back I I'm four and a half years
[1:00:47] later not aware that I would be fighting
[1:00:51] cancer within a couple of months after
[1:00:53] that sister Connie that's here
[1:00:56] she said that that sermon made the devil
[1:00:59] mad and cancer came and and we have
[1:01:03] fought it for four and a half years
[1:01:05] we're going to win
[1:01:08] it we're going to win
[1:01:16] it I want to hear the doctor say you
[1:01:19] don't have to take chemo
[1:01:21] anymore that's what I want to hear him
[1:01:23] say I I want to hear them say that to me
[1:01:27] and I want to hear them say zero cancer
[1:01:29] I believe that can
[1:01:31] happen over the last few weeks God the
[1:01:34] Lord has dealt with me I was going to
[1:01:36] take a different subject on this evening
[1:01:38] and the Lord continued to deal with me
[1:01:41] and and continue to turn my thoughts
[1:01:44] over and over
[1:01:46] again and tonight I'd like to speak to
[1:01:48] you take it
[1:01:54] back
[1:02:01] so what I look at as as I examine these
[1:02:05] thoughts and look to step into this
[1:02:08] service this
[1:02:09] evening we can look at that sermon four
[1:02:13] and a half years ago as
[1:02:17] prophecy and I want to look at tonight
[1:02:19] as
[1:02:24] fulfillment
[1:02:29] in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse
[1:02:33] 8 it's very familiar to us because I'm
[1:02:35] not the only one fighting a battle I
[1:02:37] believe every person here fights a
[1:02:39] different battle so this service is not
[1:02:42] about me I'm just going to be your
[1:02:44] speaker for the evening it's about
[1:02:47] you we are troubled on every
[1:02:50] sight yet not
[1:02:53] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:02:58] despair
[1:03:01] Hallelujah
[1:03:02] persecuted but not
[1:03:05] forsaken cast down but not
[1:03:08] destroyed always bearing about in the
[1:03:11] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[1:03:14] the life also of Jesus might be man made
[1:03:16] manifest in our
[1:03:18] body for we which live are always
[1:03:22] delivered unto death for jesus'
[1:03:24] sake that the life also of Jesus might
[1:03:28] be made manifest in our mortal
[1:03:31] flesh so then death worketh in us but
[1:03:34] life in
[1:03:35] you we have in the same Spirit of Faith
[1:03:39] according as it is written I belied and
[1:03:43] therefore have I
[1:03:45] spoken we also believe and therefore we
[1:03:51] speak now we realize that when God said
[1:03:55] says he can do something he not only
[1:03:59] shows that is that he can do it and
[1:04:02] shows his purpose but he confirms his
[1:04:06] word we serve a God that has never
[1:04:11] failed he has never lied he has never
[1:04:15] been in a
[1:04:17] crisis he never calls his angels
[1:04:19] together and say I don't know what I'm
[1:04:21] going to do with this next
[1:04:23] situation it was pre-planned before the
[1:04:26] foundation of the
[1:04:27] world and you're an attribute of God
[1:04:30] that is now made physical on the earth
[1:04:32] born a certain day you're sitting in
[1:04:34] this building people in Noah's age would
[1:04:38] have liked to have lived here in
[1:04:39] Jeremiah's age would have liked to have
[1:04:41] been here but God reserved you come on
[1:04:46] on to be the final Runners of the final
[1:04:49] age the final voice of the final
[1:04:53] age your life is is playing out a
[1:04:57] symphony it's playing out life a song
[1:05:01] and Satan is doing everything he can do
[1:05:04] to stop
[1:05:07] you he has gambled hell against
[1:05:12] you but I would like to say this to him
[1:05:14] tonight he has never been able to stop
[1:05:17] us right and he never
[1:05:24] will
[1:05:27] even Jesus body laying inside of the
[1:05:30] Tomb the scripture said that corruption
[1:05:33] could not touch his body you and I was
[1:05:37] inside of
[1:05:39] him and no matter how much the devil
[1:05:42] says he's going to destroy you if he
[1:05:45] couldn't corrupt you 2,000 years ago he
[1:05:48] can't do it
[1:05:54] tonight
[1:05:56] the scripture says and if you would just
[1:05:58] hang with me just for a moment in 1
[1:06:00] Samuel chapter 25 and verse
[1:06:04] three now the name of the man was
[1:06:08] nabal and the the name of his wife
[1:06:13] Abigail and she was a woman of good
[1:06:17] understanding and of a beautiful
[1:06:20] countenance she was beauty and brains
[1:06:24] together amen
[1:06:28] yeah Hallelujah but the man was
[1:06:32] curlish and evil in his
[1:06:35] doings and he was of the House of
[1:06:38] Caleb here was a woman that was trapped
[1:06:42] in
[1:06:44] marriage she was trapped with an
[1:06:48] abuser she was trapped with a man that
[1:06:51] did not appreciate who she was how
[1:06:54] beautiful she was and
[1:06:56] amen how brilliant that she
[1:06:59] was so was
[1:07:04] you I didn't just read that scripture
[1:07:06] just to read that scripture so was
[1:07:10] you you was married to your first
[1:07:13] nature and the enemy was
[1:07:18] cruel made you a
[1:07:20] slave put a lot of things in your life
[1:07:23] that you're very ashamed of today
[1:07:27] but there was a man that was on his way
[1:07:29] to being
[1:07:31] King he had been anointed by the
[1:07:34] prophet Samuel that he would be the king
[1:07:38] and God had great plans for him in his
[1:07:40] life God watched over him he became an
[1:07:44] exile and while in Exile he would become
[1:07:49] Abigail's
[1:07:51] husband and he took because of that
[1:07:54] nebal died he took her as his
[1:07:58] wife and she had great wisdom yeah and
[1:08:02] she was incredibly
[1:08:08] beautiful God looked at you as
[1:08:14] beautiful God looked at
[1:08:16] you and saw something that the devil
[1:08:19] could not
[1:08:20] [Applause]
[1:08:21] see let's move forward in Chapter 30 in
[1:08:26] verse one and it came to pass that David
[1:08:28] and his men were come to
[1:08:31] zigg and on the third day the ambl kites
[1:08:34] had invaded the South and zigg and the
[1:08:37] smitten had smitten zigg and burned it
[1:08:40] with
[1:08:41] fire and he had taken the woman captive
[1:08:44] and and were therein and they they slew
[1:08:48] not
[1:08:49] any either great or small but carried
[1:08:52] them away and went on their way
[1:08:56] and so David and his men came to the
[1:08:58] city and behold it was burned with fire
[1:09:00] and their wives and their sons and their
[1:09:02] daughters were taken
[1:09:04] captive and David and the people were
[1:09:07] with him lifted up their voice and
[1:09:09] wept until there was no more power to
[1:09:13] weep and David's two wives taken
[1:09:16] captives and he says and Abigail the
[1:09:19] wife of nabal the the camelite I didn't
[1:09:22] read the first one don't know how to say
[1:09:24] it
[1:09:26] and David was greatly distressed you
[1:09:28] ever been greatly distressed yes
[1:09:31] sir for the people spake of stoning him
[1:09:34] because of the soul of the people was
[1:09:37] grieved every man for his sons and for
[1:09:40] his
[1:09:41] daughters notice these words but David
[1:09:45] encouraged himself and the Lord is
[1:09:51] God and David said unto Abel and
[1:09:56] amal's son I pray thee bring me a hither
[1:10:00] the
[1:10:02] ephod and Abel brought the thither the
[1:10:06] ephod to
[1:10:07] David now notice these words and David
[1:10:10] inquired at the
[1:10:12] Lord saying shall I
[1:10:16] pursue after this
[1:10:19] troop shall I overtake
[1:10:21] them and he
[1:10:24] answered
[1:10:27] pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake
[1:10:31] them and without fail I love God's
[1:10:36] words recover
[1:10:47] all now can we preach to you just for a
[1:10:49] little
[1:10:51] while
[1:10:53] Philistines amalekites
[1:10:56] other in other different types of demons
[1:11:00] fight on different
[1:11:01] ways the Philistines will fight you in
[1:11:04] the front scream at you make all
[1:11:06] different kinds of boast Bluff you do
[1:11:10] everything they can against you but all
[1:11:12] you need to do is pick up some
[1:11:19] rocks
[1:11:21] amalekites will sneak in behind you when
[1:11:25] you're away at
[1:11:27] War you're mighty in Valor and when you
[1:11:30] come home to see them you're home and
[1:11:33] all of the relationships will be
[1:11:37] destroyed now I want you to just think
[1:11:39] what's in your home it's peace it's love
[1:11:45] children relationships that God give to
[1:11:48] you Satan would do his best to destroy
[1:11:53] all of your friendships and your Rel
[1:11:57] relationships he would do his best to
[1:11:59] get in behind you and sneak and you're
[1:12:02] away at service on Sunday and on
[1:12:04] Wednesday and whatever times your
[1:12:06] services are and your prayer meetings
[1:12:08] are he'd like to destroy your
[1:12:11] home he'd like to destroy your life he'd
[1:12:15] like to become a
[1:12:20] squatter now remember brother bam says a
[1:12:23] squatter is a Satan is a
[1:12:26] squatter he don't legally own this and
[1:12:30] he's had 2,000 years to fuss whether he
[1:12:33] owns it or somebody else owns it but
[1:12:36] Christ came as a kinsman
[1:12:39] redeemer and he re redeemed it back to
[1:12:43] us but Satan possessed it but you know
[1:12:48] after a while this great fight's over
[1:12:51] and he'll be cast into the Lake of
[1:12:54] Fire
[1:12:57] but the HS of Salvation will come with
[1:13:00] Christ I love that part don't
[1:13:03] you now I want you to just notice David
[1:13:07] is a man that's on exile he's he's a man
[1:13:10] that is now fighting against enemies and
[1:13:12] he's winning war after War we know of
[1:13:15] many of the wars that he's won men have
[1:13:19] gathered themselves to be with him
[1:13:21] because they have a
[1:13:22] revelation that he's headed for to be
[1:13:24] the king
[1:13:25] amen Mighty Men will gather with him and
[1:13:29] you could talk about the three mighty
[1:13:30] men that killed hundreds and hundreds
[1:13:33] going to get him a drink we could talk
[1:13:35] about David picking up a rock and then
[1:13:39] men taking a hold of faith and going
[1:13:41] after those Philistines Army but he's
[1:13:44] been away at War and now he's away at
[1:13:47] War and the amalekites have come to his
[1:13:50] home and they just they they have
[1:13:53] they've made a decision
[1:13:55] we're going to burn his houses down
[1:13:58] we're going to burn The Vineyards down
[1:14:00] we're going to burn everything up but
[1:14:02] we're going to take that which is the
[1:14:03] most
[1:14:06] precious to him and we're going to
[1:14:09] possess
[1:14:11] it now you can imagine you've been away
[1:14:14] fighting the devils and you come home
[1:14:17] and now your home is destroyed now
[1:14:20] everything seems to be falling apart
[1:14:22] David just only few hours ago is a Great
[1:14:28] Hero he's a man on the way to being the
[1:14:31] king but now it's just not David's home
[1:14:35] that's destroyed it's your home that's
[1:14:38] destroyed do you think that the devil is
[1:14:41] just after the
[1:14:45] pastor do you think he's just after
[1:14:47] brother
[1:14:48] Brown he's after every one of
[1:14:52] us and if he could he would come and and
[1:14:55] destroy you at a moment's
[1:14:58] notice if he could he would take your
[1:15:01] life he sends his best allegiance of
[1:15:04] demons against you and God standing
[1:15:07] their guard over top of you Satan can't
[1:15:10] touch a hair of your head until he gets
[1:15:13] permission from
[1:15:17] God and God has a testimony service
[1:15:20] about you that you don't know nothing
[1:15:22] about you heard it about job
[1:15:26] listen more than just job God's had a
[1:15:29] testimony service he has a testimony
[1:15:31] service about
[1:15:33] you there's none like this Bride on the
[1:15:36] earth there's none like them and Satan
[1:15:40] begins to make challenges against it and
[1:15:43] begins to bring up things and and begins
[1:15:45] to bring different things up and look
[1:15:47] how they failed and look how but under
[1:15:49] the blood of Jesus Christ Our God don't
[1:15:52] see none of it
[1:15:56] but how quickly he reminds you of your
[1:15:59] mistakes last week two weeks ago months
[1:16:02] ago but if it's under the blood of Jesus
[1:16:05] Christ and you've truly
[1:16:08] repented not even God can see
[1:16:10] [Music]
[1:16:13] it not even God can look at
[1:16:16] it and if God can't so it see it why do
[1:16:20] we beat oursel up about
[1:16:23] it thank God for the blood of Jesus
[1:16:30] Christ don't get yourself your eyes on
[1:16:33] other people's
[1:16:35] mistakes it is Satan that'll point out
[1:16:39] failures you keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:16:43] Christ it's easy to stand and stand
[1:16:46] strong when you're when you're with a
[1:16:49] hundreds of people but listen when
[1:16:51] you're alone that's where you prove who
[1:16:53] you really are
[1:16:58] now you can
[1:16:59] imagine putting yourself in the
[1:17:02] spot you come to a spot and you're
[1:17:05] standing on the ashes of your
[1:17:10] house what a tragedy that it would
[1:17:15] be standing on the ashes of your
[1:17:19] failures standing on the ashes of your
[1:17:23] mistakes
[1:17:25] amen and people around you now become
[1:17:29] critics instead of warriors with
[1:17:33] you David was on his way to being king
[1:17:35] and a Great Hero but now he can hear the
[1:17:39] murmurs of L ston
[1:17:42] him it's because of him we've lost our
[1:17:46] family it's because of
[1:17:49] him all of this tragedy isn't amazing
[1:17:52] how Satan's will quickly try to turn us
[1:17:55] against one another that's
[1:17:57] right but that's when you've got to
[1:17:59] stretch your arms
[1:18:01] bigger that's when love has got to
[1:18:04] project that's when you've got to
[1:18:07] forgive that's when you've got to have a
[1:18:10] heart bigger than all the mistakes in
[1:18:13] the
[1:18:14] world that's where you show godliness
[1:18:17] like never before in spite of Satan's
[1:18:22] works even when you're standing in the
[1:18:28] ashes sure we pick up rocks but those
[1:18:31] rocks are not for one
[1:18:42] another they have followed this
[1:18:43] wondering

[1:30:39] state police you're also a deacon you're
[1:30:43] also my

[1:31:01] here but they were no blood kin they
[1:31:03] just happened to be in marriage
[1:31:05] situation but don't that sound
[1:31:16] funny you in the blue blue blazer right

[1:31:24] there believe you Daddy has cancer is it
[1:31:27] right heard that I'm not Discerning I
[1:31:29] just heard
[1:31:32] that now the
[1:31:35] devil has done some
[1:31:39] squatting where's his cancer
[1:31:44] at

[1:32:48] do not just to arrest the
[1:32:51] criminal but to get back the
[1:33:17] goods so you send the Holy Ghost after
[1:33:20] that
[1:33:21] death and it's a disease that you can't
[1:33:24] see you can't
[1:33:27] feel but the Holy Ghost goes after that
[1:33:32] thing the doctors are only treating the
[1:33:36] symptoms but by his stripes on

[1:43:33] fell when Adam fell that me the whole
[1:43:37] Animal World
[1:43:42] fell but it's only a temporary
[1:43:47] situation God just didn't take the Earth
[1:43:50] and throw it out into the zillions of
[1:43:52] miles away
[1:43:55] he just didn't kill every
[1:43:57] lion and tiger and
[1:44:01] bear
[1:44:04] vulture now they have fallen and they
[1:44:08] become
[1:44:11] Predator now they eat one
[1:44:15] another but God says okay I'm going to
[1:44:19] redeem the
[1:44:22] Earth I'm going to go take it
[1:44:26] back Satan thinks he owns it and God
[1:44:29] says I'm going to take it
[1:44:38] back you say well brother Ron how in the
[1:44:40] world is he going to do that well I'd
[1:44:42] say Noah's day give us a good
[1:44:45] example and you may have forgot the
[1:44:47] story but Noah Builds an
[1:44:51] ark he don't build it just just for his
[1:44:53] family he doesn't realize he's building
[1:44:55] a
[1:45:00] zoo Noah did not have the time to gather
[1:45:05] all of those
[1:45:07] animals but he had stood there and
[1:45:09] preached a
[1:45:11] message and believed a
[1:45:14] message and though that AR didn't look
[1:45:16] like it would float the message said it
[1:45:20] would the message said there was coming
[1:45:22] a storm and he was going to water the
[1:45:24] Earth cuz God said I'm going to take it
[1:45:27] back that's right then he came to a
[1:45:30] certain time in one of his sermons all
[1:45:31] of a sudden he begin to see
[1:45:35] creatures coming two by
[1:45:38] two are you with me God's creatures Amen
[1:45:43] brother Ron I can't explain it I don't
[1:45:45] need to explain it I just know it
[1:45:48] happened God had something on the inside
[1:45:51] of them that they travel for thousands
[1:45:54] of miles and step after step they made
[1:45:57] their way to
[1:46:01] safety you're going to have to do some
[1:46:04] walking but you just keep walking cuz
[1:46:07] you're walking toward
[1:46:09] safety storm's coming but it ain't for
[1:46:21] you two by two they gathered you know
[1:46:24] people begin to make fun and criticize
[1:46:26] he's preached 120 years about the
[1:46:29] message it ain't never
[1:46:30] happen look he's building us a
[1:46:36] zoo how did he gather all that got to be
[1:46:39] witchcrafter some
[1:46:42] way no it was God o
[1:46:48] d how did they do that God made them in
[1:46:51] the beginning right
[1:46:54] and whatever he made he still got
[1:46:55] control over
[1:47:02] it and just for a News Bulletin the
[1:47:04] Satan if he can look back a to that time
[1:47:09] Lambs
[1:47:10] lions tigers and bears were on the same
[1:47:18] Ark none was missing when they got off
[1:47:25] so God's got an
[1:47:30] atmosphere if you can get in his ark
[1:47:33] he's got an
[1:47:38] atmosphere you travel from all over the
[1:47:40] Earth to be here in this
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:44] meeting and Satan battles you and
[1:47:47] battles you and battles you but in this
[1:47:51] atmosphere
[1:47:55] all of a sudden you don't hate one
[1:47:57] another all of a sudden you love one
[1:47:59] another it's the
[1:48:02] atmosphere that atmosphere wants to just
[1:48:04] hover over you he wants to live inside
[1:48:06] of
[1:48:07] [Applause]
[1:48:12] you and God says now just to give you a
[1:48:16] projected
[1:48:18] Vision I go to prepare a place for
[1:48:21] you
[1:48:24] that where I
[1:48:26] am there you may be
[1:48:32] also he's talking to guys that are
[1:48:35] around him that are standing just feet
[1:48:39] away from him that loves him so much
[1:48:42] when they get the Holy Ghost in a few
[1:48:46] days they can't do it at this point but
[1:48:49] when they get the Holy Ghost in a few
[1:48:51] days they'll be willing to give their
[1:48:54] life and when it comes their time to be
[1:48:56] crucified they'll say Turn me upside
[1:48:59] down I'm not even worthy to be crucified
[1:49:01] like my
[1:49:03] Lord when they drag their head through
[1:49:05] the street when they cut them
[1:49:08] aunder when they pull them apart they'll
[1:49:11] never give up that's
[1:49:15] right now how many of you just be honest
[1:49:18] now how many of you have succumbed and
[1:49:21] felt the urge to quit
[1:49:27] while you're a preacher's daughter and

[1:49:32] quit you're honest you're honest raise
[1:49:36] your hands back

[1:49:49] friend and you've got thousands of
[1:49:51] them

[1:50:35] time Satan will make you feel like
[1:50:39] quitting now let me just clue you in on
[1:50:42] something Jesus felt like
[1:50:47] it father let this cup pass from me
[1:50:53] right he was tempted in all like manner
[1:50:55] like you and
[1:50:57] I brother Brandon felt like
[1:51:01] quitting what do you think he was doing
[1:51:03] in
[1:51:05] 62 when he wanted to go up in the
[1:51:09] mountains he wanted to quit pressure was
[1:51:13] too
[1:51:15] much but I got news for you tonight
[1:51:18] quitting is not in our
[1:51:21] DNA
[1:51:40] remember brother Brenham standing over
[1:51:42] his little
[1:51:43] girl he wanted to
[1:51:46] quit but just when he was getting ready
[1:51:49] to give
[1:51:50] up something on the inside
[1:51:53] of
[1:52:04] him you're not holding on he's holding
[1:52:08] on when you would give up and when you
[1:52:11] would quit he's got a hold to
[1:52:15] you sometimes you just need to turn
[1:52:18] loose and realize I got you that's right
[1:52:25] why don't you just raise your hand and
[1:52:26] say God's got
[1:52:32] me
[1:52:34] now you know after you get done dancing
[1:52:36] on
[1:52:40] ashes the instruction says
[1:52:45] pursue you remember yesterday I told you
[1:52:48] that you were Satan's worst
[1:52:51] nightmare

[1:53:08] shy after you get instructions from
[1:53:14] him you're going to chase him
[1:53:21] down
[1:53:24] you're going to chase it and you're
[1:53:27] going to chase it and you're going to
[1:53:29] chase it cuz he's got something that
[1:53:33] belongs to
[1:53:38] you you're going to run after him you're
[1:53:42] not afraid of him cuz greater is he that
[1:53:45] is in you than he that's in the world

[1:54:13] on now Satan in his memory he's
[1:54:17] stupid I guess that's okay to

[1:54:25] memory he forgot you killed a
[1:54:28] Goliath he forgot you killed a line and
[1:54:31] you killed a bear and just because you

[2:07:36] shirt with his left hand up in the air
[2:07:38] walking across the yard to a mom and dad
[2:07:41] that could not have children could not

[2:09:48] up if you're in the Lamb's Book he don't
[2:09:50] give up
[2:10:06] when your mom walked across the platform

[2:14:03] you but Satan was destroying my
[2:14:10] life but there was a
[2:14:14] blood that had already been
[2:14:17] applied and there was a Praying Mom and
[2:14:19] Daddy that believe this message with all
[2:14:22] their heart and they refuse to give
[2:14:35] up sister Rachel I'm preaching do you
[2:14:39] know God don't look at our temporary

[2:15:33] testimony now I come to the last lines
[2:15:35] of my
[2:15:38] sermon I was burned and laid in a
[2:15:40] hospital and the doctors gave up on
[2:15:44] me and God so healed my
[2:15:49] lungs he did such a good job job that
[2:15:52] not even the cancer can destroy the
[2:16:00] lungs doctors have testified if your
[2:16:03] lungs wasn't so
[2:16:07] strong the cancer would have already eat
[2:16:09] him
[2:16:18] up the burn was a horrible event what
[2:16:21] God was making way for the next
[2:16:26] trial I fell 40 ft and they said I'd
[2:16:28] never walk
[2:16:31] again doctor said you may as well
[2:16:34] convince yourself You'll Never Walk

[4:29:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we
[4:29:15] obey the Lord in water
[4:29:18] baptism you know I do this at Camp
[4:29:22] because some years

[4:29:31] know

[4:29:37] daughter to
[4:29:39] camp we drive 2 hours to church and a
[4:29:42] lot of times we don't make
[4:29:44] it and my daughter made a promise to me
[4:29:48] said I'll never go to a camp or be in a
[4:29:50] meet and and just follow the
[4:29:55] crowd but I if I go I'll go because I'm
[4:29:58] sincere I I I really made a start for
[4:30:03] God so brother Tim at that meeting at
[4:30:07] Youth Camp you baptized her in the name
[4:30:11] of the Lord Jesus
[4:30:13] Christ and I'll always be eternally
[4:30:17] grateful because today my 16-year-old
[4:30:20] daughter died in a car accident but I
[4:30:23] know where she's
