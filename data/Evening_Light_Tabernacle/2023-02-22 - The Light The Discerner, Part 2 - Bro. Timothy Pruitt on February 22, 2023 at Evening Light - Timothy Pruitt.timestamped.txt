[24:48] each and every one of you to the house
[24:50] of the Lord this evening those that are

[24:54] we want to welcome you to this service
[24:56] tonight each one's brought our licks of
[24:59] Fire
[25:00] and expecting that the Lord would do
[25:02] according to his his promise that he
[25:04] would meet us here this evening amen
[25:06] we're looking forward to the ministering
[25:08] of the word brother Timothy is going to
[25:10] come preach what the lord has laid on
[25:12] his heart and we're going to receive it
[25:14] as from the Lord amen
[25:17] we just want to go to prayer at this
[25:19] time there's several needs that we want
[25:21] to make mention to the congregation the
[25:23] Wilson family puts in a request for
[25:26] their nephew Matthew Wheeler he is
[25:28] having seizures so I want to ask that
[25:31] the church would pray for Matthew
[25:33] Wheeler tonight
[25:34] also to pray for brother Sarah Palais
[25:37] from South Africa he has a tumor on his
[25:40] stomach a blood clot on his lung the
[25:43] doctor said that there's no more that
[25:45] they can do because the cancer has
[25:47] spread into his spine most of all he's
[25:50] in need of Salvation so we wouldn't want
[25:52] to remember that need tonight
[25:54] we do want to remember especially sister
[25:57] Erica Parker tonight of course brother
[25:59] Ron Spencer but sister Erica is really
[26:02] really weak and in need of a
[26:04] supernatural touch that only God can
[26:06] bring medicine can take you so far as We
[26:08] Know
[26:09] but it's the Lord Jesus the Healer that
[26:13] needs to step on the scene
[26:15] for her today so we just want to
[26:17] remember those needs how many would have
[26:18] a need on your heart as brother Aaron
[26:20] would come and lead us in prayer tonight
[26:22] brother Aaron
[26:24] [Music]
[26:35] Lord when we come tonight humbly Lord

[26:54] heart we come just Overjoyed at the
[26:57] opportunity to once again be in your

[27:03] tonight Lord there not be one that would
[27:05] take this opportunity for granted Lord
[27:07] Lord an opportunity to worship you an
[27:09] opportunity to let the word changes in
[27:12] your presence Lord Lord even as as I was
[27:15] looking at some things today in your
[27:17] word recognizing that that father even
[27:20] seeing that the word is truth will do us
[27:22] no good if we don't allow it to wash
[27:24] over us and change us and and allow
[27:26] ourselves to be molded by the word of
[27:28] God and tonight we're asking that each
[27:31] one of us that all our barriers would be
[27:32] broken down our own self ideas and how
[27:35] we feel about things and we'll allow the
[27:37] the word of God to move deep down into
[27:39] our heart and and begin to change Us
[27:42] From the Inside Out father a
[27:43] supernatural touch that goes beyond any
[27:46] head knowledge or any knowing within
[27:48] ourselves but Lord that you come and do
[27:51] an incredible work in our hearts that's
[27:53] what we're looking forward to tonight

[28:14] just looking for a temporary
[28:15] strengthening Lord although I ask that
[28:17] that happened now but we're looking
[28:19] Beyond temporary Lord and we're
[28:21] believing that you are the Healer that

[29:19] the miraculous Lord not for our Glory
[29:20] but For Your Glory knowing that you are

[48:27] all things are naked and open under the
[48:29] eyes of him with whom we have to do
[48:33] amen we let you be seated this evening
[48:36] I'd like to speak to you again on the
[48:38] discerner
[48:40] amen I'm glad he's still the discerner
[48:43] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[48:45] I I'm glad to serve a God who knows my
[48:48] name
[48:49] and he knows my situations and he knows
[48:52] uh where I'm at and what what I'm
[48:54] dealing with amen maybe maybe sometimes
[48:57] we think uh you know different ones well
[48:59] we know different ones doesn't know US
[49:01] president of the United States don't
[49:03] know us or hardly knows his self but
[49:05] anyway uh
[49:07] he doesn't know our name he doesn't know
[49:10] um you know who we are or any of his
[49:12] cabinet or any of that but that that
[49:14] matters not doesn't matter that Kings
[49:17] doesn't know our name or or our great
[49:20] consent men considered Great Men of this
[49:22] time would know our name it matters not
[49:24] what matters is he knows our name and he
[49:28] knows exactly where we are in every
[49:30] moment of our lives and and I found that
[49:33] to be so very early in the in my
[49:35] ministry as I was with uh brother Danny
[49:38] steaming down in South America one time
[49:40] and down in the jungle and you know and
[49:43] you you get down in those places you you
[49:44] wonder sometimes if if you're forgotten
[49:47] and you wonder if God's thinking about
[49:49] you and and you hear about troubles at
[49:51] home you know my Papa butts was having
[49:53] some heart situations at that time and
[49:55] was maybe looking at surgery and was
[49:58] dealing with all kind of mind battles
[49:59] and not much I mean not being able to
[50:01] communicate at home very much or to home
[50:03] very much and and so I was there and and
[50:06] we found our self in this spot early one
[50:09] morning coming unannounced to a village
[50:12] I told you this story but it's just
[50:15] something that I I fall back on a lot to
[50:17] remember that God knows where I'm at and
[50:21] who I am and and so we found ourselves
[50:24] pulling off the off the river into the
[50:27] Little Creek bed as it were and and not
[50:30] knowing if this Village would even be
[50:31] there this this tribe of Indians and but
[50:34] really felt on our heart to go and here
[50:36] we we come to this place and and out of
[50:39] the Jungle steps this white-haired Chief
[50:41] and and here he was he's beginning to
[50:43] holler out and scream out and just shout
[50:46] and and just rejoice and as I would find
[50:48] out later that the Lord has spoke to him
[50:51] in a dream and an angel had appeared to
[50:53] him and said go to the mouth of the
[50:55] creek I have three white men bringing
[50:58] fire and it happened to me brother
[51:00] Daniel brother Jackie Benton that was
[51:02] there and and so God knew how many we
[51:04] were he knew who we were and he knew the
[51:07] time that we would show up amen we could
[51:10] have showed up any time that week but
[51:11] that man was waiting there for that
[51:13] moment why because the word is still the
[51:16] discerner he knows every detail of our
[51:19] lives and sometimes that gets lost in
[51:21] our human thinking and our human
[51:23] thoughts that that there could be a
[51:25] being or somebody that can know every
[51:28] minute detail of our lives but you know
[51:31] when the word is speaking you have to
[51:33] recognize that first it's God speaking
[51:36] you know it's very easy to just put it
[51:38] off as being well that's brother so and
[51:41] so or that's sister so and so it just
[51:42] said that but when you recognize God
[51:45] speaking to you them not only that that
[51:48] is God speaking to you but he's coming
[51:51] and he's Discerning amen your heart and
[51:54] your need not only is God speaking but
[51:56] God is speaking to you amen it's easy to
[52:00] know sometimes yeah that was a great
[52:02] service God spoke but sometimes we fail
[52:04] to recognize God was trying to speak to
[52:07] us God was trying to speak to me as an
[52:10] individual and I put it off on something
[52:12] else and he's there Discerning the
[52:14] hearts you know it's easy it's a very
[52:16] easy in in a meeting with a I mean you
[52:19] know a couple of hundred people sitting
[52:21] around you to say you know well that was
[52:23] just for somebody else or that was that
[52:25] was for them or that was for that over
[52:27] there but you know the devil is always
[52:29] trying to get you to miss your moment
[52:31] he's trying to get you to miss your
[52:33] service he's trying to get you to miss
[52:35] your time and you know we're we're real
[52:38] good about coming to church with a
[52:39] pitchfork right and we pitch it over
[52:41] here and we pitch it over there what is
[52:43] he doing he's trying to get you to miss
[52:45] when God is speaking directly to you
[52:48] amen he don't care if you recognize God
[52:51] it's speaking necessarily he doesn't
[52:53] care if you recognize God is speaking to
[52:55] someone as long as you don't recognize
[52:58] God is speaking to me and when he when
[53:01] he did when he does when you do
[53:02] recognize then he tries to to hinder
[53:05] your response to what God has said and
[53:08] he tries to make it to where you say
[53:10] well maybe I'll wait a little longer or
[53:12] I'll uh maybe next service or maybe next
[53:14] week or maybe maybe another time I'll
[53:17] talk to brother Tim or maybe another
[53:18] time I'll do this see Satan is always
[53:21] trying his best to hinder you in every
[53:24] part of your life and so if he can do
[53:26] that he can hinder you and then you'll
[53:28] very soon begin to discount it as be in
[53:31] God's voice you'll discount it as being
[53:33] something from God and you say well that
[53:35] just happened to be that way and that
[53:37] just happened you know we can
[53:38] rationalize all kinds of things in our
[53:40] mind but if we will if we were by faith
[53:43] realize God has answered and God has not
[53:45] only answered he's answered me and he's
[53:48] speaking to my heart he's touching my
[53:50] life and therefore I have a response he
[53:53] demands a response back to him amen so I
[53:56] I was just looking on this thought of
[53:58] our response and and brother Branham
[54:00] says in demonology he said they told me
[54:02] last night that I was speaking to a
[54:04] certain person and that person did not
[54:07] respond to the call he said now that's
[54:10] pretty dangerous that's pretty dangerous
[54:12] he said I watched the angels of the Lord
[54:14] when he's standing here he said I can
[54:16] feel him when he moves and I I feel it
[54:18] move over me and move from me and I
[54:20] watch and it'll leave me and it'll go
[54:22] somewhere else and it'll stand there a
[54:24] little bit and I can see it and it'll
[54:25] flash over and all of a sudden a vision
[54:27] will come and then I see a vision I
[54:30] watch what kind of person it's around
[54:31] there and I'll find that person then
[54:33] I'll sit and then I'll begin to speak
[54:35] that's what takes place that's what
[54:37] happens it's all in the spiritual realm
[54:40] he said but if that person don't respond
[54:42] it'll be like reading the Bible here and
[54:45] saying there's nothing to it and walking
[54:47] away from it
[54:49] Mercy if that person does not respond
[54:52] it'll be as though he was reading the
[54:54] Bible and says there's nothing to it and
[54:56] walking away from it so that makes it
[54:58] pretty bad so always be on alert always
[55:01] be listening always be watching and when
[55:05] he speaks you answer
[55:08] amen I believe that goes for every
[55:10] service amen if we truly believe that
[55:12] God through the foolishness of Spear of
[55:15] preaching can take a man and anoint his
[55:17] his life and anoint his heart and that
[55:20] gift of God on the inside of him he said
[55:22] well I don't know about that well I mean
[55:24] you either Believe it or you don't
[55:26] believe it amen if you don't believe it
[55:28] I don't know why you're sitting here
[55:29] tonight but if you truly believe it amen
[55:31] that God can take a man so then then God
[55:34] can take that man and anoint that man
[55:36] then I think we ought to have the
[55:38] responsibility that when God speaks we
[55:41] respond to it amen something on the
[55:44] inside of us responds it's a deep they
[55:46] calleth unto the Deep there's got to be
[55:49] a deep to respond amen there's got to be
[55:51] something God is looking not only to to
[55:54] speak he's also looking to see if you
[55:57] respond amen and so he said so my wife
[56:01] and brother Beeler many of them this
[56:02] morning was telling me about it that I
[56:04] was calling a man about his brother
[56:06] somewhere that is something done
[56:07] something wrong and so forth and that
[56:10] man did not respond to the call so that
[56:13] can't be helped now that's between God
[56:16] and the man the vision left me and I
[56:18] couldn't find it no more because he
[56:21] didn't answer so be watching and be on
[56:24] alert
[56:25] amen you said well I tell you what it
[56:27] would be wonderful for the prophet of
[56:29] God to stand here tonight and begin to
[56:32] call my my situation and call me out and
[56:35] begin to detail my life and and surely I
[56:38] would have a response listen you would
[56:40] have the same response to the prophet of
[56:42] God and discernment as you would have
[56:45] sitting here tonight with the word going
[56:47] forth and God began to talk to your
[56:49] heart you're either going to respond or
[56:51] you're not going to respond he said well
[56:53] I don't see how anybody could miss when
[56:55] God is calling out details and they can
[56:58] see themselves in scriptures well I got
[57:00] plenty of them here tonight that there
[57:02] was plenty of them that were missing it
[57:03] amen and if you was there sitting there
[57:06] and hearing it and hearing what would
[57:08] your situation being called out and
[57:10] there wasn't no response out of you to
[57:13] acknowledge it to say yes Lord to say
[57:16] Amen Lord to say so be it Lord amen then
[57:19] you are missing it
[57:22] amen amen you know uh you the brother
[57:25] Brown talks about the picture of Christ
[57:27] that went before he said to all pictures
[57:29] you know has to go before critics and
[57:31] and this critic came and walked up to an
[57:34] artist and called him by name said you
[57:36] have a most unusual picture of Our Lord
[57:38] I think that profile is perfect he said
[57:42] I think of him coming by night and a
[57:44] lantern in his hand that it speaks of
[57:45] him coming in our darkness in the night
[57:48] I think all that's wonderful and then
[57:50] him standing in his expression on his
[57:53] face anxiously waiting to see if someone
[57:55] will respond to the knock I think that's
[57:58] very striking but there's one thing sir
[58:00] you've forgotten your picture no matter
[58:02] how much he would knock you haven't got
[58:04] any latch for him to pull and be able to
[58:06] open the door and go in the artist said
[58:08] oh I painted it just like this for a
[58:11] purpose you see he's knocking at the
[58:13] door of a heart and the latch is always
[58:16] on the inside
[58:18] amen only you can open to him and he
[58:22] cannot but you have to open the door
[58:25] that's true you're the only one that can
[58:28] open up your heart's door Jesus may
[58:30] knock service after service after
[58:33] service but you have to be the one to
[58:36] respond
[58:37] come on somebody we can hear we can hear
[58:40] beautiful service and say wow that was
[58:42] such a picture of Christ he was standing
[58:45] there I've seen him in his suffering
[58:46] I've seen him there as he was knocking
[58:49] on the door and I I seen him there
[58:51] calling out for lost souls I'm sitting
[58:53] there calling out for needs and I've
[58:55] seen him doing these things but listen
[58:57] the picture also has you in it
[59:00] come on somebody it ain't just a
[59:03] preacher up here on the platform amen

[59:07] to God it is actually you that are
[59:10] moving the gift that's on the inside of
[59:12] him come on somebody it is you that is
[59:16] operating the gift that is on side of it
[59:18] Amen brother Brandon I'll get to it
[59:19] brother random talks about his own gift

[59:26] this is you operating the gift
[59:30] come on somebody is there somebody here
[59:33] ready to operate a gift of God and say

[59:40] heart I want you to touch my life I want
[59:43] to be moved by you amen not just on the
[59:46] Physical Realm but on the inside that I
[59:49] can recognize he's here and I'm going to
[59:51] open the door he's here and I'm going to
[59:54] invite him in to come in and sup with me
[59:59] amen we get the picture all wrong we
[1:00:02] think he's the only one in the picture
[1:00:03] no out of the preacher's the only one in
[1:00:05] the picture or this one's the only one
[1:00:06] no we're all in this picture

[1:00:12] amen so I want to get to I'm gonna go
[1:00:14] through a lot of these so bear with me
[1:00:18] he said there's a lady sitting right out
[1:00:20] here
[1:00:20] can't you see that light over that woman
[1:00:23] she's got gallbladder trouble
[1:00:25] she's going to miss it
[1:00:29] God help Miss small
[1:00:32] do you believe God will heal you of
[1:00:34] gallbladder trouble then stand on your
[1:00:37] feet
[1:00:40] come on now then stand on your feet you
[1:00:43] had more faith than you thought you had
[1:00:45] I did not know the woman that's God's
[1:00:48] grace there he said if we're strangers
[1:00:50] wave your hand I don't know you but what
[1:00:53] he told you is the truth raise your hand
[1:00:55] now if you have faith and go home you
[1:00:58] will be well
[1:01:01] I don't know what was it amen she was
[1:01:04] about to miss it even though her trouble
[1:01:06] was being called out
[1:01:09] amen might have been a lot more people
[1:01:11] in there that had gallblood or
[1:01:13] gallbladder problems
[1:01:15] chances are it's the way it is amen
[1:01:17] might be more than one person in this
[1:01:19] room it has a certain issue or a certain
[1:01:21] problem I know we don't all face the
[1:01:23] same thing but we all we it can be one
[1:01:25] or two half and it would be called out
[1:01:27] and she's probably thinking well that's
[1:01:28] just so and so or that may be somebody
[1:01:30] else but God was not willing for her to
[1:01:33] miss it
[1:01:36] um God was not willing for her to miss
[1:01:39] it so therefore he would gave her name
[1:01:41] and he called her by name
[1:01:45] Oh Glory to God he knows your name he
[1:01:49] knows your address he knows where you're
[1:01:51] at and he said now I need a response if
[1:01:54] you hear what I've said and you believe
[1:01:56] what I said stand up
[1:02:03] so I see a woman weeping
[1:02:06] wiping tears from her eyes she'll
[1:02:09] believe me as God's Prophet she's
[1:02:11] sitting right here in front of me God
[1:02:14] Will Make Her well I don't know you

[1:02:25] would be enough
[1:02:27] then told her where she's from so now
[1:02:29] we'd have narrowed it right down

[1:02:36] you're from Men in Louisiana well how
[1:02:38] narrow would it get that how many is
[1:02:40] from ending

[1:02:47] you're from 187.
[1:02:52] Joel 3 8. well that narrows it on down
[1:02:55] name but about three people now live at
[1:02:58] that address
[1:03:00] but then three people you could still be
[1:03:02] missing it
[1:03:04] but then he goes and he said hey she's
[1:03:07] going to miss it God don't let her miss
[1:03:10] it Miss Krueger

[1:07:08] said God always answers
[1:07:12] he said many times in the unexpected
[1:07:14] time in an unexpected place in an
[1:07:17] unexpected way
[1:07:20] very unexpected sometimes the way God
[1:07:23] will speak
[1:07:25] but the point is the way you're gonna
[1:07:27] where you're gonna ever gonna get
[1:07:28] anything from that voice speaking is to
[1:07:31] recognize it's God
[1:07:34] then if it's gone I have a
[1:07:36] responsibility to myself to remain alert

[1:09:52] touch not me she was 20 yards from me
[1:09:55] but she touched the high priest Jesus
[1:09:58] Christ just have faith and don't doubt
[1:10:01] and you can touch him
[1:10:05] because he's still the discerner
[1:10:08] he's still the discerner you want
[1:10:10] something from God then you start
[1:10:12] pulling on the gift of God saying God I
[1:10:15] have a need tonight
[1:10:18] I have something that I once spoke I
[1:10:21] have something that I I need to know I I
[1:10:23] have a certain situation
[1:10:29] amen just a few services that go hope
[1:10:32] it's all right sister Landon she was
[1:10:34] dealing with something and and she was
[1:10:36] just thinking about the story of Joseph
[1:10:38] I remember correctly and you know and
[1:10:40] and and and about the details and things
[1:10:43] and it wasn't even my notes and here I
[1:10:45] come and I go right down the same path
[1:10:48] speak the same words and the same
[1:10:50] thoughts in the same story go down to
[1:10:52] the details of it
[1:10:55] why because she had a need
[1:10:58] he's that kind of God and by her faith
[1:11:01] pulled that from the gift
[1:11:05] the gift is still in the body is still
[1:11:08] manifesting itself it's still touching
[1:11:10] Hearts it's still Discerning Hearts it's
[1:11:12] still ministering to needs it's still
[1:11:15] doing all of that it ain't the man it's
[1:11:17] the gift
[1:11:21] he said well I can't have confidence in
[1:11:23] the man well have confidence in the gift
[1:11:24] of God brother random said if you can't
[1:11:26] respect the man respect the gift
[1:11:30] oh I know we're so good to discern
[1:11:32] things and discern situations and we're
[1:11:34] you know everybody's a saw we can see
[1:11:36] him as a saw but you know the point of
[1:11:38] that story is not seeing everybody a
[1:11:40] Saul you make sure that you're seen as a
[1:11:42] David
[1:11:45] make sure the discernment is working in
[1:11:48] your life and you're not seen as the man
[1:11:50] who later killed Saul
[1:11:53] and then he died for what he'd done
[1:11:56] right come on now but be seen as a David
[1:11:59] you want to see everybody is so fine
[1:12:01] make sure you're as a David and say I'll
[1:12:03] not touch the Lord's anointing
[1:12:08] I have respect for the house of God I'll
[1:12:11] respect for the gift of God
[1:12:20] but you know how it is we we get we get
[1:12:23] all in our heart about somebody and the
[1:12:25] Bible says to go to that person
[1:12:28] so instead of going to that person we go
[1:12:30] to everybody else
[1:12:32] and you know what happens everybody else
[1:12:34] goes to that person
[1:12:35] you know what happens everybody else not
[1:12:37] not trying to be out of meanness not
[1:12:39] trying but out of concern they're trying
[1:12:41] to let them know that you got a problem
[1:12:43] but you know how they're letting them
[1:12:44] know through how their own discernment
[1:12:46] and their own filter and it may be
[1:12:48] completely out of what you really feel
[1:12:50] maybe completely ten thousand miles from
[1:12:53] the way you really felt and how you
[1:12:55] really said it
[1:12:56] that's why the Bible says if you have a
[1:12:59] problem with somebody go to them
[1:13:04] hey man well here we go
[1:13:12] by the way

[1:23:12] we see certain ages you know my goodness
[1:23:14] closer I'm getting to 50 the more I want
[1:23:16] to put on the brakes and
[1:23:19] ain't no brakes
[1:23:21] and now there ain't nothing that times
[1:23:22] the enemy it's a robber
[1:23:27] my wife sent a video to our family chat
[1:23:30] today of my little Katie dancing around
[1:23:32] as a little girl about Brook's age and
[1:23:34] doing Adriana dressed her up you know
[1:23:37] that was Adriana's live baby doll
[1:23:40] to dress her up and she was dancing
[1:23:42] doing this ballerina and it was all cute
[1:23:45] but to me
[1:23:50] makes you real melancholy
[1:23:53] to look back and see now she's not that
[1:23:55] little girl no more
[1:23:57] she's growing up
[1:24:00] getting her license God help us all
[1:24:06] it's a crazy time to be living in
[1:24:11] and you see yourself times moving on
[1:24:13] it's being robbed
[1:24:16] if you talk about something long enough
[1:24:18] you forget why you're talking about it
[1:24:23] it's the truth
[1:24:25] our minds ain't as sharp as they were
[1:24:29] and our bodies you know somebody says
[1:24:31] our minds try to cast checks our bodies
[1:24:33] can't cash our rights checks our bodies
[1:24:35] can't cash and it's the truth because in
[1:24:38] your mind sometimes you still think
[1:24:39] you're a young man and you want to jump
[1:24:41] off of this or do what you used to you
[1:24:43] can you can't do it no more
[1:24:46] it ain't there no more and I know you
[1:24:48] young strapping fellas like hi look at
[1:24:51] me I can dunk a ball I can do that just
[1:24:53] wait a few years
[1:24:56] like I said I don't know why I'm even
[1:24:58] going down this road but we're going
[1:24:59] we're having a good time just wait a few
[1:25:01] years next thing you'll know you'll get
[1:25:04] a little wife and you'll get some
[1:25:05] children you think oh they're so cute
[1:25:06] and next thing you know they don't grow
[1:25:09] it up and married and run away I what
[1:25:11] happened
[1:25:17] we find ourselves in these times
[1:25:23] we find ourselves in places that we
[1:25:26] don't like
[1:25:29] we find ourselves in situations we can't
[1:25:32] handle
[1:25:33] we find ourselves in moments that we
[1:25:36] can't do nothing about
[1:25:38] we got to have somebody who does and who
[1:25:41] can and who will
[1:25:44] amen so why would we try to limit God by
[1:25:47] limiting him in the way that he would
[1:25:49] speak and how he would want to anoint a
[1:25:51] minister and put a thought on his heart
[1:25:53] that may sometimes it may burn the hide
[1:25:55] off of you sometimes it may be nothing
[1:25:58] but a bunch of good butter and Salve and
[1:26:00] feel so good and the next time you feel
[1:26:02] like you got whoop one of them siding
[1:26:03] down the other but it's all for your
[1:26:06] good
[1:26:07] and if you'll take it as God speaking to
[1:26:10] you and God touching you and God
[1:26:12] concerned about you and God knowing who
[1:26:15] you are what you're going through and
[1:26:17] why you're in this situation how to get
[1:26:19] out of that situation and what you need
[1:26:21] to do if you need to repent repent if

[1:29:15] Mr Carr rise up right now and accept
[1:29:19] your healing Jesus Christ has made you
[1:29:21] well I've never seen you in my life
[1:29:26] but God had
[1:29:31] I get amazed
[1:29:34] I get amazed at just how sermons work
[1:29:38] to be honest with you
[1:29:40] you preach a sermon
[1:29:42] you know it's more than just for one
[1:29:43] moment some of them I've only preached
[1:29:45] one time many of them but there's some
[1:29:47] that you know that's for other places
[1:29:50] and you don't know maybe where or maybe
[1:29:51] sometimes God would drop it in your
[1:29:53] heart that you're going to preach at a
[1:29:54] certain place and then you'll go there
[1:29:56] and that's what you'll speak
[1:29:58] it's amazing how God does certain things
[1:30:00] and how it
[1:30:04] says Ruth likes to tell this we I'd
[1:30:07] preached here at home and me and my
[1:30:09] father and family all went out to
[1:30:11] brother Jeremy Shriners and and I went
[1:30:13] to preach the first service I believe it
[1:30:15] was there one of the services there
[1:30:17] anyway and I opened my scripture and
[1:30:19] read my title and Adriana you know it
[1:30:22] was it Adriana sat there and she went
[1:30:24] through a notebook and she seen just
[1:30:25] right here a few services or maybe the
[1:30:28] last service here I'd preached it so
[1:30:29] she's oh he's already done it I don't
[1:30:31] need to take notes boom
[1:30:34] foreign
[1:30:41] it's amazing how God can so tailor a
[1:30:43] sermon
[1:30:44] and then use the same thought and tailor
[1:30:47] it all over again
[1:30:49] to go another Direction
[1:30:52] what is it it's different needs
[1:30:55] it's different people that's been
[1:30:57] praying
[1:30:59] they've been seeking after God and
[1:31:01] they've been asking for a certain thing
[1:31:03] to be done or said or a certain part to
[1:31:05] be ministered to and God has tailored
[1:31:08] that service right to that moment and no
[1:31:10] doubt it to touch that need and touch
[1:31:11] many other needs and then you take that
[1:31:12] same sermon and you go hundreds of miles
[1:31:15] or even a thousand miles or across the
[1:31:17] world and go somewhere else and you
[1:31:19] preach it and you watch and I get amazed
[1:31:21] even the minister I'm looking at my
[1:31:23] notes but I see where it's being
[1:31:25] directed I see the the the the the light
[1:31:28] as it were of the anointing of God
[1:31:29] pulling me a different direction
[1:31:32] go down a whole different Channel and
[1:31:34] and hit on certain things that I didn't
[1:31:36] get to hit here or touch certain things
[1:31:38] that I did or if I touch the same thing
[1:31:40] they touch it in a different way what is
[1:31:42] it it is the discerner
[1:31:45] and he is to be tailoring it to who is
[1:31:48] sitting on the pew
[1:31:51] and who's been crying out to God and
[1:31:54] saying God I have a knee and I want you
[1:31:57] to be me this time I want it to be on
[1:31:59] this Wednesday night it's my turn
[1:32:03] and you know what he will design a whole
[1:32:06] service to come down and speak to you
[1:32:08] and call you out and say it's your turn
[1:32:12] it's your moment it's your time you and
[1:32:16] this is your visitation
[1:32:28] that wasn't he says a man very fine man
[1:32:31] sitting right there praying too what's
[1:32:33] the matter with that man that man has
[1:32:35] eye trouble he has a growth on his left
[1:32:37] side his name is Mr Bartlett you believe

[1:32:48] believe he said here is a lady sitting
[1:32:50] right here looking right at me right
[1:32:51] down the aisle She's suffering with a
[1:32:53] heart trouble I hope she don't miss it

[1:33:19] card in her hand but the lady is
[1:33:21] suffering and being it is it's the holy
[1:33:23] spirit that light hanging right over her
[1:33:25] she's got a tumor in her neck she's also
[1:33:27] got a fallen stomach is that right do
[1:33:30] you believe right now hey have faith in
[1:33:32] God you have that prayer card lay it on
[1:33:34] the floor you don't need it no more
[1:33:39] hallelujah hallelujah why was it it was
[1:33:43] faith and a gift
[1:33:47] faith in the promised word that God
[1:33:50] could bring it to pass
[1:33:52] see that devil
[1:33:55] he thought he would miss it then
[1:33:57] talking about this man there's a man
[1:33:59] sitting right over there he's got a
[1:34:00] tumor the tumors in his back I don't
[1:34:03] know the man I've never seen him he's a
[1:34:05] total stranger to me but when I sing
[1:34:07] that devil go out there that black
[1:34:08] shadow and I've seen it right over this
[1:34:10] way and it went to this one for Mercy
[1:34:12] they're trying to congregate around here
[1:34:15] Satan thought he would miss that or
[1:34:17] thought I would miss it but the Lord
[1:34:19] showed it to me
[1:34:21] foreign
[1:34:23] never expected to get dessert
[1:34:27] thought he was sneaking around going to
[1:34:30] cause a disturbance and a service ah
[1:34:33] no no the Lord knows where he's at
[1:34:36] he knows he's trying to get people to
[1:34:39] disbelieve so what would happen this he
[1:34:41] said you see that dark line going from
[1:34:42] that one to the other he said is that
[1:34:44] that trouble that cancer calling out to
[1:34:46] that cancer saying help I need help help
[1:34:49] me make them disbelieve
[1:34:53] come on somebody so you wonder why
[1:34:56] sometimes those weird feelings come over
[1:34:58] you in the moment right before your
[1:35:01] breakthrough because that spirit is
[1:35:03] trying to call call out to other Spirits
[1:35:06] amen listen I know Spirits no spirits
[1:35:09] I watched it too many times in a youth
[1:35:11] camp kids that don't know each other
[1:35:13] from The Man in the Moon can get off one
[1:35:15] bus and off of another vehicle from two
[1:35:17] different parts of the country in just a
[1:35:19] few moments they're best friends why
[1:35:22] because of the spirits that are upon
[1:35:24] them you look at them they dress alike
[1:35:26] they talk alike they're saying they have
[1:35:28] the same disinterest and service they
[1:35:30] have the same disinterest in being there
[1:35:32] matter of fact both of them probably
[1:35:34] didn't want to be there probably both of
[1:35:36] their mamas made them come and here they
[1:35:38] get off of one bus from another place
[1:35:40] and a band from another and they meet at
[1:35:42] a camp right in Louisiana
[1:35:46] Spirits are coming together why do you
[1:35:49] think in these Services the devil is
[1:35:51] trying to keep us pushed down
[1:35:56] he feels a little faith beginning to
[1:35:58] rise and he starts all in a help
[1:36:01] help they're starting to believe
[1:36:05] I need reinforcements help they're
[1:36:08] starting to get free help oh God oh if
[1:36:12] we could see in that other realm you may
[1:36:14] have been calling by for help but what
[1:36:16] was it it was that Spirit on the inside
[1:36:18] of you that was said help I need help I
[1:36:22] need help I need help
[1:36:26] and his voice did nothing but get the
[1:36:28] attention of God himself and he said
[1:36:31] there's that dark line going over there
[1:36:33] and it's going over there trying to
[1:36:34] congel together but right now there's
[1:36:37] one greater in the room
[1:36:40] Hallelujah that's one greater in our
[1:36:42] midst he said right over here is this
[1:36:44] man to this woman to my left over here
[1:36:46] there's there's this woman she's scared
[1:36:48] she's afraid she's got cancer
[1:36:51] she don't even know yet but she's afraid
[1:36:53] she's got it
[1:36:55] there's so much fear being
[1:36:57] pulled around in that room by those
[1:36:59] spirits
[1:37:01] she's very much shook up about it I hope
[1:37:03] she don't miss it
[1:37:05] the woman has tried for a long time to
[1:37:07] press her way in but she's afraid she
[1:37:11] isn't from here she comes from another
[1:37:13] city in the city that's smaller than
[1:37:15] this one that we're in this though it
[1:37:17] lays South from here it's side of a
[1:37:19] mountain it's Tucson that lady's name is

[1:37:24] healing all right don't be scared of it

[1:37:37] heart I'm afraid you're not catching it
[1:37:39] you're missing it I see it come to you
[1:37:41] and you didn't respond to its call
[1:37:50] how many times is our healings
[1:37:53] or victories
[1:37:57] been delayed
[1:38:00] because we didn't respond when he came
[1:38:02] to us
[1:38:05] say ah
[1:38:08] brother Brown testified it brother Matt
[1:38:10] I believe it was just tell him about it
[1:38:12] said he would he would have gave his
[1:38:14] heart to the Lord a long time before he
[1:38:15] said but there was a spirit that hung
[1:38:17] over him saying wait a little longer
[1:38:22] next service
[1:38:25] he'll he'll put a next service before a
[1:38:28] young person all the way to hell
[1:38:34] he'll put a next service before somebody
[1:38:36] that's needing a very a real victory in
[1:38:38] her life all the way till that thing
[1:38:40] takes them down into the grave
[1:38:45] he said you're missing it I see it come
[1:38:49] to you but you won't respond to it
[1:38:52] you didn't respond to it as soon as you
[1:38:56] do
[1:38:59] he says because that faith has to catch
[1:39:02] and you're getting your mind you're
[1:39:03] wondering if it's someone else
[1:39:07] and it's you
[1:39:09] listen to discernment here you're
[1:39:12] wondering if that's to somebody else and
[1:39:15] it's to you
[1:39:17] so it was coming to her and as soon as
[1:39:20] it would get close in her mind she'd say
[1:39:23] well I feel that but is that for
[1:39:25] somebody else
[1:39:27] and she wouldn't respond to it
[1:39:30] and it would move away you're wondering
[1:39:32] if it's for somebody else but it's you
[1:39:37] God don't let us put our blessing off to
[1:39:40] another service
[1:39:42] don't let us miss our moments our
[1:39:44] opportunities and God wanted to touch us
