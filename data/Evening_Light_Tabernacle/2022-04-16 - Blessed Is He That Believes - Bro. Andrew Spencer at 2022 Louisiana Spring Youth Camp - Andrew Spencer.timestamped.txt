[50:34] matthew chapter 21 verse 1 and before we
[50:37] before we read this morning
[50:39] well branham said in the ephesian church
[50:40] age he said he that hath an ear
[50:42] let him hear what the spirit saith under
[50:44] the churches
[50:46] how tragic
[50:47] that it is that the first age did not
[50:49] listen to the spirit
[50:50] instead it listened
[50:52] to man
[50:53] but thank god
[50:55] in the last age there will be a group
[50:57] rise up
[50:58] the true bride of the last day and she
[51:01] will listen
[51:02] to the spirit
[51:04] listen to the spirit
[51:06] in that day of gross darkness the light
[51:08] will return by the pure word
[51:11] and we will
[51:13] return to the power of pentecost
[51:16] to welcome back the lord jesus christ
[51:20] matthew chapter 21
[51:23] and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem
[51:26] and were come to bethpage under the
[51:27] mount of olives then sent jesus to
[51:29] disciples saying unto them
[51:31] go into the village over against you and
[51:34] straightway you shall find an ass tied
[51:36] and a coat with her
[51:38] loose them and bring them unto me
[51:41] and if any man say odd unto you you
[51:43] shall say the lord
[51:45] hath need of them and straightway he
[51:46] will send them
[51:48] all this was done that it might be
[51:50] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[51:52] prophet saying
[51:54] tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy
[51:56] king cometh unto thee meek and sitting
[51:59] upon an ass and a colt the full of an
[52:01] ass
[52:01] and the disciples went and did as jesus
[52:05] commanded them
[52:06] and brought the ass in the coat and put
[52:08] on them their clothes and they sat on
[52:10] him thereon
[52:12] and a very great multitude spread their
[52:14] garments in the way others cut down
[52:16] branches from the from trees and straw
[52:19] them in the way and the multitude that
[52:22] went before that followed cried saying
[52:25] hosanna to the son of david
[52:27] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[52:30] the lord hosanna
[52:32] in the highest
[52:34] and when he was come into jerusalem all
[52:36] the city was moved saying
[52:38] who is this
[52:41] amen john chapter 4 and verse 23
[52:44] brother branham goes up there and
[52:46] he grabs that matthew
[52:48] 21 he said what was it
[52:50] it was prophecy that was being fulfilled
[52:54] and that which was prophecy
[52:56] was just now
[52:57] made history
[52:59] and i believe that history is being made
[53:01] right here in this service today
[53:04] john chapter 4 and verse 23
[53:08] jesus saying speaking unto the woman at
[53:10] the well
[53:11] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[53:15] true worshipers shall worship the father
[53:18] in spirit
[53:19] and in truth
[53:21] for the father seek
[53:23] such to worship him
[53:24] god is a spirit and they that worship
[53:28] him
[53:29] must worship him
[53:31] in spirit
[53:32] and in truth may god bless his word you
[53:35] may be seated in the presence of the
[53:36] lord i'd like to speak to you today
[53:39] today from this text
[53:41] on blessed is he
[53:43] that believes
[53:54] he's been dying all week to take take
[53:56] that coat
[54:00] he literally died
[54:02] but blessed is he that believes
[54:05] this is him
[54:07] we realize that we are living in an hour
[54:09] when we look over into malachi chapter 4
[54:11] that that we realize that that that
[54:13] we're living in an hour of an hour of a
[54:16] great and dreadful day and truly as you
[54:19] look out upon the face of laodicea and
[54:22] the world that we are accustomed to you
[54:23] can see that it's a very dreadful day
[54:25] for the world that we're living in and
[54:28] but this is not the hour of the dreadful
[54:31] for the bride of jesus christ but this
[54:32] is a great hour and we realize that that
[54:35] we've got more we've got more criticism
[54:38] and we've got more doubters and we've
[54:40] got more skepticism than we've ever had
[54:43] but this is not the hour of the
[54:45] unbeliever but this is the hour of those
[54:48] that are blessed to be able to believe
[54:51] and this i know that we've got every
[54:53] critic and every every devil in hell
[54:56] that is staring down the church of the
[54:57] living god that is that is looking at
[55:00] her and seeing whether that she can
[55:01] handle the battle or not seeing whether
[55:03] she can accept the challenge or not but
[55:05] i want you to look as you as you saw
[55:07] last night their israel had been sitting
[55:10] up there on that hill for 40 days and
[55:12] they were listening to that boast their
[55:14] unbelief kept them up there on that hill
[55:17] but it was the faith of a little david
[55:19] that brought him down off of that hill
[55:21] it was not his unbelief that brought him
[55:23] down there it was his belief in what god
[55:26] called him to do and you recognize that
[55:29] that we are in an hour that this is a
[55:32] restoration hour where the heart of the
[55:34] children's have been turned back to the
[55:37] faith of the fathers and only the
[55:39] children will listen and here we are in
[55:41] that day where we are listening once
[55:43] again to the spirit of truth in this
[55:46] hour and brother branham would say that
[55:48] every man that's ever amounted to
[55:50] anything in life or a heal of beings has
[55:52] been a man who trusted him that know
[55:54] that he was the son of the living god
[55:56] the incarnate jehovah here on earth yes
[55:58] sir so if you're going to amount to
[56:01] anything in life young people you got to
[56:03] believe in something and if you don't
[56:05] believe in jesus you are in a perfect
[56:07] spot to be able to find him
[56:10] so well i'm lost as lost can be well
[56:12] praise god that means that you can be
[56:15] saved you say well i've been through all
[56:17] kinds of chaos just to get to this spot
[56:19] you are in a perfect p a perfect place
[56:22] to come to perfect peace and you are
[56:24] blessed to be able to be in the building
[56:26] you're blessed to be able to come to
[56:28] camp you're blessed to be sitting in the
[56:30] atmosphere of the holy spirit you're
[56:32] blessed this morning the bible said
[56:34] blessed is he that comes in the name of
[56:38] the lord jesus said when he was
[56:39] preaching his first first sermon up
[56:41] there on the mountain in matthew chapter
[56:43] 5 verse 3 said blessed are the poor in
[56:46] spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[56:48] heaven blessed are they that mourn for
[56:50] they shall be comforted blessed are the
[56:52] meek for they shall inherit the earth
[56:55] blessed are they which do hunger and
[56:57] thirst after righteousness for they
[57:00] shall be filled let's say that together
[57:02] for they shall be
[57:04] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[57:07] obtain mercy blessed are the pure in
[57:10] heart for they shall see
[57:13] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[57:16] shall be called the children of god
[57:18] blessed are they which are persecuted
[57:20] for righteousness sake
[57:22] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[57:26] blessed are you when men shall revile
[57:28] you and persecute you and say it shall
[57:30] say all men are of evil against you
[57:32] falsely for my sake but rejoice
[57:38] but rejoice and be exceeding glad for
[57:41] great as your reward in heaven for so
[57:44] persecuted the prophets which were
[57:47] before you brother branham would say in
[57:49] redemption by power he said you're
[57:51] always pointing at how wicked the world
[57:53] is getting he said but you fail to see
[57:56] how powerful the church of the living
[57:58] god is getting at the same time yes
[58:00] we've got every devil yes we've got
[58:03] goliath standing on the hill but you
[58:05] fail to see how powerful there's a young
[58:08] people in the house of the living god
[58:10] this morning oh she might be little in a
[58:12] flock oh she might be there maybe not
[58:15] big in stature but she's standing on her
[58:17] feet she recognizes who she is she knows
[58:20] what she is not so she knows what she is
[58:23] if you know you're a child of god you
[58:26] know you're not a sponsor satan if you
[58:28] know you were born in the fire you know
[58:31] that you are not going for the peace you
[58:33] are born for
[58:34] victory oh she might be little oh she
[58:38] might be in strangers it might be low
[58:40] enough but there is strength in unity
[58:43] young people it's not strength there's
[58:45] not strength in numbers but there's
[58:47] strength in oneness when you are in the
[58:49] same mindset of the holy spirit you
[58:52] watch what god is going to do in this
[58:54] service
[58:56] when they got up there in the upper room
[58:58] they were all in there with one mind and
[59:00] one accord and they got up there and
[59:02] they started seeking the promise that
[59:05] god had given unto them
[59:09] we say well i don't know whether it can
[59:10] be done for me jesus said with men this
[59:13] is impossible but with god all things
[59:17] are possible
[59:19] he said in mark 9 23 he said if you
[59:22] can't believe all things
[59:24] are possible
[59:26] to him
[59:27] that belief
[59:29] brother man i'm in the jehovah gyra
[59:31] series he said to believe the word
[59:34] is to receive the word
[59:36] and let it become life
[59:38] he said now god's showing there that he
[59:40] was confirming this covenant it has to
[59:42] be that way the church not an
[59:44] organization not a denomination but the
[59:46] individual and god has become the same
[59:49] spirit that's god's purpose in the
[59:51] beginning adam and eve was the same
[59:53] spirit
[59:54] so you recognize it's got to be the same
[59:56] life
[59:57] it's got to be the same power that'll
[59:59] make you a believer that'll make you
[1:00:01] that'll make you walk in the same
[1:00:03] attributes in the same words that he did
[1:00:06] again he said now remember the spirit
[1:00:08] comes upon and the spirit that's in the
[1:00:10] church the real church the true church
[1:00:12] god's church god's people the spirit
[1:00:15] that's in them
[1:00:16] is the same spirit that is on christ
[1:00:19] with a promise so you recognize that
[1:00:21] there's a spirit born people here that
[1:00:23] is sitting in the house of the living
[1:00:25] god their spirit they have the same
[1:00:27] spirit that jesus did they had the same
[1:00:30] life that jesus had but he said they
[1:00:32] have the spirit with a promise so you
[1:00:35] recognize that you are abraham's seed
[1:00:38] this morning you have you have the faith
[1:00:40] of abraham but you have the spirit with
[1:00:43] a promise and jesus brother adam said
[1:00:46] that that promise was that the works
[1:00:48] that i do
[1:00:50] shall you do also so you have his spirit
[1:00:52] but you have a promise he said well it
[1:00:55] can't be me abraham i want to tell you
[1:00:57] in your weakness it can be done for you
[1:01:00] you say well brother andrew you don't
[1:01:02] know where i came from and you don't
[1:01:03] know where i'm going you don't

[1:01:07] take a look at abraham's life abraham
[1:01:09] left his family abraham had to get away
[1:01:12] and separate himself from his brother
[1:01:14] from his nephew from everybody else but
[1:01:17] i want to say abraham i want to say just
[1:01:19] like sarah well just like when
[1:01:21] melchizedek when he was up there at that
[1:01:24] tent how did he know that sarah was
[1:01:26] sarah was back there in that tent how
[1:01:28] did he know that their name has already
[1:01:30] been changed it must have been the one
[1:01:32] that had changed their names
[1:01:35] how does he know how to talk to you
[1:01:37] today
[1:01:38] after you had a night like you had last
[1:01:40] night it must be the same one
[1:01:44] sarah begin to laugh me have pleasure
[1:01:46] with my lord and my condition

[1:01:52] sin all my life i battled unbelief all
[1:01:54] my life sarah

[1:02:23] ghost you will be set free
[1:02:28] sarah you are going to bring forth a
[1:02:30] miracle you're a part of the miracle
[1:02:33] when sarah laughed brother branham said
[1:02:35] that god god could have had a right god
[1:02:37] could have had a right to kill her right
[1:02:39] there because she laughed in his face
[1:02:41] but because she was apart
[1:02:43] [Applause]
[1:02:45] but because she was a part of abraham
[1:02:47] god could not slay sarah sarah let me
[1:02:51] speak to you stop trying to have your
[1:02:53] miracle through everybody else stop
[1:02:55] trying to have it through hagar stop
[1:02:58] trying to have it through the handmaids
[1:03:01] young people stop trying to put the new
[1:03:03] birth over on your pastor stop trying to
[1:03:05] put it off for somebody else
[1:03:08] stop trying to put it off on your
[1:03:09] neighbor or this one or that one sarah
[1:03:12] there's a miracle that's got to come
[1:03:14] through you
[1:03:15] young people there's a new birth that's
[1:03:18] got to come through you
[1:03:19] you will produce
[1:03:22] what you are called to produce
[1:03:26] god sent a promise and he had somebody
[1:03:28] that was willing there to receive what
[1:03:30] he had said
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:33] hallelujah
[1:03:35] there's a predestinated people that are
[1:03:36] in a spot to be able to receive the
[1:03:39] promise because god doesn't send his
[1:03:41] promises in vain
[1:03:44] god doesn't send his word in vain if he
[1:03:46] said he'd heal cancer
[1:03:48] [Applause]
[1:03:52] then there ain't nothing too big for
[1:03:54] erica parker there ain't nothing too big
[1:03:56] for ron spencer
[1:04:01] there ain't one devil in hell that can
[1:04:04] stand in front of the power of the
[1:04:06] church of the living god brother branham
[1:04:08] would say that if you've got a shadow of
[1:04:10] that power you can grow out and create a
[1:04:13] new world i ain't one to create a new
[1:04:15] world i'm simply wanting to live in the
[1:04:18] world that i was built to live in not
[1:04:20] the world of unbelief not the world of
[1:04:23] sickness not the world of stigmas not
[1:04:26] the world of complexes but the power of
[1:04:29] the holy ghost in the church
[1:04:32] of the living god
[1:04:36] oh blessed is he
[1:04:38] that believes
[1:04:40] this is him
[1:04:48] i'm gonna
[1:04:49] i'm gonna stack up your problems for a
[1:04:51] minute
[1:04:53] you don't know where i came from
[1:04:55] you don't know the star pass that i came
[1:04:56] from you don't understand the
[1:04:58] demographics of my family you don't know
[1:05:00] how we were broke up when i was a young
[1:05:02] person you don't know what my mother's
[1:05:04] been through you don't know what my
[1:05:06] father's been through and because they
[1:05:08] went through that it sent me down a
[1:05:10] roller coaster of emotion and this is
[1:05:13] what you got
[1:05:14] god ain't wasting his time picking out
[1:05:17] the wrong ones
[1:05:22] if god told you he called you if god
[1:05:25] told you he told you he didn't choose
[1:05:27] you
[1:05:29] because he knew that you would go down
[1:05:31] into pete he knew what rahab was
[1:05:34] he knew what she was doing
[1:05:37] he knew her career he knew what she'd
[1:05:39] been through
[1:05:41] but he knew what she would do with the
[1:05:43] word
[1:05:49] he knows what you'll do with this word
[1:05:51] you're not going to leave it down there
[1:05:52] and say it's with somebody going on it's
[1:05:55] for the days of miracles that pass
[1:05:58] the days of the pouring out are passed
[1:06:00] god knows what you're going to do with
[1:06:02] this word you're going to accept this
[1:06:03] word
[1:06:05] you're going to become this word
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:09] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:06:13] there's a people on earth that's been
[1:06:15] fellowshipping with elohim they've been
[1:06:18] fellowshipping just like abraham was
[1:06:20] fellowshipping with him
[1:06:23] he had communion with him he sat at his
[1:06:25] feet he fed him
[1:06:28] abraham i want you to know everything
[1:06:31] that you have need of i'm putting on the
[1:06:33] inside of you
[1:06:35] i'm giving you a power
[1:06:37] i've given you a power that'll make you
[1:06:39] produce what you couldn't do in your own
[1:06:41] flesh
[1:06:45] oh you can try all you want to in your
[1:06:47] flesh and you'll never produce this
[1:06:49] you'll never produce this message but
[1:06:51] what god has put on the inside of you is
[1:06:53] for you
[1:06:55] it's for you
[1:06:56] it's for you
[1:06:57] it's for you what god has put on the
[1:06:59] inside of you is capable of a body
[1:07:02] change
[1:07:07] i'll tell you
[1:07:08] your miracle is so powerful
[1:07:10] that kings will look on that and lust
[1:07:12] after it
[1:07:15] the kings of the world are looking on a
[1:07:17] young people that can live out this last
[1:07:20] day message and they're lusting after it
[1:07:22] you remember when abraham and gassera
[1:07:24] had went up there to to gorier
[1:07:28] now sarah
[1:07:29] if anybody asks you
[1:07:31] if anybody asks you you just tell them
[1:07:33] you're my sister
[1:07:37] don't tell him about the power
[1:07:39] don't tell him about the promise
[1:07:41] don't tell him about who we met up there
[1:07:45] and when the king of guerrero looked out
[1:07:48] upon her he did not look out upon her
[1:07:50] and say you know what i would like to
[1:07:52] have another woman in my kingdom
[1:07:55] he didn't say well i'd like to have
[1:07:56] another handmaiden in my house i'd like
[1:07:58] to have another dishwasher in my house
[1:08:00] this king had an expectation to make her
[1:08:04] his wife
[1:08:05] and god visited him in his night seasons
[1:08:09] and said if you touch her you're as good
[1:08:10] as a dead man
[1:08:12] [Applause]
[1:08:13] i'll say this that the king of this
[1:08:16] world has got an expectation that he's
[1:08:18] going to try to take the spirit of your
[1:08:20] womb and try to contaminate your womb
[1:08:22] with a serpent seed with unbelief with
[1:08:25] all kinds of things
[1:08:28] but god's got a promise over you young
[1:08:30] people touch him and your curse touch
[1:08:33] him you're good as a dead man
[1:08:36] his expectation was cut off
[1:08:39] you start talking about the expectation
[1:08:41] of the king how to preach right there
[1:08:43] had a preach right there the expectation
[1:08:45] of this king was wanting to demolish
[1:08:47] what god was building up
[1:08:49] the expectation of this king was wanting
[1:08:52] to demolish what power that you have
[1:08:55] he's tried to cram cigarettes alcohol
[1:08:57] pornography and all kinds of things in
[1:08:59] your life try to shut down the move of
[1:09:01] god

[1:09:12] brother on
[1:09:13] he's tried everything that he can to
[1:09:16] stop the move of god
[1:09:19] but his expectation was cut off
[1:09:25] his expectation was cut off
[1:09:28] but let me give you a promise proverbs
[1:09:30] 24 and 13 says that your expectation
[1:09:34] shall never be cut off
[1:09:38] what you walk in here

[1:11:05] substitute it for easy believe this
[1:11:07] brother round's a prophet hallelujah
[1:11:10] i believe it i i've got the pictures on
[1:11:12] my wall i've got the pillar of fire in
[1:11:14] my home i've got him sitting there in
[1:11:16] 1951 in houston i've got that i've got
[1:11:18] brother branham's picture in my wallet i
[1:11:20] carry it around i've got the token
[1:11:23] that's what the devil's wanting you to
[1:11:24] believe
[1:11:25] he's trying to give you a substitute for
[1:11:28] the holy ghost
[1:11:29] but jesus said
[1:11:30] marvel not that i have said unto you you
[1:11:33] must be born again there is
[1:11:36] no substitutions for it
[1:11:38] you must be born again
[1:11:41] [Applause]
[1:11:42] i know it's hard to believe but one time
[1:11:44] i was in school
[1:11:46] and
[1:11:51] i'll get you later
[1:11:54] one time i was in school
[1:11:56] and i'll tell you the best days of my my
[1:11:58] school career was when we had a
[1:12:00] substitute
[1:12:03] you knew when you had a substitute you
[1:12:06] weren't going to do no school work you
[1:12:07] weren't gonna have no homework bless god
[1:12:10] you was probably gonna watch a movie
[1:12:11] that day
[1:12:15] you weren't gonna have no schoolwork you
[1:12:17] weren't gonna have no homework basically
[1:12:20] you had the day off and when you try to
[1:12:22] take a substitute you're trying to
[1:12:24] pre-create a vacation for the believer
[1:12:27] but there is no vacations for the
[1:12:29] believers
[1:12:30] young people you already got a target on
[1:12:33] your back
[1:12:34] and a substitute will never work
[1:12:40] but if you got the real thing
[1:12:43] oh i ain't talking about some coca-cola
[1:12:45] i ain't talking about some gatorade but
[1:12:47] when you got the real tank when you got
[1:12:49] the main thing when you got the holy
[1:12:52] spirit
[1:12:55] hale don't know what to do with you
[1:12:56] brother phillip when you got the real
[1:12:58] thing
[1:13:03] you see that's what god's strategy is to
[1:13:05] do is to come and take empty vessels and
[1:13:08] fill them up brother branham said in
[1:13:10] oneness he said you were made with a
[1:13:11] place to empty out so that god could
[1:13:14] come and fill it up and god's strategy
[1:13:16] is to take empty vessels
[1:13:18] and shake the world with them and i'm
[1:13:20] looking at a bunch of earth shakers
[1:13:22] world shakers lay out of sin shakers
[1:13:26] and when the god of this bible becomes
[1:13:28] the god of your life
[1:13:31] hell better watch out depression better
[1:13:33] looked out it's your last day with me
[1:13:35] devil
[1:13:40] it's not blessed is he that disbelieves
[1:13:42] it's blessed is he that believes
[1:13:52] for you are the temple of the living god
[1:13:55] as god has said i will dwell in them and
[1:13:56] i will walk in them and i will be their
[1:13:58] god and they will be
[1:14:00] my people
[1:14:02] faith
[1:14:03] cometh
[1:14:04] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:14:06] god
[1:14:07] hebrews 11 6 says without faith
[1:14:11] it is impossible to please him for he is
[1:14:15] the rewarder of them that diligently
[1:14:18] seek him
[1:14:21] brother would say that perfect faith has
[1:14:22] manifested and identified itself in you
[1:14:25] as a substance and when there's when
[1:14:28] it's there there ain't nothing going to
[1:14:30] shake you from it
[1:14:33] there ain't nothing gonna shake you from
[1:14:34] me you can line up every depression
[1:14:36] devil you can line up every cancer devil
[1:14:39] you can line up every devil in hell
[1:14:42] but you'll not stop this move of god
[1:14:44] you'll not stop these young people
[1:14:47] you say well you don't know what they're
[1:14:48] going through let me just go ahead and
[1:14:49] prophesy you'll not stop these young
[1:14:51] people
[1:14:53] you better be careful brother andrew
[1:14:55] getting out there too far in
[1:14:56] pentecostalism and going out there and
[1:14:58] prophesied absolutely not they just took
[1:15:02] and tried to substitute what was meant
[1:15:03] for you and i
[1:15:07] this ain't mind over matter this ain't
[1:15:09] just speaking what you want this is the
[1:15:11] sovereignty of almighty god
[1:15:14] god knew what brother branham needed up
[1:15:16] there when he was hunting him squirrels
[1:15:17] he knew what hattie wright was going to
[1:15:19] ask for before she ever asked it
[1:15:24] he knew what you came into this camp for
[1:15:26] he knew what you'd come begging for he
[1:15:29] knew what you needed
[1:15:32] you're not gonna walk out here the same
[1:15:34] way you walked in here
[1:15:46] there's somebody in our midst
[1:15:49] that's bigger than me
[1:15:50] that's bigger than this ministry
[1:15:53] it's him
[1:15:55] blessed is he that believes
[1:15:58] this is him
[1:16:01] what that little blind girl
[1:16:02] up there in memphis what was she doing
[1:16:06] was she doing up there she wasn't

[1:18:58] victorious
[1:19:00] but you've got something on the inside
[1:19:02] of you that satan cannot handle when the
[1:19:04] god of the bible becomes more than a god
[1:19:07] of william branham that becomes your god
[1:19:12] hell don't know what it's messing with

[1:20:58] god he said my brother brandon said his
[1:21:01] eagle's eyes
[1:21:02] got filmed over
[1:21:04] and he got up there in prison and he

[1:22:07] show them that you're not walking the
[1:22:09] way you once walked because you got a
[1:22:10] hold of somebody
[1:22:13] but jesus said blessed is he that's not
[1:22:16] offended in me
[1:22:19] he said tell john everything's right on
[1:22:21] schedule i'm moving right into playing
[1:22:22] of god i'm moving right in here
[1:22:24] everything's working right according to
[1:22:26] it's working i know your eagle's eyes
[1:22:28] are filmed over but you can fly back up
[1:22:30] here
[1:22:32] but bless it is he that's not offended
[1:22:35] in me
[1:22:36] and today we live in a society of men
[1:22:38] that who are ashamed of jesus they're
[1:22:40] ashamed to call on his name they're
[1:22:42] ashamed to stand for truth they're
[1:22:44] ashamed to say that they're identified
[1:22:46] with the message of the hour but this
[1:22:48] ain't the hour of the unashamed
[1:22:51] this ain't the hour of the ashamed it's
[1:22:53] the hour of the unashamed
[1:22:55] for the bible said in job chapter 2 that
[1:22:57] i will restore unto you the years that
[1:22:59] the cankerworm and the palmer worm and
[1:23:02] the caterpillar and all those that are
[1:23:04] eating off but you shall eat and plenty
[1:23:06] and my people
[1:23:09] not the goofballs up there in washington
[1:23:11] not those bunch of hippies up there in
[1:23:13] washington dc
[1:23:15] but my people shall never be ashamed
[1:23:18] paul said i am not ashamed of the gospel
[1:23:21] of jesus christ for it is a salvation
[1:23:24] under those that believe
[1:23:31] the seal of pentecost is the believer's
[1:23:34] credentials
[1:23:36] it's your credentials young people the
[1:23:38] ceo of the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:23:41] your credentials your credentials to say
[1:23:43] that i am qualified to handle the task i
[1:23:47] am suitable for this situation
[1:23:50] so in other words i am here to do what
[1:23:52] only i can do
[1:23:55] ain't nobody else going to take your
[1:23:56] place ain't nobody else going to do your
[1:23:58] job but i am here to do what i do i am
[1:24:02] not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[1:24:03] christ i'm not ashamed of the moving of
[1:24:05] the holy ghost i'm not ashamed of these
[1:24:07] young people and their worship
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:12] brother branham said that there is a
[1:24:14] necessity of the return of the dynamics
[1:24:18] of the holy ghost
[1:24:20] it's a redistance necessity of this hour
[1:24:23] is the return
[1:24:24] of the dynamics
[1:24:27] it's bringing you back
[1:24:29] into a pentecostal experience where you
[1:24:31] come in contact with a living god that
[1:24:33] will not leave you the way that you walk
[1:24:35] in here but you are coming in contact
[1:24:37] with the person and the person is the
[1:24:40] message
[1:24:42] brother brown would say he said i'm
[1:24:44] afraid too many times we're getting the
[1:24:45] people to church instead of getting them
[1:24:47] to christ if i can get you to christ
[1:24:51] you won't need me to hold your hand you
[1:24:53] won't need me to pump you up
[1:24:56] you won't need me to stir you up you
[1:24:58] won't need me to walk with you you won't
[1:25:00] need me if you can meet him
[1:25:04] i'm pumping you up anyway i'm just
[1:25:06] preaching you to the word of god and the
[1:25:08] word of god will pump you up and it'll
[1:25:10] stir you up the word of god will move
[1:25:12] you into a condition to believe like
[1:25:14] never before
[1:25:24] well you're just stirring them up
[1:25:27] let me go ahead
[1:25:30] you're just stirring them up brother
[1:25:31] andrew you you brother donny brother ron
[1:25:35] y'all just stirring them up
[1:25:37] yes we are
[1:25:40] we're doing it the bible way though
[1:25:43] paul said stir them up by the way of
[1:25:46] remembrance so if i'm going to stir you
[1:25:48] up let me serve you up by the way of
[1:25:50] remembrance you remember that dirty
[1:25:52] rotten scoundrel that talked you into
[1:25:55] doing that dope and making that bad deal
[1:25:57] let me stir up your remembrance and say
[1:26:00] and do you remember when he was defeated
[1:26:02] at calvary let me stir you up one good
[1:26:04] time do you remember i was savior
[1:26:10] you ought to have been there so let's
[1:26:12] stir up the church of the living god and
[1:26:14] say he's still a champion he's still a
[1:26:17] mighty conqueror he's still a devil
[1:26:19] destroyer he's still a devil defeater
[1:26:22] and i'm still a serpent bruiser
[1:26:27] we're not going to leave one hook behind
[1:26:30] it's my credentials i'm qualified to do
[1:26:32] what i do
[1:26:35] shamgar was qualified to do what he was
[1:26:37] doing up there
[1:26:38] and he grabbed a hold of that when he
[1:26:40] grabbed a hold of that ox goat he was
[1:26:42] qualified to do what he was doing he
[1:26:44] said all i've been is a farmer all my
[1:26:46] life
[1:26:48] but i'm sick and tired of the devil
[1:26:49] coming in and robbing my joy and robbing
[1:26:52] my spiritual food in due season
[1:26:56] i'm qualified
[1:26:59] i'm qualified to do what i do and let me
[1:27:02] just work just for a moment
[1:27:05] i remember that my
[1:27:07] great-great-granddaddy abraham received
[1:27:10] a covenant with god
[1:27:13] and i am a circumcised israelite i
[1:27:16] recognize who i am and there ain't no
[1:27:19] depression there ain't no philistine
[1:27:22] there ain't no suicide spirit that's
[1:27:24] going to stop me
[1:27:25] going to stop my family it's going to
[1:27:28] stop me from doing what i'm going to do
[1:27:32] same door it's time you take your oxygen
[1:27:34] and start whipping the devil instead of
[1:27:37] taking a whipping from him
[1:27:50] it's a return
[1:27:52] of the dynamics
[1:27:56] when they got up there on the day of
[1:27:57] pentecost
[1:27:58] they were up there in one mind
[1:28:01] they were up there in one accord
[1:28:03] they were up there
[1:28:05] under one plan
[1:28:06] and that was to receive
[1:28:08] what god spoke
[1:28:12] that you after the holy ghost has come
[1:28:15] upon you that you shall receive
[1:28:18] power
[1:28:20] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:28:23] you shall receive power
[1:28:25] you see he'd give them a promise
[1:28:27] what were they up there doing
[1:28:29] they were up there believing
[1:28:35] let me let me just draw back for a
[1:28:36] moment
[1:28:38] what are you doing here
[1:28:39] you're here believing
[1:28:41] you're believing that all things are
[1:28:43] possible you're believing he's as good
[1:28:45] as his word you don't just believe he
[1:28:47] can you believe he will
[1:28:51] you have not walked into this camp to
[1:28:53] leave here
[1:28:54] as the ordinary young people you've left
[1:28:57] here
[1:28:58] you've come here
[1:29:00] to be a powerhouse
[1:29:03] brother burden said in the stature of
[1:29:05] the perfect man
[1:29:06] brother rham said that god didn't send
[1:29:07] me to build denominations
[1:29:10] he sent me to build individuals to be
[1:29:13] power houses to be abiding place by the
[1:29:15] spirit of the holy ghost
[1:29:18] let me say our young people cannot be
[1:29:20] built upon knowledge our young people
[1:29:22] cannot be built upon intellectualism our
[1:29:24] young people cannot be built upon
[1:29:26] psychology
[1:29:27] our young people cannot be built upon
[1:29:29] emotion our young people cannot be built
[1:29:31] upon they cannot be built upon feelings
[1:29:34] and they cannot be built upon dead
[1:29:35] religion
[1:29:38] and neither can they be built upon
[1:29:40] legalism because when you try to move
[1:29:42] legalism in you're only simply trying to
[1:29:44] confine their worship to the true and
[1:29:47] living god so if we're going to build
[1:29:49] them up on something that's built them
[1:29:51] up on the up on the most holy faith
[1:29:56] i'm looking at a bunch of powerhouses
[1:29:58] today that are containing the same power
[1:30:01] that was up there in that upper room
[1:30:04] they were up there waiting they were up
[1:30:06] there seeking they were up there
[1:30:08] believing
[1:30:10] and god was going to send an action to
[1:30:13] their reaction
[1:30:17] you're here believing you're here
[1:30:19] speaking and you're gonna get what you
[1:30:21] asked for
[1:30:22] he said ask that your joys might be full
[1:30:29] well i'll tell you what brother andrew
[1:30:30] i'm gonna fleece god
[1:30:33] i'm gonna fleece god just like gideon if
[1:30:35] god will let me have the front row in
[1:30:37] this camp
[1:30:40] i'll really do some dancing
[1:30:43] i really get the baptism of the holy
[1:30:45] ghost you might as well go ahead and
[1:30:47] surrender yourself
[1:30:48] because you're going to lose
[1:30:51] i'm going to fleece god if god will heal
[1:30:52] my mama cancer
[1:30:54] then i'll believe him
[1:31:00] if god will heal my daddy cancer then
[1:31:03] i'll believe him no you won't
[1:31:09] they did the same thing with jesus
[1:31:13] if you really did raise lazarus from the
[1:31:15] grave
[1:31:16] why don't you come over here we got a
[1:31:17] whole graveyard full of them
[1:31:20] really if you've got the power of the
[1:31:21] spoken word why don't you just speak the
[1:31:24] seed into the young people let me tell
[1:31:26] you you know how to get that dirty line
[1:31:28] devil out of your life
[1:31:32] i love that last time
[1:31:34] god dispersed those seeds
[1:31:38] and the holy ghost knows where that seed
[1:31:40] is god knows what you've been through
[1:31:42] god knows what peter been through god
[1:31:45] knew what mary had been through
[1:31:48] but they got up there regardless of
[1:31:50] themself
[1:31:51] regardless of their circumstance
[1:31:54] regardless if their favorite preacher
[1:31:56] was preaching regardless regardless what
[1:32:00] james did
[1:32:01] regardless what john did regardless what
[1:32:04] philip did
[1:32:08] make your way into this room
[1:32:11] make your way into this room
[1:32:13] everything you have need of is in this
[1:32:15] room mary
[1:32:17] mary you may have carried him at birth
[1:32:19] you marry carried him for nine months
[1:32:21] you may have fed him all your life you
[1:32:23] may have fed him and took care of him
[1:32:26] but now you're getting ready to receive
[1:32:27] something
[1:32:30] mary you're getting ready to receive
[1:32:32] something you pushed him out of you but
[1:32:35] now he's going to push himself into you
[1:32:38] because you had the faith to believe
[1:32:42] mary is the only woman that could say i
[1:32:44] got him back twice
[1:32:47] i got him twice
[1:32:49] oh i say god give me a double portion of
[1:32:52] your spirit
[1:33:00] and they took god at his word and
[1:33:02] brother branham said it's a death
[1:33:03] structure satan when man begins to take
[1:33:06] god at his word let's send a death
[1:33:09] stroke down to hell today
[1:33:12] god i come here for one purpose and that
[1:33:14] was for you i didn't come here to be
[1:33:16] seen i didn't come here to be felt i
[1:33:18] didn't come here to get emotional i come
[1:33:20] here to get you i come here to take you
[1:33:22] at your word
[1:33:27] you're gonna walk out of here blessed
[1:33:30] bless
[1:33:31] if you believe
[1:33:35] we need a repeat
[1:33:37] of pentecost
[1:33:39] let me give you some quotes
[1:33:41] so you don't think i'm just preaching
[1:33:42] for my intellect don't worry i ain't
[1:33:44] gotten on that anyway
[1:33:50] if he can only get away get you away
[1:33:52] from the doubters that say all the days
[1:33:55] of miracles has passed if he could ever
[1:33:57] get you away from the people that says
[1:33:59] there is no more feeling of religion the
[1:34:02] heartfelt religion that your father's
[1:34:03] bled on the battlefield for there's
[1:34:05] nothing to it if he can ever get you
[1:34:07] alone one time and all your ideas shut
[1:34:09] outside he could get
[1:34:11] if he could ever get a group of people
[1:34:13] together like that there would be a
[1:34:15] repeat
[1:34:16] of pentecost he said in the message here
[1:34:19] ye him he said if we can only have
[1:34:21] obedience to those three words you'll
[1:34:24] see
[1:34:25] a repeat of pentecost in this building
[1:34:29] he said if you're without the holy ghost
[1:34:31] today this might be the very time where
[1:34:34] god will repeat pentecost again
[1:34:37] in another few minutes from now this
[1:34:38] building may be illuminated with the
[1:34:40] power of the god people going out of
[1:34:42] here with the baptism
[1:34:44] of the holy spirit i put an amen behind
[1:34:47] it
[1:34:48] he said if he said it could be possible
[1:34:50] tonight and also probable that it would
[1:34:53] be there could be an hour or this next
[1:34:54] hour on that clock there wouldn't be one
[1:34:57] center or one backslider left it here
[1:35:00] without being right with god it could be
[1:35:02] that every sick and afflicted person
[1:35:04] could be made well and go out of here
[1:35:06] glorifying god
[1:35:08] this could break into a repeat of
[1:35:12] pentecost if the atmosphere gets right
[1:35:16] he said the atmosphere to bring such
[1:35:18] results would be the holy spirit he said
[1:35:21] if he can ever get a heart every heart
[1:35:23] and one accord then he could just move
[1:35:25] masses and heal the people and save the
[1:35:27] people or whatever he has died to redeem
[1:35:29] them and every redemptive blessing
[1:35:32] belongs to the individual
[1:35:34] i want you
[1:35:36] to believe
[1:35:37] that christian
[1:35:40] this could break
[1:35:42] into the atmosphere
[1:35:44] and be a repeat of pentecost
[1:35:48] brother brown said he said it's the
[1:35:49] hardest thing to do is to get people in
[1:35:52] the atmosphere to believe
[1:35:55] he said but it's also an atmosphere like
[1:35:57] this that eagles are born in
[1:36:00] and you watch
[1:36:01] up there in that upper room they got up
[1:36:03] there and what was born it wasn't a
[1:36:05] bunch of chickens that were born it was
[1:36:07] a bunch of eagles that were born and
[1:36:09] when they jumped out of there they were
[1:36:11] scared in one scripture brother branham
[1:36:13] breaks into that upper room he walks up
[1:36:16] there and he said he walks up there he
[1:36:18] walks up the outside of those steps and
[1:36:20] goes up in their upper room and there's
[1:36:21] a lamp in that room he said they were up
[1:36:24] there he said they were not kneeling he
[1:36:26] said they were sitting and all of a
[1:36:28] sudden the holy ghost sat on them
[1:36:30] and they began to speak in other
[1:36:32] languages
[1:36:34] here peter was a jew but he come out
[1:36:36] speaking galilean and they said how do
[1:36:39] we hear every man in our own language
[1:36:43] these must be drunk and peter stood up
[1:36:46] and said these young people ain't drunk
[1:36:48] as you suppose but this is that that was
[1:36:51] prophesied by the prophet joel and what
[1:36:54] they were watching out there on the
[1:36:56] street was the effects of pentecost
[1:37:00] what you're watching in your young
[1:37:02] people is the effects of pentecost
[1:37:05] you know they weren't known as
[1:37:06] pentecostal those 120 that went up here
[1:37:09] in that upper room they were not known
[1:37:11] as we would call them pentecostal until
[1:37:13] the event of his coming
[1:37:15] you are not known as message believers
[1:37:17] until the event of his coming and this
[1:37:20] is him that has come down you're not
[1:37:22] just known as a bunch of other church
[1:37:23] goers as another group but you're known
[1:37:26] as a final voice to the final h you're
[1:37:28] known as serpent bruisers you're known
[1:37:31] as a real true church of the living god
[1:37:34] you're not a church no more i'll call
[1:37:36] you bright so you understand it
[1:37:41] ah just settle them down all right
[1:37:44] if these be quiet
[1:37:48] go up there and luke and start riding
[1:37:50] with jesus on that donkey one good time
[1:37:53] and those pharisees said why don't you
[1:37:55] quiet them young people
[1:37:57] why don't you shut down the move of god
[1:38:00] can i give you jesus one for a moment if
[1:38:02] these don't cry out the rocks will cry
[1:38:05] out

[1:38:13] i never seen erotica cry in my place
[1:38:17] and i ain't gonna let one cry now

[1:39:52] i'm afraid that's what we've got today
[1:39:54] is a bunch of secret service worshipers
[1:39:57] they're afraid to be seen worshipping
[1:40:00] they're afraid to be seen praising
[1:40:01] they're afraid to be seen speaking in
[1:40:03] talks they're afraid of their new birth

[1:40:26] i ain't no secret service worshiper
[1:40:29] i ain't afraid to get caught
[1:40:33] they tried to shut blind bartimaeus down
[1:40:36] but he said even so david

[1:40:41] he's already passed you
[1:40:44] he come by here on friday night he's
[1:40:45] already past you

[1:40:49] he's already paid you've already passed
[1:40:50] your moment
[1:40:52] you were born that way you were born
[1:40:54] with fat disease you were born with that
[1:40:57] depression you were born with that
[1:40:58] eyesight
[1:41:02] put blessing are your eyes for you have

[1:41:24] you can sit there
[1:41:26] and your blindness all you want to and i

[1:41:34] this ain't brother donnie this ain't
[1:41:36] brother tim's emotions this ain't
[1:41:38] brother tim's desire this is the holy
[1:41:40] ghost desire what made brother tim
[1:41:43] desire to have this camp over 30 some
[1:41:45] years
[1:41:46] it wasn't his own ego
[1:41:51] oh let me just go ahead and cut him off
[1:41:53] it wasn't his ego it wasn't because he
[1:41:55] wanted to be a big name preacher he had
[1:41:57] a desire for young people
[1:42:01] to get the same power that he watched in
[1:42:04] william branham be exuberated in the
[1:42:07] church of a living god
[1:42:16] he's already passed you young boy

[1:42:37] if you've been blind like i've been
[1:42:38] blind
[1:42:40] sometimes you will not get your blessing
[1:42:44] until you start acting like you were
[1:42:46] born to act
[1:42:53] if blind bartimaeus would have stayed
[1:42:55] better in that condition if he'd have
[1:42:57] stayed there in that spot
[1:42:59] if he were to listen to the crowd if he
[1:43:01] will listen to the naysayers
[1:43:04] some blessings you will not get until
[1:43:06] you start acting like a pentecostal hey

[1:43:29] your voice malachi god's wanting your
[1:43:32] voice titus god's wanting your voice
[1:43:34] nathan god's wanting your voice young
[1:43:36] girl
[1:43:39] if god ain't done nothing for you you
[1:43:42] still ought to be able to praise him
[1:43:46] you still ought to be saying thank you
[1:43:48] lord but let me have a moment with you
[1:43:53] but because you ain't never been through
[1:43:54] a battle and because you ain't never
[1:43:56] faced something you ain't never had to
[1:43:58] cry out but i've had to cry
[1:44:03] i've had to beg i've had to ask i've had
[1:44:06] to seek him i've had to ask god
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:12] i can't handle this on my own
[1:44:15] i'm only asking that you believe me
[1:44:19] i'm only asking that you believe me
[1:44:26] free
[1:44:29] forever
[1:44:31] bartimaeus you're not walking back to
[1:44:33] that hole no more
[1:44:35] you're not gonna sit there no more
[1:44:38] you're free
[1:44:39] you're free the son of man's looking on
[1:44:41] you you're free and when the sun is set
[1:44:44] free it's free indeed don't you worry
[1:44:47] about it no more don't you feel with
[1:44:49] that no more
[1:44:51] what you battle through
[1:44:53] what's a victory
[1:44:55] don't let the devil try to talk you back
[1:44:57] into that defeat no more i brought you
[1:45:00] to this hour for such a time as this
[1:45:03] your name is not defeat your name is
[1:45:05] victory your name is not suicide your
[1:45:08] name is not depression your name is a
[1:45:11] child of the most high god
[1:45:14] you docked thou spirit of hell i rebuke
[1:45:17] you in the name of jesus christ
[1:45:30] god knows where he can put this power at
[1:45:31] by the way
[1:45:37] jesus said you try to put this you try
[1:45:39] to put this wine and no bottles it'll
[1:45:41] blow up
[1:45:42] he knows where he can put it at
[1:45:46] you see god
[1:45:48] has built the mechanics in such a way
[1:45:50] that it can handle the dynamics when it
[1:45:52] comes
[1:45:55] you try to put rocket power on the
[1:45:57] inside of a pinto that baby's gonna blow
[1:45:59] up
[1:46:03] my wife drives like that sometimes
[1:46:04] thinking she's got rocket power or she
[1:46:06] tries to move like she's in that other
[1:46:08] dimension already like a thought
[1:46:10] akin to richard petty from north
[1:46:12] carolina
[1:46:15] baby hold on i ain't got enough
[1:46:17] insurance to cover that rocket
[1:46:20] come back down here in this forward for
[1:46:22] a minute
[1:46:25] god didn't put rocket power on the
[1:46:27] inside
[1:46:29] of a ford
[1:46:30] because he knew he couldn't handle it
[1:46:34] god didn't put rocket power on the
[1:46:36] inside of the methodist because they
[1:46:38] knew that they couldn't get no higher
[1:46:40] than the horse and buggy
[1:46:42] god didn't put rocket power on the
[1:46:45] inside of the westlands because they
[1:46:47] knew they could only drive an automobile
[1:46:51] god didn't put rocket power on the
[1:46:53] inside of pentecost as a restoration of
[1:46:56] guests but he put rocket power in
[1:46:58] astronauts
[1:47:00] that were born to live up here and born
[1:47:03] to move in a dimension that they would
[1:47:05] live built to live in you had the
[1:47:07] capacity young people to move into the
[1:47:10] holy ghost and to move into a spot where
[1:47:13] the church of the living god was
[1:47:15] destined to move in
[1:47:17] you were built for this moment you were
[1:47:19] built with the capacity
[1:47:22] brother branham said that here's the
[1:47:24] easter message the mechanics and the
[1:47:27] dynamics
[1:47:28] are together
[1:47:30] they're together in this building
[1:47:32] they're together in this moment they're
[1:47:34] together here in the house
[1:47:40] blessing is he that believes
[1:47:42] this is a return of the dynamics
[1:47:58] come to a close
[1:48:01] brother america preach is a powerful
[1:48:02] series in 1959 on the holy ghost
[1:48:07] what is the holy ghost
[1:48:09] and what was the holy ghost given for
[1:48:12] and then he preaches
[1:48:14] questions and answers
[1:48:15] on the holy ghost
[1:48:17] i admonish you to go listen to it
[1:48:19] it'll do you some good
[1:48:22] laurel baron comes in there and question
[1:48:24] answers on the holy ghost
[1:48:26] and he goes in there and you go listen
[1:48:28] to it you verify what i'm saying
[1:48:31] and he said
[1:48:32] he said
[1:48:33] there were two things that came behind
[1:48:35] it
[1:48:36] to vindicate what i was saying
[1:48:38] there was a tongue and interpretation
[1:48:40] that broke out
[1:48:42] and he said it vindicated the message
[1:48:43] that was brought forth
[1:48:46] he said
[1:48:47] and there they were saying
[1:48:49] blessed is he
[1:48:51] that comes in the name of the lord and
[1:48:53] he said something caught me real quick
[1:48:55] and said otherwise blessed is he that
[1:48:59] believes this is him
[1:49:02] and he said there my sister dolores was
[1:49:05] sitting there
[1:49:06] and he said

[1:52:25] he was already committed
[1:52:27] let me tell you once you get the rock in
[1:52:29] your hand you're already committed
[1:52:34] the book of psalms says
[1:52:36] that when i'm overwhelmed i will run to
[1:52:38] the rock
[1:52:42] when you get the rock out of your hand
[1:52:43] you're already committed
[1:52:48] david didn't ask himself you know what
[1:52:51] that's my favorite rock
[1:52:56] you know i was out there in alabama and
[1:52:58] i was i was out there in that mud puddle
[1:53:00] and i was digging for frogs and i found
[1:53:02] this rock it's my favorite rock
[1:53:06] i'm afraid to lose it
[1:53:08] david you should have never pulled it
[1:53:09] out your script back
[1:53:14] i was listening to the great warrior
[1:53:15] david the other day
[1:53:16] and brother brahm said he he would take
[1:53:18] that he'd take that script back had that
[1:53:20] medicine in there he had a little honey
[1:53:22] in there
[1:53:24] had a little honey in there
[1:53:26] and he said with no sheep because he was
[1:53:28] a shepherd he'd take that honey and he'd
[1:53:30] pour it on that limestone rock
[1:53:33] and those sheep go to licking on that
[1:53:34] rock and they'd get the nutrients from
[1:53:35] that rock
[1:53:37] brother baron said when david put those
[1:53:39] rocks down in that script bag when he
[1:53:41] pulled it out it had honey all over it
[1:53:45] had honey all over
[1:53:46] brother branham said

[1:54:06] favorite rock
[1:54:08] but i am committed
[1:54:11] i'm committed
[1:54:13] god knew when he chose me i'd be
[1:54:15] somebody and be committed to tearing
[1:54:18] every devil down
[1:54:20] telling our young people you won't live
[1:54:22] in defeat you won't go down to feed it
[1:54:24] [Applause]
[1:54:34] do i hold this for myself
[1:54:40] and keep all this joy
[1:54:42] for myself
[1:54:47] you know i was back there on the desert
[1:54:48] and i found out how to use this thing
[1:54:51] it was the same rock
[1:54:53] i could tell you it was the same rock
[1:54:56] that took out a bear it still got blood
[1:54:59] on it
[1:55:03] it was this rocket took down a line
[1:55:07] now i'm just using this for emotion i'm
[1:55:10] just using it for that just to gear it
[1:55:11] just for a moment because we know david
[1:55:13] walked down in that valley and grabbed
[1:55:14] him rocks
[1:55:15] but i ain't talking about a rock i'm
[1:55:18] talking about you
[1:55:20] it was the same rock
[1:55:22] that killed depression
[1:55:24] it was this same rock that killed that
[1:55:26] suicide spirit
[1:55:28] it was the same rock
[1:55:30] it was the same rock
[1:55:33] that said i'm sick and tired of living
[1:55:35] with a pornography demon on my life i'm
[1:55:37] sick and tired of lust i'm sick and
[1:55:39] tired of the power of hell
[1:55:42] do i keep this rock for myself or do i
[1:55:45] let loose
[1:55:48] do i let loose
[1:55:51] do i let it loose and free all the
[1:55:53] children of god
[1:55:56] paul said in romans 8 that this is the
[1:55:59] liberty of the children of god it's time
[1:56:02] young people that you let your rock
[1:56:04] loose for a moment
[1:56:06] let yourself loose
[1:56:13] blessed to see you that believes
[1:56:14] [Applause]
[1:56:18] it won't be unbelief that defeats cancer
[1:56:22] it won't be unbelief that defeats your
[1:56:24] enemy
[1:56:25] but it'll be your faith in the most high
[1:56:26] god
[1:56:30] when that mother
[1:56:32] that little mexico woman
[1:56:35] i didn't let the musicians come
[1:56:38] when that little mexican woman
[1:56:41] her little baby had died early that
[1:56:42] morning
[1:56:47] she said i got to get somebody
[1:56:49] that's higher than me
[1:56:58] she went through the water
[1:57:00] with a dead baby
[1:57:02] she went through trials with a dead baby
[1:57:06] all day long she'd been carrying this
[1:57:08] thing
[1:57:09] a dead baby
[1:57:12] another said you know what you might as
[1:57:14] well just bury it
[1:57:18] it ain't for you
[1:57:20] you can't have it
[1:57:26] it'll never come to life again
[1:57:32] but something on the inside of her
[1:57:35] it was a
[1:57:36] paradox it was unbelievable but it was
[1:57:39] true
[1:57:40] she believed
[1:57:43] here she was a catholic woman with this
[1:57:46] type of faith
[1:57:50] what about you to do today
[1:57:55] you said here
[1:57:56] under the greatest ministry that's ever
[1:57:58] been released
[1:58:00] what are you do today
[1:58:03] with your faith
[1:58:06] will you sit there
[1:58:08] and pity yourself
[1:58:10] for everything you've been through
[1:58:12] or will you sit there and get up
[1:58:17] it's been easy to go ahead and marry
[1:58:20] it'd have been easy
[1:58:21] pushed her
[1:58:24] to get into the presence
[1:58:33] it was an unbelief that got her there
[1:58:36] it was an unbelief that made her push
[1:58:38] through 300 ushers
[1:58:42] it wasn't her unbelief that caused the
[1:58:43] vision brother tim
[1:58:46] it wasn't
[1:58:48] it was a faith
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:58:59] it's a paradox why you're even in the
[1:59:01] building
[1:59:02] why are you here
[1:59:06] why did you come here
[1:59:09] did you come for the games

[1:59:26] ought to come seeking the baptism my

[1:59:29] if we're gonna push our some p our young
[1:59:31] people somewhere to find a find a mate

[1:59:36] what you come here for
[1:59:39] you can have all that
[1:59:41] and i'm for it
[1:59:43] but what'd you really come here for
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:48] this mother decided that enough was
[1:59:50] enough
[1:59:53] i've waded through the waters long
[1:59:55] enough
[1:59:58] i've held on to this long enough
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:02] you're tired of holding on ain't you
[2:00:05] why don't you let it come to life one
[2:00:07] time
[2:00:09] once you let it come to life
[2:00:11] you felt him cooing to you all day long
[2:00:15] once you let it come to life
[2:00:20] brother brother jack moore why don't you
[2:00:22] go down and pray for her
[2:00:24] she don't know she don't know me
[2:00:27] but faith
[2:00:28] calls to profit
[2:00:35] faith
[2:00:37] it's faith that walked you in this
[2:00:38] building this more
[2:00:40] it's faith that brought you here
[2:00:42] it's faith that caused you to come to
[2:00:44] this moment it's faith that's built this
[2:00:46] atmosphere it's faith
[2:00:48] and this is the time to release your
[2:00:50] faith
[2:00:53] brother graham said i took that baby in
