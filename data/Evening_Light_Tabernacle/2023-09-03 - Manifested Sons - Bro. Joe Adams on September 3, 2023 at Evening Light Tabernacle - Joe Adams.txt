Believer today Lord you see the attack of the enemy Lord cancer on the loose Lord sickness is on the loose but oh God when we see the enemy coming in like a flood you said you'd raise a standard Lord this word is a standard and we're your people father we believe this word and we're thankful for the message you've given us in this hour Lord we just invite you this morning you would come and be the voice you would come and be the preacher God anoint the lips to speak only the things of life but not only the lips oh God but may your known our ears to hear what this Spirit would have to be said we love you now father we commit this service to your care in Jesus name if you have your Bibles this morning amen well let's have church I don't know if that scared you but it scared me my mama's if I was not nervous enough so we just want to greet you this morning you know uh many months ago I knew I was going to be taking this Labor Day service and the Lord put this thought on my heart many months ago and I've been studying on it and this today is actually the wrapping up of all the services that I did on the word we bring forth and I want to speak to you this morning on manifested Sons and I believe that's what God's whole intention was even in the back part of his mind before there was ever an earth there was ever a molecule ever expressed God had you and I in his thoughts and he was looking for this day that there would be a time that he would have sons and daughters of God that would manifest his very same spirit and I believe we're living in that day today and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Romans 8 and verse 12 and as you're turning there just want to say God bless you brother Adam sister Bethany it's good to have you with us this morning welcome home Adam you always have a place here at evening light Tabernacle you and your family we we certainly miss you but we know you're blessing where you are and we wouldn't try to steal the blessing from the little church there but we're just glad that they could share you this weekend with us and we trust that something to be said that will bless you and your family today and and for each of us that are here we look here and we find in Romans 8 the Bible says therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received a spirit of adoption notice we're not have received we've not received a spirit of bondage or or slavery to fear anymore but we've received the spirit of adoption and that word adoption there is the placing of sons notice where about we cry Abba Father and here in verse 16 and the spirit which is the holy spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ it's so be that you suffer with him that you may also that you may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US verse 19. and this is what we're drawing our context this morning for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God God bless you you can have your seats this morning and I like brother brother Mike we just want to say appreciate each and every one of you being here I know that there's meetings going on around the United States today some there in Dallas with brother Danny and brother Ron so I appreciate each of you that are here this morning I know we're a little bit smaller group than normal but I believe that we're not necessarily worried about the size of the congregation it's the quality and I believe you're a quality people who love this word and love the message so if you'll just get behind the message this morning I promise you I'll only preach what the Lord lays on my heart so we look here in verse 17 the Bible says if children how many of us are children now we're offspring of God as children then heirs and Heirs of God and join air so notice we're just as Eternal as God is we're joint heirs with him we're just as mortal as God is Immortal we get to enter into his joy we get to sit down with him in his throne we get to partake of him and his glory we get to uh inherit all things that he and Harris notice he shares his kingdom with us so we're joint heirs with him everything that he has done he has done it with the mindset that he's going to share his kingdom with his church with his bride and you are that bride you are that church and we find here but here's where I want to focus on this morning is Romans 8 19 for the earnest expectation that phrase Earnest expectation it signifies the lifting up of the head and the stretching of the body how many turkey hunters do we have in here this morning come on somebody I'm the only one okay well we got one or two in the turkey hunting let me just say this is what happens when you start going you get out there early in the morning it's about that before Daybreak and you just sit there and you're listening and all of a sudden you may do a hoot owl call and you're expecting you start listening you start stretching that ears like that extra six inches is going to help you hear any better but you're stretching it out trying to hear the call of that gobbler back on the other end and this is what we're saying here is that that the earnest expectation reaching out listening with a Earnest desire the creature waves for the revealing or the manifestation of sons now this Earnest expectation is a very great earnestness of desire and expectation of a Hemet longing after notice all of creation has waited for this moment and now here the earnestness is waiting it's all come down through seven Church ages now it's come down to the final Church age the final voices sounded out and there's a people in the land who's under an Earnest expectation with their ears outstretched to hear what the spirit of God is saying to this age notice their Earnest expectation here of the creature waited for the manifestation notice the manifestation of that word means the appearance or the revealing of the sons of God no longer are we going to kick the can down the road and wait for Sons to come notice we're living in the moment we're living in the day we're living in a time where there will be sons of God that will be manifested they will declare to this generation that we are the sons of God how do you know because the very same Spirit the very same life the very same power the very same anointing will begin to flow out through them and they are an under an Earnest expectation to reveal to this generation that we are sons of God that we are the manifestation of all the prophecies we are the Fulfillment we are the culmination it's come down to this moment brother sister and no longer is God waiting for you to come you are here oh my God I told myself I got to just slow down and calm down this morning notice the creature he says is watching as with an outstretched head waiting for the future unveiling now this is Paul Paul is speaking this in Romans and he was speaking about what they were going to be doing they were waiting through seven Church ages for the revealing we're in the end we are in the revealing of the sons of God the manifestation we're not looking for another messenger we're not looking for another age we're not looking for sons of God to be manifested we are the sons of God that are being manifested Romans 8 in verse 21 it says because notice now because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into a glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole everything all types of creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also we which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the change or the Redemption of our bodies so all of creation is waiting all of creation is groaning all of creation is waiting for man to get back in a perfect condition so we understand that in the beginning God created man in his own likeness in his own image and God took that perfect creation and he placed him in a perfect garden there was no sin there was no thunderstorms there was no heat waves it wasn't 105 degrees it didn't get below zero it was a it was a perfect condition and brother Brown would tell us in the fellowship through reconciliation of the blood he said in the beginning when God made man in his own image he put him in the garden of him he had a perfect Fellowship in the late of the afternoon the evening time when the Twilights was falling I could see great Jehovah come across the top of the palm trees and the Roaring of the Thunder when Adam and Eve gathered out there in the great open air Cathedral and they worshiped God and have fellowship and they talked with him The Lion and the Tigers all coming up around in Perfect Harmony notice this Eden notice this condition notice wouldn't that be a wonderful place to live a biting place where there's no sickness come on somebody no sorrow no way of ever being upset everything's in Perfect Harmony God in harmony with this creature and the creature in harmony with this maker he said what a perfect time a complete Fellowship that's the way God intended see man in the beginning when he was made he God made him God made him a God he was absolutely a God for he was in the image of God being a Son of God and then he was an heir of all that God is and man was given a domain domain was the earth he says you have power over the fish you have power over the fowls of the air over everything he could speak and everything obeyed him because why he was a God he said he wasn't Universal God but he was a God now and he had rulership in Dominion he was a king or a king ruler and that was man but we find When sin first came in the Garden of Eden man was in a perfect State until he fell and then he marred his Perfection he marred his inheritance with God his Fellowship was cut away from God and he goes brother Brown says in the fellowship with God he says now I can see little Eve with her those beautiful eyes now after sin had set HIM Tears filled them they run down her cheek I can see Adam with those strong eyes as he looked across Eden the soft winds blowing where he had to make Beast obey him in the winds and the ways to obey him everything else had to obey him he had full rulership over the Earth but he realized that he had lost his fellowship with God and the tears to show him that now he was mortal tripped off his face and they run down over his bosom and they dripped into the into Eve's head noticed man was in a perfect condition creation was in a perfect condition botany life Beast life everything was in a perfect condition until sin fell until sin came more the program and from this time botany life has been waiting for the manifestation of sons Beast life animal life has been waiting for the manifestation of souls until sons of God will get back to a perfect Eternal condition to where there's no death there's no sorrow there's no pain nothing but Perfection and all of creation has been groaning has been lamenting groaning waiting for the moment waiting through seven Church ages that they would finally come a people that would finally come one that they will be what the manifestation of all that's been declared that God will send forth the bride they will take God at his word and they will become the very word made flesh and all of creation has been waiting look church when you look outside and you see the trees bending over because of the heat they're waiting on you to get back in position when you look at the grass out there that's dying because of the heat they're waiting on you to get in position oh everything is waiting on this bride to give it her Godly position so that she can manifest himself through you in this hour everything's waiting everything has been waiting on us notice and I believe there's a place in the Bible that those on the other side are waiting that they without us can't be made perfect we are the finishing of the work come on somebody we are quit kicking the can down the road Quinn looking at your mistakes quit looking at your family and start looking to what the word I am the finished product I'm everything that God declared that I was going to be I may not be in full manifestation yet but I believe the word the word's already been spoke over me and I'm going to manifest everything that he says I'm going to manifest I'm going to say Amen to the word I'm going to believe the word I may not understand it I may not be able to figure it all out but that's not what God is asking us to do he's asking you to believe because every bit everybody all the creation is waiting for this moment for this people that come to their Revelation that I am a son of God oh I say glory to God this morning what a people we should be everything is hinging on you this morning not to put any pressure on you but you got a job to do you got to fulfill the scripture mama that's me have you ever looked in the mirror and you thought man I wish I could be a little bit thinner I wish I could have a few less wrinkles I wish I could have a little bit more hair oh but one day we're gonna look at that mirror and it's all going to come back the wrinkles are going to vanish oh you're gonna be in a perfect body come on somebody my your hair is going to be the right color you're going to have good Vision again you have good hearing again you can look at and say mama that's me and God's gonna say yes that's you I've been longer for this moment I've been waiting for this hour to Sons and Daughters of God they step out of the time element and they step into eternity into a glorified body oh well body a miraculous body oh that's what he's been longing for the manifestation of the sons of God God is Safeway no longer father we're here we're here to Manifest this word we're here to declare we're not a denomination but we are Sons and Daughters of God the Amplified Bible would tell us in Romans 8 19 it says for even the whole creation all nature waits expectantly in Longs earnestly for God's son Sons to be made known they wait for the revealing and the disclosing of their sonship the scriptures 2009 interpretation that's a that's a translation just says for the intense longing of the creation eerily Waits for the revealing of the sons of Elohim anxiously looking with outstretched heads looking oh my God Obama says now all the creation is groaning everything is growing look at the trees how they struggle look at the flowers how they struggle for life just for the frost to tear them down look at the trees how they struggle to hold their branches out to sing glories unto God everything all nature all animal all birds hey flies from the enemy quickly and gets away everything groaning and we ourselves said Paul we've grown too with them for we are waiting for the Redemption of our bodies see everything is waiting on the sons of God to get back in the right position see man is God's highest form of creation and when God created man he created him in his image and God had an intention in the beginning to have a family but we find the fall came in marred the plan of God or so the devil thought that it did but God knew that he had attributes that laid on the inside of him to be a Healer so he had to have man to come into a fallen state so he can heal the body and he had all these different attributes and ever since the fall the all the creation has been waiting to get back into an Eden experience come on Church botany life is waiting on the manifestation of sons animal life is waiting on a manifestation of sons and it bodily life and animal life were waiting for the manifestation of something then what about Sons then what about us this morning what about us who are created in the image of God shouldn't we be under an Earnest expectation shouldn't we be coming to every Service as if this may be the service that I catch the Revelation and maybe not only for me but for my child maybe for that Wayward loved one maybe this is the service where I quit worrying about it I don't have no more fear anymore I'm resting in the Eternal plan of God that they are sons of God they are Daughters of God and they may go a long time before they ever recognize that they are a son but the word's already been spoken over them and they're going to come back oh that seat may be empty this morning but it ain't gonna always be empty because why because we got a promise prodigals will come home I say Oh Glory to God this morning that's our word that's our promise don't you let go of that don't you let the devil take that promise from you this morning we got a word and we're going to manifest that word notice there's an Earnest expectation in the heart of every believer this morning for the manifestation to reveal that I am a son of God I am I'm a son to go back to where the sons of God back in speaking terms with the father oh my think about that back till we step out of these old dying decaying bodies on mortality and we step into an immortal body well I feel like brother Jewel Forney won't it be a time man I looked at my hands and my hands look new I looked at my feet and my feet did too won't it be a tie oh won't it be a glorious oh this is what we've been longing for sure I don't know about you but ever since I became a Christian I've been longer for that day I heard about a Rapture but every day that we've surpassed or we go through is one day closer until we meet that body change how won't it be a time would it be a time when we step out of these decaying bodies and we step into a glorified body no more pain no more sickness no more disappointments no more just struggles oh won't it be a time Church manifesting sons of God oh my God Paul will tell us all the creation all the creation is waiting groaning under an expectancy to see the Divine end the divinely appointed end see the scriptures have been pointing to this day all the scriptures have been pointing to your arrival well we thought maybe 40 years ago or 50 years ago that that was it no God still had seeds planted and those seeds had to come up and manifest him because you see back in when brother Branham preached the message when he came and he was the Forerunner and he and he spoke those words those seeds a lot of it fell on dry ground or it fell in the ground waiting for your arrival waiting for the moment that there will be Sons and Daughters of God they will catch that word and that word would catch their spirit and that Spirit would change their lives and they will be an end time people with an end time word for an end time prophecy and they will be the Fulfillment of everything that I'd ever spoken it went over a lot of people's heads in the 50s and 60s but it didn't go over our head no why because you are seeds you can be reborn not because the sea came as a product of God but we understand or we understand that it's the seed that comes predestinated from God and because you are seeds you can't be reborn again and receive this message but we find all the creation is groaning and waiting with an expectancy for that divinely appointed in Jeremiah 29 and verse 11. we're very familiar with this he says this is Jeremiah speaking but he's speaking under the anointing of the spirit and he says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end see this word expected here is a thing that God has long notice God has longed to give you an unexpected end God has been waiting on that day that he would have a bride God has been waiting on that day that when he would come that he would find faith that he would find the people that would believe his word notice not a nation that's going to come to a Devastation or come to an end but he's going to bring him a future and a hope and this word in here is a reward so God has been longing for the day that he was going to bring his people to their reward oh my church we're here come on let your face know you're here let your neighbor know you're here we're here we have arrived now I know I shared this to your life but I'm going to share it again because it fits perfectly where I'm at today but at our youth camp brother Donnie was in the back and he began to prophesy and he interpreted and his prophecy to the brothers he says I have waited for this time for so long to show my Majesty see God knew the expected end and here he comes through a man of this hour one that was going to be a manifested Son of God and he would bring him up into a Heavenly place that he would catch the inspiration from God and he said I've been waiting for so long to show you my Majesty to show you my sovereign power my authority to show you the Splendor of my quality and my character and he would tell him to preach the gospel notice we're in charge to preach the gospel to manifest the word of God not with just teaching of it through Theology and through psychology but make the word do what it says it will do that's the expectation of Sons of daughters of God and he says I will be with you my sons be not afraid of the Devils go back and be charged in the spirit this is the time you have been longing for notice God's been waiting for this time from the very thought that he had of you in the beginning when he spoke those thoughts God knew there was going to be seven Church ages God knew there was going to be a people in the final age and when you came under the anointing of the spirit and that see gene on the inside of you came to life now you've been longing for that same Revelation that I am the Fulfillment of all the prophecies I am the Fulfillment of all the scriptures we are here Church we've been waiting for it he's been waiting for it I said the wait is over we are the manifestation of the sons of God we are the ones that God has prophesied about we are the ones that are no longer coming we are here and we're ready to take a body change think about the world that we live in what if it went another 5 10 15 20 years think of where we would be as a society the world continues to deteriorate continues a downward spiral into depravity and God has longed for the day to bring his people to a reward an expected end see God has desired plans for those that trust him it's not an expectation of Destruction it's not an end to where we cease to exist but it's a future it's a hope notice it's a promise of a new body a body like his own glorious body a promise of eternal life never to grow old and that's where the old people say shout amen come on I know you got it in you never to grow old never to mention the word cancer ever again never a down moment of discouragement never a time without peace and joy oh won't that be a time oh this is not Pie in the Sky I've seen Castles in the Air this is reality this is where we are headed Church we're on the cusp of a body change we're on the cusp why because we even now in these sinful conditions not that we're simple but our bodies have not yet been born again our bodies have not yet received their adoption but our souls have received the adoption and the prophet of God said we got the earnest oh church we got the earnest what is that declare but we got in part we're going to come into the Fulfillment of a can total body change where we fully manifest Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah y'all excuse my joy this morning I've been waiting months to preach this to you oh hallelujah it's unexpected here it's a desireity and it's in God's plan it's in God's his desires his purpose was to have a bride and the bride is here his purpose was to have a church without spot let me tell you she's not spotted up and she's not wrinkled up in the bed of some denomination but she's a perfect Church she's a perfect body oh she's in love with the perfect Savior and a perfect God it's time that when the sons of God begin to manifest his majesty to manifest our own ideas and our own thoughts for to manifest him to manifest his word we're living in the day where there'll be fully adopted Sons to be fully adopted though you got the Holy Ghost you're not fully adopted well there's coming a day Church where we'll be fully adopted oh my travel like a thought Hallelujah come on somebody won't that be nice may run out of gas on the way to church you have a bad day but there'll be a time you ain't got to worry about gas we're going to travel like a thought man I tell you I'm looking forward to that day Romans 8 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God brother Brown would take Romans 8 19 and he will preach the adoption series from it notice the seventh angel the seventh messenger will take one scripture and he'd begin to preach the adoption series the adoption series is the placing of the sons in their position notice there's been denominational ages there's been the Dark Age there's been this and there's been the Reformation age but all that did not Place Sons and Daughters of God in their position but God knew in the end time he was going to send that final voice and he was going to be the mouthpiece to this age and what was he going to do he was going to take all the loose sins from all the previous ages and he was going to tie those loose ends up and he was going to come with one great message and it was a message to the church that you had you wasn't always this you wasn't ever a pig but you always was a sheep and because you always was you always will be you always was my son but now Hallelujah I'm gonna place you as a Son of God I'm going to put my stamp of approval and I'm going to give you the Holy Ghost and you're going to be sealed in until the day of your Redemption noticed now this is not merely Romans 8 19 is not a future events where we get our glorified bodies though part of that may be but this is the placing of sons in their position of power and authority now the power and authority over the enemy now it's time where this Fallen Humanity this is a time where Fallen Humanity has been so filled with the Holy Ghost where once sin nature controlled you now you control sin nature when Once those thoughts controlled you and dictated how you did now you control those thoughts now where you had those complexes and those mind battles and all these generational curses that would come down and influence your decisions now through the power of the Holy Ghost as manifested Sons now you influenced that decision you pull down the strongholds you pull down and you bring in and you bring everything subject to the word of God I am a son and because I am a son I'm going to reject this thought I'm going to reject this lie I'm going to reject this feeling I'm going to reject this complex well because I am a Son of God and I got the earnest I got the down payment oh my adoption number two he says we're now coming to this great hidden Mystery that's been hid since the foundation of the world and now being revealed in the last days to the sons of God you believe that to be true that the sons of God are manifested do you believe that to be true that's not just a question on tape do you believe that to be true that the sons of God are to be manifested see now the whole of creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God but he says now Paul is going first or going to first place to church exactly where it belongs see now it's in the promised land that don't mean that you're immune from sickness doesn't mean that you're immune from troubles but it does spell this he says now let this sink deep it says that it's yours just to rise and take it so saying even though you had the Holy Ghost it doesn't mean that you're immune from sickness or you're immune from failures you're immune from disappointments but he says let this sing deep it means that it is yours you don't have to stay in that sinful condition or that that complex condition or or whatever it is you're gonna rise and take the promise take the word apply the token to your experience apply the token to your home apply the token to your marriage and believe that what God said you can have it he says you give me a church tonight A group of people perfectly perfectly in the promise of God with the holy ghost walking in the spirit he goes I'll challenge any disease or any Affliction or anything there is oh my come on Church notice with the Holy Ghost or you got the Holy Ghost how many you got the Holy Ghost this morning then we can challenge any sickness we can challenge any any Affliction we can challenge anything that there is and not only challenge it but know that we're going to come out on the other side more than Abel more than conquered I ask you this morning is anything too hard for our God if he could take a 90 year old woman and he could turn it back to a young woman that she desires of a king what can he do for us manifested Sons and Daughters of God filled with the Holy Ghost got his life on the inside I said I'll watch out Satan we're coming for you we're coming to take back all that belongs to us he says when we walk in Christ we have spiritual blessings outside of Christ we have Sensations I don't want Sensations so I like to jump I get emotional well because I know there's something on the inside I heard our prayer Our pastoral last life I don't know if any of you watched the service but I watched it last night he says you know you take this Outlet over here that Outlet's got power in it you don't see that power and you don't really feel that power you can plug something in it and it Powers it up he said but if you ever stick your finger in that outlet you will get emotional what is it because you were recognize that the power from the socket come inside of you and let me tell you you can't help but to respond you can't help but to act out you can't help but to get emotional why because that thing has got a hold of you it'll shake you it'll make you scream it'll make you shout one and that's the same thing I'm talking about this morning when you get the Holy Ghost gets a hold of it it'll make you shout it'll make you do it'll make you scream why it's got a hold of me oh talking about it's made of fasting sonship it's like you know who you are it's got a hold of me brother Joe Don't Let It Go [Applause] notice an Earnest expectation the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation what is the manifestation making known the whole world the muhammadans Over Yonder they're looking for it all around everywhere they're looking for where is this people everybody's wondering they're looking they're looking well look no longer we're here everybody's looking he says what's everything waiting on the whole creation is waiting for for the manifestation of sons of God it's waiting for the church to become into its position oh my come on young people it's time to get in position come on Mom and Dad it's time to get in position it's time for you followers to be leaders in your home it's time that you quit kicking the can down the road and letting the wife have the responsibility of being the head it's time to you get in your position why is this time for us to get in or for not us for you to get in your position it's time for the sons of God to get into the position that they've been called to not out of position everything is waiting on us everything is waiting on us let me tell you if the Muhammad is waiting on me I'm getting in position oh no to this waiting for the church to become in his position who are the sons of God when Adam where was his domain it was the earth he had domain over the Earth is that right he wasn't Lily Elohim then he was Jehovah see that is I am God I've made some lesson ones under me I've given them dominion and in their domain the Dominion under them is the earth man had dominion over the Earth and all the creation is waiting for the sons of God to be manifested otherwise they're waiting for the sons of God to have dominion once again to take your position in rulership over the Earth how about let's start with this Earth how about let's bring this Earth under subjection to the word of God bring this Earth show that I am a son by bringing this Earth under control not just with mouth oh well I'll go to brother Tim's church or I believe God sent a prophet and yet this Earth doesn't line up with this message I'm talking about this Earth this mess is all lining up together said Clarity yes I am a son and daughter of God because my life lines up with it and not only my life lines up with the word but his spirit is Flowing out of my life and it's manifesting itself declaring that yes I am in fact a son and daughter of God is that okay this morning notice God is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself God is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this and say there's my spirit flowing freely and we got churches today they want to throw off on our church and they want to criticize because we are free because we invite him to have rulership and Dominion to flow freely and I'm not going to get into that this morning but notice he says he wants to be in a place where his Spirit can move freely he says how do you judge him by the way that he stays with the word write with the word that shows that you know all men is by the way that he stays with word if they speak not according to the word then there's no life in them says the Bible lead them away he says now tell me my brother tell me my sister when will was there a time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now adoption series four part four when were there ever a time in history that that manifest the time to deliver all nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before all the Old Testament on down there there couldn't have been a manifestation it had to wait till this time see now all things have been brought coming shaping up to this headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it would join him in the church together their Ministry in the ministry of Christ will be so close together because why because they are manifesting him for he opened blinded eyes they opened blinded eyes for he healed the lame they healed the lane where he raised it in they raised it he's talking about raising it yeah out of your dead dark denominational views you have come to life you don't think Jesus got excited about his word and that's where we get excited they showed through David's life when David saw the Ark of the Covenant coming home he didn't just sit there and look at it like a wart on a pickle I'll puckered up as we spoke about the other night no David was excited the word is coming back to his rightful position and I'm telling you Sons and Daughters of God the word has returned and we are the people now that we welcome the return of the word that should do something for us I'm not telling you to jump up and down and bubble the head but I'm telling you it should excite you something should excite you because why the same Ministry of Christ and he said David is a man after my own heart so God saw him David if he could have responded God would have jumped he would have shout why because the word was coming back to a people the place the people in their Homeland and I'm telling you we are here there's a people in the land today that's been positionally placed back in the homeland of the word of God no more denominational views no more man-made ideas no more traits being handed down and traditions being had now we are back home church we are the people of the open book we are the people of the promised land we are the people that are manifesting sonship the time is now we're not waiting on it I'm not looking for another special meeting to come so I can get in my sonship so I can get in my position no the time is now now all things have been brought coming shaping up to the headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ notice so close like Christ that it'll join them together join him in the church together see all the creation has been waiting for the seventh angel they've been waiting on him to come and take the Loose Ends and tie it all together because it's been prophesied in the days of The Voice oh that's not tomorrow that's not next year that's not another messenger coming it's our day that voice had already spoke now we are the Fulfillment John take the book John eat the book John digest the book John and prophesy again John John the type of the Bride who is now coming to position see the book's not going to stay in his hands for there's going to be a people that's going to be a match piece so what was in that book is now in them and what was on his lips is now on theirs notice now all the creation been waiting until man will start displaying the attributes that God placed there before the foundation of the world some of you will cry some of you will shout some of you will scream some of you will dance some of you won't do nothing but God still placed attributes of himself on the inside and whatever those attributes are they're going to manifest now I got a son over here tall well I'll say taller not a really a tall family are we stand up Joseph he's about five foot nine okay five foot eight there you go I went to the doctor the other day I've been swearing I've been five foot six and a half for 20 plus years or actually long run out of 48 so probably about 30 years I've been five foot six and a half I got my bubble deflate this little nurse come over there and she said get on the scale I'm like you're really gonna weigh me she said I got to that wasn't so bad brother Mike I'm not that bad but when I she measured my height five foot five and a half I'm like no that ain't right she said look it's right but I'm gonna put you down for five six I said you got it said you made my day I said I've been going all this time through my life thinking I was five foot six and a half you cheated me by a whole winch well at least she gave me a half an inch back but this is my son we don't look alike he's good looking got beautiful blonde hair I got none he's got big muscles modern failing me and you look at us and you may not you can sit down you may not see the attributes of the father inside the sun because maybe we don't look exactly alike but if you get close enough to us and you're around us you'll see some of the same attributes that I possess begin to flow out through his life now y'all know my daughter Rebecca everybody knows Rebecca she's a little Joe Adams right because the very same nature the very same Spirit almost inside of me is inside of her and she's a little fiery thing I mean she gives everything she got why because it's not about impersonation it's about something on the inside now manifesting what's always been there and it's pointing back that's Joe's son that's Joe's daughter and what does the father saying when you begin to manifest those attributes you're not some Son of some denomination but no that's my son that's my attribute that's my daughter because the very attributes on the inside begin the flow out they take the word they hang on to the word they say Amen to the word that's not about the truth what are they doing they're reflecting the attributes of the father see there's people today they can impersonate we know Andrew Glover if you ever been around Andrew he's very good him impersonation Andrew's good some people have it I don't have it my son's pretty good at it but he can impersonate voices but you take people they can learn how somebody articulates a word or how they drag out a word or maybe they they learn how to do the hand motions and how they jump you know had to be anointed to do that more I said watch it don't do all that dancing on that platform but you find they can just impersonate because they study the life they study how they they articulate and how they move and how their mannerisms but I'm not talking about impersonation because see that impersonation is only a fake replica replication of that person but you take somebody that's born again who's born of The Same Spirit it ain't something that's got to be trained it ain't something got to be studied it ain't something that's got to be taught no it come down freely because it's always what's in there it always was it always will be and let me tell you on the right atmosphere under the right anointing it begins to show itself and you can declare there's a manifested son there's a Manifesto daughter what is it it's about manifesting sonship how can we take a young Mariah Pruitt who lost all our hair without alopecia and she'd come in a prayer line and she brought some bobby pins and said when I come through the other side I'm gonna put these back in my hair what was that she was manifesting something that was already there it was a promise of restoration and God restored her glory what am I telling he wouldn't sit and train it she didn't put a wig on and make it up no God began to restore and what am I telling you the same attribution the father is in you this morning that's you ain't gotta work it up it's going to work itself out it's going to come out freely what's in you will come out of you if all you could think about is the world the things of the world and pornography and bitterness and hatefulness and grudges that's just going to flow out oh but if you ever become a manifested son there'll be peace in the valley there'll be joy unspeakable and full of Glory every healing they'll be Deliverance they'll be the manifestations of the word of God you won't put it back but someday gone by no he said you can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you can cast out Devils you can speak with new tongues we can have the manifestation of the nine gifts of God in the church and he said they should be in operation in every local assembly but people today want to put them back we don't need that anymore we got the revealed word it must not be too revealed if you can't even keep the Simplicity of it let me move on notice manifest of sons manifesting the attributes of the father his life his word his attributes his glory his person The Works that he did we do well you're just trying to be brother no I'm just trying to be God that's what I'm called to be to manifest him and what he did I can do it's a supernatural that he displays you can display he healed the sick we can heal the sick he casts out Devils we can cast out devils see we're waiting waiting for the time that Fallen man filled with the spirit of God will again we'll begin to manifest the authority over the enemy that's what he's been waiting on and when he gets that bride ready and she's completely in one mind as brother Aaron taught one Accord one purpose One Vision singleness of heart God's gonna come he's going to change that body and it ain't gonna be one by one it's going to be Collective we're all going to change at the same time I say oh get ready Church man Jerry show is going to come walking through the door Karen Pruitt's gonna come walking through the door Jerome bus going to come walking through the door that's going to be a many of them come walk it may be this Sunday morning for service is over we got a promise we got something to look to what is it the word being restored we know what to look forward to in the moment in the twinkling of an eye oh we're gonna be changed oh let me tell you see it's got to take his hole it can't hold you any longer all the depression and all the anxiety and all the frustrations of the world they can't hold you any longer while we're Sons and Daughters of God manifesting his word notice we're not to manifest our own ideas but we're to manifest his word his attributes his purpose his plan that's what we're an attribute notice in Mark 16 and verse 17. the Bible says in these signs shall follow them that believe now brother Brown didn't say that but Jesus did so Jesus is telling us giving us something to look forward to this is how you will know that they're believers notice these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they should speak with new tongues on and on and on and the word signs here is Miracles and Wonders by which God authenticates the men sent by him and also it's it's by which men proved that the cause that they are pleading is God see it's going both ways signs follow Miracles and wonders follow them it declares that hey this man is sent by God but is also declaring that that man is declaring that God's word is truth and this is what happens when you believe and program says this in the message the unchangeable word of God how many believe that his word is unchangeable the Bible says these signs these signs shall follow them that believe God makes a distinction he gives a mark on the people if he believe notice now if he believes then these signs shall follow them that believe that's right the believer not they that they say they believe or not those that suppose that they believe but the real believer and he says I want to belong to a church that's got them signs and wonders following it oh that takes all the skepticism out of those that don't want the signs and wonders they don't want the supernatural in their men but your Prophet did I want to belong to a church that's got them signs and wonders following that's where I want to have my fellowship right under the blood of Jesus Where Angels and powers and the Holy Ghost and God works back and forth through his church through his people showing signs and wonders he goes I think for me this is another message it wasn't so from the beginning I think that for me I want to worship and to worship with a church who believes the Full Gospel and preaches every word of it and practices every word of it go back to the Full Gospel back to the power of God back to the Holy Ghost back to the beginning and receive it like they did at the beginning and he says now and it will bring forth the same results that it did in the beginning because he's not he's unchangeable so the way they acted in The Upper Room not Azusa we're going to be on Azusa for how they acted in the upper room is how we're to act Mary was up there the mother of Jesus she had to come out drunk on the spirit well that ain't my nature well it may not be your nature but you get drunk one time your nature may change it may be altered because you come under the influence of something greater than you in your own mind notice what he says today it reminds me many get upset by trying to find great big places and beautiful pipe organs those things are all right but if a church has got a million dollar gold cross on the top of it it's got a million dollar gold organ and in that church the Holy Spirit has to ride away praise God he goes I like to belong to a church like that he goes but I don't care what it's got if the Holy Ghost isn't there it's no place for me see I want to be where they preach it like it fell at the beginning oh my God I want to be there like that brother Robin you're welcome to even like Tabernacle you're welcome right here this morning because we're preaching what you preach and you preach what Paul preached and you said they can preach it you'll be where they preached it like in the beginning will come we welcome you and even like Tabernacle we welcome you to come and change Hearts we welcome you to change look church we don't have our own messes we are preaching the message of Malachi 4. we are preaching a message of Revelations 10 7 and 8. we are preaching this word and this word is the Vindicated truth notice what he says I don't care what is God if it's got the Holy Ghost if the Holy Ghost is that there it's not a place for me I want to be where they preach it like a fellow at the beginning that's where I know that they got it at the beginning that's the only thing I know about the word goes back to the beginning he says God's infinite he cannot change man changes time changes Kingdom changes worlds changes churches change but Christ Remains the same yesterday today and forever he can never change he's just like that as he was at the beginning and the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost of today Henry says now this is in 1954 he goes and I'll admit it it's been trampled on it's been made fun of it's been misinterpreted misrepresented and everything else like that he goes That's the only the devil counterfeiting but there is a real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that brings the same results that they had at the day of Pentecost brings the same results he said Martin Luther had mechanics and Dynamics John Wesley had them in his day Pentecostal had him with their day but what about our day oh we got the mechanics man we got the word nobody's had the word like we've had the word but there's more to just the word than just the word because the letter killeth but the spirit is what gives life to the word notice what he says and I bring this all through the message so I don't think I'm coming up with my own ideas this morning my brother Tim's idea or some of these men who are who are you know preaching like this but this is what the prophet thought this is what God thought about it and he says now what about our day this is another time the church should be fully grown now ready to meet Christ God has sent back the Holy Spirit which is Jesus Christ which is the same yesterday today and forever then he is still the same messiah in the Life of Christ is in the church vindicating his word that that's how God was in the earth in the form of Jesus being the word to make the word live and the Holy Spirit is today in flesh making the word live in every promise and every Wonder see that great Jehovah God that created all things brought himself down to live in the heart of you and I great Jehovah God stepped out of Glory came down took on the form of sinful flesh paid the price of redemption pay for your inheritance came down so that you can have his spirit so that you can be a manifested son and daughter of God he said the gospel is not all together by the word the word was made manifest that's the gospel the gospel came not in word only but through Power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit go into all the world and demonstrate the power how do you know that that man is sent from God because the word that he's preaching is being Vindicated it's declaring that what he is speaking is the truth because the signs the Miracles the Wonders are following after his ministry it declares whether you're a Believer or not here today because you're believing for the supernatural how does sister Atlanta all of a sudden one day in the back leaning on the Everlasting arm jump up out of the Pew back there and begin to run around and run it showed that she was a believer in the Supernatural ability of God to take cancer from her Satan put a death sentence on her but God took it away and God showed that through a sorry daughter of God he was going to manifest his word that not even cancer would stand before your prayer let me tell you even like Tabernacle we believe the power of God we believe the anointing of the Holy Spirit we have seen witness after witness after witness let me tell you what more does God's got to do to shake us we are the supernatural power of God we are the people that are manifesting this word if other churches don't want to manifest it God give it to us let us be the Fulfillment this morning I'm not here to kick any other Church down but let me tell you I'm not going to look at them and say it ain't for me let me tell you you don't want to believe in it that's fine with you and your congregation but for me and my church for me and my family we're gonna take God in his word we're gonna believe this message we're going to believe for the supernatural we're going to believe for a body tank we're going to believe when we lay hands on the sea that they shall recover we're gonna believe it why because we witness it time and time and time again police ain't hair restored we've seen osworth's story we see cancer leaves we have seen the manifestation of the sons of God those that declare this is who he is we're not waiting on it it's here Philbin says now and the gospel is not all together by the word the word was made manifest is the gospel the gospel come not in the word only but through Power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost go into all the world and demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit to All Nations now instead of that we begin to teach theology we begin to see God doesn't want believers to merely teach theology but those that are to believe or to to believe that the word that has been spoken will be made manifest that we can still have altar calls and young people not just young people but even those that have needs can meet God at the altar and have their needs met it was at an altar when my daughter-in-law when I was preaching a youth service there in in Pony Oklahoma received the baptism of the Holy Ghost what if she was not given that altar what if she wasn't given that opportunity but see there's still men that preach you can have an altar call experience God's still casting this saying for the sheep saying and for the fish saying it for those predestinated ones what about those that come into a prayer line and they know they come through there with some kind of faith that when they get to the other side their promises waiting on them you know brother man preaches a message and he brings up this young boy who had polio and he said you know he they try to get him on the uh to get them to the prayer line and he couldn't get there he could never get it but he said that this young boy finally they put him on the platform and brother Brown had a chance to talk to him and he says brother Brown he says do you got a word for me he says yeah this is this what happened to you he said yeah that's right he said you know you got Paul little said yeah that's right he says what about my healing he says by his stripes you are healed he didn't see a vision of him he didn't declare this he said only what he did he he recited the word by his stripes you are here and that young boy stricken with polio in a wheelchair he went back home and he began to confess by his stripes I am he wasn't manifesting the the preacher's word he wasn't manifest in a prophet's word he was manifesting God's work and a group of preachers came down there and said you're causing over approach he said let me tell you she goes if you were sitting where I'm sitting if you was in the chair that I'm in would you try to rob me of my only hope let me tell you church this is the only hope of the Bride is preaching the power he's preaching a supernatural he's teaching the anointing of the Holy Ghost why do we want to rob it why do we want a stupid from the people you may have an author call experience this morning you may have hands laid upon you and God meet you why would you take that strip it from the people don't Rob the mother only hope he goes bro bam says now and I'm trying to wrap this up but I'm going to keep on preaching because we ain't got for one service a day he goes we have so much of the mechanics and not the Dynamics this is after the opening of the seals so just cool your jets it's all good signs of this time 1963 November 13th now my body is a mechanics but my body will not operate without the Dynamics of the spirit now how many of you ever woke up and you just lethargic sluggish can't hardly move come on come on somebody you old people raise your hand if ain't nobody ever felt lethargic you know when you get older boy this body starts dragging you can't hardly make I tell my wife all week man I'm tired I'm tired she goes man what's wrong with you you got coping I said I don't know but I'm tired what are we fine here see that's just my body that's just the mechanics but there has to be a spirit that will come and anoint the mechanics and raise that body off the bed or raise that body off the couch or raise that body out of the chair and get that body to function the way that that body was supposed to function let me say we've got so much on the mechanics the mechanics the mechanics the word the word the word the word the Brian knows what he wants done with the word yeah she won't he wants the spirit to anoint that word to make that word live that's what the bride knows that's what the bride expects that's what God is doing he's manifesting himself through a bride that knows what he wants done with the word he says now my spirit operates my body brings it into control he goes like an automobile with no gasoline in it man with no fire and power no matter how many how I find the Dynamics or the mechanics is fixed up the cylinders the points the plugs whatever more it's got to have a current you've got to take those together so you got to take the mechanics and you got to take the Dynamics and you got to marry them two together and when you put the two together oh my you give a good crank on it's going to fire up may there be hands being clapped amens being shouted somebody May stand to their feet oh I heard the other day and Wednesday night service poor little sister said oh I wish somebody would have stood up she was I felt like running around what was there was a spark hitting the gasoline that was on the inside something was igniting on me inside let me tell you that's what happens when the spirit comes to the mechanics he said unto the church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him through the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride for he said in John 14 12 he that believeth on me in the works that I do shall he do also see I'll give him charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics that's the world will not be able to withstand that it'll raise him up in the last day see the mechanics without Dynamics is no good and neither is the Dynamics well that's mechanic he said you can scream jump up and down all you want to but if you deny the word it won't do you any good you scream jump shout and all that but you you got all the spark but you ain't got no gasoline he goes it only works as they come together if you just want if you just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come that's fire is made to connect with the octane in the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion well why do you jump I guess I got lit why do you save it I guess there's a spark on the inside some of y'all see me when I fly out of that chair man I'll tell you it's just something I'm thinking man you look stupid but it don't matter it's just flying out why because the spark is hitting the mechanic because the word is there the word is being preached but not only is the word being preached there's a spirit that comes out and anoints the word and I can't stay in my seat I jump up like popcorn like oh hallelujah it's here he's here what the spirit anointing the word and making the word live make it a word say yes that's nothing but the truth and if they could do it for me it can do it for you if it can do it for Hattie right he could do it for you this morning he can do it for your kids he can do for your son he can do it for your daughter he can do it for your loved one he's still the same God and he's still manifesting himself notice now First Corinthians 12 and verse 25. he said there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all members suffer with it if one remember be honored then all members Rejoice with him now you are the body you are the body and the members in particular and God had sent some in the church notice what he placed in the church he plays first apostles secondarily prophets thoroughly teachers Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongue then we find in Ephesians 4 and verse 11 he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers for the perfecting to bring the church to manifestation for the perfecting of the of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body and then the message of this morning church age brother Brown says God never intended a church to be run by man God runs his church he runs it through the gifts of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit is in the church to correct the spirit or to correct the spirit he's got five ministerial offices in the church notice five ministerial offices prophets minister teachers ministers evangelists ministers pastors ministers missionaries ministers all of them are ministerial offices for for the perfecting or the manifestation to bring the church to her perfection see God placed in there so what we need today we need to know any teachers come on church we need anointed teachers that will teach the hidden Mystery truths of this word but what we don't need is for those teachers to incorporate psychology as a replacement to the anointing of the Holy Spirit what we don't need is for teachers to preach at the days of Miracles has passed what we don't need is for preachers or teachers to say that we don't need an altar call experience or we don't need prayer lives anymore because we have the word what we need for teachers to do is teach the fundamental truths of this message and lay the foundation and what we don't need is for evangelist to throw darts at those teachers because why because they're preaching about these things what we need to do is marry the three the other five gifts together because it's for the perfecting of the body look don't get don't disagree with me because because you can't in your ministry bring the power of God down you're not called to do that you're called to teach it you're called the lady the foundation the Evangelist is called this take the mechanic of what you've been teaching and marry it up with the spirit of God and let the spirit of God move in the church and perfect the body of Jesus Christ but we find today we got teachers we got pastors we got preachers and we got advantage and we're all fighting one another and it should never be that way we need both mechanics and we need Dynamics look I tried to teach my goodness y'all see how that works out man I wish I could dig deep and find those mystery truths but it just ain't in me but I'm not complaining I'm not throwing off and saying we don't need teaching we need it the body needs it our young people need the foundation of this message so we need both teaching preaching we need Apostles we need pastors we need teachers we need it all why because he's the same yesterday today and forever He's Able today to deliver like he did yesterday he's able to heal like he did yesterday he's able to save what we don't need is just intellectual talks Phil Raph says now he says now our intellectual talks which is fine but I only will he goes I only wish I could do that but that ain't what counts from the sight of God it's the Holy Spirit God never did ordained such he ordained any commissioned a church to go and preach the gospel and the gospel is not an election the gospel came not in word only but through Power and demonstration manifestations of the Holy Spirit that's what brought the gospel and that's what we need today quit fighting we just need to preach the gospel you ain't got to believe it if you don't want to believe it you can spit the seed out if you want to spit the seed out but we're going to preach the manifestation of the gifts we're going to preach the power of the Holy Ghost we're going to preach the anointing that is to follow the Believers signs and wonders the miraculous the supernatural will follow it's a Vindication it's proof that he's here can I say it like this you are proof that he is here because he is manifesting through your life through your being in your low moments in your dark valleys he's manifesting himself the same that he's still God notice preach the gospel not word only but making the word manifest well if I said someone said not long ago brother Brandon preach the gospel he said I do that doctor he goes not Divine Healing he said preach the word he says well the word is what I preach sir he said brother Brown he said the gospel is the word of God and brother man says I said not all together see the Bible said the gospel come to us not in word only but through Power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost to preach the word that letter killer but the spirit give his life so we want to we want to preach the gospel we want to preach it we want to manifest it we want to declare that it is the same that he is the same we're not we're waiting on somebody else to come we are here it is here so signs follow signs following is the Dynamics of the mechanics it is proof that the word works and brother bam says this he says now our ministry has changed it over they want to say that there's real believer I tell you he loves the Lord he goes to a church every Sunday he draws or he pays his dues in the church and he treats his neighbor right he goes That's Just moral acts the holy spirit in the man demonstrates the power of the supernatural that's what makes him a Believer it's God vindicating that he is a believer and brother Branham was contending for the faith that was once delivered you see he fought against the Same Spirit In which we're fighting against today Church of Christ spirit says the days of Miracles has passed we don't need that anymore now we have the word he defended and defended and defended his stance on Divine Healing on laying on the hands on witnessing you know all these things brother random defended it until his last day his last breath until 1965. he continued to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints so notice here we're waiting for the fullness of adoption for the fullness of the manifestation that's when our bodies will be changed from these vowel creatures that we are and we'll have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him like he is we shall be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like his a glorious body all the trials and struggles of life will fade off in the in the least Miss in the blow away to to be no more he goes Earthly Tabernacles were are now groaning waiting for the earnest the earnest for the Salvation fooling for the fullness to come he says what is the earnest it's a little down payment that holds it and we have the earnest the holy spirit is declaring that there's more to come is to claim that now that you have authority over sinful Humanity but one day you're going to have complete dominion over this body because this body will be redeemed and no longer in a sinful condition notice he says I don't condemn good looks I don't condemn their hospitals good things they do I think that that's wonderful God's blessing to the poor suffering Humanity I don't condemn all these other things they're doing fine that's just right they're just great organizations and millions and millions of dollars he goes I sure had that rather than them bootleg joints in the corner anytime I certainly honor them as Minister standing in the Pulpit but when it comes to gathering together at the end of the dispensation it'll be waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God in that dispensation so we have attained an inheritance Church what is the inheritance he believes says what is an inheritance he says somebody has to leave you something so we have obtained an inheritance and how do we get it by predestination what is the inheritance it's a new body it's a new body suffering Humanity will suffer no more decay in humanity will Decay no more a new body the body by which God intended you to come with in the beginning we're going back to that body back to the manifestation of the sons of God he says inheritance by predestination I inherited something what is inheritance there had to be somebody to leave me an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance I beg your pardon Jesus never left me and inherited Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to brought you to your inheritance he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and give you your inheritance see God chose us he goes That's our inheritance God chose us that makes the ugly day look much better I got an inheritance you may have looked in the mirror this morning all disappointed but man when you realize God chose me that's my inheritance that means I'm not going to a devil's hell I'm not going to a sinner's grave I got a promise that I'm going to step over a body I'm gonna step into a new body oh Church no matter how bad it gets how about how low we get we got a promise that there's a new day coming why because we're here to manifest Sons and Daughters of God and he says I am the vine and you are the branches I'm Divine and you are the branch he that abideth and me and I and him the same bringeth much more or bringeth forth much fruitful without me you can do nothing and the message blind bought a mess he said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's got to be the same in principle the same in power the same in every way only in the Corporal body and he's using us oh he's the same in every detail brother Derek every detail except the Corporal body and he's using us wipe the frown off your faith us God is using you the same as he used his son Jesus the Same Spirit the same anointing the same power the same Authority everything the same only the body is different and he's using us see Jesus don't have any hands but your hands he don't have any mouths but your mouth so be careful what you say he don't have any feet but your feet be careful that you leave your feet stuck in one place and don't move when he wants you to move with them see we are the branches he is a vine and as the branch we're not going to manifest the denominational view as a branch we're not going to manifest a man-made idea as a branch we're not going to manifest cold formal powerless religion but as a branch we're going to manifest the power of God we're going to bring forth fruit and that fruit as they're going to declare exactly who you are notice if we start bringing this down see how much time I got I'm over time aren't I can I go just a few more minutes he says there's been churches churches Brides brides churches churches prize prize but there has to come one come on 1965 it's a rising of the sun he go there's got to come one there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it make the church live move in the power of his resurrection can I tell you this morning you are here can I tell you this morning you are the one that's been churches churches bribes but I'm here to declare to you those on the stream and those here this morning you are that one you are the one that has come that is long for to pour out his spirit and to manifest himself oh the wait is over even like we have arrived God is here again and he's here in a multi-member body called the body of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ we're not looking for him to come he is here oh you are that one all the creation has been waiting oh my been waiting on you all this time not for you to get to evening light but to you to get to your position in the body notice he says now I claim that he's the same yesterday today and forever the same principle same power same everything all but the Corporal body which sits at the right hand of God in the Majesty but the holy spirit is here working move and Performing doing just exactly like Jesus did for it's proof of his resurrection so notice this is in 1957 the holy spirit is here working moving performing doing exactly like Jesus did for his proof of his resurrection who's he doing it through the people the body Jesus is not here in 1957 in her Corporal body but you are Sodus he says we're amateur gods in one place notice now the word and nature is grown in crime musicians make your way if you don't come I'll preach till we I mean I'll keep on preaching that brother Tim anointing is all up here this morning I'll tell you no wonder he preaches so good in so long because it's good you make it easy notice he's in the world and nature has grown in crime everything is moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons field sons and their word is back I believe we're not well he goes I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain let it be done oh brother brother my needs so and so my crops are burning up he says I haven't had any rain he says I send you rain in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you if the prophet can do that you can do that it's not haphazard we got a promise you can take the word on your lips and it's just the same as deity speaking he said the word that he left behind on printed Pages the part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life oh I love this place something if you would he is now Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word priest actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went into the conscious of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out diseases and accept the captive free everywhere those early Believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and God confirmed the word with signs following they were healed Devils were cast out they spoke in tongues that was the word in action and he said the word has never fell in the mouth of believing Christians in the last age it's here stronger and greater than it ever before in the true bride of Jesus Christ are you that true Pride this morning then let me tell you the word has never failed in the mouth of True Believers seeing he's not in heaven anymore deities in you this morning the one who fought the Stars the one who spoke things into his sisters that deity today is living in you it's living in Sons and Daughters of God manifesting himself we are not will be we are now sons of God don't put it off to tomorrow don't put it off to the Millennium we don't need to be sons in the middle of them though we will be but we are sons of God today this morning this very minute you may have had a bad week you may have had a bad start to this morning but I'm here to declare it to you you're sons of God your daughter of God you've got a Word of Faith this morning you got a Word of Promise this morning oh Heaven and Earth is behind you this morning and today we are now if we are right now manifested side declaring that he is all Church God is in you to do it to perform what he's always done the same Jesus the Same God that walked the shores of Galilee is walking through the streets of Minden Hussein God is going to the schools same God as coming to Brick Street Coffee same God is coming to even like Tabernacle same God is going to mind the medical center the same God is walking with you you're taking that God places because why you're manifesting sons of God oh there's an age that don't want to believe this they don't want to preach this they don't they want to put it all for a day's gone by but oh he's still present he's still present he's still here see God's life is on display in Satan's Eden Satan created a need to try to keep you here but there's something on the inside of us wanting to get back to that evening get back to that perfection there's something crying out Brother David I gotta get back why because that's that's your real beginning that's your real origin that's how we should have came as Adam no sin no penalty nothing perfect condition although we may be imperfect in this body Church we're going back because we have the earnest the down payment God bless you today
