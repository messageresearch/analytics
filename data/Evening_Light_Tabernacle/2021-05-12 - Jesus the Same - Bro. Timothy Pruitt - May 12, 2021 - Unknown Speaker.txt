father we love you with all of our heart bless this service father bless us with your presence father bless each and every need we ask it in jesus name amen amen let's turn to hebrews 13 and 8. man seems like quite a long time since we stood here amen but we're glad to be here with you tonight amen very very familiar scripture that no doubt we all could recite by heart of this one verse but i want to read all the way down to verse 15. it says jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever be not carried about with divers and strength doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that had been occupied therein we have an altar wherever they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name also in joshua 3 7 and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i will be with thee amen god bless you today and be seated i'd like to speak to you this evening on jesus the same i think it was a very wonderful song to be brought out to or magnify the lord with me amen because he has a name that's worthy to be praised amen if there's any name that's worthy of praise is this name there's any name that's worthy of adoration it's this name you know we live in a world that is shifting and changing so fast that it's almost very different from one day to the next day you know one day you can be at peace and the next day you can be at war and one day things can be going along pretty good the next day it's all falling apart it's simply a fact that we live in an age when everything seems to be changing before our eyes and not not in years and and decades but very m this moments and minutes things are changing in fact you know technology is developing so quickly that if you know if we listed the devices that represent the new technology today tomorrow when you got out of bed that new technology that we listed tonight could very well be outdated and something new took his place by morning because we are living in a very changing time you know not only have we seen technology change quickly but we've seen politics change quickly we've seen political parties change quickly we've seen national and international boundaries change very quickly and currencies change and you know the list goes on and on because we're living in a changing world and in the midst of this climate of sweeping changes the world has been caught up scores of people have been had been swept swept into a a just a global shift in core biblical views and morals and and you know even concerning the most basic of faith you know and things that people have been shifted very quickly and changed very quickly people have abandoned the formal things they held very dear and are grasping newer easier new easier to live supposed truths you know in the midst of this ever-changing world it's good to remember there's one thing that never changes man changes government changes uh the world changes city politics earthly politics changes but there's one thing that never changes and that's jesus christ he he he was in the past exactly who he is in the present amen and precisely who he will be forever amen what uh what a foundation we can stand on today i i'm thankful that my peace is not dependent upon my government or or even my own life and things because all that can be changed very quickly but the peace that i have passes all understanding amen the joy that i have does not come from the world and the things around me but it becomes from an unchanging source and that source does not change depending on what politics says or or what the world says or what the world is dictating jesus christ never changes amen you know as we read here hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever this this word the same emphatically states that jesus christ is unchangeable hallelujah and i'm thankful for that because because if he's unchangeable then his attitude is unchanging his thoughts are unchanging his word is unchanging as i've said before i'm thankful i'm not serving a god who thinks of me one way one day and the next day he thinks of me a different way that'd be a terrible way to live amen but the god that called us is the same god that loves us is the same god that stands with us and he's the same god who will never leave us or forsake us but will be with us through the end of the world that's the promise amen and so you know they say this say this word saying means jesus christ is unchangeable he's the one we can depend upon to be the same regardless of time or regardless of the spirit of the age amen he does not change no matter how dark he gets he does not change no matter how sick how bad the sickness gets he don't change how bad no matter how bad the political system gets he don't change amen god is god and he don't change what he did did before he was the same yesterday today and forevermore i'm glad to serve him because he don't change amen he's the one we can depend upon in our times of crisis because he don't change amen he stays the same he stays there amen upon his word his word don't change it's on shifting it's unchangeable it's unstoppable it remains the same no matter how hard the devil fights against it no matter how hard all hell comes against it it remains the same amen and so we don't need to refigure or redefine who jesus is or what he thinks or what his message is because he is the same hallelujah and everything he represents is the same yesterday today and forever the word yesterday it depicts all time that ever was up to this present moment or in other words it describes all of the past so paul would say he was he's the same today as he was yesterday so if you want to know who god is today go see who he was yesterday because the god that was yesterday is the god today amen that's why we could say that your jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new because we saw him operate and act exactly the same he moved exactly the same he delivered his people he set his people free he healed their sicknesses he touched them all the types in the old testament he came and fulfilled in the new testament the same hallelujah amen the word today means today or at this very moment or this current age it depicts the present the right now amen he is the same and using these words together yesterday today and forever it shows or portrays a continuity amen a continuity of god the words yesterday and today are an expression to show there's continuity amen we find that jesus isn't one way in the past and another way in the presence or he isn't full of power one day and lost his power the next day he isn't healing one day and can't heal the next day it doesn't matter what man says about god if god said he's the healer he's still the healer it doesn't matter what a church depicts or decor declares it does not matter that does not determine who he is his word determines who he is and his word says he's a healer he's a deliverer he's a savior he's already done those things and what he did before he still does today because he is the same. amen whatever he was in the past is exactly who he is in the present therefore if you discover jesus of the past you've also discovered jesus of the present or if you've discovered jesus of the future and or you've also discovered him of the future because he's continually the same the word forever means in all ages of the future and all in all time to come this phrase depicts all future time to come including all ages that'll ever be known so in the millennium he'll be the same in eternity he'll be the same today he's the same you know the prophet of god will begin to cry this out in his ministry as he would come here and begin that screen would begin to cry out and he said he would say it like this he said the theme of my revivals is this declaring to the world that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he said that through every critic and every type of criticism i that i know that satan has done everything i know could be done speaking of to try to overthrow that but every time god has brought it out triumphantly and won a victory every time hallelujah check it test it it's been tested government agents everything else i've seen and sworn it he said i have a thorn in the flesh an angel of satan who follows and tries to buff it or tries to beset that but he's been defeated in every case by the holy spirit and god has come through every time triumphantly and now i'm here to declare he's still the same so if it came through every time triumphantly and back 50 60 years ago he's still the same this god has not lost a battle and he's not about to lose a battle hallelujah but he comes out every time winning and triumphant this is what he would say this is what was said of him when you can read in revel revelations 2 about the one who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he this is he of whom it is said it's the same jesus both lord and christ the only the one and only the lord god almighty and beside him there is no other there he is the savior walking in the midst of the churches throughout the seven church ages amen did he save people in the first church age did he save him in the second church age the third church age the fourth the fifth the sixth is he gonna save somebody in the seventh he has to because he's the same hallelujah he didn't come to the seventh age to call it quits and say i'm done with it and throw up his hands in the feed no sir he came just as victorious and just as triumphant as he did in the first he's doing it again in the last stage i don't know any showing hell even tonight i still heal i still deliver i still set free because i am the same he's walking in the midst of his churches throughout the seven ages what he was in the first age he is in all ages oh my mama to every believer how many believers do we have here in the building well he's the same god to you as he was to paul he's the same god to you as he was to moses to know all of the old testament prophets and believers down through the old testament and all the ones down to the new he's the same god to you the believer in this seventh church age [Music] he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did once he's still doing and will keep on doing it does not matter what a church declares it does not matter what man declares it only matters what he said and what he said what he's not what what he did wants he's still doing how you say that's brother branham no that's what the scripture says he's the same yesterday today and forever what he did once he's still doing amen what he did on the day of pentecost he's still doing he's still feeling with the holy ghost he's still changing hearts he's still lifting up young people and the darkest age has ever been just like he did in the first days he had young people that served him in this hour he has young people that serves him hallelujah he's still raising the dead he's still there he's still making the lame to walk [Applause] he's still healing he's still delivering he's still doing all of that the wall to try to tell you he's not but his word says he is the worders of the world are trying to tell you he's not to say but his word declares i am the lord god and i change not he says you notice jesus is walking along in the midst of the churches alone there's no one else with him neither indeed can there be for he alone wrought her salvation amen i don't see a man calls himself the holy spirit walking there i don't see a man that calls himself elohim elohim walking there he alone walks in the churches and the candlesticks all the glory belongs to him all the praise belongs to him all the worship belongs to him and if you're giving worship to a man you're idolatry you're a heathen you need salvation in your dark stricken soul because our god deserves all the glory he goes on to say says it he says see there's no one else but him he alone wrought her salvation and has purchased her with his own blood he owns her man that's some shouting grounds right there he owns her how many he's heard there tonight then he owns you the devil said he did but the devil lied to you he tried to keep you with his nonsense and his worldly thing but that was that wasn't who owned you you were born in a fallen condition but that's not who owns you he owns you god owns that body and the devil can't do nothing with it and she gives him all the glory and that glory he will not share with another therefore there is no pope with him there is no archbishop with him mary the mother of his earthly bodies not with him there's not a prophet with him amen there's no there's no one else but him he does not speak and turn to a father for he is the father he does not turn and give orders to the holy spirit for he is god the eternal spirit and it is his life that's flowing and pulsating in the church and giving her life and without him there would be no life salvation is of the lord there is no one with him when he tries the fierceness of his wrath of the fiery furnace it was not another it was him who hung up on the cross and gave his blood he is the author and the finisher of our faith he is the alpha and omega of our salvation and we are espoused to him and not another we don't belong to the church we belong to him his word is law creed's dogmas bylaws constitution have no effect on his yes it is jesus alone who walks in the midst of his church it is god in her willing and doing his own good pleasure never forget that you have only one relationship to god and god has only one relationship to you and that is jesus and jesus alone he would take another place about the spirits of god and he said it wasn't seven different spirits it was one spirit working in seven church ages it's one in the same he said he will always be the same he will always act the same he said the seven messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit the very same word the very same acts of power they had at pentecost why because he's the same and it's him walking through the churches it's him it's not a man it's not it's not a prophet it's not a pope it's not an archbishop it's him amen and he said if it's a true church it'll have the same word it'll have the same spirit it'll have the same acts of the power they had in pentecost by experience it will be a pentecostal church because it's the same there will be tongues there will be interpretation and prophecies and healings and god will be in the midst of her and god will be in the midst of her and god will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has whoa how did he declare himself as them two apostles walked to the gate called beautiful that man was out there begging for harm they said silver and gold have unknown but what i have i'll give it unto you in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk hallelujah and god declared what they said to be the truth because out of them came a power that would speak to a a body that was lame and not walking and shriveled up and died and all of a sudden power would leave their lips and enter into a body and their body rise up and begin to dance and shout and give god praise god was vindicated i am in their midst and if a church says they believe jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever but deny his power deny his works deny his words the church that believes in jesus christ will do the works of jesus christ because it has the life of jesus christ he said when a man stands and says he's a gospel preacher and wants to say the days of miracles are passed he said that's a seed of discrepancy when a man says and says he's a minister a pastor of a church so and he does not believe that jesus christ is the same in every detail look at the details amen a lot of details there but people want to cut some of them out because it don't fit what they're they're they they think it ought to be anymore he said the same in every detail except the physical body but the same yesterday today and forever that's a seed of discrepancy except the physical body what is it now it's not jesus in one flesh anymore him walking through minden and him him going down the interstate in a car and him going to work it's not him walking as he did 2000 years ago but we know on the day of pentecost he put forth his spirit into men and it was no longer jesus with them it was jesus in them amen jesus walking in them talking in them as we saw it as we just talked about it it was jesus same jesus that was just a few days ago in shoe leather healing the lame saving the loss touching bodies yeah i mean delivering bound people all of a sudden how's jesus in a body again but not that body but many bodies amen and this is what we believe in this day it's not jesus in a physical form as he was 2000 years ago but there still is a jesus on this earth there is still a body here on this earth and that body is called the bride of jesus christ and but it's not her spirit it's not her mind it's not her power it's the same god working through her speaking through her touching lives changing hearts healing the sick hallelujah anyone that says the miracles and the apostolic ages pass as a seed of discrepancy when they say there's no such thing as divine healing that's a seed of discrepancy and the world is full of it but the life as we know comes through the vine and we are the branches but it's the same life if it's not the same life in that branch it'll give a different fruit i mean we've heard that right i mean how many has ever grafted a tree anybody out there ever grafted a tree i can remember somebody doing that and they would take an orange and put it on another citrus and do things and and it was just amazing that that that limb could still give forth whatever life was in it but it could never bear the original because it wasn't of the original but he said when that when that vine ever puts forth another branch it'll be just like the original and it'll have the same fruits as the original there'll be healings in that branch there'll be deliverances in that branch there'll be testimonies in that branch of god's amazing grace and salvations in that brain there'll be baptism of the holy ghost in that branch there'll be the lame that can walk again in that branch it'll be the blind that can see again in that branch there'll be so much healing and deliverance why it's the same life amen he said if the vine ever puts forth another branch it'll be the same kind of branch that the acts that the book of acts was wrote on it'll have the same doctrine it'll have the same power it'll show the same signs because it's the same kind of church they had at the beginning not a new church the same kind not a new power the same kind he said it i referenced it a while ago in malachi 3 6 he says i am the lord and i change not it's man that changes him not god that changes he man changes him how's he changing by changing his word god cannot change he's infinite what he did it before still works today so he gave a prescription for overcoming and being baptized with the holy ghost that prescription is still good today i don't care what theologian says it ain't and we get it a different way and we get it without sensation and it still happens the same way amen the prescription will work every time if you give it the same way as the prophet of god if you give it the same way the prescription will work the same way this we're not dealing with a man-made prescription a man-made drug where sometimes you know you can put it in you know uh brother jr and he'll have certain side effects you can put it in brother aaron he'll have other side effects you can put it in me and it'll have other side effects it's man-made stuff but we're not talking about man-made creeds and man-made dogmas we're talking about the life that was given on the day of pentecost amen it's not man-made it's god made therefore it has the same side effect if it's given to the the same way that peter gave it it'll have the same effect on every person that takes it it'll change their life it'll rewrite their history and mercy will be poured out upon them and they'll never want to go back to what they ever was before if it's given the same way it'll have the same effects it'll change their lives it'll change their hearts it'll change their motives it'll change their objectives it'll change everything about them why because if it's given the same way it'll have the same effects [Applause] hallelujah and i believe we're living in a time that we ought to be giving it the same way peter gave it [Applause] men and brother repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and ye shall receive the holy ghost that's not a hope so it'll have that effect that's not a maybe that's not a maybe some way no it'll have the same effect the same one it had on peter it turned him from a man that couldn't hold his temper and he would say all kinds of things without even thinking he would do all kinds of things to wherever jesus would rebuke him and say get behind me satan and he would deny him but when he took that prescription it changed him amen he stand up on a soapbox and preach the gospel of jesus christ and 3 000 souls give their hearts to god why they have the same effects it'll put something in you to want to tell somebody what god did for you amen this prescription this baptism this holy ghost is the same power it's not just shake hands and say well i'm going to turn over new leaf and i'm going to do better you know people get a little they get that they they come through a prayer line and get a touch and they think well i'm just going to turn over a new league i want to do better you know i'm going to do better about my church attendance uh i'm going to do better about things and they're just turning over new leafs many times but if it's ever went down and you took the prescription there won't be no more turning over new leaves then it won't even be debatable if you need to be in the house of god or not it won't be noticeable you know this prescription deals with your excuses it changes your excuse it takes away your excuses the excuses of why you can't live it or won't learn and that won't clean up won't change take the prescription it'll deal with it it'll change you amen same power let's not turn a new loop let new leaf and do better shake hands with the preacher no sir you shall receive the holy ghost the power of god will come upon you and change your ways he said speak in tongues you'll lay hands on the sick cast out devils do the same as they did for how long to the end of the disciples that's what man wants to say is to the end of the disciples that was just for the disciples or other greater works was just for the prophet it would have put limitations on god god don't put limitations on himself man puts limitations on god amen he said to the end of the disciples he said you're a false prophet if you say that for jesus christ the bible teaches us he's the same yesterday and the promise is unto you and your children and to them that are far off he says say it with me how many every age every generation every color ever creed for everyone every whatever it is as many as god calls and if god calls you he commands you to be baptized in the name of jesus christ and receive the holy ghost then christ himself lives in you and there's never no more uncertainty to it you've got the bible and you stand on it you can live on it you can die on it and you'll rise on it he said just like rebecca who watered the camel the very camels that she watered she rode out to meet her bridegroom and the very god that we preach about the very word which is god the very god that's in the word will rise us up someday by the baptism of the holy ghost and he said and our critics will be killed by the same power that raises you into glory whoa he says oh my rise up and ride on it hallelujah what are you doing brother timothy is it by our mind by our power no we're by the power of the holy ghost and the bride of jesus christ that we can rise up and ride this word tie ourselves to this word and know this word won't fail us it won't change it's not going to change mystery but it's the same yesterday today and forever and we're going to ride it all the way to our body change critics can rise up they can rise up or they're going to fall one of these days but we the bride of christ are going to rise above every critic going to rise above every storm it's going to rise above every devil it's going to rise above every temptation going to rise above every spirit of lay on the seal and rise above it all writing on the word of god the same word and the same power has the same effects has the same works in the life of the bride of jesus christ rise up and right on it it's time you get off your complexes and you get on the word oh my my my it's time you get off your feelings and get on the word ain't that right brother elle get out of your feelings right it's time you get out of your feelings because feelings change you know people have had great feelings towards this church and a few years later they hated this church feelings changed somebody can have a great feeling towards you and then weeks later something can happen or maybe nothing even happened feelings change you can't ride your feelings you can only ride the word complexes you can't ride complexes get off of them and get on the word amen complex is going to take you to destruction get off of them get on the word it's the only thing that's going to get us out of here is a word that don't change hallelujah you know paul rader he said he talks about wrote the song only believe all things are possible i only believe believe in what a church a creed no you believe in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen you know we know the story but he was in the missionary fields fell sick had some kind of fever that took him down but he said anybody knew him knew paul was a believer in divine healing i mean that would no doubt be what would cause him to write the song the angel of the lord love to hear only believe said he got real sick kept getting sicker and sicker and sicker and got getting dark in the room and asked his wife to come close he said honey i may be going stand by my bedside and pray for me as it kept getting darker he just kept confessing the word god you're my healer darker god you're my healer darker god you're see god it don't matter how dark it gets god's word don't change amen kept on going after a while he passed completely out he said he thought he had a dream back there in oregon somewhere you know he's raised up he's back there again and he was a a he used to chop wood and timber a logger for a living his boss was in the logwood said paul go up and take a certain tree about certain size and bring it down here and said all right in this dream he went up this hill and climbed it smelling them wonderful pine needles having himself a glorious time said he took the tree and he he fell it struck his axe down in it took it down said it fell down he trimmed all the limbs off of it made it the size of the boss ask and said he reached down to grab it because the boss had told him to take it back to camp so he reached down and put his knees down and squatted down into position his muscles began to bulge and his legs and he put all the effort he could into it but he couldn't move it he couldn't change it he said i've lost my strength i i i can't i can't get that log up he said i used to pack twice that size tried again and wrestled and wrestled until he just wore out if what was it he said it was that fever just depleted him and he said here he was wrestling and trying to get it back to camp you know i just can't go no farther i'm gone and he wrestled he said your brother adam was saying he said that's the way a lot of people do he said they just take a word and they try to run it over here and make it say this and make it do that wrestle with it take it through seminaries cut it out cut this out put this make a greek word out of it here hebrew word out of the first thing you know it becomes like that and it's not the word of god no more because you're wrestling with it he said you're wrestling with it you take it over some dr joel this dr phd and ask him what he thinks about it and ask what this one thinks about it he said well this my mental telepathy other one said it's fanaticism ah first thing you know you wrestle it all the way down to a meeting and the scene the spirit of god come down and heard someone speaking unknown tongues and you're wrestling with and calling the devil wrestling with it he said you hear people shout and he say well it's only just excitement he said you're just wrestling with it he said i seen a man stand on a platform by the power of discernment tell people who they were and out in the meetings and what was wrong just the way the bible said jesus done and show the sign of the messiah and i go ask my pastor and you go ask him he says it's telepathy and you just keep wrestling and you never get anywhere but directly he heard his boy his boss's voice call his name and say paul and he said yes boss he said ma that was the most sweetest voice i ever heard he said why are you wrestling with it for so i turned around and said it wasn't his boss it was his real boss it was jesus standing there he said paul you're just wrestling with it wrestling with it wrestling with it he said you see that stream of water laying right there i said yeah he said the stream of water comes right down to the camp he said why don't you just roll that log down to that river and ride it on down to the camp he said oh i never thought of that so he just pushed it over in the water and he jumped on it and the next thing you know he began to go down those ripples and those rapids he said he was just only splashing around having a good time and he began to scream out i'm rotting on it i'm riding on it and when he came to himself he was standing in the middle of the floor screaming to the top of his lungs absolutely healed saying i'm riding on it i'm riding on it i'm riding on it oh hallelujah the bible says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i'm riding on it hallelujah the bible said by his stripes i'm healed i'm riding on it the bible said they shall be there and their offspring with them i'm riding on it hallelujah the bible says the works that i do shall you do also i ride knowledge [Music] hallelujah it's time some of you take those promises of god and quit wrestling on it wrestling with it and just roll it over into the stream of faith and say god i'm going to just jump on your word and where it takes me i'm going to go and i know if i jump on a promise that says he's the lord god that heals all my diseases and i put it into the stream of faith it's going to take me to my healing it's going to take me to my deliverance it's going to take me to all things are possible riding on it jesus the same in every detail except his physical body now it's not just one flesh or one man but many the mighty god the same yesterday today and forever and flesh hid behind human skin brother ronnie long spoke on saturday morning this comes to my mind i'd suggest go listen to a wonderful sermon all those was really good but my they said saturday morning as he spoke about god taking your flesh and your insecurities and your weaknesses and setting it up for the devil's defeat telling the devil it's a setup as we heard brother henry talk about jesus as he walked to the maniac of gatter and that man still stopped there and those demons looked in those eyes and said how did you get in there it's a setup amen the devil may look at you and he looked at jesus and thought there ain't no way he could be the messiah he studied him he tried him he talked to him he spoke to him but i just couldn't have because if he would have known that was the lord jesus christ the messiah he would have done everything he could to keep him as safe as possible don't touch him because you touch him and that blood's released it's going to cause all kind of trouble but he looked at him he didn't know it looked too humbly you know he looked too humble it wasn't impossible this could be the christ surely if his wife you know the devil no doubt talked to his demons in a security team many times and said you know i i i he can't be how would god come in a little baby how could he come in a human being of all things to choose why would he choose one of them frail little things one of them insignificant things i look at all of them down through the ages we killed every one of them we have defeated every one of them and there's no there's nothing they can do surely if he was gonna come he'd come with a a thousand ten thousand angel saluted horns would have blowed it he'd come out of the sky on a golden staircase and step down there and yeah then we'll know that's god but he didn't come that way insignificant there's no way but if it had been studying god's been hid that way a long time and see the devil don't know everything i know we'd like to give him a lot of credit but he don't know god has hid so much from him if he'd have known what was going to happen in the upper room he had done everything he could if he had known what's going to happen in this service he'd have done everything he could amen the old badger skins hid the glory of god badger skins i don't know if it's the same what we call a badger but apparently it wasn't a very good creature and i know badgers ain't very good creatures and i i could see them be equated to human beings because they're not very good creatures evil they'll take a baby's life without even thinking about it without even a moment's thought just to just destroy life after life until we're now in the millions and then murders and rapes and all the things that humans do to humans and god and the devil's like there's no way god could be there even people couldn't see it because it was the skin that held it the glory of god held behind skin and he said now the glory of god is hid behind your skin the god that we've been speaking about with the same power the same in every detail traditions don't see it it's inside the veil where the word was it was inside that skin back there those old badger skins there was no beauty we would desire when it was made flesh and dwelt among it there was no beauty there but now the same thing today there's nothing in a man or woman that can be desired it's what's behind there well you that fellow i know he used to be a drunkard he used to be this i don't care what he used to be i like to shout it when i heard this i don't care what it used to be what's hid behind that skid now is what counts well i used to do this and i used to do that and i used to be there i don't care what it used to be what counts is who's behind you now [Applause] skin the skin blinds people well i remember when that woman used to do this he said i know what she used to do but what about now them skins that was once on a badger but now they're hiding the glory of god got a house behind it it was an animal but now it's housed in the glory of god now one important thing to realize about that badger skin was that badger was dead there wasn't nothing in that badger that was alive try to hang those badges on that tent it tore the places there to put to apart if they was alive fighting and gnashing and carrying on and arguing and fussing oh yeah but we still got some live badgers don't win the church you can't be put in that moment that place to hide the glory of god until that badger skin is dead then it can hide the glory of god then your skin can be changed and be made a housing place for god god indwelling in humanity the whole badgers kins we find out inside there was a word and the word there was a bread the ark sprinkled the shekinah glory now the word is a seed it cannot bring forth unto the sun strikes it the sun's got to be on the sea to make it bring forth you take the word take the word of god your heart walk into this kind of glory when you do it'll bring the manna it'll bring the show bread it'll it only it's only given to a separated people the only ones that can eat it as permitted to eat it is people who's permitted to know it's there paul said changing us from glory to glory back to its original glory he said it's just like a seed of a morning glory the seed of a flower it falls in the ground and the seed of a corn falls in the ground what's the first thing it comes up as a little sprout all the way up into the tassel until we're at seed again as i've said before i there's not a person in this world that's got any sense to put a corn seed in the ground expecting the green bean to come out it ain't going to happen it's not possible if it's a corn at the beginning it'll be a corn at the end amen you can't get a plant a green bean and get a pea it's going to be what was planted in the grounds what's going to come forth that's the laws of god every seed shall bring forth after its kind amen so he planted the first church in the beginning they went into the ground believers paul all of those went into the ground down to the dark ages and we know as we saw the tithe the blade the tassel all the way back to where we are today back to seed again amen so if it had whatever whatever power or whatever life was in that corn at the beginning it's still the same in the at the end it's got life-sustaining power it's got amen that's got the ability to give life it's got the ability to sustain life amen so if god planted at the church at the beginning he was not expecting a different church at the end he was expecting the same church with the same power with the same life with the same works with the same signs and wonders same everything in every detail just different bodies hallelujah why because it wasn't the life of a man that was coming it wasn't the life of us hello somebody it was a life of god and he's moved all the way to where we're at and it's brought him back exactly what he was at the beginning this same ministry the same jesus the same power the same holy ghost the same one that come down on the day of pentecost is the same holy ghost that's manifested today from glory unto glory and glory it's back to the original sea with the baptism of the holy ghost the same signs the same wonders the same baptism the same kind of people acting the same way the same power the same sensations well i thought we're supposed to receive it without sensation he said the same sensation you know people equate that to the quote brother branham talks about mary when she got pregnant she received the seed without sensation and they equate that to the holy ghost no mary was getting pregnant bringing forth the son of god but when mary went up in the upper room read it the other night he said mary went up there and she got just as idiotic as the rest of them did he said well y'all bunch of idiots thank you my brothers were two you're a bunch of holy rollers thank you my brothers would too you're a bunch of crazies thank you my brothers was too you're a bunch of fanatics thank you my brothers was too i i i i'm sorry i don't understand when we got a world of full of fanatics you're talking about fanatics and crazies we got a bunch of them there's fanatics for the government there's fanatics against the government there's fanatics for this sports team there's fanatics for that there's fanatics for all kinds of stuff well if the world can be fanatic about worldly things how come i can't be a fanatic about godly things how come i can't express the same god in my life that moved in paul's life that moved in peter's life that moved to mary's life he's changing us from glory to glory to glory and one of these days it's going to change us from this whole vile body into an immortal body never to go back again hallelujah changes the very molecules same wonders same baptisms same kind of people acting the same way with the same power same sensation glory to glory the next will be changed from this glory into the body like his own glorious body where we shall see him amen hallelujah let's go to joshua 4 1 for a moment as we read god spoke to joshua he said as i was with moses so shall i be with you what was that saying the very same god that was manifested in moses is the same one that's going to manifest himself in your life the same continuity he didn't change he didn't move he didn't waver he showed them to be the same very quickly and in this scripture it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over jordan that the lord spake unto joshua would say and take ye twelve men out of the people out of every tribe of man and command ye them saying take ye hints out of the midst of jordan out of the place where the priest's feet stood firm twelve stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you should lodge this night then joshua said to the 12 men whom you ever whom you had prepared the children of israel out of every tribe of man and joshua 7 passover before the ark of the lord your god in the midst of the jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon this shoulders upon his shoulders according unto the number of the tribes of children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones why are these stones sitting here why you keep bringing them up why you keep talking about them why are they important why are they piled over there like that he said then you shall answer them that the waters of the jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it was passed over jordan and the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel forever and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and they took 12 stones out of the midst of jordan and the lord spake unto joshua answering to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried them over with them under the place where they lodged and laid them down there and joshua set the swell stones in the midst of the jordan in the place where the feet of the priests were bare the ark of the covenant stood and they were they are there until this day for the priests which bear the ark stood in the midst of the jordan until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the people hastened and passed over and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over that the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presence of the people and the children of reuben and the children of gad hath the tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as moses spake unto them about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of the jericho and on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel and they feared him as they feared moses why because they saw the same god that operated in moses is now operated in joshua and god said i want a memorial to mark this day that the same god that was in the red sea is the same god in the jordan and when your kids ask what mean you buy these stones you can tell them my god is the same you can tell them he's the same yesterday today and forever and there's no doubt in your life you witness him to be the same oh hallelujah we know stones also represent the testimony amen amen god has allowed testimony it's a testimony or a memorial that god has brought us safely to this place the same god that led us to the red sea is the same god today the same one that brought us to the wilderness is the same god today the same one that spoke with moses is now leading us why does ministers constantly bring the testimonies forward and place them there in a pile service after service after service amen they bring the stone of deliverance and they lay it right there and say see that stall god heal cancer there he healed it right now see that stone god heal the brain bleed again he'll heal it right now see that stone god took the druggie off the streets and made him a son of god he'll do the same again give me a little more volume god is still the same [Applause] hallelujah god has given us our testimonies in this church as a memorial you kids can never declare god don't heal cancer amen our young people can never say god don't raise somebody off a dead bed and put him on a place to praise god and to lift her voice and to give glory and honor to god god did it and if he did it then he'll do it now hallelujah i want to raise a rock of testimony tonight since orlando will you stand up i'm raising a rock of testimony god brought her to those raging waters and the priesthood was anointed to preach faith in such a way that the rock could be brought out of that river and brought to your to your view right now i want the camera to look at her

they have backslidden king in jehoshaphat going after an enemy one time and he met the prophet because the gospel said hey we got to have the word of the lord we got to have somebody to speak the word of the lord concerning these is there a prophet in israel absolutely yeah well this is old guy he's thorn in my side i don't i hate him said well let's hear what he's got to say and they get to where

he said but bring me a minstrel and he brings him a minstrel begins to play and the spirit of the lord begins to move and the word of god speaks it says dig this valley full of ditches you need water dig these valleys full of ditches you dig them out and the more you dig out the more i'm going to feel and sit down in those ditches when you get deep enough there's going to be some rocks down there and i want you to grab those rocks and when the enemy comes in they begin to realize their defeat and they begin to run take those rocks with you they are a testimony take those rocks with you what
