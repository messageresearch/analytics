And if you have a need you want to lift to the Lord, I reminded of a time [music] that we were told that our daughter wasn't developing properly.

Whatever your need is, if [music] you want to lift it to him as we pray together, Brother Joe, if you would come. Amen. [music] Let's turn to the Lord in prayer. Amen. Let's just bow [music] our heads and take these knees to him this morning. Approach them as if this is your your daughter with twins. [music] One of them struggling struggling to develop and to form. take it as your brother-in-law who just [music] recently passed away and or a family friend in need. Father, we we come before your [music] throne this morning, Lord. What a privileged people we are. Lord, that in this hour, Lord, the the waning hours of the Gentile [music] dispensation, yet you have called the people, Lord, a people by your name, Lord, they've taken on not the name of [music] some church or some idea, but Lord, they've taken on your name, your character, God, they've taken on your reputation, [music] Father. And and we're here today, God, because a word has been spoken over us. And Father, how thankful we are, Lord. when we look back at maybe the difficulties that we face in life and Satan will sidet [music] track us Lord and will get us from seeing who we really are Lord putting [music] obstacles in front of us strongholds around us God trying to keep us from reaching our potential that idea [music] that thought that you saw us before the foundation but God we come before you today Lord as sons and daughters of God recognizing our position in the body recognizing our place in the headship Lord of Christ and the economy of God. And Lord, we just come. We want to say, Lord, that we love you. We're thankful, Father, for this word that you've given us in this hour. We're thankful, Lord, that our hearts have been turned. We're thankful, Lord God, that we we have a desire to come to the house of God, [music] Lord, to worship the one true and living God, Lord. We're thankful, Lord, that we no longer desire the things of the world, but we desire the heavenly things, Father. And we're just asking today, [music] Lord, that there would be a mighty rushing wind of your presence just come and sweep in this place this morning, God, and just fill our hearts to gladness, to overflowing this morning, Lord. Though we may be trial on every side, that we may, Lord, be going through trials and situations, but God, maybe even in our trial, may we worship you and Lord, dig deep this morning, per se, and just offer up a sacrifice of praise to you, Father, for you're worthy to receive honor. You're worthy to receive praise. You're worthy to receive our our worship. And God, we want to be a people that are mindful of who you are and what your needs are, Father. And not just our needs, not just our desires, not just our wants, but God, your desires. A desire to be worshiped, a desire to be loved, a desire to be cared for. And Lord, we want to honor you by giving you [music] what you deserve this morning. And Lord, may we just love you with our worship, love you with our our amens and our hallelujah and our lifting of our hands and the responding to your word today. And and Father, as your children, we petition you on behalf of these needs that were mentioned. Lord, we pray you'd comfort the family of this one who's passed on. Father, bring them together and bring them peace and comfort, Lord. And Lord, Brother Sam, the family friend there in the need. May you just go to [music] that need and minister, Lord. And Lord, we pray for McCagan and these unborn [music] children, Lord, that are in her womb at this time. We pray for that one in particular, Lord, that's underdeveloped, Father. May you just go to her even now, Father. And may you just breathe the breath of life into that womb, Lord. And may these babies come out healthy [music] and strong, Father. Lord, we're not looking at the doctor's report. We're not looking at the sonograms and alter sounds. [music] We're looking to the word of promise. You said whatsoever things that you desire when you pray. [music] If you can believe, then you can have whatsoever it is that you desire. Lord, we're believers this morning. And we're petitioning your throne to do what the doctors can't do. Father, may you move now, Lord, on behalf of McCagan and these babies. And Lord, [music] we pray for brother Aaron and brother Timothy as their way this morning ministering. God, use them for your glory, Lord.

[music] And we just pray, dear God, today you who looks down from above and then comes and walks among us by your Holy Spirit, will you come and discern every heart and see what the need is that is there [music] behind that hand because it's never lifted in vain. [music] You know, every motion, every move, every desire of the heart. So we pray that you'll just manifest your glory today by bringing deliverance in thy holy name. Lord, will you just speak to hearts [music] and lives and reveal yourself as only you can. And as we minister today, Lord, may we not minister [music] intellectually. But Lord, may the Holy Spirit speak today. May the anointing of the Holy Spirit take over your servant. I'm here. I'm yours reporting for duty asking now Lord that you would speak as we will start Lord with your holy sacred [music] word and then we will begin to speak and we will move into the uncction of the spirit. I pray Lord the audience will move into the same uncction and will hear what the spirit is saying and Lord you'll deal with their hearts and as we minister Father may you bring victory in lives in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Amen. God bless you. Thank you. If you'll turn with me to second Timothy 1 verse 7. We'll read from there this morning and then one more scripture before you're seated which will be found in 2 Corinthians chapter 10. But I just want to read this one portion this morning. For God has not given us a spirit of fear, &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and a sound mind. &gt;&gt; And then turn with me to 2 Corinthians chap 10:3. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exaltth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought. Somebody say every thought. to the obedience of Christ &gt;&gt; and having in readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled. And of course our obedience given us by the word here is to cast down imaginations &gt;&gt; and every high thing. And then when we do that, then he will revenge all disobedience, every enemy that has tried to come and fortify something in your life. God bless you. Can be seated. I'd like you to turn to to um to put your heart together with mine today as we look into this subject. I want to speak on pulling down strongholds. We are here in a in a very vicious fight &gt;&gt; and we face heartache and trouble and despair. You know, some of you uh like our sister Sher Wilkerson got bad news about a brother-in-law today who was um he just had a recent heart attack and went into surgery today and died on the operating table. And this is a life where you know time of of in where we're living in where that there's all kinds of difficulties, situations and problems because we live in an imperfect world. &gt;&gt; And we are born in bodies that decay. I don't know if you noticed yours, but mine is decaying. And I'm for sure if you know that as as you reach a certain age, from there on, as you reach a peak, you just start eating the same things and drinking the same water and doing the same exercise, but you get weaker and weaker &gt;&gt; because we're born in bodies that decay. And and to minds that wrestle with sin, yet our souls are saved. Yes. &gt;&gt; I I I want you to get this in your heart today about your salvation which is complete which is real &gt;&gt; and and even if you have not yet received the Holy Spirit and which is the seal into the day of redemption but you have just done that very first work where that you have repented of your sins and you have accepted God's pardon for sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you have you're like a a a baby in the womb and and any father or any parent is concerned even about the child in the womb. &gt;&gt; And so you are very loved already by the father even though you might not have come to a full birth as yet &gt;&gt; and you're valuable to the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even told us that. He said in question answers on the Holy Ghost, he said, "You have to protect the church from the hard bruises of Satan because she is pregnant. She's expecting children that are in that that justification, that's conception, sanctification, which is growth stages. And though they have not yet been fully birthed, um they, you know, they are still a child in the womb. And you must protect the church from the hard bruises of Satan. &gt;&gt; So I'm trying to tell you, no matter where you are in your Christian walk today, you're valuable to God. &gt;&gt; And and you and you might ask, why if I'm saved, why is there a battle in my mind? Now, I touched on this in my closing ser uh statements on my last service that I was here a couple of weeks ago. And and I want to pick this up today because many are questioned, you know, even how could I even have the Holy Ghost? And yet I I fight and deal with, you know, terrible thoughts, sometimes vile thoughts, ugly thoughts, sometimes filthy thoughts that come in my mind. &gt;&gt; And and I just want to say it's because my friend, the mind is the battlefield. And of course, those are weapons that he has to to come against you to try to get you to walk in defeat. And and of course, the mind being the battleground, it's the very ground where Satan then tries to build his strongholds. &gt;&gt; And Paul tells us that Satan can build strongholds in our mind, but we are to tear them down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's get it clear that that the devil cannot touch a redeemed soul. So, he attacks the mind. &gt;&gt; And if he can't possess you, he will oppress you. &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. If he can't possess you, he will oppress you. And and and brother Brandham told us in the message future home he said Satan can tempt but he cannot get a bornagain Christian &gt;&gt; for God for the foundation of the world foraw him and he sent Jesus to redeem him and the blood speaks for them. SO HOW CAN HE sin when it can't be seen even by God? &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; SO SATAN KNOWS HE CAN'T PLUCK YOU OUT OF GOD'S HAND. So he WORKS TO WEAR YOU DOWN &gt;&gt; TO CLOUD YOUR JOY TO WEAKEN your confidence TO MAKE YOU DOUBT WHO YOU ARE IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND SINCE HE CAN'T TOUCH YOUR SOUL, HE FOCUS HIS his assaults on your thoughts to keep you from living IN VICTORY. BECAUSE SATAN KNOWS THAT YOUR PATHWAY to God, to his power is faith. And faith is the only language that heaven responds to. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Bible said in Hebrews 1 11:6, HE SAID, "FOR WITHOUT FAITH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." &gt;&gt; SO GOD SIMPLY CANNOT RESPOND TO UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; You see, it breaks the law of his own nature. So the devil, if he can get you to waver, TO DOUBT GOD'S PROMISE, he he knows YOU CAN'T RECEIVE THE VICTORY that belongs to you. And it's my desire to see every one of you walk in victory. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that, of course, if you waver, they you're like a double-minded man. You know that you're and you're unstable in all your ways. And the Bible said, "Let not that man think he shall receive anything from the Lord." that when you come to God, YOU MUST BELIEVE that he is. You must have a steadfast faith, not a wavering faith, you know, not a not a something reaching out and then withdrawing and reaching out, oh well, I'm not worthy. We're reaching out and say, I'm not good enough. I'm reaching out and and then withdrawing. But you must be steady in your approach to God. You see, you see THAT THAT'S THE STRATEGY OF HELL THOUGH is to sever your line of communication. To make it seem as though heaven is silent and to fill your MIND WITH SO MUCH NOISE and confusion that you can't hear the still small voice. &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW GOD SPEAKS IN MANY WAY. GOD WILL SPEAK to you from the preaching of the word this morning. He'll speak to you through recorded sermons. He will he will speak to you through written text of of men of God OF MANY MANY THOUSANDS of years ago. Whether it was Moses or Enoch or whether it be of Jeremiah or Isaiah or or Ezekiel or Daniel or or some in the New Testament like the Apostle Paul. You see, God is speaking. He'll you can hear his voice in nature. You can hear his voice in in other children of God as they speak to you. There's been A MANY OF TIMES, YOU KNOW, GOD SPOKE TO ME WHILE I WAS JUST HAVING A PHONE conversation and something was said and God quenched something in my heart. You see, but again, you you see the strategy of hell is to sever your line of communication to make it seem like heaven is silent. AND AND I DOUBT I REALLY DOUBT THAT God &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; um truly withdraws and and gives you the silent treatment. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I DON'T I DON'T JUST THINK THAT HE'S a moody God &gt;&gt; that that you know, he just kind of gives you the silent treatment, but I I wonder really if it's really God being silent or I wonder if your mind is being filled with so much noise, &gt;&gt; with so much confusion of what's going on. YOU SEE, IF HE CAN CLOUD YOU WITH DEPRESSION, &gt;&gt; THEN THE SUNSHINE OF GOD'S GOODNESS CAN'T WARM your heart. &gt;&gt; AND THOUGH YOUR SOUL IS REDEEMED, IT BECOMES LIKE A SEED THAT'S buried in frozen ground, is alive, but is unfruitful. YOU SEE THE BIBLE SAID THAT THOSE ARE THESE ARE THEY THAT ARE sown among thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the WORRIES OF LIFE CHOKE THE WORD and it becomes unfruitful. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE IF I COULD JUST GET YOU THIS MORNING TO DOUBT YOUR DOUBTS. IF I COULD GET YOU TO TAKE AWAY EVERY LIE, EVERY FEAR, EVERY REASONING, AND CAST IT DOWN IN THE NAME OF JESUS. IF I COULD GET YOU TO DEMOLISH ARGUMENTS AND EVERY DEMONIC CLAIM THAT SETS ITSELF UP AGAINST THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AND TO TAKE CAPTIVE EVERY THOUGHT TO MAKE IT OBEDIENT TO CHRIST, THEN YOU WOULD SEE THAT THE BATTLE WAS NEVER YOURS TO BEGIN WITH. IT WAS THE IT BELONGS TO THE LORD. IF IF YOU'LL JUST STAND UP ON HIS WORD, IF YOU'LL JUST HOLD FAST TO YOUR CONFESSION OF FAITH AND LET THE HOLY GHOST WASH OVER YOU AND AND IT'LL DO LIKE 1 JOHN 1 AND7 SAYS, THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, HIS SON, CLEANSES YOU from all sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you something. Maybe we don't sin like smoke, drink, lack, fornicate, adulterize, and all of that, but every one of us falls short. &gt;&gt; And if EVERY ONE OF US, ANY ONE OF US, IF ME OR ANY PROPHET, any priest, any any great man, WHOEVER YOU WOULD THINK, NAME HIM THROUGH THE BIBLE, WOULD STAND BEFORE GOD, he would be blemished and sinful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because their angels are even black in his presence. &gt;&gt; He is so holy. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S WHY WE ALWAYS NEED AN INTERCESSOR. &gt;&gt; WE ALWAYS NEED THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, HIS SON, BECAUSE WE MAKE WE MAKE ENOUGH MISTAKES in one day to be wiped off the earth forever. &gt;&gt; But his mercy and his goodness hold us. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT BLOOD NOT ONLY REDEEMS YOUR SOUL, IT GIVES YOU VICTORY IN YOUR MIND. And that's WHAT I WANT TO HELP YOU WITH TODAY IS, YOU KNOW, you you SAY, "WELL, BROTHER TIM, I I I I just I'm I'M IN SUCH A BATTLE. I I I I THINK I I BELIEVE I I KNOW THAT GOD TOUCHED MY HEART, AND I I know that I've been changed, but I I I I'm HAVING THIS HORRIBLE BATTLE WITHIN." BUT YOU SEE, WHEN YOU DOUBT YOUR DOUBTS AND WHEN YOU believe his word, THEN THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED UP JESUS FROM THE DEAD RISES UP ON THE INSIDE OF YOU TO SILENCE THE ACCUSER &gt;&gt; AND TO RESTORE YOUR PEACE. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO. WE WANT TO SILENCE THE ACCUSER. WE WANT TO SILENCE THAT ONE THAT SAYS YOU'RE UNWORTHY. &gt;&gt; That you're NOT WORTH LOVING. THAT THAT JUST SAYS PUNISH YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU FEEL SO WORTHLESS. &gt;&gt; TRUE. You are unworthy. &gt;&gt; You were a miserable, wretched sinner. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. But the blood has redeemed you &gt;&gt; and has restored you to sunship. The Bible SAID, AS I QUOTED AGAIN, IN WHOM WE HAVE REDEMPTION THROUGH HIS BLOOD, &gt;&gt; THE FORGIVENESS of sins. &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, WHAT MANNER OF LOVE THE FATHER HATH BESTOWED UPON US THAT WE SHOULD BE CALLED THE SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SILENCE THAT ACCUSER THAT SAYS YOU'RE NOT WORTH LOVING. YOU SHUT UP THAT DEVIL THAT SAYS that and and THAT THAT ACCUSES AND YOU SAY, "BUT GOD SO LOVED ME." I WANT YOU TO GET IT. I WANT YOU TO MAKE THIS PERSONAL. WE WE TAKE JOHN 3:16 AND SAY, "WELL, GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD." I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT THIS MORNING AND SAY, "GOD SO LOVED ME &gt;&gt; THAT GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR ME." &gt;&gt; SO I AM WORTH SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; HE GAVE HIMSELF FOR ME. &gt;&gt; There was an old man. There was a story of an old man, you know, he was poor and seemed to be a forgotten old soul and nobody cared about him and he just eaked out a living, maybe picking up aluminum cans or whatever. And one day, you know, picking out up his cans and trying to trying to make a few cents, he somebody come by and was reckless and hit him and be, you know, broke him all up in an accident. The ambulance takes him into the hospital and in the hospital there where uh he is laying there seemed like dead almost lifeless and you know there was the doctors got to talking and they looked at him said this old man you know he don't have any life he ain't got any money he ain't worth anything you know we we're not even going to spend our time patching this old man up you know he's all broken and such a mess he ain't ain't worth fixing. And he wasn't as dead as what they thought. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he SPOKE UP AND SAID, "BUT I AM WORTH SOMETHING." &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST GAVE HIS OWN BLOOD FOR ME. I AM WORTH SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; AND I I WANT YOU TO REALIZE THAT JUST BECAUSE THE WORLD BECAUSE OTHERS LOOK AT YOU AND SAY, "YOU'RE A BROKEN PIECE OF HUMANITY AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH INVESTING IN AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH ANYTHING." JESUS DECLARED YOUR WORTH &gt;&gt; AND HE SO LOVED YOU WHEN YOU WERE UNLOVABLE &gt;&gt; WHEN NOBODY CARED ABOUT YOU. OH, NOBODY CARES FOR ME LIKE JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAID OVER HIS MASTERPIECES IN IN ZEPHANIAH 3:17, HE REJOICES OVER YOU WITH SINGING. &gt;&gt; OH, when God looks at you, it makes him sing. There's some gladness in his heart. And the Bible said these words, "If God did not spare his own son, how shall he not with him freely give me all things?" &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO I AM BELOVED. I AM LOST. I'M ADOPTED. I'M ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SILENCE THAT ACCUSER THAT URGES YOU TO HARM YOURSELF AND TO INFLICT PAIN ON YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU FEEL so worthless. I want to just tell you, you don't have to do that. That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus already bore your punishment. &gt;&gt; He was wounded for your transgressions. &gt;&gt; He was bruised for your iniquities. &gt;&gt; He bore your punishment already. You don't have to carry what the cross has counseledled. &gt;&gt; SO YOU UNBBURDEN YOURSELF. LET IT GO. DROP IT AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS. AND LET AS THE BIBLE SAID COLOSSIANS 3:15, LET THE THE PEACE OF CHRIST RULE IN YOUR HEART AS HE SAID IN PHILIPPIANS 2:5, "LET THE MIND THAT WAS IN CHRIST BE IN YOU." I'M TELLING YOU THIS MORNING, LIFT YOUR HEAD, CHILD OF GOD. YOU'RE NOT LOSING YOUR MIND. YOU'RE WINNING THE WAR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FAITH STILL WORKS. &gt;&gt; THE WORD STILL PREVAILS. THE BLOOD STILL SPEAKS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND VICTORY IS YOURS. &gt;&gt; So cast DOWN THOSE IMAGINATIONS, CAST DOWN EVERY HIGH THING THAT EXALTS ITSELF against the knowledge of God and bring to captivity every thought &gt;&gt; to the obedience of Christ. &gt;&gt; What are these high things? These high things are mental fortresses. &gt;&gt; You know, Satan builds them to block revelation, to choke faith, to keep a believer from walking in full victory. All right. &gt;&gt; These high things are not high because God made them so, though. &gt;&gt; They're high because we've allowed Satan to exalt them in our mind. &gt;&gt; We've allowed them to make something bigger &gt;&gt; than what they are. &gt;&gt; They may be big problems, BUT THEY AIN'T AS BIG as your God. &gt;&gt; You see, you know, THEY THEY ARE IMAGINATIONS. THEY ARE ARGUMENTS. THEIR DECEPTIVE THOUGHTS THAT SETS THEMSELVES UP AS rulers taking the place that ONLY BELONGS TO THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID, "LET THE PEACE OF GOD RULE." &gt;&gt; Rule your mind. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE AGAIN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ALLOW OH YEAH. YOUR SOUL IS SAVED, BUT IN YOUR MIND, &gt;&gt; you're going TO HAVE TO LET HIM RULE YOUR MIND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, a stronghold is not a random thought. &gt;&gt; It's a fortress. &gt;&gt; It's a mental It's a mental citadel that is built by repeated lies. &gt;&gt; Now, some of us, we deal with random thoughts. They just come randomly and they're gone and we dismiss them and whatever. But these are these strongholds are repeated lies, &gt;&gt; fears, reasoning that stand in defiance of God's truth. &gt;&gt; You see, Satan will construct these strongholds ONE BRICK OF DOUBT AT A TIME, &gt;&gt; AND HE WHISPERS LIES UNTIL THEY BECOME TOWERS OF OF FALSE REASONING THAT DOMINATE YOUR THOUGHT LIFE. AND THE BIBLE said as a man thinkketh in his heart so is he. So you know that so AGAIN IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELF YOU CAN NEVER REACH YOUR FULL POTENTIAL AND BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING in your heart &gt;&gt; and you're thinking well I might as well GIVE IN. YOU'RE THINKING I'LL NEVER OVERCOME THIS. YET GOD SAID YOU WILL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE THE BIBLE SAID THE CARNAL MIND is a is enmity. THAT MEANS IS OPPOSED AND IS HOSTILE TO GOD. AND AND SO THESE STRONGHOLDS ARE MENTAL. THEY ARE MENTAL FORTRESSES OF UNBELIEF, &gt;&gt; ARGUMENTS, EXCUSES, &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, INTERNAL DIALOGUES THAT REASON AGAINST THE WORD. THEY'RE THEY'RE INNER VOICES THAT SAY, "GOD won't forgive me. &gt;&gt; I crossed the line." Well, why are you here? Come on. &gt;&gt; If you'd crossed your line, you would want nothing to do with God. &gt;&gt; So, none of you under the sound of my voice right now is has crossed the line. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; SO, GOD WON'T FORGIVE ME. THAT'S A LIE. &gt;&gt; TH THIS SICKNESS WILL NEVER LEAVE. OH, how often we hear that I I'LL NEVER CHANGE. I I'LL NEVER get over this. THAT THE PROMISE IS NOT FOR ME. MY MY CHILDREN WILL NEVER BE SAVED. &gt;&gt; You You see, EACH ONE OF THESE THOUGHTS ARE IMAGINATIONS THERE. THEY'RE A FALSE CREATION OF THE MIND &gt;&gt; THAT DARES &gt;&gt; THAT DARES TO CONTRADICT WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY DECLARED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, you're Come on, church. AMEN. YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE &gt;&gt; AND YOUR OFFSPRING WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; Is that the word? &gt;&gt; AMEN. BELIEVE THAT THOU IN THY HOUSE SHALL BE SAVED. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE GREAT IN THE LAND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT GOD'S WORD SAYS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THE ENEMY WANTS TO CONTRADICT WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY SAID. WELL, I'M SICK AND I'LL NEVER GET OVER THIS. BUT HE WAS WOUNDED FOR YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS AND HE WAS BRUISED FOR YOUR INIQUITY AND WITH HIS STRIPES YOU'RE ALREADY HEALED. &gt;&gt; You see, these are the high things because you let them occupy the highest place. the throne of your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That God, you should be inviting Christ to sit upon. Lord, not just, you know, sit on the throne of my soul, but sit there on the throne of my mind. &gt;&gt; Give me a renewed mind. Let the peace of God rain. &gt;&gt; Rule. You see, these are high things cuz you let them occupy the highest place. &gt;&gt; It's the place only Christ belongs. &gt;&gt; The battles in the mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SAID, "OUR WARFARE IS NOT CARNAL. We we we do not WE WE DON'T FIGHT FLESH AND BLOOD, BUT MIGHTY THROUGH GOD TO THE PULLING DOWN OF STRONGHOLDS." &gt;&gt; I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU, YOU CAN'T REASON A DEMON AWAY. YOU CANNOT COUNSEL REBELLION OUT OF THE FLESH. &gt;&gt; These things must be demolished &gt;&gt; BY THE SPIRITUAL POWER OF GOD'S WORD IN HIS SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; You see, THE THE WORD OF GOD, THE BIBLE SAID, IS ALIVE. IT IS QUICK OR ALIVE AND POWERFUL. IT'S SHARPER THAN ANY TWO-EDGED SWORD. AND IT WASN'T GIVEN TO YOU FOR DECORATION. IT WAS GIVEN TO YOU TO FIGHT WITH. &gt;&gt; AND WHERE YOUR FIGHT IS GOING TO BE IS IN THE BATTLE OF YOUR MIND. YOUR SOUL IS ALREADY WON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN FEAR RISES, FAITH MUST SPEAK. &gt;&gt; WHEN LIES WHISPER, TRUTH MUST SHOUT LOUDER. &gt;&gt; EVERY THOUGHT MUST MUST BOW TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD. AND EVERY IMAGINATION MUST BE BROUGHT CAPTIVE to the obedience of Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. Even angels use divine authority. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. IN THE BOOK OF JUDE chapter nine or verse 9 RATHER, MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL when contended with the devil dared not to bring against him a accusation but said the Lord rebuke YOU. THIS IS A PICTURE OF A POWERFUL CONFLICT &gt;&gt; BETWEEN ANGELIC FORCES. AND AND EVEN MICHAEL THE MIGHTY ARCHANGEL DIDN'T RELY ON HIS OWN STRENGTH AND WISDOM. HE DIDN'T ARGUE WITH SATAN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; If anybody home, &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT ABOUT ARGUING WITH THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE DIDN'T TRY TO OUTWIT HIM. &gt;&gt; HE STOOD UNDER DIVINE AUTHORITY AND [screaming] INVOKED THE POWER OF THE GOD'S WORD AND SAID, "THE LORD REBUKE YOU." &gt;&gt; YES, he did. If an archangel's got to appeal to the Lord's authority to overcome Satan, how much more do we have to depend on God's word, &gt;&gt; on the blood of Jesus, &gt;&gt; the power of the Holy Ghost to bring down the strongholds of our mind. &gt;&gt; Now, the battle begins and ends in the mind. &gt;&gt; And victory COMES WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THE LIE. THE BIBLE SAID, "YOU SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU RECOGNIZE THE LIE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BY WHAT? KNOWING WHAT GOD'S WORD SAY. &gt;&gt; AND THEN LETTING THAT AND THE AND THEN THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE. AND THEN OF COURSE VICTORY COMES WHEN WE REPLACE IT WITH TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus. Victory comes when we reinforce it with the word. &gt;&gt; Thy word have I hid my heart &gt;&gt; that I not sin against thee. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And this is where we sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HEAR BROTHER BRANDHAM PRAY and he says, "Lord, forgive me of my sins." He not talking about, "I I went out with a woman today. &gt;&gt; I committed adultery. I I I went on a binge and drank too much. &gt;&gt; I I smoked a cigarette. I I I I I stole some money. &gt;&gt; That's not what he was saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this is where we sin. &gt;&gt; We when we don't take positions of or possession of the strongholds and destroy them. &gt;&gt; We We're not called [snorts] to manage these strongholds. Amen. &gt;&gt; WE ARE CALLED TO DEMOLISH THEM, &gt;&gt; TO TEAR DOWN EVERY LIE THAT EXALTS ITSELF ABOVE GOD'S PROMISES AND REBUILD OUR THINKING AROUND HIS TRUTH. &gt;&gt; IN FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE TAKE THE TRUTH OF GOD AND WE BUILD A FORTRESS WITH IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So as he said in in Romans 12 and2, be not conformed to this world, but be transformed, be changed by the renewing of the mind. &gt;&gt; A renewed MIND IS A BATTLEFIELD RECLAIMED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO TODAY. MANY OF YOU NEED TO RECLAIM your mind. &gt;&gt; YOUR SOUL ISN'T LOST, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE LOSING YOUR MIND. YOU'RE LETTING SATAN, YOU'RE LETTING WRONG THOUGHTS RULE IT. &gt;&gt; You You see, AND A RENEWED MIND IS A BATTLEFIELD RECLAIMED. IT IS NO LONGER THE DEVIL'S FORTRESS. &gt;&gt; IT BECOMES THE DWELLING PLACE OF CHRIST. HIS PEACE REIGNS. &gt;&gt; THE THOUGHTS THAT ONCE IMPRISONED YOU ARE CHANGED AND AND ARE SANCTIFIED. AND THEN THEY BECOME THE VERY STONES WHICH GOD BUILDS HIS TEMPLE OF PEACE WITHIN YOU. SO I'M TELLING YOU THIS MORNING, TAKE UP YOUR WEAPONS OF WARFARE. &gt;&gt; TAKE THE WORD, TAKE THE BLOOD, TAKE THE NAME OF JESUS AND PULL DOWN EVERYTHING THAT DARES EXALT ITSELF AGAINST GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. If anything, if anything, these lies ought to make you mad. &gt;&gt; They ought to anger you &gt;&gt; like David. You know, how dare HOW DARE THIS GIANT oppose the living God. &gt;&gt; LET FAITH RISE. LET TRUTH REIGN. LET THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST ESTABLISH PEACE WHERE ONCE CHAOS RULED. &gt;&gt; AS HE SAID, THE WEAPONS OF OUR WARFARE ARE MIGHTY THROUGH GOD. &gt;&gt; THE THE WEAPONS WE FIGHT WITH ARE NOT WEAPONS OF THE WORLD. THEY HAVE DIVINE POWER TO DEMOLISH STRONGHOLDS. WE DEMOLISH ARGUMENTS AND AND EVERY PRETENSION THAT SETS ITSELF UP AGAINST THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD. AND WE TAKE EVERY CAPTIVE EVERY THOUGHT &gt;&gt; TO MAKE IT OBEDIENT TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see, fear is faith turned inside out. &gt;&gt; It's the opposite of faith. &gt;&gt; Fear is the opposite of faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. It believes, now get this. It believes more in Satan's power to harm than God's power to deliver. &gt;&gt; SO LET YOUR FAITH triumph over your fear. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID IN in 2 Timothy 1:7, "FOR GOD HATH NOT GIVEN US THE SPIRIT OF FEAR, &gt;&gt; but of power, OF LOVE, AND A SOUND MIND, &gt;&gt; WELL, BROTHER TIM, I'M OLD AND I I FEEL LIKE I'M LOSING MY MIND." WELL, YOU KNOW, DON'T FEAR. &gt;&gt; BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; Come on. IF YOU GET YOUR MIND BACK ON HIM, HE'LL KEEP YOU IN PERFECT PEACE. &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU GOT THIS. &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU'RE ABLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FEAR IS A LIAR. &gt;&gt; LET ME CALL IT WHAT IT IS. IT'S A POISONOUS SNAKE. IT'LL SLITHER RIGHT LIKE A SERPENT THROUGH THE QUARTERS OF YOUR MIND AND IT HISSES. It's poisonous doubts. &gt;&gt; It says, "You won't make it. &gt;&gt; You're not worthy. You failed too many times. you'll miss the rapture. The Lord will come and you'll be left behind. &gt;&gt; But the voice of faith rises UP AND ANSWERS BACK with a with A HOLY AUTHORITY. THE LORD IS MY LIGHT &gt;&gt; AND MY SALVATION. WHOM SHALL I FEAR? &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THAT PSALMS 27:1, THAT'S A RAPTURE SCRIPTURE. IT'S THE SCRIPTURE BROTHER BRADAM USED WHEN WHEN SPEAKING ON THE RAPTURE AND HOW FITTING IT IS. THE FIRST DECLARATION IS NOT ABOUT DARKNESS OR DREAD BUT ABOUT LIGHT AND SALVATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE LORD IS MY LIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE SHINES A PATH BEFORE US. HE HE OPENS THE WAY THROUGH DIMENSIONS. HE BREAKS THROUGH THE BARRIER AND THE VEIL BETWEEN TIME AND ETERNITY. HE'S THE GATEWAY TO HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE IS NOT OUR ESCAPE ROUTE. IT'S GOD'S ENTRANCE PATH. IS FOR CHRIST IS COMING FOR HIS OWN. &gt;&gt; AND THE RAPTURE IS ABOUT SALVATION, NOT ABOUT FEAR. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING LEFT BEHIND. IT'S BEING ABOUT TAKING UP. [cheering] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. I'M LEAVING HERE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT CHRIST FAILING TO DELIVER HIS BRIDE. IS ABOUT THE TRIUMPH OF HIS REDEEMING POWER. SO WHY SHOULD WE FEAR OF BEING LEFT BEHIND WHEN HE'S THE LEVER OF OUR SOUL? &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE'S COMING TO GET US AND TAKE US OUT OF HERE. &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE TREMBLE AT HIS APPEARING WHEN IT'S coming is the final act of redemption? &gt;&gt; Let me give you a scripture and I want you to nail it down in your heart. I want you to build a fortress with it. I want you to use it as a foundation. 1 Thessalonians 5:9. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, &gt;&gt; BUT TO OBTAIN SALVATION BY our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ETERNAL WORD THAT CAN'T FAIL. HE HAVE NOT APPOINTED YOU TO WRATH. &gt;&gt; HE HAVE NOT APPOINTED YOU TO THE TRIBULATION. &gt;&gt; HE HAS APPOINTED YOU TO OBTAIN [screaming] SALVATION. &gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR DESTINY. THIS IS YOUR CALLING. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; To receive this deliverance, &gt;&gt; let not your hearts be troubled. &gt;&gt; I will come again and receive you unto myself &gt;&gt; that where I am, there you may be also. &gt;&gt; Can't you see it? The rapture isn't about fear. It's about faith. &gt;&gt; Faith that our redeemer is faithful. &gt;&gt; Not faith that we've done everything right. That's right. &gt;&gt; FAITH THEN THAT OUR REDEEMER IS FAITHFUL. &gt;&gt; FAITH THAT HE THAT BEGAN A GOOD WORK WILL FINISH IT. &gt;&gt; FAITH THAT HE'S NOT COMING TO REJECT US BUT COMING TO FINISH TO REDEMPTION, NOT TO CONDEMN, BUT TO CLAIM WHAT HE'S PURCHASED WITH HIS OWN BLOOD. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID IN COLOSSIANS 3 AND 4, WHEN CHRIST WHO IS OUR LIFE SHALL APPEAR, THEN YE SHALL YE ALSO APPEAR WITH HIM IN GLORY. WHEN HE APPEARS, WE'RE GOING TO APPEAR WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; NOT I'M GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND. &gt;&gt; NO, HE SAID WHEN HE APPEARS THAT WE WILL APPEAR WITH HIM IN GLORY. &gt;&gt; Titus 2:13 said, "Look into that blessed hope than the glorious appearing of our the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ." Oh, but brother Tim, I I I I'm afraid some kind of impurity might keep me from the rapture. &gt;&gt; I want you to look at the next verse. Titus 2:14. Who gave himself for us &gt;&gt; that HE MIGHT REDEEM US from &gt;&gt; all iniquity &gt;&gt; AND PURIFY ON HIMSELF A PECULIAR PEOPLE, &gt;&gt; ZEALOUS OF GOOD WORKS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO HE GAVE HIMSELF WHAT? THAT HE MIGHT REDEEM US &gt;&gt; FROM ALL INIQUITY. &gt;&gt; SO THE RAPTURE IS NOT A THREAT. IT'S A PROMISE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A CURSE TO THE BRIDE. IS IT'S HER CORONATION DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S THE MOMENT WHEN WE SHALL BE CAUGHT UP TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR. &gt;&gt; WHERE FAITH THEN BECOMES SIGHT. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; What we believed and longed for all our life becomes real &gt;&gt; and we realize realization. &gt;&gt; So the Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I FEAR? &gt;&gt; SO WHY FEAR THE DAWN WHEN YOU'RE A CHILD OF THE LIGHT? WHY WHY FEAR THE TRUMPET WHEN IT'S CALLING YOU HOME? &gt;&gt; I'm not fearing the trumpet. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M WAITING FOR THAT TRUMP. I'M ANTIFIED. IT'S MY [screaming] CALL HOME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO LET EVERY SHADOWED DOUBT FADE AWAY IN THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS PROMISE AND AND LET EVERY TREMBLING HEART RISE WITH CONFIDENCE AND SAY, "THE LORD IS MY SALVATION. &gt;&gt; WHOM SHALL I FEAR? I WILL NOT BE AFRAID." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; For the same light that called you out of the darkness is the light that will lift you up out of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many's been reading in the newspaper lately or the news? We hardly nobody reads newspaper. But anyway, you know, but you're you're reading you're hearing about in the news about all of the the increase of thousands upon thousands of of of sightings of unidentified flying objects. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Mystic lights, mystic signs, mystic things. &gt;&gt; I understand even Tucker Car Carlson made a statement the other day. I thought I I was told it was at Charlie Kirk's funeral where he spoke and he said, "I believe them are angels that are coming into this dimension." &gt;&gt; Well, he's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "You see these little pockets going to the air and they call them saucers and so forth. Well, we better leave that alone." But you hear of all these people coming up missing and you say, "You don't hear from them. They're standing there and they're not there." And he said, "That's the way the rapture is going to be." Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. ONE OF THEM WILL DROP DOWN and this celestial terrestrial body will take on the celestial body and there'll be hair hide HAIR OR BONES LEFT. IT'LL BE TRANSFORMED IN A MOMENT OF TIME DROPPING RIGHT OUT OF SPACE AND TAKING home that. AND WE SEE ALL THIS GOING ON IN THE PENTAGON wondering about these lights and mystic lights and everything that they're seeing in the sky and had one here in the paper Jeffersonville this week and and so forth. A mystic light. Oh, they don't know what it is. But listen, little children, it's going to pick you up one of these days. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, I WONDER IF ALL OF THESE sightings &gt;&gt; aren't AREN'T THE REDEEMED SOULS OF THEOPHANES &gt;&gt; ABOUT TO BREAK INTO this dimension? &gt;&gt; I wonder. &gt;&gt; I WONDER. OH, BROTHER, WHERE ARE WE NOW? YOU YOU SAY, "OH, I DON'T THINK SO." WELL, LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIBLE. ELIJAH WAS TAKEN UP IN A WHIRLWIND IN A CHARIOT OF FIRE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; An unidentified flying object. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS TAKEN UP IN a whirlwind and a CHARITY OF FIRE. THINK OF THAT. A WHIRLWIND AND A FIRE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT INAUGURATED THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; A RUSHING MIGHTY WIND &gt;&gt; AND TONGUES OF FIRE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let me ask you, what do you see the prophet describe of an angel coming? A light hung in the room. &gt;&gt; And out of that light stepped a man 6' tall, 200 lb. &gt;&gt; And when he left, he walked back into that light &gt;&gt; and went out. Amen. &gt;&gt; And one day that light that you got in your heart &gt;&gt; that baptized you with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; the fullness of it will come and spread over your body. And you'll step into that light &gt;&gt; and be transformed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, be changed. And when that great morning comes, the one who's shown the path BEFORE YOU WILL OPEN THE HEAVEN ABOVE YOU AND SAY, "COME up higher. Your redemption is complete." &gt;&gt; SO I WANT YOU TO SAY, LET THE VOICE OF FAITH RISE UP AND ANSWER BACK WITH A HOLY AUTHORITY. IF GOD BE FOR [screaming] US, &gt;&gt; THEN WHO CAN BE AGAINST US? &gt;&gt; So are you afraid of missing it? Then what weapon then what demon power what what demon power is able to hold you down when he said no weapon formed against you shall prosper. &gt;&gt; What can hold you down when you've already turned heavenly? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "WHO IS THIS MELZDC?" WHEN WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE THE WORD OF GOD AS EAGLE FOOD, IT TURNS YOU HEAVENLY. AMEN. SO YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MISS IT. YOU'VE BEEN TURNED HEAVENLY. YOU'RE ALREADY AIMED IN THAT DIRECTION. &gt;&gt; CHILD OF GOD, FEAR DOESN'T COME FROM YOUR FATHER. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HIS SPIRIT WHISPERING THOSE DOUBTS. IT'S THE VOICE OF THE ENEMY TRYING TO DETHRONE YOUR CONFIDENCE IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; You see, the spirit of God don't paralyze you with dread. He empowers you with faith and love &gt;&gt; and a disciplined mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The word there speaks of a sound mind. It means a disciplined mind. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's where you take those wrong thoughts. Any thought &gt;&gt; contrary to God's word, &gt;&gt; you take control of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You take authority over it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And because your mind is disciplined only to receive what God's word said, &gt;&gt; WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID. BUT MY MIND IS DISCIPLINED. &gt;&gt; TO BELIEVE ONE THING. &gt;&gt; GOD'S GOT CONTROL OF MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; SATAN CAN'T TAME ME TILL GOD'S THROUGH WITH ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NO MATTER WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE LAST ANSWER. &gt;&gt; COME ON. HE'S NOT HE'S NOT THE FINAL ANSWER. HE'S NOT THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY. THERE'S A GREATER AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A DISCIPLINED MIND TO BELIEVE WHAT GOD'S WORD SAID &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEN PERFECT LOVE CASTS OUT ALL FEAR &gt;&gt; AND THE JUST THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL LIVE by faith. &gt;&gt; So faith is a life. I fear not today what the tomorrow may bring. &gt;&gt; If shadow or sunshine or rain, &gt;&gt; the Lord I know ruleth or everything &gt;&gt; and all of my weary is vain. &gt;&gt; What am I singing? Living by faith. Yes. &gt;&gt; You see, the just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; Faith speaks a different language. &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS FEAR IN THE EYE AND AND IT DECLARES, "GREATER IS HE &gt;&gt; THAT IS IN ME &gt;&gt; THAN HE THAT'S IN THE WORLD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN JESUS SAID, "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE," HE WASN'T POINTING TO A DISTANT EVENT. HE WAS REVEALING A PRESENT REALITY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. RESURRECTION LIFE WAS RIGHT THERE CLOTHED IN FLESH. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT &gt;&gt; RESURRECTION LIFE WAS STANDING THERE AND THAT SAME LIFE, THAT SAME LIFE, THE VERY SPIRIT THAT RAISED UP CHRIST FROM THE DEAD NOW DWELLS IN YOU. &gt;&gt; SO IF THE SPIRIT THAT RAISED UP JESUS FROM THE DEAD DWELLS IN YOU, HE THAT RAISED UP CHRIST FROM THE DEAD SHALL ALSO quicken &gt;&gt; your mortal body. &gt;&gt; So we don't fear being left behind. We're part of the body he's coming for. &gt;&gt; We're the reason he's coming. &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY GHOST THAT SITS ON THE THRONE of your heart is the very one that will lift you up in that glorious moment. The rapture cannot happen without the bride. And the BRIDE CANNOT LEAVE WITHOUT THE SPIRIT. And when THE SPIRIT LEAVES THE EARTH, HE'S TAKING YOU WITH HIM. SO YOU'RE NOT A CANDIDATE FOR FEAR. YOU'RE A VESSEL OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR RESURRECTION LIFE. YOU CARRIED IT WITHIN YOU. &gt;&gt; SO LET LET ME JUST TELL YOU, LET YOUR FAITH ROAR LOUDER THAN YOUR FEAR. &gt;&gt; LET THE WORD DROWN OUT THAT DOUBT. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE ENEMY HISSES, YOU WON'T MAKE IT. YOU STAND CAUGHT. AND YOU SAY, "I'M SEALED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT OF PROMISE." AND DEVIL, YOU'RE SEALED OUT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR IT'S CHRIST IN ME THAT'S THE HOPE OF GLORY. &gt;&gt; FOR THE LORD HIMSELF SHALL DESCEND FROM HEAVEN WITH A SHOUT, WITH A BAND. WE SHALL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR. &gt;&gt; So fear says you're not enough. But faith says he's more than enough &gt;&gt; and he lives in me. So don't allow the devil to build strongholds in your mind, &gt;&gt; but go to war. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6, he tells you, I I'VE DRESSED YOU FOR WAR, &gt;&gt; A HELMET OF SALVATION, &gt;&gt; A SHIELD OF FAITH, A SWORD OF THE SPIRIT, A BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. I'VE DRESSED YOU FOR WAR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I I didn't dress you to uh you KNOW TO TO HANG ALL OF THAT UP THERE AND SAY LISTEN I'M A SOLDIER AND HERE IT IS ON MY WALL. YOU ARE TO DRESS IN IT &gt;&gt; AND EVERY DAY YOU GO TO [screaming] BATTLE. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Amen. But let me just tell you strongholds don't mean you're not a child of God. &gt;&gt; Satan can tempt But he cannot touch your redeemed soul. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to shout. &gt;&gt; You're sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise. Let me tell you clearly, the devil is sealed out and can never, never, never get in. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. EPHESIANS 1:13. IN WHOM YOU ALSO TRUSTED AFTER YOU HEARD THE WORD OF TRUTH. HAVE YOU HEARD THE WORD OF TRUTH? HAVE YOU HEARD THE MESSAGE? HAVE YOU TRUSTED IN IT? IT'S THE GOSPEL OF YOUR SALVATION. AND WHOM AFTER YOU BELIEVE, YOU WERE sealed &gt;&gt; with that Holy Spirit of promise. &gt;&gt; And that promise is I'm not leaving you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when you're in your darkest trial, &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving you. &gt;&gt; You're not fighting alone. So when those dark thoughts come, don't mistake them as proof of defeat. &gt;&gt; Those thoughts don't mean you're not saved. &gt;&gt; But they can rob you of your joy and your peace if you let them take root. &gt;&gt; They'll keep you they can't keep you out of heaven, but they'll keep you living under clouds of unbelief, defeated, discouraged. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, I I I know you can't hardly believe it. You know, surely nobody goes through what I go through and nobody thinks what I think and nobody has the problems I have. And you know, it's like, oh, dear sister Kenny, one time she was a an old saint. I buried buried her in her 90s. She was in the early part of our church, but she want come one time to me and she, oh, brother Tim, you don't know what it is to go through a trial. You've never had a trial in your life, &gt;&gt; these ain't trials. I don't want to know what one is, &gt;&gt; you know. But but WE LOOK AT HOLY MEN and we think, "Oh, they they can never have a bad thought. They can never have something go through their mind that's impure or unworthy or unholy or filthy. &gt;&gt; You know, listen, I heard the testimony of brother Roy Borders and I TRYING TO GO BACK IN MY MIND. I don't know if this was told to me or whether he told me because I spent time with him. I back in the early 70s. I preached before I got married down there in his church a number of times while he was going through heart surgery down in Ber, Texas. I was like 18 years old, 19 maybe. Brother Borders was the campaign manager for brother Brandham and he's directing the prayer line. Now that's a pretty holy place, isn't it? Prayer line. People are being prayed, deliverance going on, people coming for prayer. power of God is moving &gt;&gt; and he's directing the prayer line and during the prayer line he started having these most evil and vile and filthy thoughts and it condemned his heart so bad he just he just was so wounded inside you know he's ashamed and he was embarrassed because HE KNEW STANDING BEFORE THAT prophet everything was exposed &gt;&gt; and he and after the prayer line was over and he got with brother Brandham. He apologized, "Brother Brham, I I I'm so embarrassed. I'm I'm so ashamed. I had the most filthiest thoughts. I know you knew them. I know you got THEM. I KNOW I KNOW YOU DISCERNED THEM. I I I you know, I had all these thoughts and and I'm so ashamed. I'M SO EMBARRASSED." WHILE THE PRAYER LINE WAS GOING ON. And Brother Brand looked at him and he kind of surprised. He said, "Roy, those were aimed at me, &gt;&gt; and you just got in the way." &gt;&gt; The devil doing everything HE COULD TO CLOUD THAT PROPHET'S MIND &gt;&gt; TO KEEP HIM FROM PRAYING THE PRAYER OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; SOUND FAMILIAR? AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT LET ME GO BEYOND THE THE HOLIEST OF ALL. &gt;&gt; THE ONE WHO WAS WITHOUT FAULT. &gt;&gt; AND LET ME tell you, even Jesus was tempted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He faced those same intrusive thoughts, &gt;&gt; but he conquered them with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said Jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness be tempted of the devil. You know why? Cuz God ain't afraid of his salvation. &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered him every time. Matthew in Matthew 4 L and Matthew 4:4, Luke 4:4, it is written [clears throat] &gt;&gt; every time he DID WHAT? HE CAST DOWN those strongholds &gt;&gt; with WHAT THE WORD SAID. I'M TRYING TO TEACH YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; NOW, SO YOU SEE, TEMPTATION ITSELF IS NOT SIN. EVEN OUR LORD WAS TEMPTED YET WAS WITHOUT SIN. &gt;&gt; NOW, and how can I overcome? Let me just quote brother Bradom. Temptation was for him. You know that the Bible said he was tempted in all points like we are, yet without sin. Get ready. Put seat belts on. &gt;&gt; He was tempted by drinking. &gt;&gt; He was tempted by women. &gt;&gt; He was tempted by everything that could be tempted by. He was tempted by everything we are. &gt;&gt; He was a man. And yet he you couldn't put a mark on him. &gt;&gt; You see, HE FACED EVERY FIERY DART, THE LUST OF THE FLESH, THE PRIDE OF LIFE, AND EVERY LIE THAT SATAN could hurl. And he overcame by standing firm on the word of God. Listen to me. You got to recognize your enemy. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THE POWER WITHIN YOU. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. Now &gt;&gt; let let me tell you, you've got to recognize your enemy. WHEN JESUS WHEN JESUS FACED THE DEVIL, HE SAW A DEVIL. HE SAW SATAN. HE SAW LUCIFER. HE SAW a form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But most time you face him, you don't see anybody. And that's why you think it's you. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham had an experience and you can look this up. Just look up Alioop. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about how that one day that he was laying in bed and he said there was a he began to hear a voice in the room and he said it sounded a weird voice. It sound like a hen cackling going to the barn. So, so it said, "You're not really a prophet. These miracles you talk about isn't real. Those things never really happen. They're just all made up." Can you imagine the audacity of a devil standing there and telling a prophet of God who had defeated him time after time after time after time after time in the prayer line &gt;&gt; discerned him and cast him out &gt;&gt; that it wasn't real. &gt;&gt; You see, but in as a prophet, he could see his enemy. He said he looked like a distorted figure because see Satan fell &gt;&gt; and and he he is he is a a he was a like a distorted figure like Alioop. I don't know if you ever saw him but like a caveman all de deformed and and bloated out and whatever else out of the funny papers. He said look like that. And he said, "I I thought ah I'm going to wake up me and let her see it." He said, "No, that scare her to death." And he said, "I, you know, I WAS LISTENING TO THAT AND AFTER A WHILE, I GOT TIRED OF IT." &gt;&gt; And I said, "SATAN, YOU'RE AN OFFENSE TO ME. &gt;&gt; GET OUT OF HERE. &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST IS AGAINST YOU." &gt;&gt; OH, ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG YOU WANT THE BATTLE TO ROAR IN YOUR MIND. BUT YOU CAN STOP IT RIGHT NOW IN HIS TRACKS. [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO RECOGNIZE your enemy. YOU MAY YOU MAY NOT SEE HIM AN ALLEY. YOU MAY NOT SEE HIM AS LUCIFER. YOU MAY NOT SEE HIM AS A SPEAR. YOU MAY NOT SEE HIM AS A DARK SHADOW. BUT HE'S there &gt;&gt; warning in your mind. So don't let anybody tell you there's no devil. That's just a thought. No, there's a real devil. He's real as you are. &gt;&gt; But there's a different reality though. You're eternal and he's not. &gt;&gt; And here's a real victory. The God that lives inside of you is greater than he that is is greater than the one that's against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can do what James 4:7 said and submit yourself therefore TO GOD AND RESIST THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he will flee from you. SO THE YOU SEE THAT'S THE REAL OVERCOMING IT IS TO RECOGNIZE BOTH THE REALITY OF the enemy and the authority OF THE CHRIST THAT lives in you. AND FOR YOU ARE NOT FIGHTING FOR VICTORY. YOU ARE FIGHTING FROM VICTORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE CONQUEROR ALREADY LIVES INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; MAN IN ALL THESE THINGS WE'RE MORE THAN conquerors &gt;&gt; through him that loved us. Now &gt;&gt; listen, faith does not deny reality. &gt;&gt; It declares dominion. &gt;&gt; Overcoming doesn't mean denying the problem. &gt;&gt; You You can't say, "I don't believe I'm sick." &gt;&gt; If sickness has attacked your body, no, you're sick. &gt;&gt; You know, you say, "Well, I don't have cancer." Well, yeah, you do. If the doctor said and they did all the Yeah, you got it. Jesus never told us to deny the existence of the mountain. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "SPEAK TO IT." &gt;&gt; He didn't SAY, "PRETEND IT AIN'T THERE." &gt;&gt; NO, THE MOUNTAIN'S THERE. IT'S BIG. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SPEAK TO IT. &gt;&gt; YOUR mountain has to hear your voice. &gt;&gt; You see, you got to realize and remember there's a greater power in you than this power that's attacked you. The Holy Spirit already dwells in you and has already overcome every disease, you know, EVERY DEMON, EVERY DOUBT. AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID YOU WOULD DO. THESE SIGNS shall follow them that believe. Are you a believer? &gt;&gt; Amen. THEN IN MY NAME, THEY SHALL CAST OUT DEVILS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, YOU MAY NEVER DO WHAT I'VE DONE HERE AT THE ALTAR OR OR OUT AND ABOUT OR WHEREVER BECAUSE I've seen it done where people in the audience fell out under under power of demon spirits and they they were cast out as I preached the word. &gt;&gt; I've seen it as I laid hands on them as I even just whispered to them. &gt;&gt; You may never do that, &gt;&gt; but you have the authority to cast out Satan. And you start by casting him out of your mind. &gt;&gt; Salvation cast him out of your soul. He ain't there. &gt;&gt; But he comes in the mind. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's the battlefield. &gt;&gt; And just because you won the war yesterday don't mean he don't come back today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, but I I'm just trying to trying to tell you something. I I'm I'm trying to let you know you are not to let FEAR OR GUILT TAKE YOU PRISONER. &gt;&gt; THE WORD DECLARES THERE IS NO THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION. ROMANS 8:1 IS MY FAVORITE PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE. ROMANS CHAPTER 8, THERE IS THEREFORE NOW [screaming] NO CONDEMNATION TO THEM WHICH ARE in Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the battle begins in the mind but victory begins in the spirit. &gt;&gt; You you don't overcome remember our mountain moving scripture from Zechariah. You don't overcome by might or by power but by his spirit living in you. &gt;&gt; So child of God, I'm telling you this morning, fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't surrender your mind to fear or doubt or depression. YOU'RE SEALED OR YOU'RE REDEEMED. AND NOT ONLY THAT, YOU'RE ARMED. &gt;&gt; EQUIPPED. &gt;&gt; THE WEAPONS ARE MIGHTY. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE FOR CASTING DOWN STRONGHOLDS. &gt;&gt; AS I KEEP SAYING, NOT THE DECORATIONS. &gt;&gt; SO, pull down those strongholds, demolish those imaginations. You stand there, stand your ground in the authority of the blood, and remind the devil, he's the one locked out. Not you. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; He's been locked out of heaven, &gt;&gt; but heaven is open for you. &gt;&gt; But he's locked out. He cannot come into you. HE IS LOCKED OUT CUZ YOU'RE REDEEMED. COME ON. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW, UNBELIEF IS ALWAYS THE THE ENEMY'S STRONGHOLD. UNBELIEF questions God's goodness. He questions his timing and and his promises. He comes and whispers that same lie. &gt;&gt; That same lie the serpent spoke in in Eden. Yes, God said. And in that moment, Satan convinced Eve that God was holding something good &gt;&gt; back from her. &gt;&gt; God's holding something good back from you. I want you to see Psalms 84:11. I want you to get this. Psalms 84:11. Let them put it up. For the Lord God is a son and a shield, AND THE LORD WILL GIVE GRACE AND GLORY. &gt;&gt; NO GOOD THING &gt;&gt; WILL HE WITHHOLD FROM THEM THAT WALK UP RIGHTLY. &gt;&gt; NO GOOD THING WILL HE WITHHOLD. That's right. &gt;&gt; OH. UH OH. Uh oh. Some of you just got a dart. You just &gt;&gt; beer come right in and you just thought came in your mind. I knew there was a catch. No good thing from them that walk up rightly. &gt;&gt; And I'm sure I have a flaws somewhere. [laughter] I I'm less than perfect. &gt;&gt; So God ain't going to give it to me. He going to give it to me &gt;&gt; cuz he'll he won't withhold from those who walk uprightly. And I I I know I got flaws. &gt;&gt; I know I made mistakes. I know I have failures. I I I know I blunder sometimes. Sometimes I have doubt in my heart. Sometimes I &gt;&gt; Well, well, let me tell you. Let's Let's put up a few scriptures because we're going to use them to woof the devil with. CUZ WE DEFEAT THE DEVIL BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; EPHESIANS 1:4, ACCORDING AS HE HAD CHOSEN US &gt;&gt; IN HIM &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD THAT WE SHOULD BE HOLY AND WITHOUT BLAME BEFORE HIM IN LOVE. [applause] NOW TAKE THAT, DEVIL. AMEN. THERE'S AN ATOMIC BOMB TO BLOW DOWN YOUR STRONGHOLD. &gt;&gt; I'LL TURN THAT DIRT AROUND, THROW IT BACK AT YOU WITH A FLAME OF FIRE ON IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He chose me to be holy. He didn't choose me because I was holy. He chose me to be holy. He didn't choose me because I was blameless. He chose me to be blameless. So if I lack, he's going to make up for it. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, &gt;&gt; how could we go through this evil world and be blameless? Well, let me give you another scripture. You know, Philippians 2:15, we're going to we're going to cast down every argument. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. that we Philippians 2:15 that we may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, &gt;&gt; in the midst &gt;&gt; OF A CROOKED AND PERVERSE &gt;&gt; NATION, &gt;&gt; AMONG WHOM YOU SHINE AS LIGHTS IN THE WORLD, &gt;&gt; HOLDING FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR THAT? YES. &gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR THAT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT YOU MAY BE BLAMELESS &gt;&gt; AND HARMLESS. &gt;&gt; CAN'T HAPPEN IN THIS EVIL AGE, SONS OF GOD, WITHOUT REBUKE IN THE MIDST OF A CROOKED AND PERVERSE GENERATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Holding forth the word of life. Yes. &gt;&gt; So why did he send a message, a raptured message in the last day to prepare people for his name's sake? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To call out a bride. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, she was not spotless. &gt;&gt; She was not blameless. But he took her blame &gt;&gt; and he made her spotless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And do you think you really think this word is going to return to him void or empty? &gt;&gt; The the God that made the heavens, the earth with the power of his word, THAT THAT GOD WILL FAIL. THAT AFTER 6,000 YEARS OF REDEMPTION WORK AFTER TAKING ON FLESH AND GOING TO CALVARY AND THAT I SHED IN HIS BLOOD THAT HE'S GONNA FAIL IN GETTING you ready. &gt;&gt; No, he ain't GONNA DO THAT. THE BIBLE SAID IN PSALMS 107:20, HE SENT HIS WORD. HOW MANY BELIEVE HE SENT A MESSAGE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SENT HIS WORD AND &gt;&gt; HEALED THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND DELIVERED THEM &gt;&gt; FROM THEIR DESTRUCTIONS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE WORD WAS SENT FOR. NOT TO CONDEMN YOU, &gt;&gt; BUT TO CONDEMN THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HEAL YOU. YES. &gt;&gt; AND DELIVER YOU &gt;&gt; FROM YOUR destruction &gt;&gt; because of his great love that he has for you. Ephesians 5:26. That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the continual washing of the water by the word. That's what I'm doing with the word this morning. I'm giving you a good scrubbing in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself. &gt;&gt; A FAILED CHURCH, NO, A GLORIOUS CHURCH, &gt;&gt; NOT HAVING SPOT OR WRINKLE OR ANY SUCH THING, YOU NAME IT, THAT WE SHOULD BE HOLY &gt;&gt; AND without blemish. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; But you know, back to Eve again. Satan convinced Eve that God was holding back something good from her. And yet God had already fortified them with the word. He gave him a clear warning. His word built a fortress around them. And the day you eat thereof, that day you shall surely die. He It was there. It gave perimeters. But Satan But Eve allowed Satan to exalt his thoughts against the word of God. And that's where unbelief begins when reasoning becomes elevated over revelation. &gt;&gt; You see, she accepted his imagination over God's inspiration. AND IN DOING SO, SHE BECAME CAPTIVE TO his deception. &gt;&gt; AND THE SERPENT BUILT THE FIRST STRONGHOLD, A FORTRESS OF DOUBT. And then you what happened? Humanity became enslaved to sin. AND SIN KILLED US. &gt;&gt; I mean that &gt;&gt; it's death is separation. &gt;&gt; SO IT SEPARATED FROM GOD AND ALL MANKIND WAS DEAD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And that's what happened. &gt;&gt; He come and built a fortress in Eve's mind there poisoned her soul. Set death in her soul, death in the flesh. And then we're all born that way. &gt;&gt; But that ain't the end of the story. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It might have be sin's beginning, &gt;&gt; but it ain't redemption's ending. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians 2:1, "AND YOU HATH YE MADE ALIVE." AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHO WERE DEAD IN TRESPASSES AND SINS, WHEREIN TIME PASSED, YOU WALKED ACCORDING TO THE PRINCE OF THE POWER of the of the of THE AIR, THE SPIRIT THAT NOW WORKKETH IN THE CHILDREN of disobedience, among whom we all had our MANNER OF LIVING, OUR CONVERSATION IN TIMES PAST, IN THE LUST OF OUR FLESH, FULFILLING THE DESIRES OF THE FLESH AND OF THE MIND. And we're by nature &gt;&gt; the children OF WRATH &gt;&gt; DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION &gt;&gt; AS OTHERS. It's &gt;&gt; a bleak picture, ain't it? &gt;&gt; But God, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. BUT GOD, [applause] BUT GOD WHO IS RICH IN MERCY, FOR HIS GREAT LOVE WHEREWITH HE LOVED US, EVEN WHEN WE WERE DEAD &gt;&gt; IN SINS AND TRESPASSES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He hath quickened us together &gt;&gt; with Christ. For by grace, &gt;&gt; by grace, &gt;&gt; BY THE FAVOR OF GOD, &gt;&gt; NOT IN anything you did, &gt;&gt; not because YOU WERE WORTHY, &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE YOU WORKED HARD, &gt;&gt; BUT BY GRACE, BY THE FAVOR OF GOD, &gt;&gt; BY HIS LOVE THAT HE HAD FOR YOU. YOU ARE SAVED. &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS RAISED US UP TOGETHER AND made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus to reign with him that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith, not of yourself. It's the gift of God, &gt;&gt; not of works, lest any man should boast. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't brag. You can't brag. I was good. I was better than you. That's why I am what I am. &gt;&gt; No, it's by grace. &gt;&gt; Grace. &gt;&gt; God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Grace. Say, "Oh, amazing." &gt;&gt; Did he look beyond your fault &gt;&gt; and he saw your need? &gt;&gt; Amen. IN COLOSSIANS 1:21, "AND YOU THAT WERE SOMETIMES ALIENATED AND enemous &gt;&gt; in YOUR MIND &gt;&gt; BY WICKED WORKS, YET NOW HAS HE reconciled &gt;&gt; in the body of his flesh through death to present you to present you to present you holy, unblameable, unreprovable in his sight." So now because of the finished work of Calvary, Satan can no longer possess you. He can no longer enter the redeemed soul. &gt;&gt; You have been sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise. &gt;&gt; Is somebody hearing me this morning? I'm trying to get it to you. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot take you captive. &gt;&gt; But he can try to hold you hostage through thoughts of fear and doubt. HIS STRATEGY IS NOW IS mental warfare &gt;&gt; because he wants to keep YOU LIVING UNDER DARK CLOUDS OF UNBELIEF &gt;&gt; AND AFRAID TO USE THE VERY WEAPONS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN YOU. BUT REMEMBER, YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then you know truth and you're already free. &gt;&gt; I'm looking out here at men and women today. You're already free. Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO WHY ALLOW THE DEVIL CONTROL WHAT CHRIST IS LIBERATING? &gt;&gt; UNBELIEF IS NOT MERELY DOUBT. IT'S REBELLION AGAINST TRUTH. &gt;&gt; IT SHUTS THE DOOR THAT FAITH WAS MEANT TO OPEN. YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAID HE CANNOT DO MIGHTY WORKS BECAUSE OF THEIR UNBELIEF. UNBELIEF BUILDS WALLS &gt;&gt; WHERE GOD INTENDS TO MAKE A WAY. IT LOCKS THE DOORS OF HEALING, OF PEACE, AND PROVISION. Even when the key of faith is in your hand, he tries to lock it from you. And if you fall or stumble, if you let doubt enter, I'm trying to tell you, don't stay condemned. The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you &gt;&gt; from all sin. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; First John 1:9, if we confess our sins, he is faithful. He is faithful &gt;&gt; and just righteous &gt;&gt; to forgive us our SINS &gt;&gt; AND TO CLEANSE US &gt;&gt; from all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; FOR THEREFORE THERE IS NOW NO condemnation &gt;&gt; to them who are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; SO I'M TELLING YOU TO STAND TALL, CHILD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE REDEEMED. YOU ARE BLESSED. YOU'RE CLEANSED. YOU'RE MADE PURE. THEY QUIT QUESTIONING GOD'S PROMISES OR HIS TIMING. HE HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU. &gt;&gt; HIS DELAYS ARE NOT DENIALS. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE DIVINE PREPARATIONS. &gt;&gt; GOD'S GETTING YOU READY FOR A BIGGER MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; For a buck says the vision is for an appointed time. &gt;&gt; Though it tar, wait for it, for it will surely come, it will not carry. &gt;&gt; Faith says God will do it. Unbelief says maybe he won't. Faith builds altars. Unbelief builds walls to make strongholds. Faith opens the heaven. Unbelief clouds the mind. &gt;&gt; So I'm telling you this morning, tear down, tear down every thought that rises against the word. &gt;&gt; CAST DOWN THOSE IMAGINATIONS, THOSE HIGH THINGS THAT EXALTS ITSELF AGAINST the knowledge OF GOD. LIFT UP THE SHIELD OF FAITH AND MARCH FORWARD AND TAKE POSSESSION OF YOUR THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT A PRISONER OF YOUR PAST. &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE NOT TO BE A PRISONER OF YOUR THOUGHTS. YOU ARE A WARRIOR OF FAITH. YOU'RE STANDING ON AN UNSHAKABLE PROMISE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But you see, condemnation keeps believers chained to their past. &gt;&gt; That's right. It says, "Ah, yeah, you're forgiven, but you'll never be free." And the word declares, "Whom the Son has made free." &gt;&gt; Is free indeed. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE FREE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NO LONGER IN BONDAGE. SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE IS NO CONDEMNATION &gt;&gt; TO THOSE IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; GUILT LOOKS BACK AT A FAILURE, BUT GRACE LOOKS TO CALVARY. IT REM, YOU KNOW, FEAR AND AND GUILT WILL REMIND YOU OF YOUR PAST. You cannot be truly pardoned. Though, until you receive that pardon, &gt;&gt; you quit accepting punishment for what Jesus has paid for. &gt;&gt; Quit taking weapons. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR WHAT JESUS PAID IN FULL FOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BELIEVE HIM. IF HE SAID YOU'RE FREE, BELIEVE HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I know. It's like old Johnny Crow. You know, he was there tied there for years. He's tied by string. &gt;&gt; And he could only go so far. Every time the other crow said, "We're going to fly south. You know, come go with us." I can't. I'm tied to the string. He jumped. He tried. The string would pull him down. One day a good man come by and cut the string. But Johnny Crow was so used to the string &gt;&gt; and that he could only go so far &gt;&gt; until he was too afraid &gt;&gt; to go past &gt;&gt; the boundaries &gt;&gt; that had been put on him. I'm trying to tell you this morning, you're not Johnny Crow. &gt;&gt; You're a son or daughter of the living God &gt;&gt; and every string has been cut. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN RISE UP AND FLY, LITTLE EAGLE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO BE CAVES. RISE UP IN THE SKIES WHERE YOU BELONG, WHERE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ Jesus. But there's all kinds of things that are strongholds. Strongholds of lust, &gt;&gt; carnal desires. What is lust? Lust is its desire for that which is forbidden. &gt;&gt; Lust exalts pleasure above purity. &gt;&gt; It feeds the flesh until the flesh rules the spirit. The Bible said in 1 John 2 and 6 2:16, for all this in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life is not of the father. &gt;&gt; Oh, then can a child of God lust? Lust is evil. Brother Tim, let me ask you this. Are you still in the flesh? &gt;&gt; Your flesh has the propensity to do all kinds of evil. It did it. &gt;&gt; You know what it can do? &gt;&gt; The life you lived in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. It has the propensity to do evil. &gt;&gt; It can still do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. You You say, "Brother Tim, your flesh, yeah, my flesh has the propensity to do that. &gt;&gt; But I have been redeemed in the soul, &gt;&gt; and now there's a new king that sits on the throne. And no matter WHAT MY FLESH WANTS TO DO, &gt;&gt; there is A KING THAT SAYS down boy. &gt;&gt; Down, boy. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR THE BIBLE SAID IN GALATIANS 5:17, FOR THE FLESH LUST AGAINST THE SPIRIT, AND THE SPIRIT AGAINST THE FLESH. &gt;&gt; So there's a war going on. YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAID IN JAMES 1:14, "EVERY MAN IS TEMPTED WHEN HE IS DRAWN AWAY OF HIS OWN LUST AND ENTICED, AND THEN WHEN LUST IS CONCEIVED, it bringeth forth sin. And sin when it is finished bringeth forth death, &gt;&gt; but the Holy Ghost gives us the power &gt;&gt; to crucify those affections and lust." The Bible said IN GALATIANS 5:16, "WALK IN THE SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; AND YOU WILL NOT FULFILL THE LUST OF THE FLESH." &gt;&gt; AMEN. We're we're IN THE FLESH, BUT WE DON'T WALK AFTER THE FLESH, BUT WE WALK AFTER THE SPIRIT. NOW, SO YOU SEE AGAIN, WE WE HAVE THE FLESH TO CONTEND WITH. AS LONG AS WE'RE IN THIS BODY, &gt;&gt; it has lust, it has desires, it wants, and what. But you take control. &gt;&gt; You have a power within you. A king sits on the throne. &gt;&gt; It's like Adam in Eden. The lion had a lion nature. The lamb had a lamb nature. When the lion rose up, Adam was a ruler. &gt;&gt; Down boy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Peace reigned. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was a ruler. That's right. &gt;&gt; A godly ruler. When Satan came in and he was the ruler, animals ate each other. &gt;&gt; The kingdom destroyed each other. Men hate each other. &gt;&gt; When there's the king sitting on the throne, Amen. He brings an Eden all around. &gt;&gt; This flesh that has the nature, has the ability &gt;&gt; to do wrong. &gt;&gt; You can read TO READ GALATIANS 5. YOU SEE WHAT THE WORKS OF THE FLESH ARE. THAT'S WHAT THE FLESH IS IS CAPABLE OF DOING. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING IT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A KING SITTING ON THE THRONE AND IT GIVES YOU THE POWER TO RULE. &gt;&gt; So that's a stronghold. There's other strongholds and I couldn't begin to name all of what every one of you are have to deal with, but let me just deal with a few cuz I know there's some of you deal with the stronghold of rejection and unworthiness. That stronghold, it whispers, "God can bless others, but not you, cuz you're not good enough. &gt;&gt; You just don't measure up." And let me just tell you, some of these strongholds have been there a long time. Because rejection often begins as a seed planted in your childhood. &gt;&gt; It can happen when a father ab abandons his family. Mothers and dads separate. [snorts] It happens in moments of betrayal, disappointment, neglect. Some things are not even intended harm. It's just life. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But it tells you you're not wanted. YOU'RE NOT WORTHY. YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. But that seed is a lie. &gt;&gt; IT IS PLANTED BY THE SAME SERPENT WHO WHISPERED to Eve, who caused HER TO DOUBT. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SPIRIT OF REJECTION THAT CAUSES YOU TO QUESTION YOUR VALUE TO GOD. IT MAKES YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS. WELL, they're blessed and I'm not. They got this and I didn't. Don't seem like God loves me like he loves everybody else. They shouted in church and got a blessing from God and I didn't feel nothing. And it makes you compare yourself to others. Makes you feel like you'll never measure up. My family was too poor. My home was too troublesome. My past is too bad. My situation's too hard. But the scripture declares this about you. Psalms 139:14, "I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made." Amen. &gt;&gt; God made you &gt;&gt; unique &gt;&gt; and with a purpose. &gt;&gt; And I don't care, woman at the well, how many husbands you have &gt;&gt; and how you're living in sin now. There's a seventh one coming by &gt;&gt; that's not going to take advantage OF YOU, BUT WILL REDEEM YOU, &gt;&gt; THAT WILL CALL YOU OUT, THAT HAS A DIVINE APPOINTMENT FOR YOUR LIFE THAT will change you. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, you're not a mistake &gt;&gt; and you're not forgotten. &gt;&gt; You're handcrafted by God. &gt;&gt; You're designed for a purpose. You're redeemed by his own blood. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil's goal isn't just to make you feel sad. IT'S MAKE YOU DOUBT WHO YOU ARE IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT'S BAD ENOUGH JUST TO MAKE YOU FEEL SAD, BUT HE WANTS TO MAKE YOU DOUBT WHO YOU ARE IN CHRIST. HE KNOWS IF IF YOU QUESTION YOUR IDENTITY IDENTITY, YOU WILL QUESTION YOUR AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, that's the WAY HE CAME WITH JESUS. &gt;&gt; HEY, RIGHT AFTER he got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; did Jesus get the Holy Ghost? Yeah. At the River Jordan, [snorts] &gt;&gt; and he gets the Holy Ghost. And the first thing that happens is he led in temptation &gt;&gt; where the devil says it didn't really happen. Well, there was a dove, there was a light, there was a voice, and there was a prophet. &gt;&gt; But it didn't happen. &gt;&gt; You didn't [snorts] really get it. If you are the son of God, Satan tried to plant doubt into his mind about his sunship, &gt;&gt; but Jesus didn't argue with him. &gt;&gt; I I WANT TO GET IT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ARGUING WITH THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT IS ABOUT ANSWERING BY THE WORD. IT IS WRITTEN. &gt;&gt; I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU AT THAT MOMENT JESUS DIDN'T FEEL LIKE HE FELT &gt;&gt; WHEN THE HE WAS THERE IN CHURCH IN SERVICE ON THE RIVER BANKS &gt;&gt; AND THE THE POWER OF GOD CAME DOWN. HE WASN'T FEELING IT. HE WAS FEELING A DEVIL, &gt;&gt; a demon spirit. The same one that deceived Eve in the garden &gt;&gt; now comes to get him &gt;&gt; to make him doubt. &gt;&gt; And the first thing he wanted to do was get you to doubt your sunship. &gt;&gt; So you're to tear down that lie what it is written. That's right. &gt;&gt; Prove it. Prove it. IF YOU ARE, PROVE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO PROVE TO THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. AMEN. YOU YOU JUST SAY, "MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE, BUT BY EVERY WORD." I'M GOING, HOW I'M GOING TO LIVE IS BY THE WORD. THIS IS THE WAY I'M GOING TO DEFEAT THE DEVIL IS BY THE WORD. HERE'S HOW I live &gt;&gt; is by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what first John 3 and1 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god. God called me his son. That's all I need to know. &gt;&gt; When you know you're loved, when you know you're chosen, when you know you're called, that's when rejection loses its grip. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's one of Satan's crulest lies that is designed to make a believer feel unloved or overlooked or forgotten. AND JESUS SHATTERED THAT LIE when he said, "YOU HAVE NOT CHOSEN ME. I CHOSE YOU." &gt;&gt; AND I ORDAINED YOU TO BRING FORTH FRUIT, TO BRING FORTH LIFE. &gt;&gt; YOU You didn't choose him. HE CHOSE YOU. YOU WERE IN HIS HEART. I WANT TO GET THIS TO YOU. YOU WERE IN HIS HEART BEFORE YOU EVER BOWED YOUR KNEES. FOR HE LOVED YOU WHEN YOU WERE UNLOVABLE. &gt;&gt; NOTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE HAS EVER CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; He chose YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD AND HE'LL NEVER UNCHEOOSE YOU. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S A GOD WHO CAN'T CHANGE HIS MIND. SOMEBODY HELP ME PREACH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, CALVARY IS THE ETERNAL ANSWER TO THE TO THE LIE OF UNWORTHINESS BECAUSE AT THE CROSS, JESUS DIDN'T JUST TELL YOU YOU'RE LOVED. HE PROVED THAT YOU'RE LOVED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The Bible said in in Romans 5:8, he commended his love toward us. And that when we WERE YET SINNERS, CHRIST DIED FOR US. &gt;&gt; He didn't wait till you was righteous to die in your place. &gt;&gt; Amen. to take your punishment. &gt;&gt; Oh no, you're worth the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; He declares in Isaiah 49:15, "Can a woman forget her nursing child and not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yay, they may forget, but I'll not forget you. Behold, I have craven thee upon the palms of my hands." You know why we write things? Why we write things in our palms? so we won't forget. &gt;&gt; Come on. AND AT CALVARY, HE PROVED YOUR WORTH ONCE AND FOR ALL. HE SHED HIS BLOOD FOR YOU. AND AND IF HE EVER NEEDS TO REMEMBER, which God can't forget, &gt;&gt; but if he ever NEEDS TO REMEMBER YOUR NAME, &gt;&gt; ALL HE HAS TO DO IS LOOK AT THE NAIL SCARS IN HIS HANDS, THE ETERNAL MARKS OF HIS LOVE. LET ME TELL YOU, THAT'S NOT REJECTION. THAT IS ETERNAL REMEMBRANCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, WHY? BECAUSE HE had made us accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; You are accepted, not rejected. You are chosen, not forgotten. You are loved. You're not overlooked. &gt;&gt; Listen, let me take you back to elementary grade for a moment. Let me take you back to your first beginnings. LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO THE church where it made its first turn toward toward restoration and it was reformation. Wasn't even restoration yet. And that was Martin Luther. And constant condemnation was what troubled. It was a trick that Satan used to torment him. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know from his deliverance came a message. &gt;&gt; And that message was delivered to the church. You know, as a monk, LUTHER WOULD BEAT HIMSELF TRYING TO PAY FOR SINS that Jesus had already paid for. &gt;&gt; But one day a REVELATION CAME AND STRUCK HIM LIKE LIGHTNING THAT READ, "THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH." AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND FAITH liberated him. AND HE REALIZED THAT HOLINESS ISN'T ACHIEVED BY SUFFERING. IT'S RECEIVED BY BELIEVING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND AND LIKEWISE, THERE'S MANY CHRISTIANS TODAY, THEY THEY LIVE UNDER SPIRITUAL SELF-PUNISHMENT. &gt;&gt; THEY THEY'RE REPAYING THEY'RE REPLAYING THEIR PAST. THEY'RE DOUBTING THEIR FORGIVENESS. THEY'RE TRYING TO EARN WHAT GRACE HAS ALREADY GIVEN. BUT THE CROSS DECLARED IT IS FINISHED. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIE BY DOUBT. YOU'RE CALLED BY TO LIVE BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; Faith that Jesus paid it all. &gt;&gt; Faith that our record has been wiped clean. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; FAITH THAT WE STAND NOW IN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST AND WE'RE CLOTHED IN HIS GRACE and we're MADE FREE. SO START, YOU KNOW, STOP LETTING THE DEVIL DRAG YOU THROUGH THE MEMORIES OF YOUR PAST &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT EVEN REMEMBER THEM. &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; STOP LETTING THE DEVIL DRAG YOU THROUGH THE MEMORIES OF YOUR PAST &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THEM. ISAIAH 43:25 AND blazing this in your heart. He said, "I even I am he that blotth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins." &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want you to know, friends, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT IN THIS BATTLE TO REMIND THE DEVIL of his own failures. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE TEMPTER COMES WHISPERING, YOU AREN'T WORTHY, I WANT YOU TO TURN THE TABLES ON HIM. YOU REMIND HIM OF HIS PAST. &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS CAST DOWN LIKE LIGHTNING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT HE'S KICKED OUT OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; AND REMIND HIM OF HIS FUTURE THAT HE'D BE BOUND AND CHAINED AND DESTINED FOR THE LAKE OF FIRE. AND THAT ONE DAY I'LL STAND THERE AND LOOK NARROWLY UPON YOU AND CONSIDER it and SAY, "IS THIS THE MAN that made the earth to tremble and that shake kingdoms?" [applause] This one, &gt;&gt; this nasty devil. And then I want you to remind yourself of your future. &gt;&gt; Your past is buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; And God put up a permanent sign that says no fishing. &gt;&gt; Nobody's got a right to fish for your sins or my sins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're under the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil can't EVEN FISH THEM OUT. COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH YES. YOUR YOUR PAST IS BURIED IN THE SEA OF GOD'S FORGIVENESS. YOUR PRESENT IS SECURED AS LOVE. YOUR FUTURE IS RADIANT WITH THE GLORY OF HEAVEN. AS FAR AS THE EAST IS FROM THE WEST, SO HE HAS REMOVED OUR TRANSGRESSIONS FROM US. &gt;&gt; I didn't MAKE THAT UP. THAT'S PSALMS 103 VERSE 12. &gt;&gt; And that makes it that in his presence is the fullness of joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you're not forgotten. &gt;&gt; Rejection is a lie. &gt;&gt; Unworthiness is a deception. &gt;&gt; The truth is you're chosen. Redeemed accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; I don't feel that way. Well, like Daniel Williams said one time comes to mind. Said, you might feel like you're so ugly you have to sneak up to get on a drink of water, [laughter] BUT CHRIST GAVE HIS BLOOD FOR YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, TEAR DOWN THAT THOUGHT OF REJECTION. &gt;&gt; SILENCE THE LIE THAT SAYS YOU'RE NOT WORTHY OR YOU'RE NOT LOVED OR YOU'RE NOT BEING BLESSED. YOU'RE ENGRAVED IN HIS HANDS. YOU'RE SEALED BY HIS SPIRIT. YOU'RE DESTINED FOR THE GLORY. YOU'RE NOT FORGOTTEN. YOU'RE YOU'RE FAVORED. YOU'RE NOT FORSAKEN. YOU'RE CHOSEN. YOU'RE NOT CONDEMNED. YOU'RE REDEEMED. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE SAY? I KNOW THE THOUGHTS THAT I THINK TOWARD YOU. &gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T KNOW, GOD. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ME? GO. I'M AFRAID OF WHAT YOU THINK. I KNOW THE THOUGHTS I THINK ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29:11. I KNOW THE THOUGHTS I THINK OF YOU, &gt;&gt; SAITH THE LORD. THOUGHTS OF PEACE AND NOT OF EVIL TO BRING YOU TO A HOPE AND A FUTURE. &gt;&gt; That's your expected end. &gt;&gt; Come on. DON'T LET SOME DEVIL SIT ON YOUR SHOULDER AND TWIST THAT. WELL, MY EXPECTED END WILL BE THE LAKE OF FIRE. NO, MY EXPECTED IAN IS A HOPE AND A FUTURE. THAT'S WHAT HE CAME TO BRING. &gt;&gt; A HOPE AND A FUTURE. &gt;&gt; NOT TO ABANDON ME, NOT TO LEAVE ME behind &gt;&gt; because I'm accepted in the beloved. I'm his love. I'm the love of his life. I'M THE JOY OF HIS HEART. HE SINGS OVER ME. I AM HIS MASTERPIECE. AND GUESS WHAT? HE'S NOT THROUGH WORKING ON ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO IF HE SEES SOMETHING A LITTLE WRONG, HE'LL FIX IT. [cheering] YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FIXING TIM THROUGH IT. HE'LL FIX IT. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hopelessness says it'll never change, &gt;&gt; but Jesus said, "The spirit of the Lord is on me. &gt;&gt; He hath anointed me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To bring deliverance to the captives. &gt;&gt; Don't fear. Here, here's a word from the church age book. Don't fear little flock. All I am your heir to. All my power is yours. My omnipotent is yours. As I stand in your midst, I have not come. Oh, listen. I have not come to bring you fear and failure, but love and COURAGE AND ABILITY. ALL POWER IS GIVEN UNTO me and it is yours to use. YOU SPEAK THE WORD AND I will perform it. This is my covenant and it will never fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; So when the light of God's forgiveness and that he's declared you righteous &gt;&gt; and holy, when that breaks through the darkness, that's when joy returns. &gt;&gt; And the joy of the Lord is your strength. &gt;&gt; But sometimes we reason. And this is one of the devil's most deceptive weapons. Human reasoning that exalts the intellect above revelation. And it says it doesn't make sense. Well, you're not alone. There's a lot of things in life don't make sense. That's why we sing we'll understand it better by and by. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because all we see is from this human perspective. &gt;&gt; We don't see God's great plan. &gt;&gt; Because you know sometimes, you know, we have this human reason that exalts intellect above revelation says it doesn't make sense. But that's when faith says nevertheless at thy word. Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't make sense. Peter said, "I fished all night and caught nothing." &gt;&gt; There ain't nothing. I I DID IT ALL. I I TRIED I TRIED EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME TO TRY. IT DON'T MAKE SENSE. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, &gt;&gt; at thy word, &gt;&gt; I'll let down the net. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the next nets begin to break with fishes. But you see that's where reason argues for revelation just obeys. &gt;&gt; You you SEE THE BIBLE SAID TRUST IN THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND LEAN not to your own understanding. And there's only one way to do it and that's tear him down. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT argue a stronghold DOWN. YOU CAN'T OUTTHINK THE DEVIL. So I I wanted you to quit your stinking thinking. &gt;&gt; AMEN. CAST DOWN. CAST IT DOWN BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD AND THE BLOOD OF JESUS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU OVERCOME BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB AND BY THE WORD OF YOUR TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; So take every lie, &gt;&gt; take every reason &gt;&gt; and bring it captive to Christ. &gt;&gt; And do more than just cast it down. Replace the devil's lie with God's truth until your mind is renewed and your faith is free. I know. I'm going to try this. I don't know it'll work. So, let the musicians come. I don't know if that'll help me stop preaching or not, &gt;&gt; but I know &gt;&gt; that many of you came to Christ, you was thinking the fight would be over, [crying] &gt;&gt; that salvation would mean a rest &gt;&gt; from temptation. &gt;&gt; But instead, you found yourself in another kind of war. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A war inside your mind &gt;&gt; and you're weary from it all. &gt;&gt; And you'd love to never be tempted again. &gt;&gt; And you cry out, "Lord, when will this struggle ever end?" When will it, Lord? Well, it will end, but not till we leave this flesh. That's right. &gt;&gt; As long as you're in this flesh, you're going to fight &gt;&gt; to the day you leave it. &gt;&gt; You know, the the flesh is going to lust against the spirit against the spirit against the flesh. There's going to be a holy war &gt;&gt; that's going to wage within you. &gt;&gt; And you know where we got this flesh? We got it from our first birth. &gt;&gt; We were born in sin. We were shaved in iniquity. And your soul's been redeemed and washed in the blood, but you still live in a body &gt;&gt; that's under the curse. &gt;&gt; And Satan will anoint that body. It senses its appetites to war against the spirit that dwells in you. And your flesh isn't saved. &gt;&gt; But one glorious day it will be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Philippians 2:3 and verse 20 says, "For our conversation, the way we live is from heaven, from whence we also look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, WHO SHALL CHANGE OUR BOWED BODY, &gt;&gt; that it may be fashioned like his own glorious body. &gt;&gt; Think of it now. A new body, a body that's never been defiled by sin. &gt;&gt; A body that an evil thought can never enter. YES. &gt;&gt; A BODY THAT I NEVER NO FEAR. &gt;&gt; THAT I NEVER FEEL LUST, &gt;&gt; THAT I NEVER TASTE JEALOUSY, THAT I NEVER BURN WITH ANGER. &gt;&gt; Just peace. &gt;&gt; Peace. &gt;&gt; Wonderful peace &gt;&gt; flowing like a river from the throne of grace. &gt;&gt; And until that day, the battle may rage, but I want to remind you, I'm declaring to you this morning, the victory is already won. Amen. &gt;&gt; You were not called to be defeated. &gt;&gt; You were called to overcome. &gt;&gt; CAST DOWN THOSE STRONGHOLDS. &gt;&gt; TAKE THEM DOWN. TEAR THEM DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND REPLACE IT with the word of God. &gt;&gt; March forward with the sword of the spirit &gt;&gt; and say, "I'm going through, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm going through. &gt;&gt; No matter what others do, I'm pressing on the upward way. I'm climbing higher every day. I'm leaving behind this world and all it is. And every day I'll fight the battle. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to start today with a renewed mind, &gt;&gt; a cleansed mind, a mind to set on Christ. The word has COME TO SET MY THOUGHTS ON Jesus Christ and knowing I can prevail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. No, it's not the millennium. It's not a perfect world. This is a broken world. In this fallen world, people wound one another. But in a world like this, God still heals. &gt;&gt; God still restores. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you've been through. And maybe I don't know what you've been through. Maybe maybe you don't even want to tell anybody what you've been through. Maybe nobody should know what you've been through. &gt;&gt; My daddy was an abuser. My mama was an alcoholic. My grandfather was immoral. That's the way I am. The way I am. You don't have to be. You can't keep going through life blaming why you are what you are &gt;&gt; because of what other people have done and said &gt;&gt; or even what you've done or said. God's going to give rising up a people right now who will say right now, &gt;&gt; right now I'm not going to let my past define who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now, I'm quitting. I'm stopping the thoughts of unbelief in my heart, my mind. And I'm going to get my mind stayed on Christ because great peace have they, you know, that whose mind is stayed on Christ. &gt;&gt; Get it on Jesus. &gt;&gt; And forget those things that are in the past. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, my daddy died when I was young. My my mother abandoned me. My this happened. This happened. You know, junk happens. This is not the millennium. Horrible things happen. If you've had a good childhood, thank God for it. &gt;&gt; That won't be your trial, but you'll have another. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, you may not be able to change your childhood. &gt;&gt; You may not be able to rewrite your past. &gt;&gt; You may not be able to undo your pain. But you can refuse to let it define you. So I want you to do what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Forget those things which are behind &gt;&gt; and I want you to reach unto those things which are before and say today I press toward the mark &gt;&gt; toward the goal of a higher calling. &gt;&gt; And I'm tearing down the strongholds in my mind &gt;&gt; and I'm going to rule. Let the God of peace rule in my mind from this day on. I'm taking control of those demon thoughts &gt;&gt; and I'm casting them down &gt;&gt; right now. While I've been preaching, Satan's been running. &gt;&gt; He has been cast out. He has strongholds have been torn down. Deliverance has started happening in the house of God. And right now already you feel lighter. &gt;&gt; You feel unburdened. [applause] &gt;&gt; JOY IS [cheering] RETURNING. STRENGTH IS RETURNING. GLORY IS RETURNING. POWER IS RETURNING BECAUSE WHY? YOU'VE GOT A RENEWED MIND. YOUR MIND IS NOW SET ON CHRIST. [cheering] GO WALK IN THAT. GO BELIEVE IN THAT. [applause] &gt;&gt; Accept what he said about you &gt;&gt; and love him with all your heart.
