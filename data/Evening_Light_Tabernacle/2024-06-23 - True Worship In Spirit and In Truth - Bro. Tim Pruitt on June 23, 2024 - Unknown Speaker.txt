them in bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to [Music] Jesus wow what a treasure you have here Michael Paul that's a strong name Michael who is like Jehovah we are we are thankful for the blessings of the Lord's Upon Our Lives and truly children are a gift of God and and God has entrusted a gift to your life uh it's a blessing that God has bestowed upon you and um today as we think of that blessing I I go back to the the thought when the parents brought Jesus to the temple to be to be um offered and dedicated to the Lord and and here we are at this moment in time and holding a little gift of God in our hands today to offer to God back what he gave us what a blessing it is life is such a blessing but with it of course comes a responsibility and it's not only these parents responsibility but us as a whole church family to provide support and loving care and guidance to a little child like this to be here for it to be a beacon an example for this child to follow and of course all of the work that we could do whether it be in Sunday school and and admonitions and preaching from the pulpit does very little good unless it's also at home and so you know it starts with a Godly home it starts with parents that are consecrated to God dedicated to God and today when we hold this responsibility then we know that God has empowered us and entrusted us with this and that he is more than able to give us the wisdom and the guidance the leadership a long life's journey and so today God has given you an awful wonderful gift it's precious value it thank God for it and then don't mess up with what God gave you by living a life that is fruitful that is one that is worthy of following that we can say to this child follow me as I follow Christ let's pray today as we offer this little child to do the Lord father we want to thank you for this little couple Lord standing here oh God it speaks of Grace it speaks of redemption it speaks of the love that you have for us Lord we thank you for the work that you're doing in their lives and you have done and we're asking for your blessings to be upon this family upon the union Lord upon the mother and the dad that they would follow you with all their hearts and give a loving caring example for this child to follow to point it always to Jesus Christ now today I hold this child in my hand and I bless it oh God in your name I ask the angels of God I know there's an Angel that's been assigned to this child at Birth and may it watch over it all the days of its life Lord and as the cherubims have been sent to lead us to the tree of life may even the angel of your presence always go with this child pointing it toward life I ask it in the name of Jesus bless this home

in Jesus name amen amen God bless you as always it's wonderful to be here thank you for being here today and some of you have driven a long way and made a lot of sacrifices to be here Jesus knows and he knows exactly what your need is the desire in your heart and the longing in your soul he's here to speak to you in a very real way let's look to John chapter 4 and we'll read from verse three and it's a little bit lengthy scripture reading this morning but I I love the word of God and I I think um it's Eternal I know it is and so because it is an eternal word I believe that it is applicable for the day that we're living in and as I've been pointing out to you it is a prophecy of the last day and so as we look at the scripture and we realize it is prophesying of a people in this last day who is the Fulfillment of the word of God then you know we want to just look into it and and search the scripture because it speaks of us John 4 and verse3 he left Judea and departed again unto Galilee and he must needs go through Samaria then cometh he to a city of Samaria area which is called sikar near the to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there and Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria to uh draw water and Jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciples were going away into the city to buy meat then SE the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew askest drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans and Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that said to thee give me to drink thou wouldest ask of him and he would have given thee living water and the woman said unto him sir thou H has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us this well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle and Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of Living Water of water springing up into everlasting life and the woman said unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw and Jesus said unto her go call thy husband and come hither and the woman answered and Saidi have no husband and Jesus said unto her thou has said well I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou Hast is not thy husband in thou this in that said us thou truly and the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship and Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father you worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman said unto him I know that the Messiah cometh which is called the Christ when he is come he will tell us all things and Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man men said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her the woman then left her water pot and went her away into the City and said to the men come see a man which told me all things that I ever did is not this the Christ God bless you you can be seated as I said we are once again searching the scriptures today we are looking for their testimony and their witness of us and the day and hour that we're living in we are drawing comfort from the scripture to know you know exactly what time we are in and where we are in this journey as Daniel's searched the books to see if it was time to go back to the Homeland we are also searching the book is this the time of the Rapture of the church you know we want to know exactly the day and the hour that we're living in as brother BR preached to us of the importance of recognizing our day and his message it would be to Jerusalem that Jesus would say as he wept over them oh that you would have known this and and this thy this thy day that the the the things concerning thy peace if you would have just known it but because you didn't know because you turned a blind eye and was insensitive to what I was doing and could not discern the time and the hour then judgment has come upon you and knowing that this is a day of trouble we are searching the book to find rest and and this unnamed woman the one we call the woman at the well contains the way into the entrance of the Supernatural and brother bram's me readings it was the most told story to contact the human spirit and to open the door to the supernatural he would he would tell this and and this would as he would begin to tell it it would begin to unfold as he and then he would step into that door of Supernatural and do the same things that Jesus did Discerning the the thoughts and intents of the heart and it was here through this dialogue that Jesus contacted and opened up This Woman's Spirit to in order to receive Redemption now her sin was exposed but also the questions of her heart was answered and and and of course it was here that we learned from this discourse what is the source of true worship So today we're going to be speaking on true worship in spirit and in truth because we we Ponder and it's been questioned and it always will be asked and thought of and promoted um of one place or another to be the place where God will meet a man or a woman and so here again you know what is the source of true worship was it a place was it on a mountain or was it at Jerusalem you see the Samaritans believed that Jehovah was to be worshiped on on Mount uh Garrison while the Jews believed that God was to be worshiped in Jerusalem and at that moment in time while Jesus was talking to the woman he declared to her you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews and of course at that moment that was where where God uh where salvation was was under the blood of bulls and goats and and yet Jesus points at the same time to the end of that worship and and he says um to her in verse 21 woman believe me the hour cometh when you will neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father but the hour cometh verse 23 the hour cometh and and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so this tells us that God has a chosen place of worship and of course that is always where he put his name he would it would be where he placed his name would be where that he would command men to worship if you'll look with me to Deuteronomy um 16 verse two thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God and of the flock and the herd in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there so you can see God would have a place that he wanted to be worshiped and he would put his name in that place so it was very important to know the name of God and know where he chose to put his name and of course the Jews believed that Jerusalem was where God had chosen to put it place his name and they had good reason to believe that because the glory of the Lord had come down and filled Solomon's Temple and had accepted the sacrifice there and while at the same time the Samaritans who were foreigners um into the land of of Israel they were brought there and by the Assyrians the Babylonians from other nations and some had mixed with the Jews and and they were produced kind of a a hybrid race and a hybrid religion and and they insisted that mount gism was the true place of worship and they had built a temple there to rival The Temple at Jerusalem and the Samaritans accepted now they believed parts of the word and which is why they built their Temple there they they read in the first five books of Moses um of how that God's blessing where the blessings of God came down as he as they when they entered the land he had some of the people to stand upon Mount garam and the other people to stand upon Mount eel and one was pronounced curses and the other was pronounced blessings and here upon Mount gsam was the blessings had been pronounced uh here upon this mountain and the Samaritans based this on the first five books of Moses but they rejected the rest of the Bible you see so their claim was based on some scripture but not all the scripture and so they would refuse to act actually see the progression where that God did indeed pronounce blessings here but now he had a place where he had chosen to put his name and they refused to see the progression how that the kind of Glory came down into Solomon's Temple and they only would point back to the blessings upon Mount GIS now so Jesus would say you worship what you know not what you don't take all the scripture you don't see the progression you refuse to see part of the word you worship what you you know not what we know what we worship for our Salvation is of the Jews but then Jesus said he pronounced something very stunning he said that Jerusalem was ceasing that it would no longer be the place of worship and so he was saying the hour com and yet now is you know you see when true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for he says the father seeketh such to worship Him and of course today that's the problem that we have around the world today every denomination and religion claims to be the Jerusalem that God has chosen to put his name and then every cult including message calls wants to believe their mountain of truth that they are piled up like a mountain of evidence is God's chosen place of worship but there is only one place that God has chosen to put his name and it is only there that you can have true worship all other worship is for nothing it is in vain and it is true worship that God wants and only true worship will God accept it's the kind God seeks and that he wants now it was true that there were blessings pronounced on Mount Garrison and that that's where God was but that was not where he was at present and Jesus said Jerusalem as a place of worship would also become obsolete that it would no longer be the place where you were required to go and worship and it would was true that Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem once held the Shina Glory that upon that spot upon that hill now of course that Temple had been demolished of course now we have herod's Temple and it is built up and it's a beautiful edifice and and it's a great Memorial and it's a great church but there's no spirit in it amen there never comes a kind of Glory to fill that Temple that was never there but there had been a time in the past on that spot on Temple rock where the spirit of God came down and dwelt and and there kind of Glory went behind the holiest of holies but the day Jesus was crucified while hanging on the cross a lightning boat from Heaven ripped the veil from the of the temple from top to bottom and it revealed and showed there was no God there there was absolutely nothing there no sh kind of Glory no power of God no anointing of God no God there at all just a empty elice a religion without power a religion without life a worship that could not change a life I want you to think where was that glory of God now where did he dwell where had he chosen to put his name we look away from there right down the hill from there on Mount Mariah and they're hanging at the near the same place that Abraham would offer Isaac was the son of God hanging upon a cross and he was the sacrifice received by God as Jesus cried into thy hands I command my spirit and it's proof that he was received on the third day he rose from the dead you see it was the proof it was the proof of the sh kind of Glory of the power of Resurrection it was the proof of the spirit of God that was there in Jesus Christ and as Jesus said the hour cometh when you will neither in this Mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father you see Jerusalem was ceasing it would no longer be a place where God would meet his people it would no longer be a all the all the sacrifices the offerings that were made the the worship the fastings the prayers would no longer be accepted now we do know they were accepted just a little bit earlier because Zachariah met an angel there amen and they and as he offered the incense and his prayers went up the angel comes and answers to prayer and says I'm going to I'm going to send the Messiah but but before I do I'm sending Elijah the prophet and he's going to he's going to be the Forerunner for this Messiah to come you see God had had actually spoke in that Temple but now in this moment now all of a sudden it changes it changes from that that edifice on on that heel to a man hanging on a cross now I want you to understand brother Brandon picks this up in the message indictment let me share it with you he said now Christ is God's provided lamb now notice how appropriate it was showing that Jerusalem was ceasing it was an effect until that hour amen it was an effect to that hour remember remember this I want you to stop and think brother randam said you know that that there will come a time where they will scream this is in the seals they will scream and cry and it and they will get nothing it will be revealed in the Thunders to think about this the day before the day before they could come to that altar they could offer a lamb it would be accepted but suddenly it changes and you can bring the same lamb that Moses said bring the same thing and go through the same rituals that had been said for hundreds and thousands of years and had worked and had interceded and prayers were received and all of a sudden they changes yeah there's no God there he is left I want you to think as brother randam said they will scream and cry and get nothing can you imagine coming to the same altars that Moses instituted the same set up copying mirroring everything that he saw in heaven and now come and offer the same kind of prayers that had worked days before months before years before and now nothing you see it was an effect under that hour the blood of the Lamb was all right we're talking about the animal lamb was all right until that day but but at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done amen there's a new one and the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds and they were condemning and doing the very same things there that they had to do that's right and then he goes on and brings it forward to our day and God be blessed for this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day because that churches is doing the same thing until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ's word from then on comes the word and the word only from the Pascal lamb passed away and the Christ become our lamb at the day of crucifixion at the day that the denomination crucified the word of God and accepted a greed instead of the word that's the day that the word came into full effect that's right I'll tell you what we're living in a day where the word has full effect that's right that's why we preach a Full Gospel a full word full power full anointing that's now you see you can look away from this empty edifice this holy worship the rituals hear the the splitting of the veil had unveiled there was no God there but where was their God he was hanging on a cross and Jesus was shown to be the temple the place where God receives true worship gears might have been the place of blessings Jerusalem may have been and was the place where thousands Came To Worship and the glory of God had once filled the temple and they could talk about how God answered prayer here and what God did here and how he acted there and how his presence felt and and had so overcome the priest till they were unable to even Minister and and the the singers and everything the glory fi the temple they could talk about what was passed but they couldn't point out and identify a present tense God understand this our worship must have a present tense God God without a doubt once moved in denominational systems that's why they built an altar there the methodists built an altar the Lutheran built an altar each one had their Jerusalem or their gism you know there had a place God met me here here's where here's where he moved here's what he did and and it was a truly a move of God it wasn't fake it wasn't false it was God that's where he was but that was not where he is and that's why they built an altar but that day brother bradam said that denominations crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed instead of the word that's the day the word comes into full effect now all must come to God's only provided place of worship and that's in Christ he is seeking those to worship him both in spirit and truth remember it's the place where God has chosen to put his name amen and he play he chose to put his name in Jesus Christ so therefore it is in that name by putting his name in Christ it designated him to be the specific place of worship choosing to meet with and be worshiped by people in Christ alone now I want you to notice something here Christ is represented by a male lamb the lamb had to be a male not a female God's chosen this this shows us God's chosen place of worship is not in a church but it's in Jesus Christ God did not put her name anywhere but put his name in him and this signifies that salvation is found only in Jesus Christ and not in any church or any Creed or person our holy place now God did not choose a church represented as a she but rather but rather him remember he chose a place to worship be worshiped as not a she but rather him him being the meeting place the lamb this male lamb is significance because it must be without blemish however you see Christ embodies his Pur Purity and even his Pilot his enemy testified that he could find no fault in him and brother bradam Illustrated this point saying can a church can a group can a denomination can it bleed he asked us to illustrate the point that denominations cannot provide the same lifegiving sacrifice that Jesus did he emphasized it a denomination like a bill in our organization cannot bleed because it does not possess the essence of life that the blood represents so brother Brandon and God's chosen place of worship he talks about this he said notice here the type of Passover foreshadowed Jesus we notice that here the sacrifice of Blood by death the sacrifice of blood was the place that foreshadowed Christ can a denomination BL bleed could you think of a church bleeding a denomination bleeding certainly not it took blood to bleed from a life and the life here Jesus comes in view by the lamb the lamb was a type of Christ and foreshadowed Christ because he was the Lamb of God that John introduced that takes away the sin the world and Jesus coming to view here in Exodus chapter 12 notice it was the only place death could not strike When Death was was about to strike the land there had to be a certain place all from under this died only one place I didn't mean it was one house but there was one place where the lamb was killed where the Lamb's blood was the death angel could not strike because it was the one place God had put his name and that lamb was named back Yonder in beginning a lamb notice it was the one place he could not strike so now what we learn from this your church is a collective body our group of churches like of like Fellowship might be great people in it but if you deny the body the blood and the blood is the spirit are the word you're dead the minute you do it you see this is what happened when they denied and crucified the the word and what it did it only caused the word to come into full effect but it also cast out the other places as place of worship so you see Jesus Christ is where he chose to place his name not not in a church but in his son Jesus Christ notice it was a maale lamb a he not her not a church she but his name not her name where was he going to meet the people was not in her name but in his name him the lamb notice now we say the church the Great Mighty Church she did this she did that she's weighed the storms we picked up in population we're great in numbers we're a mighty Church she's a great thing but God never said anything about a she said him him is the meeting place the lamb not the church not her name but his name he didn't put her name anywhere he put his name in him so today the only place of worship is in Jesus Christ and God chooses that place of worship puts his name there and I remember it was God's choice not man's Choice man cannot choose the place to worship that is God's chosen place and some today want to insist I'm going I'm dealing with something for a minute because some sometimes people today want to insist that God's place of worship today is in the bride and then they labeled that group that supports their preferred Doctrine to be the bride so that means they believe that she and not he is the place of worship now you see here again he did not put Worship in her name but in his name it doesn't lay in her I don't care we can form message groups or have a message Church it doesn't matter that's not where his name is his name is in Christ you can come here and never enter into worship but if you can get into Jesus Christ by one Spirit you're baptized in that body filled with the Holy Ghost what is it that is the place where you really worship that's where worship is accepted nothing outside of [Applause] that but how is it that Christians started worshiping in her name and not his name how is it that many are called by her name and not his name why is it even that baptism is that act of claiming a soul for Christ is not done in his name in marriage the bride takes on the name of the groom in birth the child takes on the name of the father and Ephesians 3:15 said of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named so you see the original Church started out with true worship they they had truth and they had spirit with it amen look look here they had they had the double portion they had spirit and in truth they did not have Spirit without truth neither did they have truth without Spirit but wasn't long before men who arose who took elements of Truth and distorted them much like the Samaritans had done ignoring parts of the word and esteeming other parts of the word in the sardan age in the first uh in the first step back toward restoration you remember God gave us gath and rebuke now you young people were privileged the other night to hear one wonderful message on the church ages from from our brother Aaron those of you that was not here or didn't stream it I'm going to go back over some of those points for you if you were here I'm going to just make sure you got it so you know you know yeah I'm I'm going to I'm actually going to repr preach some of his sermon not because he didn't do it good because you didn't hear it good so in Revelation 3 and 1 unto the angel of the church start is right these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy work that thou Hast a name that thou livest and are dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God so here Jesus addresses now this church which is actually making the first step toward toward restoration they are not restoration they are re in reformation and Jesus says of her of them said I know your works that you got a name that you're dead in verse two he said I've not found that works perfect before God and we find that that in most ages the spirit has praised the true church so that would be that would be praise and then he would tell them things he was displeased with for example he would say say to the first days um you know he would praise them you've tried those apostles who said they were uh who said they were true and you found them liars and and that they're not true Apostles and you you stood there right in their face and said you're not saying what Paul said therefore you're false and he he praised him for that but then he turns around but I got somewhat against you but in this age this entire age is an age of complete condemn Nation that's right there isn't you've done some good works and you you know you you've done well here or there he says nothing of good works there's there's no praise it's only condemnation and brother brandham talks about that he said one the leadership of the spirit is superseded by human hierarchy to the poor pure word of God and it's free benefit to all men was put aside for Creeds and dogmas and politics and and he says three Worship in spirit and gifts of the Spirit were cast aside for mariolatry and was was assuming a greater place in the Christian worship notice as he says the woman the woman Mary became the preeminent one even the one that you must you must approach that you know he she only could T turn the Heart of Jesus that God was mad at you and the father would kill you but this loving mother would turn the Heart of Jesus to intercede on the behalf of his father so you could be saved can you imagine that now so you see in that time there were there was begin to be you know the the the church begin to worship and you know the Mary then become the principal figure of the church and during this time in history there was a lot of technological advancements uh many many things that began to happen you know there was great advances like the Gutenberg printing press there in Germany and and that there was travel that increased and ideas began to spread and there would be Scholars who come with with the word I want you to get it they're bringing word they're bringing the Bible nobody's ever seen the Bible nobody's been able to open his precious pages and read it I want you to remember when you read your Bible or you don't read your Bible men died burned a steak for putting it in your language for making it available it was given with a great cost and you know where there there they had brought Greek manuscripts of the word which would be you know the purest form you know you could get Latin and translate it from Latin but somebody translated that from Greek into Latin and so they they would bring the the closest thing the closest language that they could could get and they would they would then translate it from that purest form into the languages of Germany or languages of of England and and so um this this be to push the the Reformation so strongly books and tracks were spreading with great FY and the Bible was being put in the hands of of the common people and in that day and it wasn't too many years ago that even in Catholic Nations to be caught reading a Bible would send you to death that's exactly right it was not to be read by you because you couldn't understand it therefore we'll tell you what we want you to know and so this but with all of this word coming I mean the Bible for the first time and we read it and Men starts getting different opinions and from these opinions sprung denominations you know you would think how is that more word yet there's more sex and more Splinter groups that makes more denomination you see because true trth without spirit makes denominations it makes the the the temples on Mount garison it makes the temples in Jerusalem where that no God is there but God was here God once moved this is what God one time did listen church we can m must never get into the place where that our God is a god of History that's alone but that a prophet in this day came to raise him up out of History to show him as a present tense God Amen not a god of the past but the god of the present and out of there many men got inspired and begin to rise up and would see parts of the scripture and Calvinism would would would go take off and it would out there would come his his teachings would come denominations and then Armenian ISM took an opposite sight to that no it means this and so they built their their temples and this is the Jerusalem and this is where all men must come to worship and then of course their minds are so still so tainted with the hierarchy of Catholicism they use they were so used to Bishops and archbishops that was supposed to rule over them they just didn't see any need to get away from it so they brought that form right on in with them and the next thing you know you know again they were built on the ideas of man and not the inspiration of the Holy Ghost it was truth without spirit and truth without Spirit becomes hybridized it becomes unbalanced now instead of a Reformation or restoration it was a Reformation it was just reforming trying to reform and fix the problem and the errors of the church because it recognized the errors of the teaching of Rome so here they're going to fix it but this Reformation would only lead to more denominations more daughters to the great now remember now you know sometimes people get offended because you use that term but that's a Bible term and she is a because she was untrue to her husband she took in seeds of other men and gave birth to men's ideas and produced out of them instead of Christians Baptists methodists Presbyterians Catholics and if you're not careful message let's remember friends when we when we see men rise and and and lives produced that are in the image of the woman instead of the image of Christ then you see that there there's something you can't see nothing of Christ in it but you see the woman because there's some man somewhere who is brought in other seeds and so you see that the Bible talks about the Judgment of the great and we're living in the day where judgment Jud is being poured out upon the and her daughters and part of that judgment included this word come out of her my people which is why you are here today because you are seeking a place of true worship because you've seen The Emptiness of religion that's right now instead of reformation it was a restoration it was a Reformation information is about having correct Doctrine it's about getting Church order correct it's about the clergy positioned it's about you know Reformation comes as men who are leaders arise and reform the Church and adjust the doctrines but as but restoration comes and returns to the church by the power of Pentecost that's right I want you to get it the power Pentecost I'm not talking about a move I'm not talking about a Zeus street I'm talking about the holy spirit amen where it came on the day of Pentecost you see so again it's truth balanced with spirit and it's Spirit balanced with truth it follows Jesus all the way it's a double portion of John 14:12 where where the true church with true worship does the Greater Works but instead of becoming true worship with spirit and Truth they got snared in that as one began to jockey for who's got the greater Ministry and which church is right and which group of reformers is right and who is the most influential and they begin to fight over members and splitting hairs and worship be is becomes a PL becomes a worship of Pride as F pet doctrines and ideas become exalted and brother Aaron wedes tonight or Friday night he he U he spoke of that that essay that commenius wrote of one thing needed and and I'm just going to quote a few things out of there each Church reckons itself as the one the true one or at least as the purest truest part of it while among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred and and of course we know this is a shame because these people have just come together out of the Roman Catholic church and and now their persecution is on each other you know it doesn't take a movement very long they're not very far removed until men rise up with little isms and schisms and pet doctrines and form their groups and call their place the Jerusalem and that we're the one got it right but I want you to understand God called a halt to all Jerusalem oh mount gism it has all been called at halt it is over with in the only place of worship is in spirit and in truth by meeting in Jesus Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the only entrance it is the door into Christ this is a shame it's happened Sal too familiar because the cycle of Revival and death it never fails you see out the Bible they forg their different Creeds they these are their fortresses their bulwarks there behind which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks and divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God the new birth how man must be changed in the likeness of Christ to become a partaker of the divine nature scarcely anything is said the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and I just want to say it's incomprehensible how men can take a message and split it into so many different ways until we have a thousand different views and then we disfellowship because you see it a little different way and some of them become worse than Rome you'd be better off having your son married to a Catholic girl and be married into some of these Cults and that would be horrible but as Comedia said there's one thing need it return to Christ look to Christ as the only leader walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith but you see it's that Corinthian attitude of I'm a Paul and I'm Apostle amen I'm a sephus I you know I'm I'm third pull or I'm uh two Soul or I'm seven Thunder or I'm uh I'm Coleman I'm a follower of he's the Apostle or here's the here's the veil he's the the teacher you know here here's all of this and and the next thing you know we have one thing raising up in another and it causes the body to be fragmented and the spirit of God finds it deplorable it offends him because not one of them died for you that's and brother Brandon said they are living a name but they're dead you see certainly they were dead they died the minute they organized that's what happened with Luther we're talking about reformation the you know the the beginning of the restoration that died the minute they organized the great groups tied themselves in matrimony to the state and that did it actually they would get the power of politics behind them so not not just with Luther rising up but he would also have men you know that were um uh Governors or Kings over different cities and they would go to war for him and they were persecutions and there were many killed from Protestant and Catholic amen even uh you know going against the other ones you know one one might fight against the tendel move or one might fight against the zland move and and you know there were millions they were they were bloody now you see they here were these people who had criticized the Roman Church they knew the unrighteous political and and spiritual unions yet Luther as when Peter was overbalanced by the judaizers went straight ahead and made the state instead of God the defender of the Faith remember that who is our Defender who is the defender of the faith only God it ain't it ain't our place to to correct everybody it isn't our place to to run everybody else down and we're right and we're to Jerusalem it's our place to make a place of worship that where we come and honor Jesus Christ somebody with me this morning amen notice he he's this this first denomination of repute that came out of the Harlot when Luther died it wasn't long until they had a hierarchy like the one they fought and then this is the reason God was so unhappy by the second generation they they're they're right they're actually a daughter they're just they're just an image a smaller a smaller image of the Roman system they had gone back and they didn't know it and how did this happen so quick it don't take long amen the second generation and doing so they showed they were the daughter of the great they defiled them themselves became harlot just like their mother same ill repute and you know how is it because instead of living the name of Jesus instead of making his name and his word great they took on the name of their new churches they begin to say we're Lutheran we're Calvinists we're we're this one or that one and you know it was a name that said we're alive you know I'm a Lutheran we're alive you know we're we're calvinist we see we've got life look at look at our growth look at people coming everybody's coming our Direction you see see how God is blessing look at our huge numbers look at our great man but what God was looking for was Christians that's right amen that's what he's looking for today not I'm in the message he's looking for sons of God people been bored by the spirit people that don't just have a name and yet are dead but people who have in them people who know the true place of worship and they have entered into Christ and and they're entering into Christ they get their prayers answered Hallelujah you see we can look today and say well we got a mighty message you know what men have done with it in just a few Generations they've splendored it into a thousand pieces it's been a great move of God but you see the cycle and Revival of death it never fails and some of them must become the daughters of the you see they were living a name that wasn't his it a warning to Revelation three those in the starting age Be watchful and strengthen the things that which remain for you're ready to die have not found thy Work perfect before God brother brandom says of that I wish it could be said that the sardan age was a restoration instead of a Reformation I cannot say that the word does not call it a restoration it calls but certainly calls it a Reformation had it been a restoration is everybody here ke in right now had it been a restoration that age would have been another Pentecostal age now you know you can't make the word of God lie amen if we're truly restored we're restored back to the faith of the fathers how many hundreds of times did Brother brandom tell us of why Elija was being sent to bring a restoration a restoration not reform the past movements not to try to straighten him up but to become what was lost that's right to be restored back to the original Faith again to come back to Truth where we can worship God in spirit you see had it been a restoration that age would have been another Pentecostal age but it was not the best could say of it could be said of it strengthen that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing my yes it was certainly was that age had justification but miss sanctification and the baptism with the spirit that's what God's original plans was that's what they had at Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified and they were filled with the Holy Ghost amen so you see that's the reason that there is a church it's the it's the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on the earth causing them to do him to do Mighty works that he did come back on the church at Pentecost so they did the works that he did this age did not have those works oh they had the written word but not the revealed word notice revealed words come supernaturally that's right it is a revelation it comes from God it it's a supernatural experience but he said this was a Reformation but fear not little flock God said I will restore that's the Comfort we have today I will restore and this reform was going to be the start of it he according to his promise was to take the church from the depth of Satan to in the dark ages to the depth of God they had at Pentecost and and in the first few years of the existence of the church so can you see why that many many will go through the same cycle of Revival and death you're blind if you can't see the difference if it was a restoration it would be another Pentecost sure the age had justification but it missed sanctification that's right it missed the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother brand tells us that was his original plan and that's what they had at Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified they were filled with the spirit and that it was the very reason he sends justification that's right and I want to just say to you today you know if you have been justified by faith in other words you have repented of your sins that's wonderful and that's great that you've had that experience and it's real and it's true but it's not the stopping place that's right it is the place you're are starting that's right you're going to have to Journey on from there amen and and then you go on to sanctification and the Very the reason for sanctification where you get rid of alcohol and tobacco and you live true to your your mate and that's wonderful you see we we thank God for those works and I just tell you many of those sanctified people who have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb like that will find yourself in Great Tribulation and give their lives they miss a Rapture you know they're not true worshippers they're partial worshippers and God in his grace still gives them a away am through tribulation but I'm looking for the escape the Bible said we're going to escape the things that are coming on this Earth that's right because we've been accounted worthy to stand before the son of man Christ and let him judges you see God never allowed justification just just for justification he never allows sanctification just for the sake of being Sanctified those are steps that God really wants to fill you with his spirit is it's to give you it's to give you his goal is to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's what all of these things these other steps are far remember and and we're going to get to it in a minute but that's the way it was with Elijah and Elisha they would go from one place to the other to the other but the ultimate goal was to get the double portion and and you see there there's the same things that you know in in Ephesians 3:16 he talks about the depth the depth of God he said that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ might dwell in Your Heart by faith that you be rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all s what is the breath the length the depth and the height and to know the love of God which passes knowledge and that you may be filled with all the fullness of God here's the depth of God here's what God wants you to have he wants you to be able to comprehend amen who he is what he is what the truth is amen but it only comes by him dwelling in your heart that's right amen amen amen now so when a man experiences the depth of God in his life is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling in him his mind's illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word but the depth of Satan will be that he will attempt to destroy this he will always attempt to make a sa substitute for this reality of God how will he do it he'll take away the knowledge of the truth of God destroy the word putting forth his own yeah ha God said remember it's never a complete denial and then he will substitute the personal Christ in our Spirits he will do it as he caused Israel to do the same by a human being reigning as a King instead of God the Born Again experience will be rejected in favor of church joining just say I believe the message and the fruit of the depth of Satan which are lies murders and horrible crimes came from it so as we look at this and try to sum up this part of it you know you know as Believing on the Lord what one must seek God for the gift of the Holy Ghost that's a starting Place amen and and let me just say that these are all dramatic intense exciting nature changing experiences and the book of Acts it's a definite overwhelming experience with God and among Mage Believers too many times they had just grew up and they embraced the doctrine they made a profession of Faith they were baptized in water correctly but never received the Holy Spirit and if you have not the spirit of Christ you're none of his for by one Spirit you're all baptized in one body and we're made to drink of one spirit so we got Jesus Christ as a chosen place of worship His worship is not on a mountain it's not in a physical building it's not a group of people who assembl under the structure of certain doctrines the only place of worship is in Jesus Christ for that's where God chose to put his name you see you cannot offer an acceptable sacrifice an acceptable worship unless you are in in Christ Jesus for he is the only place of worship only in Christ is a Redemption for sin there is no salvation in any other name a person cannot worship correctly unless they're in that place of worship who is Jesus Christ and you get into him how do you get into him by one Spirit baptism the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are born into him into the body of Christ into that place of worship sure you going to worship God on any mountain you can stack your Stones you can make your altars you can make your Creeds and your tenants of Faith anywhere you want you can offer a prayers you can burn incense but Jesus said in vain or for nothing do they worship me their Doctrine is not the word it's the Commandments of men the real word is spirit and life the real word is spirit and truth you see Jesus is that only place so when the way a person comes into him is by one Holy Spirit if you haven't received the the gift of the Holy Ghost you are not a worshipper yet you are not in that place of worship you're still outside the gate through this baptism a person's baptized into the body of Jesus Christ and there's no other way to get into it not by Church joining not by getting baptized in water not by reciting Creeds not by professions of Faith or of any other act except by one Holy Spirit baptism that's why the holy spirit is such an important element of true worship without it you're not truly worship it you haven't entered yet there's this two elements of true worship spirit and truth you know pilate would ask the question what is truth and there's a lot of arguments about what truth is that ain't the truth this is the truth we have the truth you don't have the truth the word is truth and truth itself is Spirit and the two are in Inseparable you cannot have real truth without having the spirit you cannot have real Spirit without having the truth John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come I want you to understand truth is a person truth is not a Creed truth is a person truth is not a certain set of sermons truth is a person and that person is Jesus Christ when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth he will not speak of himself but whatever he shall hear shall he that shall he speak and he will show you all things to come John 14:16 and I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter who might how many knows who the comforter is that's the Holy Ghost is he that he may abide with you forever I like that because he doesn't come and go he abides he dwells with you you are sealed to the day of redemption you're not in and out and up and down you're solid amen your Nature has been changed you can no longer go back and eat the dung of the world anymore your your life has changed you're no longer a dung beetle you're a son or daughter of the Living God Amen that's where you find life and he said I'll give you another comforter that may abide for you forever even the spirit of Truth so the holy GH ghost is the spirit of Truth and without the spirit you don't have truth the world can even the spirit of Truth in the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you because there he was truth standing what is truth actually pilate was looking at truth John 15:26 but when the comforters come who will I send I will send to you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he will testify or bear witness of me so when you get the Holy Ghost it's going to Bear witness of Jesus now brother bam said in the a message to see Jesus I'm thankful that this Spirit of Truth was to be with us to the end the spirit of Truth is none other than the Lord Jesus himself in spiritual form he said a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you will see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and and that means tonight wherever you are we are we have the comforting words of Jesus knowing Jesus will be with us so truth is a spirit it is not a Doctrine a certain set of teachings it's not a Creed is not an academic or educational intellectual exercise and only through the spirit can you receive true Revelation now it would it will require the Holy Ghost to understand the word of God the Bible said no one can know that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost this is when you know the other times is when you heard but you will know he is the Christ when you receive the Holy Ghost amen so truth is a spirit now that's a main thing in spirit in in that's a main thing as brother Bram again says in the power of his resurrection not some fundamental Doctrine or of something or other that's all right brother but the truth without spirit is dead that's right you've got to have Spirit behind it now we go back to the earliest worshippers and there was Cain and Abel Came To Worship building an altar a place to worship at the gates of Eden and Cain would offer a worship that was unacceptable to God he came to worship and God did not honor that tells us something God does not receive all worship Abel comes and he also worships his truth and revelation of offering of lamb was recognized by God God's acceptance of his sacrifice how did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God by Faith by supern natural divine revelation he received Revelation it's the blood and Cain didn't get a revelation even though he had the Commandment so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice so but you see but through his academic human reasoning he brought the works of his hands however it was a supernatural Revelation from God that made the difference that gave Abel eternal life so both Cain and Abel offered what they called Truth and when God recognizes worship the fire falls there is Dynamics to go with the mechanics there is healings and miracles and signs and wonders somebody help me preach brother RAM and God's provided place of worship he would bring it and show the Dynamics in the mechanics and how that we would have to have both of them he said now we've had great schools of theologies nothing against it certainly not but you see when you got a School of Theology Jesus said the time is coming and now he is when God being the spirit will be Worship in spirit and in truth that that may have been a great move of God in the past but that ain't what God honors now so now people have Spirit no truth others have truth no spirit so he like he said we have two cars we have a cad both of them are Cadillacs and both of them are look alike and both of them are we fill up with gasoline and both of them you know have all of it the seats are right the steering wheels pretty it's got diamond studs it's plush it's got all of this but one of them's got the right mechanics and one of them's got mechanics and Dynamics you see you might know the mechanics he said but it takes the Dynamics to start mechanics to make them work what am I trying to tell you truth without Spirit won't work you'll never get off the ground in the Rapture unless the spirit of God is permeating the lives of the people and making the word to work Hallelujah that Cadillac's got to drive down to Healing to miracles to signs to wonders it's got to drive to the body change to rapture amen amen oh he said what's the matter with the church today we're full of theology without Dynamics in it I say God help us not to repeat that amen he said I think what's the matter with the church today we're lacking the dynamical power to press this word and make it live for this day amen you know I want you to say I I don't believe we're lacking word I think we got plenty of word amen but there's got to be a spark there's got to be the life of the spirit that makes that word work and brother B said Luther had mechanics and Dynamics for his day he would make he would make that just shall live by faith work Wesley had it on his day Pentecost had it with their day what about our day I'm reading this is another time the church should be fully grown now ready to meet Christ with the manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the Bible operating in that one great body where he promised that he would meet the people and be worshiped in this great church of his so notice what he says we now what about our age we can talk about Pentecost oh they were moved oh we can talk about Wesley oh they fainted under the power we can talk about Luther you know all of these things but here what about our day this is another time I'm repeating that the church should be fully grown now we ought to be a mature group amen ready to go to meet Christ with the manifestation of Every Blessing amen of Every Blessing we we're not just trying to emphasize one part and not the other we want all the word to work amen every promise in the book is mine M Hallelujah every blessing is mine amen oh brother Jim we we don't want it to blow out the whistle well I do I wanted to shout the glories of God I want to give praise to his name but I wanted to do more than that I want it to run down the track I want to hear it as it runs down Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and it drives me right down to Healing to Deliverance to the baptism of the Hool go that's what I want to see Hallelujah I want to see deliver young people I want to just deliver the old I want to see it spark fa in the hearts and lives of men and women I want to see the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost make that train move down the road blow it out the whistle say glory to God but let's put it in the gear let's move on to let's see God in his work we're fully grown now ready to go meet Christ with the very manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the Bible Hallelujah Cain's worship is a powerless religion Cain's worship requires psychology man's efforts to adjust sinful nature impulses Abel's worship brings death to self where you die with your sacrifice on the altar amen and the life of God comeing down replacing sin nature amen I I don't care what experience you had if it didn't replace sin nature it's not much value if it didn't change your life if it didn't make you into a son or daughter of God if it only reformed you for a time but didn't restore you back to the original thought that God had in his mind of a people you see Cain's worship will give you a new face and the pretense of a good heart with sin nature still Abiding and then things don't go your way you kill your brother that's Abel's worship will give you a new heart and a soul that's free and clean of sin nature brother brandham says in the message this is 1961 mark of the beast you got a soul in there that's worth 10,000 worlds so he said you let the devil cram anything down into it and call it righteousness and religion instead of taking God's right way about it that's right your soul is worth 10,000 worlds your own body is worth only 84 Cent you drag it around sure make sure take care of it or you shave it up and you fix it upright might dress it up but that's so you sure won't dress that just let anything drag into that you wants to give you a spider in that you'd sue the restaurant that gave it to you but a church can tell you shake hands with the Pastor say you believe in God worship that's all you have to do if that's right then kanaine was right but remember God said to Cain worship like your brother and you'll do well that's all I want I want you to be able to worship like they did in the book of Acts like they did in the upper room I want you to be able to worship like that I see what God accepted I want you to be able to worship like that in spirit and in truth but he says Cain didn't want that he didn't want to do it that's the way it is today they don't want to worship God in spirit and Truth they want to go to church and worship the way the church says worship worship What God Says worship Jesus said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth that's right put them together the word and the spirit together and if the spirit is in the word the word will manifest itself amen and he said that's exactly the reason you see discernments and healings and things it's the word made manifest now you see you know you want to keep a bird in prison unable to fly you don't just clip either way it don't matter if it's the right one or the left one a bird unbalanced is unable to fly amen so clip either one you know you you can you some will clip the truth and don't have it they only have part of it and a little bit enough of it you can just flop around in a circle maybe they got a lot of Spirit and the other will have will will have truth and let that grow out but they'll clip the wings of the spirit it takes two wings to fly there's two elements to the worship it's you see it's supernatural two wings to fly they they're not clipped with them we can fly in the heavenlies and we can get Supernatural Revelation it's a place where all things are possible amen when you see a church when you see a person with unclipped wings they can soar into the Realms of the supernatural amen they can see by the spirit of Revelation the end that has coming into this world and know that he's made a way of Escape what is our way of Escape we are eagles amen a eagle don't have to worry about crossing the river he flies right over it we are a people that will fly right over death into the arms of our beloved amen but you have to do that with two wings and must be balanced you want to keep a bird pin clip a wing combining human reasoning and quotes of Truth together without considering the whole matter can clip Wings you stack them up and make you a mount gism make make you a you stack them up make your Mountain I here's where it's got to be if your Scholastic conclusion caus you to teach Mercy is over then there will be no burden for the Lost no altar call given come on that may be built on parts of truth but the spirit of it is wrong the real spirit is is Lord I don't want to see nobody lost so I sure ain't going to try to close the door of Mercy amen some guy told me you know one time he said now I'll tell you what brother Tim he said I had a personal revelation I said you did yeah he said I had a revelation you know brother Bram talked about a time in souls in prison now you know there be a time without Mercy well it wasn't then but in the year 2000 in the year 2000 God revealed to me this is a pastor of 300 people two 300 God revealed to me that Mercy now over I said oh he did I said why would you want to believe that I said don't you realize what that would do I would damn your children damn your grandchildren it damn people that was out don't you realize what that does that kind of Doctrine does that kind of teaching don't you realize oh oh no no everybody I love and that loves me is going to be there so in other words if they love me I can get them in so now salvation comes in a man and you know what I said I said oh you know what I'm going to do glory to God I'm going to start loving everybody I'm going to love everybody I see and I'm going to tell them Jesus saved Jesus is deliver I'm going to let them know there's still a baptism of the Holy Ghost there's the power of God in the Salvation I'm going to love him that much so I just I'm just going to love more than what I ever did cuz I want everybody to make it if your academic knowledge cause you to believe days of Miracles are passed it was only for the Divine Healing movement so only for brother brandham there will be no faith when we pray for the sick this turns us into a powerless group of people whose only weapon is argument now let me just tell you about this message this message of Truth began in the spirit right how can you end without the spirit if it began with the spirit how can you end without it the mysteries of God that we hold dear of seven Thunders utter their voices revealing things other ages didn't know of the church ages of the mysteries of God of of of of understanding that we have had in this day these mystery did not come by academic scholar Scholastic learning it came by the Supernatural That's right so how then can we accept it today as just being a fleshly intellectual gospel I'll tell you what that is that is a bewitching spirit turn with me to Galatians 3 and verse one oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth you see it's a bewitching spirit it's a spirit of divination it's not the holy ghost at all it's leading you to different conclusions amen listen listen who has Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you only this only what I learn of you I want to know this did you receive the Spirit by The Works of the Lord law or by the hearing of Faith are you so foolish having begun the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if yet be in vain he that ministered to you the spirit and worth Miracle among you do he by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith so here again how can you say how can you begin with the spirit and then end without it you we begun in this Spirit we begun with the supernatural this message is the most Supernatural message that has ever been given since the restoration amen the restoration all the way back to the first church it is the most Supernatural message was was that message Supernatural back there Jesus born of a virgin Supernatural amen raised from the dead Supernatural ascended in Glory Supernatural Holy Ghost set back Supernatural was it a supernatural gospel then amen then there got to be a supernatural in the end time if it began if the gospel began with a supernatural it has to end with the supernatural how in the world you think by the flesh or by our thinking or by our rationale are we going to change our body the change of our body will come by a supernatural sweep of the Holy Ghost a dynic infilling of the spirit of God it will not come by the reasoning and the intellect of man or figuring out or stacking our quotes it'll come by the moving of the Holy Ghost we have received the word and it's in full effect I say it's in full effect it will heal it will save it will deliver amen it will Rapture it'll change your body it will deliver you I don't care how long you've been in sin I don't care the habits that you had I don't care how long you've been a slave amen it comes in full effect the word we have received is in full effect it's denominations that are ceasing we're not ceasing no we have been pled in the full effect in the full effect this message began with an angel preaching the gap between the natural and the supernatural when he broke through the Realms of of the supernatural in the form of a sual of Supernatural life a light I don't care how ridiculous it may seem how foreign it is to the intellect there is another realm and it's where God dwells we know the realm of demons it's manifesting people on the Earth but there's also a people manifesting the realm of Heaven the perfect love that is there has come into their heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they have that basic element of God and I just say release it release it Let It Go amen allow the spirit to work allow it to bring forgiveness to bring pardon cause you to love one another standing was it a cave was it a room a cabin I don't really care probably happened in both places multiple incidences where a light comes in where light comes in two feet come out of that light then legs then a body then a man six foot tall from that other realm from the supernatural God still sends things supernaturally I defy that spirit that says he doesn't in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh my sons and my daughters shall prophesy that's from that realm that's supernaturally my sons and daughter they will see old men will dream dreams young men will see Vision that's Supernatural and out of that form of the supernatural light stepped a man started with the supernatural it will end with a supernatural with a light coming for you to step into Hallelujah Hallelujah with a light coming from you and out of that light will step your theophany body you look and said that's me you'll take a step toward it and it'll step toward you and you will Embrace each other and you'll become one and chain in a moment in a twinkle it began with the supernatural it will end with the [Applause] supernatural the ministry of Elijah began with super natural it ended with a charot of fire Supernatural Elis began with the supernatural it ended with the supernatural the resurrection of a man throat on his bones yes sir all the way through Jesus life was Supernatural it began in the Supernatural it ended in the Supernatural what am I trying to tell you friends I'm telling you God did not bring this in word only but in power in much Assurance amen it will not end without power we must have that power it is that Holy Ghost Power amen amen I think about brother brandham as he stood there after the angel came to him and he would Shock the World by ripping the thin veil between science and the Supernatural and his ministry didn't Bless but in many instan it it actually terrified there standing in Los Angeles is account of a man with cancer he stands in the line for hours waiting for his turn and he Witnesses every kind of healing imaginable so now he knows it can be done however when his his time for prayer the Evangelist says no I won't pray for you well he was angry he demanded to know why brother brandham said you don't want me to tell you and he demanded angrily refused to leave I'm not leaving here I've come I waited in my turn and I'm now I demand an answer said you're sleeping with your secretary with that is the man dropped his head and rushed out of the meeting this happened over and again brother brandham was the answer to the desperate prayer and the act of the love of God in the Pentecostal meeting movement was now fragmented infighting dying because of immorality and because of infight it had fallen into disrepute many other meetings was just fraught with emotionalism and charlatans whipped up the audience into frenzies and and and most healing testimonies were sketchy at least things were bad outside the church it was a time when America was in the grip of Fear of a nuclear war oh we're closer now than we ever was thing about it is psychiatry was replacing Faith whole generation was racing away from God as it continued to do today preachers were at loss as to what to do about it and in that moment in that moment in a time of 1946 enters William brandom onto the stage his atmosphere was all together different he didn't come out with the Fanfare of or Roberts who would come out of his tent from a little box in the back and he comes tring out with his Bible being pronounced as the man of the hour oh Roberts he didn't come out as AA Allen often times drunk with the excess of alcohol he came out totally different without Showmanship or fanfare made no attempt to manipulate the people but when he tells the audience he's here the angel of Lord is present that would be a statement so posos so stunning so yet it was then that astounding things started to happen Miracle after Miracle all Roberts would testify of them and these are public documentations that you can find said there was no hard cases for brother Bram while he was enveloped with the by the anointing growth vanished limbless limbs lifeless limbs awaken and blind eyes open what was we seeing we were seeing an Elijah Ministry stepping forth not to bring another Reformation that's why he never joined one of the their churches he wasn't sent to reform them that's right amen he was sent for the purpose of restoration and there's a huge difference between Reformation we've had re reforms down to The Times They reformed the Catholic church and produced Lutheran they reformed the Lutheran and produced Wesley and they all one who is reforming this and reforming that and adjusting this Doctrine and that and make all of their Mount gism but God wasn't interested in reforming and remaking and may taking one of them and making it the Great Mighty place of worship because that was never God's place of worship His place of worship was in Christ Jesus so a restoration was beginning the Pentecostals didn't want to accept him as having the Elijah anointing because they only wanted to reform and grow their denomination that was their goal it was never an interest of them to be a restoration but a reformation and yet the prophecy said as John the Baptist and and you know it was said again and again even by theusa Pentecostals themselves they would speak in tongues and brother bradam could come and stood at hou Houston Texas Man rises up he's dressed like a cowboy he rises up and he speaks in a tongues and another guy you jumps up and he he interprets it and his interpretation is as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ you're sent with a message to forun the second coming it would be asked do you know each other no we've never met you spoke tell you and do you know no we don't know have you ever met this man never heard of him till today and I come to this meeting and hear the spirit of God spoke what was he saying that there was a way to be prepared for the Messiah amen and we can say it this way but not just for the total fulfillment of the coming of Christ but the word to be restored Christ the word the truth to come back it would be a restoration not a Reformation he would not be the creating of another Harlot daughter that's never been his intentions God's intentions is to get a bride a spotless bride time after time this would happen an aater who was in the meetings that I was in as a boy there and her name was known all through the Pentecostal circles she had the same prophecy stood up in the meetings and prophesied as John the Baptist stood right there Tommy Osburn he said it in his witness he said I heard it deep down within my soul as I sat and listened to brother brandham in those first Services there in in 19467 and he said I heard it down deep in my soul it was a voice resonating with my bosom as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ I want you to know this message came Vindicated by the supernatural God himself that's right amen and he and he and so you say well you know they would later say well that was his fault that's why he died he made himself Elijah they said he was Elijah that's right their prophecy said he was Elijah they said how do you say that they said he was John the Baptist because Luke 1:17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias this is John the Baptist to turn the hearts of the father their children to Disobedience uh to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord that's what God has done in this generation Hallelujah all we need to do is look at Elijah and realize as a prophecy what we must do he turned and rebuilt the place of worship and gathered the stones that had been scattered the Loose Ends that had been left out and abandoned truth that had been neglected and built an altar and laid Jesus Christ the sacrifice as the focal point Hallelujah are you with me and what happened the fire fell how did we know how did they know how do they know that God had answered fire fell that's how do we know God answered in this day fire fell amen sign after sign and wonder after wonder and it was never wrong never wrong never wrong it showed it was the spirit of Truth the stones must be in altar be in order the altar rebuilt we must preach a Bible Jesus a Bible Holiness and a Bible Doctrine but I want you to understand when the fire fell it consumed all the stones it did not leave a place in Jeffersonville for everybody to worship it didn't leave a place in Tucson it didn't leave an altar here or there it consumed it all and all was left was the fire Hallelujah there it is that's where our place of worship is is where he is where he is where the fire is that's our place of worship hallelujah amen God did not leave us a bunch of things there for us just to fuss and fight over but for us to see one thing the fire is here the Holy Ghost is here and that light is here to take a pride in a Rapture hallelujah amen this is his [Applause] promise this morning in the we hours of the morning I was awakened by the Holy Spirit and he brought me to this place right here of Elisha standing at the River School of prophets were there watching they're scoffing ridicule wondering doubting that God was with the Elisha I wouldn't have time to go into it maybe it'll be subject for another day I have probably another as long a time to spend on Elijah and Elisha and following them taking them through the steps of their Journey from Dothan to the school of the prophets to the Jordan brother brandham types it with justification and sanctification Aus a movement and they said then into the supernatural into the new land and I just want to say as I waken this morning I awakened and I thought what is the end of all of this where does it all come down to and Elijah of course would tell Elisha if you see me go away that's the only way you're going to get the double portion and you see it was in Jesus going away that he sent back the double portion which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost which allows the church to do the Greater Works or have the double portion now I thought how did it all end up it all ended up with a chariot of fire horses of fire something breaking from The Immortal realms coming into this Dimension and Elijah stepped into that Whirlwind and went up I want you to know I want you to know the charot fixtion to come for us this time it will be Jesus and we will meet him in the air and we will step into the realm of where he is and be chased in a moment and a twinkling of an eye true worship is not in a place true worships in a man Christ Jesus and he is the spirit and if I can get you in the spirit with the truth that you have you will have true worship and the fire will come down and consume your sacrifice answer your prayer and deliver you that's his promise it is the hour of true worship other worships are counted over with but we have entered into worship Hallelujah and as we stand this this time that's right as we stand this time it will not be Elijah going up but it'll be the Elisha given the double portion who will go up chain from Mortal to immortality friends don't stay at these other places they might be great things of justification where you receive pardon for your sin they may be great works of sanctification where you got cleansed of habits you might get it on your spirit and you shouting down the aisle but oh enter into true worship through a real baptism of the Holy Ghost changes your nature and makes you a son or daughter of God will you just say today Lord help me to enter into true worship I want to worship you in spirit and in truth Come Holy Spirit Come Holy Spirit I need you come in thine own special way wherever you at don't stay there enter in till your worship becomes true there's somebody in this day has got to have such devotion and sincerity such honesty of truly believing the word that they bind the serpent at om Mamba of death [Music] that power has been given to the church somebody will bind it release that power that's in you if you've been born again by the spirit of God you've been filled with the Holy Ghost that power is in you release it release it Let it Loose amen if you've been in prison a long a long time and Shackled I hope it's been that
