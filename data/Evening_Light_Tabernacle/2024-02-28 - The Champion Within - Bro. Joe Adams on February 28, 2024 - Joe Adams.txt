your people we need a God to intercede on our behalf intercede for for our sickness intercede for the troubles and the trials we Face father we're so thankful that we serve a living God and Lord I just ask tonight God you'll anoint the lips of clay to speak Words of Life Lord you'll anoint the ears of man to hear what the spirit would say tonight God we just yield ourselves both speaker and hearer Lord for your service to Lord just to hear from the Great Mighty God that you are unchangeable God Unstoppable God lord What a Mighty God you are we bless your name tonight father may you just have the preeminence in this service but we ask it in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles would look here in Romans 8 verse 31 as you're turning there just just wanted to greet you it's been a while since we've been here want to say thank you for your prayers for our families we was in Arizona for the funeral of sister Rachel's Brother David Jessica's Uncle we're we traveled 3600 miles round trip we actually went by Flagstaff and preached for brother Dell Smith uh Wednesday and Sunday and had tremendous Services there but you know it's nothing like being at home so y'all may want to get a picture of the four of us cuz this is this hadn't happened in quite some time probably since the first of the year so but we're glad to be back together I'm honored to serve the Lord with such Mighty Men of Valor and and to be among a church that believes the Full Gospel we look here tonight Romans 8:31 it says what shall we say to these things if God be for us then who can be against us he that spare not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect but it is God that justify who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession ession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ notice here Paul's bringing some distinct things to our attention who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution all right Church come on this is not just the the ministers this is all of us our famine our nakedness our Peril our sword as it is written for thy sakes we are killed all the day long we are accounted sheep for the slaughter but nay in all these things we are more than conquered through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor power nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord God bless you you can have your seats tonight want to look back here Romans 8:31 it says what shall we say to these things if God be for us then who can be against it who can come against us is God is is God if God is for us who can injure us who can destroy us notice all demonic powers of Hell may be against us tonight but the power they don't have the power to destroy us nor do they have the power to take away the blessings of God from us for what if God be for us then who can be against us God is more Mighty than all our foes he will defend us and he will save us the Bible tells us in Psalm 118 and verse 6 the Lord is on my side somebody needs to hear this tonight the Lord is on my side and I will not fear what man do unto me notice then he comes down in verse 35 who shall separate us and he goes into great detail tribulation or pressure from without Affliction arising from external sources or distress great anxiety and distress of Mind such as arises when man does not know where to turn himself or what to find uh to find relief excuse me or persecutions or famine because they were driven from their homes and yet we find what could Peril he said in Peril there is danger of any sort or danger of any kind or even the sword of persec should notice in all these things Paul says nay nay otherwise however otherwise but in all these things notice Paul is bringing it down no matter what you are facing no matter the situation no matter the trial or the sickness or the heartache or the despair or the anxiety or the fear or the loneliness in all these things now he's making it Global all these things we are notice Paul is making it personal not we will be not we were but we are present tense tonight we are what we are more not less than but we're more than come on somebody he's telling us and Paul is tell us that's the attitude in which we must take when we Face challenges Paul is making it personal it can't be just your neighbor these Great Men of God it can't be just a minister it can't be just a deacons but it's got be me I am tonight no matter how small I am no matter how young I am no matter how old I am how new to the faith I I am tonight more than more than what brother Joe more than a conqueror so Noti this Paul is placing it in our thoughts that we are not less than able but we're more than able amen Deuteronomy 28:13 says and the Lord shall make Thee the head and not the tail come on somebody the head and not the tail Thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath notice we are blessed and highly favored of Our Lord we are the ones that are going up not down that's right and he tells us notice we're more more than conquerors that word conquer there is one who is Victorious it means to overpower in Victory it means to be a abundantly Victorious somebody needs to be listening not one Victory but we go from Victory to Victory to Victory to Victory abundantly Victorious we are more notice we're not just conquerors but Paul is telling us we are more than just conquerors we're more than able we're more Victorious no matter what what we're facing we are the Victor tonight we Prevail mightily we overpower in Victory we gain look our trials are they may be sent to destroy you but your trials doesn't destroy you but it only makes the victory better we gain through every trial we gain the victory our trials our difficulties our hardships look they have no power to sedo us tonight they don't have the power to take from you tonight the love of almighty god notice but through the trial through the situation Paul is telling us that that situation that God has brought you into will make you more than a conqueror tonight you'll be more [Applause] Victorious and notice where does it come from through him it says through him see all of our abundant victories they come through Christ they come from Christ they come through Christ and they're in Christ so he makes us more than conquerors see it's through Christ that we Prevail mightily it's through Christ that we have overpower overpowering Victory Zechariah 4 and verse 6 says then he answered and he spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of host we overcome by the spirit of God not by brute force not by Humanity not by big strapping muscles not by how intellectual you are but we overcome and we're more than conquerors notice through Christ and it's through Christ that we have the power to subdue we find in Philippians 4 and verse 13 he says I can how many of you can say that tonight I can what I can do all things not some things not the things that I'm just you know maybe I'm skilled to do but he says I can do all things tonight through Christ which strengthen me otherwise you can believe when nobody else will believe you can remain steadfast when people are falling away and drifting away you can remain why cuz I can do all things tonight Paul again is making it a personal a personal Vindication or or a personal invitation he's showing us that we as a Believer can do all things we can subdue Nations tonight we can subdue demonic forces tonight through Jesus Christ Our Lord notice it's through him that loved us so it's it all comes down to love and his love for us and because he loves us we are what we are tonight because he loves us we will not fail because he loves us we are victorious because he loved us he sent Christ to die in your stead because he loved us he went to hell so we wouldn't have to go because he loved us he sent you a message because he loved us he sent you the seventh angel because he loved you he brought you to this church because God loves you and the Bible says that yeah in all these things we are tonight not just even like Tabernacle but the bride around the world are more than conquers through him because he loved us and his love has made us What We Are Tonight It's Made Us Victorious when all hell is against us well brother Joe what are you preaching on I'm preaching on the champion within the champion within notice this word Champion is a person who has defeated or surpassed all rivals this man ain't never been beat this man doesn't know the word defeat he doesn't know what it means to be a loser we're talking about a champion and the the brother B would tell us in the the greatest battle ever fought he says we got a festar general spelled j s u s placing five stars on us F AI t h he never lost a battle Hallelujah he conquered death hell and the grave get the Devils out of the way he's the great Chief Captain so the devil isn't even in the picture and some of you were worried about cancer when the devil ain't even in the picture tonight because our chief Captain doesn't know the word defeat why could R spiter be standing 4 years after giving four months because the chief Captain is still the champion tonight he's Ron Spencer's Champion he's our champion Jesus Christ is our champion notice now he's The Undefeated champion of sickness how many you've been healed by him you're a testimony that he he still undefeated notice he's The Undefeated champion of cancer how many of you've overcome cancer we have several cancer survivors here tonight see he's still he's undefeated champion of Sorrows how many you've lost a loved one but yet you're here because the chief Captain the champion sir he's the champion of Heartache he's The Undefeated champion of Love see he's our champion he's defeated all all of our Rivals I like that he's defeated all of our Rivals whether it be anxiety whether it be fear whether it be depression whether it be pornography whether it be Financial struggles no matter what it may be he has already defeated that and the Bible say he's made you more than a conqueror tonight he's the champion but he's come and what has he done he has given us his holy ghost the token that we heard about Sunday and that Holy Ghost is on display to do what to make you a champion to make you a warrior to make you somebody that'll stand steadfast when everybody falls away you'll still stand and having done all the stand you're standing there for cuz you're standing for the truth of god notice now brother man will tell us like this he said then Satan can't stand that notice because he's a defeated being right oh he's a defeated being not going to be defeated he's already defeated brother Johnny he's nothing but a bluff well I sure wish you could remind me that when I'm in my trial I'm reminding you tonight he's nothing but a bluff Jesus Paid the price called us by his grace we're an air what a perfect setup that is wo he's already defeated I never defeated him Christ defeated him I'm just claiming my god-given privileges oh Hallelujah notice he tells us in John 16 and verse 7 nevertheless I'll tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away then the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you so here we have a prophecy or we have a promise that God is going to send us a comforter he's going to send us the Holy Ghost because what he is he wants us to be so he's the champion and he's looking for other Champions to come on the scene notice we find here in John 14 and verse 16 and I will pray that the father and he shall give un he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you you then he goes on to say I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you so Jesus is our champion and he sent his Spirit to come and live inside each and every one of us so that we too could be Champions so now I'm going to dive in a little bit tonight and I want to kind of bring some of this thought to you tonight what does it mean to be a champion I don't want this to be mind over matter but I want to I want you to look at it from the eyes of a holy ghost filed believer tonight cuz we received his Spirit how many of you got the spirit of God you got the token on display tonight just wave your token before him in prayer notice so what does it mean to be a champion Jack Dempsey he was a legendary boxer once said a champion is someone who gets up when he can't someone who gets up when he can't I'm looking at a whole lot of Champions in the room tonight cuz some of you didn't want to be here but you're here some of you got knocked down but you got back up some of you the devil says I'm going to take them out but you're here tonight that's proof that there's a champion on the inside there some of you have taken major blows and major struggles but yet you're still here pressing the battle so being a champion is knowing what your limits are and pushing past them man I I can tell you that takes a holy field believer to recognize your limitations and then push Beyond them there was a man by the name of Louis amorini brother Aaron and I are very familiar with this man not because we ever met him but because we are historians we like to read about World War II this was an Olympic champion this man at 18 years old Ran the 1930 uh 1936 Berlin games and he met Adolf Hitler but after the the uh he ran the fastest mile if I'm not mistaken at that time the last lap so he ran the fastest lap in Olympian history at that time on the fourth lap but he got sent to the war and his plane was down he FL he flew a B24 and his plane was down and he he he drifted 47 days Out on the Ocean eating birds that would land they would take them and they would eat them and then rainwater catching them from the sky him and two other guys and then when he finally was rescued by the Japanese he suffered disease exposure starvation nearly daily beatings from guards and he was sent to one camp and there was a prison guard by the name of bird the bird they called him the bird and he took particular Glee in torching this Runner and one point he told him he had him hold a a large wooden beam across his shoulders and he threatened him he says if you drop it I'll kill you this is recognizing your limitations but your life was on the line and he realized no matter what he did he had to remain St de fast he had to push past his weaknesses he had to push past how he felt and he had to push past the resistance he had to push past the pain and that they said miraculously he held that beam over his head for 37 minutes until finally the bird finally hit him and beat him and knocked them unconscious so being a champion is recognizing your limits but you got to be willing to press on recognizing your trial that that trial didn't come from God but is sent to to Spur You On To Be A Champion see a champion means to be to Bear unyielding courage which creates confidence many of us are familiar with John Wayne being that I was just out in the west man it just reminded me I saw John Wayne everywhere I went every man had a belt buckle and a cow boy had I'm like man this is John Wayne Heaven out here but John Wayne made the statement couraging is being scared to death but saddling up anyway and that's what God is looking for he didn't say it was going to be a flower better EAS and Leo DEA but he said you got to have courage I'm looking for Champions I'm looking for people you may be scared to death but you get in and you get on with it anyway because why because you're not living by your spirit you're living by his spirit and he sent forth the great Champion the champion of love to come and live inside of you to Spur you on to Good Works notice being a champion is not giving into your fears but recognizing your fears and moving forward how many of you have fears here tonight we all have some sort of fear that's just human nature but it's recognizing them and then moving past them moving forward not letting your fears hinder your faith notice it means to develop the habit of recognizing and responding to any any shred of positivity you know there's so much negative in the world today and it's so easy our human nature just grabs hold to the negative but notice we find there's Wars there's rumors of wars there's uh there's Russia and what Russia's doing there's political chaos there's social economic struggles there's crime there's people coming across the border in massive numbers and yet but being a champion is not focused on all these negative things but it's focused in on one thing it's Focus focusing on that which is positive and building upon that and remaining upon that it's harnessing your skills and talents and putting them to the work for the Lord being a champion it means calling those things that are not as though they are so what does it mean brother Joe to be a champion of a Believer what is what are we to look for so being a champion doesn't mean that you'll always be in perect perfect health that's right all right but being a champion means you're going to believe for it being a champion means you going to put that well body in front of you and you're going to take step day after day after day you're going to walk toward that body until finally that body obeys your confession and you're living and you're manifesting in a well body you don't give up just because you got a bad doctor's report you come back to the word of God back to your absolute back to your toost and this is what the word of God Says by his stripes I am healed today and a champion doesn't look at the doctor's report it doesn't look at his Affliction it looks to the Word of Promise and said I'm going to believe only that no being a champion means that doesn't mean that you'll always be in wealth that you'll never be in need of w but it means that you trust him to supply your every need David would tell us I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread you may not know where that next meal's coming from but he knows you may not know how that bill is going to get paid but he knows and what he's trying to tell you tonight is you're not focused on all you're not caught up and apprehensive about that you're trusting you're trusting that he's going to make a way when there seems to be no way notice being a champion doesn't mean everything will always go your way all right new flash I know some of y'all are immediately disappointed right you mean really no it doesn't mean that you'll always feel him near it doesn't mean you're going to come to every service and it's going to be a spectacular meeting but it means that you come and because you believe that where two or three are gathered in his name he's promised to be there you may not feel him you may not see him but he's there nevertheless cuz he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you so we put our faith in the word of God not in our feelings not in what we see not in what we taste not in what we hear not in how we feel our faith anchors in the Rock of Ages tonight and we look past everything that we see taste smell and fear it's in him and him alone so many times Champions if you do any kind of study in athletics and things like that many times Champions are isolated people they're not the mass there there are the few see but you know in your harder hearts that he's going to never leave you as a young person you know in your heart of hearts in that deepest struggle in that great trial of Affliction he's there no matter what he is there because you have a word that declares he's there because you have a champion on the inside that declares he's there because the Holy Ghost is declaring that he's there so being a champion means that you push past to hardships and you keep your eyes fixed on the prize some of you got children here that are waver tonight to be a champion parent you're not picking out their flaws that new tattoo that they got or that new bobbed hair or whatever else it may be you're not looking at the you know the new boyfriend or the new girlfriend or whatever it may be you're looking at the Word of Promise said I got a promise for my prodal and I think about that prodical you know brother Brandon when he preached a prodical message he only preached it one time and he said the angel of the Lord came there and and tapped that young boy and said it's time to get up you've been here long enough that's right why because there was a dad there was a mother back home praying they didn't know where he went they didn't know how far he's gone but they were praying nevertheless they weren worried about the reports that they heard some need to turn your eyes away from the report and start turn believe in God's report tonight and he said that they and their offspring shall be there and be a champion of a parent tonight be a champion of Faith tonight believe it when nobody will believe with you trust him when nobody will trust with you I'm going to have my son I'm going to have my daughter I'm going to have my wife I'm going to have my husband I'm going to have one because the word says it I'm going to be a champion and I want you to know tonight the champion is already there he's already on the inside and he's wanting you to believe for it tonight Paul will tell us in Philippians 3 and: 13 so you got to keep your eyes on the prize he was Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I wish you could see this the way I got it highlighted in my my iPad Paul ain't looking at all the other things he's got his mind focused on one thing tonight notice what he says this one thing forgetting those things which are behind oh bless God some of you need to grab that right there and take hold of it grab ho quit looking at your failures quit looking at your mistakes quit looking at your defeats quit looking at all that quit looking at the things that are behind you and look to what look to the future look to the promise tonight he says forgetting those things that which are behind reaching forth unto the things that which are before oh I love that yes sir notice this one thing Paul had one great aim one purpose in life he didn't attempt to mingle the world in religion and the game both no he was single-minded he didn't seek to attain wealth and salvation too he didn't seek to retain honor here and the Crown of Glory Hereafter he had one object one aim one great purpose of his soul and I'm talking of more champ iions tonight you ain't worried about how high you can reach in that career or what you can be on the job some of you may be called to walk away from it to be a champion of Faith tonight but I want you to know you got one aim you got one purpose tonight and that's to make a Rapture that's to change this Dimension and step into a Heavenly [Applause] Dimension and Paul would tell us forgetting those things that which are behind you know he wasn't looking over his shoulder looking at how far he's come and who's running behind him or who's lingered who fell away no he kept his eyes steadfast keep your eyes looking forward Church don't be looking at what this church is doing and what that church is doing and what that sister's doing and what that brother's doing keep your eyes looking forward notice his attention wasn't diverted from this one and that one and everything else no but his attention was looking onward to the prize see he fixed his eyes intently on the goal he would tell us in verse 14 I press that word press there means to pursue in a hostile manner you know not everybody here tonight is going to be a Joe Adams you may not be a Tim pro excuse me brother Tim but we have strong constitution of faith not everybody's going to have that some of you going to have a different disposition and a different demeanor but yet Paul is telling us I press so no matter what your outcome no matter what your nature you can press tonight you can press with a hostile manner knowing that you're seeking eagerly for and earnestly endeavoring to acquire to acquire what brother the mark the goal of what the prize which is the reward oh church tonight the prize of a Believer is not this world but it's a Rapture it's a body change it's a marriage supper it's an eternal rain I'm pressing tonight I'm pressing with eagerness with determination to the mark the goal of the pr of having a body change that's what I'm pressing to I'm not getting caught up in all the the things of the world and and family struggles and strains and whatever else I press it toward the Mark I got one aim one goal I got to make a Rapture I got to make a Rapture he's pressing toward the high call and notice a life of honor and Glory the High Calling to a crown that's bright and imperishable the High Calling High not down and you've already been seen in a vision going up not down in defeat what is he saying oh Church you can't lose you're a champion so being a champion being a champion takes focus and determination as a young boy being a champion means you may have to go at it alone think about brother Andrew GL brother Andrew tner when he was a young boy growing up in this church and theu the influence that he was in but in a youth service in an unexpected place at an unexpected time somebody was casting a net at the young man behind him and he got all caught up in it and he still caught up in it I said that's the best catch Joe Adams has ever made what a blessing to the evening light Tabernacle that he has been to our church but yet he had to make a determination do I continue to go with my friends do I continue to drift off and skateboard and smoke and drink and do all that or do I finally surrender and be what God's called me to be and you see him here now he's married with a young baby and he's a great musician a great blessing to our church why because he made a decision that I'm going to be a champion a champion of the faith a champion for young people that God can and God will and God will do it again church he can do it tonight for you if you'll just believe and let go and let God have his way you don't have to keep walking down that lonely road to defeat no God has already seen you rising to victory [Applause] tonight notice so being a champion takes hard work takes dedication perseverance makes means you got to make sacrifices that right brother Andrew got to make some sacrifices but you find out they really wasn't sacrifices at all not at all so how many of you have ever played Sports and I know there's not going to be many hands here praise God but when I was in high school junior high I played Sports I I love football I took all my anger and aggression out out there on the field I was I was little fat and the guy next to me was big fat how about that for a nickname little fat and big fat I was 220 5 foot 6 he was 6'4 320 lbs we knew what it meant to open up a hole but I had a hunger I want to make it to the professional level you ain't never seen a 5 foot6 Pro lineman you may have seen a running back but you ain't never seen no Pro lman 5'6 220 I get manhandled out there so you just think they said I I drew some stats up and it t a little research and it says becoming a professional athlete it certainly ain't easy the chances of a going pro aren't in your favor I don't want to bust no bubbles tonight but the 1% of the top 1% achieve it that's not big numbers there are one 1,932 34 High School football players in in the United States and of that 1 million 93,9 34 only 71,000 make it to College you do the math those are not big numbers now let's said take for instance the DAR ball from college to the pros is even more dramatic only 1.2% of college level players will get drafted in the NFL so up the 1, 93,7 34 High School football players only 853 players .75 make it to the pros each year being a champion is not for everybody but it's for you tonight but it's for you tonight see it's only for those that are willing to push past their limits it's for those that's willing to push past complexes push past family strength it's only for those that are willing to break Cycles cycle Breakers in the house of God tonight those that refuse to let the legacy of the feet continue to dictate their life think about that Champions well this one said you're never going to amount to nothing this one said you're never going to be are you better than us you no I'm better than that come on I ain't saying I'm better than you but I'm better than that I'm better than going down in De feat I'm better than drugs I'm better than alcohol I'm better than pornography I'm better than deceit I'm better than just being a denominational Christian I'm better than that why because I'm a champion and I got Champion pedigree all on the inside not by my doing but by his doing Church somebody's got to make that determination we're going not going to live like that anymore we're going to break the cycles and be better than [Applause] that you got to work harder you got to make more sacrifices why because somebody is there to Dethrone you Satan is determined to defeat you to destroy you you know but to be a champion means you got to be strong now I'm not talking about Johnny brother Johnny strong good Lord I wish I look like that when I get his age big old muscles big old traps oh man I never had traps probably CU they' be a trap but not big muscles but strong in the faith notice it reminds me of a character in The Bible my my my time's getting away but notice Romans 4 4:18 talking about Abraham he was a champion Abraham was considered the father of our faith and yet against hope he believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb in one place I just listening to yesterday Abraham's Grace Covenant brother Brown say she was Barren and he was sterile and he looked past the barren womb he looked past the condition he looked past her her barness and he looked past his own sterilization and he looked at the word of God and he called those things that were not as though they were Church notice the Bible says he stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but he was strong in the faith giving Glory glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform so the word stagger there means to withdraw from so Abraham didn't withdraw from believing the promise after the first year when he didn't see anything he didn't withdraw the fifth year when he didn't see anything he didn't withdraw from the from believing the 10th year or the 15th year or the 20th year or the 25th year here he believed despite what he didn't see and the Bible says he was strong he was bold he was determined to stay with the promise because he was persuaded notice church he was fully persuaded it's one thing brother Aaron to be persuaded but it's an absolutely another thing to be fully persuaded you know you know beyond the shadow of a doubt that God is going to manifest that promise it may be one year 2 year 25 years but he who made the promise is more than able to bring it to pass right Abraham was more than just persuaded he was fully persuaded and being a champion of the faith he didn't withdraw from the promise I'm trying to show you tonight don't pull back from the promise of God God made you a promise God's given you a promise don't you pull back from it because what you see or what you don't see you keep believing keep trusting God will bring it to pass being a champion is being bold in the face of opposition notice it's remaining steadfast in the midst of your critics boy we sure got enough critics but we ain't backing down we ain't backing up and we ain't retreating and we ain't surrendering we moving forward we got a job to do we got a purpose we got a goal and it's a Rapture and it's it's that man's job that man's job that man's job my job to get all of y'all ready for it and as long as we're behind this Pulpit we're going to preach you into a Rapture because we're going to preach you Faith we're going to feed you the gospel we're going to feed you the word of God we're going to preach you a balanced diet oh we're going to preach you that you can have emotion when when it's all about him and he comes down and you get to Victory you got a reason to get emotional but we're going to Anchor it on the word of God we're going to have a foundation and that Foundation is sure and steadfast tonight it ain't just all emotion but we got a word to go with it we got an anchor of T that can't be moved tonight we got a sure Foundation we're anchored on the Rock of Ages light we may not understand everything but in God's time in God's season God will bring forth the Revelation I've been a witness I've been preaching 24 years now been a part of this church 25 26 years I didn't come in with all the head knowledge and all the understanding and even today I still have questions but I recognize that God brings the understanding in his time in his season well you shouldn't be preaching if you don't have all the understanding well you shouldn't be sitting there either uhuh a pot calling the kettle black we learn and we grow in our understanding we grow in our Revelation your Prophet did if he he did can't we some of you ain't sitting in the same mindset you sat 20 years ago at least I hope not no there should be a progression notice you know what a champion does a champion doesn't reflect or a champion doesn't dwell on defeat or what's in the past a champion reflects on where he was and thanks him for where he's at today because he knows all the work all the effort everything he's put into it every sacrifice he used to be there but today he's here he used to be in drugs but today he's in the house of God he used to be drunk but today he's filled with the Holy Ghost that's a champion he ain't looking at past the feet ain't going back around that circle around that mountain time and again no he's looking to the mark of the High Calling he's looking to the word of God he's believing for the promise when nobody when no one else brother Johnny will believe with him he's still believing when he has to walk alone he's still walking when he has to come to church by himself or by herself that's right she's still coming right when the kids have to come without the parents they're still coming Champion pedigree Champion pedigree oh I hope you're getting this notice a champion is not knowing the word defeat or retreat brother BR makes a statement in conferences never does God ever say Retreat that's right no retrea in God God is go forward some of you need to hear that one more time so I'm going to tell you God doesn't know the word Retreat God only knows the word go forward some many to stop going around that camp cop stop going around that mountain of depression that you've been in or fear that you've been in or complexes that you've been in or family strains that you've been in quit going around that thing circling around and wishing you could do better let me tell you you got to go forward now this is the time to press to the mark of the High Calling Moses at the Red Sea you don't think God knew that he was bringing him there he didn't get concerned about the Red Sea he was a concerned about the Egyptians that was on their Trail he wasn't worried about the mountains on both Sid God had already drew the blueprint he knew the path that they would take and when Moses came to God crying about it so like some of us crying about our trial crying about this and crying about that God didn't say okay Moses go back to Egypt no he says why cry to me speak and go forward his son is time for some of us to speak to the mountain that's in your way and move forward about it God is asking us to believe he's asking if I can take you out if I'm big enough to take you out of Egypt can't you trust me to take me take you into the promised land if I can take you from nothing if I can take you from drugs if I can take you from prostitution if I can take you from a party animal if I can take you from those things can't I take you to a rapture can't I take you to a Promised Land we ain't got to figure out all the mechanics of the sea splitting and water rolling back no all we got to do is trust God and go forward come on Champions see a champion notice now A Champion doesn't listen to all the other voices around them cuz there's so many voices in the world today but he's only focused on that one you remember the story brother Ram talked about the violin player he's playing that violin and when he got done everybody stood Standing Ovation that didn't move him right he wasn't looking for the standing ovation he wasn't looking at what everybody else talked he was only fixated on his trainer on his coach that's right and the Bible says my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow we're not here just seek all the Acclaim but he was only looking what does God think about it what does God think about my life what does God think about my decisions what does God think about my career what does God think about my church what does God think about my dress what does God think about my speech what does God think about it I'm not worried about what this family thinks about it cuz families have different degrees of standards in their families not every one of of us is going to carry the same standard in this church but what does God think about it Championship pedigree there's a champion within notice now let me go on just a little bit further tonight see a champion doesn't mean that you feed on complexes well I'm not good enough and you shouldn't be here and there's no use of trying anymore you know you might as well give up and quit no Champion don't listen to that garbage champ don't look at that Champions inside that message digging on 1100 something sermons reading that Bible praying seeking God's Direction that's What A Champion does he ain't feeding a complex he's feeding on thus sayith the Lord see being a champion doesn't mean you throw in a towel when the fight gets intense it's refusing to walk away it's refusing to quit but it's staying in the fight even if it means you take blows blow after blow after blow some of you wonder why can't we get ahead it's just another blow but the champion pedigree on the inside of he says I can take it I can take it I can take it and I'm gonna drop this in George Foreman Muhammad Ali George Foreman was The Undefeated Champion H Ali lost the belt seven years prior because he refused to go to war he was a champion in his mind but George Foreman was the great Champion he had a belt that proved it he had the hardest punch in boxing history and yet they met in the Manila or the the killa in the Manila I believe that was the name of oh no it was the Royal Rumble excuse me and here they were they're fighting and George Foreman comes out and Ali comes out bam he's floating like a butterfly bam stinging like a bee oh yeah all of a sudden couple punches from George Foreman he's laying against the ropes second round against the ropes third round he's against the ropes fourth round he's against the ropes fifth round he's against the ropes seventh round he's against the ropes the eighth round he's against the r and George Foreman is blow after blow after blow giving the best the hardest punches that he could and I he took it and he said it two times in that fight he was knocked out standing on his feet but he still stood there because he had Champion pedigree in his mind he had a champion pedigree in his heart and he stood there and he took the very best that George Foreman can do sh and then in the eighth round baby oh yeah he come out he come off the ropes and he began to swing B bam and a few swings like that and George Foreman was on the mat TKO knocked down first time in his career what am I telling you church I'm telling you it's time that you come off the road tonight you still got fight in you you still got fight in you tonight come off the road you've taken the best that he could dish out you've taken the best that the enemy can dish out come off the road tonight it's time that you fight your way through this see a champion is mustering the strength to rise back up after getting knocked down brother Ram says I got a lot of respects for a man when he does when he does make make a mistake he's got courage enough to rise and try again oh my in this day and age that's few and far between but he says we're all going to make mistakes the best makes mistakes but a soldier is not one who will lay down when he's knocked down but he will rise up again he said we used to sing a song Let Me rise and try again who goes oh I like that for I have made many mistakes in my life we all have somebody needs to play that for voice of God we've all made many mistakes in our life but we've always been he goes I've always been thankful to God for Grace to let me rise and try again I believe the song is entitled forgive me Lord and try me one more time he goes I think that's it I'll be yours if you'll be mine if I fall if I sin Let Me rise and try again take me back and try me one more time see but a man man that's once knocked down if he's a real Soldier he'll rise up again Lord let me rise and try again but a coward as soon as he sees that he makes a mistake a little mistake first he goes just like this morning that bug and the water spider they will crawl right back to the water CU he can't stand it I'm talking to Champions tonight see Champions don't give up no matter no matter what your makeup no matter what your family treat no matter what your personality each of you possess Championship pedigree because he has given you him Spirit he has made you what you are the Bible says in Romans 8 and verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us notice the glory this word here means magnificence or magnificance Excellence preeminence the most glorious condition the most exalted State and he says that the sufferings of this present time the financial struggles the sickness in your body the you know that season of of fall or That season of winter to where seems like everything's dead in your life and your experience is death he said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the magnificence or magnificance which shall be revealed in US not to us but in us see it's the struggle that you go through that produces the champion the Affliction that you face cause this champion from within to come out and rise to the occasion brother B said before you can have Victory there has to be a battle if there are no battles then there no victories so we ought to be thankful for the battles and the tri it's God giv us an opportunity to have victories see but you got to have a battle to have Victory if it was just given to you it wouldn't it wouldn't be it wouldn't be a victory but he that overcometh is one who has the victory so Jesus came to the Earth he had a battle he won the Victory and tonight we have a battle with Christ and we have the victory you believe that church let me start bringing this down to a close you find me a stopping place here a few more minutes so we look at God tonight and in Exodus 15 and verse three the Bible says that the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name that word man there man of war that phrase means he's a champion of War Champion never defeated he's defeated all rivals he's a great man a man of war and we find in 2 Chronicles 20:1 17 you shall not fight in this battle set yourself stand still and see the salvation of the Lord then we find in Exodus 14:13 for the Egyptians whom you see today you shall see them again no more forever Exodus 14 and ver14 the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace Deuteronomy 1:30 the Lord your God which goeth before you he shall fight for you he and then we've look in Deuteronomy 3 and verse 22 you shall not fear them for the Lord your God he shall fight for you Deuteronomy 20 and verse four for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you so the Lord is a man of war there's an attribute on the inside to fight I'm not saying you fight your neighbor I'm not saying you fight the church I'm not saying you fight one another but God has called us to fight the enemy you say well brother Joel I don't feel God near I don't you know sometimes God seems a million miles away he says can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on her son of her womb yay they may forget yet I will not forget thee because why cuz I've I have Graven you upon the palms of my hand so when he threw his hands out and took your nails he engraved you on the palms of his hands he can no more forget about you so church tonight we got to press to battle yes sir there was a time that let me get to it there was a time that Theodore Roosevelt our former president after he was the president he went overseas and he did a tour and he was acting as an ambassador on behalf of the United States and he got over there and I believe he was in in in he was in Paris and he be he gave a speech that was called the citizenship in the Republic otherwise it became known as the man in the arena how many You' ever heard of that you know he he be to rail on the cynics who looked down at men who were trying to make the world a better place and he said the poorest way to face life is to face it with the near a cynical habit of a thought and speech a Readiness to criticize work which to critic himself never tries to perform have you ever met somebody like that they ain't never lifted a finger to help anything in the church help anybody do anything and yet they want to criticize they ain't never had nobody over to their house but they want to criticize because nobody has them over oh my oh brother Joe get off of that preach about the man in Arena I'm going back to it but notice they criticize never tries to perform an intellectual aloofness which will not accept contact with life realities all these are marks not of superiority but of weakness then he goes on here's the main theme of The Man in the arena it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of Deeds could have done it better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena the one notice because he says whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who HS and who comes short time and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the Deeds who knows with great enthusiasms great devotion who spins himself in a worthy cause who had best knows in the end the Triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly least he's putting forth effort at least he's fighting at least he's in the arena so that his place shall never be with those cold timid Souls who neither knew Victory nor defeat so today at this moment at this hour in this age in this service you are the man in the arena we look at Hebrews 11 musicians you can make your way back I'm not done preaching but I'm going to go a few more minutes but if you'd make your way back Hebrews 11 and: 33 we talk about this is The Heroes of Faith are the champions of Faith chapter and we look here and it says who through faith they subdued kingdoms they wrought righteousness 11:33 obtained promises stopped the miles of Lies quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raise to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover a bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sown aund were tempted were slain with a sword they wondered about in sheep skins and gohost skins being destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom this world is not worthy of they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth see all these Believers had their Arena Great Men great women stopped the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword they were made strong the weak were made strong all these were champions that's right of their day some were tortured They didn't accept Deliverance because they wanted to attain a better Resurrection others had trial of crew mockings and scourging and bonds of imprison they were stoned and swn US sun temped and slain they wondered about in sheep skins and gohost skins destitute Afflicted and tormented but we're not talking about their day and their Arena I'm talking about today it's not them that's in the arena it's you that's in the arena and the Bible tells us that they without us cannot be made perfect they are waiting for more Champions to come you may think well what have I done that's been so great man when we get to the other side I'm going to find one of these and I'm going to ask them how did you make it but you don't realize they're going to find you and say how did you make it how did you come out of Satan's Eden that's right I'm going to tell you how you made it cuz a champion on the inside a champion on the inside and the man didn't give you that champion the church didn't give you that champion but God came and gave you his son his holy spirit to Champion you through see their Arena produced some of the greatest Champions that history has ever chronicled and today it's not those in Hebrews 11 but it's us and some of your Affliction is financial some of your Affliction is your children it's your family it's your marriage it's your finances it's your body it's your sickness it's an arena it's not the critic who counts watching the services criticizing your rejoicing criticizing your emotion it's not the critic that counts it all matters to the man that's in the arena because he knows great stals he knows what he's been through to produce that emo motion to produce that overwhelming feeling of release when he finally gets the victory see the credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena see the man who strives valiantly even when he's exhaust and weary he continues to fight think about the man who's been up all night puking because he's fighting cancer battling Caesars before he walks out behind the pulpit he don't come like this when a champion walks through the door and he comes and he smiles says I love you a champion of the faith when Satan Throne everything he could at him he stands behind this desk to preach to you a God that still heals a God that still delivers can I tell you about a few more Champions present day A Champion is a man who maybe lost a spouse or a loved one instead in getting down on it and digressing and pulling away a champion Rises and he walks out those doors but he's got a people that believes in him and he stands behind this and says don't have pity for me I know where she's at and he preaches to you a God that's still able God that still can a God that still will I'm talking to you about Champions maybe maybe the champion someone who's been to the doctor they don't know what's going on with them legs tingling can't figure it out body does crazy things doctor doesn't give him a great report but a champion when called upon never mentions his sickness never gives in to how he feels but he comes and he stands at his Call of Duty and he preaches faith that no matter how my body is no matter if I don't have a remedy if they can't even put a name on it he's standing in front of you as a champion of Faith looking away from what he feels and believing in a God who heals let me give you one more Champion a champion that's been in the Battle of depression lost a mom wife going through struggles changes throws you into a depression but week after week Wednesday after Wednesday service after service all around the world called upon we need you brother Timothy we need you to come preach he ain't standing behind this desk preaching to you about his depression but he's preaching to you about a God that delivers a God that defeats depression a God that's able tonight I'm talking to you about Championship pedigree and every one of us have a champion within you are a champion tonight God has made you a champion you got every right to worship you got every right to praise God God made you what you are it's what God has done for his children he's given us a piece of himself a part of that Championship blood line is liviing every one of us here tonight it's not the critic that counts it's not the critics that's the champion it's not your trial that's the champion it's not your sickness that's the champion it's not your financial struggle or your marriage struggle that's a champion it's you it's you it's you that's the champion tonight didn't I bring you from nothing didn't I bring you from nothing didn't I take drugs and alcohol away from you didn't I make you a champion didn't I do this not to improve it but I did it didn't not call you from Mississippi didn't I call you from your friends didn't I call you from the worldly life that you used to live didn't I call you didn't not place you here you didn't understand nothing about this message but I called you to come here because he looked on the end inside and he saw Championship material and God has sent some of you from Washington he sent some of you from Arizona he sent some of you from all over the place why to come and be a part of this Arena because God has got more Champions I say oh God
