[41:20] just for a moment I've got a lot of
[41:22] things here today that we want to cover
[41:26] but I just I just thought um as we go
[41:32] I'm thinking today of as you as you see
[41:36] our minister brothers are missing but
[41:38] the michaelis of here with me this
[41:40] morning he said I'll stay up here with
[41:42] you today so amen and but they're out
[41:46] doing the Lord's work they're not out
[41:49] just just goofing off but they're doing
[41:52] the Lord's work but the aaron has been
[41:55] strean out in Virginia and will minister
[41:59] out in South Carolina this Wednesday at
[42:02] brother Jason Watkins brother Timothy's
[42:04] been in North Carolina because we got
[42:07] brother Craig over at brother Jason
[42:09] Jackson's and just a wonderful time
[42:13] already that they've had this been a
[42:15] real blessing and help to brother
[42:18] Jackson and and then of course brother
[42:20] Jo's up in Connecticut with that little
[42:22] group there so you know it's um
[42:24] all over the world the Spirit is moving
[42:26] a man I want to sing that course here in
[42:29] just a moment so you start thinking of
[42:31] that key for that but I just want to
[42:35] remind you that we're in a very very
[42:37] serious hour in a very serious time I
[42:39] don't believe that we have ever as a
[42:43] people ever come to such a poignant
[42:46] moment as what we're in right now it's
[42:50] very very important to realize the hour
[42:54] that we're in and the seriousness of
[42:57] this hour we are coming in one of the
[43:00] last sermons brother Branham preached it
[43:02] was in a public sermon that was the
[43:04] communion service after brother Branham
[43:08] had finished his ministry and the last
[43:10] thing that he done was communion we'll
[43:12] talk about that here in a moment again
[43:14] but in in that he said I believe the
[43:17] days of Ananias and Sapphira are going
[43:21] to return again and that is where sin
[43:24] will not be able allowed to be able to
[43:27] stay in the church and then see the risk
[43:30] lers here god bless you too and so you
[43:33] know it's where sin cannot you know stay
[43:37] in the in the church and and it will be
[43:39] called out well you know what we just
[43:43] had happened at youth camp were we had
[43:46] about in there after about 10
[43:49] manifestation of demonic spirits very
[43:51] very serious things as we are dealing in
[43:56] a time word where the devil has taken
[43:59] people more in this hour than ever
[44:02] before and last night after brother
[44:06] Timothy ministered in north
[44:08] Linna they had a prayer line I got a
[44:10] text from brother Aaron who was also
[44:12] there to join in prayer as it was facing
[44:15] a very serious demonic manifestation and
[44:19] they've taken young lady back to the
[44:22] back room there and was praying with
[44:25] with her as it was manifesting their
[44:28] spirit growling and speaking out like
[44:32] that and of course when I got the text I
[44:35] dropped to my knees and about 45 minutes
[44:39] later I I got a report of victory that
[44:43] the young sister was debts and Miriam
[44:45] danced and delivered but the demon took
[44:48] her about she was reading books she
[44:50] shouldn't have been reading that's how
[44:52] it come out and you need to start
[44:55] looking at some things very differently
[44:57] I want you to think of this very
[44:59] differently as I told you if some weeks
[45:02] ago in brother branham's time where the
[45:04] little Norman girl Mary Norman took an
[45:08] evil spirit while watching a movie on
[45:11] the Holocaust at a church and and there
[45:15] that thing began to trouble her from
[45:17] then on and brother Branham down there
[45:20] after the meetings in 62 the Grass
[45:23] Valley meetings he prayed for her and he
[45:25] said I saw an evil spirit rise off of
[45:27] her said she'll be all right now and the
[45:30] nightmares and everything stopped after
[45:32] that but I want you to start looking at
[45:34] things very differently when you open
[45:37] yourself up by lust looking upon
[45:40] somebody or something to lust after in
[45:42] your heart in the spirit round now maybe
[45:45] not the physical realm but in the spirit
[45:48] realm it's the same as adultery because
[45:51] this this thing opened this girl up to
[45:54] an evil spirit and again I say this is
[45:57] this is the days of Ananias and Sapphira
[46:00] when you just can't play Church last
[46:04] Sunday I was telling you of a van vision
[46:09] of brother branham's were that he saw
[46:10] death coming and this was in the form of
[46:13] a Mamba snake and he said it was after
[46:16] his brother he was given the power to
[46:19] bind it yet he was told
[46:21] he was told that himself you're going to
[46:25] have to be more sincere in order to bind
[46:29] this spirit of death and I'm telling you
[46:33] we are coming into an hour where it
[46:36] requires a greater sincerity than ever
[46:38] before
[46:39] and as I was telling that I recounted
[46:44] where brother Branham took his Bible
[46:47] because he said the children were
[46:49] getting up and the vision had just come
[46:51] and he said I was praying I said lord I
[46:53] need I need a word from you what must I
[46:56] do you've told me to be more sincere
[46:58] what must I do and and he said you know
[47:03] he said he took the Bible in his hands
[47:06] and he said he said he and he other
[47:10] times he said I don't use this for like
[47:12] a Ouija board or something like that he
[47:14] said just just better aware occasions
[47:16] but he said I took my Bible and it fell
[47:19] open right now my Bible fellow to the
[47:23] Book of Daniel but there it fell over to
[47:26] the book of first Corinthians I believe
[47:28] his first Corinthians where he said that
[47:31] that you know that you've got to come to
[47:34] this feast of the Passover and he said
[47:38] you must come to the unleavened bread of
[47:41] sincerity and truth and so he said a
[47:45] feast with the Lord is a fast and he
[47:48] said I must be more sincere he said so
[47:51] I'm going to go and fast and pray and
[47:54] ask God for that more sincerity and I'll
[47:58] tell you what is time more than ever
[48:00] before that we realize we're dealing
[48:02] with issues and times that we enter into
[48:06] a time of darkness like there's never
[48:09] been upon the face of the earth and
[48:11] we've got to be a people who are sincere
[48:14] because then then spirits will call you
[48:17] out for your in sincerity amen it'll
[48:22] call you out for it we've already seen
[48:24] that happen and I just I just want to
[48:26] say the very things sometimes we look at
[48:29] things very frivolous this is not an
[48:31] hour to play Church this is that a nice
[48:34] so far
[48:34] last Sunday when I when I told you that
[48:38] very thing you have a brother Brandon
[48:39] took and opened his Bible and it fell
[48:42] there I don't use this Bible it's one I
[48:45] keep on my desk I don't take it home and
[48:47] don't read from it I don't study from it
[48:49] it's a Bible brother George Hamilton
[48:51] gave me for that it's a actually a kind
[48:57] of a reminiscent of the Scofield Bible
[49:00] brother Branham carried in he had my
[49:02] name put on it and I only carry it to
[49:05] the pulpit I don't study over it's my
[49:07] family if I would die my family looked
[49:09] at it to find my favorite scripture
[49:11] something I underlined ain't a thing
[49:13] underlined and I don't read out of it
[49:15] it's just something I carried the pulpit
[49:17] so that I can have a reference or open
[49:19] it to to something I I don't think it
[49:23] would be much dignity just to walk out
[49:25] with notes or or a pad and not a Bible
[49:29] so you know I like to take my Bible
[49:32] along with me out to the pulpit for
[49:34] reference but when I had not opened it
[49:37] that morning but when I opened it that
[49:39] day now if I try to open it it opens up
[49:43] to the index if I go to where I think
[49:45] because there's a huge huge index here
[49:48] in the back of this Bible starting for
[49:50] about right there is mostly index from
[49:54] their own so as you see I
[49:57] if either tried I'd have missed the book
[50:00] of Corinthians because I'm not familiar
[50:02] with this big big index in it but when I
[50:05] opened it up it opened up to the exact
[50:08] same scripture the brother Branham was
[50:10] pointed to and I showed the three
[50:13] ministers that was on the on the
[50:15] platform that day is a witness that was
[50:17] last Sunday and I would just want to
[50:19] remind you the Holy Spirit is here and
[50:21] he's telling us something very direct
[50:24] and I want us to really I want us to
[50:27] really tune in to what God is speaking
[50:31] and I have something today and there may
[50:34] be a little bit lengthy but we're all
[50:36] mostly message believers here today and
[50:39] so I'm not worried about how long I
[50:42] preach I want to deliver my heart today
[50:46] I have wept moreover the
[50:48] sermon than any sermon I have in years
[50:51] as I just because of as a the Lord
[50:57] speaking to me and making some things
[50:59] that's really real that is pressed on my
[51:02] heart and so I want you to tune in today
[51:05] with all your heart with everything
[51:08] that's within you and the you know you
[51:10] it'll get lengthy and boys on the front
[51:13] seat here I know you're you get a little
[51:16] tired and and you're young and get
[51:19] filled up and you have to go to the
[51:22] restroom don't don't go down these
[51:23] single this sinner I'll ever go out to
[51:26] the side in a way because it disturbs
[51:28] right in the view of the cameras for
[51:31] those that are watching so you know I
[51:33] just just want to say you know we need
[51:36] to come into this service with a deeper
[51:40] sincerity and I want you this to pray as
[51:42] we pray this morning and ask God to
[51:46] speak to you in a very clear way and let
[51:50] this word find a resting place in your
[51:52] heart will you stand together with me
[51:55] now I want us to sing as I'm thinking of
[51:59] even in life being all over the United
[52:01] States today you know here there
[52:04] everywhere north south east west
[52:05] wherever they are ministering out I
[52:08] wants to sing all over the world the
[52:11] Spirit is moving all over the world like
[52:14] the Prophet said it would be
[52:17] a halt over the world is a mighty
[52:19] revelation it's the coming of the Lord
[52:22] as the waters cover the sea a man less
[52:26] worship got together

[54:31] things happiness miracles there in the
[54:35] meetings and brother Jason's Lord the
[54:38] Holy Spirit moving right here in the
[54:40] church you're speaking in very
[54:42] supernatural Mass Lord may be in very
[54:46] simplicity but let us not miss your
[54:48] simplicity because God is hidden and
[54:52] revealed in simplicity and I pray God
[54:55] they will not miss today what you're
[54:57] doing that you'll speak your speak in a
[55:01] very direct way

[56:28] enemy we must be more sincere we must be
[56:33] a dedicated consecrated so that people
[56:36] bless us I pray in Jesus name Amen amen
[56:41] god bless you as we here today let's
[56:45] turn to the book of Exodus chapter 12
[56:47] for our scripture reading this morning
[56:51] looking to the Lord and asking him to
[56:53] speak to us now as we approach this very
[56:59] soberly and sincerely Exodus chapter 12
[57:02] and verse 1 and the Lord speaking to
[57:07] Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
[57:09] saying this month shall be unto you the
[57:12] beginning of months it shall be the
[57:14] first month of the year to you speaking
[57:17] to all the congregation of Israel saying
[57:20] in the tenth day of this month they
[57:24] shall take to them every man a lamb
[57:27] according to the house of their fathers
[57:29] a lamb for a house god bless you is
[57:34] you're seated I'm going to be speaking
[57:40] to you from this scripture maybe you
[57:45] didn't see a whole lot in it as we read
[57:47] it there's a little phrase there that
[57:50] just struck my heart the other day that
[57:53] I want to speak to you about
[57:55] and as we Menace
[57:57] this morning and I want to speak on the
[58:00] new beginning and of course we're the
[58:02] people of the book that have returned to
[58:05] the land of the book and for Israel as
[58:08] they retirement was returning to the
[58:11] land it was as it was going back to
[58:14] their origin going back to the beginning
[58:17] we believe as Israel received a
[58:20] messenger from God who brought them the
[58:23] message of the Exodus it was vindicated
[58:26] with signs and wonders even so God has
[58:29] sent a message in this last day and you
[58:34] know so as we come in our thoughts today
[58:38] to the last message I want to just key
[58:42] in on a couple of things um as we
[58:46] believe that we have received the
[58:47] seventh angels message as you know the
[58:50] Bible said in the days of the voice of
[58:52] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[58:54] sound the mystery of God should be
[58:57] finished so he declared that would come
[59:00] an hour a day a time where the mystery
[59:02] of God would be finished and and I
[59:06] believe that God's used and vindicated a
[59:09] messenger in this day and set him apart
[59:13] from all the other itinerate evangelist
[59:15] that struck the countries like all
[59:17] Roberts and Billy Graham and the
[59:20] different other greats that are out
[59:22] there as they would call him in today's
[59:24] language God's generals but there was
[59:27] not a man that equalled William Branham
[59:30] because we saw in his ministry the very
[59:33] Ministry of Jesus Christ repeat itself
[59:37] what I mean is that it was not it was of
[59:41] course he was not Jesus Christ he as far
[59:43] from me was a man just like we're men
[59:45] but he was a man to bring forth the
[59:48] message that Jesus Christ has to this
[59:51] endtime people and it's not a new
[59:54] message it's a message that we heard
[59:56] from the beginning that has been
[59:59] distorted by the denominational ages but
[1:00:02] that I I think some time ago you know I
[1:00:06] read on a book about killing Lincoln it
[1:00:09] was by men
[1:00:10] Nimmo o'reilly and he wrote a book it
[1:00:12] was a very wonderful book took about the
[1:00:15] last two weeks of Lincoln's life and day
[1:00:17] by day and what happened every day and
[1:00:20] that maybe the the thoughts that was
[1:00:22] running through his mind or the
[1:00:23] preparations that he was making the man
[1:00:25] who had lit only a few this many hours
[1:00:28] left to live the man who only had a day
[1:00:31] to live or whatever you know that and he
[1:00:33] would carry it along his life story and
[1:00:37] and you know I I'm I thought of course
[1:00:41] came to this message and brother branham
[1:00:45] here would would come to time that he
[1:00:48] only had just a few more sermons to
[1:00:50] preach and when it did the message to
[1:00:54] Laodicea would be finished it would be
[1:00:58] not another sermon that would come out
[1:01:00] from that servant of God and he would
[1:01:03] speak his very last sermon public sermon
[1:01:07] which would be on leadership and then
[1:01:11] leadership um which is his last complete
[1:01:15] message and this would be taken and I
[1:01:18] think this is very significant taken
[1:01:21] just before he would serve communion
[1:01:24] there into song at brother greens
[1:01:27] Tabernacle he wouldn't preach but he
[1:01:30] would just have some comments and speak
[1:01:32] for a little bit after the sermon had
[1:01:35] been given by brother Perry and he would
[1:01:37] do the communion and he would serve
[1:01:39] communion and then was gone and the last
[1:01:44] words that he would speak publicly he
[1:01:48] would say these hideous sites that's
[1:01:52] coming up on the earth you can see how
[1:01:54] the people moving right into it
[1:01:57] it's an insanity but when that things
[1:02:00] trikes the church will be gone God let
[1:02:05] us be there that's my prayer to the
[1:02:09] great supernatural being that's in this
[1:02:11] building tonight the Great Christ that
[1:02:14] has eternal life I pray the crisis I'm
[1:02:17] here with my eyes open looking at the
[1:02:20] church you've redeemed but with your
[1:02:21] blood God don't
[1:02:24] letter one of us be lost we want to be
[1:02:27] right with you so cleanse us O Lord from
[1:02:30] all our iniquities take away our sins
[1:02:33] and things we've seen you heal our sick
[1:02:35] and even raise our dead come back to
[1:02:37] life through prayer and we've seen all
[1:02:40] these things happen father now bring us
[1:02:43] back to life spiritually and bring us
[1:02:47] back to the realization of eternal life
[1:02:50] through Christ Jesus grant this father I
[1:02:53] committed unto you in Jesus Christ's
[1:02:56] name
[1:02:56] til we meet and he sings till we meet
[1:03:00] til we meet at Jesus feet God be with us
[1:03:04] till we meet again and he tells us all
[1:03:07] goodbye and leaves and goes out and has
[1:03:11] Passover the communion with his
[1:03:15] disciples in brother Greene's church and
[1:03:20] just a few days later he's gone I think
[1:03:25] it was very fitting when we saw the
[1:03:26] Ministry of Christ repeat then it
[1:03:30] happens the same way and we cannot deny
[1:03:35] that the death angel is in the land you
[1:03:39] cannot pretend that everything is just
[1:03:41] going to go on as it always has brother
[1:03:45] Branham would have his own self he said
[1:03:47] I can't see it no past in 1977 it got so
[1:03:50] dark he couldn't see past there and we
[1:03:53] have now advanced now many years into
[1:03:56] the hours of darkness and is getting
[1:03:59] worse and worse and there's a dying of
[1:04:02] Christian churches in America as I as I
[1:04:05] told you a month or so ago and brother
[1:04:07] Donnie sent us to some of us here this
[1:04:10] week and reminded me of it but I shared
[1:04:13] it with you a couple of months ago of an
[1:04:15] article that was was reporting that that
[1:04:18] every year in our nation that there's
[1:04:23] between six and ten thousand churches
[1:04:25] each year that are closing and that
[1:04:27] number is growing and
[1:04:32] and that it has been now falling for
[1:04:35] decades and now the number of
[1:04:39] unaffiliated in unchurched americans are
[1:04:44] nicknamed the nuns you know none
[1:04:48] religious and and that's that population
[1:04:52] is growing from 1991 to 25% today and
[1:04:57] this makes them the largest single
[1:04:59] religious group in America and today
[1:05:03] less than 20% of all Americans attend
[1:05:07] church on a regular basis I think you
[1:05:13] think oh yeah we're all immune to that
[1:05:15] hate that affects many people as as
[1:05:18] lukewarmness enters right in among our
[1:05:21] ranks
[1:05:22] I hear the cries of pastors what can I
[1:05:25] do to get people out on Wednesday night
[1:05:27] what can I do they won't come back on
[1:05:29] Sunday night there are only Sunday
[1:05:31] morning goers and and most of time not
[1:05:34] there then according to them that would
[1:05:39] be between nearly 200 churches will
[1:05:43] close just this week and you can see
[1:05:48] them vacant churches all over everywhere
[1:05:51] or hardly hardly enough money to coming
[1:05:55] in to keep and maintain the buildings
[1:05:57] and and so they're dying we got to get
[1:06:04] ready to leave here because the death
[1:06:07] angel is coming it's here in the land we
[1:06:10] can already hear the cries that are
[1:06:12] going up from families from homes from
[1:06:15] divorces from the drama every kind of
[1:06:18] evil thing that you can imagine that has
[1:06:20] already taken place and I'm not trying
[1:06:23] to hurry but don't press me I've got
[1:06:26] something very heavy on my heart today
[1:06:28] and the unveiling of God brother madam
[1:06:31] said the last plague in Egypt was death
[1:06:33] before the Exodus the last plague on
[1:06:36] earth his spirits of death before the
[1:06:38] Exodus and then they'll be cremated and
[1:06:41] turned back to dust and the righteous
[1:06:43] will walk out upon their house
[1:06:45] that's Malik at four but at the latter
[1:06:48] but the last thing is spiritual death
[1:06:50] rejecting the word so I think it's
[1:06:54] fitting as we just kind of sum up these
[1:06:57] early comments of my message preface and
[1:07:00] some of the things that has said that
[1:07:03] that our Lord Jesus last act before his
[1:07:05] return to God was the Passover and I
[1:07:10] think as he told his disciple I will be
[1:07:13] the fulfillment of the Passover
[1:07:15] Tinky this is my body take this cup it
[1:07:20] represents the blood of the New
[1:07:21] Testament you'll receive a life but
[1:07:25] receiving my my life the Holy Spirit in
[1:07:30] our gave with our messenger we saw the
[1:07:32] Ministry of Jesus Christ repeat again
[1:07:35] and I think again is fitting that the
[1:07:37] last act he did before departing was
[1:07:39] communion Passover and that's us here
[1:07:44] and all that's from under the blood will
[1:07:46] perish as he left us with this warning
[1:07:49] these hideous sites that's coming on the
[1:07:52] earth you can see how people's moving
[1:07:54] right into it it's an insanity but when
[1:07:57] that thing strikes the church will be
[1:08:00] gone
[1:08:00] how many wants to leave a man I don't
[1:08:04] want to stay here so it says this month
[1:08:08] that's he said to Israel this month so
[1:08:11] be unto you the beginning of months so
[1:08:15] he said I'm gonna give you a new
[1:08:17] beginning I'm going to actually in this
[1:08:20] exodus take you back to your origin now
[1:08:25] this was a new beginning for Israel it
[1:08:27] was we're beginning from slavery to
[1:08:29] freedom it was the birth of a nation
[1:08:31] were that they would become the bride of
[1:08:33] Jehovah the freedom would begin with the
[1:08:37] death of the Lamb an innocent one for
[1:08:39] the guilty and this blood
[1:08:41] who else their freedom the whole time
[1:08:45] and the whole theme I mean of their
[1:08:47] Exodus is Redemption and this Passover
[1:08:51] was redemption redeeming them from the
[1:08:54] evils of the Death Angel and their
[1:08:57] deliverance from slavery
[1:08:59] and as I said the Death Angel today is
[1:09:02] in the lam and with the passing over in
[1:09:04] the salvation from that from death
[1:09:07] Israel was having a new beginning and
[1:09:10] this and this also is a time where we
[1:09:14] must apply the blood the evening time
[1:09:18] messages the blood must be applied and
[1:09:21] that too must enter into that communion
[1:09:24] and that Passover with the Lord and eat
[1:09:28] the lamb and the unleavened bread and
[1:09:31] freak of his life are you with me now so
[1:09:35] he said this to me a beginning a month
[1:09:38] so I want you to see with it with the
[1:09:41] token being applied the blood being
[1:09:43] applied the blood was the token it
[1:09:45] represents the Holy Ghost with the blood
[1:09:48] being applied and them taking the
[1:09:50] Passover and all of this was a new
[1:09:53] beginning they were they were getting
[1:09:57] ready to go back to their origin because
[1:10:00] they had come from the promised land of
[1:10:03] Canaan and now we're after 400 years
[1:10:05] were having an exodus going back into
[1:10:09] the promised land as I think of this new
[1:10:13] beginning my mind goes to the earth
[1:10:16] because the earth itself was so well one
[1:10:20] day have a new beginning a man it'll go
[1:10:23] back to its origin before sin ever
[1:10:26] entered into the picture there are
[1:10:29] trillions of stars in the universe but
[1:10:32] there's one that is very special to God
[1:10:35] and the earth in its name is in the book
[1:10:41] of life and it's in the Bible now I want
[1:10:45] you to think you know because Saturn and
[1:10:48] Jupiter Mars none of their names are in
[1:10:50] the Bible but the earth his name is in
[1:10:53] the book of life out of the millions
[1:10:57] it is named and so it's very special to
[1:11:01] God yet the earth has its deep scars and
[1:11:05] ravines and chasms and fossils of
[1:11:07] millions of animals the earth
[1:11:10] within herself deep scars of her chaotic
[1:11:15] past as even as some of you who carried
[1:11:18] deep scars today in your heart from your
[1:11:22] past
[1:11:23] he called his place earth put his name
[1:11:27] in the book of life this is why he must
[1:11:30] redeem the earth he cannot I want you to
[1:11:33] get it
[1:11:34] he cannot annihilate it it's name is in
[1:11:39] his book and he cannot annihilate it the
[1:11:44] Bible said the heavens and earth shall
[1:11:45] pass away but that word means to change
[1:11:49] from one form to another form now it in
[1:11:55] second Peter 3 antena I'm going to deal
[1:11:58] with this because we're going to deal
[1:11:59] with the earth for a little bit because
[1:12:01] in it lays the very mystery of our new
[1:12:05] beginning and the new beginning that
[1:12:08] we're here at this time 2nd Peter
[1:12:11] chapter 3 verse 10 but the day of the
[1:12:13] Lord's have come as a thief in the night
[1:12:16] in which the heavens shall pass away now
[1:12:20] that word is the Greek word para , he
[1:12:22] which means it means to pass for one
[1:12:27] form to another and it will pass away
[1:12:30] with a great noise and the elements
[1:12:33] shall melt with fervent heat the earth
[1:12:36] also and the works that are therein
[1:12:39] shall be burned up it would be said in
[1:12:42] Matthew chapter 24 in verse 35 it uses
[1:12:46] the same word heaven and earth shall
[1:12:48] pass away but my words shall not pass
[1:12:52] away now the the theologians today
[1:12:59] debate on whether the earth will be
[1:13:01] renovated or whether it'll be
[1:13:03] annihilated but I want to just point out
[1:13:07] David said in the Psalms 37 11 but the
[1:13:11] meek shall inherit the earth
[1:13:12] and sound-alike himself in the abundance
[1:13:16] of peace Jesus agreed with this from
[1:13:19] Matthew 5 and violent bless
[1:13:21] meek for they shall inherit the earth
[1:13:24] I want to turn to Colossians 1 and 19
[1:13:29] for it is here that it says it pleased
[1:13:32] the father that in him said all fullness
[1:13:36] dwell and having made peace through the
[1:13:38] blood of his cross by him to reconcile
[1:13:42] all things and himself by him whether
[1:13:45] they be things on earth or things in
[1:13:48] heaven this Greek word reconcile comes
[1:13:51] from apocalypse Oh which means to change
[1:13:55] something backward and upward to its
[1:13:58] original condition so again he is going
[1:14:02] to reconcile it or change it back the
[1:14:06] earth back to its original condition
[1:14:08] before sin ever entered the picture now
[1:14:12] what exactly is being changed as we look
[1:14:15] at the scripture what exactly is being
[1:14:17] changed to its original condition
[1:14:19] through the blood of the cross of Christ
[1:14:21] Paul gives the answer all things he says
[1:14:25] a census for emphasis whether it be
[1:14:28] things on earth or things in heaven in
[1:14:31] other words nothing will be left out
[1:14:33] everything will be changed backwards and
[1:14:36] upward into its original condition
[1:14:40] hallelujah amen now in the days of Noah
[1:14:44] we know what God did to the earth as he
[1:14:46] started his process of redemption God
[1:14:49] would baptize the earth with water he
[1:14:53] would immerse it a man hidden to
[1:14:55] sprinkle upon it he immersed it in water
[1:14:57] the framework no was not destroyed just
[1:15:02] the same and the evil upon it but there
[1:15:05] that were walked out on a new earth are
[1:15:08] you with me after he had been destroyed
[1:15:11] with water now notice I'm gonna share
[1:15:14] this from future home there's a
[1:15:16] wonderful message that I've been coming
[1:15:18] over this week so he says the old world
[1:15:22] framework was not destroyed by the water
[1:15:24] the world was only washed off that got
[1:15:28] its baptism it was baptized so the
[1:15:31] framework so will the framework
[1:15:33] main though it'd be burnt by fire it
[1:15:36] don't destroy the earth it just
[1:15:39] destroyed the sin that's on it if you
[1:15:42] get the picture
[1:15:43] Malachi 4:1 says that that will walk out
[1:15:47] on the ashes of the wicked is that right
[1:15:50] so let's so again the evil there is a
[1:15:53] day coming the earth will burn with fire
[1:15:56] but we'll walk out on the actions of the
[1:15:59] wicked so the framework will be will
[1:16:02] remain and it don't destroy the earth as
[1:16:05] God the random would say notice in Peter
[1:16:08] the third chapter
[1:16:09] he uses the word world as Greek cosmos
[1:16:14] which means the world order the earth
[1:16:16] the earth shall pass away melt with
[1:16:19] elements with fervent heat so he doesn't
[1:16:22] mean the earth the planet is going to
[1:16:23] pass away but the world the cosmos the
[1:16:27] politics the sinners the system disease
[1:16:32] germs everything that's wrong will pass
[1:16:35] away he said God won't shook the earth
[1:16:39] rather and then business time he'll
[1:16:43] shake the heavens but we receive a
[1:16:46] kingdom that cannot be moved it's an
[1:16:48] eternal Kingdom what's how he goes to it
[1:16:51] notice Peter said and will melt with
[1:16:54] fervent heat and the works there I'll
[1:16:56] burn up not at the plant not the planet
[1:16:58] the works there in the works a man all
[1:17:02] their politicians their skis all their
[1:17:05] denominations man-made schemes will all
[1:17:07] go when it burns a man heavens and earth
[1:17:11] will pass away with a great noise did
[1:17:14] you get it heavens and earth will pass
[1:17:15] away with a great noise Ihnen listen the
[1:17:18] whole earth will be on fire it will
[1:17:21] ignite the gases it's in the earth and
[1:17:24] exploded
[1:17:25] that's exactly right the Bible said here
[1:17:27] Peter said heavens and earth will pass
[1:17:29] away with a great noise such an
[1:17:32] explosion will rocket or mob because
[1:17:35] it's got to kill every disease every
[1:17:37] thistle every thorn and everything there
[1:17:41] is to be done the fire
[1:17:42] bring it up and remember it's not all
[1:17:45] together just a literal fire it's also a
[1:17:48] holy fire that will take Satan and all
[1:17:51] of his Devils amen both heavens and
[1:17:54] earth will pass away killing all the
[1:17:57] germs all the insects all natural life
[1:18:00] own it and around it even the h2o the
[1:18:04] water will explode thinking that talk
[1:18:06] about a noise he said you think that
[1:18:09] little noise out here - Sun was
[1:18:11] something when he opened the seals that
[1:18:14] shook the country around the mountain
[1:18:15] calls to talk wait until this earth
[1:18:18] receives her baptism you know when a man
[1:18:21] receives the baptism of fire there's a
[1:18:24] lot of noise around there they think
[1:18:26] that's the same to hear people scream
[1:18:28] and shout like that but just wait into
[1:18:30] this world gets her baptism
[1:18:32] yeah it's flowed on h2o the water the
[1:18:36] Bible said in Revelation 21 and there
[1:18:39] was no more sea exploded this will
[1:18:42] change the whole servants of the entire
[1:18:44] earth she'll burst and blow to pieces
[1:18:47] all the outside the crust for hundreds
[1:18:50] of feet below it will just be completely
[1:18:52] demolished the atmospheres the gases
[1:18:55] it's in the earth where they're finding
[1:18:57] these missiles it can't get through it a
[1:18:59] a great sphere up their way up somewhere
[1:19:02] in some kind of sphere that there's all
[1:19:04] kinds of gases they say that a burst the
[1:19:07] holy wrath of God will come upon it and
[1:19:10] will cleanse it and change the entire
[1:19:12] surface now many of you won't want to
[1:19:15] put this down the Greek word pass away
[1:19:17] comes from the word pal Kamiya come and
[1:19:20] eat which means the heavens and earth
[1:19:22] will pass away this word means passing
[1:19:25] from one form to another
[1:19:27] doesn't mean annihilation but the
[1:19:29] English word would mean pass away is
[1:19:31] annihilated but the Hebrew word or Greek
[1:19:34] does not mean pass away it means from
[1:19:36] passing from one thing to another
[1:19:39] now notice Paul used said if you want to
[1:19:42] read it but it down later for the Titans
[1:19:45] three and five he used the same word
[1:19:47] means for your regeneration a man is
[1:19:50] passed from a sinner to saint
[1:19:52] completely annihilated but when a man
[1:19:55] has changed he is an annihilated he's a
[1:19:57] changed person
[1:19:58] he's been changed from what he was to
[1:20:01] what he is not annihilated a Magna note
[1:20:05] is now just a sin in the Devils and
[1:20:07] wickedness is annihilated
[1:20:10] hey man Jesus used the same word in
[1:20:13] Matthew 19:28 he said you'll sit with me
[1:20:16] and my father's kingdom regenerated you
[1:20:18] seek change when your change he used the
[1:20:21] same word he used the same word when he
[1:20:23] said to the cult loose the coat let him
[1:20:26] go said the same thing at the
[1:20:28] resurrection of Lazarus loosed him
[1:20:31] change him he's been tied let him go
[1:20:35] what does it mean the earth will be
[1:20:37] loosed from the grip of Satan
[1:20:39] it'll be loosed well from its politics
[1:20:43] it'll be loosed from denominational
[1:20:45] religious systems to be used for the
[1:20:48] kingdom of God to establish it here upon
[1:20:52] the earth but as long as it's in the
[1:20:55] hands of Satan Satan is the ruler of the
[1:20:58] earth he owns it it belong to him but
[1:21:01] now Christ has redeemed it one time I
[1:21:04] was his property but not now what I'm
[1:21:09] the little little woman at the well
[1:21:11] what's his property but not now he came
[1:21:14] to loosen the grip on it he loosed the
[1:21:17] grip of sin of Satan upon my life upon
[1:21:22] your life and now we're not here how
[1:21:25] often have you heard me saying prayer
[1:21:27] take your hands off a God's property a
[1:21:30] man see you you you have faith to claim
[1:21:33] your home that's your right take your
[1:21:35] hands off of her
[1:21:37] take your hands out for him see faithful
[1:21:41] do it oh my not annihilate it see but
[1:21:46] but just take your hands off of it loose
[1:21:49] it let it go past so it pass it away it
[1:21:52] changes the earth will change politics
[1:21:56] will change religions will change
[1:21:58] denominations will pass away politics
[1:22:01] will pass away that
[1:22:03] glad to be establish so now we see there
[1:22:07] have been works of redemption upon the
[1:22:10] earth this is cuttin through its baptism
[1:22:12] of water in the days of Noah and the
[1:22:16] blood of Christ was shed upon it in the
[1:22:19] days of Jesus but finally there will
[1:22:23] come a baptism of fire and when it does
[1:22:28] it up cleanse the heavens and the earth
[1:22:30] and that holy city New Jerusalem that
[1:22:35] John said myself a New Jerusalem coming
[1:22:39] down from God out of heaven and there
[1:22:43] will come down and God dwell here upon
[1:22:46] the earth with his people
[1:22:48] oh brother this is why day that we look
[1:22:51] forward to when this earth is cleanse
[1:22:53] from sin and wickedness and ever devil
[1:22:57] ever demon every evil spirit ever spear
[1:23:01] of lust ever spear of adultery will all
[1:23:04] burn in the lake of fire
[1:23:05] am I never to come and remembers anymore
[1:23:09] when the earth gets it's great baptism
[1:23:12] of fire every devil will be cast into
[1:23:14] the lake of fire now right now the earth
[1:23:19] it's here in its sixth day or it's six
[1:23:23] thousand year if you're controlling the
[1:23:25] air give me a little more of here the
[1:23:27] six that it's in its sixth day or it's
[1:23:31] six thousand year and soon we'll go into
[1:23:35] the Millennium it's you know it's just
[1:23:37] its seventh day you see it'll go into a
[1:23:40] rest period a man in we're right now we
[1:23:44] are in the sixth day of man or the six
[1:23:47] thousand years since time began now you
[1:23:51] know I want you to get that talk because
[1:23:54] the earth the earth has been part of
[1:23:57] God's great eternal plan and just like
[1:24:00] you yearn if you're timeless being but
[1:24:03] you're here for a type of wild in the
[1:24:07] space called time
[1:24:09] you'd slip down from eternity into a
[1:24:12] place of time but you came from God and
[1:24:16] you're going back to God and man your
[1:24:20] names were put on the Lamb's Book of
[1:24:22] Life before the world ever began oh my
[1:24:25] god knew you were coming put their name
[1:24:28] in there so you have eternal qualities
[1:24:31] because he wasn't God's eternal thoughts
[1:24:34] if I could say it to you little children
[1:24:37] this morning you are not temporary
[1:24:39] beings you are eternal beings and then
[1:24:43] you just didn't come and existed some 30
[1:24:45] 40 50 years ago on your birthday but it
[1:24:48] came your existence started waiting long
[1:24:51] before that because when the stars of
[1:24:54] God sing together and the sons of God
[1:24:57] shouted for joy you were there in his
[1:25:01] great chicken as he saw you in the
[1:25:05] praise God being victorious over sin
[1:25:09] give me a little more sound up here -
[1:25:11] now when brother Branham was teaching
[1:25:14] this and in the future home he explained
[1:25:17] about this seventh feast and we're about
[1:25:21] to go into that seventh day which would
[1:25:24] be the millennial reign now it's not
[1:25:26] eternity yet because it lasts for a
[1:25:28] thousand years is still in time a man
[1:25:32] but he explains how the seventh feast
[1:25:35] which is the Feast of Tabernacles where
[1:25:38] Israel would make booths and live in
[1:25:41] these temporary shelters or Tabernacles
[1:25:44] as a remembrance of their journey
[1:25:46] through the wilderness brother madam
[1:25:49] types the seven feasts with the seventh
[1:25:51] day of the earth which is the Millennium
[1:25:55] we have come from creation through time
[1:25:58] - now the six thousand years it was
[1:26:02] about two thousand years God washed it
[1:26:04] with water four thousand years later he
[1:26:06] shed the blood of Christ upon it a man
[1:26:10] where we're about to come to again
[1:26:13] another two thousand year period our
[1:26:17] calendar says it's all ready to sow
[1:26:19] 19 but it says the timed air or about is
[1:26:24] not an exact hour time then those those
[1:26:27] if you go back then you study the dates
[1:26:29] and the time some would be early some
[1:26:31] late but there but nevertheless you know
[1:26:34] we're right here in a junction we're
[1:26:37] over time a ma'am because the seven
[1:26:41] angel is already sounded his message and
[1:26:45] the last message of warning has been
[1:26:46] given to the church then the message to
[1:26:49] prepare to meet the bridegroom has come
[1:26:52] you believe that now
[1:26:55] the Millennium is not the Eternity but
[1:26:57] it's still time thousand years of on the
[1:27:00] earth we find this seventh feast being
[1:27:03] referred to in Leviticus 23 39 and we we
[1:27:08] won't read the whole chapter of 23
[1:27:12] because it covers all the different
[1:27:14] Feast of the Lord and these of course
[1:27:19] were rich in symbology of what God's
[1:27:22] great endtime plan would be and even the
[1:27:26] Passover would be a part of his entire
[1:27:29] plan aware that he would show you know
[1:27:32] the lamb and the depth of the lamb it
[1:27:34] was only reflecting a greater Passover
[1:27:37] to come amen
[1:27:40] and we're here again we're weary in
[1:27:44] another Passover hour with the death
[1:27:47] angel is passing over are you with me
[1:27:50] hey man now notice in Leviticus 23 39
[1:27:55] also on the 15th day of the seventh
[1:27:58] month when you shall be gathered have
[1:28:01] gathered in the fruit of the land you
[1:28:03] shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven
[1:28:05] days and on the first day shall be a
[1:28:08] Sabbath and on the eighth day shall be a
[1:28:11] Sabbath and ye shall taken to you on the
[1:28:15] first day the bowels of goodly trees the
[1:28:18] branches of palm trees and bowels of of
[1:28:22] thick trees and willows of the brook
[1:28:26] used to rejoice before the Lord your God
[1:28:31] seven days now the Feast of the
[1:28:34] tabernacle which is a feasts are that
[1:28:37] the seventh and last feast it represents
[1:28:40] and type the millennium ahead alright so
[1:28:44] where that we like Israel remember our
[1:28:48] journey ins they would remember through
[1:28:50] the wilderness but we will remember our
[1:28:53] journey ins through the earth and we
[1:28:57] will dwell in temporary houses or a
[1:29:01] booths or Tabernacles now if mortals
[1:29:04] don't need shelters I'm and don't need
[1:29:09] shelters or houses these houses will be
[1:29:12] beatle it will last 1,000 years or
[1:29:15] throughout the millennium but they're
[1:29:17] temporary booths and this is what God
[1:29:20] without Israel to do when you come into
[1:29:22] the land I want you to remember your
[1:29:25] journey ins through the wilderness where
[1:29:28] you dwelt in the wilderness and tents
[1:29:30] want you to set up these temporary
[1:29:33] booths for seven days and you will have
[1:29:36] this feasts commemorating how I brought
[1:29:39] you through the wilderness how I fed you
[1:29:42] bread and manna how provided meat for
[1:29:45] you how I brought you to the Red Sea I
[1:29:48] want you to remember what I did and what
[1:29:52] you know what I've done and you see the
[1:29:54] Millennium my hand will be like that
[1:29:56] it'll be a time of remembrance a time
[1:30:00] where we're not in slavery but at home
[1:30:03] in peace in the great millennial reign
[1:30:06] ahead I see a 65 19 tells about these
[1:30:11] temporary dwellings that will last for a
[1:30:15] thousand years and he says and I will
[1:30:18] rejoice in Jerusalem had joy in my
[1:30:21] people and the voice of weeping shall be
[1:30:24] heard no more in her nor the voice of
[1:30:28] crying and there was a beam no more than
[1:30:31] an infant of days nor an old man that
[1:30:33] has not filled his days for the child
[1:30:36] shall die at a hundred years old but the
[1:30:39] center being a cursed being a hundred
[1:30:41] years old shall be accursed
[1:30:43] and they shall build houses what's this
[1:30:47] now what what I say now it mortals now
[1:30:50] of course we won't be sinners we won't
[1:30:52] be given birth to children but there's
[1:30:54] other people that are be there as the
[1:30:56] heathen will be raised during that time
[1:30:58] that never had the opportunity to hear
[1:31:01] what you have heard and come to Christ
[1:31:03] they'll be given an opportunity will
[1:31:06] rule and reign over them the Bible said
[1:31:08] a thousand years hey man this is all
[1:31:11] Bible it's not makeup this is a promise
[1:31:14] of layin in the Word of God they shall
[1:31:17] build houses and inhabit them they shall
[1:31:20] plant vineyards and eat the fruit of
[1:31:22] them they shall not build in another
[1:31:25] inhabit in other words if brother
[1:31:27] Branham would explain it this way you
[1:31:29] know you build it and somebody else gets
[1:31:32] your dwelling right now my mother and
[1:31:34] dad and past own their grandson told
[1:31:37] owns their place you see my father build
[1:31:40] it
[1:31:40] another's inhabited but it won't be
[1:31:42] there hey man that's because they're not
[1:31:46] so many died our death will live out the
[1:31:49] whole thousand years that Adam failed to
[1:31:54] live in a man because of sin entered him
[1:31:58] he died no man ever lived out the
[1:32:00] thousand years but we will that's coming
[1:32:04] a man a restoration hallelujah a man
[1:32:09] that's comin Redemption we will live out
[1:32:13] that thousand year period is somebody
[1:32:16] with me a mile all it'll be a wonderful
[1:32:19] time but it's not the new earth it's
[1:32:22] still in time and there be still people
[1:32:25] in time but of course we will be in
[1:32:29] immortal bodies because we will have
[1:32:31] already received our change in a moment
[1:32:34] in a twinkling of an eye but there was
[1:32:36] to be people that are there in the end
[1:32:39] there that that as it describes they
[1:32:42] will build houses inhabited their plant
[1:32:44] vineyards and eat the fruit them on they
[1:32:46] shall not build in another inhabit
[1:32:48] theirs so my plan and another heat for
[1:32:50] the dancer days of the trees are the
[1:32:53] days of my people and my
[1:32:56] elects a long enjoy don't work of their
[1:32:59] hands how many wants to be one of those
[1:33:01] elect they some on labor in vain never
[1:33:06] bring forth for trouble for they are the
[1:33:08] seed Oh hallelujah they are the seed of
[1:33:12] the blessed of the Lord and there are
[1:33:15] Springs with them you ought to started
[1:33:17] shouting right then hey you're gonna be
[1:33:23] there because you're the scene of the
[1:33:25] blast of the Lord did you say and their
[1:33:29] offspring I wouldn't give up on one of
[1:33:34] my lost children my lost brother my lost
[1:33:37] sister my lost daddy my lost mother I
[1:33:39] wouldn't give up on nobody I'll be there
[1:33:43] [Applause]

[1:33:57] it provision they can all be there and
[1:34:07] it shall come to pass that before they

[1:34:22] the lamb shall feed together and the
[1:34:25] lion shall eat straw like the Bullock
[1:34:27] then the dust shall be the Serpent's
[1:34:30] meat and they shall not hurt nor destroy
[1:34:33] in all my holy mountain saith the Lord
[1:34:39] hallelujah can you take that promise
[1:34:42] today so the seventh day is a Sabbath
[1:34:46] rest for the earth after that the earth
[1:34:51] will have a new beginning they will
[1:34:53] revert back to its original condition
[1:34:56] before sand the innard and God will
[1:35:00] dwell on the earth with his people and
[1:35:03] their new Jerusalem will come down from
[1:35:07] heaven upon the earth brother branham
[1:35:10] would describe it
[1:35:12] he said eternity is like a perfect
[1:35:14] circle it begins and has no endings and
[1:35:17] that's eternity but he said when when
[1:35:21] sin entered he said a little piece of
[1:35:24] eternity dropped down out of that
[1:35:27] perfect circle called time he said Satan
[1:35:31] did not create this but he said there
[1:35:34] was a little gap of time and he says you
[1:35:38] know this is where we're at because of
[1:35:40] sin and during this time God gets that
[1:35:44] brings all his children forth and gets
[1:35:47] to manifest itself as Redeemer as Savior
[1:35:50] as healer all during this time but this
[1:35:56] time won't last forever a man to
[1:36:00] describe it his brother Brandon said one
[1:36:02] day he will hook to it the realm of
[1:36:06] salvation and eternity again eternal day
[1:36:18] the earth will have a new beginning it
[1:36:22] will actually go back to its origin so
[1:36:25] it's really not new after all it goes
[1:36:27] back to his formal state it's a
[1:36:30] restoration not really something new and
[1:36:35] you're with me now but it's new to those
[1:36:39] who've been in time because they've
[1:36:42] never seen the earth and in the eternal
[1:36:44] condition everything on earth is
[1:36:48] temporary the trees might outlive you
[1:36:52] five hundred years long you plant today
[1:36:54] but it's only temporary comes to an end
[1:36:57] life always comes to an end here it's
[1:37:00] time it's time bound your time bound
[1:37:03] creatures now you must leave time you
[1:37:10] might do it as a ten year old a 13 year
[1:37:14] old 20 year old 25 28 30 you might be
[1:37:21] like
[1:37:21] the rod Carol 68 years old and gone but
[1:37:28] you're only here for a time in this form
[1:37:33] but I'm trying to get to you you who are
[1:37:37] children of God
[1:37:38] you are a man eternal quality you may
[1:37:44] pass away but they're only changing four
[1:37:48] words this brother branham finishes this
[1:38:05] with the seven feast he said it looks
[1:38:09] like I'm out of types it looks like I'm
[1:38:11] out of dispensations because he come to
[1:38:14] the last feasts and it isn't it doesn't
[1:38:16] look like there's anything in it about a
[1:38:20] new heaven new earth he comes to the
[1:38:23] Millennium and stopped Sarah with the
[1:38:25] seventh feast and he begins to talk
[1:38:29] about this in the future home he said
[1:38:31] you might say to me I just might feel
[1:38:34] like somebody might say this me not
[1:38:36] brother branham what are you gonna do
[1:38:38] now you've run out of complete sevenths
[1:38:40] where are you going to now your
[1:38:43] dispensationalist which I am I believe
[1:38:46] God is to notice you've run out of
[1:38:48] dispensational types but if you're going
[1:38:51] to put it before it if you're going to
[1:38:53] put it it is something beyond that set
[1:38:55] of day how you gonna get it he says look
[1:38:58] all these seven days of the earth these
[1:39:01] six thousand years they've all been
[1:39:04] typed out in the feast but don't look
[1:39:06] like there's anything past that don't
[1:39:10] even look like there's anything left and
[1:39:11] he said but I want to call your
[1:39:12] attention to something no I ain't I
[1:39:15] ain't out of dispensations and I got
[1:39:17] another scripture here remember all
[1:39:20] things Hudson all of it has to be
[1:39:22] fulfilled every bit of it
[1:39:23] you say brother branham you're trying to
[1:39:25] put something beyond that seventh day
[1:39:28] that seventh day Sabbath as the earth
[1:39:30] God made the earth labored six-day and
[1:39:33] rested
[1:39:33] Sabbath this is only a type and is said
[1:39:36] here we become eternal so where is your
[1:39:40] type now you said your type ologists so
[1:39:43] you've run out of types is it no Hatun
[1:39:45] let's just find out if we have remember
[1:39:49] there were seven feast days Feast of the
[1:39:51] trumpets pieces of Tabernacle pieces she
[1:39:54] flavin all these great seven feast days
[1:39:57] there was only a type of the seven ages
[1:40:00] you remember how many Sabbath's was
[1:40:02] between one and the other seven Sabbath
[1:40:05] weaned Pentecost and the trumpets which
[1:40:07] are the seven churches which there's not
[1:40:09] seven Sabbath between Pentecost and the
[1:40:12] trumpets day he means Sabbath's between
[1:40:14] Passover and Pentecost there was seven
[1:40:17] weeks which Pentecost means seven weeks
[1:40:20] for fifty days and there was seven feast
[1:40:23] days that represent the seven Church
[1:40:26] ages so now brother Branham you doesn't
[1:40:29] run out
[1:40:29] you got your seven alright let's take
[1:40:33] the last piece which is visa Tabernacle
[1:40:35] notice the 36 verse this is same they
[1:40:40] sing chapter there we just looked at but
[1:40:43] he says in the 36 verse seven days shall
[1:40:48] you offer your offerings made of fire
[1:40:50] into the Lord and on the eighth day what
[1:40:59] has changed terminology you know there's
[1:41:03] seven days in a week but there's not
[1:41:06] eight days there's thirty days in a
[1:41:11] month Lord is his eighth come in on the
[1:41:16] eighth day shall be a holy convocation I
[1:41:18] want you to get this word convocation
[1:41:20] don't let it somebody who just means I a
[1:41:23] gathering so it was a time that is was
[1:41:28] to gather to the Lord for celebration
[1:41:31] for remembering for worshiping so he
[1:41:35] said on the eighth day shall be a holy
[1:41:38] convocation unto you and you shall make
[1:41:41] an offering made by
[1:41:43] iron to the Lord and it is a solemn
[1:41:45] assembly means it and you shall do no
[1:41:49] servile servile work there Ian so he
[1:41:52] says now we got an eighth day now there
[1:41:56] is only eight there are seven days but
[1:41:58] here we speak of this eighth day holy
[1:42:01] convocation this holy gathering notice
[1:42:05] we don't work here today they are what
[1:42:07] it's back to the first why it speaks of
[1:42:10] eternity as she rolls around without a
[1:42:14] stopping place so really there isn't
[1:42:18] there's not eight days in a week make
[1:42:20] day is just going back into eternity as
[1:42:27] eternity rolls on without a stopping
[1:42:29] place hallelujah now the eighth day is
[1:42:35] when the earth leaves time and goes back
[1:42:39] to its beginnings back to eternity where
[1:42:44] the New Jerusalem heaven comes down upon
[1:42:48] the earth and the earth is going back to
[1:42:52] its beginning the number eight is a
[1:42:57] sacred number to God like three is
[1:43:01] perfection five is grace seven is
[1:43:05] completion eight means new beginning a
[1:43:10] man and in the Old Testament feast days
[1:43:17] that lays a type of the plan of God from
[1:43:20] time back to eternity again and we get
[1:43:24] the term eight-day from the day after
[1:43:26] the Feast of the Tabernacles and the day
[1:43:30] day is separate and distinct from this
[1:43:33] Feast of the Tabernacles God has placed
[1:43:35] symbolic meaning in counting up to the
[1:43:39] number eight the seven-day feast of
[1:43:41] tabernacles can be tight as a journey of
[1:43:44] the earth through time back to its
[1:43:46] beginning into eternity it'll finish its
[1:43:50] seventh day in the Millennium somebody
[1:43:53] with me now and then go back into
[1:43:55] eternity
[1:43:56] it's symbolically reminded Israel he's
[1:43:59] seven this feast day of the Feast of
[1:44:03] Tabernacles as we told you symbolically
[1:44:06] reminded Israel of their journey through
[1:44:08] the wilderness Leviticus 23 36 let's
[1:44:13] look at it one more time seven days this
[1:44:17] whole offer an offering made by fire
[1:44:18] unto unto the Lord and on this eighth
[1:44:22] day shall be a holy gathering man holy
[1:44:28] gatherings somebody with me now a man on
[1:44:33] the eighth day in eternity we're gonna
[1:44:36] have a great gathering there as the New
[1:44:38] Jerusalem comes down from God out of
[1:44:41] heaven and man now so we might ask why
[1:44:45] don't we just go back to number one
[1:44:48] after counting the seven you know you
[1:44:51] count seven days while I just go back to
[1:44:53] one again how come the Bible said the
[1:44:57] eighth day because zet and you see this
[1:44:59] is not what God's portrayer he's not
[1:45:01] portray in a weekly cycle of time or
[1:45:05] with the vision of the Tabernacles in
[1:45:07] fact instead he means it's gonna is
[1:45:10] showing what its gonna mean to finally
[1:45:13] arrive at the eighth day and what does
[1:45:20] that mean what does that number mean
[1:45:23] let's just look through the Bible now
[1:45:25] for some examples as we look through the
[1:45:29] rest of the Bible we can find various
[1:45:31] illustrations that will help open us up
[1:45:33] to us the meaning of that great day that
[1:45:38] number eight in the Old Testament
[1:45:40] shadows the Israelites entered into
[1:45:43] covenant with God as infants difference
[1:45:46] what we do of course
[1:45:47] you really do too when you're born again
[1:45:49] you're an infant in God that's when you
[1:45:52] enter into covenant with God by the Holy
[1:45:53] Ghost that's when you get your
[1:45:55] circumcision and so the Israel did the
[1:45:58] same thing they entered in the covenant
[1:46:00] with God as a baby on the eighth day is
[1:46:05] that right the male children were
[1:46:07] circumcised
[1:46:08] and entered into that covenant also the
[1:46:12] firstborn among animals were redeemed on
[1:46:15] the eighth day he would say likewise he
[1:46:18] should do with your oxen in your seat it
[1:46:20] shall be with its mother seven days and
[1:46:23] on the eighth day you shall give it to
[1:46:25] me so there there again is it written in
[1:46:30] the symbols of the Old Testament as Paul
[1:46:32] said there types and shadows of things
[1:46:35] to come and then there is where Moses
[1:46:38] first prepared Aaron then his sons for
[1:46:41] their services preached to God will be
[1:46:44] turned into Leviticus 833 and and this
[1:46:48] is at the Tabernacle after being lost
[1:46:51] and clothed in priestly garments and
[1:46:54] sprinkled with blood they stayed in the
[1:46:56] tabernacle for seven days and it says
[1:47:00] and you shall not go out of the door the
[1:47:02] tabernacle of the congregation in seven
[1:47:05] days this is a day of days of
[1:47:08] preparation
[1:47:09] voici cleansing of the priesthood
[1:47:12] getting ready for their service are you
[1:47:16] with me
[1:47:16] a man so he said until the day of your
[1:47:19] days of your consecration are ended so
[1:47:23] you see the seven days or time a
[1:47:25] preparation for the eighth that's coming
[1:47:32] amen the earth´s is going through stages
[1:47:35] of preparation for they day that's
[1:47:39] coming is everybody with me now now
[1:47:43] watch and he said for seven days he
[1:47:46] shall consecrate you now after this the
[1:47:49] priest came out on the eighth day made a
[1:47:52] sin-offering for the people the seven
[1:47:54] days were times of preparation so that
[1:47:57] only eighth day they could begin to
[1:47:59] fulfill what they had been prepared to
[1:48:02] do are you with me now the Nazarite vow
[1:48:06] also included instructions what you do
[1:48:10] if you grow that Nazarite vow someone
[1:48:14] had taken that vowel and was some
[1:48:17] defiled by accident-- it gives
[1:48:20] descriptions of how and maybe
[1:48:22] accidentally touching the dead that's
[1:48:24] being defiled and unclean you know
[1:48:26] because they were not to drink wine or
[1:48:28] nor to touch their unclean things and so
[1:48:31] on like that there was an odds right
[1:48:33] into the Lord and it was shown by the
[1:48:34] hair this is why God gives the woman
[1:48:38] today and Nazarite vow because it shows
[1:48:41] a holiness unto the Lord with uncut hair
[1:48:44] are you with me now
[1:48:46] so the Nazarite vow included
[1:48:49] instructions what to do is someone who
[1:48:52] had taken that vow became defiled by
[1:48:55] accident or because of circumstances
[1:48:57] beyond our control and it included seven
[1:49:01] days of purification with an offered
[1:49:04] made on the eighth day and on the eighth
[1:49:09] day it would it would reconfirm their
[1:49:13] nazarite condition of being holy again I
[1:49:20] hope you're reading between the lines a
[1:49:23] little bit and following with me because
[1:49:26] this is what God does to every one of
[1:49:28] you when he brings you to your eighth
[1:49:29] day he takes the defilement of the way
[1:49:33] and brings you back to holiness again
[1:49:38] the steps for cleansing of lepers our
[1:49:41] other unclean people was also seven days
[1:49:44] of sanctification and offering was to be
[1:49:48] given on the eighth day and on the
[1:49:49] eighth day the process would be complete
[1:49:53] and so the eighth day represents
[1:49:57] eternity when the sin of the lepers
[1:50:00] cleanse when a person enters into
[1:50:02] covenant with God and when we finally
[1:50:04] get home when we're totally cleanse and
[1:50:07] the earth has cleanse from sin they're
[1:50:09] coming eighth day the true eighth day is
[1:50:12] when the earth goes back to its
[1:50:14] beginning it is the fulfillment of
[1:50:16] everything the eighth day pictures which
[1:50:20] is eternal reign of Jesus Christ the new
[1:50:23] heavens and new earth with all mankind
[1:50:25] having the opportunity to have been
[1:50:27] purified and set us apart to live for
[1:50:32] internally now so as I as I said this
[1:50:38] urges our eternity is like a perfect
[1:50:42] circle in the earth has dropped down
[1:50:44] into this little gap of time Satan
[1:50:48] didn't create it but it happened because
[1:50:50] of sin you see it still we're still
[1:50:53] eternal it didn't change our eternal
[1:50:56] qualities come on with Jesus came from
[1:51:00] from the Eternals and came as a man it
[1:51:03] didn't change his eternal qualities to
[1:51:06] be here in the time body and neither
[1:51:09] does it change your internal qualities
[1:51:13] jesus said I came from being God and I'm
[1:51:16] going back to being God and I tell you
[1:51:20] we're only here in the house as men for
[1:51:24] a little short time but we're going back
[1:51:26] to our godhood because we came from him
[1:51:31] and we're going back to him and we are
[1:51:34] use offspring when the earth hazards a
[1:51:39] day here a new dispensation of heavens
[1:51:42] and earth a new earth and God will pull
[1:51:46] that roof of salvation we talked about
[1:51:47] ratios right back amount of time into
[1:51:51] eternity now this has typed out in the
[1:51:55] feast the feast of tabernacles worth
[1:51:57] seven day feast represents eternity of
[1:52:01] Israel from Egypt to the promised land
[1:52:02] the Israelites was set up the booths the
[1:52:06] branches temporary dwellings lived
[1:52:08] through them in them to commemorate
[1:52:10] their journey through the wilderness but
[1:52:13] on the eighth day there was a sacred
[1:52:15] gallery and the future home brother
[1:52:19] Branham explains it this way and bear
[1:52:21] with me just for a little bit as I read
[1:52:23] what he had to say cuz we got a lot to
[1:52:26] preach about now once we lay this down
[1:52:28] notice it was also up on the safe day
[1:52:32] last day Feast of the natal face day of
[1:52:35] the tabernacle notice after that that
[1:52:37] the last day at the last
[1:52:39] after last complete seven days upon the
[1:52:42] earth after the Millennium that this
[1:52:45] holy convocation comes remember this is
[1:52:50] the Feast of Tabernacles Tabernacles
[1:52:52] Catherine places where in the Millennium
[1:52:56] the Bible said there build houses they
[1:52:58] shall inhabit but a new earth
[1:53:00] he's already went and prepared the place
[1:53:02] it is built we have nothing to do with
[1:53:05] the building of it
[1:53:06] a man eternal oh I just love that word
[1:53:09] my a holy convocation the eighth day
[1:53:12] which is only seven days but then on the
[1:53:16] eighth day when which comes back to the
[1:53:19] first day again comes right back to the
[1:53:23] first Jay the eighth day is a holy
[1:53:26] convocation notice seven days only has
[1:53:29] to do with the old creation world time
[1:53:32] on seven days that's the Millennium
[1:53:35] that's the read the rest day God labored
[1:53:38] six days rest in the seventh church
[1:53:40] labor seventh-day rest of seven but
[1:53:42] you're still in the time with element 9
[1:53:44] speaking of the eternal but you see
[1:53:47] there's no such thing as eight days when
[1:53:49] you go back to the first day again see
[1:53:51] the first day the Sabbath that's the
[1:53:55] seventh day speaks of the old law which
[1:53:57] wants to pass away and they keeping him
[1:54:01] a Sabbath which passed away or changed
[1:54:04] as I've said change to one another it
[1:54:07] didn't pass away you just changed from
[1:54:09] the old law of keeping a certain day of
[1:54:12] the week we know it changed the grace
[1:54:14] I'd say it would say it this way of your
[1:54:18] personal conversion receiving the Holy
[1:54:20] Ghost he said I say it all of nineteen
[1:54:24] chapter our 28:19 precept must be upon
[1:54:27] precept line upon line you know here
[1:54:31] little dare little but then add to our
[1:54:33] hold faster that which is good for with
[1:54:36] stammering lips however that our tongues
[1:54:38] I speak to this people a man for this is
[1:54:41] the rest we're not called the weary to
[1:54:44] rest and that is a very
[1:54:47] type of you're very experienced with God
[1:54:50] when God calls you out of the labor of
[1:54:52] sins and I've come to the law of sin and
[1:54:55] death and the law becomes passed and you
[1:54:58] enter into the law of the spirit of life
[1:55:00] and you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:55:03] then you enter into that rest into
[1:55:06] eternity with God are you with me coming
[1:55:09] back into that eternal condition notice
[1:55:12] you've passed from death into eternal
[1:55:16] life not days and times have passed an
[1:55:20] eternity that's the place women gathered
[1:55:23] to that's the holy convocation seven
[1:55:27] days watch he says who meaning which
[1:55:29] pass away or have said change to another
[1:55:32] day deals with new creation not all
[1:55:36] creation eight days is a new creation is
[1:55:40] anybody with me now so see their day
[1:55:43] deals with the new creation and when
[1:55:47] you're filled with the Holy Ghost it
[1:55:50] isn't the law anymore
[1:55:52] of something you've got a key for that
[1:55:55] salad that's out not you know that's the
[1:55:59] problem with a lot of Christians today
[1:56:01] there's still Old Testament Christians
[1:56:03] we've got to do this so we got to do
[1:56:06] this not shouting thou shalt not their
[1:56:08] living by law and they don't have the
[1:56:10] power to do it but when you enter into
[1:56:14] the Holy Ghost it is an inward law that
[1:56:18] leaves within your heart the law of the
[1:56:21] Spirit of God and its nature lives on
[1:56:25] the inside of you just like right now
[1:56:27] within you the law of the human is in
[1:56:31] you and you live and do and act like a
[1:56:33] human according to that love of mankind
[1:56:38] life are you with me but when the Spirit
[1:56:41] of God comes into you it's a new law the
[1:56:46] old law passes away religious forms pass
[1:56:50] away
[1:56:52] ship passes away everything else passes
[1:56:55] away and you become a new creature in
[1:56:57] Christ and old things pass away man and
[1:57:03] said dad samsara if the soul is
[1:57:06] annihilated hallelujah no creature in
[1:57:11] Christ man that takes you once did you
[1:57:14] do that no more
[1:57:16] the life you once lived is not dead and
[1:57:20] you're alive in Christ Jesus I tell your
[1:57:22] friends what is it you have entered into
[1:57:25] laughs hey that eternal quality of
[1:57:29] eternal life
[1:57:33] notice it's that when you leave the law
[1:57:37] and it's Sabbath keeper become a new
[1:57:40] creation being filled with the Holy
[1:57:43] Spirit you enter into eternity notice
[1:57:47] into eternal life get the distinction
[1:57:52] into eternal life because you can look I
[1:57:56] can look at you and you can look at me
[1:57:58] and you know that this is not eternal
[1:58:00] this is still temporal hey man
[1:58:03] but eternal life you have entered into
[1:58:07] it something happened into you that is a
[1:58:12] representation of who you were for you
[1:58:16] go back to your beginning are you with
[1:58:19] me now
[1:58:20] amen so by being filled with spirit you
[1:58:23] enter into eternal life into your eighth
[1:58:26] day back to your beginning this is not
[1:58:30] the eighth day now it's like in a day
[1:58:32] it's just like when the earth will be
[1:58:35] renovated by fire and this eighth day
[1:58:38] and we'll go back into eternity
[1:58:41] and the same thing happened when you are
[1:58:44] born again amen amen you changed from
[1:58:48] death into life I mean no life passes
[1:58:52] away like the earth will pass away and
[1:58:56] change from one form to another one
[1:58:58] moment you're a singer and the other
[1:59:01] you're set to five Holy Ghost filled
[1:59:04] child of God saying to sin no more

[1:59:16] things is beyond that listen to the
[1:59:18] kingdom of God with eternal life with
[1:59:21] the three destinated that never did
[1:59:23] start it never started on any day

[1:59:29] saved a man Jesus came to redeem that
[1:59:32] but you were saved from the beginning
[1:59:35] because you had eternal life to begin
[1:59:38] with a man and that's what happens to
[1:59:42] your soul when you're born again it has
[1:59:45] it's a day experience it's a new

[2:05:57] just would appear on the bank hey man he
[2:06:01] and I could catch fish they were just
[2:06:04] there and he cooked them on a fire man
[2:06:08] he appeared he disappeared he didn't
[2:06:11] need a door to enter in there in a
[2:06:15] locked room up there in the upper room
[2:06:18] the sight was locked up and he just
[2:06:20] appears a man the moment after after
[2:06:26] speaking for him a little bit he just
[2:06:27] goes right back through the walls gone
[2:06:30] again he has passed from time element
[2:06:33] times to restraints amen men because of
[2:06:40] road closures and things bridges that
[2:06:42] are out in my area took me 45 minutes to
[2:06:45] get to church but Jesus would appear at
[2:06:48] one place and that place because he
[2:06:51] wasn't in time element no more are you
[2:06:55] with me he would he would he would start
[2:06:58] right there
[2:07:00] whether disciples are locked up and even
[2:07:03] he fish and honeycomb and then walked
[2:07:06] through the walls he would stand what 7
[2:07:11] miles with Cleophus and his friends at
[2:07:14] the end and break bread like he did
[2:07:15] before wonder how he did him before he

[2:07:30] saw him do what he did before is
[2:07:33] somebody with me a man a man that saw
[2:07:37] what he did before that recognized him
[2:07:39] and he vanished from their sight
[2:07:40] a man he was back in his origin and he
[2:07:46] can never die
[2:07:48] again he had left from time and went
[2:07:53] back into eternity and time and distance
[2:07:57] and miles and nothing had any restraints
[2:08:00] on him whatsoever because he was back
[2:08:04] into eternity again now in Romans 6 and
[2:08:08] 9

[2:08:11] the dead dad no more death hath no more

[2:10:30] of the will of man or the will of the
[2:10:32] flesh or my sex desire but you're born
[2:10:36] the way you should have been at the
[2:10:38] beginning which gives you an eternal
[2:10:41] quality with eternal life I don't know

[2:11:04] day that the earth will have where the
[2:11:08] church was lifted up above sin into the
[2:11:12] power of God might take this coat off
[2:11:15] after all a man might as well get ready
[2:11:18] to stay here I had a minister here saw
[2:11:25] me take my coat off he said I knew he
[2:11:27] was serious then he's gonna be here for
[2:11:30] a while
[2:11:34] I hope you're not in a hurry hope you'll
[2:11:40] realize the hour we're in right here
[2:11:45] blending from time into eternity again
[2:11:48] we're bout this bride is about to have
[2:11:52] an eight day experience and change in a
[2:11:55] moment in the twinkling of an eye and
[2:11:58] that's what happens when the seventh
[2:12:01] church age closes when the seven days
[2:12:06] are over
[2:12:08] we've changed listen the eighth day like
[2:12:20] the Earth Day Day that the earth had the
[2:12:23] church was lifted up above sin into the
[2:12:27] power of God let me describe it again
[2:12:30] just like the holy fire God will strike
[2:12:33] the earth the same thing happened to
[2:12:37] those in the upper room here came the
[2:12:43] pillar fire like a rushing mighty wind
[2:12:47] come on and filled the house where they
[2:12:51] were sitting
[2:12:53] brother Branham talks about this holy
[2:12:55] fire he says just not a little fire it's
[2:12:59] a holy fire that will strike the earth
[2:13:01] it will take Satan and all its devils
[2:13:04] both heavens old earth a man will pass
[2:13:07] away killing all the germs all the
[2:13:10] insects and all the natural life will
[2:13:14] hold it around it and even the water
[2:13:16] this h2o will explode think of it talk
[2:13:20] about a noise you know when a man
[2:13:22] receives the baptism of fire there's a
[2:13:26] lot of noise around there they think
[2:13:29] it's a shame to hear people scream and
[2:13:31] shout like that but let's wait until
[2:13:33] this earth gets her baptism when they
[2:13:38] got their baptism in the upper room
[2:13:42] man it was an explosion it was a change
[2:13:48] from loud to grace and the Turks would
[2:13:51] have a new beginning and they would come
[2:13:54] out drunk a new wine would fill with the
[2:13:58] light for the lamb and my walking out
[2:14:01] under the influence of that hallelujah
[2:14:05] are you with me and there was a lot of
[2:14:06] noise there man there was screaming and
[2:14:10] shouting and glorifying God Amen because
[2:14:13] God had come down and build his church
[2:14:16] of the day of Pentecost and Pentecost is
[2:14:20] our agenda it is the beginning that we
[2:14:24] have to return back to before the
[2:14:28] rapture it's an eighth day experience
[2:14:35] it's not the eighth day now the eighth
[2:14:38] day is the new heavens and the earth but
[2:14:40] it's the eighth day experience it's like
[2:14:43] what the earth will go through now Acts
[2:14:49] chapter 2 and verse 2 and suddenly there
[2:14:53] came a sound from heaven like a rushing
[2:14:57] Mighty Wind and it filled the house
[2:14:59] where they were sitting and there
[2:15:01] appeared upon them cloven tongues like
[2:15:03] as a fire and it's sat upon each of them
[2:15:07] and they were all filled with the Holy
[2:15:08] Ghost and began to speak with other
[2:15:10] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[2:15:13] utterance
[2:15:14] they man who son spoke in one language
[2:15:17] some spoke in another some spoke in
[2:15:20] another but let me just tell you you
[2:15:22] know we don't have any document that
[2:15:25] these unknown tongues at
[2:15:26] Pentecost is booked in known tongues
[2:15:28] because how here we ever man in our own
[2:15:30] language then glorifying God really I

[2:15:36] well as your life glorifies God but

[2:15:47] was the modest sin no I'm getting ahead
[2:15:50] of myself just a moment but let's just
[2:15:52] read it they were filled with the Holy
[2:15:54] Ghost begin to speak with other tongues
[2:15:56] it caused them to glorify God I don't
[2:16:01] care what it is I don't care how it
[2:16:03] comes I don't care if it feels like I
[2:16:05] spelts on your back I don't care if it
[2:16:07] comes like chills I don't care about
[2:16:09] your sensation what I want to see is
[2:16:12] your life got changed and the fire of
[2:16:15] God burns seeing out of your life that
[2:16:17] makes you a new creature in Christ and
[2:16:19] you're not the same person you ask hey
[2:16:26] mom
[2:16:27] now the eighth day is eternity the New
[2:16:34] Jerusalem but that's truly no such thing
[2:16:37] as an actual eighth day just starting a
[2:16:41] week over again but but I want to give
[2:16:44] something to this eighth day won't start
[2:16:49] a new week of time it will be an eternal
[2:16:53] day that never ends racing against his
[2:17:00] clock from Eden so far the earth has had
[2:17:06] six days go into the seventh day the
[2:17:08] Millennium would start over again back
[2:17:12] to the place before same energy the same
[2:17:15] can be tight of the seven ages before
[2:17:19] the ages began we started out with
[2:17:21] Pentecost eternal life came down in the
[2:17:25] form of the Holy Ghost and filled all
[2:17:27] the house where they were sitting but
[2:17:30] about twenty or thirty years later they
[2:17:33] lost their first loud just as he did and
[2:17:36] Satan's knowledge and receive Satan's
[2:17:39] knowledge over the Word of God that evil
[2:17:41] level can catch the key works Levin was
[2:17:45] accepted into the church and brought for
[2:17:50] the high
[2:17:51] Church but in the seventh angel's
[2:17:55] message here in the last Laodicean age
[2:17:59] it is brought us back to eternal life
[2:18:04] again to the to baptism of the Holy
[2:18:07] Ghost back to the beginning before the
[2:18:10] crease and the unbelief of men got in
[2:18:13] the church the seventh angel message
[2:18:17] with me to the last sir Jesus brought us
[2:18:20] back to place not another eighth day but
[2:18:24] like an eighth day back to the Holy
[2:18:27] Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost
[2:18:30] back to the original experience again a
[2:18:33] man LS it not truly an eighth day but in
[2:18:37] tight here in the last age at the end of
[2:18:40] seven ages we have received a message
[2:18:42] that return us back to the beginning
[2:18:45] back to the place before unbelief
[2:18:49] entered into the church before the
[2:18:51] Trinity doctors and the wisdom of Satan
[2:18:54] came here back to the original Pentecost
[2:19:00] hallelujah where they come here at the
[2:19:04] end of the ages
[2:19:07] hey man right here at the last day in
[2:19:14] the seventh age not an 80s now but right
[2:19:18] in the same seven days it didn't start a
[2:19:22] new age come on somebody maa just gave
[2:19:26] us it just gave us an eighth day
[2:19:28] experience again it brought us back to
[2:19:31] the same experience that they had on the
[2:19:34] day of Pentecost before seven ever
[2:19:37] entered the picture it brought us back
[2:19:39] to Paul's gospel once again hallelujah
[2:19:43] now so yeah again again it happens how
[2:19:48] does it happen now we want to bring this
[2:19:50] and that it just says that holy fire now
[2:19:54] wait a minute I want you to get a
[2:19:55] picture now listen something very
[2:19:58] supernatural took place in our day
[2:20:06] listen in the days of Jesus angels would
[2:20:09] break forth from that dimension and
[2:20:11] announce something that was happening or
[2:20:14] end of the wall world didn't see it the
[2:20:18] Shepherd saw it wise men saw the stuff
[2:20:22] have you seen the star have you seen the
[2:20:26] seven star to the seven churches man
[2:20:29] that shows you wise men and men what was
[2:20:33] it to do to bring you not to the star
[2:20:35] the star leads you to Christ is that
[2:20:39] right and then that's the whole purpose
[2:20:41] in the star Turman that guide you to
[2:20:43] Christ it don't point you to the star a
[2:20:45] lot of people have made a star out of
[2:20:47] brother Branham and make him have an
[2:20:48] object of worship God didn't want you to
[2:20:51] worship the star God would your worship
[2:20:53] the Christ amount but now here we come
[2:21:01] you know right here again angelic
[2:21:09] happenings breaking from eternity right
[2:21:14] into this dimension of time brother
[2:21:18] Branham I'm going to quote him back
[2:21:20] again because if they open early seven
[2:21:24] seals the reveal of the mystery the
[2:21:26] revelation they come in this last day it
[2:21:28] was nothing short as supernatural the
[2:21:32] seven thunders of Revelation 10 the
[2:21:35] voices of God that had been sealed up to
[2:21:37] the end time would be revealed and there
[2:21:39] would be things written in the word just
[2:21:43] hid because of denominational ages
[2:21:45] sealed away are you with me notice as
[2:21:49] I'm quoting this again from future home
[2:21:52] just as odd you know and let me perfect
[2:21:56] just just as the holy fire will strike
[2:21:59] the earth that will take away Satan and
[2:22:03] all of his all the devils both heaven
[2:22:06] and earth a man will pass away killing
[2:22:09] all germs all in insects all not to live
[2:22:12] on it and around it even the h2o the
[2:22:16] will explode think of it talk about a
[2:22:19] noise you think that little noise out
[2:22:24] here into something with something when
[2:22:27] he opened those seals that shook the
[2:22:30] country around about and calls the talk
[2:22:33] wait until this earth receives her
[2:22:35] baptism so he takes any points over at
[2:22:40] that beginning with the new beginning
[2:22:43] right here were the chunks by the
[2:22:46] opening of the seven seals come on
[2:22:49] somebody hey man that's what it is back
[2:22:52] into life again goes back to its
[2:22:56] original condition go back to his eighth
[2:22:59] day again goes back to everything
[2:23:01] experience happened it's right here in
[2:23:04] the seventh today's not a New Age
[2:23:09] doorman it's the same age but changing
[2:23:16] from death to life from Pentecostal
[2:23:21] traditions to the word again passing Oh
[2:23:27] My heavens and earth will pass away pet
[2:23:29] parrot on keho Mia yeah again it's a
[2:23:32] passing away it's the change in the
[2:23:35] thought and we've changed from Azusa
[2:23:36] Pentecost into the last day in time
[2:23:40] message mana when it did seven angels
[2:23:44] came from heaven and there was a
[2:23:47] sucker's who ruled out
[2:23:49] come on shook the heavens and the earth
[2:23:51] around somebody with me right out there
[2:23:54] in Tucson it was a little noise and
[2:23:56] compared to what the great explosions
[2:23:58] going to be when the earth is renewed
[2:24:00] way over on the other side the
[2:24:02] Millennial but nevertheless it was an
[2:24:04] explosion and from that explosion of
[2:24:07] seven seals the time for the efendim the
[2:24:16] time without
[2:24:17] the time and breaking us back into
[2:24:20] eternity again getting us ready for our
[2:24:23] translation by sleep watering our what a
[2:24:26] time what a message what a day they
[2:24:29] experience that the Turkish had in this
[2:24:32] last day tradition back to the word
[2:24:38] again we talked about noise seven angels
[2:24:45] came screaming out a message
[2:24:47] man that's a lord descended from heaven
[2:24:50] with a shout you say that wasn't the
[2:24:53] Lord descending it certainly was his
[2:24:55] coming is in three shout voice in
[2:24:58] trumpet the trumpet our bodies are
[2:25:00] changed but before that he comes the
[2:25:03] Lord sends down if he comes down an
[2:25:05] anointing comes down in Malachi for the
[2:25:08] Elijah prophet to turn the hearts of the
[2:25:11] children back to its beginning back to
[2:25:17] its beginning back to an eighth day
[2:25:28] experiences ever cell up and brings it
[2:25:31] back to the original message that Paul
[2:25:33] preached hallelujah what a day what an
[2:25:40] hour what a message we got you can't
[2:25:44] make this stuff up
[2:25:46] it's in the Bible rip those seals or
[2:25:54] traditions man-made duck turns off the
[2:25:56] Bible and brother Brayden said this way
[2:26:01] he said it made the Bible a new book to
[2:26:06] me ma listen he didn't change what was
[2:26:13] written it just changes how we knew what
[2:26:16] was written
[2:26:17] oh man the revelation of Godhead doesn't
[2:26:21] change what's written it just changes
[2:26:24] how you view what is written instead of
[2:26:27] having polar bees in our room or
[2:26:29] whatever it means in that is hey wait
[2:26:31] will you see a double vision or triple
[2:26:33] visa where you seeing three God just
[2:26:35] they all come into one when you get
[2:26:38] focused it ripped the seals and
[2:26:43] traditions took us back to our original
[2:26:46] origin now we have the Word of God back
[2:26:49] just like Paul preached it and anybody
[2:26:55] who preaches something different than
[2:26:57] Bob preaches under a curse that's why
[2:27:03] these systems a manner crushed and God
[2:27:09] couldn't curse it until he brings Paul's
[2:27:11] gospel back again and he vindicates and
[2:27:14] he shows it he proves it with signs and
[2:27:17] wonders to show what is the truth who is
[2:27:21] a messenger sets him apart this month so
[2:27:26] begin be a beginning a month this month
[2:27:29] is a new beginning
[2:27:31] right now while the Death Angel passes
[2:27:35] over we are not in deed either we are
[2:27:38] going back to our beginning so he says
[2:27:42] he would say to Israel you know Israel
[2:27:45] this is not your end this is the
[2:27:48] marching of your new beginnings
[2:27:52] you're being brought back to the
[2:27:55] beginning again I mean you're leaving
[2:27:59] slavery and going up like you weren't it
[2:28:02] to begin pre-bim you're leaving Egypt
[2:28:06] and you're going back to your homeland
[2:28:08] free men
[2:28:09] oh you're going you're having a new
[2:28:13] beginning
[2:28:14] Oh hallelujah you remember when you had
[2:28:16] that beginning hey man when you left sin
[2:28:22] oh you talk about shouting when you
[2:28:24] realize your enemies was dead
[2:28:27] that the death angel didn't get you that
[2:28:29] you got sealed to the day redemption
[2:28:32] behind the blood hallelujah and you had
[2:28:36] a new beginning and all things passed
[2:28:39] away behold all things become new
[2:28:41] whatever their beginning you were born
[2:28:45] like you should have been now remember
[2:28:49] the early church lost something the
[2:28:52] origin of the church was Pentecost so if
[2:28:54] we're going to go back to our beginning
[2:28:56] we'll have to come back to Pentecost
[2:29:01] said well now brother Tim I'll tell you
[2:29:04] you know we're they you know that this
[2:29:06] is not the day of Pentecost of a repeat
[2:29:07] or the return we're beyond that we got
[2:29:10] something different yes we do we have
[2:29:13] more than just the Holy Ghost coming
[2:29:14] down the Pentecostals you know
[2:29:16] represented having spirit baptism they
[2:29:19] represented that again we have more than
[2:29:21] that because this has truly taken us
[2:29:25] back to our beginning Pentecost didn't
[2:29:27] do it Azusa Street didn't do it it only
[2:29:30] took you back in fact when it began it
[2:29:32] even started with the Trinity doctrine
[2:29:35] there's only a few new years later they
[2:29:37] come out with the oneness and they still
[2:29:39] didn't have it right but there again we
[2:29:42] come down to this in time and God is
[2:29:44] putting everything back in order again
[2:29:46] bringing it back to its beginning back
[2:29:49] to to Paul's gospel were that we again
[2:29:52] understand serpent seed predestination
[2:29:54] eternal security all of the different
[2:29:57] truths that Paul spoke about in the
[2:29:59] Bible hey man the Bible is Paul taught
[2:30:02] it we have been brought back through the
[2:30:06] opening of the seals back to not do
[2:30:11] something different but not to a new
[2:30:17] gospel this same gospel hey man are you
[2:30:20] getting tired all right well then I'm
[2:30:23] not tired either in fact I'm pretty
[2:30:26] energized right now hey man listen
[2:30:29] Church you remember they they did in the
[2:30:33] early first Age they were already
[2:30:35] forgetting them and they lost their
[2:30:37] first love and God says remem
[2:30:40] but where you falling from and they
[2:30:42] we're already a fallen Church in the
[2:30:44] first age what didn't take long for that
[2:30:47] for men to come in corrupt the truth
[2:30:50] folks and folks disciples come into the
[2:30:53] church we've been that way in just like
[2:30:55] they'll do in the last days Matt but the
[2:30:58] message has turned us back to our point
[2:31:01] of origin to our beginning that to
[2:31:04] Pentecost
[2:31:06] even now not like Azusa Street just
[2:31:09] representing the spirit moving in satin
[2:31:12] in motion but more than that back to the
[2:31:14] word now the resume of the ages he said
[2:31:23] what about the true seed it will happen
[2:31:26] just as we said the people of God are
[2:31:28] being made ready for by the word of
[2:31:29] truth from the messenger to this age in
[2:31:32] her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[2:31:34] say fullness of Pentecost for the Spirit
[2:31:38] will bring the people right back to
[2:31:41] where they were at the beginning that is
[2:31:45] thus saith the Lord amen the Spirit will
[2:31:50] bring us right back to where we were at
[2:31:53] the beginning
[2:31:54] that's dust saith the Lord not to
[2:31:58] something different but back to our
[2:32:00] beginning
[2:32:02] see they getting a new message it's the
[2:32:07] message we heard from the beginning now
[2:32:10] again service we would see Jesus and I
[2:32:13] love this quote he said then if the word
[2:32:16] promises that this has to happen in the
[2:32:20] last days the spirit of Elijah's to even
[2:32:22] return in the last day that's right upon
[2:32:24] these people and he'll turn the hearts
[2:32:26] of the fathers children back to the
[2:32:28] father's of doctrine the principles of
[2:32:30] the Bible and they got away in
[2:32:33] denomination organization and the great
[2:32:35] power God is to come upon the people oh
[2:32:37] and the great power of God is to come
[2:32:41] upon the people with a masterpiece
[2:32:44] that'ss in their hearts back to remember
[2:32:47] a thing still remains God
[2:32:50] and that he has God jesus promised the
[2:32:53] things he did his believers would do it
[2:32:55] the work said I do show you do also but
[2:32:58] now some of these selya's these
[2:33:01] self-styled
[2:33:01] eighth Agers are wanting to take you
[2:33:04] away from the seventh church aids and
[2:33:05] the seventh angel is a message and that
[2:33:08] leads to death because it's like Eve was
[2:33:11] offered a new message but I just want to
[2:33:16] say to you don't leave the seventh
[2:33:18] angels message
[2:33:19] we don't leave this church agent of the
[2:33:21] rapture this is not another age the
[2:33:25] bride age is just a time within the
[2:33:28] seventh age under the seventh angels
[2:33:31] message where the bride has experienced
[2:33:33] the explosion like the earth will have
[2:33:36] it is a day which ripped the seals of
[2:33:39] the book and Paul the people out of the
[2:33:42] Asuza movement hit through the ride
[2:33:46] it's the death angel who wants to come
[2:33:50] around today and add wild gorge to the
[2:33:52] pot coax and you like the serpent or use
[2:33:55] quotes to lead the purity of the
[2:33:57] prophets message and turn the church
[2:34:00] into making it vulnerable to the death
[2:34:03] angel and I'll tell you what it is it is
[2:34:08] a man I just got a notice moderate rain
[2:34:15] is going to fall in 25 minutes I say
[2:34:20] Lord send arraigned
[2:34:24] my radar in the spirit realm said it's
[2:34:27] about to rain this morning it's raining
[2:34:35] down word the word that doctrine shall
[2:34:39] fall is arraigned and I believe that God
[2:34:43] is receives bringing us back to true
[2:34:46] doctrine because I'll tell you folks
[2:34:48] doctrine will not bring for the pure
[2:34:50] spotless Church it brings us to a higher
[2:34:52] church by mixing the leaven of reasoning
[2:34:56] and adding knowledge hey man now that's
[2:35:01] what the serpent did he mixed his
[2:35:03] knowledge with God's Word and it brought
[2:35:04] forth death in a hybrid seed and that's
[2:35:06] why we're here in sin and we drop down
[2:35:09] from eternity into time but then God
[2:35:13] separate Eve's
[2:35:14] evil came from Adams righteous Seth but
[2:35:17] then later the two lines would cross in
[2:35:19] the hybrid again the mixing of the sons
[2:35:21] and the daughters of men and it brought
[2:35:23] forth an age of great knowledge were the
[2:35:26] hearts of men were only evil continually
[2:35:28] what was it it was it was a hybrid Bunch
[2:35:36] Jesus would bring the pure gospel and
[2:35:39] that's what Paul preached but afterwards
[2:35:42] there were men who began to read between
[2:35:45] the lines and mixed their wisdom puffing
[2:35:49] up the word to make it more palatable
[2:35:52] easier to eat you know a little leaven
[2:35:55] leavens the whole lump but it makes them
[2:35:57] read and a little more delightful but
[2:36:01] listen brother Branham in their vision
[2:36:03] age he said what the church had at
[2:36:05] Pentecost is her inalienable right
[2:36:08] originally she had the pure Word of God
[2:36:13] she had the power of the Spirit
[2:36:15] manifests in diverse signs and wonders
[2:36:18] and gifts of the Holy Ghost so the
[2:36:19] message of the bride age is not a new
[2:36:22] message the bride age is not an age it
[2:36:27] is not even the Naif day but as are like
[2:36:30] the
[2:36:31] day of the earth will turn back to the
[2:36:33] beginning even so in this seventh age
[2:36:35] under the seventh messenger will return
[2:36:38] back to the beginning and I beginning
[2:36:41] was that Pentecost a man and so in fact
[2:36:47] of the matter is I'm going to share you
[2:36:48] with you the first time brother Branham
[2:36:50] talks about bride AIDS
[2:36:51] he says hallelujah I'm sure you'd know
[2:36:53] what I'm talking about see what I'm
[2:36:55] talking about
[2:36:56] it was waved all the people in the first
[2:36:57] time there will come first for the bride
[2:37:00] age for resurrection out of dock
[2:37:03] denominationalism will be a message that
[2:37:07] the pure pure but the full maturity of
[2:37:11] the word has turned back again
[2:37:13] Oh listeners turn back again turn back
[2:37:17] again
[2:37:18] the maturity of the word full maturity
[2:37:20] has turned back again in its full power
[2:37:24] that's the message that's about death
[2:37:28] that we went back to our beginning not a
[2:37:31] new message not something different but
[2:37:33] the same message a man turned back to
[2:37:37] his full power so the maturity of the
[2:37:40] word is turned back again this is a
[2:37:43] resurrection it is not a replacement
[2:37:47] with another message this is like an
[2:37:51] eighth day where all the unbelief of the
[2:37:54] ages are dead and left behind it is not
[2:37:57] a Reformation it is a resurrection are
[2:38:02] you with me there will come forth for
[2:38:04] the bride aids will be a message a man
[2:38:07] now if the bride aged has a message how
[2:38:10] could it be something different from the
[2:38:12] seventh angels message
[2:38:13] it had to be the Laodicean message the
[2:38:17] message of the bride age came through
[2:38:18] the seventh angel in the seventh church
[2:38:20] age so if you claim that a message and
[2:38:23] it's different from the seventh angels
[2:38:25] message if it's different from the
[2:38:27] message to Laodicea that promises white
[2:38:30] Raymond and I Savin a gold like
[2:38:32] character of deity there is a message of
[2:38:34] death and not of life it addresses you
[2:38:37] with arrogance and pride instead of
[2:38:40] humbleness and sweetness and humility of
[2:38:42] the Holy Ghost
[2:38:43] idiot see it as a message of death not
[2:38:46] the message of life it's the same
[2:38:48] arrogance of Cain who refused to repent
[2:38:51] a math the masterpiece brother branham
[2:38:55] would be similar he would tell about the
[2:38:57] bees and the bride he said I saw it come
[2:38:59] and he said after a while here come that
[2:39:01] same lady and he says it see now the
[2:39:04] true bride has come again the see the
[2:39:07] original word again can we get this
[2:39:11] again not a new message not something
[2:39:14] different than palm trees the the
[2:39:17] original word again the awful kind of
[2:39:21] Meegan's were saying I'm Alpha and Omega
[2:39:23] he never said in between uh-huh I'm
[2:39:26] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[2:39:28] so he says the last in the first will
[2:39:31] all be the same in between we got Luther
[2:39:35] and Wesley and all these other churches
[2:39:37] down to the ages but the first church in
[2:39:39] the last church is gonna be the same the
[2:39:42] brighter the beginning it's gonna be the
[2:39:44] same brighter they in are you with me
[2:39:46] and then he says the first ministry and
[2:39:49] the last ministry is the same the first
[2:39:52] message and the last message is the same
[2:39:56] I am I
[2:39:57] I'm the Alpha and Omega so you see the
[2:40:02] first message and last message is the
[2:40:06] same and what I'm trying to say is it is
[2:40:08] changing back like the earth will change
[2:40:12] back to its condition before sin entered
[2:40:15] in when you were when you were born
[2:40:18] again your soul was changed back to the
[2:40:21] way you said it man
[2:40:23] at the beginning come on I'm here the
[2:40:26] church was born on the day of Pentecost
[2:40:28] and this last James sex will be changed
[2:40:31] back to what she was on the camp any
[2:40:34] cost
[2:40:35] making the Alpha the Omega church the
[2:40:38] same are you with me now Paul had the
[2:40:41] full revelation of the word nothing of
[2:40:43] the word was a mystery to him every
[2:40:47] truth was revealed that needed to make
[2:40:49] him at her grave now Paul didn't need
[2:40:52] the seals to be open to bring the
[2:40:53] bride's mess
[2:40:54] we needed those those message those
[2:40:57] mysteries because those were truths lost
[2:40:59] to the church
[2:41:00] Pollard dives in chopping block
[2:41:02] certainly after the first days began and
[2:41:05] so the green would be planted and for by
[2:41:08] the time the first age would close off
[2:41:10] much of what palmtop
[2:41:12] would have been changed or altered as
[2:41:15] the folks vine begin to flourish the sea
[2:41:18] ages would roll on and the original
[2:41:21] understanding of the scripture would not
[2:41:23] be almost entirely lost that's the way
[2:41:27] we came down to this last stage but now
[2:41:29] in their 70s when the ages over and the
[2:41:36] fullness of the Gentiles has come God
[2:41:39] moves to fulfill Malakoff oh and by his
[2:41:44] ministry
[2:41:45] Homa he does what he turns a heart back
[2:41:51] doctor something different back to the
[2:41:54] faith of the fathers by this ministry we
[2:41:58] understand the word it's aptly has
[2:42:01] pulled product to bring its church back
[2:42:04] to its beginning like an eighth day so
[2:42:11] now I've just got a couple of more
[2:42:14] points on this hang on
[2:42:16] yeah I know you're worried I'll go pass
[2:42:19] to it's okay it'll be okay every once in
[2:42:24] a while brother Donny preaches about
[2:42:25] those preachers preach a long time I'm
[2:42:27] one of them any man I'm one of them so
[2:42:33] brother Donny hold your horses
[2:42:36] hey ma'am the messenger anxious to the
[2:42:42] Church of Ephesus was the Apostle Paul
[2:42:45] listen this that he was the messenger to
[2:42:49] the first age of the Gentile era cannot
[2:42:52] be denied dr. Peter was given granted
[2:42:56] the authority to open the doors to the
[2:42:58] Gentiles it was given to Paul to be
[2:43:01] their apostle and prophet he was the
[2:43:04] Prophet masa
[2:43:05] to the Gentiles say that with me
[2:43:09] Paul was the prophet messenger to the
[2:43:12] Gentiles his prophetic office by which
[2:43:15] he received the full revelation of the
[2:43:18] word for the Gentiles vindicated him as
[2:43:23] their apostolic messenger now Paul would
[2:43:26] set the pattern for all the other ages
[2:43:28] and the messengers were chose says how
[2:43:31] close they were to Paul's teaching which
[2:43:33] many of them had most of them had buried
[2:43:36] beds it the closest one to be the
[2:43:37] messengers like Luther Wesley whatever
[2:43:40] there was that they were the closest in
[2:43:41] their time to Paul with the most truth
[2:43:44] but now I want to ask he received a full
[2:43:48] revelation the word for the Gentiles are
[2:43:50] we Gentiles somebody help me
[2:43:55] are we Jews now are we Gentiles that
[2:43:59] what we are then Paul is still our
[2:44:02] prophet messenger he is a messenger to
[2:44:08] all of us Gentiles yeah brother Branham
[2:44:12] was a messenger to the Gentiles of
[2:44:14] Laodicea but Paul was a messenger to the
[2:44:17] Gentiles from Pentecost to the rapture
[2:44:20] and Paul's message is just as revelant
[2:44:26] today as it was 2,000 years ago because
[2:44:31] it was on a temporary word until more
[2:44:33] can be understood it was eternal Word of
[2:44:36] God
[2:44:38] hey man then the last H would have a
[2:44:43] prophet messenger also and he would
[2:44:46] preach the same word that Paul preached
[2:44:51] this is something Luthor couldn't say
[2:44:54] Luther couldn't say I preached what Paul
[2:44:56] preached hey kids I preached some of
[2:44:59] what Paul preached Wesley could not say
[2:45:02] that don't make anybody mad but as Susan
[2:45:05] Street can't say that it might but when
[2:45:09] brother Brandon went beyond the curtain
[2:45:10] of time
[2:45:12] which happened to be Curtin the time is
[2:45:15] when he went into from Taemin to him
[2:45:17] mortality a man that would happen to be
[2:45:20] his death this is when you'll be
[2:45:21] gathered with your promise a man he
[2:45:24] stood there and they said you're going
[2:45:26] to be judged for what you preached and
[2:45:28] we're going to be judged with you and he
[2:45:32] said what will Paul have to be judged
[2:45:34] she said yeah Paula have to be judged
[2:45:37] he said well praise God ah preach just
[2:45:39] what Paul preached I wish a half of the
[2:45:54] preachers around the message today knew
[2:45:57] that that he preached what Paul preached
[2:45:59] man he didn't have anything to it it
[2:46:02] isn't something taken away it is the
[2:46:04] reason of gospel promise back what the
[2:46:08] Bible was unsealed the missus was
[2:46:11] thinking of the book that was ready for
[2:46:22] the GAR but God ordained it to be
[2:46:23] planted but he's ordained listen to be
[2:46:27] raptured not go down on the ground again
[2:46:31] because the cycle of time is up
[2:46:34] we're going back into eternity or the we
[2:46:37] keel over
[2:46:44] not only sound down in our hearts the
[2:46:47] game where we stand with a problem once
[2:47:04] more God will reveal he said there's a
[2:47:07] prophet in the land once more God will
[2:47:09] reveal the truth as he did to Paul in
[2:47:12] the days of the seventh messenger in the
[2:47:14] days of the Laodicean age its messenger
[2:47:17] will reveal the mysteries of God as
[2:47:19] revealed to Paul the mysteries of God as
[2:47:26] revealed to Paul Paul would say I want
[2:47:33] to present you as an untouched virgin
[2:47:35] but I fear just like the serpent
[2:47:38] beguiled Eve and beguiled her and took
[2:47:42] her from her virginity so you will lose
[2:47:44] yours you won't be a virgin bride but
[2:47:48] you'll be carrying the seeds of man and
[2:47:49] that's why there's a in the Book
[2:47:51] of Revelations because they're carrying
[2:47:53] the seeds of another man other than the
[2:47:55] husband Christ she's supposed to be
[2:47:57] married to she's called a her
[2:48:02] daughters have been trained just like
[2:48:04] her started out as a Catholic Church a
[2:48:07] who polluted the word took in
[2:48:10] seized a man and hybrid a child and
[2:48:13] brought forth Catholic children and
[2:48:15] Methodist children Baptists children
[2:48:18] blasphemous names we're not to be called
[2:48:20] by names of blasphemy it's blasphemous
[2:48:23] to be called by any other name than the
[2:48:25] name of Jesus and they don't even want
[2:48:30] to take on his name because they're not
[2:48:32] married to him they're modern woman oh
[2:48:40] I'll kill I'm a Methodist Christian I'm
[2:48:43] a Baptistery they're - ate their name
[2:48:45] they don't want to lose their identity
[2:48:47] they're modern woman
[2:48:50] nor did by the evil spirit blasphemous
[2:48:53] names I'm not trying to be ugly but I
[2:48:59] want to just bring it back to you again
[2:49:01] I want to tell you about a bride that he
[2:49:04] talks about how tragic is this first age
[2:49:08] did not listen to the spirit but listen
[2:49:10] to man but thank God in the last age
[2:49:15] that's a simpleton there will be a group
[2:49:18] rise up the true bride of the last day
[2:49:22] that's the seventh one and she will
[2:49:24] listen to the spirit in that day of
[2:49:27] gross darkness the light will return by
[2:49:30] the pure word and we will return to the
[2:49:35] Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus
[2:49:38] Christ just as the heavens and the earth
[2:49:42] one day will be burned off in an
[2:49:44] explosion taking place are you with me
[2:49:47] it will welcome the New Jerusalem to
[2:49:51] come down and even so here in this very
[2:49:55] time are you with me now in this state
[2:49:59] in this eighth day time this eighth day
[2:50:03] experience what does it does is prepare
[2:50:06] two people who will welcome back the
[2:50:10] Lord Jesus Christ not build another
[2:50:13] denomination but welcome back Jesus to
[2:50:16] the earth returned to the power of
[2:50:22] Pentecost hmm
[2:50:26] brother Brandon would say the opening of
[2:50:28] those seals us to bring back the
[2:50:31] scattered word been scattered each
[2:50:34] denomination had a part of it it would
[2:50:36] bring it back he said that was only made
[2:50:41] possible when God sent to seven seals
[2:50:44] and gave us a sign by since seven angels
[2:50:47] down out of heaven to come and bring
[2:50:49] back the scattered word and then
[2:50:51] denominations and tie it right back into
[2:50:54] his
[2:50:54] of God again to bring down his holy
[2:50:57] spirit if you abide in me in the words
[2:51:01] my word abide in you then you will ask
[2:51:03] what you will it shall be done
[2:51:05] uniting the word back look at these
[2:51:07] words back with the word which is God
[2:51:10] the church and the word not to church
[2:51:13] and the Creed the church and the word
[2:51:14] the bride and the word United together
[2:51:16] and what restore back what the faith of
[2:51:20] the original Pentecostal fathers see
[2:51:23] that had been scattered by Luther's
[2:51:25] group not Luther himself not Luthor not
[2:51:27] Wesley not those great founders but
[2:51:29] after they're going away a church raised
[2:51:31] up and that's what happens even now we
[2:51:33] got men rising up and we got a new age
[2:51:37] we got a bright age out here that's
[2:51:40] something different from the seventh
[2:51:42] angel in the seventh age and they're
[2:51:45] leading people out this is what Joe
[2:51:48] Coleman did he pointed we went around
[2:51:50] higher we took it higher we went beyond
[2:51:54] this Laodicean message and the messenger
[2:51:57] and the seventh angel we're we're up
[2:51:59] here we got something different we got
[2:52:01] something more and it's death there's
[2:52:07] carnage of churches and people with
[2:52:11] messed up lives
[2:52:12] deine filthy and sin because there's no
[2:52:16] power of the blood to cleanse them from
[2:52:18] sin because the Holy Ghost is not death
[2:52:29] what did we say in Malachi 4 would
[2:52:31] restore restore back to the original
[2:52:34] Pentecostal faith as a united time
[2:52:36] ensign 63 August 18th back to the people
[2:52:42] with the same Pentecostal message the
[2:52:47] same Pentecostal evidence the same God
[2:52:51] the same power the same teach insane
[2:52:53] exactly with the vindication of the same
[2:52:56] pillar of fire that struck Paul down on
[2:52:58] the road down to Damascus among us today
[2:53:00] during the
[2:53:01] same thing now quickly Lutzer tried to
[2:53:04] bring the pure word but men afterward
[2:53:06] mix their wisdom and hybrid his church
[2:53:08] and Luther's bred soon became leaven
[2:53:11] Wesley tried to bring the pure word and
[2:53:14] men afterwards
[2:53:15] mixed their wisdom and hybrid his church
[2:53:17] and they had leaven Azusa started out
[2:53:20] designing the pure word and he even
[2:53:23] named themselves Pentecostal after the
[2:53:26] original but men soon mixed their wisdom
[2:53:30] and they've hybrid the church same
[2:53:34] serpent surely you won't die
[2:53:36] well Healing has died a true new birth
[2:53:41] has all but died and I'm not just
[2:53:44] talking about Pentecostal and Baptists
[2:53:47] and methods I'm talking about even
[2:53:49] message churches that true atonement of
[2:53:53] the blood and the bleed and sacrifice
[2:53:54] and the truth of that is all but died
[2:53:57] how about reading between the lines and
[2:54:01] making something different than what God
[2:54:03] originally spoke don't do it don't do it
[2:54:10] brother Branham said in God of this evil
[2:54:12] age he is she has caused the whole world
[2:54:16] to accept the scientific leadership of
[2:54:18] the educational program that Satan has
[2:54:20] given to her under the name of a church
[2:54:22] the leadership of an educational
[2:54:24] scientific program he said I'm pitching
[2:54:26] you the godless world would see as he
[2:54:28] had the very feeling of God's Word in
[2:54:30] her hand she could have took God's word
[2:54:33] but what did she do instead of teryan
[2:54:35] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:54:38] she left science proved to her that the
[2:54:41] Holy Ghost was only for the disciples
[2:54:43] and instead of keeping divine healing
[2:54:45] going when she ought to be now raising
[2:54:48] the dead and doing great miracles she
[2:54:51] has left Satan under his leadership of
[2:54:53] religious men take the Word of God and
[2:54:55] try to say it was for another age and
[2:54:57] she's believed it turn around but only
[2:55:01] brother Branham can see it be said no I
[2:55:03] don't hear some Superman give some
[2:55:05] testimony we got a supercharged
[2:55:09] it's got to be in super Church but Satan
[2:55:12] has tried to twist through wisdom today
[2:55:15] we don't need the Holy Spirit so hello
[2:55:19] we got a seat Jean of God by the Tim we
[2:55:21] don't need the Holy Spirit you see we
[2:55:23] don't need that baptism it won't save
[2:55:25] you it will if you're got a seed in you
[2:55:28] if you're a predestinated seed of God it
[2:55:31] takes the germination of the Holy Spirit
[2:55:33] or it'll never come to life and then
[2:55:36] just cause your predestinated seed don't
[2:55:37] mean you don't need a Holy Ghost
[2:55:39] experience you've got to be born again
[2:55:42] that see there's got to be brought to
[2:55:44] life sleep dormant in you since the day
[2:55:47] you were born it's a you always worry
[2:55:49] was in you there by predestination you
[2:55:52] didn't know it was there I didn't know
[2:55:53] it was there the devil didn't even know
[2:55:55] he was it was there but God did and man
[2:55:58] and he sends a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:56:00] to come and quicken not seed to life you
[2:56:04] say well everybody the Holy Ghost comes
[2:56:06] on ain't seed that's right the rain
[2:56:08] falls on the just and the unjust and
[2:56:10] sometimes the seed will fall and I'll
[2:56:12] not see there's nothing to quicken but
[2:56:15] you that's got a seed in you but they
[2:56:26] are penticoff and it ain't without
[2:56:29] sensation either it's an explosion hello

[2:56:59] brother is the fire God coming down and
[2:57:02] cleansing alive it ages the noise and
[2:57:06] somebody running up and down down
[2:57:08] screaming and shouting and impersonating
[2:57:10] a real a real gift no it's it's more
[2:57:12] than that it's the Holy Ghost coming

[2:57:52] call special songs and preaching there
[2:57:54] will be no preaching going on can you

[2:59:30] the statement they must get the Holy
[2:59:32] Ghost and then it goes away you don't
[2:59:38] think the death angels come here he is a
[2:59:43] man they would rather have an ill arts
[2:59:46] or talk then to have the power of the
[2:59:49] Holy Ghost in the message third Exodus
[2:59:54] brother Brennan said that Church fields
[2:59:55] that don't need the Holy Spirit the
[2:59:57] churches will tell you that that's what
[2:59:59] he just said and men can stand up and
[3:00:01] give you such an intellectual talking
[3:00:02] almost make you believe it now let's
[3:00:05] stop just a minute Jim did Jesus say the
[3:00:07] two would be so close together it would
[3:00:09] to see the very elected if it was
[3:00:11] possible the intellectual tops would be
[3:00:13] so smooth that it would to see the
[3:00:16] people its gospel it's men who can
[3:00:18] handle that word in such a way they can
[3:00:21] almost make any intellectual person if
[3:00:23] you're just trusting in their
[3:00:24] intellectual they would condemn the Holy
[3:00:26] Spirit and take the way of man and I'll
[3:00:32] tell you why sin issues aren't going
[3:00:34] away when you are saying you got the
[3:00:38] Holy Ghost by believing the message
[3:00:41] because what you're calling the Holy
[3:00:43] Ghost is an intellectual conception
[3:00:45] nothing more than a cheap Baptist
[3:00:48] profession of faith that you accepted
[3:00:51] Christ or accepted the message so you
[3:00:55] saved 1964 God's provided way that's
[3:01:00] what's the matter today with the people
[3:01:02] a new birth they'll all dodge it they
[3:01:05] don't like it they have substituted
[3:01:07] something for the new birth come up and
[3:01:10] believe that's all you have to do the
[3:01:13] devil believes himself and you know he's
[3:01:15] not born again there's a new birth
[3:01:17] there's something goes with it hello
[3:01:22] it ain't a motion but there is something
[3:01:24] that goes with it it's a kind of
[3:01:27] unfitting on tasting to the world any
[3:01:30] birth is a mass I don't care worthy it's
[3:01:32] in a pigpen
[3:01:33] a hospital birth is a mess if so it's a
[3:01:36] new birth it'll make you didn't do
[3:01:38] things you didn't think you would
[3:01:40] it'll make you get down at the altar and
[3:01:42] try and scream and watch the pain of
[3:01:45] your face and raise your hands and
[3:01:47] praise God speak in tongues and all
[3:01:49] kinds we'll think the new birth will do
[3:01:51] that because it's God's provided way to
[3:01:54] be born again but you gotta die you
[3:01:57] gotta die before you can be born and
[3:02:00] that's the problem people don't want to
[3:02:02] die and to sand unto their own wade but
[3:02:06] that fire of God has got to come and
[3:02:08] burn send desire out of you and it's an
[3:02:12] expression his new life comes into you
[3:02:16] hey man let me tell you if you get the
[3:02:20] holy girl sin goes away you don't blame
[3:02:23] me Paul talked s Romans 6:6 come back to
[3:02:26] Paul's gospel knowing this our old man
[3:02:28] is crucified with him that the body of
[3:02:30] sin might be destroyed that henceforth
[3:02:32] are from now on we should not search
[3:02:35] said he that is dead it's freed from sin
[3:02:39] [Applause]
[3:02:42] so they're not getting them dead enough
[3:02:49] so new life can come what they need is
[3:02:52] an eighth day experience come on I'm
[3:02:57] talking about a Pentecostal experience a
[3:02:59] man I'm talking about word where all the
[3:03:03] germs all the sin all the unbelief of
[3:03:05] the ziggurats it but not the V it all
[3:03:08] burns up and you're born to do a new
[3:03:12] creature are you with me amen and when a
[3:03:15] man receives a baptism of fire there's a
[3:03:18] lot of noise around there they think
[3:03:21] that's a shame to hear people scream and
[3:03:23] shock like that well I don't think it's
[3:03:25] a shame Amen I think it's a part of the
[3:03:30] process
[3:03:31] when a baby is born maybe it don't
[3:03:34] scream and holler it's a dead baby come
[3:03:39] on somebody that when you're born again
[3:03:41] by the Holy Spirit
[3:03:43] if you don't rejoice a mountain glorify
[3:03:46] God and it don't change your life and
[3:03:48] give you a new beginning you're a dead
[3:03:50] baby that's what's the matter with these
[3:03:53] message churches around here today
[3:03:55] they're bringing more dead children
[3:03:57] their dead to God not dead to send the
[3:04:05] Holy Spirit home brother Tim today come
[3:04:08] so quietly you you don't even know when
[3:04:10] the king oh you just want what God just
[3:04:13] kind of evolved into the Holy Ghost now
[3:04:16] the Holy Ghost is a definite experience
[3:04:20] you show me one time in the Bible just
[3:04:23] told me one time one place where they
[3:04:25] got the Holy Ghost and it was this quite
[3:04:28] easy believe ISM just read it I'm not
[3:04:32] all the way every occasion the Holy
[3:04:34] Ghost came it wasn't that way and then
[3:04:37] every time it happened the Bible said it
[3:04:39] was a noise and explosion the burning
[3:04:42] out of sins desire question answers
[3:04:45] number two who is asked brother Branham
[3:04:49] about the Holy Ghost and I'm
[3:04:50] paraphrasing here what manifestation is
[3:04:53] known he said what could you imagine a
[3:04:56] mother giving birth to a baby and not
[3:04:57] knowing it she that could become
[3:04:59] unconscious not to know it neither can
[3:05:02] you receive the Holy Ghost without
[3:05:03] knowing it there's something take place
[3:05:05] in you there's something that changes
[3:05:07] you your whole system your whole
[3:05:08] spiritual system is made new again and
[3:05:11] you become a new creature in Christ as
[3:05:12] the Bible said puts it a new creature
[3:05:15] creation in Christ a man see something
[3:05:19] takes place in here oh I can I can go on
[3:05:23] but anyway brother Branham said you say
[3:05:25] you cannot this is his word 64 you
[3:05:28] cannot receive the baptism of the Holy
[3:05:31] Ghost without having an experience when
[3:05:33] it happens now you say I believe I
[3:05:38] respected the word you say you say you
[3:05:40] believe I respect
[3:05:41] but the words laying there waiting for
[3:05:43] the Holy Spirit to put it to work it
[3:05:44] takes the lighting of the candle here's
[3:05:47] a candle with the wick but the tiler
[3:05:49] everything's in a table that have it in
[3:05:52] that candle but until that fire comes on
[3:05:54] it'll not shine any light no matter how
[3:05:56] perfect the candle is how perfect little
[3:05:59] burn and everything that's got to be lit
[3:06:00] and it burns and when you believe and
[3:06:03] you're made up for the instructions of
[3:06:04] what the Holy Spirit is love joy peace
[3:06:06] longsuffering gentleness fruits of the
[3:06:08] spirits of bears it out until the Holy
[3:06:11] Spirit where the fiery experience comes
[3:06:14] down and lights that candles then you
[3:06:17] haven't received the Holy Ghost so you
[3:06:20] have to have the experience to have the
[3:06:23] Holy Ghost oh no it's not a sensation
[3:06:26] this is not back to the Pentecostal
[3:06:29] sensation again but back to the original
[3:06:31] a man notices brother Branham said he
[3:06:35] shall restore the hearts of the children
[3:06:37] back to the father's bringing a
[3:06:39] restoration again of the Pentecostal
[3:06:41] genuine not sensations but and will
[3:06:46] manifest the evening light the same Sun
[3:06:48] that showed in the morning light as
[3:06:51] promised for the day so the new birth
[3:06:54] Burt's you into eternal life now I'm
[3:06:57] skipping I'm going down I'm going to
[3:07:00] leave out some things
[3:07:01] amen but I I want you just to get it
[3:07:03] listen let's get it clear when brother
[3:07:06] Branham said the Holy Ghost came up on
[3:07:08] people as he preached they walked out
[3:07:11] women that were buck naked there in the
[3:07:15] in his meetings Ernst in Africa covered
[3:07:18] ourselves under the presence of the Holy
[3:07:20] Spirit and walked out hey man brother
[3:07:25] Branham tells us about the token when
[3:07:27] the token comes it'll make a man a man
[3:07:29] and a woman a woman make a man masculine
[3:07:33] and a woman feminine
[3:07:34] it'll take that perverted spirit away
[3:07:37] from you
[3:07:38] we've got the cure for a homosexual we
[3:07:42] got the cure for sex scenes and
[3:07:44] photography oh man listen he says you
[3:07:48] you take a person says I'm a believer
[3:07:50] let the gospel light struck them brother
[3:07:52] they'll take it right now and they'll
[3:07:54] show results you'll not see that man
[3:07:57] anymore in the tool rooms you not seem
[3:07:59] up there in the cigarette in his hand
[3:08:01] you won't seem drinking let me do that

[3:08:10] world taking an ever devil come on you
[3:08:13] won't see them do that you won't seem
[3:08:15] flirting with other women no no I don't
[3:08:18] care how much they throw their female
[3:08:20] flesh before he'll turn this head toward
[3:08:22] the skies and look toward Christ
[3:08:24] it shows the remedy took effect even
[3:08:30] brother Branham didn't know what to tell
[3:08:31] him he said young man came to me I got a
[3:08:35] boy 16 another young boy said both their
[3:08:38] little males what can I tell him

[3:09:41] get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[3:09:43] and they'll turn their heads to the
[3:09:45] modern trip strip tease a man he said
[3:09:49] and thinking man's filtering he said
[3:09:52] when you get that thinking man's filter
[3:09:53] which is the Holy Ghost it'll filter out
[3:09:55] sin he said God's filter when his mind
[3:10:00] is filtered through the Word of God
[3:10:01] God's filter he won't look up on her he
[3:10:03] won't think she's pretty he'll think
[3:10:06] she's a Jezebel
[3:10:07] he'll think behind those red lips his
[3:10:10] poisoned bangs that would spin and the
[3:10:12] Bible says her gates as a gates of hell
[3:10:15] and a man walks in there then like an ox
[3:10:17] going to slaughter there's a thinking
[3:10:19] man's filter what do you decide when the
[3:10:22] woman comes down the street just like
[3:10:23] that you men turn your head and gaze
[3:10:25] around like that you're not using to
[3:10:27] thinking man's filter because when you
[3:10:30] do that you're committing adultery who
[3:10:32] seven look at the little woman to lust
[3:10:33] after her hath committed adultery with
[3:10:36] her already
[3:10:36] turn your head thinking man get away
[3:10:39] from her she's not pretty
[3:10:41] seize a second that's right she twists
[3:10:44] like one she acts like one she stings
[3:10:47] like one keep away from her
[3:10:49] hey man yes the Word of God is a
[3:10:52] thinking man's filter and that's what
[3:10:54] your soul is still it filtered to is the
[3:10:56] Word of God so it's the whole land it's
[3:11:00] the whole lamb the bread unleavened

[3:31:47] day experience and there the seven seals
[3:31:51] was open and we returned to be in the

[3:32:02] blind but they felt that change sweep
[3:32:05] over them and were changed back to the
[3:32:08] beginning and they experienced her
[3:32:10] eighth day of a new beginning and a new
[3:32:13] body on that home that bright and
[3:32:19] cloudless morning when the dead in
[3:32:22] Christ shall rise and the glory of his
