Lord we just under great expectation for the moving of the spirit what you have in store for us in a midweek service God may it be you that would come and Lord anoint the lips of the speaker the ears

your way now we just commit the service to you in Jesus name if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to look here in Acts three verse one we'll read through verse 10 acts three certainly great to see each and every one of you here tonight you know when you see the rain coming I didn't know if we were going to have church or not it's always a 50-50 chance at even like Tabernacle not because we don't want it's because Swepco can't provide it so we'll put the blame there but thankfully we were able to have service tonight and I want to speak to you tonight on power restored to the church power restored to the church and I give a second part of this such as I have so we look here it says now Peter and John went up together to the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man laying from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple ask in arms and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankles received strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with him into the temple walking and leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking and praising God and they knew that it was he which sat at arms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him God bless you you can have your seats this evening like I said just want to take a little bit of time this evening to kind of bring this out I had a brother asked me the other day as kind of actually was the fuel if you want to call it that for the thought tonight but he asked me about Acts 3 1-7 and he said is this the the third pool in action it's what we see here obviously this was before the third pool because they had the full restoration of the word in that time or the full word but I told him I replied back I said if we believe that the book is open as we find in Revelations 10 and that we are true Born Again Believers that we are the continuation of the book of Acts then we have to believe that this lays in the opening of the word all right we have to believe that now unbelief which is the enemy of our faith is prevalent to try to hinder the individual's Faith to not only believe for these results but also to destroy the expectation that we can have them in our day so you find unbelief is there to say you can't have this Supernatural move in this day because those are a thing of the days gone by but if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then he has to do the same he has to work the same he has to heal the same he has to be the same in every detail except his Corporal body but the problem that we find is many message churches and we're not going to pick this one and that one apart but they have sown seeds of word word word word but they have yet to seow the seed of the word and the spirit and the prophet would tell you the mechanics doesn't operate the church it's the spirit that gets upon the mechanics that operates the church and get it moving down the road but they have swn these seeds of the word the word the word but what has been lacking is the spirit in those churches to anoint that word and make it produce exactly what the word declares that it should produce so they focus heavily on the messenger and they focus heavily on message Theology and we have groups today that claim we don't need signs and wonders we don't need the supernatural we're not looking for that we don't need the emotion we don't need all the hoop L we have the revealed word and I will say yes we have the revealed word we have the restored word but if we have the revealed word in this hour and we had the restored word in this hour then it comes with restored power it's not a powerless word we don't have a powerless message it has power in it but it's unto them that will believe it's unto them that can believe so we look at it the word here the word in this hour has always been accompanied by the spirit and it's accompanied with power to make that word produce and I'll say it tonight what good is the word if it can't produce what good is planting a seed and going through all the effort for that seed to to come up if we know when we plant it it will not produce when I put it there I have no expectation of harvesting a garden and that's the same as it is with many there's no expectation there's no preaching of Faith there's no preaching of an expectation of the movement of the spirit we got the word but I'm here to tell you even theight we want more than the word the prophet of God said they had the written word all down Through the Ages but what they failed to get was the revealed word because with the revealed word comes revealed power it comes a spirit to anoint that word to give it a revelation to make it manifest and produce in Jehovah J the Bible would say all that the polymer worm had left the caterpillar leading and all that the caterpillar left you know this one had eaten and that one and eaten he said the Luther left the Methodist eaten and the Methodist left the Baptist is eaten and what the Baptist left the Pentecostal is eaten the whole thing is cut down but God saids we're not worried about what the seeds say we're not worried about what these insects say excuse me but what God Said I will restore sayth the Lord he said all the years not just a portion not just a little bit here not just not not just enough Faith to believe not just enough Holy Ghost to be Sanctified I'm going to restore all that these insects have eaten down notice what he says he goes I will send back another church in the last days let me tell you we're in the last days I'll send back another church in the last days and I will restore the original Power again there's going to be a church in the last day that's going to operate under the original Power oh Hallelujah somebody should say praise God tonight we're not a people that's not believeing but we believe in the word of God we believe in the power that's associated with the word I will restore that original Power again notice the terminology in which he uses the original Power so that which was poured out on the day of Pentecost was the original Power and he says I'm going to restore it or pour it out again on the last day church so take your Bibles and you come through the book of Acts and you can see what we are to produce yes sir we are to see we claim as messes Believers that we're not another book of Acts we are the continuation of the book of Acts but as a message community in the whole I wonder if we truly believe that because we shut the book because we're afraid of the supernatural but the prophet forewarned us he told us God is going to restore that original Power I say God pour it out on me if the world don't want it I'll take it if they don't want their portion I'll take another portion how W that original Holy Ghost how W that original Power let me tell you it come it's more than just jumping and shouting it's more than speaking in tongues and gifts but it's the power to live an overcoming life it's the power to rise up in the darkest age and live for Christ and be victorious over the enemy that's what comes with that original Power and if we either believe what this Prophet says or we don't believe it and I'm sorry to say that many many of our comrades many of our fellow soldiers fellow message churches they don't believe this but we're not going to labor that point but if the message if the message has been given to us in this day and we believe that it has and the message came and what did it do God used the messenger to open the seals and we understand the lamb opened the seals and he gave it to the seventh angel that seventh angel begin to give that word unto us the people of the open book let me tell you when he opened the book there was power laying in that book there was things that hadn't been seen in a long time time it was the book of redemption and they laid power there for people that was going to have Rapture in Faith Church it's going to come by rapturing message by preaching the Full Gospel of the word and I'll say it like this tonight if this message is not it then where do we will we find the source of this power where will we find if this message is not it and the original power restored back to a church then we as a message Community has have missed it we've missed it we need to keep on looking this ain't it but I'm like like brother B was said hey this is that and if this ain't that I'll keep this until that comes but I'm here to declare to you evening life this is that the restored power of the original word is about living among a people we're not waiting on it it's here I've seen we've seen cancer defeated in this church what was that restored power we seen alipa defeated a little girl's hair grow back that was restored power we seen a little boy never walk got up and run around the house restored power oh we seen prodical come back home restored power it's more than speaking in tongues it's more than running around it's seeing the manifestation of the word and we are seeing it sir we would see Jesus I say we're seeing them we're seeing them we seeing the mighty moving of the spirit of God let's look here in Acts two because this is where we can kind of help draw our parallel from acts two and acts three the Bible says in Acts 2 and verse one and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as fire and it sat upon them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utters now brother BR says that's the Loos and the Loos begin to divide and separate itself and come among this one and that one and that one and that one let me tell you 500 were told to go to the upper room but only 120 obeyed the word and got the Holy Ghost it's not for everybody but it's for the elect and the prophet of God said this message ain't for everybody but it's for the elect and if you're the elect you can't help but receive it you can't help but be a part of it because why because there's something pulling you into that place to be filled with that power so all that Christ was we understand he he empties into his church cuz all that God was he poured it into Christ and all that Christ was he empties into this church and we find that the same light that Christ shined they were now shining the same power that they displayed that Christ displayed they were Now display the same works that Christ performed they would now perform what he was they have become what he did they were now doing and if we can believe this for them then why can't can't we believe this for us in our day why can't we believe he said he' pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh notice in Acts 2 and verse4 and Peter this is Peter's sermon at Pentecost now Peter went in there a denier he went into Pentecost where he went into the upper room a cursor a Deni a coward but here he comes after the indwelling of the spirit something changed Peter let me tell you when you get the Holy Ghost it changes you I look at Silas green here tonight I'm like I remember the kid he was six seven years ago but oh One Moment In The Presence of the pillar of fire completely rewrites your life completely changes who you are you may have walked in one way he went to a camp meeting one way but let me tell you God got a hold of them and he came back a different person that's what happens in the presence of the Ang angel of God it happens in the presence of the pillar of fire notice what he says Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of Judea all he says and all ye that are dwell in Jerusalem be you known this day and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose see people begin to criticize because they were a little bit loose they were intoxicated with some revelation got excited when the when the Winds of Pentecost begin to blow through man blow through here oright Pentecost let the winds blow through here tonight some of us have needs tonight some of us have great needs won't you just blow through here tonight Lord we'll we'll we'll just let you completely consume us tonight whatever you want we want you to have free rain free course whatever it is but Peter says these are not drunken as you supposed seeing but it's the third hour today but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joy it shall come to pass in the last days say the Lord I'll pour out my spirit Upon Our flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and upon my servants and my handmaidens I'll pour out my I'll pour it out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy verse 19 and I will show wonders in heaven and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the the Lord and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved so here Peter was a coward when he went in but he received a holy ghost boldness he went in when he come out he wasn't afraid to stand before the Sadducees he wasn't afraid to stand before the Romans and the Pharisees no he had a boldness about him and when you receive the Holy Ghost it puts a courage on the Gable end of your soul you're not ashamed of this message you're not ashamed to stand for this truth notice this scripture this portion here has a double meaning there was a prophecy Joel's prophecy referred that that initial outpouring was going to be at the end of the Jewish dispensation then there is a gentile dispensation that he's going to do it again it's going to be a restoration it's going to be the same pouring out of the same original Pentecostal power and we find here Peter didn't Point them to himself Peter didn't Point him nobody to his church Peter didn't get all the news cameras and say I want you to live stream my sermon Peter pointed them back to the word back to Joel's prophecy and everything we preach here comes right back to the word it's not man's idea it's not man-made Creeds and man-made Dogma it comes right from the message of the hour and it comes right through the Holy Ghost Bible Church Peter was a spokesman but he pointed everybody back to the word but you know there was doubters there oh they're just drunk oh they're just all giddy they you know here it was the third hour of the day 9:00 in the morning you know how they are you know what if God's going to do anything he's going to do it in my church he didn't come to my Bishop he didn't he come to my synagogue no but Peter be to reassure them and reaffirm to them that what you're witnessing is not a carnal Behavior that's been Intoxicated by filthy luer or drink or anything of that nature but what you're witnessing is a move of the supernatural I can't help that you've never seen it before I can't help but it's not in your church I'm pointing you back to the word it's there Joel said it'll be there Joel said he said he'll pour it out in the last days this is the last days this is what we've been waiting for this is the moment and it's here church and Peter begin to tell 120 it's here that which we had been waiting for that that outpouring of power is here now we don't have to be afraid we can walk out in Victory knowing that that which has been prophesied is now being made manifest I say man aest is upon us oh God L we look here in Joel 2 and verse 28 we're going to look at what Peter how Peter came to this he said it shall come to pass afterward that I'm going to pour out my spirit Upon Our flesh and your sons and your your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions notice as brother Tim made a great statement this past Sunday he's been doing that for 2,000 years hul down through the church ages that's what we've been seeing what was Luther's message it was a part of this pouring out Wesley's message was a another part of this pouring out the restoration of the gifts and Pentecost was another part of this pouring out oh but Church in the evening light in the evening time under the evening light brother said this is the evening time of my message in the evening time the token was applied in the evening time the the Holy Ghost The lital Life of Christ now comes back on the believer you telling me we got the literal Life of Christ in this hour in this day and it has no power to make the word live has no power for healing for deliverance for prodical come on somebody we got the token in this hour the original Power has been restored back to the original Church W what a promise notice here in Romans 8 verse 9 but you're not in the spirit but in the OR but you're not in the flesh excuse me but you're in the spirit it so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but the spirit of him that raised raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you notice Paul is emphasizing the spirit not the word the spirit because if the spirit is in you it's going to Quicken your body you're going to see the word you're going to become one with the word so the key to this entire scripture here is the spirit of Christ dwelling in us for without his Spirit we're none of his well I believe God sent a prophet I'm sorry without his Spirit you're none of his I believe the message I believe the message without his Spirit you're none of his many are come to me in that days Lord we did this and Lord we did that and we did this in your name and that in your name and he said depart from me I never knew you he never was acquainted with you why cuz he's only coming for those that have his Spirit oh you can confess to believe the message oh I don't cut my hair I don't wear makeup I live clean I live golly you can confess to believe God sent a prophet and you done listen to all the sermons that he preached 1200 two or three four or five times I don't care but without his Spirit Church without the spirit of God to anoint your life and without the spirit of God to anoint this word we're no more than a denomination that's what separates us apart is the spirit cuz the spirit has the power and I'm here to tell you it's restored back to the church brother btim brought this out this past Sunday and I'm going to bring it out again because I thought it was so beautiful how it just fit in with my message and so we're just copycats he copied brother Bram and I copied him and and brother Bram so we just kind of playing it forward so listen what he says and this quickening power brings your body into rap Ed condition woo come on this quickening power you telling me my message ain't got no power I want something's going to raise this body up look I got a promise in there in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I don't know how you twinkle your eyes that quick but it's going to be that quick we're going to be changed there's going to have to be something more than Humanity there's going to have to be something more than man-made ideas that's going to change our bodies in the moment in the twinkling of an eye that's the power that we're talking about tonight it's going to come rushing in one minute you're going to be natural the next minute you're going to be Supernatural one minute you're going to be mortal the next minute you're going to be evil Hallelujah one minute you're going to be down here on Earth the next minute you're going to be caught up in the sky oh this quickening power brings your body into raptured condition the Pentecostal people up there referring to the day of Pentecost when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit listen to me when those Pentecostal group up there on the day of Pentecost they received their abstract Deed from God sure it glorified their souls come on Church sure glorified there so they screamed boy you'd be hard pressed in some Churches to get a scream they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it so quickened their body till they couldn't even speak in an Earthly language it quickened their body to a Heavenly language the place they were going oh hallelujah look I'm not saying we all got to speak in tongues but Lord come on and anoint this body to the place it's going let my behavior match the place I'm going to let my thoughts match the place I'm going to let my confession match the place I'm going to he said the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in your mortal body it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies we are quickened then by the power of the Living God not the power of believing not the power of psychology not the power of Sociology or any kind of other Creed but we are we are empowered by the same power The Same Spirit that fell on that day so notice quickening power power wasn't just to change their language brother B says tongues quick into a new Heavenly language to speak to them a rapturing up raising up into a different atmosphere rapturing up into a different atmosphere when you come through those doors different atmosphere put the job behind you Trials of life behind you the struggles you've been going through behind you difficulties in your body behind you the sickness behind you all the woes with the children and all that put it all behind but when you come in raises you up to a different atmosphere because you realize something can happen this could be my service this could be My Moment quickening power raising them up to another atmosphere see so quickening power is more than just changeing of language but it's changing your doubts to belief so that you can believe for the impossible the prophet would tell you the impossibilities Are Made Real when God is taken at his word that's all he wants from you as his subjects tonight as his sons and his daughters just take me at my word brother Timothy loves to tell that story about the king this one asked for a duck and this one asked for a cow and this one he didn't give him that he didn't give him that another one comes I need a house and I want 50 50 acres to put that house on and I need a nice new car to drive down that long driveway that I'm going to have he said granted looked at him and said why in the world did you just do that when you wouldn't give this one a duck you wouldn't give this one a cow he said because he he approached me and asked something that only a king can give oh church either we believe that we're subjects to the king and he can provide that which we have not let me tell you such as I have he said I'll give it to you whatever he can lead you to believe you can have it tonight that's not my word that's not brother Tim's word that's the Angel's word to a prophet whatever God can lead you to believe he says now watch them it was also was designed to give them you know after this abstract it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds every promise in the book is we sing about it we talk about it but do we believe it every promise P Jenny brother Kenny needs a touch in his body every promise sister Sherry I was praying for you this morning for your kids return so give her Hannah and Cara and Isaac every promise we got a promise think about the particle he left home he just spent all his living there he was in the pig style but God so much thought about him that he sent an angel his way and tapped him on the shoulder and said you've been here long enough oh Hallelujah that could be your child that could be your son that could be your daughter don't you quit believing such as I have such as I have if you can believe God will send the angels of God by the way they may be smoking a joint doing drugs it don't matter drinking the beer it don't matter to God the angel can come down you've been in this condition long enough it's time to come home time to return back to the father's house notice now the Holy Ghost notice what he says the abstract it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds every promise on the grounds of God's word that was promised in the Bible that quickening power was given to them to Quicken that promise to them and if it was given to them to Quicken the promise to them in their day and we have received in our day the restored power emptied out again Upon A believing people then it's going to Quicken you to believe for the promise every promise in the book is mine I don't care how big ask big things big things are just as easy easy with God is small things don't limit God to somebody's doubt don't limit God for the naysayers and the haters don't handcuff the spirit of God because it ain't happening here or there and you ain't hearing about it you believe for it you be the change agent notice brother B says here in Easter seal it's the Holy Spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message woo here's an honest Heart Tonight Lord I believe that message I believe your message I believe it like he would said from ker to ker I believe every promise in the book is mine I'm manifesting it I'm walking in it I'm not this believe though I go through the valley of the shadow of Lord I know you're there with me you're keeping me you're holding me you're bringing me through it Lord though I don't see how we're going to come out God I'm taking you by the hand and I'll walking Faithfully in honor with you tonight notice everything in the Bible that was promised is to that believer I'm trying to lay this on lay it in there I want you to get it every promise every promise and when you accept it in its fullness and God knows that you'll do it he gives you the abstract to that then every promise that's made is is and in your possession and the Holy Ghost is there to Quicken that to you oh he goes what kind of people should we be I can tell you one thing we shouldn't be the bored people we shouldn't be the disappointed people we shouldn't be the co- foral people we should be a happy people we should be the happiest people on the Earth why because every promise in the word belongs to me how far brother Joe to you to your children to your children's children that means your grandchildren Hallelujah to your grandchildren to many that are far off those that na you never heard about the message even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so the promise wasn't just for the 120 in the upper room cuz if you continue to read in Acts you find out when they left the upper room many were added to 3,000 Souls if I'm not mistaken were added to because they saw the promise manifest they saw the power begin to live out through human V vessels here we find brother BR tells us as we keep going down in Easter C he said the works that I do shall you do also these signs shall follow them that believe that is the Assurance well we believe the word where's your sign now I'm not say we're not sign Seekers but what separates us from denominations what separates us is the signs shall follow them that believe and brother B says now it's God's promise he'd pour out his spirit in the last days and that's what they do they laid their hands on the sick everything that was in God's promise I shall pour out my spirit in the last days upon All Flesh your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and all these different promises that he made everything is laying right there in God's promise and he said Jesus redeemed it to us he redeemed it to us not for us to us take it church if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit is here to find you and when it finds you you recognize it's call you know the hour you're living you know that these things are supposed to happen see the spirit quickened their fellowship with God that they can even speak life to the dead and they'd raiseed back up I'm talking about a power that was poured out on that day that was prophesied to be poured out again in the last days our day well B said now let's notice Pentecost how they acted y'all want to me to stop y'all good let's notice Pentecost how they acted and see if they were quickened by the quickening power that they were talking about on the day of Pentecost they were all waiting up there kind of like where we're doing T night waiting in themselves they were afraid the Jews they just you know he said they just what they were going to do they they were scared but what happened when the quicking power fell from heaven there was a bravery set upon them there was something an understanding there wasn't too they wasn't too sure in a few hours before but you know they they had been he said they had died but here on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit the abstract upon the Believers now he said that made them part of the Resurrection made him part of this Fellowship the Holy Ghost came and confirmed it to them and they would be raised up because why they were potentially raised with them from cowards to brave men and no matter if you got a ba a DD d a dou l d a q s t it don't mean anything to God you can out quote the quot is person you want to quote it doesn't matter you can recite the entire book of Hebrews it doesn't matter but till a man gets on the backside of The Burning Sands of the de and meets God face to face he has no right to stand behind this sacred desk we have seen men anointed men we've seen gifted men and the Bible says gifts and callings are without repentance we've seen gifted men great Orchard speak and it seems like they move the people those same men today have turned their backs on this message those men today sum in pedophile Su in pornography some in homosexuality many of them back in sin but what am I telling you if you ever meet God you ever get filled with the Holy Ghost there ain't no worry about going back you can't go back to that lifestyle there's no pull for that lifestyle there's no desire for that lifestyle that's why we want anointed preachers not just great teachers teachers have their place long as they're anointed teachers not just evangelist who can fire up a crowd we want evangelist that are anointed evangelists that had met God Peter and John here we find them in Acts three brother Braham said they just left Pentecost four days from that great outpouring could you imagine man could you imagine the excitement could you imagine the overwhelming power and just the sense of urgency that these two men walked with it's like coming out of one of our great meetings you come to that prayer line all of a sudden power of God rushes over you and gives you what you need man you ready to face any devil well Peter and John just left Pentecost just got it changed from a coward to a brave man from a liar from a deceiver from a dener from a cursor to the spokesman of the church and what was he doing he wasn't going to work John wasn't going to work they were going back to a place of worship they couldn't get enough Gods woo man boy you can't preach at of many messes churches so of them want man they got they ran out of peanut butter and they got a toothache and they got this but they just got inow and here they go on the way to church to begin to worship God and they met a lame man the Bible says he was lay from his mother's womb 40 something years old and daily he had to be carried and placed in his spot CU see they all had spots in that day this is where you're going to be seated and this is where you're going to do your begging and your arms giving and they would typically place them either at intersections on highways or Temple worship things like that so they can see a lot of people and what we find here Peter he cut a man's ear off Lord wherever you go I'm going to go he was so vicious and he was overwhelmed but the first strike of trouble he denied him I don't know this man but something happened in the upper room something changed him brother Daryl something completely Revolution his makeup and let me tell you it has to do us the same you can't just say well I go to Tim puis church and I always go into a message Church you got to meet this change you got to meet the power that changed Peter you got to meet that same power that's going to Rapture your body claiming Tim prud as your pastor claiming this one as your church this one is your daddy and the he's a deacon here and all that that has nothing to do with it you got to meet him whether you're young you're old you got to meet Christ notice when he come out of that Upper Room it changed his walk it changed his talk it changed his life it made a real Son of God out of him it put a boldness in there where they he was ashamed of the message at one point but the power of Pentecost changed and transformed Peter's life and I'm here to tell you that same power in this hour it's got to transform Our Lives it's got to transform our thinking and we got to be transformed and conf formed not to the world but transformed by the renewing of our minds in this message in Christ Peter and John went up there to the temple acts three in verse one and a certain lame man from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that enter the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple he asked of arms y'all see them people at Walmart ringing her Bell what do you do you know they they were they was on this side when you went in so you go on the other side come on he's asking arms this is the only thing he's ever known he was a beggar always been a beggar this he paid his bills this is how he made a living this is how he took care of his family but there's something different about that day there was something different about that day maybe it was February 12th that day Peter and John was going to the church to worship instead of turning their back on them Bible says Peter's fastened his eyes on them begin to look at them begin to look at the situation brother the Tim it looked impossible look at this man this is what he's always done oh Peter begins to recall what did Joel say not only did he say I'm GNA pour out my spirit Upon Our flesh and this is going to happen with your old men this is going to happen with your young men this is what's going to happen with the ma service but we find in joob 2:32 he said and it shall come to pass that whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered shall be delivered job begins to wind this entire Supernatural prophecy up with whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord and hear this beggar maybe he wasn't calling on the name of the Lord with his mortal L but something in his Spirit was calling out I want to change I want to change and maybe you're here tonight as a beggar maybe you've been lame in your your spirit realm but something's calling out tonight I want to change I don't want to stay here I don't want to be the same beggar I don't want to come back notice what Peter tells him in Acts three he's acts three and verse four Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look look on us now we had to feel day with that one but I'm going to go past this look on us take your eyes off of your problem it'll do some of you some good tonight take your eyes off the problem put it on the promise take your eyes off of your begging put your eyes on me look on us see Peter knew he was different and when you know you're different you're not afraid to share it with anybody I've been helping back out at the hospital and there was a new girl there who uh is in the AP apartment she came in last week and she said look I I just wanted to tell you that they found something on my brain and they found a little tumor or whatnot on my brain and I'm not sure what's going to happen and we're going to go in for some tests and different things of that nature and I rose up out of my seat I said you I'll tell you what I said I'm a holy ghost fi preacher and I said I believe in the power of the Supernatural and I laid hands on her and I began to pray the prayer of faith I wasn't ashamed of this message I wasn't ashamed of this gospel you say well it's just to the messages no it's not to just message Believers it's to whosoever will I had enough Faith to believe and she came in my office today and she said look I just want to tell you we got the results back either they going to either uh let it go on and be the same or they're going to take they're going to drill a hole in my scalp and they're going to drain it or they going to open it up and remove it I said well don't don't you fear I said the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God you can have it and I begin to show her in the word that by his stripes your already healed pointed back to the word I invited her to church tonight she didn't make it I don't think but that's okay maybe we'll see them at some point but you never know why God places you in a place God placed that beggar there but he had a Peter and a John come by one day and God placed me there and placed her there she just started about two months ago place and it may be for her Deliverance for the supernatural God to move upon that soul and begin to come down upon her more than just just a brain surgery but a heart surgery we don't know who the last seed is but I can tell you God Don't Make Mistakes God will place you where he needs you you just got to be utilized when he places you there you can't be afraid to speak you can't be afraid to say such as I have such as I have I'll give it to you I didn't have no abilities to do brain surgery still don't today but such as I have I got Bulldog face sister Linda it don't matter we'll grab on and we ain't letting go we're going to believe notice let me keep going so with the restored word comes restored power and though we don't seek signs and wonders the power that lays in this word will prod produce it in your life and the prophet said it's the Assurance of a promise it's the Assurance of the promise so Christ is among us then what he performed in that day he has to perform in this day can I ask you as a message believer tonight take the key out of your pocket and want you unhandcuff the Holy Spirit tonight tonight just take the handcuffs off of them I was reading it again just the other day brother BR said I believe there's things that God can do that's not even written in the Bible he said when Moses raised a brass serpent on the pole they never they never had it done before maybe many of them came Moses what are you doing why we've never done this he said God told me to do it but today we get so carnal we get so clicky so handcuffed the Holy Spirit we don't see it it ain't never been done and it ain't never been spoke of we don't think God can do it let the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost one time let them move in the church let them move in your house let them move in your marriage let them move in your home let the Holy Ghost do what he declares he can do take the handcuffs off the spirit restore power back to the church brother B says we got untapped resources of God at our hands come on church either you believe that or you don't untapped resources we're Sons and Daughters of God God made man he made him in he made him a God he gave him dominion over the Earth but his Fallen estate dropped that oh but what they lost by Adam it was restored by Christ he said if you say to this mountain be moved and not doubt in your heart but believe that which you what you as shall come to pass you can have what You' said all things whatsoever you desire When you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it amen He restored to us all that was lost in Adam instead of advancing on and see what God promised a lot of times we want to look back and see what that one said about it this is your Prophet Queen of Sheba he said let's not look back back look forward keep moving on well I just need to see what this brother what this church says about it I'm going to stream in and see what they're preaching no just keep moving on God gave you a gifted ministry here you ain't got to go looking around somewhere else don't be looking at what this one says that one says it don't matter what they say God gave you a Shepherd to Shepherd you right into the Rapture quit listening to all the other voices listen to the voice that's right here preaching Faith to you tonight I'm going to go on just a little bit further if you say to this mountain be moved and not doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have whatsoever you said no conditions it's not it's just unlimited whatever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it then you shall have them whatsoever Divine Healing joy peace anything amen and Paul would tell us in 1 Corinthians 2 and verse four my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God so Paul the first church age messenger established the church not just on merely the word but the word in power the word with spirit and I believe the last last day messenger said I preach exactly what Paul preached establish this Gentile Bride on not just the word but the word with power the word with Spirit mechanics and Dynamics my brother tell I'm not nature that way that's fine it's okay just get loose one time let the Holy Ghost let the dynamic strike you don't put handcuffs on it let me just keep going here he says we must cope our lives and focus it into the word of God if you talking about a camera you got to focus know sometimes you get out of vision and you got four or five things but you got to focus it says focus it right on the word of God not on man not on certain Dynamic Ministries not on gifts focus it on the word take it back back to the word he said then the church would be moving on without friction without hurt without harm without doubts without Scruples without friction it would be moving in the power of the word of God manifesting every divine blessing that God promised to it if it just do that just focus just focus sometimes we come and sometimes you have to plow huh brother Tim man it just takes forever to get you to focus so try to get you to focus you got you got your mind start on everything work tomorrow and this problem and that problem and this hurt and that hurt but just get focused get your focus off your condition get your focus off your lameness get your focus off of what's going on all the drama around you get focused on the word and the promise for you some of you been waiting for God to move he's here to move for you tonight notice Peter and John didn't just look at this Lane man but they put what they received four days prior to action it was more than just a confession see brother BR would tell us in God's identifying himself by his characteristics it's identified by his word then it's it's his characteristics proves what it is it's God In Action again greater than Solomon is here a real believer wants to see God in action come on even light what do you want to see tonight we don't want to see cold formal sleepy people we want to see God we want to see the Living God In Action in our midst we want to see the supernatural we want to see the prodical come back we want to see cancer defeated we want to see alopecia defeated we want to see the supernatural we want to see God in action not man in action not this in action but God In Action we're not here to draw people to our s Kingdom building we're here to draw people to God put him in action so I challenge your faith what is it when the prophet saw that he was in the presence of God he humbled himself talking about Isaiah look first he humbled himself then the fire cleansed him and after the fire cleansed him then he was then he was a cleansed Isaiah when he had heard the voice of God who will go for me he went into action come on Holy Ghost believers who will go for him tonight ah I want to be put in action he says here I am send me he said that was a call of a clean Isaiah after the Holy Ghost had cleansed him he didn't need any Seminary experience he didn't need any book of experience he had been cleansed by the fire of God and called into action what was it he said when he seen God In Action he went in action when we see God in action it's time for the church to get into action and be examples of what God is do you believe that see get into action not in action let me let me just bring this down not in the action of destroying this church and throwing accusations over this church because we see things different we're going to always probably see things different we're not in the action of throwing this one and hurting this one and destroying their Ministry and destroying this church for what it does no get into action building up the people around you restored promise you say well brother Joe I don't I don't believe in all this Supernatural bit that's going on it just seems like a lot of hoopla and fluffy fluffy stuff and a lot of emotion what did Gil you tell those great men he said Brothers we've seen this man come and it went in destruction we've seen this man come and it went in destruction the people perish if this is not of God if what I'm preaching to you about tonight the supernatural restored power among a living bride if it's not of God it will come to not but don't be found found fighting against the spirit don't be found fighting against the power that's been released in this day to change your body say Lord I believe but help thou my unbelief don't be one look Jesus said I don't do these works it's the father in me that do these works so it's not man that's doing these works you see things happen at this camp meeting and God uses this brother here and this brother here and you know we got to the point where we get jealous over who God uses brother Brown makes a statement here he says you know what it's like a man with a football you know he's on your team and if he ain't in my church or he ain't my my assembly or this that or the other we want to run and grab the football out of his hand because he's running with and doing a great job and he said we're just we're so clumsy we stumble over a carpet with flowers on it I got a quote because it ain't my Church it ain't me it ain't my gift and we just get so carnal with the gifts that God choose to use God chooses you to use man man is God's agent he said instead of sitting there fighting against it put your shoulder to the wheel and get behind it take God that's who you're using we're going to amen it you want to use this brother amen God use him tear the devil's Kingdom down man has got a ball don't take it out of his hands he said try to guard him but instead of that because he don't belong to our organization we want to try to take it away from him oh come on Peter and John I got to close this out say look on us look on us Peter wasn't trying to make something of himself he wasn't trying to build his own kingdom he didn't had no church to take that too he said look on us he was telling him take your eyes off this problem for just a minute take your eyes off your symptoms for just a few more minutes service is about to be over some of you been wanting something from God for a long time 40 Years of his life he was 40 something years old he was placed daily somebody s Vicki had to take this man and set him there so that he could provide for his family daily being at somebody else's Mercy I got to get to that spot and some of you come and you sit in the same spot with the same need the same struggle the same desire maybe not calling out with your voice and your spirit is calling out I need help I need something from God maybe a young girl going through some some adolescent ages and calling out little rebellious Spirit she don't want to be that way some young boy looking at things he shouldn't be looking at calling out I don't want to do that anymore lame your spirit's been crippled by the devil but see Peter said look on me for just a few more minutes take your eyes off of what's going to happen when we walk out of that service put your eyes on me see Peter knew that what he had just received it wasn't just for him but he was so overtaken by the power of the holy spirit that he wanted to give it to somebody else he wanted to share this power this experience to share it with those on the street share it with those on the job share it with those at work or those at school see Peter and John went into action they didn't sit around brother Tim and have a debate with that lame man oh let me show you what the prophet said here let me show you what the prophet said here let me show you no they produced they produced Jo 228 they manifested the word cuz it was radiating from them see Peter was about to offer this man something he's never seen before he may have heard about the supernatural Miracles that Jesus did and after Jesus was crucified the Miracles were no more so they thought but one day this day was a different day than any other day this day he was going to be changed this day will be immortalized through the anals of the Bible the men and 2,000 years later reading about it today this day was a set aart day oh brother Derek this day was the last day he would ever be put in place this day is the last service that he would ever had to beg again for his food he never had to beg for a job he never had to beg for healing this was the last day and all because two men not worried about their Kingdom not worried about their Ministry they just trying to get Christ out there to the people look on us Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None let me tell you Peter just went full time in the ministry he ain't had a whole lot of money he gave up fishing to preach this message he didn't have much to offer this guy and he knew that if he went and gave him a daeri oh he may get a porcel of bread for that day but he'd be right back in that same spot he'd be right back brother Tim begging again for the next meal to provide for his girls to provide for his children to get his wife a new outfit well Peter said and Silver and Gold Have I None oh I love this notice the man looked at Peter he gave the Bible says that he gave heed to them expecting he was going to receive something no doubt he began brother Johnny to reach his hand out oh these two guys they got it they loaded sometimes that's what we think about people don't we man they loaded we don't know what they going through Peter wasn't loaded with money but he was loaded with power he unpacked so he could be filled up Peter knew that that same power that he'd receive would be the same power that would raise that lame man to his feet and this day was going to be different this day was going to be lifechanging brother Bram said the church has got to lift itself up in the power of God we're too close to the end now and I believe the church is in a condition where we can teach a little deeper things and rub some of the make belief out and get into some real things hey can we tonight Church oh we love the soar in the heavenlies I love the word I like it I man look I took Eight Pages of notes this past Sunday I enjoy the word but I also like it when it's preached right here where I live I like when it's come knocking on my doorstep when it's telling me you did this and you did that you need to get your heart right I like it hey I want to make my life right but when it comes down from my need and God is telling me I'm here to meet your need and he says such as I have such as I have we serve an unlimited God unlimited God no restraints on his mercy no the Bible says goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life whatever you have need of Mercy's on your Trail goodness is on your Trail don't you handcuff the holy spirit all the days of my life no matter where I walk no matter what I'm doing no matter how low I hit goodness is there Mercy is there healing is there Deliverance is there the Holy Ghost is there we have a right to expect the supernatural said if God promis these things in the last days we're living in the last days and we got a right to accept him that's right to bring his people together and in Psalms 145 and verse four I preached it before and I'll preach it again one generation shall praise the works to another and should declare thy Mighty Works look Church how will they know the miraculous power of God unless we tell them how will they know and they say see it demonstrated all right Jesus B says has no lips tonight on Earth but mine and yours he has no eyes but mine and yours he has no hands everybody look at your hands man they don't look like Jesus hands but they are he has no hands but mine and yours he energizes us and we bring forth his life as he brings it through us whether it's preaching the gospel by lip or seeing Vision by eye whether it you know whether it's whatever it is laying on the hands whatever it is Christ working through his branches of his church every office literally electrified by his presence then in another place he now I wonder if you got your feet converted and you don't dance anymore out there for the world see let's Pat our feet to the Lord to the Lord I know some of y'all needed a quote for dancing I'm getting there you know you he says you he says your hands are converted you don't steal anymore your lips are converted you don't lie anymore he said don't just get religion in your head get it all over youo well I believe the message I believe the prophet I believe I believe don't just get religion in your head get it in your hands get it in your feet get it in your mouth get it all over your church get so full of the Holy Ghost you can't help but but tell about it you can't help but express it Peter didn't have it in his head Silver and Gold Have I None I ain't got much talk for you poor guy I ain't got no money I ain't got no fancy ride but such as I have such as I have he had something that was worth way more than money he has something that the greatest doctors of that day couldn't provide he had something that the wealthiest men of that day couldn't provide he had a power that would raise up the the lame man he had a power that would open blinded eyes power that restored dead back to life power that Reser thoughts and intents of the heart and that power I declare to you tonight is Among Us restored back to the church he took them the Bible says here brother bramwood Co let me go back Peter and John musicians if you'd make your way that way you know I'm closing Peter and John when they passed through the gate called Beautiful the Lord spoke to them about the lame man laying there there was no uncertainty they didn't have any education they didn't belong to any church they didn't belong to a denomination but there he said but there was no uncertainty about their experiences see they had a positive they they didn't have money they didn't have membership they didn't have an education but Peter said such as I have yes such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and brother man said they had a hidden power a hidden power they dressed like other men they walked on the street they eat like other men they had a blessing inside of them that give them a certainty to know where they were standing said I don't have any education I don't belong to any church uh he goes I don't know any theology I don't have any money the only thing I have I'll give it to you if you'll accept it and the lame man said what is it he said in the name of the Jesus Christ of Nazareth stand up and walk he said uncertainly he said not he says stand up and try if you if you can move your foot not stand up and try if you'll just get but he said in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and he took them by the hand lifted them up and immediately his feet and his ankle bones receive strength and he leaping up stood and walked and he entered into the temple walking and leaping and praising God the
