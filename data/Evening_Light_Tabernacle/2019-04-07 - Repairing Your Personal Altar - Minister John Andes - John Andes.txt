gathered now in your presence we come in your courts of praise to lift up your name the mighty name of Jesus what a wonderful God what a wonderful Savior Lord we love you we thank you for your goodness to us asking for your grace today Lord did you grace us with your presence and so some would say come by here or come by here I pray Lord you'll come by ever hard in life you minister to ever soul according to the need that is there I ask in Jesus name as we worship you today and thank you where your goodness amen amen god bless you you can have your seats good to be in the house of the Lord today and have this privilege of worshiping him so we want to welcome everyone that is here and man good to see you Darlene there nice to have you in service with us and each one that has come Matt and Kimber all the way from down south Texas they're nice to have you in our service and the Blake family again so if you're here today don't feel like a visitor we want you to feel like family amen we appreciate you being here today and and each one that has assembled amen um you know of course next Sunday is going to be our last Sunday before camp and after that there will not be a Wednesday night service so there will be one this week but not after next Sunday service will be taking the equipment and things down to youth camp and we have a very full camp and many many come from coming outside and and just great needs that people have and we would appreciate you holding that up in prayer is it's part of our ministry to the Bride of Christ to have the young people to come from every Church everywhere wherever they come from and for us to be able to minister to them during that time is a great honor and a privilege amen to serve the body of Christ so I want you to remember that and you know also I wanted to make mention that yesterday was a great milestone as you know was brother branham's birthday he would have been a hundred and ten years old you know but he's so fulfilled Malachi four five and six right down to the letter as he was born on the the fourth month at the fifth hour on the sixth day so you know Malachi four five and six so we we appreciate God sending a prophet in our generation to turn our hearts back to faith again where would we be today we'd still be floundered around out in some system a man somewhere but God rich in mercy amen actually did something very very special in our generation to send a message to us and you know we ought to feel a very special people today because it says to and to the Angel of the Church of Laodicea right that God had a messenger to this last age and you were afforded the opportunity to be acquainted with that message and hear it that's great grace upon your lives and we must never turn that down but accept that also I want to make mention that we have been blessed by some offerings that have come from the outside for the Japanese missions so those things are pretty well taken care of for now as we continue on translation of the sealed book and the church age book and many different various ones in fact we're just sending them a list of sermons that that I have laid out for them to to get translated in Japanese now what happens with that is they get translated in from English into Japanese for Japanese speaking people they're uploaded on the hub and the message hub which is sponsored by brother Bissell's church but it affords were that anybody everywhere where whatever language that you speak if we have a sermon in that language you can access it from the web and this is very very important to places like communist areas where the message has now been not just message but since Christianity has been sequestered and and stopped there's a lot of persecution that is going on in a lot of those communist countries even today as we speak countries like China that are really clamping down on the underground churches and making it where that they can't gather and actually they're rewarding people for turning in someone who is meeting for religious cause and worshipping God so you don't know the privilege that you have this morning of being able to meet together like you're meeting together with freedom and worshipping the Lord together and this is afforded to you and I think of how many you know just disregard that opportunity and you know don't don't take advantage of coming together and meeting together like we have the privilege of doing I thought um I thought it was so on Wednesday and I we got you know some some feedback from the Japanese believers that were so blessed by the ministry wins tonight and you know it's their morning over there and so they're able to on a Thursday morning gather together for their going to work and listen to the two even in light tabernacle in the service and stream it and be blessed and and and to realize you made a contribution to their blessing by you know singing worship and praising God creating an atmosphere that can even affect those in overseas lands and we must never forget the responsibility that we have to be bearers of this message that God gave us amen and speaking of that you know we we as I said you know those those mission needs right now are we have enough to keep us ahead right now on the Japanese translations and and God's provided also the way for the brothers to go again and and not only to Japan but to the men had on his heart the Philippines this time and so he also helped sponsor by the Timothy's trip into the Philippines where they he'll meet ministered at a youth camp he just you know he just had it on his heart as we were going we have never been none of us have ever been to the Philippines and so you know right in the moment what we had in our heart but the Timothy and agreed to go to preach that youth camp or the Tim Leonard's going with him and going over into the Philippines there's a be about 900 young people brother John Andes have ministered there and in the Philippines at that youth camp are believing and so anyway with with them with all adapted on our hearts and we'd already made the commitment to go and you understand when you go into a place like that it's a third world country so you're responsible for all of your expenses going they haven't they have bear little or nothing to give back and so it's all you know you you have to give in order to to go and to share and they request that you come and and set up the meetings and so on but then you have to sponsor yourself so in this moment you know in this very moment that the need is there God provides that that the gentleman that has never been our church never been to serve never darkened our doors as far as I know never listened to his service from this church but he sponsored everything we've done in Japan and God had moved on his heart also to do something for the Philippines at the same time amen so you know God works on both ends and the on both ends because God is God and he's interested in this and he cares so we ought to care amen so we've got to put our heart into it and I want to thank brother brother Daniel again for coming to this weekend and being with us in this special time if it wasn't raining I'd love to take you all back out and see the the big units that we've got set up on the activities building things that we have a vision that would go beyond and you know I just wanted to say you know what we have out there has already been paid for in and provided that God put enough into my hands that I was not only able to build this building debt-free but also to build this other building debt-free and as I told you you know there's things that need completing and and when you think and you pray about home missions remember you know I our home missions as well and the offerings here at the church you know to continue on the work of God I know that I know that you can't outgive God you say brother Tim you you are actually you know asking for money no I'm just passing the plate I'm just telling you that there is a need there and and you're responsible for that need amen God puts it in your hands and you put it in God's hands amen he gives you give back and then he says I'll give it back pressed down overflowing and abundantly and this is the way God works amen so I'm just asking you to to be considered of that and just realize there are others that are giving our brother Daniel comes all the way from North Carolina to to give on his a long weekend too to help us in in getting this done and also we had brother Jeremy a Shriner that came over and helped us with the plumbing last week you know these men are giving of their time and their expense and everything else to come and and be a part of this amen so you know there is there is many that have to be invested yes the Bible said God gave the word but great was the number of those that published it so you know God gives it and great is the number that publishes that helps it and puts it out and I believe that God wants us to - as long as we're here and we're long as we're abiding in this place at this time you know to abide until he comes and put every effort we can and do - to the gospel of Christ we could you know he he gives us a responsibility when he gives us a message you know when I'm done too much who much is given there is much required so therefore we want to give back unto the Lord and you know when I'm speaking about giving back and doing we have with us today a wonderful wonderful couple that is with us that's really special dear to our hearts brother John and ease his wife sister Sharon that have come and they they've come and took part of their vacation this is this is real I mean took their vacation and spending it on you to come here and to share things on their heart and and minister to you and encourage you in the the ways of righteousness and you know this could have been spent down in Mexico or holiday place or Bahamas or wherever they wanted to go but they chose to come here and to be here with us this weekend to bless us and I say you know that's really the heart of the Bride of Christ amen we're not selfies we're not thinking about our own South but we realize that we've been called in this age for a purpose and to give what we have unto God and to lend ourselves to him and yield ourselves to him and and you know it's Laodicea though where it's considered self-interest but I believe it's time that we look and say we're not them kind of Laodiceans we're kind of we're the kind of people that put everything into the gospel because we want to see this finished up I don't know how much longer we have but I want to give every bit of energy I have to the coming of the Lord and preparing the people for his coming amen so we're happy to have brother John and these his wife sister Sharon with us today I want us to stand together and we're just gonna welcome to the John to share the Word of God today as as he as he spends his vacation with us hey man you you know I don't want you to go on a holiday and lay back and go to sleep though I want you to just put your heart into it too and and say this is a special time that God has given us and I was to sing the song our God reigns have a lovely on the mountain or the feet of them that bring good news I believe brother John's a bringer of good news the gospel of Jesus Christ that he's a alive that he's not dead but he's risen a man that he's a living God and he's able to heal delivers set free whatever whatever the need is our thunderings I've got her amen hallelujah [Music] I'll just feel the holy spirit just drop that on back now I just want you to know God reigns over ever situation that there's nothing too hard for God but right here in this service today he's a god this mindful of your need and he reigns he reigns over the sickness in your body the problems in your family the situations in your home your marriage whatever the condition the situation's right here in this church whether you're on the internet or wherever you are around the world our God reigns and he's alive this worship got together as we welcomed him to speak to us through a gift Jesus can't be here today in the flesh of the nail-scarred body we will meet him in the air that dimension that he's prepared for us to meet him in we will meet him we already know what he looks like we had a prophet of God said he was a small man look like wooden way over I think 120 40 pounds yes said he had a look on his face [Music] that's so odd the prophet of God that he said he just passed out he looked its way [Music] wept is upon his pajamas tops and whatever until there was so good tears just a glimpse of it said the closest thing I could describe of him was Hoffman's head of Christ and this closest thing I ever saw but we kind of know what he looks like we got a little picture but Jesus is not going to come walk today and a nail-scarred body walk here shake her hands or lay his hands on us but the Bible said when he ascended on high he sent back gifts unto men and these gifts he went ministered through to the church and his voice would still be heard through these gifts these portions of Christ that he would place in men and he would use this for the perfecting of the maturing of the church and for the building up of the body of Christ the edifying building up of the body of Christ and he would do this until we all come to the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the Son of God and he'll come this morning his voice can still be heard he won't be using the voice of that man a small man maybe five six five nine tall not very tall just he medium built the Bible said no beauty that we should desire him let him be using a little vessel and he's ordained called to this generation and you today can hear the voice of God speak and if you treat it just like it was that Jesus was walking by and you call him to Europe you to your need this Jesus will not pass you by but he'll minister directly to your heart and he'll speak the same as if he was using that nail-scarred body and he'll speak exactly to your need today whether it's for salvation deliverance whatever it is he's here to minister to you how lovely on the mountains are the feet of them who bring good news announcing peace let's worship God lovely the my song Oh [Music] the Ukraine all good news [Music] but now please [Music] proclaim [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Wow [Music] he came [Music] he's alive [Music] that's our message yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's alive a man what an Easter season we're living in Jesus is alive a man let's just turn to the scripture if you don't mind thank you everyone and for maybe I'll just bring readings after we read a scripture and don't want to break the atmosphere we just want to worship the Lord with you and greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus let's just have a word of Prayer before we read the scripture together who would just lift up your hand and say Lord minister to me today our dear Heavenly Father were approaching the altar today all of us Lord are looking face to face with you Lord we live in a wicked dark hour some have served you for many many years others are just maybe young or coming up nearer to you but we pray that we would go together today we know that we're in a public place but Lord were asking for a secret place a private place with the Lord Jesus Lord if we could just get out of the way all of us from the youngest to the oldest and let the Lord Jesus come and connect with us individually Lord we are living in April this time of the year when the resurrection seems to be more on the minds of your people we have camp coming up that has been spent so many years serving the bride and giving out to others this morning Lord we're making a little altar of our hearts and asking you to pour into us where we lack or what we need take this little assembly Lord and I pray the Holy Ghost would be very present very near to us that the pillar of fire that was with your prophets ministries is right here in this meeting vindicating filling confirming blessing and healing oh Jesus may we not be looking to one another trying to impress someone else or be a fake or facade but Lord we want to be open to you and ask you Jesus to come and take control of this whole day fill up our cups Lord Jesus we invite you Lord to speak to every hand that's lifted up every heart that is needy we are needy people Jesus take us today in Jesus name Amen let me read a quote with you a brother branham if we could just share this out of a message brother Branham brought sister Aimee I think is going to help us put up the first slide I just want to share with you a quote a brother Branham yes and now dear Lord as we go into the service to pray for the sick may every person now with these words in their heart may the Holy Ghost come may Jesus walk into this building just now may the great pillar of fire that led the children of Israel sway over this pulpit tonight come down and prove the resurrection of the Lord Jesus that people will be without an excuse then heal the sick tonight father I wonder if we could say this morning make the blind to see the Deaf to hear the dumb to speak the cripples to walk cure the heart trouble cancer all different kinds of troubles I like that God I pray your you'll mend up the broken homes and make the ones that's in homes that's indifferent fathers and mothers who doesn't pray give them an experience tonight that they'll start a family altar at their home grant it Lord in every church in the city bless every church in the city oh god it was preaching this on a Saturday night let every minister be so equipped tomorrow's talking about Sunday that he will preach like never before and may an old-fashioned revival sweep through this city Lord may and just may people come everywhere to Shawano here that they might know that Jesus lives and reigns granted Father in Jesus name we ask it amen would that be wonderful if the Lord would answer that today amen we want to speak this morning on repairing your personal altar repairing your personal altar and we can turn to the scripture first Kings chapter 18 thank you sister Amy for working with us this morning back and forth first Kings chapter 18 verse 30 this is after the prophets the false prophets of Bale had gone through their exercises and things that finally Elijah and verse 30 said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down I want to thank God for a prophet Elijah that's come in our generation and it took a prophet to repair the altar and me believe that not a just a preacher not just another Church doctrine was going to do it it took a prophet we have to believe that and I believe that's been completed the altar has been restored public altar but now we're talking about your altar your private altar that's what we're focusing on today and Elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order this is like church order he put the wood in order cut the Bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time this is kind of ridiculous wasn't it do you agree your but you want fire and you're pouring altar water on the altar one time two times three times you're just drenching everything to the carnal mind it's crazy they still think you're crazy but watch Elijah as he was preparing this altar and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the Prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be knowing this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at thy word hear me o Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the God the Lord he is the God how great is our God I pray God consume the altar today consume us as believers god bless you can have your seats thank you so nice to be with you this morning nice to be able to see you face to face I can see you from afar but it's nice to see you face to face and I bring you greetings from brother Bisco for the Tom Ray brother Tim Dodd brother Murphy Wang the the ministry many friends that Cloverdale Bible Way send their love to you they don't know I'm here today a lot of them but the ministry did and so the ministry personally wanted to send their love to you and my father also and my family that you know it's been many many years our family has come to Easter camp our children all three of our children have come through the camp and my wife was a counselor there one of the young ladies in the church saw me this morning with her husband and she was in the camp some years ago and now she had a birthday this last week but she reminded us my wife was her counselor isn't it good to work together so my wife is here today sister Sharon god bless her and we chose to come to Louisiana for our vacation is that incredible I was sitting in brother Tim's little office today and the rain was just coming down coming down us thinking this is my vacation but I had no feelings of regret I didn't have one twinge of what are you doing here I thought I'm privileged and happy to be here today so god bless you were happy to share and we appreciate our brother Tim Pruitt and sister Karen and their family the assembly here all of you many friends that we have in this church and I don't want to begin to say names because I would miss someone but you mean a lot to us and Easter a youth camp is coming up just in a couple weeks and so this afternoon at 4 o'clock we like to come back and share maybe a pre camp service with you if that's all right is that okay if you want to come back at 4 o'clock what I just want to share something just for the assembly and for the young people and all the workers as we prepare for Easter camp I think it'll be a blessing to your heart and you know we feel really small coming to the church here to minister with brother Tim he's meant a lot to us over the years I feel really small having brother Joe Adams and brother Aaron Oglesby brother Tim Pruett and brother Craig buer that's dear friends of ours and this assembly and I really treasure them and I'm looking forward to the day when there's going to be an announcement of that great eternal youth camp amen an eternal holiday as last Sunday one of the brothers I think Kelly Hildebrandt was going to the hospital and had a high blood pressure troubles and there was another brother in our church that has cancer and he's in his 70s and I was sharing with them both this week about how that I felt like brother Tim it was maybe the new body just colliding with their natural body the change is on and we have these groanings and we have these things that we're going through as believers but it's a reality that change is right around the corner and we just pray as it says in Psalms that we would be able to live this life of this word so that our children and our grandchildren now would be able to want what we've got and this is a burden of our hearts as we came this weekend and one word stood out in my heart and that was the word personal and we spoke on it in Cloverdale on Wednesday night but I want to bring it this morning and speak on repairing your personal altar and as we go back to first Kings chapter 18 together and look at this are we ready for the word now Elijah was called to repair the altar and it took a prophet of God in our day to build an altar that's gone global I just want to remind you today that you're not just a little Church in and the road in the hills of Louisiana your testimony has gone global I want to remind you that you're part of this altar it's not just a private altar it's a public altar but I was thinking as the Holy Spirit was coming into the room this morning to prepare us for the word is even as brother Tim said the presence of God come it's more than just a public altar now it's a private altar and for many many years I was thinking this morning is one that's been raised in the message and have gone now through many cycles and years now that our children and our one's and those that are coming to the Lord they deserve an atmosphere that it's charged with the presence of the Holy Spirit and I pray that all of us God would not crown our lives to be just some old kravid individuals or a church that is because we've heard this for years it becomes common they deserve to have it fresh again and but let's bring it down personal today let's repair our personal altars because we could talk global we could talk about a church altar we could talk about a family altar we could talk about a marriage altar but I want to speak to you personally about your personal altar now in first Kings chapter 18 verse 30 Elisha repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down but it was a public altar many around was seeing this great demonstration and it seemed kind of crazy about pouring water on the under sacrifice and on the wood and on the stones but the fire of God came down and vindicated this is God that's happened globally in the message but if we're not careful we can get caught up in that and miss out the personal altar so what we see in first Kings 18 and verse 32 was him taking stones to build an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench around the altar this was a public altar we have testimonies our testimonies public our service and our calling in life is to the public but now let's turn to the next chapter first Kings chapter 18 verse sorry verse 19 God brought elides it to a private altar and we see in first Kings 19 and many of you are familiar this with this in verse 9 how God brought Elisha to a cave and he began to Lodge there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and said unto Him what doest thou here Elijah and he said I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken by covenant and throwing down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away see he had a public altar of God coming and consuming him but he still had an attitude and I thought that he was the only one going through the trial I'm the only one I'm the only marriage that has troubles I'm the only family that has troubles I'm the only church in the message or why is these things going on but God was bringing him to an awareness that there's 7000 if you look in verse 18 God was letting his prophet know after a personal encounter that there was 7000 in Israel that had not bowed their knees or bowed unto Bale and every mouth which had not kissed him so even after the public altar God deals privately can God do that this morning now it's this afternoon can God do that for you that might be approaching thanks to a public way and a publican you got to be worried about how you're dressed and how's my hand lifted up and if I do that my shirt is gonna come up and what are we so interested in how we look that we can't bend down and pick up the stones today say God repair that my own personal alter take something from the Word of God that will help us in our daily life and if you look here in verse 11 elijah goes out and stands before the mount before the Lord and the Lord passed by with a great wind and it rent the mountains and then you see later in the verse the wind after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake verse 12 after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice he's in a cave he's in a private place the song leader isn't around it's not your spouse around or the counselor it's not the preacher it's a personal encounter God was bringing him from the public show we would say and the fire coming and all of the dynamics - now it's personal this is where we're going right now to where the still small voice can mean something to him and I trust today that would happen for somebody Lord turned from just being a public saying to its private shake us Lord from just Doctrine and code and church order to where it's personal and that's what happened in verse 12 and verse 13 that is when Elijah heard it and rapped his face in his mantle and went out and God began to speak to him and verse 14 he is actually the very verse of verse 10 and 14 are just repeated word-for-word that he thought Elijah thought he was so jealous for the Lord and things and he had saw the people in the message are the children of Israel casting down their altars and slain the prophets and he thought oh I'm the only one I'm the only one and now they want to take my life but it wasn't that way there were more believers that were serving God that were wanting this also God just had to open his eyes and now you're old enough now as the mature bride as we heard this morning our prophet would have been older but God took him off the scene and 65 he God needed a bride that would want a personal encounter with him and I wonder today if we could just make it a prayer God give us a personal altar today's be personal to me can we say that together and be personal someone else that is needy of a personal touch hallelujah Jesus let's speak about this word altar can I do that just a little bit I need to relax a little bit when we talk about an altar in the Old Testament it was a place of worship it was a place where there was maybe called tables and saints they had benches and slabs they actually called it a platformer that they put up it was called an altar and an altar was where they slaughtered and they killed and they sacrificed it was like divine judgment it was actually they took they were showing pre-pre that Christ was going to come and die in a cross on an altar but as we move into the New Testament after all of these lanes and burnings and Christ coming on an altar when you and I receive this Christ on the altar then the fruits of his death can come out of our lives that's the altar I'm speaking of today so this morning I'd like to take these three parts of the service on repairing and then your personal and then your altar what is an altar would that be okay and I want to speak about repairing because repairing means it's something that you used to have before to repair means you used to have something but it's broken down there there's a renewal that God is declaring and God is repairing and asking you to pick up some rocks and pick up your own altar as an individual hallelujah God's given you a fresh beginning or an experience something that has been broken but you've got to do something bring it into your own self it's personal means it's not someone else's experience maybe sister Amy you could put up that slide that I had there at the beginning of our opening scripture how many's thankful for the springtime and a new you you're thankful for the springtime I put this picture my wife actually took this photo of looking down a long road out of our our house because it's showing that there spring time has come but the Daniel Williams always loved this this time of the year in Louisiana because you see the lilacs you see the different flowers and you see after we've gone through a summer and through a fall and through us a winter that there's a spring again and it ought to give faith to every believer that there will be another spring there will be another cycle you're just going through a cycle brother or sister there will be another spring time for you it won't always be winter it won't always be cold and indifferent there will be another time when you rejoice again and your desert shall bloom again [Applause] hallelujah that situation is not for your end it's for the glory of God you're just going to a cycle I almost preached on the Easter and the resurrection cease and don't you feel it that we are in a resurrection season let that which is dead in your life come forth when you hear about the altar make it a personal altar so it's not the pastor's altar it's not the preacher or a friend it's you that God wants personal I just have that on the screen there for personal because person is part of personal it's a personal thing and as I thought about the service and what the Lord would have it to us to bring there was that one word of personal because it has to do with the individual your own altar it's special to you it's something that is a person that's up close that's up near it's become dear it's a specific person it's not to the group it's not just for everyone else have we failed the people to make it just for the crowd and the group and we want everyone and we want to speak in a way that will impress the preachers or sing in a way that will impress the masses or is it personal I believe if we came personal the Lord could consume our lives consume our church alter consume our marriage alter our family altars Lord make it all new again for us brother branham spoke the the seals through the March time and and he it just made the Bible become a new book to him some of us need that again we need the Bible to become fresh again the house of God to become fresh again I'm speaking to believers that I know believe the message can we make that a prayer today God become personal to me so to be personal is opposite than just to make it public it's personal and I was thinking of God in His Word and his presence and there's things about God that are private that are personal but today we ought to feel so happy that God has sent us a message that has revealed personal things with God that when the Bible says I have not seen or ear heard neither has to entered into the hearts of men people stop right there but the next verse says but God has revealed them to us hallelujah I begin to think of this and how that when brother Branham talked about the third Pole and the opening of the word in Jeffersonville that there was a promise under the third pool that it would not be a public show and he began to talk about a great big tent who's familiar with this what brother Branham talked about the third pool and then he saw a big tent he said it was packed and lined everywhere with people and I walked out and it looked like I was standing above the people looking down where I just made an altar call and hundreds and hundreds of people were weeping and rejoicing after they had accepted the Lord Jesus as their Savior how many love to be in that atmosphere where people are receiving the Lord Jesus as their personal Savior where the Holy Ghost is coming and falling on individuals vindicating their surrender vindicating the letting go their repenting and God just comes down and begins to do wonderful things isn't that fantastic I mean to be around when the shilling angel comes by a person I just said God for that as I was streaming the service and so sister Elana butts begin to run through the sanctuary run through here the healing angel came by this little sanctuary our hearts begin to rejoice and be happy but I don't want to stop there that's not just personal that puts something in a believer saying I need a healer that's my healer when I see God heal a teenager touch a mother touch a father like a brother on calling years ago and to have a prayer answered of a family know of a mother and of young people that weren't there daddy saved and now to have him seen and have the glory of God blessing people publicly but it took a private encounter of God getting a hold of a heart hallelujah that's not just in the Bible that's God coming down that's making it personal to where someone else can say God can do that for me can I go a little further where the Branham was looking down on the tent and he was looking down and seeing people go in there and coming out healed seeing them deliver and he he was wondering about that and I grew I heard a man say call the prayer line so altar calls and prayer lines seem to be surrounding the opening of the third pole and people begin to line up on this side and the left from where I was standing going down the platform they lined up all the way up and down the street for a prayer line I noticed to my left which would have been to my right on the platform wooden building and I seen that light that they've seen the picture of you know that's always in the meetings I seen that light leave me and go into that building and go into that building and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pull and brother branham said why he said well it won't be a public show like the other and then brother Brennan said I come too so brother branham was describing the first poll in the second poll about how it was public but the third pour the opening of the word was not going to be a public show it was gonna be something personal something for the individual but once it happens privately it becomes public how many has started so amazing then around the world the first pull he would take him by the hand publicly and begin to know the secrets of their heart say they're diseased and there had to be a connection it was so powerful then the second pull was him knowing a person's name and their address and their need what was going through their past and their present have you ever thought about how personal that was how personal or God is when I felt to come this weekend there was one word kept just coming into my heart and I had to let it out and Cloverdale a little bit on Wednesday forgive me it's for this morning our God is a personal God [Applause] and he demonstrated that in the first pull and the second pull it was public you lady back there your name is Anita and you're married to this person and that person in and you lived here and you you live at this certain address and all people right behind her would say oh no he missed her there and then to find out later they had just moved the day before or God knows everything the name the address your personal identity has been released and publicly he begin to pronounce that but the voice said in that third pull it won't be a public show I want to say today about this personal God he's not distant and way out there and we believers today he's not a grandfather with a big beard agent just looking over the banister observing us this morning on April the 7th he's not looking over the banister like that he's not way beyond the stars and out in some galaxies God is present right in this room right now he's so personal yes he knows your name your address what you're going through but it's much deeper than that can I get some of you to come into the third room but it's not a public show it's not for everybody else it's for you God is so personal that he's not far away he's right in this room right now and he brought a channel like a radio like an antenna called a prophet that would be able to know and be able to see odd gets milky over here somebody over here and was just calling on God I was listening to a tape this week and brother Branham it was at the end of a service right after the seals and brother branham you could just hear the people responding he's just waiting waiting on God and the Holy Spirit was just waving through the building all of a sudden the sister just stood up and begin to respond with her hand like this and he said when that sister did that it was the Holy Spirit coming by her way we you've been in enough meetings you know when something different is happening it's because now it's personal we don't want an impersonal God we don't want to become a church or a family or a person that puts God somewhere else we want him to be personal stay with me friends people don't want a private God that will expose themselves you can come in the front room or you can come into our dog trainer come into our dress code or come into just the forty a but don't go any further no no God came into the front door to come to your private life then you say man to that we don't want a God that we cannot touch he's untouchable he's out there somewhere where we make altars to and the unknown God well brother it's just there no no no we want a God that we can touch Paul said it like this about a high priest that is touched with the feeling of our infirmities as you grow in Christ it should become more dearer he can be touched I just want to give him praise today by my faith in the sanctuary to say we have a high priest that can be touched with the feeling of what we're going through what our children are going through what our young people are going through [Music] do you realize we are 30 years this year of this church having the camp out at Dry Creek from 1989 it started in 1987 but 30 years now you have given of yourself and your Easter season for God to become personal have you ever thought about why this year within two or three weeks it was just totally full and the motels and everything people are booking what it's gonna be like this year why hasn't it gone from 800 to 700 five hundred to two hundred where it's just your dung people and a few more why it's because God has become personal to literally thousands around the globe this generation is hungry to have a God become personal to them not just quoting the words of a prophet or reading a scripture but having a burden that that word would become reality become tangible God we could go and we can take a lot of time we could talk about the altar that Noah had the Abel had that Jacob had when you look into the Bible it speaks about how they build an altar unto the Lord Moses had an altar do you remember Abraham and Isaac Isaac was on an altar do you remember that in the Old Testament Aaron and the prop of the priest worked around the altar keep the altar open that was actually their duty and their ministry is to work around the altar they had an altar of incense they had the burnt offering they had the brazen altar they had the altar of brass they had the altar of gold the Bible speaks about blood on the altar fire on the altar do you remember that and there was to be a light continually keep the lamp going and in the days of Eli sin had come in to the message so much the lamp of God went out their eyes become dim sin came in unto where the the very worship in the church became a stitch to the people God may have never returned back to us to our marriages to our families our this church where we allow the altar to be just something that God doesn't even want to be there when we just put in time and put in the little songs and here a little message where we lose interest we lose attention we lose love I say God if that has happened to me or to us let us repair the altar today let us say God restore unto me restore unto us bring back the new again bring back the freshness again can you say that today what I want to know you personal put it in my heart guard the altar speaks of dedication and you giving an offering the Bible speaks about the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar the there was something called the charge of the altar and it was placed into the hands of the Levites and of the priests to keep this charge when you look in Joshua's day as everybody attention Joshua and that bringing that into the new generation the altar is associated with the new land which is a type of the Holy Ghost so when you look in the days of Joshua they build an altar the altars of bail was false gods and the Jehovah God never came down and vindicated that altar it was the one true Living God that when Elijah prepared it God came down [Music] how many's ever heard a phrase the horns of the altar just lift your hand as you've heard of the horns it comes from the Bible where they had horns that was literally on the ark and on the mercy seat that if someone in trouble someone that was in desperation could run in and grab ahold of his horns and say God have mercy our grace having trouble and they would run into the temple and they would fall in an altar and grab ahold of these I tell you I pray that never leaves us brother Tim I pray the horns of the altar would be always available I [Music] understand what I'm saying right now in many places that's been gone that that's shunned they don't want an altar they don't want tears they don't want repentance they just want a little service and let's go have lunch our stomachs are calling you know we got schedules maybe God wants to break that schedule I don't want to be too long today but we do an altar speaks of death sacrifice giving of yourself we have it so good today there's been an attraction to the anointed ministry for the Bride of Christ it's like you can just go and listen and they've been laying in the word for hours they've been studying and making sure they're saying exactly what the Prophet said we can come in and Maya can be such an inspiration do you know that is only the first room you live in a three-room house and the kitchen is the church it's a public place that's where we come and feed off of the word and can you believe it people become so casual about that altar then the second room is like a parlor like a living room you you go from the kitchen and then you go into the parlor you kind of talk a little bit more share a little bit how's your business going how's your school going I really appreciate that brother and what you're going through or your school is ending oh and may all your graduating in May what are you studying oh it's engineering and you get to know people on in the parlor in the living in the living room we can share about Christ and what he's done in your life I look up and see sister Amy and just newly married as brother Tim said this is a reflection of what the message can produce young people that can go for years and be tested and tested and wonder if is there ever gonna be anyone and God just crowned their lives right before the rapture say how much time do we have left I don't know but God still has private altars that become public I would encourage you to this this afternoon that if God is leading you to the horns of the altar if there's something in your heart to say I am wrong forgive me God find a place the altar speaks of surrender that speaks of you admitting I am wrong I want to get into that in just a little bit let me just go back to David and Solomon and the temple spoke of the altar Hezekiah in second chronicles repaired the altar so it wasn't just a major prophet but it's now other minor prophets Isaiah prophesied about the altar can you put Joel chapter 1 verse 13 up and see that even in the book of Joel how that it was a place that the ministry was to bring this altar before the people and there was a crying out at the altar it's not just a half hour of silence it's actually there's something in you crying out Joel 1:13 gird yourselves and lament he priest how the ministers of the altar come lie all night in sackcloth the ministers of my God for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholding from the house of our God or what the people need to overcome is being withholding no no cry out can you go to Joel to verse 17 you can read this later when you go home but Joel 2:17 speaks about this also about the ministry and the men ministers let the priests the ministers of the Lord weep between the porch and the altar and let them say spare thy people O Lord and give not mine heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their God we ought to bring this right into this morning service as Moses God spoke to Moses and said just step back I'll destroy the whole group and it was Christ in Moses that stood in the way and say no Lord look at what you did to bring him out of Egypt look at all their testimonies and what you did Lord if you destroy them then what will the enemy say that you were not able to keep them in the time of wilderness and fulfill your word and bringing them into the land brother Branham said that was Christ in Moses amen oh we had it in our day of brother Branham speaking the seventh actually it was the Lamb that broke the seven seals and then as they went through the summer time brother brother Middleton and they came up to September but the Branham preached the token and then desperation and he said that was the message to follow the opening of the seven seals as far as a message to preach so there are messages to follow the opening of the word that is to get personal with the people and their families is the message getting through this morning bring the opening of the seven seals the third pull and bring it down to the fire please so the daddies can apply it literally the mothers can know the young people can know when they share may see the dark clouds coming through the town destroying their friends oh where is that young person where is that young lady oh they were overtaken sister Amy can you put up that scripture again Joel 2:17 what does the ministry supposed to do when this happens are we supposed to be quiet about it don't say anything about it no there is to be a crying out spare thy people Oh God there must be an understanding that the new generation has gone through 10 times what we went through there must be an understanding that the word is gonna connect with them amos spoke about this thank you sister Amy Zechariah if you could bring back up that side Zechariah spoke about the altar do you know that Malachi spoke about the altar let's bring it into the New Testament quickly Paul in Hebrews 13 verse 10 said we have an altar - some would say oh that's Old Testament Christ is our altar amen Paul said we have an altar in revelations chapter 6 verse 9 the Bible says their souls under the altar under the fifth seal souls under the altar later in the Book of Revelations there's voices that are come out of the altar so from Genesis to Revelation it speaks of an altar can I bring it now to this morning to us as believers we've got to have a personal altar I pray God would touch our hearts as believers more and more as we see the Day approaching that our services and our meetings would have God connecting with our prayer life if you're making notes it's part of our personal altars you say I don't even hardly have one brother John I really don't know what you're talking about God restore our prayer life pick up that rock that's fallen off and do something today and say God I want that to be restored in my life can we do that friends some of you know what I'm talking about repairing the altar bringing it back to where it ought to be not a public show but for you as a person to say I need that more in my life let's be real today but the brothers should you ministers and you pastors know that you don't pray as much as your father's did he said you mothers and fathers no you don't pray like your mother and your father did you know what we just need to say that's the truth and don't get all condemned about it just lift up the rock today and say God I want that place to become more dear to me what about the Word of God we know it's true we know it's read your Bible and pray every day but friends have we lost something say brother John yeah it's true I hardly read my Bible I hardly get into the message myself pick that rock up today just pick it up say it's just a little rock a little scripture you got five minutes you got ten minutes you got half an hour you listen to the news or you read this newspaper you look at that article or it's just silent in your home God's giving you the opportunity to listen to a word listen to a message what about our personal surrender and our dedication I want to rebuild that today lord surrounding our lives with the right atmosphere you have a choice of your friends you can't choose your family but you can choose your friends amen so if you say I'm building the altar then get around people that love God and are positive and let me encourage you you'll be a positive person we only have one life I'm speaking about an altar today say that's not always fun and games up on an altar where there's blood and screaming and crying you're exactly right but well there can be more of a sacrifice of praise even when you don't feel like it like maybe Paul and Silas in in a prison cell they've been whipped and whipped they could have got grumpy and texting one another how do you feel how do you feel man I'm hurting oh man he got into the muscle on that one they were praising they were shouting but we've received the third poll and we've gone through the ages now in the opening of the word then there ought to be some men and women that might feel like they're in the stocks financially or emotionally or health-wise if this is go but there ought to be a praise you say I don't know brother John you're preaching away out there I'm coming right down to you God can create that and give you a love for the things of God that's personal what about the body of Christ and the people of God that we should love and daily living in his presence and walking in a love affair do you know that from Genesis to Revelation over 300 times the word altar is mentioned in the Bible brother Branham it mentions the word altar 2488 times in the message is that a lot that's almost 2 times per message if you take twelve hundred messages 2488 times he mentions the word altar that's twice per message he believed in an altar in fact from 1947 all the way to communion message in the communion message 12:12 his last recorded words he mentions the altar his last service of leadership that he preached brother Branham had an altar call it has to do with the opening of the word his last think about this his last duties as a prophet was to have an altar call and then have communion his last message in Jeffersonville which was where his church was and he felt at liberty and Satan's Eden do you know that the Branham Tabernacle which is where I was born and raised it was so packed out of people when brother Branham was there chairs all the way up to the front they were sitting on the altar and you hear brother brown said there's not room here for an altar call but make your heart and altar who's never heard that before he said did brother Branham believe in altar calls right up to the very last service of Satan deed and it's so packed out him and the platform's packed out the Baptist three pack you listen to the end of that message his last service in the Brenham Tabernacle he's making it a public altar he said you pray for me and I'll pray for you there's something sacred about this altar that speaks of surrendering I'm not doing exercises today but I wonder if you could take both your hands and just go like this some of you have notes and you're right but surrender it means I gotcha it's a military term for just give up I pray our messages become more than words only and just teaching or talking or just describing things on a overhead and to where we just leave with no personal altar and we'll carry this over to tonight's service but you can actually go to a church altar or a public altar and never make it to a personal altar you can get caught up under emotion or caught up under something and it just doesn't last you wonder why it never became personal we've been born and raised in the message brother John we've seen the cycles but people preaching the message song reading the message choirs in the message and churches and a few years go by those same people are out in the world they went away from their personal altar - some would say they never even knew Christ they never even had the Holy Ghost is that incredible people that were delivered from smoking and drinking it gave testimonies where you know you don't even feel like your testimonies you don't have a testimony when they give their testimonies is that true who's ever felt like that I mean some people they're just so way up in the heavens and you look you and then a few years go by and they're just right and there's just still something in your heart go on with God go on with God people collapse I would encourage you today find a personal altar where you can wrestle it out with God is I God great is our God mighty he's not way out there he's a personal God [Music] it's a place of yielding and dying out where spirits leave carnality and unbelief is laid up on the altar I remember when I was in a camp service and we were in the camp meeting in a great big tent and the lights went out in the buildings the power went off I didn't care I was a young man sitting back this way here and I just leaned forward in my chair and the preacher kept on preaching and I tried to find a little flashlight that was before the days of iPads and all that where they could just keep it was you know they had their notes and trying to bring a pirate brother Joe Walden there I remember him running up there'd with a little microphone or a little flashlight you remember that sister Cathy and they're trying to get a light to the preacher so he could keep preaching now it's totally black he just keeps preaching preaching and when they made an altar cope for the German was the first one to the altar but it was so packed out and fold that not one Minister ever prayed for me a counselor didn't pray for me my mother didn't come up my father didn't come up my friends didn't come up I was so close brother Joe and was just packed around me I go back to that and I say it's not just the preacher it's not just my friends it's not my spouse it's doing ahold of God we need those experiences don't get me wrong friends it can happen in your house I'm speaking about a private personal altar it's not a public show it can happen in the public but the main thing is find a personal place I believe it's good for ministers to pray for others and spouses and loved ones and friends I believe in that don't get me wrong I see some of you looking at me wondering where I'm coming from well I came from heaven and I'm going back to heaven we've been through this so long it's more than words and quotes and all of that it's finding a God that's personal if you really want to get down to the bottom line that's the need if people could just connect with Jesus do you believe that the altar is a place of prayer and I want to say this maybe to take something off of someone's shoulders just because someone comes to the altar don't mean that their backs lit some people have it in their minds oh if I go forward that means there's sin in my life or I'm back slid or oh there there goes that person there's they must be sinning the altar is more than just for backsliders it's for worshipers it's to be a place of prayer it's to be for a place that for a person that needs prayer they want to move out of the normal move out of just me bringing my children to church and worried about their diapers and and their little graham crackers and oh I gotta take care of my baby it's a mother it's a daddy that knows I have personal spiritual needs I've seen it before I've seen mother's hand off their babies and go walking down to the altar I've heard about the nursery becoming a place where mothers get away and they talk and they chat and they they're connected to one another blood about what's going on friends I pray that wouldn't happen here the sanctuary ought to be a refuge in a place that our children are our young people that they're not encouraged to leave the sanctuary daddies and mommies just always walking around and having another place in the fellowship hall I hope I'm not stepping on nobody's toes but I hope I'm stepping on somebody's toes it almost gets to a place where little children they want to be bad and cried so they know they can leave and they can get out of here it's nothing about the devil when the altar ought to be a place and your altar of your heart ought to be a sanctified place and [Music] let's blow up the dust of the day and the tears of life and can I help you brother Adams let's blow off some of those devils and demons Devils come and lie to our young ladies through the week and bring depression and suicide we are under authority of the Holy Spirit to cast out those devil before the person even reaches the altar there ought to be enough power in our words to scatter off the devil there ought to be weeping and crying [Applause] there are the Bieber men and women cry in the pews where they cry out to God and say it's me god I've been an unfaithful father I've been unfaithful wives my hands are unclean I feel like putting them in my pocket or in my purses but the Holy Spirit just washing just cleansing it's like you said I'm unworthy I'm little I'm embarrassed it's like I'm so ashamed the Holy Ghost coming to your altar taking out demons rooting up complexes right while you'd hear the word it's like the power of the word is there a people that want to move out from just being natural into the supernatural sometimes it's a person that doesn't just want to say a prayer they need to pray a prayer do you know the difference you say a prayer and you go along you come in you go out same desire same lack of love same movie just the same Oprah know there's a person that finally gets to the place I'm gonna pray a prayer I don't care who's preaching today I don't care what's going on in the church there might have been a distraction on the way to church last night or Friday where are those people that begin to cry out to God do you know in the Branham tabernacle brother Branham in church order talked about people coming to the altar and praying before the service and and brother Daniel cross he's already left but he said he remembers that years ago as a young boy before the service come into the altar and his father would come up and the little boys would come up and pray with their daddies you know what if we had the altar call at the beginning of the service then we had the singing in the preaching what would our services be like if we had men and women not just come forward but in their pews they begin to say God I need you today have an altar amen what if they got their sins under the blood they knew that they needed more or they started to say what brother Brennan said revelation is the greatest thing we should be crying out for cry out for revelation God just bow your head and say lord I need more revelation at the start of the service how many terms as the Holy Ghost fell in a meeting and within a half-hour brother Middleton within just a half hour people go out they talk they did they talked in the parking lot they go home and the whole atmosphere is lost in an hour who's ever seen that before oh nobody has I'm sorry we've all felt that before we seen God talking directly to a situation this is real deep today isn't it I'm just pulled between tonight service because I want to speak tonight on impacted by the wine and oil when you and I was like that person that was going down life's Road and Satan wanted to rip us and tear us and break us up but there came by someone that poured in oil and wine they poured in the Holy Ghost they poured in some stimulation that got us up on our feet again and we were taken to the inn to the church and the Holy Spirit spoke to the ministers and said take care of them until I come back again and if there's anything lacking I'll make it up then that's why we're unselfish that's why we're willing to pour out our lives because our reward is not here that's also here that's not here it's over there and I want to speak to personally to this assembly as we come up to the Easter camp and the young people's meetings how that God is poured in oil is it okay brother Tim to prepare you God's poured in oil in your life and wine into your life then we have a responsibility for others to create an atmosphere for somebody else this is crying out that is meaning say why do you preachers preach under such intensity why are you so burdened I'll tell you something to happen to me not just last Wednesday but the Wednesday before can I be personal I had heard in the morning about 9/11 September 11th 2001 and about the audio voices and the recordings of people that were inside the World Trade Centers does anybody know what I'm talking about you older one 9/11 2001 and the world so an outside view of these airplanes crashing into these two buildings and it was horrible and horrible in flames and and another airplane crashing into the planes flight 93 crashing into the field and killing more but what I heard was now as we saw the outside but there were thousands of men and women on the inside that were trapped and I heard the audible voices of them calling 911 911 there was over 3,000 calls in the first ten minutes it flooded the 911 I heard answering machine messages of people calling their spouses and calling homes this is the last recorded words their last recorded words I listened to Kevin cost growth his last words he was on for 105 and he's leaving a message with the 911 operator were young men we're not ready to die I need oxygen there's three people with me and you hear him talking back and forth with a 911 operator and then you see they got it time coded in a video and the whole tower just collapses and his phone goes dead I heard Melissa Joey and floor 83 of the World Trade Center she said I've got five people with me in the office call the 911 having trouble breathing I'm gonna die a night and the operators saying ma'am ma'am ma'am say her prayers stay calm stay calm she's screaming help help I hear voices this is Melissa's voice inside the trade tinner can't you stay on the line with me now she said to the operators stay on the line with me she's grabbing ahold of somebody that's alive then she said I think I'm dying as the oxygen and the smoke overtake her I heard the voices of air traffic controllers wondering why this is all happening wonder why flight 93 is going away and then crashing I heard the last words of the lead terrace in the airplane screaming it's okay it's okay I'll say this right before he was placed into the regions of the loss thinking by a false god he was going to have all these virgins and all this if you just kill these certain people he believed alive now is it in an airplane saying to all these people you hear his last words it's gonna be okay it's going to be okay stay in your seats I want to say today we serve a god that's greater than all of those lives how can we disbelieve the lie that Satan Satan comes in and gives lies I think we need to push them off today when God's so rich in mercy has given us a message I heard the last words of the people in the flight 93 that was crashing in the field is this okay I'm just a minister in my study on a Wednesday getting ready to preach and I was listening to some of this I was weeping I was crying I had to follow my knees before God you're not worried about everybody else in the Deacon and the print it's like me Oh God we don't know if we're in a service it's our last time and this isn't emotion by the way this is reality and I think sometimes what is it gonna take to shake us to reality where men and women can come into the presence of God and be smitten with his presence the last words of the whole plane screaming as they crashed into the field I heard Trade Center B which is the second tower voice is saying I want you to know that I love you and I'm stuck in this building the last words coming out of there to a family mother I want you to know that I love you and I'm in this building and I think a bomb has gone off they didn't know what would happen you can hear it from the September 11th attacks and many people tried to make contact and leave messages their final words to loved ones I actually heard parents of the deceased speak about their son or their daughter speaking their last words that they heard on an answering machine this is my last comment on this there was one man that was a retired contractor and he hardly ever answers his phone because he said people just call him always wanting him to do things for free or help him out with this but this morning he got a call at a certain time and this that morning he picked up the phone it was his daughter calling from the World Trade Center and she's screaming us he just calm down calm down tell me what's going on and Oh dad there's been a bomb go off in the building what am I to do what am I to doing it flicks on the television and he sees it right there - Trade Centers on fire and he doesn't tell her but he just begins to speak about to go to the nearest exit and go here and go down and little did he know but all the exits were closed over it was the last time he spoke to his daughter her name was Melissa Hughes from floor 101 voices from within voices from within we were watching the outside but there was voices from within and I wonder brother Tim how many of us today are interested about the true voice from within of our people of our loved ones of our family I believe ourselves that's cried out and I pray God would shake us so that these things become more of a reality to us can this church agree with me today Lord make it more personal little did Nana know when I was preaching that night and sharing that with the church that just a few minutes before midnight a husband and wife in the message were just speaking just miles from the church just talking to one another and the sister goes into the washroom and she comes back out and her husband's already gone no pulse foaming-at-the-mouth gone they call their family their family was nurses and medical they do CP can you imagine doing a CPR on your own father call the daughter she's also in the medical they all come try to resuscitate their daddy you talk about traumatic call the paramedics it was over by 12:10 it was all over within just hours of a minister preaching this way it was over for someone that just happened friends in the last days I say God help us as individuals to make this word more personal and if you are where you need to be with God we need to be more burden for others that are around us we need to shake off becoming so common with one another that we lose the feeling just this last week I was communicating with her well knowin Minister in the message he said my heart is broken just on Friday we heard firsthand testimony of a man in the message that was a pastor as a minister the gospel speak about of him a breakdown that he had and my wife didn't even know hadn't even told her I knew myself before other ministers that have gone through breakdowns and because they're bearing your burdens we need to be more aware that though our soul is in contact with God we still have a body in a spirit and we need to be more sensitive and personal with one another with that we don't lose the feeling with one another I hope this is OK tonight because someone would say all just take us to the third pool taking us to the opening of the word I'll say this if a person has that kind of revelation from the word they will have a personal alter that produces an alter in their lives and if it doesn't something is wrong somewhere so many years have gone by we've been the camp's and services and meetings and dynamic preachers it comes down to right what I'm Chuck speaking about right now there must be a personal individual connection with God and when a person really has a revelation of this message there will be a change in their personal lives I'll tell your friends I'm very concerned and burdened we don't want to ever get putting God in our box we want to go to wherever God is and get in his box we never want to get to the place that we are praying god bless my life blessed my you're my ministry bless my family bless my wife bless my husband - saying prayers get in my box we need to go to God's box what is your will what is your desire what is your direction hallelujah God's trying to put a big circle around you you run you hide you try to get away you move out and God's saying where are you going why do you have that attitude that's unsafe out there you're running against my will well brother John it's it's God's permissive will and I'm doing this out of a burden friends but if you're not called to do that you need to be very careful get into God's Way of thinking get into God's Way of living our lives I say God give us Holy Ghost field lives can this church say man - that about half of you I don't care if you got to go to the barn this afternoon or miss a meal give us born-again experiences can we go to that next one thank you you've heard the message of what what time is it sir serves is this the time for the Branham preached it in Jeffersonville 1962 then he goes out in March here we see 1963 and the seven angels appear to him and he said the voice said to him turn it sideways and he see don't you see it there it was Christ the wigged one the judgment he was judging a generation but to the bride he brought a message so we see now in march 17 through the 24th 1963 God used brother Branham to break the seven seals in Jeffersonville but how many have forgotten or maybe you know that it was on the Monday morning after the seventh seal that he spoke on Sunday night he spoke twenty more minutes that's part of that message he actually didn't want them to release the Seventh Seal until he listened to it on the Monday then he went to a motel of the two brothers that had were in charge of the making of the tapes and he said I don't want this message sent out the way that it is and after listening to the tape he instructed the brothers to stop the tape at a certain point and that's in paragraph 261 then he recorded 20 minutes and then they ended the tape again with you can hear them singing at the end brother branham is the one that wanted it that way and they never released that final version until after 1966 and brother Branham left the scene and you can read all this in there seven seals book until they released the whole message and on that Monday you can hear brother Branham speaking this is some of the things that he said we are grateful to God for what he has showed us I've been sitting in the room up there for eight days and the message that I have just got through explaining to you many here will understand I promised that there was something going on spiritual all the time that I was sure you were missing it and here's what it is it's the absolute of indication of this interpretation of the Scriptures being sin of God this is part of the seventh seal brother Branham listens to the Sunday night service and then he records this said I've been up in a room for eight days he said I wonder if many of you I'm sure you were missing it but here's what it is it's the absolute vindication of this interpretation of the Scriptures being sin of God because before we were even went into it I left to go out west the Lord showed me a vision one day about ten o'clock one morning and I come and explained it here that I had seen it and didn't know what it was it was a constellation of seven angels we'll remember that you'll get it on the tape called what time as it serves well now that is exactly what you're seeing now it was Christ coming it was the word coming it was him announcing the what I've said publicly now privately must happen for individuals and within a few years he was gone off the same is that true something publicly was happening but how many people wanted a private interview with brother Branham all they wait for a year I have the quotes here brother Branham talked about these things about up to a year they wait for a private interview if I didn't get a private interview as a prophet and then in one message he says who here would want to have a interview and he said so many raised their hand he said well who does it he said you just get in contact with billion just a minute of these time just and they would maybe be given 30 minutes of time they wanted a private I want some personal time with the Prophet I think that's the same desired job head oh if I only knew where he lived I could go up to his house and talk to the Lord today if I could just go up to his house and talk to the Lord and share my burdens and really lay it all out there and have him talk to me privately and we have these burdens and we have these things that we go through and where's questions that people have I brought you to the Seventh Seal because later in that year in Christ is the mystery brother branham refers back to it and talks about how the coming of the Lord and how it's a mystery it's a secret nobody know nothing about it even the Angels didn't understand they wanted to know when he would come but it's the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come and that's where so many get it the Seventh Seal isn't open because they say well hey when no man knows the day nor hour and they cut it off and they say see the Seventh Seal isn't open but the bride believes all seven seals has been broken do we believe that but that's what some have gone off here and some have gone they're some of when over the years on these doctrines and they make great camps till finally there would be a generation that would say I'm not interested in the camps I'm not interested in just to church only I want Jesus in my life not just a certain preacher oh I've got his cell phone number I'll text him now whatsapp him I'll send him an email God wants you as a person how many believe that but how many also know that we are to be God with skin on him now about 5% of you how many know that were to be God with skin on like the little boy it's raining and my wife loves thunder and lightning if you want to blame anybody just blame her for the weather yesterday and this morning because she loves the lightning and the Thunder and the rain coming down like we had it's our vacation so God answered her prayers I mean give you the desires of your heart what was I gonna say there but people over the years they they thought it was in this and they thought it was in that and they thought it was in this thank you and the little boys the mommy said we're believers we're Christians you're just going up to your bed and go to go to sleep Jesus is with us but mama sometimes I know those things but I want G I want a God with skin on him come up here mama and sometimes friends we need more than just quotes and quoting things and pointing somewhere else we need to have enough Jesus about us to be able to say I've got some wine I've got some oil I've got Jesus inside of me God don't never let us get so cold and indifferent but what we can still be God with skin on and can you imagine coming to church and not getting hardly nothing out of it but knowing that you're here for someone else maybe there's somebody here that really needs a personal God and you get under a bird and you actually pray and seek God God what are you going to do and God let you be dry and not receive much but somebody else is just soaking it in pulling it in I prayed God give that person something today I know that I've almost been an hour and a half that's a long time but we'd love for someone to just reach out and touch the Lord maybe it's a mother maybe it's a husband it could be an elder in this church a deacon or even a minister we can get so busy serving giving pouring out being in our positions that but we realize I need God more in my life I would encourage you today find an altar somewhere find a personal place where you can talk to Jesus and Jesus can talk back to you I believe a person that can I just take a couple more minutes a person that really knows God in Revelation doesn't become all haughty and puffed up I believe it doesn't cause you to think that you know it all and you're better than somebody else in fact quite the contrary if you really know Jesus it should make you more humble little hello I just feel little you're finally getting somewhere when you feel little when you feel like that you're easy to be intreated and you're approachable where you can go and reach to someone that's lower and reach out and help them I was in our winter camp just a few weeks ago tonight I'll speak more about that with our young people and I was listening to the preaching and I thought here we have a Thursday Friday and by Saturday I began to think of this do you know what God is doing it's like having a plant and God is driving down a little stake by the plants and then he's getting out some little twine or a little rubber or something to tie onto that plant you don't know what that's like you don't have a garden and you plant tomatoes and you plant something carrots or whatever it is maybe not carrots but something else and you put a little stake down there well this is real spiritual but I'm thinking of this while the preachers preaching it's called inspiration oh thank god what are you doing to our young people God has the time to labor with us and love them and entreat them I thought of a little plant steak that you plant hid down beside of a plant and put a little piece of rope around and tie on to that so it can grow straight it's like a guide it's like something that I'm here to assist you I'm not you and I believe one day you're gonna grow stronger and when you grow stronger you're not gonna need this always around and say what are you doing talking like this I'm just around I'm just here beside of you to guide let's go you can do this say man what are you all screaming what are you having all these meetings and camps for we're just here to assist you we're just here to guide you my your instruments are kind of weird you're saying it a certain way or talking about it in a certain way do you know what God's doing he's just putting things by your pathway at the season of your life to let you know that he tears I'm with you so stop looking at the things around you what are you doing and come on dad come on mom no come on preacher couldn't you've just said that in 30 minutes well maybe someone else could have but God's just putting down a stake next to you saying I understand what you're going through and I'm just here but you're gonna grow up one day bright tree you're gonna grow up don't have a vision God has a plan aren't you happy for the guides of your life those that are called to be a strength Giver they're not you they don't think like you you're not like them God's made you special I really feel like that's what we're called to do moms dads and elders we are here to help and assist and guide the believers I think we ought to be very careful and cautious I know I am to keep damning people to hell just damming their souls to hell oh they're not going to be saved or they don't even have a chance I think we ought to be very careful about that do you agree just all that church of these people there's no chance for that person that's not the way God dealt with you that's not how he dealt with you older ones come on have we got so older in the message you forgot how stubborn you us how hard-headed we go so long as a person everything was rosy and nice and all we didn't do that yes you did you were rebellious but God rich in mercy look beyond all of that and gave you what you have need us but we're in another season we're in another time there's people all around us that need help to repair their altars repair build up God make it more personal help us to close the service I don't want it just to be someone else was healed and here a testimony there's times when you you need a healer and you need to say what they did for them I need a healer where you can say he's my healer Amen I'm speaking about a personal Savior we're brother Branham said and power of transformation you that's out on the broadcast I want you to receive Christ out there as your personal Savior sorry that's the answer of my wife's prayers amen I even made a plan and a reservation for Mexico and I cancelled it we had to be standing right here today not on some beach all alone with my wife I'm called to be standing right here as a voice to you encouraging you waving you as a person to the personal altar I think we can look to the person to the right or left or look to our families and say what can we do to help another person repair their altar because I don't want to be a here year later five years god forbid 20 years there's a lot of repairing that can go on Satan has caused great damage but I believe we're called together as body and as believers to edify one another strengthen one another I tell you there used to be a time in your life when God was dealing with you you cried you wept you just were so sensitive to God the services would come and you would just weep and cry and you you would just you want to delink earth you want it was just like God's presence was all around you you'd stay sitting in the church till after all them musicians had gone people had left people's already eaten subways and getting ready to go to the evening service and you're just still sitting there under the impact of the word you're just like quivering shaking like this you know what that is it's an altar God had made a way for you and it wasn't a public show it was for you you just made a mess of things you you cried you squall you didn't care about your friend and how do I look and am i cool-looking can we take a selfie goodness you are such an assemble I know right where I'm standing right now there's a need in the message for a restoration of the altar we've got to the place we just want to hear sermons and go out and hear sermons and we've gone so long and matured all the years that's gone by to where you have children growing up and you've got grandchildren they need the same experience you had daddy and mommy they need the same God just as fresh and new are we giving them a cracked old formal just receive it as you know just receive just believe the message is that what you're saying to them to where they're just going to the rooms now they got their iPhone there I enjoy the computers or whatever Satan has made it so at our fingertips of communication yet it's so impersonal when God is just the opposite he's personal where a person says that's my God he's my deliverer you say I've got things in my life I need a deliverer he's my help he's my choice he's my lord that's my husband you're talking about my prophet come on friends we've raised a general that's what my daddy believes that's what our church how they believe in our church when it ought to be that's what it says in the Bible say but I don't have that revelation you can ask God for it you can ask God to say God give me that revelation let's end with this brother Branham talked about we have all these rooms in our houses in our doors and we have a private life and he said you'll let God go so far and the Holy Ghost go so far but don't get into my private life that's my private life don't go there you can talk about a lot of things but don't come into my private life brother Branham said you'll never get the lordship of Jesus doing that he'll just turn right around and walk out the door said what would you do in the case like that if somebody went to a home and they said stand here at the door and just state your business he said you'd say thank you and turn out the door he said so would Jesus he said that's the reason the church is left sitting cold just the way it is he said don't ever let the Full Gospel businessmen ever get to that stage say what stage are you talking about where Jesus can come in so far into our music and our church into our families but don't get into our private life I woke up this week listening to a message God in simplicity in New Mexico and April right after the seals and brother branham said the only thing you just opened up a little bit and said come on inside and stand here but don't go around and fool with my private life and brother branham said he wants you he wants all of you he wants every compartment in your heart he wants your private life can I say it like this he wants your private life he wants all of your life he wants to be your Lord Lorna's ownership he wants to own you so she can guide you and direct you and take you and use you are you willing to do that if you are he's wanting to come in or you wouldn't be standing there so now is the hour for you to receive it this very hour you could receive the personal God it could just go into another room can we go can we go I enjoy the church that's the kitchen I enjoy the parlour but we can talk my is so deeper it's been nice knowing you but we've come up to another door now and that's the bedroom that's not for the public the kitchen is public the parlour is public but the bedroom is the third room and I'm encouraging every person in the service if you if you're on the outside looking in move on into the third room who would just raise your hand and say by the grace of God I live in that room the third room God's revealed that what would you say to somebody else today that could be in the service or after the service that's on the outside what are you gonna say to them come on in but it's not gonna be you and then them and you it's gonna be God in them you're actually encouraging them to go in there that's where people get all red-faced they get all ashamed it gets quiet but today if you're on the outside knowing you need to go in there we're encouraging you go all the way then can I say you that are in that inner room we need to live more from the inner room we need to live more from that place if you're really on the inside looking out we need to live from that place more and we need to remember that just because we're in that third room or the sole room does not do away with the other two rooms we still have a body we still have a spirit and our private life will become public so they say a brother John it doesn't matter it doesn't matter my public life it's all in my heart it's God knows my heart he knows your heart but if you have him privately it'll become public that goes for the positive and it goes for the negative if there's movies and extreme sport things and you're just over and I've got those things in my notes because I know what I'm talking about wrong music things going on privately in your life say nobody knows and there will come a time it becomes public so the best time to deal with it is right now and say God come into my personal life do we all agree you say brother I've got everybody hoodwinked nobody knows and you might you might be right but you don't realize it's coming out in your attitude it's coming out in your words what is private becomes public so I think it's a good time to be honest and say god I want to repair the personal part of my life and it's not everybody else it's me I need prayer I need to get more with God brother I'll just want to be honest with you I could be closer to Jesus and if everyone started moving in that direction it would stop a lot of nonsense it would stop a lot of things that go on that causes so much trouble if all of us just kept pulling and tonight we're going to go into that the oil and the wine hurt not the oil in the wine can take their health you can take the wealth you can take their friends but you can't take the Holy Ghost and you can't take it when they're stimulated by the word as we bow our heads right now be it unto me Lord according to your word Lord I might be in the crowd I might be in the church but it's when I can gather myself and be honest with the Lord Jesus and I can talk personal I can talk privately with the Lord those are very valuable moments those are very sacred sands those are experiences that we need more of in the message and in our churches and in our family altars we need more family altars we need more marriage altars where men and women humble themselves to the scripture - just a few minutes of a message my wife and I do it we've gone through messages the Hebrews book the adoption series the seven seals were in again now we don't listen to an hour two hours it's maybe 15 minutes here 20 minutes there we might go 30 or 35 it's time together it's a time in the word we're not watching a movie together we're not running around me it's time to turn off your phone it's a time to not answer the call that's calling you from there and there it's a time to just get alone in your marriage and say we need a marriage altar we need a family altar even in the church as I found as the years gone by it's almost like the altar has become a shun place to go it's almost like a stigma it's like I said earlier that's why I said it we need to stop thinking that just because someone goes to the altar that their back slid sometimes they just want to get out of the normal and get out of the average and say god I just want a time of prayer maybe do some of your good tonight before the meeting just maybe you're so much in a rut you just do it a certain way but you like to slip out and come forward and this where maybe five minutes or 10 minutes you know that's brother Daniel cross that's already going to the airport now could have that kind of a memory about his daddy I wonder what kind of memories were given our children I wonder what kind of things were sending to our wives and what we're listening to with our wives some of us just need to stop the nonsense and the fussing and say we need more of Jesus sister you can play something I believe in the gifts here in this church that God lays something on your heart I believe it's good how many would just say God I'm making my way to my personal altar I'm walking I'm lifting up a stone I'm lifting up this piece of wood here god bless you maybe some are guilty of being in the false gods of bail and there's too much false things in your life you needed to say brother John I need help taking down this certain thing this thing over here I need the Lord to consume it and burn it up I realize I'm so far down the road with this attitude and feeling it's not right why don't you lay that up on the altar brother [Music] sister what's it going to take for us to realize we need those old-fashioned times again you might think it's juvenile but when brother Jon heard those voices the other day of those men and women crying out calling out their last recorded words I was so smitten I began to weep I felt right on my knees in my office I said Oh God that's when you're not focused on somebody else's sins or their little hind their parts it's like God help me and I'm just getting ready to go in front of hundreds of your people help us not knowing in a few minutes that would be a man in our own area that within minutes was going to be speaking to his wife for the last time and he was going to be gone I thought God help us Lord as I the news came to me within hours god help us I want my last words to be a mercy and grace I love my last sermon to be one where someone was sensitive to God in that meeting to make footsteps to a personal place wouldn't you like that for yourself [Music] don't you want to be that kind of believer the people want what you've got maybe you've been guilty of handing them a drug or a smoke or a filthy magazine or maybe you're guilty of texting gossiper being a person that's and you're just so embarrassed you just feel like wiping everything clean and starting all over just deleting this account deleting that shooting that CD empty in that maybe you need to do that maybe somebody needs to say I've been sorry and I'm if I've offended you if I've hurt you in any way I'm sorry there were people that were called to move out the rocks and the logs and on the way to the cities of refuge that was the calling was to move out logs and rocks so that people could run to the city of refuge so that the way was more plain for them not complex and difficult but just saying Lord Jesus if I could move a rock for somebody brother over there can I help you move that log that beam little mode in our eyes that we can't see around but maybe Elijah said God there's seven thousand people there's other people around me that are designed the same thing I thought I was the only person I thought I was the only one that felt this way and God opened your eyes and says you know what all the believers around you are like that Lord are you making away this this service for a personal God because maybe in the next few days maybe in a couple weeks God wants to use this assembly in another dynamic chapter to move out the logs and move out the rocks but before you can help somebody else it's got to be moved out of your own you've got to have a personal experience before you can help someone else lead them to the door lead them to the bedroom and say come on in brother come on sister go into that place Jesus is beckoning to you come on into this secret place it's not a public show it's not for everybody else it's for you and you alone and God Heavenly Father [Music] by your Holy Spirit come to our addresses come to our holes come to our marriages come to evening light Tabernacle a church that we dearly love we're connected with them almost every single meeting we participate with them from another place from another round we're able to connect through and we have a love for them but how so much greater the love of God for all of us to bring us in to encircle us into his great economy and say Oh for a personal place a private life Heavenly Father take our lives today this April 7th here the prayers of every heart answer the altar call of every individual that would be calling out meet them individually meet them privately let us be willing to tear down all the exterior all the stuff and just be real with one another [Music] help us to be willing to say if I've been wrong I want the Lord to show me helped us to be willing to say to someone else if I ever hurt you or offended you I need to be more sensitive to me Lord that really shows that a person's got something deep help our ministers help our musicians help our deacons in our trustees hope the Gator Patrol helped the counselors help the elders help the ones that have given up all of their Sunday's for the last 30 years 32 years their Easter Sunday and now this year we have it so many want to come that within days it's already booked up in a waiting list can I come can I still come even up there yesterday hearing can I come can I come and the answer back was you're gonna have to let us know by tonight Lord Jesus have you made it so good for us and so easy for us that we've missed Jesus in all of it to be continued we go out in a few minutes get a little refreshment and come back let us hear more about this oil in this wine a few Divis an afternoon service bring the atmosphere goddess expectancy bring us to a place Lord where you can be more personal and we can be more personal to one another Jesus I asked you may there be not one person in this whole area in this church in this community and our families that do not see Jesus enough in our lives that on the day of judgment they look back across the bar and say why didn't you tell us what you could have been more real to us because today is the day to give our mercy and grace I know then we'll want to give it we'll want to say Lord Jesus get can't you just bring them in can't you allow them can't you you need a cup of cold water do you need a little way do you what can we do if it's teaching we'll have a little teaching if it's an altar service let's have an altar service if it's a prayer line if it's a counselor just talking to a little girl that's off on the sidelines or a young man that seems a little distant if it's a brother that's in the church might seem like an elder but little do we know there's things going on in his life maybe it's a sister that's the choir director maybe it's a deacons wife or someone that's 3040 years she's just on them she's just a thread away from losing her mind God don't let us become so callous and so far away with one another that we don't pick up on the little indicators someone right next to us is calling out for help what Jesus put on skin with somebody around me that I could answer my question what maybe we could pray like this this afternoon Lord if you could use us to influence another person closer to you it would really help me in my walk with you to see that my life has reason and purpose it might be somebody right in our own home or somebody on that chat group or somebody in the Pew you might not have to look very far for God to answer your prayer [Music] might just have to look in the mirror say Jesus let me look beyond the facade and the mechanical devices and the building and the badge are skinned I want to go into that private place I want to go into that place secret place where you can make it known to me personally my eyes can come open I can say Oh Stan Jesus did was you seeing it that way all the time I'm so sorry I hurt you I've been living these last months and years so selfish what can I do for somebody else can I do something Oh God forgive us Lord Jesus if we've been like that Balaam's mule we've been so stubborn and Balaam was just hitting and hitting and hitting it would be so stubborn artists to something that's not even doesn't even have a soul has to talk to us and say don't you see there's an angel standing right in front of you someone that doesn't even have a soul a little animal but God moving a nature said I've been faithful to you all these years there's an angel there's a messenger standing right in front of you saying don't go that way you soften our hearts you know make the rivers that are rushing it going quick to become still waters that we could kneel down in front of and put our hands down in and take up a refreshment it'll give us strength bless your name Jesus thank you Lord he said [Music] wonder [Music] from the far [Music] Oh [Music] in fact let's stand for the
