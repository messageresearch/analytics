TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Try to make them all think I'm strong. Yeah, the face I keep putting on says I ain't tired. But these tears stained eyes ain't lying cuz hard. Nobody told me life could be so hard. A weary soul with a worn out heart that's barely beating. But every time I get that feeling, I hit my knees with my hands held high, saying, "Dear Lord Jesus, you know I can't do this on my own. I can't do this on my own. Lord knows I tried, but I'm good at falling down. Thank God you're good at picking me up off the ground. The world's going to try to break me, but I know the one who makes me [Applause] strong. Strong like my daddy always told me. So there's a place you can always go when you've got nothing. And then he handed me the one thing that's strong. It doesn't matter how old it gets. There's power in the words that's read in this old Bible. And when I'm desperate for revival, I hit my knees with my hands held high, saying, "Dear Lord Jesus, you know I can't do this on my own. I can't do this on my own. Lord knows I tried, but I'm good at falling down. Thank God you're good at picking me up off the ground. The world's going to try to break me, but I know the one who makes me strong. Oh, strong. I'm strong when I've got nothing. I'm strong even when I'm weak. Cuz the strong arms of my Savior are holding on to me. I hit my knees with my hands held high, saying, "Dear Lord Jesus, you know I can't do this on my own. I can't do this on my own. Lord knows I've tried, but I'm good at falling down. Thank God you're good at picking me up off the ground. The world's going to try to break me, but I know the one who makes me strong. Oh, you make me strong. [Music] [Applause] Oh, this world ain't going to break me. Cuz I know the one who makes me strong. [Applause]
