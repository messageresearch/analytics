we had a the passing of our brother Kenneth Middleton and he'll be greatly missed and uh we found him to be a man who really loves the Lord and died in faith and he didn't die a loser either he's not a loser amen he's a winner amen you know I I was visit him here just a few days before he passed and he actually was very cognant and able to speak quite a few things to me and and he said his grandson I believe Caleb had asked him he said Granddad he said if you ever ever if you ever have the O ever would have the opportunity to stand behind a pull pit and speak you know but kthy I don't know how many times he read the Bible and listening to the message all the way through and quite a well studied man um he said but if you had the opportunity to speak what would you speak on he said I would preach on the danger of going to church and he said his grandson's like wow that that surprises me what he what what do you what would where would that go and he said well you know there's the dangers of just going to church and just going through the motions and and not ever really getting anything from God he said but I found the danger of going to church is it'll kill you he said I found out that that old man that I used to be it died amen amen you know I got to thinking about Enoch and how he lived 60 and5 years and then he beget Methuselah and then the scripture says then Enoch walked with God after he beet Methuselah so there was a period of time he didn't walk with God Amen but then he he began to walk with God and and we know the story is he was found not for God took him and we have to say again brother Kenneth didn't die he's still just as alive today even more so than ever amen and and he's not here with us for God has received him on the other side and so I I just want to thank the Lord for brother Kenneth's life and what he meant to us and um I can remember a lot of times in my early Ministry calling him and talk to him about things and him encouraging me and and always really appreciated our brother and thankful that I was able to serve of what time we had here on this side but this is not the end it's just the beginning amen and it's the what a beginning for our brother to you know to never have to go back to a wheelchair again to never have to go back to a crippled up body and and and to go through cancer and different things you know actually you know I actually thought he'd never die just because all the things he went through and overcome but uh he he told me very in a personal way he said you know I I I said this may strange sounds strange he said but I I I love the Rapture and the thought of the Rapture and taking the body change he said but honestly he said I've always wanted to go on to the other side he said because I want to be one of those that comes back with him I want to see Jesus and so that was his desire and and uh actually I would pray and and talk to him on that day and and you know still believing God could touch him I'd get through with my prayer and he said and I said brother Kenneth I'll see you again he looked at me and he said yeah on the other side that was that was in his heart and he knew it and uh so we just want to take a moment to think about our brother and and to be thankful for the life that he lived here and I know he'd be greatly missed not only by this church but by his wife sister Loretta and and the family and and he was father to many there and so we just want to take a moment to think about him and then we'll pray let's just take a moment of silence father we want to say how much we are thankful for lives Lord that live for you no doubt if Hebrews 11 could continue to be wrote our brother's name would even be written there died in Faith Lord God we just ask Lord that you would just come and comfort Hearts as only you can Lord he's got a dear wife that's going to miss him children grandchildren we ask Lord that you would come and move on their behalf as only you can cuz you are the comforter Lord we can say things we can say words and we can mean him with all of our heart and this it brings Comfort but nobody Comforts like you can Lord in those moments of Sorrow you can just remind us of the good times and the good things and Lord I'm so thankful for our brother Lord he's not suffering anymore and he's in a body of Deliverance complete whole never to go back again to that old mortal realm Lord but forever a son of yours and a young body and health we ask Lord you'll just Comfort us as a church during these times because we'll miss him Lord as you come in and added his little lick of fire and clapping of His Hands singing worshiping unto you God we'll miss him Lord but Lord what a grand reunion day Lord when we come to that moment of change Lord and our bodies we see our loved ones rise up from the grave and Lord not in their old decrepit bodies not in their old wrinkled skin and gray-headed Lord bounding wheelchairs or whatever kind of humanity but Lord young and Lord a perfect body and perfect health Lord the faith that arise in our hearts as we feel that change sweep over us Lord to go to match them and to be gathered together to meet you what a day that'll be Lord and I I believe it's not just a fairy tail or some sand castle somewhere that'll be washed away but it's a living reality Lord Lord help us to catch the vision of that other land lord lord that we can see there's there's more to that land than there is to this land and it's more real than here father and Lord today as he would join that cloud of witnesses and today we once again hear his voice saying press on Don't Stop keep going it's worth it it's worth every trial it's worth every pain it's worth every thing that you would ever go through to re to be able to experience what I'm experiencing now father we ask Lord you'll bless the family in jesus' name bless this service Lord may it be just for your honor and For Your Glory may your presence just come amongst us Lord help me to step out of the way I pray Lord and allow you to minister to our hearts and needs cuz God I I'm I'm incapable I I can't do anything or anything on my own that would be of any really any benefit especially not Eternal benefit but Lord it takes you to anoint the word to our heart and we just ask God that you would move in a mighty way we pray in jesus' name amen amen good to be in the house of the Lord amen turn our Bibles to Genesis 1 if you would also Matthew chapter 4 Amen brother Tim will be home tomorrow evening and he's had a good time a lot of lot of good things have been done in Newland and now in New Brunswick there and we're thankful for that we happened to be away this last Wednesday at brother Jason Jackson's and last minute kind of trip and and but the Lord I actually was going to go pick up a little piece of equipment that I wanted and and he he asked me if I would stop by and Minister for them and and Lord had more in plan in the plan than my little piece of equipment and we're thankful that he he's in control of every every situation and I saw that you had a wonderful time here as well and and what a mighty God we serve amen it's I tell you that that service Wednesday night that sermon Wednesday night was just a tremendous blessing and and uh challenged my own heart amen and uh I I I believe that more I believe everybody ought to hear that and and just just say Lord help me amen I believe but help thou my unbelief amen and help me to line up to the word of God Genesis 1 and verse 14 says and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the Heavens to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years and let them be for lights and the firment of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so in Matthew chapter 4 verse 16 it says the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time that time Jesus be to preach and say repent for the kingdom is of Heaven Heaven is at hand amen we we'll let you be seated I um actually was preaching on Wednesday again at brother Jason's on the season of change and um begin to as I I spoke there I I hit a few things on there and I kind of sparked some more thoughts upon on this on the line here on this same line but I'd like to speak to you on the light the change because I I believe that's what we're looking for is the ultimate change of our bodies amen but there had to be another change before we'll ever see that change and and you know in reading the scripture uh brother Brandon would take from the scripture and preach a message on from that time and at that and we'll go into that some uh this morning but from that time amen this light had come and and they they that sat in the region in the shadow of death light is sprung up and you know I find it very awesome as I begin to look into these things that every time in the Bible and even in our day as we go into it amen when God is ready to make a change whether it be a change in in a life or or a change in in in um dispensation a change there's always a light that accompanies that change and and then I and I see it here as he put in his word he gave these lights for for signs and for seasons and so he would declare that this light had to be here amen so that change could take place upon the Earth and and if we read about the Earth we could read about in The Genesis 1 and the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form this without form is considered something of no value it's a waste a Barren place it was without form and void and void is an empty space needing to be fulfilled and so the darkness was upon the face of the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light see God didn't want to leave the earth and the condition that it was and and the barren condition and and and a something that of of no value just a wasted Barren place but he desired to create an Eden upon that Barren place and so in order to create that Eden he had to First create light and that Light Came Upon the Earth for the first time and it was signifying that change is about to come upon the earth that is going to leave and go from a Barren wasted condition Amen to a Garden of Eden and it was going to change the look it was going to change the feel it was going to change the landscape of all the Earth amen when light comes it changes things and God has always used light to Mark a change he he would use it in Abraham's day when Abraham would go into a deep sleep and and God would put him into a deep sleep and he would divide the sacrifices and all those things you know the scripture and but it they read the Scripture it said a light begin to walk between the sacrifices and brother randam said that was showing that there was to be a change amen a covenant that was coming upon the Earth that it wasn't no more I do this and you do this and if you do this I'll do this but I'm going to do this no matter what you do that it's an unconditional Covenant and light marked that change it was also in the burning bush it was Moses you know the prophet of God that had become just a sheep herder and turned his back upon the promises of God and walked away from it and and forgot about it for 40 years but you know on that morning that he rose up it was different from all other mornings and and Moses begin to think about his way and how how he had went off on his own schooling and his own training and and he tried to produce something and he' killed one Egyptian and he was thinking about these things no doubt and something happened a little crackling on a heel C his attention and he looked over there and there was a light that had come down in a burning bush and and he said I'm going to turn aside and see what this what God has done and and he walks up there and out of that light speaks a voice and and that voice begins to remind him who he was and why he was here on Earth and and what he was to be and what God has had ordained him to be and and and he began to give all of excuses and say this that and the other but all the excuses God had an answer and and God be to tell him I am has come down to deliver my people now they had been in slavery some 400 years but there came a light down to declare A change is upon the Earth A Change Is Coming upon on on on the behalf of my children and we know how God moved in a mighty way and that Pillar of Fire would come down and move through Moses and and go through there and he would begin to speak the word of God and he said go tell Pharaoh let my people go now that changed it happen all at once but it when when it it was just as good as done because the word had spoken and it was going to happen it didn't matter how much Pharaoh hardened his heart or how how how it seemed to get worse make more bricks without straw all these things that did not change God's mind it did not change God's nature it did not change his his abilities but God was more determined than ever to bring this change upon his people and we know the light stayed there among them amen as it was stay there in Goan it would be light in Goan and dark in Egypt amen it was showing there's a change that is coming upon your behalf amen and they would go out amen with a light and that light would go with them and that light would open the Red Sea that light would give them good Waters to drink that that light would provide food that light would provide all kinds of things for them amen that light would lead them all the way into the promised land it didn't matter if they believed it or not it didn't matter if they walked away from or not it didn't matter if they denied it or not that light remained with the children of Israel and it led them into the promised land amen and I I believe the same thing has come in our generation a light came down in our generation what was it go tell Pharaoh let my people go amen they were Bound by denominations they were Bound by sin they were they were Bound by men's Creeds and men's ideas they were Bound by lost truths amen that had those truths had have been bound up and mixed all up but the light came and it showed upon those truths and it be to tell what was what and what was not and what was true and what wasn't true and it brought the god head back in his place and it brought serpent seed back in his place what was it the light be to Dawn upon the word and the word begin to speak to our hearts and the word begin to say hey you don't have to be bound like that no more you can be delivered you don't had to be said said in those ways amen but God has come down to deliver his people amen we can look at the angels of God Amen as they showed the light upon the hill to the Shepherds amen that eternal light that was the same light that came down there in the burning bush amen that was the same one that walked with him and it brought about a change there was a change of dispensation it was saying something is about to take place go to the stable amen go to where the he lays there's a king that's been born go to where he's lay it was a voice that spoke and said hey there's something that is taking place and God was beginning to move them from the law to Grace God was beginning to move them from a woolly lamb to him becoming the lamb and taking away their sins and it brought a change he said the Angels came down with that light and they begin to sing and they begin to shouts begin to take place and a word went forth and said today in the city of David in Bethlehem is born Christ the Savior amen the word begin to make light and the light begin to come on the word amen and it begin to illuminate and show them that a change was about to take place amen Mary on her even before this had even happened Mary on her road to the well the little virgin about 17 years old had was married a man you know that had many CH it was an older man and she loved him and he had children all these things and and you know and she's beginning to ponder on things why why is why is it like this I heard the I heard something the preacher said and he said that there was going to be a savior that would come and how is it going to be and brother BR said as she was pondering upon these things a light begin to Flicker and a light begin to shine and he said out of that light stepped an angel and that angel begin to tell her amen Hail Mary amen hail means to stop and pay attention to what I'm going to tell you Hail Mary blessed art thou among women for you have found favor with God and you're going to Bear a child knowing no man what how can these things be he said the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and what is born of you shall be of that that Holy One and you shall call his name Jesus amen what was it it was light came to declare there's a change that's coming upon you Mary it's a change amen that you're going to receive something from God you're not going to receive it from man you're not going to receive it from man's ideas you're not going to receive it from what some priest said or or some Pope said or some this bishop said you're going to receive it from the Holy Ghost amen and I believe there's also another Mary upon this earth that is also a light has appeared to and he said you're not going to receive this from any man you're not going to receive this even from a seventh grade Kian preacher you're going to receive this from the Holy Ghost and inside of you shall be born the son Jesus Christ amen that's is what is taking place and she said amen the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and what was her response be it unto me according to Thy Word amen and she laid aside amen all her doubts and all of her fears and all of her worries amen immediately amen it made a change in her this little virgin's life amen she didn't go about worrying about it no more she didn't go about that's not what the scripture says anyhow did she have mind battles no doubt but in the scriptures it's declared of her she begin to testify she begin to say hey I met somebody and he spoke to me and he showed me these things and he said it's not going to come from a man but it's going to come from almighty God it's going to come from the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost is going to overshadow me and I'm going to give birth to a man called Jesus amen and we know as she went to her her cousin's house amen that was some miles away and here she had been promised a son as well but yet she had become pregnant some 6 months but the baby had never kicked the baby had never moved there had been no life inside of her amen there had been nothing amen that has taken place but as it came together Amen brother brandom said he put her arms around Elizabeth and she be to tell her of all that the angel had told her and she be to tell her of all that had taken place the supernatural visitation and how God had moved and how the light came down and it be to speak to her and it began to tell her amen Behold a hands made of the Lord highly favored and he said and Elizabeth said oh come on tell me more about it and he said as he began to speak I said how can these things be he said ou'll not receive this from man but you're going to receive these things from the presence of almighty God and he said the Holy Ghost will overshadow me and and me will be born a child and we'll call his name Jesus and when that name be to be spoke for the first time amen here's Elizabeth with a dead baby and a dead womb and there was nothing happening on the inside of her but when Jesus spoke amen life be to jump on the inside of her he said I brother said I believe if the first time Jesus was ever spoke brought life I believe we ought to speak the name of Jesus because when Jesus the name of Jesus has spoke light comes around hallelujah amen that song sister Jessica sings I just want to speak the name of Jesus why is it so powerful cuz it's not speaking the name of Abraham is not speaking the name of some Prophet or some some president or some King no the king amen is speaking the name of the king and when you start speaking the name of Jesus Darkness starts fleeing a change begins to take place light begins to come down and the Darkness around you you may feel nothing but Darkness but just speak the name of Jesus come on somebody you might feel all gloomy and all doubtful and all this or that but if you can just start saying Jes Jesus and speak in the name of Jesus amen amen it'll it'll take place in your life amen we see here amen as that change begin to take place he said another light amen what was it showing he said what was that light showing on the hill of of of Bethlehem he said that light was declaring it wasn't no more God above us but now is God With Us it was a dispensation change that were taking place but on the day of Pentecost that light showed it wasn't no more God above us God with us but now it's God in us amen and a change took place and and he said on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell upon these people we said we're talking about people that were ungodly people that had sin in their life people that had denied him people that had walked away from him and the Holy Ghost fell upon these people and they acted like drunk men and women they staggered under the impact of that light come on now Hey listen we got a whole world that's staggering under the impact of [Applause] Darkness they're staggering like drunk men and and they don't know which way is right and which way is wrong they're staggering they don't know if it's a man or a woman or this that and the other what is it they're staggering in the Darkness but I want you to understand also the light has an effect upon you amen and they staggered like drunk men and women under the impact of the Holy Spirit and walked away wagging their heads and and these others walked away waging these men are drunk of new of some kind of wine and so forth he said but it was absolutely the light the word that had been prophesied made manifest as we heard Wednesday night if we're not preaching that pattern you're not preaching light you're preaching Darkness amen we know we wonder why our services can't ever get off the ground sometime it's because men have preached the move of the Holy Ghost right out of their churches and they preach Darkness instead of light had somebody tell me well I don't think that we we should think every service ought to be high all the time I don't think we should we think that it's going to be dancing and shouting and carrying on all the time I said well I I I don't think that either that's not what that's not what you know determines to me if it was a great service or not sure do I enjoy those times of course I do I've watch watch that into of that last service over and over cuz I enjoy it I enjoy that move in that in that manner but also enjoy times that I can't even hardly talk and tears are coming down on my face and I got my hands up I enjoy those moments too but I told my wife the other day I said you know I understand all of that and I understand that that's not that's not a problem but what I don't understand is how come we can't expect a service to be as high as [Applause] possible amen why can't we come with the expectation that every service is going to go as high as it possibly can [Applause] go amen I don't know about you but I'm W to go higher than this Earthbound creature that I am I want to go so high one day I want to be like EA I don't come back Timothy PR walk with God and want not because God took [Applause] him but we want to we want to put we want to limit the expectations and if we're not careful we'll preach in such a way that people don't expect anything brother Brandon preached expectations he said what you get is what you expect that's right amen you know it was light on the day of Pentecost so that was showing a change yes amen things that was about to take place amen men looked at it and said well that's just a bunch of just a bunch of crazy people they they're they're drunk already and and how and he said how can these things be it's only the third hour of the day we're not drunk on wine as you suppose but we are drunk on wine cuz in Joel chapter two it said amen in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and now sons and daughter of prophesy old men will see V dreams and the young men see Visions amen what was it he said yeah there is a wine you can get drunk on Amen there is something that can get you stimulated amen and get you to believe enough to move past your doldrums and move past your unbelief and move past your flesh and move past your pride and move past what you think and move passing to The Impossible right it's a light that that that showing a change you know I mentioned this actually at brother Jason's and this is part of what got me on this was you know there was a time brother brandom I believe had a dream or Vision I failed to look that part up but he had this moment that he heard this lamb that was caught in the bush that's right you heard that remember that story and he said by by and he said the closer he got to it it started by a M Town M Town and he said you know I didn't even know where miltown was now how far was that we went there about 20 minutes from Jeffersonville by a car and now you know that wasn't that far away and he didn't know where it was world has changed I told this too I I I can't ever get past this there's a there's a a black man that lives over close to brother Jeff's sister Esther uh that was somebody had talked to him about him his when ask him where where he met his wife and he said well she wasn't from these parts so where was she from he lives on Germantown Road said well she was on the other side of Homer but she wouldn't from these parts that's how much the t uh things have changed and so here he begins to ask around where's miltown and finally somebody told him and he goes up there and he begins to begins to walk down the street and he said he got him a soap box pulled it out and begin to preach next thing you know he gets a little church and things all that and he and he knows there's something going on then he hears about this woman this little girl at that had you know boy I I I tell you what you go back and listen to it you realize this little girl had been going to piano lessons and her uncle was taking her and brother brand said he ravaged her and that gave her tuberculosis think about that gave her tuberculosis and here she is for 9 months or nine years and some months and she's she had been crying out to God and she's almost to where she she has actually rubbed the paint off the off the bed post and things of grabbing a hold up but she had read a book and she had read of somebody else's healing and she said if God could do that for her then God can do that for me now her family didn't believe it her family was against it her family they didn't believe in the healing power of God they didn't believe in none of that they didn't believe in God was able to work miracles or do any kind of they was against it they was even against brother brand coming to their house and praying for their little girl that's right God have mercy what kind of spirits can get a hold of people and here they are and here he is and he said finally he didn't know what else to do but go pray and he said I got out there and I be to pray and I was like Lord I need your direction I've tried and ain't worked I don't know what to do and he said you know the Briars got started sticking me and he said I moved over and he said the mosquito started buzzing right you know that's how the devil wants to do just when you're about to press through and get into something he's always there to distract you the phone will ring this will happen that'll go on he's always there to try to keep you from it but he said if you'll just keep pushing through amen if you'll just keep pushing through amen God will show you something and he said about that time when I got into the spirit and I began to pray and God began to move he said I looked up and there was a light he said this same light the same light that was hanging there in that Dogwood Bush was shining right there and said the voice spoke and said go by way of Carter's for thus sayith the Lord she's going to be healed the light had come to declare it's time for a change amen she's been in this moment long enough she's been in this season long enough she's been in this disease long enough but I have come down to deliver Georgie Carter you're not going to have to do it William brandom I'm going to lead you and I'm going to show you how to how it's going to happen and he walks into that place and he begin to speak the word of God and he this little frail 30 something pound girl 50 something whatever it was almost little sticks for legs jumped up out of bed and she begin to run around praising God and she begin to go go out and kiss the grass and the trees and all of that why God the same one she read about had now come the lighted come into her room and it brought a change hallelujah hallelujah and you know what's so wonderful about that story I just caught just a few days ago amen she went to lessons to play the piano and she was ravished and trying you think God you think she would allow the devil to cram her life with some complex over that or some fear over that no sir as soon as she got delivered what did she go back to playing the piano Hallelujah you have to push past what you see and look to the Unseen I got a quote here you said well I don't see the pillar of fire well you know what brother Brandon said he didn't always see it either there's a quote right here I got it he said you know what the pillar of fire is here he said I don't see it with these two eyes he said but I see it by what his word said Hallelujah then we can have the same faith we may not see it with these two eyes but we can see it by what the word says and if what does the word said I'll never leave you or forsake you where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be what name the name above all names the name of Jesus Christ and when you speak that name light appears and darkness FS why do you think sometimes even while the preaching of the word is going forth what is happening light is being released amen and light can go and cut out darkness and people be delivered right at that moment why do you think in the scripture he said they shall lay hands upon the sick you know why cuz light is being released you can read it brother brownon talks about it he said W you lay hand he said them hands he said when you lay them on each other there's light that goes back and forth speaking of a change Saul on the road to Damascus going to put the Believers in Chains and persecute the Church of the Living God and a light shined on him and knocked him off his horse we can read about in Acts chapter 9 verse4 he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted I thought I was persecuting a Jew or a gentile I thought I was doing it to somebody you was but it wasn't to who you thought cuz behind that somebody was Jesus that's right amen I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it's is it it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and he trembled and astonished said Lord what will th have me to do and the Lord said arise and go into the City and it shall be told the light came and changed him from Saul to Paul amen he went from being a persecutor of the church to the messenger of the church that's a paradox amen the very one don't don't don't you know it took him a little while to trust old Paul amen he done throw a bunch of them in jail and he was persecuting the righteous amen and here he was coming against them and throwing them in jail and doing this bringing them before the law and all of a sudden he has a testimony I was on my way to throw you in jail I was on my way to throw you in jail and to get your wife and throw her in jail and your children and all this for preaching what you were preaching but on my way I met a light yeah and that light spoke to me and said Paul why persecutest thou me and here I thought it was you brother har but I realized right behind there it's no longer Jesus in the law but now it's in his grace a change and that light came and changed Paul to where he would now come from Saul the law to Paul Grace and he would begin to to go through the Old Testament and pull out what was what was pertaining to our day that's why he's a messenger same thing with brother brandom you wonder why didn't he pull it all out because he's a word prophet he knows what pertains to our day amen he knows exactly what's in there and so the light changed him from the persecutor to the messenger Peter was in jail he was bound held by two men by his side and two at the door you think they wanted that man out no no what we're talking about the same one that said I don't know him I wasn't with him I wasn't a part of him I don't know who you and he did it three times and cursed what what was the curse about he was calling Down Heaven if I've told a lie let me be cursed I love how brother brother Aaron brought that out on Wednesday night and go tell Peter what I love about that is even in his death burial resurrection and Peter denying him all through that he woke up and come out of the grave and his mind was still on Peter Peter you're mine I gave you the Keys of the Kingdom and I ain't Chang my mind about you I I you're I've called you when you was nothing but a lowly fisherman and you didn't know nothing about anything but I saw you and I saw you in that moment I saw you as you were and I said God I looked at you and I called you by who you were amen the light came and changed you and here's Peter a denier and now he's in jail not for denying for preaching the gospel for causing such a St hey they want to throw him in jail for it you're talking about a change that have been brought in his life hey he faced all kinds of things and he never one more time backed up from it but in the moment that he was in that darkness of that cell guarded and was going to be kept there amen what happened a light came in Hallelujah I don't know what you're jailed in with this morning but whatever you're jailed in with the light can still break through it I don't care how many Devils have been assigned you to try to keep you bound there's a light that can make them powerless I don't care how many doors is in your way and bars is holding you there's a light that'll make you walk through them Hallelujah come on somebody you remember the jail housee you used to be in and you thought there was no way out you thought there was no way out of your drugs or your alcohol or your sin or your pornography but all of a sudden a light Shone upon you and it changed you woo and he said he walked Peter by the first gate and the second gate and the third gate into the city Oh Glory to God I'm looking at men and women here that were bound by Demons of Hell there had been a sign to keep you there there had been a sign that you didn't ever leave there had been a sign to hold you in Chains I've been a signed to hold you in bars I've been a signed to keep you down but a light came down woo and it led you past sanctification justification sanctification into the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that same light is in the building right now that same light is in the building right now and is here to declare I have come to change someone it led him from prison into [Applause] Freedom Light Came in the darkest of times the Dark Ages all truth had been blacked out and the devil thought I've got it now I've smashed him I've killed him I've throw him in prison you heard about it Wednesday I pulled them apart I cut their guts out ain't nobody going to live it now and the light come shining and Luther catches this light and he Nails his thesis to the wall the just shall live by faith what was it he had saw they were charging for what God had freely given they were charging for repentance they were charging to get you out of hell P Purgatory they was charging charging charging charging charging he said but that is not what Christ done Christ came and died freely that you might freely live and the light struck him and he said the just shall live by faith that was Light Light Came Upon Wesley here he was kicked out of churches he would he would do whatever but he would preach and preach and preach and light came and dawned upon his life in darkness that there has to be a sanctification there has to be a a clean out a cleaning up light would come on a zeusa street hello somebody I know some people preach against it so much they want to turn it into darkness that wasn't darkness that was light but just as Darkness got into Luther's movement and got into Wesley's movement and got into the Pentecostal movement yeah Darkness got into it but when it came it was light it was the Life of Christ moving through the body so all of a sudden now the life has moved up into the head it's moved up amen up and up and up and up into the tassel past all of that past the the Shar into the weed again into the grain again and all of a sudden we don't need the arms we don't need the legs we don't need none of that because we're up here all of that was light people want to do away with the gifts why don't you do away with sanctification justification there was just a much a part as rest of the restoration as anything else amen but here they are moving right up light came it was also light that would come upon a birth of a little boy in a little Kentucky cabin and there he was just born just at the morning morning right before the break of the morning it was testified over and over and over of a light that be to circle around his bed and that light would follow that little boy and he would hear things see things and it would cause him to have so much stomach troubles and this that and the other being tore up one saying it was God one say most of them say it was the devil so crazy and here he is wondering what a what I go to my pastor and he says is this and I go to this one they say it's this and I go to this and he goes and finds himself in a cabin and he's sitting in the darkness and all of a sudden he hears and a light appears and the light begins to Glow brighter and brighter until out of that light steps a man about six foot tall hair down around his shoulders white garment Olive complexion so I've been sent from the presence of God to tell you of your unusual birth and he begins to tell him the change that's about to take place you're you're I I've called you for a purpose because you're going to go before all the world and you're going to preach and you're going to show signs and these two signs will be here you'll have a sign in your hand and then you'll come to the place that you know the very secrets of the heart so you're going to pray for kings and potentates what was it doing it was signifying A change is taking place it was saying listen you're going to be no longer just a Kentucky preacher but you're going to be known worldwide and and you're going to get come to a place that you'll pray for the sick and he said I want you to understand nothing will stand before you right not even cancer nothing will stand before you nothing was stand before you what was it it was declaring a change amen that what showing him how that what he was experiencing was not a devil as some were saying but it was the pillar of fire the light the fire that came service after service after service and that light would make such a change in William bram's life till his ministry would go around the world world and around the world and around the world and millions be touched and healed and delivered because of that light and he never got away from that light he spoke of that light all the way through his ministry he would come down to every end of every service in a healing service and he' say now you know what I'm waiting on he said because William brandham can't heal he can't do anything but if he'll come if he'll come and and and and and say what I back up what I've said to be the truth and then all of a sudden things would change and he go he is here what was it it was a light that came down amen he is here and I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God and wheelchairs would be emptied and CS would be emptied and spirits of every kind will be Del people will be delivered from what was it it was the light that was around them it would come in such a manner that we now have it as a picture on our wall and it's more than just a picture that picture was not about William brandom that picture was about the light it was speaking of a change a change of dispensation a change that was coming upon people that had been sitting in darkness was about to see see a great light Amen brother BR we know the story how brother Bosworth took up that brother best on his debate and he then he comes down he says now I know brother brandom was in the building if he wants to come and dismiss the audience he can come to the platform brother brandom I know you're sitting here and everybody was beginning to look around said I know you're sitting and if you want to come and dismiss the audience a word of prayer all right but you're under no obligation he said my brother Howard sat there and said hey do you you just sit still I said all right I what we're playing all of a sudden I felt something moving and I my wife grabbed me by the hand said honey I said sweetheart just a moment the angel of the Lord is here and that's he said Howard said Bill you're not going down there look people are screaming and carrying on you're not going on down there I said Howard stand aside son the angel of the Lord is now telling me to go down there and ushers begin to throw their hands together made a line and I be to walk up the down to the platform and I said I do not claim to be a Divine healer don't think hard of Mr best although he had hired some photographers to come listen to this he hired a commercial photographer at the Douglas Studios write them and see if you want to find out about it connected with the American photo photographer Association he had hired Mr kipperman of the of that Association and all this and he said he had done all this to try to prove God didn't do what he said he does so then when I started to go down the platform they said no more pictures so forth because they had taken pictures in the meeting they would sell them it's not right commercializing anything that belongs to God that's not right that's the wrong thing to do so we stopped all the pictures so they didn't let pictures be taken so don't think anyone anyone think hard of Mr best I think he was sincere to he look down the row of stretchers and Cs and things laying here these people laying there with cancer it's going to be dead in a few days if God don't help them the doctors are giving up on them they've done their very best where they can't do no more I believe he sincere he said he felt sorry for those people he can't feel sorry for those people and then try to Rob them and black out the only hope they have of living how can you feel sorry for them like taking food away from a starving man and saying you feel sorry for him said I don't believe that was sincere but anyway anyhow he come running to the platform brandom yes sir as a man I admire you as a preacher I don't think much of you that's a paradox so brother brandom said that's mutually felt I don't think the prophet would say it well he did he said he walked on off the platform that was all and I said all right look I don't claim to be a Divine healer I was reminding my Lord when he came said come down they said come down and perform and let us see and we'll believe you and some devil he was on the cross they put a rag around his face and said if you'll tell us who hit you we'll believe you be a prophet he knew the woman at the well she had five husband he knew Nathaniel he knew all things he knew the fish had a corn in his mouth if you're a prophet prophesy tell us who hit you and he didn't open up his mouth and they put him on the cross said if you be the Son of God come down and let us see prove it that same Soul Spirit them preachers had back there that same Spirit lives now in other preachers right on down through every age you don't have to be a preacher to preach a gospel and stand behind the pull pit your life is a written epistle your life preaches more than anything else does said heal this one let me see heal this one he past the P of Bethesda heal one person and they was questioning him and he said he just simply said verily verily I say unto you I can do nothing except the father show me for the father loves the son and shows him what to do and He will show you greater things than the healing of this diabetic or tuberculosis or whatever that you may Marvel but I can do nothing except I see a vision of what the father has done they said well what about these lame Hal blind Twisted with Twisted all of this he said I can't heal no one this I do say when I was born up in the state of Kentucky according to my dear Mother and those that were with her and has been Vindicated through all my life there came a light in the room in that little old house there a little Shack no floor in it didn't even have a window just a little door and they pushed it around about 5:00 in the morning and that light circled in just about the breaking of day I said since that time that light has been with me it's the angel of God he met me in person a few years ago down through my life he told me things that have happened and I've told him just as he told me and I challenge anybody at any place to go to any City where I was raised or anywhere that a statement has ever been made in the name of the Lord what it came exactly the way it said it would now not by me it was by him that light I said it would it he's always told the truth he's always he said if he doesn't back up what he said he never made it he never said it but if he made the statement God will stand behind what he promised he said I don't know how that makes you feel he I don't he said don't think I'm off off my sense of balance I know where I am but I know what I'm talking about every man that's born of the spirit of God every woman knows what they're talking about that whether you can appropriate the faith I don't know but what God says it's the truth and if I told the truth he will testify to the truth and at that moment coming down over the hard and S was and this excited this photographer he saw it and he got a he he got a picture of snapped a picture God will testify I will say no more Mr best took a lot of pictures of him with brother Bosworth with his finger in his face for his propaganda they take it back Mr kipperman takes it back and he goes to goes to uh try to take the negatives and take them into the room and do all their scientific stuff they did did with pictures and stuff or do with pictures and and he comes back and he begins to scream because it was only one picture of that night that took all those others that with Mr Bess with his finger in his face they didn't take something destroyed the negative hallelujah oh my God don't you know the devil thinks he's got a lot of pictures of you he got a lot of pictures of you in a barroom you with

seventh grade education things they said was fanaticism God God has Vindicated to be the truth to a scientific World once and for all with that light he came down for more than just a picture he came down to make a statement Revelations 10:1 I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and rain upon his head and his face was as it were a sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open now if you read just a few verses chapters before it was a closed book and John's weeping but now the angel has it the light has it and it's opened a change that took place and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth a change had taken place I have come down to take Dominion amen and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up his head hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and things that are in on the earth things that are there in the sea things that are in that should be time no longer time for denominational ages no longer they're no longer in power sin is no longer in power the time of darkness is over with for my people oh sure darkness is going to continue on just like it did in Egypt just like it did when Jesus was here on Earth but his people Contin saw a great light and those that sat in darkness moved to the light amen this is what he's saying the time amen of denominations and there's ideas and their Creeds and their dmas is over with it's time for a change and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is up open upon the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up who is John representing here the bride amen there's a change of dispensation from the angel to the people amen and you take the book and you eat the book but it'll make thy belly bitter Hey listen sermons like Wednesday night's going to Bitter all to tear you up it'll get you in some soft spots I'm not even going to ask for hands how manyan his feet were stomped on but if you eat the book it's going to cause some turmoil it's going to cause all that old ungodliness to move out and that darkness and light's going to win light's going to win and light and he said but it'll be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out the Angel's hands and ate it up eat it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I eat it my belly was bitter and he said thou must prophesy again it's time for a change amen from the prophet to the prophecy for the bride now now now it's not just a God above us God With Us God in us or now even God visiting a prophet it's God and a bride right and the light has come down to show there's a change that is taking place he said this bride will be the final voice to the final age I believe brother brownan was part of this bride but this bride will be the final voice to the final age yes 1 Thessalonians 5 says but of the times and Seasons Brothers you have no need I write unto you for you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the the Lord shall come as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them and travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness Hallelujah I thought there'd be a few praise the Lords there cuz this is our scripture Paul even though he thought he was going to fulfill this he didn't right he didn't know there was going to be seven more Church ages the difference between us and Paul is we know we are in the last one that's right so this is speaking about the body change so this is the last age so Paul is actually writing to you hallelujah hallelujah when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren on you're not part of this Darkness you're not part of this destruction cuz the light has come you're not part of this that that day should over or that day would take you as overtake you as a thief but ye are all the children of light the children of light and the children of the day and we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep and do as others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken the night but let us who are of the day be sober put it on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation for God Oh Glory for God has not appointed us to wrath woo I'm not going through the tribulation period I'm not going through the torment I'm going in a Rapture how do you know there's going to be a Rapture cuz the light is come and declare the change is upon us not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ oh God I pray this shuts ever line devil up wants to come tell our young people you're going in Tribulation you're appointed for wrath you're appointed for no I'm not God didn't put you here by accident he didn't put you here amen for no purpose and no being and just I see if he could he put you in a certain family that believed a certain message and maybe today they don't believe it no more but God still put you there and God still is orchestrating your life and God is still moving on your behalf and God is still CU he has not appointed you to Wrath I need to say that again cuz somebody needs to hear he has not appointed you to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep whether we alive and remain or we go by the grave we should live together with him wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do Ephesians 5 says you are were sometimes in darkness but now are ye light you Ephesians 5:8 for you were sometimes Darkness but now are ye light in the Lord therefore walk as children of the light sometimes Darkness but now was Darkness but now wasn't doubts and frustrations but now what bound but now wasn't all kinds of sin and ungodliness but now was all confused but now from that time God called you from a life of darkness by light and it has caused a change you may not know exactly the moment that happened it may not be as dramatic as it was with Saul or Moses but you just know that one day I was this and now I'm this I I believe we ought to ought to know that that we know that we know that we know but it can happen in just a moment it could happen at a quick repentance at an altar your seat or and the car wherever you say well I don't know about what I do go back a few years and look at our brother Jason Ron's Post in a car what it Miss a red light or red light something happened and got him angry and he said he cursed and it brought conviction to his heart and right there in that car he said Lord I'm sorry I want to give my myself to you God can use whatever he wants to use he used a mechanical light for goodness sakes he can use a donkey he can use whatever he wants however he wants just know that to yesterday I was one thing but today I'm different and the difference is the light the difference is him he made the difference in my life I just say I'm trying to trying to help somebody here because some people some people they look for that light to just beam and knock them off a horse it don't always happen like that it can be some situation I I heard of a young man I believe it was your nephew who just walked into his room and the pray he's a gone out in the world would maybe not even think think about God walks in his room and the angel was there and it met him and it changed him in his room I want to ask you why was that angel there well the same reason that angel came to Peter there was some people that was praying for Peter and said God we got your son over there in the jail house go get him out and sometimes it can happen in such a supernatural way it takes you a long time to believe it even happened amen he walked up to those very same people that were praying for him and he knocks on the door and d one of the girl I think it was Dorcas or somebody like that came to him open the door and say I Peter and slam the door in his face it can happen sometimes you have a hard time believing it happened but just keep watching just keep watching it'll come and it'll keep on coming it'll move and it'll keep on moving doubts will fall off chain will fall out unbelievable H off hallelujah amen let's get in one mind right now for a moment if we can all begin to pray for our loved ones and and those that are out there in prison and those that are out there and the devil is said I got guards over them they ain't coming out but a little mama will begin to pray and a daddy begin to pray and a church begin to pray and God rich in Mercy went to where they were it might be a light that gets him put up red light or whatever it is God get them go listen if you would like to from that time he says you know as a little boy girl child some things happened that you can point back to and say from that time such and such has taken place and from that time thus and thus he said maybe the immoral woman could say something like this I was a virtuous girl I was raised in a strict Christian Home by Godly father and mother one day I was just as pure as a lily until one day one night I took a ride with a certain boy and we drove up to a dance hall and from that time you can always relate back to sometime something happened whether it's good or whether it's bad he said here not long ago he was in New York City with the Dr bir he was a pastor of bethl Tabernacle they had some missions down on the calls it the Bowery he I wanted to visit it I used to hear as a little boy song It's a picture of a life on the other side someone who's fell by the way of Soul that's gone to out with the tide that might be happy some might have been happy someday there were men laying all under that great tra Vel some of them perfectly helpless laying on the street awful impure conditions there there was Chinatown just below it where they'd buy all their dope and drugs and things so I said to Dr bird perhaps these men come from real bad homes never had a chance he said very surprising brother brandham those men many of them were at one time great men hear that fellow laying over there see that fell lady I know him let's see if we can wake him up and I went over and I shook him gray whiskers all over his face stuff running from his mouth his shirt dirty he almost smelled like a pig pin I thought must be somebody's Daddy some poor soul that fell by the way I said what's your name sir and he wanted me to give him some money for a drink I said oh I can't do that I'm a minister just come to I couldn't give you money to drink I'll buy you something to eat but tell me how did it ever happen how was your you always in this condition I said no sir he began to talk to him and he said you're a minister I said yes sir he said help me up and I put my arm around and tried to stand him up he was just too helpless he just kind of squatted down on the street and follow fell over and I stooped down leaned him over on my shoulder said mister he said mister I I don't want you don't want W hard to believe my story I suppose but no more than five city blocks from here I was a president of that bank right there said sir is that true he said go ask them I said 'well what happened I come home one day where I had a lovely family and I found a Dear John Letter laying on the table I loved her so much I couldn't forget her and from that time he said there you are from that time that time marked something something marks it you can ask the drunk the alcohol when did you start drinking I never drank a day in my life until one night I was out with a bunch of fell in a little celebration took my first drink and from that time it starts something he said I talk he said I talked to a lady here not long ago trying to Rite her with her husband I said bring your husband and come see me she said I can't do it brother brand I said why can't you I just don't want to face it again well you going talk with him and see if he'll talk me back take me back I said what's so bad she said brother brand John and I were married married I was as virtuous as a woman could be we moved into a neighborhood went to a church did what was right one day a tall tall dark handsome salesman knocked on a door and I invited him in and from that time I've tried to straighten up every new year and start back again but I've never been able to do it from that moment here some time ago I went to an emergency room in a certain building there was supposed to be insanity and I walked through the door and there was this lovely pretty young woman about 25 years old sitting there looking at me and I said how do you do some of them in straight jackets and cursing and filled with demon power and I said well it's kind of hard to tell where to start praying first and she said if you don't mind sir start with me and I said with you she said yes sir I said you're not a patience he said I sure am well what's wrong with you said well I'm supposed I'm insane said sure don't look like it could you listen to my story certainly she said when I was a young girl brother brandham I was raised in a real Christian home I started going with a boy that smoked first thing you know I was smoking one night he spiked the coke with whiskey and started me drinking and then I started from that into prostitution and I lived in the very gutters of the blackest of hell I served four years in Catholic institution a good Shepherd's home in there I turned a new page and I said when I get out of here I'm going to go straight and I meant it but as soon as I got with that crowd again it was all over did two years in a women's State Penitentiary here in this state then I thought truly I was reformed I came home joined another church told the pastor pastor we went down the altar talked it over I just can't keep from it I it started again one night I said lady don't you want to be a real lady and have a husband and babies like a real woman she said oh with all my heart but look at me now I've tried but you haven't tried my Lord yet Hallelujah yes I have too brother brandom I've signed pledges and vows and made promises that's not what I'm talking about as oldfashioned the way it seems to be it's a devil yeah yeah he said she said I always believe that he drives you to do things you don't want to do I believe that would there be hope for me I said certainly and we knelt down and prayed and a while she raised up brother beautiful woman great soft looking eyes tears running down her cheeks he said now brother brandom I believe I'm going to go out and make a new life say sister dear you ain't done nothing but turn a page I won't doing no good you go back and do what you've done before stay until God speaks back to you we got down again together and prayed and I left her pray come back she said after a while she rose up from there and she looked around the room those big eyes looking at me she said something has happened to me and I said now you got it now you got it you don't have to learn new pages it's over with from that time she was a changed person she's married got a lovely home and two children now and you can point her fingers to at anytime something that happened to her that was Immortal Life it was a light when that light comes Life Changes there's something that can happen to a person you cannot be the same after this you meet this God you meet this light for yourself and when a man meets God he's changed something happens to him he's never the same once he meets God face to face so he talks about Abraham Abraham needed a change he done got on now on a 100 years old his wife up to about 90 it looked impossible he said but all of a sudden a light came down to earth and it picked up dust and it created a body and it created two more bodies for Angels to walk in and he comes walking down a Dusty path and Abraham looks up there those three men he said my Lord see Abraham didn't have no problem with the godhead he knew there was only one God and he goes and prepares him a meal is going to host him I think that's a good thing to do when God comes by be prepared to entertain him stay a while I think we learned a valuable lesson Wednesday night stay a while if you want more of God just stay for a moment just like when he walked down the road of me and he made on as if he was going to go further and they constrained him to come in here and eat with me and when they brought him into that inner Place into that moment he began to break bread unto them just as he did when he fed 5,000 you want more of God just stay a moment allow God to speak to you allow that's what we learned just with this girl right here she tried too quickly to get up amen we want to be prepared to allow God and to entertain him and say God I have a need I need you to speak to me I need you to touch my heart and here he had it and he goes prepares a calf sandwich and some milk and we've been hearing about it from our pastor but he needed a change he heard the promise he heard the word God had spoke to him about himself and and and his wife Sarah and how that they was going to receive a child but he knew I can't do it that's I can't do it in this Old Rag of a body I'm in that ain't possible Sarah back there fuming that morning laughing scoffing she knew she couldn't do it she had all kinds of faults and failures she needed a change but a light came down and that light be to discern her heart and begin to tell her what was was going on in her life and how she was laughing at the promise and all the things but don't worry she's going to receive a child amen and they got that promise and brother R said that light begin to change their body and it changed them from a old man and woman to a young man and woman it's a mystery of the change written right there in scripture amen we know it is common knowledge many people glass right over and one don't even know that it even happened matter of fact was was speaking to some people one time and they didn't think the Rapture even was real and we begin to show them Enoch and show them Abraham and Sarah and all these saying they say hey this is not just a fable it's written in scripture but light had to show on it and light changed these bodies from a old ragged woman to a woman a king would want and that light is changing you from an old ragged human being into somebody a king desires amen a king desireth thee he don't want you in your Rags of humanity he don't want you in your old feeble body he don't want you in your old down Tred State and your mind battles he wants you as he is so therefore he has to send the light down to produce the change and here we can read about all all the ones through the scriptures and we can go through different others again but I want to get down to a few things as we bring this down to a close of course I always get moved by the woman at the well had a lot of husbands made a lot of mistakes you had a lot of husbands a lot of people that tried to change your name come on now try to put all kind of names on you doubt unbelief fear pornography smok and drinking whatever kind of name denominational names all kind of husbands and you left one trying to get away and you're trying to find Freedom and you find yourself at a well and all in her mind she is trying on her own she had her water pot and she's walking up there to get her get some water and this voice of this little frail looking homely looking body said it was no beauty that we should desire him sitting over there and he's looking at her watching her as she walks to the well watching her she begins to dip her jug down in there to get a drink and he said woman will thou give me a drink she saidwell it ain't customary for samarit for Jew to speak to a Samaritan you know it's very religious he said if you knew who I was you would ask me of a drink and she said well ask you of a drink what good would that do you don't have a water pot the drink he wanted to give her had nothing to do with the Earthly water pot that's right and he begins to reveal himself what was it the light came to visit her and it begin to illuminate her life to the point he could tell her and I and I Can't Help It The Chosen picked it up as he begin to discern her heart and tell her what her husbands were like tell her how she liked oh he he smelt of oranges on their wedding night and she loves oranges and then I don't just just part but he begin to discern her heart begin to tell her about what she had done all all the things she had done so apparently he told her a lot of details about her life and he brings her to a point that she begins to realize this ain't more this ain't just a Jew this ain't just a Prophet this is something more than a prophet and he said that the Messiah would come he would tell us all thing he said I he and she left her water pot and ran into the city what was it the light had come and changed her so she wasn't no more worried about Earthly things she wasn't worried about her old water pot no more her other husband her name had been changed what a mighty God we speak we speak of today listen to this he said the Lord Jesus would tell me what you're here for I couldn't heal you if you're sick I couldn't tell you on my own only I couldn't heal you I couldn't give you desire it'll be your faith in him but I only claim he raised from the dead you understand well may God grant it sister just talking to you to contact your spirit but now in the audience the audience can still hear my voice between she and I comes the same light that you see in the picture and she's going away from me now I see her doing work she's very nervous she drops things She's suffering with skin trouble which is cancer in her skin skin that's thus sayith the Lord is that the truth if it is raise your hands thank Jesus your by your stripes say thank Jesus by your stripes I'm Healed now just to speak to you other things would take place do you believe that now let's talk to the woman just to see what he would say if we could just get just just let's talk what was it he said he was wrong it was something another I've seen you do something drop something do something I have something in the house yes a skin it's cancer in the skin she's bothered with trouble another trouble that's on the side in her breast is that right yes

joy come into your heart and you'll be begin to Rejoice what was it the light settled over you and it begin to change things around you he said when you're healed I see a white light that same light goes around and just blesses it's like a blessing I was just watching something the other day talking about the law of reproduction do you know that when a seed goes into an egg and when it comes and it fertilizes a burst of light they can catch it on cameras a burst of light takes place we're talking about natural how much more the spiritual and people want to think there's something about somebody because they act a little funny listen you have that burst of light happen in you one time and see how you going to act it's a change something takes place he had to change Abraham's and Sarah's body so he come down in the light he knows the secret of he knew the secret of Earth the next thing was the change of the body in order to receive the promised son that's the next thing in line now the Rapture of the church the changing we which are alive and remain shall not not prevent them that are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound the dead of Christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment and a twinkling of eye we've got to have a changed body to meet him in the air for the Rapture the next thing to the children of Abraham how many
