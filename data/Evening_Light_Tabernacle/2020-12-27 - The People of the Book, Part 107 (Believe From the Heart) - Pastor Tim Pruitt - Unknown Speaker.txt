care is upon us you who said i'll never leave you or forsake you i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world what a promise that is today and we're just looking today that you would just anoint us one more time for another service as we give ourselves to you lord as you've laid at little fragments of thoughts upon our hearts and we just ask lord you'll speak to us now you reveal yourself to us through the word lord bless us together in jesus name amen amen god bless you amen it's good to be in the house of the lord one more sunday amen as we marked them all off during the year and now we've come to the last sunday of the year soon the last service of the year that'll be thursday night i hope that you can come to that and we just believe the lord will speak to us to the word it'll be regular time seven o'clock so you know you should be able to make it if you hadn't already made plans for other things amen but um we kind of spontaneous around here so we just kind of announce it as we go amen i want to wish you all god's blessings i hope you had a wonderful christmas time with your family and that you have been so blessed and uh looking forward to spending time together with you in the year to come amen 2020 has been a year of miracles we've just seen the holy spirit just do many many many wonderful things and save and deliver and set free and heal amen he's been with us every service we've had some just tremendous times in this presence amen and we're looking for great times ahead amen god bless you john chapter 14 and verse 12. i want to visit these scriptures again this morning as we conclude our our year to this year we spoke on a lot of different things that i think has been really important pertinent to us in this day and hour john 14 12 says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that i will do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it and then mark 11 21 we'll read from there as you remember jesus had passed by fig tree and finding no fruit on it he cursed it and peter calling to remembrance said unto him master behold the victory which thou curses is withered away and jesus answered said unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said and shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen god bless you can be seated as we looked over the christmas season and time and many many scriptures and thoughts has come to me and i thought as the as um we observed this time in remembrance not that the lord was born on um this time of the year but that he that is just the time that the world is set aside to remember and to observe the birth of the lord and of course it's coupled together with pagan holidays and other things as well um as they have done but still you know to for us it's all about christ amen that god did send a gift into the world and i think about the words that were spoken where is he king of the jews and these were spoken by the wise men as they were seeking him and it just resounds to me today of where is he king you know where is he really truly the king in whose hearts in whose lives i i spoke last sunday on the call for sincerity and i i think it is really time that we make him truly the king that he is truly the king of our lives and that we are part of his domain and you know and then we were looking here in the scripture and i i could not help but remember and think of the qualifications that jesus gives as he as he gives these words these are powerful words that are laid out in the scripture where that um you know that he said if you ask anything in my name i will do it and then he then he says have faith in god and you know sometimes we we wonder do i have faith can i have faith you know do i have faith for for healing or for this miracle or for this need but this is not what he asked you to do he said have faith in god is god able to do it is he able to bring healing or deliverance or this move this mountain that is needed to be moved have faith in god and this is where the requirement lays that your faith is laid not in your ability or even your faith or how strong your faith is or how great of faith you got or how weak it is but that you your faith lays in god and his word that can never fail and then these two things that he said ask anything in my name and i will do it and there there is a truth that lays there because it is only when we come in his name representing him representing his desires and what he wants done with the word and then then the other is shall not doubt in their heart and again this is what we're going to speak on this morning of of believing from the heart because this is the real pre requisite of mountains moving and as we said your mountain may not be a little mountain but jesus now when he was looking it was a little mountain he said if you say to this mountain be thou removed but again we don't have a need for that mountain to be moved but you've got things in your life you've got situations in your heart that you need moved and they're mountains to you they're impossible situations that you know you're incapable of getting around getting over going through but god is able to move that mountain but it comes from the point of when we don't doubt in our heart so there must be a belief from the heart so these are the things that we're going to be uh discovering today as we look at it and i just want to remind you again of what brother branham would tell us in the sermon in albuquerque god in hiding himself in simplicity and and he would talk about a born-again son or daughter of god and he said the blood of jesus so thoroughly cleanses there's no more nothing that the complete word of god rests in them that the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the holy ghost now without the holy ghost there's no creative power amen but with the holy ghost there is creative power and this holy ghost is a creator and he makes things comes to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes god in action how many wants to see god in accent amen this ought to be the desire of our heart now as i said this don't happen at the whim of our human spirit remember this is the holy spirit using your vocal cords speaking through you saying the right things amen and it don't it just does not happen at the whim of your own human spirit where you have these desires or you want this done and and and but it's where a man is so in tune with god that he knows what god wants done with his word amen but but then god could use their voice to move mountain and this is the goal is to become so yielded to god that's why i spoke the sermon on sincerity is because the whole key to the whole thing is to come to it with sincerity to be yielded to god to know what he wants done amen to be moved by the spirit not even your own human compassion we look a lot of times with human compassion and we would fix this problem or we would solve this situation or or even you know if we had that power to do we would heal this person or whatever but to find the the true will of god what god wants done with his word so now there are two thoughts that balances the other and one seems to be of a more of a spontaneous action brother branham would preach about this and we'll refer to some of it perhaps today of why christ speak your commission just why are you crying to me speak you know put you know act on the word put it into into place and into play and make it make it happen so one seems to be spontaneous and the other that he preached was called paul a prisoner of jesus christ and he would he would preach these sermons back to back where he would preach on that spontaneous instantaneous commissioned son of god acting there with a divine authority and yet then he would balance it out with paul a prisoner of jesus christ amen that he was such a prisoner until um you know he he could not move until god said move that he was so yielded so yoked to christ until he could only obey what christ said to do so when when he was moved on by the holy spirit and and this is what i i'd like to see our church as a people learn to yield herself to be moved on by the holy spirit a people yielded insensitive to the working of the holy ghost and to do that it will require more sincerity and many even even the the whole of coming to christ and repenting of your sins it takes a dead earnestness it takes a real sincerity no holding back you know years ago i remember a girl that was kind of going like one of my brothers and you know she was going to straighten up a little bit so that she could uh go with with him to win his favor and whatever she took all her makeup and all her cosmetics and everything and put them in a nice um plastic bag and sealed them up and went and buried them well i mean you know they were right handy when she wanted to go get them again when it didn't work out you see you can not come to christ holding anything back there has to be a complete total surrenders where that you become a prisoner to jesus christ that you yield yourself completely sold out amen holding nothing back and this is a problem many times you know many times people will come to repent around the altar and they do it and they're in their mind but i'm gonna have to give up this and i'm gonna have to give up that and i'll have to i'll lose this friend or i won't be able to do this anymore whatever else and all of those things are you know they're holding on to this all the time trying to say i want to give you my life god and they will never give it because they got a hold of something else that they extend greater than christ and the gospel will only do you any good when you make a full surrenderance you see all all your tears you're weeping you're crying you're you're mourning oh you can be mourning over what you got to give up or you know what kind of life that you really enjoy living and i know i can't do that and be christ too and all of that but you've got to come to that point in your life where you make that full surrender paul a prisoner of jesus christ it is only then where that you really can believe from the heart this is a problem that we face so many times why that so many go down a dry center and come up a wet one when they're baptized because the word of god is if we will repent it will turn from our sins and we will be baptized in his name he would give us the gift of the holy ghost and you make god a liar if he doesn't do that amen because but but when every time you can go right back to the repentance to the surrenders so it takes a full surrender but not only that but it's not just at your conversion that you make that surrenders but your whole life you become a prisoner of jesus christ amen that you're not your own it's not your own thoughts it's not your own way that you're trying to convey amen but it's it is that you want god's will to be done the mountains got to be moved but does god want that mountain moved and when you get in sync with god's word and what god's thoughts are about it then and you can believe from the heart that things are going to happen but until then you're just wasting your breath amen now of course you know the thing about it is is that um many of us get the wrong idea of what we're what we're really supposed to be and what a christian is going to be here in the end time or even even what a prophet is to be you know brother branham talked about this and the message inspiration in fact there's quite a few that i i i they're so redundant i find so many of them that i can't read them all but just a few choice ones this morning where he says god doesn't always tell his prophets everything that's going to happen he just tells him what he wants to god is sovereign so you see prophets are men they are not god they are passions like we have this is why the bible would say about elijah he said elijah a man of light passion is us he said he prayed earnestly that it not rain you see it required an earnest prayer to get the word to come to pass to where elijah could believe from the heart amen and then so yet he knew what god's word was he knew that there was a drought that was abroad he knew there would have to come an end to it and here he brings them right down to the challenge but he prayed earnestly so you know many times you know today it's that frivolous um you know i i'm going to speak this or i'm quoting this scripture or i'm i'm doing a name and claim it type thing rather than coming in with sincerity and honesty and earnesty now again impress every present water from the rock brother branham said i prayed for you all and i need you all to pray for me what a prophet needing us to pray for him he said so the holy ghost holy spirit would just leave me exactly where i should go he said i prayed for you but i need you to pray for me so that i'll make no mistake amen because all of us as humans we're still subject to making mistakes and he said many times you see people thinks that a prophetic gift that god just says i'll pick you up right here and set you down here and you and you just go over here and he does he doesn't tell you all those things if he did then what kind of overcoming faith did you have see he lets you stand alone more than anybody else and he said you could all come to me and ask for certain things and he's never failed yet he's given you the answer that's right yeah but i ask him for things for myself and many times he just left me alone see just lets me go ahead and walk into it and i have things now that i have to solve out myself and decisions i have to make and this is such a vital one until i cannot exactly make it until i'm sure that it's him speaking to me and he won't give me a vision and he just lets me alone so i'm just setting as an orphan like this morning i don't know which way to turn so i've committed it to the lord now you can see here is a prophet of even a seventh church age messenger that is in such a place that he he is required to seek the lord and man it's not just handed to him on a platter it just doesn't fall out of the skies it's something that he has to dedicate himself and earnestly contend for and this is what the scripture is saying earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints it's something you got to put everything you have into it it's not something that just going to come easy because you're here in laodicea you are fraught with every kind of situation amen there's every kind of thing going on around you every kind of distraction all kinds of voices that will crowd out the voice of god are you with me and you're going to have to press into it with all your heart remember it's the day you seek me with all your heart that's the day you find me no half-hearted way it's gonna work no i have sincerity is going to work it's going to take putting everything you got into it you say brother tim is is that so let me just tell you you know daniel daniel was looking into the scripture and he could read by the books he could read by the books of where they were that the time for being in babylon was over amen that the 70 years had expired that god had told jeremiah they would spend down in the land of babylon the word was there to be fulfilled but somebody had to start praying for his fulfillment and god begins to move on the heart of daniel and he said i've read in the books amen and we ought to be able to read in the books that we're here at the end of the laodicean age that the last messenger has come that we're here in the last days amen that evil men and seducers watch worse and worse and that because iniquity abounds the love of many wax coals and and we see the the situations that we're living in in this kind of time and daniel began to set his face toward god to pray but it took three weeks 21 days before the angel come and he said i was held back by the prince of babylon prince of persia right i was held back from coming you know no doubt you know here daniel's the third ruler in the kingdom no doubt in the middle of his prayers you know he's he's pulled this way and somebody wants an answer here and you know there's got this has to be done and you know he's distracted here and and here he's he's pulling there but there's another war going on and that's with the prince of persia who's keeping life so busy and i want you to know the prince that rules laodicea the evil one is doing everything that he can to keep you so harried and pulled down and worried and your mind on everything else and constantly fraught with every kind of trouble till you can't find the will of god for your life but daniel kept pressing he said now i heard you from the first day you prayed but because of this because of these obstacles that was that came and the prince of persia put in my way it hindered me from getting to you many of you are seeking an answer and perhaps you're desiring something but are you perseverant maybe you give up just before the angel gets to you i you know i that brings to my remembrance a man in the audience there he was crippled and brother branham sees him gets up and he walks out of the meeting and he as he walks out the meeting brother branham said that man sitting there a crippled man he said i watched a dark spirit come in and get him and take him out he said he will never be healed now you think you're that close to your deliverance right that close that you're there in the very presence of god and you allow an evil spirit to come in and distract you pull you away put some darkness upon you now it's really important that we even for every service that we put everything we got into it and that we we come here with sincerity and with dedication and consecration because you know just just one thing one thing could cause somebody from to not get their deliverance just one wrong attitude so it's really important that we come with the right attitude amen and in the spirit under the anointing now brother bradham said you'll never be able to see men going around the world just healing people at random and everything i tried to knock that down as hard as i could in my life that's the reason you're watching the campaigns i watch solemnly first to see the vision what god will say and then you for you might stomp and kick and anoint and everything else and if the devil has a right in there anything in your heart unconfessed or any unbelief or doubting anything in there anything that you refuse to do or not the devil will lay right there because he has a right to he said that's right jesus never healed it random he said i'd do nothing except the father shows me first and you'll never be on the plane with jesus as he says now so if you just if you look at this just for a moment i want you to get this that this is important to understand will never do will never heal at random we'll never just go out and and do things on our on our own with our own ambition it'll only be as the impulse or the leadership of the holy ghost and realizing that even even there we we have a commission now we can do the commission the commission is lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the commission is in my name cast out devils amen those are the commissions when we have the right as a commission but satan also knows his rights and as long as there's unconfessed sin some doubt in the heart some unbelief that will not be let go up remember remember many times people worship of spirit do you know there are some people just love to be sick they do they love the attention that it brings and i have this and i have that and you know and they glorify all of this they they enjoy it they enjoy the attention that it brings it's the truth do you realize do you realize brother branham when he dealt with that maniac and they and he fell at his feet there in portland oregon you remember there as he lay at his feet and and the policeman ran up and asked is he delivered and he said no well he had fallen out it was rendered powerless but he wasn't delivered he said no he's not delivered said he worships that spirit and only until he quit worshiping that spirit you see that's the thing you've got to hate sin and mind you you can't just you know play with it and say you know and it's your little toy that you play with you've got to hate it you've got to come to the point i don't want nothing to do with it hey man i'm sick of it i'm tired of it i'm weary of it and it'll not rule my life again i'm going to be free from this i'll not serve it another day because until you get dead earnest there will never be deliverance for you amen now this is really really important because people's deliverance can be so far away from them because of their lack of sincerity they won't believe from the heart oh in their mind oh yeah i i i know it's hurting my kids i know it's hurting my family i know it's it's living a miserable life but until you hate it until you come to the point i don't want no more to do with this this will no longer be my king here comes the question back where is he king i'm looking at men and women today that he's your king amen he is your king he has he has dominion over your life you are his servants you belong to him amen you're even a prisoner of love to him you're bound with him by love change you wouldn't hurt him for nothing you don't want to do wrong anymore the desires have been changed am i why because you come to that point you believe from the heart now again in as you know let me let me just talk about expectations yes we we are a people of tremendous expectations we're not looking to see the bride become weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker as we go along and leave out of here a powerless group of people no we're looking at a people who will be triumphant overcomers a people who know their god and does exploits a people where the spirit of god moves and there is deliverance and salvation and healing amen that's exactly what our expectations are amount of people who instead of getting less having less faith than people of great faith great grace a rapture and grace and a rapture in faith that's our expectations and even brother branham was talking to a man you know as he and this is a part of this quote that i just read from inspiration where jesus never healed at random and he said a man come to me a minister um who does from a denomination who doesn't believe in miracles and i'm just paraphrasing all of this he doesn't even believe in the baptism of the holy spirit he said listen preacher if you're an apostle of your prophet he said hey i'm neither one i'm a servant of jesus christ if you're a healer he said i'm not the healer i never did say that the lord is a healer and he says but if you were apostles like they were only he said just say by his grace well then he said um then if you're like one of the apostles who had the holy ghost you claimed out the holy ghost yes i do he said okay he said now you're talking that i have the holy ghost just like they had and he said well why don't you go to the hospital and every one of the sick people every one of them just say i will obey you and get up and walk out so you just say to them get up and walk out and they will obey you and he says okay but do you believe jesus still saves and he said well yeah i do he said well go to the honky tonks to the bar rooms to the racetracks and say every one of you are now christians you know come out and get away from the world he said i could do that if they would believe and he said so could i because it's on the atonement amen but jesus never brought deliverance when he didn't find faith and this is what he's looking for somebody to believe amen if he can get you to believe from your heart the mountain's got to move now watch this he said um he he he went on to say um about about that and he said um he said well you know he said well why why can't we do it he said you know paul he left a friend sick he left timothy with his stomach trouble they were doing the best they could do with what they had to do with jesus had the spirit without measure and we got it by measure so he said how could you condemn a man and said you know i talk about some failures so why don't we talk about success if you're a christian of course he said his heart was far away from god by theological experience that he had and and so all his faith was mental faith and so he he said um well he said i heard you saying one of your sermons jesus said the things i do say you do also said you know let's see you break bread then and feed five thousand let me see you turn water in the wine and brother bradley said and i want you to watch these words we are in our infancy we are moving up and just as quick as we can get you bunch of fanatics out of the way we'll be doing that he said now healing's not questioning anymore even the doctors recognize it but he said if we can get a bunch of unbelievers out of the way long enough to get god moving to the crowd you'll see things happen take place we are just moving up look at the miracles that jesus started the same way and then he moved right on finally to the resurrection of the dead listen we're looking for a crescendo of this thing the dead in christ arise not just from our ages but for seven ages amen this is exactly right you know jesus jesus there would experience healings deliverance and then he you know would have resurrections with his son at name jairus's daughter and then then a incredible miracle of lazarus who was dead for days amen it caused such a stir they even want to kill lazarus and man jealousy overtook them the word they wanted to kill lazarus because his testimony was was winning so many of a man four days dead alive again but that was nothing in comparison to the resurrected of all the sainted dead at his resurrection amen or when he rose from the dead on the third day come on that's exactly right so you see there there again we're looking for greater climaxes all the time and expecting greater things but to do it remember it's going to take up more sincerity than ever before and people believe in from their heart see jesus said to us say to this mountain you've heard about what's been taking place that's a ministry we're entering into and truly you know brother branham said you know you know this man was saying you know take some bread and break it and feed five thousand you do the works jesus did and jesus said greater than thee shall you do and what happened squirrels were created out of nothing is that right amen it was showing now what could be done to through a man yielded to god not that everybody's going to go out and create squirrels but that there is what a man surrendered to the will of god everybody don't need to move that mountain over in jerusalem amen everybody doesn't need to create a squirrel but there are things that needs to be done power of creation that needs to work in your home life in your own life is that right amen and it must be done listen again i believe that god has has given us a great time you know where we've had a great time of of of learning to lean on him making surrender sin god purging a lot of the faults out all of the all of the super spiritual i spoke in tongues i shouted i'd dance and god's allowed a lot of these things of superficial prophecies and you know ye saith the lord i bless you and all these things just kind of fade out of the way where that until people become so full of the word knowing their god so they could do exploits and be a prisoner of jesus christ are you with me amen so god has allowed us time to sit back and grow and we've learned the great deep mysteries of the word i mean we we have been given the revelation of of things that are happening in our day we've trailed the serpent all the way from the beginning all the way down to the end we we see the the great um moving of the holy spirit as as the seven seals were open and the mysterious thunders were revealed to a messenger of god all of these things that god has done to place us in the word we can be sane solid christians amen but now you know i think we have learned to be like paul a prisoner of jesus christ but now it is time to move into the authority and the power that god gave us as believers to know how to yield to the spirit to be led by the holy ghost you know in blind bartimaeus brother branham would re-emphasize some of these things he said no man at any time in the bible or ever will in any age to come while we're mortal of course when we leave this we won't need it but no man at any time from adam to the present day or will be until jesus comes again will ever be able to perform miracles at his own disposal he never did even the son of god or no prophet it was always by divine vision that god showed him what to do the bible said so so if jesus could do nothing himself but had to wait to see what the father would show him to do so you know we get the wrong picture of jesus even jesus we get the wrong picture of him saying well brother timmy was god in the flesh and yes he was and he was the fullness of the godhead bodily not a portion is that right but let me just read these little snippets jesus didn't just go around at random and do this and that and do this you got the wrong conception of him it wasn't given to him just to take the blessings of god and throw them out any way he wished to there's never been a man even to the son of man the son of god who could ever say within himself he did anything outside of god and man in john 5 and verse 17 you see jesus answered him my father worketh hitherto and i work you see jesus worked as the father worked he explains this you know again in john 5 19 he said then jesus said unto them verily verily i say to you the son of man can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever he doeth these also do it the son likewise so even jesus said you know it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me that's john 14 10 believe it's not that i'm in the father the father in me that the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father dwelleth in me he doeth the works again no prophet no seer ever done anything at random god shows first so no human flesh not even the flesh of jesus himself can glorify it's all in god god does the showing the seeing we just act it out as he shows us and tells us each one of us does that again in uh when their eyes is open you bible scholars you have been looking for a superman to come that does things just at random he will go out and whatever he wants to do he does it that never was in the bible and it will never be done by mortal beings in the will of god if jesus christ no man ever lived a life above his no prophet any time ever do anything without first god telling to do it first search the scriptures and see if that's all right it's always it's not the will of man it's the will of god being shown to man and you pentecostal brothers he said in the message look let me drop this to you you're looking for a time to come when there's going to be men rise up on the earth go out in the hospitals and deliver them and say the whole hospital move out don't you never be deceived like that you believe me if you believe that's a lie it never was done amen now jesus made it clear that without him we can do nothing that's john 15 5 i'm divine you're the branches he that abideth in me i and him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing so now we understand real clearly that anything that we're going to do has got to be dependent on him therefore there must be a sincere continual contact with the working of the holy spirit are you with me now notice what he says you know we we don't look for a superman but i want to tell you we do look for a super church one led by the holy ghost heaven thus saith the lord or keep still amen you're waiting to see what does god want done with this you're moved by the holy ghost and it takes that someone that is relying upon god not just a haphazard affair but a life that is living in contact with the holy spirit this is what i'm talking about when i'm saying there's a call for a greater sincerity a greater dedication where that men and women are in contact with the almighty where they can be moved on by the holy ghost now the third pull it will not be people just speaking at a whim you know none of the times that that happened with brother branham when you when you talk about the squirrels the storm the hatty right when you talk about the tumor of his wife um you know the resurrection of the little fish the five times that it was manifest none of those times did he say i think i'll walk out here and create a squirrel today i i think i'm you know i i want to hunt here a little longer i'll speak to this storm um you know i want to see these kids saved here so i'll just you know just pronounce something over them none of it every time it was god saying it was god putting words in his mouth but now it took his faith to put into action he said you know it was my faith that created those squirrels but he said it was it was my faith in what he challenged me to ask oh that there be a people today so in tune with him amen that they know what he wants done with his word that they're moving in the spirit they're directed by the holy ghost i had a great friend um you know that i knew for many many years he's he's gone on to be with the lord now his name was winston eason and when he was 19 years old he dove into a bar pit over here in louisiana near near louisiana tech hit something on the bottom snapped his neck he was a quad quadriplegic the rest of his life he had a great testimony of how god brought him to christ he was agnostic or an atheist you know he was one of these he was one of these smart young men he was raised by church of christ grandma his mom and dad had split up and and he he was so bitter on the inside he come to a point he said i don't even believe in god god is around with a bunch of college kids you know and they were the the the smart ones and listening to all the professors and whatever talked them out of being there even being a god i don't even believe in a god i i never seen god religion is just a hoax he he would see the church of christ preachers and the way that they would act and do and things and living immorally in sin and he lost faith altogether one day a man witnessed to him and and tried to get him to come to a meeting another young teenager and he said uh no he said i don't even believe in god he said aren't you afraid to say that he said no i'm not afraid to say that at all and there that there that night when he laid down on on to go to sleep there something just began to prick his conscience and he said oh if there is a god somehow show me yourself and he went on to sleep and a couple of days later he's a quadriplegic and there's a whole story of where god moved on that man visited him in in dreams with the angels showed him how to be baptized in the name of jesus christ it was the first time that i ever ever ever um heard the man's name a phone call he'd come into our home when we was living in bossier this is about 1962 and and there you know this young man was seeking to be baptized in the name of jesus christ i'm looking for people to baptize me in the name of jesus christ because i had an angelic visitation that as i was baptizing somebody you know and there i was baptized in the name of father son the holy ghost and an angel stood there in a white robe and said no you're doing it wrong baptize them in the name of the lord jesus christ and he obeyed the angel when he did the glory of god filled the place anyway god would lead this young man and and for whatever reason and i don't know i don't know the reason sometimes you know you want to help suffering humanity sometimes you want to you see something and you want to put your hands on you you'd like to help in that situation you'd like to see that person well and healed and walking but maybe it might be the very thing that is needed to be the chain upon his life to keep him walking and humble with god amen i've seen sister rachel's not her head there that was her grandfather their um brother carl williams full gospel businessman he was there crippled up with arthritis his hands all crippled up and his legs has crippled and he was went to prayer line and and you know a bit barely able to walk and was freed dare to walk with great strides but his hands were still crippled he went to brother branham and said to brother branham said brother branham but my hands my hands you know god did a great miracle here but my hands he said carl if god healed your hands said you'd be out there with the oil with the water wells and working out there instead of doing what he wants you to do sometimes you don't know why that we sometimes go through what we got we we'll understand it all better by and by but anyway winston you know he wanted very much to be healed he would dream of being healed he'd be dream he would dream of walking down the road and he's healed in fact of the matter is well you know he was pondering about um about uh brother branham being elijah the prophet and was wondering was he truly that elijah people were talking about he's that elijah and he saw himself walking right down on highway 7. now you don't know where highway 7 is anymore but 371 took its place as a as took louisiana highway 7 down and took its place and widened the road out and straightened it out made it a hurricane corridor made a united states highway and somewhere right about here where the church is built he was walking in his dream and an angel come down and started walking with him and looked over at him and gave him a message and said yes william branham is that messenger of malachi 4. just think about that and we built a church right here on that highway 7 right here where the angel visited now speaking of that you know he was there in tampa florida following brother branham around from meeting to meeting and desiring to be healed and and he got to go to the full gospel businessmen's meeting and was sat at the breakfast and got to sit across from brother branham there at the table and they wheeled him up there across from brother branham and brother branham and him talked there for a little bit and and he began to speak to him and brother branham took him by his left hand just to see if there was a a germ disease or something that was there as he was talking to him and and held his hand as he looked at him and he said brother branham i've heard about the squirrels you'll find this on on the message of paradox it's not exactly the way i'm going to tell it this morning because i'm telling winston's side of it and and and he said i've heard about the squirrels and hattie wright and the third pull and i believe those things and he says brother branham if you'll just tell me that i can walk out of here that's all i want you to do just speak the word and i'll get up here and walk out and he said brother brandon said i thought how lovely you see he said i think that's where brethren gets off track god let them do something with a little faith and then they feel like everything they bounce into they just say it and that's all but you see how can i say dust saith the lord unless he tells me first i've got to have it first if it didn't i'd say that's saith william branham but that wouldn't do any good you see he's got to tell me first said a man drove up in an ambulance with some babies and i was real busy and he said um you know the the ambulance driver said just tell me that the babies would be all right and and i thought well how lovely but how can i say that until i know it he said some people just got an impression the lord told me to do this impressions that's where there's that's where a lot of things has had to die out where we're just going on impressions human compassion even human desires but to be led of the holy spirit amen and he says well he said well that's just yourself many times you've got to see it and know it he said then he turned to a minister brother and said how can i say brother fox say he'll say something you know how could he say or say something if he's honest and brother branham said so and so and if i didn't say it he's falsely accusing me of saying something i didn't say but if i really said it then i've got to stand behind it so when the lord says anything that does it so if you look what he's saying if if you're saying this dust says the lord and god didn't say it you're lying on god and that's what we've seen many things in the past and that's why god has allowed us to become prisoners of jesus christ to learn we don't say something unless he says it amen that's why that we must ask in his name because we are praying instead we're allowing the holy ghost to speak through us he said brother tim that's a tall order it's not too tall amen this is exactly what we're called to do in this hour going beyond the camp he would explain it this way he said knowing you're my responsibility and on my hands with the gospel i want to keep you right in the pages of this bible many times people come to me and say brother bradley if you just step out of here and say thus saith the lord to my child it's sick it'll be well and go out of here just say it'll get well that's all i want you to do he said now that's loyal and lovely and no doubt the person believes they're having faith but he says i can't do it until he tells me first i can pray for the child see that's what we're convinced to do lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen i can pray for the child to do all again but you see if i went out here under enthusiasm and said that if i said thus saith the lord it would really just be the same my enthusiasm and it does it might happen it might it might not happen and what if that same person under my enthusiasm and it didn't happen and then that person might be in a case sometimes between life and death where would their confidence be they would be afraid i was under enthusiasm again so when i say it i want to be dead earnest that it's right with all i know when he speaks to me i can just say what he showed me whether it's good or whether it's bad i have to say it if it's not pleasant to tell people the evil things that have befalled them as as i am my duty bound to tell them the good things that will follow them and after all we want the will of the lord sometimes the will of the lord is contrary to our desires but still if we want the will the lord is just as precious to know that the evil will befall us if it's the will of the lord whether it be good or evil if it's the will of the lord that we want it done and we want to look at it in that manner god whatever we want your own will this is where jesus came to he had a will and the father had a will now brother branham would say that jesus he wanted he maybe he wanted to have a family had natural desires to get married he had you know he had all of these human desires like human half but he would come to gethsemane and look at even at listen he would even look at the suffering that he would have to do and said lord if it be thy will let this cup pass from me he would even pray not to have to go through that but then he would surrender that wheel because without it we were the whole human race would be lost unless there was a man willing and he had to come to the point that he was willing and this is what it has to take with you you have to come to that point that you to your own gethsemane whether you are willing whatever god you want whatever you desire that's what i want in my life i surrender to it i yield to it i want it you see again this is very important because not only if paul learned to be a prisoner of jesus christ he learned to be a servant of jesus christ it meant not to speak anything until god told him to speak it now you know this is this is really something because you have peter and james and peter and john walk out to the gate called beautiful and it just looks spontaneous silver and gold that by none such as i have give out to thee you know they're they're working on a commission they're moving and as on a commission that god had committed them and then you have paul at the same time would be maybe a later date later time that paul would come along and and there would be a fortune teller begin to follow him and scream after him every day you know actually these are men of god they come to tell you the way of life and there was a fortune teller and it looked like the devil was given vindication to a servant of god and paul was vexed in his spirit but even though he's vexed he won't do nothing about it until god gives him the impulsive permission and then he turns to her in that time and commands that evil spirit to come out of here but he went for weeks with this happening because why he had learned to obey god he had to learn to wait on the holy spirit to move directed by the holy ghost now that's a again he was a servant of jesus christ and and he could not speak anything until god told him to speak it and then it took his faith to put into action what god told him to do there would be another that would be out there another young man that would be out there and and paul would look upon him and and he would discern that he had faith to be healed and would tell him to rise up and walk what was it he looked and he found that faith he found somebody believing from the heart now there again we must believe what the blood has made us we must believe we are the blood wash blood-bought sons and daughters of the living god amen amen we have been washed from our sins amen that the sins we used to do we do them no more that we're free and because of that the chasm is even gone amen that we have a right and access to the throne of grace but you must approach that throne of grace by faith nothing else will assail you into that throne of grace you must believe from the heart you see there's a lot of hypocrisy jesus would deal with this he said well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites it's written these people they honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me they're saying one thing with their mouth but their heart and it doesn't do any good to speak to a mountain with your mouth if in your heart you're not believing it you've got to be convinced amen now you see it's whatever god can lead your soul to believe that's why it's so important to be led by the spirit that's why i'm talking about brother brad i'm even talking about binding the serpent it's going to require greater sincerity amen what is a greater dedication there a purging of your own soul so that you can come into the presence of god that the hindrances are gone amen i never present from the water from the rock he said it this way when we die our souls will go under the altar god whereas privileged see a few moments ago mornings ago you know in division where the bible speaks of our spirits will go to god who give it our bodies shall return to the dust of the earth but someday when where the scripture is fulfilled our spirits will be released from god we'll pick up the soul the soul to the body and the power that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in heavenly places we are right now in the power of the resurrection somebody with me he said if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of god would go out and create a world out there and go live a private life on it that's how much power lays within you with the baptism of the holy ghost you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of god in you you've got the power to do it god is omnipotent see what i mean that's the power and you will you can speak a world in existence and go and live on it hallelujah there you are that's the power that's in the church now but it's controlled by law amen now you you know you know what i'm talking about there are laws that you have to work by you could go out here there's a pond right down the road you could scream all you wanted to walk out here and scream all of you water from that pond come here water the lawn it won't do it but if you work according to the law of gravitation you can dig a trench and funnel that if you get the gravity and get the the elevation right you can bring it right into the yard and water the yard by working according to a law god's word works according to law and that law is a word of faith it's a law of faith jesus said all things are possible what to them that believe all things this is why he could look at this mountain and say it's possible to move this mountain because if god can lead your soul to it if you're not doubting your heart you will have whatsoever things you said are you with me now again again this is what it requires it requires finding that will of god that's what the power is in the church now but it's controlled by law and that law is not keeping a bunch of commandments it's a law of faith jesus said all things are possible than them that believe and if you can believe it well listen now whatever god will lead your soul to believe that's yours every place the souls of your foot can set up on by faith god gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it amen if you're a son of god if you're a daughter of god that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there in other words the power lays within the church amen but the key to assess it the faith that is needed gets away from it this is why he's preaching ever-present water from the rock it was always there when they were in their dry places it was there when they were in their hard times it was there come on when trouble was all around it was there the rock followed them and that rock was christ amen it was always within speaking distance think about that this morning our rock is always within speaking distance you don't have to strike it amen you don't have to take him back to calgary and him be wounded again for your transgressions amen but again let me tell you all you have to do is speak to the rock and the rock is nearby it's right there but it's just waiting for somebody with faith to speak to that rock you speak to it and that will come life-giving water now so again your faith gets away from it it's always there that healing that healing power that was in in in the meetings when you when you know that blind eyes was open you hear deaf and dumb talk and you hear the or you hear the cripples walking all the that power still lays in the church it's never left us but our faith gets away from it amen he said when you're saved god gives your faith your faith to rise above the muck of the earth your faith overcomes the things of the world this is what the bible said this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith is that right so what is your faith your faith is that act that god has done in you to make you a son of god amen you know your sins are gone you the faith comes i am born a son of god i am his responsibility therefore no longer will cigarettes have hold on me no longer an effeminate spirit or some evil spirit have hold on me i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i can walk right i can i can overcome this i can win this battle because i am a child of the most high god amen you're lying you're cheating you're stealing you quit drinking because your faith rises you above it amen if you don't do it you don't have any faith because by faith are you saved into grace as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have amen that's why brother branham would say don't just be satisfied with little things he said believe for big things he big things is just as easy to come as little things he says you know he said as much of your faith and be released that's how much power you can have because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth god dwells in you your sons and daughters of god there you are but it's your faith according to your faith be it unto you amen if falcons believe all things are possible if you say this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you said you see then what kind of people he said are we to be having faith in this redeeming christ that lives in us this smitten rock that never leaves the church i'm with you always to the end of the world that ever present of the great gutter of salvation and power that poured forth from calvary into the church the ever presence of this living god great flowing smitten rock that goes with us in our journey so so you see again it's our it's not that god don't do that it's that our faith gets away from it but where do we come back to that faith it comes back when we come back to sincerity and honesty amen when we come to god with all of our heart when we when we seek him with all our soul that's when faith comes in there to take that word and believe that word amen as brother braven said and the word became flesh he said and they are sons of god are led by the spirit of god then when the human element goes out and the spirit of god fills that vacancy where you empty yourself then when the will be that's when the church in its power the resurrection of the lord jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what i mean then your thoughts will become words and your words will become material that's when the church is in its power when is when the human element is pushed out i believe that it's on this road that when the church will be so wrapped in christ the holy spirit mankind's so far away from themselves till they won't see themselves they don't have any but to serve god and their um thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the life the law of christ and then when the love of christ is in the human heart moving in the holy ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the holy spirit bring in the past the thought of their mind amen now wasn't that exactly what happened there when the third pool worked for brother branham it was god gave him the thoughts and he took those thoughts and they became words and those words became creative now you know if we can only get to the place where we pray like he told us to do ask anything in my name in other words be the mouthpiece of god where you're acting instead with him using your voice notice this he said in fundamental foundation of of faith he says jesus said whatever you ask the father my name that i will do do you know what that means do you realize if we go before god in the name of jesus it's just the same as jesus himself praying it isn't me praying anymore if i come in his name and he recognizes his name and jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that i will do and then i go to the father in jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's jesus it's a spirit praying through me now you see what it means to ask anything in his name because you're acting in his stead you found that will of god you found that vein of anointing and if you it's not just a carter blanket and you just go out here and at any whim just ask anything you want and i'll do it no but when you ask in my name now he said the son of god spent so much time in prayer and if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer now wait a minute you've got the holy ghost he's living on the inside of you you're born again but you got this outside man that's a human got a human spirit and he's got a human will and he's got human desires human things he wants done amen but oh if the human will get in fellowship with the holy spirit that's inside of him where he can be directed by the spirit instead of directed by human desires you see this is where it takes spending much time in prayer it takes that consecration and that dedicated walk amen to what to be in fellowship with the spirit that's on the inside of you where you're asking from the heart where you're asking from the holy spirit on this when is him using your lips when it's him using your voice come on your generation that saw that happen you saw a man stand there and god used his vocal cords you saw a man stand there and god move in that man's body use his vocal cord use his voice box and speak things that no man could know only god can know it was god using a man god wants to use you amen he wants to use you in whatever capacity he's called you to to move in it may be to say something your son say something to your daughter amen believing that you can go with token life the holy ghost on the inside of you and knowing your words are created when you're anointed by the holy ghost and talk to that son or talk to that daughter and see the whole atmosphere change and such a love of christ that they just fall right into it it can happen it is to happen that's the way that it happens you see you remember when you've got a part in this you see because he's not going to come down from heaven with his voice he's going to use you in your voice it'll be your voice winning the loss it'll be your voice he will use to heal the sick. come on amen remember you've got a part in this he would say he'd look out on the he's the lord of the harvest he'll look out on the harvest and he says it's white it's ready for harvest amen and he said the laborers are few but then he said pray you to the lord of the harvest that he'll send laborers into the harvest in other words pray to me you asked me to do what i want done on the earth amen you begin to call on me to send laborers look i want the work done amen there's laborers of you i can tell you laborers of you but it's going to take you to call on me because there's something you've got in this too you see he made you kings and priests and in doing so you have a dominion and a domain but you also are under him and you must know what he wants done with the word so he would say you've got a part in this you see we get the point we want god to do everything we just want it to happen spontaneous and there's no surrender and there's no dedication and there's no consecration and we're just walking life like you know like usual and the angels are trying to anoint you but the prince of persia is a is opposing him and you can see in the books that the coming of the lord is near amen that the death angel is about to ride in the land that is changing from the black to the pale and that the bride's got to get out of here and you can read in the books where the last messengers come and we're now in the we're now in overtime somebody help me preach that we're right here in the last days in the last of the last of the last days is somebody with me and we're right here on the very cusp on the brink of full redemption but it's going to take somebody that is agonizing with god to fulfill his word that keeps pressing through remember because as you press through so does the angel press you see as you press he presses as you back up he backs off so if you want the angel to get through to you for your unanswered prayer come on you got to keep pressing amen listen the bible said that that this requires force amen and that we must press our way into it it's an age you say brother tim a lot of pressure a lot of press but you've got to press amen i just want to ask you is the world filling your press is the satanic forces feeling your press you're pushing back you shove it back no you're not going to take my son no you're not taking my daughter no you're not going to cause a sickness to take this life no you're not going to do this i'm a son of god and we're pressing we're pressing we're going to find that wheel we're going to find that purpose we're going to hear from the angel we're going to be anointed to overthrow you the angel will come with the answer part of it lays in human beings the kingdom of god lays in the human being i'm the vine jesus said you're the branches the blind doesn't bear the fruit the branches bear the fruit it's time you become fruit barren god looked up there and looked at a fig tree jesus did and it had no fruit and then he cursed it he looks at the there is a vine he said anything that don't bear fruit is cut off and thrown into the fire amen god that doesn't like it when the church doesn't bear fruit amen god wants your hands god wants your eyes he wants your tongue he wants your lips he wants your ears he wants your hands he wants your feet in other words you're going to be the body that he walks through i mean he would say sacrifices and offerings i would was not but a body has not prepared me this is what he would say of jesus that jesus would be the body prepared i don't want just sacrifices and offerings and even when it comes down god don't want just empty worship he wants a body prepared he said there he said oh that you could could uh submit your body not to be conformed to the world but to be transformed by the renewing of your mind where you actually look at things the way god looks at them your mind renewed i don't know about you but i want to be the hands and feet of his spirit upon the earth amen now he said jesus spent much time in prayer one day he told his disciples cross over to the other side sent them away while he went to the mountain to pray while he was up there alone it was a storm came brother branham looked at that situation he said you know i believe if either been thy disciple said i know he told us to go over but i just believe i'll wait until he comes and goes along with us i ain't going without him amen this is where we get in trouble this is where the church has gotten trouble too many have gone off without him too many have claimed the message and never got him amen that's why we see all the fallen away and the things that are happening and and and the travesties in the church is because they went off without him amen but listen you know again if you start going off without him and we remember we can take him with us everywhere we go this is where he comes to abide he lives in us we don't go anywhere he don't go amen if he goes we're going amen like ruth said to uh said to naomi wherever you're lodged that's where i lodge wherever you dwell that's where i dwell your people will be my people your god will be my god she was determined she made up her mind that's the way it's got to be with believers i am determined ah if you go this way i'm going with you it's like a lasher on the trail of elijah when he wanted that double portion you see me when i go away you'll get it amen he went to gilgal oh why don't you go over here no i'm going with you you're going to you go over here to the school of the prophets no i'm going with you wherever you go i'd go i will not leave you i'm going to see you when you ascend because i want that double portion that's what it's got to be with believers i gotta have that dogged and it's about him i'm not leaving the word i'm not leaving the anointing i'm following that everywhere he goes that's where i'm going whatever he says that's what i say [Applause] amen because why because soon as the devil sees you out of fellowship with christ he'll sit right on for you amen when he sees you away from prayer away from consecration satan will catch you right there if you possibly can see what is it god wants to get a people his prisoner that's what he's been doing all of these years this has not been for nothing remember we've had this time for a purpose where that we can become a prisoner where you can't look at what somebody else's think you know you got to just do what he says do you're a prisoner is that right paul pressed in the spirit you know to to go in a place where he didn't uh or or was forbidden by the spirit you know one time he wanted to go a certain place and and he was forbidden by the spirit to go there he turns and goes into macedonia and follows the macedonian call what was it it was the leadership of the holy ghost not just going random where he wanted to but led by the spirit oh and he said oh if the church could be so is so in the glorious presence of god that someday god will turn loose his power into it things will take place but you can't mix your diet you'll become hybrid stay exactly with what god said stay with the word amen you hear brother branham saying and who do you say this is you show me a church who's ever moving action it's dust saved the lord and walking in that kind of glory i'll show you a messiah standing on the earth an anointed one of god amen now if thou canst believe all things are possible if that believeth from the heart notice there was a man who came to the disciples he had a need but somewhere there was some unbelief maybe you heard all of the about the fanaticism of jesus and his disciples all the miracles aren't really true they're not really right he brings them to his disciples and you know his disciples do every kind of things and they stomp and scream and yell and anoint and and my made a pretty big fool of themselves the devil wouldn't leave the boy you remember and he comes to jesus and i want you to notice he comes with that same doubt because he says i brought my my child to your disciples and they couldn't cure him and jesus laid it right on to him he said it's a lack of faith and he said to jesus if thou can do anything heal my son and jesus turns it around right back on him it's not if i can do it he said all things impossible if i can find faith if somebody believes if you believe it from your heart and the man knowing he had a belief he didn't he didn't fight it he didn't deny it he said but yet he began to make a different profession he said lord i believe help thou my unbelief in other words forgive me for disbelieving [Applause] and that's what we got to do when we look at the promise of god we got to look at it and say lord we we got all of these obstacles and yeah we're dealing with unbelief and more unbelief than ever in this age lord i i'm encumbered with unbelief and it floods in and doubt holds me back and keeps me lord but i believe forgive me of my unbelief and at that moment the man was healed his mountain was moved amen you see it's when the heart believes romans 6 17 but god be thinks that you were the servants of sin but you have obeyed how from the heart there be people sometimes obey for the sake of obedience or for the sake of fitting in this is what god requires this is what i got to do but when you obey from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you being that made free from sin you became servants of righteousness amen what when you believed from the heart am i not when you just believe that's mental oh yeah i believe that god can do that but no you know god will do it for me you believe from the heart that form a doctrine which was delivered to you being that made free from sin you became servants of righteousness romans 10 6 but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart what's now where it's at don't say in your heart who shall ascend to heaven that is to bring christ down from above or who shall ascend to the deep that is to bring him again from the dead but what saith what saith the heart what is it what does the what does the heart of righteousness say it says the word is nighting the word's right here it's even in the mouth and in the heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if i will confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe where in thine heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved amen for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made to salvation for the scripture said whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed you see you know where we are we're in a day where god's calling for greater faith this is the hour of rapture in faith faith for a god's demanding a greater faith and when we see things moving like they are doing it should anoint our faith and when we see things that are moving right into the vision right into the prophecy of god's word it should anoint our faith even more to believe from the heart amen you know you remember uh you remember brother branham's vision of seeing the silver tip grizzly bear and brother eddie bisco uh you know he didn't know who it was in the vision but a young man in a green checkered shirt and and he would see this bear right after he had killed a caribou with 42 inch horns by the way brother aaron was just recently might be able to share some of that maybe wednesday night but he was he was recently there in the den they just rescored that caribou again and and it was rescored on both sides both sides symmetrically the same 42 inches after all of these years the miracle continues are you with me amen and so he he would he would after killing this this caribou which you know was not common to the country and and also the silver tip had never been seen one in that area before by the guide and most of the caribou were panel horns and this was like spike horns and you know that that were coming up and and he saw him kill it and and then it would be measured it would be 42 inches when they got back to the camp where before they got back to camp that would be he would see a young man with a green checkered shirt and he would see their um uh then a silver tip grizzly and he would get so close to it and shoot it you know you remember the story of it and and as he's going up there and he sees there and he shoots the animal and he looks back and he sees down back uh behind him way back around on the backside big wide open area and he could see way down there a young man with a checkered shirt now this boy brother eddie biskell they'd already asked does anybody have that shirt they knew it was required you know some things has to be put in the right place and you can't put it there god has to put it there and you have to wait till things get exactly right in the right place i'm telling you we're now at a time where it's closer than ever are you with me things are coming right into place and so he looks over and he sees you know the the green shirt that eddie had denied having you remember the story it was a shirt that had a rip in it he and an older shirt and he didn't want to take it with me get me some new shirts and his wife got him new shirts and repaired that one and just stuck it down in for an extra and he'd fall into the water and he got that shirt and he put it on you know a dry shirt he's not even thinking and i'm telling you friends we're right here in the vision right now and we're walking it maybe you don't even realize that you've done been seen in that vision but here you are and you're walking right in it things are happening right around you and you're oblivious to it but god's not going to leave you out you're part of the vision are you with me amen he's not leaving listen he's not going to lose a one of his that's why the last call goes out in the highways and the byways and man and finds those that are halting blind and lame in every kind of horrible condition are you with me and he saves them and brings them in because he said they're going to sit at my table my table will be full i will have a bride she will be without spot or wrinkle he looks out there you know and bud looks at him and said well now there's a green checkered shirt but we can see for miles and i don't see no grizzly bear nowhere so there ain't never been one in this part of the country and why can luke and i can see from miles look you can see and they're packing these horns and and you know you don't realize to him but bud is talking trash you know and he's speaking his doubts and well i can't see nothing look here we can see from miles we don't see nothing it's not there and brother branham is undeterred he said but he said he said well where where is that bear he said that's not for me to question god said so and he's jehovah jireh he can bring a bear he could put one there and he did they had looked all over that field and hadn't seen one and all of a sudden he said what is that there he said my goodness that's somebody's milk cow so that's as big as a milk cow standing there it was that grizzly bear you know right there god had he had brought it into existence are you with me amen why because again it was not for him to question and it's not for us to question either god said i'll have a bride she'll be without spot or wrinkle i don't know how he'll do it but he'll if he has to hair left every devil in hell he will do what he needs to do to get that bride into position amen because his word never fails amen if he said somebody's going to believe from the heart then let me be one that believes it from the heart if there's somebody going to have faith in this power let me be one that has faith in himself if somebody is going to use the vocal cords let him use my vocal cords here i am lord [Applause] hallelujah it should anoint us when we see the days and the time that we're living in when we see the signs that jesus said would take place amen that spoke up in the
