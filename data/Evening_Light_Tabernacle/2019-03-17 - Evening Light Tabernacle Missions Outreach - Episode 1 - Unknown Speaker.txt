[Music] located in North Louisiana evening light Tabernacle has always held forth the scripture that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever today we invite you to delve into the scripture with us as the ministry discusses God's truth in our day hello everyone we are the ministry team at evening light tabernacle and we are happy that you have joined with us for this discussion today pastor friend of mine Reverend Henry Greene once said God started the church the way that he wanted it and now he was to church the way that he started it and that is gonna be our topic this evening as we just share with one another things that are really dear to our heart one thing I would like to pose the question to you brothers that are here today really what is it that defines the church there are 41,000 denominations each with their various doctrines they have their own beliefs their standards and their views can all of these be right what do you think certainly not the Bible I speaks of one church and the Bible would have to set the pattern of what church that is in there I mean I feel like there has to be an absolute you know something that you can judge by because we can't rightly judge we're going to nomination or one thought by another thought of what man's thought about another man's thought we had to have something that sets the pattern you know I don't think that's what the Word of God he is is the pattern yes so Jesus Christ would be that absolute and his word right his work yeah absolutely which you know absolute it's a it means perfect it's a positive it's unquestionable and there's only one thing that's unquestionable unless his word yes sir he said he was an earth to pass away with my word and never failed as we pondered the word church though we must go back to what does that word truly mean the word church means to call it out so we see that Jesus set the pattern calling those out of of what but was he calling them out of and what was he calling them into I mean when we think about the churches why don't we have 41,000 churches is it Jesus calling men out of 41,000 churches who set their own what they would be denominational background or is it man's making in that regard and what happens is when men start interpreting the word to themselves that I'll never interpret exactly the way you interpret it and you'll never interpret it exactly the way I interpret it so what happens is is men begin to interpret things and you end up with this idea which becomes a church and then this idea which becomes a church and you end up with 41,000 different ones because they're not going back to the absolute exact Timothy spoke that but there must be a church there has nothing it's because Jesus said he would return for a church without spot wrinkle or blemish exactly so then how do we know what is the true representation of Christianity what would define that because there must be a truth yes I think we have a pattern lays before us mr. Word of God we'd go back to the word to find the pattern for what the church should be so we'd go back to the original gospel we'll go back to the original gospel all right so then the question comes today is is with 41,000 not churches denominations yes 41,000 different denominations each one of these are saying I am the way are we are the way and yet there has to be but one way and I've just got to believe it's God's God of people and that's still longing in their hearts to see God yes if they want to see the reality to Christ yes there was a question that was asked Jesus they said in I believe it's Matthew 19 they were asking him a question on marriage and divorce could a man put away his wife for any calls and Jesus said that Moses gave them the writing of divorcement because of the hardening of the hearts but the beginning from the beginning it wasn't was also from them so Jesus in order to answer the question of that day or to correct the error of that day he went back to the beginning and the reason for this is because God is perfect in every decision he makes his perfect everything God does is perfect so if we can go back to the beginning which Jesus went back to Genesis to answer the question of that day and to correct the error of that day then we could go back to the original church that's defined in the scriptures and we could see the pattern it would correct the air and it would tell us how to worship God in spirit and in truth so then it would be a book of Acts Church yes sir so then Jesus had spoke through Paul actually that said that he would sanctify and cleanse a church by the washing of the water by the word as it says in the book of Ephesians so that he could present himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish do you think in this damn time that God possibly could have a church that would be without spot or wrinkle or blemish is he truly coming for something like that or is he just taking everybody to heaven the Bible can't be wrong exactly I mean he's returning for one church you know I think that's the idea you find though is that he's returning to take everyone to heaven and then that's where you find in this day what the term we may refer to as easy believe ISM that just just shake hands with the minister and just put your name on the book and you're okay you're gonna go to heaven but if we really will look at that in the scripture and look at the mirror of God's Word that's not so it can't be said well what it is is man taking God's Word to fit his idea versus taking God's Word and fit their self to that to match the word for making the word match how they want it to so it becomes easy believe ISM you can do this or you can do that and you find it once that happens you deviate off the pattern yes you deviate off the word which we know the word is it absolute because God doesn't change so if people explains the word or gives us a word then God can't deviate off his word he's he's infinite we're fine like we change we can change our ideas or views but God can't so then God puts it on paper and then that paper becomes in the heart of man there's gonna be somebody to match it yes yeah I mean I I see looking in the book of Acts we find the church with power in it exactly you know not a not a church that we're living and there's the you know we continue a Peter that would continue denying Christ but once the Holy Ghost came and I think that's where churches are today you know they think the Holy Ghost apparently is powerless but we've witnessed you know the Holy Ghost in power that's right just a moment that a change of life that you don't have to live and seeing no more you don't have to live it he didn't come to save you in your sins you come to save you from your dead back and then in acts 4 it says that it says they did testify of Jesus with great power great so not just word only yeah that's for 33 said it was with great power that they testified of Jesus so that power if it was there in the beginning in the book of Acts it must be once again if it's the true church yeah well say Paul was say in the Salone ins he said our gospel came not unto you in word only so you know we have churches with teachings doctrines philosophies you know good thoughts but Paul said but it didn't come in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance so then if we're going to have a book of Acts church then we would have a Holy Ghost Church yes we would have one of course had the word but not word only but it would be also in power and with much assurance this is like Paula would also say in the book of Hebrews chapter 2 he said how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation so we've got a responsibility to us search out the three salvation and and to find that because he said which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness and I think this is key that if a church is a true church that God will bear them witness yes and how he bore them witness was both with signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will amen I think you you know you said it exactly right you found one of the first notable miracles that was done in the church and that was in acts 3 in verse 1 to the lame beggar game you know here he comes Peter and John coming to him and silver and gold have I none but such as I have a part two yes so it's not man's ability that's the power of the Holy Ghost doesn't make a lame man then also shows though there's a power within the church that they have something to give exactly that's correct and that the emphasis is not on silver in gold but on the power that we have to give that would make a crippled man walk or make a blind man see or make a deaf men hear or make a sinner become a child of God exactly heard it said that you know money is not gonna convert the world it's gonna be the power of the Holy Ghost it's gonna freakin the conversion so we find it here in acts 3 silver and gold money is not gonna do the job but it's men whose hard for a flame that have something to hallelujah expression they've seen it because it's not only impacted their life and changed yeah but now it's an outflow it's like you fire shut up in our bones today they say it just it has to release and share it with somebody else and then it catches fire and that person gets delivered or healed or whatever it may be you know I believe that miracles and signs and wonders are gonna follow the true church yeah so salvation is actually healing on the soul round or even the spirit realm but healing is on the physical realm but it's all of what Christ is yes something that that is just marvelous to me is one of the last things that Jesus said one of his party words he says a mark 16 and he uses the word shall with it and shall is a strong assertion he asserts these signs shall follow them that believe seven times seven times with emphasis he says this these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so if we're gonna be a true church then it looks like we would be a people who practice not just preached or talked about the goodness of God give you a good feeling or whatever but more than that that we we assert the same things that Jesus said that we would do these signs shall follow them that believe you instantly see that coming to pass in the book of Acts yeah right there in acts 5 it speaks of them laying people in the street so that Peters shadow may pass over and then it says they were brought all their sick and afflicted and those with with tormenting spirits and it says and all of them were healed every every last one of them so speaking what you said it's kind of a face the mirror moment if you're if you're in a church and you're not seeing these things and yet the scripture is very plain if you believe these signs shall follow that that's not something that's up for debate so so wherein is the issue well I think the issue lays in second Timothy 3:16 when the Bible says that all Scripture is given by inspiration are the anointing of the Holy Ghost or under loaning of God and it's probably profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction and for instruction and righteousness that all may be may be it may be made perfect so we see that you've got to come back to either God's Word as the absolutist of truth it's inspired or it's not inspired if it's not inspired you need to get away from it but if it's inspired then these things are gonna take place that's right well you know it seems to me that the gospel has turned more into an entertainment and this is more of what it's about that they've turned it into a gospel in other words the good news is is we're gonna have fun with dancing and rock n roll and and popcorn in our favorite movie you know and that's the good news the good news is there's a living Christ a man and he's a resurrected Christ and Jesus said that the gospel of this kingdom must be preached and that word also means to be demonstrated into all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come so if we're here at the end time which I believe we are then then the gospel must be preached and demonstrated and as Paul said he didn't come and word only but it came with power and with much assurance and in the Holy Ghost so this is very important you know um today mission work is done and what we are calling doing mission work is now educating teaching them skills human taryn efforts such as Hospital clinics teaching the hygiene and you know teaching them how to grow food or whatever and all of those things are good but really is that the gospel being preached I think it goes back again back to that beggar here's a man born in this situation no strength to stand on his own and you know the disciples that came there they knew that what they their silver and gold was not gonna make the difference this man needed in his exactly you know and really the humanitarian efforts and the education all that has his place but that's not the difference that where Jesus was speaking about go you in the world and preach the gospel and the difference was there was a power that could raise that man up off his afflicted condition exactly and give him strength to stand and strength to overcome and strength to provide and strength and that's what this were to do this war don't leave you in that broken-down condition he's not here to offer you money or off your silver and go no a power to raise you up out of that place and to make you able to stand and stand in the face of that and you noticed that blind beggar sin is immediately after he was made well he went into the temple walking and leaping and praising God he had a reason to rejoice he just felt that power yeah here has changed his life I feel the church has moved off of the foundation of the power of God and have substituted the power of God for program for organization for entertainment right but but the same power that raised a man that was born lame that's the same power it takes to to take a drunkard off the street and make him a preacher of the gospel it takes the power of God to change the appetite of a man to take an ungodly man and make him holy and to make him thirst and for the kingdom of God and become a child of God and I fear that that we have left the foundation as the Church of the Living God as a whole that men have left the foundation of the power of God and many times it's even said that the the power of God was for the apostles that it it wasn't for this day or healing was for another day and it's an argument that's very prevalent and in the day that we live but that ain't what the scripture says right no says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen amen if he healed then he heals now if he saved then he saves now I mean he's same in every detail you know and so I believe the church if they want to be a powerful Church they got to go back to what was that the beginning I don't believe that perhaps perhaps we should maybe delve into the scripture and go back to the foundation and pull from the scriptures what exactly was the first church and define it by the word well you know Amos 8:11 said that the days come saith the Lord God that I would send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but for hearing the words of the Lord and they so wonder from sea to sea and from North even to the east and they shall run to and fro to seek the Lord the Lord and shall not find it so a it tells you that the end time is going to be a time where there is gonna be a lot of deception a lot of confusion like I said instead of one way that we started out with where Jesus said I am the way the way the truth and the life and there was one way that now we have 41,000 different ways and all of these are claiming to be the way to God but surely there has to be one and I can see I believe there's a hunger in the hearts of people today to know the Living God and so the next time we come back we're going to be talking more about this church that Jesus Christ claims as his own because I believe all else's thoughts it has to be there has to be one West and and that one way is Jesus amen and the church that he is called for the last day amen amen thank you for joining with the minutes at evening light Tabernacle for
