together to worship Him and and to give him glory and praise amen always enjoy the oh enjoy every time we've able to come to the house of the Lord but the midweek service is just a wonderful time to be able to let off a little pressure and because he tends to build up and and so we're here to do that Luke 9 and verse 57 said it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him Lord I will follow thee whether soever thou goest and Jesus said unto him foxes have holes birds of the air have Nest but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and he said to another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my Father and Jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preached the kingdom of God and another also said Lord I'll follow thee but let me go first let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house and Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God Amen we'll let you be seated I've been thinking on these thoughts of this thought of Faith to go with him been thinking on it a while and then brother Tim would actually preach Sunday on Elisha following after Elijah and not turning back and I was going to decided I thought maybe go another way and I got up this morning a little bible app would have the some of these very same words about following Jesus take up your cross the scripture of take up your cross and follow him so I thought well I better follow him so we're here following him but you know I I I was thinking on this word follow me and and I thought it was interesting that they were as they went in the way a certain man said Lord I will follow thee and and and you know and then they begin to give up all the give all the excuses why they couldn't and I and I thought about the disciples and how God's call upon their life and you know was very very simple he just walked up to them and said follow me it wasn't a bunch of big words it was two two words that he would use follow me and and to think of what it took or what would happen in their lives to where they would absolutely drop all they were doing and and move on and follow him and and they they would leave everything behind they left families they left homes they they left work they left mothers and fathers they left it all to follow after him and and you know there's a man we'll get into about the Rich Young Ruler but but right after I want to kind of jump ahead before I get there but but right after he had told that Rich Young Ruler you know to go and sell all I have and give unto the poor and he wouldn't do it because he was exceedingly rich and Jesus would say to his disciples he would say verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again I say to you it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven and and I've kind of wondered and thought about that a lot and course there's a lot of ideas but you know Jesus point was that the it was the humility of simple faith that was required to enter into the kingdom of God it wasn't riches it wasn't anything we could do or what we have done that's going to get us there but our faith in him and following after him you know uh rich people let me let me let you understand something you can be rich in a lot of things I'm not just necessarily talking about money you can be rich in Pride you can be rich in arrogance you can be rich in all kinds of things and if you're not willing to lay all of that aside and follow him him amen then you're not worthy of the Gospel but you know rich people they find it easy to get what they want to fix Earthly problems you know by by their money and they and they and they find it difficult to Humble themselves this is where he was at this man that this Rich Young Ruler admitting you know they have to admit that they need someone else to provide for them that's an unnatural experience when you know but this as I said this can apply to more than just money there's there's people that were rich and intellect they're they're rich in looks they're rich in power they and all of these can fall into the same trap and the disciples are essentially asking when they would ask they would ask this question as we'd go and the disciples heard it and they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved if this man cannot be saved there's a squeal up here there if these men cannot be saved then who can be saved and if you get to looking at that they thought that let me have me a handh here they thought that there was uh that there that if you had the blessings in your life and they had big big Barns and you had a great amount of money and you had all these things then then then it was impossible that God didn't have his favor upon you amen that God's favor was not upon you so they would look at all of this and they would see this man had many riches and they'd see he had many Barns and they'd see he had all these things Earthly uhh attributes but and so they thought well if this man can't be saved cuz surely he has God's blessings on him amen but brother Brandon would say not always is riches or things like this a sign of God's blessing amen but many times it's exactly the opposite but you know he said so so they were looking they were essentially if those if those we think are blessed by God cannot be saved then who can be saved what hope is there for the rest of us we don't have the riches he has we're poor we we've all of this and Peter said yes Lord behold we have forsaken all and follow thee what shall we have therefore and Jesus said verily I say unto you this Matthew chapter 19 and: 28 Jesus said verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory you also shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone that has forsaken houses and Brethren and sisters and fathers and mothers or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive aund F and shall inherit everlasting life amen he said but many that are first shall be last so in other words many that are thought that's going to be that were first here upon this Earth will be last over there and many that were last here shall be first over there amen what is it it was God's requirements to follow him and brother Brandon would take a message from this and he would call it forsaken all Amen to to be able to walk to have faith to go with him you have to have faith that you not you but it's him that's the that leads the way it's not you that can make the way but he makes the way it's not you that can make make things happen it's him that makes things happen you know he said the greatest thing I found in a Christian Life is letting the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you and his work is marvelous how many's ever been led by the spirit of God he said that's wonderful led by the spirit of God there's no one would lead you to the altar but the spirit of God there's no one that would bring you here tonight but the spirit of God he said is that right he moves in mysterious ways and his wonders to perform he said how God knows how to do things if we would just follow him he said we're not here to lead God but God's here to lead you amen I'm thankful you know we have our ways and what we want but if we can just surrender our wills and our ways and our thoughts to his thoughts and to his ways amen they're much higher than our ways amen we think we're giving up a lot when we come to Christ you're not giving up nothing compared to what you get amen it's peanuts compared to what you am me what you experience when you give your heart to Christ I was speaking to a young man just the other day and I told him you know many times young people think well I'm going to give up friends I'm gonna give up my my popularity at school or I'm going to give up this but I'm here to tell you what you're going to get is greater than what you're going to give up amen because God will never be an endeav it to anyone amen If he if you have to give up friends if you have to give up family well he'll give you more friends and better friends and better family amen but you have to have faith to walk with him to go with him amen it's not going to be always easy listen the path that he lead sometimes looks very dark it's very steep it's very hard there's a lot of Trials there's a lot of things that goes on and we don't know and we kind of lose our our our bearing sometime but if you'll just continue to walk with him God to make sure you make it all the way through it's just as I was saying the other day amen he said let us go into the other side listen he wasn't concerned about the water he wasn't concerned about the winds he wasn't concerned about the waves he already had the answer for amen listen God's the same way in this day he's not concerned about a sickness or an issue in the sense that he's helpless he's never helpless but he always has an answer he always able to provide he's always able to move you in the right place if you will yield yourself to him but you know see we we try sometimes to lead God the way we want to go you know we want we want it to go our way you know many many times and and that's because we're rich in our pride or we're rich in our own ideas but see we got to lay all that aside he said we are the ones to be led he said I I want I love that how God likeness unto sheep he said did you ever see a sheep that was lost why he's the most helpless Critter there is is in the world he can't find his way out he can't protect himself he can't fight for himself he can only stand there and bleed until a wolf eats him or he dies he can't find his way back he said that's the way it is when a man is lost he's totally helpless hallelujah amen if you're without God tonight you are totally helpless you said well I got my way figured out well it may work out all right for a while but one day you're going to come to the end of your way and God if you don't have God on your side and you're going to end up in a heap of trouble and like that sheep out there somewhere ate by the Wolves but if you'll just come God's way and allow God to come on your life allow God to lead you and guide you then God can take you into places that you never dreamed possible before he said that's the way it is when a man is lost he's totally helpless there's nothing you can do about it God through his grace will come though and lead you to Christ Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him and all that he draws come and I that comes I will give him everlasting life what a promise he said I wish I could get every person here that would that would just sink down under the fifth rib on the left side till they hit the core of the heart you'll see people get up with all kind of diseases hanging on them walk out of this building rejoicing refusing to have it cripples would walk why cuz they refuse to know anything else but but God's Will and God's way amen if we could have that kind of Faith he said well you're scared you're afraid to make the start you're waiting for God to come down and pull you out God doesn't do that you're the one that has to make the step but he give the promise that says come on then you follow then God will move amen listen that's exactly how it is you feel that tug follow me amen amen but let me tell you if you continue to push that down and you continue to push it back in the back part of your mind well maybe another service maybe another time maybe another day I I I'll follow him but if you continue to feel it amen you need to respond God's waiting for your response he's waiting for you whether it be in your seat to say Lord I'm sorry or you come to an altar Whatever It Is God is looking for you to move amen he's looking for you to do something but here this the scripture talks about it in Luke 18 and verse 18 about the Rich Young Ruler he he asked a wonderful question he said good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life now notice what he's asking for he ain't asking for more barns he ain't asking for nothing he wants eternal life that's a good question that's a good desire right Jesus said why why callest thou me good none is good save one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor he said yes all these I've kept for my youth he said Jesus heard these things he said but yet thou lackest one thing sell all thou Hast and distribute it unto the poor that thou may have treasure in heaven and come follow me in other words you're not going to be able to follow me having all what you got brother Brandon would say the brother brother Brandon would say we need to unpack that's right amen it's not a time to be packing up getting ready to go it's a time of unpacking unpacking our pride unpacking our thoughts unpacking the thing and this is where he was he he had so much confidence in his riches and and Jesus saw what his weakness was he saw what when he got in a hard spot what he really depended upon no matter what he said no matter what he would do any other way he saw what what what he would depend on in a weak moment he wouldn't go to God he would go to his riches he wouldn't lean upon the word of God he would go to his riches amen this is where many times we find oursel God knows exactly what you need to get rid of there's some people that can handle money and handle things and and not ever not ever get them into a place where that's what they all depend I'm not talk I'm not trying to Sayan there ain't a person that's got over whatever money you know that you have to have a certain amount in your account or you ain't going to make it that ain't what I'm talking about if that was the case we'd all make it you know if you had to have a Millions if you had a million that capped it off if you had over a million dollars in your account then you couldn't make it to Heaven Well we'd be shouting Glory but you know that that's not what I'm talking about what I'm talking about is if we have something in our life that we depend on in our weakness that when we come to a moment of weakness or a moment that we don't know and maybe it be a temper that's what you go to first or maybe it be some kind of other thing that you allow to rise up in your life this is where God is Jesus is looking at this young man and he said he's wanting eternal life but you know all he's got to do is get rid of Earthly possessions and if you think about it that's a really good trade it may not be easy trade for him at the moment but down the road it would have been a really good trade and I'm sure down the road he would have loved to go back to that moment and make that train but down the road when he found he said brother B said next time you see him is he's lifting up his eyes in Hell amen he couldn't have that moment no more amen he didn't have that opportunity no more but he would have loved to had it in that moment and one day young men young women you're going to come to a place if you don't give your heart to God you're going to want the moment you had on a Wednesday night you're going to want the moment you had when you felt that pull and you felt that call and you refused it service after service after service and you knew there was things that you needed to get give up and you just held on to him you got to have faith to go with him amen because listen what he's going to give you is better than what you got it may not always look like that but let me tell you I can ask every Christian in here a real born again Christian have you had hard times in your life yeah we all had Hard Times amen you're going to have more hard times but has it been worth it have you got more than what you left hey or do you now have more than what you had before yeah you may have traded things where it ain't so much in riches or so much in this that and the other Earthly possessions or whatever amen Earthly family you may have had to leave but listen God will not be indebted to no one God will always give back more than what he [Applause] requires amen this is what he was trying to tell this young man listen I got more riches than what you got amen when you know here he was good Master what what what what am I going well keep the Commandments well I've done that for my youth and he told him what they were and he said I've did this but one thing you lack if you want to have eternal life you sell what you got and give it to the poor and take up your cross and follow me the young man was asked to forsake all but he refused to do it amen he asked to forsake all but he refused to do it he said if we apply prosperity and riches and so forth we think sometimes that's success but this young man was a successful young man but didn't have eternal life he said sometimes success doesn't always mean that God's blessing you so let's follow it we find him here's a young man perhaps a handsome young dress nicely dressed and the Bible says Jesus loved him he must have had a good tender uh uh uh spirit about him conscience about him he might have been he must have been a very fine young man never You' never win the admir admiration of the Lord Jesus because when Jesus but Jesus looked at him he said the scripture said he loved him he must have had maybe a kind look or a just a clean gentleman a straight cut boy but he walks up to Jesus and perhaps thinking in sincerity I would like to know what I can do to have eternal life but when he had to depart with what he had to have to get eternal life he said that same he said the question was at the gate whether he would make the right choice and he said that question lays before every one of us Jesus really asked him to forsake all that he had take up your C my cross and follow me we know the story he went away sorrowful that's right he went away with his heart broken because he had many great riches and Jesus turned and said how hard it would be for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven be like a camel to go through the eye of the needle it but but that which is impossible with man with God is not impossible it's impossible for a man to make it but without without with God it's not impossible Hallelujah I look at that and I think about I think of it this way he's saying look amen you might think it's impossible for somebody like that to be Sav but if he'll give everything he's got to God God will make it possible amen we look at sin sinful men sometimes we think there ain't no way they ain't impossible that there's no way they can do it but somehow God rich in mercy God can make it possible amen I'm thankful he made it possible amen I was some of the worst one of the worst amen but God God made it possible you see many times we want to hold on to everything that we can and then follow Jesus well that's the reason why that's that's the reason why we're not getting some to the Holy Ghost because it's not a true repentance a true repentance is not just saying I'm sorry it's a it's a repenting of it and turning from it and a dying out too many wants to come and say I'm sorry but they want to come and pick up the same stuff and go right back with it they'll never get it amen you see we want to hold on to everything that we can and then still follow Jesus but Jesus wants us to turn loose of everything so we can get both hands on him see we can't have one hand in the world and one hand in Jesus's hand amen no man can serve two masters you know brother Brown tells a story in the middle of the sermon I I really love this story so I'm just going to bring it in he talks about his two daughters that are there uh in the house and he comes in late and they he gets up early sitting in his recliner what Rebecca saw him first and she come running jumped on his knee you know and and and she was sitting there and she was just enjoying sitting on his knee and here Here Comes little Sarah said and said she she she looked over there you know and Rebecca wanted to know she got to Daddy first and you know I I I beat you you beat you I ain't no more you can't have this spot and and brother ROM said I just kind of move one leg over a little bit and showed her there was another spot over there and here she come running you know just jumped up in my arms and and I put my armed around her and she said and she looked around she and Rebecca looked at her said Sarah I want you to know one thing I was here first she said I've got all of Daddy and there's none left for you he says said see I was here first but poor little Sarah just dropped her head down and and then but I took my finger and I reached out like that and pushed the other leg out and I motion to Sarah to come and here she come and jumped up on the leg and while she couldn't balance herself her little legs wouldn't hit the floor hardly but she was on the leg anyhow so she toddled around like that what to keep her from falling I just put my arm around her and held her and I was holding her close to me and she put her little old head against me a little bit and she looked up at Becca and she said Rebecca my sister I want to tell you something too I may be so that you may be so that you got all of daddy but I want you to know that Daddy's got all of me amen that's the way it is we want him to have all of us we want him to have all of us so the there therefore to do it we have to walk out there by faith and believe him when he calls us to come to believe that he has a place for us to believe that he has a a spot where we can rest upon to believe that he's not bringing us out here for our our harm or for our destruction but he's bringing us here so he can put his arm around us listen God's not taking you through a trial or through a sickness or through an issue amen for your destruction and for your hurt he takes you there so he can put your AR his arms around you he wants you to know listen I've got all of you I've got you in your struggle I've got you in your problems I've got you in your sickness I've got you in this moment maybe you can't reach the floor and you're all out of balance and you don't know which way to turn but God's got his arm around you we can't explain it sometimes but you just got to walk out in faith and trust him there's no way to explain it sometimes you got to believe it but this Rich Young Ruler he couldn't give himself to Christ so he went away and find him later when the words are spoken Soul take thy wet rest and he goes into another place he wasn't worried about those barns then he wasn't worried about his riches then that he hadn't the safe up there he wasn't worried about his gold knob doors and door his gold knob doors and and all the beauty beauty that he had acquired at this moment none of that mattered What mattered is if I could just get a drink if I can just have that drink again this is where we're coming to sooner or later the the chapter on this world is going to end and it's going to come to a place to where all those things you thought was so important ain't going to be so important no more things you thought about in service a time after time that distracted you and kept you from getting something from God or that little something you allowed to rise up every time you felt that pull it would rise up and hit it and knock knock it back down listen some sometime or another that ain't going to be important no more it's going to come to a place that you'll say Lord if I could just go back to that church and I could get another drink if I could just go back to that place and I could get just drink in what you had for me if I could just partake of it and then I my soul could be satisfied but you won't be able to that's exactly what God requires forsake all to follow him what would my friend say who cares let's just just just be real tonight who really cares what anybody else says what all that matters is what he says like the man that the boy that played the violin and and he played such a beautiful rendition of some song and and the crowd would just go wild and praising him and and all that he just looking up up up in the balcony somewhere because up there was the master and that's all that mattered was with whether the master that taught him how to do this was pleased with what he done that's all that going to matter amen will will your life be found worthy of the Gospel yes will it be found worthy to escape the things that are coming upon this Earth listen there's a there's a ball of fire about to hit this Earth amen is going to be Burnt Over by nuclear destruction and then by the fire of God and and listen when all that happens those that are righteous will be righteous still and those that are filthy will be filthy still and we'll look back and we'll think about our times listen I guarantee you I I I would I would be willing to bet Elvis Presley would love to come and make some different choices those who say they don't believe in God I'd say about right now if they pass that line they'd love to come back make some different choices about their life but why we got a choice why we got an opportunity to make a choice why we got an opportunity to take a drink from his cup and to take into our lives eternal life why don't we drink we find him lifting up his soul in hell cuz he didn't have the faith to follow after him he didn't have the faith to go with Jesus I think about Nicodemus how close he came we won't really know the ending of his story till we get on the other side maybe because it's not really written that I know of in scripture but it came so close Judas came so close Judas would come to the point he'd kiss the doors of heaven and turn around and go to hell listen it's very serious hour I I didn't really expect this to get this serious but it's it's a very serious hour that we're living in we want him to have all of us we want to be in his trust and his confidence and we place our life in his hand that where he leads me I'll follow whatever I got to get rid of I'll get rid of whatever I got to do I'll do it while I got a chance to do it it's worth it I was telling this young man what led to the Lord I said it's worth it you you're going to you're going to find you're going to go through a lot of hard battles from this moment and you're going to have to fight and you're going to have to fight and Claw your way but it's worth it amen you're going to find that sometimes you're going to you're going to lose maybe a girlfriend or or lose some friends out there in the world but it's worth it amen amen you're going to find that you're going to going to lose friends or I tell you what what you're going to get you'll lose friends that are constantly pulling at you and dragging you down and you're going to gain friends that'll pull you up and lift you up amen you're going to you're going to lose family they're calling you a heretic and calling you amen a Holy Roller and calling you you join the call and you're going to get a family of God who put their arm around you and love you no matter what it's worth it forsake all that's God's requirement we got to do it sometimes we have to forsake our very own thoughts some of us are very rich in thoughts and very poor in filters well I just got to say something no you don't hey that's a family trade that's been passed down conquer that thing amen conquer that thing amen if it's if it's spewing out something that ain't the word of God you don't have to say it amen it's a truth you know we you need to allow it to kind of go through some filters let me tell you the best filter there is is this word right here this is a thinking man's filter amen it'll cause you to kind of whoop I don't need to say that nope I don't need to do that nope I amen what is it it is pulling in the life of God in your life and is pushing out all the things that we think so important scripture says he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of God's not even in him that's right it takes forsaken all when you're willing to forsake all and follow him then if you abide in me and my words in you then you can ask what you will and it'll be done that sounds like it's worth it amen he says if you cannot knowing you can't do it knowing you got things wrong you know they're wrong but you must forsake your own ideas you must cope to his word and never will the holy ghost ever deny any word that is spoke in the Bible it's it's been wrote and Vindicated by the spirit of God it'll never deny it amen he said if the same God that wrote the Bible is in you then you're not your own you're dead to your thoughts you're dead to your your thinking you're dead to the things of the world what is it the mind of Christ is now in you then you're forsaken all to follow him not our own thoughts not our own will not what my what but not my will but thy will oh Lord then you begin to line up with God's word you said what do I get then forsaken all forsaken all what do I get well you can expect the world to make fun of you you can expect people to call you all kinds of unhonorable names they'll call you anything that they can call you you'll be despised you'll be rejected well well I don't know you keep reading I'm not sure it's worth it well let me get let me let me get to it Jesus because of him being Emanuel God dwelling made him do things that was so odd to his own church to his own people they throwed him out as soon as he come in there was the one that hung him on the cross they was the one who condemned him he loved the people his whole heart was for the people but he had to forsake everything in order to follow God and so do we have to do it well what I getting to return some times I think we ministers making a little too much flowers for the convert oh my oh come on to Christ everything's lovely but you see it isn't that way all the time it isn't a flowery bed of ease because Christians have to fight he said the Bible said all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but if you're not so if you're not suffering persecution for Christ's sake something's wrong he said if the devil ain't after you he's got you man I like you can pin this one on your refrigerator if the devil Ain't Got You he's if he ain't after you he's got you that's all because as long as he's after you that's a sign he doesn't have you yet but if he isn't after you it's a sign he's got you but just remember as long as he's blasting at you your fuse jumps ahead of him yet just keep on [Applause] going hallelujah how many this week the devil been blasting at you blasting and Blasting and Blasting listen that's a sign he ain't got you yet he ain't got you in his fold he ain't got you in his place you don't belong to him amen you're still ahead of him keep going young people keep going well I'm having mind battles and I'm having this and I'm keep going all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution so Rejoice so what brother Timothy I've been really going through it rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so persecuted they the prophets which are before you so don't go around with a hung down face and say well I ought to have done it guess I should I guess I can't stand for somebody to talk about me I say I'm oldfashioned I I tell you should be exceedingly glad happy because you can bear the reproach for his name and by keeping his Commandments has caed you to do that by having his life has caused you to be able to stand I think about the disciples Jesus said follow me and they would follow him for some time matter of fact there'd be many that would leave and he would look at them and say well you go also and Peter said where where else shall we go only you have the words to eternal life but if you get down all the way down to it every one of them left him the Bible says in the garden when they come to get him there and they come to take him the disciples fled now Peter he followed him for a little further but before it was over he denied him and I but if you want to look at at that story doesn't end right there but he brought them together again he said look I want to bring you to a place and when you when you gather Jerusalem you shall be endued with power from on high and they got they got the Holy Ghost Inside of them and now they had the power amen with their faith to go and follow him no matter where he went Peter would go and be hung upside down Paul would be aide s aund all the disciples would give their life for this gospel yes sir why because the spirit of Christ had come on the inside of them why cuz they let it all go to follow him amen he said but I want to say this too this is after all the bad stuff persecutions the hurts things you go through but I want to say this too God will not in no wise be in debt to any man God won't be deaded to any man if you had if you've done it for God God will repay you a thousandfold that's right God will pay it back you've forsaken the things of the world and the things of your families and thing God will repay you so many times how many's a witness of that we all know that God will repay God will give back amen you can look at our first father of Faith Abraham Abraham forsook his own land the property of the home and everything else and was called out of Chala if you look at it I don't know what all Abraham had but maybe he just had a lot and a city and a and a house and that's all he had and here's the word come and follow me and he starts following him and he's given a whole country why because he forsook his little house he was forsook the little land that he had and his home and all and he followed at God he left it behind he said he forsook it and he said Abraham you look east west north south I'll give it all of it to you it's all yours he said that's what's the matter with Christians God gives it all to us but we're afraid to go investigate it step out follow him him when you become a Christian you're an heir to every promise in the Bible right everything that God promis you is like a great big arcade or a big store big store and by one Spirit we're baptized into this big arcade or store amen which is Christ he said I think what we ought to do as Christians find out what we got amen walk over there and see what's over there then walk over there see what's over there well you walk over here and you'll find hey hey there's a provision here for my healing I claim that and you walk over here and you'll find that there's a now you may go through a lot of hardships getting over here but you're walking through your possession God's given you and you get over here and say well there's provision there for my children I'll take that and you keep walking and following after Christ and you're battling and you're battling and you're battling but you're walking in your promised land and the devil the whole time is trying to tell you this ain't for you that ain't for you that ain't for you who are you devil God told me it's mine amen he told me to look east west south and north all that I see is mine and that's way I believe we ought to do as Believers look in the Bible look in the word look in the message of the hour and see what God has truly given us young people you need to look and see what God has given you he didn't just give it to your mam or your daddies he gave it to every every one of you but you going to have to forsake all but it's going to be worth it it's going to be worth it may have to give up some things but it's going to be worth it but really what are you giving up I mean I think about it you know guys got to give up smoke is that really that hard of a decision science itself is telling you it's killing you we got to give up drinking is that really that hard of a decision when you see the thousands of murders are done by drunk drivers and and the houses homes that are destroyed by drunk father is it really that heart of a decision well I had to give up my pornography is it really that hard of a decision it's a demon that's trying to destroy your life destroy your life destroy your family destroy your marriage destroy everything about you is it really that hard of a decision well let me just ask you we we're going to put some scales here on this side is is is eternal value on this side is Earthly value yes so let's put Eternal value over here yes eternal life this is use just one eternal life there's a lot goes into eternal life but eternal life and then we're going to put drinking over here as a scale moved any smoke it over here has a scale moved any any kind of form of sin has a scale moved any it don't compare this Earth does not compare to what we're going to get that's a good one brother I'm I'm might to drop that one sometimes he back there he's just dropping it you know you just got to pick it up and use it heaven's got the best extra exchange rate there is I can go to a country sometimes and man I can throw my little $100 on there and get a thousands of there or maybe a million of theirs I've been to countries brother Tim's been to them you had to go pay your hotel bill you take a suitcase slam full of money it's worthless paper but and all the reality but it's what you take yeah but you probably gave what 80 bucks to get a suitcase full but you're not you're not any richer matter of fact you probably can buy less but this ain't the way Heavens that's this ain't the how Heavens EX change rate works listen when you take on his life you can get more that's right yes sir amen when you take on his life you give up a lot less than what you get listen nothing that you can add up this whole world you can add up the best times of your life the best days of your life maybe you lived on this Earth maybe you live on it 80 years and out of those 80 years you could count 500 days I don't know just coming up with something simple 500 Days of the best days of my life yeah and you trade it for eternal life trying to break it down to young people can understand it's not what you're giving up it's what you're giving it's what you're getting what you're receiving right it ain't about what we give up it's peanuts it's peanuts when you when you look at it you might as well just have a bag of when you get through with your life and you lived 80 years you might as well just ate a bag of peanuts it's all it is in exchange for eternal life in exchange for something so we can't even describe as far as humanly speaking right now I can't even give words amen the Bible says eyes have not seen ears have not heard what is in store for those so the best days of your life your best vacation your best time your best birthday party your best everything does not compare to what awaits you on the other side it's worth going through the struggle it's worth going through the torment it's worth going through the situation you're in why cuz just on the other side is the greatest time of my life he says I think we ought to Christians ought to do is find out what we got sometimes it gets a little high up so we can't maybe reach it but I just get me a step later reach out of the Bible that God promised and lay my stay on my knees climb Jacob's Ladder until I reach it cuz it's mine God gave it to me he said if Divine Healing is Promised in the Bible and I'm sick I'll stay there till God gives it to me cuz it's a promise God promised it I'll forsake the world he give me the Holy Ghost I'll stay right there till he gives it to me because he promised it to me if God promised to give me the desires of my heart and the desires of my heart is the right thing I'll stay there till God gives it because it's a promise I've forsaken all the world I want to walk with him and he will pay all right it is I want to walk W with him I want to walk after him and he will pay sir you will never get something from him that says insufficient funds but he has a he's a king that owns a cattle on a th Hills and if it is there in his word it he will bring it to pass it doesn't matter what we say or what we do he will bring it to pass but Abraham he forsook his land his country and God gave him the entire entire portion of of Palestine he forsook his little bitty piece of land down there maybe an acre where his house set and it was an old house prophet of God received everything there was in Palestine that's a good exchange for the first time but the first thing he had to do was separate himself you know first Abraham come out but he brought his dad with him he brought lot with him his Kim but God didn't call all them he called him and I know sometimes that's the way we want it we want to bring everybody with us but sometimes God just called you and he had to walk away separate himself from his father and separate himself from lot and then when all of that happened then he can meet the angel under the oak tree then he could receive the promise for the body change and receive the promised child then God could do all those things why cuz he had forsook all he had forsook everything that was around him and mean God did Ne never did bless Abraham until he totally obeyed him as long as he had his daddy along and he said the old man was a fly in the Orman all time finally he died then lot was strife and everything and as soon as Abraham fully obeyed God and separated himself then lot got on down to the good lands where he wanted to go toward Sodom and got a appeared to Abraham lift up your eyes I give you the whole thing it's all yours Abraham was the one who separated he was the one who separated and F forsook all to follow after God and he's now known as the father of Faith so how are we going to be sons of Abraham if we don't have the attributes of Abraham we don't want to do what Abraham did but we want to get what Abraham got Israel forsook Egypt they forsook the old land down there in Egypt to receive what the promised land they came from a horrible place with taskmasters and slavery to get what their own place their own possessions their own land listen here he says you know he said there's a lot of people young people young women young men out drinking smoking doing things these police had to arrest a bunch of young women down there on the street the other day going Hog Wild wish they maybe do some of that today but anyway that Old Devil Spirit got in on them to do the little boogie woie or whatever you want to call it out there in the street going crazy in their mind but really if a young lady's got an ounce of dcent about her her and a young man either one that thing is a Taskmaster to drives them to do that you forsake that and God will give you a dance yes abely wow Oh my he sure will he'll give you one if you forsake that but you got to forsake all these things to haveen you cannot continue with both of them Israel left the Burning Sands of Egypt and the stripes on their back under that burning Sun to walk under the light of the pillar of fire they left all of that all of that taskmasters and all of that things that was burden them and bind them to walk with the pillar of fire what a trade and yet we have the same opportunity to walk with this Pillar of Fire not walk with him above us but walk with him in us I'm not saying he don't come above us in the church or around in your house or whatever sure but he is now not the God above us or with us but in us and we got that ability or that that that that chance to have that moment and yet we go right back to our slavery we go right back to the situations that we think are so important go right back to the things that we're so bound to and that we're actually slaves they left the garlic pots of Egypt to eat Angels food they left the stagnant Waters of Egypt to drink from the living W raw water from the rock they left all of that to fight what a trade I'm talking about trades here you know we're talking about exchange rates leave all that water of mud and mixed up with doubts and frustrations and arguments and stews and everything and and leave all of that to walk in in the light Amen to go with the Lord they left the boasting fish physicians of Egypt that we're the smartest men in the world we got the greatest signs we can do mummify we can do this we can do that to go with one who never let their satchels their their shoes fall apart their clothes didn't fall apart sickness didn't come in their midst what a trade they left those who were saying days of Miracles are pass and they left those that said there was no such a thing as a living God to walk with the miracle working God who could open a Red Sea who can make bitter water sweet who can do all of these things what did the disciples forsake what did they leave Nets fish toiling all night they tried on their own one night and toiling all night and they never caught a fish come to the one and said just pitch it on the other side well Lord we we've toiled all night we've tried we've done everything we're fishermen I don't know if you don't you don't know who we are we we that's what we do for a living that's who I am is I I am a Fisher I can do this but at Thy word they throw it over on the other side hi I I believe creation took place amen and it filled their Nets and filled their boats so they almost sunk them what a [Music] trade they forsaken their occupation they forsake forsook their Nets they forsook their fishing they forsook they forsook families they they forsook everything and would one day give their life for this gospel but today their names are lifted up as great men of faith and the one one of them was called said heard the same word follow me and he follows him to the place where he could give him a kiss and turn around and walk and walk away and and his name today I don't know I've lived 40 almost 48 years now I have not met one person named Judas anybody why cuz there's such a such a terrible thought to that name such a a stink a stench when you hear the name Judas why cuz he refused to go all the way and is name is cast down in history his name is you know that's what makes me so amazed at people that that don't believe that Jesus ever lived and all this I mean you got they got men that names are now forever and not just Jesus but Peter and Paul and all these on that are lifted up out of history and thought of as Heroes and a man who walked to the Gates of Heaven and walked away and people don't want to name their kid after him why because they don't want him to be like that I I didn't expected to go this way honestly I didn't have a lot of this in my own notes but God's calling somebody and he's saying follow me let's bow our heads I just we got to stop right there or you get out of your pride get out of your arrogance follow me brother Timothy I have been in this message a long time but have you forsaken all follow me [Music] I can think of aund things brother Timothy that I'd have to give up well I think I can just think of one thing you could get eternal life balance that out if you can [Music] it's not a sand castle it's not just some hope so we can read right there in the Bible and we can see things that are happening right now that was written thousands of years ago we know prophecies are being fulfilled we're at the closing moments of time and he's saying follow me already One Soul here at the altar if you feel to God took it down this path for a reason very serious [Music] I give you the opportunity why don't you try that exchange R for a moment follow [Music] me well brother Timothy I got means I'd have to oh I'd had to give up a lot of things [Music] yeah that's what first comes to your mind maybe you're not worthy but if you can push that down and say Lord no matter what I want to follow you yes I want to give my all to you Lord I want to surrender everything I I don't want to be just a Halfway half-hearted Christian [Music] you know I we tend to catch a lot of young people and that's good it's for them sometimes we find oursel older ones we've allowed things to rise up too in our walk with Christ that we allowed to be more important and we allowed to take precedence over things and follow me it'll be worth it it'll be worth [Music] it won't you give everything to him tonight give him those thoughts that you've had in the situ you don't you know just give it to him he'll exchange a lot his his exchange rate is great he got something better for you he's got more for you he's got more yes Lord I don't know what you feel tonight but I just feel the presence of God just calling wooing pulling I felt them the whole time I've been preaching like no it's got to go this way and I I've just tried my best to follow him even beyond what I thought and Beyond what I was thinking and Beyond what I what I what I wanted to serice to be this is his work and he's saying Follow Me Maybe we say it like this the master has come and he calleth for you he calleth for [Music] you [Music] father Lord Jesus you know our heart Lord Jesus [Music] we just ask Lord that you would have your way Lord in these hearts Lord we're in the closing moments of time and God we can't allow anything to get in the way of Walking With You
