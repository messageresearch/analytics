walk through that door we kneel at the throne we come boldly there knowing that our requests will be met Lord knowing that you're The God Who actually became man so that we could make this approach that you would be the intercessor that would make the way for us and open the door to heaven where that we could come before the throne and find Grace and help in our time of need Lord there are those that are needy today and are needing a touch from you Lord I pray God that you'll just reach out to them and to their needs today those that are on the internet listening in those that are in far-reach scenarios Lord wherever they are I pray that you'll meet with them today God those that are struggling with situations that we are in agreement with right now believe in God that as to join

glad to be a part of the moving of your Holy Spirit knowing Lord that you'll never take any of your word back but Lord that you will fulfill every Divine promise that you made and I'm looking to you

unction the word of God today in this meeting as we are the people o God that have been called for this day for this hour and we know our position in the word and we take authority today over every demon Spirit or wherever it's every Spirit of hell that would want to come against the Bride of Jesus Christ certainly Lord heaven is moving today things are changing Lord they can't remain the same because Lord you're in control of this situation and when you move Lord things happen and I pray oh God that you'll speak today from Heaven that you'll anoint Us by your Holy Spirit and give us

today with healing in your wings there are those that are sick that are needy Lord those that are babbling cancer something that was told by the angel of God that would not stand against our prayers and though Heaven has witnessed it we're believing today for brother Ron Spencer for his sister Danette Pruitt Lord for brother Ross Oglesby oh God forever need that is here in this building and around the world they're the hearts of God's children that are crying out to God for God to move and I believe Lord that suddenly you'll do it that the only things have been said in order in place and the trigger is being pulled and something is happening as the as you wind up and you finish up the Great Commission that you gave us to give and that's to go into all the world with this gospel with signs following them that believe in Jesus name meet the needs of your children we pray amen and amen God bless you man's good to be in the house of the Lord together and amen we just want to welcome each one of you today in the wonderful name of the Lord and amen welcome a new addition little Zoe back there with um her parents brought her for the first time so welcome Zoe and also the Winner's family brother Joe sister Becky let's give him a hand amen God bless you thank you for being here amen may the Lord may the Lord bless you and just continue to give you the desires of your heart and each one of you today that has assembled with us I pray that the Lord will um just be with you in a mighty mighty way and and uh so if you'll turn with me to Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9 we're just going to get right into the word I've got a lot of things that I'd like to minister on today a lot of places I'd like to go um in the sermon that as we will look into the manifold wisdom of God and what he's doing in this last day and and with the full Assurance of this promise I'm going to speak to you today on God remembers God remembers Genesis 18 and 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son then Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Sarah Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also God bless you you can be seated but Sarah had long forgotten the promises that God had given to to God to Abraham and she she felt as if she had solved this issue many years ago when she concluded that she was not the one to fulfill the promise and had given Hagar to Abraham to fulfill it but you know when God gives a word he has a plan and he's got a purpose and if he's got a plan for your life there's nothing going to stop that and I believe that we are people of a purpose today that are called and ordained for a reason in this hour and I believe that you know where we're living in we are living in also a fulfillment of promise and this fulfillment of Promise is almost a forgotten promise by the people like Sarah in that day and this is a promise I want to go to is revelation 22 and verse 20 is actually the the last things that concludes our Book of Revelation the unveiling of God and and um and and it says here as he the spirit concludes our book he says he which testifieth these things or gives witness to these things saith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus I think this is a very um great and wonderful thought as we look into the Fulfillment of the the New Testament we we would have to conclude that this was speaking to us because I believe we are the Fulfillment of the of the word of God that we're here in the day and hour we're feeling fulfilling everything that was spoken of a bride people and of course this is 2 000 years go for us but with God a thousand years is by the day so this is only yesterday that he said this but I believe that this is said specifically to the generation that to this generation and this was actually written to us the last generation and he said he that testified these things saith surely I come quickly and to that John says amen now John has typed the bride all the way through remember the Book of Revelation is a symbolic book and John will actually represent um us as he looks into the things that are going to be about the end time and and so many many of these scriptures John is actually representing the entire bride of Christ and so John says Amen to these things when he says surely I come quickly and John says amen and of course he's typed the bride the redeemed of the Lord all the way through and and of course as John does this you can see then the bride to fulfill this must get an agreement with this word When God Says behold I come quickly to a generation to an age and I want to say again I believe it's to our age that he is saying this not just to them of 2000 years ago or them of of the mid um the church ages but right here at the last age was really to this to this people that it was written and he is saying to you behold I come quickly because we are in the age in the day of his coming and being in the day of his coming you're going to have to get in agreement with it when he says behold I come quickly John representing the bride and to be the bride you're going to have to say the same thing amen and then you you see he says I come quickly amen he got in agreement with it immediately so we're gonna have to have a people that are in agreement of his of his coming that they they are not they're not just laying back and and unbelief but now they're in agreement with him this is what he's trying to do with Sarah in the scripture trying to get her in agreement but of course she has these objections as to why it can't happen for her in her day and and maybe how this is somehow another uh for somebody else for for something that's already happened and and it's a about a god of yesterday not a god of today and he has to bring it clear to her that there's nothing too hard for him and so we're gonna too have to get an agreement with what the spirit is saying I've I've given Witness and I want you to know that we are in an age in a time where God has given more Witness to the promises of his word then actually any age that there's ever been God has left no excuse for our unbelief in this hour he has made every way where that you would have a firm and constant faith in the promises of God he showed you I can heal anything I can deliver anything I can restore I am I am God there is nothing too hard for me and so there has to be a people then come in agreement with it and then begin to pray the last prayer of the Bible which says even so come Lord Jesus this must become the bride's prayer in agreement with his coming and the prayer for his coming now as we look at this as I said it has to become I prayer and I believe that this is why the evil of the last days becomes Sodom was before the burning so sinful that God could not tolerate it anymore I want you to understand you know maybe your level of Toleration has already reached its limit but God God comes a point that he cannot tolerate it any longer and this is got to become our prayer it must become the driving force behind behind every decision we make by every action that we take amen it must be our focus in this day of behold I come quickly now here is with Sarah God had given a promise he had not forgotten it ishmael's birth did not annul it but God remembered his promise but not as though he had forgotten I wanted to understand that God doesn't forget God bless you Sister Genie hadn't forgotten you either amen good to have you in service today but you say but again he is not forgotten us to say that God remembers us to say he is doing exactly what he has promised God that never forgets so again I want to cover it again to say that God remembers is to say that God is doing exactly what he had promised it may not be what we thought he would do or how he we thought he would bring it to pass but God is a plan and God has a purpose even for your suffering God has a purpose because he said otherwise God would be the author of confusion instead of the author of Peace so God has a purpose and a plan for everything that we are going through and in every instance of God remembering we we see it as always includes action when God remembers he has become the ACT God never forgets his promises or his people he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the creator of the universe and he doesn't suffer memory lapses in every instance if God remembering that we see in the Old Testament that it always includes an action for example God remembered Noah and made the waters recede and years later after hearing the Hebrews cry down in Egypt God remembered his Covenant with their ancestors and and he rescued them or delivered them out of that sin of prophet with a pillar of Fire and and so that but there are times that we feel like as human that God forgets us even as Israel they for they got to the point of God has forgotten us Zion said the Lord has forsaken me God has forgotten us but he said Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she is born those she may forget I will not forget you you see I have engraved you on the palms of my hands so God is not one that forgets but God is one who remembers and when he remembers a promise he puts his word into action so we're in the day and hour where that the word is being activated to fulfill the promises of his word so we're living in the film the days of the fulfill woman of the word of God God is remembered his promise and his appearing in his age to fulfill it after a long delay of 2 000 years and of course you know even some of the events that happened made men like Jack Moore and Gordon Lindsay write in their book you know Bible days are here again because they could see that God had remembered his promise and now the word was coming into action Sarah and Abraham their promise had been delayed for two for 25 years but when God called Abraham and gave him the promise of his son and becoming a nation you know maybe it was plausible then it was possible then even though it was still unlikely he was 75 Sarah was 65 but you know even when the promise given seemed impossible and Satan delayed it anymore God had not forgotten it and with God he's never too late and there's nothing ever that is too hard for God so when things even get more difficult seems like it's less possible less possible all reasoning is all against it that's when God is moving and I want you to understand that in your situation God will not forget you he will remember you in your situation because he said I cannot forget you you know you may forget to pray for me I may forget to pray for you but God cannot look at his hands without remembering you so in the days of Noah while the ark Was preparing when the once the last one is in the ark the Deluge begins there has been a delay of 120 years it was a long time general you know a whole generation of people were born maybe others died the long suffering of God every day seemed like just another day and there was no rain there was no clouds there was no Thunders there was no warning other than a prophet's Voice who warned about the coming judgment and the day the Deluge began it probably began with another bright shining morning now and of course when when uh when this happens like this and there seems like God is forgot and the word of the Prophet is not going to come to pass you know then the promises and the prophet is mocked amen so it is today it is as the Bible prophesied at the end time it it speaks of the coming of the Lord and and the time of the process of fulfillment that and it and sometimes it looks like that God has forgotten you know that in this delay uh nothing is happening but things were Contin you know and that things are just continuing on like it's always done I want just to say to you that I believe the Rapture Day that day where when the the change comes when the dead in Christ rise it will be another day just as usual the sun will come up just like it always was you see the Morning News will be the same with politics and rapes and murders and bombings and troubles and and strife everywhere life will be going on as usual yet it'll be a very unusual day because it'll also be a supernatural morning the dead in Christ will suddenly appear and the change will be on but think of it for most it'll be a day just the same nothing unusual no changes everything the same nothing's happening and there's something very Supernatural is happening and yet but the world left behind things will swiftly change and it'll change for the worst his light will be gone the holy spirit will lift from the earth the mighty Angel who holds down the evil beastly powers of upon the land and the Sea will lift his feet and the bride of Christ will lead from here and once he leaves all restraints will be lifted from Satan and he'll become the full King of the Earth and hell will take full residence upon the Earth and Satan's kingdom will be here in full force it might not but he's going to have his kingdom upon the Earth and guess what during that time as I explained last Sunday God gets revenge he don't get to enjoy his kingdom without a torment or two because God will torment in him by pouring out the plagues and bringing him into chains and and chain him for a thousand years are you with me now and of course the Bible tells us though it's going to be a terrible time for those that are left behind that he says woe to the inhabitors of the Earth for the devil has come down to you but he says to those who have been raptured to those who are now in the Heavenly Dimensions Rejoice O heavens and you who dwell with them but woe to them on the earth and the Sea and for the devil has come down to you in great wrath because he knows his time is short and then he immediately pursues the woman Israel and the remnant of her seed now we read last Sunday from Peter's Second Epistle he tells you what happens when men begin to say in their heart the Lord's delayed is coming when it looks like that God has forgotten and things will remain the same people's attitude will turn to scoffing and that men who once walked with God will begin to walk in their own lust and I believe we're in the time where when most of Christendom has given up on the coming of the promised son they've just settled down to church joining and Holiness people like the methodists for example who were thought of as Holiness people some years ago many of now have joined with the sodomites others are now pulling away from a new denomination and there's there's much upheaval that is going on and you might ask me where are we in time oh well this is nearly to 2023 brother Tim no where are we in Bible prophecy where are we in the scripture and I want to press upon you today by the scripture that where we are we we are now in a time where the prevailing attitude of many is that the Lord has forgotten his original objective and they are saying that the Lord has delayed his coming and so they have just pushed it away it's no longer in the Forefront of their thinking it's no longer the attitude of living every day as if he's coming today so they come into a LAX attitude and this becomes even more prevalent here as a laodicean spirit comes and anoints people and if you're not careful that attitude will show up and nearly everything you do or say and you know and it's not necessarily something that will be verbalized but it'll be an attitude that attitude will be shown in church attendance where you were urged and told well you know that as we see that day approaching make sure you assemble together you're going to need strength from one another you're going to have to hear the word of God to be fortified you're going to have to gather together in his name even more but you know men use every kind of excuses when you know again this is no longer in the Forefront of their mind or their thinking you know they become into the time of delay words and their attitude I just say it this way their attitude really stinks you know because they act as if they're gonna things are just gonna always remain the same as they've always been but I want to infer to you today that we are here at the moment of change we are here at a moment where that that is suddenly things can begin to happen and I want to and I I don't want to diminish what is happening looking for what's going to happen because God is actually moving behind the scenes already working but sometimes we get so caught up with the news and the world and what it's doing and our daily lives until it becomes oblivious to us what God is really doing but I want you to begin to realize and be conscious that in this age God has been doing and is doing spectacular things as he winds up the end time events you're special people to be a part of this age but also there are those that are also a special people that are so specially evil yeah because the Bible tells you very clearly he said understand this in the last days terrible days are coming for men will be lovers of their own selves lovers of money and boastful and arrogant abusive and disobedient to parents and ungrateful Unholy unloving unforgiving Slanders without self-control brutal without love of good and uh and traitors and Reckless and conceited and lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denied his power and he said turn away from these you turn away from them you avoid that amen and then and he said these are the kind who wormed away in the households and Captivate vulnerable women which brother Brandon said her churches who are weighed down with sins and led astray by various passions who are always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and just as Janice and jambres oppose Moses so do these men oppose the truth so again it speaks of this anointing in this last day opposing the truth the truth will be opposed might as well get used to it might as well be prepared for might as well not be shocked by it the truth will be opposed I wanted to say even even right down to the end to the last message even within the last followers of the message the truth will be opposed because the last place to reject him is those who call theirselves message so truth will be opposed but I want to just impress upon you today God is right on time nothing is out of order God at an appointed time and and the wheels of God's cogs of Prophecy of Brethren would say it you know grind slow but sure and I want to reassure you today God has not forgotten one of his promise amen and and I I'd like to step back today and look at the age that we're not living in where that God has been doing great and mighty things in our generation preparing you trying to do everything you can to get a faith within your heart to believe and there are many things that has already happened to show us that God has not forgotten us you know all the types in the Bible whether whether of women such as Sarah or Rebecca or Ruth or Rahab or Esther the Virgin Mary or men such as Enoch or Abraham or Moses with the Exodus or Joshua with the placing into the inheritance every one of these every one of them was speaking of and prophesying and pointing to you people in this hour amen there are more than stories in the Bible there are Prophecies of the last day and Jesus Christ himself was the Fulfillment of the Old Testament so the bride which is Christ in feminine form his body must be the Fulfillment of all the scripture but both of the old and the New Testament and since he was a groomed the bride has to come forth for the marriage of the Lamb has come the bride will will have to be on on the display of the fulfilling of all the revelations that the biblical Patriarchs have spoken and prophesied with their lives so if the Bible's if the bride rather says and or does something different from the groom you know it isn't the bride amen because she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone in life of his life and power of his power she is him and as a man and a woman becomes one at the wedding so must Christ and his bride become one one in signs one it works one in faith one in Doctrine Now Eve was taken from Adam's side and The Feminine Spirit was taken from him in place within her so much the life and the spirit of Christ be in the bride and that man will make of the Bride both mechanics and Dynamics the word empowered by the spirit I want you to say we are anointed with the same spirit that made Jesus the Messiah and that makes us anointed Messiahs to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he is not dead but he is here in bright form by the Holy Ghost God the in his people so Jesus the bridegroom is here he is here in his people and he is moving among his pride with a love affair pouring out into her himself I want to assert to you today that we are still in the days of the pouring out of God's spirit and there is still more of the spirit of God for you to receive D amen the bride becoming one with him for the wedding supper and the same signs that are spoken the word that spoke of Jesus is now to be displayed by the same manifestations that Jesus had and when we believe that it creates a perfect faith that would and that and it's that perfect faith that it takes for a Rapture if the groom said the work said I do shall you do also you know it must not be dismissed it must not just say well that was for brother Branham it must be it must be that we realize the works that I do shall you do also and it must be displayed in the bride a minute the word spoken by Joel says in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh then the bride must be the vessel it is poured out into somebody is going to be the recipient of that Hallelujah at Mark 16 says these signs shall follow them that believe they will speak with new tongues they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover then it has to happen she must be like the groom the fullness of the word the godhead bodily she must fulfill Isaiah's prophecy of the Horizon sign for thy light has come she must fulfill the word spoken of the with the spoken of the groom because she is one with him and that is the spirit the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captive and recovering of the sight to the blind to seventh Liberty that were of them that were bruised amen this is this is the anointing that is among the bride in the last day she must have the spirit upon her to preach the gospel to the poor to preach Deliverance to the captives terrific to preach the recovering of the sight to the Blind and to set at Liberty I want you to know it it's not just preaching but it's also setting at Liberty them that are bound amen so you see and then to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and I just want you to know we are still in the acceptable year of the Lord this is the Fallen the Fulfillment of the true Pentecost of The Seven Ages of the of the seven weeks of where where that it comes and then on the 50th day the day of Pentecost fully comes so we're in the day of the Lord's acceptance God is setting or is accepting a bride taking her into rapture amen we are here in a day of acceptance you are not a rejected people you are an accepted people and you see God cannot forget his promises if God was prophesied through all of these in the Bible God cannot let one word of that prophecy fail it must come to pass God cannot forget it God cannot go back on his word God must fulfill it now Sarah certainly was prophesying to this age it was a time where the church had given up on the Promises of the coming of Jesus and it just had sunk down in unbelief satisfied that Ishmael the child of the denominational bombs woman is the error the delay has taken a toll on her faith instead of her getting stronger she has gotten weaker and and so it is with many today but I I just want to want you to understand and don't don't become discouraged in this hour don't just settle back and think it's all just going to remain the same the way it's always been because regardless of how much you perceive it as God's no longer working or God's no more no longer moving or it seems to be a delay that that even in our day there has been a rapid I just wanna you know pound it in a rapid fulfillment of scriptures I want you to know that even in our day time after time things suddenly changed amen and I want you to realize that you're in a moment of Sudden Change things are happening things are right at the point where the triggers have not pulled the sights are aimed you know it's all inside us the scriptures are all lined up but in one moment the trigger can be pulled after a delay of 2000 years this generation has seen scriptures come alive amen there's been actually a rapid fulfillment of Prophecy and and today we can actually say about much of the scripture and declare without hesitation this day this scripture has been fulfilled and the endless every Divine promise it that spoke of a bride is is now in the process of being fulfilled there are things that are that are in action that are moving no matter whether it's in our economy whether it's in our the White House whether it's in World politics whether it's in the church whether it's in the sodomites and whatever no matter what it is listen if you can see movement out there you've got to know that God's doing something in his bride if you can see things happening and lining up there how much more are we being searching the scripture today to see what's lining up for the hour that we're living in now God has done many mighty things in this age already but don't keep it all in the past amen because because we're still in the hour of his coming scripture is being fulfilled as I speak you see this parallels to his first coming as Jesus of Galilee were the scripture suddenly became fulfilled rapid events after delays were actually from Malachi to um to to the opening of the first testament Matthew that that there was hundreds of years where that it was just seem like silence seemed like nothing was happening seemed like God had forgot or God it is given up or he had went in the heavens and was busy about something else but he was no longer interested in the Affairs of man but I want you to understand God had not forgotten he had he had to wait until certain things were lined up in his plan because God has a plan there had to be certain things here in the Book of Daniel would tell of the rise and Falls of Kingdoms and it would show you that Rome would come into being it would come into place and and hear it you know it would come with its with its iron ways and begin to bring persecution upon the Israelites and the Jewish people that would rise up with resistance like The Maccabees and whatever but they couldn't throw it off because it was prophesied I want you to understand the same thing today you can do all the prepping you want to you can organize all the rallies you want to you can get people to go and March in Washington D.C it'll never change anything I want you to understand that prophecy is there for these things to be as they are and they are in their place I just want to make sure that you understand as the bride of Christ you too must be in your place [Applause] Sarah's out of sort Sarah's out of her place Sarah is unbelieving and she's got to get in place I want to remind you all the unbelief all the doubt all of even the scoffing the laughing in her heart never changed who she was and never change God's promise you see God didn't just give up on his pride does not give up on his promise God didn't give up on the air of the promise and God's not going to give up on you no matter how much you have stumbled how long you have fallen how deep you have gone how impossible your situation looks God doesn't give up in fact he declares looking at your situation there's nothing too hard but my brother my sister my friend my my children my this this oh it's it's impossible brother Tim it's not impossible it's not but God sometimes Waits until it looks impossible before he moves and he does this for a purpose he has a reason maybe I don't understand the reason but God's got a reason and a purpose and so you know you know even though from Malachi to John the Baptist there's hardly anything that God spent we don't even have a recorded scripture of anything that God said we don't have another prophecy we don't have another Prophet we don't have another word from God to write it 500 years and then suddenly I don't know how it kicks in but all of a sudden even when righteous people such as Sarah has given up even when Israel was in such despair that it looked impossible God Appears Angels start appearing things starts changing like I said I don't know the key I don't know how to make it happen I don't know if you can make it happen I think of the Pentecostals who have prayer who have prayed and passed it and everything you know for 117 years for there to be another Azusa Street and it's never happened and yet they would fast and pray and try to call it down and it didn't happen but it's going to happen anyway and I'm just going to say things as something this morning even sometimes when you don't believe God is hasn't given up and your unbelief ain't gonna hinder him and back to the matter he's going to start doing things to get you to believe it again and maybe in your heart today your faith has died maybe it's at the lowest moment maybe you can't hardly hold on anymore that's what God Specializes in things that are thought impossible and he certainly shows up to produce the faith in your heart when you have given up God doesn't give up in fact God remembers suddenly in the days of the New Testament as it opens nothing's happened for 500 years suddenly like I said I don't know how it kicks in I don't know that I don't know you know sometimes you think oh you know what could I do what could I do or how could I make this happen God's Got A Time God has a purpose God has a plan but it's going to happen suddenly an angel appears first to Zechariah he is a man that is chosen for by lot and you know as a priest and for the first time in his life he is now chosen to bring incense into the holy place and and this has been done now for thousands of years this way it was a ritual that was instituted by Moses and thousands of times before this the incense just like this day had been taken into the holy place and it seemed just like another usual day but today was somehow different that even though it was usual there was a supernatural element that was beginning to happen and today his answers was put up on the fire which represented the prayers of Israel today his prayers would be mixed with the incense and suddenly there would appear Gabriel where he says where he says to Zechariah your prayers have been heard I want you to say I want to submit this this was not the first time he had prayed he was now about 65 years old he had been praying he had been praying for a promised son he had been praying for Israel to be delivered he had many prayers that he had prayed this was not the first time he had prayed but today his prayers were answered today God was moving on the scene I showed you last Sunday in my closing of the seventh seal that holds a bowl of prayers that are held up maybe you have prayed for things and you have prayed for things and you have prayed for things and maybe it hasn't come to pass yet but there there Comes a Day there comes a day when there comes not just a prayer but a supernatural element begins to move in and God says your prayers have been heard today I want you to know your prayers have been hurt they you know no doubt they've been heard for a long time and but they've been held up they're not been answered but not only that but the old woman Israel who is she too was the barren woman waiting now for thousands of years the word that came was thy that there will come a seed through the woman that will bruise the head of the serpent and it looked impossible and they were all under in bondage now by the Romans who were brutal there was all kinds of suffering that was going on it was an evil day or as taxations by Herod that would require every man to go to his hometown to be taxed and babies were killed by ruthless tyrants they were held captive and you know brutally cruel men doing things to them ravishing their women destroying their economy doing everything enslaving them and keeping them in bondage but on this day it's the same yet it's very different on this day it's zachariah's turn to offer the incense this is what the thing that as a son of Aaron of the tribe from and a descendant rather of of Aaron that he would because there was the Levites you know and so they also were were had different uh various things in the temple but only the sons of Aaron could operate within the inner framework of the Temple and today was his turn to offer the incense this had never happened this happened only one time in his life and he would be chosen by lot to offer the incense in other words if I could say it I don't know how they did it but it's like drawing your name out of the heart and every time that the Hat was passed his name got overlooked every time that it looked like that he would be the one today to offer the incense that that he could have a chance at it it went day after day after day after day and now he's 65 years old it looks like he will get old enough because you know when I say old enough I'm talking about decrepit enough that he could no longer perform in the temple it looks like he'll never have the opportunity and and yet today he's chosen by lot to do the most solemn sad part of the the day ceremony and that that was to offer the incense and it would symbolize Israel's prayers were being accepted by God he would choose two of his relatives which are his friends no doubt because they too had to be of the sons of Aaron to go in with him to prepare at the offer of incense if you can see it for a moment the first helper that he had would remove what had been left on the altar of emphasis from the previous evening service and then in prayer he would walk backwards away from that from The Altar and then the second helper now came forward and he would spread live coals that were taken from that morning's burnt offered and then he would to worship and back away and that's the people and the priest waited outside Zechariah now stood alone in the Holy place it was lighted it was lit only by the seven golden candlesticks I hope you get the picture and here is all of the the candle lid that had been lit and you know the other priests had done their duties of refilling the vessels with oil and trimming the Wicks on the LA on the seven golden candlesticks and it was shining brightly and that as he would as he would move toward that heavy that heavy Veil that that hum between the holiest of holies there would be the ultra of incense on which Now red coals were glowing it was as near to the holiest of holies as it could get to his right would be the table of showbread to his left the seven golden candlesticks and there he would wait until a special signal indicated the moment had come and then he would walk forward and he would spread his incense him on the altar and the priests and the people had reverently moved back from the altar in the courtyard and now they were prostrate before the Lord because they were offering prayers and Thanksgiving for God's mercies provision Deliverance along with blessings and asking God for deliverance asking God to send that Messiah I'm a cloud of smoke from the incense was beginning to form and begin to move upward in the Holy place Zachariah would wait until he was sure that the incense was burning well and then he would bow down in prayer himself and reverently leave the holy place except today was different there was a Wonder sight that it met his ice an angel stood there and he said fear not Zechariah your prayers have been heard and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son you see week two are at an end time and Angels appear in the end time all the prophets and the signposts are saying that this day that angels will appear the prophets will arise signs and wonders and if God did that for those little Junctions right there what will he do when all hell is turned loose you can expect God to be moving amen Angels appearing in signs and wonders on the earth and counterfeits arising and God have proven who's right and who's wrong prayers that have been prayed and God says to him your prayers have been answered your prayers have been heard we're right now in the cycle where there's something fits in the great fixing the house well Zachariah says the angel how can I be certain of this I'm an old man my wife is is advancing age and he says well I am Gabriel and I stand in the presence of God I've been sent to to tell you this good news but because you have disbelief because you have questioned because you have expressed doubt and wondered how can I be sure of this when you have stood in the presence of the angel of God when the voice of God is spoken to you and said I your prayers have been heard and you are now questioning and wondering and asking out loud and verbalizing how can I be sure this in other words how do I know you're not lying because you did not believe my words you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens in other words if you're going to question this I'm going to shut your mouth amen I'm not going to tolerate another word of doubt another word of unbelief and if you want God to shut up your mouth you just start questioning what God's doing in this end time [Music] amen because God is not going to tolerate unbelief coming out of the mouth of his people he will cause you to be silent but it's still going to come to pass I want you to know what a contrast it was when the with Mary you know who when the birth of Jesus said now she didn't know she doesn't question the angel and how can I be sure of this you know how do I know this is true and it offers reasons why it can't happen but you know my wife and I are old and yet he's got examples of Sarah past 90 of Hannah the mother of Samuel other Rebecca who who uh Isaac interceded for and she brought for twins and all these things she got all kinds of examples in the scripture and and Mary did not have one example of ever being a woman who would conceive without knowing a man and and she she didn't ask how can this be true but she but she said how will this happen how will this happen no God doesn't care to answer that question he won't shut you up for asking how will this happen the angel said I'll tell you how it's going to happen the holy spirit will overshadow you you wonder how it's going to happen it happened to you the same way the holy spirit will overshadow you I'm telling you Church get ready for the other Saturday of the Holy Ghost to come after you Shadow to walk in his life because it's not going to come by your ability and maybe even your faith won't produce it but I tell you it'll come by the Holy Ghost because God remembers his promise and it's going to come to pass and it doesn't matter how much unbelief is in this age God's going to do it anyhow how amazing what difference what did Mary do she immediately responded here's the handmaiden of the Lord hear my God if you're going to overshadow me here that's me that ought to be the prayer of every person today when you hear that the Lord is going to overshadow his people in this last day that you ought to say be it unto me according to Thy word Here I Am Lord let this happen to me it's written it's it's written in the word behold the Virgin shall conceive let that word be manifest in my life how amazing it is but so true to life that upright moral church-going people even Minister yep even bride people can be so filled with unbelief so immersed in a secular scientific world view that they are unable to bring themselves to believe that God can work miracles today some can even con construct elaborate theologies to explain why God can't why God won't or why God shouldn't perform a miracle today they'll even prepare sermons oh that which is perfect has come we don't need that you may not need a miracle but I do come on brother Brandon preach the sermon called the paradox paradox is a miracle amen it'll be a paradox a miracle to get a bride and a Rapture but he's going to do it it's going to be a miracle to change your body but God's going to do it it's going to be a miracle to get the bride of Christ all of us collectively believing sometimes you can get this from believing in that one believing but collectively to get us all believing it's going to take a miracle of the holy spirit amen when people begin to take an attitude toward the promise be it unto me according to Thy Word you see God went away went around zechariah's unbelief and said I'm going to do it anyway it's been a delay and you think it's impossible and you've expressed saying how do I know this is true how do I know you're not lying I wonder sometimes how our unbelief flies in the face of God we're living in a Time where the fervent fires of Faith have cooled off even the fires of Azusa Street have died down this Supernatural gospel that brother branovic stole of a pillar of fire of an angel of a Divine gift of a restoration now becomes a forgotten dream God says shut up Zechariah I don't want to hear your unbelief people I wanted people like Mary who says I I don't know how I can do this I don't know a man well it's not going to be you doing it it's going to be me doing it it won't be my man's might or my man's power but it'd be my spirit the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you that's the way it's going to happen Hallelujah the angel appears to Mary 's visitation went a lot different from the old priest because she ready he accepted the word of the angel but that wasn't all the coming of the Angel to Zachariah and and then to marry it set off a chain of events I want to say the time of Silence was now over the time of holding back the promise was now over for now he appears to Joseph in a dream and then the shepherds in the field to wise men and then amazingly seemingly nothing happens for 30 long years I mean think of it the angel comes the messenger speaks the baby John is born the baby Jesus is born Shepherds have come they've given witness and nothing happens for 30 long years you seek in the time of fulfillment there can be times where it seemed like nothing is happening but things are getting into place and I want to just say to you in your times of Silence just realize God is working getting the right things in place the only Glimpse that we even have of God even moving was a glimpse in the life of Jesus at the age of 12 in the temple where he says I must be about my father's business and then he goes back becomes subject to his mom and then suddenly I said then suddenly there comes John out of the wilderness he comes out and preaches his first sermon and then things begin to happen as he begins to preach and people begin to gather and Faith begins to rise and hope comes in the hearts of people and and then enough the space of three and a half years more or less there's actually hundreds of scriptures that are suddenly and rapidly fulfilled you see there there can be in the very time of fulfillment moments where it looks like God went back Asylum again but he isn't even when you don't think it he's working he's getting things in place you know John couldn't go out and preach as a baby he had to wait until he was grown hey Jesus could not wait he could not do it until the age of 30 and then he would go into the minute there was these 30 years of Silence we look like God wasn't moving God wasn't do anything God had did all this miraculous stuff but nothing come of it and all of a sudden there's a voice of one that's crying in the wilderness and then hundreds of scripture start being fulfilled I'm trying to Empire impart upon you today when God starts doing something maybe nothing looks like there's nothing's happening listen you know with Sarah and Abraham if Sarah and them hadn't went down there to um to career and and went there in the abimelech the king see her if we didn't have that story in the Bible we would never know that Sarah had been changed to a young woman but things were happening even though the baby wasn't here yet come on Church I meant things were already taking place there were changes that were happened some of them were subtle changes maybe that didn't happen in a day you want your miracle to happen right now a microwave miracle you want everything right now and God makes you wait for it and John steps into this role of one kind in the wilderness and Isaiah 40 begins to be fulfilled scripture begins to be fulfilled as he prepares the way of the Messiah and suddenly light begins to shine on scripture that was once dormant that it laid in the Bible for hundreds of years and and now a scripture an ancient scripture 500 years before that do you realize how long ago that was that's for America become a nation twice as long and and now a scripture that has been given and it lays dormant all of these years and it says that Malachi of Malachi 3 but oh that's in my messenger before my face and he laid there unlaid there and laid there and laid there and generations hoped and generation believed in generations and it'll be our take and it didn't happen in others it's a hard day it's gonna this man surely he's the one and another and now light comes on it and it's quick suddenly suddenly the Lord you're seeking come to his Temple the messenger of the Covenant whom you desire will come says the Lord Almighty and then the end time from that point on kicked in the full gear come on yeah it was the end time I wanted to say to you you're a million time but there's been many end times it was the beginning of the end of the Old Testament it was the beginning of the New Testament there was an usern out going on and the Nostrand end you know scripture that had been silent and was in obscurity for years suddenly become the life and I say again that in this day we have seen scripture come alive at rapid fulfillment of Prophecy in our day and we can say about much of this word that you have been privileged and blessed are your eyes for they saw them they have seen us come to pass that much of this scripture has now been fulfilled are in the process of being fulfilled it is in this generation that God has done and is doing Mighty things as he winds up all events events that have to do with his coming things that has to be in order this would make men scream out uh 70 years ago saying you know the Bible days are here again it's our restoration they would declare there's a man sent from God this was taken from the scripture uh spoke of John the Baptist in John 1 and 6 there was a man's who sent from God whose name was John and now in the last Church age in the Gentile dispensation as it finishes out once again they declare a man has been sent from God whose name is William Branham he comes like John the Baptist to forerun the second coming of Christ and the pillar of fire was there present in his birth which made it prompted unreligious parents to take him to church as a baby and this boy would then have a voice called from a whirlwind says don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way for I have a work for you to do that nearly 90 years ago now a voice cries out on the Ohio River as John the Baptist would sitable run the first coming of Christ your message will forerun his second coming as it was said of John he will be great in the sight of the Lord he will never take wine or strong drink he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb many of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God and he will go on before the Lord and the spirit and the power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the Disobedience to the wisdom of the righteous to make ready a people prepared for the Lord I want you to know God didn't remember didn't forget you he remembered you he sent Elijah to make ready a people prepared for the Lord God sends you a message of preparation behold I send you a light to the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord and as John turned to Harps of the Orthodox Jewish fathers to the children men such as Peter James and John that this Elijah would turn the hearts of their children to the Pentecostal fathers otherwise others will have to let the curse come I just have to let it all be destroyed because it's going to happen and if we breathe we're now in the phases of the coming of the Lord for the Lord does three things as he descends he does a shout a voice and a trumpet we've arrived at a time where the Lord has descended with the mighty Shout a mighty message it's the presence of Christ in word form and that's been sounded and it continues to sound echo in this day to every corner of the world and now Elijah has come and gone and although men have tried to denominate this message or make it a personality cult this message does not stop progressing it is not stop reaching out into the dark corners of the Earth amen as we speak it still reaches a predestinated seed of God to bring that elect that was foreknown of God before the foundation of the world let me tell you it is a quick short work that is being done as loud as she is the age of the quick work down in Russia over in Ukraine over in China down in cave churches amen over in Japan over in Africa down in Egypt over in Asia you know everywhere the gospel is going out I want you to understand it's the gospel that Paul preached I want you to understand it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ I want you to understand it's the pure and unadulterated word of God I'm tempered by denominations am I not hybrid with men's word the word is going forward to get a bride in this age do you realize where we're at do you realize that we are in right now approaching 2023 so what what does that have to do with it do you realize Ephesian age began in in in 1853 it ends in 170 that's 117 years do you realize 2023 at this age for Max Ephesus do you realize that this age will be as old as the Ephesian Church that's the first the Alpha and Omega churches will now be the same length of time and all you can say as you look around the different ones that put to hear in this building today and those around the world it's been the long suffering of God it's because God had a plan for you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you who wasn't even born then forgot to wait until this time to finish his work to bring you to a place so that where you could be have a part in the predestined plan and God has waited on you all of these years to get here and things to reach in their position so he could finish his work Revelation chapter 4 brother Bradham says this he said you see we got these six days the world is labored in we're up close to this seventh day now and I I want to get the point because here again is another type God created the world in six days on the seventh day he rested we have had now had six days six thousand years upon the Earth of man and the and sin raging reigning upon the Earth and Satan comes to his climax in this last day but then the seventh day will die that seventh day is a day of rest God says the world is going to rest listen we're we're entering into the rest why do you think you received the Holy Ghost it's the rest it is also the sign that you're about that God's about taking his people into arrest you're going to rest from your labors you're going to rest from the hardships you're going to rest from being sick and weary and tired in old age there's a rest coming upon the Earth and you're right here on the cusp of it because the day of sin is about over and he said now it won't run all the way out he said I'll have to cut the word short if I don't the atomic bomb Will Will Destroy All Flesh and here we are in the in the in the church age he says the seventh age a very short one gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil have ever aged stop it for a minute all the evil of every age keeps up into this one you see like a domino effect it has been building it is man it is man increasing increasing things are happening today that would have never been thought of to been done and now here here again the evil of every age where it comes to its height and yet he said if the short work grind this the seventh age a very short age gathers up itself into one quick work all the evil of every age and yet of the reality of Pentecost what's the Philadelphia needs just run its course the laodicea and age quickly comes in bringing both the tares and the wheat to harvest first bind the tares to burn them but gather my wheat into my barn so there's a gathering going on so we have been a we have arrived now at the hour where we are presently witnessing the fulfilling of first Thessalonians 4. God's doing it exactly as he promised Paul believed this was for his age he would declare we with your life and remain God didn't let him see seven churches even when he sows it to John he shows him seven angels and seven Seven Cities but he he don't tell him you know he's going to be seven Gentile ages he didn't he didn't line the whole thing out he didn't want him to be discouraged he wants every age going down believing amen some of you know Paul would believe it for his age but but again but again you know it would be for 2 000 years of a gentile dispensation of seven churches but at the end of time he promised to bring a bride the people who was out without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing a virtuous sinless bride of Christ that he would bring forth of people like that yeah the Saints of other Ages were bribe but but I'm talking about a people who are alive and remain at the Covenant of the Lord a people of that bright age the elect lady who's the Fulfillment and the embodiment of the Divine Promises of God and by the way that vessel that God used single-handedly as the messenger this age now I'm talking about brother Branham he lived on the earth 56 years here in just a few days he will have been gone 57 years he will be gone longer than he was here but I want to say to you the spirit of the of Elijah is still here so how could brother brother Brandon be gone and he was Elijah he was he was not Elijah he was anointed with the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Elijah is Christ amen and the spirit of Christ is here and let me just say to you Elisha is here in the devil portion is not here in a single portion is actually here in a double portion you see this is it it is God's crown and achievement that is coming in of you the marriage of the Lamb a spotless bride dressed in the righteousness of the word of the hour and after thousands of years of delay remember Paul was looking for the Fulfillment of his age he wasn't thinking of us he didn't even know we were to be here amen but he said that including himself we which are alive and remain he believed it was for him but it was hidden for him amen so that's whether for the purpose of election God had you in mind so therefore he delayed this fulfillment for seven churches because he had no more names on the book that had to be manifested on the Earth and God would write all this mysteriously and symbolically it is the Book of Revelation giving us messages to the Seven Cities of Asia that would represent seven churches and here we are today that's the last one and here we are today it's about run out here we are next year it'll be the same it won't be the shortest age it'll be the same age as Ephesians 8. we're here where scripture is now being fulfilled first Thessalonians be fulfilled I want you to understand don't look at the Bible the scripture of the past look at the Bible as scripture of the present this is not a funeral's text it's not just a word of comfort though it's been used out for years and they were instructed to uncomfort one another with these words but I want you to understand it's a prophecy and I also want you to understand you are the object of that prophecy amen where that where that we are now seeing in the hour the Fulfillment of the presence of Christ it's bringing about a bride and bringing the word from book form to Fresh form for the flesh form from prophecy to fulfillment now let's think about it let's think about how the church has drug along now for many years through the Dark Ages yet all the while God has been moving and no age has God forgot his church he's working all along in this Kingdom it would come and Stage us it would advance from its original planting to harvest I'd like you to turn with me to Mark chapter 4 and verse 26 and let's just look at the scripture how Jesus said the kingdom of God would come and remember this is his kingdom so the gospel this is this is the news of his kingdom and so he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and Rise day and night and the seeds will spring up and grow he knoweth not how for the Earth bringeth forth the fruit of yourself first the blade then the ear and after that the full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the Harvest has come so Jesus said this kingdom is going to be like a man planting a seed and then you know when the seed is planted the seed will will actually Decay and out of that will come alive and then that life will come ablade and that blade will not look nothing like the seed so you'll look at that and say that ain't grain that don't look like the seed looks nothing like what I planted and that's the way the church would become it would actually become through the Dark Ages nothing like the original Pentecost it would lose his true baptism it would lose the truth of godhead it would lose the truth of predestination it would lose the original sin and what took place in the garden it would lose all of the truths of the Bible and it would come up as a little puny little green blade Jesus said this is the way my kingdom will come it will progress from seed to seed from grain to grain and in between that would be a time that it looks nothing like the seed I planted but the life will be in it but it will not be the grain but it's going to come to the grain but before it comes to the grain there will come an ear and when it comes from the ear it will move from that to the full ear now I wanted to say to you we are in the day and the hour word that it changes from the grain or the the the cut the ear to the full colored in the ear now you notice Jesus speaks that way again I want to emphasize it the ear and then the full corn in the ear that's what's going to be in the end time that in other words before the full ear comes there's going to be a move of God that will actually look like the grain but it won't be the green it has to come into its fullness and when it reaches its fullness then the Rapture will take place the Harvest Time this is our age it is the Harvest age it is it is when that the church that when the ear first comes and the church begins this that dramatic change from looking nothing like an ear of grain to be coming to ear all of a sudden we start having things happen that looks like it's the real full year and it's the air it's the move of God don't denounce it but it ain't what I'm going to harvest I'm going to wait until the fullness you see I want to get something because it will come in power it will come with anointings it will come with miraculous and with healings it will come in the spirit but not have the word but I'm going to bring it to the full ear and I'm going to restore back the word but with that word it shall come to the full year it's going to have to be both word and spirit it cannot be one or the other it has to be both it cannot be word only it must come in power and great assurance it cannot be a word and no faith it cannot be the word and no manifestations of the spirit of God of healings and miracles of tongues of gifts of signs and wonders it cannot be that the word has to be accompanied with Spirit to be the full ear now brother Branham tells us in the resume of the ages he said now it came to this it came to the ear he said at this age started around the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to be in the bride she was at Pentecost we know there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power and the Believers sensed this in their spirits and they begin to cry to God for new outpouring as such as was in the first century and what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit and it believed that it was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not it wasn't a full year it was a move of God and it was advancement but it wasn't all that God promised and he said the reason for this the lattering can only come after the farmer Ray which is the spring or the teaching rain the latter rain then is the hardest Lane now how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign did not come the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and to Eternal hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come so here we have 1906 and we have the move of the spirit and they think it's a long-awaited restoration and yet God is restoring but it isn't for restoration and he said they're calling it the latter rain and he said how can it be the latter Ray was the former Reign the early rain has not happened because you see it would take a profit to come somebody with me Amen to teach the people to turn our hearts back to the original Faith again Hallelujah now that's what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening the Rapture had not come it was a mixture of the unrighteous I want you to watch this it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we kept pointing out to you it was also devil power as men were under control the devils and no one seemed to realize it and then to prove it was not real these people even before the second generation had appeared and organ they organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of this of them did and brother Bradham called this fungus on the air and I just want to say when we look back and we point fingers at Azusa Street and we look at the mistakes that they made I just want to say we've not been squeaky clean either we've had our share of fungus there have been men preachers another message under the control of devil power who organized and made personality calls there have been adulterers in the pulpit polygamist who took the very words of the prophet of God to try and and and use it for their own lustful purpose there have been homosexuals and adulterers in the pulpit there have been personality Cults that have built their fences and organized so tightly around true such as Thunder or the perus of the presence or the return Ministry of the tape only cult all of these have risen up Focus on the ear the Pentecostal denominations was the fungus on the ear organizing over initial evidence among other things that was fungus that was not the ear I want to go back for a moment I want you to understand you've got to look at the difference you're looking at the seed and you're looking at the ear and you're seeing the fungus I want you to see the fungus was not the ear the Pentecostal organization was the fungus it was not the ear and when you're looking at back there you know sometimes all you see is the wrong I want you to see Godless moving and God was remembering and God Was preparing I want you to begin to see it as a move of God not just as a move of the devil yeah there was fungus on the air yeah they organized over initial evidence among other things but you know the leaders of the Zeus of movement they understood this too FF Bosworth do you know brother Bosworth he was an early Azusa Street revivalist and he debated at the Assembly of God conference at Thomas was not the evidence do you know the that man got thrown out of the organization because of it there were men of God that was right there through Pentecostals who was standing for the truth and calling it what it was you know that was William Seymour that said now don't go from this meeting he even William Seymour was uh was the man the pastor of Azusa Mission there and he said don't go from this meeting and talk about tongues but try to get people saved he counseled them against all in believing and fleshly demonstration everything was that was not truly of the spirit there were there very leaders recognized this is fungus this is wrong and they cried out against it brother Seymour constantly exalted the atoning work of Christ the word of God and very earnestly he insisted on thorough conversion Holiness of heart and life and the fullness of the spirit another leader of theirs sabji Lake you know he would talk about the same thing and I quoted this to you before but John G Lake was called the Apostle of South Africa he was a man who was sent out by the Holy Spirit from Azusa Street to take the gospel over to South Africa and he said that marvelous wave of God came over the country from 1900 to 1906 with hundreds of thousands of people were baptized in the Holy Ghost and spoke in tongues but listen oh John Alexander Riot doubly he he writing on the wave of that wonderful manifestation of healing power he wanted to build a church and stamp it with healing only and his church practically did that and died and other churches branded theirs with Holiness only and they died he's talking about Pilgrim Holiness nazarenes all of them they died others with an anointing of the Holy Ghost called baptism they died in power also later on we wanted to build a great structure and step it with tongues and after a while tongues got dry somehow the glory and the glow had gone out of them they become raply and did not sound right what was the matter nothing was wrong with the experience God had not departed from the life but was hidden from our view and we were absorbed in the phenomenon of God and not God himself but don't be against Pentecost I wanted to say it is the experience you must have without the Dynamics of Pentecost the Holy Ghost you will not go in the rapture brother Madam told us and the message took it he promised Malachi for he would do this and manifest his word to turn the hearts of their children back to the fathers back to the original Pentecostal word the real Bible word the Pentecostal they claimed Pentecostals organization there's no such a thing Pentecost is an experience not an organization they tried to organize it but you can't it doesn't organize Pentecost is an experience listen it is the Seal of God the holy spirit that came on the day of Pentecost notice what he said it's not an organization it is an experience and it is the Seal of God that came on the day of Pentecost brother Branham tells us in Jehovah Jireh he said I know they say Pentecost they organize Pentecost that's wrong Pentecost is an experience the methodists get it the Baptists get it all of them get it Pentecost is not organized it's an experience and if you hadn't received the experience of Pentecost come receive it now remember if you believe me to be his servant as Prophet remember there is a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost right in the midst of all the fanaticism there is still a genuine Holy Ghost birth a genuine born of God and he said you come believe it now but nevertheless though the ensusa movement was not the long-awaited restoration it was so close it was so close Jesus said it would come and bring the ear and then the foliar I want you to get it a stage where you would have both the ear and the Folia watch now this Souza Street movement was not dealing with long-awaited restoration but was so close it looked so much like the greens that the prophet of God over and over through the 50s the early 60s brother Bradham taught he actually thought that what happened on Azusa Street was the original Green he actually taught this is a seed it's the original Green again it was so close I mean you know people in this message don't want to be nothing like Azusa Street but let me tell you again it was so close to being the real thing that brother Branham said over and over again I know I've got collections of growth he said over and over again that the Pentecostal movement of this day was the original Grace and he would come later and said it's so close it would have deceived the elect if it were possible that's how close it would come so at first he declared fervently and passionately and asserted that the Azusa Revival was the return to the original it was not and if you become a message student you'll learn it was not until the seals was open that he realized it was not the grain but the shock it was still a part that we planned it was indeed a move of God it even had elements of restoration and it had Dynamics but it lacked the mechanics it lacked the word being revealed the Holy Ghost was falling upon these people that he is saying his original grain and they're trinitarians they're baptizing and father Son and Holy Ghost they've got every all kinds of truths wrong they're trying to build a denomination out of it they do and yet brother Branham is looking at it and he's declaring that's the grave that's the grain that's the grain it's the original grave it may have some fungus on it but it's the grain I know that's shocking to a lot of people but the grain would not just be the Dynamics of the spirit movement I want I want to get to I want you to understand the spirit moving onto Azusa Street was the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was moving that was the power of God it was a demonstration of the things that had happened in the book of Acts were now happening again but they lacked the word now they lacked the original doctrines that Paul preached now let me just say if it's all mechanics word and no Dynamics it's not the foliar either if it's all Dynamics and not the fullness of the word it's not the full ear either the only way to be the full ear is to have mechanics and Dynamics word and spirit your religion without emotion is dead but remember I want you to know though it'll look like the whole the the grain until brother Branham called it the grain all the way past the seal when he when he finally realizes what he's looking at is not the grain after all it's not the full ear and he says like I said I know this I've thoroughly researched it he said the Azusa Street was so much like the grain he said it is the grain let me just read this from master from the Masterpiece the stock doesn't look like the seed neither does a tonsil now Pentecostal Brethren throughout the nation I want you to listen if this is the last message I'll ever preach this is my masterpiece do you realize when the wheat the corner wheat falls on the ground when it begins to form back to its green again what's nature nature exactly is God God's working in nature is all he can but from that original Revival Pentacles Revival they think was a seed it wasn't now watch something came forth just like the seed now watch Jesus said in Saint Matthew 24 24 that two spirits in the last day would be so close together it would deceive the elected if possible now stop don't look nothing like a seed neither does a tassel look like a seed but notice nod in Luther's day but in the last day the first day there's a Farmers wheat Farmers sitting here the first thing comes from a wheat seed you would think is what it was the seed but what it's it's the husk it forms a little outside thing to hold the seed it forms a husk but the husk is not the sea no more than that tousle that this stock was it's only a carrier of the light the corn of wheat see then Saint John 12 see Jesus speaking the the wheat out to the tassel at the Wesley puts forth the husk which is the foremost like the grain than anything else the husk is more like the grain it's coming more like the green all the time the one that went into the ground but when it and when it comes forth the stock has got the life in it but sure it isn't the green comes forth the tassel the pollen still isn't the Grain and then it comes forth the husk it is in the sheep of the wheat just exactly like a grain of wheat but yet it isn't to eat just exactly in the same shape perfectly Pentecostals come out just like the wheatwood each one coming out the other coming out of the other but they're only a carrier they go into denomination and what did Pentecostals do when it come out just like the grain it went back like in Revelation 17 to one of the sister denominations that's exactly what what Jesus said now what's the gospel is going to come out through Luther through Wesley in the Pentecost in the last days it'll see the very elected if possible the elected old Pentecostal Brethren can't you see it the wheat in its first beginning is just like the sea when it begins to form like the sea but it's the husk watch now Azusa Street was just like the seed but it was the husk notice the life he said he said the grain seed in the original fell at nicaea if it was the first denomination now here the light was in the stock that tassel all ends up in the sea the light that comes out of the original Sea comes through the different processes three different processes then turns back to its original condition he said hallelujah oh my I'm the happiest person in the world that God has let me see this he saw that there was something that was more pure devil Souza Street that it would have more than just spirit but it would have the word to accompany the spirit and become the full year of Grace hold on now this is the street movement was not a full year let me just say this neither is a lot of this stuff we call message Pentecost is not a denomination Pentecost is an experience you must have remember Pentecost is an experience it's the Seal of God we've done been through that and brother Branham tells us Pentecost is the only thing that was going to prove Christianity you can't prove it by silence you can't prove it by nothing but a Pentecostal experience I want just to say though they're they're uh though their Doctrine was wrong the experience was right it was the Holy Ghost movie it was the spirit of God let me just say to you the New Testament is not a record of what happened in one generation is the blueprint of what should happen in every generation until Jesus comes every generation must be regenerated by the Holy Ghost let's look at this for a moment brother Bradham tells us the church that was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern they didn't just have the word they had the spirit they didn't just have the spirit they had the word somebody helped me preach they had the original Gospel of Jesus Christ plus the Holy Spirit amen they did not have mechanics and no Dynamics they had Dynamics and mechanics they had it all now again I want you to understand we are in the apostolic age as long as God is still calling the apostolic age is still on so you just as much as an Apostolic age as it were in on the day of Pentecost where God is now fulfilling his word just like he promised you know because this this is what brother Brandon said until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease so you can know that we are in an Apostolic age we're an Apostolic fulfillment because God will not forget his promise he will consummate the outpouring of the Holy Spirit now brother Madam tells us he said now what Satan did he got in it to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics or back all Dynamics and no mechanics we've got to have it together so Satan will get in the church here's where the fungus comes I want you to get it clear here's where the fungus go to make it all Dynamics and no mechanics in the word are all word and no spirit and both of them are the fungus on the planet and they distort the seed to make it look like nothing like the original because of how the word without Spirit you don't look like the original to have the spirit without the word you don't look like the original but God promised he's going to bring it back to his original planting amen because God does not forget remember the Dynamics is the holy spirit Paul would say Our Gospel didn't come to you in word only but in power and in Holy Ghost and in much assurance and when you have a church when you have a movement when you have a group of people that they're all aware and no Spirit are all spirit and no word you have a you have a people who are full of fungus great now it'll take the Dynamics and I I don't have time to go on it but I just want you to understand I want you to understand something God is not through pouring out his spirit he has started it in the first day I mean the first of this age laodicea and he's going to bring it all the way into fruition amen come on he has not quit calling and the promises unto you to your children as many as the Lord thy God shall call and as long as God's calling the apostolic age is still in and the full year will have both power and word they will not be void of the spirit of God not bullied on the word of God now let's get this clear what the church will be because I just want to say how come how come has the church now backslid into the Campbell light Alexander dowie Church of Christ mentality and thinking saying like they did because they said we now we now we have the perfect Canon of the New Testament it's all it's all available the Bible is complete that which is perfect has come and it's a more perfect way so God does not heal anymore God does not deliver anymore God does not do any of these things anymore it's all over with you know Miracles are ceased because we now have the perfect word but I want to assert the perfect word brings the power the perfect word brings Deliverance the more perfect way has signs and wonders and faith and gifts of the Spirit and the power of God and you can have a perfect way and a full year and not have it now brother Brandon said about them early Pentecostals that he thought was Green or the full ear he said if you took a microscope I wanted to say that's a prophetic guy that's a microscope he said you would see there was a little tiny grain so you go all the way back to Azusa Street and you put the prophetic eye on it you see more than just husk you see a little tiny immature grain starting there because they would get the spirit without having the word returned or restored but God said I'm gonna remember my promise I hadn't forgot it I'm going to bring forth for the bride who will have the fullness of the word who the Mysteries will be revealed to who will understand what the Thunder said somebody help me preach about who the mysteries of God had been manifest to who baptized right who understand they were chosen before the foundation of the world who preach the gospel that Paul preached and they also have the power of the Apostles thank you way back under the microscope you can see a little bud then comes the grain the seed not air with the shuck he said when sanctification moved over the pilgrim Holiness and so forth all the pilgrim Holiness organizations nazarenes and so forth it moved from there right out in this Pentecostal age and look at that little grain now of wheat it looks a million times more like the original wheat wait a minute Azusa Street looked a million times more like it like the grain than the methodists then the Baptists million times more like the original wheat that went to the ground than the stock did or the pollen did but if you sit down and you pull it put it under glass and you open up these little Chucks they're just carriers also the grain hadn't started yet it's a little bitty Bud oil right in the back with the big high-powered glass you can see that little tip like a little like a pinpoint and then comes the sea and then then here this here shop that looks just exactly like the real thing it isn't the real thing it's only a womb foreign I just want to say don't hate your mother don't look like come on don't despise your mother she was the womb you were to be born out of out of the womb of the Azusa movement came a prophet out of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit came the word revealed now those are early Pentecostals they believed that the Lord healed today just as abode and many of them had marvelous healings themselves they were one and all they were eagerly looking for the Covenant of the Lord they were every one of them honored the word of God believing in every part of it they were seeking not the not to be just hearers of the word that wanted to be doers of the word they believed that indeed they were now living in the last days and and they would quote the scripture of Joel it should come to pass in the last days say of God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and the Lord Jesus himself had exalted at the right hand of the father was the one who had set forth this light that you now see and hear they believed that God was pouring out his spirit we ought to believe that to be the true come on we ought to believe God is pouring out his spirit and we must have his Spirit we cannot be dissatisfied with having the message and City backslow you know smugly and so well we've got all of the word and we've got all the message and you have no spirit in those days there were Baptist Methodist Presbyterian congregationalist Episcopalian Holiness people Christians from every denomination from nor from no denomination who had received the experience these Spirit-filled ones were made very much of the precious blood of Jesus and that the Cross of Christ had been made real to them to the power of the Holy Ghost they believed that the Lord healed today just as of old many of them had marvelous healings that looked for his coming they expected it God started pouring out his spirit in 1906. I said I want to say at the Turning of the century you'll find out in 1900 God began to pour out his Spirit it actually would begin at Topeka Kansas as the day dawned in that early day of January the 1st 1900 in Topeka Kansas there was a group of people that were gathered together studying the scripture and they were looking at when you and they were saying we want to be like the book of Acts we want to see the power of God we must have the experience that they had on the day of Pentecost they were hungry they were thirsted they were calling on God and they were studying the scripture earnestly to see that there would be an outpouring of the Holy Ghost for they their day and time and they were believing you know that it was it's our day it's our time it's our hour for this to happen let's talk about the shelter moment that husk that looks so much like the gray I want to get it back to you it looks so much like the real till brother Branham called it the real I want you to understand that move of God looked like the grain let me reverse it then this move of God the grain has to look like that within that Chuck prophetic eye looked upon it discerned this little bird of Grace coming up there it wasn't mature it was still in its infancy still had trinitarian views it still was confused on a lot of truths the seals hadn't been taken off the book it was more Dynamics than it was doctrinal word they made doctrinal word out of things that wasn't even scriptural and the shock but out of that shock or that chuck would be come the womb that the grain would be born out of but God had remembered his promise and his promise I want you to get it God remembers and he remembers his promise that says in the last days I'm going to pour out my spirit Acts 2 17 it's come to pass in that day saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy this is what happens when God pours out of the spirit that prophesied young men see visions all men dream dreams all my servants my handmaids I'm pour out my spirits in those days and they shall prophesy and I shall show wonders in heavens above and signs of the earth beneath Isaiah would prophesy these are scriptures that have to be fulfilled and anointed in our day for he said in Isaiah 28 11 for his stampered lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherein you may cause the weary to rest and this isn't refreshing yet they would not hear and by the way like I said it didn't even started Azusa Street that's where it received notoriety but that's not where it started it started in Topeka Kansas six years before that January the first first day of the year of the new century something began to happen a young girl named Agnes in Topeka Kansas was one of the first to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost she testified that it was 11 o'clock on this first of January that it came in her heart she'd been studying in the Bible with all the other students in a b Simpson School and she saw there that many times the Holy Ghost would come when someone was laid on with hands and Handler she asked she asked that hands would be laid on her and and uploading her head whether they'd laid their hands and and they were just they're just saying God you know just do what you said and fulfill your promise and you know and said his hands was laid upon her head the Holy Spirit began to fall upon her and she began glorifying God she spoke in several languages that day and you know it was she said it was those rivers of Living Water were proceeding from my innermost being and I wanted to say these Living Waters were not gibberish they were not manufactured hey you know there was nobody jiggling her chin saying Jesus Jesus to she had a confusion of language these were real in fact they were so real the next day she prayed for a man in English and then began to speak in tongues again and the man was from Bohemia the western part of what is now Czech Republic and she spoke his language and he he understood what she said so you see what happened there was not a confusion of tongues it was not unknown tongues it was not gibberish it was languages amen now news of this outpouring began to be heard everywhere and from there it spread from Kansas and the news that God was pouring out his Spirit it reached a reached down to a Bible school that held down in Houston Texas there was a man that was sitting out in the hallway you know he was a black man this was a white school laws were there where they wouldn't let this black man mixed with the whites so he's sitting out in the hallway listening and something strikes his heart when he hears about the holy spirit being poured out like on the day of Pentecost and this man begins to seek for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and begin to preach you know that this can happen in our day and this is the word of the Lord and this is what happened then we can see Bible days again and we can add the book of Acts working Upon Us by the way when is this made this if this tree ever puts forth another Branch what kind of Branch would it put out amen another book of Acts somebody help me preach that's what's promised when God remembers I'm going to bring it to fruition look what he said look what he happens you know again he began to be convinced this is that I haven't received it I don't know how it feels but I believe that and he began to pray for it and he began to preach that and and you know somebody uh there are many men there and said you know there's a church and Los Angeles California that is looking for a pastor and and so again he packed up and he moved all the way to Los Angeles feeling it was the call of God he got up and he preached just what we're talking about you know I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh they spoke with other tongues we can have what they had in the book of Acts this Disturbed that church so much they locked the doors on him and turned him out a Baptist couple invited him to come to a prayer meeting in their home and they began to pray for an outpouring of the holy spirit this was on 214 North Bonnie Bray Street and here people begin to gather and they begin to pray they begin to ask God for now pouring look Lord look you know again you promised to come you promised that you would reveal yourself you said you would pour out your spirit I want that Holy Spirit and they were calling out to God for it and God remembered his promise and things begin to happen it would actually be on you know there that Miracles were taking place healings and miracles and things happening but yet you know at the same time of these Miracles happening uh they still did not received that outpouring that they were looking for so they were still calling out to God on April the 9th 1906 Seymour was about to leave for a prayer meeting because they had to leave the house on Bonnie Bray and move over to an old barn on Azusa Street and and there in this old barn they were meeting for a prayer meeting because there's so many people had become and there there was a man by the name of Edward Lee he walked out and he asked for prayer to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost said he had heard preached about it had never happened there Seymour had never received it you know it had not broke out yet but at the meeting you know when when he uh when he asked for that he prayed for him laid hands on him and Lee suddenly began to give glory to God in other tongues as at the meeting that night this surprise Seymour you know he he was so surprised by then he told what had happened time of earnest prayer broke out at the end of the meeting seven people we're now speaking in other tongues other languages languages they had never studied one woman a maid who worked at a home across the street she had come to the prayer meeting she she uh went to the piano so moved by the spirit and began to play you know beautifully never having a lesson in her life her gift proved to be permanent it never left her hey man you know and then from there there were great men that rose up in the power of the spirit men like Charles price John G Lake F Bosworth Smith Wigglesworth I want you to understand these were men of God this was a move of God this was the Dynamics this was the Holy Ghost falling amen the word hadn't come but the power of it was already falling I want you to get it God was remembering his promise I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and their people now responding men would rise up it was spark of faith in their heart that would believe in God doing the impossible let me tell you one day there was this 15 year old boy his name was Kenneth Ware one of your kitten folks from there Kenneth Ware Was Heard down the street he heard a man's voice ring out come here boy put out your tongue he'd never seen the man before this man had never even introduced himself Kenneth didn't have the nerve to run off he did what the man ordered real one reason he couldn't say a word because he knew if he tried he'd only stutter his speech impediment had such a serious drawback to him as long as long as he could remember but before he knew what happened what had happened this audacious man reached out and grabbed his tongue and he said lad this tongue will preach the gospel and then he walked away from that moment forward Kenneth never stuttered again he preached his first sermon at age 17 became a lifelong missionary especially to the Jewish refugees in France and that stranger who had stopped him on the street was none other than the Bold British evangelist Smith Wigglesworth I'm trying to tell you I'm trying to tell you it looked like the grain I'm trying to tell you life was in it and that life was the Holy Ghost I'm trying to tell you it had Dynamics in it amen they didn't have the mechanics yet but the Dynamics was already there God was already moving Smith Wigglesworth I mean I know we got great things that we could Acclaim about the prophet of this day but I want to just save Smith Wigglesworth he was stand with an assistant to to him as us he was staying in a home that was an assistant priest and this this man had had amputation of both legs below the knee in those days Prosthetics was weren't available to help people like that and after dinner Wiggles words Smith Wigglesworth blurted out to the men go and get a new pair of shoes in the morning is this a kind of a cruel joke what was it he hardly knew how to take this directive but during the night he sensed that God was saying something to him he could get no sleep the rest of the night the next morning found him in his wheelchair in front of the shoe shop when the shoe shop all opened he rolled in and said to the clerk would you get me a pair of shoes and the clerk said well what color what what size what color and then he looked down and saw no feet and he said sir I can't help you he said it's all right young man so just just I do want a pair of shoes I want size eight and I want color black well the clerk couldn't think of what else to do so he just went and got the requested juice and when he returned the this man stuck out one foot for the shoe to be put on and a leg grew out of that stump with a foot and the next thing you know he stuck out the other leg and out of that leg grew another foot and it went out wearing a size eight black pair of shoes because a man of God was operating as they did in the book of Acts because God hath not forgot his promise and God was doing the impossible hallelujah amen while Smith Wigglesworth wasn't surprised at all he said God could God can you know if God can heal a bone and put it back together God can make new feet listen it is Promised by the spoken word in this day under the Seven Seals the prophet of God said we are looking for the time we're missing limbs will be restored again again I'm here to tell you that Dynamics is not over the Dynamics has not stopped and the Dynamics will never stop in fact for the matter you can expect it more because we are now in the full year we are now in the full year it's not husk anymore Dynamics and no word neither is it some kind of stop with well you know theories and words and doctrines and no power and I want you to know that God began doing that because God remembered during Smith Wigglesworth Ministry 14. different people were raised from the dead I'm telling you this is what happened in our generation I'm telling you this is what happens when the Holy Spirit overshadows I'm telling you you are in the day of the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit I'm telling you God has not stopped doing his work but God has now just begun his work we are now in the harvest season and that means there is a mature bride a mature grain coming into view amen I'm telling you this morning don't expect Less in the coming year I'm telling you we're winding up the age Hallelujah and as they say is the fullness of Pentecost again the book of Acts restores of people with the word and the power and I'm telling you I'm telling you you need to be a people just exactly like they were crying out to God on the outside that day when the angel appeared a people under expectancy of people under who are believing a people who are looking for that Sudden Change because I want you to understand suddenly suddenly suddenly brother Ron tells about a man suddenly an angel suddenly coming into his room laying sitting down on his bed putting his hand on his leg God let him know you're not in this alone when my wife was passing away suddenly one morning an angel walked into the room a brother Derek Paris a man who don't make things up holding an official document and saying Karen Pruitt it is this is to certify that Karen Pruitt has been ushered to the other side because God don't forget I don't have permission to tell this just one of my fellow ministers the other day wrote me he said brother to me said something tremendous has happened he said I was here in a meeting he's a young man he's a young man you know that that the Holy Spirit has moved on before but he said I was getting ready for a meeting I was sitting in the study and suddenly a whirlwind came in my room and a being sat down in a chair right beside me and that presence of God so overwhelmed me I went out and preached with such Authority and power and now sick has been healed and people were delivered of every kind of thing and I want you to know suddenly it may be when you're offering the the prayer today that the angel will show up that suddenly things will change I am telling you as your pastor is your brother get ready for sudden changes in a moment of discouragement in a moment where that you know where things were happening that he didn't want to even happen suddenly the angel of God stepped into an old cabin and met with a man who would become a prophet of God and tell him from here on from here on you are gifted and I'm sending you out with signs and he said it's because the near coming the coming of the Lord is near oh but I was 76 77 years ago oh but that was a long time ago oh but seemed like there's been nothing happening oh but everybody's given up oh we just settled down and think the message just turned into another organization we had headquarters in Jeffersonville and everybody just sits down and does what the prophet says or the headquarters says oh we're just going to have an Israel you'll stand in another denomination it won't I want to tell you Seven Angels Came From Another Dimension to bring the opening of The Seven Seals because God had wrote it in his book and he swore by him that liveth forever and ever that there all won't always be a delay that time shall be no more that the delay will one day be over and I'm here to tell you we are here where things are rapidly happening and I'm here to say don't give up on your promise I'm here to say how it will be the holy spirit will overshadow you what are you going to say what are you going to say can you bow your heads what will you say what will be your response God you're lying how can I know this is true this is impossible can't never happen with me what are you going to say are you going to say behold the handmaiden of the Lord you said it would happen pour out your spirit on me God you're remembering your promise and before I uh before I honor any more unbelief shut my mouth but Lord let mine be a profession of faith be it to me now according to that word Lord we have the message we have the truth evening light Tabernacle you're not behind on any truths Thunders we know what they are seals we know what those symbols have been revealed seventh seal the Silence has been broken the mysteries of God we know the right baptism so I got the word down brother Tim maybe what you needs the power come on how long are you going to sulk in your tent how long are you going to look at the promise and scoff in life and just say I can't ever happen you know it's never never going to happen to me it can't be mine how long you're going to sit back there in your doldrums when the angel of God has shown himself present God's given you words he's promised you children he's promised you healings he's promised you Deliverance what are you going to say to it he promised you salvation today how long are you going to sit there in your little dorms and you're a little bit of unbelief and dope a little and smoke a little drink a little lie a little cuss a little or a lot how long are you not going to exemplify a Christian Life foreign how long you're going to just put off the Holy Ghost for you and for your promise is your prayer matching the last of the Book of Revelation are you in agreement with this coming behold I come quickly he came on Azusa Street he came into Topeka Kansas he came when an angel came in 1933 on the Ohio River he came again 1946 he
