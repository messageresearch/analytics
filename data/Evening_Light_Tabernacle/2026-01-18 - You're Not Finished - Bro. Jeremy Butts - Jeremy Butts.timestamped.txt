[0:13] And when I feel like I can't make it.
[0:17] When my world's falling apart,
[0:22] when I feel forgotten
[0:24] alone with a broken heart.
[0:29] When I question every promise
[0:33] and doubted every prayer,
[0:37] it's in the silence.
[0:39] Somehow I know you're there.
[0:45] I almost let go.
[0:48] Then you told me the truth that you're
[0:52] not finished.
[0:55] That you're not done.
[0:58] You made me a promise that I would
[1:02] overcome.
[1:05] You speak to my valley.
[1:09] They answer to you
[1:13] and every mountain in my ways
[1:17] you move.
[1:20] Cuz you're nothing finished.
[1:27] You're nothing.
[1:33] And even in my weakness,
[1:38] you still have a plan.
[1:41] When I'm in the darkness,
[1:44] you reveal your hand.
[1:48] than what was meant for evil.
[1:52] You turn it for my good. You give
[1:56] beautiful ashes just like you said you
[2:00] would.
[2:03] When I want to let go,
[2:06] I remember your true not finished,
[2:13] that you're not done.
[2:16] You made me a promise that I would
[2:20] overcome.
[2:23] You speak to my valley.
[2:26] They answer you
[2:30] and every mountain in my way. You said
[2:35] you move
[2:37] cuz you're not finished.
[2:44] And you're not witness.
[2:51] You're with me in the shadows
[2:54] through every fear I battle.
[2:58] You never turn away. You never stop
[3:02] calling my name.
[3:05] Breathe on what's been broken.
[3:09] Restore what was stolen. Speak to my
[3:12] storm and your voice. It calls the
[3:16] crashing away
[3:20] cuz you're not finished
[3:24] and you're not done.
[3:27] You made me a promise that I would
[3:31] overcome.
[3:34] You speak to my valleys.
[3:38] They answered you
[3:41] in every mountain in my way. You said
[3:45] you move.
[3:48] Cuz you're not finished.
[3:52] Cuz you're not done.
[3:55] You made me a promise that I would
[3:59] overcome.
[4:02] You speak to my valley.
[4:06] answer to you
[4:09] and every mountain in my way say
[4:16] you're not finished.
[4:23] You're not finished.
