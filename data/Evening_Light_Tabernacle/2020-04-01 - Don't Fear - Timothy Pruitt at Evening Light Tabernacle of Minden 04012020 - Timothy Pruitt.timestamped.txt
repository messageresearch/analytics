[22:10] we just praise you thank you in Jesus
[22:14] name we ask these things hey man let's
[22:19] turn to John chapter 14
[22:21] hey man John chapter 14 and verse 1 I'm
[22:25] gonna be going through quite a bit of
[22:27] Scripture so you don't have to keep up
[22:30] with me tonight John chapter 14 and
[22:32] verse 1 it says let not your heart be
[22:35] troubled you believe in God believe also
[22:38] in me
[22:38] in my father's house are many mansions
[22:41] if it were not so I would have told you
[22:44] I go to prepare a place for you and if I
[22:49] go and prepare a place for you I will
[22:52] come again and receive you unto myself
[22:54] that where I am there ye may be also oh
[22:59] what a wonderful time that'll be and
[23:02] whether I go you know and the way you
[23:04] know also on down to verse 25 he says
[23:07] these things have I spoken unto you
[23:10] being yet present with you but the
[23:13] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[23:16] the father was sinned in my name he
[23:18] shall teach you all things and bring all
[23:21] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[23:25] have said unto you peace
[23:28] I'll leave with you my peace I give unto
[23:31] you not as the world giveth give I unto
[23:34] you but let not your heart be troubled
[23:37] neither let it be afraid Amen we can let
[23:41] you be seated
[23:44] and I just like to speak on this on
[23:47] don't fear don't fear I was looking at
[23:51] these words of trouble and afraid to in
[23:54] this scripture reading in this trouble
[23:56] means to agitate or to cause an inward
[24:00] commotion to take away the calmness of
[24:03] mind or to disturb your equanimity to
[24:07] disquiet to make Restless to stir up to
[24:11] trouble to strike one spirit with fear
[24:14] and dread to render one anxious or
[24:17] distressed to perplex the mind of one by
[24:21] suggesting scruples or doubt and also
[24:25] afraid to be not afraid he says also to
[24:28] be timid or fearful now we know fear at
[24:32] one time it was a time that fear did not
[24:34] exist it was a time that the word fear
[24:37] did not exist it was not in the
[24:39] vocabulary manner and the thoughts of
[24:41] man and I believe we're going back to a
[24:43] time where that fear once again won't
[24:45] exist but we're in a time that's in the
[24:48] world that whether it's a good time or
[24:50] having a good time or a bad time fear
[24:53] exists and certain things in certain
[24:55] realms and in certain degrees there's
[24:57] always been fear since the time has
[25:00] started now here on the earth and time
[25:02] has been kept here on the earth and
[25:04] there's very many different kind of
[25:06] fears there's there's very many
[25:08] different degrees of fear and but it's a
[25:11] spirit that comes in and tries to attach
[25:14] to a maybe a hurt or are some events or
[25:18] something that took place in a person's
[25:20] life and and a spirit tries to attach
[25:23] therein to cause them to be afraid and
[25:25] to be some something to be almost
[25:28] incapacitated by the fear or the
[25:30] incapable of even moving or incapable of
[25:34] operating in a normal way because of
[25:36] fear now there's many different recorded
[25:39] fears
[25:40] many different and we'll go through
[25:41] these very quickly because Muammar very
[25:45] humorous but they've been recorded and
[25:47] actually treated as a fear that people
[25:49] have have to have to cover having their
[25:53] lives and and it go there's there's fear
[25:56] of darkness there's fear of heights
[25:57] there's fear of flying there's fear of
[26:00] pain there's fear of open spaces there's
[26:02] fear of needles and pointed objects
[26:05] there's fear of riding in a car there's
[26:07] fear of men there's fear of choking
[26:09] there's fear of flowers there's my
[26:12] goodness there's fear of people or
[26:14] society there's fear of being touched
[26:16] there's fear of peanut butter there's
[26:18] fear of spiders there's fear of numbers
[26:21] there's fear of thunder and lightning
[26:22] there's fear of disorder and untied enos
[26:26] there's fear of imperfection there's
[26:28] fear of failure there's fear of
[26:30] human-like figures can you imagine that
[26:33] there's fear of being alone there's fear
[26:36] of bacteria there's fear of gravity
[26:38] there's fear of stairs or steep slopes
[26:40] there's fear of amphibians or fear of
[26:43] books there's fear of plants there's
[26:45] fear of ungodliness yeah there is fear
[26:48] of being ridiculous or ridicule there's
[26:51] fear of mirrors for your snow there's
[26:54] fear of colors there's fear of clocks
[26:56] there's fear of time there's fear of
[26:58] confined spaces there's fear of clowns
[27:00] there's fear of computers there's fear
[27:02] of dog let's just down those numbers
[27:03] that to see in the alphabetical order
[27:06] and on down to fear at home there's fear
[27:09] of cats there's fear of insects there's
[27:11] fear of teenagers there's fear of horses
[27:13] there's fear of marriage there's fear of
[27:15] knees there's there's fear of speaking
[27:17] in public there's fear of women I'm sure
[27:19] there's fear of men there's fear of
[27:21] touch there's fear son there's fear of
[27:23] blood so Satan has found all kind of
[27:26] ways to attach himself to whatever kind
[27:28] of fear that is out there what I mean
[27:31] there's and there's no doubt of fear of
[27:33] up you they a fear of organs a fear of P
[27:36] and a fear of all there's all kinds of
[27:38] fear and Satan is there to try to anoint
[27:41] those things and it calls you to become
[27:44] incapacitate or to a place of in mobile
[27:47] or on the abundant
[27:48] ability to think properly or to operate
[27:51] properly and so properly so he's always
[27:53] trying to attack with fear and and
[27:56] Brandon would speak of fear many times
[27:58] and he would he would go down through
[28:00] the things that he said the worst thing
[28:03] the worst thing that devil can put upon
[28:06] you is fear and and and I like I said we
[28:11] going down to will V and through Z
[28:13] there's fear beautiful women there's
[28:16] fear of germs there's fear of witches
[28:18] there's fear of strangers and there's
[28:20] fear of animals there's all kinds of
[28:22] fear that have been labeled or I've been
[28:25] treated there's actually one in here I
[28:27] don't know how somebody gets treated for
[28:28] this because it's a fear of doctors but
[28:31] anyway there's all kinds of fears but
[28:33] the worst thing the devil can put on you
[28:35] is fear and then it's time that we're
[28:37] living in and especially when we get
[28:39] along and we're in our a long time right
[28:42] now and our social distancing as they
[28:44] put it new words that we're learning in
[28:46] this age that we're living in he comes
[28:49] in those times and it really attacks our
[28:52] mind he he tries to suggest things and
[28:55] it seems like then in the time that
[28:56] we're living in sicknesses everywhere
[29:00] coronaviruses everywhere cancer is
[29:02] everywhere every kind of spirit that our
[29:04] darkness is everywhere but don't forget
[29:06] the promises of God are still the same
[29:09] don't forget that as healing is still
[29:12] here there's this there's still just as
[29:14] much healing if not more taking place
[29:16] now than there ever was a man just
[29:19] because all you here's the bad news
[29:21] don't mean there's not good news there
[29:23] is good news because God is still on the
[29:25] throne he's still moving in hearts of
[29:28] his men as well brothers and sisters of
[29:30] his children he's still moving in ways
[29:32] that seems unfathomable and unbelievable
[29:35] he's still Duero worker he's still
[29:38] annoyed maker it don't matter what he's
[29:40] what things are saying or what's going
[29:42] on around us he is still God and if he's
[29:46] still God he's got the answer for every
[29:49] one of these fears that they can list a
[29:51] man and so I believe tonight that no
[29:53] matter what takes place he is our refuge
[29:57] and when we come to him
[29:59] we can let off the pressure hey man
[30:01] where the round speaks about that and
[30:03] letting off the pressure you know we can
[30:05] quit worrying about it you know you can
[30:08] worry about well if I die what's gonna
[30:10] happen what what does it matter you're
[30:11] not living no more as far as here on the
[30:14] earth but Amen Satan wants you to get
[30:16] fearful about that or what happened to
[30:17] my wife or what happened to the husband
[30:20] or what happened to the children just
[30:22] come to Jesus Christ and let off the
[30:25] pressure a man I'm asking you tonight
[30:27] they just let off the pressure just let

[33:51] taking it all any man you know Abraham
[33:53] what if he would have gotten this moment
[33:55] of distress and begin to worry and begin
[33:58] to fret how's this gonna be how's this
[34:02] all going to come to pass how how in the
[34:04] world am I gonna become what he said I
[34:06] was the father the father of Nations the
[34:09] father many Howard and in your on his
[34:11] mind begin to get all would be getting
[34:13] to get all stirred up until it once once
[34:15] you get in that place or in that
[34:17] position
[34:18] you lose confidence in what God said he
[34:21] meant don't ever lose confidence in what
[34:23] he said because he said if I were if it
[34:25] were not so I would have told you so he
[34:28] said right that I wouldn't lie I can't
[34:30] tell you no I cannot tell you nothing
[34:32] but the truth so I go don't let your
[34:34] heart be trouble I'm going to prepare a
[34:37] place for you if it were not so I would
[34:39] have told you a man he said now I've
[34:41] told you this in my while I'm here but
[34:43] there's coming another one there's
[34:45] coming a comforter the Holy Ghost and
[34:47] he's gonna lead you he's gonna guide you
[34:50] amen
[34:50] listen just because the coronaviruses
[34:52] here don't mean the Holy Spirit has lost
[34:54] his ability to guide us he's still
[34:57] guiding us he's still moving he's still
[34:59] in their homes he's still in the houses
[35:01] amen he's still moving on our behalf

[35:06] need and her time to struggle he hasn't
[35:08] lost his abilities hallelujah I don't
[35:11] care how dark it is he'll still make her
[35:13] way through it I don't care how
[35:15] impossible it seems he'll still make her
[35:17] way through it he will not leave us or
[35:21] loses he will take us all the way so
[35:24] Abraham had confidence so that's what
[35:27] the devil is trying to do in your
[35:28] moments in these moments of crisis he's
[35:30] trying to make you worry and then worry
[35:33] and he's trying to anoint that to where
[35:35] you lose confidence and what the Holy
[35:37] Spirit is doing and when we're not to
[35:39] lose confidence in this time we were to
[35:41] hold on him and just keep on holding on
[35:44] Abraham was ninety and nine years old
[35:46] and all the time he never wavered
[35:48] he believed God's Word he called those
[35:51] things that were not as though they were
[35:53] cuz God said so he believed that baby
[35:56] would come and he held onto the promise
[35:59] what a man I want to be that kind of man
[36:02] Abraham who against hope Sarah's wound
[36:05] was dead he was sterile his body was
[36:08] dead the Bible said it was and his body
[36:11] was as good as dead and Sarah's womb was
[36:13] dead she was now nearly 40 years past
[36:15] menopause amen but still abraham
[36:18] believed
[36:19] that she would have a baby because God
[36:22] said so hallelujah
[36:26] I don't care how long we go in this I
[36:28] don't care how long time goes home God
[36:31] said there's gonna be a rapture God said
[36:34] there's going to be a body change
[36:36] God said there's going to be a people
[36:38] who are alive and remain God said
[36:41] there's going to be an overcomer in this
[36:42] haze God said this it doesn't matter
[36:45] what goes on or how dead it seems or how
[36:48] impossible it see God said so and he
[36:51] wouldn't have said it if it wasn't so
[36:53] hallelujah and so we got to hold on to
[36:56] it no matter what the creeds cover it up
[36:58] word but the word laid there it still
[37:00] had to come to pass that word was laying
[37:03] right there and Abraham's heart no
[37:05] matter how many says the days of this
[37:07] was gone and the days of that is gone as
[37:09] long as the word is laying there it's
[37:11] creative it's a German ties word God is
[37:14] the word and the life of God is in the
[37:17] word notice that now when the word drops
[37:19] into the life of God something takes
[37:22] place it has to come to pass hallelujah
[37:27] and I want to tell the devil he's too
[37:29] late there's already a people here on
[37:31] this earth that the Word of God has
[37:32] dropped into their hearts it's too late
[37:35] amen something's going to take place and
[37:37] when he appeared to him in the name of
[37:39] Almighty God God has seven contact a
[37:42] compound redemptive names and we know
[37:44] that but he came in el shaddai el
[37:46] shaddai el shaddai in hebrew that el
[37:49] means a strong one as we've been
[37:52] speaking on the Lord is a man of war
[37:54] he's not a weak man of war he's a strong
[37:57] man of war I've seen him coming to many
[38:00] battles and I've never seen him lose
[38:01] I've seen him come against every kind of
[38:04] sickness I've seen him come against
[38:05] every kind of depression I've seen him
[38:07] come in the middle of a Haman just
[38:09] somebody who says we testified I mean me

[38:49] sweet consolation - an old man a hundred
[38:52] years old holding the Word of God in his

[39:01] me and I will give you strength I will
[39:05] give you strength to fulfill the promise

[39:11] producing but I got the power that are
[39:13] producing come on little bride we can't
[39:15] produce a body changing our whole

[39:23] promise will produce what it said it
[39:25] would do hallelujah what did what does a
[39:29] mother do with her little child when

[39:33] and she brings him to her go to her
[39:35] bosom and he nurses the mothers strength
