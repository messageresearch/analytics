for me right now this moment i wanted to mention to the church that on thursday i believe it was brother john belk slipped away to be with the lord and he will have a graveside service on tuesday at 2 p.m at welcome cemetery just north of spring hill on highway 371 it's on the left side just across the state line so that'll be 2 p.m tuesday brother john come to us many years ago now probably it was after building the new church and then after the uh there on white oak when we built it back in 96 and then somewhere around 2000 we we did a fellowship hall and and at that time i had baptized brother john in the name of the lord jesus christ and god had delivered him from a cigarette habit other things that was in his life and did a miracle in his life and we're thankful for that and through the years he was um custodian of the church out there and um he was a real blessing to us we want to thank the lord for his life and his testimony and the blessing that he was to us but he slipped across the curtain a couple of months ago now he had a stroke and left him paralyzed on i think his right side and um he didn't want to live like that so the other day the lord granted his desire and let him slip across the curtain where that there is no crippled condition you're not prisoner in your own body amen with his complete and total healing and we thank the lord for that we also have ma ingram that is on hospice and i understand could go anytime so you know some of our elders are slipping away from us brother john wasn't really that old about 74 i think but um anyway he slipped away and he's on the other side waiting now and we just want to just take a moment just thank god for this life and for his testimony and i know the blessing that he was to you many of you and to the church body here amen let's just power heads for a moment [Music] lord as we just stop and reflect for a moment of a life that was among us a soldier that journeyed with us for a time it seems like lord in life's journey different ones get on the train and down the down the journey somewhere they get off and it's their time to go [Music] and we've had many lord that you've come for as i've said the lord is coming he may come for you today lord we know you came for brother john the other day as i sat in a and talked with him in his nursing home room and he was so animated and he beamed with joy to have our company and tried to tell me something though i couldn't understand anything he's had but lord now he's in a place where there is no inhibitions there's no complexes there's no hurts and injuries along the road and things that warps us in our mind and our character that makes us different and eccentric but lord oh god a place where there's just purity and holiness and goodness and kindness and where that we're all dressed alike in that old great white flowing robe of immortality lord he's joined the ranks of those that are now waiting on the other side who will soon come to us and then once we gather together we'll meet the lord in the air i pray lord that you'll comfort his family and give strength to them during this time his loved ones lord as many friends that he left behind lord i pray also from all ingram lord i remember many years ago when you brought her among us and did a work of grace in her life changed her saved her and now lord is close time to her crossing over will you just be with her lord the angels come for her that she not suffer long in this body lord we could ask for healing but for what measure for what purpose when when they still gonna have to die if time carries and they would be here in these old decrepit bodies for you would not make us young again though you would heal us you would just just give us a temporary healing until that time that we would have our change and i pray lord your blessings now upon her and upon your loved ones our loved ones everywhere and your people everywhere the bride of christ the world lord is meeting together or has met today and the needs of your people everywhere i pray that you'll meet with them in a very special way in jesus name we love you and we thank you for your goodness bless us in our service today and anointed to our hearts we pray in jesus name in moments like these i sing out a song i sing out a love song to jesus in moments like these i just lift up my hands i lift up my hands to the long remember singing i singing i love you [Music] i love you [Music] let us turn to luke chapter 17 and verse 26 we want to welcome you today in the name of the lord jesus caught sight of daniel and audrey god bless you and your family there today thank you for being here sister beth you've been sick the lord has been gracious brought you back now today i understand sister marie has the stomach virus stay clear of that she says it's worse than the kobe to her so may the lord touch sister marie lay today send his healing angel by her amen amen and our brother kenny sent in a request today and my heart just goes out to that need and i just pray the angel of god will go by there today and touch his body and healing amen god's still god and he's able amen luke chapter 17 verse 26 and that well as it was in the days that know east shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage and to the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and that day which he which shall be upon the house topped up in the house let him not come down to take it away he that is in the field let him not let him likewise not return back remember lot's wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it i tell you that in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one taken and the other left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken the other left two men shall be in the field one taken the other left and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is therefore there will the eagles be gathered amen and then also in genesis chapter 18 and verse 1 we'd like to read from there we've been reading this portion but i'm going to read several verses from chapter 18 this morning again and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and he said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant verse 10 and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah that's wife will have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of surety bear a child which emold is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son may god bless you you can be seated we're going to be speaking this morning on the angel's return i sincerely believe that this is the day of the angel's visitation and all these players of this scene that we have looked at of abraham's day is a prophecy of the end time and even jesus would use this and prophesy of when the son of man is revealed when the word is revealed that it would be a time as it was in the days of lot and of course you can't have the days a lot without having the days of abraham but all of these are all of these characters are and players of this scene and abraham's day is a prophecy of the end time i i hope that you will always look at your bible as a prophecy when you read your bible remember it's more than just a story it's more than just a a historical account um or in the details of um of jewish people in the jewish race but it actually is god was writing a prophecy in their lives that is to be fulfilled in this end time now in the bible these men and women were playing out of a prophecy to be fulfilled and and there's hardly a character that is listed without a direct relation to our day you see we are in the seventh seal now that may sound a little strange but you know when we say the seventh seal and everybody knows it's a half hour of silence it is a time where god silenced something and it was to be for a space of time and that space of time actually was um you know would go into several thousand years and church ages where god would hold on secret a great mystery where god would hold on secret a great mystery and and it would be the mystery of the end time when you look at the seventh seal it is synonymous with the coming of the lord and it is it is of course i'm opening up the end time process it's the beginning of the end and it's where that god reveals what he's been doing to the ages to make it plain to us in this last day of why we are here and how we got here and then where we are going and what is our day and our hour in our visitation so we're in a very special time where it is no longer silent but where the silence has been broken where now the mysteries of god have been finished and god has let you in on things that other generations only long to see and understand now when we speak of this as prophecies in these lives you know abraham was not let in on knowing that there was going to be um four or five thousand more years of world history and he was only a player on the scene and prophesying of another generation he was not told now when you're doing this i want you to understand why you're taking isaac upon this mountain and why you're going to sacrifice him and your only son and why you're why he's carrying the wood on his shoulders and why he's acting he did not realize he was acting out something or prophesying of event that would happen with the seed of abraham some thousands of years later and but you know god did lady man on the clue he said he said this is jehovah jireh or in the mount of the lord it shall be seen in the same mountain this scene will repeat again one day and so it was you know little revelations and things but they couldn't quite see the picture you know there were was a veil over their eyes because brother branham said god will hold us blind to things until the time that we have need of it and so we must be in great need in this last age in order to be a people who has faith for god to unveil so many things to us because this is a time of the unveiling of god not the cover up or the hiding of the secret of god this is where a people is brought into the very secrets of god because she is a pride of marriage age of whom he is drawn up next to himself to whisper the love secrets to isn't that amazing that god would let you in on secrets that other ages only long to see and yet he would say blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears for they hear for prophets and wise men and sages have longed to see your day and has not seen them what an hour we're privileged to live in now so god that you know again brought us now to this space of time in fact of the matter is you know the seventh seal would begin with the angels of god and we'll come into that maybe in a later sermon that uh that in my studies if god will permit it but here there he but the seven angels would come and and um and break open the seventh seal and when it's happened and he would send it back you know to reveal um all the other seals because it's the time of the breaking of the silence and so um this breaking of the seal or the silence god had a silent hidden mystery in almost every character of the bible you see the characters of the bible would actually live out the plan of redemption and you know whether it be the coming redeemer or his bride or the church for example you know david would there get in a straight as a as um reflecting the son of david and he would say my god my god why hast i forsaken me and my bones they stare at me and they parted my garments and and they they pierced my hands and my feet and all kinds of things that he would prophesy under the spirit actually groaning speaking of it as if it was himself but he was actually experiencing things that would cause him to prophesy out of his life things that would happen in the son of david so you would see characters in the bible that are that explicitly um live out and portray the end time prophecies in other words they would be speaking of you this is why in revelation 19 that he has granted us to be arrayed in whiteland and clean and white which is the righteousness of the saints so their righteous acts the things that they were doing we are now being dressed in it are you with me so we are now wearing this very scene or in other words we are the character wearing abraham and sarah's close and been living in this time now it's not a prophecy now it is a fulfillment of prophecy because they prophesied and you are the fulfillment amen so therefore we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled or is in the process of being fulfilled amen now as we look at this you know god purpose to do this to a purpose this to prophetical class of people to reveal the bible as a prophecy not as just a history the opening of the seals and the breaking of the silences reveals the mystery that is hidden in every bible character so whether it be whether it be isaac and rebecca and the elies are going together and all the other different scenes of the bible you know ruth and and boaz and and and the kinsmen redeemer and that whole story and esther or whoever it is unknowing to themselves they were prophesying of another age now i would say that you are not prophesying you are fulfilled because there's not another age to come to fulfill the prophecies so we are not typing out another age but well yeah rather we are fulfilling all the types that has been spoke of this age now of course you know as we see that much of the bible speaks of the groom it speaks of the bride because they're all one person so therefore he will prophesy christ in a prophesy of his bride but although either way is it's prophesying of the same person and his plan of redemption now in christ a mystery brother adam tells us that god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and the hidden mystery that he had in his mind before the world began and he said how that has unfolded itself down to this present hour that we're living and he said then you will understand clearly or you see on i believe what is being done he said god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knew nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it and i can imagine the angels watching a lot of the events and saying god why did you do it this way because it wasn't it wasn't revealed to the angels of what god was doing it was kept secret until the time of his coming and i want to get something in your heart this morning that we are living in the time of his coming and that time of his coming is not a singular event see we often have looked at the rapture as being a singular event it is not it is a it is a um an explosion of events one thing will happen cause another happen this will happen to cause another and this will happen another and another another another until it's all fulfilled now so you see as he said um god's great mystery even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's why the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence you see because god held it a mystery and jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come and he said even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has all this to himself it is a secret so even jesus as a man was not privy to knowing his return amen he would be after his death burial and resurrection when he goes back into the form of the pillar of fire he comes back to john on the isle of patmos to reveal to him his coming are you with me now but it would be written in mysteries because it wasn't for the other ages god haven't reserved the last book of the bible for you hallelujah if you just stop and think of it the book of acts was written of a people two thousand years ago matthew mark luke and john was written of a people two thousand years ago but the book of revelation has been written about you it is actually your book a prophecy now as we think of this he says god has all this to himself it is a secret that's the reason there was silence in heaven for space of half hour and seven thunders under their voices john was even forbidden to write at sea the coming of the lord and that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come and it's a good thing he doesn't no he has shown it or revealed it in every type that's in the bible so now there of course there is that portion of that seventh seal that we won't know until we are changed till the dead and christ rise but yet there are other portions of it he said it was in three different parts it was that third pull which is his message it was so seven thunder sounded right in a row which was the opening of the seventh seal and he said the last part of it went forth and in tongues and he said i couldn't understand what it said and of course that's the day and hour of when he returns and god holds that great mystery i'm glad he did that he held it a mystery because you know i have been preaching like you know with fervency and diligence since i was a 15 year old boy because i looked for jesus to come that year amen brother and but god held that part bail to me and to you amen because if satan would have got a hold of it he'd have done great damage with it if the church would have been dilatory and lazy and said well we got 50 years to go you know we so we we can just kind of rest on our laurels and and twiddle our thumbs and wait and you know it'll come in it's time 50 years down the road and if i ain't ready yet i've got 50 years to get ready but god holds that part a great secret amen so that you will be continue did you remember timothy's sermon the other night the the one of the very key words of jesus coming and his return is watch watch over and again this word is associated with this coming watch watch watch because god wants us to have a watchful attitude amen he doesn't want us falling asleep he wants us doing our work work while it's day amen he said because the night's coming when no man can work so you see only only time we can do the work for god is right now while we're in this flesh this is what brother branham said this is the only time i preach the gospel is immortal i know people are expecting him to come back and do this and that well he said the only only time i'll ever preach is as a mortal it's my only opportunity this is our opportunity to preach this is our opportunity to spread the good news this is the opportunity to be the sign before the world that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever now but but he said you know it said that this one thing yet he hadn't revealed yet how he will come when he will come and it's a good thing he doesn't know he has showed it or revealed it and this is what i want to get to you in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is a revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose that he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bibles has been in type expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it so there is abraham that we see in this scene this prophecy he is the father of our faith he is sarah is his wife who is one with abraham and she is included with the promise although she can't quite believe that she's in the promise now brother branham told us that in abraham's journey that he had met god in all different forms and and he said we could they didn't show it because just we are abraham's seed if we're in christ and and isaac was really his lesser son he was his son sexually but spiritually christ was abraham's seed his royal seed his faith now we find this royal sea travels us the journey the same journey that the bride of christ travels the same journey that abraham did and the last sign that abraham seen before the promised son came was when god was manifested in a human body and two angels came down now luke 17 30 we read it said as it was in the days when the son of man is revealed now he comes in three sons name which is son of son of man which is a prophet son of god which uh through the church ages and brother branham always depicted that as the holy spirit god be in the spirit and he said then the son of david so he said in between the son of god and son of david according to his own word in malachi 4 many scripture he's returned back into his church in a physical form in the people in human beings what's now in the way of being a prophet now noted not only is there to be a messenger who is to be a prophet that the son of man christ will manifest himself through but there will be a special class of people a super church now we have to be a prophetical class of people because the book the of the bible that specifically our book the book of revelation is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his future work in the future ages and to understand it will take the holy spirit now so it will take a revelation and i want to just get this to you it'll have to come by an angel amen because it was revealed to john by an angel he said i i jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things so again it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make the book of revelation real to us it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means there's got to be a prophetical class of people who can be moved by the spirit of god and that means that this book cannot be revealed to anyone but a special class of people let me just tell you right now the people of the book that's who it's written to it wasn't written to be understood by all the other other ones but the people of the book amen and it will take a people with prophetical insight that will require an ability to hear from god let me tell you in this age there has to be somebody with years to hear what the spirit is saying to the church there's got to be a people that is spiritually can spiritually discern the day and the hour that they are living in i want you to understand real clearly a people that can hear the voice of god of people that can discern the voice of god from all the other millions of voices that are in the world today and it will require instruction and not just a student comparing verse with birth so that's good but a mystery requires that teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear so how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to know to hear and know and yeah i did read some of that from the churches book i paraphrased it now saw super race a super supersede a super sign a super prophecy with a super fulfillment a super race remember god would put it on the pen of the prophet of god to write in these last days the bride of christ the true bride christ or bride church christ seed will come to the headstone and she will be a super church a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with them they will be one they will be the manifestation of the word of the living god so the word that's written in the bible they will manifest it whether it be of abraham of esther or rebecca or write down the you know through through any of the characters elijah elijah the double portion all of these things they are prophesied and you can look in the bible and you can read and we can say these search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me they tell of what i am to be in this end time and i want to remind you you may look at some of this and say i'm not that yet i'll tell you don't look at that look at what he said because you're going to be everything god said in his word you that you would be come on if he said you'll be a bride without spider-wrinkle and you say i've got some wrinkles and i've got some spots just know this this this god ain't gonna leave you and abandon you this god will continue working on you till he irons out all the wrinkles and he takes every spot and puts it in his blood because god's not about to abandon the work that he has started i'll tell you god has went through some tremendous efforts in this end time visit this age with an angel the angel of the covenant no less god's done some mighty things and let me just remind you he's abandoning his plan he's been waiting for this moment you think you're waiting for rapture he's been waiting for this moment for thousands of years before that in eternity when he had this plan in his mind and he's only now just opening up his heart and let you see in the back part of his mind what he had planned for you lord of god i thank god when he even when brother branham come down to the trumpets and him thinking there was going to be a squeeze and a persecution and all these things are rude about a squeeze and a persecution and i think and i think but god come down and say i got a greater plan and he shows the trumpets and when the trumpets are opened up he said it's not even to you at all the gentiles amen you'll go through none of that but the rapture that's the next thing for you he said his grace is so great upon you [Applause] the things that we're seeing are minor to the tribulation's coming it's time you make your call in an election sure because you're going to fit in one of these characters in this prophecy that we're going to be speaking about this morning the super sign brother branham said that he chose to come as abraham seed abraham's supersede said he could have come as an angel could have come you know um many different ways but whatever way he wished but he chose to come as abraham's supersede and that the way he chose to come to show in this last day god supersign and is super racial yes not what you call a super race but what god calls the super race because he got what supernatural power with supernatural signs to a supernatural belief in a supernatural word from a supernatural god in a supernatural body in a supernatural people giving him supernatural signs hallelujah of super race they that know their god shall do exploits great exploits and show supernatural signs of people abraham's seed a sign of the supernatural christ risen from the dead supernaturally now notice remember he come to get abraham to come to get sarah to believe him that was sarah her faith had drifted so far from the initial promise that she couldn't believe the news that she was going to bring forth the promised son it looked impossible after all of these years god still got a plan god still got a purpose for me god's still going to do something with this old bride come on that was sarah her faith had drifted away she she could think back over god's promise and she could not remember a time not even one specific occasion where that god said to her that she was to bear seed and that would inherit this land they only said that to abraham you see so many times we look in promises and we see that it's to christ or it was to the early church or it was to abraham or it was elijah and we can't hardly believe it's for me one problem was sarah had never met elohim herself amen she only heard of other occasions where god had come down to abraham and she believed that she had a faith for abraham i mean sarah had been promised and disappointed so many times and now she had come to terms with life by now she's 90 years old and she you know come on now you know how it would be she she would think oh maybe it's this month and then there would come another showing she wasn't pregnant and then maybe it's next month and then she'd hear of a special uh visitation with a maybe because he's come it'll be this month she'd be disappointed again you know and then then she gets in the time of life and you know maybe skip cycles and so on you know surely maybe maybe oh it's it's happening in the change of life only to be disappointed again do you know what i'm talking about we've had movements down to the age and it looks like this is going to be it it was luther and it looked like it was going to be in this movement and come on and then wesley and pentecost and the divine healing meetings and then we've even had little different false rises that's been in in in the the messaging on the seventh thunder movement and and and perusia movement and two lord movement seven thunder movement and and and and perusia movement and two lord movement and that surely it's gonna be gonna be here all of these things only to be disappointed only to see it just bring forth another wild child another child of a denomination some man-made system help me preach now i know i'm meddling a little bit but you're gonna have to hold tight this morning and then we're talking about a prophecy and from the first time that you know abram had come in from the fields where he was keeping the flocks and reported hey him honey elohim has spoken to millions promised me a seat you know sarah my love don't worry about your baroness don't worry that we've been married since you were 16 years old and we've been together you know i i was 26 and you were 16 and god is promised me a son well you're gonna bring forth a child but you know now she's up in age and she is no longer looking for the fulfillment of the promise she's discouraged it'll never happen you know oh yes she believed it would all be fulfilled but just not by her and you know this kind of attitude even becomes with people when it becomes a delay of the promise even to delay that we are experiencing of the coming of the lord because that's another thing that's associated with his coming is delay that men will say the lord have delayed his coming that's coffee it gives and makes room for scoffers to rise and make fun and you know sarah you've been thinking this for since she was 16 and it ain't happened yet you've been looking a long time for it's coming in and you find people getting laughs and lazy and people becoming a deletory and slothful and and maybe a little bit down and out and depressed and you know the fervency isn't there and if you can't get them to come to church you know you just barely get them to clap their hands or praise the lord or whatever because they're they're just so weary of waiting and for too long sarah the church has not truly looked for the coming of the lord she has just been satisfied with letting hagar do it and hagar and her denominational child you know we just we'll just perpetuate the ages and be content with a child of our unbelief that's what denomination is it's a child of unbelief it's where people settle down instead of move on oh i'm preaching to a lot of denominational camps around the message right now did you just settle down and you've not moved in years i hear preachers sometimes brag and say i preach the same thing i have for 40 years and i say shame on you there would have been some new inspiration down along the road somewhere there should have been a revelation from god how come you're going back to 40 years and what about a church that states backslidden and cold and formal and not moving in the spirit [Applause] well we're back where we we're still where we were 40 years ago we're hanging on well i'll tell you why don't you turn loose once in a while and let god move you a little further than what you've been you know we just perpetuate the ages and be content with the child of our unbelief for years every movement where god moved with the promise only resulted in sarah giving up and offering her bonds made and form the denomination and bring forth the ishmael a wild man who won't be subject to the word i think some of the products of some of this preaching in the message that is produced backslidden offspring to don't have a zeal of fervency a desire their grandchildren of the message they're little ishmael lights and they show their rebellion you know they'll wear their makeup and theirs cut their hair and paint their face and do all their things you know because they're wild somebody gonna help me preach this morning don't hang up on me yet i got a lot of things to say amen now you see again in this prophecy there there is a hagar remember there's a lot of different characters and just what we're seeing abraham and sarah that make up this whole story and this whole prophecy there's a hagar she is a bones woman a man whose trial will never be air with the free woman did you hear me she will never be asked she is not a child ishmael never was a child of faith it was she he was a child of abraham's self efforts and works remember when isaac come on the scene he was a miracle child abraham's body was now dead and sarah's womb was dead and god had to do a new creation and every true child of god will be a new creation they will not be the works of human expression of the laws of do's and don'ts and this and that and conforming to a message society or to a message of god this is not a law this is the grace of god poured out where he is bringing forth a new creation where he makes anew and creates a child of creation not a child of works and human efforts when you get people you gotta beg and pamper and baby to come to church amen you might get them to come but they're children of your efforts now again again that's why i don't go chase after you you either want to come or you don't want to come amen you know there was a lot let me just stop and talk about him for a minute god called abraham but abraham called lot and he wasn't nothing but what brother branham described but as a hair in the biscuit until he separated himself you say brother tim you're just one you just want us to leave right you just want us to separate i want you to separate from sin and the world and the darkness of this world and come to christ amen get born again and become abraham's seed and not a lot amen you do not have to identify yourself with lot you don't have to identify yourself with an ich bill you make your own choice there but the bonds woman brought forth a child who is a wild man bible said in genesis 16 12 he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him well you know that's true today look what's going over there in in israel now with the palestinians trying to claim the same land so we're seed of abraham too but you see this is also why the great battles between the denominations and their scholars and their differences that separates them from others and that same thing that's happened around the message these ishmael movements amen they're wild as a donkey that won't be they want i'm just quoting scripture they won't be subject to to the word of god their hand is against everybody amen you they can't fellowship with nobody you know they you know you you ain't in my true lord camp or you ain't in my perugia camp or you ain't my thunder camper you ain't in this camp or you ain't that come on all of them are just ishmael moves that that is where they're just fighting and turmoil and you know you're fighting over the message come on the message wasn't the fight over the message was for you to live out of your life [Applause] [Music] in fact all of these great battles through the years in christianity permit for tradition for uh producing all of these ishmaelite moves results in splitting up the body of christ in the 40 000 different denominations today everyone the gateway to heaven everyone the way the truth and the life and i'll tell you what try to weed your way through the merit of all of them to try and try to find truth because ain't none of them got any truth they're all based on men's ideas so well what about you and following this message i'll tell you ours was not william branham's thoughts [Music] it came by an angel the angel of the covenant the one who made the covenant came down to vindicate his own word in this day to bring you a message that you are chosen the chosen generation to bring forth the promised son hallelujah [Applause] now don't get me wrong sarah had faith her faith was that abraham could do it but not her it's you know agar could do it but not her you know you see the church has long given up on the promise that the promise is to be fulfilled through her she she believes in jesus she believes in his power that he can do anything but not through her some message believers have sunk down into this same kind of unbelief they instead have substituted brother branham for jesus and their faith is a historical faith to them it all lays in the prophet brother branham tried to keep people from putting their faith in him as no true servant of christ we will point to himself but to jesus and that's why we see it falling away is because it made brother branham infallible that made him god and now they see his humanity they lose their faith amen now as we as we look at this you know i mean come on there's a lot of things that that are listed here in different direction we could go but as we see this scene open must have been a very hot day abraham's sitting in the tent of the door he getting out where he can get a little breeze sitting in the shade maybe there had been a lot of complaints of the herdsmen that the grass was all gone the economy was dying at 401k is gonna crumble it'll vanish in the night and it could very well well i'll cash out the dollars that's all i say what's your money gonna be worth amen well you know you think of a way to save yourself i'm going to remind you there's only one way of salvation and that's through the angel all your self preservation will not work well we'll store up food for hard times yeah and your beans have turned hard and go rank you know somebody wrote me the other day and said you know there's some some rich friends there i forgot how much so i'll make up something bought fifty thousand dollars with the beans and i said uh well by the time you eat all these beans they will all turn rank weevils they won't last you'll be throwing them out don't prepare to stay here let me just tell you you're not even fit to live here until you're ready to go from here and if you're not ready to go you're not even fit to stay and i tell you what if we're waiting on you you do me a big favor to get in i've been waiting on you a long time but anyway maybe they'd found the water holes in the land the water got low and they go dig out and find where water was seeping and the water and the cattle just didn't have enough to supply them you know sometimes things get difficult in the promised land that makes you want to leave the promised land it happened to abraham he went down to egypt and he learned a big lesson down there come on and and and so there again you know trouble was on every hand because he he went down to egypt i think this is one reason he didn't turn go down the sodom he'd already been down to egypt and he didn't find anything of comfort down there but you know things go wrong we we know by nature that that it's the darkness just before the day and and quoting brother branham here he said many times we see disastrous things happening especially to believers we must bear this in our mind that is satan trying to block the blessing that is on this road amen so you ought to look at all of this all of this uh this this adversity that we're facing and saying look here satan i don't got a clue on you you're only trying to block a blessing that is on its way hallelujah because one of the greatest blessings of sarah's life would happen in the next few minutes in the darkest hour in the worst time in the the time where it looked the least possibilities and he said satan was trying to tempt him to feel they had done wrong satan trying to tempt them to think they had done wrong and was trying to block off the oncoming visitation that god was going to give abraham and sarah our church ain't nothing out of order amen nothing's out of cater everything that you're seeing going around you say well this cobia this and then the worst diseases and the more contagious one's coming and you know and and and things that are fixing to happen in our government and troubles don't every hand by the tim you know he what did we do wrong we didn't do nothing wrong amen god's god has given us a promise and and no matter how bad it seems i want you to remember it's just working for your good i i know maybe you're disappointed maybe you're the man you thought who would give us a couple of more years or whatever else but tranquility and peace and better things in america first and all of this you know he didn't get elected amen if he did they didn't recognize the election whatever happened they stole it you can't convince a true american otherwise it is a repeating of history and i'll bring it down in a minute but anyway he says satan's been after me all day so i believe there's a blessing in store here in this city somewhere and i know when he chimps and tries to block out what he's trying to do get you to disbelieve and the worst thing that you can do is disbelieve god and as soon as you get a little scared well maybe i haven't done this and i haven't done that right then satan's got the blessing conquered for you you can't get to it as long as satan makes you think that and i'll tell you if you do have things in your life that you're wondering about repent get it under the blood like the woman we spoke about last sunday you know where she was the last wheelchair the last one in a wheelchair hallelujah and the angel of god the pillar of fire would come down on her but be driven away by her thinking i'm too bad maybe it was i've been in this condition too long my case is too hard my case is worse than others amen maybe maybe it was you know something else i i'm just not worthy i i'm just not good enough the only way you can be good enough is come by the way of the blood you think you're going to live in this flesh and perfection this flesh isn't perfect it takes a repentance and continually walk into the spirit and keeping your body subject to the word of god bringing your flesh subject to god's word amen want you on this side to pull really hard i keep looking this direction i want to get you too you there in the mezzanine don't just distance yourself up there say i'm here i'm a part of this i'm going to get my portion amen satan trying to block abraham and sarah because he knew there was an angelic visitation coming amen and when we know things are rising things are wrong and troubles on every hand if we would listen to satan we might miss it like sarah was missing it you know she was kind of fussy you know why is it that we got to be so different how come we got to be the oddballs around you know the messy people did not use the oddballs or the eyeball of the eyeballs of the oddballs why you know the other day i went to the city and miss lots she had on one of the cutest little dresses and her her hairdo was this way and that and it was styled by the egyptians yeah so you got the new styles and you know they learn to twinkle your eyes and you know make them larger and bigger and you know and and you know where we could kind of wink and seduce men and then you know they they got all the new styles well why can't we just be a baptist come on come on what's all this stuff about angels and prophets and you know messengers and you know what why can't we just be like the rest of them and it's as simple as this there's an abraham group and there's lots and they went through different directions both of them were going to the same land but one got sidetracked you saw the glamour and the glitter and the gold and the big lights and oh the worldly placers you know where you could kind of live a highway life and be accepted even looked on his righteous among them because they were so evil [Music] you know and and but it's you know sarah now she's all out of out of tune with what god's doing and i i just say you know god's doing some wonderful things right now in this end time process don't get distracted don't get pulled another direction amen you know if sarah had only known there was more than a caravan from egypt coming by hallelujah there was a host of the lord headed her way [Applause] hallelujah and i want you to know it's more than a new president or vice president for us it's more than our new society and the ideas of man it's more than that there's a host of angels on their way hallelujah and abraham looked up and he said oh honey sarah today is our day of visitation right now and i believe that's what the holy spirit is trying to tell evening like tabernacle today is your day of visitation right now this time this hour this place we are getting our visitation and every time he comes something good happens hallelujah this may be the day you get up and push your wheelchair around of your complexes and the things that sins that are so easily beset you instead of them pushing you around you push them around hallelujah this is the day where that all that you're a reality comes even that god hasn't forgotten his people that he's never too late though you may be 90 years old sarah god is never too late he's always on time he's right there at the right moment at the right time to speak through your life [Applause] amen oh but the preaching of the gospel can blind the unbeliever god says they have eyes they can see in ears and they can't hear but god if anything i wanted him to do for me is open my spiritual eyes didn't i say there was to be a bride with us that's a spiritual class of people supernatural who have eyes and ears to see and hear i want to see him get so acquainted with him that i know him on the very first sight i'll recognize it's god amen you know be like abraham was isn't that your desire i can recognize him you know his first moves now i don't want to miss him [Music] amen come on because when these angels come down to sodom they miss him they only saw men they didn't see angels they missed him and i'll tell you you can be right in the same spot amen that's why one will be taken another left one will be taken and another left it'll even happen it'll happen in the service sometimes one will be taken crapped up into the spirit another right beside them left behind i'll tell you i don't want to be left behind at any church service and i shouldn't be left behind in the rapture [Music] [Applause] but a true eagle will gather where the body is now another character in this prophecy we've already touched on his lot the nominal church who just followed abraham but he never had a true revelation he eventually set his tents towards sodom that's where worldly church i guarantee you the the the early fathers of the methodists who started down their land as they began to get cold and you know the methodist move used to be a revival my john wesley would preach and they would fall out in the spirit until they would take water and wash them in the face and wake him up have to revive them they're so lost in the spirit and you know then it became it as the move went on a little more starchy and you know we don't want those times anymore you know somebody running the aisles and shouting and whatever we we don't want them kind of service you know that that ain't dignified and they begin to get an educational program and and they want it moved away from those holy ghost meetings you know they started down towards sodom but they didn't intend to go there you know a lot didn't probably intend to go all the way it was going to get close where it was convenient you know uh he was just he just making some moves you know uh they kind of getting a little uh in his choice he didn't know it but it was moving him away and his eyes had been caught the glamour of sodom and he couldn't see the burning that was going to come he couldn't see members of his family perishing in the flames he couldn't see his wife turn into a pillar of salt because she loved sodom better than she did to obey this angel's voice you know lot is a nominal church like i said methodists they never dreamed when they started this when they started edging down towards sodom and this past they never dreamed their leaders would be homosexuals they never dreamed the immorality that would come in the church they never could see they couldn't see women in their pulpits because of the perversion that was happening in the church are you with me amen you know they couldn't see and and that's the way it is a lot of times you know choices that you make and young people you're one of the you're the one that's some of the most vulnerable there is because you are making choices it's a time where choices are made that sets your life a certain direction your choice of mate your choice of education your choice of friends you know this this cool kid we've had some of the cool kids hey man some of the cute cool kids i listened to brother andrew you know singing a while ago he followed a cool kid until one day god opened his eyes amen what did he do he picked him up and he turned him around and he put his feet on solid ground [Applause] hallelujah and there's no going back no more no going back no more you say well brother tim what about the cool kids you're talking about i pray for every one of them prodigals that god will get a hold of them wherever they are eating the slop of the world amen the angel of god that we're talking about visiting us the angel of god will go by their way and wake them up in this late hour [Applause] not ought to be the cry of every parent the lot never had a true revelation himself the worldly church set their tent towards sodom but even lot in his backslidden condition when those two angels there's messengers those evangelists the lord was sitting in the gate and and a little spark was still it was still left in his heart and he he recognized that was that it was angels it was messengers from god and and he wanted to hear what those angels had to say he invited him to his house do you know even the nominal church they are desirous of some of the anointing amen i'll get to that more in a minute there's another thing it's a city it's a people their character in this whole thing is sodom it exemplifies the world condition and our churches have given over to sodom women homosexuals in the pulpit lesbians women wearing men's apparel men wearing women's apparel hey man women cutting their hair and men growing theirs long amen when the great apostle paul who preached the gospel of jesus christ has revealed him said it's a shame for a man to wear long hair and and share a short hair on a woman is dishonorable amen by bible standards that's true amount that's not something brother branham made up that's something the bible teaches amen our schools and our colleges are now teaching sodom curriculum you know it was one of the first things that mr biden did was roll back mr trump's executive order of teaching history in in school that told about god and the pilgrim fathers and the founding fathers and what our nation was founded on he rolled it back right there to do away with that anything about god in our curriculum to put it down cram it down our kids of a religion of a nation that is has freedom from god our schools were teaching a sodom curriculum you better have the holy ghost before you go there you know no matter you know teaching the youth that no matter what god created you to be i'm just talking about the sodom condition they're a player in this so bear with me just a moment amen but you know i i are they're teaching to you that no matter what god created you to be male or female and that's what he did he created a male or thin female is that right you don't get to choose it god does amen you can do but they're teaching you can choose whatever sex you want to be and our government has given over to sodom and sodomy you know headlines are screaming that biden is reshaping gender and reproductive rights you know their their transgenders can now play as girls on girls sports teams and all this being advocated transgenders you know there is fire and destruction that's another thing that's in the scene fire and destruction representing the atomic age and the destruction of the world by fire and i want you to know we're right now here at that place i forget what year it was but it's out in the national geographic right now brother doug bacon told us a special testimony he was one year old his father was at that base in north uh was it north carolina i think anyway it was there a little sleepy base but they had become uh one of the places where the b-52s were flying into and there on a certain day i get all the dates and all of that but that's not important for this sermon on a certain day back there in the in the early 60s i think it was 61 and the seals had not been opened i want you to know that's key and and the seals had not been opened the book had not been revealed and and these loaded bombs two atomic bombs they would this b-52 would disintegrate in the sky there would be men that would actually um eject from there and some of them were found dead hanging in the trees others never never could their ejector didn't work one one black man he was um an air force man that was on that mission and he was not in a jump seat and and when they ejected out of that hole he he ejected out and pulled his string and and and there you know his his his um parachute opened and and he was drifting slowly down and all of a sudden it explodes on the ground and a great great thing happening and it brings his um his his um parachute together and and he's falling now and he said well i'm a child of god he was a christian man i'm a child of god and if this is what god wills and about that time another blast goes open and a blast of air comes back opens his chute and he's heading down right now toward the wreckage to land in the fire and he said well if this would be the will of my god and let it be the will of my god and a wind blew him about a mile or so from the wreckage this ain't funny but because he was a black man and he shows up at the base with a parachute and it gives us this fantastic story they arrest him for stealing a parachute par for the courts huh you think brother l par for the course so you know anyway two atomic bombs that is large enough to destroy every city in the east coast and they're designed at that moment the moment they see radiation come up and signal on that for them to drop the bombs those planes that are close to russia and in one moment's time the world was that close to going up into atomic fodder but the angels that holds the four winds of the earth say wait a minute amen the seals aren't open i got a call of bride amen the gospel got to turn to the jews and god held off that nuclear destruction that was coming on the earth but that's how close we've already came to it and it would already happen except god held it back they said there are seven triggers on those atomic bombs and it got down to the last one and it didn't detonate it went down with such velocity they went down 175 feet into the earth but let me tell you there's fire and destruction representing the atomic age and the destruction of the world by fire and we are in the sixth vision do i need to remind you mussolini would invade ethiopia and the nation followed his steps the rise and the fall then of adolf hitler was shown the isms of nazism and fascism would be swallowed up by communism and the voice admonishment watch russia watch russia keep your eye on the king of the north the fourth vision advances in science that was headed up by a vision of an egg-shaped car the word aerial dynamic was not invented yet it would be guided by somehow without a steering wheel showing advances in science where are we on that we're already hearing them in our driving on our our our highways come on we're already hearing of laws being passed that permits them to be there we're hearing of remote trains and promote this and that or wow whatever way that they do it remote may not be the right word but anyway whether they are whatever way that they do it remote may not be the right word but anyway we're that they are self-guided and then it showed them the fifth was the moral problem of our age centered mostly around women and i'm going to tell you women don't be a part of this vision you make it up in your mind and heart i'm not going to fulfill that vision because there is another vision not of an immoral woman [Applause] but of a woman of bride who is walking instead with the word of god and when the others go down she goes up and brother branham said then you can like it or lump it you can say it's out of date and out of step and it is because we're not going their direction it is out this what i'm fixing to tell you is out of date it is out of step with what the rest of the world and the way society thinks but it's the word of god anyhow it doesn't change the word and he showed me women began to be out of their place by with the granting of the vote and they cut off their hair which signified they were no longer under the authority of man but signified instead of but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases um more than equal rights let me stop right there paul also taught that the man is the head of the woman and the man's head is christ there's a family structure that message people must not forget [Music] amen god made men to be a leader man step up amen be real men be real fathers exemplify the father of heaven in your relationship with your children be a husband to your wife be true be honest be right that's what makes helps make happy homes it's only one half the other half of it is she it comes to the woman's side but anyway in this she adopted men's clothing and went to a state of undress until the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with this vision i saw the terrible perversion and moral plight in the world and i want to just say to you we are in the sixth vision and that sixth vision now we've seen them all they're you know the car is on the scene the women's situation is on the scene i know i know we don't like it women given the right to vote women should have the right to vote listen if they were all holy ghost field we wouldn't have a problem amen but when they are led when they're led by society and ideas and emotions hormones and the desire to to to conquer and be more than equal oh i know you're on the tangent brother tim you're way out there you're out of step yeah i am i'm not going your direction [Music] i'm going another i beat you a different driver and every member of the bride of christ beats to a different drama than that of the world we're not going to sodom in its perversion we're going upward heaven is our home we got a different goal we got a different ambition this wicked woman kamala that america has voted in or whatever happened there god in has has made prostitution or wants to make prostitution legal oh yeah they wanted to they even even moves to lower the age of consent for sexual means and even make it where those of with the lord consent now can consent to be used for porn objects we're going to sodom and by faith moses brother bradley said a great woman will rise up and be president or something like that in the nation and then there will come a total annihilation the the entire nation will be wiped out let me stop this for a moment you saw it happen you saw it happen this week brother branham himself said i i saw her in the vision with with a high uh uh with with royal high purple someone who said oh that was blue they said it was royal purple the prophet of god said it was royal purple and he said you children you young people listen to me he said there will be will rise a great woman if she will be either a president or a vice president amen and he said or it could be the catholic church and i said we got them all he said you know what with mr kennedy he said the way he got in there was with with um he rigged with rick voting he said they that mess with the voting machines and he said the fbi even exposed it but that won't do nobody will do anything about it and here we are 60 years later and nobody will do anything about it [Applause] we ain't got a politician in the in an america that's got any backbone about them and they stole the election i don't care what you liberals say you'll never convince me it is a repeat of what happened with the first catholic president coming in and now he said he would make a good president for now he said we'll only make a way for another one to come and we're here now in the vision i'll tell you what what other message what other church can stand up and say you've been seen in the vision royal purple sworn in come on who else can say that what can the methodist say that can the baptist say that none of them saw this coming but god sent an angel to you to make you know where you would be in the vision now the next vision is smoke bombs and craters all over the land of america as far as i could see now i'm going to give you one that blow you away and then i'll bring you back so get ready to be puffed out and brought back this vision these seven visions listen will transpire before the coming of the lord what we're in the sixth you mean the seventh is gonna be for the coming of the lord all of these will transpire you mean we will see all of this before the rapture he didn't say that he said before the coming of the lord and the two come there are two comings of christ in this last day one for his bride and one back with his bride amen and i believe you know madison is going to be a main player in the tribulation yeah she'll exist even into that time but somewhere at the end of the marriage supper well we're enjoying three and a half years with god in glory come on and somewhere close to the end of the marriage supper the world will burn with fire let me tell you even the vatican will burn with fire oh that great city will burn within an hour that's thus saith the lord from the bible she sits on seven hills she's there you know the blood of the saints in her tell me who else could that be 68 million of them but guess what's going to happen for the millennium the righteous will walk out on the ashes of the wicked you see the world will be destroyed this sodom world not just america this sodom world will be destroyed at armageddon amen i always say clockwork and so busy sometimes ii peter 3 10 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with the preferring heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up malachi 4 1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall come shall burn them up set the lord of hosts and then shall it leave them neither root nor branch zechariah 14 12 and this shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite all the people that have fought against jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes to consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth and if you read the context of this this is armageddon it's already been prophesied and the prophet already saw it coming and we are in the sixth vision oh hallelujah sarah it's time for your change sarah you're receiving the last visitation come on sarah realize where you're at this morning you were in the vision where's the green shirt put it on you're a player in this vision maybe you're a lot uh don't play that one don't put on that costume don't put on that unrighteousness amount maybe your sodom don't play on that unrighteousness put on the righteousness of abraham put on the righteousness of sarah [Applause] i'm not a part of the burning i'm not the cannon father i'm a part of the coming the coming son hallelujah amen oh yeah we got the power the beasts that rise up in revelation 13 which is america is described in this manner see in verse 13 13 13 and he does great wonders so he make a fire come down from heaven on the site on the earth in the sight of men that's atomic warfare and that's what this beast holds with her power and that's what this beast holds with her power but the main the main character of this prophecy the main earthly one is abraham but the real main character is the lord himself and i want you to know in this coming the lord himself shall descend from from heaven with a shout with a message hallelujah amen there would be a message in the last day to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers to get sarah to be leaving again [Applause] hallelujah oh glory to god and i want you to know that angel is still here the angel has not left amen now there could there are those times that you don't recognize him there but he makes it specific i'm gonna make myself visible i'm gonna come again i'm gonna return again according to the time of life and there's going to be a change start happening and the change begins first inwardly and winds up coming from the inward outward and if you don't get the inward change you'll never get the outward change are you with me you ever hear them say oh it doesn't matter what's on the outside what's on the inside it does it matters what's on the inside but it's going to show outside amen there the lord appears in human flesh now first he will take a prophet because the first phase of his coming is a message through a prophet are you with me amen so he will first come and appear in the human flesh discern sarah's heart and and call her by name the name that that is that has been changed by god in the chapter before right she was she was known as sarah now there's a lot of a lot of different uh ideas on what that name means but let's just let's just just for the sake of of it you know there's one there's one part that means baron and maybe she had become known all of these years after her affliction you know i can't i'm unable i i'm not able to do this but god had come down and changed her name and i want you to change your name from unable to able i want to change your name is somebody with me i want to change your name from baron to princess because i'm going to make you the head of a new race hallelujah i want you to know there is a groom who is the head of a new race who has taken a bride to be with him and one with him and see which him will be the head of a new race hallelujah and live in the millennium and rule and reign with christ a thousand years and then enjoy the whole blessing eternity in the new jerusalem sitting on the throne because he said he that overcometh in this age i will grant to sit with me and my throne even as i overcame and i sat down with my father in his throne [Music] now sarah the next thing you know there's a character in there and he's got to be in there it's kind of a strange story why would this even be in there abimelech why go down to gurir 40 miles after the visitation of the angel and go down and have this whole deal with abimelech you know why why is this such an important part to go in the bible when every part of the bible is important so why is this important why is it important that this young king gets google-eyed over a 90 year old woman come on boys let me find me a 90 year old woman bring up here and see if you google eye you'd run baby run that's the way it was sarah hunchback old wrinkled come on and all of a sudden she's the cat of the walk a young king looks out is she married no no that's my sister my lucky day that's just just what i needed a beautiful young brother i just maybe he had already 40 in the hiram but this one was better than all of them so i'll just add her to my collection but god comes with a in the middle of the night in a dream now now i'm going to tell you some things i personally look at hagar who gets two visitations by an angel she's a slave girl a bonds woman she is the mother of a wild race she is an egyptian but she gets an angel visitation twice then i look over here and i see abimelech and he has the spiritual dream and in this dream god speaks to him and says i know the integrity of your heart you wouldn't have taken taken this woman but that's my prophet and that's his wife and restore her now or you're just as good as a dead man and i'm thinking god if you'll talk to an old unrighteous well young unrighteous king you'll talk to a bombswoman a bondsmaid and a slave girl you'll surely talk to the son of god i'm open to you lord come by my way don't leave me out amen in the last days i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh my sons and my daughters they shall prophesy and then the old men will dream dreams and the young men shall see visions amen i'm pouring out my spirit upon all flesh and i say god if you're revealing yourself in flesh in this last day and i saw you did it in the prophet then here's my place lord come reveal yourself and me here's my despot come reveal yourself in my desk abraham gets her there back and said king wanted you i noticed something about you sarah the hump is gone i notice you don't have that stiff walk anymore like a little old lady and then you i noticed there's a spring in your step i noticed there's a chain starts happening hallelujah now god could not just go and make her a young woman again she'd have the same problem but he had to fix the problem and neither can you meet the lord in these bodies he's got to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hallelujah but i'm telling you by the prophecy sarah will receive a change the sun is coming to sarah the long-awaited sun is coming her way she's in the vision are you in the vision this morning are
