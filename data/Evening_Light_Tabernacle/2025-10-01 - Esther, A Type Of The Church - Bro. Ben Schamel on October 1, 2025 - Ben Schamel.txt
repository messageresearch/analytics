You're all I need. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. We can say that tonight. You're all that we need, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you for those specials. Thank you for the wonderful worship tonight. Amen. God is good. Amen. We have a brother Ben Shaml with us this evening. The Shaml family has been a great blessing around the world. There's several of them here tonight as well. We want to make you welcome. Amen. You may not know Brother Ben, but you know his God, don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And as he makes way, I just want to sing this song that we've sung many times, but every service I'm expecting, aren't you? Anticipating a move of God. The move of God. I'm expecting anticipating [Applause] a move of God. A move of God. Say it again. Say, I'm expecting anticipating a move of God. A move of God. And I'm expecting, [Music] anticipating [Applause] a move. Say a move. Oh, sing it again. Say, I'm expecting tonight, Lord. I'm expecting, anticipating. [Music] Oh, a move of God. A move of God. Again, I'm expecting anticipating a move. Oh, a move. Pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain. Oh, saturate my thirsty soul. Oh, come and fall. Oh, fill my cup again. Yes, Lord, heal my heart and make me whole. Oh, I need you now, Lord. Pour your spirit. Oh, yes. Just say that to me again with all your heart can sing. Pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain. Oh, saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall fresh on me. Fill my cup again. Oh, heal my heart and make me whole. [Music] I need you [Music] &gt;&gt; one more time cuz I'm expecting anticipating a move of God. A move of God. that I'm expecting anticipate. [Music] One more time, &gt;&gt; expecting anticipating &gt;&gt; a move of God move. God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just happy to be here. Again, our our family's been around, so we we know many of you and many of of you we may not know, but again, my name is Ben Shamal and I've got my family here with me. I just bring my amen corner with me. But if we come expecting, &gt;&gt; no matter who's preaching, I believe our God is still the same. &gt;&gt; So if you come expecting, if you come anticipating, then regardless of what your need is, regardless of how big it might be, &gt;&gt; our God has an answer for you. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? &gt;&gt; Well, we just sure want to say thank you to all the musicians and brother Tim and Timothy, Brother Joe, and the church here for having us out. We just feel honored and privileged to be here. We've been to many, many of the youth camps and kind of grown up with a lot of the young people here. And it's just a privilege to be standing before you. And honestly, the way I think about it is if I could stand before kings of the world or I could stand in front of the bride of Jesus Christ, I would rather preach to this group of people &gt;&gt; than I would to Trump himself. I would rather preach to you guys here tonight than any king across the world. &gt;&gt; And that's just how I feel about it. Well, we want to just jump into the word and uh if you don't mind turning with me in your scriptures to Revelations chapter 19 and verse 7. We'd like to draw our text from here and see where the Lord would lead. Revelations chapter 19 and verse 7. We're going to try to not put God in a box here this evening and just let him have his will and have his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter 19 and verse 7. And then we'll have you seated. And the scripture says, "Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready." Let's just bow our heads. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just come before you yet once more, Father. Lord, we're just thankful that we can gather ourselves together in this place and know that if we take you at your word, your word says that if there's two or three that are gathered together in your name, that you'll be here in our midst, Father. So, we're just clinging on to that scripture tonight, Father, and we're just going to claim that that you're going to be in our midst, Lord. So, whatever the needs are amongst your people, Father, we just ask that you would just minister to them. Help me to get myself out of the way, Father, that we might enter into the channel of the Holy Spirit. Lord, we just ask that you would just work in our lives, that you would just come down and speak to our situations, Lord. Any that are bound with chains, Father, we just ask that you would break them free tonight. We ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And you may be seated. So, we would like to take an interesting uh subject if we could from this text of Esther, a type of the church. You may think, well, Esther's not found in Revelations 19:7, but she is because Esther is a type of the church. Now, I don't believe that the scriptures is just a book of dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; But I believe that there is a lot more to the scripture than just a law of dos and don'ts. I don't believe that the scriptures is just a book of cute stories or or maybe of histories, but I believe that the power of God is wrapped up inside of the scriptures just waiting to be accepted by his bride. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that this evening? &gt;&gt; I believe that this is the opening of God's word to his bride. &gt;&gt; And it's been hidden in the scriptures all throughout time. And we are just now coming to the realization of the opening of the word by the opening of the seals through our prophet. So I don't believe that the book of Esther is just a romantic story. I know that we all we all been to Sunday school. We all heard plenty of sermons on the book of Esther. It's a very common story. But it's not just a little romantic story that we can get worked up about. But I believe that it is a perfect type of the church today. &gt;&gt; All right. We re realize that God hides himself in simplicity. and he'll reveal himself in the same. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon preaches a lot on Esther in the message, Marriage of the Lamb. He would say in one place he says, "Now, Israel was promised a promised land, but they had to fight for every inch of it." You see, wherever the souls of your foot tread upon, they have been given to you. God said to Joshua, it was all there. The land was there. God gave it to them, &gt;&gt; but they must fight for it. So, we can see promises in the scripture. And what I'm trying to get to you tonight is we can take the scripture. We can take the promises of God and we ourselves tonight can act on it. We don't have to wait for special meetings sometime. We don't have to wait for a for a youth camp. We don't have to wait for anything, you know, strange to happen in the church. But we can claim the promise of God tonight wherever you're standing in your situation. And you can claim the promise of God tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; We aren't basing our experience on emotion. &gt;&gt; And I praise God for that. We're not basing it on anything that we can work up. &gt;&gt; If we just worked up an emotion, we would be nothing more than the Pentecostal church. But we're looking to the revealing of God's word in this age. &gt;&gt; God himself expressing himself to you and through you. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. If God could be an expression to the world around, he would choose you. &gt;&gt; Man, if we could only catch the revelation of that, if God wanted to express himself to the world around, it would look like Ben Shame. It would look like brother Joe Adams. It would look like, &gt;&gt; come on, church. If God could express himself to the world, he would look just like you. &gt;&gt; He would look just like your neighbor sitting right next to you. Because that's how God decided to express himself through man. &gt;&gt; What hands does God have but yours? &gt;&gt; What ears does God have but your ears? &gt;&gt; God chose to work through you, his bride. &gt;&gt; But you're going to have to fight for it. &gt;&gt; This is not just a rose, you know, bed of ease. &gt;&gt; This isn't going to be an easy walk. If somebody said, "Oh, you just got to surrender your life to the Lord." And it's going to be easy, brother, from here on out, man. &gt;&gt; Well, you got one coming if that's what you think. &gt;&gt; This way is going to be a hard way. But we are going to receive our promised land. &gt;&gt; And when you identify a promise in the scriptures, you just latch on to that and you fight with it for every inch. It doesn't matter if you come against a wall of Jericho. You take the word of God and you continue forward. I love the story of Rahab and how those two spies came to her and you know what they knew that the power of Israel, the power of God was behind their words. &gt;&gt; Realize what they told her. They said, "When we come to this city, you just throw out that scarlet thread. &gt;&gt; And when those trumpets sound, all the walls will fall but yours. You and your family will be safe." Now, I want to show you what they did not do is they didn't go grab the demo saw and &gt;&gt; get that demo saw going and cut a control joint down on either side of the the the the the wall there. &gt;&gt; They didn't have to do that because they had a greater power than a demo saw. &gt;&gt; They knew that when they spoke, the power of God was behind it and all the walls of Jericho were going to fall down except for that Rahab's house. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they knew that the word that they spoke was backed up by heaven. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm talking about a Holy Ghost fil believer here. &gt;&gt; Somebody that's been adopted into this me into this this word revealed word of the age. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a hard walk, &gt;&gt; but there is power in the walk. &gt;&gt; So, you don't have to cower down to the devil anymore. &gt;&gt; You know, the devil sure likes to talk you down, doesn't he? And who does he use? He'll use your voice to talk yourself down. &gt;&gt; Now, we're not preaching psychology. &gt;&gt; We're preaching the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the devil will try to trick you up. He'll try to trip you up. &gt;&gt; He's the kind of friend that'll try to get you to do something against the law and then call the cops on you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He'll try to trick you into doing something and then he'll turn around and say, "Oh, look at what you did. &gt;&gt; You're such a bad Christian. Look at &gt;&gt; devil. You're the one trying to talk me into doing this. It's going to be a fight, &gt;&gt; but we have promises. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon goes on to say it's he said it's the same way about divine healing. Anybody need healing here tonight? &gt;&gt; I've got a little bit of bulldog faith tonight to say reach out and claim your promise and you'll be healed &gt;&gt; because there is power in the word of God. &gt;&gt; And what my scripture says is if there's two or three that are gathered here together in his name, he will be here in our midst. And I know one thing that Jesus doesn't show up anywhere without a purpose. &gt;&gt; When he showed up at the grave of Lazarus, he came for a purpose. &gt;&gt; People thought he was four days late, but when he stepped in front of that grave, &gt;&gt; he came with purpose. &gt;&gt; He didn't just come to cry and sob that his friend Lazarus had died. But where Jesus is, there also is life. So if Jesus is in the building tonight, then you can reach out and grab hold of that life and apply it to your situation. &gt;&gt; I just believe it just like the Bible says it. &gt;&gt; But it's the same way about divine healing. He says God has an amazing grace to save you and he will do it. But you'll have to fight every inch of the way. &gt;&gt; You must fight if we must reign. He says, &gt;&gt; "So we fight. We find out that the bride has to make herself ready. Be willing to lay aside every weight that so easily besets us that we might run the race with patience that's set before us. We must lay them aside ourselves. We can't say, "Oh, God, you come and you lay hands, you you lay them aside for us." We just got to do that ourselves. &gt;&gt; There is a work for us to do. God's not going to try to force you into a pipe and pull you out the other side, Brother Brandham said, and then call you an overcomer, &gt;&gt; but God rather is going to give you a situation that looks too high for you to overcome and then give you the power to overcome it. &gt;&gt; But you have to make the decision yourself to overcome. &gt;&gt; You have to go against the devil fighting every inch. not going to be easy, &gt;&gt; but we have a promise &gt;&gt; that we are going to overcome. And if the scripture says that there will be an overcomer, &gt;&gt; then I'm going to say that somebody is going to fulfill that scripture. &gt;&gt; If there's going to be a powerful church, then somebody has to fill that scripture. &gt;&gt; And I say, why won't it be me? Why can't it be us here tonight? &gt;&gt; I believe that God is the same. In Hebrews 13:8, it says that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So let's just prove God that he's the same today &gt;&gt; as he was back then. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But we see in this story of Esther, her parents had died. She grew up an orphan. And Queen Vashy, of course, she doesn't come to the king's call. So she gets kicked out of the kingdom and the king starts looking for a new bride and she gets brought in. And I thought it was interesting as I was reading this the last couple days is that the king had seven chamberlins. Interesting. There's, you see, God won't let you starve. God, we've we've been reading this Bible over and over and over for seven church ages. &gt;&gt; But God's going to like like Ruth, right, and Boaz, he's going to drop a little extra here. &gt;&gt; Drop a little extra there. And so Esther finds one of those servants of the king &gt;&gt; and he begins to tend to her more than any of the others. Why? &gt;&gt; Because there was something different about Esther. &gt;&gt; You see, they had gathered up maybe even thousands of young women to come into the king &gt;&gt; all over different countries, different races, different all kinds of different women. But there was something about Esther. You see, while all of those other women were getting their earrings on and making their makeup just right and trying to dress just perfect, what was Esther doing? &gt;&gt; She identified that the servant of God or servant of the king? &gt;&gt; Jumping ahead of myself a little here. She identified that the servant of the king would know a lot about the king. &gt;&gt; If he's a chamberlain, then he must know the secrets of the king. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Let's put on our thinking caps here. &gt;&gt; But one of these seven chamberlins starts revealing to her the mind of the king. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Well, this is what he likes. &gt;&gt; He likes you to dress a certain certain way." You know, he could have told all those other women the same exact thing and they wouldn't have done what the Chamberlain said because they said, "I don't think I look that good in that long dress. &gt;&gt; I don't think I look that good with my long hair." &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel weird when I go play basketball and I don't have shorts on. &gt;&gt; Oh, boys, we got to preach over here, too. &gt;&gt; You see, but they were trying to find out what the king liked. We have to find out what our king likes. We have to lay aside every weight that so easily besets us. We have to lay aside all of these worldly things and we have to focus on what does the king want from us &gt;&gt; because it had nothing to do with Esther. My life has nothing to do with me and it's got all to do with him. &gt;&gt; Your life has nothing to do with you and it's got all to do with Jesus Christ because it is a love affair. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what Esther identified &gt;&gt; is the chamberlain is going to know the very secrets of the king. &gt;&gt; Just like Isaac and Eleazar Rebecca, she says, "Ezer, tell me more. &gt;&gt; You can't give me enough of this message. I mean, you can't tell me about Isaac enough &gt;&gt; because I'm learning the very secrets &gt;&gt; of the king. You see, our prophet came on the scene and he said, "You should be able to talk with somebody for about two minutes and be able to identify if they have the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; What is he telling us? He's saying this message has now unlocked &gt;&gt; the very nature of God &gt;&gt; to the bride &gt;&gt; because now you can identify it. You can identify the nature of God in someone else. Brother, if I was a preacher like brother Joe, I'd be jumping down these I might I might hurdle this banister, brother. &gt;&gt; We have access &gt;&gt; to be able to recognize the very nature of God. And that's how brother Brandham could get so worked up about a bubbling spring. &gt;&gt; That's how he could get so worked up about looking at the sunrise. That's how he could get so worked up about the tree in the fall. It would turn leaves and it would fall down because he saw the very nature of God living in nature and living in himself and living in the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It had now unlocked the very nature of God to the bride. And it is hidden to all of the unbelievers. They cannot see it. &gt;&gt; You know, this rapture that they've been talking about, they've been probing and probing and probing &gt;&gt; and they have no idea what they're talking about. They think they're smart, but they miss it every time. And it's because they keep probing at the word of God, and they have no authority to do so. They're pursuing &gt;&gt; because they are ignoring what the Chamberlain says about the secrets of God. &gt;&gt; Let me just preach to you this tonight. &gt;&gt; We can no longer discard the secrets of the king. We cannot discard them. So if brother Brandham says that God likes you to have long hair, sisters, &gt;&gt; why does it matter what you look like after that? &gt;&gt; As long as the king likes it. &gt;&gt; Are you trying to please all the peasants that are out there that the king is over? &gt;&gt; Or are you trying to please the king himself? Boy, we could go a lot of different ways here, &gt;&gt; but we must line ourselves up with the scripture. &gt;&gt; Regardless of how I feel, regardless of what I think, &gt;&gt; regardless of how I believe, it must line up with the scripture. It must line up with the message. &gt;&gt; I believe, let me just tell you what I believe. I believe Brother Brandham was a very special person. &gt;&gt; I believe Brother Brandham was a prophet. I believe he was the seventh age messenger. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that the Holy Ghost was with us for six and a half church ages. But I do believe that the Holy Ghost is going to be with us throughout the entirety of the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't leave us when brother Brandham went into the ground. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost has continued. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't go into the ground with brother Brandham, but the Holy Ghost continued and is living in you and I. So the same authority that brother Brandham had &gt;&gt; can be behind you &gt;&gt; because we serve the same God. &gt;&gt; All right. Hopefully that's okay. But she was not looking after another man. &gt;&gt; She was not falling in love with the chamberlain asking him what he liked. &gt;&gt; She was asking what the king liked. &gt;&gt; She would ask him, "How would you want me to dress? Would you want me to have makeup on? I don't believe that Esther had any makeup on. &gt;&gt; I don't believe she had any earrings on. &gt;&gt; Might as well preach on tattoos, too. &gt;&gt; There's people in church that think it's okay to go get tattoos. And there's only one scripture on tattoos. But you believe Brother Brandham when he preaches against makeup, and that's a temporary thing. Then you're going to go scar your body with an in Oh, anyways, I better get off there. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "This church of the Pentecostal move ought to be so bound up together with the power of Almighty God until the very life of Jesus Christ would be reflected in it." &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be such a testimony that you're walking down the street and people say, I kind of wonder if he is Jesus Christ incarnate. Not the fullness now. I'm not talking about that. But if you could make Christ so real to people &gt;&gt; that they might wonder. &gt;&gt; That's how close brother Brandham was. &gt;&gt; People would do that to him. They would say, "Oh, I I think that brother Brandham is Jesus Christ." He wasn't. He was a prophet, &gt;&gt; but he had a portion of that Holy Spirit living inside of him. and so can every believer. &gt;&gt; This this message isn't just for brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; This message is so much more than God send a prophet. &gt;&gt; This message is so much more than you got to believe this way or you got to dress this way or you got to act this certain way or you got to come to work on or come to church on Sundays and Wednesdays. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. &gt;&gt; This message is the unveiling of God &gt;&gt; personally to you. This message is that that that that uh curtain being rent into &gt;&gt; so you can now enter into communion with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what this message is. &gt;&gt; So the king's servant had equipped us with the things to get us ready. Brother Brandham says, "Oh, so many times we say, if the Lord would just take this evil spirit from me, this drinking or gambling or lying or stealing, I'll serve him." It's a trick from the devil. &gt;&gt; He's trying to get you to be perfect before you'll start serving God. That's not how it works. &gt;&gt; When you're in your lowest state, &gt;&gt; that's when God can do his moving. When you feel as weak as you've ever felt weak, &gt;&gt; that's when God can move on the scene. &gt;&gt; God didn't come to the to the to the righteous, &gt;&gt; but he came to the sinners, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But even if we could achieve righteousness, which we can't, but let's say we could achieve righteousness, we we could be the perfect man. The scripture says that our righteousness is as filthy rags. So even then we could not rely on our own righteousness. &gt;&gt; We're completely relying on him. &gt;&gt; He says, "But that's up to you." See, there's something that you have to do. There's a part for you to play. &gt;&gt; And so many times people are so worried about getting in the flesh. If I could just preach here a minute. People get so worried about being in the flesh that they hinder the moving of God. But I have sure seen the other side of it where people get in the flesh and sit there on the like a bump on the log and resist the moving of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I would rather scream and shout and run the aisles &gt;&gt; and be in the flesh than sit there like a bump on the log and hinder the moving of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I would rather have a wildfire &gt;&gt; than no fire at all." &gt;&gt; But what we're doing is we're trying to paint a fire so it looks like we got a fire, but we don't really have a fire. That's what I'm afraid of with with with so many message churches these days is they've got a painted fire. They know exactly what to wear. They know exactly how to do their hair. They know the things to say. They know the things to do. But they don't have a fire down in their soul. They don't have anything pushing them like that brook that's bubbling up and making them share the gospel &gt;&gt; that's making them talk to the people at school. That's making them talk to the people at work. That's bubbling out of them. Because this message is real. &gt;&gt; And this message is for a lot more people than we think it is. &gt;&gt; We hear it preached that the bride is so small sometimes. I think we get so selective in who we Well, we wouldn't want them in the bride. &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to share with them the message. &gt;&gt; Especially now with this whole Charlie Kirk thing going on. And boy, the devil is sly. This Charlie Kirk thing happens and it seems like there's revival going around and then, oh, the rapture's going to happen. Oh, isn't that a coincidence? And then it doesn't happen. So now they're all confused. That's just the devil. &gt;&gt; But we had a message come &gt;&gt; that makes all it reveals all the mysteries of God. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you, church, the very things that the world is looking for, the bride has. &gt;&gt; The world is looking for joy, &gt;&gt; and they're trying to find happiness in all of these worldly things, but they have no pure joy. But you have pure joy &gt;&gt; because we have the word of God. &gt;&gt; Even what the devil wanted, you have. &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me back that up. &gt;&gt; For 6,000 years, the devil has been clawing, grinding, working because he wanted to be equal with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Since before the beginning, he was trying. He was made the angel above all angels. &gt;&gt; He was ahead of all the music. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be made equal with God. &gt;&gt; So, he's been working for all these thousands of years down through all of the ages trying to get to that spot. And then he's jealous like the 11th hour worker because here we come in at the seventh age. And my scripture says that we are now made joint hes with Jesus Christ. What does that mean? Brother Brandham said that everything that God was, he poured into his &gt;&gt; church. Everything God was, he poured into Jesus Christ. Everything that Jesus Christ was, he poured into his church. Not just a building down the way, but in his church. &gt;&gt; So now you are made joint hes with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. which is the very thing the devil has been trying to get to over thousands and thousands of years. And then we wonder why the devil hates us so much. Because the very thing that you have, the joint air membership with Jesus Christ, Satan has been trying to get to this whole entire time. And here we come and we snatched it out of his hands. And he's jealous because we have power over the devil. &gt;&gt; We are joint hes with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah. I think that'd make a Methodist shout. &gt;&gt; That ought to certainly make a a message believer shout if we could just get that revelation &gt;&gt; that the message has brought the unveiling of God to me personally, to you personally &gt;&gt; that we can step on the head of this serpent. &gt;&gt; Oh, but you don't understand, brother Ben. I'm just such a a bad Christian. Well, let's say you're the the feet, the skin on the bottom of the feet, the bride of Jesus Christ's body. You know what the job of the skin on the bottom of the feet is? It's not to slap him in the face. That's the hand's job. It's not to pat somebody on the back. That's the hand's job. But the job of the foot is to go up to the devil and to stomp on his head. And that's the job that many of us have. And how do you identify that when you're in the dirtiest place that you've ever found yourself in? &gt;&gt; Then you can turn to almighty God. &gt;&gt; And you can say, "Lord, I am nothing in my own, but I need you to come. &gt;&gt; Give me power over the enemy in the name of Jesus Christ." So many times we pray in the name of Jesus Christ and we have no idea what we're talking about. Brother Joe, &gt;&gt; I'm talking about real power. Not talking about benny hinn power. I'm talking about real power of God. &gt;&gt; Where you say in the name of Jesus Christ, brother Brandham came and preached ambassadors &gt;&gt; where an ambassador is representing a country. &gt;&gt; He has all the power of a country behind him &gt;&gt; and the power behind him will take hold of what he is speaking. So when we're praying and we say in the name of Jesus Christ, do you understand what you're saying? &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the healer of all healers, &gt;&gt; the chain breaker, the mighty deliverer &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. There is no other name. No other name. &gt;&gt; We sing it so often. You know, sometimes I think we hear such mighty preaching. And I've been in many, many, many meetings with brother Tim, Brother Timothy, Brother Joe, and all these great brothers. And we hear such great preaching so often that I think sometimes it just becomes normalized to us, and we become numb to the word of God. We become numb to the power of God. We become numb to the spoken word of God for our age. &gt;&gt; And we don't fully grasp what God is trying to get to us through the spoken word because we just come every Sunday, we come every Wednesday, and it just becomes normal to us. But if we can make it a personal revelation, &gt;&gt; oh man, I remember when it became a personal revelation to me, it changes who you are. &gt;&gt; You're not trying to change from the outside in. That's always a battle. And brother Brandham said, you're going to be the most miserable Christian &gt;&gt; on the face of the planet, most miserable human being on the face of the planet if you're trying to change from the outside in. But if you're trying to change, if if if you get your soul &gt;&gt; changed, &gt;&gt; then you'll change from the inside out &gt;&gt; and then you're just bear wool like that sheep. &gt;&gt; But there's a part that we have to play. And sometimes you don't feel up to it. Many times the part you have to play comes when you don't feel like a Christian. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you just feel low, that's when you need to reach out and praise him. &gt;&gt; We hear it all the time. And You just not reach up your hand and praise him. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? You're creating an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said that that that that the Christian has the power to go speak a world and go live on it. Now, he was talking about atmospheres and he was just saying that talking about well, if we were to refer to uh the Andaluvian world and the world we're in now and the one to come, he said it's not the earth that changes, but it's the atmospheres around it. &gt;&gt; So, if you want to go speak a world, brother Joe, and go live on it, then I say speak the word over your family. &gt;&gt; Speak the word over your home. &gt;&gt; Then speak the word over your situation. And then you'll create a new world to live on. Not some world out there by the moon. But it is a world right here that you're living in that you can speak the word and you can take authority over the devil and you can stomp on his head and say, "Devil, you have no place in my family. You have no place in my life. &gt;&gt; And I am creating a world through the atmosphere &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit to go live on." Brother says, And why Christ speak? He says, "I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God until the devil don't know what to do with him." &gt;&gt; That's right. Just obeyed God so completely till the devil says, "Oh my, get away." &gt;&gt; Well, I want I want that kind of power. &gt;&gt; I want to live so close to God &gt;&gt; where the devil gets sick of me. &gt;&gt; Where the devil just says, "Oh my goodness, here comes Ben Shamal. He's rolling out of bed in the morning. Run. &gt;&gt; We have the ability. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon goes on marriage of the lamb. He says, "And we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church. and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle. And they have the material, listen close, on earth now to make themselves ready. &gt;&gt; If you notice, it said she has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; I need to read that again. They have the material on earth now to make themselves ready. &gt;&gt; The chamberlain, the servant of God, has now given you the material &gt;&gt; that you need &gt;&gt; to make yourself ready for a rapture. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for an eighth age messenger. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another message. We're not looking for another great preacher. But what we have been given is all that we need to make ourselves ready for that rapture. &gt;&gt; This word is enough. &gt;&gt; This word is enough to get you over your situation. &gt;&gt; This word is enough to get you broken from those chains. &gt;&gt; This word is enough. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I believe it anyways. &gt;&gt; This word is enough. &gt;&gt; Continuing on with our story here. But Esther required nothing but what he the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed. And then Esther comes to a a hazeris on the 10th month of the seventh year. Here's another drop for you. Revelation 10:7 Malachi 4:5. There you go. We're going to meet the king in the age of Revelations 10 7 &gt;&gt; and at the voice of the seventh angel &gt;&gt; when he begins to sound. &gt;&gt; It's a Wednesday. I'll keep moving. So Morai goes on and he hears about these two that are going to try to assassinate the king and he turns them in and Esther hears about it. She tells the king nothing came of it. So many times we think our good work works should re we should receive a good reward for it. Sometimes things go unnoticed. You think &gt;&gt; but God sees. So then Hmon is promoted. He's way up there. He's God of this evil age, maybe we'll say. And he goes strutting around. He goes, "You know what? I have made everyone bow. I walk through the streets and everyone bows." And maybe he's riding his horse on his high horse one day and he just sees an evening light tabernacle way out there and it just drives him nuts because everybody else is bowing. Brother Joe, you look out into the world, everybody's bowing. Pentecostal churches are bowing. The Baptist churches are bowing. The Catholic church is the mother of them all. Everybody is bowing to the pressures of Satan except &gt;&gt; one. The bride of Jesus Christ will never bow. &gt;&gt; Oh, and it just burns and it grinds on Hmon. He just hates it so much. So he goes home and he complains to his wife. Brother Brandon say he goes back and starts complaining to Jezebel like devil in hell. He goes back to his wife and starts complaining and she says, "Oh, you you could fix that. You just need to go and build gallows 50 cubits high." Interesting. That's seven stories high. The devil wants to make you an example. He wants to hang you up out here so the whole world can see that you can't overcome. &gt;&gt; He wants to hang you up here so people think that this message is not enough. &gt;&gt; He wants to hang you up there so people think that oh that message is just a cult. &gt;&gt; I grew up in a youth group where there's very very very few if any outside of my family that are left in the message. &gt;&gt; Satan wants to hang them up and say, "Hey, see &gt;&gt; message obviously can't be right. &gt;&gt; They can't hold young people. I'm looking at young people &gt;&gt; and I believe that there's going to be young people and old people &gt;&gt; that are going to rise up &gt;&gt; that aren't going to take this hanging from Haymon. &gt;&gt; Better slow down here. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to build a foundation, Brother Joe. &gt;&gt; It drove him absolutely nuts. Do not be ashamed of this message. If everybody else is bowing, stand. &gt;&gt; If your neighbor bows, stand. &gt;&gt; If your wife bows, stand. If your family bows, stand. If your church bows, stand. &gt;&gt; So, he builds these gallows and the devil thought that he could get one over on them. But we flip over to Esther chapter 6. I want to read verses seven and nine. 7-9. And Hmon answered the king, "For the man whom the king delightth to honor," of course, the king's asking him, "What should be done to a man that the king would like to honor?" And he says, "Let a royal apparel be brought, which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head. And let this apparel and the horse be delivered into the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man with whom the king delightth to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, thus shall it be done to the man who the king delightth to honor. So he's promoting what he thought was himself. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't we do that sometimes? We just build it up and then just step in. I've done it. I hate it when that happens. But here's Hmon and he he he thinks all the all this glory is going to come unto me. &gt;&gt; All this majesty is going to come unto me. Isn't that how the devil works? &gt;&gt; Oh, we've seen preachers go that way many times where they start preaching themselves instead of the message and it goes wrong. &gt;&gt; But I want you to to to notice something here. Here's where I wanted to get tonight. If you don't get anything else from what I'm saying tonight, get this. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; At the opening of the book, the roles between Hmon and Mori were reversed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At the opening of the book, the roles between Hmon and Mori were reversed. &gt;&gt; I feel like running right now. Mori used to be a servant. &gt;&gt; Mori was in the ash heap. &gt;&gt; Mori had no prestige at all. &gt;&gt; Hmon thought he had it all. Hmon was living next to the king. Hmon thought he was over the entire thing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But at the opening of the word in this last age in the seventh church age, we listen to our chamberlain and we heard what the king wants. And at the opening of the word, the roles are reversed. The devil has no authority. The devil cannot overcome you because the roles have been reversed. And now you are no longer getting stomped on by the enemy. But now you can stomp on the head of the enemy because now we have the opening of the word. It is no longer a closed book, but your name has been revealed. The seven seals have been revealed. &gt;&gt; Your name is in the book. Your name was in the book the entire time. And Mori never knew it. He didn't know where he should be living. Come on. &gt;&gt; But the example that devil wanted to make of the of the believer and hang him up on the gallows now turned around on him. &gt;&gt; You can throw anything devil at this bride and we shall overcome &gt;&gt; because we have a promise that's written in scripture that there shall be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; And if there's going to be an overcomer, then that's going to be me. That's going to be you. That's going to be the body of Jesus Christ that is overcoming in this last age. It may look dark. It may look hard. We may have to fight every inch of the way, but the roles have been reversed. We're not waiting for the rapture. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for the rapture for the roles to be reversed. &gt;&gt; But it has already opened up the word so the roles can be reversed tonight. So let me ask you, what is your situation? &gt;&gt; The devil has no hold on a believer. &gt;&gt; Oh, he can strap you down with chains. &gt;&gt; He can put you into a prison. He can put you into the innermost prison like he did with Paul and Silas and Peter and all the disciples. Those chains will never hold you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If physical chains cannot hold them, &gt;&gt; then spiritual chains will not hold us when we have the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach to you young people. You need to dig into this word. &gt;&gt; You need to realize for yourself preachers can get up here and we can scream and shout and we can preach with everything that's within us. But until you get the revelation that this is the opening of the word, it is Jesus Christ coming down into your flesh &gt;&gt; and it is personally revealed to you, then it will do us no good. &gt;&gt; But at the opening of the word, &gt;&gt; the roles were reversed. So the devil's eating some humble pie at an evening light church service. &gt;&gt; You know what? All those streets that Hmon had walked down riding his high horse, &gt;&gt; making everybody bow. Now he's walking back those same streets &gt;&gt; saying there &gt;&gt; he's an overcomer. &gt;&gt; They're wearing the king's crown. They're wearing the royal apparel. This is coming from Hmon's mouth now. &gt;&gt; Oh, devil don't like it. &gt;&gt; Do you realize this is incredible? This is all in the book of Esther. &gt;&gt; We haven't even touched Genesis or Revelation yet. Hardly. I guess I opened with it. But Hmon is going down these streets going back and forth proclaiming the glory of the believer. The devil is trapped &gt;&gt; into giving God the glory. &gt;&gt; He may make your situation look so uh impossible. &gt;&gt; I've seen situations where they're bad and people trust but they get worse and that trust begins to fade. But when that situation then looks impossible, brother Brandham said when the doctors have done all they can do, that's when the great physician can move &gt;&gt; because we serve a living God. He's no dead god. He's not some trinket on the wall somewhere. &gt;&gt; He's not in a grave somewhere. &gt;&gt; We serve a living God. &gt;&gt; All right, let's move on. You know, sometimes I think we wait as a church. Maybe this is me. My experience when I was younger is so many times we get caught up in the emotion of preaching. We listen for buzzwords. Can I just say that like does that make sense? To rejoice or to to or to or or to shout or to rejoice. But if we could just take a moment as these brothers are preaching from here on out and really focus on what they're saying &gt;&gt; and we can dissect their message, not just what they're saying word by word with buzzwords, but what they're what they're what they're saying &gt;&gt; to where we can catch that very nature of God in the message &gt;&gt; and then apply it to our lives. You better look out, devil. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said when the bride begins to recognize who she is, &gt;&gt; that she's an invincible army. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that he can do to stop it. Pass my 45 minutes already, brother. All right, I'm going to try to wrap it up before too long. Let me tell you a story. Esther come Esther comes to the king. She says, "I have a request." and she asks to meet with him over dinner. But the the king said, "Ask in abundance up to half of the kingdom." So many times I think we can we could take a lesson from this that we try to limit God so much &gt;&gt; because Esther only asked for and she had a purpose but she only asked for dinner. &gt;&gt; She had up to half the kingdom. So let me tell you a little story that I heard one time. This man from uh California flies over to Qar and he's teaching a king how to golf. Do you golf? I hope it's better than mine. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. But he teaches this king to golf and the king says, "I'm so thankful for you teaching me how to golf and get into a handicap of whatever." He says, "What can I give you out of a a token of love or appreciation?" And the instructor said, "Well, I you know, I collect golf clubs. So, if you wanted to get me one, you know, I could, you know, I love golf clubs." He said, "Okay." So, the man flies back home and the whole time he's thinking, "I wonder what kind of club I'm going to get. Maybe it's a golden plated. I mean, this guy was rich. He's a king, right? Maybe he can get a golden putter. Maybe he'll get a chipper with diamonds up the handle. Who knows? He's thinking big." &gt;&gt; Well, this club never comes in for a long, long time. And then he gets a letter in the mail and it's like a big first class letter and he opens it up, brother Joe, and he goes, "What's this?" And he looks and it's a certificate and says, "You are now the proud owner of the most expensive golf club in California." &gt;&gt; He was now the proud owner of the entire 18 holes &gt;&gt; golf club in California. Why? Because kings think different. &gt;&gt; Our king thinks different. Our king is not limited, brother, by our thinking. But when we go to ask for something, I'm telling you, bride of Jesus Christ, ask for big things because a golf club to our king is nothing. Ask up to half of the kingdom. Ask what do you have need of? Do you need a little putter or do you want an entire golf course? The clubhouse, it had all the sand pits included. It had all the ponds included. It had all the fish included. It had all of the golf clubs inside of the clubhouse included. If you need a promise for your family, ask. Ask big things. Cuz our king thinks different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just stand. &gt;&gt; What do you have need of tonight? &gt;&gt; What's your situation? The rules have been reversed. &gt;&gt; What golf club do you want? &gt;&gt; You want a putter? You want a driver? Or do you want the one in California? Or you want the one in the Bahamas? Or you want the one in Qar? &gt;&gt; Ask little bride. &gt;&gt; Because you and Jesus Christ are joint hes. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, man. &gt;&gt; It's not an emotional workup. It's the opening of God's word for our age that can live inside of you. &gt;&gt; Are you worthy? No one is worthy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But do you have the position? You have the position. [Music] &gt;&gt; Maybe I could say it this way. Authority can be greater than power. &gt;&gt; If the Incredible Hulk is out there trying to stop a school bus at a four-way stop and the Incredible Hulk by his power stops that school bus &gt;&gt; crunches the whole thing, destruction everywhere. But you let a little police officer about my size &gt;&gt; with a little badge &gt;&gt; stand up into the middle of that intersection and raise his hand. &gt;&gt; All the devils and pale I mean the big school bus is going to come to a screeching halt &gt;&gt; because there's an authority. &gt;&gt; The police officer cannot stop a school bus. You cannot stop the devil. &gt;&gt; You're relying in the badge. &gt;&gt; You're relying in the authority that's been given to you as a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what we're saying? &gt;&gt; I know it's Wednesday night, &gt;&gt; but I believe that there are overcomers at this church tonight. &gt;&gt; I don't know what your situation is. I don't know the majority of you, &gt;&gt; but God knows. &gt;&gt; All we can do as ministers is try to to find the the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It takes God to speak to your heart. &gt;&gt; So maybe he's been try to to come here, little Esther. &gt;&gt; Maybe the king would like to spend a little time with you. Maybe he would like to give you something and all you got to do is ask. Let's just bow our heads. If there's anybody here that that needs just a just needs a touch from the Lord. [Music] Whatever the situation is, no matter how dirty you feel, no matter how low you feel, how no matter how much of a Christian you don't feel like, Jesus Christ never shows up without a purpose. And his purpose here tonight is to swing by your way and to touch your need. Don't pitchfork this to somebody else, but you just need to reach out and accept it. If you need healing, reach out, accept your healing. If you need chains broken, then it's time that we reach up like that little police officer and we begin to lift up our hands. We might as well begin to praise him. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just come before you tonight. Lord, I just ask that you would just take this broken up message, Lord, and that you would just take something good out of it. Father, we believe that we're in the bride's revival now. The bride's revival is not a uh an emotional workup. It's not a catchphrase, but Lord, we believe that the bride's revival is the opening of the word [Music] and it being personally revealed to us. So Lord, we just ask that you would just be with each and every one that's here tonight. There's maybe grave situations, Father. We know that we can do nothing, but we're only relying on you. We just ask you to move now. Show yourself God to the people tonight. Father for your scripture says you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. We thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Say, sing something softly here. &gt;&gt; I just want to open it up. If you if you need prayer, &gt;&gt; maybe we can open it up. It's a Wednesday night, but I don't believe that you have to come up to the altar. I believe the altar's in your heart. &gt;&gt; If you're backsliden or you find yourself stale with the word of God, &gt;&gt; let's make that right tonight. &gt;&gt; We need to live like the rapture could happen at any time. &gt;&gt; We got to live every day like the rapture is coming. We don't have to bow down to the devil any longer. &gt;&gt; I don't care what he's been telling you. &gt;&gt; The rules have been reversed. God bless you. Feels like you're running [Music] and you will never win. But I don't know who told you you could not make it. I don't know who told you. You could not take it. I don't know who told you. It's time that you quit. Oh, my God says wait. It ain't over yet. Somebody here oh needs an answer to the question fears and the lies. Oh somebody.
