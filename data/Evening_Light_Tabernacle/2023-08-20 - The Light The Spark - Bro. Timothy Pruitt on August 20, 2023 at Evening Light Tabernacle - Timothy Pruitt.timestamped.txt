[50:34] we sure appreciate him I look at him as
[50:36] Caleb amen is give me my Mountain he he

[51:05] victories take place and amen I enjoy
[51:09] that that that that that kind of service
[51:11] and so amen this morning we we want to
[51:14] take a thought on the light the spark
[51:17] amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 11.
[51:21] it says but if the spirit of him that
[51:24] raised up Jesus
[51:25] from the dead dwelling you he that
[51:28] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[51:31] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[51:34] spirit that dwelleth in you amen we let
[51:38] you be seated this morning
[51:41] I got a little bit of uh he probably
[51:44] heard it and brother Mike as well but a
[51:46] little Camp hangover
[51:47] amen her voice is a little wore out but
[51:50] amen we uh we're sure thankful for all
[51:53] the victories and things that God gave
[51:55] us and and a lot of testimonies and
[51:58] things of God's changing power that
[52:01] working working in our young people and
[52:03] I I tell you I ever everyone is a right
[52:05] to their own personal Revival
[52:08] amen I believe that we ought to ought to
[52:11] uh fight for that with everything that
[52:14] we have that everyone can come to that
[52:16] place and that moment in their lives
[52:18] that they can meet the burning bush for
[52:20] themselves because that Burning Bush is
[52:22] still Among Us they didn't live and die
[52:24] with Moses but that was Jesus amen the
[52:27] angel of God that would come down and
[52:29] and would would start a bush on fire and
[52:32] and change a man and change and brother
[52:35] Adam said it changed the world forever
[52:37] think about that one man one encounter
[52:40] with God it changed the known world of
[52:43] that time and I I believe that we can
[52:45] also have that same encounter with God
[52:48] Amen you know as we look in the
[52:50] scriptures here we we look at this word
[52:52] quick and we know what that means it
[52:54] means to be made alive it means to be
[52:57] brought to life it means to be to be
[52:59] living and it's it's a spark it's
[53:01] something that that it comes into a
[53:04] place that was once dead but now it
[53:06] lives so it takes something to do that
[53:08] it don't just happen but if you find
[53:11] something that's dead and it comes to
[53:13] life something took place on the inside
[53:16] of that and Jesus you know he had the
[53:18] word of his resurrection he could look
[53:20] into the scriptures and he could find I
[53:22] will not suffer my Holy One to see
[53:24] corruption because he and he knew in
[53:27] that that it would take three days or 72
[53:29] hours for corruption to set him
[53:31] therefore he spoke and he said if you
[53:33] destroy this temple in three days I'll
[53:35] raise it up again amen he if there had
[53:39] been no spark there had been no Dynamics
[53:41] there would have been no quickening
[53:43] there would have been no Resurrection
[53:45] the word is not a dead word it's a
[53:48] Living Word it changes people it
[53:50] delivers people it heals people amen
[53:53] it's not just something that we get up
[53:55] and we just say a few good things but
[53:57] we're looking for the word to come and
[53:59] have an effect on people's lives the
[54:01] word to come and to change the situation
[54:03] that we're living and we look at Moses
[54:05] and we see the word that it was spoke
[54:07] there around that burning bush has said
[54:09] let my people go that word brought a
[54:12] change and they changed the whole Known
[54:14] World of that day it changed Egypt from
[54:17] a superpower to nothing it changed the
[54:20] children of Israel from slaves Amen to
[54:22] free men and women of God that they were
[54:24] born to be amen the word always comes
[54:27] and when the spirit gets in that word it
[54:29] calls a quickening it causes a spark it
[54:32] causes something to take place and it
[54:35] causes something to a change to take
[54:37] place in Psalms 107 he said when they
[54:40] Cried unto the Lord in their trouble
[54:41] verse 19 he saved them out of their
[54:44] distresses and he sent his word but that
[54:47] word had an effect and it said he healed
[54:50] them amen he sent his word and healed
[54:53] them and delivered them from their
[54:55] destructions amen oh that man would
[54:58] praise the Lord for his goodness and for
[55:01] his wonderful Works to the children of
[55:02] men so when his word comes and if it's
[55:05] his word with power it will have an
[55:07] effect Bank it will drive out sickness
[55:10] it will drive out sin it will drive out
[55:13] unbelief it will change a person as we
[55:16] saw in Moses it changed him from a 80
[55:18] year old man backslidden on the back of
[55:20] the desert but he met that spark he met
[55:23] that Pillar of Fire for himself and his
[55:26] soul changed his thinking that where he
[55:28] would take a mule and he would take a
[55:30] rod and he would take a his wife and
[55:32] children and he would gather them
[55:34] together and he would go down to Egypt
[55:36] and if you ask him what he was going to
[55:37] do he'd tell you I'm going down to Egypt
[55:40] to take over amen because he knew what
[55:42] it was like to try it on his own decree
[55:45] in his own word he had heard the word
[55:46] before he had he had heard the word that
[55:49] he was the deliverer that the word had
[55:50] been promised that for 400 years my
[55:53] children would be in Egypt and and they
[55:55] would be in slavery but after that I
[55:57] will come and I will deliver them he
[55:59] heard all of that but until he met that
[56:01] spark for himself until he met that spot
[56:04] in his life to where he said at this
[56:06] moment it changed me and now it's not
[56:09] going to overcome me but I'm going to
[56:11] overcome it amen we can we can brother
[56:13] Brown said to Egypt where he said
[56:15] something along these lines and there's
[56:17] a paraphrase in here he said Egypt will
[56:19] either amen either uh dampen your faith
[56:22] or or destroy your faith or your faith
[56:25] will conquer it one or the other amen if
[56:27] you'll meet God for yourself God will
[56:30] come on the scene for you and will
[56:32] change your whole world it'll change all
[56:35] that is around you to change your home
[56:37] it'll it'll change your family it'll
[56:39] change your life amen think about that
[56:41] Moses went down there it was the same
[56:44] mule it was the same wife it was the
[56:46] same children it was the same Rod but
[56:48] now he had met somebody for himself and
[56:51] he met the spirit that was behind the
[56:53] worm he meant the power that was laying
[56:56] in there so this word has a movement to
[56:59] it it has breath it has life it it's
[57:02] when it's anointed by the spirit of God
[57:04] now we can look in second Corinthians 3
[57:06] and verse 2 and it says here your
[57:09] Epistles written of our heart known in
[57:11] red of all men for as much as you're
[57:13] manifestly declared to be the Epistles
[57:16] of Christ ministered by US Written not
[57:18] with ink but with the spirit of the
[57:21] Living God Amen with the spirit of the
[57:23] Living God not on the tables of stone
[57:25] but in the fleshly tables of the heart
[57:28] now here's Paul the messenger for that
[57:30] age and he's bringing it out of the Old
[57:32] Testament into the New Testament he said
[57:35] what really God wanted to do was not
[57:37] just write on tables of stone he wanted
[57:39] to write in tables of heart that man was
[57:42] serving because they loved him not
[57:44] because of a law not because of a
[57:46] regulation not because of a do or don't
[57:49] list but they serve me and they live for
[57:51] me because of one thing they met me for
[57:54] themselves and there was a love affair
[57:56] between me and them amen he said and
[57:59] such as we trust we have through Christ
[58:01] to God we're not that we are sufficients
[58:03] of ourselves to think anything is of
[58:06] ourselves but our sufficiency is of God
[58:09] who has also made us able Ministers of a
[58:12] new testament not of the letter but of
[58:15] the spirit
[58:16] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[58:19] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[58:22] life it is a minute but if the
[58:24] ministration of death ridden and
[58:27] engraved in Stones was glorious so that
[58:29] the children of Israel could not stand
[58:31] fastly behold the face of Moses for the
[58:34] glory of his countenance which Glory was
[58:36] to be done away with how shall not the
[58:39] ministration of the spirit be more
[58:41] glorious
[58:43] Hallelujah if that one was So Glorious
[58:46] that you couldn't look on a man's face
[58:48] and it was so much power there how much
[58:51] more should the spirit the
[58:53] administration of the spirit the power
[58:55] of the spirit the glory of the Lord be
[58:58] upon his people
[58:59] [Applause]
[59:00] Hallelujah that's what makes a church a
[59:02] church is not the people that is in
[59:05] there so much how many they got who they
[59:07] are what makes a church is the glory of
[59:10] the Lord it is the glory that fills this
[59:13] Temple it is the power of God it is the
[59:16] life of God that can come and Spark and
[59:19] move and change and deliver and set free
[59:22] that is the glory that we desire in this
[59:25] place
[59:26] it's not my glory it's not who I am it's
[59:29] not any of these other preachers or any
[59:31] of you it's the glory of God that's what
[59:34] we desire in our lives is the glory of
[59:37] God in our lives he said house shall not
[59:39] the ministration of the spirit be rather
[59:42] glorious for the ministration of
[59:45] condemnation be glory much more to the
[59:48] ministration of righteousness exceed in
[59:50] glory
[59:54] Hallelujah so if the administration of
[59:57] condemnation or the law had glory in it
[1:00:01] had miracles in it
[1:00:03] had signs and wonders in it had healings
[1:00:06] in it had deliverances in it
[1:00:09] come on look to the Bible it was under
[1:00:11] the administration of the letter or of
[1:00:14] the law but there was glory in there
[1:00:16] but Paul said we have moved from that to
[1:00:19] not just a dead letter but a living
[1:00:21] gospel
[1:00:23] because the holy spirit is here and it's
[1:00:25] not only just falling on a bush or
[1:00:28] falling on something else or on the ark
[1:00:30] or somewhere else it is now indwelling
[1:00:32] men and women of God as how much more
[1:00:36] should the glory of God be in the
[1:00:38] administration of the spirit
[1:00:41] so if we can look in the Old Testaments
[1:00:43] and see Deliverance how much more shall
[1:00:45] we look in our lives and see Deliverance
[1:00:47] if we can look there and see healing how
[1:00:50] much more should we look here and say
[1:00:53] healings and deliverances and signs and
[1:00:56] wonders and miracles
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:00:59] it's the glory of the Lord
[1:01:01] for even that which was made glorious
[1:01:04] had no glory in this Respect by reason
[1:01:07] of of the glory that Excellence for that
[1:01:11] which has done away was glorious much
[1:01:14] more that which remaineth as glorious
[1:01:18] seeing then that we have such hope we
[1:01:21] also have great plainness of speech and
[1:01:24] not as Moses would put a veil over his
[1:01:26] face that the children of Israel would
[1:01:28] not steadfastly look to the end of that
[1:01:31] which is abolished but their minds were
[1:01:33] blinded for until this day remain at the
[1:01:35] same Veil untaken away in the read in
[1:01:38] the Old Testament which Baal is done
[1:01:40] away when Christ but even unto this day
[1:01:42] when Moses is read the veil is upon
[1:01:45] their hearts nevertheless when it shall
[1:01:48] be turned to the Lord the veil shall be
[1:01:51] taken away
[1:01:53] Hallelujah when it shall be turned to
[1:01:56] the Lord the veil shall be taken away
[1:01:58] now the Lord is that spirit and we're
[1:02:02] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:02:05] Liberty
[1:02:08] hallelujah we're not under the
[1:02:10] ministration of bondage we're under the
[1:02:12] ministration of Liberty
[1:02:16] hallelujah we're not under the
[1:02:18] administration of do's and don'ts
[1:02:23] this message is not do's and don'ts this
[1:02:26] message is Liberty
[1:02:28] this message brings the Life of Christ
[1:02:31] down into a Believer that'll set them
[1:02:34] free from the bondages of sin
[1:02:37] because we're not under the
[1:02:39] administration of the law and you know
[1:02:41] burning this a certain day or doing this
[1:02:43] a certain day or taking this care for
[1:02:45] this turtle dove or this or that and
[1:02:47] other no he came down once and forever
[1:02:49] and the life of this lamb can now enter
[1:02:53] the spark can enter into you and it'll
[1:02:56] change you from do's and don'ts
[1:02:59] if you're still a bunch of do's and
[1:03:01] don'ts and that's all this message is to
[1:03:03] you then you ain't got the spark
[1:03:06] the glory has not been revealed in your
[1:03:09] life because in this spirit in this part
[1:03:11] there is Liberty
[1:03:15] hallelujah amen that's why I believe our
[1:03:17] services ought to have Liberty in them
[1:03:21] amen if God wants to move however he
[1:03:23] wants to move we're going to let God do
[1:03:25] what he wants to do
[1:03:27] amen if he wants to move in the
[1:03:28] Stillness if he wants to move in the
[1:03:30] loudness if he wants to move in the
[1:03:32] dance if he wants to move in the tongues
[1:03:34] it'll be whatever he wants to move I
[1:03:36] want God to have Liberty in our hearts I
[1:03:39] want the glory of
[1:03:40] not to just fill our hearts and fill
[1:03:42] this place but
[1:03:44] doing this morning I believe he's still
[1:03:46] that same kind of God that's the glory
[1:03:48] that was revealed in the Old Testament
[1:03:50] and they said when the glory of the Lord
[1:03:52] filled the temple the ministers couldn't
[1:03:54] even minister no more well that's the
[1:03:57] glory of it revealed and under the law
[1:03:59] under the under the bondage how much
[1:04:02] more shall the liberty of God when it
[1:04:04] sets people free and it sets bondage
[1:04:07] free and it breaks change and it breaks
[1:04:10] Darkness and Light shines in
[1:04:13] how much more is that Glory
[1:04:18] there's liberty
[1:04:21] how dare some man want to come and bind
[1:04:23] the people of God
[1:04:27] no no we've been brought to Liberty
[1:04:29] what what vindicate you know but what
[1:04:31] Vindicated Jesus was who he said he was
[1:04:35] was not all the Miracles
[1:04:38] and all the signs and all the Wonders
[1:04:41] yes that was part of it but what really
[1:04:43] Vindicated him who he was was he rose
[1:04:46] from the dead
[1:04:50] and listen what's going to vindicate us
[1:04:52] who we say we are is not going to be all
[1:04:55] the Miracles that we're going to have
[1:04:56] them
[1:04:57] we're going to have signs and wonders
[1:05:00] but all those are are part of it but
[1:05:02] we can't who we say we are
[1:05:07] amen is the lifting up of this flesh and
[1:05:11] it's changing it to such a place but it
[1:05:13] changes it from mortality into
[1:05:15] immortality from corruptible into
[1:05:17] incorruptible
[1:05:19] Hallelujah the light of God came down
[1:05:22] and it sparked that dead body that was
[1:05:25] laying there in a grave and it brought
[1:05:28] it back to life again
[1:05:32] you know brother I read it to you all
[1:05:34] the things that Jesus did and certainly
[1:05:36] appreciating all of his Vindication of
[1:05:38] God's word and what he did to fulfill it
[1:05:40] of Healing The Sick raising the dead
[1:05:42] casting out Devils preaching the gospel
[1:05:45] to the poor fulfilling every word that
[1:05:48] God said he would do when he came and
[1:05:50] then also suffering for our sins and our
[1:05:52] sin to be the perpetuation of sins at
[1:05:55] the cross where no one else could have
[1:05:57] done it but him
[1:05:59] but above all that I think Easter sealed
[1:06:02] the whole thing
[1:06:04] we don't know what Easter is there's
[1:06:06] Resurrection because there had been
[1:06:08] prophets on the earth before who had
[1:06:10] prophesied there had been prophets on
[1:06:12] the earth before who healed the sick
[1:06:13] raised the dead done the same signs that
[1:06:16] Jesus did but Easter proved who he was
[1:06:19] it sealed the word of God forever for
[1:06:22] the True Believer and all Gloom and all
[1:06:25] doubt was shattered on that Blissful
[1:06:28] morning
[1:06:29] Hallelujah Hallelujah critic was shut up
[1:06:32] in a prison house man had been shut up
[1:06:34] before in prison houses religious people
[1:06:37] for this day seeing great religious
[1:06:39] moves and moving of the Holy Spirit and
[1:06:41] so forth but when this man died it
[1:06:44] seemed it settled it he was not who he
[1:06:46] said he was
[1:06:49] but he said I have power to lay my life
[1:06:52] down and I have power to take it up
[1:06:54] again
[1:06:57] Hallelujah and then go ahead I proved
[1:06:59] what he said to me that's what sealed it
[1:07:02] amen when he's something that was said
[1:07:04] and then it's turned around and it's
[1:07:06] proven he said God purpose to prove his
[1:07:09] word the truth there was only one man
[1:07:11] could do that and that was Jesus and he
[1:07:13] came and proved to that to be the truth
[1:07:15] it sealed it and that broke all the
[1:07:18] seals of glue and it scattered all the
[1:07:20] superstitions of religion where great
[1:07:22] men had raised up and said marvelous
[1:07:24] saying but every one of them were still
[1:07:26] in the grave
[1:07:29] but this Christian religion is the only
[1:07:32] one
[1:07:33] who has an empty tooth
[1:07:35] amen and empty too and that proves to me
[1:07:38] that he was God of the living and God of
[1:07:41] the Dead
[1:07:43] he was a God that could go down and die
[1:07:45] but he was a God that could come up
[1:07:47] again this quick and Empower this
[1:07:50] quickening Spirit as proves of the years
[1:07:52] he's the one who can Quicken the dead
[1:07:55] back to life again
[1:07:58] oh Hallelujah I want you to understand
[1:08:00] that same resurrection power is in the
[1:08:03] building this morning you might be dead
[1:08:05] in your sins or dead in your Traditions
[1:08:07] or dead of of years of nothingness but
[1:08:11] there's a God who's rich in Mercy
[1:08:15] there's a voice here this morning that
[1:08:17] opened the grave
[1:08:20] oh and Lazarus can walk out of there and
[1:08:24] there's liberty here this morning and
[1:08:26] say lose some of those great clothes
[1:08:29] Hallelujah unbind his feet so he can
[1:08:31] move a little bit I'm fine 's hands so
[1:08:34] he can worship I'll take it around his
[1:08:36] mouth so he can see the Praises of
[1:08:38] almighty God
[1:08:41] Hallelujah I said this morning lies with
[1:08:44] come forth
[1:08:46] there's a spark here this morning
[1:08:48] that'll raise a dead it'll break the two
[1:08:51] seals on the tomb that has sealed you in
[1:08:54] year after year after year
[1:08:59] if it's all right this morning we're
[1:09:01] gonna have some church
[1:09:02] [Applause]
[1:09:03] because as many of you've been sealed in
[1:09:05] tombs of your Traditions amen sealed in
[1:09:08] your tombs of past failures and past
[1:09:10] mistakes and you never can get past them
[1:09:13] and you're wrapped up in all that
[1:09:15] nonsense but there's a voice of
[1:09:16] Resurrection here this morning
[1:09:20] there's a spark that's greater than your
[1:09:22] lukewarmness that there's a spark that's
[1:09:25] greater than your backslid condition
[1:09:27] there's a spark that is greater than
[1:09:29] what you're going through
[1:09:32] Hallelujah there's a spark that's
[1:09:35] greater than the sickness that's here
[1:09:36] this morning here's a spark that is
[1:09:39] greater than the sin that is holding you
[1:09:46] when he proved
[1:09:47] by his promise
[1:09:49] this great conquering power
[1:09:51] on Easter he proved he could conquer
[1:09:53] death Hell In The Grave I am he that was
[1:09:56] dead
[1:09:57] was dead
[1:09:59] was dead
[1:10:01] he's not dead no more
[1:10:03] so if this God ain't dead he don't want
[1:10:05] a dead people
[1:10:08] amen how can we expect to say we got the
[1:10:10] same life he had and we're dead
[1:10:13] no no we ain't got it
[1:10:15] there's a spark
[1:10:17] there's a there's a life
[1:10:19] hallelujah what a statement
[1:10:22] I am he that was dead but I'm alive
[1:10:25] again and forevermore
[1:10:27] in other words ain't another time I'm
[1:10:28] going down in that grave because this
[1:10:31] one time has sealed it forever who I am
[1:10:35] Hallelujah and I have the keys to death
[1:10:39] hell and the grave what a statement for
[1:10:42] anyone to make but not only did he make
[1:10:44] the statement he proved what he had and
[1:10:47] what he said was true
[1:10:50] foreign
[1:10:51] alone is a dead letter but there's a
[1:10:54] light or a spark that'll make it live
[1:11:00] amen you know he's he said like this one
[1:11:03] place he said what if we had two brand
[1:11:05] new cars
[1:11:09] all the seats were made out of dough
[1:11:11] skin you know the softness of leather
[1:11:13] easy and soft to sit in floorboards
[1:11:17] would plush
[1:11:18] steering wheel was nickel plated
[1:11:21] diamond studs everywhere
[1:11:23] the engine had been I was mechanically
[1:11:25] tested to be exactly the right engine
[1:11:27] for the car
[1:11:28] all the bearings were greased up the
[1:11:31] tires were puncture proof and blowout
[1:11:33] free
[1:11:37] how do you realize what kind of car we
[1:11:39] got available
[1:11:41] the tires were puncture proof and blow
[1:11:44] out free and been scientifically tested
[1:11:46] they had been pushed off the assembly
[1:11:49] line both of them both of them filled up
[1:11:51] with gasoline that's the running power
[1:11:53] of the gasoline because it's the octane
[1:11:56] but now when you're going to start them
[1:11:58] although both of them look just alike
[1:12:00] there's one of them that don't have any
[1:12:03] Spark
[1:12:05] hello any firing power you say well the
[1:12:09] power's in the gasoline I don't care how
[1:12:12] much power is in the gasoline until
[1:12:14] there's a spark that power and that that
[1:12:18] what's in there is confirmed to be
[1:12:19] ghastly it might as well be just water
[1:12:26] no matter how much theologians claim or
[1:12:29] how well you got your church Center how
[1:12:31] much education you can pump into it how
[1:12:33] much you like the Bible until that wave
[1:12:36] sheath the Holy Spirit comes to that
[1:12:38] person and quickens that word the
[1:12:40] gasoline represents a word
[1:12:44] but it might as well be water
[1:12:47] if there ain't no spark
[1:12:52] it won't move without the spirit
[1:12:58] well now listen I'm gonna go through a
[1:13:01] lot of these this morning we have put
[1:13:02] too much stress on the mechanics and
[1:13:06] nothing on the Dynamics
[1:13:09] it needs a dynamic power of God the
[1:13:12] resurrected power of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:15] Christ upon the church to manifest and
[1:13:18] to bring the past that this is gasoline
[1:13:23] it might be a gasoline can but it can
[1:13:27] still have just water in it
[1:13:30] and if y'all ever made that mistake
[1:13:32] thought you had some gasoline in the gas
[1:13:34] can look like a gas can when poured it
[1:13:36] off in the engine
[1:13:40] you ain't going nowhere you ain't mowing
[1:13:42] no grass you're not doing nothing but
[1:13:45] sputtering
[1:13:47] come on now there's a lot of sputtering
[1:13:50] going around
[1:13:52] amen because they've not put that octane
[1:13:55] or the word on the inside of them and
[1:13:58] then allow the spark
[1:14:00] of God to come down and ignite what is
[1:14:03] there
[1:14:05] oh yeah amen they've allowed other
[1:14:08] spirits to enact bitterness that's on
[1:14:10] the inside of there
[1:14:12] hello somebody they allowed other
[1:14:14] spirits to come and ignite hatefulness
[1:14:16] that's on the inside of there and
[1:14:18] unforgiveness on the inside of there and
[1:14:21] spirits of every kind
[1:14:24] but let's get the right things on the
[1:14:26] inside listen I'm not saying you don't
[1:14:28] need the word you got to have the word
[1:14:30] because you can have all the spark you
[1:14:32] want to it if it ain't nothing but water
[1:14:33] it ain't going nowhere
[1:14:36] amen but we must have the word of God
[1:14:38] lying upon line
[1:14:41] precept upon precept it's got to be put
[1:14:44] on an attitude amen why there's a spark
[1:14:47] that we need to bring it to life he said
[1:14:49] it'll only be said if it might be a
[1:14:51] gasoline can but it could still just be
[1:14:53] water the only proof is put the life on
[1:14:56] it and it'll prove whether it's gasoline
[1:14:58] or not
[1:15:00] hallelujah amen you let the power of God
[1:15:03] start moving through here it'll prove to
[1:15:05] a lot of you whether you've got gasoline
[1:15:07] or you got water
[1:15:09] amen but if there's gasoline on the
[1:15:12] inside it'll be a deep that calleth into
[1:15:14] the deep and there'll be a deep to
[1:15:16] respond
[1:15:19] hey brother Timothy you trying to make
[1:15:21] us have an explosion sure am
[1:15:24] en you said well I'm a quiet person well
[1:15:27] listen there's there's quite and there's
[1:15:29] formal
[1:15:31] two different things you can be quiet
[1:15:34] but not be formal
[1:15:37] hello you can be loud and jumping and be
[1:15:40] formal
[1:15:43] amen amen but what we want amen is
[1:15:46] something igniting taking place amen the
[1:15:50] power of God that'll make the car crank
[1:15:52] and go down the road it'll make it live
[1:15:55] it'll make it amen live and amen not
[1:15:57] just on a Sunday morning or a Wednesday
[1:15:59] night but every day of your life it'll
[1:16:02] make you husbands live like a husband
[1:16:04] ought to live
[1:16:05] it'll make your leads your children like
[1:16:07] a husband ought to lead your children
[1:16:08] and make wives live like wives ought to
[1:16:11] live and children live like children
[1:16:13] ought to live
[1:16:20] he says when you try to put the Holy
[1:16:22] Spirit into nomination
[1:16:24] you're as much as trying he said you can
[1:16:27] get a sputter but it'll ruin your engine
[1:16:28] get it full of carbon he said I'm so
[1:16:31] glad there's a ten thousand octane power
[1:16:34] the word of God and there's a holy ghost
[1:16:36] to light it up
[1:16:38] to resurrect the power of God in a man's
[1:16:41] life or woman's life or in church
[1:16:43] that'll prove that Cadillac down the
[1:16:45] road Yonder on the dining they'll show
[1:16:46] that Cadillac down the road under the
[1:16:49] dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which
[1:16:51] will come back which come back and was
[1:16:53] weighed over the people at the day of
[1:16:55] Pentecost making them the same yesterday
[1:16:57] today and forever and it goes on in and
[1:17:00] he said there have been churches
[1:17:01] churches Brides brides churches Brides
[1:17:04] but there's got to come one
[1:17:07] that has come has to come a real bride
[1:17:10] that's not only got the mechanics but
[1:17:12] it's also got the Dynamics
[1:17:15] that makes the church live and move in
[1:17:18] the power of his resurrection until we
[1:17:20] come to that place what is it good good
[1:17:22] does it do to polish the heart oh the
[1:17:24] hubs on the outside
[1:17:27] and you can have the most awesome car in
[1:17:30] the world
[1:17:31] and it can be just as pretty as it can
[1:17:33] be this is what he's saying give it a
[1:17:35] simonized job which is a polishing job
[1:17:37] you can polish it all up and she can be
[1:17:40] shiny and pretty but on the inside of
[1:17:42] her you hit the old starter button there
[1:17:45] ain't no life
[1:17:47] oh
[1:17:49] well what good has it been for you to
[1:17:51] spend all that time
[1:17:56] polishing up amen the outside of your
[1:17:59] life went on the inside
[1:18:01] on the inside bitterness is coming out
[1:18:04] and hatred is coming out
[1:18:07] but you're polishing up the outside so
[1:18:09] everybody thinks you're a Christian
[1:18:10] everybody believes you're surely a Son
[1:18:12] of God and a man but on the inside
[1:18:16] growling about this and growling about
[1:18:18] that hateful about this and hateful
[1:18:20] about that
[1:18:21] come on somebody amen there needs to be
[1:18:24] a change on the inside
[1:18:31] no matter how much the mechanics prove
[1:18:33] to be right there's got to be Dynamics
[1:18:34] to make it work
[1:18:36] that's what he proved that's what Easter
[1:18:38] proved it wasn't the only the word he
[1:18:40] was God himself the Dynamics in the word
[1:18:42] that made the body of Jesus Christ that
[1:18:45] was cold dead and stiff in the grave
[1:18:47] shake the life again and rise up and
[1:18:49] roll away the stone and say ah him he
[1:18:51] that was dead
[1:18:53] he was so dead to the son said he was
[1:18:55] the moon said he was the star said
[1:18:57] nature said he was and now the whole
[1:19:00] world has to recognize he's alive again
[1:19:02] he was not only the mechanics he was the
[1:19:05] Dynamics and he'd been the groom the
[1:19:07] bride has to come also forth because
[1:19:10] it's part of him
[1:19:12] it came beyond the manifestation the
[1:19:14] Fulfillment of all Revelations any
[1:19:16] others that spoke of the Bride it can
[1:19:18] only manifest it does something
[1:19:20] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:19:21] bride she is flesh of his flesh bone of
[1:19:24] his bone life of his life power of his
[1:19:26] power she is him
[1:19:30] that's why he said the works that I do
[1:19:32] shall ye do also
[1:19:37] until the church becomes both Dynamics
[1:19:41] and mechanics the spirit of God that
[1:19:43] moved him to do the things he did he hit
[1:19:46] on 16 cylinders so will the bride
[1:19:51] Hallelujah John 14 12 said he that
[1:19:54] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:19:57] shall he live also I give him a charge
[1:19:59] of my Dynamics and his mechanics that
[1:20:02] the word will not be able to stand up
[1:20:03] will be able to withstand it I'll raise
[1:20:05] him up again the last day that's the
[1:20:07] Easter message the Dynamics and the
[1:20:10] mechanics together amen the mechanics
[1:20:12] working with the without the Dynamics is
[1:20:15] no good neither is the Dynamics without
[1:20:17] the mechanics
[1:20:20] it takes both of them word and spirit
[1:20:22] Spirit and Truth
[1:20:25] takes two wings to fly
[1:20:30] it only work as they come together want
[1:20:32] to sit still and the other go up the
[1:20:34] only thing that thing that there is to
[1:20:36] it yet you might they both might look
[1:20:38] alike they might claim to be churches
[1:20:40] they might claim to be the bride but one
[1:20:42] has the mechanics and Dynamics that'll
[1:20:44] take it down the road he said the other
[1:20:46] just won't move no matter how good the
[1:20:47] mechanics is until the Dynamics come
[1:20:50] when the Dynamics come the fire is made
[1:20:53] to connect to the octane and that
[1:20:55] gasoline and when that explodes it
[1:20:58] causes a combustion and that combustion
[1:21:00] moves every motion
[1:21:03] every motion it moves every motion every
[1:21:07] move for he is the same yesterday today
[1:21:10] and forever that's the resurrection
[1:21:12] that's the real power of God mechanics
[1:21:14] with the Dynamics notice it's the spirit
[1:21:17] that quickens it's the spark that fires
[1:21:23] it's not the gasifiers it's the spark
[1:21:28] I mean hey I went out and poured gas all
[1:21:32] over it but we go buy a burn pile before
[1:21:34] and you can jump up and down all you
[1:21:36] wanted to
[1:21:37] it wasn't going to burn nothing
[1:21:40] but let me tell you
[1:21:42] if you ever got a spark to it
[1:21:47] if you ever let a spark get out
[1:21:50] it was going to burn and it was going to
[1:21:52] explode
[1:21:54] I met every witness that I I hey maybe
[1:21:56] I'm the only fire bug around here
[1:21:59] amen you know I I I I remember one time
[1:22:03] as a young man I throwed a bunch of
[1:22:06] gasoline I didn't realize how explosive
[1:22:07] that stuff was and I just poured it all
[1:22:09] out I said well a little do good a lot
[1:22:11] to do better
[1:22:13] that's my idea of it so I just let this
[1:22:15] downstairs real good I walked away from
[1:22:17] there and I come back and I lit that
[1:22:19] dude up
[1:22:21] we had some shouting and screaming going
[1:22:23] on for sure
[1:22:24] amen it exploded us Sparks and Embers
[1:22:27] all over the place it's that limbs that
[1:22:29] were lifted up into the heavens all
[1:22:31] kinds of things were taking place
[1:22:33] I was running for my life
[1:22:38] amen amen that's what happens to a lot
[1:22:41] of people when they ain't expecting an
[1:22:42] explosion
[1:22:43] amen they might be sitting there dead
[1:22:45] informal but all of a sudden the
[1:22:46] explosion to take place and they'll
[1:22:48] start running for the lives they'll
[1:22:50] leave out the door and they go get in
[1:22:51] their cars but those who want it those
[1:22:54] that desire they said Lord not Lord not
[1:22:57] let me just witness an explosion let me
[1:23:00] be the explosion Let It Ride inside of
[1:23:03] my life
[1:23:07] hallelujah what good is a car going to
[1:23:10] do you sit in your driveway
[1:23:13] let me just sitting on the shelf
[1:23:14] somewhere and that's all you know is a
[1:23:16] bunch of quotes you can quote them
[1:23:18] better than some preachers but you can't
[1:23:19] live it but I tell you there is a lie
[1:23:22] that can come on the inside
[1:23:24] it'll make that quote get off a shelf or
[1:23:27] out of your head and get down in your
[1:23:29] heart and you'll run right over the top
[1:23:31] of that devil
[1:23:36] I told you this before and I told it at
[1:23:38] the camera this is a good story on the
[1:23:40] way this church once uh one evening I
[1:23:42] think it was a Wednesday night we're
[1:23:43] riding along going down 160.
[1:23:47] pray pray that bridge to get fixed we've
[1:23:49] been out three years come on now
[1:23:53] and so anyway we're riding down that
[1:23:55] road and I'm just sun is in my face and
[1:23:58] I kind of meditate and ain't really
[1:24:00] paying no attention all of a sudden my
[1:24:01] last second Vision I saw a snake come
[1:24:04] out
[1:24:05] come right out into the road
[1:24:08] dead snake
[1:24:10] I'm riding a look over sister
[1:24:12] said uh I tell you what I didn't see
[1:24:16] that snake coming she said I think the
[1:24:18] better part of that he didn't see you
[1:24:19] coming
[1:24:22] I got to think about it as I told that
[1:24:24] at that Youth Camp I got to thinking
[1:24:26] about now we don't just got a bunch of
[1:24:28] cars
[1:24:30] just been sitting polishing the Hub
[1:24:32] wearing the right dress wearing the
[1:24:34] right hair wearing the right thing doing
[1:24:35] the right no no we got some cars that'll
[1:24:37] go down the road
[1:24:40] and that snake on one at Monday Tuesday
[1:24:42] morning after you got back or whatever
[1:24:44] he decided you know what
[1:24:48] he said you know what I'm going to walk
[1:24:50] out in front of him or I'm going to
[1:24:51] crawl out whatever he and I'm going to
[1:24:53] come right out and I'm going to stop him
[1:24:55] like I did before
[1:24:56] I'm gonna stop them in the middle of the
[1:24:58] track I'm going to put my hand up and
[1:25:00] I'm gonna stop this the next thing you
[1:25:02] know boom
[1:25:07] Hallelujah he found out this was in the
[1:25:09] car that was just sitting in the Mom and
[1:25:11] Daddy's home no more this is a car
[1:25:13] that'll run right over the top of him
[1:25:17] I love him let it run right over him in
[1:25:19] the bedroom in their cars no matter
[1:25:22] where he steps out give up you be
[1:25:24] careful
[1:25:27] Hallelujah there's a power living on the
[1:25:30] inside of some young people that'll put
[1:25:32] trademarks on your eyes
[1:25:34] that'll run you over
[1:25:39] I got to thinking about that as they lay
[1:25:42] as they laid there in that road
[1:25:44] like what happened
[1:25:47] what in the world happened another Devil
[1:25:50] comes up said what happened to you he
[1:25:52] said well what happened was
[1:25:55] I was gonna do like I always did
[1:25:59] that came back from Council before and I
[1:26:01] stopped them
[1:26:03] they came back from places of the spirit
[1:26:06] of God moving before and I stopped them
[1:26:08] I got to hear nothing and stopped them
[1:26:10] before but something was different this
[1:26:12] time
[1:26:16] something was different this time it was
[1:26:19] I didn't get out in front of a car that
[1:26:21] was parked it was running down the
[1:26:23] highway
[1:26:26] Hallelujah did not see some cars this
[1:26:28] morning that's going down the highway
[1:26:30] it's going to Healing it's going down to
[1:26:33] Joy that's going down the speaking of
[1:26:35] tongue it's going down to all things God
[1:26:38] has
[1:26:40] Hallelujah it'll ride over every devil
[1:26:45] hey put ten Devils up it don't matter
[1:26:47] you don't have enough power there's a
[1:26:50] power that's on the inside of me is
[1:26:52] greater than he that's in the world
[1:27:02] but there's some people that don't like
[1:27:04] fire
[1:27:06] but I personally like fire
[1:27:11] for Philip something by the fire
[1:27:16] I remember when that fire struck your
[1:27:18] heart
[1:27:19] it was real
[1:27:23] I don't know I know the devil wants to
[1:27:25] tell you it wasn't but it was it is
[1:27:28] amen
[1:27:31] Hallelujah
[1:27:35] but you know I was up there and bounce
[1:27:37] pretty Place who's ever been to Banff
[1:27:40] it's one of the most maybe one day in
[1:27:42] the Millennium I get to live up there
[1:27:43] it'd be awesome
[1:27:45] but anyway
[1:27:48] I was out on the boat with a brother his
[1:27:50] wife brother Jerry Fury and wife says
[1:27:53] Debbie me and sister Ruth was taking
[1:27:54] this Tour on a boat on this side was a
[1:27:57] big old burn over
[1:27:58] nothing but just dead nothing's looking
[1:28:01] a little few little Twigs coming up and
[1:28:03] things coming up on this side the most
[1:28:04] beautiful Forest you've ever seen in
[1:28:05] your life
[1:28:07] and that driver that boat
[1:28:09] he back calls me to tip it over
[1:28:11] because he said let me ask y'all
[1:28:12] something he said which side of this
[1:28:14] lake has the most life in it
[1:28:17] and uh others say well it's got to be
[1:28:19] that beautiful Forest over there and I'm
[1:28:21] just sitting there listening thinking
[1:28:22] about this he said no he said actually
[1:28:24] that side over there that looks like
[1:28:26] nothing it's got the most life in it he
[1:28:29] said because these trees you know we
[1:28:31] said well we out here we got we practice
[1:28:33] uh Fire Burns and fire bans and and we
[1:28:35] try to control fires they sit back in
[1:28:37] the history of time that when the fire
[1:28:39] started by lightning storm or whatever
[1:28:41] man my man or whatever it just burnt but
[1:28:43] that was Nature's Way of replenishing
[1:28:45] itself it was Nature's Way of taking the
[1:28:48] old growth out and and the Newton growth
[1:28:50] coming and in that new growth that's
[1:28:51] where life is
[1:28:53] you know about tip the boat over amen
[1:28:56] because I remember what brother Brown
[1:28:57] talked about the old growth and the new
[1:28:59] growth and life being in there he said
[1:29:02] but on this side of this Valley up here
[1:29:04] is Banff and he said we let that fire
[1:29:05] get out of the burned down bound he said
[1:29:07] so we practice A Fire Control I thought
[1:29:10] man I told brother Jerry it sounded like
[1:29:11] a lot of preachers to me a lot of
[1:29:13] churches that wanted practice Fire
[1:29:15] Control and they only wanted to burn so
[1:29:17] far or burn so much or do as I said let
[1:29:20] the fire go
[1:29:21] Let It Burn
[1:29:23] let's just burn it down this morning
[1:29:26] amen because fire brings life
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:31] hey man I got the research on that on on
[1:29:34] fire bringing life and I got it here
[1:29:35] again amen the Sequoias over there lives
[1:29:38] for 300 or 3 000 years and they've been
[1:29:41] some of them seen history for a long
[1:29:42] time and you know they they grow up and
[1:29:45] they become great big magnificent trees
[1:29:47] and they so I've never actually got to
[1:29:49] go one of these days I'd like to but
[1:29:51] they're so beautiful and so tall and so
[1:29:53] high he said but it takes a fire to come
[1:29:56] down and to be for them to be able to
[1:29:59] reproduce
[1:30:02] and so you know what happens people the
[1:30:04] the naturalists or the tree huggers and
[1:30:06] some of them are called they try to
[1:30:08] protect the environment but really
[1:30:09] they're actually hurting the environment
[1:30:12] they're hurting the reproduction and
[1:30:14] sooner or later these old trees are
[1:30:16] going to be gone and there's no Wildlife
[1:30:18] going to come back up again because they
[1:30:20] have taken the fire out
[1:30:22] and without the fire they can't
[1:30:24] reproduce and that's how they're born
[1:30:27] they're born in the fire a fire gives
[1:30:29] them three things they need for
[1:30:30] regeneration that blows my mind three
[1:30:33] things first one it punches a hole in
[1:30:35] the force which allows more light to
[1:30:38] come
[1:30:41] it allows more light to come and more
[1:30:44] water to fall
[1:30:45] [Applause]
[1:30:48] Hallelujah that's why we need to fire
[1:30:50] god in our midst because it needs to
[1:30:52] punch a hole in our unbelief it needs to
[1:30:55] punch a hole in our shadows and a lie a
[1:30:58] weary fear of weird feeling and punch a
[1:31:00] hole right through it that light can
[1:31:02] come back here
[1:31:03] [Applause]
[1:31:07] the second thing it does it heats up the
[1:31:09] cone and those mature trees
[1:31:12] without harming the trees
[1:31:15] hello somebody well I'm a mature
[1:31:17] Christian well the fire ain't gonna hurt
[1:31:19] you
[1:31:21] hey man it's going to do nothing but
[1:31:22] help you without harming the trees so
[1:31:25] those cones can open up and they begin
[1:31:28] to rain seeds down to the ground
[1:31:30] and the third thing that it does it
[1:31:33] clears away all the dead matter
[1:31:38] leaves and it covered up the soul and it
[1:31:41] caught the deadness and and the
[1:31:44] and the past mistakes and the past
[1:31:46] failures and the things that have fallen
[1:31:48] to the ground the fire of God comes down
[1:31:51] and it cleans them all out
[1:31:54] because wow there's got to be seeds to
[1:31:56] fall in this ground and this ground has
[1:31:58] to be opened up so we can receive the
[1:32:01] life
[1:32:04] Hallelujah and this winter comes and the
[1:32:07] snow begins to cover and it begins to
[1:32:09] get in a a real cold situation and it
[1:32:13] seems like there's not going to be
[1:32:14] enough life it seems like there ain't no
[1:32:15] way this is going to work out there's a
[1:32:17] lot of coldness there's a lot of
[1:32:18] weariness there's a lot of hurts there's
[1:32:20] a lot of this and it's covering me
[1:32:24] but the light comes up and it gets
[1:32:27] stronger and stronger and the fire had
[1:32:30] burned a hole in there
[1:32:32] and it begins to melt away all the
[1:32:35] formalities and it begins to melt away
[1:32:37] all the coldness and it begins to melt
[1:32:39] away all the other things that lay there
[1:32:41] until that seed is looking up at the Sun
[1:32:46] and it says what happens at light Sparks
[1:32:49] a life
[1:32:50] [Applause]
[1:32:52] whoa Jesus that's why we need to fire
[1:32:55] god to come service after service
[1:32:58] because we know the devil he loves to
[1:33:01] build up bitterness and weird feelings
[1:33:03] and spooky things and all that kind of
[1:33:05] stuff around us to where we can't
[1:33:07] receive nothing of God but I say God Let
[1:33:09] the Fire Fall
[1:33:11] Let the Fire Fall and burn out all of
[1:33:14] that to where the life can shine through
[1:33:17] again and Spark life again
[1:33:26] and from their birth among the ashes
[1:33:30] these seedlings have become the Groves
[1:33:33] we see today
[1:33:37] out of the ashes
[1:33:39] trees nearly 300 foot tall
[1:33:44] but man wants to control it
[1:33:47] man wants to say God only does so you
[1:33:49] know and I want to call it a bunch of
[1:33:51] wildfire
[1:33:54] I got to bring this in right here
[1:33:57] 's a brother and brother brother Wayne's
[1:34:00] Church got up and just preached here
[1:34:01] before we came to that camp he said
[1:34:03] there's wild Brother Bear talk about
[1:34:04] Wildfire no fire
[1:34:06] so I'd rather have some Wildfire than no
[1:34:08] fire at all
[1:34:10] so he said right here is Wildfire no
[1:34:13] fire Wildfire no fire he said so
[1:34:16] somewhere right here in the middle is
[1:34:17] where we want to be
[1:34:20] he said but if I'm going to make a
[1:34:22] mistake
[1:34:23] I'm gonna be on the power side
[1:34:25] [Applause]
[1:34:28] he said that's where I want to be on the
[1:34:30] power side
[1:34:32] amen I believe if we ought to move if we
[1:34:34] make a mistake we ought to make it
[1:34:36] towards the power side
[1:34:38] amen every time say God send the power
[1:34:41] just now let it so build in our hearts
[1:34:44] and build in this service it'll burn out
[1:34:46] our bitterness and hatred and strife and
[1:34:49] weird feelings and all that nonsense
[1:34:51] [Applause]
[1:34:53] all those dead matter that's
[1:34:55] the crowd burn it out
[1:34:59] Hallelujah there has to be life that
[1:35:02] comes in this place it has to be life
[1:35:04] that comes in this place and if God has
[1:35:07] to burn through the bushes
[1:35:10] open up a path
[1:35:12] to where his light can shine I say God
[1:35:14] burn
[1:35:21] he said well
[1:35:24] Holy Spirit he said now the Holy Spirit
[1:35:25] comes of course it wasn't sent to who
[1:35:28] those that won't receive it it wasn't
[1:35:30] sent to them
[1:35:31] instead of God told me he said I don't
[1:35:33] believe it I don't care what you say in
[1:35:34] fact you raise the dead hear the sick
[1:35:36] prove it anyway I still wouldn't believe
[1:35:38] certainly not you're an unbeliever
[1:35:40] It Don't Mean a Thing to you it wasn't
[1:35:43] even sent to you but it was sent to
[1:35:45] those who believe
[1:35:48] amen the message is to the believer to
[1:35:52] them that perish its foolishness but to
[1:35:55] them that are in Christ and part of that
[1:35:57] seed it's life
[1:36:02] he talks about his his little story of a
[1:36:05] farmer that put a hag under a hand we've
[1:36:08] heard it
[1:36:09] he said the little egg little Eagle he
[1:36:11] took a little he found a little Eagle
[1:36:12] egg and he put it under a chicken
[1:36:15] she was roosting and so or nesting so
[1:36:19] she put her put that egg under her
[1:36:22] and she hatched out this funniest
[1:36:23] looking chicken odd little fella didn't
[1:36:26] look like them his feathers wouldn't
[1:36:28] like the rest of them all the rest of
[1:36:30] them chick chickens recognize he's odd
[1:36:33] he didn't even like the diet she was
[1:36:35] feeding him
[1:36:36] he didn't like that scratching in the
[1:36:37] barn yard
[1:36:39] he didn't have nothing to do with that
[1:36:40] he wondered why he had to be the odd one
[1:36:42] around
[1:36:43] he never tasted anything like that that
[1:36:46] he liked he just eat enough to keep him
[1:36:48] alive because he he didn't like the
[1:36:50] taste of it he because why he wasn't a
[1:36:51] chicken to begin with
[1:36:53] a hand would clucking old days of
[1:36:56] Miracles are passed and there's no such
[1:36:57] a thing just join a church and believe

[1:37:00] hidden right now with that little guy so
[1:37:03] he followed around the hen to one day
[1:37:06] the old Eagle knew she'd laid some
[1:37:08] missed so many eggs and there was one
[1:37:10] missing she knew that that eagle was
[1:37:12] somewhere and she starts out on the hunt
[1:37:14] for him and she circles over the
[1:37:16] Mountaintop and down the valley and over
[1:37:19] everywhere where he might be about this
[1:37:21] time it's time for him to be born it's
[1:37:23] time to be hatched out he said maybe a
[1:37:25] crow come in and picked him up or
[1:37:26] something else something picked up my
[1:37:28] egg that egg was in his mind
[1:37:31] he knew he had a son somewhere I'm going
[1:37:34] to hunt him down
[1:37:35] [Applause]
[1:37:37] whoa Jesus and so does God he's that

[1:38:27] our own feelings our own thoughts
[1:38:29] entertain them we ought to be casting
[1:38:32] them down
[1:38:34] amen cuddling with them he said one day
[1:38:37] as The Story Goes if this eagle flew
[1:38:39] over Barnyard and she found him
[1:38:42] oh for that Resurrection wrecked to
[1:38:44] recognize that he wasn't a chicken after
[1:38:46] all he was an eagle all of a sudden he
[1:38:49] heard a scream and that scream let look
[1:38:52] up this way
[1:38:56] look up this way
[1:39:00] oh my let's just bring it on down to
[1:39:02] where we had it was an eagle that
[1:39:04] started circling around Louisiana
[1:39:07] you know when it got over in the
[1:39:08] Mississippi a little bit
[1:39:10] because I knew it had four eggs over
[1:39:12] there
[1:39:14] and all of a sudden these eggs have been
[1:39:16] over there been hatched out under the
[1:39:18] denominational system and they thought
[1:39:19] that was all that is ever going to be
[1:39:21] but something on the inside of them said
[1:39:23] man there's got to be something more
[1:39:25] than what I got
[1:39:26] there's got to be something that's all
[1:39:28] that's something that can move me more
[1:39:30] than what I'm being here and I see this
[1:39:32] church going off in the wrong direction
[1:39:34] and I don't want to go that way but all
[1:39:37] of a sudden the eagle got over there
[1:39:39] and it screamed out
[1:39:42] and said hey you never was a chicken to
[1:39:45] begin with
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:48] I don't know if y'all know this or not
[1:39:50] but I'm gonna drop this in right here
[1:39:52] but brother L was sitting in his living
[1:39:54] room and his two kids was there and the
[1:39:56] house and all of a sudden as he I
[1:39:58] believe he was reading a message book or
[1:40:00] something along that lines and all of a
[1:40:01] sudden hears he looks up and there's a
[1:40:04] light that come into his room and it
[1:40:06] begins to Circle and it goes down his
[1:40:08] hallway down to where his kids were at

[1:45:43] all the way around and I went all the
[1:45:46] way around that property right over
[1:45:47] there oh your trailer wasn't here yet
[1:45:49] and I took it all the way around
[1:45:52] yeah
[1:45:55] pushed and pushed the Dozer over and put
[1:45:58] her in park got off and brother Jeremy
[1:46:00] Shriner was here he's like man what's it
[1:46:02] going to do I said it's going to burn
[1:46:05] he said you ain't about it I said man
[1:46:07] this evening the fire is going to get
[1:46:09] the Rowan's going to get down and we're
[1:46:10] just going to have ourselves a good Tire
[1:46:12] so we got over there and I lit that dude
[1:46:15] up brother Jeremy he had one he lit it
[1:46:17] up and it was going just fine
[1:46:20] but I don't know what it is about a fire
[1:46:21] wind gets in it
[1:46:24] can be no wind and it seems like ain't
[1:46:26] blowing a long time but all of a sudden
[1:46:28] the fire starts and wind gets in it and
[1:46:31] buddy that wind got in that fire and it
[1:46:32] got bigger and it got bigger and then it
[1:46:35] got bigger and what I had planned didn't
[1:46:37] work out
[1:46:39] they found a spot right over there on
[1:46:41] that L shape of that property that
[1:46:43] wasn't quite wide enough here I thought
[1:46:45] I had it fixed where it's only going to
[1:46:46] go so far I thought I had it fixed it
[1:46:49] was only going to burn so much I thought
[1:46:51] I had it fixed it was only on but you
[1:46:53] know what that fire began to build up to
[1:46:55] such a point it jumped over what I
[1:46:57] thought
[1:47:00] Hallelujah I say let the wind get in the
[1:47:03] fire the wind of the Holy Ghost let it
[1:47:06] begin to build up in your life it'll
[1:47:09] jump over what you think it'll jump over
[1:47:12] what you think is possible and it'll go
[1:47:14] into impossibilities
[1:47:18] Hallelujah this fire is a fire that I
[1:47:21] can build
[1:47:23] this fire I'm talking about it's not one
[1:47:26] I put a match to this fire he put it to
[1:47:29] it
[1:47:32] and there ain't no wind there ain't no
[1:47:34] devil
[1:47:37] think about that a lot of times we
[1:47:39] create we we we bring the wind as the
[1:47:42] Holy Ghost and it is but you know the
[1:47:43] devil's got winds as well
[1:47:45] but even harder he blows at your fire
[1:47:47] the bigger it's going to get
[1:47:50] shh
[1:47:52] see
[1:47:53] hey man you better come with a little
[1:47:55] bitty flame out of Youth cam but it's a
[1:47:57] flame and the devil's finger
[1:48:02] you know man's always into he's always
[1:48:05] done what God's already done you know he
[1:48:08] made a mat you ever seen them candles
[1:48:10] you can blow them out and they pop right
[1:48:11] back on
[1:48:13] hello everybody man they still got them
[1:48:16] I think they do
[1:48:17] can't blow them out and they popped
[1:48:20] right back on and they popped right back
[1:48:22] on
[1:48:23] and it popped right back on that's what
[1:48:25] the devil's been trying to do this
[1:48:26] summer year
[1:48:28] he'd been trying to blow you out and all
[1:48:30] of a sudden the fires back up again
[1:48:32] [Applause]
[1:48:34] and he tries to blow it out back up
[1:48:36] again and it only makes it bigger it
[1:48:39] only makes it stronger it only makes it
[1:48:42] Greater
[1:48:44] let the wind of Satan blow all he wants
[1:48:47] to against this Church of the Living God
[1:48:49] she's only going to get greater she's
[1:48:51] only going to get bigger she's only
[1:48:53] going to have more power
[1:49:02] the dynamic power of God
[1:49:05] will answer their Quest To This Day
[1:49:09] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:49:10] forever there ain't no hen going to hold
[1:49:12] you
[1:49:14] Hallelujah
[1:49:19] an eagle a real Eagle recognizes the
[1:49:22] call of God's word an eagle to an eagle
[1:49:25] the word to the word
[1:49:27] Hallelujah the word predestinated you to
[1:49:30] the word written for the hour you
[1:49:33] realize your position he's hunting for
[1:49:35] it then this Earthly body is quickened
[1:49:38] brought by the earthquake and in spirit
[1:49:39] of God to obedience to the word of God
[1:49:41] quickly when he wanted to know how he
[1:49:44] could get there with her he had been
[1:49:46] taught he couldn't do that you can't get
[1:49:48] no higher than you can jump that's a
[1:49:51] chicken
[1:49:53] hello
[1:49:54] he said that was a chicken that said
[1:49:56] that you can't get no higher than you
[1:49:57] can jump he said but this ego said
[1:49:59] that's not so look at the chickens well
[1:50:02] look at no matter what their chickens
[1:50:03] are you're an eagle just start spreading
[1:50:06] those wings get a little exercise of
[1:50:08] them start moving up the word to the
[1:50:10] word the worst that I do shall you do
[1:50:13] also he that believeth in me the works
[1:50:15] that I do shall he do also because he
[1:50:18] lives I I live he lives also and of the
[1:50:21] spirit that raised him up from the dead
[1:50:23] dwells in you it'll Quicken your mortal
[1:50:26] body
[1:50:28] what does it do
[1:50:30] this Easter I want you to haunt it to me
[1:50:32] he says to me more to you than ever any
[1:50:34] other Easter ever did I want you to see
[1:50:36] it we know what it done for him
[1:50:40] I want you to see what it'll do for you
[1:50:44] it has done the same for you
[1:50:49] hello
[1:50:51] he raised a mortal body of a fleshly
[1:50:54] body up from the grave but greater than
[1:50:57] that is a spiritual body
[1:51:04] every one of them were born dead in sins
[1:51:09] dead as we could be to our own beliefs
[1:51:11] and our own ideas and our own thinking
[1:51:14] you said well brother Timothy this is a
[1:51:16] church full of holy people might have
[1:51:18] some holy people in it now but they
[1:51:19] wouldn't always holy
[1:51:22] no we were all born in sin and shaped
[1:51:25] iniquity born dead
[1:51:27] speaking lies
[1:51:31] laying in a grave
[1:51:34] seem to be no hope
[1:51:36] Satan is sealed it with a two it's still
[1:51:38] the Tomb of the Stone
[1:51:40] put a guard around it say there was no
[1:51:42] way you're going to get out of it well
[1:51:44] no way you're going to rise up above it
[1:51:46] well no way is going to live it with no
[1:51:48] way you could do it but light came down
[1:51:52] and that body that was dead and sins and
[1:51:56] wickedness and iniquities it raised out
[1:52:01] oh my and he rolled the stone that
[1:52:03] helped he broke all the seals off
[1:52:07] some of you had to seal a tobacco on
[1:52:09] your life some of you had to seal of
[1:52:11] alcohol on your life some of you had to
[1:52:13] seal a pornography on your life some of
[1:52:15] you had the Seal of lust on your life
[1:52:16] some of you had all kind of ungodly
[1:52:19] seals that had sealed you in a turn but
[1:52:21] he broke them
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:24] to tell you every devil seal is broke
[1:52:28] it is broken the Church of the Living
[1:52:30] God is a free Church freeing the liberty
[1:52:34] of God freeing the righteousness of God
[1:52:36] free in the spirit of God
[1:52:39] there is now no condemnation
[1:52:48] you once walked maybe with a big
[1:52:50] cigarette out of your mouth
[1:52:52] your women once had short hair and pain
[1:52:54] and painted up carried on shorts but
[1:52:58] something screamed
[1:52:59] and you look to it and it was the word
[1:53:01] of God
[1:53:02] no no more shorts for me
[1:53:04] no more liquor for me no more lying no
[1:53:07] more stealing no more of this or
[1:53:09] whatever the spirit that raised him up
[1:53:11] from the dead is now dwelling you is
[1:53:13] also brought your mortal bodies the dust
[1:53:15] of the earth into subjection subjection
[1:53:17] to what
[1:53:19] Christ
[1:53:22] amen these things that I think is all
[1:53:24] right for women to wear slacks the word
[1:53:27] says no
[1:53:28] so it quickens you to that you're drawn
[1:53:31] to it you become part of the word it
[1:53:33] brought your body subject
[1:53:40] well you say well let me tell you
[1:53:42] something my pastor I don't care what
[1:53:43] your pastor said it's what the word says
[1:53:51] you know we've had message girls that
[1:53:52] was in message churches that had gotten
[1:53:55] married and moved to another church and
[1:53:56] for the first time in their life they
[1:53:57] heard it was wrong to wear makeup
[1:54:01] raised up in a message Church
[1:54:05] listen I don't care what your pastor
[1:54:07] says is what the word says if you want
[1:54:09] to be a chicken go on and be a chicken
[1:54:13] but if the pastor speaks different in
[1:54:15] the word then he's not a feeder of
[1:54:16] eagles he's a feeder of chickens
[1:54:18] amen the Bible said it's wrong to do
[1:54:20] that and the man and so forth and all
[1:54:22] you do is wrong days of Miracles are
[1:54:24] passed that's wrong the Bible said he's
[1:54:26] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:54:28] said well that's just mental telepathy
[1:54:29] that's just some kind of mind reading
[1:54:31] this discernment all those Vision things
[1:54:33] nonsense they are to chickens
[1:54:37] they are to chickens they don't know
[1:54:39] what Eagle food is but brother when you
[1:54:41] hear that scream
[1:54:43] there's something in you you're an eagle
[1:54:46] to begin with you are that seed that
[1:54:48] resurrection of the s-o-n is dull and
[1:54:51] the wave sheath has weighed over you
[1:54:54] if the spirit that raised him from the
[1:54:56] dead the word the Dynamics of the word
[1:54:59] dwells in you it'll also Quicken your
[1:55:01] mortal body
[1:55:03] it'll bring it to life
[1:55:06] that spirit that once like to drink run
[1:55:08] around commit adultery quick it's now
[1:55:10] Quicken why the thing died and you're
[1:55:13] now resurrected Therefore your bodies is
[1:55:16] a temple of the Dynamics
[1:55:22] because from the beginning you were part
[1:55:25] of the mechanics
[1:55:27] hello
[1:55:29] did you catch that we've always been
[1:55:31] part of the mechanics
[1:55:33] I was in his mind before the foundation
[1:55:35] of the world I was a son before the
[1:55:37] founder the mechanics the word spoke of
[1:55:39] me
[1:55:41] but when he comes on the inside you're
[1:55:44] not just the Temple of the mechanics
[1:55:46] you're a temple of the Dynamics the
[1:55:49] spirit that lives on the inside of you
[1:55:51] and if that spirit that raised up Jesus
[1:55:54] from the grave dwells in you you
[1:55:56] potentially have life led by the spirit
[1:55:58] to Quicken you the word to you to
[1:56:00] believe it that little thing keeps
[1:56:01] pushing up as it grows notice at
[1:56:04] Pentecost and acts their bodies were
[1:56:07] quick in the new life look at a bunch of
[1:56:09] little cowards sitting there afraid
[1:56:10] afraid to claim the things of God pray
[1:56:13] to the claim what God had told him what
[1:56:15] Jesus has spoke but all of a sudden the
[1:56:17] Dynamics came and it not only filled
[1:56:19] their Spirit but it quickened their
[1:56:20] mechanics
[1:56:22] and their bodies were quick and they
[1:56:24] were no more cowards
[1:56:26] they went right into the face of the
[1:56:28] people and said you men of Judea and you
[1:56:30] that dwell in Jerusalem this is that
[1:56:34] what the prophet Joel spoke of
[1:56:36] so many people that are afraid that more
[1:56:39] some woman will laugh at you for having
[1:56:41] long hair or quit wearing makeup some of
[1:56:43] you men are afraid your organization
[1:56:44] will throw you out when you're baptized
[1:56:46] your congregation is spiritual baptism
[1:56:48] you need to close yourself into the
[1:56:50] upper room to the Dynamics come because
[1:56:52] it changed them it'll change you it
[1:56:55] quickened them it'll Quicken you it made
[1:56:57] them different it'll make you different
[1:56:59] they were to change people from that on
[1:57:01] it quickened them from the old life of
[1:57:03] being a coward to the lion of the tribe
[1:57:05] of Judah they're absolutely face martyr
[1:57:07] they nailed to the crosses crucified
[1:57:09] upside down burnt throwing lions dead no
[1:57:12] more cowards
[1:57:13] death had no victory over them Dynamics
[1:57:17] was now in the mechanics
[1:57:24] Quicken them till they spoke a Heavenly
[1:57:26] language
[1:57:30] he is the Dynamics we'll read a few here
[1:57:32] before we go he is a dynamics of the
[1:57:34] mechanics the mechanics of the church
[1:57:37] what is the mechanics Apostles preachers
[1:57:39] prophets teachers so forth he is the
[1:57:42] Dynamics that works that it works by
[1:57:45] certain Dynamic which is called the fire
[1:57:47] the fire that fires off the gas he's the
[1:57:51] fire that's in the combustion chamber
[1:57:52] and when the gas the word is poured over
[1:57:54] that combustion chamber he is the one
[1:57:57] that sets her fire he is the one that
[1:57:59] confirms it he is the power of the
[1:58:00] Resurrection he is God he is the fire
[1:58:03] and that's what he is
[1:58:06] mechanics ain't what runs an automobile
[1:58:08] is the Dynamics that runs it and
[1:58:11] mechanics will not run a church
[1:58:14] the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets
[1:58:17] them the word it's not the Seminary that
[1:58:19] can teach you Theology and Greek
[1:58:20] interpretation but the Dynamics of the
[1:58:22] Holy Ghost is there to set that a fire
[1:58:24] and to bring it to pass
[1:58:28] not the mechanics the Dynamics the word
[1:58:32] and spirit they are one that gives life
[1:58:36] said last night we have put so much of
[1:58:39] on the mechanics and not enough on the
[1:58:42] Dynamics he said my body is a mechanics
[1:58:45] and my body will not operate without
[1:58:47] dynamics of spirit the spirit operates
[1:58:50] my body no more in the automobile with
[1:58:52] no gasoline in it with no fire and power
[1:58:54] no matter how I'm finding the Dynamics
[1:58:55] or I'm the mechanics are mean the the
[1:58:57] cylinders the plugs the points whatever
[1:58:59] more you've got to have current also
[1:59:01] you've got to have those together that's
[1:59:03] the way God is and he said our
[1:59:06] educational system our denominational
[1:59:08] system has took the place of the Holy
[1:59:10] Spirit leading the church our great fine
[1:59:13] training of ministers and things has
[1:59:14] taken the place of the prayer meetings
[1:59:16] and all all-time way we used to get to
[1:59:19] God instead of having preachers we got
[1:59:21] lectures men that just knows the word
[1:59:23] just as well they can sit there and put
[1:59:25] it all together and wait there's just
[1:59:26] astounding they know the mechanics but
[1:59:29] they ain't got the Dynamics
[1:59:31] we want the Dynamics I don't care about
[1:59:34] the mechanics I want the Dynamics
[1:59:38] it's the prophet of God and the world
[1:59:40] Fallen apart he said I don't know how
[1:59:43] the how it works the car and how it all
[1:59:45] runs the Pistons and how this all works
[1:59:47] together I just know one thing if you
[1:59:50] put the Dynamics on there it'll make it
[1:59:52] drive
[1:59:55] I don't know how the car runs out there
[1:59:57] I don't know how all that works but if
[1:59:59] you put the Dynamics on it it'll make it
[2:00:02] dry that's what we know God made the
[2:00:04] promise I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[2:00:07] Flesh your sons and daughters shall
[2:00:09] prophesy how's he going to do it I don't
[2:00:11] know I just know the Dynamics of God's
[2:00:14] system that's the main thing
[2:00:18] he said we have studied the mechanics
[2:00:21] until it's become all mechanical
[2:00:28] what good is it if it's just mechanical
[2:00:30] it won't bring the spirit of God it
[2:00:33] won't bring the power of God where is
[2:00:35] that Pentecostal blessing that used to
[2:00:37] flow through the churches that's the
[2:00:39] reason our world is falling apart
[2:00:40] because we got away from the real
[2:00:41] principles of God and educated men into
[2:00:44] systems and things that's what got us
[2:00:47] into the condition we are today and I
[2:00:49] believe that's why our world is falling
[2:00:53] apart
[2:00:55] Mercy
[2:00:59] so many more
[2:01:02] I want to read this one
[2:01:06] so we'll write about what about it now
[2:01:08] brother Timothy
[2:01:09] what about the Dynamics
[2:01:14] what shall I do with Jesus called Christ
[2:01:16] the Dynamics
[2:01:18] of this church will be a refilling of
[2:01:22] the Holy Spirit
[2:01:23] that we have worked in small measure
[2:01:25] while The Headstone is coming down to
[2:01:27] unite to the body but when that head and
[2:01:30] body unites together the full power of
[2:01:33] the Holy Ghost will raise her up
[2:01:36] exactly like that even the dead that's
[2:01:39] dead in Christ for hundreds and
[2:01:40] thousands of years will raise up and the
[2:01:43] beauty of his Holiness and take a flight
[2:01:46] in the skies the Dynamics of this church
[2:01:49] is the Holy Ghost
[2:01:53] Hallelujah I say it won't be less
[2:01:55] Dynamics it's going to be more Dynamics
[2:01:58] and the Dynamics of this church will be
[2:02:01] and how porn of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:04] Hallelujah not unless Holy Ghost more
[2:02:07] Holy Ghost you know I got God I was got
[2:02:09] on to one time in another Youth Camp
[2:02:11] because I preached too strong in the
[2:02:12] Holy Ghost I said Lord if that's all I'm
[2:02:14] guilty of God hallelujah I'll be guilty
[2:02:18] of that I know we've got to have the
[2:02:20] Holy Ghost we've got to have the
[2:02:22] Dynamics moving in our midst we got to
[2:02:25] have the power that'll make this church
[2:02:27] not only run down the road but rise up
[2:02:29] in the air Amen to the dead in Christ
[2:02:32] will rise under the Dynamics of this
[2:02:34] church the dead in Christ will come up
[2:02:37] in that Resurrection under the Dynamics
[2:02:39] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost is
[2:02:41] coming upon us
[2:02:43] so don't look for Less
[2:02:45] look for more
[2:02:50] let's bow our hands
[2:02:54] a lot more things but I ain't got no
[2:02:56] more strength
[2:03:06] some of you
[2:03:13] need that spark
[2:03:19] or refilling
[2:03:28] some of you need to filling but there's
[2:03:29] many of you need to refilling
[2:03:32] because there's one feeling but many
[2:03:33] refillings
[2:03:42] the devil of course wants to tell you
[2:03:44] you never got nothing
[2:03:49] just going back in the same old hole
[2:03:52] you know
[2:03:54] I am mechanics
[2:03:56] and I am a vessel of the Dynamics
[2:04:05] maybe you feel like you've been flopping
[2:04:07] a little bit
[2:04:08] flopping around from one feeling to
[2:04:10] another and one thing to another why
[2:04:12] don't you just keep flopping
[2:04:14] just keep moving them wings
[2:04:17] the winds are going to blow
[2:04:24] it's not going to be winds sure might be
