[30:24] straight into the word this morning
[30:25] we'll turn to the book of second
[30:28] Corinthians chapter number four second
[30:31] Corinthians chapter number four while
[30:34] you're turning there I just like to say
[30:35] it's been an honor and a privilege to be
[30:37] invited to be here this weekend and to
[30:40] be able to speak with ruther Donnie and
[30:42] I tell you that was a masterpiece last
[30:44] night I'm glad we got dynamite this
[30:47] morning aren't you a man and it
[30:49] certainly has been an honor my heart has
[30:51] been touched and life has been changed
[30:53] and sure appreciate the opportunity to
[30:56] be here this weekend and sure want to
[30:57] thank all the workers all the staff all
[31:00] the ministry everything that has gone
[31:01] into this camp may God richly bless you
[31:04] this morning all the counselors all the
[31:07] drivers everything to make these
[31:09] meetings possible I say God bless you
[31:12] and brother Tim we sure do appreciate
[31:13] him amen the burden to have this camp
[31:16] and the consistency of this meeting just
[31:20] every year growing and every year young
[31:23] people even changed I thank God for a
[31:25] burden like that amen amen
[31:27] god bless you this morning second
[31:29] Corinthians chapter number four and
[31:31] verse number one the Bible says
[31:34] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[31:37] as we have received we faint not but
[31:41] have renounced the hidden things of
[31:44] dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor
[31:47] handling the Word of God deceitfully but
[31:51] by manifestation of the truth commending
[31:54] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[31:56] the sight of God but if our gospel be
[31:59] hid - it is here to them that are lost
[32:02] remember says if that's not
[32:04] predestination I don't know what is in
[32:07] whom the god of this world hath blinded
[32:10] the minds of them which believe not lest
[32:13] the light of the glorious gospel of
[32:16] Christ who is the image of God should
[32:19] shine unto them notice for we preach not
[32:21] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[32:24] ourselves your servants for Jesus sake
[32:27] for God who commanded the light to shine
[32:30] darkness hath shined in our hearts to
[32:34] give the light of the knowledge of the
[32:36] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[32:38] but we have this treasure in earthen
[32:40] vessels that the excellency of the power
[32:44] may be of God and not of us now notice
[32:46] verse number 8 for we are troubled on
[32:49] every side yet not distressed we are
[32:54] perplexed but not in despair we are
[32:59] persecuted but not forsaken cast down I
[33:03] love this one but not destroyed always
[33:07] bearing about in the body the dying of
[33:10] our Lord Jesus that the life also of
[33:12] Jesus might be made manifest in our body
[33:15] for we which for we which live are
[33:18] always delivered unto death for Jesus
[33:19] sake
[33:20] notice that the life also of Jesus might
[33:23] be made manifest in our mortal flesh I
[33:28] want you to notice something right there
[33:30] Paul did not say that the life of Jesus
[33:32] might be made manifest in our immortal
[33:35] flesh but that the life of Jesus might
[33:38] be made manifest in our mortal flesh so
[33:40] that tells me that before this mortal
[33:43] takes on immortality there's going to be
[33:45] somebody manifesting the victory and the
[33:48] power and the overcoming grace of Jesus
[33:51] Christ and I don't mind telling you I
[33:53] believe I'm looking at a generation this
[33:55] morning that's not waiting on the
[33:57] Millenium to have victory but they've
[33:58] got victory right here this morning
[34:00] they're not waiting on the future home
[34:02] to have victory but they got victory
[34:04] right here this morning let's just bow
[34:06] our heads together Heavenly Father we
[34:08] love you today dear God we thank you for
[34:10] your mercy in your grace Lord we thank
[34:12] you for waking us up this morning dear
[34:14] God with a mind to serve you
[34:15] or do we thank you for all that you have
[34:17] done this weekend Lord father there is
[34:20] no way that we could stand here this
[34:21] morning as any mortal man and take
[34:24] credit for the things that you have done
[34:25] this weekend Lord I believe that
[34:27] sicknesses have been healed
[34:29] I believe that diseases have been
[34:31] defeated I believe that demons have been
[34:33] cast out Lord and ultimately I believe
[34:35] that the Holy Ghost and fire has filled
[34:38] vessels all across this building and for
[34:40] that Lord we want to say thank you
[34:42] Father I pray this morning dear God that
[34:45] as we have gathered here on this this
[34:46] Easter morning this resurrection morning
[34:49] Lord as the Sun has risen outside and
[34:51] what a beautiful morning it is the Lord
[34:54] what a beautiful morning it is on the
[34:56] inside of this building dear God Lord to
[34:59] know that hearts that were bound have
[35:00] been set free by the rising not of the
[35:02] SU n but of the rising of the Esso and
[35:05] God I pray this morning he would come in
[35:08] and strengthen us Lord as we prepare or
[35:10] to look into your word for just a few
[35:11] moments this morning dear God feed us
[35:13] Lord Father give us something that we
[35:16] can take from this camp that will
[35:18] sustain us Lord grant it today dear God
[35:20] we pray in Jesus Christ's name and all
[35:23] the believers said hey man god bless you
[35:27] as you may be seated this morning I want
[35:30] to by the help of the Lord to speak to
[35:32] you for a few moments here up on this
[35:35] thought and if I would title it I would
[35:37] like to speak to you on another paradox
[35:40] another paradox I read here in the book
[35:44] of 2nd Corinthians chapter number 4
[35:46] and verse number 8 we are troubled on
[35:49] every side yet not distressed anybody
[35:52] that is troubled should be distressed we
[35:55] are perplexed but we are not in despair
[35:58] we are persecuted but we are not
[36:01] forsaken we are cast down but not
[36:04] destroyed I think of how that that right
[36:06] there is nothing more and nothing less
[36:08] than a paradox this morning if anybody
[36:12] in the in the world if anybody in the in
[36:15] the country that we live in this morning
[36:16] if anybody has any troubles or any
[36:19] situations or any problems or any
[36:21] circumstances it's the bride of Jesus
[36:24] Christ and we know as brother Donnie
[36:26] mentioned that the devil has already
[36:28] deceived all those churches out there
[36:30] he's already deceived hundreds if not
[36:33] thousands if not millions of people this
[36:35] morning but there's only one group of
[36:37] people on the face of the earth this
[36:39] morning that the devil is really
[36:41] interested in defeating and that is you
[36:43] because he knows that your name is on
[36:46] more than just a church role he knows
[36:48] that your name is on
[36:50] more than just the church membership but
[36:53] he knows that your name is in the Lamb's
[36:55] Book of Life and the Bible says in
[36:57] Revelation that they all Amen worship
[36:59] the image of the Beast except for those
[37:01] whose name was on the Lamb's Book of
[37:04] Life so what is Satan going to do
[37:06] Satan is only going to intense the
[37:08] pressure he is only going to turn up the
[37:11] fiery furnace as it was he's only going
[37:13] to do whatever he can to put more
[37:16] pressure up on you he meant to put more
[37:18] troubles up on you to try to get you to
[37:20] bow or to try to get you to give in or
[37:23] just say well you know maybe after all I
[37:25] didn't get nothing out of that camp
[37:26] maybe it was just emotion or maybe it
[37:29] was just sensation but I want to tell
[37:30] you this morning Church that the battle
[37:33] for truth is on but don't be nervous
[37:35] because the mighty Conqueror is already
[37:38] here amen the mighty Conqueror is
[37:41] already in you amen to bring you not to
[37:43] any kind of end amen but to an expected
[37:46] and I think of what Jeremiah said when
[37:48] he said I know the folks that I have
[37:50] towards you saith the Lord they are not
[37:52] thoughts of evil they are not thoughts
[37:54] of destruction but they are thoughts of
[37:56] peace amen
[37:57] the thoughts of God this morning
[37:59] concerning you amen are the thoughts of
[38:02] peace where is he wanting to bring you
[38:03] he's wanting to bring you to an expected
[38:06] end I can only tell you one thing this
[38:08] morning young people take your position
[38:11] in the army of the Living God and fight
[38:13] for your position like you've never
[38:15] fought before but then sit in this
[38:17] battle for truth
[38:18] he said all them ins that has been lost
[38:20] he said but God said that they would be
[38:22] restored again in the last day Joel said
[38:24] I will restore saith the LORD we went
[38:27] through that not long ago he said in the
[38:28] bribed tree but he said right here this
[38:30] morning we're looking for him we're
[38:32] looking for his manifestation and we'll
[38:35] see the vindicated Word of God and there
[38:37] will be just a few understand it as it
[38:40] was in the days of Noah so will it be in
[38:43] the coming of the son of man what was
[38:45] say five souls in the days of law there
[38:47] was three saved amen and the wife
[38:49] started out but she lost so shall it be
[38:52] in the coming of the Son of man so this
[38:54] morning
[38:55] amen victory is not promised they meant
[38:57] to those that can start amen but victory
[39:00] is promised
[39:01] those that can start and to those that
[39:04] can finish the race what what good does
[39:06] it do to start a race if you do not
[39:08] finish it but can I can i prophesy to
[39:10] you from the word this morning
[39:12] the word says you're going to finish the
[39:14] race you're going to run the last mile
[39:16] and let me tell your brother you're
[39:18] going to cross the finish line and then
[39:21] there wasn't enough Devils that can stop
[39:23] you from starting there ain't enough
[39:24] Devils that can stop you from running
[39:26] and there ain't gonna be enough Devils
[39:28] that can stop you from Tennyson greater
[39:30] is He that is in us and he that is in
[39:33] the world
[39:33] amen if there's only gonna be one going
[39:36] in the rapture amen it's gonna be me if
[39:39] there's only one leaving Dry Creek
[39:41] Louisiana you know rapture this water
[39:43] it's gonna be me you said brother ender
[39:45] how can you have that testimony because
[39:47] I judged him faithful who made the
[39:50] promise I I didn't touch him it's just a
[39:52] Polish soothsayer I didn't touch him as
[39:55] a devil I touched him as hello him I
[39:57] touched him it's the Living God and then
[40:00] think this morning Church think of it
[40:02] for just a minute
[40:03] amen that many have started this race
[40:05] but look where many are this morning
[40:07] amen many have run the same house that
[40:10] you ran last night but look where they
[40:12] are this morning amen but there is
[40:14] something different about you there is
[40:16] the seed that is laying on the inside of
[40:18] your hearts and the father said all that
[40:20] he has gathered me I will not lose or
[40:23] whatever brother
[40:24] he ain't gonna lose you when you get
[40:25] home he ain't gonna lose you when you
[40:27] get back to school
[40:29] when you get back on the target hey that
[40:32] our God will never lose his old me that
[40:36] we forsake his own in a little while
[40:38] then the world see me no more but she
[40:41] shall see me proud not only be with you
[40:44] but I'll even be in you and a prophet
[40:47] said this morning there are going to be
[40:48] some easy at the end of the world and
[40:51] you are those years is it that beautiful
[40:56] to know this morning that you are the
[40:58] ease that's going to see the Lord in the
[41:02] Prophet said there will vary there will
[41:05] be a very few saved and translated in
[41:07] that time he said but one of the
[41:09] mysteries is that the church is going to
[41:12] be taken up now this is what I like the
[41:14] church is not going to be taken down but
[41:17] the church is going to be taken up well
[41:21] a devil don't like that but it's the
[41:24] truth anyhow the church is not going to
[41:26] go down amen but the church is going to
[41:29] go up see like lot was taken block was
[41:32] taken out Noah was taken in but this
[41:35] church will be taken up seek one whinny
[41:38] and remember says one went out but the
[41:40] other one goes up now in the Adam days
[41:43] man went out Adam covenant burns broke
[41:45] and man went out in Noah's day the end
[41:48] alluvion destruction amen man went in
[41:51] the ark Amen but in this day somebody
[41:53] say this day in this day we're living in
[41:56] the day of the revealing of the sin of
[41:58] man we're not going out we're not going
[42:01] in we're going up we're not going out to
[42:05] the world we're not going into the
[42:07] things of the world but we're going up
[42:09] in the rapture but man says what a
[42:11] consolation is to get this nation which
[42:13] has the church then to know that this
[42:15] man being sent to them speaking of
[42:17] Elijah they meant to represent God had
[42:19] went home without even dying that had
[42:22] been raptured and taken up a very
[42:24] beautiful time Elijah was of this day we
[42:28] may be a little beat line off the path
[42:29] with what some believes but I kindly
[42:32] believe that there will be a message in
[42:34] the last days huh I believe this morning
[42:36] we are gathered
[42:37] hearing that message of the last days
[42:39] something like Elijah and that Elijah
[42:42] Church will not die oh my god that'll
[42:47] hide your church will not die but will
[42:49] be translated and will be taken up he
[42:52] said what's going to take it up fire
[42:54] will take it up in the glory the
[42:57] Pentecostal fire will rapture the church
[43:00] off of the earth and we'll take her up
[43:02] into glory
[43:03] how many can say last night's you felt
[43:05] that Pentecostal fire
[43:07] how many can say last night you felt
[43:09] that Pentecostal fire burning in your
[43:11] soul amen moving through your body reach
[43:14] hearts and your spirits you felt that
[43:15] fire and then all of a sudden we all
[43:18] know what it feels like when it begins
[43:19] to lift up we know that it's beginning
[43:22] to lift up off of us
[43:23] amen but I love what a prophet said he
[43:25] said don't get nervous
[43:26] he said you love it when it comes and
[43:28] you don't like it when it leaves he said
[43:30] but don't worry one of these days when
[43:33] it leaves you're gonna last night we
[43:45] [Applause]
[43:55] [Applause]
[44:06] [Applause]
[44:12] don't worry Church one of these days
[44:15] when it leaves we're gonna give my last
[44:19] days he said he would pour out his
[44:21] spirit upon all flesh and he did see
[44:26] that was not just the prophecy but there
[44:28] was a fulfillment you see God actually
[44:30] promised what has happened here this
[44:32] weekend in his word he promised it would
[44:35] happen now we look at the word paradox
[44:37] what do we find out we find that a
[44:39] paradox Amen is something that is
[44:42] incredible but it's true something that
[44:46] is incredible but it's true Bible says
[44:48] may the Lord at the blessings of the
[44:50] reading of this word now this subject
[44:52] this afternoon a paradox the word
[44:55] paradoxes I've just been looking up he
[44:57] said according to Webster it is
[44:59] something incredible ayman but it's true
[45:02] now you know we've heard the old saying
[45:04] that truth is more stranger than fiction
[45:06] hearing her that truth it's more
[45:09] stranger than fiction because when a
[45:11] person tells the truth sometimes it
[45:14] seems very strange now do you see why
[45:17] that the devil hates the truth because
[45:20] the truth exposes him the truth exposes
[45:25] who the devil is the truth exposes the
[45:28] power and it's trying to hold you you
[45:30] say what is truth truth is a very
[45:32] powerful thing
[45:33] amen now this may sound strange but we
[45:35] live in a generation where people would
[45:37] rather hear lies then they would hear
[45:40] they would rather hear fiction then they
[45:42] would rather hear truth they say can you
[45:44] prove that yes there is people that will
[45:47] deny the virgin birth when we've had a
[45:49] Bible declare it
[45:51] we have the stars in the heaven declared
[45:53] we had patriarchs declare its we had
[45:55] prophets declared and we've got many
[45:57] infallible proofs that there was amen a
[46:01] virgin birth and people still denies but
[46:04] they believe that there's an Easter
[46:05] Bunny that hops around planting eggs in
[46:08] your front yard or they believe that
[46:09] there's a Santa Claus amen that flies
[46:12] around the earth and one night and drop
[46:14] oh don't get cloud on me and drops all
[46:16] kinds of presents ho see that's the age
[46:18] we've come to they would rather have fix
[46:21] and then they would have truth and
[46:23] that's why they're bound with sin that's
[46:25] why they're bound with shame but listen
[46:27] you've not been called a meant to be a
[46:29] generation of fiction you not been
[46:32] pulled to be a generation to follow
[46:34] cunningly devised fables and men's idea
[46:36] you've been called a men to believe a
[46:39] message that it's got power in it
[46:41] brother brother sister don't tell me
[46:44] this morning Church we don't have that
[46:58] Jesus Christ it's not laying in a grave
[47:01] in Jerusalem this morning
[47:03] and he's well and he's livid and he's
[47:07] breathing and he's healing and he's
[47:09] saving and he's manifesting and he's
[47:11] breaking change brings you this morning
[47:14] our not a fiction story your testimony
[47:18] is not a fiction testimony it's a real
[47:21] testimony it's got real power it's a day
[47:30] of time where no matter how many times
[47:32] you prove something they'll still stand
[47:34] right there and say it didn't happen
[47:38] because it's a generation of fiction now
[47:42] I want to preached it for a few minutes
[47:44] on some paradoxes is that okay
[47:48] paradoxes it was a paradox that a 99
[47:52] year old man and a hundred year old
[47:55] woman could bring forth for son it was a
[48:00] paradox that a man that was full of
[48:03] theology a men that was full of all
[48:05] kinds of learning but he didn't have
[48:07] fire could get in the presence of a
[48:10] burning bush and in five minutes time
[48:13] what he had learned for 40 years he lost
[48:16] in five minutes time in the presence of
[48:19] my God in the presence of the pillar of
[48:21] fire don't you see why the devil's mad
[48:23] this morning don't you really see wise
[48:25] man is because ever since she was born
[48:28] he's been working on you he's been
[48:31] trying to bind you he's been trying to
[48:33] spare you he's been trying to defeat you
[48:35] and in just a few moments of time this
[48:38] weekend the devil's Kingdom has fallen
[48:41] to the ground
[48:43] in just a few moments okay 20 years of
[48:46] water
[48:46] seniors 113 years of work 14 years of
[48:50] work in just a few minutes mother was
[48:53] laying at his feet and Jesus Oh tell me
[49:00] this don't tell me that God came destroy
[49:02] Hey
[49:03] missed a few days ago I don't wanna I
[49:05] don't want to get into this too much but
[49:06] just a few days ago there was a
[49:08] cathedral Amen that had been standing
[49:10] for hundreds of years it had been
[49:12] standing for hundreds of years but in
[49:14] just a few moments of time when it
[49:16] caught on fire
[49:17] Oh God in just a few moments a time when
[49:21] it caught on fire
[49:24] underneath it's a mystery how that
[50:00] immortal man got in the presence of fire
[50:03] and was changed by a burning bush it's
[50:07] another mystery how did a woman a man
[50:10] who was a harlot who is living in a city
[50:12] that was to be destroyed
[50:14] it's another paradox here it's a paradox
[50:17] that she took a scarlet robe and hung it
[50:22] out her window and every building around
[50:25] her was fallen
[50:26] except for that house Oh God ever
[50:30] building around her was falling ever a
[50:33] house around her was Poland ever Church
[50:35] around there was fallen every person
[50:37] around her was died amen but that house
[50:40] stood
[50:41] it was a paradox it was incredible
[50:44] but oh it was true brother sister can I
[50:46] tell you in the Prophet said he said
[50:48] that scarlet robe was a symbol of the
[50:51] token he said that token on this plane
[50:54] let's sit death angel no you got no
[50:56] rights in this house
[50:58] how many can say this morning I've got
[51:00] the token how many can say I've got the
[51:03] token if you don't have the token then
[51:05] let me tell you before this meeting is
[51:08] dismissed this morning you can have the
[51:10] token Church I'm gonna do I'm gonna take
[51:15] my Jesus Christ Himself has given to me
[51:45] our church don't think this morning that
[51:49] it's crazy these things these things may
[51:51] seem crazy but remember they're true it
[51:55] was a paradox that a man by the name of
[51:58] no a man could go out and gather a bunch
[52:01] of gopher wood he could gather that
[52:03] worse kind of gopher wood or the worst
[52:05] kind of wood you could you could gather
[52:07] he could go out and gather that would
[52:09] aim it and bring it together and then
[52:11] say what are you doing Noah he said I'm
[52:13] building an ark I'm building our what do
[52:16] you build an ark for because the Lord
[52:18] told me you go down and build an ark it
[52:22] was a paradox it was incredible but was
[52:25] it true you say brother Andrew is it a
[52:28] paradox aiming that a man by the name of
[52:30] Enoch a man walked with God for hundreds
[52:34] of years my he walked with God for
[52:37] hundreds of years and you know what he
[52:39] did he had fellowship with God it's a
[52:42] paradox
[52:42] then a man got up one morning anyway
[52:45] near maybe and told his wife he said
[52:47] honey it's time for me to go for my
[52:49] daily walk she said okay we'll see you
[52:51] this evening I can imagine in the back
[52:54] part of his mind he said maybe you may
[52:57] see me and you may not aim it and he
[52:59] takes off walking and while he's walking
[53:01] man he just starts fellowshipping with
[53:03] Jesus he just starts filling shipping
[53:05] with the Lord maybe they get to walking
[53:07] and he gets to tell the Lord about @ap
[53:09] just listen - he gets to tell the Lord
[53:11] about a scripture he just read that
[53:13] morning and he began feeling shipment he
[53:16] began filling shipping with the Lord
[53:17] back and forth and they got so caught up
[53:19] in the spirit brother Brad that they
[53:21] just kept on walking and the further
[53:23] they were walking the farther they were
[53:25] getting from Enochs house and the closer
[53:27] they were getting to God's house Church
[53:30] can I tell you this morning you're not a
[53:32] million miles away from your father's
[53:34] house you're just another turn in the
[53:37] road it's just another pin in the road
[53:39] it's just another corner it's just
[53:42] another child away and you'll be back at
[53:45] Papa's house it was a paradox that a man
[53:48] like that a man could walk with God for
[53:51] all those years and keep a testimony
[53:53] that he pleased God it was a paradox
[53:58] that a man by the name of Shamgar could
[54:02] come in the house one day and say honey
[54:04] I'm sick and tired I'm sick and tired of
[54:07] these demons coming in in the form of
[54:10] Philistines and still in our Crump every
[54:12] year I'm sick and tired of these demons
[54:15] coming in and leaving my kids ragged and
[54:18] leaving my wife with no clothes and
[54:20] they're skinny and their muscles are
[54:23] leaving them there's no food to eat
[54:24] their clothes are barely hanging on
[54:26] their soldiers my kids are starving I'm
[54:28] sick and tired of it
[54:30] you know what it's a paradox that a man
[54:32] picked up an ox coat come on church I'm
[54:36] going somewhere to stay with me it's a
[54:38] paradox that a man picked up an ox code
[54:41] and he ran and jumped out the window
[54:43] maybe Luther said and got down there and
[54:45] met sick
[54:46] hundred armed Philistines and you know
[54:49] what he did when he met him he didn't
[54:51] meet him with fear but he met him with
[54:53] faith he didn't meet him in defeats he
[54:56] met him with victory already in his
[54:58] heart and he went out there and he began
[55:00] to sling that ox coat he begin to sling
[55:03] that ox coat and before long six hundred
[55:06] armed four listings were no longer
[55:08] standing but they were laying at the
[55:11] feet of sambar
[55:13] Verlander that's too hard to believe no
[55:16] that's not fiction that's truth it's a
[55:20] paradox then I go just a bit farther
[55:22] it's a paradox Amen that Samson wouldn't
[55:26] meet for this things one day when he
[55:28] would meet those Philistines he would
[55:30] meet them a thousand of them but before
[55:32] Samson ever met the first Philistine God
[55:36] already had a predestinated weapon that
[55:39] he would pick up and he would get a hold
[55:41] of can you say man God already had a
[55:43] weapon laying right there you say
[55:46] brother Andrew what was that weapon it
[55:47] was a jawbone of a mule that had died a
[55:51] long time ago remember says how long
[55:53] that that jawbone laid there he said it
[55:56] lay there no doubt for a long time it
[55:58] was old it was brittle he said just
[56:00] barely picking it up it should've fell
[56:02] apart are you with me just barely
[56:05] picking it up it should've fell apart he
[56:08] said but Samson obeyed God and he
[56:10] reached over and picked up that dry tall
[56:13] bone of that mule and he took that thing
[56:15] and before he knew it he would slay it
[56:17] Philistines and the prophet of God said
[56:19] if God could come down and get into a
[56:22] dead soul bone my God if God could come
[56:28] down
[56:29] [Applause]
[56:52] [Applause]
[57:04] I'll tell you what he's a miracle worker
[57:07] this morning it was a miracle that David
[57:10] Slade laughs it was a miracle that Noah
[57:13] saved eight souls on a ship that was
[57:15] made out of the worst kind of wood it
[57:17] was a miracle that Samson slain a
[57:19] thousand Philistines it was a miracle
[57:21] that Shamgar slayed 604 listings it was
[57:24] a miracle that Rahab's house was saved
[57:26] only by scarlet robe Oh
[57:29] what's another paradox is a young person
[57:34] is a young person under the greatest
[57:45] weight that is ever pen brother Graham
[57:51] said may we see tonight the living
[57:53] Christ who is not dead but as raised
[57:55] again for our justification now lives
[57:58] among us in the person of the Holy Ghost
[58:00] and may he come tonight and speak to
[58:02] every heart that is visible and
[58:04] invisible and may he perform in their
[58:07] hearts the work of the new birth and
[58:09] bring them to redemption power of his
[58:11] resurrection taken away all shadows
[58:14] about to them believe and destroy in all
[58:17] skepticism destroying all skepticism now
[58:22] there is the key skepticism skepticism
[58:25] comes in and people become skeptics
[58:28] rather than believers he said let the
[58:31] Spirit of God destroy all step to system
[58:34] that the church amen might move on in
[58:37] perfect harmony with the will of God
[58:39] do you realize what these meetings have
[58:41] been these meetings have been a tuning
[58:44] up these meetings have been a tuning up
[58:48] of bringing together of bringing back
[58:51] into harmony don't worry I ain't gonna
[58:53] preach all day I can't even notice this
[58:56] it's a bringing together the harmony
[58:59] it's bringing together of instruments
[59:01] listen church you're not just young
[59:03] people your instruments this morning
[59:06] your instruments this morning and do you
[59:08] realize the main thing and instruments
[59:10] got to be it's got to be in tune it's
[59:14] got to be in tune now this may sound
[59:16] funny but just stay with me for a second
[59:18] I don't know what it was a few years ago
[59:20] I got this big burden on my heart of
[59:22] this I don't know if it was a if it was
[59:24] a zeal if it was a passion I don't know
[59:26] what it was but it was a it was a desire
[59:28] to learn to play the banjo be quite Jo
[59:36] Jo can't even play static on the radio
[59:41] least I went got a banjo hey man I went
[59:47] and done a banjo no it was the funniest
[59:49] thing when I walked in there I said I
[59:50] want a banjo he said what kind I said I
[59:53] don't know he said well what kind do you
[59:55] want
[59:55] I said I sir I told you I don't know he
[59:57] said well what come any strings I don't
[59:59] even know how many they got but I just
[1:00:00] want to learn to play one he said she
[1:00:03] said sir
[1:00:04] do you have a book I said what kind of
[1:00:05] book he said of learners book I said no
[1:00:07] don't have that he said okay well here's
[1:00:09] what you need and he give me all this
[1:00:11] stuff and said now we're going to set
[1:00:12] you up with an instructor now I bought a
[1:00:14] brand-new banjo brother Mike Michael a
[1:00:16] brand-new banjo brand-new just off the
[1:00:18] shelf it was a beginner it was a cheap
[1:00:20] when it was a beginner when I mean I
[1:00:21] thought I was you know I was really
[1:00:23] gonna learn to do this so I went in
[1:00:25] there and sit down in the room and the
[1:00:26] guy picked it up and he said okay we're
[1:00:28] gonna have your first lesson he's
[1:00:29] sitting out here let me tune it I said
[1:00:31] no wait a minute sir it's it's it's it's
[1:00:33] brand-new it don't need to be tuned he
[1:00:36] said oh no it needs to be tuned I said
[1:00:37] no I just bought it out here in your
[1:00:39] store it's a brand new he said well no
[1:00:41] you see it's out of tune I said how can
[1:00:43] it be brand-new and be out of tune he he
[1:00:48] said well he said when it left the shop
[1:00:50] he said when it left the factory it was
[1:00:52] in tune he said but it's been through a
[1:00:55] lot of things it's been on trucks it's
[1:00:57] been an airplanes it's been through a
[1:00:59] lot of things he said so before we can
[1:01:02] start getting music I love it we gotta
[1:01:04] clean it up old church bones hurts don't
[1:01:08] you see this morning
[1:01:12] [Applause]
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:47] [Applause]
[1:01:54] [Applause]
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:02:00] [Applause]
[1:02:02] that's ready to leave we're going to be
[1:02:08] another paradox that the church that
[1:02:14] come into harmony with the will of God
[1:02:18] as presented by the Bible and the Holy
[1:02:24] Ghost so do you see you can be in
[1:02:28] harmony but you can be in harmony with
[1:02:30] the wrong thing you can be in harmony
[1:02:33] with just an emotion and when you get
[1:02:36] home you'll be attitude you can be in
[1:02:40] harmony Amen with just a feeling and
[1:02:42] when you get home you'll be out of tune
[1:02:44] but if you ever get back in divine
[1:02:47] harmony he said now there's many critics
[1:02:51] he said but we stand here tonight in
[1:02:53] harmony but now notice there's many
[1:02:55] critics but how that God ever display
[1:02:57] himself to his people someone says well
[1:02:59] where is this God you talk so much about
[1:03:01] he said in Africa in the fields there
[1:03:04] there is a word they used column Oya
[1:03:05] which means an unseen force like the
[1:03:08] wind your God he says the unseen God he
[1:03:11] is like the wind he's the power but we
[1:03:14] don't see him John chapter 12 some
[1:03:18] Greeks came to see Jesus and they said
[1:03:20] sirs we would see Jesus and they
[1:03:23] taken to him by one of his disciples
[1:03:25] Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same
[1:03:28] yesterday today and forever now notice
[1:03:30] this they said sirs we want to see Jesus
[1:03:33] that was their hearts desire sirs we
[1:03:36] want to see Jesus and you know what he
[1:03:37] said and one of his disciples to seeker
[1:03:42] into the presence of Jesus young people
[1:03:44] don't you see what this message is come
[1:03:46] to do it's come to make you disciples
[1:03:48] when somebody says is there a Living God
[1:03:52] is he still performing works is he still
[1:03:54] performing miracles
[1:03:55] is he still setting people free you
[1:03:57] don't have to say well let me call my
[1:03:58] pastor let me call my favorite preacher
[1:04:00] let me call the deacon stand up on your
[1:04:04] own two feet and say you want to see a
[1:04:06] miracle we can find ourselves now I know
[1:04:42] this sounds rational but if you'll just
[1:04:44] bear with us a few minutes he said I
[1:04:46] believe that I by God's help with this
[1:04:50] word and according to his word I can
[1:04:53] bring him right here before you why did
[1:04:59] he come in these meetings this weekend
[1:05:02] because the prophet of God said if that
[1:05:05] vine ever puts forth another branch it
[1:05:08] will be a Pentecostal book of Acts Holy
[1:05:14] Ghost field Holy Ghost manifesting
[1:05:18] branch I want you to get something here
[1:05:23] if that vine ever puts forth another
[1:05:25] branch so you say well that that must be
[1:05:28] an adult that must just be a preacher
[1:05:31] that just must be somebody great he said
[1:05:33] no you Christians right now
[1:05:36] how many questions new questions right
[1:05:40] now are here to find consolation and to
[1:05:43] come into that presence of God and can
[1:05:45] raise you up just like he did back then
[1:05:48] see this morning church it's not just a
[1:05:51] myth it just not some words put together
[1:05:54] it's not just the Jewish fable it is the
[1:05:57] truth
[1:05:58] see where there is so much air there has
[1:06:00] got to be some truth somewhere brother
[1:06:03] can I tell you this morning if there's a
[1:06:05] lot of error around this message that's
[1:06:07] because there's some truth in it if
[1:06:10] there's a lot of nonsense around this
[1:06:12] word that's because there's truth in
[1:06:14] this word friends let me say this with
[1:06:16] all of my hearts
[1:06:17] don't ever let anybody take the power of
[1:06:20] this message away from you
[1:06:22] this said brother ender how can you say
[1:06:24] that because this message changed my
[1:06:27] life I'm a witness this morning if you
[1:06:29] ever get more than just a quote book if
[1:06:32] you ever get more than just a picture if
[1:06:34] you ever get up god if you ever get a
[1:06:38] personal experience let's rebuild world
[1:06:41] in the depths of your soul it won't be
[1:06:43] you holding yourself holy what is it
[1:06:50] Church it's a prophecy it's a prophecy
[1:06:55] of the end time I'm hurrying it's a
[1:06:57] prophecy of the end time but many will
[1:06:59] fall under the air they will fall under
[1:07:03] the air and by falling under the air
[1:07:05] their hearts will be turned away from
[1:07:08] the truth and turned unto fables don't
[1:07:12] you see that's what the devil wants you
[1:07:13] to leave this weekend and do is just say
[1:07:15] it was a fable it was just another youth
[1:07:20] camp it was just another prayer line no
[1:07:23] it wasn't it was not just another prayer
[1:07:27] line it was a Kraken it was a poppet
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:55] no sir the garlic see blades what did it
[1:07:59] say has blinded the minds of them which
[1:08:02] believe not you see what's happening
[1:08:06] he's blinding the minds of them that
[1:08:09] believe not but at the same time the god
[1:08:14] of this evil age is blinding the minds
[1:08:17] of those that believe not the Son of Man
[1:08:20] the Son of man has been here this
[1:08:23] weekend
[1:08:24] turn in your heart I got turned in your
[1:08:28] heart don't you see what he's done he's
[1:08:30] picked up your heart and courage your
[1:08:36] heart back to himself I want to speak
[1:08:40] about another paradox for a second it
[1:08:42] was a paradox of a young girl by the
[1:08:44] name of Esther I can't preach this like
[1:08:49] where the Jo priest in Africa but I'm
[1:08:50] sure gonna pull something from it it was
[1:08:53] a paradox that a girl that was born coma
[1:08:57] that a girl that was born but she wanted
[1:09:01] to go in and see the King I'm gonna hurt
[1:09:04] here but there was a fear there if I go
[1:09:07] in and you're not accepted you'll be
[1:09:09] killed but there come a time that she
[1:09:13] met desperation and because she did not
[1:09:17] bow to her fear but she took faith and
[1:09:20] said listen if I perish then let me
[1:09:25] perish but I'm going to see the king
[1:09:30] listen Church can you imagine when she
[1:09:34] told her
[1:09:35] I'm going to see the king can you
[1:09:37] imagine when she told him I'm going back
[1:09:39] in there I'm going in there can you
[1:09:42] imagine when she was walking in there
[1:09:44] and she seen that sceptre laying there
[1:09:46] can you imagine if she's walking in
[1:09:48] there and all of a sudden in the back of
[1:09:50] her mind she's saying I told him if I
[1:09:52] perish then I'm gonna perish but I'm
[1:09:55] going to see the king can you imagine
[1:09:57] that she's standing there all of a
[1:09:59] sudden she sees that King a man reached
[1:10:01] for his scepter and the prophet of God
[1:10:05] said this morning Church he said it's
[1:10:07] time to run you say brother Andrew how
[1:10:09] can you say that because I said the same
[1:10:12] thing if I perish then you're gonna have
[1:10:14] to let me perish because I'm going amen
[1:10:17] to see the king you're not running
[1:10:27] without a message you got the king's
[1:10:30] scepter there was a little boy one time
[1:10:34] a little cockney I believe it was over
[1:10:36] in England the prophet of God said the
[1:10:38] King had a message to deliver
[1:10:41] but King had a message to deliver do you
[1:10:43] see what this message is it's the King's
[1:10:46] message it's the King's message but King
[1:10:49] had a message deliver and you know what
[1:10:51] he said he lifted a little boy just a
[1:10:56] little old little skinny little old
[1:10:59] fella that no doubt what even tall as he
[1:11:01] was but he said here take this message
[1:11:04] and don't tell them go tell them deliver
[1:11:07] this King's message it's a paradox
[1:11:10] because that boy said will they believe
[1:11:13] me will they believe me when I get back
[1:11:17] to school and say God deliver me a
[1:11:19] pornography will they believe me when I
[1:11:22] get back home and I tell my parents I
[1:11:25] got the Holy Ghost come on church will
[1:11:28] they believe me when I tell them Jesus
[1:11:29] Christ killed my body will they believe
[1:11:32] better suicidal oppression spirits my
[1:11:36] heart will they believe me brother Joe
[1:11:43] what they believed me when I told them
[1:11:45] that my past is been erased will they
[1:11:48] believe me when I tell them that my
[1:11:49] future is a lot brighter in my past will
[1:11:55] they believe me when I get back to
[1:11:58] school and they don't see me go to
[1:12:00] locker room and change into my pants
[1:12:04] well then boys believe me when they
[1:12:07] start telling their filthy jokes and I
[1:12:09] don't sit there and tell them with them
[1:12:10] will they believe me when I tell them I
[1:12:12] got changed I got born again I got
[1:12:17] changed I look different person will
[1:12:20] they believe me will the church believe
[1:12:27] me when I come home and don't sleep let
[1:12:31] me say that again will the church
[1:12:33] believe me when I get home and don't
[1:12:34] sleep through the service will my church
[1:12:38] believe me when I get home and I'm
[1:12:40] shouting and rejoicing and the fire of
[1:12:43] God is burning in my heart will they
[1:12:44] believe me will they believe me and the
[1:12:50] King lit the gula boy and the love
[1:12:52] always said will they believe me he
[1:12:53] reached over and got his scepter he
[1:12:59] reached over and got his scepter and
[1:13:01] said here
[1:13:02] [Applause]
[1:13:03] [Music]
[1:13:13] [Applause]
[1:13:24] [Applause]
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:32] [Applause]
[1:13:38] it was a paradox what I like about the
[1:13:45] next part is he said take my scepter
[1:13:48] deliver that message and don't start
[1:13:51] sorry
[1:13:53] don't stop for no one if they try to
[1:13:58] stop you if they try to stop you
[1:14:03] you don't stand there and argue with
[1:14:05] them whether brother Branham was a
[1:14:06] prophet or not if they try to stop you
[1:14:10] don't stand there argue with them read
[1:14:12] it all Holy Ghost is real or not try to
[1:14:14] stop don't stand there eyes with it you
[1:14:17] just
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:34] [Applause]
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:06] you're wasting your time
[1:15:09] [Applause]
[1:15:14] why are you gonna argue with somebody
[1:15:23] why are you gonna argue with somebody
[1:15:26] they're coming these meetings and said
[1:15:29] I'll stop I'll bind the people I'll
[1:15:32] scare
[1:15:33] I'll stand toe-to-toe with them there
[1:15:36] ain't no way I'm gonna leave and hold it
[1:15:38] go steel missiles
[1:15:44] holy vessels
[1:15:51] [Applause]

[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:35] it's a sin I'm just saying coming to
[1:16:38] mind right now that brother David Tyler
[1:16:40] says why are you gonna argue with the
[1:16:42] devil that crawled in the garden or
[1:16:44] walked in the garden and crawled out
[1:16:47] that's a good point friends why are you
[1:16:50] gonna argue with somebody that walked in
[1:16:52] but had to crawl out I'll tell you what
[1:16:55] the devil does he come walking in this
[1:16:57] meeting
[1:16:58] [Applause]
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:24] walked in but he called out another
[1:17:33] portion of this story stay with me don't
[1:17:37] stop for nobody keep running running my
[1:17:43] god I can't even talk this morning keep
[1:17:47] runnin don't stop to argue if they got
[1:17:51] any questions just so in the center but
[1:17:56] whatever you do whatever you do make
[1:17:59] sure the message gets delivered
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:09] make sure the message gets delivered my
[1:18:13] god it's burning I've got to make it
[1:18:15] real
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:18] I seen my little cousin Riley over there
[1:18:19] come here Riley he's there somewhere
[1:18:22] hurry run a king it's got a message to
[1:18:28] deliver I want to drive this home come
[1:18:29] here a king has got a message to deliver
[1:18:33] and he doesn't look for a 50 year old
[1:18:35] man because it's urgent he looks for a
[1:18:39] young boy anybody anybody that'll just
[1:18:43] be willing to take a scepter and he
[1:18:45] takes that sector what he lays it in his
[1:18:49] hand he says you're running
[1:18:51] this this runner is not in his hand
[1:19:15] [Applause]
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:44] Lord a little bully running through the
[1:19:54] land for the Kings message a little
[1:19:58] oddball that they already think you're
[1:20:01] crazy running to the University for the
[1:20:04] Kings message to see you wear the King's
[1:20:16] message and I asked you this morning in
[1:20:20] closing what can stop nothing could stop
[1:20:33] that little boy his faith wasn't in his
[1:20:37] flesh his faith wasn't in who his
[1:20:41] parents was his faith was in the king's
[1:20:45] scepter his faith was in the king's
[1:20:49] scepter Church my face is not in my
[1:20:51] flesh my face is not in my family my
[1:20:54] patients not just hitting my church my
[1:20:57] faith is not just gonna preacher my
[1:20:59] faith my face
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:11] we're the king when you leave this camp
[1:21:22] now I know brother Tim's coming in a
[1:21:25] minute to tell you pack up all your
[1:21:27] dirty clothes I'll let him tell you

[1:21:33] stuff together don't leave no socks the
[1:21:37] Lord heaven knows I can't wear man don't

[1:21:47] all wear the Tim forgive me if you leave
[1:21:52] your towels and you leave your clothes
[1:21:55] make sure you get the scepter the
[1:22:02] clothes the scepter is the only thing
[1:22:07] the scepter is the only thing where the
[1:22:11] Craig the scepter is the only thing but
[1:22:15] it so the scepter is the only thing you
[1:22:17] look at naughty the scepter is the only
[1:22:20] thing brother Blake the scepter is the
[1:22:22] only thing but Isaac receptor it's the
[1:22:25] only thing that's gonna get you to
[1:22:27] Laodicea the scepter Prince you're gonna
[1:22:30] have a lot of battles but you got the
[1:22:32] scepter you're gonna have some mountains
[1:22:34] to cross but you got the scepter sister
[1:22:37] you're gonna have some battles to face
[1:22:38] but you got the scepter young man you
[1:22:40] wanna have some spirits that you're
[1:22:42] gonna have to withstand but you got
[1:22:44] receptor you're gonna have to withstand
[1:22:46] fashion but you got a scepter how many
[1:22:49] got the scepter this morning god I got
[1:22:59] the scepter this morning we're a paradox
[1:23:04] for the 7 it's a paradox search make
[1:23:08] sure you leave this camp with a symptom
[1:23:13] with a scepter and can I give you one
[1:23:16] more word of advice Kenna may not be
[1:23:23] nice might not be politically correct it
[1:23:24] may not be pretty but when that old
[1:23:26] devil comes to you it starts talking in
[1:23:31] the back of your mind start saying now
[1:23:33] when you get home see now here's your
[1:23:35] battle ok because right here in this
[1:23:37] meeting God has convicted your heart of
[1:23:38] things right here in this meeting God
[1:23:40] has told you there's things in you in
[1:23:42] your bedrooms got to go there's things
[1:23:46] in your calls that's got to go but now
[1:23:48] here's the battle here's the battle is
[1:23:50] between here and getting home to get rid
[1:23:53] of it
[1:23:53] come on Church we ain't angel angels
[1:23:56] this morning we're humans battling human
[1:23:58] battles with a mighty conquer in us now
[1:24:00] the battle is when you get home when the
[1:24:03] fire ate there and brother Donnie ain't
[1:24:05] running across the pulpit and brother
[1:24:06] Andrew being real calm when brother
[1:24:10] might clean up their singing and brother
[1:24:12] Timothy ain't singing and the music
[1:24:14] ain't playing say planning and that holy
[1:24:16] anointing music driving out evil spirits
[1:24:18] and you get back home and now you got to
[1:24:20] do more than just shout about it now
[1:24:23] you've got to do more than just run
[1:24:24] about it but now you've got to manifest
[1:24:26] what God done for you you got to go home
[1:24:29] friends when you get there remember this
[1:24:31] but God that was with me when you cross
[1:24:33] the platform
[1:24:34] there's the God it'll be with yes when
[1:24:37] you go home
[1:24:38] with God that was with you in the prayer
[1:24:40] room is not this the God it'll be with
[1:24:43] you when you get home
[1:24:44] Oh church yes my God can put water in
[1:24:47] the ocean if my god can Carmel
[1:24:49] tyleroxley
[1:24:50] then my God can give you the faith to
[1:24:52] get home and take music out of CD
[1:24:54] players don't belong there
[1:24:56] take pants out of closets don't belong
[1:24:59] there throw makeup away come on Church
[1:25:01] clean up the videos pick up dirty
[1:25:04] magazines my God is a God who wants to
[1:25:07] bring this camp-meeting to pass action
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:18] musicians come this morning my god is it
[1:25:23] God it wants another paradox I could
[1:25:28] take time this morning and go through
[1:25:30] the paradoxes of the Bible could take
[1:25:32] time this morning go through the
[1:25:33] paradoxes of brother Barron's ministry
[1:25:36] congressman Upshaw paradox
[1:25:39] Rosella Griffin paradox paradox William
[1:25:49] Branham paradox paradox how can you say
[1:25:56] that bill endure it was a paradox that a
[1:25:59] man twice the size of brother Branham
[1:26:01] ran up on the platform and said you
[1:26:04] imposter I'll break every bone in your
[1:26:06] body so the devil said and a man that
[1:26:12] didn't weigh probably more than 200
[1:26:14] pounds what NIST all what is big stood
[1:26:17] right there and set in the name of Jesus
[1:26:20] Christ you won't touch one bone of meat
[1:26:22] but you'll fall over my feet this is not
[1:26:29] fiction this is not Walt Disney come on
[1:26:33] church this is not a fairy tale
[1:26:36] this is paradoxes
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:49] you'll fall across my feet fell across
[1:26:55] his feet it was incredible
[1:26:58] but it was true paradox but let's bring
[1:27:05] it to this day young man walks across
[1:27:12] the platform bound leaves free when
[1:27:16] there's more of sins more appealing in
[1:27:18] this day than it's ever been and he
[1:27:20] comes through that pare line and he
[1:27:21] leaves changed and he grows up and he
[1:27:25] holds a testimony that he never goes
[1:27:27] back to what God delivered in Crump
[1:27:30] this is real church this sacred angel
[1:27:34] it's impossible for God to deliver a
[1:27:36] person and then not go back to it it may
[1:27:44] be impossible with your God but with my
[1:27:46] God all things are possible
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:56] it's a paradox a lady in this day and
[1:28:00] time would go the doctor and they told
[1:28:03] her she had cancer and she would receive
[1:28:06] a word of the Lord and begin to shout
[1:28:08] around a church and God would heal her
[1:28:11] and go back and they couldn't even find
[1:28:12] a trace of it and that paradox is in
[1:28:15] this field in this morning don't touch
[1:28:18] my sister right there that's not Moses
[1:28:21] as they that's not Paul's day that's not
[1:28:24] just for the bantams day that's you're
[1:28:28] in this field in this morning
[1:28:31] there's the mighty host of paradoxes
[1:28:41] this brother Donnie said last night it's
[1:28:44] not just gonna be 50 year olds 60 year
[1:28:48] olds taking a rapture but the final
[1:28:53] paradox is gonna be some morning between
[1:28:58] about 6:00 and 9:00 and the devil wakes
[1:29:02] up looking for you and he can't find you
[1:29:09] he says no no I just knew I was going to
[1:29:13] claim them I just knew they were gonna
[1:29:15] be mine because greater is He that is in
[1:29:18] you
[1:29:20] and he is in this cosmos he wrote
[1:29:24] another paradox not in a in a book of
[1:29:27] ink and paper but in the heart of a son
[1:29:30] or daughter of God he said in the last
[1:29:32] days I will not write a new law or a new
[1:29:35] commandment upon stone but I will write
[1:29:37] it in the flesh of your hearts
[1:29:39] how many can say this morning Lord let
[1:29:42] me leave this youth camp as a written
[1:29:44] epistle as a written Bible and so
[1:29:46] written young man as a rich young girl
[1:29:49] let us all stand our feet another
[1:29:54] paradox you say Billy Andrew why did you
[1:29:58] say this this morning because I want you
[1:30:01] to leave here no it's not over
[1:30:05] just because you leave a Miss camp and
[1:30:07] just because you're going home it's not
[1:30:10] over but remember you're a paradox
[1:30:16] you're a young person and she got the
[1:30:25] second second
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:36] emember when I got the Holy Ghost here
[1:30:38] at this camp and got home brother Ben I
[1:30:41] thought everything was gonna be just
[1:30:43] easy man
[1:30:44] McKenney I thought I'd get home and I'd
[1:30:46] go to testifying about getting the Holy
[1:30:48] Ghost and everybody be like praise Lord
[1:30:51] you know man I got home got back to
[1:30:56] school got back in my regular routine
[1:30:59] walked in said I got the Holy Ghost
[1:31:01] though the person I thought for sure
[1:31:03] would encourage me went really got the
[1:31:06] Holy Ghost well let's see if he got it
[1:31:08] I said oh I said I won't show you about
[1:31:10] the Holy Ghost inside of me will you
[1:31:13] know what that was the devil they come
[1:31:15] over that person to try to tempt me it
[1:31:18] was come to find out it was a religious
[1:31:20] spirit I didn't know it at the time but
[1:31:22] they actually believed the Holy Ghost
[1:31:23] that person I told actually believed the
[1:31:24] Holy Ghost evidence of it was speaking
[1:31:26] in tongues and a religious spirit tried
[1:31:28] to shut my victory off as soon as I got
[1:31:30] back home but by God's grace here we
[1:31:34] stand this morning cause I got more than
[1:31:41] just played for I got the Kings second
[1:31:48] as we bowed our heads this morning I
[1:31:50] want you to say play something softly I
[1:31:53] know it made me end indifferent this
[1:31:56] morning but this is what was up on my
[1:31:59] heart today I want you to make sure
[1:32:02] before you leave this camp
[1:32:04] you've got the scepter make sure
[1:32:10] you see the prophet of God said that Eve
[1:32:13] lost the battle
[1:32:15] he said because she stopped to listen to
[1:32:20] the devil's reasoning she lost the
[1:32:26] battle because she stopped and listened
[1:32:32] to what Satan had for interpretation
[1:32:39] on God's Word but when you get home
[1:32:48] don't stop don't stop young girl don't
[1:32:57] stop don't stop and open up your heart
[1:33:00] to reasoning don't stop and listen to
[1:33:03] that old defeated devil
[1:33:07] don't stop take the scepter sewing the
[1:33:12] scepter and keep on walking how many can
[1:33:18] say Lord I want to
[1:33:20] leave this camp with us after god bless
[1:33:24] you
[1:33:25] hands up all over the building even the
[1:33:28] adults in the back god bless you young

[1:33:34] this race a whole lot longer and we have
[1:33:36] but they're standing here this morning
[1:33:38] as witnesses but if the king ever gives
[1:33:41] you the scepter nothing can stop you
[1:33:46] well if you ever get the scepter nothing
[1:33:49] can stop you
[1:33:52] Heavenly Father as we bow our heads and
[1:33:57] raise our hands and humble our spirits
[1:34:01] in our presence this morning dear God I
[1:34:06] pray in the name of Jesus Christ every

[1:46:29] want to report to you that not one

[1:46:57] amen god bless you amen
[1:47:03] would you two take your seats just for a
[1:47:05] moment we come to these closing moments
[1:47:11] of the camp today you know I I just want
[1:47:16] to give you a little bit of instructions
[1:47:19] before that you go one thing um how many
[1:47:25] how many received and experience with
[1:47:27] God in this camp this year a greater
[1:47:29] experience greater walk with the Lord
[1:47:31] amen god bless you for that
[1:47:34] amen hands up all over the building and
[1:47:38] I'm just going to tell you what you got
[1:47:39] to do you got to feed that experience
[1:47:41] with the Word of God a man and so just
[1:47:45] like the natural man gets hungry so this
[1:47:50] the inner man must be fed and built up
[1:47:53] in the Word of God
[1:47:54] and we gave you some the prayer and
[1:47:57] promise booklets there to contain
[1:48:00] scriptures and quotations there for you
[1:48:03] to read into to dwell upon so there
[1:48:08] there's one thing something here a
[1:48:11] couple of years ago we gave out complete
[1:48:14] sets of brother branham's sermons but
[1:48:17] those are also available online and I
[1:48:21] just want to say there's also a lot of
[1:48:23] other stuff available online and knowing
[1:48:27] that the I gate and the ear gate are
[1:48:30] gateways into the soul you want to be
[1:48:34] careful what you look at and what you
[1:48:37] hear amen because they are gateways to
[1:48:42] the soul and that's how demons enter in
[1:48:45] and I've met too many of them even in
[1:48:49] this meeting too many I'm too if I meet
[1:48:51] one it's too many phonography demons and
[1:48:55] the end and the the more entrenched they
[1:48:58] are in a person's life than the more
[1:49:00] depths of sin the more difficult they
[1:49:03] are to make leave because they have such
[1:49:05] a
[1:49:06] hold on in person amen but when we but
[1:49:09] but we know we can receive victory in
[1:49:11] the name of Jesus so you know if you
[1:49:13] don't want to open yourself up to
[1:49:15] spirits well then don't don't feast on
[1:49:17] them things that are open you up to
[1:49:19] every kind of devil arias and so you
[1:49:23] know many many years ago brother Tim
[1:49:25] told his fellow ministers I said you
[1:49:27] know this is maybe 20 30 years ago I
[1:49:31] said you know our solution for
[1:49:34] television is just don't have one and
[1:49:37] that way we're not feeding on it we're
[1:49:39] not looking at it it's not in our home
[1:49:41] is not taking our time I said but the
[1:49:44] time will come that we will have an hour
[1:49:47] that would be that would be mmmm it'll
[1:49:50] make television look like nothing I said
[1:49:53] because we'll have it right in our
[1:49:55] devices right in our pockets right in
[1:49:57] our hand
[1:49:58] we'll have to do banking with it
[1:50:00] communication every kind of other things
[1:50:03] and you won't be able to say just don't
[1:50:04] have it so you know what you got how the
[1:50:07] token you get to hold it goes to your
[1:50:13] life you will not desire this thing if
[1:50:16] this one that belongs to me has never
[1:50:18] been used for some evil purpose they
[1:50:22] meant because of why not because
[1:50:25] somebody was looking or I was afraid
[1:50:26] somebody was watching or you know bigger
[1:50:29] gods do and not do something in secret
[1:50:31] but because of a token that takes a
[1:50:34] desire sin out of our lives
[1:50:37] amen set no evil thing before your eyes
[1:50:44] so feature experience on the Word of God
[1:50:48] I think we baptized about 8:00 last
[1:50:50] night in the wonderful name of Jesus
