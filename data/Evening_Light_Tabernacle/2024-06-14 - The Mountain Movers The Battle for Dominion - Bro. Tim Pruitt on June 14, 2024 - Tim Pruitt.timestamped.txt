[46:12] blessings aren't we and we're thankful
[46:14] for him amen turn with me to Matthew
[46:18] 17:14 and one day had come to the
[46:22] multitude there came to him a certain
[46:24] man kneeling down to him and saying Lord
[46:29] have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic
[46:33] and sorely vexed for often time he
[46:35] falleth Into the Fire and often into the
[46:38] water and I brought him to thy disciples
[46:41] and they could not cure him then Jesus
[46:44] answered and said oh faithless and
[46:47] perverse generation how long shall I be
[46:50] with you how long shall I suffer you
[46:53] bring him hither to me and Jesus rebuked
[46:57] the devil and he departed out of him and
[47:00] the child was cured from that very hour
[47:04] then came the disciples to Jesus apart
[47:06] and said why could we not cast him out
[47:10] and Jesus said unto them because of your
[47:13] unbelief for verely I say un to you if
[47:15] you had Faith as the grain of mustard
[47:19] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[47:22] remove hint To Yonder place and he shall
[47:25] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[47:30] unto you amen so God bless you as you're
[47:34] seated I also want to read another
[47:37] scripture here to preface the one that
[47:39] we did from Matthew chap 10 verse 5 and
[47:44] I I want to read this one because it
[47:47] will give you the setting a little bit
[47:49] for this scripture that we have just
[47:51] read where the disciples here were in a
[47:55] battle and they were in battle with
[47:57] demonic powers and they they uh failed
[48:02] to cast out the devil that had been
[48:06] there that had opposed them and Jesus of
[48:09] course came and and he cast him out but
[48:12] let's look at Matthew chap 10 and verse
[48:15] 5 and I want to read from there that
[48:17] these 12 that Jesus sent forth and
[48:20] commanded them saying go not into the
[48:23] way of the Gentiles or into any city of
[48:26] the Samaritans enter you not but go ye
[48:29] go rather to the lost sheep of the House
[48:32] of Israel and as you go preach saying
[48:35] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand watch
[48:38] what he tells them now heal the sick
[48:41] cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast
[48:44] out devils and as freely as you re
[48:48] received freely
[48:50] give so you know as we read the
[48:53] scripture today I'm going to be taking a
[48:56] text on
[48:57] the mountain movers the battle for
[49:01] Dominion because the disciples here were
[49:04] in the battle for dominion over powers
[49:08] of darkness and yet Jesus had given them
[49:12] a word and given them the power and gave
[49:15] them the commandment and said go preach
[49:17] go demonstrate the gospel and declare
[49:21] that there's a kingdom coming now of
[49:24] course in order for one king om to come
[49:27] there has to be the overthrow of another
[49:30] and so there would be a Clashing of
[49:32] Kingdoms and the clashings of power so
[49:35] there would be battles that would go on
[49:38] in order to possess um and to set in the
[49:43] kingdom of heaven and of course the
[49:45] Kingdom of Heaven um understand is the
[49:48] Holy Ghost it's the believer's realm in
[49:51] the Holy Ghost and so he was saying the
[49:54] Holy Ghost is coming but even as a
[49:57] precursor to its coming as it is
[50:00] pressing down you we we're going to see
[50:03] Satan's kingdom interrupted and we're
[50:07] going to see it Disturbed and we're
[50:09] going to do it by Healing The Sick we're
[50:12] going to do it by cleansing the leopard
[50:14] by raising the dead by casting out
[50:17] Devils we're going to go into Satan's
[50:20] dominion and we're going to take control
[50:23] and and exercise power over his realm
[50:27] and so the disciples had been given
[50:30] Dominion by Jesus himself and had
[50:33] battled this demon and could not cast
[50:35] him out now in Mark chapter n the same
[50:37] story is told with more details and in
[50:39] verse 14 it said when the disciples he
[50:42] came to his disciples he saw a great
[50:45] multitude around them and the scribes
[50:48] questioning him now these scribes were
[50:51] the ones who were the the the writers of
[50:54] the law they knew the law they knew the
[50:56] the scriptures and now they were using
[50:59] scriptures to challenge what they were
[51:03] doing and and I want you to notice this
[51:06] and and the Bible says and straightway
[51:09] all the people when they beheld him they
[51:11] were greatly amazed and running to him
[51:13] saluted him and he asked the disciples
[51:16] or asked the scribes what question ye
[51:19] with them now apparently this multitude
[51:23] who Jesus would rebuke calling them a
[51:27] perverse a twisted bent generation were
[51:31] standing there and with
[51:34] unbelief and they were questioning the
[51:36] disciples Authority and even had qu
[51:40] caused the the disciples to begin to
[51:43] doubt now and when you doubt of course
[51:46] you know you're sighing in with the
[51:48] devil you're no longer agreeing with the
[51:51] word you are agreeing with the devil and
[51:54] so when the devil didn't immediately
[51:57] come out then I I can hear some in the
[52:00] crowd saying now now boys you're you're
[52:03] now facing a devil that's bigger than
[52:05] you you know you you don't have the
[52:07] power to cast him out and what was it
[52:10] now Satan had got into that crowd and
[52:13] unbelief overflowed and the disciples
[52:16] started
[52:17] doubting now you know God speaks of
[52:20] these this crowd and um and even of the
[52:23] Jews as a faithless and perverse
[52:26] generation I this these words actually
[52:29] come from the words of Moses that would
[52:32] be found in Deuteronomy 32 and8 and and
[52:35] first God speaks of them as a people I
[52:38] have chosen now this is what God had
[52:41] done with the disciples he had chosen 12
[52:44] he had commissioned them he had
[52:47] empowered them he had sent them out and
[52:50] he had given them a word of authority
[52:53] and now they're attempting to use this
[52:56] word of authority and in a battle they
[52:58] are
[53:00] defeated now Jesus is dealing with a
[53:05] situation because he's got disciples now
[53:08] who are who have been defeated and
[53:11] they're wondering what was the cause how
[53:13] did we lose how did how did we lose this
[53:16] battle and of course Jesus will tell him
[53:19] it's because of your unbelief but where
[53:21] did that unbelief come from it came from
[53:24] the questioning of the crowd
[53:28] it came by men taking the word taking
[53:32] the Law taking the word and using it
[53:35] against them and so therefore doubts
[53:39] began to ensue and when doubts came oh
[53:42] you see then then they were powerless
[53:45] against the
[53:46] devil now so if you look at Deuteronomy
[53:50] 32 and 8 you're going to see again God
[53:53] choosing a people like he chose the
[53:55] disciples and like he chose
[53:58] you because you're a chosen people the
[54:02] Bible said you're a chosen generation a
[54:05] royal priesthood that means a kingly
[54:08] priesthood and and so in Deuteronomy 32
[54:12] and8 he said when the most high divided
[54:14] the Nations their inheritance when he
[54:16] separated the sons of Adam he set the
[54:19] bounds of the people according to the
[54:20] number of the children of Israel for the
[54:22] Lord's portion is his people Jacob is
[54:26] the lot of his inheritance so he said I
[54:29] chose Jacob I chose
[54:31] Israel amen I chose the seat of Abraham
[54:35] and they are the lot of my inheritance
[54:38] everything that I have is
[54:41] theirs now I want you to see where God
[54:43] has placed you because every promise of
[54:47] the book is yours amen you are the lot
[54:50] of God's inheritance and he found him in
[54:53] a desert land in the waste Howen
[54:55] Wilderness he led him about he
[54:57] instructed him and he kept him as the
[54:59] apple of his eye I want you to know God
[55:02] says of you you are my pride and joy
[55:05] you're the apple of my eye and as an
[55:08] eagle stirs up her nest and fluts over
[55:11] her young and spread abroad her wings
[55:13] and taketh them and bear them on her
[55:15] wings so the Lord alone did lead him and
[55:18] there was no strange god with them so
[55:21] God just this did alone it wasn't by any
[55:24] other power it was by God's power so he
[55:27] provided them with everything he
[55:29] supplied all their need and verse 13
[55:32] says he made him ride on the high places
[55:35] of the earth he that he might eat the
[55:38] increase of the fields and he made him
[55:40] to suck honey out of the Rock and oil
[55:42] out of the flinty Rock and butter of
[55:45] kind and milk of sheep and the fat of
[55:47] lamb and the RMS of the breed of Bashan
[55:50] and goats with the fat of the kidneys of
[55:52] the wheat and and thou didst drink the
[55:55] the pure blood of the great but Jiran
[55:58] now this name for for Israel meaning the
[56:01] blessed one but the blessed one the
[56:04] blessed one wax fat and kicked Thou Art
[56:08] wax and fat Thou Art grown thick Thou
[56:10] Art covered with fatness and then he
[56:13] forsook God which made him and which had
[56:17] made him and lightly esteemed the rock
[56:19] of his salvation they provoked him to
[56:21] jealousy with strange Gods with
[56:23] Abominations provoked they him to Ang
[56:26] they sacrific to devils and not to God
[56:29] to Gods whom they knew not to New Gods
[56:32] that newly come up whom your fathers
[56:34] feared not of a of the rock that begat
[56:38] thee thou AR mind or or art unmindful
[56:41] and has forgotten God that formed thee
[56:44] and when the Lord saw it he abhor them
[56:47] because of the provoking of his sons and
[56:50] of his daughters and he said I will hide
[56:53] my face from them I will see what what
[56:56] there in shall be for there are very
[56:58] forward generation children in whom is
[57:02] no
[57:05] faith so I want you to notice here God
[57:08] said I have provided everything I you're
[57:11] the apple of my
[57:13] eye you are the lot of my
[57:16] inheritance I've given you blessing
[57:18] after the blessings you've sucked honey
[57:20] out of the rock you know I've given you
[57:23] abundance I've given you blessings but
[57:26] you're a forward generation of children
[57:29] who have no
[57:31] faith so this is the kind of people that
[57:34] Jesus was dealing with with this crowd
[57:37] of people who supposedly knew the
[57:41] word who supposedly had all the quotes
[57:45] all
[57:46] together and here they here in this
[57:49] moment they were throwing the quotes
[57:51] here at and using the word against the
[57:54] disciples and causing
[57:57] unbelief to where they had no
[58:01] Dominion now you know I tell you what if
[58:04] anyone should have believed it should
[58:06] have been that crowd of
[58:07] Jews I mean come on for what other
[58:10] people had the Red Sea
[58:12] opened for whatever what other people
[58:15] had had had the the power of God been
[58:18] shown and they and they were fed bread
[58:20] out of Heaven amen give power over
[58:23] serpents they were they were lad and got
[58:27] water from a rock I mean who else why
[58:30] who else should have
[58:32] believed you see but they would there
[58:35] but they had made their religion
[58:38] powerless with their
[58:40] Traditions you see they had word they
[58:43] had the law of God they had its promises
[58:46] and no power and no faith to make that
[58:48] word
[58:50] work their God was one who had plagued
[58:53] the Devils of Egypt who had read the Red
[58:56] Sea they drank water from the rock they
[58:58] were healed of serpent bites man that
[59:00] came down from heaven and yet they still
[59:02] didn't
[59:05] believe and neither did they have
[59:07] dominion they didn't have the power over
[59:10] this devil and neither now when their
[59:13] when their
[59:14] unbelief comes and hinders the disciples
[59:17] Faith neither do the
[59:20] disciples and this
[59:23] doubt this doubt stemmed from from a
[59:26] belief of a god of the past who wasn't
[59:30] able
[59:32] today and it caused Jesus to become
[59:35] exasperated as it as Jehovah was in in
[59:39] Moses day for they lightly esteemed the
[59:42] rock of Salvation they didn't regard
[59:45] that he was
[59:47] able you
[59:49] see here generation after generation had
[59:52] been turned to Faith by seeing the
[59:55] miraculous you know this was a people
[59:57] who had an Elijah with power oh who
[1:00:01] could call fire down from heaven and and
[1:00:04] Destroy 50 men at a time this was a man
[1:00:07] with power that fire came down from
[1:00:09] heaven consumed the sacrifice this was a
[1:00:12] man with great power with great
[1:00:14] Authority with God they had seen all of
[1:00:17] this they had been witness this was
[1:00:20] written in their Bible it was in their
[1:00:24] quotes you see but but you see you know
[1:00:27] here generation after generation had
[1:00:30] been turned to Faith by seeing the
[1:00:32] miraculous only Devol back into
[1:00:36] unbelief they they had a a long history
[1:00:39] of exasperating
[1:00:44] God Jesus seeing this unbelief exhibited
[1:00:48] instead of
[1:00:50] Faith he once again once again God got
[1:00:54] exasperated the doubt expressed by the
[1:00:57] crowd had taken root as as unbelief and
[1:00:59] the disciples and now they were wavering
[1:01:02] now they were doubting you know they
[1:01:05] were they were listening to the ridicule
[1:01:08] of the crowd of you know you you've cast
[1:01:11] out Little Devils but you can't cast out
[1:01:12] this one your power it just isn't great
[1:01:16] enough it it isn't enough see you don't
[1:01:19] have what it takes maybe one day when
[1:01:22] the Messiah comes when there comes a
[1:01:25] great made Messiah when a move of God
[1:01:28] comes it'll be but not now and there the
[1:01:31] Messiah was standing among them and they
[1:01:34] were exhibiting the power of that that
[1:01:36] Messiah but they were hindering it now
[1:01:39] with their unbelief yes you see in in
[1:01:43] their minds the word of the crowd became
[1:01:47] bigger than the words of
[1:01:50] Jesus now I want you to remember you
[1:01:52] must never let anything whether it's the
[1:01:55] doctor whether it's science whether whe
[1:01:58] whether it's people around you whether
[1:01:59] it's your own thoughts become bigger
[1:02:01] than the words of
[1:02:03] Jesus Amen his word must have
[1:02:06] preeminence in your life you see that to
[1:02:09] them the problem was too great The Devil
[1:02:12] was too big they were too powerless and
[1:02:15] the devil became greater in their minds
[1:02:18] than the words of Jesus and the power
[1:02:22] that he had given
[1:02:24] them cuz I just read you in the Bible
[1:02:27] where he gave them the
[1:02:29] power and sent them out to do this work
[1:02:34] and now they are out doing this work and
[1:02:37] and here they meet with failure you know
[1:02:41] I can almost hear some of the things
[1:02:43] saying You cast out devil through devil
[1:02:45] Powers through
[1:02:47] beyb you're you're one of those many who
[1:02:50] say Lord Lord have we not cast out
[1:02:52] devils in your name have we not done
[1:02:54] many marvelous Works listen let me tell
[1:02:58] you the bride must be able to say the
[1:03:01] same
[1:03:02] thing amen she must too must be able to
[1:03:06] say we are Mark 16 in action we have
[1:03:11] signs because they follow the word
[1:03:14] everything that of course it has that
[1:03:16] has signs are not the word but every
[1:03:18] time the true word is preach then signs
[1:03:21] follow amen so you know we we can hear
[1:03:24] the Roar of the C Crow and the scorn and
[1:03:27] the laughter and the scoffing as the
[1:03:29] crowd ridicules if you're anointed you
[1:03:32] must be
[1:03:35] false you see because only the aults are
[1:03:39] anointed because the Devil deceives by
[1:03:42] Miracles so we better not have Miracles
[1:03:45] because that's the way the devil
[1:03:46] deceives if you got miracles you must
[1:03:49] not be on the word your emphasis should
[1:03:51] should be on the word anyway and not
[1:03:54] Miracles so you hear the Roar of the
[1:03:56] crowd you know of of all of this and
[1:03:59] certainly I would say our emphasis for
[1:04:01] certain should not be on Miracles
[1:04:03] without word but neither should it be on
[1:04:06] word without
[1:04:07] Miracles the right emphasis is the word
[1:04:11] with Miracles if God be with you where
[1:04:15] are the Miracles Mark 16 and2 the Bible
[1:04:19] said and they went forth and preached
[1:04:21] everywhere the Lord working with them
[1:04:24] confirming the word with signs following
[1:04:28] that's what happened when the message
[1:04:29] and the commission was given by Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ they went forth and
[1:04:35] preached amen they demonstrated the word
[1:04:38] and the Lord was working with them and
[1:04:40] confirmed the word with signs following
[1:04:44] so Jesus now comes to his disciples find
[1:04:47] them in this dilemma that can't defeat
[1:04:49] the enemy and Jesus uses the same
[1:04:53] power that they are
[1:04:56] doubting that he has given to his
[1:04:59] disciples and he has that same power
[1:05:02] come on Amen and and he proved that the
[1:05:06] power he had given his disciples was
[1:05:10] enough amen that the devil could not
[1:05:13] resist the power when it was accompanied
[1:05:17] with
[1:05:22] faith there was nothing wrong with the
[1:05:24] word of power
[1:05:26] that Jesus gave they had lost their
[1:05:29] faith in the word and beginning to allow
[1:05:31] the devil a place in their
[1:05:35] minds I want you to get this you're
[1:05:39] don't allow the devil a place in your
[1:05:43] mind so while it's the Battleground
[1:05:45] brother Tim he's got a right to come
[1:05:47] there well you got a right to kick him
[1:05:50] out amen the Bible said cast down
[1:05:53] reasoning and every High thing that
[1:05:54] exalts itself against against the word
[1:05:56] of God you got a battle you got the
[1:05:58] right he's going to be an Invader just
[1:06:00] because you possess a land like Israel
[1:06:02] don't mean you don't get
[1:06:04] invaded on October the 7th it showed
[1:06:07] that they were vulnerable and open to
[1:06:09] attacks and the enemy
[1:06:12] attacked amen and they had to fight to
[1:06:15] possess and to hold their
[1:06:18] land and so are
[1:06:21] you God gave you a land but you're going
[1:06:24] to fight to possess it amen God Gave You
[1:06:27] promises in the book but you but it's a
[1:06:30] battle it is something where you cast
[1:06:33] out the inhabitants of the
[1:06:36] land now the only
[1:06:39] way of course you don't today you know
[1:06:43] the the devil many people are allowing
[1:06:46] him a place in their
[1:06:51] minds so well I can't help it yeah maybe
[1:06:54] you can help it
[1:06:56] you can't help that he comes and flies
[1:06:58] over but you don't have to let him
[1:07:01] Nest amen now you you've got a
[1:07:05] weapon you got a double barrel
[1:07:08] shotgun and an Acts 2 and
[1:07:11] 38 amen you've got the word of power in
[1:07:14] Old and New Testament you can fire away
[1:07:17] use the word against
[1:07:19] him amen you you know you've got to look
[1:07:22] at the promise of God and realize it is
[1:07:24] mine and it is worth
[1:07:27] possessing you see the and of course you
[1:07:30] know today that's the issue there
[1:07:33] nothing wrong with the word is that many
[1:07:36] have lost confidence in his
[1:07:41] power the only way to change this is
[1:07:43] through birthing a new generation who
[1:07:45] can
[1:07:46] believe but that but that's the problem
[1:07:49] every remove of God began with a renewed
[1:07:51] Faith only for one generation later to
[1:07:54] sink back into un belief again and this
[1:07:57] word perverse that Jesus uses refers to
[1:08:01] the disciples straying from the
[1:08:04] instructions that he had given them on
[1:08:07] account of their lack of faith in the
[1:08:09] truth and it wasn't that they didn't
[1:08:11] have the truth it wasn't that they
[1:08:14] didn't have the power it was when they
[1:08:16] had to fight against the questions of
[1:08:19] doubt that was posed by the crowd that
[1:08:22] their faith wavered causing them to
[1:08:26] disbelieve and this frustrated Jesus he
[1:08:30] called him a faithless and perverse
[1:08:32] generation and said how long will I put
[1:08:35] up with you how long will I put up with
[1:08:37] your unbelief I I won't be with you
[1:08:39] always you're going to have to learn to
[1:08:41] fight and repel unbelief and not yield
[1:08:45] to
[1:08:46] it you see in some cases even Jesus
[1:08:51] could not do himself he could not do
[1:08:53] great Miracles because of their unbelief
[1:08:57] not his unbelief but their
[1:09:00] unbelief but you
[1:09:02] see you see that's why he would have to
[1:09:05] put the Whalers out of gyrus his house
[1:09:08] you know who was weeping over gyrus his
[1:09:10] daughter who was dead their unbelief
[1:09:13] would hinder even the power of the
[1:09:17] Resurrection so you know brother Brandon
[1:09:20] preached a sermon called perfect
[1:09:23] faith and and the and the crowd will say
[1:09:26] now listen we have a whole crowd of
[1:09:29] Christian them today and that's what I'm
[1:09:31] talking about this perverse
[1:09:34] generation who takes the Word and
[1:09:37] questions it who takes the word and
[1:09:40] renders it
[1:09:42] powerless who who throws all the
[1:09:44] philosophy and thoughts of man and and
[1:09:47] Creeds and dogmas of man to try to
[1:09:50] hinder and to block you from believing
[1:09:55] now brother brandham preached a sermon
[1:09:57] called perfect faith and the crowd will
[1:10:00] say no one can have it but but a
[1:10:04] prophet but let me just tell you God
[1:10:06] wouldn't have sent a message if it was
[1:10:08] UN
[1:10:10] unattainable he don't just send a
[1:10:12] message to tickle our ears he sends a
[1:10:15] message for you to obtain to
[1:10:19] it amen so in perfect faith brother Ram
[1:10:23] said now at first the disciple didn't
[1:10:26] have this perfect Faith they didn't have
[1:10:28] it because they' had Christ walking with
[1:10:31] them but then afterwards Christ was in
[1:10:34] them now I want to ask you where are we
[1:10:36] is Christ is Christ with us or is he in
[1:10:40] us that's right amen now so he said it
[1:10:44] so it's hard to have this perfect faith
[1:10:47] without the Holy Spirit it has to bring
[1:10:50] it it does you say the disciples didn't
[1:10:52] have perfect Faith No they had that elep
[1:10:55] epileptic child there that they were
[1:10:57] trying to cast this devil out of him and
[1:10:59] they couldn't do it and the father seen
[1:11:01] Jesus coming and said we have brought my
[1:11:03] son to your disciples and they could not
[1:11:05] cure him see and afterwards the
[1:11:07] disciples asked Jesus saying why could
[1:11:10] not we cure him he said because of your
[1:11:12] un of your the lack of faith of your
[1:11:15] unbelief and he said now remember they
[1:11:18] had the power I want you to get it they
[1:11:21] had the
[1:11:23] power Jesus had given the power to heal
[1:11:26] the sick that's the word he had given it
[1:11:29] his word and the word had commissioned
[1:11:32] them he had give them power to raise the
[1:11:35] dead to cast out Devils just a few days
[1:11:37] before that they had the power but not
[1:11:40] the faith to use that power now that's
[1:11:43] the brandham Tabernacle there's the
[1:11:45] church the bride today the holy spirit
[1:11:48] is here with the power but you don't
[1:11:51] have the faith to move it see what I
[1:11:53] mean it takes faith to move
[1:12:00] it now we're going to get to that in a
[1:12:02] little bit because God has the
[1:12:06] power and it's there but you got to have
[1:12:08] faith to move that
[1:12:12] power now Jesus had given the word and
[1:12:15] this word had plenty of power his word
[1:12:19] has power his word spoke the world into
[1:12:23] existence when he walked here on the
[1:12:25] shores of Galilee he he stilled the
[1:12:28] waters with his word amen he broke bread
[1:12:31] and multiplied it by his word he took
[1:12:34] water and turned it into wine by his
[1:12:38] word come on he raised the dead by his
[1:12:41] word he did all kinds of things with the
[1:12:45] word he showed us the power that lays in
[1:12:48] the
[1:12:49] word now he had given his word and the
[1:12:52] word has plenty of power but Power can
[1:12:54] be hindered
[1:12:56] Ed by doubt and
[1:12:58] unbelief only faith and confidence and
[1:13:01] Trust in his word can release its
[1:13:05] power now when brother Brandon's talking
[1:13:08] about this he tell he reaches down in
[1:13:10] his pocket and he pulls a shell out I
[1:13:13] don't have one this morning but he has a
[1:13:15] bullet and he says I got a shell that I
[1:13:18] hand loaded I know by ballistics now he
[1:13:22] would put so much you got one
[1:13:29] no when nobody you know by ballistics
[1:13:32] like the word but he says I have to fire
[1:13:35] the
[1:13:36] gun and the fire has to get to the
[1:13:39] powder the powder has got the power but
[1:13:42] it's got to have the fire to light it
[1:13:44] off and the same thing the powder is in
[1:13:46] the Shell but it needs Faith to charge
[1:13:49] it and throw it out and that's what it
[1:13:52] it takes the perfect Faith to ignite the
[1:13:54] power of the ho H Spirit which we have
[1:13:56] now since he's come upon us Faith to
[1:13:58] ignite to see great things the faith
[1:14:01] something that presents it to you so
[1:14:05] brother brandham tells us this over
[1:14:07] again he uses many any illustration
[1:14:09] there's power in the
[1:14:12] word when he uses the illustration of
[1:14:15] the two cards and one both of them are
[1:14:17] filled with
[1:14:20] power one don't have spark he says that
[1:14:24] about this bullet it can't do anything
[1:14:26] it's got power in it but unless there's
[1:14:29] something to strike
[1:14:31] it now so Jesus commissioned us these
[1:14:35] signs shall follow them that
[1:14:37] believe and Jesus as the second Adam
[1:14:41] what he spoke
[1:14:46] happened Jesus showed us what life in
[1:14:48] the Holy Ghost is to
[1:14:50] be you hung up on
[1:14:53] me I don't know where you went but come
[1:14:55] back
[1:14:56] here Jesus showed
[1:14:59] us what life in the Holy Ghost is to
[1:15:04] be he was God's example son that every
[1:15:10] other son is made
[1:15:15] like amen so he showed us what life in
[1:15:18] the Holy Ghost is to be then the book of
[1:15:21] Acts of the Holy Spirit shows us men who
[1:15:24] were
[1:15:25] reborn to be just like Jesus they were
[1:15:29] Jesus men they were God
[1:15:33] men filled with the Holy Ghost the same
[1:15:37] Holy Spirit Jesus had that came on him
[1:15:41] at the River Jordan was the same holy
[1:15:43] spirit that was poured out on the b in
[1:15:45] the book of Acts not a different Spirit
[1:15:48] not a lesser Spirit The Same
[1:15:51] Spirit now Jesus
[1:15:56] as the second
[1:15:57] adom that that he he would commission us
[1:16:01] and he would show us what it was shows
[1:16:05] us shows us even in the book of Acts
[1:16:07] what men who are reborn are to be like
[1:16:11] and in Romans 8:29 Paul will say for
[1:16:14] them he
[1:16:17] forew he also
[1:16:19] predestined are you
[1:16:21] predestinated what are you predestinated
[1:16:24] to be on am me to be conformed to
[1:16:28] what so that's your
[1:16:31] destiny if you for knew you he set a
[1:16:34] Destiny for your life and that was to be
[1:16:37] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:16:40] he might be the first born among
[1:16:46] many so he you see he's the first of a
[1:16:49] new race he's the head of a new
[1:16:53] race he's the first born of many so
[1:16:57] every other son born like him's going to
[1:16:59] be like
[1:17:02] him amen so he would be the firstborn
[1:17:05] among many
[1:17:07] Brethren yes that means
[1:17:12] you now in Hebrews chapter 2 and verse
[1:17:15] 10 the Bible said it became him for whom
[1:17:18] are all things and by whom are all
[1:17:20] things and bring in many sons into Glory
[1:17:23] so I want you to see you know he who
[1:17:26] made all things and by him are all
[1:17:29] things that in bringeth many sons into
[1:17:32] glory to make the captain of their
[1:17:34] salvation perfect through sufferings for
[1:17:37] both he that Sanctified and they who are
[1:17:40] Sanctified are all of one for which
[1:17:42] cause he is not ashamed to call
[1:17:45] them
[1:17:48] Brethren saying I will declare my name
[1:17:52] unto his unto my brethren in the midst
[1:17:55] of the church will I sing praise to the
[1:17:57] quoting Old Testament scripture and
[1:17:58] again I will put my trust in him and
[1:18:00] again behold I am the children which God
[1:18:04] hath given
[1:18:05] me so he goes and shows us we are the
[1:18:09] children of God by the new
[1:18:13] birth and if we are that we are
[1:18:17] brothers we're just like Jesus we're of
[1:18:21] the same genus we're of the same species
[1:18:25] we have the same
[1:18:28] life
[1:18:29] amen now when Jesus came the Earth that
[1:18:35] he tread upon as the second item was uh
[1:18:38] much different from the one that the
[1:18:41] first Adam lived upon there was no curse
[1:18:43] in Eden it was not a cursed Earth there
[1:18:47] was no thoughts of doubt in Eden there
[1:18:51] was no conflict over whether or not I in
[1:18:55] position with
[1:18:56] Dominion Adam never battled a thought
[1:19:00] about moving a
[1:19:02] mountain
[1:19:05] or never never questioned whether he had
[1:19:09] faith enough to pluck up this tree and
[1:19:11] move it over there he just did it there
[1:19:15] was no battle against unbelief there was
[1:19:17] no doubts to contend
[1:19:20] with so he was in a in a perfect vacuum
[1:19:24] as a it was where that there was no evil
[1:19:28] no no sin no unbelief and he could
[1:19:31] operate in this perfect
[1:19:33] vacuum without any question without any
[1:19:37] doubt without any fear without any
[1:19:40] unbelief but the moment he moved out of
[1:19:44] Eden now then he is now the now he is
[1:19:50] subject to the very things that he once
[1:19:53] controlled now he will have to do things
[1:19:56] very differently he will have to move
[1:19:58] trees by the sweat of his
[1:20:00] brow now other things what was not
[1:20:03] impossible before becomes
[1:20:06] impossible because again he is in a
[1:20:09] fallen condition and the world Falls
[1:20:11] with him and I want you to think on it
[1:20:14] the Earth becomes cursed and brother
[1:20:16] bandam tells us in the messages um in
[1:20:20] several messages right right around the
[1:20:22] sermon the future home he he tells us
[1:20:25] and reim reemphasize it and proven his
[1:20:29] word and a couple other sermons right
[1:20:31] there how that Jesus came and he dwelt
[1:20:36] upon the Earth and he was Spirit born he
[1:20:40] was supernaturally born he was born of a
[1:20:43] virgin but wrapped around the blood cell
[1:20:48] was cursed
[1:20:52] Earth he he is B body was formed out of
[1:20:57] dust and it was
[1:21:00] corruptible and there would be even
[1:21:02] corruptible thoughts that would come to
[1:21:04] him he would have to battle against his
[1:21:07] own
[1:21:10] Humanity amen now so here here again I
[1:21:14] want you to see something here but Jesus
[1:21:17] would take his cursed Earth Down To The
[1:21:22] River Jordan
[1:21:25] amen make it and Obey him are you with
[1:21:29] me bring it down to the river Jordan and
[1:21:32] there God would would come and so so
[1:21:37] saturate curs Earth with a baptism of
[1:21:40] the Holy Ghost until now that cursed
[1:21:44] Earth was obeying God instead of the
[1:21:48] devil and he did the same thing to you
[1:21:51] in your new birth he came down and your
[1:21:54] cursed Earth and your hands which used
[1:21:57] to serve the devil now glorifies God
[1:22:02] your mouth that used to speak lies and
[1:22:04] curse and use evil word now speaks truth
[1:22:08] and Holiness and
[1:22:10] righteousness Hallelujah Why by the
[1:22:13] power of the Holy Ghost within you
[1:22:16] making curse Earth obey
[1:22:22] God by the way if heed redeemed you on
[1:22:25] the inside one day he's going to get the
[1:22:26] outside too and he'll redeem this Earth
[1:22:30] and change every molecule of it flesh
[1:22:34] and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
[1:22:36] God he'll change you in a moment when CL
[1:22:40] of an
[1:22:42] eye when Jesus
[1:22:45] came he operated upon an earth that had
[1:22:49] been cursed where Satan was King Jesus
[1:22:53] acknowledged him as the Prince of this
[1:22:57] world the prince of the
[1:23:00] earth and where Satan Reigns unbelief
[1:23:04] Reigns and takes Dominion through the
[1:23:07] fiery darts that that wound
[1:23:11] Faith now before men sinned the Earth
[1:23:15] was in an Eden condition as the king of
[1:23:18] the earth and Adam spoke he dressed the
[1:23:21] garden nature obeyed his commands God
[1:23:26] had given him Dominion I want you to say
[1:23:29] the word
[1:23:30] dominion God had given him dominion over
[1:23:33] the Earth and when man sinned the F the
[1:23:36] the Earth fell with him and Adam lost
[1:23:40] his dominion and Satan become the prince
[1:23:43] of the power over
[1:23:45] atmospheres and man sold himself to S to
[1:23:48] sin and became subservient to the devil
[1:23:51] to sin to disease and to sickness
[1:23:55] but you see that's not the end of the
[1:23:58] story amen Jesus came and wrapped
[1:24:02] himself in cursed Earth and and they're
[1:24:05] paid the penalty of sin that was poured
[1:24:09] out upon his flesh upon the cursed Earth
[1:24:14] so that out of his life would come
[1:24:18] resurrection power to give back to the
[1:24:21] Believers where you could be filled with
[1:24:25] the same spirit that was in
[1:24:29] Jesus now Jesus Paid It
[1:24:33] all but he didn't stop there he gave you
[1:24:36] dominion over sin on over unbelief and
[1:24:41] over the devil saying in my name you
[1:24:45] will cast out
[1:24:47] Devils you will speak Heaven's
[1:24:50] language so well that's it says speak
[1:24:53] one speak with new tongues that's
[1:24:55] Heaven's language you will speak the
[1:24:57] language of Heaven you will take up
[1:25:00] serpents and cast them out you know I
[1:25:04] give you authority over every deadly
[1:25:06] thing the purchasing power is there the
[1:25:09] money is in the bank Jesus Paid It
[1:25:13] all but the way to reach it is out or to
[1:25:18] obtain
[1:25:19] it is out of the reach of too many they
[1:25:23] don't know how to write it to
[1:25:26] check now I want you to understand this
[1:25:29] is dilemma brother bradam found out as
[1:25:32] he he would tell this over and again I
[1:25:35] find two classes of
[1:25:37] people but he believed that God has sent
[1:25:40] a message that was to bring those two
[1:25:42] people
[1:25:44] together check riters who knew what they
[1:25:49] had now so he tells us and I'll just
[1:25:52] read this one again four uh Jesus um
[1:25:56] Jesus speaking the father seeking such
[1:25:58] that will worship Him in spirit and
[1:25:59] Truth his word is the truth the spirit
[1:26:01] and the truth many have the spirit no
[1:26:03] truth other has the truth no spirit and
[1:26:06] he said it's like a man that's got money
[1:26:08] in the bank don't know how to write the
[1:26:10] check the other know one knows how to
[1:26:12] write a check and got no money in the
[1:26:14] bank if you could ever get those two
[1:26:16] together spirit and Truth now that's
[1:26:20] what the message is to bring us back to
[1:26:22] is true worship
[1:26:24] where the two comes
[1:26:26] together looking under Jesus brother
[1:26:28] Bram talks about this again and he says
[1:26:31] I found two classes of people one the
[1:26:34] fundamental positionally he knows where
[1:26:36] he is in Christ because of the word but
[1:26:38] he doesn't have any faith in what he's
[1:26:39] doing he hasn't received the Holy Spirit
[1:26:42] then I find the Pentecostals many of
[1:26:43] them has received the Holy Ghost but
[1:26:45] don't know who they are just like a man
[1:26:48] who's got money in the bank can't write
[1:26:50] a check and the other can write a check
[1:26:52] got no money in the bank if you could
[1:26:54] get get those two together if you get
[1:26:56] the Pentecostal to realize who he is and
[1:26:59] come back to the real full word of God
[1:27:02] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[1:27:04] would set the world of fire again with a
[1:27:07] new Pentecostal Revival in other words
[1:27:09] right a book of
[1:27:14] Acts so now as a whole the message
[1:27:18] people have the full word
[1:27:22] restored but they like the Dynamics to
[1:27:26] make it
[1:27:31] work and they're listening to the crowd
[1:27:35] that tells you it's not your season
[1:27:40] yet it's not the hour for
[1:27:44] it we we we don't have it yet it's
[1:27:47] coming but we don't have it this was
[1:27:50] exactly the same thing the crowd was
[1:27:52] telling them one day the I come and
[1:27:56] we'll have that kind of power but he
[1:27:57] ain't here yet and there he
[1:28:00] was but they were doubting it they were
[1:28:04] rejecting it now as a whole as I said
[1:28:08] the message people have have the full
[1:28:10] word restor but lack the Dynamics to
[1:28:13] make it work we have resource in the
[1:28:15] bank Jesus made the deposit and he sent
[1:28:19] a message of restoration but too many
[1:28:21] don't know how to write a check
[1:28:24] some have the word without Spirit other
[1:28:26] have Spirit no word one is word word
[1:28:28] word no spirit and they study the
[1:28:30] scripture and so well we're sons of God
[1:28:32] and and they believe that but they don't
[1:28:34] have any faith with the other has a lot
[1:28:36] of faith and they don't know they're
[1:28:37] sons of God one's like a man that has
[1:28:39] money in the bank but can't write a
[1:28:41] check others one can write a check got
[1:28:43] no money in the bank if we could ever
[1:28:45] get those the thing together till men
[1:28:48] and women will realize you that's been
[1:28:51] truly baptized in the holy spirit that
[1:28:53] and you have the token to display you
[1:28:57] have a right to every Redemptive
[1:29:00] blessing that God promised everything
[1:29:03] that he promises yours hold your token
[1:29:06] over your unwavering Faith as you pray
[1:29:08] and over his word faith in his
[1:29:11] word Now by and large we have failed to
[1:29:14] get it together you see we have allowed
[1:29:17] Satan to either make this all mechanics
[1:29:20] and no
[1:29:22] Dynamics or and become a bunch of
[1:29:24] powerless people whose only weapon is
[1:29:27] argument that won't stand up against
[1:29:30] Satan and he can out argue anytime he
[1:29:32] can beat you on an argument let me tell
[1:29:34] you the devil he is
[1:29:38] wise and he can beat you in an argument
[1:29:40] with half of his brains tied behind his
[1:29:46] back you'll never get anywhere debating
[1:29:49] with the devil don't even try use the
[1:29:53] word against
[1:29:56] him amen you you are no match for the
[1:29:59] devil and neither I want to say this
[1:30:02] neither is your sword which is the word
[1:30:04] of God a match until you get it out of
[1:30:07] the Scabbard and use it in the hand of
[1:30:10] Faith against him and I want to ask you
[1:30:13] how long are we going to be on the
[1:30:16] defensive and when are we going to take
[1:30:19] the offensive
[1:30:26] let me give you a scripture Jesus said
[1:30:30] the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[1:30:32] against us those who have received the
[1:30:35] revelation of who Jesus
[1:30:37] is the divine revelation from
[1:30:40] God he said the Gates of Hell will not
[1:30:43] Prevail against
[1:30:45] that now what does that
[1:30:48] mean does that mean we're on the
[1:30:50] defensive and we're within the wall
[1:30:52] protected and Satan is just battering
[1:30:55] against our gates that ain't what it
[1:30:57] said it said it says that it means if
[1:31:03] the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[1:31:04] against us it gives us a different
[1:31:06] picture than that it means we have Satan
[1:31:11] surrounded and he's under
[1:31:14] siege and the Gates of Hell come on
[1:31:18] cannot stand against us and that we are
[1:31:22] here on the offensive to overthrow
[1:31:25] Satan's kingdom for we are kings taking
[1:31:30] dominion over Satan over his kingdom and
[1:31:33] over his
[1:31:35] power it does not mean we're on the
[1:31:38] defensive it means we're on the
[1:31:41] offensive we're taking back what he has
[1:31:44] walled off from us a promise he has held
[1:31:50] back and it's time for the children of
[1:31:53] God to take offensive against the devil
[1:31:56] Amen to take your sword and March
[1:31:58] against it and say it's thus sayith the
[1:32:02] [Applause]
[1:32:05] Lord
[1:32:07] now
[1:32:09] either it becomes either all Dynamics
[1:32:12] and no mechanics all mechanics and no
[1:32:16] Dynamics but let me just share a quote
[1:32:18] with you from the great warrior David
[1:32:21] first thing you was elected and called
[1:32:25] and then when God elected you then he
[1:32:27] called you you heed it his called and he
[1:32:29] poured the anointing oil on you the Holy
[1:32:31] Ghost and when the cruise of oil what's
[1:32:33] the oil represent in the Bible the Holy
[1:32:36] Spirit and when he poured the oil upon
[1:32:37] him he baptized him with the Holy Ghost
[1:32:40] Holy Spirit and a symbol I hope you get
[1:32:43] get that and that just come fresh he
[1:32:45] poured oil upon him and it just went all
[1:32:47] over him a whole horn full of it amen
[1:32:49] not sparingly and that's the way God
[1:32:52] pours out the holy ghost on a man not
[1:32:54] sparingly just baptizes him with it amen
[1:32:58] anointing him with the spirit notice
[1:33:00] right then when that anointing struck
[1:33:02] him he was positionally placed as
[1:33:07] king amen you are positionally in Christ
[1:33:11] Jesus as priest and Kings amen the
[1:33:15] moment you receive the Holy Spirit God
[1:33:19] places you in the kingdom and air what a
[1:33:22] beautiful picture there you
[1:33:25] are amen so I want you to understand
[1:33:28] when the anointing come on David he was
[1:33:30] already King position by God ain't no
[1:33:34] Goliath going to kill
[1:33:35] him ain't nothing standing between him
[1:33:38] and that Throne going to stop him he is
[1:33:41] Anointed for a reason for a purpose and
[1:33:45] that is to sit on that Throne to take
[1:33:50] Dominion now he'll fight Civil Wars till
[1:33:52] it happened but he'll get
[1:33:55] it because he has to have a battle for
[1:33:59] Dominion now in the message the ark
[1:34:03] brother Brandon says we miserable
[1:34:05] wretched from all the lowest of all
[1:34:07] insects lowest of All Creatures morally
[1:34:11] polluted spiritually dead can be lifted
[1:34:13] from that
[1:34:15] place by the Ark of the blood of the
[1:34:17] Lord Jesus to be sons and daughters and
[1:34:20] Kings and Priests unto God
[1:34:25] that's what the new birth does it takes
[1:34:27] you as he said miserable wretched the
[1:34:30] lowest of all
[1:34:32] insects lowest of All Creatures morally
[1:34:35] polluted spiritually dead and
[1:34:38] lifted out of there Amen to be sons and
[1:34:43] daughters and Kings and Priests unto our
[1:34:47] God that's what Redemption does it
[1:34:50] elevates you come on yes
[1:34:55] praise the Lord think think about it
[1:34:57] just think it in Union with Christ it
[1:35:00] elevates us you know the new birth is
[1:35:03] the same as as a marriage where you are
[1:35:06] united with Christ so in the and the and
[1:35:09] that's other type it's a marriage you so
[1:35:11] you're the new birth of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:13] coming God uniting with you is a
[1:35:16] marriage so what did it do it took a RAB
[1:35:20] who was a harlot and elevated her by
[1:35:25] marriage to be the mother of the
[1:35:29] Messiah it took Ruth a despised woman a
[1:35:33] moabitas and by marriage to Boaz
[1:35:36] elevated her to become the mother of
[1:35:39] kings and even the
[1:35:41] Messiah your marriage to Christ elevates
[1:35:45] you into position of
[1:35:51] royalty Hallelujah
[1:35:56] royalty that's why he said you're a
[1:35:58] royal
[1:36:00] priesthood you're a holy nation you're a
[1:36:04] chosen
[1:36:07] Offspring generation
[1:36:11] Offspring so you
[1:36:14] see brother bradam said in his prayer
[1:36:18] and where I think Pentecost failed he
[1:36:20] said make these ladies here Lord an
[1:36:22] example of Womanhood in their
[1:36:24] neighborhood where they live where they
[1:36:26] dwell make these men anointed light so
[1:36:29] granted father right in this Bunch
[1:36:32] stands young men oh God lay your hands
[1:36:34] upon them for the ministry give them a
[1:36:35] call and may they live such lives until
[1:36:38] you separate them from out from among
[1:36:40] the people and set them and adopt them
[1:36:42] into thy family father and anoint them
[1:36:45] as Kings and Priests to rule in your
[1:36:48] kingdom give them Ministries and things
[1:36:51] to bring to do to bring others to Christ
[1:36:53] but notice what he said anoint
[1:36:56] them to be Kings and Priests to
[1:37:02] rule
[1:37:05] Dominion in the message Messiah he
[1:37:08] brings it
[1:37:10] again God called us and we become Kings
[1:37:13] and Priests unto God Like Jesus was
[1:37:16] God's high priest we become a lesser
[1:37:19] priest Jesus was God in fullness dwelt
[1:37:21] in him to to Shine for the expression of
[1:37:25] God to the world for God was in Christ
[1:37:27] reconciling the world to him and as God
[1:37:30] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:37:31] him God comes in his church and anoints
[1:37:34] him some
[1:37:35] Messiahs do you see it the same thing
[1:37:38] he's did in his church the same power he
[1:37:40] had is in his church and his church
[1:37:43] becomes his dominion and he's King over
[1:37:45] this dominion and we are Kings and
[1:37:47] Priests offering spiritual sacrifice to
[1:37:49] God and the fruits of our lips given
[1:37:52] praise to his name there are Messiahs
[1:37:55] little Messiah little anointed ones
[1:37:57] anointed what off of what the main one
[1:38:00] anointed off the great
[1:38:03] one so let's get some Bible for this
[1:38:08] turn with me to Revelation chapter 1
[1:38:11] verse4 and we'll read these words from
[1:38:15] the Holy Scripture
[1:38:27] and the Bible said and from Jesus Christ
[1:38:29] who is the faithful witness and the
[1:38:32] first begotten of the dead and the
[1:38:34] prince the chief ruler the commander the
[1:38:38] leader of the kings of the
[1:38:42] earth think of
[1:38:45] this so he here again he's the first
[1:38:48] begotten of the dead and the
[1:38:51] prince can you say he's your commander
[1:38:54] and
[1:38:55] chief he's your leader he's the chief
[1:38:58] ruler of what
[1:39:02] peons no
[1:39:07] Kings you see unto him that loved us and
[1:39:10] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[1:39:13] so who are these kings that he's
[1:39:17] commanded o Commander
[1:39:21] over the next verse says and he have
[1:39:23] made
[1:39:25] us Kings and Priests and unto God and
[1:39:31] his father to be to him be glory and
[1:39:35] Dominion forever and ever amen so now
[1:39:38] according to the Bible he is Prince of
[1:39:40] kings and he made you one of
[1:39:44] them why else is he called King of Kings
[1:39:53] and Lord of
[1:39:57] lords Lord is a
[1:40:00] ruler people with Dominion people with a
[1:40:04] kingdom people Bor into the kingdom of
[1:40:07] God that's the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:40:10] realm we have been born into is the
[1:40:12] realm of the Holy Ghost in the kingdom
[1:40:14] of God the kingdom of the Holy Ghost and
[1:40:17] there you are a king
[1:40:23] Lord of lords king of
[1:40:31] kings and notice what he
[1:40:34] said and he hath made
[1:40:39] us that's something we want to emphasize
[1:40:42] right there because he hath made
[1:40:47] us salvation is his doing I didn't make
[1:40:50] myself a king I didn't say here am and
[1:40:53] this is my authority and I'm taking this
[1:40:55] position God placed me
[1:40:58] here God placed me as a ruler God Place
[1:41:01] me as a king with a domain come on a
[1:41:05] King Without a domain is no King at all
[1:41:09] he gave you a Dominion so we we we are
[1:41:13] Kings We Are Spiritual Kings oh yeah
[1:41:15] we're going to be Kings upon the Earth
[1:41:17] with him when he sits on the throne and
[1:41:19] in the Millennium but right now
[1:41:23] we are Kings and we Reign Over a
[1:41:26] spiritual Kingdom that's and this is
[1:41:29] what he said you Reign Over a spiritual
[1:41:32] Kingdom you speak Heaven's
[1:41:35] language you have Heaven's Authority and
[1:41:39] when you in this realm of spirits when
[1:41:42] you tell a devil to go he's beneath you
[1:41:44] he has to mind what you say so in my
[1:41:48] name you will cast out Devils you will
[1:41:51] heal the sick cuz that's casting out
[1:41:54] Devils you will speak Heaven's language
[1:41:57] and if you if you drink any deadly thing
[1:41:59] it won't hurt
[1:42:05] you he gave you a
[1:42:08] Dominion now why
[1:42:11] else like I said would he be called king
[1:42:14] of kings and Lord of lords because he is
[1:42:16] King he has Kings under him and as
[1:42:20] Supreme Lord he has Lords or rulers
[1:42:23] beneath
[1:42:25] him a and so a a king can't be a king if
[1:42:30] he has no Dominion he can't make you
[1:42:33] King and all right you're a king but you
[1:42:35] don't have a Dominion no you have a
[1:42:37] throne a king has a throne a king has a
[1:42:40] domain so right now we reign with Christ
[1:42:44] and I'm quoting this from Brother bradam
[1:42:46] the church Age We reign with Christ
[1:42:47] having dominion over sin the World the
[1:42:50] Flesh and the devil
[1:42:53] so don't tell me you don't have dominion
[1:42:55] over your
[1:42:56] flesh don't tell me you know porn and
[1:42:59] all that lust and everything else has to
[1:43:01] rule over you you rule
[1:43:04] it amen you see we have dominion over
[1:43:08] sin the World the Flesh and the
[1:43:12] devil amen so you see we are priests and
[1:43:16] Kings un God and no wonder he said the
[1:43:18] world does not appeal to us we are
[1:43:21] peculiar people zealous and the good
[1:43:23] works we have been recreated in him to
[1:43:26] be children like our father so let's
[1:43:29] just read some B more Bible Colossians
[1:43:31] chapter
[1:43:32] 1:3 the Bible says who hath delivered us
[1:43:36] from the power of
[1:43:38] Darkness how many believes you have been

[1:45:28] sovereignty amen but with our new birth
[1:45:32] we are now back into sovereignty again
[1:45:36] amen we reign as kings in life through
[1:45:40] that one man Jesus
[1:45:44] Christ so Paul is saying through that
[1:45:46] transgression of Adam one individual

[1:45:52] and therefore the Earth
[1:45:53] but through death sovereignty and Rule
[1:45:57] uh it was taken and power was taken from
[1:45:59] men but those who receive of God's

[1:46:31] becomes your
[1:46:32] righteousness amen that is the gift of
[1:46:36] righteousness it means that everyone of
[1:46:39] us that have been born again become into
[1:46:41] a kingly and a queenly state and we're
[1:46:45] accepted by God to reign as kings and
[1:46:48] queens in the realm of
[1:46:50] life in the realm of death death you

[1:47:03] kingship with a Dominion amen and you

[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:12] righteousness this is why brother
[1:47:14] brandom said if the blood of bulls and
[1:47:16] goats could put a man in position to
[1:47:18] speak into existence what about the
[1:47:20] blood of Jesus that's more powerful and
[1:47:23] that can take away every
[1:47:26] sin see under an inferior blood of bulls
[1:47:30] and goats Abraham spoke and a ram
[1:47:34] appeared how' they get there Abraham
[1:47:37] spoke
[1:47:39] it a ram tied in the thicket by its
[1:47:42] horns God provided a
[1:47:45] sacrifice it's why he's called Jehovah
[1:47:48] Gyra the Lord
[1:47:50] provides Moses spoke flies were created
[1:47:54] and frogs and lice and boils rang down
[1:47:56] upon Satan Kingdom Joshua spoke and the
[1:47:58] Sun and the Moon Stood Still but we're
[1:48:02] but we are now under the
[1:48:05] blood of God and not just under it but I
[1:48:08] want to say you're born of
[1:48:12] it Hallelujah it ain't just something
[1:48:16] between you in God you are now born of
[1:48:19] that
[1:48:20] blood Hallelujah you you are the blood
[1:48:25] by the spirit when the spirit of God
[1:48:27] enters into you the blood of God came
[1:48:30] into you you were born of his genus you
[1:48:32] were born of his blood you were born of
[1:48:35] his
[1:48:39] life and yet we question the Greater
[1:48:43] Works we doubt it being
[1:48:46] ours we unbelief unbelief the crowd says
[1:48:52] it's only for great men only prophets
[1:48:55] such as brother brandham can do the
[1:48:57] Greater Works only brother brandham
[1:49:00] could have perfect
[1:49:01] faith and we we look at ourselves as
[1:49:06] unworthy I'm not worthy for
[1:49:09] that as if the blood was
[1:49:14] inefficient we can't believe it takes
[1:49:17] away every St of sin and gives us God's
[1:49:21] righteousness but you you have been born
[1:49:23] again by receiving the Holy Ghost are
[1:49:26] Kings and Priests with dominion and you
[1:49:28] have the righteousness of Jesus Christ
[1:49:32] and you're standing before God Amen
[1:49:35] without a trace of
[1:49:39] sin let me read it to you from the Bible
[1:49:42] 2 Corinthians 5:21 he hath made him to
[1:49:46] be sin for us do you believe that amen
[1:49:50] do you believe that on the cross Jesus
[1:49:52] Jesus became your
[1:49:54] sin amen he took your sins he paid for
[1:49:59] your sins he went to hell for with your
[1:50:04] sins he took them all the way down to
[1:50:07] Hell and throw them on the devil
[1:50:09] Hallelujah say no don't belong on my
[1:50:11] sons and
[1:50:12] daughters Hallelujah I'm taking their
[1:50:15] sins what's now I'm paying the price
[1:50:19] that we might become the
[1:50:23] righteousness of God in him he became
[1:50:27] your sin that you might become his
[1:50:32] righteousness Hallelujah you are the
[1:50:34] very righteousness of God
[1:50:40] himself no wonder you have access Before
[1:50:43] the Throne you're a
[1:50:45] king
[1:50:47] priest with
[1:50:49] Dominion in Union with Christ you been
[1:50:52] made the righteousness of
[1:50:55] God
[1:50:57] uh I I know I know when when preaching
[1:51:00] this there comes up a wave of
[1:51:03] unbelief from all the crowd screaming at
[1:51:08] you and for some it came from years
[1:51:11] where you you've sat under false
[1:51:12] teaching religion has taught you that to
[1:51:16] be humble you have to say you're a
[1:51:20] sinner that you're no good that you
[1:51:22] don't amount to
[1:51:24] anything we're all Sinners we just can't
[1:51:26] make it we Have No Dominion over it you
[1:51:29] God just forgives us but we have to live
[1:51:31] in this decrepit condition and we sing
[1:51:34] songs like I'm just a sinner saved by
[1:51:38] grace we're not
[1:51:41] Sinners we were
[1:51:43] Sinners but not
[1:51:46] now not now come on no Holy Ghost
[1:51:52] no Holy Ghost filled believer willfully
[1:51:55] sins we are Sons filled with God's
[1:52:00] righteousness if you're born again you
[1:52:03] are God's son or
[1:52:06] daughter Hallelujah you're as righteous
[1:52:09] as he is
[1:52:11] righteous amen you the requirement that
[1:52:14] Jesus said be as perfect as your father
[1:52:16] in Heaven is perfect is accomplished by
[1:52:20] God passing on to you his rightous
[1:52:24] nness therefore you stand before God as
[1:52:28] perfect as he
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:34] is
[1:52:36] amen we might just have a runaway for
[1:52:38] it's over
[1:52:40] with don't go before God denying your
[1:52:43] sunship and placing yourself in the
[1:52:45] realm of death and telling God you're
[1:52:47] just so dirty and
[1:52:49] unclean that's an insult to God telling
[1:52:53] him that the sacrifice of his blood was
[1:52:55] not enough to cleanse you and put you in
[1:52:57] right standing before him that his life
[1:52:59] has not delivered you that's a slap in
[1:53:01] his
[1:53:03] face amen you know here is our position
[1:53:06] through Christ you know
[1:53:08] God God has or we have become God's
[1:53:12] righteousness and his blood was
[1:53:17] sufficient
[1:53:19] therefore therefore comes to pass the
[1:53:21] scripture
[1:53:23] in Isaiah
[1:53:24] 54:17 no
[1:53:28] weapon no
[1:53:30] devil no demon power no
[1:53:34] epileptic whatever the name of it no
[1:53:37] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[1:53:40] prosper and every tongue every tongue
[1:53:44] every lying tongue everything the devil
[1:53:46] says against you that rises against you
[1:53:48] in judgment you will condemn it
[1:53:51] Hallelujah this is the heritage of the
[1:53:55] Servants of the Lord and their
[1:53:57] righteousnesses of me sayeth the
[1:54:00] [Applause]
[1:54:10] Lord you claim weakness you sing
[1:54:12] unbelief you talk weakness you pray
[1:54:14] weakness and you go out and live
[1:54:18] it I'll never get well I'll never
[1:54:21] overcome this
[1:54:23] this is a family trade had handed down
[1:54:26] from generations and nobody has ever
[1:54:28] been able to break it well listen I'm
[1:54:31] not expecting you to break it like
[1:54:33] that amen and that birth you're subject
[1:54:36] to it you're going to fall to it you're
[1:54:38] going to be aired to it you it's in your
[1:54:40] jeans and you're going to get it but
[1:54:44] I'll tell you there is only not just
[1:54:47] that birth there is a new birth and when
[1:54:51] we are born again
[1:54:53] it cancels out all the C all the
[1:54:56] generational curses no matter what your
[1:54:59] daddy did and how evil he was or your
[1:55:01] granddaddy or that one and this
[1:55:04] generational curse
[1:55:06] stops it stops with the
[1:55:10] [Applause]
[1:55:17] blood well my parents wasen righteous my
[1:55:20] my grandparents and they were evil and
[1:55:22] they did this and they had all kinds of
[1:55:24] illegitimate things and things going on
[1:55:27] bad things it
[1:55:29] stops the blood stops IT the blood
[1:55:33] cleanses it the blood washes the blood
[1:55:36] does away with it it bursts you new and
[1:55:39] you're no longer that creature you're a
[1:55:40] new creation a brand new species
[1:55:44] somebody that the devil don't know what
[1:55:46] to do with
[1:55:50] you Hallelujah
[1:55:56] when Jesus come he saw a brand new
[1:56:00] species that had never been seen before
[1:56:03] amen he tripped Moses up he he would he
[1:56:06] would trip Elijah up he would come up on
[1:56:09] there and bring bring bring all kinds of
[1:56:12] of things on him he'd run for his life
[1:56:14] and and he come with all kinds of
[1:56:16] horrible depression that would come upon
[1:56:18] him and all of that but Jesus was a
[1:56:21] different species
[1:56:23] amen Moses failed Elijah would fail all
[1:56:26] the prophets would fail the law would
[1:56:27] fail all of them come on but
[1:56:34] Jesus no matter how he tempted him he
[1:56:37] wouldn't
[1:56:38] fall that's
[1:56:41] right and through death he took
[1:56:45] Dominion he gathered death into his
[1:56:49] body and took it and took the
[1:56:53] Dominion went down to the king's
[1:56:55] kingdoms of hell and says I've taken the
[1:57:01] keys and guess what he rose
[1:57:04] up on the third day and he gave you the
[1:57:15] keys some will glory in weakness to
[1:57:18] justify themselves well brother Tim you
[1:57:20] know I believe when I would do good evil
[1:57:22] is always present with me so I just
[1:57:24] can't help doing what I do I just can't
[1:57:26] help from sinning well Paul did say that
[1:57:30] about himself being a sinner under the
[1:57:32] law but he didn't leave you
[1:57:35] there he defined exactly how you were
[1:57:38] under the law how you were under sin and
[1:57:41] death and how you couldn't live it but
[1:57:44] he didn't stop there amen for he says in
[1:57:47] Romans
[1:57:48] 7:24 he sums it up and he said oh
[1:57:51] Wretched Man that I
[1:57:53] am because that's what a man is he's
[1:57:56] wretched in his first birth he can't
[1:57:58] live right he can't do right he can't
[1:58:01] make it oh Wretched Man that I am who
[1:58:05] shall deliver me from this body of this
[1:58:09] death I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:58:14] Our
[1:58:16] Lord who will do
[1:58:19] it I think God Jesus does it it yes
[1:58:24] therefore there is therefore now no
[1:58:29] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:58:32] Jesus that's the next verse by the way
[1:58:35] uh Romans 8:1 who walk not after the
[1:58:38] flesh but after the spirit for the law
[1:58:40] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:58:43] have made me free from the law the
[1:58:46] Dominion of sin and death for what the
[1:58:48] law could not do and that it was weak to
[1:58:50] the flesh God sending his own son in the
[1:58:53] likeness of sinful flesh and part sin
[1:58:56] condemn sin in the flesh that the
[1:58:59] righteousness required by the law might
[1:59:02] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[1:59:04] the flesh but after the
[1:59:07] spirit Hallelujah the righteousness he
[1:59:10] required under the law that they
[1:59:12] couldn't
[1:59:13] keep Hallelujah you can keep
[1:59:18] it why because the
[1:59:20] righteousness of Jesus Christ has been
[1:59:23] imputed to
[1:59:28] you let me just say the blood of Jesus
[1:59:32] is not
[1:59:34] weak our God is not a puny punching bag
[1:59:38] he's all powerful within
[1:59:43] us Psalm 78 and verse 40 how often did
[1:59:48] they provoke him in the wilderness and
[1:59:49] grieve him in the desert yay they they
[1:59:52] turned back and tempted God and limited
[1:59:55] the Holy One of
[1:59:56] Israel they remembered not his hand nor
[2:00:00] the day when he delivered them from the
[2:00:01] enemy how he wrought his signs in Egypt
[2:00:04] and his wonders in the field of Zorn
[2:00:07] look here what they did they limited the
[2:00:10] Holy One of
[2:00:13] Israel by and remembered not what he had
[2:00:17] done they forgot his
[2:00:19] power and so they Li lied him and this
[2:00:22] is what this crowd was doing they were
[2:00:26] they were limiting you can't do this you
[2:00:30] don't have the power to do this it ain't
[2:00:32] the hour for it it's not the time we you
[2:00:35] know you know we're we're all kinds of
[2:00:40] excuses days of Miracles are
[2:00:42] passed this is not the age of the
[2:00:46] Apostles the crowd screaming out and
[2:00:49] they limit the Holy One of Israel the
[2:00:52] limit God and when you limit God you
[2:00:54] limit
[2:00:55] yourself amen you limit his grace you
[2:00:58] limit his word until our God becomes a
[2:01:00] little bitty
[2:01:04] God we magnify failure and deify it
[2:01:09] until for some the devil is bigger than
[2:01:12] God right now there's people in this
[2:01:14] church right now the devil is bigger
[2:01:16] than God you make him
[2:01:19] bigger in your minds than God

[2:02:34] ruler sickness comes along we just say

[2:03:05] supernatural what yeah sickness is
[2:03:09] Supernatural it's a
[2:03:13] demon amen it's beyond the realm of

[2:06:41] feet and he steps back up to the pulpit
[2:06:44] he' been preaching on faith and he steps
[2:06:46] back and he said now Faith is the
[2:06:49] substance of things hoped for the
[2:06:50] evidence of Things Not
[2:06:52] Seen faith is an unseen
[2:06:56] reality and and you just seen in other
[2:06:59] words Faith work in an unseen
[2:07:02] realm amen bring nature even subject a m
[2:07:05] a mad man subject amen you've seen that
[2:07:08] and he said as he began to speak and
[2:07:10] just say th those words he said uh you
[2:07:14] know all throughout the building he said
[2:07:17] men and women rose up out of cck throwed
[2:07:20] away their crutches come out of
[2:07:21] wheelchairs and he said in just a few
[2:07:24] minutes every person in the building was
[2:07:28] healed let me quote his word he said
[2:07:31] when the chief of that tribe of demons
[2:07:34] fell everything beneath him fell with
[2:07:39] it hallelujah hallelujah I'm talking to
[2:07:43] a people who are Kingdom ARS I'm talking
[2:07:46] to people who are Sons and Daughters of
[2:07:48] the king I'm talking to people that will
[2:07:51] resist the devil in this
[2:07:54] generation Hallelujah until the chief of
[2:07:57] the tribes of demons of this world fall
[2:08:01] to the name of Jesus Christ and we are
[2:08:03] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[2:08:06] eye and the dead in Christ of 2,000
[2:08:09] years will
[2:08:14] rise
[2:08:16] Hallelujah we have been given
[2:08:19] Dominion we have given been given a
[2:08:23] commission but we will Embrace sin as
[2:08:25] something
[2:08:27] normal you don't think of dominion is
[2:08:29] like the devil's bigger than God and
[2:08:31] that was still under his
[2:08:33] Reign and yet his word
[2:08:36] says by his gift you are
[2:08:41] righteous his word said you are healed
[2:08:45] by his
[2:08:46] stripes you dare to declare your
[2:08:50] possession as a king and say I'm done
[2:08:52] with sin I will re over with I am done
[2:08:56] with sickness you dare to stand as a
[2:08:59] Believer and say I have the commission
[2:09:01] as a Believer amen from Jesus Christ the
[2:09:04] King of Kings cast Satan out to take up
[2:09:07] this serpent it'll not harm me but
[2:09:09] instead I will cast it out we reign as
[2:09:14] kings in the realm of
[2:09:17] life God is not simply a life insurance
[2:09:20] company that pays premium at
[2:09:24] death that all our rewards we get when
[2:09:26] we
[2:09:27] die we Reign now as kings in this realm
[2:09:32] of life too often we don't realize that
[2:09:35] through our new birth we are in Union
[2:09:38] with God we don't realize the new birth
[2:09:40] is a real
[2:09:43] Incarnation that as his bride we his
[2:09:46] body through which he does his work
[2:09:48] through which he takes Dominion
[2:09:52] you see they they don't know that they
[2:09:55] are sons and the daughters of God as
[2:09:59] Jesus is the great body of the Christian
[2:10:02] church today literally has no Dominion
[2:10:06] the crowd that I'm talking about they
[2:10:08] have the the most befog concept of what
[2:10:12] God has done and what God is to them and
[2:10:15] what they are to
[2:10:19] God I just ask you this this morning
[2:10:22] which of us don't need tree killing
[2:10:27] faith I don't need to kill a sic ofine
[2:10:30] tree and pluck it up and put in the sea
[2:10:33] but what about those cancers with roots
[2:10:35] grow through your
[2:10:37] body what about those roots of arthritis
[2:10:40] Wrecking havocs in your
[2:10:41] joints what about the disease in your
[2:10:45] liver the words of Jesus dried trees up
[2:10:49] from their roots
[2:10:54] well you see brother Tim here's a
[2:10:56] problem we don't have today we just
[2:10:59] don't have enough Faith well what was
[2:11:03] Malachi 40
[2:11:05] do turn our hearts back to
[2:11:08] believing well we don't have enough
[2:11:10] Faith so the
[2:11:12] disciples in Luke
[2:11:15] 175 they the apostles said to the Lord
[2:11:19] increase our faith
[2:11:22] and the Lord said you don't need very
[2:11:34] much if you had
[2:11:38] Faith as a grain of mustard seed the
[2:11:42] tiniest
[2:11:44] seed if you had just the tiniest seed of
[2:11:48] Faith you could say to this sick of mine
[2:11:50] tree be PL up by the root and be
[2:11:52] planted in the sea and it should obey
[2:11:54] you it don't take much that's
[2:12:01] right Jesus said faith is a grain of
[2:12:03] mustard seed would move Mighty tree
[2:12:05] pluck them up cast them in the sea you
[2:12:07] have faith I want to say you have
[2:12:11] faith it was born in
[2:12:16] you come on you were born of faith
[2:12:21] you wasn't born of unbelief that's how
[2:12:23] you got here through the first time you
[2:12:25] were born of unbelief through Eve sin
[2:12:28] but now through the new birth you're
[2:12:29] born of Faith somebody help me preach
[2:12:32] you have faith it was born in you that's
[2:12:35] what the message came to do turn your
[2:12:37] your faith back to turn you your heart
[2:12:39] back to believing again so quit making
[2:12:43] excuses for not having
[2:12:49] faith now brother bradam said time
[2:12:51] tested
[2:12:52] Faith he challenged the church there he
[2:12:55] said if the church would put more faith
[2:12:57] to work you'd see more things taking
[2:12:59] place in the
[2:13:01] church the pastor might stand on Sunday
[2:13:04] morning Sunday evening whatever preaches
[2:13:06] hard on faith and a mighty message but
[2:13:07] if the members don't take that message
[2:13:09] and start putting it to work it'll fall
[2:13:11] right back the birds of the air will
[2:13:12] pick it up just take it out put it to
[2:13:15] work God wants you to do it and Faith
[2:13:19] always an experience accompanies fath
[2:13:22] faith and he says then he gives the
[2:13:25] illustration he said you ladies you got
[2:13:27] you got a canary bird or parakeet or
[2:13:29] whatever it is little pets and you what
[2:13:32] goodes it do giving them
[2:13:34] vitamins you know Make Them Bones strong
[2:13:37] strong bones and fine Wings if you keep
[2:13:40] him in a
[2:13:41] cage he said there's no need of giving
[2:13:43] him that if he's going to stay in the
[2:13:44] cage and he said what does good does it
[2:13:47] do to preach a Bible of a God that heals
[2:13:51] the god that has power and tell the
[2:13:53] people days of Miracles are passed in
[2:13:55] other words keep them
[2:13:58] caged this is what the crowd was doing
[2:14:01] caging the
[2:14:04] disciples keeping their faith from
[2:14:07] working unbelief now becoming greater
[2:14:11] than what the promise of God was and he
[2:14:13] said it's like a man freezing to death
[2:14:16] you show him a painted
[2:14:18] fire and he said you nice big picture of
[2:14:21] with with a fire that someone painted
[2:14:23] man can't get warmed by it he's freezing
[2:14:25] he's got to have warmth and a man that's
[2:14:27] thirsting for God can't satisfy be
[2:14:30] satisfied till something happens there
[2:14:31] an experience and that kind of
[2:14:33] experience will G bring forth great

[2:14:37] cannot trust God who you never

[2:17:24] too amen we have been authorized by the
[2:17:28] Lord Jesus to exercise his authority
[2:17:32] upon the earth when Jesus went away he
[2:17:34] said all power in Heaven and Earth is
[2:17:36] given to me in heaven and earth and he
[2:17:38] said now you go with this Authority that
[2:17:41] I'm given you and you teach All Nations
[2:17:44] baptizing them name of the father Son
[2:17:46] and Holy Ghost teaching them to observe

[2:18:06] new birth we have the same Authority
[2:18:08] that he had when he lived on the
[2:18:11] earth
[2:18:13] now the Bible said in John 20 and verse
[2:18:16] 21 Jesus said unto them to them again
[2:18:20] peace
[2:18:21] be unto you as the father has sent me so
[2:18:24] send I you and when he had said this he
[2:18:27] pred on them and said unto them receive
[2:18:30] you the Holy Ghost now watch look at
[2:18:33] this he says as the father sent me so
[2:18:39] send I
[2:18:40] you amen and then he said so receive ye
[2:18:46] the Holy
[2:18:48] Ghost so what was he say it when you
[2:18:51] receive the Holy Ghost then just as the
[2:18:54] father send him he sends you how did the
[2:18:59] father send him by coming in
[2:19:02] him come on God was incarnate in Christ
[2:19:05] somebody help me preach amen and when
[2:19:08] God fills you with the Holy Ghost it is
[2:19:11] God living in you God dwelling in you
[2:19:14] God possessing
[2:19:17] you amen and you're born of the Breath
[2:19:20] of God just like Adam was at the
[2:19:22] beginning Hallelujah but this time into
[2:19:25] eternal life not just mortal Life as a
[2:19:29] father sent me so send I you Ephesians
[2:19:32] chapter 2 and verse 5 I'm going to I'm
[2:19:35] going to quit sometime today I will but
[2:19:39] in Ephesians 2 and verse 5 even when we
[2:19:43] were dead in
[2:19:45] sins he had quickened us that means made
[2:19:49] us alive together
[2:19:52] God when you were dead in sin he made
[2:19:56] you alive with Christ by Grace you are
[2:20:02] saved and he didn't just leave you there
[2:20:05] just bring you to life he raised us up
[2:20:10] together and made us sit together in
[2:20:14] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that
[2:20:18] means he positioned us with Dominion
[2:20:21] with Kingdom power with
[2:20:25] him amen now watch now what he said
[2:20:28] Ephesians 1:22 and he had put all things
[2:20:32] under his feet can we say amen and he
[2:20:35] gave him to be had over all things to
[2:20:37] the church amen which is his body the
[2:20:42] church which is body the fullness of him
[2:20:45] that filth all and all Hallelujah the
[2:20:48] church is his fullness and is his his
[2:20:50] body and he put it under his feet and if
[2:20:53] he put it under his feet he put it under
[2:20:55] the church's feet he gave you
[2:20:59] Dominion
[2:21:02] hallelujah amen sin is under your feet
[2:21:05] sickness is under your feet demons are
[2:21:07] under your feet amen they're all beneath
[2:21:10] you you are rulers you are Kings you are
[2:21:13] his
[2:21:14] [Applause]
[2:21:18] righteousness Hallelujah
[2:21:20] and the Bible said let you know one once
[2:21:25] again it isn't the question of your
[2:21:26] great faith but of his great power
[2:21:30] that's why brother randam said when you
[2:21:32] get this prayer cloth don't think about
[2:21:34] how your faith is and how little it is
[2:21:36] and how weak it is and what your faith
[2:21:38] is like think about how big your God
[2:21:40] is amen how able he is you get focused
[2:21:44] on the wrong thing you're looking at
[2:21:46] your faith and said is it enough it's
[2:21:48] just some Mustard Seed that's all it
[2:21:50] takes to move a
[2:21:52] mountain that's all it takes to move a
[2:21:57] tree that's great faith Mustard Seed
[2:22:01] Faith
[2:22:02] now so first John says verse four
[2:22:06] chapter 4 verse 17 herein is our love
[2:22:09] made perfect that we may have boldness
[2:22:10] in the day of judgment and watch and I'm
[2:22:13] going to key on this because as he
[2:22:17] is so are we in this
[2:22:22] world that is a power pack scripture
[2:22:25] right
[2:22:26] there
[2:22:28] Hallelujah here in is our love made
[2:22:31] perfect that he may have we may have
[2:22:33] boldness in the day of judgment because
[2:22:35] as he is so are we in this world as he
[2:22:41] is so are we as he is so are we as he is
[2:22:47] so am I
[2:22:50] [Applause]
[2:22:56] did Jesus tell you put faith in your
[2:22:57] ability put faith in your human power
[2:23:00] put Faith in what you can do Mark 11:22
[2:23:04] Jesus said to them have faith
[2:23:06] in well why is it hard to have faith in
[2:23:12] God come on that should be
[2:23:15] easy he opened Red Seas he brought
[2:23:19] curses down on the Demons of Egypt come
[2:23:22] on somebody amen he brought water out of
[2:23:24] the rock he showed us with multitude
[2:23:27] after multitude Open the Eyes of the
[2:23:29] blind raising the Dead come on casting
[2:23:32] out Devils doing
