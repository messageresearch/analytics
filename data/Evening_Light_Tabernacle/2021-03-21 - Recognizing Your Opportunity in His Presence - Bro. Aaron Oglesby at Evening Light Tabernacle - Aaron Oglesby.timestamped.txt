[40:41] places we'd like to read from
[40:45] brother e.j good to see you in the house
[40:47] of god this morning after your surgery
[40:49] i'm glad the lord brought you through
[40:50] that god bless you
[40:52] wonderful to see you here this morning
[40:55] we're going to read here from matthew 13
[40:58] 53. i'd like to speak to you today on
[41:01] recognizing your opportunity and his
[41:03] presence
[41:04] recognizing your opportunity in his
[41:07] presence
[41:08] matthew 13 53 says and it came to pass
[41:11] that when jesus had finished these
[41:12] parables he departed thence
[41:15] and when he was coming to his own
[41:16] country he taught them in their
[41:18] synagogue in so much that they
[41:20] were astonished and he said wence
[41:23] and and they were astonished and said
[41:25] whence had this man this wisdom
[41:27] and these mighty works is not this the
[41:30] carpenter's son
[41:31] is not this is not his mother called
[41:34] mary
[41:35] and his brethren james and joseph and
[41:37] simon and judas
[41:39] and his sisters are they not all with us
[41:41] whence
[41:42] then hath this man all these things
[41:46] and they were offended in him but jesus
[41:49] said unto them
[41:50] a prophet is not without honor save in
[41:53] his own country
[41:54] and in his own house and he did not
[41:57] many mighty works there because of their
[42:00] unbelief
[42:02] you may have your seats this morning as
[42:04] you're taking your seat
[42:06] if you'll turn also to mark 10 we're
[42:08] going to read a couple more
[42:10] scriptures before we get started mark 10
[42:13] and the 46th
[42:14] verse
[42:21] it says when they came to jericho and as
[42:23] he went out of jericho with his
[42:25] disciples and a great
[42:26] number of people blind bartimaeus the
[42:28] son of timaeus set by the highway side
[42:31] begging
[42:32] and when he heard that it was jesus of
[42:34] nazareth he began to cry out and say
[42:36] jesus
[42:37] thou son of david have mercy on me and
[42:40] many charged him that she he should hold
[42:42] his peace but he cried
[42:44] the more a great deal thou son of david
[42:48] have mercy on me
[42:49] and jesus stood still and commanded him
[42:52] to be called
[42:53] and they called the blind man saying
[42:55] unto him be of good comfort
[42:57] rise he calleth thee and he casting away
[43:01] his garment rose and came to jesus
[43:03] and jesus answered and said unto him
[43:05] what wilt thou
[43:06] that i should do unto thee the blind man
[43:09] said unto him
[43:10] lord that i might receive my sight
[43:14] and jesus said unto him go thy way thy
[43:16] faith have made thee whole
[43:17] and immediately he received his sight
[43:20] and followed jesus
[43:22] in the way and finally we're going to
[43:24] look over in luke the 23rd
[43:26] chapter and the 39th verse luke 23
[43:30] and 39. it's a very familiar story to us
[43:34] there at the crucifixion and it says and
[43:37] one
[43:37] of the male factors which were hanged
[43:40] railed on him saying if thou be christ
[43:43] save thyself and us but the other
[43:47] answering rebuked him saying dost not
[43:49] thou
[43:49] fear god seeing thou art in the same
[43:52] condemnation
[43:53] and we indeed justly for we receive the
[43:56] due reward of our deeds but this man
[43:58] hath done nothing amiss and he said unto
[44:01] jesus
[44:02] lord remember me when thou cometh into
[44:05] thy kingdom
[44:06] and jesus said unto him verily i say
[44:09] unto thee
[44:10] today shalt thou be with me in paradise
[44:14] as you read the bible you find many
[44:16] times many characters
[44:18] it's it's a contradiction of different
[44:20] ones you have those that recognize
[44:22] their need of god and they recognize god
[44:24] and they receive what they have need of
[44:26] and then there's many characters in the
[44:28] bible that do not recognize their need
[44:30] of god they do not recognize when he
[44:32] moves
[44:32] and therefore they are passed by and
[44:34] they do not recognize they don't receive
[44:36] what it is that they need and these
[44:38] three scriptures that we just read three
[44:40] seemingly unrelated scriptures from
[44:42] three different books of the bible
[44:44] but the way these tied together for the
[44:46] sake of our message today is that in all
[44:48] three
[44:49] we see opportunities we see people with
[44:52] opportunities in god's presence there in
[44:55] matthew we see them
[44:56] absolutely astounded not only at his
[45:00] teaching but also at the mighty works i
[45:02] mean they're astounded by it
[45:03] they love what he's saying they love the
[45:05] works that they're
[45:06] that that they're witnessing and yet in
[45:08] one verse
[45:10] they go from astounded to doubt
[45:13] in one verse they go to doubt because
[45:15] they begin to focus
[45:16] on why this couldn't be god they begin
[45:19] to focus on well if this was god it
[45:21] would be this way and if it was god it
[45:23] would be this way in the way
[45:24] i was taught in the way i believe it
[45:26] will come surely this
[45:28] can't be from god and they begin to
[45:30] focus on that
[45:31] and their astonishment instantly turns
[45:34] into doubt
[45:35] listen if you want to overlook god in a
[45:37] service
[45:38] if you want to find fault with the
[45:40] ministry or find fault with your
[45:41] brothers and sisters it's very easy to
[45:43] do
[45:44] just turn your attention away from what
[45:46] you're witnessing and what you're
[45:47] hearing and all the things god's doing
[45:48] and you'll see the negative
[45:50] the negatives there if you want to find
[45:52] it and that's what they began to do they
[45:54] began to turn away and try to see
[45:56] why this can't be from god
[45:59] and because they couldn't recognize who
[46:01] he was
[46:02] and he couldn't recognize who he was
[46:05] they were unable to believe
[46:07] even though they heard the works even
[46:09] though they they saw the works and heard
[46:11] the teachings they couldn't believe it
[46:12] they couldn't receive it and because of
[46:14] that he couldn't do many mighty things
[46:16] in their midst
[46:17] church may that never be the testimony
[46:19] of evening like tabernacle that he
[46:20] couldn't do many works in our midst
[46:22] but when we see him moving may we
[46:24] recognize it may we grab hold to it may
[46:26] we say lord i have need of thee today i
[46:28] have need of you
[46:29] in this moment right now
[46:32] in mark we find a desperate blind man we
[46:35] know him as blind bartimaeus
[46:37] and he recognizes his opportunity it
[46:41] always astounds me that
[46:42] to say it a blind man recognized his
[46:45] opportunity
[46:46] he didn't see the miracles he wasn't in
[46:49] the services
[46:50] he didn't know the testimonies but he'd
[46:52] been taught right he'd been raised right
[46:54] by a mama that told him
[46:55] that there was a coming savior and he
[46:57] didn't see anything
[46:58] but he had faith and he had heard the
[47:00] word and he believed and
[47:02] in that moment because of his faith he
[47:04] was made whole
[47:05] because he recognized something that he
[47:07] couldn't even see
[47:09] church we're without excuse how many
[47:11] miracles have we seen in this place
[47:13] how many time has god come and done the
[47:15] supernatural in front of us and yet a
[47:16] blonde man recognized his opportunity
[47:19] a blind man who saw nothing said thou
[47:21] son of david
[47:22] have mercy on me and yet we've seen and
[47:25] we've heard
[47:26] we can't let him pass through this
[47:27] building without crying out to him this
[47:29] morning
[47:33] and finally in luke we come to a
[47:34] well-known story of the thieves hanging
[47:36] on the cross next to jesus
[47:39] both at the end of their road both
[47:41] wretched miserable people
[47:44] and both with the exact same opportunity
[47:48] notice both are in the presence of jesus
[47:50] and both are given the opportunity
[47:52] to be a part of the last conversation
[47:55] jesus will ever have as a man before he
[47:59] dies
[48:00] what an opportunity the last
[48:01] conversation that our lord jesus christ
[48:04] is ever going to have
[48:05] and one recognizes what an opportunity
[48:07] this is
[48:08] what a moment this is and he recognizes
[48:10] his need
[48:12] and he recognizes and here's the key the
[48:14] one that can provide for
[48:15] my need is here right now in this moment
[48:19] next to me listen your opportunity may
[48:21] not arrive in the most ideal of
[48:23] circumstances
[48:25] your ideal man your opportunity may not
[48:27] arrive sitting just in a church pew it
[48:29] may not be on the best day of the week
[48:31] it may not be when everything's going
[48:33] right it may be when your life is turned
[48:35] upside down
[48:36] it may be things were going wrong every
[48:37] which way and your family torn apart
[48:39] but when he comes you got to recognize
[48:42] this is my moment
[48:43] this is my opportunity this is my savior
[48:46] he can provide what i have need of
[48:51] maybe both of them were raised in good
[48:53] homes
[48:54] maybe both of them grew up new in the
[48:56] prophecies maybe they both had known
[48:58] isaiah 9
[49:00] 6.
[49:02] and yet in their moment one was
[49:04] conscious of his need
[49:06] and he recognized whose presence he was
[49:08] in and he died and he went to paradise
[49:11] and one was unconscious of whose
[49:12] presence he was in and he died
[49:15] and went to hell one thing i want us to
[49:18] recognize today
[49:21] is a lack of recognition doesn't mean it
[49:24] wasn't your opportunity
[49:27] just because you failed to grab it
[49:29] doesn't mean he didn't come by your way
[49:32] just because you didn't seize the
[49:33] opportunity doesn't mean opportunity
[49:35] wasn't given
[49:37] do not fail to see your opportunity
[49:40] do not fail to recognize him when he
[49:42] moves past us
[49:44] we must be a god-conscious
[49:48] people time after time brother brown
[49:51] would talk about recognize his presence
[49:53] he would speak about being aware of his
[49:55] presence he would tell people you must
[49:57] be
[49:58] god conscious there are over over a
[50:01] thousand quotes dealing with aware
[50:03] conscious recognizing and the importance
[50:06] of not missing
[50:06] opportunities in his presence he would
[50:10] say may every sick person in here be
[50:12] healed tonight
[50:13] granite lord may there be such a scream
[50:15] go up lord until tomorrow that the city
[50:17] will be awakened
[50:18] with great testimonies everywhere and
[50:20] men may come
[50:21] conscious of god and get away from this
[50:24] earthbound sense
[50:25] move out into the realms of the
[50:27] supernatural
[50:28] and believe the lord jesus christ
[50:31] blessed father
[50:32] we are indeed privileged tonight to be
[50:35] here in this great city of south men
[50:37] and a greater privilege than that is to
[50:39] be assembled with these great people
[50:40] tonight
[50:41] the purchase of thy blood and we would
[50:43] ask you to visit us
[50:45] with a great visitation of thy presence
[50:47] and make us
[50:48] all god conscious tonight that you
[50:51] are ever near make us all god conscious
[50:56] this morning lord that you are ever near
[50:58] that you are with us in this service
[50:59] you'll be with us when we leave you'll
[51:01] be with us in our homes
[51:02] the angels of the lord and camp about
[51:04] those that fear him
[51:05] lord we are conscious of your presence
[51:07] this morning
[51:09] that's exactly what satan doesn't want
[51:11] to happen
[51:13] that's why he brings circumstance that's
[51:14] why he clogs the channel that's why he
[51:16] moves and brings disturbances
[51:18] that's exactly what he can't have you
[51:20] recognize
[51:21] that whatever you find yourself in today
[51:24] whatever your situation is god
[51:26] is right there with you in that moment
[51:28] he is with you in that situation he
[51:30] hasn't
[51:31] left your side he's ever near he's the
[51:33] ever-present help
[51:34] in the time of need so what he don't
[51:36] want you to recognize
[51:38] is that your victory is standing right
[51:40] next to you this morning
[51:41] your moment of deliverance is right next
[51:43] to you this morning he's not a thousand
[51:46] miles away
[51:46] he's in your pew he's next to you he's
[51:49] walking up and down this aisle
[51:50] victory is in the building this morning
[51:56] satan wars against you to try to make
[51:58] you miss that opportunity
[52:01] look our battle is to be conscious of
[52:03] god
[52:04] in a world that has put him completely
[52:06] out of their minds
[52:08] to be conscious of god in a world that
[52:11] has come
[52:11] to put him completely out of their
[52:13] thinking completely out of their
[52:15] consciousness
[52:17] and if he is brought into their thinking
[52:19] is looked at with disdain
[52:21] he's looked at with contempt his
[52:24] teaching
[52:24] the bible his word is looked at with
[52:26] disdain and contempt
[52:28] you are looked at with disdain and
[52:29] contempt because you have some semblance
[52:31] of morals you have something that
[52:33] matches up with the word of god
[52:34] there's goodness and there's
[52:36] righteousness and they hate it because
[52:38] your life condemns their life
[52:39] your life cries out against the life
[52:41] they're living your life speaks of
[52:43] better things and they can't take it
[52:45] because the darkness comprehendeth it
[52:47] not
[52:48] so you're looked at with contempt the
[52:50] word is looked at with contempt
[52:52] and they don't even acknowledge his
[52:54] existence much less his presence
[52:57] currently working and to those that and
[53:00] to those that do say they believe
[53:03] it's more of a perspective of an i was
[53:05] god
[53:07] instead of an i am god we live in an
[53:10] ever increasing anti-god
[53:12] society that it does all it can
[53:16] all it can to influence you to make you
[53:18] unaware of the presence of almighty god
[53:21] to make you miss your opportunities
[53:24] these these statistics here i found
[53:26] pretty amazing in 1999
[53:30] which doesn't seem that long ago to me
[53:33] i was a senior in high school a lot of
[53:35] you were not born
[53:37] a lot of you were already old i didn't
[53:40] say that
[53:41] i didn't see it
[53:47] 1999 70
[53:50] of americans were church members
[53:54] i looked at that number and i went wow
[53:55] it was a good place in 1999.
[53:58] i mean it's just kind of how it made me
[53:59] feel really 7 out of 10 people in this
[54:01] country
[54:02] went to church
[54:06] 2020 50
[54:09] are church members that includes
[54:11] everybody
[54:14] catholics baptist pentecost
[54:18] methodist assemblies non-denomination
[54:20] you name it anybody that
[54:22] claims christianity 50
[54:25] of americans are church members here's
[54:28] the bad part
[54:29] 41 of that 50 actually go to church on a
[54:33] regular basis
[54:36] we are in an anti-god godless society
[54:38] that has put him out of their minds
[54:41] has put him out of their consciousness
[54:43] he they have pushed him so far away they
[54:45] can't even recognize him when he moves
[54:47] they can't recognize the presence of god
[54:49] they don't recognize the goodness of god
[54:51] but you have to recognize you have to be
[54:54] aware
[54:55] you can't miss your opportunity we can't
[54:57] keep looking at what are they doing what
[54:59] are they doing what are they doing
[55:00] their calling is not my business my
[55:03] calling is to take a rapture
[55:04] my calling is to serve god my calling is
[55:07] to overcome
[55:08] my calling is to be victorious so i'm
[55:09] going to look at me and i'ma say as for
[55:11] me
[55:12] and my house in this godless society in
[55:14] this godless civilization
[55:16] we will serve the lord we will walk
[55:18] according to his statutes we will walk
[55:20] according to his word
[55:22] as for me and my house as for evening
[55:24] like tabernacle
[55:25] we will serve the lord
[55:28] hallelujah prophet says you know it used
[55:31] to be if a woman or man said they was a
[55:33] christian
[55:34] people respected it but today they just
[55:37] like to see how much fun they can make
[55:38] out of it
[55:40] see this irreverent group my why why do
[55:42] they do that
[55:43] this is the reason they're not conscious
[55:46] that that's the truth
[55:47] they're not conscious of god
[55:50] oh what a dark picture what an evil
[55:53] world that we live in
[55:54] but let me tell you something church
[55:56] somebody's gonna recognize him
[55:57] somebody's gonna overcome somebody's
[55:59] gonna wash his feet
[56:00] somebody's gonna say that's my lord
[56:02] that's my savior that's the holy ghost
[56:04] moving in our midst that's my deliverer
[56:06] that's the one i have need of lord jesus
[56:09] have mercy on me this morning
[56:12] somebody's gonna call out in spite of it
[56:14] all
[56:15] because church he's not just coming back
[56:17] for a bunch of people that claim i'm a
[56:18] christian
[56:19] he's not just coming back for some
[56:21] people that go to church every now and
[56:23] again or
[56:23] some people that claim the message he's
[56:25] coming back for people that love his
[56:27] appearing
[56:28] he's coming back for people who love him
[56:30] and recognize him and worship him
[56:32] he is their all in all he is their
[56:34] everything that's who he's coming back
[56:36] for i say lord
[56:37] let me be one of those light the fire in
[56:39] my heart may i always be aware may i
[56:42] always be conscious may i always be
[56:43] looking
[56:44] for your presence
[56:48] this bride will be in tune with the
[56:50] presence of god
[56:54] because they love him they seek daily to
[56:57] live in his presence
[56:59] they recognize him in all their
[57:01] blessings
[57:03] in all good things they recognize this
[57:05] is god this is god's hand upon my life
[57:08] they are conscious of him moving in
[57:11] their services
[57:12] they honor him and cry out to him when
[57:14] he passes by
[57:16] his presence is heaven to them
[57:20] his presence is everything to them and
[57:23] like moses said there in exodus 33
[57:26] if thy presence go not with me carry us
[57:29] not up hence
[57:30] lord i can't face today without your
[57:32] presence i can't face tomorrow without
[57:34] your presence
[57:35] i can't face the next day without your
[57:37] presence so today lord i'm looking for
[57:39] it today i'm looking for my opportunity
[57:41] i'm going to grab hold because i know
[57:42] you're going to go before me i know
[57:44] you're going to drive out the enemy i
[57:46] know you're going to bring me victory
[57:47] i must have you in my life every moment
[57:50] every day
[57:51] every hour i must have you
[57:55] well he's here he's here
[57:58] not just in this age not just in this
[58:00] world he's in this building today
[58:03] he's here to rescue you he's here to
[58:04] save you he's here to deliver you but
[58:06] you've got to recognize
[58:08] it it can't just be oh look sister's
[58:10] getting a blessing oh look brother's
[58:11] getting a blessing oh hitting this
[58:13] wonderful hallelujah that's great we
[58:15] should enter in when others get a
[58:16] blessing but every service is your
[58:18] opportunity
[58:19] every service is your moment every
[58:20] service you should be desperate
[58:22] god i have need of you now
[58:28] this bride will be god conscious
[58:31] conscious means aware of now here's the
[58:34] part that gets a lot of
[58:36] aware of and responding to
[58:42] and conscious means aware of and
[58:45] responding to listen
[58:49] you can have your eyes wide open and not
[58:50] be conscious
[58:53] you can seemingly be awake and not be
[58:55] conscious
[58:56] there must be a responding to when the
[58:58] holy spirit sweeps across the place
[59:00] and the place erupts and you sit there
[59:02] and look around like what's going on
[59:04] it's because you're not conscious
[59:06] it's because you're not aware of what's
[59:07] happening you're not aware of who's in
[59:09] the building
[59:10] surely we believe the scripture where
[59:11] two or three are gathered
[59:13] there i am in the midst if we really
[59:14] believe that scripture how do we act the
[59:16] way we act in church
[59:18] if we really believe the king of kings
[59:20] is right here right now there should be
[59:22] a cry that goes forth from our heart
[59:24] there should be a worship a praise a
[59:26] repentance a cry out
[59:28] he's here he's here right now he's here
[59:31] but sometimes it takes a blind man to
[59:33] recognize him
[59:34] church you've seen you've heard and you
[59:36] know he's here
[59:37] he deserves all you have
[59:41] oh he said the rocks would cry out some
[59:43] of us think they need to rewrite that to
[59:45] say
[59:45] if i don't do my part the rocks will nod
[59:52] the reason people nod because sometimes
[59:54] we can't tell the difference as if
[59:56] you're agreeing or falling asleep
[1:00:02] i'm not sure if you're with me if you're
[1:00:03] dreaming
[1:00:06] can't tell
[1:00:10] conscious aware of and responding to
[1:00:12] one's surroundings
[1:00:14] painfully aware of means you can't sit
[1:00:17] still
[1:00:18] you can't hardly stand it the spirit's
[1:00:21] moving and it's almost painful to sit
[1:00:22] still
[1:00:23] it's painful to stay in your seat and
[1:00:24] you see people that are painfully aware
[1:00:26] because they sit there and all of a
[1:00:27] sudden they can't take it no more and
[1:00:28] they erupt out of the seat they come
[1:00:30] out of the seat they come praising
[1:00:32] because they're painfully aware they're
[1:00:33] sensitive to
[1:00:34] they're conscious of they're responding
[1:00:36] to his presence
[1:00:41] before the fall of man being conscious
[1:00:43] of god was not difficult
[1:00:48] adam had never experienced doubt
[1:00:52] he had never experienced fear he had
[1:00:53] never experienced unbelief
[1:00:56] the things that we fight with today that
[1:00:58] blinds us to that realm
[1:01:00] the thing that makes it difficult for us
[1:01:02] to recognize his presence
[1:01:04] he wasn't familiar with these he didn't
[1:01:07] even know of their existence
[1:01:09] it's after the fall in genesis 3 10 that
[1:01:11] the word afraid is first used
[1:01:14] genesis 3 10 and he said i heard thy
[1:01:16] voice in the garden
[1:01:18] and i was afraid because i was naked
[1:01:21] and i hid myself
[1:01:25] if the voice of god booms forth in a
[1:01:27] church service
[1:01:30] and the response to it or the voice
[1:01:32] itself brings fear
[1:01:35] you can place yourself right there
[1:01:38] because there's something wrong
[1:01:40] and you're hiding yourself from it
[1:01:43] there's no freedom and you're scared of
[1:01:45] it you're scared to move in it because
[1:01:46] there's something not right
[1:01:49] so you hide yourself from his presence
[1:01:54] right in that moment satan recognizes
[1:01:56] his weapon to keep people
[1:01:59] from being blessed in his presence fear
[1:02:04] he saw that fear would keep you from
[1:02:06] running to him
[1:02:07] and it would cause you to run from him
[1:02:11] and it would cause you to hide from the
[1:02:13] very one who could deliver you
[1:02:14] the phrase fear not is used at least 80
[1:02:17] times in the bible
[1:02:18] fear not fear not fear not fear not fear
[1:02:21] not
[1:02:22] fear not it's because the lord knowing
[1:02:24] what the enemy would do
[1:02:25] knowing how he would attack you knowing
[1:02:27] how he would pull upon you
[1:02:28] because he knows satan uses fear to make
[1:02:31] you miss your opportunities
[1:02:34] satan uses fear to limit your victories
[1:02:37] satan uses fear to keep you from
[1:02:39] receiving everything in a service or
[1:02:40] everything during the week or everything
[1:02:42] out of life even in your personal prayer
[1:02:43] time
[1:02:44] he uses fear to keep you from being all
[1:02:46] that you are called to be
[1:02:49] fear well i'm not afraid sure a lot of
[1:02:51] us are
[1:02:52] we may not even recognize this fear not

[1:03:11] think and listen for some people maybe
[1:03:14] it's just passing thoughts and it was
[1:03:15] not even a hindrance but for some people
[1:03:16] fear is crippling
[1:03:18] for some people it grabs a whole tone
[1:03:20] and it brings them down
[1:03:22] and it's nothing more this morning i
[1:03:23] want you to recognize it's nothing more
[1:03:25] than a bluff

[1:05:20] family what about
[1:05:23] and the whole time you're walking right
[1:05:25] back towards that jail cell
[1:05:27] and you walk into it and you shut the
[1:05:30] door
[1:05:31] he got me out he didn't get you you
[1:05:32] walked back
[1:05:35] what about what about when my family has
[1:05:37] troubles what about
[1:05:38] let me tell you how that's all going to
[1:05:39] turn out what about when trials come
[1:05:41] what about when the waters rise what
[1:05:43] about when the fire comes
[1:05:44] he'll raise a standard there'll be a
[1:05:46] fourth man his word declares you have
[1:05:48] nothing to fear
[1:05:49] what about here's how it turns out
[1:05:51] isaiah 43 and 1
[1:05:53] but now thus saith the lord that created
[1:05:56] thee he's talking to you
[1:05:58] oh jacob and he that formed thee o
[1:06:00] israel fear
[1:06:01] not for i have redeemed thee i have
[1:06:04] called thee by name
[1:06:06] thou art mine when thou passes through
[1:06:09] the waters what about the waters
[1:06:11] i will be with thee and through the
[1:06:13] rivers they shall not overflow thee
[1:06:15] when thou walkest through the fire thou
[1:06:17] shalt not be burned
[1:06:18] neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
[1:06:22] what is there to fear he said thou art
[1:06:25] mine
[1:06:26] and he said i won't lose the one that
[1:06:28] the father
[1:06:42] do i need to start over from the
[1:06:43] beginning how long
[1:06:49] nope
[1:06:54] you have nothing to fear
[1:06:58] the fire will not kindle upon them
[1:07:00] listen
[1:07:01] they didn't even get a little bit damp
[1:07:02] when they crossed the red sea they
[1:07:04] walked across on dry land so you're not
[1:07:06] just going to get through this trial
[1:07:08] you're going to walk as if it's just the
[1:07:09] most perfect road it's going to be paved
[1:07:12] with perfection
[1:07:13] you're not even gonna get your feet
[1:07:14] muddy you're walking through on dry land
[1:07:16] because when he does something he does
[1:07:17] it right
[1:07:18] when god moves he moves when god says
[1:07:21] it's your time it's your time
[1:07:22] now the only thing that can hinder it is
[1:07:24] if you let something steal your
[1:07:26] opportunity
[1:07:27] if you'll take your eyes off the wind
[1:07:29] and take your eyes off the waves and get
[1:07:30] your eyes up on jesus and say lord
[1:07:32] i perish save me i can guarantee you
[1:07:35] right now
[1:07:36] he will reach down through hell he will
[1:07:38] reach down through sickness he will
[1:07:39] reach down through torment and spirits
[1:07:41] he will reach down through every twist
[1:07:42] and everything you can think of and he
[1:07:44] will pull you from those waters he will
[1:07:47] pull you from those waters
[1:07:49] recognize who he is this morning
[1:07:53] we are a people who have recognized his
[1:07:56] presence
[1:07:57] a message came and made us god conscious
[1:08:00] and his presence doesn't cause us to
[1:08:02] hide
[1:08:03] his presence brings us victory
[1:08:06] before adam fell the voice of god was a
[1:08:09] daily occurrence to man
[1:08:11] his presence was expected every day as
[1:08:13] he would come and walk in the garden
[1:08:16] he would fellowship with his children he
[1:08:19] says now in the beginning when god come
[1:08:20] down in the evening and talk to adam and
[1:08:22] eve in the core of the day
[1:08:24] and his grace great voice whispered to
[1:08:26] them
[1:08:28] and they had fellowship oh they love one
[1:08:31] another
[1:08:32] how the moving of the spirit went
[1:08:33] through the bushes the lines would come
[1:08:36] up
[1:08:36] the tigers all of them and they worship
[1:08:39] the lord
[1:08:41] man was conscious at all times that his
[1:08:44] presence
[1:08:45] was with him but the fall
[1:08:48] separated man from that consciousness
[1:08:52] now bear with me as i go through this
[1:08:53] next part it says now god when he made
[1:08:56] man in the beginning he made him
[1:08:58] superior to anything on earth
[1:09:00] he gave him the jurisdiction of
[1:09:02] everything on earth
[1:09:03] to control everything he controlled the
[1:09:06] animal life
[1:09:07] he controlled the foul life the fishes
[1:09:09] of the sea he controlled the winds
[1:09:11] he controlled the plant life he
[1:09:13] controlled
[1:09:14] everything that was adam
[1:09:17] he could speak to the trees and they
[1:09:19] would obey him he could speak to the
[1:09:21] wildlife
[1:09:22] it would obey him he could speak to the
[1:09:24] waters ever what it was
[1:09:26] everything obeyed adam now that was the
[1:09:28] beginning of man
[1:09:30] that's what god give him power over
[1:09:32] everything on the earth
[1:09:34] now though the fall through the fall he
[1:09:37] lost that power then he become
[1:09:40] unconscious of the fact after losing his
[1:09:43] relationship
[1:09:44] and friendship and fellowship with the
[1:09:46] father then he lost that
[1:09:48] and all of these great channels become
[1:09:50] clogged up
[1:09:52] and he couldn't get through now what
[1:09:54] adam was in god
[1:09:56] christ has redeemed us back to
[1:09:59] that now a redeemer to redeem
[1:10:02] anything is to bring it back to its
[1:10:05] origin
[1:10:06] again now when man fell he lost this
[1:10:09] and now what he lost in the fall christ
[1:10:11] come as a redeemer
[1:10:12] did you ever stop to think what christ
[1:10:14] redeemed us for
[1:10:16] he gave us everlasting life he brought
[1:10:18] us back to the eternal fellowship in
[1:10:20] relationship to god
[1:10:21] to be his sons and daughters again to
[1:10:23] restore back
[1:10:24] all that adam lost in the fall now the
[1:10:27] thing of it is since he was restored
[1:10:29] man back to his place man in the fall
[1:10:31] has lost his conscience
[1:10:33] of what father put him here on earth to
[1:10:36] do
[1:10:37] in other words all the plumbing as it
[1:10:39] was in our brain
[1:10:40] in the outlets the faith has been
[1:10:42] clogged up with business
[1:10:44] affairs with home life with domestic
[1:10:47] things
[1:10:47] it's all become so clogged
[1:10:51] clogged up with that until god can't
[1:10:53] operate through those channels that he
[1:10:55] made man for
[1:10:56] now when god made the human body every
[1:10:58] little part had its place to play
[1:11:00] the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose
[1:11:02] god does everything in there to make it
[1:11:04] perfect in operation
[1:11:06] to make the man to live and if god so
[1:11:09] patterned the man
[1:11:10] the body of a man how much more has he
[1:11:12] patterned and set in order the body
[1:11:14] of his church and he's designed us to
[1:11:17] come together in heavenly places in
[1:11:19] christ jesus
[1:11:20] now here we go listen and have these
[1:11:23] supernatural workings of god
[1:11:25] outlets through gifts of the spirit such
[1:11:27] as prophecy and wisdom
[1:11:29] and knowledge and gifts of healing and
[1:11:31] all these other different gifts is
[1:11:33] outlets that god lets out his power and
[1:11:36] lets out his revelation to the people
[1:11:39] now satan by the laws of sin and death
[1:11:42] makes everything that sin and death
[1:11:44] bought operate and so satan sends a
[1:11:47] cancer
[1:11:48] and man recognizes it
[1:11:51] satan sends a cancer and man recognize
[1:11:54] it and receives it
[1:11:56] satan sends heartaches we recognize it
[1:11:59] and receive it and if satan by his power
[1:12:02] can make his laws work in man how much
[1:12:05] more ought god with his power
[1:12:07] make his laws work in man if satan can
[1:12:10] make his laws be sure
[1:12:12] and us recognize it if satan can make
[1:12:14] you recognize his laws
[1:12:17] how much more of god to his children
[1:12:19] make his laws be recognized among us
[1:12:23] he'd be recognized among the people
[1:12:25] divine healing revelation
[1:12:26] power gifts manifestations of the spirit
[1:12:28] the law of sin and death works in the
[1:12:30] people and the law of liberty of christ
[1:12:32] has come unto us to set us free from
[1:12:34] those things so i believe
[1:12:36] with all my heart i believe we're
[1:12:38] nearing the age when people are going to
[1:12:40] recognize these things
[1:12:42] we live in a world that recognizes satan
[1:12:45] we live in a world that recognizes evil
[1:12:47] it recognizes heartache it recognizes
[1:12:49] cancer it recognizes everything the
[1:12:51] devil can put on and it brings fear upon
[1:12:53] people's life
[1:12:53] but what about what god said what about
[1:12:56] recognizing his promise
[1:12:58] what about recognizing his power
[1:12:59] recognizing his authority
[1:13:01] recognizing your ability to speak and
[1:13:03] take god at his word
[1:13:04] and be victorious over every law of
[1:13:06] satan over every law of death
[1:13:09] you have that authority but you got to
[1:13:11] recognize it
[1:13:13] that's always been the battle since the
[1:13:15] fall and that has been man's failure
[1:13:18] recognizing what god did pointing to
[1:13:21] what he's going to do
[1:13:22] and failing to see where he's moving at
[1:13:23] right now failing to see how he's
[1:13:26] operating right now
[1:13:27] in our midst
[1:13:30] failing to recognize that he's an
[1:13:31] ever-present on-time god
[1:13:33] who's working right now
[1:13:38] the first age the first age didn't fail
[1:13:40] to recognize it
[1:13:42] the first age fresh off the outpouring
[1:13:45] at the day of pentecost
[1:13:47] experienced a great awakening of the
[1:13:49] supernatural
[1:13:51] men and women had supernatural
[1:13:53] experiences they were filled with the
[1:13:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:57] miracles were a common thing the
[1:13:59] supernatural actually became very
[1:14:01] natural to them
[1:14:02] it became what they expected the
[1:14:05] miraculous is how they lived
[1:14:06] the miraculous is what they saw and so
[1:14:08] when something moved they didn't miss it
[1:14:10] because they were in tune in it
[1:14:11] the problem is so many of us live
[1:14:13] outside the spirit and presence of god
[1:14:14] that we can't recognize the
[1:14:15] presence of god when it comes our way
[1:14:17] what's that well i don't know you should
[1:14:19] have recognized it yesterday in your
[1:14:20] home too
[1:14:22] we've gotten so far away from it but
[1:14:24] that first age they were easy to
[1:14:26] recognize because miracles were a common
[1:14:28] thing supernatural was natural
[1:14:30] seeing god move is what they expected
[1:14:32] because the kinsmen redeemer had come
[1:14:34] and closed that chasm back between god
[1:14:36] and man
[1:14:37] the kinsmen redeemer had come and paid
[1:14:39] the price and hit everything adam lost
[1:14:41] he had redeemed back to man and that
[1:14:42] chasm
[1:14:43] had been closed but once again satan
[1:14:45] would try to steal these things away
[1:14:48] down through the ages by burying them
[1:14:50] behind creeds
[1:14:52] burying them behind dogmas burying them
[1:14:54] behind church denominations and you got
[1:14:57] to be a part of this and you got to be a
[1:14:58] part of that
[1:14:59] and in the name of religion the power of
[1:15:01] god was stripped away from the people
[1:15:04] in the name of religion it was stripped
[1:15:06] away and taken away and once again you
[1:15:08] saw a church go into a deep dark slumber
[1:15:10] you saw a church go to sleep unaware of
[1:15:13] the supernatural moving of god
[1:15:14] unconscious of what he was capable to do
[1:15:16] but let me tell you something you may be
[1:15:18] unconscious this morning
[1:15:19] but this is a determined god he's not
[1:15:21] going to leave you unconscious
[1:15:22] he's not going to leave you sitting
[1:15:24] where you're sitting he's coming by your
[1:15:25] way this morning and he's telling you
[1:15:27] wake up
[1:15:28] wake up i'm here wake up i'm moving he's
[1:15:30] not going to leave that particle out
[1:15:31] there asleep but the angel lord's
[1:15:33] shaking him right now in the pool
[1:15:35] in the pigpen saying wake up it's time
[1:15:37] to go home wake up
[1:15:38] he's not going to leave you unconscious
[1:15:40] he's a determined god he will have a
[1:15:41] bride he will have a people who
[1:15:43] recognize him
[1:15:44] he's not going to have a people just
[1:15:45] come strolling in we will be victorious
[1:15:47] over every sin
[1:15:48] victorious over every spirit we will go
[1:15:51] in victorious because he is determined
[1:15:54] you will
[1:15:54] he's not going to let you slumber he's
[1:15:56] not going to let you sleep he's saying
[1:15:57] wake up evening like tamara and i go
[1:15:59] wake up little bride the bridegroom
[1:16:02] cometh
[1:16:03] wake up wake up it's time to arise from
[1:16:05] your slumber
[1:16:07] you can't stay asleep you can't sit on
[1:16:10] the few sleeping
[1:16:11] you can't sleep through everyday life
[1:16:12] and not recognize my god is here
[1:16:15] and he's here for me
[1:16:21] he's determined and so once again he
[1:16:24] began to stir a sleeping church
[1:16:27] luther in the age of reformation wesley
[1:16:30] in the philadelphia age
[1:16:33] and we know that wesley was a key figure
[1:16:34] in the movement
[1:16:36] of the 1730s and 40s known in the 13
[1:16:39] colonies as the great awakening
[1:16:42] down through the early years of colonial
[1:16:44] america you had the first
[1:16:45] and you had the second great awakening
[1:16:48] and what this was was fervency for the
[1:16:50] things of god once again
[1:16:52] burned in man's conscience where
[1:16:54] secularism had come and
[1:16:56] the world had strayed away now once
[1:16:58] again there was a renewed fervency
[1:17:00] people began to look back to god began
[1:17:02] to seek god once again
[1:17:04] it was a it was an awakening then move
[1:17:07] forward into this day in the early
[1:17:09] 1900s you had the azusa street
[1:17:12] and people once again became aware of
[1:17:14] the gifts of the spirit
[1:17:15] the moving of the presence of god
[1:17:20] and then an angel visits a prophet he
[1:17:22] goes forth with a gift of divine healing
[1:17:24] a great message is delivered in the
[1:17:26] coming years of ministry
[1:17:27] and a bride begins to awaken out of her
[1:17:29] slumber
[1:17:30] there begins to become a people waking
[1:17:32] up and realizing
[1:17:33] i ain't part of this world i ain't a
[1:17:36] part of this burning
[1:17:37] i'm not a part of this system there's
[1:17:39] something that's called me out
[1:17:40] come out of her come out of her and it
[1:17:42] begins to ring in the hearts of
[1:17:44] individuals and he's not dealing
[1:17:45] with this specific denomination or this
[1:17:47] specific that hey there's wonderful
[1:17:48] people there what we got to remember is
[1:17:50] god deals with individuals
[1:17:52] he doesn't deal with churches let me
[1:17:53] tell you right now you can look at how
[1:17:54] you want i don't look at it that god is
[1:17:56] dealing with even like tabernacle this
[1:17:57] morning
[1:17:58] i look at it like he's dealing with you
[1:17:59] and he's dealing with you and he's
[1:18:00] dealing with you and he's dealing with
[1:18:01] you and dealing with you
[1:18:02] because he's not taking even like
[1:18:03] tabernacle in a rapture he's taking you
[1:18:05] in a rapture
[1:18:06] he's taking you in a rapture he's taken
[1:18:08] individuals in a rapture
[1:18:09] so he deals with people individually and
[1:18:11] this message came and it began to
[1:18:12] awaken people's hearts to the reality of
[1:18:15] god
[1:18:17] and abroad began to rise out of slumber
[1:18:19] the church had slumbered for ages and
[1:18:21] different movements and brought
[1:18:22] different types of awakenings
[1:18:25] but this was an awakening greater than
[1:18:27] any other
[1:18:28] as a bride began to be called out and
[1:18:30] made aware of the presence of her
[1:18:32] bridegroom
[1:18:34] awakening that awakening means the act
[1:18:37] of awakening from sleep
[1:18:39] a revival of interest or attention a
[1:18:42] recognition
[1:18:43] a realization or a coming into an
[1:18:46] awareness
[1:18:47] of something the bride was called to
[1:18:49] awake and to rise out of the slumber of
[1:18:51] dark denominationalism
[1:18:53] prophet would say now a few years ago
[1:18:55] when i started there was none of that
[1:18:56] going on
[1:18:57] and the only thing that this has done
[1:18:59] and this supernatural has awakened
[1:19:01] ministers out of the sense bound realm
[1:19:04] into a place where they can see god is
[1:19:07] present but the problem was even though
[1:19:11] there was nothing wrong with the message
[1:19:12] there was nothing wrong with the
[1:19:13] movement there was nothing wrong with
[1:19:14] any of that but so many people failed to
[1:19:16] realize who it was that was really here
[1:19:18] so many people failed to realize who it
[1:19:20] was that was being revealed
[1:19:22] they failed to realize who it was that
[1:19:23] had come to bring a message listen it
[1:19:25] was the mighty angel
[1:19:27] it was the lord jesus christ it was the
[1:19:29] pillar of fire that led
[1:19:30] israel it was the pillar of fire that
[1:19:32] meant paul that's who came to reveal
[1:19:35] this
[1:19:36] but says so many people fail to
[1:19:37] recognize this they fail to recognize
[1:19:39] this presence oh
[1:19:40] they recognize the prophet even the
[1:19:42] nominal world would declare in their
[1:19:44] magazines bible days are here again
[1:19:47] bible days not since the days of jesus
[1:19:49] have things but they recognized the
[1:19:51] prophet
[1:19:52] but they didn't recognize who was being
[1:19:54] revealed who was the prophet
[1:19:55] pointing to this wasn't about a man this
[1:19:59] isn't man worship he was pointing to
[1:20:00] something he was pointing to someone he
[1:20:02] was trying to wake you up to the fact
[1:20:04] jesus christ is here jesus is here who
[1:20:07] is it healing your children
[1:20:09] who is it delivering you who is it
[1:20:11] saving you who is it you must have
[1:20:13] it's jesus jesus is here
[1:20:16] he's the one moving recognized
[1:20:19] recognized this morning he was pointing
[1:20:22] to jesus
[1:20:26] but then the prophets taken off the
[1:20:28] scene and many believe those things were
[1:20:30] finished
[1:20:32] i don't mean to be rude but wrong
[1:20:36] wrong the message was to show
[1:20:42] that when he's present he jesus christ
[1:20:47] you can take the word and you can put it
[1:20:49] on your lips
[1:20:50] and you can speak and it's the same as
[1:20:52] deity speaking
[1:20:55] if you have the faith of a grain of
[1:20:56] mustard seed you say
[1:20:58] you say you say you don't need your
[1:21:00] favorite preacher up here
[1:21:02] all right otherwise we'd all be in
[1:21:04] trouble this morning
[1:21:09] you need jesus that's who's here
[1:21:12] that's who's speaking recognize it's him
[1:21:15] take the word on your lips
[1:21:17] and stand to what the message we're
[1:21:18] trying to get you to recognize
[1:21:20] who you are and your relationship to the
[1:21:22] one who is present
[1:21:23] now so the prophets taken off the scene
[1:21:26] they believed all that was finished
[1:21:28] and they weren't conscious that william
[1:21:31] branham never once pointed to himself
[1:21:34] he pointed to the lord jesus
[1:21:37] christ and i'm telling you this morning
[1:21:39] that jesus christ is here in this
[1:21:40] building he promised he would be i don't
[1:21:42] feel it brother aaron
[1:21:43] i'm not worried about that the word said
[1:21:45] he would be here
[1:21:46] the word said he would be here and so
[1:21:48] i'm telling this one that he is here and
[1:21:50] we must
[1:21:50] be god conscious we must be aware that
[1:21:53] he is in our midst
[1:21:54] we must recognize our opportunities we
[1:21:56] must act while we have the chance we
[1:21:58] must seize the moment we must seize the
[1:21:59] day
[1:22:01] but many are slumbering in this time
[1:22:03] where man says god has
[1:22:04] delayed his coming many say god has
[1:22:07] delayed his coming
[1:22:09] and so they are slumbering once again
[1:22:12] they're slumbering
[1:22:13] and yet he is passing by this moment and
[1:22:16] yet you must be aware and you must wake
[1:22:18] up his presence passing by
[1:22:19] listen you don't receive your blessing
[1:22:21] just by him passing by
[1:22:24] stop for a minute you do not receive a
[1:22:26] blessing just because he comes into this
[1:22:28] building
[1:22:28] just because he comes into your car just
[1:22:30] because he comes into your home
[1:22:32] look he's passed by many that receive
[1:22:34] nothing
[1:22:37] he's passed by many that turned him down
[1:22:39] he's passed by many that never
[1:22:40] recognized him
[1:22:42] you must recognize his presence and grab
[1:22:45] hold you must recognize you're in the
[1:22:48] presence of the king of kings
[1:22:50] i hear a prophet discerning sicknesses
[1:22:52] and i hear him discerning people's
[1:22:53] hearts
[1:22:54] and then i hear him calling and telling
[1:22:55] a person her name her address when he
[1:22:57] goes
[1:22:58] he says oh god she's going to miss it oh
[1:23:00] god she's missing it
[1:23:02] don't let her miss it and then he turns
[1:23:04] to someone he says
[1:23:06] she missed it but you got it
[1:23:10] it was her opportunity in his presence
[1:23:13] it passed by the angel lord passed by
[1:23:16] and she didn't recognize
[1:23:17] he can call our name sometimes and we
[1:23:19] don't recognize
[1:23:21] call our name tell you your problem it's
[1:23:24] discerned right from the pulpit the
[1:23:25] preacher's preaching you're going how's
[1:23:26] he know that
[1:23:29] but who told him who told him about that
[1:23:33] does anybody need to tell our god why do
[1:23:36] we come to church if we're not expecting
[1:23:37] the supernatural
[1:23:38] if we're not expecting him to move why
[1:23:40] are you here
[1:23:42] you could have gathered together
[1:23:43] anywhere read the bible and sang a song
[1:23:45] why do we gather together what is it
[1:23:47] we're looking for
[1:23:48] him to move him to speak and if you're
[1:23:51] constantly putting everything off that
[1:23:53] happens and something else there's some
[1:23:54] coincidence you missing moving
[1:23:56] and you miss your opportunity it's not
[1:23:58] just him moving you got to recognize it
[1:24:00] you gotta grab it
[1:24:01] we must be aware today we have to be
[1:24:03] conscious we have to wake up
[1:24:04] you're saying that a lot brother and i'm
[1:24:06] gonna keep saying it a lot that's what
[1:24:07] this is about today wake up
[1:24:09] recognize your opportunity wake up he's
[1:24:11] in the building wake up he's here in the
[1:24:12] last age wake up the bride's fisting to
[1:24:14] take a rapture wake up you don't want to
[1:24:16] miss it
[1:24:16] don't be found without oil in your lap
[1:24:18] don't be found without all in your lap
[1:24:20] wake up now's the time to get it now's
[1:24:22] the time to get it
[1:24:24] now's the time to get it look the
[1:24:26] sleeping virgins knew they needed oil
[1:24:28] they recognized that but they waited too
[1:24:30] late to get it
[1:24:30] they said today is the day to go get it
[1:24:32] and while they were gone he came
[1:24:33] and they were left behind wake up to the
[1:24:36] hour
[1:24:36] wake up to the moment it's going home
[1:24:39] time get your laps drilled get the oil
[1:24:41] in get your family sealed
[1:24:43] get serious about it it's time to go
[1:24:45] home church
[1:24:50] we must stay in contact with the
[1:24:51] supernatural
[1:24:56] whether it's booming out like it did
[1:24:57] here on wednesday night
[1:24:59] what a wonderful time whether it's
[1:25:01] booming out like it was here on
[1:25:03] wednesday night or whether it's that
[1:25:04] quiet unction of the holy ghost
[1:25:06] that moves on your heart at midday on a
[1:25:08] thursday and says
[1:25:10] call that brother call that sister
[1:25:13] or moves on your heart tomorrow and you
[1:25:15] feel to go to prayer for that friend
[1:25:17] that you haven't even spoke to in a
[1:25:18] couple weeks or months
[1:25:20] those things are supernatural we fail to
[1:25:21] realize them because the world is boom
[1:25:23] boom boom
[1:25:23] right and we miss the small
[1:25:28] we've lost contact with the unction
[1:25:31] church we got to be in contact with that
[1:25:32] aren't you
[1:25:33] because one of these mornings you're
[1:25:34] going to wake up and there's going to be
[1:25:35] an unction that says it's time to go
[1:25:38] it's time to go was that just me
[1:25:41] was that just my thinking i don't want
[1:25:44] to be the one sitting around debating
[1:25:46] i did i just think that well no there's
[1:25:49] going to be an auction that says
[1:25:50] it's rapture day it's going home time
[1:25:56] and i want to be so in contact with that
[1:25:57] spirit that when he that led us will let
[1:25:59] be taken out of the way that i can go
[1:26:01] with him
[1:26:02] when that spirit begins to rise up off
[1:26:04] the earth i'm in contact with that
[1:26:05] supernatural and i go
[1:26:07] with it as it rises up
[1:26:10] maybe even recognize when it's the
[1:26:12] preacher preaching he repeats
[1:26:13] conversations you've had in private or
[1:26:16] maybe he speaks directly to your heart
[1:26:17] about a sin question in your life
[1:26:19] however he moves however
[1:26:23] he moves we must be a people in tune
[1:26:25] with it that recognize it
[1:26:27] and we don't let the moment pass us by
[1:26:29] unaware
[1:26:32] i've been there i've been there
[1:26:36] when the lord moves and you know you're
[1:26:39] supposed to do something
[1:26:41] and you hesitate a moment it's gone
[1:26:46] there's not hardly a worse feeling
[1:26:50] he moves on you you hesitate because you
[1:26:52] think within the flesh should i
[1:26:53] yeah what it's over
[1:26:56] he's moved on when he moves on your
[1:26:58] heart move with it
[1:27:00] when he moves on your heart you go he
[1:27:02] says dance you dance he says shout you
[1:27:03] shout he says pray for that brother you
[1:27:05] pray for that brother he asked you go
[1:27:06] here go there you do it
[1:27:08] move in the unction of the holy spirit
[1:27:09] but some of us have gotten so far away
[1:27:11] from it
[1:27:12] that we don't recognize it anymore and
[1:27:15] we see others move in that option and go
[1:27:17] so emotional
[1:27:20] so emotional
[1:27:23] somebody doesn't recognize what god did
[1:27:25] for him
[1:27:27] and somebody does somebody's missing an
[1:27:29] opportunity
[1:27:30] somebody's receiving theirs don't be one
[1:27:33] sitting on the outside watching others
[1:27:35] get their opportunity or one day you're
[1:27:36] gonna watch others get a new body
[1:27:39] get in touch with the supernatural
[1:27:41] listen the body changes the most
[1:27:42] supernatural thing there is
[1:27:43] i'm not so sure about the supernatural
[1:27:45] well then you're not going to rapture
[1:27:47] because if you can tell me something
[1:27:48] more supernatural than a rapture and me
[1:27:49] getting a brand new body and this body
[1:27:51] being healthy in this body
[1:27:53] looking good or whatever you want to say
[1:27:56] that's supernatural
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:27:59] if you can't recognize the supernatural
[1:28:00] you'll never recognize a rapture
[1:28:02] this message is supernatural
[1:28:07] we can't continue to push every
[1:28:09] supernatural thing off and chalk it up
[1:28:11] to coincidence or somebody told him or
[1:28:13] that's just my
[1:28:14] feelings or that's just emotion listen
[1:28:16] that's a supernatural god
[1:28:19] he's a supernatural god who does
[1:28:20] supernatural things and move in
[1:28:21] supernatural ways which is beyond our
[1:28:23] comprehending
[1:28:24] it's beyond our minds and and even more
[1:28:27] than that it's not
[1:28:28] just that he wants us to believe the
[1:28:29] supernatural when we see it he wants us
[1:28:31] to expect the supernatural before we see
[1:28:33] it
[1:28:34] he wants us to come with an expectation
[1:28:36] listen i loved wednesday night it's one
[1:28:38] of the most powerful services i've ever
[1:28:40] been in thank you jesus
[1:28:41] but i expect to see him move on sunday i
[1:28:43] need him to move today
[1:28:45] i expect salvation today i expect
[1:28:47] healing today i expect deliverance today
[1:28:49] i expect to see him in this service
[1:28:51] today because he is an
[1:28:52] i am god he is ever present
[1:28:56] for your needs i loved wednesday it was
[1:28:59] phenomenal but i say lord give me a
[1:29:01] little bit more of that
[1:29:02] pour your spirit out on me a little more
[1:29:04] today i need you lord
[1:29:07] i need it today i'm looking for his
[1:29:11] presence today
[1:29:12] and even if he doesn't come the way i
[1:29:14] want him to or expect him to that
[1:29:16] doesn't mean he didn't come
[1:29:17] so i'm looking with an open mind lord
[1:29:19] how are you
[1:29:20] going to move today how are you going to
[1:29:23] speak today who are you going to pour
[1:29:25] yourself out on today
[1:29:26] lord i'm willing i'm looking i'm able so
[1:29:29] many people
[1:29:30] well i don't have any gifts i don't have
[1:29:32] to get to speak in tongues i don't have
[1:29:33] the gift to interpret i don't have this
[1:29:34] gift i don't have that how do you know
[1:29:37] you've never once lent yourself over to
[1:29:39] him and surrendered 100 to allow him to
[1:29:41] work through you
[1:29:47] how many gifts are hidden behind that's
[1:29:48] not my personality
[1:29:52] how many gifts are hidden behind that's
[1:29:54] just not in my nature
[1:29:56] that's why we preach a nature change
[1:30:02] that's why we preach a nature change
[1:30:05] that's just not my
[1:30:06] nature so you try and tell me that every
[1:30:08] single person that gets up and runs
[1:30:09] around this building just loves running
[1:30:13] because that's fun
[1:30:19] it's people that recognize his presence
[1:30:24] it's people that recognize his presence
[1:30:26] well they may not have got
[1:30:27] that might have been just emotional okay
[1:30:29] when jesus comes by i get emotional
[1:30:32] when jesus is in the building i get
[1:30:34] emotional brother branham said where
[1:30:35] jesus is there's lots of noise
[1:30:38] because people recognize he's in their
[1:30:40] presence
[1:30:42] people recognize it and i may not be
[1:30:45] perfect i may not have everything right
[1:30:47] but when my king walks in the door
[1:30:49] when my jesus walks in the door when my
[1:30:51] god walks in the door
[1:30:52] i'm gonna praise him i'm gonna shout i'm
[1:30:55] gonna dance
[1:30:56] i'm gonna worship i'm gonna give him
[1:30:58] everything because he deserves it
[1:31:00] he deserves it he deserves it
[1:31:05] hallelujah he deserves your praise and
[1:31:09] your worship
[1:31:10] so give him all of it give him all of it
[1:31:15] let me tell you what if all you can do
[1:31:17] is not nod with enthusiasm
[1:31:19] give him all of it
[1:31:23] let loose come on church
[1:31:27] he is here he's in the building
[1:31:30] his presence
[1:31:38] hallelujah i said hallelujah
[1:31:42] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:31:46] for there is none like you in heaven and
[1:31:48] earth there is none like you you are my
[1:31:50] king and my savior and my lord and i
[1:31:52] worship you
[1:31:54] oh i'm reminded what brother doug baker
[1:31:56] said
[1:31:57] he said if you're going to be a tear
[1:31:58] instead of a wheat at least be a
[1:32:00] biblical tear
[1:32:01] because tares raised their hand in
[1:32:02] worship
[1:32:03] [Applause]
[1:32:07] least be biblical what do we believe
[1:32:09] anyway
[1:32:10] if you don't believe in the supernatural
[1:32:12] and you don't believe in the movement of
[1:32:13] the spirit you don't believe this
[1:32:18] [Applause]
[1:32:24] message
[1:32:31] we must be conscious of the supernatural
[1:32:33] all the time
[1:32:35] sure we love it when he comes and we can
[1:32:36] feel it there's nothing like it
[1:32:38] there's no feeling better than the
[1:32:39] presence of god but what about when you
[1:32:41] don't feel it
[1:32:42] does that mean he ain't there
[1:32:45] are you aware of it are you awake to it
[1:32:47] are you conscious of it
[1:32:49] we gotta learn to recognize him every
[1:32:50] day all around us
[1:32:52] recognize him in your blessings
[1:32:55] recognize him in this service even
[1:32:56] if you don't feel it because he said
[1:32:57] he'd be here live in that presence so
[1:33:00] you can recognize that presence
[1:33:03] prophet god says five senses that we
[1:33:05] live in that's just a little world of
[1:33:07] our own
[1:33:08] but god we was only given these so we
[1:33:11] could contact our earthly home
[1:33:12] but there is senses beyond that another
[1:33:15] dimension
[1:33:16] and god is always present if we can only
[1:33:18] remember that the angels of the lord are
[1:33:20] encamped about those who fear him
[1:33:22] in this building tonight stands jesus
[1:33:24] christ
[1:33:25] that's enough right there in this
[1:33:26] building tonight stands jesus christ
[1:33:29] in this building tonight as host of
[1:33:31] angels thousands of them gathered around
[1:33:33] you don't see them but you can feel the
[1:33:35] influence of them
[1:33:36] telling you that they are here jesus
[1:33:39] christ is here present
[1:33:41] if we would be conscious of that and
[1:33:43] remember not only here but when you're
[1:33:44] walking down the street wherever you are
[1:33:47] you that profess to be believers and
[1:33:48] fear the lord remember the angels of god
[1:33:50] are moving with you wherever you are
[1:33:52] they watch everything you do every
[1:33:54] thought that goes through your mind
[1:33:55] they know all about you therefore we
[1:33:57] must be conscious
[1:33:59] of that
[1:34:02] talking about feeling and seeing and
[1:34:04] only believing when we can see things
[1:34:06] brother branham speaking here about
[1:34:07] gaheza and elijah talking about
[1:34:10] being aware and being god conscious and
[1:34:12] how they were surrounded by the
[1:34:13] assyrians
[1:34:15] and he said just the same tonight i
[1:34:17] wonder what would happen
[1:34:18] if a man here tonight had the power to
[1:34:20] strike across your eyes
[1:34:21] and say look standing around this
[1:34:23] tabernacle tonight
[1:34:25] you'd be a member here the rest of your
[1:34:27] life
[1:34:30] yes sir sometimes you can't see it with
[1:34:32] your natural eyes
[1:34:33] but you can feel the impulse of it
[1:34:36] something near
[1:34:37] a sixth sense that denotes something is
[1:34:40] near
[1:34:40] watch him this morning opening the deaf
[1:34:42] ears making the polio cripples walk
[1:34:44] around here like there was nothing wrong
[1:34:45] with them what is it
[1:34:46] it's the it's the sixth sense that's
[1:34:50] conscious the spirit that something is
[1:34:52] near
[1:34:53] now it goes back to talking about elijah
[1:34:54] and geheza and he says now
[1:34:57] he didn't see that at first talking
[1:35:00] about gehesa
[1:35:01] elijah probably didn't see it but he
[1:35:05] asked for the boy's eyes to see it but
[1:35:07] elisha was just conscious
[1:35:09] that they were there that prophet didn't
[1:35:12] have to see it that prophet had
[1:35:14] experienced enough
[1:35:16] he had been there enough he was aware of
[1:35:18] their presence
[1:35:19] but he knew gahesa needed that faith
[1:35:21] lifted up
[1:35:22] he needed his eyes to be opened so that
[1:35:24] he could believe prophet god said elisha
[1:35:26] didn't see it
[1:35:28] he didn't need to see it he was god
[1:35:29] conscious he was awake to his presence
[1:35:32] he was awake to the supernatural he was
[1:35:34] aware that god was with them in every
[1:35:36] situation brother and you mean we need
[1:35:39] to believe it when we see it well
[1:35:40] that's good if you do i'd rather you not
[1:35:43] be a skeptic when you see it
[1:35:44] sure believe it when you see it but what
[1:35:46] i mean is believe he's here
[1:35:48] and respond to him when you don't see it
[1:35:51] respond to him when you don't feel it
[1:35:53] be conscious of the supernatural
[1:35:55] conscious of his presence aware that
[1:35:57] he's in the build nowhere that he's
[1:35:58] working
[1:35:59] but i don't see it he's working i don't
[1:36:01] feel it he's working
[1:36:02] i'm telling you today he's working
[1:36:03] whether you see it whether you feel it
[1:36:05] whether you're here
[1:36:06] just get ready to kill the fatted calf
[1:36:08] the protocols are coming home
[1:36:10] the healings are taking place the
[1:36:12] deliverances are happening
[1:36:13] prison bars are being opened let me tell
[1:36:15] you what i don't feel it it's okay
[1:36:17] he's working i don't see it it's okay
[1:36:20] i'm aware of the supernatural i'm
[1:36:23] conscious that he's here
[1:36:24] and he's working in this building today
[1:36:30] we must be in constant expectation for
[1:36:33] the supernatural
[1:36:35] we want to be expecting his presence to
[1:36:37] sweep through like it did wednesdays
[1:36:38] that means going to every time maybe not
[1:36:39] like that but it's going to be here
[1:36:41] and i want to expect it to be here and i
[1:36:43] want to look for it
[1:36:46] look this message made many people aware
[1:36:48] of the supernatural
[1:36:50] made many people aware of his presence
[1:36:52] but it's like they hit the snooze button
[1:36:55] if the alarm went off and looked at it's
[1:36:56] kind of conscious from it they went
[1:37:03] look an alarm goes off to wake you up
[1:37:06] and you're aware for a moment
[1:37:07] of what's going on and what's happening
[1:37:10] now i know not everybody's the same but
[1:37:11] i'm such a deep sleeper
[1:37:13] but y'all go ahead and laugh it's fine i
[1:37:15] know this is odd
[1:37:17] but the alarm's on my white side of the
[1:37:18] bed because if it's on my side of bed
[1:37:21] i'd have been fired a long time ago
[1:37:24] because i don't come conscious easy i'll
[1:37:27] turn it off i'll unplug it and
[1:37:28] i wake up 9 30.
[1:37:32] i can't lie in church so i'm just being
[1:37:34] honest
[1:37:36] i don't wake up easy so my wife kicks me
[1:37:39] repeatedly
[1:37:43] [Applause]
[1:37:44] i don't i'm not sure but i think she
[1:37:46] finds joy in that
[1:37:49] she kicks me repeatedly till i finally
[1:37:51] say okay i'm up no you're not
[1:37:53] you might be awake but you ain't up and
[1:37:55] if i quit kicking you you can go right
[1:37:56] back to sleep
[1:37:58] and some people i know we all wake up a
[1:38:00] little bit different my dad will tell
[1:38:02] you he used to have to wake me up for
[1:38:03] school
[1:38:04] and he'd come sit on the staircase next
[1:38:06] to my bed
[1:38:08] he found joy in this i know and he would
[1:38:11] say my name
[1:38:12] over and over and over in the most
[1:38:13] monotonous repetitive tone it he didn't
[1:38:16] care if it took five minutes he knew i
[1:38:18] was irritated
[1:38:18] he'd sit there on the bed and go aaron
[1:38:21] aaron aaron
[1:38:22] aaron
[1:38:26] until i finally listen why are you still
[1:38:28] preaching that same message why are you
[1:38:29] still preaching the holy ghost why are
[1:38:30] you still preaching supernatural getting
[1:38:32] on my nerves i don't care about your
[1:38:33] nerves i need you to wake up
[1:38:34] wake up he's here wake up he's here wake
[1:38:37] up he's here wake up he's here
[1:38:39] wake up he's here the alarm clock got
[1:38:41] one job wake
[1:38:42] you up wake up he's here wake up
[1:38:46] he's here i'm tired of hearing it wake
[1:38:48] up he's
[1:38:49] here wake up
[1:38:53] got one job wake him up
[1:38:57] he's here
[1:39:04] oh sure we wake up for a little bit we
[1:39:06] hit the snooze button go back to sleep
[1:39:07] then another meeting comes or wednesday
[1:39:09] night comes and it stirs us and we're
[1:39:11] awake for the supernatural but then on
[1:39:12] thursday
[1:39:14] back down we go we didn't wake up
[1:39:19] if you keep hitting snooze too often the
[1:39:22] rapture is going to come during a snooze
[1:39:25] your opportunity's gonna come during the
[1:39:26] snooze yeah you wake up but you're late
[1:39:29] you wake up but the door closed you wake
[1:39:32] up but you missed it
[1:39:33] because you snoozed one too many times
[1:39:37] why does that alarm keep going off why
[1:39:40] are you preaching right here this is
[1:39:42] shallow
[1:39:44] i've been hearing this for 20 years
[1:39:45] always preaching deliverance well you
[1:39:47] didn't have a problem with deliverance
[1:39:48] when you was the one that needed it
[1:39:52] and apparently you need it again
[1:39:56] and not everybody's where you claim to
[1:39:58] be
[1:39:59] some people's just starting they need it
[1:40:01] and like i said so do you
[1:40:02] i bet you're one of them people that
[1:40:04] didn't like the 11th hour worker
[1:40:08] not everybody starts at the same time
[1:40:17] wake up
[1:40:22] you actually think you've gotten up you
[1:40:25] actually think you're
[1:40:26] have you ever dreamed you got up
[1:40:30] that's what happened with a lot of
[1:40:31] people with this message they heard it
[1:40:33] oh they're awake
[1:40:35] i think they're white but you're laying
[1:40:36] there and you think you're awake you're
[1:40:37] going through all the motions are you
[1:40:38] standing there brushing your teeth
[1:40:40] and all sudden alarm goes off and you're
[1:40:41] still laying in the bed
[1:40:45] huh how'd that happen you thought you
[1:40:48] woke up
[1:40:50] you thought you moved but you wasn't
[1:40:52] conscious
[1:40:54] it startled you i'm just gonna let here
[1:40:57] a few more minutes
[1:40:57] i'm awake i'm good
[1:41:01] so many thoughts they're waiting at
[1:41:02] their sleep sound asleep in their
[1:41:05] correct doctrine
[1:41:07] unaware of his presence sound asleep in
[1:41:10] their manufactured holiness
[1:41:13] sound asleep in their work sound asleep
[1:41:15] in their worship
[1:41:16] because they heard an alarm go off and
[1:41:18] they think they're awake
[1:41:19] and they're totally unaware that he's
[1:41:21] moving
[1:41:23] not recognizing his presence right among
[1:41:25] them the most supernatural
[1:41:27] message to ever strike the earth is
[1:41:29] become a religion to him
[1:41:31] just a religion just a covering this is
[1:41:33] what i do
[1:41:35] and in that stupor everything outside
[1:41:36] that comfort zone
[1:41:39] because you're in a stupor and you're
[1:41:40] comfortable and you're under that
[1:41:41] blanket
[1:41:43] and you see the evil in the world and so
[1:41:45] you snuggle down under that blanket a
[1:41:47] little bit more
[1:41:48] it's like hearing the robber break in
[1:41:49] and crawling on your blanket thing's
[1:41:50] going to protect you
[1:41:53] see you snuggle down a little bit more
[1:41:55] so bad out there let me get in my
[1:41:56] religion
[1:41:57] let me listen to another tape that's
[1:41:59] good you should
[1:42:00] you better get jesus you better find him
[1:42:04] you better wake up to the fact that he's
[1:42:06] here you better wake up to the fact that
[1:42:07] he won't be here much longer
[1:42:13] so you're in a stupor and everything
[1:42:14] outside that comfort zone is just talked
[1:42:16] up to that's just pentecostal
[1:42:18] that's just emotion was that really a
[1:42:21] healing
[1:42:22] and didn't the doctors play a big part
[1:42:23] in that was that really a healing
[1:42:25] was that really a deliverance oh this
[1:42:27] testimony again
[1:42:29] how many times uh until you wake up
[1:42:33] oh this testimony again oh but then a
[1:42:36] stirring will come like wednesday night
[1:42:38] and it wakes you up church if that
[1:42:39] didn't wake you up wednesday night
[1:42:42] i believe even like tabernacles should
[1:42:43] be wide awake right now i believe you're
[1:42:45] awake to the supernatural what am i
[1:42:46] telling you don't snooze it
[1:42:48] don't snooze it today don't hit snooze
[1:42:50] don't go back to your comfort zone
[1:42:52] stay out listen there's an old saying
[1:42:53] that life begins
[1:42:55] where your comfort zone ends life begins
[1:42:58] where your comfort zone ends so quit
[1:43:00] sitting there in a state of death every
[1:43:02] service and stay outside that comfort
[1:43:04] zone
[1:43:04] stay in that place of worship stay in
[1:43:06] that place of recognizing
[1:43:08] stay in that place where the holy spirit
[1:43:09] can move are you trying to dictate how i
[1:43:11] worship
[1:43:12] no i'm just telling you to worship i'm
[1:43:15] just telling you to worship
[1:43:16] i don't care how you worship i'm just
[1:43:18] asking you to be willing to worship when
[1:43:20] he comes in the building
[1:43:23] some people if they ask you hey where do
[1:43:25] you worship if you told them even like
[1:43:26] tabernacle you'd be lying
[1:43:30] might be where you go to church
[1:43:35] lord help me move on
[1:43:43] stay alert so that you never fail to
[1:43:45] miss him moving
[1:43:46] it takes a stirring to be pulled from a
[1:43:48] slumber and when you're asleep you don't
[1:43:49] like a stirring
[1:43:51] nobody does we don't like to be stirred
[1:43:53] when we're comfortable
[1:43:55] but i say today lord stir us up stir us
[1:43:57] up a little bit this morning lord make
[1:43:59] us aware
[1:44:00] brother brown says i feel real good
[1:44:01] about it anyhow what this church needs
[1:44:03] today is a good revival
[1:44:04] not a new doctrine a new order just a
[1:44:07] stirring up of what you already know
[1:44:09] about
[1:44:10] he says oh brother what we need today is
[1:44:11] an old stern of the holy ghost again
[1:44:13] brother if it had to come to me but it
[1:44:15] had to come to me before god ever
[1:44:16] manifested himself
[1:44:18] we need another rushing mighty wind
[1:44:20] scent that's right
[1:44:21] as it did on the day of pentecost they
[1:44:23] were all religious
[1:44:24] and they were all followers of jesus but
[1:44:26] they had to go and receive the baptism
[1:44:28] of the holy ghost is that true
[1:44:30] they never done like the baptists do and
[1:44:32] shake hands and put their name on the
[1:44:33] book and say yes i'm born again
[1:44:35] they didn't have it like that there's
[1:44:36] not a scripture is that in the whole
[1:44:37] bible
[1:44:38] and then the catholics come out and they
[1:44:40] stick out their tongue take the holy
[1:44:41] eucharist and say we got the holy ghost
[1:44:43] ain't no scripture like that in the
[1:44:44] bible
[1:44:45] we methodists go on prohibition for six
[1:44:47] months and there's no such scripture in
[1:44:48] the bible for that
[1:44:49] and listen they didn't also just say
[1:44:51] well i recognize john the baptist was
[1:44:52] the forerunner that didn't do it for him
[1:44:54] either
[1:44:55] they didn't say i recognize that malachi
[1:44:57] 4 has come god sent a prophet that
[1:44:58] didn't do it for him either what did it
[1:45:00] the bible said when the day of pentecost
[1:45:01] was fully come
[1:45:02] there came a sound from heaven like a
[1:45:04] rushing mighty wind and it filled the
[1:45:06] house where they were sitting
[1:45:07] and the power of god so enclosed those
[1:45:09] people and anointing them until they run
[1:45:10] out in the streets screaming dancing
[1:45:12] hollering acting like a bunch of drunk
[1:45:14] people that's
[1:45:16] the scripture that's just saith the lord
[1:45:20] that thus saith the lord that's how he
[1:45:23] comes
[1:45:24] that's how a stirring happens that's how
[1:45:26] he moves
[1:45:28] and yet some people just can't recognize
[1:45:30] it they can't recognize him
[1:45:33] he says what we need today is a stirring
[1:45:34] hallelujah god shook america with signs
[1:45:37] and wonders
[1:45:37] and you're without excuse the holy ghost
[1:45:40] has been preached
[1:45:41] the blind obscene the dead's been raised
[1:45:43] up thousands of prostitutes and
[1:45:44] drunkards have been brought to the
[1:45:46] kingdom of god
[1:45:46] shouting to victory that's right but
[1:45:49] america looks at it and calls it mental
[1:45:51] telepathy
[1:45:52] psychology are worked up
[1:45:55] i'm just asking you church not to be
[1:45:57] into one that that category
[1:45:59] don't look at it and call it something
[1:46:01] other than what it is
[1:46:02] the movement of the holy spirit don't
[1:46:05] look at it and say well they just worked
[1:46:06] them up
[1:46:07] they just did it look at it and say
[1:46:08] thank god you're moving thank god you're
[1:46:10] in our midst thank god you're pouring
[1:46:12] your spirit out lord i want to be next
[1:46:14] lord pour it out on me pour it out on me
[1:46:17] some of us get so caught up in the
[1:46:18] ceiling of the holy ghost and yes it is
[1:46:20] a sealer and if you have it you are
[1:46:22] sealed but you don't just get the holy
[1:46:24] ghost and sit back and go
[1:46:26] when you're coming lord that's not what
[1:46:28] it's all about but there is refreshing
[1:46:29] and there is real feelings and there are
[1:46:31] works to be done
[1:46:32] and he filled you so you could go out in
[1:46:34] his name healing the sick
[1:46:36] demonstrating the gifts laying your
[1:46:37] hands on the sick preaching the gospel
[1:46:39] showing that he is a living god and
[1:46:41] every present god and i am god and he's
[1:46:43] here today
[1:46:45] i'm glad he sealed you but so many of us
[1:46:48] are stuck on that first experience
[1:46:49] instead of coming today going lord i
[1:46:51] need an experience today and guess what
[1:46:53] i'm coming on wednesday saying i need an
[1:46:54] experience today that i'm coming sunday
[1:46:56] saying i need
[1:46:57] an experience today i'm looking every
[1:47:00] day for his presence because i don't
[1:47:02] want to miss
[1:47:03] my opportunity in his presence
[1:47:08] oh don't be that one that can't
[1:47:09] recognize him when he moves
[1:47:14] the eagle's stirring her nest
[1:47:17] the wind of the holy ghost is moving
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:21] if we just dare to set our wings into
[1:47:23] that wind this morning
[1:47:25] i believe we might catch it up current i
[1:47:27] believe that some people would just
[1:47:29] they've been earthbound so long they've
[1:47:30] been stuck in the chicken pins so long
[1:47:32] they forgot them wings work
[1:47:34] just start dusting them off a little bit

[1:47:40] to that wind see if you can't catch
[1:47:41] enough current
[1:47:42] see if you can catch an upcurrent to
[1:47:43] heavenly places where all things are
[1:47:45] possible well you forget about what
[1:47:47] other people are saying
[1:47:48] when you forget about what's going on in
[1:47:49] the world when you forget about politics
[1:47:51] and news and this
[1:47:52] and coveness and whatever name whatever
[1:47:54] it is that's been distracting you
[1:47:55] catching up current this morning

[1:49:52] that eagle he recognized it for what it
[1:49:54] was
[1:49:55] it was papa god it was papa god talking
[1:49:58] to him

[1:51:07] i got up on that fence post and i said
[1:51:10] my wings

[1:51:12] that chicken said never mind i didn't
[1:51:14] hear what he said i was gone
[1:51:15] i didn't hear what the chicken said no
[1:51:17] more i was in the heavenlies
[1:51:19] i would gather together with god's
[1:51:21] people in heavenly places
[1:51:22] i was worshipping i was praising because
[1:51:25] i
[1:51:26] recognized he was in the building
[1:51:32] hallelujah
[1:51:40] listen to a prophet
[1:51:44] he says we need another jump we got to
[1:51:47] the barnyard post
[1:51:48] but we need to get free so we can just
[1:51:51] ride on his wings for our first solo
[1:51:53] flight
[1:51:55] we just saw a brother take a solo flight
[1:51:57] he got off that post
[1:51:58] he took him a little flight this morning
[1:52:00] what a joy it will be
[1:52:02] when that great final day comes now this
[1:52:05] one right here
[1:52:06] this might be hard for some folks
[1:52:10] that those who know how to jump
[1:52:14] and flop their wings those who know how
[1:52:17] to do it someday he's going to come
[1:52:19] the great eagle of the sky will come in
[1:52:21] glory and we're going to spread forth
[1:52:22] his great
[1:52:23] he will spread forth his great power the
[1:52:25] holy spirit and those who are magnetized
[1:52:28] to it
[1:52:28] shall take a ride for eternity forever
[1:52:32] those who know how to jump those who
[1:52:34] know how to flap their wings
[1:52:36] those that are free in the spirit those
[1:52:38] who recognize his movement
[1:52:39] he's going to come over one day and it
[1:52:41] ain't just going to be a jump
[1:52:43] or a flock but the wind of the holy
[1:52:45] ghost i think i hear it now
[1:52:47] it sounds like a russian mighty wind if
[1:52:49] somebody would just set their wings to
[1:52:51] it
[1:52:51] all things are possible your healing's
[1:52:53] possible your deliverance is possible
[1:52:55] your freedom's possible
[1:52:57] set your wings in the spirit in the
[1:52:59] presence of almighty god
[1:53:02] hallelujah
[1:53:09] so we preach the supernatural
[1:53:12] back to why do we preach i just made it
[1:53:14] back why are you always preaching that
[1:53:16] that's why
[1:53:18] we preach the supernatural we preach the
[1:53:21] miraculous
[1:53:22] because where jesus is there will always
[1:53:25] be the supernatural
[1:53:30] satan always attacks it tries to bring
[1:53:32] doubt tries to get you to look to the
[1:53:33] carnal and person
[1:53:34] is there carnal impersonation absolutely
[1:53:37] janice and jamborees were there
[1:53:39] and so many people got caught up on the
[1:53:41] what janice and jamborees did you know i
[1:53:43] was just reading
[1:53:43] in jewish literature this week that only
[1:53:46] one out of five
[1:53:47] israelites left egypt in the exodus
[1:53:52] one out of five the others didn't
[1:53:54] recognize their need for a deliverance
[1:53:57] they didn't recognize the supernatural
[1:53:58] because they said she's emotional
[1:54:03] now that which is perfect has come we
[1:54:05] don't need
[1:54:07] i mean moses your gift ain't that
[1:54:08] special look these magicians just did it
[1:54:12] and they got caught up in those things
[1:54:14] and they missed
[1:54:15] their need for deliverance they were so
[1:54:18] comfortable where they were
[1:54:20] they stayed in their comfort zone
[1:54:25] but his children recognized
[1:54:29] his children recognized prophet god says
[1:54:32] many people are great lovers of god how
[1:54:34] many here's a lover of god i believe we
[1:54:36] all are
[1:54:37] great lovers of god raised up under the
[1:54:39] church they believe their church that's
[1:54:40] right they believe
[1:54:42] god but as far as the supernatural being
[1:54:46] operated in a human being today that's
[1:54:47] beyond anything they could ever swallow
[1:54:50] but that's where the truth is
[1:54:53] that's where the truth is that's the
[1:54:56] truth as god is my supreme judge
[1:54:58] that's where the truth lays i tell you
[1:55:01] i'm not criticizing the baptist baptist
[1:55:04] people fundamentally they know what
[1:55:05] they're talking about as long as it
[1:55:06] comes to the word but they know nothing
[1:55:08] about the supernatural
[1:55:10] and my brethren that's where they're
[1:55:11] missing the blessing
[1:55:15] you miss the blessing when you're not
[1:55:16] aware of the supernatural or you don't
[1:55:19] recognize
[1:55:20] and we begin to lose touch with that
[1:55:22] realm when the supernatural isn't
[1:55:23] preached
[1:55:24] when his presence isn't recognized we
[1:55:26] end up with dead people dead pews dead
[1:55:27] homes
[1:55:28] and a people destined to do nothing but
[1:55:30] perpetuate the ages
[1:55:32] but when a people begin to recognize oh
[1:55:34] he's here
[1:55:35] oh he's in the building oh my god is
[1:55:37] ever present then you start to see
[1:55:38] victories you start to see shout and you
[1:55:40] start to see dance and you start to see
[1:55:41] satan tore down you start to see people
[1:55:43] overcoming when they recognize who it is
[1:55:45] whose presence that they're in when
[1:55:47] they're conscious of it those are a
[1:55:48] people that's going to take a rapture
[1:55:50] they're not destined to perpetuate the
[1:55:51] ages they're not destined to go down
[1:55:53] they are the group that was seen going
[1:55:54] up they are the group that when he lives
[1:55:56] they will live with them because they've
[1:55:58] recognized whose presence
[1:56:00] they are in so we can't slumber church
[1:56:05] we can't go back to sleep we've been
[1:56:08] awakened
[1:56:08] sure a message awakened us but we've
[1:56:11] been awakened
[1:56:12] by the preaching of the word over and
[1:56:13] over and that message is still awakened
[1:56:15] us and his presence is still awakening
[1:56:17] us and we got to stay awake
[1:56:18] don't make the alarm clock keep going
[1:56:21] just get up
[1:56:22] he's here he's telling you to rise and
[1:56:23] shine he's telling you that light has
[1:56:25] come he's telling you that healing has
[1:56:26] come now salvation has come
[1:56:28] thy rapture has come he's telling you
[1:56:30] and we can't go back to sleep
[1:56:32] we got to keep expecting why did that
[1:56:33] outbreak happen in oklahoma last week
[1:56:37] because a group of young people gathered
[1:56:38] expecting it to happen
[1:56:40] they went knowing what was going on you
[1:56:42] should have heard them talking no they
[1:56:43] couldn't wait
[1:56:44] they knew god was going to move they
[1:56:45] knew they were going to be delivered
[1:56:46] they knew the gifts were going to be
[1:56:47] displayed they knew he was going to move
[1:56:48] in what happened
[1:56:49] he never disappoints he always shows up
[1:56:51] exactly where he's invited and he
[1:56:53] usually goes above and beyond what you
[1:56:55] even expect
[1:56:56] so they received one of the most
[1:56:57] greatest outpourings the most wonderful
[1:56:59] youth camps it was phenomenal
[1:57:00] i would watch it and just weep watching
[1:57:02] those people get delivered in the
[1:57:03] freedom
[1:57:04] in the spirit it was incredible how did
[1:57:06] it happen wednesday night
[1:57:09] look there was people that was supposed
[1:57:10] to be leaving going to oklahoma on
[1:57:11] wednesday
[1:57:12] for the wedding and they all decided i
[1:57:14] will wait and leave thursday
[1:57:15] because they knew something was going to
[1:57:16] happen there was expectations of what
[1:57:18] was going to take place
[1:57:19] and when we come with those expectations
[1:57:21] looking for his presence
[1:57:23] recognizing his presence then you don't
[1:57:26] miss it when those things take place
[1:57:28] you don't miss it when he begins to move
[1:57:30] you don't miss your blessing
[1:57:32] people came expecting god to move
[1:57:35] don't miss it when he moves look at
[1:57:38] blind bartimaeus
[1:57:39] we read about him at the beginning
[1:57:43] how is it that we can see so much that
[1:57:46] we can witness so much and yet miss him
[1:57:48] when he moves
[1:57:50] and yet blind bartimaeus sitting there
[1:57:53] prophet tells all about it how he had
[1:57:54] already made it past him and he thought
[1:57:56] oh no i missed him
[1:57:58] but then he thought if that's the son of
[1:58:00] david
[1:58:02] he'll hear me he'll hear me
[1:58:05] and so bartimaeus begins to crowd and it
[1:58:08] says
[1:58:08] he began to cry out and say jesus thou
[1:58:11] son of david
[1:58:12] have mercy on me and this is my favorite
[1:58:15] part of the whole thing if you know the
[1:58:17] truth
[1:58:17] and many charged him that she he should
[1:58:20] hold his peace
[1:58:21] but he cried out the more a great deal
[1:58:24] y'all just need to sit down up and even
[1:58:26] like tabernacle y'all getting too
[1:58:27] emotional at any like time
[1:58:29] you ain't seen nothing yet
[1:58:32] just try to sit me down just try to stop
[1:58:35] my praise
[1:58:36] just try to stop me from worshiping i'm
[1:58:38] gonna cry out all the more
[1:58:41] our son of david have mercy on me
[1:58:44] now son of david we need you we accept
[1:58:47] you
[1:58:48] we recognize you oh lord jesus
[1:58:51] move in our midst you get a little bit
[1:58:53] loud i can get louder
[1:58:56] move in this place today cry out all the
[1:59:00] more
[1:59:06] oh man what happened when he cried out
[1:59:09] he says jesus stood still
[1:59:13] oh somebody could stop him in his tracks
[1:59:15] this morning
[1:59:16] somebody just gave him to stop and they
[1:59:19] said be of good cheer
[1:59:21] he calleth you be a good cheer even like
[1:59:25] tabernacle
[1:59:26] not only is he here he's calling your
[1:59:27] name this morning not always here he's
[1:59:30] saying what do you have need of
[1:59:31] what wilt thou that i do unto thee i
[1:59:34] take it right now my lips not speak it
[1:59:36] lord this is what i need today this is
[1:59:38] what i need you to do
[1:59:39] i would take the opportunity in his
[1:59:41] presence to say lord
[1:59:42] this is what i need right now because he
[1:59:46] stopped for a moment
[1:59:47] he stopped from which way is he going to
[1:59:49] go to those that are calling out to him
[1:59:51] to those that are recognizing who he is
[1:59:53] he's stopping for just a moment
[1:59:56] oh how did the blind man recognize him
[1:59:59] others had seen the miracles others had
[2:00:01] witnessed what he's done
[2:00:03] and yet they were still critical in his
[2:00:04] presence
[2:00:09] mind reader sue sayer
[2:00:14] deceiver they're calling out but one in
[2:00:16] the midst of all that says
[2:00:18] son of david son of david
[2:00:22] all y'all are emotional just caught up
[2:00:24] in emotions
[2:00:26] somebody's gonna say oh son of david
[2:00:28] come by my way
[2:00:30] they were critical in his presence they
[2:00:33] wanted to quiet down the service a
[2:00:35] little bit
[2:00:38] they showed up every sunday every
[2:00:39] wednesday they knew the message
[2:00:42] they knew the prophecies they'd seen the
[2:00:44] miracles
[2:00:45] but they still weren't a fan of all that
[2:00:47] shouting
[2:00:48] they still weren't a fan of all that
[2:00:50] dancing they still questioned whether
[2:00:52] that was god or just an emotional girl
[2:00:54] caught up for just a minute
[2:00:56] they still chalked up that dancing and
[2:00:59] that praising to that personality well
[2:01:01] that's just her person
[2:01:02] let me ask you who's really blind
[2:01:07] who was the blind one there on that road
[2:01:09] it wasn't bartimaeus
[2:01:12] oh it wasn't bartimaeus he recognized he
[2:01:15] saw
[2:01:16] he recognized in that moment who's the
[2:01:17] blind one in a church service
[2:01:20] when he moves and he speaks and there's
[2:01:22] deliverance and there's joy who's the
[2:01:23] blind one
[2:01:25] who's the blind one sitting there the
[2:01:28] one who threw rotten vegetables at jesus
[2:01:31] called them beelzebub or the one who
[2:01:33] recognized he was passing by
[2:01:34] the one who recognized the lateness of
[2:01:36] the hour the one who recognized this
[2:01:39] might be my last chance
[2:01:41] can't you see who's passing by this
[2:01:43] moment can't you see who's in the
[2:01:45] building right now amongst us
[2:01:47] how many people throughout the bible
[2:01:48] were in jesus presence and yet never
[2:01:50] recognized it
[2:01:51] never or maybe they recognize it and yet
[2:01:53] never recognize their need of him
[2:01:56] look there's deliverance there's healing
[2:01:57] there's salvation there's victory
[2:01:59] there's everything you have need of in
[2:02:00] this building
[2:02:01] right now today but you got to recognize
[2:02:04] it's here
[2:02:04] and then you got to recognize you need
[2:02:06] it you can recognize it's here but if
[2:02:08] you don't recognize your need of it it's
[2:02:09] not going to do you any good
[2:02:12] you got to humble yourself to recognize
[2:02:14] your need
[2:02:15] look you can't just come to church
[2:02:16] fulfilling a duty this is what we do we
[2:02:18] go to church sunday we go to church
[2:02:20] wednesday
[2:02:21] because when it becomes a duty then you
[2:02:22] fail to see it as an opportunity
[2:02:25] you fail to see it as an opportunity i'm
[2:02:26] just going to be honest i don't wake up
[2:02:28] on monday morning
[2:02:29] and go i have an opportunity to go to
[2:02:31] work today
[2:02:34] maybe i should a good job's a blessing i
[2:02:36] get that but i'm just being honest
[2:02:39] but how many of us wake up on sunday
[2:02:40] morning feeling the same way we do about
[2:02:42] going to work on monday morning
[2:02:44] well we got to go to church today no you
[2:02:46] don't got to go to church today
[2:02:48] this is an opportunity this is an
[2:02:50] opportunity to be in the presence of the
[2:02:52] creator of all things the one who
[2:02:53] created your soul and died for you and
[2:02:55] heals the blind and
[2:02:56] heals your sickness and say this is an
[2:02:58] opportunity it can't become a duty it
[2:03:01] can't be all we got to
[2:03:02] because then you fail to come with
[2:03:04] proper expectations look i come to
[2:03:06] church expecting wonderful things i
[2:03:07] don't ever wake up and go to work and go
[2:03:09] this is going to be the best day
[2:03:10] ever but i do feel that way when i come
[2:03:13] to church
[2:03:14] because i know whose presence i'm
[2:03:15] visiting to walk into i know what
[2:03:18] is fits in the half and not what might
[2:03:20] happen what's fixing to happen
[2:03:22] because where he is the supernatural is
[2:03:24] present
[2:03:26] i'm not talking about believing he's
[2:03:28] present believing the supernatural when
[2:03:29] you actually see it
[2:03:31] i'm talking about coming to church with
[2:03:32] no doubt we're going to see
[2:03:34] god move today we're going to see god
[2:03:38] move today
[2:03:38] i'm talking about showing up on
[2:03:40] wednesday nights with the same
[2:03:41] expectation
[2:03:42] you show up at our easter meetings for
[2:03:44] show up wednesday night with the same
[2:03:46] expert i've heard a lot and i'm with you
[2:03:48] can't wait till easter can't wait till
[2:03:50] easter i can't wait till right now
[2:03:52] i can't wait for this moment right now
[2:03:54] cause he's here and then i can't wait
[2:03:56] for wednesday and i can't wait for
[2:03:57] sunday and i can't wait to gather with
[2:03:59] his people
[2:04:00] in his presence and then when i get to
[2:04:03] easter
[2:04:03] it's going to be amazing but it's
[2:04:05] amazing right now in his presence
[2:04:12] how do we come to church i come to
[2:04:13] church saying he's going to be there
[2:04:15] he's going to be there
[2:04:16] i get to worship him i get to praise him
[2:04:19] i have needs that will be met
[2:04:21] it's going to be wonderful today in his
[2:04:23] presence it's going to be amazing in his
[2:04:25] presence
[2:04:26] but when it's just our duty kids get
[2:04:29] ready
[2:04:30] if we leave now we can get there before
[2:04:32] the song service ends
[2:04:34] yeah i know harry
[2:04:38] it's a duty
[2:04:41] it's become a duty it's just become a
[2:04:43] religion
[2:04:45] we become so focused on our duty that we
[2:04:47] actually miss him
[2:04:50] brother branham talks about a courier
[2:04:51] that brought the message to jesus
[2:04:53] to tell him he was invited to the
[2:04:54] pharisees house
[2:04:56] he said that runner was just doing his
[2:04:58] duty it was nothing more to him
[2:05:01] it wasn't seen as an opportunity to him
[2:05:05] he came to service because he was told
[2:05:07] to
[2:05:08] he was in the very presence of jesus
[2:05:12] church he had an audience with the
[2:05:15] savior
[2:05:18] he says people are not conscious of it
[2:05:19] they see the scriptures exactly
[2:05:21] identified but they're not conscious of
[2:05:22] who it is
[2:05:23] they'll see something and say oh that
[2:05:25] was wonderful that was fine
[2:05:26] but you're not conscious of what it is
[2:05:29] if there was
[2:05:30] if if there would be a rep if you were
[2:05:33] there would be a repentance going on
[2:05:35] weeping and crying and we passed by many
[2:05:38] times and missed the opportunity by not
[2:05:40] being conscious
[2:05:42] i don't think the boy realized and he
[2:05:45] just throwed it off
[2:05:46] that wasn't nothing but just an ordinary
[2:05:49] message that he had to deliver
[2:05:51] he just sat there and he was in his
[2:05:53] presence and that was all it was to him
[2:05:55] it didn't mean nothing to him but if he
[2:05:57] had been conscious
[2:05:58] if that boy could rise from the dead
[2:06:00] today and said in this meeting this week
[2:06:02] he'd have done something about it he'd
[2:06:05] have a testimony that would have shook
[2:06:07] us all
[2:06:08] but he wasn't conscious so many times we
[2:06:10] don't do that
[2:06:11] we don't accept the opportunity this
[2:06:13] courier delivered the message and in the
[2:06:15] presence of the lord jesus
[2:06:16] and yet was just stupid enough if i must
[2:06:19] say it
[2:06:20] to turn away and think that he had done
[2:06:22] all that was necessary
[2:06:24] what an opportunity god gave that man
[2:06:27] that poor miserable man
[2:06:28] i wish i could have stood there i'd have
[2:06:30] fallen down at his feet the first thing
[2:06:32] before i said anything about what the
[2:06:34] cardinal wanted i just said lord jesus
[2:06:35] be merciful to me a sinner
[2:06:37] that had been the first thing in my life
[2:06:39] knowing that he was life
[2:06:40] and the only resource to god was through
[2:06:42] him
[2:06:43] oh i think that ought to be the sole
[2:06:45] duty of every man and woman that attends
[2:06:47] these meetings
[2:06:48] regardless of what somebody else said
[2:06:50] you've been brought into the presence of
[2:06:51] christ
[2:06:52] no matter how successful or unsuccessful
[2:06:55] no matter how great or how poor no
[2:06:56] matter what you
[2:06:57] are at the first opportunity fall at his
[2:07:00] feet and say
[2:07:01] lord be merciful to me this most
[2:07:04] miserable man
[2:07:05] how he would look at him this morning
[2:07:06] how we would look at him this morning if
[2:07:08] we could pull back the curtain
[2:07:09] and see that it was continually his
[2:07:12] attitude
[2:07:13] to turn from the presence of christ when
[2:07:15] he'd had the opportunity to stand by him
[2:07:17] what a miserable person that is yet
[2:07:19] today
[2:07:20] because he lives somewhere and it might
[2:07:23] be you
[2:07:24] and it might be i after this meeting
[2:07:28] it depends on our attitude when we're in
[2:07:30] his presence
[2:07:32] but he turned his back upon the lord and
[2:07:34] walked away
[2:07:35] feeling relief satisfied
[2:07:38] that he had done what he was told to do
[2:07:41] how many times did we leave from a
[2:07:42] sunday service feeling satisfied because
[2:07:44] we did what we were supposed to do
[2:07:46] leave from a wednesday night satisfied
[2:07:48] because we did what we were supposed to
[2:07:49] do
[2:07:50] and yet brother brown says if that boy
[2:07:52] could come back today
[2:07:54] what a different testimony he'd have how
[2:07:56] many times have we had the opportunity
[2:07:58] to have a different testimony
[2:07:59] how many times should we have cried out
[2:08:01] in his presence but it was just another
[2:08:03] day at church
[2:08:05] brother brown says friends i'm afraid
[2:08:06] you're not conscious of what's going on
[2:08:08] the very god of eternity the god who
[2:08:10] made the heavens and earth the god that
[2:08:11] was upon our lord jesus
[2:08:12] brought him from the dead anointed him
[2:08:14] and he went about doing good is here
[2:08:16] in this auditorium in jeffersonville
[2:08:18] indiana tonight he's here
[2:08:21] he says i'm afraid you're not conscious
[2:08:23] of it
[2:08:25] church we got to be conscious we must be
[2:08:27] aware of our need from him
[2:08:28] you must be conscious of your need for
[2:08:30] him that that wells up
[2:08:32] even now that you have to recognize your
[2:08:34] need because your
[2:08:35] recognition of your need is what will
[2:08:37] cause you to cry out as he passes by
[2:08:40] you're responding listen to this your
[2:08:42] response
[2:08:43] when his presence is in the building
[2:08:46] tells how much you
[2:08:47] think you need him
[2:08:51] your response when he is in the building
[2:08:55] shows how much you think you need him
[2:08:59] look you can know he's great you can
[2:09:01] know he's present but if you're
[2:09:02] comfortable sitting right where you're
[2:09:04] at
[2:09:04] you're going to watch as nothing more
[2:09:05] than a spectator as he moves through the
[2:09:07] building
[2:09:10] and if you recognize he's in the
[2:09:11] building and you don't cry out to him
[2:09:14] you identify yourself as a laodicean who
[2:09:17] says i don't have a need
[2:09:20] of you
[2:09:23] because you see him moving and you sit
[2:09:25] there and watch
[2:09:28] i don't have need of you today lord
[2:09:29] thank you for blessing them thank you
[2:09:31] for meeting them
[2:09:32] why aren't you crying out i guess i
[2:09:35] don't need nothing
[2:09:37] really in his presence
[2:09:42] i have need of nothing you must
[2:09:44] recognize your need we all have need of
[2:09:46] him
[2:09:47] on the best day i need him on the worst
[2:09:49] day i need him i need him every single
[2:09:51] day we all
[2:09:52] have need of him look the woman with the
[2:09:54] blood issue recognized she had need of
[2:09:55] him she had tried everything else
[2:09:57] she had spent her money she had been to
[2:09:59] physicians she was aware that no one
[2:10:01] else
[2:10:01] could help her she had tried everything
[2:10:03] but she came to church
[2:10:05] that day with the right attitude she
[2:10:07] came to church that day saying
[2:10:08] i'm going to touch him i'm going to
[2:10:11] recognize his presence
[2:10:13] it doesn't matter what anybody else does
[2:10:14] today i'm gonna touch him i don't care
[2:10:16] if you worship the day i'm gonna touch
[2:10:18] him i don't care if you worship i'm
[2:10:19] gonna touch him i don't care how the
[2:10:21] song service goes
[2:10:22] i'm gonna touch him i don't care if it's
[2:10:24] the worst special we ever had
[2:10:25] i'm gonna touch him i don't care if it's
[2:10:27] the best specials we've ever had i don't
[2:10:28] care if it's the worst sermon best
[2:10:30] sermon i'm going to church to touch the
[2:10:32] jesus
[2:10:33] christ i'm going to church to touch my
[2:10:35] savior i'm going to touch him
[2:10:37] everything told her not to do it
[2:10:39] circumstances told her not to do it they
[2:10:41] tried to constrain her but she didn't
[2:10:43] care
[2:10:44] she went with the attitude i must touch
[2:10:46] jesus
[2:10:47] i must recognize in his presence i
[2:10:49] recognize he's my healer and i've got to
[2:10:51] get to him
[2:10:52] that's got to be her attitude
[2:10:53] [Music]
[2:10:55] that's what the kids in oklahoma last
[2:10:56] week recognized
[2:10:58] they recognized they recognized what was
[2:11:00] going on they recognized the king of
[2:11:02] kings was in the building
[2:11:03] what was all that jumping shout and
[2:11:05] praise and they recognized
[2:11:06] their attitude was i must be set free i
[2:11:09] must be loose
[2:11:10] i must have him oh they were that blind
[2:11:13] bartimaeus
[2:11:15] they were the woman with the blood issue
[2:11:17] there was the woman at the well
[2:11:18] and they said thou son of david have
[2:11:21] mercy on me
[2:11:22] oh go ahead put him in the corner i know
[2:11:24] a group of young people that are
[2:11:25] worshipping
[2:11:26] go ahead and sit down on your hands i
[2:11:28] know a group of young people that ain't
[2:11:29] scared
[2:11:30] to praise the king of kings when he
[2:11:31] comes into a building they've been set
[2:11:33] free and they've recognized his presence
[2:11:36] and no matter what happens from this day
[2:11:37] forward you'll never be able to tell
[2:11:39] them that god's not real
[2:11:40] you'll never be able to tell them that
[2:11:41] the holy spirit don't move you'll never
[2:11:43] be able to take that away from them
[2:11:45] they experienced it for themselves
[2:11:55] well they're young brother aaron you
[2:11:58] know that's actually the hardest time to
[2:11:59] break out
[2:12:03] we put that on them as if that makes it
[2:12:05] easier for them to do
[2:12:06] oh well they're young people it's way
[2:12:08] harder as a young person than as an
[2:12:09] adult it's not even
[2:12:10] comparable
[2:12:14] there's never a time in your life when
[2:12:15] you're more self-conscious and more
[2:12:17] worried about what people think than
[2:12:18] when you're a young person
[2:12:20] but they didn't care they pushed through
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:23] it seems like maybe as young people
[2:12:25] they're a little bit less jaded
[2:12:27] than us adults their minds maybe have a
[2:12:30] little bit less skepticism
[2:12:32] maybe they've taken in less scars i
[2:12:34] don't know they seem to be less critical
[2:12:37] i know that some of the most critical
[2:12:39] people i've ever been around people has
[2:12:41] been around the longest
[2:12:44] so okay
[2:12:48] so busy picking everything apart
[2:12:51] so worried about how everybody else is
[2:12:52] living what everybody else is doing
[2:12:55] got no grace for nobody so quick to pick
[2:12:58] apart the ministry for every little flaw
[2:13:00] and every little failure or pick apart a
[2:13:02] young person just because they ain't
[2:13:03] doing everything to exact t like you
[2:13:05] think they ought to
[2:13:07] we'll see it was just the motion they
[2:13:09] stumbled they messed up it was just
[2:13:11] emotion
[2:13:13] if they really got something they
[2:13:14] wouldn't be doing that well look maybe
[2:13:16] they didn't get everything they needed
[2:13:18] but what happened was they recognized
[2:13:20] his presence and they weren't going to
[2:13:20] miss an opportunity to praise him they
[2:13:22] weren't going to miss an opportunity to
[2:13:23] shout they wouldn't
[2:13:23] miss an opportunity to cry out to him
[2:13:25] you said it's just a motion well a
[2:13:27] doctor told that to brother branham one
[2:13:28] time
[2:13:29] and he said billy don't you think them
[2:13:31] people them pentecostal people is just
[2:13:32] excited i said no sir i don't
[2:13:34] he said well what makes them that's just
[2:13:36] nervousness because they scream and
[2:13:37] holler and go on i said doctor
[2:13:39] you mean to tell me that the nerves can
[2:13:40] get excited without something to excite
[2:13:42] them
[2:13:43] you mean the nerves can get excited
[2:13:45] without something to excite them
[2:13:46] something has to excite them so what's
[2:13:48] there i said it's the unseen force of
[2:13:51] the holy ghost moving amongst us
[2:13:52] it excites that born-again spirit
[2:13:55] the unseen force of the holy ghost
[2:13:58] movement amongst us excites
[2:13:59] that unseen spirit
[2:14:03] he said it brings excitement and in that
[2:14:06] same moment while you're sitting there
[2:14:07] criticizing everybody and everything and
[2:14:09] wondering if that's even real or if she
[2:14:11] just got excited
[2:14:12] again he passed by you and you missed it
[2:14:15] in your moment of criticism you missed
[2:14:17] your opportunity
[2:14:18] and then you go home from church i don't
[2:14:20] even see what all the fuss was about i
[2:14:21] don't even like that kid anyway i don't
[2:14:22] think he's a very good example to our
[2:14:24] young people
[2:14:24] and now your family conversation is all
[2:14:26] about the failures of everybody else and
[2:14:27] you don't got to the point you don't
[2:14:28] recognize your need and what a
[2:14:29] visitation will do for your family
[2:14:31] and you are unconscious
[2:14:38] sorry
[2:14:40] get your eyes off of others and get them
[2:14:42] back on him
[2:14:45] get your eyes off of others and get them
[2:14:46] back on they are not your holy ghost
[2:14:49] they are not what's going to save you he
[2:14:50] is let them deal with them and you deal
[2:14:53] with you
[2:14:54] and me deal with me and we'll all
[2:14:58] pull together
[2:15:05] i believe that we who have been given so
[2:15:09] many opportunities will be held
[2:15:10] accountable for our attitude and church
[2:15:12] services
[2:15:14] our attitudes and his presence and our
[2:15:16] attitudes towards others who did
[2:15:18] recognize his presence
[2:15:22] recognize him this morning
[2:15:25] look i don't care if you've been
[2:15:26] critical he's here for you too
[2:15:29] i'm not putting you out i'm just saying

[2:15:33] time to wake up and realize he's here
[2:15:35] and when you realize he's here what
[2:15:36] everybody else is doing no longer
[2:15:37] matters to you
[2:15:38] when you realize he's here how
[2:15:40] everybody's acting no no longer matters
[2:15:42] to you

[2:15:49] having a hard time recognizing where is
[2:15:51] he get your eyes back on the promise
[2:15:53] get your eyes off the wind in the ways
[2:15:55] and you'll see he's right there at the
[2:15:56] front

[2:15:57] the charge he never left us he never
[2:15:59] forsook us he's been there all along and
[2:16:01] he's right there at the front with the
[2:16:02] sword drawn

[2:16:49] he's here and we must be conscious of it
[2:16:53] don't let this church go back into a
[2:16:55] stupor where we fear cancer
[2:16:57] don't let this church go back into a
[2:16:59] stupor where we're unaware of the
[2:17:00] supernatural
[2:17:01] remain conscious the world's trying to
[2:17:03] put you back to sleep and i'm saying
[2:17:05] remain conscious
[2:17:08] tries to make you forget how great your
[2:17:10] god is what was israel saying
[2:17:12] every time they came up against a new
[2:17:14] challenge they would fear it
[2:17:16] and forget the victories that was behind
[2:17:17] them they would forget that the pillar
[2:17:19] of fire was in the camp
[2:17:21] who cares what's right outside the camp
[2:17:23] he's going before us the pillar of fire
[2:17:26] is in the camp and they would deem their
[2:17:28] current situation
[2:17:29] greater than the god that was with them
[2:17:31] they would go back into a stupor they
[2:17:33] became more focused on the red sea than
[2:17:35] the pillar of fire
[2:17:36] more focused on the lack of food than on
[2:17:38] the pillar of fire more focused on the
[2:17:40] lack of water than on the pillar of fire
[2:17:42] and here we are we've become so aware of
[2:17:45] the problems more so than the solution
[2:17:47] more aware of evil than good more
[2:17:49] focused on politics than on the message
[2:17:52] have we forgotten that the pillar of
[2:17:54] fire
[2:17:55] is in the camp today church the pillar
[2:17:58] of fire

[2:20:11] walking in the supernatural
[2:20:13] realizing his presence receiving every
[2:20:15] opportunity
[2:20:16] that he has given you and being all that
[2:20:18] you can be
[2:20:19] it's about being refreshed each and
[2:20:22] every day for the battle
[2:20:23] having your need met in the services
