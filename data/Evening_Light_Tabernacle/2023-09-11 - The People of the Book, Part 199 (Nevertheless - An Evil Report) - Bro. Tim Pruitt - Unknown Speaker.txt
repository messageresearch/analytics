an Enoch who walks with you but a whole group of people That'll Walk off of this earth and the glory Lord we are looking not just for uh translating Faith but Resurrection faith with the dead in Christ shall rise and we're asking in the name of Jesus since you'll bless your people Lord that your brain oh God the lust to know you father you know God that those that are reaching out to you that

your stirring and you're moving on I pray in the name of Jesus you'll move o God but those that are going up for surgery are brother Philip got a need in his heart a real need I pray o God that you'll be with him in this time if you use doctors that's okay Lord we know you're the Healer but we know even before the doctor's hand touches him you can cause it all to come clear you're that kind of God you're the Creator we know Lord to believe in the miraculous because we've seen you move Lord we're asking father that you'd move again our brother Ron who you brought through many battles and today is feeling weak Lord I pray oh God May the weak say I'm strong May strength rise into that old Eagle until he flies into heaveness where all things are possible May today be the end of his sickness May today Lord be the miraculous come to him Lord we hear we hear of new treatments promised to Erica Parker Lord oh God we thank you for the promise of new treatments but our faith is an inductors our faith is in your word Lord and your word says I heal all diseases and today on the wings of this prayer we rebuke that sickness that cancer that has to bow to the to the feet of Jesus in the name of Jesus be repulsed not only that but there's others that are suffering in the need today right here in this building well God knows there are doctors are given a bad report but Lord we believe your reports We Believe Lord to buy your stripes we were healed oh who will believe our report who to whom but the arm of the Lord be revealed Lord it'll be to those who believe and we believe today we accept today healing we accept today deliverance we accept today a fresh new outpouring of the Holy Ghost we accept today the anointing of God to come down on every person Lord to speak to hearts and lives and sinners come and find their way to the cross Lord they come to know you may you just move father I ask in Jesus name we believe the half has not yet been told and we're looking Lord to you for more things because you promised it it's wonderful Lord the blessings that is in this lamb and we thank you for the lamb the land of the where the book is opened where the promises lay before us wherever one of them is mine I thank you for it Lord I asked father today you'll bless your people those across the lamb that are listening in that will hear it even later on in the week or months to come I pray that you'll minister to them and they realize there's a God working Among Us oh God may you just come to them today in a very personal way in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord today and and man we appreciated that Psalm that we just heard from the choir wasn't that wonderful amen that that that male voice that you heard is one of one of the ones that God just sent our way and this sojourning Among Us brother Matthew McFadden we want to welcome him today in the name of the Lord Jesus amen he's moved over toward hot springs and driving over this way so we're happy to have him in the house of the Lord this morning amen isn't it good to be a Christian Amen to be serving the lord in this generation to be a light in this time of darkness and I'll tell you how great a light that we have what a blessing that God has been pouring out upon us you know I I tell you you need to you need to get ready for your miracle I'll tell you God's moving you ought to be expecting you've got a prodigal that's away from home may not be a child may not be a son or daughter maybe a mother or dad but whoever it is God knows maybe a brother or sister but God knows and God's able he's moving amen he's calling is he lacks getting people ready you realize even the church not the bride the church has to be ready because when the Rapture takes place not to be another Gentile saved so you see when when we leave the Holy Spirit leaves the Earth with us or we leave with the Holy Spirit as it lifts and it's lifting you can see it lifting from the nation lifting from society lifting from homes lifting from churches you've lifting from everywhere and when it leaves we're going with it and I pray all the time Jesus said we should pray always to escape the things that are coming on the earth and to be accounted worthy to stand before the son of man and the son of man is the word stand before him and let him judge us amen because if we're judged now we won't be condemned with the world amen and we receive the Judgment of the word now and let him change our lives amen and accept his correction and move into the Realms of the spirit and the supernatural then we won't be left behind here he because the Rapture is a judgment I'll take one I'll leave one you know I that's a it's a judgment so we we must be ready for it and it's not the white Throne judgment no it's not the Wrath poured out no but it's it's the blessings of God as he as he judges and he looking he's looking for the token which is the Holy Ghost Amen brother Branham use the word token it differ differentiates away from just the the baptism on the realm of the spirit that the Azusa Street movement had is the token it's a literal life of Jesus Christ but I want you to understand it is the Holy Ghost amen and how we need him this morning amen we love you and we week thank you I appreciate your prayers as we was going away and we're going to be gone not this weekend but we'll be here this weekend coming up next Sunday but then going down up to Brother Kelly's in in Canada and ministering there so brother Timothy and I will be away uh two Sundays from from now and and uh we'll be sharing the word of God with them we love we love it when other ministers come well there's a prize comes with it we have to go too so you know um we appreciate our brother Kelly he'll be here for our October meetings coming up amen and we're looking forward to that I hope you're praying about it and calling on the name of the Lord amen to move upon hearts and lives and send those that are you know people are hungry people are hungry people are seeking God and and it's important in this hour because he says blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled amen amen God bless you if you'll turn with me to Book of Numbers chapter 13 verse 23 we're going to read from there this morning I'm going to be and you you'll find these words in my text as I read it this morning but I'm going to be speaking on nevertheless and then I put it in parentheses an evil report so you know here we are in a in a day an hour where we're at the brother Brandon calls this the Judgment seat of the world so every person comes to this place of acadishbarnia every church every age comes to a place of of um kadish barnia and we we are here in this time because it's a Rapture hour and we've got to decide whether we can take it our weather is not for us weather's too hard when it's too it's impossible but I tell you again we're headed for a tour de crescendo and every person is headed toward and and forced to a decision what you're going to do with this Jesus called Christ and so today as we read we we will find ourselves either on one side of the other and I I trust we'll be on the side of those who can say we're more than able amen God bless you Numbers chapter 13 verse 23 and they came unto the brook of Esco and cut down from them some Branch with one cluster of grapes and they buried between two upon the staff and they brought the pomegranates and of the figs and the place was called Brooke escall because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from this and they returned from searching the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses into Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of Quran to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the lamb and they told him and said we came unto the land whether thou sinnest us and surely it fluids with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the walls cities are walled in very great and moreover we saw the children of Enoch there and the malachites dwell in the land of the South and the hidites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb steeled the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for we are for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the Lamb which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the lamb through which we have gone to search it is a land that Edith up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great statue and there we saw the Giants the sons of Enoch which cometh the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so were we in their sight God bless you you can be seated amen my it's good to be gathered together this morning have such a tremendous thought laying my head of us and a great word that the Lord has prepared for us and good to have a lot of you back home that have been away I had to look out and see the lay families and ones that have been gone and away and different ones the stankies are here God bless you there's Santa there God bless you am I not streaming today you're listening and right here in alive amen good to have you live in the service amen so it's great to be in the house of God together this morning and I get we gathered in his name and when We Gather in his name there's good things going to happen God's God's going to do some great things we can look and just see it in in the promise of his word I just listening and just receiving a different um testimonies that have been going on around and just hear God moving in different places and you know there's a friend a friend of mine that I I just was known the family for many years it's the ball family and and they had um they had a couple of their young men that have come back to the Lord in just recent days that the Lord has done some great things for them and um you know one of them was was in a uh some type of a Waffle House or something like that that I don't remember exactly the location but just sitting there minding his own business living his own life doing his own thing and you know Wayward away from God and man came and joined him at the table and said said to him can I just sit with you for a moment and he really didn't want to he really didn't want his company and and he begrudgingly let him sit down and he began to talk to him and just said you know you're about to receive your last call God's dealing with you and spoke to him just a few moments and and there um as he got up and walked away and he said hey what's your name and he says my name is rich rich and Grace and he walks out and disappears so you know here we knew we you know he comes and and surrenders his life to the Lord was baptized in his name and and uh you know God's God's just Gathering them and then another young man the same way and you know God's just moving by his Spirit people being healed as the word Goes Forth as brother Donnie was ministered in his church um one of the and and he just mentioned that diabetes had to be subject to the name of the Lord and it was a there was a a brother sitting there that was suffering with with uh bad eyesight because of his diabetes so bad and he felt a cool feeling you know they they say it's not emotion but it doesn't seems like emotion comes with it I read what brother Branham talks about it many times the angel of God and sister Genie Camp was there and she knows when she walked in the presence of that angel that the angel of the Lord it was a warm sweet comfortable peaceful feeling so you know it does come with feeling don't think it don't amen you say Well it don't bring any sensation oh yeah there's a feeling that comes with it and other times when the Holy Spirit move over them and and feel that sickness go away as a cool feeling sweep over and well let's cool feeling swept over this man and his eyes and his eyes became clear and another man you know heard of the same testimony and he was streaming and while he was streaming there his heart was so bad that he could only get around on on a walker or cane and then as as he began to hear of the testimonies of God passing by and healing his faith reached out and claimed the promise of God he also felt that same cool Sweep come over him and when he when he did um you know his he he he he threw aside his Walker and his Cane and and he went back to the doctor and the doctor said man you're so good I don't need to see you for another year Hallelujah I know you believe that because we've been seeing God moved too amen but he's moving by the spirit all over the world and I'll tell you what wherever you are whether you're in this church this morning you're streaming or listening in it is the hour of Deliverance God is delivering his people and I believe that with all of my heart now Israel following the pillar of Fire had been brought up to this place called kadish barnia but here they would refuse now to follow it into the land of promise and for 40 days there's 12 Spies that searched out the lines and and the evidence was shown of its goodness and they come back with the cluster of grapes and it took two men to carry in and the pomegranates in the figs and the Bible said in verse 27 they told him and this is the first report if they just stopped right here if they would have just kept with this word we we come to the line wither thou send us to us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it if they could have just left off the nevertheless if they would have stayed with that that very word right there things would have been different they wouldn't have wandered around 40 years in the wilderness and I just say we ain't got 40 years to wander around because you see and we're not going to have 40 years because when this bride leads there's going to be only three and a half years left so as we look into this you know we you don't want to be left in the tribulation so if you ever believe this is our to believe if you ever prayed Lord help thou my unbelief this is a time to pray Lord help out my unbelief amen now for us the land is the Holy Ghost and is fullness it is exactly as God said this is this is exactly what they were saying on these this first part of the report it's exactly as what God Said it surely flows with milk and honey you know it is there here's the fruits of it here's the proof of the land and I wanted to say this land that we're in is not a physical line it's a land of an open book it's a land where the promises of God lay before us every one of them laying right there for you to possess this morning and he says and and I want to say it's exactly as God said there are provisions of Deliverance there is provision of experiences in the Holy Ghost there there is provisions of visions and spiritual dreams and prophecy and tongues and interpretation plus all the fruits of the spirit of love joy peace long-suffering gentleness meekness patience gentleness kindness all of these things lay there within there and then there are mystery truths that are ready to be discovered but these come up to the border of it and stopped refusing to take the land I just want to just remind you of what God has done in this generation I I just heard brother Matthew Watkins mentioned this and dear God help me that I don't ever preach as long as he does but nevertheless helped me to be mindful I'm saying that for his sake but he mentioned brother Perry green of whom that we had back in the the 80s that I that I actually had to come and give to our church um a testimony of things that he witnessed and seen and he shared with our church and brother Matthew mentioned this and as he did as he did mention it um you know it brought back to my memory again brother Perry's testimony and I just wanted to share it with you today as he mentioned this as a witness and eyewitness of what God has done in this generation I'm doing this to tell you of how good the land is and he said my family moved to Beaumont Texas in 1949 when my dad became pastor of the manual Gospel Church shortly therefore thereafter we learned that there was a man by the name of William Aaron Branham that was conducting Divine Healing meetings in Houston Texas which was less than a hundred miles away and he said you know since I he said that since I was nine years old I had quoted Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but I had no idea what it really meant I was 16 at the time that we went to Houston Texas and I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and had an experience of speaking in tongues and I'd read about Divine Healing um and rather ever miracle in the Bible and I believed them and yet he said I quoted since a child since nine years old Hebrews 13 8 the Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever but I had no idea what it really meant brother Branham was in the Sam Houston Coliseum on January the 23rd 1950 and we had arrived early enough that we were able to get a seat on the lower level right in front of the pulpit about 11 rows back as the service began the first speaker was brother Gordon Lindsay followed by FF Bosworth and then brother Branham came to the pulpit and as he looked across the the audience he said good evening friends it was so personal I I thought he was talking to me and I got up out of my seat and stood in front of the platform on the left hand side near the pulpit because I thought the man is spoken to me and when he had called for the prayer line about 15 people came forward and I found from where I was standing I could directly view the prayer line I never seen one before and I didn't know what to expect and the first person was a little seven-year-old boy that had been blind from birth and brother Branham took the boy by the hand and asked us to Bow our heads while he prayed for the child and as soon as the prayer was over the boy looked around like he could see and everybody began to praise the Lord and my thought was well how do I know the boy was blind and they held up by handkerchief and the little boy reached out and grabbed it they held out a microphone cord and he stepped over it and brother Bradman said now run back to your daddy and the boy turned and looked out at the audience of approximately 1100 people and he had never seen his dad and when the child had been called to the platform a man that came and stood next to me the man now called The Boy by name and the platform was about four feet high and the boy came to the edge of it and leaped off into the man's arms he played with the man's red necktie and then a saw the man's tears and and then he saw the man's tears and touched them and then he began to feel the man's face like a blind child would that was his dad then he threw his arms around his dad's neck and looked directly at me I knew I had seen a miracle it was the beginning of the chains of my life and there was a young lady that had been brought up had brought up a six-year-old boy that had been born with no feet brother Bradham took him in his arms and asked her to remove the stockings once more he asked us about our heads which I did but again I watched upward his brother Branham at brother Branham as he prayed I wasn't the only one watching because in the midst of the prayer it appeared that brother Branham dropped the little boy and many people in the audience gasp and right in front of my eyes I saw two little feet created and this affects me until this day when I see the little baby's feet it stirs something within my soul because of the Miracles that I saw so all I'm just doing is just bringing it out to you again today of the land and what lays in our land creative power creative power that can create new cells in a in a long and a lung that is filled with cancer have all brand new sales in it amen the power of God that can go out and rebuke an autoimmune disease or or that can heal a brain bleed or make a crippled child to walk we're talking about the power of the Living God we're talking about the goodness that lays in this land amen the treasures that are there the great Mysteries that have been revealed in the truths that have been given to us in this generation where that we can say we are now preaching what Paul preached well you know and of course these brother Adam called him at katisbanea borderline believers they walk up into the borderline and and then they taste of the goodness of the Holy Ghost and they see its fruits and refuse to go in okay there's all things that we could bring out on Hebrews 6 and maybe we will some today but I I want just to say today you know there there are many that are standing there at the border or maybe maybe they've got into the edge of it and I'm just saying there's more am I the it is wonderful that we have conquered Jericho and for us the seals are open the walled cities and you know Jericho was the entrance into the land and so to get the land open the walls had to come down first Amen to get the land open the seals had to be open the Mysteries had to be revealed and the book opened to us to open up ever promise that lay in there is somebody with me amen and I know that many will listen to me today and say but we're not borderline Believers we'll conquered Jericho and for us all the seals are open and this proves by the temp we're in this land of the Holy Ghost and I want to say that's true but you know when you rebuild the walls and make denominations out of your doctrines and still won't possess the rest of the land amen remember there is a curse with rebuilding the walls of Jericho you will layer that in your firstborn and your last child that's what he said you know your firstborn and your last child will die let me tell you friends this is this is what happens death comes into account and the young people suffer when we refuse to go into all the land and we won't just rally around the great mysteries of God and say we have the mystery truce yet we don't go in and discover everything that lays in our land now I wanted to say so many are fulfilling and and if you heard if you heard me preach when I was away at brother Ron's how many was either there or you was listening in let me see your hands probably about half of the congregation well I will reiterate some of the things that I even spoke there to the congregation today and for the audience that that is here but anyway again you know and for you that have heard it'll be a reminder for the rest of you it'll be something there that I want you to grasp today with all your heart but many are fulfilling that which is found in the first chapter of Judges where the word neither replaces the word nevertheless they're basically the same in his application in this way it's because so many are found there um that neither how they possess all of the promises but too many of us are content with living on the edge of the land possessing some of the promises but neglecting to possess all and allowing Canaanites to dwell in what belongs to believers the Bible would say in the Book of Judges neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants but the Canaanites would dwell in the land you see God gave you the land but he expects you to drive out your enemy he gave you Divine Healing but he expects you to take the word and with faith apply it and drive out your enemy he gave you the promise of the Holy Ghost but he expects you to repent and turn from your sins and with faith believe that the promise of God is for you you see if the enemy is kept down on your health the Covenant gives Provisions Isaiah 53 and others that says in the New Testament I would that you would prosper in health as your soul prospers you see The Church Must Have Divine Healing for they must have the Divine healer now listen for the resurrection because without it there will be no Resurrection now you know I I know when you preach things like this you can have all kinds of quotes thrown at you well you know like you just you can't you can't major on a minor let me just tell you Divine Healing is something that is needed all I am saying about this is in the land you say well it's minor I don't care if it's not a major town like Jericho but AI must be conquered amen there's other cities maybe Leicester city they all have to be conquered are you with me sir don't throw any don't you throw any quote and say well that's not a major it's just a minor listen if it's in the land it's important [Applause] I just say if you got the major you gotta have the minor you see brother random and let me quote him as I said if there's no Divine Healing there is no Redemption of the body you see it's part of the earnest money if there's no Divine Healing now there is no resurrection of the body Divine Healing is the earnest of our redeemed body did you ever think of that if there's no Divine Healing then when you go to the Grave that's all of it you'll be there forever in your dust to go away and there'll be no more of you then he says and it and Jesus lays the complete of Salvation the complete of Divine Healing I'll tell you what if it's in Jesus I want it you know one more thing I want to say for her for I go too far in this maybe Divine Healing is a minor but it's only a minor in comparison to Salvation amen what's more important what is the major is getting your soul saved but you see it's only a minor in comparison to that you see it's a very important part of the believer's victory amen it's it is a very important part listen brother Madden said that in Jesus lays a complete of Salvation the complete Divine Healing and let me just say if it's in Jesus I want it and let me back up again and say it might be minor to you but if you're sick this morning hey man if you got a death notice from the doctor this morning hey man if you got a need in your life or for your loved one come on if you don't even Carol Reagan and their daughter Erica hey man if you're wrong Spencer it's not minor it's major and I just say if you would have the right kind of feelings for your brother or your sister it would be a minor to you either it would be a major if there was freely some brotherly love and brotherly kindness and real concern for one another we lay on the altar of God and say God Amen pour out your blessings notice says in Jesus laser completes of Salvation the complete of Divine Healing if there's no Divine Healing now there's no resurrection of the Dead oh I'd like you to wait over that that's right we have the first fruits of our inheritance is that right the earnest of our salvation amen now if there's no Divine Healing and another quotation there is no Resurrection now you couldn't disprove that by the scripture see I'm arguing the points of Christ because we have the earnest of our Salvation which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that is the down payment the earnest which holds it secure in heaven for us and if there's no Divine Healing to make a cancer-ridden body come normal and well again there is no resurrection of the dead that's right we have no Earnest of it at all there's no been no plan made for it so I'm not just saying Divine Healing is a part of the earnest for the rapture now that doesn't mean now if you get sick and you die that you're not going to be resurrected or Rapture no that simply means it's the down payment money on a new body and when you see wage just like the one you see the change in a person and the desires of the world is gone the short skirts and the shorts and the cigarettes and the beer is all gone it's a sign of the working of the Holy Spirit amen now like brother Madam said and who is this Melchizedek like you women claiming you got the Holy Ghost going out here and you're wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as die it just can't be so certainly it can't be he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your home being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest or Quicken Hallelujah Made Alive and when the Bible says don't do this the body quickly turns to it there's no question and what did it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin admiring corruption but it now has got the earnest and it's turned Heavenly now is the earnest that you're going in the Rapture it's earned us a person laying dying nothing left but death that's all that can happen and I've seen of Shadows of people don't eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfect normal and strong if there's no Divine Healing there's no Resurrection because Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection you know what the earnest money used on you it's the down payment he was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we were healed man you see it's a double atonement it's not only for the soul it's for the body say well I've been saved in my soul and you don't look like it you still you still got the pain on and the lipstick and the short skirts and the shorts and whatever it's not showing amen are you with me amen so again you see it's a Redemption of the soul and the body but you notice in the Book of Judges it says in the amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain and would not allow them or suffer them to come down to the valley think of it hear hear God's enemies amen here these represent a type out demon powers that they they forced them into the mountains and would not let them come down in the valley you see you cannot bear fruits in the mountains it's down in the valleys where you bear the fruit so if you look at this for a moment hear the enemies that they were to drive out even though they had entered into the land I'm trying to give something to you you might say brother Tim I've got the Holy Ghost I've been filled with God's spirit I know the power of Christ and it changed me but I I'm trying to tell you friends that it's it's more than just that it's more than just that initial feeling of the Holy Ghost amen it's a continually living with crisis of refilling of his presence it's being that dude with power of among high again and again and again it's bringing you to a fresh and up to date experience not something you talk about in 50 years ago we conquered Jericho and the seals were open and bless God I got the mystery revealed what about the rest of it brother Branham would take Samson as a type and he says where he stood there blind and defeated and bound and typed it with the church today and he says I can almost point you to church like that helpless defeated and blind rejecting the promises rejecting the word a church that God promised would have power over sickness in my name they shall cast out Devils taking up a devil and casting him away in the blessings he promised to his church and because the church has turned from prayer meetings and from sincerity and made the religion of Christ a tradition and it's to it's and it's taken all that took all the strength out of it glamor has come in our churches and she stands defeated again in the message Messiah he told us you know Joshua was told that every place that the the soul of your feet shall tread upon that I've given to you you see footsteps mean possession and that's what I'm preaching to you today is Elijah Coast amen take another step move a little further amen conquer more in your life you're going to come to acadis barnia you're going to come to this season time where you're going to decide am I going to let amorites live here and keep me from bearing the fruits or am I going to take everything God said now he said as we enter the kingdom of God God's kingdom taken all the Philistines out the unbelievers and all the amorites and the malachites and whatever so it out of us like that we take possession amen I like that say days of Miracles are passed you have a right get out of me I put a footprint there I took over there's no such thing as seeing Vision get out of here you have malachite I'm coming over from there you're pressing out you see you're taking over that he said from that little that little light that is born of you when by the Holy Ghost about the size of a button it begins to push out and begins to take over every part of your being to bring it into faith you see he told it he told us again do you use these same principles all the way to the end of his ministry when he would come and that question answer 64 and say when Joshua entered the land of Canaan he said don't you let him live it's a cute baby little malachite or am I right kill it amen remember he'll grow up to be an amalekite he'll pollute the camp and when them little things come back like disagreeing with the word of God get rid of that thing I don't care what denomination it belongs to you say Well they're good I don't care how good a people they are if they're contrary to that word get that thing out of you it's growing a little a malachite it looks cute it looks innocent it looks all right but don't you have anything to do with it you stay away from it well brother Brandon might go down here well because I said Just remember any a malachite anything that denies the word stay away from it have nothing to do with it Hallelujah amen I you know I just want to say you know there's a lot of Gossip of unbelief today and it ain't all coming from denominations either amen you better tune your ears to the word of God and hear what the spirit is saying no again I just say to the message community at large where is faith where are workings of Miracles where is prophecy where is the word of knowledge where is Divine Healing where is the overcoming life power over pornography why why why is it that the Holy Ghost is lacking you know what instead you see instead of them going on into the promise and possessing everything that God said they made agreements or Leagues with them and allowed them to stay and instead of driving out and annihilating our enemy we bring in the gods of psychology we learn how and train people how to live with their Devils instead of old-fashioned prayer altars and prayer meetings and preachers who know how to cast out Devils they go back to Egypt pulling the knowledge of how to use psychology to help their flock you see it becomes Reformation instead of transformation Judges chapter 2 verse 1 I want you to read this with me you put it on the board if you will and here's what the angel the angel comes because of this neither and the angel Lord came up from gilgal to bochum and said I made you to go up out of Egypt and I brought you to the land which I swear to your fathers and I said I will never break my Covenant with you this this is really important for you to grasp this is a God that keeps his word come on and he says and ye shall make no league with inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but you have not obeyed my voice why have you done this wherefore I also said I will not drive them out before you but they shall be as thorns in your sights and their God shall be a snare unto you because you refuse to possess because you said you you said neither because it was said of you neither did neither would they allowed the enemy to live among them God said okay I won't drive them out I'll leave you to your own misery they will be thorns in your side and their gods will be a snare to you amen and their gods have become a snare because I hear pastors crying yeah as a senior pastor myself I hear from other pastors I can't get my people to come to church what do you do you know their heads are in gaming and movies or even pornographies they'll never mature they're always making wrong decisions I can't get the ladies to wear dresses that cover on their knees while standing in their city and get them to quit them wearing makeup or trimming their hair I can't get men to be real fathers and leaders in their home and there's no family altar they simply refuse to kill out the amalekites you see nevertheless is the word we're using today nevertheless is the same as but God is good but the power of God is real but the Holy Ghost is true but you see these become words and I'm going to show you in the Bible there are words that come and twist the word of God they see it they Proclaim it they say it's right it's a good land yes it's there but we can't do it and it's because of a minority it's an intellectual anointing to intellectualize and to dress up and sophisticate the gospel you see the spies had searched the lamb for 40 days now they're unbelief would cause them to wonder for 40 years I want you to think of that a day of unbelief can give you a year of unfruitfulness but why did this happen it happened because Tim's spies heard and then they began to see hear and see through the lens and ears of an intellectual demonic anointing two different Spirits anointing to people I'm gonna prove it to you look at Numbers Chapter 14 and verse 24. but my servant Caleb he had another spirit with him so I want you to know if he had another Spirit then his Spirit was different from theirs he had a different anointing he had a different spirit that these other believers who were saying we can't take it somebody help me preach now amen because my servant Caleb he had another spirit and he had followed me fully him will I bring in the land where he and he went and his seat shall possess it I don't know about you but that's where I want to be identified this morning I want to be identified with a Caleb Hallelujah think about it for a moment here to be identified with the Caleb brother Brandon said Caleb and Joshua represents the True Believers that stayed with Moses I'm represented right there that's my representation that's a word that speaks of me somebody help me preach amen two Spirits one's the anointing of the Holy Ghost and it anointed Hallelujah it anointed their eyes the eyes of men like Joshua and Caleb not to even they made no mention of giants they made no mention of Walled cities they made no mention all of any kind of obstacle that laid in front of them come on somebody oh they saw was the fruits all they saw is my Godly healer my God to deliver my God's a savior my God to reveal us but the other spirit will come right down and start twisting what they saw and what they heard foreign and if you're not careful you can sit in a church service just like this and while the anointed word is going forth an intellectual demons sit right there on your ear and twist everything that has been said unto the anointing amen wow brother Tim every time you hear every time I hear you preach about Judas hop to Judas every time you preach about Cain I'm the king why do you want to identify yourself there come on Amen that you see but Satan will anoint that ear placing doubt you know yeah Judas went all the way and Judas had Miracles and Judas had signs and Judas believed in Judas was justified Judas who Sanctified but he didn't know yeah and you know that's going to be me brother Tim I just can't make it I just can't it just won't work for me it just ain't for me this word isn't for me let me tell you God didn't bring you to this point he didn't give you this opportunity amen and you turn around and say it's not for me no sir he gave you this opportunity he lets you hear the word of God where you can decide it's for me amount it's my promise it's my word it's my Deliverance amen the Holy Ghost is mine the power over sin is mine the power of the Holy Ghost to heal the sick is mine you got to hear what the spirit says just make sure what you're hearing is the word not something not a word Twisted by a demon because he will come and twist it Tim spies saw and hurt to the eyes and the ears of a demonic anointing this demon will take you out of church he will kill your children with death the 10 came under anointing of the of an evil spirit and said we can't take it you see they were still controlled by slavery in their minds they weren't conquerors they saw themselves as poor helpless slaves instead of God's Own beloved Sons they saw themselves as defeated as that has happened years of history and generations of failure of 400 years of failure and being in slavery that's how they viewed themselves they were because of an anointing began to anoint their seeking to seek as a slave instead of a mighty conqueror [Applause] no you see they were still controlled by their slave owners that slave owner that would whip them and say you can never do this you'll never be anything you will never overcome this you will never rise up above it that would beat them down and keep them in bondage and say you're worthless you your mama was a slave your daddy was a slave your granddaddy was a savior great-granddaddy was a slave you will always be a slave you can never break the cycle I'm going to tell you friend don't you listen to that hallelujah amen God has come down and said you're my children and because you are Sons Hallelujah I'm bringing you into the Abduction of sons I want you to realize your sonship and who you'll be allowed to [Applause] you see if you don't get rid of the slave mentality it'll just keep beating your down you'll only live in defeat you're not a Slave your name isn't defeat your name isn't not worthy I'm not good enough unable to poor amen you know to follow I'm too inferior I'm unworthy quit saying you're unworthy you're not unworthy he said his black to make you worthy how can you deny what he done for you I gotta be beat down all the time and that's humility that ain't you melody that slave mentality get rid of the slave mentality and clear I am what he made me have a son I am a daughter I am the child God responsible for me I refuse to be identified with failure some people sometimes say about me oh brother Tim's handicapped the only place people are handicapped in their brain when you begin to realize and you get you get to think of yourself as handicapped I'm able you can't do it you got to have a can-do mentality I can do all things through Christ oh brother Tim you could have a handicap license plate I don't want I don't need one I can walk I park on the back side of Walmart I don't look for the closest place hey man why because God's healed me that may have been what I was but that's not what I am oh yeah I was there for nine days and a doctor in a hospital and the doctor looking every day and it's hard going like this and saying and then he looked at and said Son don't you ever thank me for anything service I did I was there I saw what happened he said my heart would go Twitter Peter every time I looked at your foot well I had to cut it open the cast and make room for swelling said Son you are a miracle God did that God brought you through that hey man don't you ever thank me and go back and tell that church to pray for you again because God's going to bring you through the black devil want to put some complex on you I don't have one I refuse to have a complex [Applause] say well brother Tim blame yourself your feet it's pretty bad the blemish of your sin is worse the blemish of your unbelief is worse listen don't take anybody's name they try to put on you they want to label you as a defeat or reject a no good they want to try to take you and and and and make you feel unable and adequate that's the devil's work don't you listen to anything that that the devil has to say about you well I I'm unworthy don't you ever confess that I'm worthy to his blood amen you say well I don't feel much like a Christian you know don't say that you you say I am what he said I am he gave his life for me I said I'd be anything less people are labeled you all kinds of things people with cancer that man with cancer that woman with cancer you come identified with that thing don't don't take that label amen don't take that label amen that person that person with this this Affliction that that person with this habit you know don't be identified with that refuse it yeah you know that the other day I was studying and and I was just listening to the Bible I'll just give you a little hint I like I like Reese's Chronological Bible and you know it's uh it's read and dramatized form on on um on YouTube and I go through the Bible listening to that it's King James dramatize that has different voices and different ones when the man speaks a woman speaks nice and I'm I'm listening to all of the genealogies you know the genealogy of the so-and-so begat so and so and so and so beget so and so and and I you know and you know and I'm thinking that I could care less who began who you know I I don't know who they are and what they are and whatever I finally glad it finally got to Jesus because I'd reckon recognize that but all of these began who began who began who in the middle of that begotten who if mentioned a man by the name of Jabez and Jay Bells was named Sorrow by his mother amen she named him such looking for Scranton Chronicles four and nine and you can mark it in your Bible some of you need to hear this amen some of you said well I must not be very worth very much my father abandoned me when I was a child you know my mother left the home did this happened there I I I you know bad things happen to me that has nothing to do with who you are [Applause] amen well I'm from I'm from a a deprived race or I'm I'm this I bet forget it I don't care what you've been named listen the book of Joseph the Bible comes here and all of a sudden breaks with all the begets and it mentions a man by the name of Jabez and Jabez was more honorable than his brethren now what made him more honorable it wasn't because what his mother called him his mother said he called him sorrow because I bear him with sorrow you know people I name you a lot of different names the devil will try to hang all kinds of things on you but don't you accept it jabels did not accept it amen he had that name but look what he did with it verse 10 and if she was called on the name of God the god of Israel's saying oh that thou would bless me indeed and enlarge my coach I want to be more than subtle I want to be more than defeat I want to be greater than trials and troubles and bad luck and depression that is not who I am I'm going to enlarge my coach so that that hand will be with me oh Hallelujah and that that was keep me from the evil that that is not greed me my mother named me something evil but keep me from it God amen keep me from it enlarge my Coast amen bless me indeed let your hand be on me hallelujah how can you feel with the hand of God on you how can you not be a successful when he has all saved your life and called you through this message bless me enlarge my Coast this curse that my mother tried to put upon me and called me sorrow let your hand be with me keep me from this evil sorrow that it may not grieve me I reject the name of Sorrow and I wanted to say today You Oughta you said bless them nothing but trouble follows me so you don't you say God enlarge my Coast let me look into the Bible that said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me off the days of my life and I will dwell in the presence of God forever [Applause] trouble and bad luck doesn't follow me no but rather goodness and mercy follows me all the days of my life I am blessed I'm healthy I'm well I'm rich amen I'm full of God's favor amen I miss Mercy I miss love I'm already years whatever God is that's who I am because that's my father forget what my mother called me forget the baguettes forget the begets and the regrets forget them all and say oh god I've been begotten a new I got a new genealogy Hallelujah amen and almighty God through Jesus Christ beget Tim Pruitt and he enlarges his coast and calls on the name of the Lord and he is a success he is blessed he is rich in favor and rich in Grace and an overcomer and no weapon this form begins and can prosper because he's a mighty conqueror like his father Hallelujah but this devil will try to come on you where you can't sing with anointing where you can't rejoice in Victory you'll only sing the songs of your bondage and your sorrows you know he'll even anoint preachers gifted men where the anointed word of the prophet of God will be twisted in the intellect until they won't even believe in altar calls anymore our prayer lines they don't know faith no workings of Miracles nothing it is and just let me just tell you I'm not trying to condemn anybody I'm just saying you can have this too amen trying to slap you down and say it's not for you I'm saying you can you know it's there it's in the line it's yours you can have this you know there's many that are peep right into our services and they're embarrassed by what goes on you I just saying you can have it too you can have the joy of the Lord you can have dancing in the spirit you can have speaking in tongues you can have every gift God has you can have every promise you can have the Mysteries you can have the blessings of God you can have it all [Applause] is for all his children it's not just for evening in my Tabernacle but listen I can't help it the politics of your church won't allow you to enjoy your religion brother Branham recognized the need for his church he said in 1959 speaking in Clarksville he said I see some of the Tabernacles folks here I'm going to say this about the big sisters one thing the Tabernacle needs up there at our church at Jeffersonville the Tabernacle at Jeff is a rededication and a refilling of the Holy Ghost everyone get down to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost and the whole church be filled with the power of God that's what we need not only the Tabernacle here but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling that means even in light Tabernacle amen I like I like David said one day restore to me the joy of my salvation now he had not lost his salvation but the joy of it and when it comes to places I can't enjoy my religion my salvation there's something wrong somewhere because it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory one of them said taste and see the Lord is good it tastes like Honey in the Rock oh I'm so glad I tasted that the Lord is good and I love honey but I've never tasted any like that that's the best that I know yeah as he was approaching the Holy Ghost series for his own church in 59. he's he was there in San Jose and he had this to say we're to leave for home right away I've got a three-day meeting there and my little church teaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues signs and wonders to follow the Believers and so forth of the people that's around in there I believe in all the spiritual gifts I believe in all the Bible I'm Pentecost from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet inside outside all around through through I am Pentecostal amen I'm just saying you can have this revival for your church it's for the bride it is an exclusive for us amen so someone is safe you know I you know we we're having a false Revival because they believe the Revival is over but if you just take a thorough study of the subject that's all our house be a student you know you know search out the land you know that don't don't just take one little quote or a little something or something said about the amorites and jebusites and try to apply it to the bride come on a man so he said in the message he said uh and the Escape hither come quickly he said now we're speaking on Babylon and the handwriting the wall and we're here today we can almost feel the hot wings of judgment blowing in our face the world has come to an end there's not a hope for the world outside of the coming of the Lord Jesus that's the only hope you can put an Eisenhower in every country County and America will still Wade in sin I'm not looking for any great Revival the thing of it is the Revival has come and gone and you didn't know it it's always been that you you look for something that's Satan kept saying there'll be greater over here and greater over here in his past right by you did not John the Baptist come on the earth and even the righteous did not recognize him did not Delight disciples say when will Elijah come and he says already come and you didn't know it the Revival is just about over don't look for nothing greater we've already got the greatest thing in heaven the Holy Spirit manifests in himself in this generation there's nothing else it can be done because why anything else is going to be more of the Holy Ghost it won't be out of the land of the Holy Ghost are you with me amen now again he said and I'm just bringing these out because he says now in the in Shreveport and an invisible Union and it is one of his last sermons now we're looking forward to the coming of the Lord in our generation I'm not looking for Revival in our generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation I want you to know once more the coming of the Lord is our Revival it's not just a healing Revival amen it's the coming of the lord it's the mighty Angel descending amen it's the power of the almighty and the same sermon now I want to give you the other side that's one side of it now let me let me go into the same sermon a little later on down he said some of you people that really believe this is the truth that we're entered into another age we're entering the Rapture age you know the church can't go in his condition and it can't get any better it must get worse how many knows that Say Amen well it's got worse it's got to get worse and it can't go on like this it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's on the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's that's saith the Lord so the Revival's over for the church the Revival's over for the nation you can put good men in every County it'll never turn it back you can go take over your school boards and it won't turn it back you can go around and be elected as in the Senate and it won't bring it back you can get somebody else in the presidency and it won't bring it back amen you're not going to revive America you're not going to revive the world but you can revive the bride the move is on for the bride that's that's saith the Lord amen amen [Music] so you see many will point to America's rejection of the Holy Spirit the Pentecostal move that rejected the word as a premise for the argument you know that that that's just a false Revival but I just want to say I just want to say yeah there's a false Revival but that means there has to be a true Revival you can't have a counterfeit unless you have a real but brother Benham tells us every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age and I just want to say we don't deny any word we have to hold every mystery truth amen we believe the seals are open that Partners have sounded their voices we believe in predestination eternal security serpent sea every bit of it all of it from Genesis to revelation so we're not word deniers so we can have Revival this message is our Revival Amen brother Brandon would come up in the third ceiling he said the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been the Revival no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet we'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again I'll tell you what when the message came and the Thunders uttered their voices and it opened up the Seven Seals and gave you an Open Bible somebody with me amen it started causing a Revival right then the reason why this church exists is because of that Revival hallelujah amen and so you see the voices of Thunders revealed the mystery it calls the Revival and we have had the mechanics amen but now the Dynamics is falling on the word that we have heard Hallelujah amen oh someone will say well brother Tim is just all blowed out of the whistle well you got to have fire in the Box you didn't have to whistle amen and if you ain't got enough fire to to blow out the whistle you ain't got no fire in your box amen you've got dead ashes of a pastoral Bible tells us and hear you him he says placing of a son he said take him out have us in a certain place have a ceremony before Angels placing positionally what he is in the body then that person has the authority let me say this if you call me a fanatic from this night on the very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put in the church and now it's coming in that the Holy Spirit was so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen Powers like coming into the church now I know it for a fact amen say to this mountain don't that be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said the placing of the church in position with the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes and where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critics Mouse will be shut it'll be a short time Jesus came right off the mountain went straight to Calgary it won't last long but it'll be here thank you it'll be here amen it's here we're in it it's happening amen you don't have to wait for some squeeze if you look around you're already being squeezed you don't have to wait for more persecution hey man if you look around and you realize you wake up a little bit you realize you're being persecuted are you with me amen you don't have to wait on nothing it's here the move is out speak to this mountain brother Brandon said I believe the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus and Nazareth to a human being ask anything you will it shall be given to you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled or it's going to come to pass pretty soon I'm looking forward to happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen now that that anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and shall raised her feet like a mighty marching Army the sick will be healed by word the blind will see the death will hear the dead will be raised up in the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now I believe it's soon coming to pass I will believe it will be exactly that way I believe it's going to strike the Church of God soon it's going to start a Revival that'll shake the world and we have it this is it so well that was before the seals we'll try the indictment then after the seals May there come forth a Revival of the justice and a great power come among the church just before it's going it's not hard to pray that because you promised it and we're looking for it Lord that third pool that we know will do great thing in our midst but you know what the problem is they don't want it they don't want it it's like when Jesus went across the sea because he had heard the cry of one man who came to a a man who was a mental case who was a maniac living among the tombs and he came to his senses and nothing and one day just to say God help me and he went back into his insanity but you know what God happened to be on earth you say brothers she was so today he's here he's on Earth how is he here his holy spirit is right here where is it not in Bradford Hallelujah there he was way across the sea nobody could have heard it but he did you think God don't hear your cry listen if he'll hear the Cry of an unsafe maniac there happened to be a seed of God he'll hear the Privacy to God that's already saved amen all you have to do is just breathe it out God help me God help me amen oh he will come all the way across the seas he'll come right down to your place he'll send an angel right to your table and say time's up boy get ready give me the young man going to his office and say son it's your offer it's your time right now and the whole family comes to Christ is somebody with me amen he knows how to get his own he ain't gonna leave our hook behind he's not going to leave you where you're at that's why he calls time at the time after time at the time because God ain't content but you just haven't landed the Devils dwell on that become thorns in your side he hears a cry of this maniac somebody with me and as he hears the cry they come across he here he goes and he says I got to go to the other side boys and he gets in the boat well the devil heard it too so he gets in the Wind I don't care what the devil does he can't stop when Jesus is on his way Hallelujah he's on his way this morning he's coming to your house he's coming to your tomb he's coming to your son he's coming to your daughter he's coming to your need [Applause] they ain't enough to be left of the enemy that can stop Jesus when he's on his way Hallelujah he's on his way he's right here and even like Tabernacle this morning he's coming to your room Wherever You Are Hallelujah glory to God in the highest he'll come all the way from Glory he'll pour out his holy spirit he'll have known to preacher for one sermon to touch your heart to turn you back to believe in again to raise your faith to tell you he's a Bible Jesus a Bible God with a Bible promise and the Bible days are right here because we are here living it out the devil may be in the storm but God's in your boat [Applause] yeah come on now oh I wish he would speak he's going to use your voice your Mountain has to hear your voice your storm has to hear your voice this word may provisions to speak to the storm and it go back he goes out there this one man hears us cry he hears his cry this one man goes across the sea he'll leave all of Heaven for one he'll leave the 99 for one he'll come right down to you in your need for you and here he comes and of course you know what he does there's a bunch of hog razors there are so happy with their Hogs and their Hogs and their living and the riches and the riches from their Hogs and the slop that they've eaten they're so happy with the hallways and the slop pins Devils all around they don't want no devil cast out might cost him something might cost them their prestige might cost them their riches it might it might make them embarrassed are you with me amen you know what brother brother Branham said brother Branham said they had their Hogs and and I'm just going to paraphrase some of the things that he said about it he said they have their Hawks they're slopped pens and they felt more comfortable with devils that they did with Jesus because when Jesus casts out them Devils they went into the Hawks and the Hogs you know what I'm going to say committed suicide yeah say it brother else suicide that's how you call a Hobbs they committed suicide and here here that you know that lost all their Hogs you know you might you might lose your prestige when the devil gets cast out of you come on when the devil leaves your your country when it leaves the church a man that might be crying that might be sounding there might be dad said you might lose your prestige but I tell you I'd Rather Have Jesus in a bunch of homes and live in the presence of devils he said they felt more comfortable than they did when Jesus was there so they told him leave leave we don't want you here it's costing us too much why you go to a big formal church today and let two or three people get in there and go to praising God and shouting going on like that maybe someone give a message in tongues and somebody get healed by the power of God or give a vision why they just freeze them to death well I don't want nothing like that better at home with the Devils that's right than to have the lovely Jesus around You Preach to them like that and they just sit like a wart on a pickle just a sour and cold as they can be nobody would say Amen or nothing just freeze up and freeze down he said I wish you would quit while he he's been up there 15 minutes now how long in 15 minutes Matt Watkins amen and when is he going to stop you see you see he said I can see the legion after he comes to his right mind he's got healed I could see after he keeps waving to Jesus the devil them peoples come down and said we don't want you around here we want the Hogs we'd rather have our Hawks we don't want no more or no such Revival is that all this here nonsense Divine Healing we know the days of Miracles has passed that's man's only worked out now get out of our land we don't want none of that Holy Roller stuff started over here he said Jesus won't stay don't worry where he's not welcome he won't stay you know I'm shouting rejoicing speaking in tongues you don't want the movement of the spirit in your church he won't stay you can kick him out he'll be the unwelcome Christ you can be just like laodicea and reject him amen oh you know so let's get into our topic verse 31 but the people but the men said the men that went up with him said we're not able to go up against these people for they are stronger than us we can't do it our young people can't overcome in this age the Holy Ghost can't keep them not Church you think I'm making this up but I've heard preachers in the Pulpit say the Holy Ghost we got today just can't it's not it's not powerful enough to make you live right and I'm sitting there and I say who wants that then I don't want that kind of Holy Ghost Holy Ghost I believe in seals you to the day of redemption seal Satan out seals you in amen oh well our people can't overcome in this age the Holy Ghost can't keep them but they can't Rise Above This field it's too hard I tell you what we'll just do we'll give them some psychology to help them cope we will give them some sessions to learn how to control their sexual habits so they try Reformation instead of transformation because there's a big difference between reform and somebody and transforming somebody transforming power comes by the power of the Holy Ghost Reformation comes by men conforming you to what they want you to be so you see in their hearts they went back to Egypt and when they went back in their hearts they begin to remember the flesh pots that was there you see when we believe and we just give a mental asset Ascent to the message and we believe that's the Holy Ghost and porn then is too strong for us and we can't help but be lukewarm and you see we we got church order here and we we ain't got no power against sickness because healing was only for the messenger and that word isn't in season anymore you see this is what the Bible said in verse 32 and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched the lamb through which they we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and we saw Giants and the sons of anak which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight I want you to notice they have a different sight because we are anointed with a different spirit and so he said and we were grasshoppers in their sight now numbers 14 1 and the call the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would the god that we that died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in this Wilderness wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey worry it not better for us to return into Egypt and they said to one another let us make a captain and let us return unto Egypt now returning to Egypt means look God was our captain Captain is a leader and the pillar of fire had led them there and the pillar of fire had directed them to this place and the pillar of fire had given them that line and here Joshua just when Caleb are going in there led by a pillar of Fire but these men but these men reject God's leadership without the leadership of God they could have never left Egyptian bondage amen have to receiving the law Mount Sinai these people they willingly affirmed all that God has spoken we will do we will be obedient and here he said go take the land and they said we can't we don't want God's leadership no more we'll just go back to Egypt make us captain make us another leader we want another leader than God and in this crisis listening to the voice of reason and under demonic anointing they hurriedly rejected God's leadership that they said let us appoint a leader in return to Egypt they had a leader and God was her leader and they didn't like it but they didn't like it where he was leading them to them they would only go so far I wonder today after 60 years of mechanics of laying the word on top of word dissecting it like Israel did receiving the law and we understand today by God's grace having a perfect interpretation of the word of God we understand predestination eternal security baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and we walk right up to the Border of the fullness of the spirit why why do we want to go back to Egypt again I want to just get it to you I want you to realize look in their minds no longer was Egypt the enemy the enemy was now God Moses Joshua and Caleb or anyone that says we can have the Holy Ghost in his power you see they just dismissed that as a motion we can't cast out Devils we don't have the stomach to face Giants so we don't want prayer lines we can't speak with new tongues we can't have prophecy the Holy Ghost we want is just to say we believe the message we don't want it we want it without feeling we can't have an experience that's the way we got it in Egypt brother Adam said in Paul Moore I'm Locus and caterpillar he said there's no place in the Bible where they ever receive the Holy Ghost without having emotion speaking with tongues and shouting and praisins of God and prophecies and manifestations they never just did walk up and shake hands with the preacher and walk away he says in the message thirst I'll give you one and at the end of his ministry he said wait until that satisfaction comes that satisfaction portion of the fullness of the Holy Ghost comes in then the joy bells are shouting speaking in tongues dancing in the spirit will come you won't have to do it in by the music you will do it when you're going down the road in your car you will do it when you're sweeping the floor you will do it when you're driving the nails in the wall with your carpenter work wherever you are that joy unspeakable and full of Glory amount he talks about it in the future home what a mighty message that is how that the heavens and earth will pass away and it'll change forms and he's and he equates it until he said you know when a man receives a baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that just wait until the Earth gets her baptism you know I have I have preachers that tell me and this is no lie brother Tim you only quote statements that fits your narrative I just want to say that's what Jesus did hello I only quote things that fits my narrative that's what Jesus did when Jesus was baptized baptized on the River Jordan but John he was endued with power having been filled with the Holy Ghost how many knows that's the truth and after fasting 40 days he was tempted to use his power and he was hungry and Satan tempted them to use his power for himself and make stones into bread you remember that and Jesus told Satan it is written he gave him a quote amen and he said here's my quote and it fits my narrative man shall not live by bread alone by every word Hallelujah I want to ask you every word do you mean the seals yes everywhere do you believe the Thunder yes everywhere do you believe predestination everywhere do you believe Holiness Everywhere You Believe in gifts Everywhere You Believe in speaking at times every word man shall not live by bread alone bye so Satan Jesus told Satan it is written man shall live by every word of God so Satan said you want you like quotes do you I have a few mom I can use it I can pull it right out of the out of the quote book too I'm doing my little message search and I'll find something that disproves what you just said you know here it is because so Satan uses the word but he uses the wrong motive and he threw a quote back at Jesus now I just want to say Satan is stupid if he thinks he can defeat Jesus with a quote try this try this your narrative let me just say to you you can't hurt me with quotes I love quotes amen every one of them I love them all come on I love what he said about the horror but I Don't Preach that's for me I I love what he said about the Lake of Fire and Satan being cast into it but that's not for me so I when I preach about heaven and what and what is for me I don't have to preach about hell so you're only been in your narrative yeah that's my narrative Heaven Is Mine amen amen again Jesus has said man shall live by shall not live by bread alone but by every word wow so he told us a quote and Jesus said but that quote don't fit my narrative you know what a narrative is story your story so that quote don't fit my story hello you see it was being applied incorrectly Jesus would not live the word that was quoted by the devil amen he knew that Satan mislocated and misplaced the word and once it's misplaced it is no long no longer the word of God is a true of the devil to bring defeat so Satan tried to use the word with the wrong motive and the first thing that the devil tried to do of course is what he's trying to do is get him to doubt what had happened in the River Jordan that he was the son of God in other words to doubt his experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that it happened on the River Jordan and he says cast thyself down here's the word cast thyself down leads him up to the temple cast yourself down don't you know the angels will bear you up lest you Dash your foot against a stone it is written and it was the word it was the quote and it's a good quote we can preach that quote today it's the word of God but it's got to be applied right [Applause] and the devil was misapplying the quote come on Amen to get him to fit his narrative cast ourselves down for it is written I'm quoting this let me just tell you friends yes it fits my narrative that there is a real Holy Ghost it fits my story that there is Divine Healing it bits my story that there's a shot of the king in our midst it fits my story that young people and old people alike can worship God in Freedom that fits my story amen so don't throw some quote at me that's meant for denominations that rejected the word or word rejecters and they want to shout and reject the word that's not us we believe our the word try to apply something like that to us that doesn't matter that is not our story our story is we believe the message we believe in production of Truth we believe the word that's our story preachers get embarrassed to hear there was shouting and dancing in the spirit they're ashamed of being in Pentecost well brother Branham had some words for you just before he left we noticed today if someone says are you a Christian this is from ashamed 1965. in Jeffersonville we noticed today why am I qualifying that you know because here's what goes if it's before the seal well that was before the seals that we don't we don't believe that somebody else we have qualifiers on which one we accept and which one we don't preaching that to denominational group and he was just speaking their language so you see that's their narrative so I'm going to say this fits it's in Jeffersonville it's in 1965. it's just before you departs from this Earth one of his last sermons that he preaches and he said it's a popular thing to say I'm a Christian but do you believe the word of God which said these signs have followed them that believe oh even ministers faces will blush Are you ashamed to say of Divine Healing Are you ashamed of the Full Gospel Are you ashamed of your Pentecostal experience that's being ashamed of his word that's his word made flesh in you oh what if this little boy said he and you say he's my son and he says who may be your son what would you do what do you think I am it would embarrass me it would you if it were your son and that's the way he lives with so-called Christianity today if you name the the denomination all right they accept the fatherhood denomination but when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word Christ no they're embarrassed they don't want they don't want to say yes I have spoke with tongues yes I have seen Vision yes I believe in Divine Healing yes I praise the Lord I'm free from our all organization I'm not bowing down to any of that I am a servant of Christ oh my that just tear them to pieces then he goes on to say but let me say this a man who has once come in contact with God which is the word and the word has been made plain and manifested to him there is no shameness about that you're not embarrassed it doesn't embarrass me to say I believe every word of God it doesn't embarrass me when the Lord has anything to say anything you go and say it and do it it don't embarrass me to say I've been filled with the Holy Ghost it don't embarrass me to say I've spoke with other tongues it don't embarrass me to say that our Lord is showing me Vision it don't embarrass me to say he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed are you with me I'm not ashamed of this land I don't see any Giants in it that are significant every time that I see is insignificant they are bread to us every obstacle I see we can overcome it every enemy Hallelujah he has made me the triumph over every enemy I found every Every Mountain a mountain that the Giants are camping on I'm going to take that mountain I say like Caitlyn did give me that mountain are you with me stand on your feet another Matt Watkins and I have a little funny thing going on between us he made a statement about he Don't Preach as long as me I thought it was funny I hope he thinks this is funny today let me just say we preached Maybe like I said in Virginia now or none of your business but God knows what your need is and he knows what our narrative is I can read every quote brother Brandon said about emotion and I can rejoice in everything that he said against and far because I believe it all and I believe we're walking in the land and brother when I get a hold of these grapes and taste his goodness it makes me want to shout it wants me to claim this is God this is what about this is a truth this is mine when I see the results hallelujah or you can have all the arguments you want you can debate the message all you want but I see the results seek transformation I see the Dynamics of the holy spirit that changes lives and transforms people well brother Tim I personally I think y'all get a little bit too noisy well let me give you a quote that fits my narrative was the Pentecostal Church a noisy church back at the beginning when the Holy Ghost first fell the Virgin Mary likes she was drunk staggered under the power of God and all of them like that and the people said they're full of new wine that's the way the church was ordained that's the way that every church was ordained every time God has a church it'll be the same kind of church because it ain't got no uncertain sound well our Bishop says I don't care what the bishop said is what the word says The Bishop's got an uncertain sound if his sound is sounding the same thing that this is he's right and then if the church don't act like it did like that he's wrong if you've got say you've got it and didn't act like that then there's something wrong with you because that's exactly what he said everyone amen that fits my narrative my story is I've been in the land and I've been walking through it my story is there is healing that will cause cancers to go [Music] my story is it'll drive out fear my story is it'll take a man that was laying there and that the doctor said was Brave dead and it was going to harvest his organs and raise him up again to preach the gospel and that's 15 years ago and yes I'm talking about Ron Spencer that's my narrative and my story is as I walk through this land Hallelujah it'll transform young people [Applause] fill it with the Holy Ghost he'll give him a joy in the heart that the world can't give but the world can't take it away that's my story Hallelujah my story is it is not emotion but it will make you emotional that's my story pull him new chairs out uh what am I doing I'm exposing the power pull it out just a minute right they'd see that plug it's got power in it is an unseen Force listen you can go to talk about it thinking about it you think about it too much you scream just thinking about it you know how to hurt if you've ever been touched hey man you know since somebody somebody the other day they saw their their girlfriend get blessed by the Holy Spirit and Shout you know what they did they shouted too you think that's wrong no I'd Rejoice too amen I Rejoice seeing somebody else rejoice maybe I didn't feel anything but they did I'm just glad they did I'm just glad to see the blessing now I can put a club in there I can vacuum the floor I can run a cell I can do all kinds of powerful things with the power that's in there but I'll tell you what if I unscrew that thing and it gets its protective cover off and I touch it just right I'm going to feel it and when I feel it I'm going to shout there's going to be a lot of emotion I might cry I might jump I might shout I might say whoa amen and I'll tell you what if you ever get a hold of this power Hallelujah over the power hallelujah amen another Museum electricity we're talking about this is the Holy Ghost we're talking about amen now it all hurt you but it'll hurt sin and unbelief it'll hurt doubt it'll run it right out of the building it'll cause Devils to flee there's a power in this world it ain't emotion it's power but when you get touched by it it causes emotion oh amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you
