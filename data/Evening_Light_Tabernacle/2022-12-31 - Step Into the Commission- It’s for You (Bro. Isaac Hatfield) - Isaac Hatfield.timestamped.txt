[47:49] troubles and our trials
[47:51] amen it's certainly good to be in the
[47:53] house of the Lord tonight and we count
[47:56] it in honor and a privilege and
[47:58] certainly appreciate the opportunity our
[48:00] brother Tim and brother Aaron put
[48:02] together and it's not something that we
[48:04] take lightly brother Tim is a hero of
[48:07] ours and this message and and we
[48:09] certainly counted a great honor and
[48:11] privilege to stand behind this pulpit
[48:13] and bring greetings from Brother Ray
[48:15] Erickson and truer Tabernacle there in
[48:18] Bluffton Ohio and brother Wayne who you
[48:20] all know and love very well and
[48:22] certainly
[48:23] bring greetings and thankful to have my
[48:26] wife Bethany Hatfield with me I got in
[48:30] trouble the other day we were married
[48:31] for a while and I introduced her as
[48:33] Bethany Lawson and I'm still getting
[48:35] used to it but definitely great to have
[48:38] her with us and brother Ronnie and
[48:40] brother Nathan just an honor to stand
[48:42] with those soldiers of God so
[48:45] if you turn in your Bibles with me
[48:47] tonight to Joshua chapter one I know
[48:52] many of you may not know me
[48:54] at all and most of you don't know me as
[48:57] a minister but I just believe the same
[49:00] message that you do and brother Brandon
[49:03] talks about being seated together in
[49:05] Heavenly places he says what is that
[49:07] Heavenly places he says it's coolness
[49:09] it's Comfort it's feeling at home that's
[49:12] what brother Brandon said about Heavenly
[49:13] places and we definitely feel at home
[49:15] tonight
[49:16] and so we just thank the Lord
[49:19] and we want to read out of the Book of
[49:21] Joshua chapter 1. and then we're going
[49:23] to read a book of Psalms Joshua 1 verses
[49:27] 1 to 9. familiar passage Moses my
[49:32] servant is dead now therefore arise and
[49:34] go over this Jordan now and all this

[49:41] every place that the soul of your foot
[49:43] shall tread upon that have had given

[50:03] was with Moses so I will be with thee I
[50:06] will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[50:09] strong and of a good courage For unto
[50:11] this people Thou shalt divide for an
[50:13] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[50:16] their fathers to give them only be thou
[50:17] strong and very courageous that thou
[50:19] mayest observe to do according to all
[50:21] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[50:24] the etern not from it to the right hand
[50:26] or to the left that thou mayest Prosper
[50:29] whether so ever thou goest this book of
[50:31] the law shall not depart out of thy

[50:43] success have not I commanded thee be

[52:04] we pray
[52:06] you may have your seeds we want to take
[52:08] a step into the commission and we want
[52:10] to read a quote to open it says now
[52:12] Joshua the new Warrior only two left now
[52:15] that ever left the promised land that
[52:17] was Joshua and Caleb now Joshua the new
[52:20] Commander to lead an army to step into
[52:22] the place where a great man like Moses
[52:24] stood it was no little task and he said
[52:27] I think of a minister today that's
[52:29] called of God to step into the tracks
[52:31] where Jesus stood what a command what a
[52:34] commission but he didn't leave it just
[52:36] as ministers He said Each that's called
[52:37] of God is commissioned to stand in the
[52:40] same place I'll be with you even in you
[52:43] to the end of the way you see you're
[52:44] stepping tonight into more than just the
[52:46] tracks of Tim Pruitt or Timothy Pruitt
[52:49] standing behind this Pulpit but stepping
[52:51] into the tracks of Jesus stepping into
[52:53] the tracks where Jesus stood under a
[52:55] commission to stay with the word to stay
[52:57] with the message but it's not just for
[52:59] me it's not the commission doesn't just
[53:00] apply to preachers but each of you
[53:02] that's called of God is commissioned to
[53:04] step into those same traps acts where
[53:06] Jesus stood but thank God he's not
[53:09] leaving it up to our ability but he said
[53:10] Joshua your commissioned to step into
[53:12] the tracks of Moses but I'm not just
[53:14] going to send you without any ability uh
[53:17] I'm going to send you with a deity with
[53:18] a power as I was with Moses who I will
[53:21] be with you I'm going to follow you I'm
[53:22] going to lead you into this battle I'm
[53:24] going to make the way clear before you
[53:26] I'm not leaving it up to your ability
[53:28] how he spoke to Moses and said Moses I'm
[53:31] going to come down and deliver my people
[53:33] they've been in bondage for 400 years
[53:35] I'm going to come down and I'm going to
[53:37] do a mighty work I'm going to bring them
[53:39] out of Egypt and I've heard the cries of
[53:41] my people and then he says come here
[53:42] Moses I'm going to send you to do it he
[53:45] said I have come down to deliver but I
[53:47] am sending you Moses to do the work you
[53:49] see both times that Moses did it it was
[53:52] the Flesh of Moses but brother Brown
[53:54] said one time Moses did it and one time
[53:56] God did it because when Moses went and
[53:58] tried to do it in his own ability he
[54:00] failed because it wasn't it was Moses's
[54:02] ability but the second time it was God
[54:05] working through Moses freeing to pass
[54:07] what he had planned to do all along he
[54:09] said I'm looking to fulfill my word
[54:11] Moses but I'm going to send you he said
[54:14] I'm going to make my word come to pass
[54:15] I'm ready to fulfill my promise but I
[54:18] need somebody to do it through you see
[54:20] he's not looking for Ability he's
[54:22] looking for prisoners someone that he
[54:24] can send the same way that He sent Jesus
[54:26] he said as I have as my father has sent
[54:29] me so send I you said how did he send
[54:31] him the one that sinned and went with
[54:32] them and went in I mean he said the one
[54:34] that sent you goes with you and in you
[54:37] to perform the very works that Jesus did
[54:39] he said I'm going to send you the same
[54:40] way I was sent I'm going to go in you
[54:43] and I'm going to go with you to fulfill
[54:44] the work you see the world has missed it
[54:47] by a thousand miles God can only work
[54:49] through Perfection so he couldn't work
[54:51] through the church the modern church
[54:53] because he couldn't stain himself in
[54:54] that way said I can only work through
[54:56] Perfection so I'm going to die for your
[54:58] sins and send back a Perfection on the
[55:00] day of Pentecost that I could work
[55:02] through a lowly humble people that I
[55:04] could fulfill my word through flesh and
[55:07] brother Brandon said that's where the
[55:08] secret lays that's where the world's
[55:10] missed it they failed to see that God
[55:12] put perfection in human flesh that he
[55:14] could work through it to fulfill his
[55:16] Commission in a bride body they're
[55:18] looking for a 60-foot Jesus to come out
[55:20] of the sky but he's picked up young men
[55:22] and young woman out of Louisiana to
[55:24] fulfill his commission he said I placed
[55:26] in you a Perfection that I can work
[55:28] through you there is where the secret
[55:30] lays although but he said you must have
[55:32] leadership to step right the Rich Young
[55:35] Ruler come to the end of the road and he
[55:37] said where do I step there's nowhere to
[55:39] put my step because he refused the
[55:40] leadership of God and chose the
[55:43] leadership of a church of a natural
[55:45] church but he said Moses when he come to
[55:47] the end of his Road he said he looked
[55:49] over and there was his leader The Rock
[55:50] and he stepped out onto the Rock and
[55:52] Angels took him away and said when the
[55:54] pyramids are gone when Egypt is gone
[55:56] Moses will still be immortal amongst men
[55:59] because he chose the leadership of God
[56:01] over the leadership of man and over the
[56:03] leadership of his church you must have
[56:05] leadership ship and that doesn't just
[56:07] apply to Moses but any man that's called
[56:09] will stay with the leadership of that
[56:11] word will walk in the rhythm of the word
[56:14] amen see we're not just commissioned to
[56:16] lay our hands on the sick but we're
[56:18] commissioned to stay with the word
[56:19] because many he said will come unto me
[56:21] in that day and say have not I cast out
[56:23] demons in your hands had not I done all
[56:25] this in your hands and they'll say
[56:26] depart from me you workers of iniquity I
[56:29] never even knew you because they didn't
[56:30] follow the leadership when they stepped
[56:32] into the commission but to his disciples
[56:35] his elect group he said you're going to
[56:37] do these things but before you go go up
[56:39] to Jerusalem and be endued with a power
[56:42] from on high I'm going to commission you
[56:44] but you got to follow the leadership and
[56:46] first you must go to Pentecost and
[56:48] receive a power that will be with you in
[56:50] that commission he said no man has a
[56:52] right to call himself a Christian or a
[56:54] preacher without that seal of the
[56:55] commission the confirmation that God is
[56:57] with you that God is leading you said
[56:59] stay until you see any man can go down
[57:02] to the 10 cent store and pick up a
[57:04] uniform in a badge and then the man can
[57:06] go and go go get a uniform he said
[57:08] that's not your identification but you
[57:10] must have the papers the seal the
[57:13] confirmation that God has sent you and
[57:15] then you'll have the confirmation the
[57:17] signs will follow you that believe
[57:19] he said stay until and then I'll write a
[57:22] book of Acts behind you and it won't be
[57:24] the Acts of the Apostles but it will be
[57:26] the acts of the Holy Spirit and the
[57:28] apostles because you followed leadership
[57:30] and God put a power in you to fulfill
[57:32] what he called you to do you see the
[57:34] question is if it's real the question
[57:37] isn't If the message is real the
[57:38] question isn't if the Rapture is real is
[57:41] is it for me that's the question that
[57:43] the devil will fight you with not if
[57:44] it's real but if it's for you you see we
[57:47] all know there's a commission we all
[57:49] know Mark 16 is still in action we all
[57:51] know the days of Miracles are still an
[57:52] accident brother Brandon said if the
[57:54] days of Miracles are passed the days of
[57:56] God are past and he said the Great
[57:58] Commission is just as much in force
[58:00] today as it was when it fell from the
[58:03] lips of Jesus Christ is that I can show
[58:05] you where the apostolic age began he
[58:07] said you show me where it ended we know
[58:09] that Pentecost began without an ending
[58:11] we know that is still we know that it's
[58:13] still just as much in force today as it
[58:16] was in the book of Acts but the question
[58:19] is is it for you is it for you he said
[58:22] but you're going to have to go and
[58:24] you're going to have to get the seal
[58:25] you're going to have to get the token
[58:27] and then you'll know it's for you say
[58:29] how do I know the tokens for me he said
[58:31] the promises to you and to your children
[58:33] is those that are far off even as the
[58:35] many as the Lord Our God shall call he
[58:38] said blessed are they that hunger and
[58:39] thirst after righteousness he said you
[58:41] would have been blessed just to hunger
[58:43] you that have a hunger tonight you that
[58:45] have a thirst you're blessed just to
[58:47] hunger and thirst but he said he didn't
[58:49] leave it there he said for they shall be
[58:52] filled that there's a tug on the inside
[58:54] of your heart that not just a hunger but
[58:56] it said You shall be filled like Rahab
[58:59] in the days of Joshua she said I've
[59:00] heard of this anointed Army in this
[59:03] Street walking State isn't enough for me
[59:05] this prostitute State isn't enough for
[59:07] me but she said I've heard of this Army
[59:09] and there's something in me tugging to
[59:11] go and meet this anointing that'll
[59:13] change my life and brother Branham said
[59:15] that that you applied the token it's for
[59:17] you if you fill in your heart there's
[59:19] something hugging it's for you you apply
[59:21] the token you see it's not about your
[59:23] goodness it's not about your ability but
[59:26] God's election in your life is what's
[59:27] pulling you to that new birth that's
[59:29] what's calling you to that it's not your
[59:31] ability it's God's goodness and election
[59:33] that's calling you to that you see if
[59:35] you have a hunger of God Brethren said
[59:37] the hunger of God in your soul it will
[59:40] go back to Pentecost to the beginning
[59:42] and find the real holy ghost that sets
[59:44] the heart of fire true hunger won't lead
[59:46] you to church joining to hunger won't
[59:49] lead you just to God's end of prophet
[59:50] true hunger will lead you to Pentecost
[59:52] and receive a satisfaction that
[59:54] satisfies the very desire of your soul
[59:57] that's where true hunger will lead you
[59:59] it will lead you to a reality that will
[1:00:01] change your life and make you a new
[1:00:02] creature in Christ Jesus hallelujah it's
[1:00:05] the Deep calling to the Deep you might
[1:00:07] not even have a scripture for it you
[1:00:10] might have not even come you might not
[1:00:11] have been born into this message you
[1:00:13] might have been born in denomination you
[1:00:15] didn't you didn't even know what this
[1:00:16] message was
[1:00:17] you didn't have no scriptures for it you
[1:00:20] didn't even you couldn't explain it you
[1:00:22] didn't know what it was but there was
[1:00:23] something in you hungering for something
[1:00:25] more it's the Deep calling to the Deep
[1:00:27] even if you don't have a scripture
[1:00:28] brother Brown said it's that creative
[1:00:30] power that's in The Believer that's
[1:00:32] strong you even if you didn't know
[1:00:34] anything about Divine Healing you know
[1:00:36] it's true even if you can't find it in
[1:00:38] the Bible because he said it's to create
[1:00:39] a power drawing you to it if there is he
[1:00:42] made the Earth for the tree there's
[1:00:44] something in you if there's a deep
[1:00:45] calling there must be a deed to respond
[1:00:47] even if you can't explain it you see
[1:00:50] coming into the house of God tonight
[1:00:52] it's not just a it's not a workup it's
[1:00:55] not an emotion brother Brandon said
[1:00:56] there's something about inspiration when
[1:00:58] it strikes there's something about
[1:00:59] inspiration when it strikes what you're
[1:01:01] longing for and when you strike that and
[1:01:04] tears begin to roll down your eyes while
[1:01:05] the minister is preaching he said what
[1:01:07] is it it's the feeding of the Holy
[1:01:09] Spirit to the flock when inspiration
[1:01:11] strikes he said the doctor came to me
[1:01:13] and said now you're just getting them
[1:01:14] excited he said Doctor you know you know
[1:01:17] better than that if you go out into a if
[1:01:19] you go into an alley it takes something
[1:01:21] to bring a scare it takes something to
[1:01:23] bring a fear you see a shadow or you
[1:01:25] hear a noise in that but spring is
[1:01:27] scared but he said in this case when you
[1:01:29] don't see anything and it's an
[1:01:31] excitement not exactly an excitement but
[1:01:33] a glorious feeling that raises the
[1:01:35] people up he said like I heard the
[1:01:37] little ladies a while ago singing the
[1:01:39] hymn the people were saying praise the
[1:01:41] Lord what does that it's a give way to
[1:01:44] an emotional emotion that's inside of
[1:01:46] you may I say it like this as David said
[1:01:48] when the Deep call is to the Deep at the
[1:01:51] noise of thy water spouts it's not a
[1:01:53] workup it's the Deep calling to the Deep
[1:01:55] one time brother Brandon was out in the
[1:01:57] wilderness and he was just rejoicing at
[1:01:59] the god that created the trees and the
[1:02:01] god that created the animals and it said
[1:02:03] he began to dance around that tree and
[1:02:05] he began to Rejoice he said they would
[1:02:07] have thought that Salvation Army was out
[1:02:09] there he said you can call it emotions
[1:02:11] but to me it was the Deep calling to the
[1:02:13] Deep something in you crying out to
[1:02:16] worship the Creator that you came from
[1:02:18] it's not an emotion it's not a custom
[1:02:20] it's not just coming to church to prove
[1:02:22] to your neighbor that you still have the
[1:02:23] victory it's something inside of you
[1:02:25] pulling you to the house of God to
[1:02:27] worship the Creator that formed you in
[1:02:30] your mother's womb before the foundation
[1:02:31] of the world oh don't just let the devil
[1:02:34] lie to you that this is just a is just a
[1:02:36] gathering it's something deeper than
[1:02:38] that inside of you drawing you to a
[1:02:40] reality
[1:02:42] Hallelujah
[1:02:44] what do you do brother man said
[1:02:46] the thing to do is when you come into
[1:02:48] service and you begin to feel that
[1:02:51] unbelief creep over the devil try to
[1:02:53] draw you down and you'll begin to pull
[1:02:55] back from the service and he said if
[1:02:57] that devil can put a question mark on
[1:02:58] your mind he's got you right there but
[1:03:00] he said what do you do he said you say
[1:03:02] you erase that question mark and say
[1:03:04] that's every bit true and it's for me
[1:03:06] then you're pulling from God why don't
[1:03:09] you turn to your neighbor right now and
[1:03:10] say it's for me it's for me and now
[1:03:12] you're starting to pull from God you see
[1:03:14] you say maybe it's not for me because I
[1:03:16] tried to I tried to pray for the Holy
[1:03:18] Ghost many times I've asked for healing
[1:03:19] many times but that doesn't mean it's
[1:03:21] not for you the thing to do is to press
[1:03:23] through that because that's the devil
[1:03:24] trying to keep you from your Victory it
[1:03:26] doesn't have one bit to do with whether
[1:03:28] or not it's for you in fact it's a sign
[1:03:30] probably that it is for you because the
[1:03:32] devil's trying to stop it but press
[1:03:34] through that into the reality and
[1:03:35] receive the promise that he gave you for
[1:03:37] the Holy Ghost for healing for
[1:03:39] everything you're going to need of press
[1:03:41] through that and let the word become
[1:03:42] your word brother Brian said you have
[1:03:44] something to do if I could have all
[1:03:46] these notes Here here but never preach
[1:03:48] it then then what Good's it going to do
[1:03:49] but that doesn't just apply to the
[1:03:51] preachers that you have something to do
[1:03:52] with let the word become your word and
[1:03:55] if you want to see a situation turn let
[1:03:57] the word drop into your heart and it'll
[1:03:59] turn that situation you let that word of
[1:04:01] healing drop into your heart it'll turn
[1:04:03] that situation you let that Word of
[1:04:05] Deliverance become your Word of
[1:04:07] Deliverance and it'll turn that
[1:04:08] situation
[1:04:09] oh it's a power in letting the word
[1:04:12] become personal to you you see our
[1:04:16] family very close to the Sacramento
[1:04:18] we're trying to have a baby one time and
[1:04:19] the situation looked very dire and the
[1:04:21] situation and looked very dark but one
[1:04:23] time a word caught hold and turned the
[1:04:25] situation and now they have a little
[1:04:27] baby girl and then another one on the
[1:04:29] way because they let the word become
[1:04:30] their word and you say well they had a
[1:04:32] vision over that but brother Brown said
[1:04:34] when you open the Bible every time you
[1:04:36] see a vision every time you open the
[1:04:38] Bible you may not have a vision by some
[1:04:40] man but you have a vision every time you
[1:04:42] open this Bible and you get a vision for
[1:04:44] your prodigals you get a vision for your
[1:04:46] healing and walk in that Vision until
[1:04:48] you walk into fulfillment and one of
[1:04:51] these days you'll be reading about
[1:04:52] prodigals returning and all sudden
[1:04:54] they'll come walking through your door
[1:04:55] because you have a vision by the word
[1:04:57] and you're walking in the vision and one
[1:05:00] of these days you're going to walk into
[1:05:01] fulfillment because you let that word
[1:05:03] become your word and drop Into the Heart
[1:05:06] of space Oh and now it's manifesting all
[1:05:08] around you and your walk in that
[1:05:10] fulfillment oh you'll be walking in your
[1:05:13] healing you'll be walking in your
[1:05:14] deliverance if you let that work become
[1:05:17] your word and keep walking keep walking
[1:05:19] in the vision and you're walking the
[1:05:21] Fulfillment Let It Drop In Your Heart oh
[1:05:23] it's not way far off it may take a few
[1:05:26] moments but keep walking in the
[1:05:27] commission and you'll be walking into
[1:05:29] fulfillment
[1:05:30] Hallelujah
[1:05:31] [Applause]
[1:05:33] what did the commission say let not this
[1:05:35] word depart from your mouth not let not
[1:05:38] this book of the law depart from your
[1:05:39] mouth he didn't say let it not depart
[1:05:42] from your hand he said let it not depart
[1:05:44] from your mouth
[1:05:47] Hallelujah that struck me
[1:05:49] brother Brandon sat hand and then he
[1:05:51] corrected not hand he said mouth you see
[1:05:53] somebody's going to teach it somebody's
[1:05:55] going to live it somebody's going to
[1:05:57] speak it it's not just coming to church
[1:05:58] and turning a page and reading about it
[1:06:00] and then going home somebody's going to
[1:06:02] let it get in their mouth and speak it
[1:06:04] and confess it until it becomes a
[1:06:06] reality in their lives let not that book
[1:06:08] of the law depart from your mouth
[1:06:10] stay with the commission
[1:06:12] stay with it is written you say oh so
[1:06:15] and so tried that and it didn't work for
[1:06:17] them but brother Branham said the Bible
[1:06:19] says some are foreordained to that
[1:06:21] condemnation some brother bran said the
[1:06:23] Bible said that they couldn't believe if
[1:06:25] they wanted to and some that is their
[1:06:27] type and some that is the place but
[1:06:30] that's not your confession that's not
[1:06:33] your place in this scripture you see the
[1:06:35] church natural couldn't receive the word
[1:06:37] because Eve natural was it was its type
[1:06:40] and they couldn't receive the word
[1:06:42] because they couldn't beat their tie
[1:06:44] brother Brandon said she can't beat her
[1:06:45] type you can't keep her from doing
[1:06:47] anything because she can't beat her type
[1:06:49] but if that could work in the negative
[1:06:51] how much more in the positive when the
[1:06:53] devil tells you you're never going to
[1:06:54] make a Rapture how could he tell you
[1:06:56] that when Enoch's your type and you
[1:06:58] can't beat your type if you're typing
[1:07:00] Enoch you can't miss the Rapture if
[1:07:02] you're typing Abraham you will not stop
[1:07:05] short of the promise because you can't
[1:07:07] beat your tag you can't keep them from
[1:07:09] nothing they've already been
[1:07:10] predestinated to fulfill the word and
[1:07:13] you can't beat your type young person
[1:07:14] don't let the devil beat you over the
[1:07:16] head with that you recognize who you are
[1:07:18] in the scripture and stand sure on that
[1:07:20] type that Enoch is my type Abraham's my
[1:07:23] type Rebecca's my type Sarah's my type
[1:07:26] already have my type and you can't beat
[1:07:29] your type press through it into the
[1:07:31] victory hallelu you can't beat it so
[1:07:33] press through it you see everyone's not
[1:07:36] gonna go with you but you can't beat
[1:07:38] your type it's for you it may not be for
[1:07:40] everyone but it's for me heartfelt
[1:07:43] religion may not be for everyone but
[1:07:44] it's for me the Rapture may not be for
[1:07:47] everyone but it is for me the Holy Ghost
[1:07:49] may not be for everyone but it is for me
[1:07:51] this message may not be for everyone but
[1:07:53] it is for me oh let that word become
[1:07:56] your word tonight
[1:07:58] of
[1:07:59] he said Joshua you're going to pass by
[1:08:02] Esau's mountain and there's going to be
[1:08:04] some that aren't going to go with you
[1:08:06] but he said your man your men have
[1:08:09] already tasted blood so they're going to
[1:08:11] want to try and go to fight with him but
[1:08:12] he said don't do that keep your eyes on
[1:08:14] the goal because because that's not your
[1:08:16] Mountain he said I've given these all
[1:08:19] this mountain for a possession but it's
[1:08:21] on the wrong side of the Jordan Joshua
[1:08:23] there's Jacob's mountain is on the other
[1:08:25] side of the river and you're meant to
[1:08:26] cross over your inheritance doesn't lay
[1:08:29] on this side of the river Joshua Esau's
[1:08:32] mountain is not for you and brother
[1:08:34] Branham said if all your deep is
[1:08:35] satisfied then then maybe that
[1:08:38] Mountain's for you but your inheritance
[1:08:40] to you who believe is on the other side
[1:08:42] of the river is that if all your deep is
[1:08:44] satisfied that's okay but as for me and
[1:08:47] my house there's something in me drawing
[1:08:48] I got across the Jordan I gotta cross
[1:08:51] the river there's a drawing he said a
[1:08:53] little healing service isn't good enough
[1:08:55] for me he said just going to church
[1:08:57] isn't good enough for me there's a deep
[1:08:58] calling to the Deep if I must cross the
[1:09:00] Jordan I must press to my mouth and I
[1:09:03] must press to my inheritance he said
[1:09:05] this doesn't belong to you your
[1:09:07] inheritance is beyond the river oh he
[1:09:09] said if Esau was predestinated to join
[1:09:11] up with you he would have so don't try
[1:09:14] to prosely Esau's Mount and he said
[1:09:16] you'll pick up their habits but as for
[1:09:18] me in my house you're across the river
[1:09:20] across to your inheritance across to
[1:09:23] where all things are possible oh that
[1:09:26] might not be everyone's type but that's
[1:09:27] your type you were not meant to stop at
[1:09:29] Esau's Mountain You Were Meant to cross
[1:09:31] over he said just settling down a sheep
[1:09:34] herding ain't enough for you just to go
[1:09:36] into some sort of business it isn't
[1:09:37] enough for you just to join the church
[1:09:38] and put your name on the book wasn't
[1:09:40] enough for you but there's a deep
[1:09:42] calling to the deep that won't be
[1:09:43] satisfied with anything less than
[1:09:45] Crossing into every promise
[1:09:48] oh yes you see you're going to pass some
[1:09:50] critics that say the days of Miracles
[1:09:52] are passed you're going to pass some
[1:09:54] critics Joshua out in the desert that
[1:09:56] are going to say that those things are
[1:09:58] gone that it's not for you that those
[1:09:59] things are ceased oh you're going to
[1:10:01] pass some that say Moses's message will
[1:10:03] not work it's not an absolute we can't
[1:10:05] put our faith in it we might be able to
[1:10:07] use it as reference material but Balaam
[1:10:09] he had good things to say too you're
[1:10:11] going to pass some critics of this
[1:10:12] message but Joshua was under commission
[1:10:15] stay with Moses his message Joshua was
[1:10:18] under a commission that said that thou
[1:10:20] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:10:22] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[1:10:25] thee it was commissioned to stay with
[1:10:27] the message no matter what come no
[1:10:29] matter what goal no matter what preacher
[1:10:30] said no matter what mother said he said
[1:10:32] your commissioned to stay with my
[1:10:34] message and brother Brandon said if you
[1:10:36] can read in that scripture something
[1:10:38] that Christ has ordained or commissioned
[1:10:40] us to do and because of some twisting
[1:10:42] around if someone would tell you that
[1:10:43] was for the disciples or someone else
[1:10:46] and then you don't hold on to that then
[1:10:48] Christ is not your absolute that person
[1:10:51] that led you out of the way is your
[1:10:53] absolute but if that word Christ still
[1:10:56] holds then he is your absolute so that
[1:10:59] struck my heart I said I wonder what
[1:11:01] we've been commissioned to do and then I
[1:11:03] know that that's my absolute regardless
[1:11:05] of what anyone says and we've been
[1:11:07] commissioned to baptize in the name of
[1:11:08] the Lord Jesus Christ no matter what
[1:11:10] what teacher comes in and says that it's
[1:11:12] this way or it's that way we're under a
[1:11:14] commission we're under commission to
[1:11:16] raise the dead and cast out devils and
[1:11:18] lay our hands on the sick brother bran
[1:11:20] said that's just as vital as the
[1:11:22] preaching of the word in one spot just
[1:11:24] as vital as it is to preach the gospel
[1:11:25] we've been commissioned to preach the
[1:11:27] word in power and demonstration not in
[1:11:30] word only not in letter only but in
[1:11:32] power and demonstration the Bible said
[1:11:34] my speech and preaching was not with
[1:11:36] enticing the words of man's Wisdom but
[1:11:39] in demonstration of the spirit and power
[1:11:41] that Peter on the day of Pentecost has
[1:11:43] so much power in the preaching of his
[1:11:45] word that while he spoke people could
[1:11:47] receive the Holy Ghost shows people
[1:11:49] could receive their healing because he
[1:11:51] was staying with the commission because
[1:11:52] it wasn't a dead letter he come out he
[1:11:55] said on Esau's Mountain they're building
[1:11:56] schools on Esau's Mountain there's
[1:11:58] building libraries and sending books but
[1:12:00] he said that's not what I've
[1:12:01] commissioned you to do I commissioned
[1:12:03] you to preach it in power and
[1:12:05] demonstration with signs and wonders
[1:12:07] following
[1:12:08] oh I'm getting somewhere with that you
[1:12:10] say half the churches half the churches
[1:12:12] will kick you out if you do that brother
[1:12:13] Brandon said you preached that you
[1:12:15] preached that Mark 16 and half the
[1:12:17] churches will kick you out but somewhere
[1:12:19] brother Tim in that other half there's a
[1:12:21] Rahab that's going to receive because
[1:12:23] you stepped into the commission there's
[1:12:24] a Rahab somewhere that's going to
[1:12:26] receive it and that's say that's for me
[1:12:28] that's for me someone's going to receive
[1:12:30] it because someone wasn't afraid to step
[1:12:32] in the commission and stay with the word
[1:12:34] there's an Elena butt somewhere that'll
[1:12:36] say that's for me and she'll slay a
[1:12:38] Goliath of cancer and it'll fall and her
[1:12:41] family will run behind her and say if
[1:12:42] it's for Mama it's for me too like David
[1:12:45] he killed that Goliath and the
[1:12:47] Israelites took courage and came behind
[1:12:49] him and said if it worked for them it'll
[1:12:51] work for me and brother Ben said you
[1:12:52] step in and say it's for me he said your
[1:12:54] whole family will come behind you and
[1:12:56] start start slaying Philistines because
[1:12:59] it isn't just for one it's for you who
[1:13:02] believe it's for you who have stepped
[1:13:04] into the commission but it doesn't just
[1:13:06] apply to preaching
[1:13:08] power and demonstration doesn't just
[1:13:10] apply to preaching I'm bringing it down
[1:13:12] to your level now it says your two took
[1:13:14] up and the things of the world you have
[1:13:16] to stay and see who loves to see you
[1:13:19] have to see Arthur Godfrey and go down
[1:13:20] and get Elvis Presley's records and play
[1:13:22] them and call yourselves Christians you
[1:13:24] are weighed in the balance and found
[1:13:26] wanting he said when you do go to church
[1:13:28] just a little sideline or something and
[1:13:30] don't worship he said in vain do they
[1:13:32] worship me teaching for Doctrine the
[1:13:35] Commandments of men in vain he said it
[1:13:37] don't do no good to worship if you
[1:13:39] worship like that Jesus said it was in
[1:13:41] vain
[1:13:42] he said now look at him sitting there
[1:13:44] all the big religious people standing
[1:13:47] there tipping their glasses and having a
[1:13:49] fellowship and Jesus setting over in a
[1:13:51] corner with dirty feet oh God forgive me
[1:13:54] when I think of it Jesus with dirty feet
[1:13:56] brother Brandon said that's why I
[1:13:58] stepped away from the Baptist Church
[1:14:00] Hallelujah yes sir I believe my God
[1:14:02] ought to be worshiped in the power and
[1:14:05] demonstration of the Holy Ghost he said
[1:14:07] I don't believe in your cold formal
[1:14:08] Creeds he wants to be loved look at him
[1:14:11] setting over there and can't be loved
[1:14:12] because of the way he's treated and he
[1:14:15] said that's the same thing today you
[1:14:16] self-made Seminary chickens are pastors
[1:14:19] hat yourself out and try to place the
[1:14:21] dirty name of Holy Roller on the worship
[1:14:23] of Jesus no wonder your congregation
[1:14:25] don't stand taller it's the way you've
[1:14:27] treated them he said if you would have
[1:14:29] preached the Bible and the power of the
[1:14:31] resurrection of Christ Saints would be
[1:14:33] shouting in every Church in the Maricopa
[1:14:35] Valley he said it's not Jesus fault it's
[1:14:37] your fault and if you don't want the
[1:14:39] move of God in your church that's okay
[1:14:40] but don't blame my Jesus Jesus never
[1:14:43] preach that don't blame my Jesus I've
[1:14:45] been commissioned to stay with the word
[1:14:47] I've been commissioned to worship if you
[1:14:49] don't want dancing in your church that's
[1:14:50] okay but don't blame my Jesus don't
[1:14:53] blame brother Brandon brother Branham
[1:14:55] never taught that leave it off my
[1:14:56] brother Brandon and stay with the
[1:14:58] commission somebody's going to worship
[1:15:00] Him somebody's gonna stay with the
[1:15:01] commission somebody's going to leave all
[1:15:04] their ideas and stay with the Commission
[1:15:06] in worship I'm in spite of what what
[1:15:08] someone out there said someone's going
[1:15:10] to stay with the absolute commission and
[1:15:12] worship of Empower and demonstration
[1:15:14] it's not Jesus fault he said it's your
[1:15:17] fault but somebody's going to say don't
[1:15:20] blame the message
[1:15:22] oh the message doesn't do away with true
[1:15:24] worship the message introduced us to
[1:15:27] true worship there is now a bride that's
[1:15:29] in complete relationship that don't just
[1:15:31] worship them in spirit or truth they
[1:15:34] worship them in spirit and truth because
[1:15:36] the message introduced us to true
[1:15:38] worship is finally a bride that converts
[1:15:40] from the way he deserves to be worshiped
[1:15:42] in power and demonstration in spirit and
[1:15:46] in truth because a prophet wasn't afraid
[1:15:48] to stay with the commission oh he had to
[1:15:51] leave he had to leave the Baptist Church
[1:15:52] to do it but he stayed with the
[1:15:54] commission oh you say that was just for
[1:15:56] the Pentecostals well then why did the
[1:15:59] prophet have to leave denominations to
[1:16:01] worship God the way he deserved to be
[1:16:03] worshiped oh we're not worshiping under
[1:16:06] some sort of emotion but like David
[1:16:08] danced at the return of the word we're
[1:16:10] worshiping the return of the word we're
[1:16:13] worshiping to return to the word Hosanna
[1:16:15] to the one riding on the donkey he said
[1:16:17] oh dancing but we were commissioned in
[1:16:19] Psalms 150 praise him with the dance
[1:16:22] raise him on the timbrel let everything
[1:16:24] out of breath praise the Lord someone's
[1:16:26] going to stay with that absolute
[1:16:28] commission and not leave it Hallelujah
[1:16:32] oh and the critics
[1:16:34] are trying to get by Brother Graham said
[1:16:36] with some kind of ordination paper and
[1:16:39] not the true seal of the commission how
[1:16:41] could someone criticize it because they
[1:16:43] never got the true seal they just got
[1:16:45] some kind of ordination papers having a
[1:16:48] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:16:50] thereof Oh Brother Bear said Moses
[1:16:52] didn't just sympathize with those mud
[1:16:54] daubers he said he could have just
[1:16:56] looked out that window and sympathized
[1:16:58] with him but instead he chose to become
[1:17:00] one of them and brother Braham said I
[1:17:02] was in the Baptist Church and when I
[1:17:04] seen that was people with signs and
[1:17:05] wonders following though they were
[1:17:07] laughed at and called Holy Rollers he
[1:17:09] said it would have been easy to remain a
[1:17:11] Baptist preacher for I was one but I
[1:17:13] chose to become one of them at the
[1:17:16] Baptist Church to become one of them not
[1:17:18] just to sympathize with them but become
[1:17:20] one of those one of those Holy Rollers
[1:17:23] brother Branham said I heard it today
[1:17:24] you better be careful that you don't
[1:17:26] call someone a Holy Roller that's doing
[1:17:28] what you should have done he said you
[1:17:30] better be careful that you don't
[1:17:31] criticize someone that's doing what you
[1:17:34] should have been doing in the first
[1:17:35] place but someone's going to stay with
[1:17:37] it someone's going to realize it's for
[1:17:39] me if no one else does it it's for me
[1:17:41] I'm gonna step in and I'm going to give
[1:17:43] it my all because there's a deep calling
[1:17:46] into the deep that my God deserves to be
[1:17:48] worshiped correctly
[1:17:51] according to the commission
[1:17:53] oh you see Miriam danced because her
[1:17:56] accusers were drowned in the sea
[1:17:58] oh my
[1:18:01] accusers accusers accusers of past
[1:18:05] mistakes accusers of being just too
[1:18:07] emotional but one day those accusers
[1:18:10] were buried in the sea and Miriam had a
[1:18:12] victory dance
[1:18:13] and you say well that was just for
[1:18:14] sanctification but the Lord spoke to
[1:18:17] Joshua when he crossed over the George
[1:18:19] and said this day have I rolled away the
[1:18:21] reproach of Egypt from off of you this
[1:18:23] day Joshua have I rolled away your
[1:18:26] reproach you see if anyone can worship
[1:18:28] him it's this bride there's therefore
[1:18:30] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:18:32] Christ Jesus who walked not after the
[1:18:34] flesh but after the spirit those of you
[1:18:37] whose accusers have been buried you have
[1:18:39] a right to worship him like Jesus said
[1:18:41] to the woman where are thine accusers
[1:18:43] she said I have none Lord he said
[1:18:46] neither do I accuse you go and sin no
[1:18:48] more and I say to this bride where are
[1:18:51] thine accusers brother Branham an
[1:18:53] invisible Union declared you standing
[1:18:55] completely as you never sinned in the
[1:18:57] first place God don't even know it's in
[1:18:59] the sea of forgetfulness you never did
[1:19:01] it you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:19:04] but really from the beginning you were
[1:19:05] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:19:08] of God you're standing there washed in
[1:19:10] your old book of divorcement is put away
[1:19:12] and instead absolutely out of existence
[1:19:15] you see you were deceived in it because
[1:19:17] inside of you the whole time was it Gene
[1:19:19] seed the real you you were deceived into
[1:19:21] it you were born a sinner but that was
[1:19:23] never the real you you were a gene seed
[1:19:25] from God or your accusations have been
[1:19:28] put in the sea of the forgetfulness oh
[1:19:31] you have a right to worship you're
[1:19:33] already wearing a wedding band of
[1:19:34] unmerited predestinated Grace little
[1:19:37] bride your accusers are buried in the
[1:19:39] sea you have a right tonight to lay
[1:19:41] aside every weight and the sin which
[1:19:43] says so easily beset you you see young
[1:19:45] man if you want to become a stronger
[1:19:47] young man you're going to have to learn
[1:19:48] to how to lift weights but if you want
[1:19:50] to become a stronger Christian young man
[1:19:52] you're going to have to learn how to lay
[1:19:53] them aside learn how to lay aside that
[1:19:55] condemnation learn how to lay aside
[1:19:57] those weights learn how to lay aside
[1:19:59] those feelings and take God's word in
[1:20:01] spite of it and press on brother bran
[1:20:03] said the church ought to have a
[1:20:05] commission like that go forward don't
[1:20:07] you stop just keep moving on press
[1:20:09] through the battles press through the
[1:20:11] complexes
[1:20:13] oh brother Brandon standing in the Gap
[1:20:16] he said
[1:20:18] he said it's just so easy to get a
[1:20:20] complex because brother Branham a
[1:20:22] prophet the seventh angel because people
[1:20:25] wouldn't hear his message he got a
[1:20:26] complex and he began to lose the feeling
[1:20:28] for the people and he said it's just so
[1:20:31] easy to get a complex here the seventh
[1:20:33] angel is telling you here he is telling
[1:20:36] you it's just so easy to get the complex
[1:20:37] but he asked the people he said I've
[1:20:40] asked that you would pray for me that
[1:20:41] God would restore I ask that you pray
[1:20:43] for me that he would get back to me what
[1:20:45] I lost out there in that complex and
[1:20:48] that's my prayer tonight for every
[1:20:49] complex that God would ReStore in your
[1:20:52] life what you lost out there in that
[1:20:53] complex that you could lay it aside that
[1:20:56] if someone criticized your worship and
[1:20:58] now you can barely lift your hands
[1:21:00] without feeling condemned may God
[1:21:02] restore what you lost out there in that
[1:21:03] complex if someone called you ugly or if
[1:21:06] someone made fun of you and made fun of
[1:21:08] your Christian walk and you begin to
[1:21:10] feel a complex throughout about what
[1:21:12] others think may God restore what you
[1:21:14] lost out there in that complex tonight
[1:21:15] maybe there's an elder here that got out
[1:21:18] in an inferiority complex somewhere and
[1:21:20] think that we don't need them or that
[1:21:22] that we don't have to have them to press
[1:21:24] on I rebuke that devil and pray God
[1:21:27] restored you the joy of your salvation
[1:21:29] and lets you know that we need you that
[1:21:31] we're helpless that we need you a Mighty
[1:21:34] Oak tree that we can rest under we can't
[1:21:36] press the battle without you we need our
[1:21:38] elders we need our young people I pray
[1:21:40] God restore what you lost in that
[1:21:42] complex out there that you can lay it
[1:21:44] aside bury it with the old gear and
[1:21:47] press on kill that thing don't dig up
[1:21:49] that old nature young people what the
[1:21:51] Lord did for you at Youth Camp what the
[1:21:53] Lord did for you in your special
[1:21:54] meetings here at church don't dig up
[1:21:56] that old man when God once sealed you he
[1:21:59] kicked that door shut don't try to open
[1:22:01] it again brother bran said don't get out
[1:22:03] on the tracks and try to open it if God
[1:22:05] sealed you you're sealed under the day
[1:22:06] of your Redemption don't try to dig up
[1:22:09] that old man bury your differences Bury
[1:22:11] Bury those things with the old year if
[1:22:14] God sealed your life don't try to open
[1:22:16] it oh I've been there
[1:22:19] but oh there's a piece
[1:22:21] and knowing what God does he does it
[1:22:23] well
[1:22:25] oh you don't have to break it to check
[1:22:27] it leave it alone
[1:22:29] leave it alone why couldn't you stop
[1:22:30] Joshua
[1:22:34] said
[1:22:35] any man that's a real queer Christian
[1:22:38] born again today
[1:22:40] no since he was a little kid or a little
[1:22:43] girl either there was something in you
[1:22:45] that hungered for God and you tried
[1:22:47] joining churches and everything else it
[1:22:49] wouldn't work what was it it was that
[1:22:51] word you was hunting for a filter and
[1:22:54] one day it flashed before your eyes
[1:22:55] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:22:57] and forever and that satisfied The Taste
[1:23:00] he said anyone in here that's a
[1:23:03] Christian knows that something's been on
[1:23:04] you your whole life when you was a child
[1:23:06] you longed to serve God something beat
[1:23:09] in your heart it was God's election
[1:23:11] that's why you couldn't stop Joshua
[1:23:13] because Joshua was filtered for the
[1:23:15] commission that's why you couldn't stop
[1:23:17] Gideon's Army because there was some
[1:23:19] tests and he said if they're coward send
[1:23:21] them back and if they bow down to drink
[1:23:23] water send them back because they're
[1:23:26] used to bowing down to idols and we
[1:23:28] can't use them but Gideon's Army was
[1:23:30] filtered for the commission Elijah seven
[1:23:33] thousand was filtered for the commission
[1:23:35] Elijah said take courage you know
[1:23:37] Jezebel rejected your ministry Elijah
[1:23:39] this whole this whole multitudes
[1:23:41] rejected your ministry but brother
[1:23:43] Branham said the third poll went back
[1:23:45] for that seven thousand the second pool
[1:23:48] was to Jezebel but the third poll went
[1:23:49] back to that seven thousand you see God
[1:23:52] sent you a word to reveal to you who you
[1:23:54] were where you came from and where
[1:23:56] you're going though the multitudes only
[1:23:58] came for healing though the multitudes
[1:24:00] only came for brother branham's Healing
[1:24:02] Ministry there was something in you that
[1:24:03] wasn't just satisfied with that but you
[1:24:05] said there's a word there's a message
[1:24:07] there's a revelation that'll show me who
[1:24:09] I am and then come down and pick you up
[1:24:11] and filtered you for Rapture it filtered
[1:24:14] you for Resurrection it showed you who
[1:24:16] you were you passed the test because you
[1:24:18] were filtered through the first pole you
[1:24:20] were filtered through many things that's
[1:24:22] why you're still here when many others
[1:24:24] have left because there's a thinking
[1:24:25] filter that proves God's election in
[1:24:27] your life that won't settle for just a
[1:24:29] church joining it won't settle for
[1:24:31] anything short but it's filtered you
[1:24:33] through to fulfill the commission the
[1:24:36] natural Church couldn't go through that
[1:24:38] filter but God called out a bride that
[1:24:40] would pass through that filter to
[1:24:42] fulfill his commission he called out a
[1:24:45] bride that would receive this message
[1:24:46] you've been filtered for it because you
[1:24:48] wouldn't bow to Idols the Hebrew
[1:24:51] children once went into a fiery furnace
[1:24:53] and because they wouldn't bow they went
[1:24:56] into a furnace and brother Branham said
[1:24:58] that's what the devil will try to you do
[1:25:01] to you will try to burn you up with
[1:25:02] things
[1:25:04] that's what brother Branham said you've
[1:25:05] been prayed for and you'll get sicker
[1:25:07] it's the fiery furnace he's trying to
[1:25:09] burn you up with things he said he'll
[1:25:11] make you thought think you've lost your
[1:25:13] experience
[1:25:14] and brother bran said he's lying to you
[1:25:17] there's got to be a time when you've got
[1:25:19] to separate yourself between your
[1:25:20] feelings and your faith brother Brandon
[1:25:22] said that's the time it is tonight where
[1:25:25] you separate yourself between your
[1:25:27] feelings and your faith and say I will
[1:25:28] not bow to that devil I will not bow to
[1:25:31] that devil that's been lying to me you
[1:25:33] see you're like shamgar and there Comes
[1:25:35] A Time in the life where you realize
[1:25:37] that you don't have to take that beating
[1:25:39] anymore used to be when the devil told
[1:25:41] you you never were going to make it it
[1:25:43] would bother you for days but you're
[1:25:45] coming to a place where you realize you
[1:25:46] don't have to take the beating anymore
[1:25:48] you're recognizing who you are and he
[1:25:51] should have got you when you were
[1:25:52] walking in fear Lemuel he should have
[1:25:54] got you when you were walking in
[1:25:55] depression sister Rebecca because now
[1:25:58] you're walking in the commission and he
[1:26:00] can't get you anymore because you've
[1:26:01] stepped into something deeper than the
[1:26:03] lies of the devil you've been filtered
[1:26:05] for in a shame guards risen up and he
[1:26:07] said it's for me and I don't have to
[1:26:09] take the beating anymore because I know
[1:26:11] who I am I know the raptures for me I
[1:26:13] know I'm gonna make it I know the Holy
[1:26:16] Ghost is for me shamgar rise up and take
[1:26:18] back your possession you don't have to
[1:26:20] take the beating anymore you can press
[1:26:22] through it oh and say I know those lies
[1:26:26] aren't for me but every promise in the
[1:26:27] book is for me oh that's why you're
[1:26:30] still here that's why when you lay at
[1:26:32] bed at night and the devil tries to tell
[1:26:34] you this message isn't for you but
[1:26:36] there's something in you when many of
[1:26:38] them heard those lies and left there's
[1:26:40] something in you that said but to whom
[1:26:42] would I go where would I go this message
[1:26:45] alone is my shelter this message alone
[1:26:48] has the words of eternal life there was
[1:26:50] something in your filter that said but
[1:26:52] where would I go where would I go if I
[1:26:54] left that's why you're still here you've
[1:26:57] been filtered for the day you've been
[1:26:58] filtered for the commission that's why
[1:27:00] you're still here oh where would you go
[1:27:03] where else would you go that deep
[1:27:05] calling was pulling you to this message
[1:27:07] it wouldn't let you go anywhere else
[1:27:09] because there was a pull on the inside
[1:27:10] of you leading you to who you were
[1:27:13] before the foundation of the world world
[1:27:15] oh where would we go
[1:27:19] like Elisha came to Elijah and Elijah
[1:27:23] cast his mantle on Elisha and he said oh
[1:27:26] he said he cast his mantle and Elijah
[1:27:29] began to follow him and he said oh stay
[1:27:32] uh the Lord's calling me here and he's
[1:27:35] telling Elisha to stay but Elisha said
[1:27:37] no as my as my soul lives I will not let
[1:27:40] you out of my Society Elijah and he
[1:27:42] followed them to Dothan brother Branham
[1:27:44] said was justification he said he
[1:27:47] followed him to the school of the
[1:27:48] prophets which was sanctification but he
[1:27:51] followed him all the way to Jordan and
[1:27:52] one day he crossed over and he said oh
[1:27:55] if you see me when I go you can have
[1:27:56] what you asked for and he said I asked
[1:27:58] for a double portion of your spirit and
[1:28:00] one day that Chariot went up and that
[1:28:03] mantle came down and it was a perfect
[1:28:05] fit because elisho wasn't changed to fit
[1:28:08] it God didn't oh God didn't change the
[1:28:10] mantle to fit Elisha but God changed
[1:28:13] Elijah to fit the mantle he'd have to
[1:28:15] alter the message to fit your life you
[1:28:18] were already fitted before the
[1:28:19] foundation of the world this day for
[1:28:22] this message and Elisha stepped into
[1:28:24] that coat and it fit just right you see
[1:28:26] justification didn't cut it for him the
[1:28:29] school the prophets didn't cut it for
[1:28:31] him it didn't look right on them when
[1:28:33] you try on outfits before church tonight
[1:28:35] you go and say this doesn't look right
[1:28:37] this one doesn't look right this one
[1:28:39] doesn't look right but one one time you
[1:28:41] find one he said my that's very becoming
[1:28:44] of you that really looks good on you
[1:28:46] that's the one you're gonna wear that
[1:28:47] one and that was this message in your
[1:28:49] life you tried on justification you
[1:28:52] tried on sanctification you tried on
[1:28:54] depression and fear but one day you
[1:28:56] tried on this message and it fit just
[1:28:57] right and satisfied what you were
[1:29:00] missing your whole life it satisfied
[1:29:02] that calling on the inside of you and
[1:29:03] said this is who I am this is where I
[1:29:06] came from this is my reality this is my
[1:29:08] identification and it's becoming of you
[1:29:11] young people to wear the Rope of the
[1:29:12] message depression doesn't look good on
[1:29:15] you inside it doesn't look good on you
[1:29:17] but try on this message one time and
[1:29:19] it'll set you free from that thing and
[1:29:22] show you who you are show you where you
[1:29:24] came from try that message on it'll
[1:29:26] satisfy that deep calling I am a witness
[1:29:28] what God can do in your life if you step
[1:29:31] into the message and let it change you
[1:29:33] and transform you into who you were in
[1:29:36] God's mind before the foundation of the
[1:29:38] world try on the road that he likes to
[1:29:40] tried on and recognize who you are in
[1:29:43] Christ that will change you it'll set
[1:29:45] that filter just right and say this is
[1:29:47] it this is what I've been missing oh
[1:29:50] this is what I've been commissioned to
[1:29:52] do my whole life
[1:29:54] oh Elijah tried it on and it fit just
[1:29:57] right it was the same mantle that fell
[1:30:00] on the day of Pentecost and that's what
[1:30:02] fit your life and you can strike it for
[1:30:05] healing you can strike it like Elisha
[1:30:07] for deliverance for every promise you
[1:30:09] can strike that mantle oh and it'll work
[1:30:12] for you because you were tailored for it
[1:30:15] Hallelujah
[1:30:17] oh praise God
[1:30:20] you see
[1:30:22] you see Joshua
[1:30:24] wasn't the Forerunner
[1:30:27] Joshua was the inhabitor Moses Moses ran
[1:30:32] Joshua inhabited
[1:30:35] oh my Elijah ran
[1:30:37] Elisha
[1:30:39] inhabited
[1:30:41] and brother Branham was he was on this
[1:30:43] Earth
[1:30:44] he said I seen the message wasn't what
[1:30:47] what it is now he said I could see a
[1:30:49] group of people
[1:30:51] I see them splitting off from all these
[1:30:52] denominations and they have nowhere to
[1:30:54] go
[1:30:55] and he said when I laid the Cornerstone
[1:30:57] that morning on that church building God
[1:31:00] gave him a vision and he said from that
[1:31:02] time forward I purposed in my heart to
[1:31:05] make a place where the people could go
[1:31:07] to worship Him He said it ain't for me
[1:31:10] it's nothing for me he said God's
[1:31:12] calling me to do the work of an
[1:31:13] evangelist but he said I had something
[1:31:15] in my heart from that day to make some
[1:31:17] place for the people to Worship in and I
[1:31:20] don't believe that was just Brandon
[1:31:21] Tabernacle but I believe brother Brandon
[1:31:23] was here fulfilling something making a
[1:31:25] place for me and you to Worship in and
[1:31:28] he come and he preached to us God's
[1:31:29] chosen place of worship and introduced
[1:31:31] us to a living God he didn't just give
[1:31:34] us a tabernacle like this but he gave us
[1:31:36] a tabernacle that we could inhabit a
[1:31:38] place where we could worship when we
[1:31:40] were kicked out of every denomination of
[1:31:42] man's idea but you wouldn't bow to that
[1:31:44] Idol but God had a forerunner on the
[1:31:46] earth preparing a place for you to
[1:31:48] Worship in oh it was it was striking to
[1:31:51] me in the back office brother Tim was
[1:31:52] just talking about how the young
[1:31:54] children would gather around him when he
[1:31:55] was very breaking this ground I didn't
[1:31:57] tell him anything about this but he said
[1:31:59] oh he would tell the little kitties this
[1:32:01] isn't for me this is for you he said I
[1:32:03] may not see I may not see you grow up to
[1:32:06] fulfill I may not see you come to the
[1:32:08] age that I am but I'm coming to prepare
[1:32:10] a place for you it was building a place
[1:32:12] for the people to inhabit but it takes
[1:32:15] the people to step into the building and
[1:32:17] feel the pews and brother Branham came
[1:32:19] and preached us the message but
[1:32:21] somebody's got to inhabit God's chosen
[1:32:23] place of worship somebody's got to
[1:32:25] inhabit the Rapture somebody's got to
[1:32:27] inhabit the bride's Revival Somebody's
[1:32:29] gotta inhabit the rising of the sun
[1:32:31] somebody's got to inhabit leadership and
[1:32:34] Rapture somebody's got to step into the
[1:32:36] commission into the tracks that the
[1:32:38] Forerunner went before you somebody's
[1:32:40] got to step in and fulfill it you see he
[1:32:43] wasn't maybe going to see the finish of
[1:32:44] it all but he did it for you brother
[1:32:47] Brandon would step into the prayer line
[1:32:48] many times and he would come down and he
[1:32:51] said oh my shoes won't fit you my shoe's
[1:32:53] not the same size he would look at you
[1:32:55] and say well my jacket it fits you said
[1:32:57] no my jacket wouldn't fit him or I'd
[1:32:58] give it to him but he gave me something
[1:33:00] better than his shoes in his jacket he
[1:33:02] gave me a message that I could step into
[1:33:04] and find satisfaction he prepared a way
[1:33:07] that I could step in and find the joy of
[1:33:10] my life and find the Peace of my life he
[1:33:12] didn't give me natural clothes he gave
[1:33:14] me a message that would fit something
[1:33:16] that I could step into and wear every
[1:33:18] day of my life and be satisfied
[1:33:22] oh he preached the message and he said
[1:33:24] this is the light walking in it this is
[1:33:27] the light walking in it he showed me a
[1:33:30] place that I could inhabit and find
[1:33:32] refuge in the weary storm oh but
[1:33:36] somebody's going to step into the
[1:33:37] prophet's tracks of an invincible Army
[1:33:40] of a pure spotless bride oh many have
[1:33:43] seen God and brother Branham
[1:33:45] but only some that followed
[1:33:48] many have seen God in Moses but only
[1:33:50] some followed brother Branham said that
[1:33:52] Rich Young Ruler knew exactly who he was
[1:33:54] talking to but he didn't follow him but
[1:33:57] it wasn't in you to stay short of that
[1:33:59] there was something in you that seen it
[1:34:01] and you followed because it was in you
[1:34:04] that was what you were put here for oh
[1:34:07] and I know it's for me because I got the
[1:34:09] robe I got the robe and that's why I
[1:34:12] know it's for me because I didn't go
[1:34:13] through some back door to get it I came
[1:34:15] God's chosen way I came by God's
[1:34:17] leadership and got the robe and that's
[1:34:19] how I know it's for me that's how I know
[1:34:21] the message is for me that's how I know
[1:34:23] the Rapture is for me because I got the
[1:34:25] robe because I stepped into the
[1:34:27] commission
[1:34:29] oh Manny when Joshua crossed the Jordan
[1:34:33] he built a memorial of stones that
[1:34:35] others could walk by and see the mighty
[1:34:37] works of God in that day but I was
[1:34:40] reading about it the other day and it
[1:34:41] said to some it was just a pile of
[1:34:43] stones to some it was just Rubble but to
[1:34:45] the believer it was a memorial and
[1:34:48] that's what it is to you when you turn
[1:34:49] on the message it means something that
[1:34:51] it doesn't mean to your worldly maybe
[1:34:53] friends or neighbors they might listen
[1:34:55] to it and it's just a pile of rubble but
[1:34:58] when you turn it on it's a stone of
[1:34:59] remembrance of what God has done it's a
[1:35:02] stone of remembrance of what God can do
[1:35:04] you see when Martha was here and Lazarus
[1:35:07] was dead oh it was a dire situation but
[1:35:10] there was something in Martha as a as a
[1:35:13] as an elect of God brother Branham said
[1:35:16] Martha in that dire situation she had
[1:35:18] heard the story of the shunamite woman
[1:35:20] and how God had used Elijah to bring
[1:35:24] dead life back to baby boy and she heard
[1:35:27] the story and all of a sudden in
[1:35:28] Martha's dark situation she remembers
[1:35:30] this story about how God had used a lot
[1:35:33] Elijah to bring life back to a dead
[1:35:35] situation Martha remembered this story
[1:35:38] but it didn't just remain a story but
[1:35:40] brother bear said she had that
[1:35:42] Revelation that if God was with Elijah
[1:35:44] surely he's with his son and she
[1:35:47] recognized the potential of the word
[1:35:49] coming into her midst it wasn't just God
[1:35:52] sent a prophet but when the prophet
[1:35:54] leaves then it's all over with but
[1:35:56] Martha recognized the potential of the
[1:35:58] word coming into her midst that if God
[1:36:00] the same God that was with the prophet
[1:36:02] is with the word coming into her midst
[1:36:05] and that's what you do you recognize you
[1:36:07] stumble upon a stone of remembrance and
[1:36:09] it's not just a story of a shunamite
[1:36:11] woman but you're recognizing that the
[1:36:13] same God is in your midst today and
[1:36:16] every sermon that's being preached
[1:36:17] across your ears the Living God is
[1:36:20] speaking to your stones of remembrance
[1:36:21] that you can remember you can remember a
[1:36:24] god of of yesterday you see he's the
[1:36:26] same today and forever and I can imagine
[1:36:30] as Elisha put on that robe he remembered
[1:36:34] the stories of Elijah and what Elijah
[1:36:37] had done as Elisha begins to step into
[1:36:40] that robe he remembers he remembers what
[1:36:42] God had done through Elijah's ministry
[1:36:44] as he begins to step in that robe and
[1:36:47] brother bear said it's the blind
[1:36:48] Bartimaeus could trust him I can too if
[1:36:51] the woman with the blood issue could
[1:36:52] touch His Garment I can too for his open
[1:36:55] and willing his begging and accepting
[1:36:57] whosoever will let him come and drink
[1:36:59] from the Waters of Life freely he said
[1:37:02] what we need today is a Revival of that
[1:37:05] type A Revival of we can too a Revival
[1:37:08] that's what this message means to me it
[1:37:10] means I can too it means if it worked
[1:37:13] for brother Tim it'll work for me if it
[1:37:15] means if it worked for brother Ronnie
[1:37:16] and brother Nathan it'll work for me
[1:37:18] that's what this message means to me it
[1:37:20] means I can too because he's the same
[1:37:22] yesterday today and forever if it worked
[1:37:24] for brother Ron with stage four cancer
[1:37:26] it'll work for me if it worked for
[1:37:28] sister Elena it'll work for me because
[1:37:30] this message is a reality if it worked
[1:37:34] for brother branham's prayer line when a
[1:37:36] young man could bring shoes through and
[1:37:38] receive his ability to walk it'll work
[1:37:40] for Mariah Pruitt who can bring in some
[1:37:42] bobby pins and get her hair growed back
[1:37:44] because it's not a god of History it'll
[1:37:47] still work for you young people the same
[1:37:49] as it worked for your pastor the same as
[1:37:51] it worked for Mama and Daddy if you step
[1:37:53] into it it's not a history lesson it's a
[1:37:56] reality it's a Revival of Jesus Christ
[1:37:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:38:00] it's a Revival of weekend too we can too
[1:38:04] it'll work for you young people
[1:38:06] oh
[1:38:08] you see it won't work for everyone
[1:38:10] though Pharaoh's Army tried to follow
[1:38:13] them through that Red Sea and they
[1:38:15] presumed that if the Believers the
[1:38:17] circumcised Israelites could walk
[1:38:19] through I said so can we and that was a
[1:38:22] dire mistake because they were a
[1:38:24] non-circumcised group and they couldn't
[1:38:26] follow the Believers through that Red
[1:38:27] Sea and that's what a reality you're
[1:38:30] realizing that you're going places that
[1:38:32] your enemy can't follow you that Revival
[1:38:35] won't work for your enemy but you step
[1:38:37] into that Holy Ghost he won't be able to
[1:38:39] follow you there he won't be able to
[1:38:41] follow you into the Rapture you won't be
[1:38:43] able to follow you into that place where
[1:38:45] all things are possible for you you
[1:38:46] might be able to follow you so far but
[1:38:48] step into that place where that enemy
[1:38:50] can't follow you press through that Red
[1:38:52] Sea press into that Promised Land you
[1:38:55] won't be able to follow you there you'll
[1:38:57] be dancing to victory march and your
[1:38:59] enemy will be drowned behind you he
[1:39:01] can't follow that Revival it's not for
[1:39:03] him but it's for you Jesus Christ the
[1:39:06] same yesterday today and forever is for
[1:39:07] you the devil can't follow you there but
[1:39:10] Preston where he can't follow you where
[1:39:13] those lies no longer keep you up at
[1:39:15] night press through into the place oh
[1:39:17] where that enemy can no longer told you
[1:39:19] you've crossed the place and no return
[1:39:22] you've pressed into a reality and all
[1:39:24] things are possible the sick can be
[1:39:26] healed the dead can be raised the lane
[1:39:28] can walk you press through into place
[1:39:31] where that devil cannot follow you oh
[1:39:33] you're going places young people you're
[1:39:35] going to Place Church of the Living God
[1:39:37] that the devil can't follow you and one
[1:39:39] day you'll go on a Rapture and he'll be
[1:39:41] stuck here to go through a lake of fire
[1:39:43] because he can't follow you through that
[1:39:44] place you've been filtered for the day
[1:39:47] you've been filtered to go places that
[1:39:49] the enemy can't follow you and holy left
[1:39:52] behind while you're in the victory Marsh
[1:39:54] while you're dancing like Mary and while
[1:39:57] you're dancing like Joshua oh that enemy
[1:40:00] will be left behind he can't follow you
[1:40:02] there he's been left behind oh he's been
[1:40:05] left behind in his own unbelief oh and
[1:40:08] his own limited his own limited capacity
[1:40:10] but you you're an eagle that can soar
[1:40:13] above that where buzzards can't follow
[1:40:15] you he said oh he said if they would
[1:40:18] have put that wine in that it would blow
[1:40:20] it up because it was it was he couldn't
[1:40:22] put that wine in that old bottle oh but
[1:40:24] you've been you've been built to
[1:40:26] compress through that you've had a new
[1:40:28] spirit you've received a reality that'll
[1:40:31] take you places where he can't follow
[1:40:33] you
[1:40:34] oh
[1:40:36] you might get discouraged but just keep
[1:40:38] pressing just keep walking you may feel
[1:40:41] like he's there I don't have the quote
[1:40:44] in front of me brother I think said if
[1:40:46] you if he hasn't got you yet you're
[1:40:48] still a few steps ahead of him and just
[1:40:50] keep walking just keep walking young
[1:40:52] people brother Brandon one time landed
[1:40:54] and I believe it was Memphis in in his
[1:40:57] flight I think was delayed until he got
[1:40:59] off the plane and he went and I think he
[1:41:00] maybe got a sandwich and he just began
[1:41:03] to walk and all of a sudden the Lord
[1:41:04] spoke to him and said go this way go
[1:41:06] this way and he was leading him to an
[1:41:08] old uh an old colored woman that was
[1:41:10] going to Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:41:12] and God was leading the prophet there
[1:41:14] but he didn't understand it all in that
[1:41:15] moment but the spirit of the Lord would
[1:41:17] speak to him just keep walking just keep
[1:41:20] walking he said oh the plane's going to
[1:41:21] take off I'm gonna miss it he got a call
[1:41:24] it's going to leave at six o'clock he
[1:41:25] said oh I'm going to miss my plane but
[1:41:27] the spirit of the Lord would just speak
[1:41:28] just keep walking and he began to sing
[1:41:30] that song or brother Timothy saying I'm
[1:41:32] one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad
[1:41:35] I can say I want to begin to sing that
[1:41:37] old Victory song and he just began to
[1:41:40] walk with the Lord and that's where you
[1:41:42] want to receive Victory you stop
[1:41:44] worrying about the plane and when it's
[1:41:45] going to take off and just keep walking
[1:41:47] with the Lord you get your eyes off the
[1:41:49] conditions and just keep walking with
[1:41:51] the Lord I think that's for this new
[1:41:53] year just get your eyes off the
[1:41:54] conditions and just keep walking just
[1:41:56] keep walking and it is written just keep
[1:41:59] walking and just saith the Lord Brother
[1:42:01] man said if you obey the word what's
[1:42:03] coming next the promise is what's coming
[1:42:05] next if you've obeyed the word for
[1:42:07] healing for the Holy Ghost for a Rapture
[1:42:09] the promise is coming next so just keep
[1:42:11] walking stop worrying about the
[1:42:13] conditions stop worrying about how far
[1:42:15] out your prodigal is and just keep
[1:42:17] walking in the promise until it's
[1:42:19] fulfilled stop worrying about how sick
[1:42:21] you are and how impossible it seems to
[1:42:23] make it and just keep walking if you've
[1:42:25] obeyed the word the promise is coming
[1:42:27] don't worry just keep walking in the
[1:42:30] promise walking in the commission
[1:42:31] remember who you're walking with you're
[1:42:33] walking with one that Enoch walked with
[1:42:35] your walking with the one that Joshua
[1:42:37] met the captain of the Lord the captain
[1:42:40] of the host you're walking with the one
[1:42:41] that brother Brandon walked with when he
[1:42:43] turned back young and that virgin Timber
[1:42:45] and his wife was there with them and all
[1:42:47] of a sudden he was a young man you're
[1:42:49] walking with a god of the impossible
[1:42:51] remember who you're walking with it's
[1:42:54] not a history lesson remember you're
[1:42:56] walking with the same one that Moses
[1:42:59] walked with that Joshua walked with
[1:43:02] you see
[1:43:04] I don't know how many in here like to
[1:43:06] read but I used to read quite a bit when
[1:43:08] I was younger
[1:43:09] and sometimes you're reading a book
[1:43:12] and you come down
[1:43:13] and when a chapter ends the words don't
[1:43:16] always go to the end of the page
[1:43:17] sometimes there's a space a blank space
[1:43:18] and when you're coming to the end of
[1:43:19] that book you're coming to where those
[1:43:21] things are beginning to come to Climax
[1:43:23] and you see those words stop at the end
[1:43:26] of the page and you think oh my is this
[1:43:28] the end of the book
[1:43:30] is this the end of the book I don't
[1:43:31] understand everything yet what if this
[1:43:34] is the last chapter and you turn that
[1:43:36] page and all of a sudden there's another
[1:43:38] chapter and you feel such a relief you
[1:43:40] say oh my it's all going to make sense
[1:43:42] now there's another chapter where it's
[1:43:44] all going to come together and in
[1:43:46] literature there's something called a
[1:43:47] day Newman it's those final events those
[1:43:50] final scenes in literature where the
[1:43:52] where all the loose tens are tied
[1:43:53] together it's that it's that final part
[1:43:55] of a script where all those loose ends
[1:43:58] come together and you're walking in that
[1:44:00] day Numan you're walking in that place
[1:44:02] where the loose sins are being tied
[1:44:04] together that's what this message did it
[1:44:06] tied the loose sins of teachers over the
[1:44:08] years together and gave us an answer it
[1:44:10] gave us something that made sense it
[1:44:12] gave us something that fulfilled what
[1:44:14] we've been looking for in you and the
[1:44:16] things of your life and the things that
[1:44:18] you don't understand and you thought the
[1:44:20] world would never go on you thought you
[1:44:22] would die in that condition you thought
[1:44:23] you would never make it you thought you
[1:44:25] would die in that depression or that
[1:44:26] Darkness but all of a sudden you flip
[1:44:29] the page and there's another chapter
[1:44:30] there written over your life the chapter
[1:44:32] of this message that revealed to you who
[1:44:34] you were the chapter that made it all
[1:44:36] make sense in your life oh you see
[1:44:38] brother Brandon was preaching he was
[1:44:40] preaching he was preaching out the
[1:44:42] greatest battle ever fought and there's
[1:44:44] a little girl that he refers to many
[1:44:45] times throughout that message and he
[1:44:48] comes to the end he said but Lord I'm so
[1:44:50] glad that there's another chapter
[1:44:51] written we can turn another page and in
[1:44:54] this page we see the great physician
[1:44:55] come in we're calling him for counsel
[1:44:58] this morning oh Georgia Carter was just
[1:45:00] a few pounds 30 some pounds but one day
[1:45:03] the Lord spoke to the prophet and said
[1:45:04] go by the way of Carter's and to open up
[1:45:07] another chapter in her life a chapter of
[1:45:09] Health a chapter of Life Florence
[1:45:12] Nightingale was only about 40 pounds
[1:45:14] whether Brandon said she was just a pile
[1:45:16] of bones but one day the prophet came by
[1:45:18] her way and crossed paths with Florence
[1:45:20] Nightingale and he prayed for her and
[1:45:22] she held his hand he said brother
[1:45:24] Brandon have brother Brandon pray that I
[1:45:26] might die but brother Branham couldn't
[1:45:28] pray that over her life but he prayed
[1:45:29] for her her and all of a sudden the
[1:45:31] spirit of the Lord spoke and said thus
[1:45:32] saith the Lord you'll not die but you're
[1:45:34] going to live Florence Nightingale in
[1:45:36] another chapter opened over her life a
[1:45:39] chapter that that tied the loose ends
[1:45:41] together and gave her a health and some
[1:45:43] of you brother William you went to Camp
[1:45:44] one year you were Desiring the Holy
[1:45:46] Ghost and maybe you didn't know it was
[1:45:48] for you but all of a sudden another
[1:45:49] chapter opened up and it gave you what
[1:45:51] you were looking for the whole time
[1:45:52] isn't that right brother Joseph Adams
[1:45:55] one day you went to camp and you thought
[1:45:56] maybe it wasn't for you that that that
[1:45:59] those around you were receiving it but
[1:46:00] it wasn't for you but I'll send another
[1:46:02] chapter opened up over your life and now
[1:46:04] you know what it's all about now it's
[1:46:06] all starting to make sense those loose
[1:46:08] ends are starting to tie together all
[1:46:10] the things that you never understood
[1:46:11] when is my product going to return when
[1:46:14] am I going to get the Holy Ghost it
[1:46:16] looks like the end is right here but all
[1:46:18] of a sudden God flips over the page and
[1:46:20] there's a chapter of healing there's a
[1:46:22] chapter of Deliverance there's a chapter
[1:46:24] of prodigals returning is a chapter
[1:46:26] where you the gene seed of God are
[1:46:29] pulled into the fulfilled helmet pulled
[1:46:31] into the body of Christ that the Rapture
[1:46:33] can go it can't go without everyone he
[1:46:35] will not lose the one of his don't wait
[1:46:37] oh it may look like the end but flip the
[1:46:39] page and watch it all make sense watch
[1:46:42] those loose ends tied together watch you
[1:46:44] don't watch that chapter of your life
[1:46:45] begin to bring all all the fears and all
[1:46:48] the darkness begins to come together and
[1:46:49] you realize who you are you realize why
[1:46:52] you went through those things you
[1:46:53] realize your identity in Christ in that
[1:46:55] final chapter when it all begins to come
[1:46:57] together all those loose ends in your
[1:46:59] life begin to tie together and all of a
[1:47:01] sudden it all makes sense God was
[1:47:04] guiding you the whole way and he was
[1:47:06] going to tie it together and the thing
[1:47:07] about a day Newman is that when you come
[1:47:10] to the end it says one of the most
[1:47:12] important pieces since this is the
[1:47:14] ending the audience has been waiting for
[1:47:15] throughout the story often this is the
[1:47:18] part readers must remember from the
[1:47:20] story and which lingers in the minds
[1:47:22] long after they finish reading or
[1:47:24] watching we're living in an hour where
[1:47:27] things are taking place in your life
[1:47:29] that you're going to remember when we're
[1:47:31] on the other side of Glory when we're
[1:47:33] fellowshipping when we're on that supper
[1:47:34] table things that happen in that final
[1:47:37] chapter you're going to remember on the
[1:47:39] other side the great things that God has
[1:47:41] done in your life how he picked you up
[1:47:42] out of this age how we saved you how he
[1:47:45] elected you how he's how he kept
[1:47:47] faithful to you every time how he
[1:47:49] performed every promise how he performed
[1:47:51] miracles in your life and in your church
[1:47:54] oh when we get to the other side that
[1:47:57] final chapter will still ring through
[1:47:58] your ears oh of the mighty things that
[1:48:01] God has done done
[1:48:05] you see brother Branham
[1:48:07] came to a place
[1:48:09] where the angel commissioned them
[1:48:12] said the commission was pray for the
[1:48:14] sick
[1:48:17] he said the question was insufficient to
[1:48:20] do it
[1:48:22] but what spoke back was for this cause
[1:48:24] you were born this is the means of your
[1:48:27] peculiar birth in life that you are to
[1:48:28] pray for the sick
[1:48:30] he couldn't understand it because his
[1:48:32] father was a drunkard because if he
[1:48:34] would try to drink a bottle of alcohol a
[1:48:37] voice would come and would keep him from
[1:48:38] doing it and he would be called a
[1:48:40] for it he didn't understand it because
[1:48:42] he would walk down the street and he
[1:48:43] would get made fun of not because of
[1:48:45] anything he had done because the
[1:48:46] reputation of his family was so bad that
[1:48:49] he couldn't walk down the street without
[1:48:50] getting made fun of now who would go to
[1:48:52] school and he wouldn't even have to have
[1:48:54] it he couldn't even have a shirt he'd
[1:48:56] have to wear a coat just so he wouldn't
[1:48:57] be embarrassed and he'd have to sit
[1:48:59] around that fireplace and burn up
[1:49:01] because he didn't have a shirt and he
[1:49:03] thought my how could I fulfill this
[1:49:04] commission I have all these
[1:49:06] insufficiencies
[1:49:08] but a voice ran back and said for this
[1:49:10] cause you were born this is the means of
[1:49:12] your peculiar and birth in life because
[1:49:14] I've called you to be the seventh angel
[1:49:16] messenger because I've called you to
[1:49:18] fulfill Malachi 4 because I've called
[1:49:21] you to fulfill this this is the means of
[1:49:23] your peculiar birth and life in us we
[1:49:26] come into this day and we come in this
[1:49:27] age and we've been commissioned to live
[1:49:29] in the darkest days there is we've been
[1:49:31] commissioned to fulfill the very
[1:49:33] Ministry of Jesus Christ in a bride body
[1:49:35] we've been commissioned a Rapture but
[1:49:37] the question in your mind is
[1:49:38] insufficient for the job I have all
[1:49:40] these problems I have all these mistakes
[1:49:42] I was born in a broken family I can't
[1:49:45] even talk right I can't even make
[1:49:46] friends I have all these complexes I
[1:49:48] have all these fears and I have all
[1:49:50] these complexes in these depressions I
[1:49:52] have all these things and the question
[1:49:54] in your mind is insufficient for the job
[1:49:56] but The Voice rings back and says this
[1:49:58] is the means of your peculiar birth in
[1:50:00] life this is why you can never fit in
[1:50:02] with others this is why you always fell
[1:50:04] out of place this is why there was
[1:50:06] something and you're always drawing you
[1:50:07] something more this is what this
[1:50:09] explains that filter in your life this
[1:50:11] explains that deep calling to the deep
[1:50:12] in your life while you were always
[1:50:14] miserable in the world why you're always
[1:50:16] miserable outside and just a religious
[1:50:18] spirit this explains that peculiar birth
[1:50:21] in life because you were called for a
[1:50:23] commission this is it because you've
[1:50:25] been commissioned and you're sufficient
[1:50:27] to fulfill this is the means of your
[1:50:30] peculiar birth in life this is the means
[1:50:32] of all why you're an oddball why you
[1:50:34] don't fit in with the world why you
[1:50:36] couldn't fit in with that denomination
[1:50:38] because you are a chosen generation a
[1:50:42] royal priesthood a holy nation A
[1:50:43] peculiar people that you should show
[1:50:46] forth the Praises of him who have called
[1:50:47] you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous
[1:50:49] Light
[1:50:50] you see Jesus was born for a purpose
[1:50:53] and he was the only one that could
[1:50:55] fulfill it
[1:50:56] but he had to make the decision in the
[1:50:58] garden
[1:50:59] am I willing to do the will of God
[1:51:02] because a voice could come back
[1:51:04] brother Brandon said it might have been
[1:51:06] like this let's think maybe it was I can
[1:51:08] hear him say son
[1:51:09] do you desire to go to Calvary
[1:51:12] there's a band waiting for you there's
[1:51:14] persecution there's death and murder
[1:51:15] laying in the way
[1:51:17] there's exposure of your own body
[1:51:19] they'll strip the clothes off of you
[1:51:20] they'll beat you into pulp they'll pull
[1:51:23] a crown of thorns over your head and
[1:51:24] you'll die screaming for Mercy should
[1:51:26] you go on
[1:51:28] skipping down a little bit brother Brian
[1:51:30] says Jesus when you looked up into the
[1:51:31] face of the father he said it's not my
[1:51:33] will
[1:51:34] it's yours be done what a decision the
[1:51:37] decision anchored and swept the world
[1:51:39] and still comes tonight to every
[1:51:40] penitent Soul not my will but thine be
[1:51:42] done because he had a people in mind he
[1:51:45] said devil you've held fears and chills
[1:51:47] over the people long enough you've held
[1:51:49] them long enough I'm gonna go because
[1:51:51] I've got a people in mind that need this
[1:51:53] they need this blood that I could work
[1:51:55] through them that I could fulfill their
[1:51:57] part of the word through them that I
[1:52:00] could give them a blood that would cover
[1:52:01] them and he knew he said you've helped
[1:52:03] you've fooled people long enough get
[1:52:05] back in there where you belong he said
[1:52:07] you can't keep them any longer there
[1:52:09] will be people who will believe me you
[1:52:11] can't bind them up with sickness you
[1:52:13] can't bind them up with fear they will
[1:52:14] believe Hallelujah they knew there was a
[1:52:16] Rahab that was going to be out there to
[1:52:18] receive it and he stepped in he stepped
[1:52:21] to the pain he stepped through the fear
[1:52:22] I think of brother Ron how the Lord
[1:52:24] would speak to him and say and say if
[1:52:26] you trust me I'll use you like never
[1:52:28] before What a Mighty commission that was
[1:52:30] but he had a he had a trust he had to
[1:52:33] step into a place to trust Lord I
[1:52:35] surrender to your commission I surrender
[1:52:37] to what you have for my life though it's
[1:52:39] hard though it's not easy though I go
[1:52:41] through hardships and trials I'll
[1:52:42] surrender to the commission oh and
[1:52:45] brother Brandon said that's why he can
[1:52:47] walk to the platform he said I do enough
[1:52:49] in an hour to go to hell he said I've
[1:52:51] done enough and to die in an hour I'm a
[1:52:54] sinner to begin with he said don't you
[1:52:55] fear I'm looking who's told me don't you
[1:52:58] fear stand there for this cause you were
[1:53:01] born I raised you up for this purpose
[1:53:03] then all devils in hell can't make me
[1:53:06] move I'm standing there on Christ that
[1:53:07] Solid Rock
[1:53:09] oh if you step into that Commission
[1:53:12] according to the blueprint of the word
[1:53:14] you're sufficient for the job you're
[1:53:17] sufficient to go all the way you're
[1:53:19] sufficient for Rapture and this is the
[1:53:21] means of your peculiar birth in life
[1:53:23] if the musicians come
[1:53:25] and with the story the song leader comes
[1:53:30] brother Matt Morse and Arkansas tells a
[1:53:32] story
[1:53:33] one time he was in Indiana
[1:53:36] eating lunch with a group of people
[1:53:39] a group of brothers and they begin to
[1:53:40] tell testimonies about brother Branham
[1:53:42] they just begin to tell testimonies
[1:53:43] about all the things the Lord has done
[1:53:45] and
[1:53:46] testimonies about this message
[1:53:49] and a man walked up and said you
[1:53:51] wouldn't happen to be talking about
[1:53:52] William Brandon would you and he said
[1:53:55] yeah actually that's exactly what we're
[1:53:56] talking about he said okay okay I
[1:53:58] wondered
[1:53:59] he said let me tell you this story
[1:54:03] they only knew him as William they
[1:54:05] didn't even know him as a preacher they
[1:54:06] knew him as an as an electrician
[1:54:09] is it my grandma and my grandparents
[1:54:11] they owned a store downtown here in
[1:54:13] Indiana
[1:54:14] and William our brother Brandon would
[1:54:16] come he would come to the store
[1:54:18] and he would he would play checkers and
[1:54:21] and he would get a cold drink on a hot
[1:54:23] day or a hot drink on a cold day and he
[1:54:25] would just go in there and just fell a
[1:54:26] ship with her family he said one day he
[1:54:30] come to my grandma and he said would you
[1:54:32] please take me to your boy would you
[1:54:34] please take me to your boy you see the
[1:54:36] boy had polio
[1:54:38] and they said sure you know yeah he's
[1:54:40] upstairs and and that would be great for
[1:54:42] you to meet him I'll be glad to take you
[1:54:44] to him and so she took him upstairs and
[1:54:46] he said well thank you I appreciate that
[1:54:48] can I have a few minutes alone with the
[1:54:50] Lord
[1:54:51] just to pray about this and said well
[1:54:53] sure you know that seems a little odd
[1:54:55] maybe she didn't understand it but sure
[1:54:57] so brother Brandon stay up there and
[1:54:58] prayed for a while
[1:55:00] and he'd come back downstairs and he
[1:55:01] said thank you I appreciate that and I
[1:55:04] want you to do a favor for me he said I
[1:55:07] want you to set another place setting at
[1:55:08] the table for tonight's dinner
[1:55:11] and she said oh all right I'll be happy
[1:55:13] to do that and she starts to get excited
[1:55:14] and she her husband's coming home from
[1:55:16] work and says you know what something he
[1:55:18] said uh uh Williams coming back for
[1:55:20] dinner tonight brother branham's coming
[1:55:22] to visit us for dinner and so that's odd
[1:55:24] he didn't tell me anything about it he
[1:55:25] said yeah well he told me to set another
[1:55:27] place tubble at the setting and so she
[1:55:29] sets it and she gets excited and they
[1:55:31] sit down and they're waiting for that
[1:55:33] company and they just begin to gather on
[1:55:35] the table and hold hands and pray
[1:55:37] and she says he begins to start praying
[1:55:40] and thanking the Lord for all that he
[1:55:42] had done in their lives it began to
[1:55:44] start thanking the lord for what he had
[1:55:45] done in their family while his boy
[1:55:48] sitting up there with polio he begins to
[1:55:49] start thanking the Lord for all their
[1:55:51] blessings and while they're praying all
[1:55:54] sudden they hear footsteps coming down
[1:55:55] the stairs
[1:55:59] and that boy who had been in that
[1:56:01] crippled condition for the first time
[1:56:03] takes his place at that table
[1:56:05] and they just begin to thank the Lord
[1:56:07] and I think my
[1:56:09] his condition was so so dark his
[1:56:12] condition was so helpless I imagine he
[1:56:15] laid up there sometimes in that bed and
[1:56:17] heard his parents talking he thought I
[1:56:19] wonder if I'll ever be a part of what
[1:56:21] they're talking about I wonder if I'll
[1:56:23] ever be a part of their daily plans I
[1:56:25] wonder if I'll always be in this
[1:56:27] condition in this prison what felt like
[1:56:29] a prison this prison of fear this prison
[1:56:32] of Darkness this prison of of depression
[1:56:35] this this prison of helpless conditions
[1:56:37] I wonder if I'll always be here Mom was
[1:56:40] downstairs at the table talking about
[1:56:42] the Holy Ghost Daddy's down there
[1:56:44] talking about the rep Rapture and I
[1:56:46] wonder if that's for me I wonder if I'll
[1:56:48] ever be able to join them at that table
[1:56:50] and realize that it's for me I wonder if
[1:56:52] I'll always be stuck in this cage of
[1:56:55] confusion and fear but all of a sudden
[1:56:58] one day
[1:56:59] a man come by his way and he crossed
[1:57:02] paths with something that could change
[1:57:04] everything he crossed paths with the
[1:57:06] reality and like that eagle that's in
[1:57:09] that cage beating his brains out brother
[1:57:11] Brown said you're helpless just as
[1:57:13] helpless as you can be unless somebody
[1:57:15] puts forth his hands and opens the cage
[1:57:17] he said I'll tell you tonight Jesus
[1:57:20] Christ has done that and calling you
[1:57:22] open the cage to let you out this young
[1:57:25] man was in the helpless condition one
[1:57:27] day there came a call that opened the
[1:57:30] cage and he come down those stairs and
[1:57:33] Mama sitting at that table and Daddy's
[1:57:35] sitting at that table and pastors
[1:57:37] sitting at that table and all these
[1:57:39] years he's wondering if it's for him and
[1:57:41] there's another empty chair there and he
[1:57:42] said who's that for oh that's for you
[1:57:45] it's for you
[1:57:47] that tugging in his heart will I ever be
[1:57:49] able to join him at that table will this
[1:57:51] Rapture will I ever know if it's for me
[1:57:53] well this holy ghost ever before me but
[1:57:56] God's calling on your life open that
