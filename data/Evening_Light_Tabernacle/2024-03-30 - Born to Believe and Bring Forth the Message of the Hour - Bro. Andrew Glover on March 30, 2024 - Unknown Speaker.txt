come this morning in a special way Heavenly Father Lord as your children have gathered here this Saturday morning Father we've not come here out of Lord tradition Lord but we've come here because there is a deep calling to the deep and Lord as we gathered here the first night and begin to hear your word and Lord word has come on top of word Lord we have come here to receive more of you and I know every devil in hell has done everything they can to defeat this young people to defeat this generation from receiving more of you but Lord we're so thankful that you sent a prophet in this generation that told us that if we had a desire for more of God then that meant there was more of God for us to have and Lord I believe here this morning that you are the inexhaustible Fountain and Lord I believe your riches are unsearchable and this morning as we Endeavor Lord to open your word and look into the things that you've sent in this generation I pray you would send the spirit of Revelation in the building today Lord may you bind the hand of Satan as he would try to hinder Lord your children in any way from receiving from you I pray that you would send Liberty oh God lord may you send Freedom into the church this morning that we could yield to the power and the presence of the Holy Ghost I pray that sick would be healed today Lord I pray that bound would be set free I pray that empty Hearts oh God would be filled with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost Lord forgive for us of our failures forgive us of our shortcomings Lord we ask you this morning now have your way Among Us meet every need oh God in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen how many is happy to be a Christian this morning amen is't it a wonderful day to serve the Lord amen to be alive and well this morning and we want to say God bless you all we sure greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning and thank the Lord for the opportunity to be here once again thank brother Tim brother Timothy and the church for the hosting these meetings and all the work that's gone into this Camp through the years I have to say this morning it's a real uh a real special morning for me to be standing here I was studying and reading a little bit last night and just praying there in the cabin and brother Tim I couldn't help but think I sitting there hold my little boy and amen just a few days ago seemed like sitting over there in the other dorms and here as a camper and amen to stand here this morning and God's blessed our life give me a wonderful wife and a little boy and amen I received the Holy Ghost at this camp amen met my wife at this camp and now we've had the privilege to return and amen bring our little boy back here and amen I tell you this message is powerful and it works amen it's a it's a it's a powerful message and if you'll yield your life to it amen God will open the windows of Heaven amen it'll pour a blessing out upon you and so I I want to say thank you brother Tim for holding the standard high and persevering to have these meetings we say God bless you this morning and Amen brother Ron brother Danny it's an honor to minister with you all and amen as a as a as a camper amen here and them Minister amen and then to have the privilege to stand beside him and minister with him it's such an honor and humbling this morning and amen I have to say I received the Holy Ghost actually under brother Danny's Ministry amen ministering here in the camp and amen just a real special time this morning but I come here this morning to do one thing and that is to tell you if he did it for me he can do it for you amen he he's the same yesterday today and forever his word never fails amen amen if you have your Bibles this morning we want to go to the Book of John the 18th chapter The Book of John the 18th chapter we're going to read in the 37th verse of John 18 and then we're going to go to the Book of Luke but here in John 18 and verse 37 the Bible here says now pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then and Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world so Jesus was not questioning his purpose he knew his purpose to this end was I born and for this cause came I un the world that I should bear witness now what unto the truth and everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice amen I love that everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice now if we go to the Book of Luke the first chapter the book of St Luke the first chapter it's a very familiar reading and it's a little lengthy but I pray you give me Grace this morning amen it's a very beautiful reading it's where the angel of the Lord visits Mary and the Bible here records to us the conversation between the angel and Mary and in the 26th verse the Bible says in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to virgin espouse to whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying watch this and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end now I want you to notice something here after all those things that the angel tells Mary here in the 34th verse but Mary said un the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee I believe that Holy Ghost is right here in this building this morning the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God Amen I want you to catch that born of thee and behold thy cousin Elizabeth shall also conceive a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called baren for with God nothing shall be impossible now watch and Mary said behold the hands made of the Lord be it unto me according to the word to Thy word and the angel departed from her amen I also want to look at one other verse in the Book of Mark the 9th chapter The Book of Mark the 9th chapter and the 23rd verse I know this morning that we could read this by heart here today in St Mark chapter 9 and verse 23 and Jesus Jesus said unto him let's just read this together St Mark 9:23 and Jesus said unto him if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning amen I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments today if I would title this today I want to speak to you for a few moments on born to believe and bring forth the message of the the hour amen born to believe and bring forth the message of the hour I say this this morning thank God for sending us a Vindicated Prophet messenger with an absolute message to this generation we're not gathered here this morning wondering hoping guessing presuming but we are standing here upon Vindicated word that Jesus Christ is not in a tomb in Jerusalem he's not on a cross at Mount Calvary but he's right here in the power of his resurrection to do exact what his word said he would do you know yesterday morning we heard it put so beautiful that it's time to fight how many can agree that right now amen is the time to fight it's the season to fight it's the hour to fight and I've just been been pondering this quote from the message the power of transformation brother BR says now we're ready for a battle the trumpet is to sound the hymns have been saying now comes the word so there's the trumpet there's the singing and then the word he said but to hear these comments of these young soldiers here how many how many young soldiers do we have this morning Amen to hear the comments of these young soldiers here he said myself getting old and listen around in your faith amen and confidence in what you placed into believe that the message I have been given of God he said now if it wasn't for you all the message would do no good amen see it's got to be somebody to believe it and as long as it's coming from God then there's going to be somebody believe it as long as the message is coming from God there's going to be somebody believe it you see God has made a way he has affixed his economy like that when he sends for something amen there is something there to meet that something so God Amen does not send a message without there being somebody Amen to receive or to meet the promises or the challenge of the message he's sending he said see the Deep responds to the call of the deep amen it's God to be that way now Paul says it very beautiful in 1 Timothy 2 he said this cause also we thank god with without ceasing because when you received the word of God which you heard of us amen you received it not as the word of men but it as the truth see the word of God which effectually worketh also in you amen that belief so the word is not here to work in the unbeliever it's not here Amen to work in the make believer but it is here to work in The Believer amen because a Believer believes the word it's like somebody asked a man one time they said what are you he said I'm a Believer they said why are you a believer he said because I believe he said why do you believe he said because I am a believer now now now that's probably going in circles but there's a reality to that amen that the only thing a Believer knows how to do is believe we don't know how to guess we don't know how to question we don't know how to reason the only thing we know how to do amen is to believe the word that God has sent in the age we're living I want to say this we must receive amen and believe the message on the same degree or level amen it was delivered in now let me say this it was not delivered casually we heard that last night amen it was not delivered in a lukewarm manner amen but it was delivered with a passion it was it was delivered with a Zeal it was delivered with a fervency amen and I say this morning what we need amen is that same power that same fire amen that same fervency to come down amen upon this generation to believe the things that God has done with all of our hearts now amen I'm laying a foundation BL Braham was actually convinced he was not guessing amen but he was convinced amen that his message amen was of God and from God he said I am thoroughly convinced that my message comes from God I am thoroughly convinced it's not my own fleshly mind puffed up amen it is the word of God another place he said truly friend I believe with all my heart with all my faith amen I believe that my message comes from God it's been proven to you that through the years another place he says now that's what we're here for that that's my message has been all along is the word of God can we establish that amen that the message of the hour is the word of God he said we must hold on to that regardless of what others think is taking place always stay with that word see always check our motives and our objectives if it is according to the word of God if it isn't leave it alone but if it's with the word of God Amen and lines up with the word of God then you hold on to that the other place he says I'm thankful to have people like you all amen what would my message be amen if I had nobody that believed it amen there is people here that you would die for it amen for this message we've got he said may you not forget that you're a part in that Resurrection amen the quickening power is now in you it's all settled amen you are God's child amen this message was the announcement amen that quickening power is not coming amen but quickening power is here and I'll say this morning amen we are not looking for the Holy Ghost we are in possession this morning of the Holy Ghost we are not looking for the anointing amen we have the anointing we are not looking for the truth we have the truth we are not looking for a message amen we have a message come on Church we're not looking for a prophet amen there's been a prophet Among Us who has been identified by the same Pillar of Fire amen that led Moses and led Paul has returned in this generation Amen to lead the seventh angel amen but hey may I not stop there amen but may I say that same Pillar of Fire amen is in this building this morning and he is accompanying every word believer who believes this message to be more than the ideas of a man or the traditions of a church amen this is the message of Deliverance now when brother tells us how that when God gives a messeng or God speaks he says when he speaks to a man according to Hebrews 1 I believe he still speaks amen cu the Bible said half in these last days spoken somebody say spoken SP half in these last days spoken unto us amen by his son whom he appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds now that word spoken is a very powerful word it means to use in words in order to declare one's mind and to disclose one's thoughts amen so when somebody speaks amen what they're saying is moving from a fault into a word now when that word is spoken amen the only way you can know what's in their mind amen is the word be spoken to declare what's in their mind amen can I preach this morning and the prophet of God said what was in God's mind amen is now in God's church amen if you want to know what was in God's mind this morning amen open your eyes and look around you amen because you're not just sitting next to another teenager amen but you are sitting next to the materialization amen of the thoughts of the almighty god of what he had in his mind amen has now come into manifestation I love what the prod of God says when God speaks to a man he gives him a purpose he gives him an ambition amen and he gives him Faith to do it and to accomplish or to achieve amen what his purpose in life is amen what God called him to do see he's called us to be in the Church of God how many can agree this morning there is a purpose upon your life amen that this message has given you an ambition amen this message has given you Faith Amen to fulfill the purpose that God has ordained your life for now I love St John 18 37 maybe if it' be okay just to read it to you from the Amplified Bible it says so pilate said to him amen then you are a king and Jesus answered and said you say correctly that I am a king but this is why I was born see amen for this cause I have come into the world Amen to testify to the truth everyone that who is of the truth who is a friend of the truth and belongs to the truth amen hears and listens to my voice carefully amen everyone who is of Truth Who belongs to truth and is a friend of Truth amen will hear the voice of God Amen and they will not hear it halfhazard amen but they will hear it brother Daniel carefully and they will receive it carefully amen and what they will do is they will not just hear it they will not just receive it amen but they will give their lives back Amen to what they've heard and what they've received and I say this morning young people you have been born of Truth you have not been born of Lies you have not been born of sto stories amen you have been born of Truth the prophet of God said we're so glad to know amen where our birth comes from we are not born of the will of man we are not born of the will of flesh but of the will of God Amen see we're born of the will of God so a prophet has identified our purpose amen for being born and here's what he says we are born to believe the word of God we are born to believe Jesus Christ amen can I get a witness here this morning amen we are born to believe the word of God we are born to believe Jesus Christ amen see we were born to believe the message of the hour amen now let me say this there's something in you amen and what's in you brother B says what's in you is what says the message is real amen now think about that amen your flesh won't say it's real amen your spirit sometimes won't say it's real amen but there is a seed of God on the inside of your soul amen who is a friend of Truth who has come from truth Who belongs to truth truth and when that seed receives this message the only thing it can say Amen is that ain't nothing but the truth oh I say this morning Satan Thou Art defeated in the name of Jesus Christ you have no strongholds you have no powers you have no chain strong enough Amen to defy this generation we have not come here as a bunch of chickens we have not come here as a bunch of church members we have come here as the sons of Truth as the friends of Truth we belong to truth you don't belong to depression you don't belong to the world you don't belong to society you don't belong to complexes you don't belong to fear you don't belong to nervousness but you belong to truth and my Bible said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free well you know what I think it's time to do I think it's time to get some Elbow Room in the house of God I think it's time to kick that old cold amen formal ritualistic ungodly devil out of the house of God and bring back the liberty of the Holy goes where the power of God and the truth of God and the anointing of God and the quickening of God Amen can brood across the congregation and release to you an ambition released to you a purpose we've not come in this age to be defeated we have come here as the children of God we are the friends of Truth we belong to truth amen and there's something in us that's saying this message is the truth thank you buddy amen I say this morning thank God we have a Vindicated definition of what the message of the hour is we don't have to ask you we don't have to ask me we can ask a prophet he said many of you hear these remarks a message of this hour so forth what they are getting at amen is God's promise of this hour so the message of the hour amen is what God has promised to do in the present hour that he promised what he would do now I love what brother says he said I have to stay amen under the anoint of the holy spirit amen to find find what the message of the hour is amen I love that so it's not coming out of an idea it's not coming out of a feeling it's not coming out of a sensation but the definition of the message is coming out from under the anointing and you know what the Bible says the Bible says the anointing amen shall destroy the Yoke well you know what I say there's a bunch of yolks amen but there's an anointing amen that's greater than every yoke and I say this this message amen will destroy the Yoke of sin it will destroy the Yoke of fashion it will destroy the Yoke of Hollywood come on Church it'll destroy the Yoke of confusion it'll destroy the Yoke of iniquity hey we got a message and it's the king's message and it's the message of Truth and somebody this morning ought to turn loose of every idea contrary Amen to the truth and receive the truth come on Amen you've received enough lies you've received enough negativity you received enough excuses amen why don't you kick them excuses out of the house of God and let the anointing of the Holy Ghost come in amen come on well I can't I can't I can't amen but the message says you can well I won't I won't I won't but the message says you already have well this is against me and that's against me amen but if God be for you and who can be against you hey there is an anointing in the message of the hour that'll destroy the Y of the enemy and will release a prisoner from the prison or release a sufferer from the suffering hey I'm talking about the oldfashioned Holy Ghost it comes in a meeting and destroys the Yoke of the Enemy by the truth by the truth the anointing is the truth and the anointing shall destroy the Yol you know what the devil the devil don't like it but I'm going to say it amen I don't believe brother Ron I don't believe anointing is breaking yolks I believe the anointing is destroying yolks because there is a difference in something being broken and something being destroyed amen if you break something there is a possibility somewhere somebody amen can put it back together but if you destroy it amen it is beyond the hope of ever being repaired if you destroy something you might as well throw it away amen don't put it out in the shed Amen to use later amen throw it away because it is beyond repair and I want to say this morning the anointing has stepped in this building today Amen to destroy the oak amen of fear to destroy the Yol of complexes to destroy the Yoke of insecurity Amen to destroy the Yol of sickness and when that yoke has been destroyed we ought to throw the thing away we will never wear the Yoke of leoy again because the anointing has come in power has come in Liberty and has destroyed that thing hey the message of the hour has come to us amen from under the anointing he said Lord Jesus just like you did before you was crucified that they might know that the message of the hour is truly amen you have risen from the dead another place he says the message of the hour is to repent and turn back again to the faith of the father in The Token he said the message of the hour is a sign Amen to the churches it's a sign the people in the identification of Christ he said the message of the hour is amen return back to the word amen that was a Vindicated definition of the message that come from under the anointing amen I might as well say it I'm here the Propet of God said we're not come together Amen to talk about the message amen but we are come together to get in the message and the message is Christ he is the word now watch what a prophet says we are to get into it and we are to get beneath it we are to get into the message but we are also to get beneath it now when you get beneath something that means whatever is above you is what's controlling you when you get that when you get beneath something that means that has become your headship it has become your direction it has become your absolute it has become your anchor I feel like preaching this morning it has become your vision listen it has become your future and I say this morning church amen you ain't got to go read Grandma's Almanac Amen to find out about your future you ain't got to go read the horoscope in the Daily Newspaper Amen to find out about your future but behold I will send you amen Elijah the prophet and he will have a Vindicated message that will come from under the anointing listen Church the message of the hour is your future can I say what is your future Victory is your future Rapture is your future power is your future anointing is your future joy unspeakable is your future peace without underc comprehension hallelujah amen it's all in your future and it's come to us by the message of the hour my when I think about that amen say thank God thank God for the message of the hour thank God we have an absolute thank God we have an anchor thank God we're not following everything that comes by come on church thank God we ain't fallowing every spirit and every idea that floats through the air we have an anchor we have an absolute we're tied all to the right thing then no world can pull us no false ideas can pull us come on young people sometime or another you got to realize that this message is your purpose come on you were B amen I'm might have to borrow this heard brother bis said one time he said the message of the hour amen is not your objective he said the Rapture is your objective he said the message of the hour is God's purpose to get you to your objective and I'll say this this morning amen our objective is not tribulation our objective is not a lukor church our objective is not a bunch of church members with another idea but our objective is the change of our body amen some morning between 6:00 and 9 there's going to come a sweep over this generation listen and the only way we're going to step amen from one dimension to another is by the anointed message of the hour it's the truth I said it's the truth amen have I got any friends of Truth here this morning have I got any believers of Truth here this morning you can identify that the anointing has told you the truth now when you think about this the Bible said that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by what the word of God brother said the word of God made manifest I love the Amplified Bible on Romans 10:17 so faith comes from hearing what is told somebody say what is told and what is heard comes by the preaching of the message concerning Christ so what is being told is what's being heard and what's being heard is what's being told so what's being told and heard is the message oh God concerning Christ amen I love acts 27:25 the Bible says wherefore sir amen be of good cheer for I believe God listen what he says that it shall be even as it was told me there's that word told again from the Amplified he says so keep up your courage men amen for I believe God and have complete confidence in him that it will turn out exactly as I have been told in other words what the angel told Paul was exactly what would be in the manifestation of the vision so there would not be one thing in the vision and another thing in the manifestation but the same thing in the vision will be the same thing in the manif come on church amen do you realize there can't be victory in the vision and defeat in the manifestation there can't be power in the vision and lukewarmness in the manifestation but whatever was in the vision is going to be in the manifestation and may I say this God has sent a promise in this generation who has seen a word Vision over you young people and he said listen I saw all them over there I saw millions of converts there but in the rising of the sun he says but I seen you there come on church I ought to make you shake off every devil out of hell and say Satan you ain't got enough to stop me I have had a vision that's been told to me by the angel of God through the seventh angel and he said he didn't see me in hell he didn't see me in the tribulation he didn't see me with the Enemy having his foot on me but he saw me Amen in the vision of Victory he saw me in the vision of rapture so you know what I'm going to do I'm going to yield to the anointing I'm going to yield to the truth and every day I'm going to take one step and another step and another step until one of these days I step out of time until one of these days I step out of mortality and step back into immortality listen I didn't come from hell so I ain't going back to hell I came from God and I'm going back to God and there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough Devils on the earth there ain't enough Spirits out of pits of Hell to stop me and to stop you from going back to where you come from before you was born the truth already claimed you well come hail or how water are we going to make it amen you didn't know you was coming to preach but Char look at somebody and say we going to make it come Peril we're going to make it come unbelief we're going to make it come bad days hard days up days in days out days good days sad days sick days Jo we're going to make it amen because there's a vision of the word of God that has been spoken over our lives and we have received it as the word of God I love that word told brother said oh don't you just love that it'll be as it was told me if the angel truly comes from God and is sent from God it's bound to be it's a direct message from Glory young people that's not just a book on yourself that's not just an app on your phone that is a direct message come on church amen that is a direct message from glory in other words God has sent you something direct and it's not got one flaw in it it's not got one idea of a man in it it is the word of God made manifest listen it's not the fleshly mind of some man puffed up it's the message of the hour can I say this Mary amen received a direct message from glory and the pr of God said now there's angels of the Lord men them they come to the Earth and they bring messages somebody say messages but when Gabriel comes something Big's fixing to happen now watch what the prophet of God says and he told Mary thou has found favor with God what a message to bring her thou Hast found favor with God can I say this we have received amen a direct message it was given from the mighty angel of Revelation 10:1 delivered by the seventh angel of Revelation 10:7 can I say this who was met by the angel of the Lord Brother said and that angel was a supernatural being he said when he be to speak to me he said he be to make statements to me and I have not been disobedient Amen to the heavenly vision so in other words the mighty Angel begin to speak to the Heth Angel and the statements he was making were Supernatural statements can I say this a supernatural God Don't Make natural statements a supernatural God makes Supernatural statements and Supernatural means something that is transcending amen the course of nature can I say this amen and he was not disobedient to what was delivered to him amen I love this brother I'm speaking of the farmer sewing wheat he said now if that farmer amen takes the seed and receives it he said if he keeps digging it up he'll never have wheat he said you just sew it and let it alone see it's up to God to bring it forth listen that's why we have don't have a prophet today Amen on the earth in a physical body brother br's not here today amen going from every church amen trying to sow the message and trying to find a crop no he stood here on the platform and soow the entire word seed of the Bible into the church listen young people amen amen oh God can I preach amen amen he was the prophet amen but now the attraction has turned from the prophet Amen to the prophecy young people he was looking for you he was looking for this day he was looking for this generation come on church he was looking for a people who could take his message and not dissect it and not pull this out and put that in he was looking for a young man that would say it's the truth brother Brandon he was looking for a young girl that would say that's what he said and if I got to lose every friend I've got I'm want to stand on the word of God because it didn't come out of the Seminary it came out from under the [Music] anointing come on church amen Amen brother Josh Bennett forgive me brother Josh amen he was preaching our church other day and he made a powerful statement he said do you realize we're we're understanding things today he said that years ago when a prophet stood here and preached that people didn't have a clue about and when he said that I mean you know how the devil does when he said that an Old Devil come right by me and kind of tap me on the shoulder and said now how could that be and and just just under the inspiration brother Josh anden the Holy Ghost just spoke out of me and I literally looked over at the devil in the middle of the meeting sometimes you got to talk to the devil cuz he's trying to hinder you from a good service okay I just looked over at the Devil and I said future home Billy Paul I'll get to you later so I got in my office that Old Devil showed up again and I said devil amen you're t on with the wrong dude Amen brother B stood there and preached future home and Billy Paul walked out of there and said I understand it he said did you really he said no Daddy brother said I could count on my hand amen five people in the entire building that could understand what I was talking about listen church but here's a youth camp God here's a youth camp and it's not built on a bunch of Pentecostalism it's not built on a bunch of gifts and sensation it's built on the preaching of the message of the hour and there's about 400 young people that can take a hold a future home they can take a hold of the Rapture they can eat things that are to be listen you are the prophesied generation who's going to tear the kingdom of hell down by the anointing of the prophecy that's been spoke over your life we don't we're not here confused we have a clear understanding we are understanding things that Generations long to understand now that same Prophet said that faith is a substance of things hope for he said now what is faith is this okay is God by the spirit revealing to you something he's going to do or he's promised so faith is a revelation of the will of God then you see you hear the word and God reveals it to you that it is the truth and by Spirit revealed truth confirms your faith to God I love this other definition he says face power somebody say this with me face power brings to pass God's revealed Revelation the power of Faith brings to pass the revealed revelation of God can I say this to you faith is a revelation of God from God you don't work yourself up into faith if you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God see that's the real Revelation is that God keeps his word I'm turning a corner because this is the rapture generation and the only way you can take a Rapture is by Revelation now watch what a prophet says that's why the bride must have amen rapturing Faith now can I say this to you young people and don't ever forget it okay it's rapturing Grace and rapturing Faith it's not rapturing works is that okay it's rapturing faith and rapturing Grace it's not so in other words you're not going to get good enough to wor to make a Rapture you're not going to read enough to make a Rapture you're not going to memorize enough to make a rapture the only way we're going to make a Rapture amen is by receiving what the Revelation has revealed in the age we're living come on church amen we're not trying to pray our way in this Rapture we're not trying to fast our way in this Rapture come on Amen we're not even trying to shout our way in this rapture we have accepted amen the message of the hour as the power of God to take a mortal and transform him into immortality and by that revelation we are stepping from one dimension to another for by grace are you saved amen through faith now listen amen I'm a message preacher so if it's okay I'm going to preach the message amen I believe the only way in Rapture is by the message if you lay this message aside and you start trying to dabble in some denominational charismatic idea you will be left out amen but you are a word born bride who must stay with this word listen young people you're not going to take the Rapture by the way you feel come on you're not going to take the Rapture amen by the way things are going in your church you're not going to take the Rapture by the emotions of the crowd you're going to take the Rapture by the word of God can I say this brother Ron on the morning of the Rapture amen we may get up and look in the mirror and be the worst night we've ever had feel lower than a snake's belly and more unsaved than Cain we may have the devil telling us we're nobody we're nothing amen but listen amen if there is a revelation on the inside of your soul that has been placed there by the anointing that this message was deliver to you in it don't matter how you feel on the morning of the Rapture there's going to be a change oh Hallelujah when I feel like dancing there's going to be a change one of these mornings and the old is going to become Young and the dead in Christ are going to rise hell get out of my way devil if you couldn't stop me then you won't stop me now the revelation of Rock Stream faith has already struck my heart I'm walking in the steps of Enoch I'm walking in the faith of God I'm walking in the grace of God manifesting the promise of God hallelujah if there's going to be a Rapture and you got to have Rapture and Faith to get in it then God is required to provide what it takes to get there brother Ron that'd be that'd be like me calling you up and saying let's go on a trip where we going we're going out Colorado we're going to go out there in el hunt I'm gonna take you brother Ron let's go okay you buy the gas you buy the tags you buy the food you fill up the truck you buy the truck buy the fourwheeler so we can get them out or horses one or two buy all the ammo buy all the clothes buy me all the food come on brother Ron I'm going to take you but but come on buddy let's work come on work for me get me there no if I invite him into it oh god I've got to provide What It Takes Amen to go to the destination and I can oh God if I call him and invite him that I have claimed him as my responsibility I've got to cover everything oh God you didn't call God at the altar and say God will you take me in this Rapture but before the foundation of the world God called you to take a Rapture listen we're not around here trying to work something up to take it no God has provided the fuel he has provided the food he has provided the clothes he has provided everything that we have need of to make this Rapture and you know what it's going to take it's going to take the word of God having a preeminence In the Flesh of the Bride to change her body it's already paid for Hallelujah I said it's already paid for the gas is in the tank the keys are in the ignition the anointing is upon you listen and right here this morning the devil cannot stop it from [Applause] happening now if God requires it then God must provide what it takes to get you in it can I say what the prophet of God said we're able to pull the pages back but we're not able to open the word but thou are the only one who can take this word and thou art the only one that's worthy of opening the word the lamb that was slain from before the foundation of the world oh Lamb of God come into our midst tonight can I say today in the power of thy resurrection and give us Rapture and faith can I say this rapturing faith comes from the opening of the word now young people I feel that devil pushing back at me but I'm not scared of him amen this is a generation that Daniel spoke of it's time to move out of ankle deep water it's time to move out of knee deep water it's time to move out of HP deep water it's time to get in some swimming Waters it's time to step over in the third pool come on Church the first and second pull was not ours but the third pull was on the other side of the Jordan and a prophet of God said that where all the promises laid come on generation you're not a first pool generation you're not even a second P generation you are a third pool generation who has received amen the mind of Christ by the voice of the seventh angel that is declared and has disclos what was in God's thoughts now if this open the word is going to come it's going to move this bride into what a prophet called a bride age 1954 he's already referring to the coming of it he says now we're moving right on into another great age amen coming for the Rapture of the church and in this we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts it stumbl many of our big fine churches sent nazarine backward made Fanatics out of a lot of Pentecostal but just the same amen God is moving right on Amen bringing in the Rapture of faith for his church so justification made way for sanctification which made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost which have indicated Prophet said made way for the Holy Ghost itself to come into the church listen you cannot can not dismiss justification and be a fully restored bride you cannot dismiss sanctification and be a fully restored bride and you cannot dismiss the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the restoration of the gifts amen and be a fully restored bride and neither can you rest oh God and neither can you deny the message of Malachi 4 which is The Headstone or the Capstone to the body listen it's a rock of offense to the world but to the Bride of Jesus Christ it is that's her headship oh what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying the only place brother says we can get rapture in faith is in the word now I love what he says he says we got to have it young people don't ever forget this okay brother said but don't worry it'll be there we got to have it so don't worry it'll be there now what are you saying well Revelation 10 is this okay Revelation 10 speaks of the mighty Angel the Bible says the other brother said from the scripture he said the other Angels was Messengers men of the earth he said but this angel said the angel the Church of leot and the other Messengers prophets and so forth but see this one didn't come from the earth he come down from heaven because the mystery is all finished and when the mystery is finished the angel said that time shall be no more now watch this and seven Thunders throwed out their voices now come on generation this is a part of your word this is a part of your promise what's a prophet what is it something to let us know how to enter into the rapturing faith can I say this amen accepting by Grace the Vindicated word is God's provided way to bring the Believers into the rapturing favor of almighty God now can I read Revelation 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come up from the earth is that what it says come out from behind the skies or come out come out from behind the trees no I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was up on his head and his face was were the sun amen and his feet is pillars of fire amen can you give me that first picture Amen in 1963 amen we had this appear in Arizona now come on I'm not here to argue debate it it was [Applause] there come on born to believe the message and to bring forth the promise of it that cloud was there and a man didn't do it a church Didn't Do It come on somebody amen a school didn't do it but almighty God did it and I don't care who disagrees I don't care who disapproves you have come too late see I believe the message and the prophet of God stayed under the anointing to bring me a definition of what I am believing from the word and here's what he said he said it's our Lord up there and he walked to a pull pit in 1965 and said now we've had a lot of questions about this we've had a lot of ideas he said some have seen Angels some have seen figures he said but the angel of the Lord come in the room and said turn it to the right now when we turn that picture amen there he says oh God and when he says that an audible gasp goes across brandom Tabernacle you know what's happening the word of faith is coming in the church that's going to change their body come on Amen I tell you what the devil didn't want the devil didn't want you to see that picture the devil didn't want you to hear the revelation of that picture because when you see that picture as the head Shi of the body it's going home time when you see that it don't matter how you feel it don't matter what you think when headship comes to the body it's time to leave this earth for come on generation get out of Facebook get out of all the sports things get out of all the video games and get your head back in the message of the hour your headship is here brother Thomas how we going to make it how are we going to take it our ride is here glory to God our ride is here come on Church you're in the train station flesh and R of sign of is coming you're in the train station and you're eating peanuts and you're not paying attention to church and you're not paying attention but all of a sudden you hear the sound and the Propet of God said throw down the peanuts and get up your ride is here come on young people I'm not riding you into an eighth age I'm riding you by the word of God into the change of your body some morning oh word is going to release this old pest house and we're going to be changed get up get up get up in Jesus name I don't care what's happened I don't care who said what I don't care who done what get up and whip that devil in

here get up get up get up in Jesus name now if you can leave that there for me there was a cloud appeared but the next thing he had in his hand a little open book now Revelation 5 that book was closed go read it when you get back to your cabin okay but in Revelation 10 it is now opened and when he cried with a loud voice when a lion worthy cried and seven Thunders utter their voices and when the seven Thunders utter their voices I was about to write but I Heard a Voice from Heaven say unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not brother said I believe we'll find where it's written rapturing faith in the word we didn't know what they are yet but my I love can I can I give you some prop prophetic English Kentucky hillbill English is that okay I believe in my opinion they'll be revealed right away and brother Matt and when it do that's my kind of language Malachi and when it do it'll give faith for rapturing grace for that church to move out come on church we ain't waiting on Rapture and Grace we've already got it we ain't waiting on Revelation we've already got it it ain't time to sit there and get stale and get sour and get lukewarm it's time to move come on the move is on for the bride that is thus sayith the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and you know what I say I say if the move is on for the bride I'm a part of that bride then that tells me the move is on for me the move is on for you when he shall begin to sound in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound when he shall begin to declare when he shall begin to disclose what was in God's mind there will be a people on the Earth I'm turning the corner now there will be a people on the Earth Pro Prophet God said this now the messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children back to the CH back to Hearts of the children back to the fathers number two here we we go he will reveal now I'm saying this to you for a purpose okay I'm laying some word in the word Seven Seals and seven Thunders and third pull and open the word is not a denomination come on young people now listen we ain't a Baptist camp this morning we're a message Camp so let's let's lay in the word okay the word coming into you is what is effectually working but the only way it's effectually working is if you're believing it in other words it can be here and it is here you heard it Thursday night you heard it Friday morning you heard it Friday night amen you heard it this morning are you hearing me but until you yield to what's being presented it will have no effect upon you I love what the pr of God says he said this will bring amen another search of the holy spirit in the church for a rapturing faith just before it comes now what is this third pull it is the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going way of the church listen the third pull will put the Rapture in process can I say this young people this is your opportunity this is your opportunity to have your own Revival according to the word of God he said now watch there's no hope for the church outside of the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I love this quote devil hates it but I love it and tonight the only hope of the church is to get away from their man-made theologies well somebody shout hallelujah get away from their man-made theologies and get back to the Holy Spirit are you ready for this and get the spirit back in the church well we might as well preach with this close to it get the spirit amen back in the church now listen the word is here and if the word is here there will be a dynamic that will strike the mechanic right if the word is here there will be a Dynamic strike the mechanic and that will be the thing that will move the train out of the train station what are you saying preacher I'm saying it'll take a profit to bring the spirit of God Amen back in the church he said and get the church straightened out I'm turning the corner if that's okay is that okay we have the headship thank you we have the message we have Vindicated word we have the return of the Holy Ghost that has been bound by the denominational Rivers for 2,000 years young people amen you God how can I say this you're sitting right in the middle of it you're sitting right smack dab in the middle of the restoration of the word and the return of the pure holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost brother Ron it's not something that has been and it's not something that's coming brother Tim it's something that's right now and I say it's high time to get out of our recliners and throw our peanuts down and dip down our get out of his ease inide and get back to the spirit of God until the word of God can burn out everything in our lives that's unlike him come on church I'm just going to say what a prophet said y'all know brother BR wrote a church age book and in that church age book he wrote an audio letter to brother lale and he says these words remember says this in order to Proclaim this he has to send a prophet in order to inject this to make this real again and what's he doing to show the people the hour we're living in without a pro Prophet there is no reality in the church but if a prophet comes he's going to inject the word oh God back in the church he said because if they only see it in the hour pass then there's no hope for the church the church must see it in the present tense can I say this to you we can see what he did in Moses we can see what he did in David we can see what he did in shamgar we can see what he are you hearing me we can see what he did in Samson but that's a p hour come on church we can see what he did in Georgia Carter we can see what he did in hady R we can see what he did in Upshaw but that is a past hour come on Church well in the future we're going to eat the L we're going to eat in the table the marriage of the lamb and the Lamb's going to lay by life amen and that's in the future and that's the trick of the devil is to get you to look at what has been and look forward to what we'll be and come all the way down to Dry Creek Louisiana and sit there like a bump on the pickle I'm going to preach and let some old devil of heaviness and depression and unbelief and fear and skepticism and criticism amen bind the Holy Ghost but you know what I say I say Satan give way to the spirit of God give way to the Holy Ghost give way to the power of God coming in the church in Liberty in Dynamics come on Church he's not

God I'm this close to it and I feel that spirit so I might as well push against it cuz it's pushing against me well I don't know why they got to go to youth camp to get all that Liberty I don't know why they got to go down there well listen if you'd give them some Liberty might get it there if we get back to preaching the message and quit trying to correct everything and just say what a prophet said it would bring some Liberty back in the church that a young person could get the Holy Ghost somebody could get delivered you know what I say I say House of Hell give way to the message of the hour to the manifestation of the name of God in the power of his resurrection Satan I adure Thee take your hands off of God's Property and give them some Liberty give them some Elbow Room give me some shout room give me some praise and God room I ain't an old dead bound up tied up wed up ungodly ritualistic Christian I am a holy ghost filled fire baptized Malachi for preaching pillar of our following Son of God and we won't back up and we won't lay down we will not Retreat we will charge that devil give us some [Music] Liberty push and push and pushing well it's time to push back it's time to push back that Devil's held us long enough that Devil's held your health that Devil's held your family that Devil's held your joy that Devil's held your peace that Devil's held your miracle that Devil's held your deliverance that Devil's held you long enough but I'm doing what Joshua said he said everywhere the soul of my footsteps upon I have been given a right Amen to claim it and I'm walking through this building right now and I'm claiming another miracle Brad I'm claiming another healing I'm claiming another somebody to get the Holy Ghost I will not lay down I will not back up

preacher you better be careful no you got the wrong guy up here I said you got the wrong guy up here you don't like praising God I'm able to throw the microphone down and dance for 20 minutes just to show you you ain't going to shut up my praise you ain't going to seal up your anointing talk about me ridicule me call me what you want to but when it's all said and done I was born Hallelujah I was bored to bring forth the power and the promise of God in the age I'm living in I refuse to shut up I refuse to quit quoting the prophet I refuse to say well that was brother bram's idea I refuse and you know what I'm saying I'm saying young soldiers it's time to get some grit about you I said young soldiers it's time to get some grit about you [Applause] devil don't like that one either well get

I was I remember one time in school we was reading a history lesson about a battle and if IID have paid more attention I could give you some names but thank God for open book test I made it out inside joke you'll get that later I remember one time we had studying and while we were studying there was a War battle going on and there was something I never will forget they come to the general of the captain of whoever I I can't remember his name I wish I could I tried to find but they come to him and they said now listen we got to retreat and we got to devise a way to retreat and you know what he actually did he actually looked at him and laughed come on they shall narrowly look up on him and and laugh Isaiah 14 they they looked at him and laughed and you know what he said he said why would I waste my time making a way to retreat when I could be using that time to whip the enemy well glory to God somebody shout aloud in the house of God listen I ain't going to go in my study and try to find a different way to say what a prophet said I ain't going to come out here and tipto around quotes and scriptures to try to preach this message I have come here without the word Retreat and I'm going to stand here and say I Will Not Waste one second of pull pit time trying to come up with a way to retreat when I can draw my sword and you can draw your sword and we can whip some devils It's Time to whip the devil young people we're anointed to do it we're young soldiers my God is not dead my God is alive somebody say he's alive he's well he's here he's moving he's saving he's healing he's delivering he's giving the Holy Ghost he's defeating the enemy he's here he's here he's here here he's not in a tomb come on Church he's not in a grave he's here this morning in the form of his word now amen amen you give me five minutes and I'm going to tie this together you have to fight against that devil okay the message has come to you Mary okay now can I say this to you the message of the hour to Mary was a hard message prophet of God said like this he said it was something more outstanding for hard to her to believe than anything else but you all know that Mary was a prophetic woman and we are a prophetic class of people now watch this the word am I I'm hurrying the word the word had been spoken over Mary and said behold a virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son and shall call his name Emmanuel brother said 715 years before it happened Isaiah the prophet said that there's no doubt that everyone in that age thought their daughter would be that woman because Isaiah said it but here's the problem a father couldn't make his daughter that because God had already oh God God had already borrowed Mary's womb by predestination in other words Mary didn't make herself the Virgin to bring forth Jesus she was born she was born the Virgin to bring forth the promised child watch a prophet he said now she was in a horrible City but God chose her for a certain work now this is what astounds me brother Tim brother B says that God borrowed the womb of Mary he said to come into the world he had to borrow a womb right he said to leave the world he had to borrow a grave now now young people I know this is going to be hard to do okay but I want you to help me for a second I want you to wrap your mind around this thought that God borrowed he owned everything created everything but yet he still had to borrow the proud of God said now watch he said then again he must be the Seed of Abraham see and Abraham if you can catch it he had faith in God which United the spirit of God with the Flesh of man there's where the faith come there's why he could be the Abraham seed not all flesh but United the spirit and flesh together now here's where I'm going god making himself somebody say God making himself tearing out rooting out all evil and bringing into submission the flesh the dust he created to live with you as a partner God created Mary to carry his promised word seed son and then brought her flesh in the submission to do what he bored her to do what do you say brother Andrew I'm I'm saying when Mary and I'm closing on this point when Mary said these words the angel began to talk to her and he he he appeared like this and he says now good evening friends I mean he says I'm just having fun now he said good he said Mary you're a virgin a spouse to Joseph but what's in you is of the Holy Ghost now listen when he first started talking oh God when he first started talking Mary still had some flesh in her you know what she was saying she was saying how could this be seeing I know not a man but you know what I love before Mary had the question oh God the angel had the answer and the more that Mary submitted to the voice of the Angel oh God the more her flesh becomes so weak that she could no longer argue with the message when the angel started talking she had some questions she had some reasons why God couldn't use her she had some reasons and excuses but when God got done delivering the message the only thing she could say was be it unto me come on Church according to Thy Word in other words she oh God the Angel's message brought Mary's body into submission to the word of God to bring forth the promise what are you saying I'm saying the word borrow means to taking you something now oh God give me some Grace here taking you something something that belongs to someone else with the intention of returning it now listen when you borrow something you've got to take in the consideration the condition of it when it's returned so like brother Tim if I asked to borrow your pickup truck and you see my pickup truck and it's rusted out and ain't got good tires and food all in it and tore all the pieces you're going to be hesitant on loaning me your pickup truck because you know what kind of condition it could Poss possibly are you hearing me in other words there's a hesitancy of loaning something because you're worried about what kind of condition is going to come back in but can I say this God borrowed Mary's body oh God and she willfully gave it to him and the pr of God said he borrowed a womb that God used no more than any other woman see he might use your W your heart to declare his son if you would just let him do it now can I say this Mary was a part of God's law of presenting and yielding the Bible said amen that you would yield your members unto God as instruments of righteousness in other words you loan your members to God and God takes them and he uses them I love this I love this quote the pr of God said now flesh s now there's no need you pretty little thing you pretty little girl in school now don't you pay any attention to that old Holy Roller mother of yours or that fanatic father see you're the best looking girl in school you're the prettiest boy best looking boy Best Built you're the most popular is in the city and you yield your members to that and where do you come out at the end of the little horn every time but the law of the spirit of God in the heart overcomes the Flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do can I say this to you brother said find out what God wants to use you for and then yield yourself to him making you the human instrumentality of God to bring forth or to accomplish the promise of his word I promise I'm closing on this Jesus came in the earth and he claimed a body right the word made flesh he has left the Earth in a Corporal body but I say this we got a prayer line coming tonight right amen I say this to you amen my Lord is not a dead God who cannot produce more testimonies because he is not here in a Corporal body does not mean that somebody cannot receive the message he sent believe that message and manifest the promise s said listen we are left as we understand to carry on his work that he has to accomplish his death at Calvary he was with us he went from come out of God in the world went from the world into God and come again in the form of the Holy Spirit and is with us in us to the end of the world carrying out in his church the same work he did when he was here on the earth what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying when something is presented you must yield to it right do you know why an alcoholic becomes an alcoholic because somebody presented them alcohol and they yield it to the alcohol they gave their members to it and they let alcohol borrow their body and destroy it amen you know why somebody becomes a drug addict is because somewhere somebody presented some drugs now hear me and they yielded their body to those drugs and they become a drug addict can I say this to you you know why guys become sports stars it's because somewhere somebody presented them an opportunity to yield their body to the god of sports come on now and they'll go out there and blow their knees break their backs bust their necks come on I'm preaching to you now the god of sports has borrowed their body and is destroying it and you know what he's going to do he's going to use it use it use it use it use it and when he can't use it no more he's going to hand it back to him he borrowed it but he didn't take into consideration the condition it would be in when he returned it oh god brother Ron but when God borrowed us when God borrowed us he will use us for his anointing he will use us for his word he will use us to destroy Devils he will use us in prayer lines he will use us in the pull pit he will use us in the doorm he will use us on our job he will use us in school he will use us to whip 200,000,000 Devils come on Church he's going to use you young men to defeat pornography he's going to use you young girls to defeat pornography come on God is going to use you and you know what sometimes it's going to be a war sometimes you're going to have to get in your prayer closet and pray out amen and cry out to God come on but can I say this when God used Mary oh God I'm feeling good when God used Mary he used her put her through criticism ridicule all kinds of gains saying criticism gains saying everything could be said but brother M when God got done with Mary he didn't throw her back in the city of Jerusalem and say go fend for yourself but he carried her to the upper room oh God before he borrowed her he already made a payment arrangement to repay her for using her body come on church he carried her to the upper room and he filled her with the life of the one she was carrying oh God in other words brother Tim this word we're carrying it's not cheating us of life it's not ridiculing us amen we're carrying this word and one day this word oh God hallelujah one day this word let's carry it we're carrying this word we're carrying it to school we're carrying it on the job we're carrying it to pull pits we're carrying it across the country and one day hey this word we're carrying is going to carry us out of this Dimension I'm talking about a God who has borne you to believe this message brother Ron I defy that devil in the name of Jesus Christ and I say Satan you ain't destroying Ron Spencer's body God borrowed your body God borrowed this man's body right here in the middle of Satan's Eden to prove he can have a stroke he can go through a fire he can go through heart attacks and then he can diagnose him with stage four cancer but he still stands here come on Church you think it's easy traveling all the way down here amen he's wearing his body out come on Church he's wearing his body out but can I say this God has got obligation God has got obligation to repay whatever he borrows he will not return it back a cancer ridden stricken body with scars from fire come on my God will repay are you hearing me my God Is A Healer my God is a deliverer my God is a savior and you know what I say I say you've yielded yourself to the God of this evil age long enough and he's used everything you've got he's used your mind he's used your lips he's used your hands but I come here this morning on a commission from God Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I serve you vix and notice take your hands off of every member in this body this morning my Lord Jesus is going to repay with blessings oh Hallelujah it don't matter how weak you get it don't matter how tired you get because there's a bond of security by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ron Spencer he will repay
