[1:00:02] treated us royally and it was great
[1:00:06] great Genesis and Grace's host and um
[1:00:10] you know we uh of course we had that
[1:00:12] wonderful time together with them and
[1:00:14] his church is located just minutes from
[1:00:17] the Swiss border and so they hosted the
[1:00:20] meetings and I so appreciated their
[1:00:23] wonderful hospitality and you've enjoyed
[1:00:27] Brother David mayor Minister and here
[1:00:30] and and he's quite the speaker as you
[1:00:32] know and so we were we were blessed by
[1:00:37] um you know just having some time
[1:00:39] together and fellowshipping together and
[1:00:42] being able to minister he rented a hall
[1:00:43] for the meetings because he came in from
[1:00:46] all over from Germany over from
[1:00:49] um uh Belgium and from I think maybe
[1:00:54] from Holland and England some amazing
[1:00:57] some real efforts to just fly across the
[1:01:00] over into
[1:01:02] um
[1:01:04] from England over into Geneva and come
[1:01:08] over into France for the meetings there
[1:01:10] and and that was our brother Peter
[1:01:13] Chandler and also brother Jr by by Vega
[1:01:16] who ministers in his church and he came
[1:01:18] over to interpret the services into the
[1:01:21] French language
[1:01:22] and this allowed us to preach to people
[1:01:25] that we don't normally reach as you know
[1:01:28] I'm just not real good in the French
[1:01:29] language
[1:01:30] and it reaches a whole a whole new
[1:01:34] audience of people and so I've been
[1:01:38] invited to come there and also we had
[1:01:41] friends came over from Germany the
[1:01:43] family of my good friend brother Sigmar
[1:01:45] Colin Brian or Colin Brenner they were
[1:01:49] they came over his widow Sister Irene
[1:01:52] and two of his sons and a daughter and I
[1:01:56] was able to minister them and especially
[1:01:58] to his widow because brother Sigmar
[1:02:01] passed away coming up a year this
[1:02:03] December from covid and and the Lord
[1:02:06] called him home so it gave me a real
[1:02:08] opportunity to minister that family and
[1:02:11] we love them and appreciate them and and
[1:02:14] their love for the Lord and their desire
[1:02:17] to serve him
[1:02:18] other other notables that were there was
[1:02:22] um brothers friends house Francois
[1:02:24] lipicar of Switzerland and Brother David
[1:02:27] Iverson from Belgium and brother Peter
[1:02:30] Chandler from England and we just had a
[1:02:33] wonderful time ministering to the people
[1:02:35] I think they gathered from France and
[1:02:38] Switzerland and Germany and Belgium and
[1:02:41] uh and many other places around and we
[1:02:44] streamed to far away countries some
[1:02:46] entire churches just um joined in with
[1:02:50] us for the meetings and so we just had a
[1:02:53] great time together we had nearly 800
[1:02:56] connections every service where we were
[1:03:00] reaching some of them would represent a
[1:03:02] church of 200 people or so that we were
[1:03:05] ministering to
[1:03:06] so it gave us a tremendous opportunity
[1:03:09] to to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:03:12] and encourage the bride of Christ
[1:03:14] you know we have a responsibility for
[1:03:16] that we're not in this alone and I'm
[1:03:19] glad we're not alone you look around and
[1:03:22] you see who sits next to you aren't you
[1:03:24] glad you're not here by yourself
[1:03:25] amen but there are others who love the
[1:03:29] Lord and encourage you in the present
[1:03:32] truth and and God has a bride from every
[1:03:35] Kindred and tribe and tongue and nation
[1:03:38] and people sometimes you know you wonder
[1:03:41] well brother Tim why would you be
[1:03:42] interested in them why don't you just
[1:03:44] tend to your own little church and and
[1:03:47] why would you be interested in them
[1:03:48] because you know no matter how ready
[1:03:51] that we might be to or think we're ready
[1:03:54] to go and we're ready for the Rapture uh
[1:03:58] the Rapture is a little different from
[1:03:59] getting the Holy Ghost you get the Holy
[1:04:01] Ghost you can be the only one to meet
[1:04:02] against the Holy Ghost
[1:04:04] but um when we come to Rapture we're
[1:04:08] taking everybody
[1:04:09] they're not leaving a hoof behind and
[1:04:12] we're all going together at the same
[1:04:13] time
[1:04:14] so you know if if I can help somebody
[1:04:17] else get dressed and ready then that's
[1:04:20] what we want to do Amen to encourage
[1:04:23] them to to move forward in the things of
[1:04:27] God Amen good to see you sister Helen so
[1:04:31] nice to have you must mean the baby is

[1:04:41] love back to brother Abe we we love him

[1:05:20] they were able to remove that and
[1:05:22] they've done some some uh some radiation
[1:05:25] treatments there on on that area and
[1:05:28] she's progressing being able to
[1:05:31] you know she because she lost the use of
[1:05:34] her Limbs and so she's progressing able
[1:05:38] to use them more and more and we're just
[1:05:41] believing that step by step that she's
[1:05:44] just going to walk right into a a well
[1:05:46] body amen so that's what we do is we
[1:05:49] hold before us the image of a perfectly
[1:05:52] healed person and then step by step we
[1:05:56] walk into that
[1:05:57] so today is just another step along the
[1:06:00] journey amen I saw brother James lingo
[1:06:03] there with his two sons got to meet them
[1:06:06] at the at the sale the other day and and
[1:06:09] got to shake their hands and they said
[1:06:11] this is the difference kind of church
[1:06:13] than what we've been to said you know
[1:06:15] this and we don't get bored here and so
[1:06:19] you know there's always something that
[1:06:21] is happening we just thank God for
[1:06:23] working on their lives and they see what
[1:06:26] God did for their daddy they know God
[1:06:29] can do that for them amen as you know
[1:06:32] God took and transformed his life in
[1:06:34] just a moment and that's the power of
[1:06:37] our Christ to be able to do that and to
[1:06:40] change a life and that's what it's about
[1:06:43] you know um preaching of the Gospel is
[1:06:45] casting out Devils amen and that's what
[1:06:48] happens when you get saved the devil is
[1:06:50] cast out and God comes in to live in the
[1:06:54] life and there's a king on that throne
[1:06:56] and if you get heal it's the devil cast
[1:06:59] out not that you were a devil but that
[1:07:01] the Tormentor had to leave so we know
[1:07:04] that that's the power of the of the
[1:07:07] blood of Jesus Christ and what he is he
[1:07:10] is able to do for us and and so you know
[1:07:14] it's good to be home next weekend I'm
[1:07:16] going to be gone again by the Timothy
[1:07:18] and I are going to the wedding of Joshua
[1:07:20] and Alexandra Pruitt they're getting
[1:07:22] married on next Saturday and um I
[1:07:25] believe you know to do what we can to
[1:07:27] try to invest in our young people and so
[1:07:29] I want to be there for them in that they
[1:07:32] ask me to be a part of that wedding so
[1:07:35] we're going to do that and Minister for
[1:07:38] brother Wendell while we're there and uh
[1:07:40] so you know we we uh there's just a lot
[1:07:44] to do and the Lord has been with us
[1:07:46] every step of the way I want to thank
[1:07:48] you for your prayers I made it through
[1:07:50] the trip of 10 hours of across the sea
[1:07:54] that when all the travel actually it's
[1:07:56] 24 hours from the time you get up to the
[1:07:59] time you get in bed it's 24 hours from
[1:08:02] from bed to bed if you know what that
[1:08:04] means it takes 24 hours to get home 24
[1:08:07] hours to get over there but 10 hours of
[1:08:10] that journey is just in a in a seat
[1:08:12] going across the sea and the Lord was
[1:08:14] with us and was gracious and I I'll have
[1:08:18] to say I I had less pain and less
[1:08:21] problems than any time and I don't know
[1:08:24] how long amen so I thank you for your
[1:08:27] prayers
[1:08:30] hey man I couldn't help but think of
[1:08:32] that as I walked you know we'd go for a
[1:08:34] walk around some of the pretty lakes in
[1:08:37] Switzerland they'd let me take me out
[1:08:39] for a little walk every day and some
[1:08:40] walk about a mile and a half and come
[1:08:42] back in no pain I'll tell you it's the
[1:08:45] grace of God so I want to thank you for
[1:08:48] your prayers and believing with me and
[1:08:50] and praying for me I I tell you the Lord
[1:08:53] has undertook and we thank him you know
[1:08:56] I I don't have any
[1:08:59] granddose ideas that I will be
[1:09:02] feeling like I'm 15 years old again but
[1:09:06] um you know I want to feel pretty good
[1:09:08] for 68 right amen that's what I say to
[1:09:12] people a lot of times we pray for them
[1:09:13] and say well now take step by step into
[1:09:16] a perfectly well well body but you know
[1:09:19] if you're 70 years old don't expect to
[1:09:21] feel the 18 expect to have it perfectly
[1:09:24] well 70 year old amen so you don't get
[1:09:28] your expectations right because until
[1:09:30] we're changed we're going to still have
[1:09:32] a lot of aches and pains our 50 year old
[1:09:35] our new 50 year old up there brother Tim
[1:09:37] Winters come dragging in this morning's
[1:09:40] well I got a pain I said I I know what
[1:09:43] it means you know you're 50 now and it
[1:09:46] don't get better from now you know it
[1:09:48] gets uh you know and if you're you're
[1:09:52] laughing at us you'll you'll be here too
[1:09:55] soon too soon amen life just comes and
[1:09:58] goes just like that but you know living
[1:10:01] for Jesus is an adventure amen Walking
[1:10:05] with God is it's just going from glory
[1:10:08] to glory amen so we love you all and
[1:10:11] appreciate you all and and we just heard
[1:10:13] some wonderful things of the meetings
[1:10:15] that you've had you know the Lord has
[1:10:17] blessed us with such Convention Services
[1:10:21] time after time and it's just marvelous
[1:10:25] what the Lord has been doing in our
[1:10:27] midst and people say well you can't have
[1:10:29] services like that all the time who said
[1:10:33] amen who said you come under expectation
[1:10:37] God will move
[1:10:38] so you know you you expect God to move
[1:10:41] God will meet your expectations he
[1:10:44] responds to your faith so you believe in
[1:10:47] him with all your heart and surrender
[1:10:49] your life to him now I want to just pick
[1:10:52] up from the scripture from verse 9 of
[1:10:56] chapter 18 and read down to verse 15 to
[1:10:59] just kind of give us the context for
[1:11:01] where we're speaking today
[1:11:03] and I'm going to be speaking on the
[1:11:06] ripening maturing and the ripening of
[1:11:10] our faith so the maturing and the
[1:11:13] ripening of our faith you know Sarah was
[1:11:16] a woman that was a Believer but
[1:11:19] um you know she she had to have her
[1:11:21] faith ripened and had to have it
[1:11:24] directed because sometimes it would even
[1:11:26] be misdirected
[1:11:29] by reasoning into the wrong direction
[1:11:32] and of course that produced a new smell
[1:11:34] but anyway in this in verse 9 and they
[1:11:37] said unto him where is Sarah thy wife
[1:11:40] and he said beholden the tent and he
[1:11:42] said I will certainly returning to thee
[1:11:44] according to the time of life and Lo's
[1:11:47] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:11:49] Sarah heard it in the tent which was
[1:11:52] behind him now it tells her
[1:11:54] circumstances now Abraham and Sarah were
[1:11:57] old and well-stricken in age and it
[1:12:00] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[1:12:02] of women therefore Sarah laughed and
[1:12:06] within herself saying have I'm wax on
[1:12:08] shall I have pleasure my Lord being old
[1:12:11] also and the Lord said unto Abraham why
[1:12:14] for did Sarah life saying shall have a
[1:12:17] surety bear a child which him own is
[1:12:21] anything too hard for the Lord isn't
[1:12:25] that wonderful amen at the time
[1:12:27] appointed I will return unto thee
[1:12:30] according to the time of life and Sarah
[1:12:34] shall have a son and Sarah denied saying
[1:12:38] I laugh not for she was afraid and he
[1:12:40] said nay but thou did his life
[1:12:45] now today is we're looking at this
[1:12:49] every man and woman boy and girl that's
[1:12:52] born again of the spirit of God has a
[1:12:55] Measure of Faith
[1:12:56] in fact to matter you can't come to God
[1:12:59] except that you believe that he is
[1:13:01] and that he rewards those that
[1:13:03] diligently seek him
[1:13:05] and brother Branham made this statement
[1:13:08] that I think is still pertinent to the
[1:13:11] time that we're at
[1:13:15] I believe the church
[1:13:17] is beginning to hear the message
[1:13:20] and beginning to understand it but
[1:13:23] friend listen we got to lay in the
[1:13:25] presence of the Sun
[1:13:26] we've got to be ripened
[1:13:29] our faith isn't right now listen brother
[1:13:32] Brandon I'm saying this our faith isn't
[1:13:34] ripe
[1:13:36] intellectually we're hearing the message
[1:13:39] it says no we're not hearing the message
[1:13:41] but intellectually we're here now
[1:13:44] that God has given us and seeing the
[1:13:46] signs that he showed us and proven it by
[1:13:48] the Bible is there but all how the
[1:13:51] church needs to lay in his presence till
[1:13:54] it tenders up you know and gets sweet in
[1:13:57] the spirit so he can just bathe down
[1:14:00] sometimes in speaking the message you
[1:14:02] get harsh and have to break in like that
[1:14:05] because you've got to clinch a nail to
[1:14:08] make it whole but when the church once
[1:14:11] gets it and the elected is called out
[1:14:14] and separated then in the presence of
[1:14:17] God I know it will be something like the
[1:14:19] people were there when it takes the
[1:14:22] Rapture and in context he was speaking
[1:14:24] of when he went beyond the curtain of
[1:14:26] time and what was there was the fullness
[1:14:29] of the Holy Ghost so let me read it like
[1:14:31] this but when the church gets it and is
[1:14:33] set out and an elected and called and
[1:14:37] separated then in the presence of God I
[1:14:40] know it'll be like it was there with the
[1:14:44] fullness of the Holy Ghost when it takes
[1:14:46] the rapture
[1:14:48] so now again ripening doesn't mean that
[1:14:52] a mature Church won't have the
[1:14:54] supernatural works of God of healing and
[1:14:57] miracles and tongues and prophecy and
[1:14:59] shouting and dancing in the spirit that
[1:15:02] is not immaturity
[1:15:04] those things happen in a mature Church
[1:15:08] now rather ripening is to change our
[1:15:12] faith from an intellectual belief to a
[1:15:16] real living faith that works you see
[1:15:19] faith that doesn't work is dead
[1:15:23] amen so we want a faith that that is
[1:15:26] alive
[1:15:27] amen because you can have faith and it's
[1:15:30] dead
[1:15:31] because he said faith without works is
[1:15:33] dead faith so you can have faith if it
[1:15:35] doesn't have works it's dead but real
[1:15:38] faith is a living faith
[1:15:41] and that Living Faith produces works
[1:15:44] that follows that faith that proves is
[1:15:47] alive now you know it's one thing for us
[1:15:51] to say well Jesus is Alive the whole
[1:15:53] world is saying that but it's another
[1:15:55] thing for our faith to be alive and our
[1:15:58] faith has to be quickened or Made Alive
[1:16:00] in order for it to work
[1:16:03] now brother branham's gift was to tune
[1:16:07] the faith in other words you see that's
[1:16:10] what Sarah's Faith needed here it was
[1:16:13] all Out Of Tune
[1:16:15] and and it was tuned until it just had a
[1:16:17] dead sound it's kind of like somebody
[1:16:20] tuning an instrument a guitar you know
[1:16:23] and say well that that string is dead
[1:16:25] you know it's it's not ringing with life
[1:16:28] it's not making the right sound it's not
[1:16:31] matching the note and our our faith has
[1:16:35] to match the note of the Bible of the
[1:16:40] word of God Amen this is what we want
[1:16:42] God to do is to raise our faith up to a
[1:16:46] level where it matches what God's word
[1:16:49] said and when it matches what God's word
[1:16:52] said then you're healed or you're saved
[1:16:54] or delivered or whatever the need is it
[1:16:56] works when it matches what God's word
[1:16:59] said now some Faith you see like as
[1:17:03] Sarah's faith it was all Out Of Tune you
[1:17:07] can see here she's in the presence of
[1:17:09] God the almighty and us and has has to
[1:17:13] be asked of God himself is there
[1:17:15] anything too hard for me
[1:17:17] you see because she was still looking at
[1:17:20] things and it was too hard you know even
[1:17:23] for God it was too hard you know I it's
[1:17:25] it's impossible I'm old you know shall I
[1:17:29] have pleasure now with my Lord him his
[1:17:32] old also you know this is uh this is way
[1:17:35] out and she is kind of laughing or
[1:17:38] scoffing as she's hearing this because
[1:17:40] her faith is Out Of Tune
[1:17:43] and this is what's the matter with a lot
[1:17:45] of people in fact to the matter is when
[1:17:47] you get sick you know what happens there
[1:17:50] is the dampness of that unbelief comes
[1:17:53] along and the strings of your faith gets
[1:17:55] loose and it is not matching God's word
[1:17:58] in fact it'll start ringing out what the
[1:18:01] doctor said and you know beaten to that
[1:18:04] rather to what God's word said but it
[1:18:07] has to be tuned until it matches the
[1:18:11] level of God's promise now Faith of
[1:18:14] course will produce an atmosphere where
[1:18:18] that Miracles can happen
[1:18:20] amen faith will produce an atmosphere
[1:18:23] even where our bodies will change
[1:18:26] so you see in order for us to be changed
[1:18:30] we've got to be tuned up and we've got
[1:18:33] to be brought up into an atmosphere of
[1:18:36] faith and a believing that word that all
[1:18:39] things are possible and that there is
[1:18:41] nothing too hard for the Lord
[1:18:44] now brother Branham told us in the
[1:18:46] message of Moses he said now he said
[1:18:48] friend
[1:18:50] um he talked about his gift he said that
[1:18:52] doesn't heal nobody that only brings the
[1:18:55] person up in faith and then when the
[1:18:58] person's here he might come and tell me
[1:19:01] he's got faith and I take his word for
[1:19:03] it but when you're under the anointing
[1:19:05] as it is now you can't come and deceive
[1:19:08] that where I know when you've got faith
[1:19:10] or not he might think he has Faith
[1:19:13] there's a thing that people thinks that
[1:19:15] got faith when they haven't got a faith
[1:19:18] isn't that right when they're way down
[1:19:21] here saying they got faith and and it
[1:19:24] isn't up here it's like tuning a string
[1:19:27] on an instrument and when it comes up
[1:19:30] and coincides with this up here then the
[1:19:33] thing is ready and any demon listen to
[1:19:36] this any demon that's got that person
[1:19:39] bound has to turn loose when that kind
[1:19:42] of Faith Comes
[1:19:43] amen and he said you don't have to be up
[1:19:46] here it'll act out there Wherever You
[1:19:49] Are
[1:19:50] amen amen and you know that is true we
[1:19:54] had one great example it wasn't a prayer
[1:19:56] line it wasn't even hands laid on but
[1:19:59] right there as the word went forth and
[1:20:01] the singing went forth sister Lana
[1:20:03] sitting back in the mezzanine
[1:20:06] but in the atmosphere of Faith her faith
[1:20:09] got tuned to the level of the promise
[1:20:12] and she acted upon that and when acting
[1:20:16] upon that God healed her
[1:20:19] amen so it doesn't take even coming up
[1:20:21] for prayer that's good in that scripture
[1:20:24] but you can receive it right in your
[1:20:26] seat even the Holy Ghost can be that way
[1:20:29] I can remember you know as I was
[1:20:31] preaching a word the word many years ago
[1:20:34] and a man that was a backslider and away
[1:20:36] from God and and uh done some horrible
[1:20:40] things really hard to believe when
[1:20:42] you're a backslider makes it really
[1:20:44] difficult and so when they come back you
[1:20:47] know trying to come back and trying to
[1:20:49] believe and he'd picked up smoking and
[1:20:51] it was a bad habit and one pack after
[1:20:53] another that he and he couldn't lay it
[1:20:55] down and right there is I was preaching
[1:20:58] he screamed out I'm delivered I'm
[1:21:00] delivered I'm delivered never to pick
[1:21:02] that thing up again
[1:21:05] you see it's when our faith matches the
[1:21:09] level of God's promise and you just
[1:21:11] accept from him what he's done for you
[1:21:14] at Calvary now so you see in order to
[1:21:18] and now in order to have the end time
[1:21:21] you've got to have the spirit of the end
[1:21:23] time and of course we know the solemn
[1:21:26] world is in the spirit of the end time
[1:21:28] but so must the bride be in the spirit
[1:21:32] and the atmosphere of the end time
[1:21:36] I'm not talking about their fear their
[1:21:38] unbelief their sodomy I'm not talking
[1:21:41] about being in that Spirit I'm talking
[1:21:43] about the spirit of God that is Promised
[1:21:46] for an end time people where he said in
[1:21:49] the last days I will pour out all of my
[1:21:52] spirit
[1:21:52] [Applause]
[1:21:54] Hallelujah I'm going to empty the
[1:21:56] contents of it amen the pony in time
[1:21:58] people
[1:22:00] Hallelujah cause I've got an end time
[1:22:02] Plan and there's going to be a people of
[1:22:05] perfect faith
[1:22:06] a people whose Faith exceeds the face of
[1:22:10] any other age because it's a rapturing
[1:22:13] faith
[1:22:16] was saying how in the world are we going
[1:22:18] to do this just like it happened to
[1:22:20] Sarah
[1:22:21] because it was Grace it came by Sarah's
[1:22:24] way after all of those years of unbelief
[1:22:28] a man to turn her heart back to Faith to
[1:22:32] believe in again so it's a Rapture in
[1:22:34] Grace for a Rapture and faith
[1:22:38] amen how's God going to do it he's going
[1:22:41] to give you the grace for it his grace
[1:22:44] provides the faith for the going away
[1:22:48] you are a people favorite of the Lord
[1:22:51] and this is what the angel was coming by
[1:22:53] to tell Sarah you are favored you are
[1:22:56] called you are predestined this is your
[1:23:00] moment I am here for this reason this is
[1:23:03] why I'm appearing this is why Seven
[1:23:05] Angels were in the cloud this is why the
[1:23:08] seven Thunders Lord their voices this is
[1:23:10] why the book was unsealed this is why
[1:23:13] the Mysteries are revealed is because
[1:23:15] it's you that I'm getting your faith
[1:23:18] whether it's ripe for a rapture
[1:23:24] all right
[1:23:27] now so you've got to be
[1:23:30] in in time
[1:23:33] conditions under an end time atmosphere
[1:23:38] that's why Brothers of the message it's
[1:23:41] not going to take it's got it's got to
[1:23:44] be more than a Baptist atmosphere
[1:23:46] Presbyterian atmosphere you know an
[1:23:50] intellectual atmosphere is going to take
[1:23:52] a supernatural atmosphere for the Bride
[1:23:55] of Jesus Christ
[1:23:57] now in the message perseverance brother
[1:24:00] Branham said I want to speak on the
[1:24:02] subject to kind of build up that faith
[1:24:05] well
[1:24:06] you know brother Tim we don't need Faith
[1:24:09] anymore
[1:24:11] by the time we're too mature we're way
[1:24:14] too mature for faith
[1:24:16] well to you that are fallen behind
[1:24:20] you know brother Branham preached
[1:24:22] perfect faith
[1:24:24] and we don't just need faith
[1:24:27] we need a perfect faith
[1:24:30] that and that perfect Faith produces
[1:24:34] Apostolic times
[1:24:36] now brother Branham left here declaring
[1:24:39] that we are still in an Apostolic age
[1:24:44] I don't normally take off my coat but
[1:24:47] it's a little warm up here
[1:24:49] so I might as well
[1:24:54] amen
[1:24:57] now I want you just to think of this
[1:24:59] because we need a perfect faith that
[1:25:02] produces Apostolic times
[1:25:07] because we are in the final the finality
[1:25:12] of the pouring out of God's spirit
[1:25:15] so this is the crescendo
[1:25:19] of the apostolic age
[1:25:22] now so he said so he said here I want to
[1:25:26] speak on the subject to kind of build up
[1:25:28] Faith ministers knows that when you're
[1:25:30] speaking to the people you have an
[1:25:32] atmosphere of preaching for salvation
[1:25:35] then you want to make a a call that call
[1:25:37] to that and then if you want the
[1:25:39] atmosphere for healing you get to
[1:25:42] anointing Yourself by the word of God
[1:25:43] delivered to the people and that puts
[1:25:46] the whole group under and the anointing
[1:25:49] for a certain thing otherwise under
[1:25:52] expectations of certain things and we
[1:25:55] see we're expecting something so you
[1:25:57] know I believe then to bring that a
[1:26:00] little higher that God's got all his
[1:26:03] church now the called out remnant of his
[1:26:06] church under expectations of his coming
[1:26:13] so we're here under the expectations of
[1:26:16] his coming this is the age of harvest
[1:26:19] time this is the age of his coming
[1:26:22] the Harvest represents when the son of
[1:26:25] man comes and he harvests the Grain and
[1:26:28] takes it into the Garner the difference
[1:26:31] between this age and the early Apostolic
[1:26:33] age because we're not repeating
[1:26:36] Pentecost we are the continuation of the
[1:26:39] book of Acts
[1:26:40] not a reputation a repetition of the
[1:26:44] book of Acts we are not repeating
[1:26:47] Pentecost we are finishing Pentecost
[1:26:55] this is a day where the the day of
[1:26:59] Pentecost fully comes
[1:27:02] we have been in seven Church ages seven
[1:27:04] weeks which are the weeks of Pentecost
[1:27:07] but now we are in the final age and the
[1:27:11] final time where there's got to be a
[1:27:13] sheath waved in the end time of a mature
[1:27:17] elect bride of people who knows their
[1:27:19] word the word of God a people who does
[1:27:22] exploits
[1:27:24] now
[1:27:25] so he said I want to bring them under
[1:27:28] the expectations of his coming
[1:27:31] this is where we're at we're in a
[1:27:33] Rapture age
[1:27:34] where everything should be under the
[1:27:36] expectation of maturity
[1:27:40] mature Faith mature gifts materials how
[1:27:44] mature brother Tim on that healing till
[1:27:46] our bodies are changed
[1:27:48] come on
[1:27:49] remember we've still got a ways to go it
[1:27:52] ripening
[1:27:55] that's right now brother Brandon
[1:27:58] preached the sermon wisdom versus faith
[1:28:01] in somehow the devil is slipped in among
[1:28:03] us to lead some to believe that the Holy
[1:28:05] Ghost is just a learned behavior
[1:28:08] to them intellectual concepts are taught
[1:28:11] you mature by applying these Concepts
[1:28:15] the calling of the fourth of the Bride
[1:28:17] is not an intellectual Revival
[1:28:21] and that's seemingly what many have had
[1:28:24] for the past 50 years is trying to
[1:28:27] intellectually
[1:28:29] assimilate the message and brother
[1:28:32] Brandon said I believe you are beginning
[1:28:34] to do that
[1:28:36] intellectually hear it but your faith
[1:28:39] needs ripen it
[1:28:42] amen and I'll tell you after 50 years of
[1:28:45] good intellectual teaching
[1:28:48] it's time for ripening the faith a faith
[1:28:52] that is not dead but a faith that works
[1:28:57] now
[1:28:59] so you see the calling forth the bride
[1:29:02] is not an intellectual Revival It's
[1:29:05] Supernatural and its power is not in
[1:29:08] giving a learned behavior
[1:29:10] it is the power of a change life
[1:29:15] you see I mean the AAA will teach an
[1:29:18] alcoholic learn behaviors going to
[1:29:21] change your behavior patterns
[1:29:23] and they use psychology to do that you
[1:29:27] know remember it hurts you it hurts your
[1:29:29] family it hurts your friends it's not
[1:29:32] helpful avoid it so now take these steps
[1:29:36] to to avoid it and to do this and do
[1:29:39] that and they give them a learned
[1:29:41] behavior
[1:29:43] but every time they smell alcohol is
[1:29:46] still there
[1:29:48] every time they see it is still there
[1:29:51] but this gospel is not a learned
[1:29:54] behavior
[1:29:55] it is the power of transformation
[1:29:58] its power lays in a change life that the
[1:30:03] sins that I used to do I do them no more
[1:30:06] I don't desire that anymore I don't want
[1:30:10] that anymore I can pass by every beer
[1:30:12] joint I'm not tempted I can see somebody
[1:30:15] use the alcohol I don't want it why
[1:30:19] because it is not just a learned
[1:30:22] behavior it is a change life
[1:30:29] another Tim why would you why would you
[1:30:34] speak about these things
[1:30:35] because I've been in men's meetings
[1:30:38] where men get up and say you know
[1:30:40] well I've overcome pornography because I
[1:30:44] remember I hurt my wife and it's hurting
[1:30:46] my family and how that's you know wrong
[1:30:49] and I remember and I associate that with
[1:30:51] the pain that he caused of the
[1:30:53] confession and the hurt that it brings
[1:30:56] and and so I've learned to associate
[1:30:58] pain with that behavior so that I don't
[1:31:01] repeat it friends that's not the gospel
[1:31:07] it is not a learned behavior
[1:31:10] it is the power of Christ under
[1:31:13] salvation
[1:31:14] amen your whole attitude your whole
[1:31:17] disposition your whole atmosphere has
[1:31:20] changed
[1:31:22] it gives a power and a young man I don't
[1:31:24] care if he's 16 in the heights of of his
[1:31:27] passion are you with me right now amen
[1:31:31] and he can with the Holy Ghost can lift
[1:31:33] his head and turn away from every
[1:31:35] prostitute every evil dressed woman he
[1:31:38] can bring his mind subject back to the
[1:31:40] word of God it's a power that is in him
[1:31:48] it's not a learned behavior
[1:31:52] now I'm going to stop here for a moment
[1:31:55] because David had a learned behavior I'm
[1:31:58] talking about King David
[1:31:59] he learned the law Thou shalt not commit
[1:32:02] adultery
[1:32:03] he took and he tied the word as
[1:32:05] frontless before his eyes he had it over
[1:32:09] at the emblems of it over the doorpost
[1:32:12] he had every bit of that learning from a
[1:32:16] child Thou shalt not commit adultery and
[1:32:19] here's what happens to a man or woman
[1:32:21] who does they stoned him in that day
[1:32:26] amen he knew the penalty he knew the
[1:32:29] hurt he knew the same but he didn't have
[1:32:32] the power
[1:32:35] when he looked over and saw Bathsheba he
[1:32:38] didn't have the power to resist it and
[1:32:41] he went all around his learned behavior
[1:32:44] all around the recorded scriptures all
[1:32:47] around his memory verses
[1:32:52] and went and committed adultery anyhow
[1:32:56] but if you ever get that heart changed
[1:33:00] it does not desire evil
[1:33:03] there is a power that lays within you
[1:33:07] that brings your body subject
[1:33:13] and I think that don't say that they
[1:33:15] don't have passion anymore it's still
[1:33:17] there temptation is still there but the
[1:33:20] power
[1:33:21] is not a learned behavior
[1:33:25] and considering consequences
[1:33:28] it is something that is a life change
[1:33:30] you would no more do that than nothing
[1:33:34] no more than a lamb would eat pig slop
[1:33:39] come on no more than you would go and
[1:33:42] lap up dogs vomit
[1:33:44] you're not a dog anymore you've been
[1:33:46] changed
[1:33:49] that's moment to you
[1:33:51] that sin that's wrong that's evil it's
[1:33:54] repulsive and I tell you that that's
[1:33:56] what we need is a new birth that sin
[1:33:59] becomes where it makes you sick
[1:34:03] yeah
[1:34:06] where you hate evil and you love
[1:34:08] righteousness
[1:34:10] and you turn from the things of the
[1:34:12] world to the things of God
[1:34:16] you see when you were born
[1:34:19] you were born with a like a magnet
[1:34:21] setting in your heart
[1:34:23] has got poles
[1:34:25] and it's got like a magnet it pulls and
[1:34:28] it resists
[1:34:30] see you know you were born wrong with
[1:34:34] your heart twisted and turned toward
[1:34:36] evil
[1:34:37] so automatically you started doing wrong
[1:34:40] because you were pulled toward it the
[1:34:43] pose of your heart pulled you toward
[1:34:46] doing wrong and you would say you might
[1:34:48] hear Mama say don't do that or daddy
[1:34:50] said that'll hurt you but there was
[1:34:52] something just kept pulling you that
[1:34:53] direction you went that way in spite of
[1:34:57] all the training all the moral teaching
[1:34:59] all the Sunday school teaching all the
[1:35:02] preaching you ever heard you went on
[1:35:04] that way because you were pulled
[1:35:06] naturally that way because the magnet of
[1:35:10] your heart was was the pole was set
[1:35:12] toward unbelief and I believe in sin
[1:35:15] so you were pulled towards sense and
[1:35:17] naturally you gravitated toward the
[1:35:20] wrong kind of music their own kind of
[1:35:22] friends the wrong kind of thinking the
[1:35:24] wrong everything towards sin you did it
[1:35:27] because that's the way your heart was
[1:35:29] set after one of them was born that way
[1:35:31] but the gospel comes and it turns it
[1:35:35] around now remember you pull towards sin
[1:35:38] and you resist God so you resist the
[1:35:40] altar call you resist what God Said you
[1:35:43] resist the righteous teaching of your
[1:35:45] mother and dad you resist that and push
[1:35:47] it against it pull toward the world then
[1:35:50] the gospel comes and what does he do it
[1:35:53] turns a heart and when it turns to Heart
[1:35:55] it pulls you toward God it pulls you
[1:35:58] toward righteousness
[1:36:00] hey your attraction has changed and you
[1:36:03] got a resistance
[1:36:05] to sin to evil to wrong you've got a
[1:36:10] resistance to it because the pose of
[1:36:12] your heart has been changed that's why
[1:36:15] Malachi 4 had to come is to turn the
[1:36:18] hearts
[1:36:20] from disbelieving to believe it
[1:36:28] so Sarah's heart had to be turned
[1:36:31] because she was being pulled toward
[1:36:35] right on into death without your child
[1:36:37] without the promise
[1:36:39] pulled that way
[1:36:41] and and actually she she might Listen by
[1:36:45] now she may have already heard that that
[1:36:48] God had come down and sell shed eye and
[1:36:50] said Sarah's going to have a child and
[1:36:51] this is going to be our new name she
[1:36:53] still don't believe
[1:36:55] she resists
[1:36:57] but now he comes and stands right in
[1:36:59] front of her Grace
[1:37:03] do you ever realize it isn't it
[1:37:05] wonderful you didn't go looking for God
[1:37:08] God went looking for you
[1:37:12] come on
[1:37:13] Sarah wasn't looking for God God came
[1:37:16] looking for Sarah where is Sarah
[1:37:19] and God came looking to you where is
[1:37:21] this one or where is that one and he
[1:37:25] called your name
[1:37:26] Hallelujah I brought you to a
[1:37:29] face-to-face confrontation with him
[1:37:33] well you had to face the question
[1:37:37] with all of these troubles
[1:37:39] all of these scars
[1:37:41] all of these hurts
[1:37:43] all of these problems all of these sins
[1:37:46] is there anything too hard for God
[1:37:56] so I settled that a long time ago we'll
[1:37:58] get sick you'll have to settle it again
[1:38:06] you'll face it right again
[1:38:08] you'll have to come back right around
[1:38:10] that question
[1:38:11] whether he ask you is there anything too
[1:38:14] hard
[1:38:16] now
[1:38:17] so the calling forth of the Bride though
[1:38:19] is an intellectually done
[1:38:21] the end time message did not come by
[1:38:23] intellectual reasoning or study
[1:38:26] it came as Angels descended and
[1:38:29] Revelations came from the pillar of Fire
[1:38:32] the message came from the Realms of
[1:38:35] Glory it did not come from the Mind of
[1:38:37] Men
[1:38:39] I'm out
[1:38:41] you know God has every way he wants
[1:38:43] something preached so I'm not worried
[1:38:45] about that but I do want you to know you
[1:38:47] know after after preaching those hours
[1:38:49] and then ministering personally for
[1:38:51] hours to others I lost my voice and so
[1:38:54] it's just barely coming back but I'm
[1:38:56] here after hours of travel and jet lag
[1:39:00] and sleepless nights to minister to you
[1:39:02] today
[1:39:03] so I want you just to tune in for a
[1:39:05] minute
[1:39:06] don't let it handicap you right now
[1:39:09] let the word of God sink in deep
[1:39:12] now because you see true maturity and
[1:39:15] rightness I want you to understand is
[1:39:18] not a dry formal religion
[1:39:20] that's the description of a dry dead
[1:39:22] blade tosseling shuck life is in the
[1:39:26] grain
[1:39:28] amen whenever when life is gone from the
[1:39:31] shout
[1:39:32] in the Harvest Time and when it's gone
[1:39:34] from the stock when it's gone from the
[1:39:36] root even when it's all gone it's left
[1:39:39] everything life is in the grain
[1:39:43] we must expect life in the grains
[1:39:50] amen now baking the greenness and the
[1:39:54] immaturity out doesn't take away the
[1:39:56] power of God and signs and wonders
[1:39:59] baking the greenness out does not take
[1:40:01] away the life of the Holy Spirit or or
[1:40:04] the joy of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:06] any Ministry I'm going to say something
[1:40:08] any Ministry without Divine Healing
[1:40:11] Miracle signs and wonders is a green
[1:40:14] Ministry
[1:40:17] unripe
[1:40:20] I'm not saying you're not grained now
[1:40:24] I'm saying you're immature
[1:40:27] because of mature ministry will have the
[1:40:30] power of the resurrected Christ in it
[1:40:34] I'm trying to get you to understand what
[1:40:36] maturity is in this type
[1:40:39] because true maturity will have the
[1:40:41] ministry of the resurrected Christ in it
[1:40:45] now educating people into the Bible
[1:40:47] truth is not the gospel
[1:40:50] the gospel is the power of God in the
[1:40:53] men's heart that gives an appetite and a
[1:40:56] hunger for truth
[1:40:57] brother Branham was explicit the seed
[1:40:59] word cannot grow in the atmosphere of
[1:41:03] wisdom's knowledge
[1:41:06] and as soon as wisdom mixes with faith
[1:41:09] faith dies right there
[1:41:12] and and this is what so many have done
[1:41:15] today they have taken what was to be
[1:41:18] faith and turned it to knowledge
[1:41:21] and a knowledge-based message brings
[1:41:24] death not life
[1:41:31] remember Ismail is born out of knowledge
[1:41:34] and reasoning Isaac is born out of
[1:41:38] Supernatural
[1:41:40] God actually had to make the seed alive
[1:41:42] make the womb alive make Abraham as well
[1:41:45] as Sarah Alive come on there had to be
[1:41:47] the miraculous done and Faith put in
[1:41:50] their hearts to believe
[1:41:55] so Isaac is born of the supernatural
[1:41:58] now again as we look at it Eve for
[1:42:03] example let's go to her for a minute we
[1:42:05] know that's where the original sin began
[1:42:07] she had the promise of the word of God
[1:42:09] to be fruitful and multiplying replenish
[1:42:12] the Earth
[1:42:13] that was the word
[1:42:14] now the servant came along with his
[1:42:17] wisdom saying you know God made you for
[1:42:19] this purpose
[1:42:21] oh yeah well um sure you know he said I
[1:42:24] would be fruitful and multiply and
[1:42:26] replenish the Earth and and but if we
[1:42:29] partake of that we'll die
[1:42:32] and using them reason and he said
[1:42:35] but oh do you think a loving father
[1:42:39] a loving God would do a thing like that
[1:42:43] and she listened to wisdom to reason and
[1:42:46] took his wisdom before he said it's a
[1:42:49] tree that's a delight that one to be
[1:42:52] desired for and she fell for it
[1:42:54] and now you see the seed that she was
[1:42:56] holding for that was to see the Promise
[1:42:59] because he had a word that said be
[1:43:01] fruitful multiplied replenish the Earth
[1:43:03] what if she would have finally become
[1:43:05] Mother by the will of God through a
[1:43:08] spoken word but she couldn't wait
[1:43:12] so she listened to Satan's reason and
[1:43:15] took an intellectual thought rather than
[1:43:18] waiting on the Supernatural and God's
[1:43:22] timing for it to happen
[1:43:26] amen but you know that word still came
[1:43:30] to pass
[1:43:31] not an eve
[1:43:33] it passed over thousands of years
[1:43:37] till they found another virgin
[1:43:41] and this Virgin Mary would say be it
[1:43:44] unto me according Thy Word
[1:43:47] I don't know a man well how's it going
[1:43:50] to be it won't be through a man it'll be
[1:43:53] the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:56] and the word that Eve turned down Mary
[1:44:00] took
[1:44:02] Hallelujah and when she took that word
[1:44:05] It produced Christ and from that seed
[1:44:09] came ever born again child of God a new
[1:44:12] generation a new creation a new species
[1:44:17] oh I could preach right now I'm talking
[1:44:20] about a new species that the devil
[1:44:22] didn't know what to do with
[1:44:26] Hallelujah he'd see the Moses he'd seen
[1:44:29] an Aaron he'd see the David he'd seen a
[1:44:32] Noah he'd seen this and he seen that one
[1:44:34] but he never seen any like these on the
[1:44:38] day of Pentecost there was a hundred and
[1:44:40] twenty of them filled with the life of
[1:44:42] God staggered out of the upper room
[1:44:45] speaking in other tons in a Heavenly
[1:44:48] language
[1:44:51] thank you
[1:44:53] a people who could not be deceived
[1:45:00] they were a new species
[1:45:03] they wouldn't do what he did
[1:45:06] come on somebody
[1:45:09] I tell you I'm preaching to a brand new
[1:45:12] species
[1:45:13] a people the devil don't know what to do
[1:45:15] with
[1:45:15] [Applause]
[1:45:17] because there's a bride bringing forth
[1:45:19] in this day of the Original Seed the
[1:45:22] spoken word is the Original Seed and out
[1:45:25] of that original seed comes an original
[1:45:27] group of people that are like that 120
[1:45:30] of the day of Pentecost of people the
[1:45:33] devil don't know what to do with
[1:45:36] he can't stop him
[1:45:38] he can't make him quit he can't make him
[1:45:41] turn back
[1:45:43] oh what the devil saw the day of
[1:45:46] Pentecost was a bunch of men and women
[1:45:48] under the influence
[1:45:51] Hallelujah I can almost freaking comes
[1:45:54] right now under the influence of a
[1:45:56] mighty Angel hear the spirit of God came
[1:45:59] down and God bear 120 just like him
[1:46:06] laughs
[1:46:15] he looked out of there and said what
[1:46:17] have I done by crucifying this one here
[1:46:20] birth out of him
[1:46:22] is 120 more dislike them and three
[1:46:25] thousand more were added to the kingdom
[1:46:31] hallelujah what did he say about this
[1:46:34] safe and I saw another Mighty angel
[1:46:37] and there are people today that have
[1:46:40] been burnt under the influence of that
[1:46:43] Mighty angel
[1:46:46] there are people the devil don't know
[1:46:49] what to do with
[1:46:54] he's offered in the world he's offered
[1:46:56] him Sodom he's offered him every kind of
[1:46:58] sin he's already ever kind of happened
[1:47:01] every kind of the world but he don't
[1:47:03] know what to do with these
[1:47:17] [Music]
[1:47:21] foreign
[1:47:27] [Applause]
[1:47:35] I can't make them disbelieve I can't get
[1:47:38] them to turn around I can't get him to
[1:47:40] dive I can't get him to disbelieve
[1:47:43] anymore
[1:47:50] what the devil saw the day of Pentecost
[1:47:53] was men and women filled with deity
[1:47:56] filled with the power of God what the
[1:47:58] devil is sealed he had to lay on the CNA
[1:48:01] right here in the evening like
[1:48:03] Tabernacle if men and women filled with
[1:48:05] the same deity
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:15] the Unstoppable
[1:48:17] pride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:24] [Applause]
[1:48:36] how many fields that way this morning I
[1:48:39] will not quit
[1:48:41] I will not turn around I am not a
[1:48:44] compromiser
[1:48:45] amen I can't be stopped I will overcome
[1:48:50] well he said he'll overcome by the blood
[1:48:52] of the lamb and the word of their
[1:48:54] testimony
[1:48:58] [Applause]
[1:49:02] you know why
[1:49:04] because the words come right down here
[1:49:06] and found another virtue
[1:49:10] who will conceive just like Mary did
[1:49:13] of the supernatural
[1:49:15] instead of trying to pass the message on
[1:49:18] intellectually
[1:49:24] so
[1:49:26] God had given a word he couldn't take it
[1:49:28] back
[1:49:29] be fruitful and multiply and replace
[1:49:31] here with Mary I mean Eve didn't do that
[1:49:35] she brought forth but she brought forth
[1:49:37] to other serpents
[1:49:38] words
[1:49:41] and through his knowledge he brought
[1:49:42] forth us into death
[1:49:45] because of that
[1:49:48] we were all born wrong
[1:49:51] that's why it requires a new birth
[1:49:54] so you have to be born the second time
[1:49:57] over again because you were born wrong
[1:50:00] the first time
[1:50:04] but the second Birds
[1:50:06] by Earth
[1:50:09] not mixed with Creeds of man and on
[1:50:11] man's ideas not received intellectually
[1:50:14] but a supernatural overshadowing of the
[1:50:17] Holy Ghost
[1:50:19] now brother Brandon
[1:50:23] told us holy ghost seeds of the Bible
[1:50:27] ten I cannot cannot grow in the
[1:50:30] atmosphere of wisdom
[1:50:33] that kills every seminary in the country
[1:50:36] now I'm sorry
[1:50:38] I I understand you some of you feel like
[1:50:41] I'm fighting when I say this but we got
[1:50:43] too many Seminary preachers in this
[1:50:45] message
[1:50:49] we got too many Seminary churches
[1:50:53] that have tried just to teach
[1:50:56] the concepts of Truth
[1:50:59] and pass it on intellectually
[1:51:05] now
[1:51:06] he said that kills every seminary in the
[1:51:09] country because the Bible cannot grow in
[1:51:12] the atmosphere of wisdom
[1:51:14] that kills every seminary in the country
[1:51:16] that knocks the holes right out through
[1:51:18] them punctures them and the Judgment
[1:51:20] Flows In that's right certainly does
[1:51:22] because the word cannot grow with wisdom
[1:51:26] worldly wisdom
[1:51:30] both wisdom and faith will produce an
[1:51:35] atmosphere
[1:51:39] now this is why brother Branham said I'm
[1:51:42] going to ask you something
[1:51:44] this is wisdom versus Faith do you ever
[1:51:46] go into church and say this reverently
[1:51:48] now just to make a point God forbid
[1:51:51] did you ever go into church where the
[1:51:54] pastor is real starchy
[1:51:57] the congregation is the same way
[1:52:00] that's right what is it it's that
[1:52:03] atmosphere that brought it
[1:52:06] go into a place where the pastor says
[1:52:08] now wait a minute
[1:52:10] there's no such a thing as that nonsense
[1:52:12] I don't believe in such thing as Divine
[1:52:14] Healing about the baptism of the Holy
[1:52:16] Ghost you'll see every one of them
[1:52:18] congregation now listen
[1:52:21] granted you ain't gonna get a message
[1:52:24] preacher nowhere to say there's no no
[1:52:27] such thing as Divine Healing or about
[1:52:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:31] but what they do
[1:52:33] is they say but this is not the season
[1:52:36] for it you see
[1:52:39] it was at that time where God was doing
[1:52:42] something back there but he's not doing
[1:52:44] that now
[1:52:47] well we better get something going
[1:52:50] because we got to have such total
[1:52:52] massive Divine Healing
[1:52:54] the gray hair come back to the right
[1:52:56] color again
[1:52:57] wrinkles fall off and a healing comes
[1:53:01] massive Divine Healing from the top of
[1:53:03] the head to the soles of the feet
[1:53:12] So Divine Healing faithful Divine
[1:53:14] Healing is only miniature Rapture in
[1:53:16] faith
[1:53:20] did you get that
[1:53:22] amen it's only miniature Rapture and
[1:53:25] Faith because that faith is enlarged not
[1:53:28] just to heal a heart replace it or you
[1:53:30] know give you 10 more years of life
[1:53:33] or six more like he did says to Karen
[1:53:36] amen but a massive total Divine Healing
[1:53:38] where every part of your body is turned
[1:53:41] back to 18 Again
[1:53:44] we do believe that don't we
[1:53:47] So Divine Healing is only miniature
[1:53:49] Rapture and faith if you don't have them
[1:53:51] have the miniature Faith how are you
[1:53:53] ever going to enlarge that
[1:53:56] you become Rapture in faith
[1:53:58] that's why brother Branham said if I
[1:54:00] can't get you to believe for even Divine
[1:54:03] Healing how am I going to get you to
[1:54:06] believe for Rapture and faith
[1:54:10] but healing's not going to be there
[1:54:13] where it's not preached
[1:54:17] come on
[1:54:18] amen so he said so he said do you ever
[1:54:22] go into church where the pastor reels
[1:54:24] starching congregations the same way
[1:54:26] that's right what is it it's that
[1:54:28] atmosphere that brought it go into a
[1:54:30] place for the Pastor said now wait a
[1:54:32] minute there's no such thing as that
[1:54:34] nonsense I don't believe it's such thing
[1:54:36] as a Divine Healing about that baptism
[1:54:38] of the Holy Ghost you see every one of
[1:54:40] them the congregation and listen he said
[1:54:43] if there's an eagle in there somewhere
[1:54:45] he'll get out
[1:54:48] amongst that bunch of chickens uh sure
[1:54:51] will exactly the truth he'll leave it
[1:54:53] yeah he sure will he can't stand that
[1:54:56] he's an eagle he's Sky built not a
[1:55:00] barnyard
[1:55:04] now as the Eagles turns his announced he
[1:55:07] said he said um in his prayers said Lord
[1:55:10] be merciful to me and he said he said
[1:55:13] he's inviting his congregation to pray
[1:55:15] this like this give me Eagle thoughts
[1:55:18] give me Eagle desires give me Eagle life
[1:55:22] let me fly in your blue yonder Lord
[1:55:25] where all things are possible to them
[1:55:27] that believe make a faith in me let my
[1:55:30] wings grow let my faith muscles around
[1:55:33] my wings grow till I can really see
[1:55:36] Jesus
[1:55:38] amen Eagle life Eagle desires Eagle
[1:55:42] thoughts
[1:55:43] soaring above the unbelief of the age
[1:55:49] listen
[1:55:50] in the ground the grounded prison of
[1:55:55] Sarah's tent
[1:55:56] she needed Eagle Faith to get out of
[1:56:00] there
[1:56:05] now God's looking for men he said who
[1:56:09] can climb up in the Heights like an
[1:56:11] eagle
[1:56:12] take his flight go on Plumbing the
[1:56:14] Heavenly Yonder where all these things
[1:56:17] are possible about this Earthbound
[1:56:19] clucking down here hitting on four
[1:56:21] cylinders in the water jacket bursted on
[1:56:24] the inside don't even know how to be
[1:56:26] baptized yet oh my and all that fussing
[1:56:28] going on we fly away from it why yes I
[1:56:31] think there's friends if the whole
[1:56:33] nation stood in awe watched through the
[1:56:35] television when the countdown come for
[1:56:37] that Astronaut John Glenn to leave
[1:56:40] absorb his first flight towards the moon
[1:56:43] to get up above it to hold Earth Stood a
[1:56:45] maze as they've seen that astronaut take
[1:56:47] off what will the whole universe stand
[1:56:50] still when that great eagle of the
[1:56:54] Church of God when she spreads her great
[1:56:56] Wings one of these mornings propelled by
[1:57:00] the Holy Ghost and Fire when she takes
[1:57:03] her shiver off the Earth and goes in the
[1:57:05] Heavenly the whole universe will know it
[1:57:08] angels will welcome him into with a
[1:57:10] Triumph amen where living in the
[1:57:13] astronaut age going in the heavenlies
[1:57:15] people can't understand it when you talk
[1:57:18] about a shock coming just wait until the
[1:57:21] church starts moving up when that great
[1:57:23] eagle called The Church of God Redeemed
[1:57:26] by the blood of Jesus Christ spreads
[1:57:28] forth her wings and the power of the
[1:57:31] Holy Ghost begins to lift her up off the
[1:57:34] Earth it's going to be a wonderful time
[1:57:36] remember an automobile can't follow it
[1:57:38] neither can an airplane it's astronaut
[1:57:41] let's be an astronaut let's believe God
[1:57:47] Hallelujah
[1:57:49] there was a little mother
[1:57:51] and daddy
[1:57:53] brought about a oh I don't know precious
[1:57:56] little three four or five-year-old child
[1:57:59] up I couldn't speak their language but
[1:58:02] it was translated to me
[1:58:04] that the baby girl had
[1:58:07] had a genetic disease
[1:58:10] with this genetic disease
[1:58:13] she seemed to be a little mentally
[1:58:16] and and stunnied in her growth
[1:58:19] so I'm not real sure how old she was but
[1:58:23] it was a desperate situation
[1:58:26] and there as they told me that I had
[1:58:28] just smiled and
[1:58:30] and
[1:58:32] spoke some words to her I said now I'm
[1:58:34] going to pray for this child
[1:58:36] I want you to confess every day that is
[1:58:38] healed
[1:58:39] I want you to tell this child every day
[1:58:42] that Jesus has healed it and she's going
[1:58:45] to be well and that she will will do
[1:58:48] beyond what the doctors have said
[1:58:53] and I prayed for that child and the
[1:58:56] mother wrote back
[1:58:58] to Brother David and said
[1:59:00] all through the night all I could do is
[1:59:03] see brother Kim's face
[1:59:05] it would keep appearing to me as a smile
[1:59:07] on his face as he looked down upon my
[1:59:10] child and said it's given me such a hope
[1:59:16] and I told Brother David I said well you
[1:59:18] know in 1970 I met a woman
[1:59:22] and and and she she was she was there in
[1:59:27] our home just before Karen and I got
[1:59:29] married
[1:59:31] and and then she she was a pastor's wife
[1:59:35] and and she told me something and then
[1:59:37] she met me again in Florida a few years
[1:59:39] ago
[1:59:41] and she told me
[1:59:43] told me about
[1:59:45] um her condition and what had happened
[1:59:46] to her and reminded me it all came
[1:59:49] flooding back
[1:59:50] to to me her name was Sister Anderson
[1:59:54] and they pastored for a little while
[1:59:56] before Daniel did in Coal Lake
[1:59:58] Mississippi
[2:00:00] and that church troubled him so bad
[2:00:02] until he would twist his hair you know
[2:00:06] and until his hair had bald spots all
[2:00:09] over because of the pressure
[2:00:11] of that ungodly unbelieving butts did
[2:00:17] but nevertheless
[2:00:19] he'd come over to visit us and she told
[2:00:22] us about it and she told me again in
[2:00:23] Florida her husband's going to be with
[2:00:25] the Lord she said brother Tim I was five
[2:00:27] years old
[2:00:30] the doctors and the checkups said
[2:00:34] your child is mentally
[2:00:38] and it will never progress it'll never
[2:00:41] have more than a three-year-old
[2:00:44] you might as well realize that we as
[2:00:47] scientists are in our scientific
[2:00:49] Community doctors we have no cure for
[2:00:51] this there's no hope for it
[2:00:54] so do I only hope you got lady
[2:00:57] is to find somebody who believes in
[2:00:59] prayer this doctor said
[2:01:02] that believes in prayer that lay hands
[2:01:04] on this child and pray the prayer of
[2:01:06] faith over
[2:01:07] and the mother said her mother said well
[2:01:09] we're Pentecostals
[2:01:11] he said that's good take her to a
[2:01:13] meeting and get her prayed for that's
[2:01:15] your only hope
[2:01:18] so she said about that time down into
[2:01:21] Quincy Louisiana Brother Gary you know
[2:01:24] where that is it was about 1945 or six
[2:01:28] so I must have been 46 after the angel
[2:01:30] came because brother Branham came to
[2:01:33] Louisiana and was down into Quincy he
[2:01:36] calls talks about this later haven't
[2:01:37] been down there at Quincy Louisiana and
[2:01:41] so you know he said they her brother
[2:01:44] Brandon was going there and he'd met
[2:01:46] with an Angel and the presence of God
[2:01:48] was they're real and and the atmosphere
[2:01:52] was right for the sick to be healed said
[2:01:54] they took me to that meeting
[2:01:57] and said brother Brandon prayed for me
[2:01:59] and in that meeting said I was healed
[2:02:03] and here she was now 80 years old come
[2:02:07] across from the Carolinas to Florida to
[2:02:10] come and see me because she'd know me
[2:02:11] when I was a boy preacher and hear me
[2:02:14] preach again and talk to him again and
[2:02:16] remind me of this
[2:02:19] amen that our God there is no limits
[2:02:23] [Applause]
[2:02:27] oh
[2:02:28] Hallelujah your child may be deformed
[2:02:32] your baby may be where it's totally
[2:02:36] impossible for doctors but I tell you
[2:02:38] what don't give up hope
[2:02:40] [Applause]
[2:02:42] Hallelujah bring her to a place where
[2:02:44] there's Faith where there's an
[2:02:46] atmosphere
[2:02:47] an atmosphere that is produced where
[2:02:50] miracles happen
[2:02:51] [Applause]
[2:02:56] no wonder she could see my face all
[2:02:58] night
[2:02:59] because I know the power of my Christ I
[2:03:03] know what he can do
[2:03:05] I know the power of the blood of Jesus
[2:03:08] Hallelujah that not only can take a
[2:03:11] child with a genetic problem that is so
[2:03:14] is a memory or whatever the
[2:03:18] case is that he can not only heal that
[2:03:21] but he can take somebody
[2:03:23] that is so Diamond the depths of sin
[2:03:27] that it seems like it's impossible that
[2:03:30] they could ever be saved I believe all
[2:03:33] over them and they're crippled up as
[2:03:36] that little child is and God by his
[2:03:38] transforming power can change them in a
[2:03:41] moment
[2:03:44] Hallelujah in a moment
[2:03:50] I'll tell you what we need to be an
[2:03:52] astronaut in our faith
[2:03:55] the Eagles in our faith what we we can
[2:03:58] look down on any disease
[2:04:01] that is summed underneath us we can look
[2:04:04] down on every sin say it's underneath us
[2:04:08] [Applause]
[2:04:16] think about an eagle he can slip right
[2:04:19] down and snatch you up where he is
[2:04:22] my brother Joe preaching about her
[2:04:24] pose harpazo where the Greek word says
[2:04:28] sees or snatch up
[2:04:32] and God will smash you up right out of a
[2:04:34] situation
[2:04:36] I believe we're under legal anointing
[2:04:39] amen I I believe that with all of my
[2:04:41] heart I believe in a miracle working God
[2:04:44] and I told that little mother let me
[2:04:46] tell you when Atlanta bucks was healed
[2:04:49] one day she has black lungs
[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:04:54] but guess what it took a recreation
[2:04:58] can you imagine a re-creation of cells
[2:05:03] spoken word is hallelujah creative words
[2:05:07] going forth and change that lung till in
[2:05:11] the next morning
[2:05:13] a black lab is cancer-free with only
[2:05:17] well self that gives the miraculous
[2:05:21] power of God created work and if you can
[2:05:25] create new cells there he can create new
[2:05:28] cells for you today Danette
[2:05:31] that's the way our God is
[2:05:37] Hallelujah if you need a child and
[2:05:40] everything's out of whack in your body
[2:05:42] he can recreate new cells
[2:05:46] Hallelujah whatever it is just God there
[2:05:49] is nothing too hard for him
[2:06:02] wisdom versus faith
[2:06:04] we find out those atmospheres
[2:06:07] and you get in where faith is taught in
[2:06:09] a church
[2:06:11] you'll find the church in that
[2:06:12] atmosphere
[2:06:17] let me say it again
[2:06:19] quote brother Brown wisdom versus faith
[2:06:23] and when you give you get him where
[2:06:25] faith is taught in a church
[2:06:27] you'll find a church in that atmosphere
[2:06:34] he said oh God let me get this to you
[2:06:37] so if you can see it
[2:06:39] that's the reason people come among the
[2:06:41] saints for the praying believers Paul
[2:06:44] said he didn't find any of the city Only
[2:06:45] Timothy that was like Precious faith
[2:06:48] that he had you know the rest of them
[2:06:49] were all denominationalism but when he
[2:06:52] got in that atmosphere see he you find
[2:06:55] you find things going on
[2:06:57] that the atmosphere has created
[2:07:01] you find people living by faith when you
[2:07:05] get to the place into a place where it
[2:07:08] says well my the Bible's true God heals
[2:07:12] you walk around our congregation to say
[2:07:14] why I was done with cancer I was healed
[2:07:19] I was once blind David Dexter I see amen
[2:07:23] that stranger said give me why you mean
[2:07:26] what's the matter with you I'll show you
[2:07:28] on my record come home with me come eat
[2:07:30] dinner with me I'll show you something I
[2:07:32] got a record up there my neighbors know
[2:07:33] I was in this kind of condition I was
[2:07:36] paralyzed for years I was Supreme for
[2:07:37] what what is it the word in that church
[2:07:41] that group of Believers has created that
[2:07:43] atmosphere
[2:07:47] Hallelujah
[2:07:49] amen the word in that church
[2:07:54] in that group of Believers has changed
[2:07:57] that atmosphere well brother Jim we
[2:07:59] preached the word like that that
[2:08:00] atmosphere right there well you ain't
[2:08:02] preaching all the words
[2:08:06] because if you preach the Full Gospel
[2:08:07] healings in it
[2:08:10] the Holy Ghost is in it well we have the
[2:08:12] word here brother Timmy ain't nobody
[2:08:15] weeps their way yet Calvary at an altar
[2:08:17] you're not preaching the whole word
[2:08:19] you got part of the word
[2:08:22] or maybe it's just the intellectual
[2:08:25] is not mixed with faith
[2:08:29] but when you mix it with faith something
[2:08:31] happens
[2:08:36] amen that's what you come in services
[2:08:38] like this and even did you know I'm
[2:08:42] going to tell you something
[2:08:43] and brother Branham even brother Brandon
[2:08:46] even made this clear he talked about
[2:08:49] Tommy Osborne just taking the word
[2:08:51] itself by preaching the word so Miracles
[2:08:54] and signs and wonders without a gift
[2:08:59] just with the word preached
[2:09:01] so it don't take a special gift
[2:09:04] it takes the word preached to tune the
[2:09:09] faith to believe
[2:09:11] now he got that part on Divine Healing
[2:09:13] but he couldn't get all of it she's
[2:09:15] trinitarian and and so on like that but
[2:09:17] you see we're not a people like that
[2:09:19] we're people who believe the whole word
[2:09:23] Hallelujah so we ought to see the whole
[2:09:26] results
[2:09:27] [Applause]
[2:09:30] listen I I I'm not trying to get some
[2:09:33] Divine Healing campaigns going and this
[2:09:36] and that I'm just finding out what's in
[2:09:38] there in our inheritance
[2:09:43] that's all I'm doing
[2:09:45] amen I'm not just trying to have a you
[2:09:48] know a church and every church is a a
[2:09:51] prayer line and never ever service is a
[2:09:54] an altar call and you know hey when when
[2:09:57] when when it happens
[2:09:59] it needs to be done
[2:10:02] but nevertheless I'm not that's not what
[2:10:04] we're striving for we're striving to
[2:10:05] preach the entire gospel
[2:10:10] the entire gospel
[2:10:12] laughs
[2:10:16] like somebody sent me a quote another
[2:10:19] Minister sent a quote out we need to be
[2:10:22] well steady what we do
[2:10:24] and we've been well studied
[2:10:26] I have been well studied I know what the
[2:10:29] word says
[2:10:31] amen I don't want to go to Boston like
[2:10:33] the Apostle Paul did but I could
[2:10:39] amen I could
[2:10:42] but nevertheless that's not what our
[2:10:44] goal is is to try to boast in her own
[2:10:47] self I'm just saying though listen
[2:10:49] friends we should be well studied but
[2:10:52] that that that receiving the word must
[2:10:55] be more than intellectual it's got to be
[2:10:58] Supernatural gospel
[2:11:06] the things you think on the things you
[2:11:08] do the actions the things you talk about
[2:11:09] creates an atmosphere
[2:11:13] in wisdom versus faith brother Branham
[2:11:15] said how is now how is the word in this
[2:11:18] Simplicity yet in its completeness ever
[2:11:21] grow in a place where knowledge
[2:11:24] overshadows that and says it can't be so
[2:11:28] it can't where knowledge is preached
[2:11:31] from a seminary the children die
[2:11:36] and when faith is preached from the word
[2:11:39] to children live
[2:11:41] amen that's the difference just life and
[2:11:45] death
[2:11:46] that's the same thing that happened in
[2:11:48] the Garden of Eden that's exactly what
[2:11:49] happened to them two atmospheres there
[2:11:52] when Eve got off the right one on the
[2:11:54] wrong one she died
[2:11:56] it'll do it every time oh they say if
[2:11:59] your church has got that kind of
[2:12:01] atmosphere oh child if you want to live
[2:12:03] you better believe in the word so they
[2:12:06] so he said they cannot stay in that
[2:12:08] wrong atmosphere
[2:12:09] now
[2:12:10] there are
[2:12:14] and again you know we the thought comes
[2:12:17] along that preachers who don't want the
[2:12:20] atmosphere were the baptism of the Holy
[2:12:23] Ghost comes
[2:12:25] they claim they have that but they want
[2:12:27] more than that they're seeking the
[2:12:29] character of the key
[2:12:31] whatever that means
[2:12:35] well if you had the Holy Ghost
[2:12:39] then you would have the character of The
[2:12:41] King
[2:12:44] and without it you still have your old
[2:12:47] character of your carnal nature
[2:12:50] they said no you you've got to educate
[2:12:52] the people into having the character of
[2:12:54] the king you see you need counseling
[2:12:56] before marriage to give the young people
[2:12:57] character
[2:13:03] I don't know that all your teaching is
[2:13:04] going to give anybody character
[2:13:08] counseling and instructions has its
[2:13:10] place
[2:13:11] but educating them into it is not what
[2:13:14] they need
[2:13:15] if you want the character the king
[2:13:18] then you receive his life
[2:13:21] and that will give you his character
[2:13:26] amen
[2:13:28] now
[2:13:29] so so again that's how you get the
[2:13:31] character of the king you receive his
[2:13:33] life if you have his life well then it's
[2:13:36] going to produce the character of Christ
[2:13:39] it can't help but produce it
[2:13:42] listen a dog does not grow to be a human
[2:13:46] it grows up to be a dog
[2:13:49] because it's born with the
[2:13:51] characteristics of a dog in the nature
[2:13:54] of a dog it grows up to be adult if
[2:13:57] you're human
[2:13:58] you don't grow up to be a pig
[2:14:01] you might pig out it's supper but you're
[2:14:03] not a pig
[2:14:09] because you have the character of a
[2:14:12] human that you were born with that
[2:14:14] characteristics and when you're born of
[2:14:16] Christ these signs shall follow them
[2:14:20] that believe
[2:14:22] they cast out devils
[2:14:29] well brother Tim I never got down there
[2:14:31] and laid hands on somebody and cast The
[2:14:34] Devil out well what about the devil that
[2:14:36] come in your thinking
[2:14:38] that you cast out
[2:14:43] hey man what about that tormenting
[2:14:44] spirit that attacked your body and you
[2:14:47] said I don't have to have this I'm a
[2:14:50] blood-washing child of the Living God I
[2:14:53] speak against us in the name of Jesus
[2:14:55] Christ and I'm leaving that behind me
[2:14:58] come on somebody amen there's more
[2:15:01] casting out Devils than down here to
[2:15:02] altering the prayer line
[2:15:06] you know how to overcome depression by
[2:15:10] the temp cast him out
[2:15:11] [Applause]
[2:15:18] people want some kind of magic formula
[2:15:20] where you do this kind of like the man
[2:15:23] told Brother the school teacher no
[2:15:25] brother Branham okay you got a violent
[2:15:27] temper but before that you know you
[2:15:29] explode and get mad I want you to tie a
[2:15:32] hundred knots
[2:15:35] he didn't get very far into it away and
[2:15:38] went fighting
[2:15:40] that was his nature till it changed
[2:15:45] amen all the hundred knots in the world
[2:15:48] didn't keep him
[2:15:51] amen it was when the devil was cast out
[2:15:54] when he was saved
[2:15:56] that changed his nature now rather than
[2:15:59] hating the man wanting to kill and
[2:16:01] murder the guy that killed his dog he
[2:16:03] led him to Christ
[2:16:04] [Applause]
[2:16:06] you see it changes you
[2:16:08] it's the power of God and the salvation
[2:16:11] I know this is too simple but listen I
[2:16:14] asked more than just too simple it's
[2:16:16] actually magnificent think about it
[2:16:19] women it might have been simple thinking
[2:16:22] to Sarah oh that's too hard to believe
[2:16:25] that's stupid you know to believe in old
[2:16:27] women like me but when her nature was
[2:16:29] changed
[2:16:31] what if she was chasing the presence of
[2:16:34] that angel
[2:16:35] amen then her heart was turned and the
[2:16:38] Bible said that she received strength to
[2:16:42] be to conceive because she judged him
[2:16:46] faithful who made the promise
[2:16:49] [Applause]
[2:16:51] come on now it ain't you going to be
[2:16:54] able to defeat this devil it ain't you
[2:16:56] going to be able to defeat this habit
[2:16:58] but you judge that she is faithful
[2:17:03] Hallelujah to deliver me amen I will
[2:17:06] overcome this
[2:17:08] cause I got the Overcomer on the inside
[2:17:11] of me
[2:17:17] the seed where the Bible can't grow in
[2:17:19] such a word as that how can a person go
[2:17:23] into one of those modern churches now
[2:17:25] and the spirit of God come upon it and
[2:17:27] they want to holler glory to God
[2:17:29] hallelujah you know what while you make
[2:17:31] the preacher swallow his sermon
[2:17:34] well I'm telling you I can just say him
[2:17:39] oh brother that's only denomination oh
[2:17:41] no
[2:17:42] there have been there have been Godly
[2:17:45] men and women hauled out a message
[2:17:48] churches
[2:17:51] for breaking Church order for saying
[2:17:54] amen
[2:18:02] you know I made the preacher swallow his
[2:18:05] sermon
[2:18:06] brother they said I you know a guy asked
[2:18:09] brother Brandon how can you preach if
[2:18:10] they do that he said I I couldn't preach
[2:18:12] unless they did
[2:18:16] amen because they were producing the
[2:18:18] atmosphere
[2:18:19] they were encouraged in the Holy Spirit
[2:18:21] and pulling on the gift of God he said
[2:18:24] it was like the like his old hound dog
[2:18:26] he said he hated the skunk
[2:18:28] but he said you know and so what he did
[2:18:31] he got a skunk said he wouldn't go get
[2:18:34] him but he said if I'd hit him on the
[2:18:36] side and say second boy second boy he
[2:18:38] said I could encourage him to go into
[2:18:40] that old brush pile and drag that old
[2:18:42] skunk out and he said the biggest skunk
[2:18:44] I know is the devil
[2:18:48] and if I can get some people to Pat me
[2:18:50] on the side and say I'm sick of boy
[2:18:52] we'll go after that devil and bring that
[2:18:55] old speaker out of the dress pot and
[2:18:58] kill him
[2:19:02] foreign
[2:19:08] [Applause]
[2:19:11] and he said in all them cranes there
[2:19:16] stretch that neck around
[2:19:19] you know
[2:19:21] he said well who said that
[2:19:24] what was that
[2:19:26] in a few minutes preachers say Jesus
[2:19:29] Christ the son of God and they said
[2:19:31] glory to God that's right
[2:19:33] um they can see you're right at the door
[2:19:35] right in a few minutes they'll throw you
[2:19:36] right out the word can't grow there
[2:19:42] I'm quoting just can't do it just can't
[2:19:45] do it see it just simply can't and when
[2:19:47] he comes spraying this poison on top of
[2:19:49] it trying to kill the germ life in you
[2:19:51] now there's a group of people in the
[2:19:54] land today that believes that God heals
[2:19:56] well of course we're no reasonable sin
[2:19:59] shows that God gave us doctors to heal
[2:20:01] now and he said you asked a good
[2:20:03] sensible doctor if he's a Healer he'll
[2:20:05] tell you no I can move a tooth but I
[2:20:07] can't heal the socket it came out of
[2:20:08] that's right I can set an arm but I
[2:20:10] can't heal it that's certainly right God
[2:20:12] is the Healer now how's it ever going to
[2:20:15] grow it well something ever going to
[2:20:17] grow in such a stuff is that how can the
[2:20:19] seed word ever grow in such as that it
[2:20:23] just won't do it it just can't grow in
[2:20:25] that kind of atmosphere but Faith grows
[2:20:29] only grows in one vitamin it only has or
[2:20:33] needs one vitamin don't have to have any
[2:20:36] mixture at all Faith grows in one
[2:20:39] vitamin that's the word
[2:20:41] and that's the only thing that faith can
[2:20:43] grow in is the word and the way that it
[2:20:47] grows is to believe the word has take
[2:20:49] all the word believe it's true and Faith
[2:20:52] vitamin is spelled four little one a
[2:20:55] little four-letter word l-i-f-e life and
[2:20:58] it has vitamin L faith has vitamin l
[2:21:01] so he goes on and says he says then he
[2:21:05] said now everything that has been
[2:21:08] created was created by faith
[2:21:15] Hebrews 11 by faith the world was
[2:21:17] created
[2:21:19] the world was made by faith
[2:21:22] God's made the world out of things that
[2:21:25] does not appear
[2:21:27] by faith God spoke the world into
[2:21:29] existence
[2:21:30] because it was a premeditated word and
[2:21:33] as soon as he said it it became life
[2:21:36] now you say I believe that brother
[2:21:38] Branham in your heart you can't believe
[2:21:40] it then express it I believe it don't
[2:21:43] never change it at all stay right with
[2:21:45] it watch what will grow out of it it
[2:21:47] will produce the word cause it's Faith
[2:21:50] wisdom takes you away Faith brings you
[2:21:52] to it
[2:21:56] but you see what the world wants to do
[2:21:58] is to the systems of the world wants to
[2:22:02] take the word of God and make it
[2:22:04] traditional
[2:22:09] now brother Branham told us exactly what
[2:22:11] happens to prophets when they leave
[2:22:14] he said what they do
[2:22:16] he said God will anoint and use a man
[2:22:19] and he said then they will make a
[2:22:21] tradition out of his life
[2:22:29] and let me just tell you because they do
[2:22:31] that they become living in the Clara of
[2:22:34] the past
[2:22:35] and their God is past not present
[2:22:39] so it will be when something happens out
[2:22:42] here but it's not now
[2:22:44] and it all becomes pretentious and
[2:22:47] pretending rather than reality
[2:22:50] now let me just say brother Brandon said
[2:22:52] you can't put genuine corn in something
[2:22:54] unless it's Earth and it won't grow you
[2:22:56] can lay it in the sun you can keep it
[2:22:58] warm you can do what you want if it has
[2:23:00] to be it takes a certain kind of Earth
[2:23:02] it must be there it must be under the
[2:23:04] right atmosphere to make it bring forth
[2:23:06] and he says so does the word of God
[2:23:09] you can't take a church and bring it to
[2:23:12] life on some tradition you might bring
[2:23:15] members by the Millions
[2:23:19] but you'll never bring the power of God
[2:23:21] until we get back to the original word
[2:23:24] again back to the foundational word back
[2:23:27] to the blood back to Jesus Christ back
[2:23:29] to old-fashioned prayer meetings and
[2:23:32] back to God
[2:23:33] and that's what we've been seeing this
[2:23:35] old-fashioned prayer meetings where
[2:23:36] people meet God
[2:23:40] and because of him the atmosphere
[2:23:42] changes when a baby is born there's a
[2:23:45] little spirit with a living atmosphere
[2:23:48] that has comes to give life to that baby
[2:23:51] when he comes into a life then he
[2:23:55] becomes a live and breathing entity
[2:23:59] now brother Branham let's talk about
[2:24:01] this thing same thing and he talked
[2:24:04] about wanting to get his daughter
[2:24:07] Rebecca in meetings
[2:24:10] where the Holy Ghost was falling
[2:24:14] he said because it's the atmosphere that
[2:24:17] will make it happen
[2:24:22] amen and he said now before there's a
[2:24:25] birth there's got to be a death first
[2:24:26] you got to die to your sins die to your
[2:24:28] will die to your unbelief you know
[2:24:30] there's got to be a dying out
[2:24:32] that's one reason for an altar you come
[2:24:35] to that altar to die
[2:24:40] Jonathan Middleton sitting right here
[2:24:42] came to me as a young boy I don't know
[2:24:45] how many times I want to be delivered to
[2:24:46] these cigarettes I want to be delivered
[2:24:48] to these cigarettes
[2:24:49] we'd pray for him
[2:24:51] he'd come back from prayer I want to be
[2:24:52] delivered to the cigarettes
[2:24:54] one day he finally come to me and he was
[2:24:56] honest
[2:24:57] he said you know why I smoked these
[2:25:00] cigarettes
[2:25:02] I said no why
[2:25:04] because I love them
[2:25:07] I love these secrets I love
[2:25:11] how it makes me feel after a meal
[2:25:16] I love
[2:25:18] I just love these cigarettes
[2:25:20] I said well Jonathan you'll never be
[2:25:23] delivered to them cigarettes to you hate
[2:25:25] them
[2:25:27] I said look at what it's doing to you
[2:25:28] it's destroying your life destroying
[2:25:31] your lungs is keeping you in unbelief
[2:25:35] the boy can sing he wanted to sing
[2:25:37] I said no you can't sing in my church
[2:25:40] why can't I sing well I said okay let me
[2:25:43] smoke a cigarette and you listen to me
[2:25:45] preach
[2:25:51] well no I wouldn't want to hear you
[2:25:52] preach that's a smoke we cigarette I
[2:25:54] don't want to hear you sing
[2:25:57] what I want you to do is repent but it
[2:26:00] got the place that Jonathan come to the
[2:26:01] point he hated those cigarettes
[2:26:04] and when he hated those cigarettes and
[2:26:07] repented of them that God came and
[2:26:09] delivered him yeah
[2:26:13] let me pack a day cigarettes was that
[2:26:15] Jonathan
[2:26:16] it's about three packs of cigarettes a
[2:26:18] day
[2:26:19] you see it was an addiction you know
[2:26:21] what was an addiction it was a devil
[2:26:23] sitting right down here drawing through
[2:26:25] that amount of satisfaction
[2:26:29] amen and so you see when that devil was
[2:26:32] gone no no more cigarettes never
[2:26:34] bothered him again
[2:26:37] hallelujah amen so you see there had to
[2:26:40] be a dying out before the birds could
[2:26:43] come and a bird's is a mess we don't
[2:26:46] care where it's out if it's a big pen or
[2:26:48] a pig decorated the hospital room it's
[2:26:50] going to be a mess it'll make you do
[2:26:52] things you ordinarily wouldn't think you
[2:26:54] would do
[2:26:56] remember when you're ready to die to
[2:26:58] yourself and you're born again become a
[2:27:00] new creature in Christ Jesus and open up
[2:27:03] a light comes becomes a new sight to you
[2:27:05] because you've accepted the person of
[2:27:07] Jesus Christ not some Doctrine or Creed
[2:27:10] of I believe this or I believe the
[2:27:13] message I've accepted Jesus and my
[2:27:15] savior it's more than that
[2:27:17] but the person of Christ comes into you
[2:27:20] and you're born again
[2:27:28] I'd like to preach a whole sermon on
[2:27:30] this next phrase but not today
[2:27:33] even to the written word it's got to be
[2:27:36] quickened by the Holy Spirit
[2:27:42] you can memorize your Bible you can read
[2:27:44] it every day
[2:27:46] but it takes a quickening of that word
[2:27:47] to your heart
[2:27:50] amen
[2:27:51] he said I could have a handful of wheat
[2:27:54] but until he gets in the process to
[2:27:56] where it can be quickened the wheat will
[2:27:58] never lift
[2:27:59] said you can have a doctor's degree a pH
[2:28:01] LL whatever you wish to and people's got
[2:28:04] him in the message
[2:28:06] they've studied they have been there
[2:28:08] they're well studied
[2:28:10] but until the Holy Spirit comes upon
[2:28:12] that and quickens you
[2:28:14] as a personal experience with God then
[2:28:16] the wheat does no good your learning is
[2:28:18] in vain
[2:28:21] amen
[2:28:23] and then he said as the Englishman said
[2:28:25] the other night I was so astonished at
[2:28:27] that all the learning he had is Paul he
[2:28:29] had to forget all he knew in order to
[2:28:31] find Christ do things that he thought he
[2:28:33] wouldn't do and that's the way God does
[2:28:35] he humiliates us in our educational
[2:28:37] system not as I'm trying to support
[2:28:39] ignorance but I'm trying to tell you the
[2:28:42] difference education can never bring
[2:28:44] life
[2:28:45] understand this the word can be taught
[2:28:49] and they can receive it education but it
[2:28:52] will not bring life
[2:28:55] it takes the spirit of God to bring life
[2:28:57] and that life must not come out of just
[2:29:00] an intellectual Revival is going to come
[2:29:02] out of the Bible word Revival and that
[2:29:05] word is the same yesterday today and
[2:29:09] forever and when it falls today and
[2:29:12] quickens you get the same results as in
[2:29:16] Acts 2.
[2:29:18] exactly it always has and always will be
[2:29:21] because the spirit of God it's the
[2:29:23] spirit of God conditions the atmosphere
[2:29:26] so let's re-emphasize that
[2:29:28] a word Revival somebody say word Revival
[2:29:33] it brings the same results of Acts 2.
[2:29:38] oh brother Tim we are in the Revival now
[2:29:40] but it's not a holy ghost survival it's
[2:29:42] a word Revival well a word Revival
[2:29:46] will you get the same results as an Acts
[2:29:50] 2.
[2:29:51] so if the word is really preached
[2:29:56] it's going to bring forth Acts 2 again
[2:30:00] when the word is preached in his
[2:30:02] fullness there will be healing miracles
[2:30:06] the Holy Ghost
[2:30:08] true salvation the power of Christ it
[2:30:11] will be there
[2:30:12] so remember that's the only kind that
[2:30:15] the word can bring forth
[2:30:18] is that acts 2 38 blabber
[2:30:21] tongue-speaking baby
[2:30:23] come on somebody
[2:30:26] you are you say my brother Tim you see
[2:30:28] but we're wanting a mature church and
[2:30:30] you just call them babies listen it took
[2:30:33] a woman a mature woman with ripened
[2:30:36] Faith to bring forth that kind of baby
[2:30:40] [Music]
[2:30:45] Sarah could not do it before
[2:30:48] it took a ripened Faith a mature faith
[2:30:55] to bring forth that kind of job and if
[2:30:58] we got that kind of a church then you're
[2:31:02] going to have that kind of baby Isaacs
[2:31:06] Hallelujah those Supernatural Born Again
[2:31:09] black wasps young men young women filled
[2:31:14] with the Holy Ghost with the power of
[2:31:15] God that can believe for anything that
[2:31:18] all things are possible to them that
[2:31:20] believe
[2:31:25] an intellectual Revival brings a dead
[2:31:29] child
[2:31:30] that is just born out of dead teaching
[2:31:34] and mere theology
[2:31:36] a word Revival changes the life to the
[2:31:41] indwelling of Christ and the soul
[2:31:43] an intellectual Revival tries to bring
[2:31:47] Reformation
[2:31:49] so you see through educating the mind
[2:31:54] toward righteousness you know educating
[2:31:56] the Mind toward righteousness you know
[2:31:59] then but that's not what a word Revival
[2:32:02] is a word Revival is a transformation
[2:32:06] brother Brandon preached this the power
[2:32:08] to transform
[2:32:10] not the power to reform
[2:32:13] and this is where that we we got too
[2:32:16] much we got too much
[2:32:19] denominational teaching from the glare
[2:32:22] of the past age
[2:32:24] bringing an end to making a message
[2:32:26] intellectual
[2:32:28] rather than the power of God to
[2:32:31] Salvation that brings us Supernatural
[2:32:33] birth
[2:32:36] now Sarah heard the word she had heard
[2:32:40] Abraham said right now it had been 25
[2:32:43] years from the first time
[2:32:47] Sarah heard the word and she had
[2:32:49] received the message intellectually
[2:32:51] can you bear with me a few more minutes
[2:32:53] you're not as hard as I am
[2:32:57] but she had heard the word she'd
[2:32:59] received the message intellectually
[2:33:01] but what did she do with it
[2:33:04] she reasoned it
[2:33:08] I'm not able to do this
[2:33:10] so she gives the seed
[2:33:13] over to a bonds woman
[2:33:16] and this is what has happened to the
[2:33:18] message the church has received the
[2:33:20] message intellectually and she
[2:33:23] acknowledges that the bride is chosen
[2:33:25] before the foundation world she accepts
[2:33:27] the fact that there is to be the Seed of
[2:33:29] Abraham in the last day but through her
[2:33:33] intellectual reasoning she gave the seed
[2:33:36] word over to the wombs of a bug's woman
[2:33:39] and it is given birth to Israelites
[2:33:45] a child of the Supernatural and Isaac
[2:33:49] will be gentle Meek obedient all the way
[2:33:54] to the altar sacrifice
[2:33:57] I heard some Pentecostal preacher here
[2:34:00] in town talk about Isaac 16 years old or
[2:34:03] so and he told him you know you're going
[2:34:06] to be the sacrifice and he said he had
[2:34:08] to chase him down before he got
[2:34:11] he had to wrestle him down and tie him
[2:34:14] up and drag him to the altar screaming
[2:34:16] you can just imagine they thought this
[2:34:18] was a great revelation
[2:34:21] this is what Isaac you know that's the
[2:34:23] way he pictured Isaac
[2:34:24] that was not Isaac
[2:34:28] you see Isaac went
[2:34:30] and when it come down to the point where
[2:34:32] he said God will provide for himself a
[2:34:35] sacrifice
[2:34:37] he'll provide a lamb somebody help me
[2:34:39] preach
[2:34:40] you know Isaac went right up listen
[2:34:42] Isaac was gentle
[2:34:45] he had the cross
[2:34:47] the pack of wood on his shoulder
[2:34:50] he knew what it was to go to church
[2:34:56] amen he knew what it was to participate
[2:34:59] in church
[2:35:02] okay
[2:35:04] amen you know you listen we trained our
[2:35:08] babies from the time they were like this
[2:35:09] sit up pay attention listen yeah
[2:35:12] sometimes they got tired and went to
[2:35:13] sleep
[2:35:14] but we didn't let them duddle all over
[2:35:16] and play games in church and play on
[2:35:19] papers and draw faces and do all that
[2:35:22] come on
[2:35:24] you teach them the worship
[2:35:27] I don't know I don't know sometimes
[2:35:29] what's wrong with your parents that you
[2:35:31] don't even know how to treat your
[2:35:32] children to worship when we're singing
[2:35:35] sing
[2:35:36] when they stand don't lay on the bench
[2:35:38] get up
[2:35:41] if you're clapping hands get your hands
[2:35:43] and clap them sing
[2:35:46] worship participate we're here to
[2:35:50] worship
[2:35:52] from the youngest to the oldest
[2:35:55] I've seen preachers kids are 14 years
[2:35:59] old lay down on the pier and go to sleep
[2:36:01] during church
[2:36:05] oh yeah I've seen it I've seen a lot in
[2:36:07] my 50-something years of preacher got a
[2:36:10] lot more years than that
[2:36:16] but you know there again
[2:36:19] Isaac was no wild man
[2:36:23] he was submissive to what the word said
[2:36:26] whatever the word says do I'll do it if
[2:36:30] I Gotta Die to be resurrected I'll die
[2:36:35] we talk a lot of times about Abraham's
[2:36:38] Faith Isaac had to have a lot of faith
[2:36:41] he had to believe that whatever was
[2:36:43] going to happen he was going to rise up
[2:36:45] again
[2:36:47] is that right
[2:36:49] but you see that's too many now listen
[2:36:51] that's why there's too many of the
[2:36:54] offsprings of today's message churches
[2:36:57] won't be subject to the word
[2:37:01] because they received the word through
[2:37:04] the womb of a bonds woman so The
[2:37:07] Offspring looks half Egyptian
[2:37:18] they go to message Church
[2:37:20] but Egyptians paint is on their face
[2:37:24] oh you forgot your Rotten Tomatoes today
[2:37:29] good thing there's some more
[2:37:31] there is Egyptian clothes
[2:37:34] that are designed by Egyptians and
[2:37:36] they're way too tight
[2:37:40] they got trimmed hair like the Egyptians
[2:37:43] do
[2:37:44] and there's even cross-dressing among
[2:37:47] men and women
[2:37:49] sissified
[2:37:52] and it produces ishmaelites
[2:37:55] people that you have to beg to come to
[2:37:57] church
[2:38:00] you have to drag them
[2:38:03] you don't always have to counsel them in
[2:38:06] their marriage because selfishness and
[2:38:08] pride is still there
[2:38:11] Unforgiven Spirits hate and grudges are
[2:38:15] still there they got Egyptian natures
[2:38:18] come on
[2:38:19] you see why because you're born of an
[2:38:22] intellectual womb by intellectual
[2:38:25] reasoning instead of being a child of
[2:38:27] the supernatural which makes a bunch of
[2:38:30] half a gyps and half breeds
[2:38:35] Street
[2:38:37] look at their night
[2:38:43] you know
[2:38:45] God bless you Sister Rachel
[2:38:48] she came from Tucson
[2:38:50] they love Mexican food
[2:38:54] she picks lots of Mexican food good food
[2:38:57] nothing wrong with that
[2:38:59] because she's a Westerner
[2:39:01] she comes over here
[2:39:03] she might feed you now I'm just making
[2:39:05] up stuff here she might feed you a taco
[2:39:08] for breakfast but it won't be a handmade
[2:39:10] rolling biscuit like here in the south
[2:39:16] and you know what
[2:39:19] she Jessica was raised in Mama's cooking
[2:39:23] she can cook good Mexican
[2:39:26] right
[2:39:27] and Joe has had to eat a lot of tacos
[2:39:30] for breakfast
[2:39:32] there ain't been no tomato gravy and
[2:39:33] homemade biscuits
[2:39:37] because he married a Westerner
[2:39:40] and more than likely the kids
[2:39:43] will be producing tacos and enchiladas
[2:39:46] and
[2:39:47] guacamole and all of that
[2:39:51] it'll pass right on down because
[2:39:56] Jerry married from Indiana married
[2:40:01] a Westerner
[2:40:03] now let me bring this around
[2:40:07] none of that was spiritual
[2:40:11] I'm just using it for example now I got
[2:40:13] your attention where are you going to go
[2:40:15] with this
[2:40:16] how are you going to fix this look at
[2:40:19] the date
[2:40:20] they love Egyptian food of television
[2:40:25] movies
[2:40:27] up all night gaming
[2:40:30] unbridled lust
[2:40:33] pornography
[2:40:36] because they're born of an Egyptian womb
[2:40:43] though they called herself Abraham's
[2:40:46] seed message
[2:40:49] I'm born again I'm the Seed of Abraham I
[2:40:52] cut my teeth on the message Pew I
[2:40:55] believe the message I've accepted but
[2:40:58] yeah that's true but you were born of an
[2:41:00] Egyptian womb because you were born just
[2:41:03] like the denominates of birth children
[2:41:05] by education and an intellectual Revival
[2:41:14] I'm brother Tim you just called a bunch
[2:41:17] ishmaelites you know the good thing
[2:41:19] about it
[2:41:21] the difference is between you and
[2:41:23] Ishmael are you in Judas are you in Cain
[2:41:27] is you can't be born again
[2:41:32] and you can be born of the womb of the
[2:41:35] supernatural
[2:41:36] Hallelujah
[2:41:38] God by the power of the Holy Ghost at
[2:41:41] Birth you a gentle Isaac
[2:41:45] hallelujah amen where and when the
[2:41:48] message is preached intellectually there
[2:41:51] are no Miracles there are no gifts of
[2:41:54] the Spirit and the Supernatural is
[2:41:57] absent
[2:41:59] and Sarah's atmosphere had to be changed
[2:42:01] back to Acts 2 again
[2:42:04] in order to bring forth Children of the
[2:42:07] word and the only kind the word can
[2:42:09] bring forth are Acts 2 tongue-speaking
[2:42:11] blabber and scream them shouting
[2:42:13] youngins
[2:42:15] let me read it again
[2:42:17] and I'm in overtime I'm closing down
[2:42:22] soon
[2:42:25] and I'll let you know how soon
[2:42:28] navigation can never bring life it takes
[2:42:31] the spirit of God to bring life and life
[2:42:33] cannot come out of just the intellectual
[2:42:35] Revival it's got to come out of the
[2:42:37] Bible word Revival and the word is the
[2:42:39] same yesterday today and forever and
[2:42:41] when it falls today and quickens you get
[2:42:44] the same results
[2:42:47] that you did in Acts 2.
[2:42:50] so now you can tell if the word is being
[2:42:53] preached by the results
[2:42:55] [Applause]
[2:42:57] if the word is preached the results will
[2:43:01] be Acts 2 again
[2:43:03] amen what was happening with Acts 2
[2:43:07] Church come on now you know what Silver
[2:43:10] and Gold Have I None but such as I have
[2:43:12] give unity in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:43:15] rise up and walk
[2:43:17] that book of Acts people had something
[2:43:20] to give
[2:43:23] not like a lot of bankrupt churches
[2:43:25] today it takes atmosphere so that's why
[2:43:29] your men are taught to bring your
[2:43:30] children here he said I want my daughter
[2:43:32] Rebecca to come in and sit down he said
[2:43:34] you saw me weak in a woman it was my
[2:43:36] daughter and she come in and sat down I
[2:43:38] want her to receive the baptism of the
[2:43:40] spirit and that's why she's here in the
[2:43:42] meeting that's the purpose of it it
[2:43:43] takes atmosphere
[2:43:46] Dr Bosworth said you can take a hit in
[2:43:48] the egg and put it under a pup it will
[2:43:50] hatch a chicken because it's an egg and
[2:43:52] it's got the right atmosphere I don't
[2:43:54] care if your Methodist Baptist present
[2:43:56] here in the right atmosphere the bats
[2:43:59] out a brand new child of God claim the
[2:44:01] word it's the atmosphere that does it no
[2:44:04] matter what the denominational tag you
[2:44:06] got
[2:44:09] foreign
[2:44:11] as he said when a church or any group of
[2:44:14] people assumed together and pray
[2:44:16] until they throw away their Creeds and
[2:44:19] things and look straight in the face of
[2:44:21] God and bring forth the Eagles as soon
