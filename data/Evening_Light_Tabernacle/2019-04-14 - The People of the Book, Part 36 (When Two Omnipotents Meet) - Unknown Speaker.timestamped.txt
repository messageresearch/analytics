[28:34] their words for him then I don't have
[28:37] them you see my words are few and to try
[28:40] and capture the one true God usually my
[28:43] vocabulary would never do but I use
[28:46] words as an expression an expression of
[28:49] worship to the same

[29:19] sight putting me with mercies in the
[29:21] morning trying to be with grace in the
[29:23] night but if there was for him
[29:27] what I do have is
[29:30] my god new words would never do
[29:36] we use the point to the truth so he sent
[29:39] His Son Jesus crisis we were living

[44:39] looking there with great anticipation
[44:41] for the meeting the Lord speaking to
[44:43] them about the different needs and so
[44:46] we're just looking to the Lord to really
[44:49] speak to us in a mighty way also I
[44:54] wanted to say that as I drove up I as I
[45:00] pulled in before there was a few come
[45:04] but just a few cars here this morning my
[45:07] wife and I arrived and and it was
[45:09] grateful that the roads were all open
[45:11] after the six inches of rain that we got
[45:13] yesterday and so we were happy for that
[45:16] be able to come and you know as I drove
[45:20] up in in the parking lot I looked over
[45:22] at my wife and I mentioned about
[45:25] Walker's Chapel and the church there or
[45:29] I first started preaching when I was
[45:33] only 15 years old
[45:34] and that's been now nearly 50 years ago
[45:39] February coming up will be 50 years of
[45:42] ministry I started there had never
[45:44] stopped a man and so you know today
[45:47] we're here because of our love for the
[45:50] Lord Jesus and for this message that God
[45:52] sent a message of restoration in this
[45:55] endtime I was really pleased to hear
[45:59] that the brother Leo's sister Helen was
[46:02] here today and we're happy to have the
[46:04] Chambliss is also the Nelsons that are
[46:06] here it's so good to have you in the
[46:09] service with us and we're just looking
[46:11] to the Lord and all of you that is
[46:12] assembled I know there's different
[46:15] members of the life family that were
[46:16] here for the baby dedication also other
[46:21] extended family so we're just really
[46:23] happy to have you in the service with us
[46:25] today a man but we're thankful for Jesus
[46:29] without him or nothing a man he's all
[46:33] he's the reason we live he's the reason
[46:36] that we endure Amen he's the reason we
[46:39] believe a man let's turn to mark chapter
[46:42] 11 verse 20 if you will will stand for
[46:45] the reading of the word as we just go
[46:48] into the scripture once more this
[46:50] morning this was the scripture that
[46:53] brother Branham was complicate
[46:55] contemplating upon when when the third
[46:59] pull of his ministry would would come
[47:03] into effect and would begin to show the
[47:06] power of it and would show in the power
[47:08] of creation and in mark 11 verse 20 and
[47:12] in the morning as they passed by they
[47:16] saw the fig tree dried up from the roots
[47:18] and Peter calling to remembrance said
[47:21] unto him master behold the fig tree
[47:24] which thou curses is withered away and
[47:28] Jesus answering said unto them have
[47:31] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[47:35] that whosoever shall say to this
[47:38] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[47:40] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[47:44] his heart but shall believe that those
[47:46] things which he saith shall come to pass
[47:49] he shall have whatsoever
[47:52] sayeth therefore I say unto you what
[47:56] things soever you desire when you pray
[47:59] believe that you receive them and you
[48:02] shall have them a man of God bless you
[48:06] you can be seated
[48:09] may God bless his word today as we just
[48:12] look into some things in the word I'm
[48:14] going to be speaking today on when to
[48:17] omnipotence meet and we're we're
[48:21] speaking here as we've been ministering
[48:24] on the people of the book it's a subject
[48:27] that I have ministered on since I
[48:29] visited the land of of Israel last year
[48:33] and just have been sharing some of the
[48:36] things that inspired my heart while I
[48:39] was there and as we look into the word
[48:41] to see even as they are people that have
[48:45] been returned to their homeland that I
[48:48] believe that the Bride of Christ is a
[48:50] people that we have been turned to our
[48:52] homeland and our homeland is the Holy
[48:55] Ghost the Word of God amen and and of
[48:59] course with Israel there there are many
[49:02] things to be conquered as you know the
[49:04] Golan Heights has just been acknowledged
[49:07] by our own presidents as being a part of
[49:09] Israel and so they you know they are
[49:13] people that are trying to reclaim an
[49:16] ancient homeland and of course they
[49:19] couldn't have done that without God and
[49:21] they couldn't do that without prophecy
[49:24] being for them because the Word of God
[49:26] had set it into motion many many years
[49:29] ago and so is the Word of God put into
[49:32] motion that the the words of the
[49:35] promises says I will restore saith the
[49:39] Lord
[49:40] and so with Israel their mountains to be
[49:43] conquered fig trees to be moved
[49:46] scriptures to be fulfilled and I think
[49:49] there are same thing for us there are
[49:51] mountains to be moved
[49:53] there are fig trees to be to be moved
[49:56] and scriptures to be fulfilled and Jesus
[50:00] is telling us that nothing shall be
[50:04] impossible to you
[50:06] and that's because that of course God is
[50:08] sin and Elijah prophet to turn our
[50:10] hearts back to faith again remember this
[50:14] was necessary in our day in our hour
[50:17] because we were a people that were
[50:20] bewildered and confused and an analyst
[50:24] scattered out in denominationalism as
[50:26] Israel was a people bewildered and
[50:29] confused about even their origin or
[50:32] their destiny and then were persecuted
[50:36] group that were scattered out among the
[50:38] nations and as God has gathered down my
[50:41] believe that God has gather the people
[50:43] back to his word and so - and of course
[50:47] as that will unfold in the the hours of
[50:52] days ahead and the Tribulation Period
[50:54] after the bride is gone where Elijah and
[50:57] Moses will will bring and present Christ
[51:00] back - on the Jews again and their
[51:03] hearts will be turned back to the faith
[51:06] of the of the father's back to the faith
[51:09] of the received the son Jesus Christ and
[51:12] I believe in this day that God has
[51:14] promised the same for us that he sent
[51:18] unto us a message in this last day to
[51:21] turn our hearts back to faith again to
[51:24] cause us to start believing a man and to
[51:28] believe we're gonna have to believe in
[51:30] the impossible that with that which is
[51:33] impossible with man is possible with God
[51:36] that even as we look forward to a
[51:39] resurrection and to a rapture though how
[51:43] impossible that may seem for God to be
[51:46] able to gather all the dust of the bones
[51:49] of the ones that have went on before is
[51:52] through the ages and gather them up in a
[51:55] glorious resurrection and the rapture of
[51:58] the church and change us as we're
[52:00] standing on our feet in a moment in a
[52:02] twinkling of an eye I believe it'll take
[52:05] a people that believe in the impossible
[52:08] Amen that the impossible becomes a
[52:11] possibility and this is what we're
[52:13] wanting to look
[52:14] today because remember as I just want to
[52:17] share with you just a few little quotes
[52:19] that there there will come a messenger
[52:22] in the last day that will guide the
[52:24] people back to the first fruit back to
[52:28] the original faith granite Lord that is
[52:31] great messenger among us now the great
[52:33] Christ the Holy Spirit made vivid made
[52:36] understanding opening up the word and
[52:39] revealing us to us may he guide them
[52:42] back to the original Pentecostal faith
[52:45] like Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[52:48] repair number one of you and be baptized
[52:52] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[52:54] remission of sins man and there's a
[52:57] promise that goes with that and you
[52:59] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[53:02] which is our homeland because the Holy
[53:05] Ghost is the word and the word is the
[53:07] Holy Ghost because the word is God and
[53:09] the Holy Ghost is God that one and the
[53:12] same and to be turned back to our
[53:14] homeland is to turn us back to the word
[53:16] again but it's more than a word it's the
[53:19] person of Jesus Christ
[53:21] the reality reality of the gospel also
[53:24] brother Branham would say in the god of
[53:26] this evil age he said just as a seed of
[53:29] the church fell back there with the
[53:30] signs and the wonders and the Living
[53:32] Christ among them it ends up in the last
[53:35] days under the ministry of Malachi 4 and
[53:39] restores back again the original faith
[53:42] that was once given what a promise that
[53:45] yes a mime again and going beyond the
[53:48] camp this sharing a few of these he said
[53:51] Lord the pool is ready for the first
[53:53] move after repentance because the first
[53:55] move after repentance is to be baptized
[53:58] in his name right and then a promise to
[54:01] to receive the Holy Ghost and in this
[54:04] last day our calling back to the
[54:06] original faith the original prescription
[54:10] while we sing to many people away from
[54:13] Christ dying under these other man-made
[54:16] prescriptions but they may be ever so
[54:19] good in their denomination but lord I
[54:21] want your prescription
[54:23] our doctor there's a doctor there's a
[54:25] balm in Gilead there's a physician here
[54:28] to heal ever since its soul to heal ever
[54:31] physical being great doctor of all times
[54:35] great creator of the heavens and earth
[54:37] come now will you among us and speak to
[54:40] us in the name of Jesus Christ I tell
[54:42] you that was his prayer damned that's
[54:44] our prayer today man again and the Feast
[54:47] of the trumpet said therefore during the
[54:49] time of the Reformation that come into
[54:51] reformers as the seven seals proved it
[54:54] was but in the last days now honey
[54:56] believes were living in the last days it
[54:58] was supposed to be revealed again we
[55:01] find the scripture Malekith for that
[55:03] there is to be an anointing come down to
[55:07] restore again that original faith and to
[55:12] bring the faith of the people back to
[55:15] the original Pentecost the aroo the
[55:18] faith of the fathers I believe that
[55:21] today don't you
[55:21] and then there's an anointing that has
[55:24] come down I want to say that anointing
[55:26] is still here among us to bring either
[55:29] bring us back to the original faith
[55:32] again to cause our hearts to believe not
[55:36] to sit down in this last and evil agent
[55:39] and Laodicea into a faithless generation
[55:43] but a people who believe in this last
[55:46] days
[55:47] how many believers this morning and man
[55:50] that God wants you to believe his word
[55:52] and his word a promises promises a
[55:56] restoration in this last day a
[55:58] restoration of faith again for people to
[56:02] be able to begin to believe to believe
[56:05] for the impossible again in feasts of
[56:09] the trumpets he would come to the end of
[56:11] his sermon there and say remember that
[56:14] Gentile bride is to have a prophet
[56:16] called
[56:17] Elias Elijah that is to call them out of
[56:20] the traditions the bride just the same
[56:23] as these prophets called the Jews out of
[56:25] Judaism to Christ the atonement this
[56:28] will happen there under the Ministry of
[56:31] Moses and Elijah
[56:33] the Gentiles already knows the atonement
[56:36] but it's to call the bride back to the
[56:40] original atonement so again to call us
[56:44] back to the original Tommy to the
[56:47] original blood to the original
[56:49] prescription and man to the original
[56:52] promise to the original Pentecost a man
[56:57] now there of course have been
[56:59] organizations that have been grafted
[57:02] into the vine of the tree and these are
[57:04] like suckers that are suffering the life
[57:06] and competing for the light but in spite
[57:09] of all of that God is gonna have a bride
[57:12] tree a man all that the cattle are made
[57:15] I'm quoting Joel chapter 2 and the
[57:18] caterpillar ate and he said I will
[57:21] restore saith the Lord and Malachi 4
[57:24] tells us we'll be brought back to the
[57:27] original faith like it was on the day of
[57:30] Pentecost the faith of the fathers and
[57:33] we believe it will come and he says I
[57:36] believe it it is time for it now
[57:39] well how many's ready for a man well
[57:43] I'll tell you we see limbs that are
[57:45] withering away we see people that are
[57:47] caught up in Laodicea we see people that
[57:50] are are dying on the vine as it was but
[57:54] ever forever ever Lamb that is on that
[57:56] vine that the father didn't plan it will
[57:59] be plucked up and everything that will
[58:02] not bear fruit will be cut off a man
[58:05] it's a fruit barrel now and God is
[58:08] looking for people who will offer back
[58:10] the fruit of faith again or people who
[58:13] will believe him now we we notice that
[58:19] again that in in this a restoring faith
[58:24] were promised in Malachi 4 to be
[58:26] returned back to the original faith back
[58:29] to the original seed back to the seed
[58:32] that mean like it began on the day of
[58:35] Pentecost back to the same doctoring
[58:38] word by word powered by power spirit by
[58:42] the same
[58:43] thing exactly like it was back in the
[58:46] beginning through signs and wonders of
[58:48] the living presence of God a man so
[58:52] after 2,000 years we can see today he's
[58:55] still alive and he's still living among
[58:58] his people
[58:59] dwelling among the candlesticks walking
[59:01] among his church revealing himself to be
[59:05] still the living Christ he's not a dead
[59:08] Creed and he's not a form of godliness
[59:11] that denies the power thereof but he's a
[59:14] real living God that will show itself
[59:18] alive among his people but you know with
[59:21] the Israel and in that day of Israel
[59:25] there was so much unbelief in the land
[59:27] and even the disciples their hearts was
[59:30] being excited to believe and they were
[59:34] starting to believe and power was being
[59:36] given to them to cast Satan out and as
[59:41] it did there came a very hard case to
[59:44] them that we'll read about here in a
[59:47] moment
[59:48] man matter of fact let's just read it in
[59:50] Matthew 17 and verse 19 and the
[59:53] disciples were brought a very difficult
[59:55] case of a child that would constantly
[59:59] because of an evil spirit threw itself
[1:00:02] into fire throw itself in the water
[1:00:04] always a self-destructive spirit that -
[1:00:09] sounds like the world we live in today
[1:00:12] self-destruction everywhere
[1:00:14] my people are so hurting until they're
[1:00:18] cutting themselves a man and destroying
[1:00:22] their own lives but I want to testify
[1:00:25] today of a god that's a restorer
[1:00:28] somebody with me now that just brings
[1:00:32] from my mountain my memory a little
[1:00:35] child down at youth camp a young girl
[1:00:37] actually a teenage girl that had comin
[1:00:40] and C it had a difficult life and hated
[1:00:44] herself want to destroy herself and
[1:00:47] slice the wrists she was in so much pain
[1:00:50] demons had got ahold of her until she
[1:00:52] was cutting her
[1:00:53] South and time to destroy her life and
[1:00:57] then God and His mercy got ahold of her
[1:01:01] and turned her life around
[1:01:04] hey man but you know even though her
[1:01:07] life was turned around now as a young
[1:01:10] woman she still bores the scholars this
[1:01:15] is what we try to keep you young people
[1:01:17] from having to do bear the scars the
[1:01:21] hurts and shame of sin the men that if
[1:01:25] you come to the Lord at a young age this
[1:01:27] is why we have youth camp and then give
[1:01:29] you a chance get you in an atmosphere
[1:01:31] where the Holy Spirit can deal with your
[1:01:34] life and change you man not only that
[1:01:37] we've tried to provide that in every
[1:01:40] service to have that kind of atmosphere
[1:01:43] where people can be born again and my
[1:01:47] not other dried confession but a real
[1:01:50] life-changing experience that brings you
[1:01:53] to God and cleanses your life and deals
[1:01:56] with it that sin issue and changes your
[1:01:59] nature this young girl now this had
[1:02:02] happened to her and she was now in an
[1:02:04] camp and and she was still wearing the
[1:02:09] scars the scars of on her risks where
[1:02:13] she had sliced it and there to us she
[1:02:17] wanted to lift her hands to worship God
[1:02:20] she wanted to praise His name but she
[1:02:23] was seemed to the scars she wore you
[1:02:27] know maybe sleeves and things that would
[1:02:29] hold over other past shames she's
[1:02:34] sitting there in the service and she's
[1:02:36] saying oh I would really like the
[1:02:38] worship god I'd really like to give him
[1:02:40] praise I really love just hurling raised
[1:02:42] my hands but I have this everybody will
[1:02:45] see these ugly scars but she said he's
[1:02:50] my Lord and I'm gonna do it anyhow and
[1:02:53] she raised her hands and begin to
[1:02:56] worship Him a man freely and begin to
[1:02:59] praise God and as she did the scars fell
[1:03:02] off
[1:03:03] arms and they were no more visible a man
[1:03:07] completely healed and gold I'm talking
[1:03:10] about a God that is rich in mercy I'm
[1:03:13] talking about a God whose a God of first
[1:03:16] chances and second chances and third
[1:03:18] chances and four chances helicopter that
[1:03:21] not only shield you and deliver you but
[1:03:24] also remove the scars of your life high
[1:03:28] will restore sayeth the Lord but away
[1:03:35] this young man in the Bible he
[1:03:39] constantly was trying to destroy his
[1:03:41] life and the Bible said the disciples
[1:03:46] had prayed over him remember they had
[1:03:48] been given power to cast him out now
[1:03:52] something happened it was struggling
[1:03:56] with some his shoes and they were not
[1:03:58] able to cast the Spirit out and then
[1:04:03] they brought him to Jesus you know this
[1:04:06] is always important if we can get just
[1:04:09] teach you in the presence of Jesus laws
[1:04:13] we're just men gathered here amen maybe
[1:04:16] that ain't much but when God gathers
[1:04:18] among us we're not just a lifeless your
[1:04:21] meaningless gathering of people and man
[1:04:24] we're people of God that's what we want
[1:04:27] we want his presence welcomed but they
[1:04:30] wait so they would gentlemen and finally
[1:04:32] that would come to Jesus and bring him
[1:04:35] to Jesus and Jesus would cast him out
[1:04:38] and verse 19 of chapter 17 then the
[1:04:42] disciples came to Jesus apart and said
[1:04:44] why could not we cast him out and Jesus
[1:04:50] said in them because of your unbelief
[1:04:53] for verily I say to you if you have
[1:04:56] faith as a grain of mustard seed you
[1:05:00] shall say to this mountain remove hence
[1:05:03] to yonder place and it shall remove and
[1:05:06] nothing
[1:05:07] somebody say nothing nothing shall be
[1:05:10] impossible to you I wonder do we as
[1:05:14] Christians believe that
[1:05:16] and we ought to this is something that
[1:05:20] our Lord said about us hey man I think
[1:05:24] of these disciples the failure to cast
[1:05:27] out the evil spirit by the disciples III
[1:05:31] can't would like to look at it this way
[1:05:34] for a moment the disciples started out
[1:05:36] perhaps they were praying in faith and
[1:05:39] when immediate results were not seen
[1:05:42] they began praying and unbelief and
[1:05:46] maybe they started out as Peter did with
[1:05:50] great faith walking on the water
[1:05:52] but then begin to look at the
[1:05:55] mountainous waves and the tumultuous
[1:05:57] winds and maybe faith gave way to
[1:06:00] unbelief as they began to look at this
[1:06:03] voice symptoms as he would frost at the
[1:06:06] mouth as he would roll there and his in
[1:06:11] his spasm in his agony in the cries of
[1:06:14] the parents and her unbelieving and to
[1:06:16] grow and grow and grow until Jesus came
[1:06:24] you know faith jesus said all it takes
[1:06:30] it's just faith as a grain of mustard
[1:06:33] seed just a tiny bit of phrases all
[1:06:37] minister needed to conquer any mountain
[1:06:40] faith is a powerful gift of God and the
[1:06:45] inner born-again believer has faith a
[1:06:48] man using the you know me and we know
[1:06:52] that because without faith it's
[1:06:55] impossible to please God he that cometh
[1:06:58] to God must believe that he is nothing
[1:07:01] he was or that he was gonna be but that
[1:07:03] he is and that he'll reward those that
[1:07:06] diligently seek Him this is part of the
[1:07:09] very law of faith notice as we're saying
[1:07:13] but using the that tiny mustard chia
[1:07:16] seed ax as an example
[1:07:18] Jesus illustrates the omnipotent power
[1:07:21] of God unleashed in those who have
[1:07:24] through faith true faith is a new
[1:07:27] product
[1:07:29] it's a limited in power when it's
[1:07:32] connected to an unlimited God hey man
[1:07:37] now Dever man is even given a measure of
[1:07:40] faith I would say I would submit that
[1:07:43] even unbelief is faith it's a it's faith
[1:07:47] that's aimed in the wrong direction
[1:07:48] believing in the wrong thing you gotta
[1:07:51] have a lot of faith to believe there is
[1:07:53] no God you've gotta have a lot of faith
[1:07:56] to believe that this world here just
[1:07:59] kind of came out of you know I'm just
[1:08:02] noting that there's nothing created
[1:08:04] nothing hey man you've got to have a lot
[1:08:08] of faith to believe that
[1:08:10] so it's faith but it's aimed in the
[1:08:12] wrong direction
[1:08:13] that's what Malachi 4 was sent to do to
[1:08:16] turn our hearts back come on to faith
[1:08:20] again two calls of people and start
[1:08:23] believing again a people to believe in
[1:08:26] what others are thinking impossible they
[1:08:29] begin to see as a possibility
[1:08:33] amen and Jesus would say nothing is
[1:08:37] impossible 200 beliefs the biggest
[1:08:44] obstacle in your life the greatest thing
[1:08:47] that you're facing the biggest problem
[1:08:50] in your family there is nothing
[1:08:52] impossible now but he illustrates by
[1:09:01] that seed that little seed of faith he
[1:09:04] says you know there's enough omnipotent
[1:09:07] in that faith that it will create it
[1:09:12] absolutely move a mountain or it'll look
[1:09:16] up a big tree or in a movie the
[1:09:20] obstacles there's enough evidence in
[1:09:23] that but it's got to be connected to our
[1:09:27] not never to God hey man now this is
[1:09:34] what we're going to be talking about
[1:09:35] today is that connection that connects
[1:09:38] you to an omnipotent God now
[1:09:42] everything from the writing of the Old
[1:09:44] Testament to Calvary to the church ages
[1:09:47] with its messengers the message that we
[1:09:50] received the seven seals revealed every
[1:09:53] mystery of the Bible has been revealed
[1:09:57] in order to prepare you for a miracle I
[1:10:00] you know I shared some little quotations
[1:10:04] last week and I want to just bring him
[1:10:06] back to your the father in front of your
[1:10:08] memory actually was two weeks ago
[1:10:10] because brother John Andy's bless us
[1:10:12] last weekend but anyway we he said
[1:10:16] brother Branham would talk about Noah
[1:10:18] building our and he said he was not only
[1:10:21] working a miracle he was preparing for a
[1:10:24] miracle I wonder how many hearts are
[1:10:28] really prepared for the miracle of the
[1:10:30] body change prepared for the miraculous
[1:10:34] of the dead and price rising oh the
[1:10:37] great rapture of the church well that's
[1:10:39] what's promising our generation and in
[1:10:42] order to bring it there's got to be
[1:10:44] hearts prepared for that rapture now he
[1:10:48] said now the church today is not only
[1:10:50] having miracles but it's preparing for a
[1:10:53] marathon and I just brought it out
[1:10:55] gentle even last Sunday you know we have
[1:10:58] seen God working in so many different
[1:11:01] ways
[1:11:02] and when we've seen him work through the
[1:11:03] messenger through the divine healing
[1:11:05] movement whether with the blind eyes
[1:11:07] open and the deaf ears hearing and the
[1:11:10] many miraculous things has taken place
[1:11:13] are you with me
[1:11:15] I mean we've seen God working in his
[1:11:18] miracles and and his mighty wonders and
[1:11:21] and by the working of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:24] let me just stop just for a moment let
[1:11:27] me share with you just this newspaper
[1:11:29] article I I received today um it's an
[1:11:32] old one that comes from 1949 but it's
[1:11:36] tweaking about the services of William
[1:11:38] Branham back in 1949 in the great divine
[1:11:43] healing campaign when the Holy Spirit
[1:11:45] was moving in such a miraculous way and
[1:11:48] remember it is to prepare us to believe
[1:11:53] dr. shreek down on unbelief but to
[1:11:56] believe not become more faithless Jesus
[1:12:00] wondered when he look down through time
[1:12:02] he said will I find faith on the earth
[1:12:05] this is what he's looking for somebody
[1:12:08] to believe him
[1:12:10] now but anyway this is a little
[1:12:13] newspaper article I'm just going to
[1:12:14] share it with you this this comes here
[1:12:17] from a paper in representing cities of
[1:12:23] North Chicago it was dated March the
[1:12:26] 24th 1949 and the the reporter was Fanny
[1:12:31] Wilson and she was writing in the
[1:12:33] community news of the Chicago paper said
[1:12:37] in the last night's service a young boy
[1:12:40] paralyzed in his arms legs and back
[1:12:43] twisted out of shape was brought by his
[1:12:47] mother from Bensenville Illinois and was
[1:12:50] prayed far and immediately after prayer
[1:12:53] he walked straight and steadily from the
[1:12:56] platform without aid to women who had
[1:12:59] been blinded with cataracts for two
[1:13:03] years were healed in the same service
[1:13:05] and after being led to the platform they
[1:13:09] they were prayed then prayed for the
[1:13:11] first was able to see and walk as her
[1:13:14] husband said even those bloodshot veins
[1:13:18] and her and her eyes were clearly she
[1:13:22] followed up with that said the main
[1:13:24] difference between William Branham and
[1:13:28] most everyone else is then the Bible to
[1:13:32] them that the Bible is ancient history
[1:13:34] to their to him is just as vital and a
[1:13:38] positive of force now as it was in the
[1:13:41] days of Jesus of Nazareth and what makes
[1:13:45] the story difference is that Reverend
[1:13:47] William Branham proceeds to prove his
[1:13:50] contention not that he can dear contends
[1:13:53] but far from it but brother Branham is
[1:13:56] more humble than all the humble men you
[1:13:58] have ever seen put together now so you
[1:14:02] see this was their record
[1:14:05] and what God did even before I was born
[1:14:08] to start getting your faith to believe a
[1:14:12] man a little mind then know how we ought
[1:14:15] to be today are people of faith are
[1:14:18] people who can believe are people who
[1:14:20] will stand on the Word of God come on
[1:14:23] amen Oh mind we have seen God moved now
[1:14:28] we can testify of his feeling virtuous
[1:14:31] we can testify a big healing cancer and
[1:14:34] alopecia and given the sight back to the
[1:14:38] blind and healing brain bleeds and on
[1:14:41] and on and on and on and on that we can
[1:14:43] see that has happened right here in this
[1:14:45] assembly because people have began to
[1:14:49] believe because these kind of things
[1:14:52] that we spoke out of the past has
[1:14:54] inspired our faith to believe God will
[1:14:57] restore that time still God that God
[1:15:00] still heals that God still delivers that
[1:15:04] still saves that he still fills with the
[1:15:08] Holy Ghost that stopped is the same
[1:15:11] hallelujah and his name has power
[1:15:14] his name is full of glory and his name
[1:15:18] is above every other name never deceive
[1:15:22] never problem has about through the name
[1:15:25] of Jesus that it's a name of Jesus every
[1:15:31] knee cancer has to bow to it blind eyes
[1:15:35] that's about to it and whenever disease
[1:15:38] has to bow to the name of Jesus and
[1:15:41] confess he's ruler are you with me so
[1:15:47] now brother Branham was saying another
[1:15:48] church today is not only having miracles
[1:15:52] but it's preparing for a miracle the
[1:15:56] coming of the Lord Jesus and the rapture
[1:15:59] the church to be taken up
[1:16:01] give me a church ready and he uses it
[1:16:05] like this visualized to see signs and
[1:16:09] and to see the admitted God and the
[1:16:12] great power of God moving among the
[1:16:14] people which the rapture will be an easy
[1:16:16] thing when Jesus comes
[1:16:18] they'll be caught up because they
[1:16:20] believe in such sure we're at the end
[1:16:23] time we're at a junction road the
[1:16:25] crossing time the ending of a
[1:16:28] dispensation the beginning of a new and
[1:16:32] there's been six of those and we're on
[1:16:34] the seventh in other words we come
[1:16:36] through 6,000 years since Eden and man's
[1:16:39] fall and we're about to see the dawn of
[1:16:43] a millennial day now so again he speaks
[1:16:50] about this said of nebadon spoke had
[1:16:53] every Junction and when the church
[1:16:56] cooled off and then the n' evidence both
[1:16:59] miracles take place and this is a
[1:17:02] junction of all junctions let me tell
[1:17:05] you just because he said that some 50 60
[1:17:08] years ago doesn't change it because
[1:17:11] we're still at that junction we're still
[1:17:14] right on the border of the rapture we're
[1:17:16] still right on the border of a
[1:17:18] millennium ahead we're still right here
[1:17:21] on the edge of Phoenix and of all things
[1:17:24] and we're here at the junction of
[1:17:27] junctions hey man and there this is the
[1:17:31] end time how many can declare that man
[1:17:34] that you saw a brother Timna there's a
[1:17:36] they've been saying that for years let
[1:17:38] me tell you why cuz her husband in times
[1:17:40] hey man there was an end time for eating
[1:17:44] back in Adams day there was an end time
[1:17:48] for Noah oh man there was an end time
[1:17:52] for Sodom and Gomorrah there was in time
[1:17:55] for the Jewish dispensation and now
[1:17:58] we're at the end time for the Gentile
[1:18:01] dispensation so yeah there's always been
[1:18:03] in times but they've all been 42 that's
[1:18:07] in time and we're hearing the fulfilling
[1:18:11] of all things the wrapping up of the
[1:18:15] dispensation of grace she said this is
[1:18:20] the end of the whole history of the
[1:18:22] world is right now so you can expect
[1:18:26] omnipotence to speak and you can expect
[1:18:30] the greatest and
[1:18:32] yes miracles that ever happened on the
[1:18:34] earth will happen in the next few years
[1:18:36] to come and we're still in that
[1:18:39] dispensation of the unfolding of the end
[1:18:42] time now Jesus the gospel of Jesus is
[1:18:48] totally different than this namby-pamby
[1:18:51] gospel is being preached out in the
[1:18:53] world today his doctrine is totally
[1:18:58] different than the doctrines that are
[1:19:00] being preached in a majority of churches
[1:19:02] around the world let me just go ahead
[1:19:06] and define one more time for you that
[1:19:09] doctrine and mark 1:22 and they were
[1:19:12] astonished at his doctrine for he taught
[1:19:16] his one that had Authority and not as
[1:19:18] the scribes and that Jesus did a mighty
[1:19:22] miracle and brother great healing in
[1:19:25] verse 27 and they were all amazed it is
[1:19:29] so much as they questioned among
[1:19:31] themselves saying one thing is this what
[1:19:35] new doctrine is this but with authority
[1:19:38] commandeth even the evil unclean spirits
[1:19:41] and they do obey Him so the real
[1:19:46] doctrine of Jesus what is preached cast
[1:19:49] Satan out that's what real salvation is
[1:19:53] it's not teaching you how to live with
[1:19:56] your devil how to live with your complex
[1:19:59] how to live with your sin how to live
[1:20:02] with your habit it's casting shake it
[1:20:05] out and true doctrine when it's preached
[1:20:10] and I will bring for the holy people a
[1:20:13] man you are brittle Oh hallelujah and I
[1:20:16] bring the Holy Spirit down and cause you
[1:20:19] to live a holy life
[1:20:22] modesty will no longer be a word we talk
[1:20:24] about but it'll be a word that is
[1:20:26] demonstrated it is people both men and
[1:20:30] women come on church somebody help me
[1:20:34] preach now a man what kind of doctrine
[1:20:37] is this what new doctrine is this and
[1:20:41] I'll tell you what this is still new to
[1:20:43] most places because they don't know this
[1:20:46] doctor this doctrine just out unclean
[1:20:50] spirits now let's talk about this for a
[1:20:56] moment
[1:20:58] in the original going into the land
[1:21:01] leave in Egypt as Israel would go for
[1:21:05] their first time into their homeland as
[1:21:09] Justin was looking into the land God
[1:21:12] would speak to him and say be the strong
[1:21:15] and very courageous foreign to you I
[1:21:19] have given this lamb and ever foot ever
[1:21:23] place your foot is given to tread upon
[1:21:26] that I have given to you a mite now I
[1:21:31] want to just bring that right down to
[1:21:33] you because we are here taking
[1:21:35] possession of every promise of God this
[1:21:39] is our holy land amen this is what we
[1:21:44] must conquer this is what we must
[1:21:47] possess in other words come on somebody
[1:21:49] every devil that is squatted on a
[1:21:52] promise of God has to be cast out from
[1:21:55] every unbelief has got to be tore down
[1:21:59] and my people have got to stop believing
[1:22:02] this book is mine every word of this is
[1:22:05] mine every promise of this is mine is
[1:22:09] mine
[1:22:10] Jesus died for it he paid for it and
[1:22:14] it's my inalienable right to possess
[1:22:18] this land
[1:22:22] hey ma'am now the same thing with Joshua
[1:22:26] when he stood there looking at that new
[1:22:29] land that God spoke to him and caught
[1:22:32] but giving these words be strong
[1:22:36] and be thou courageous for do you I have
[1:22:41] given this land could we just bring that
[1:22:45] and fast-forward it and place it right
[1:22:47] in our moment in our time hey man this
[1:22:51] promise is still real if it meant that
[1:22:54] for a physical people for a physical
[1:22:57] land Amen which was only foreshadowing
[1:23:00] and typing and speaking of something
[1:23:02] greater to come somebody help me preach
[1:23:04] aim and then so that word should be so
[1:23:08] applicable to us in this moment be not
[1:23:11] strong be a courageous I've given you
[1:23:16] this mountain I'm giving you this land
[1:23:18] I'm giving you this promise it is yours
[1:23:22] it's for your children and your
[1:23:24] children's children put those in our
[1:23:26] fall even as many as the Lord our God
[1:23:29] shall call I've given you this land
[1:23:31] don't put your foot on it go possess it
[1:23:37] hey mom
[1:23:40] now would you to hear the words of a
[1:23:42] prophet if he would say and as I was
[1:23:45] with Moses so will I be with you there's
[1:23:48] volumes spoken that title as I was with
[1:23:53] Moses so will I be with you as I was
[1:23:57] during that Exodus so I'm here in this
[1:24:01] Exodus now Joshua the new commander to
[1:24:08] lead an army his second to the place for
[1:24:11] the great man like Moses stood there was
[1:24:14] no little task and I think of a minister
[1:24:18] today that is called a God to step into
[1:24:23] the tracks where Jesus do it what a
[1:24:26] command what a commission but that's
[1:24:30] what but each that's called of God is
[1:24:33] commissioned to stand in that same place
[1:24:37] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:24:40] of the way each Minister is called to
[1:24:44] stand where he would the works that I do
[1:24:47] say you do also its ministers ordained
[1:24:52] of God is commanded to stand in the
[1:24:55] tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the
[1:24:59] duties that Jesus performed and that's
[1:25:02] quite a command hallelujah man I know
[1:25:07] that too man I answered that to man some
[1:25:10] fifty years ago when he called me to
[1:25:14] preach come on now man and I've stood
[1:25:17] right there in that very tracks where
[1:25:19] Jesus stood and then proclaiming the
[1:25:22] Word of God saying that God makes a
[1:25:25] promise to this last generation and it
[1:25:29] does in the end with a godsend and a
[1:25:31] prophet it continues right out as as a
[1:25:34] bride is called in this last day and God
[1:25:38] calling up people for his name sake amen
[1:25:41] amen the works that I do say you do also
[1:25:45] every minister is ordained of God
[1:25:48] commanded the stand and the tracks of
[1:25:50] Jesus Christ and perform the duties that
[1:25:53] Jesus performed that's quite a command
[1:25:58] that's what we're looking at I'm looking
[1:26:01] at this promise I'm looking now listen
[1:26:05] I'm not in any way trying to say I'm a
[1:26:07] Joshua I'm just simply saying I'm not
[1:26:10] Caleb that stands with Joshua a man that
[1:26:14] looks and say give me my Mountain now
[1:26:18] we're more than able to take the land
[1:26:20] then we steal the unbelief of the people
[1:26:23] and say it's still possible Laodicea
[1:26:27] isn't too great lukewarmness isn't too
[1:26:30] powerful to stop the Word of God from
[1:26:37] being fulfilled in this hour
[1:26:39] Bobby's gonna believe it
[1:26:45] Jesus is still the same
[1:26:48] now look everywhere Jesus went he
[1:26:52] conquered now wait a minute I'm gonna
[1:26:54] start right here now just a minute
[1:26:56] because that's your Commission
[1:26:57] everywhere the soul of your feet shall
[1:27:00] tread upon I've given that to you
[1:27:02] hey man everywhere he went he conquered
[1:27:05] everywhere you go your to conquer the
[1:27:09] Bible said to him that overcometh and he
[1:27:12] spoke it to the last stage didn't he
[1:27:14] so somebody's gonna be a conqueror in
[1:27:16] the last stage are you with me man so he
[1:27:21] conquered everything that could be
[1:27:23] conquered when he was on the earth he
[1:27:25] conquered passion so will you pride so
[1:27:30] will you
[1:27:31] he conquered sickness so will you a man
[1:27:34] he conquered Devils so will you a man
[1:27:38] even when he died he conquered death and
[1:27:41] if you go into death you will rise and
[1:27:44] triumph over death - there will not be
[1:27:46] one of the Saints left behind hey man
[1:27:51] notice now as we go on he when he when
[1:27:54] he arose he conquered hell and so are
[1:27:59] you you say what brother Tim hell is all
[1:28:03] around us and I agree every kind of
[1:28:06] spirit has been released into this age
[1:28:08] in this hour in this time but you will
[1:28:11] conquer hell you have been ordained to
[1:28:15] conquer the evil that is around you you
[1:28:17] have not been called to defeat you have
[1:28:20] been called up to walk in victory when
[1:28:27] he rose he conquered hell he went up and
[1:28:29] conquered everything that was against
[1:28:32] mankind and when of the red wine press
[1:28:34] of God and crushed it down and conquered
[1:28:37] death hell in the grave sickness and
[1:28:39] formalities and everything else and
[1:28:42] overcome it all and rose on the third
[1:28:44] day and conquered all the atmospheres
[1:28:47] above and cut that mist that was between
[1:28:52] God and man
[1:28:54] oh and connected I want you to get this
[1:28:57] word connected heaven and earth together
[1:28:59] oh man glory amen
[1:29:04] there he stands a mighty Conqueror since
[1:29:07] she ripped the veil in - there he is he
[1:29:11] has the keys of death and hell hanging
[1:29:14] on his side he says fear not he laid his
[1:29:16] right hand or his power of all men raise
[1:29:19] him up but the power of is right here
[1:29:21] and so said don't fear I am he that was
[1:29:24] and that is and that shall come I am the
[1:29:28] first and the last and he that lived and
[1:29:31] died and is alive forevermore
[1:29:34] hey man how many of you today can say
[1:29:37] hey man hey man the summons we say hello
[1:29:41] behold the mighty conquer remember all
[1:29:45] the end blame you
[1:29:46] I believe that's what God did for us
[1:29:49] today to see the antecessor
[1:30:02] hey man the atonement behold him in
[1:30:05] plain view there he stands the mighty
[1:30:08] conquer since he read the veil in - no I
[1:30:14] just want to tell you he came to connect
[1:30:19] heaven and not together this is what
[1:30:23] happened even at the River Jordan when
[1:30:25] the great dumb of God came upon the Lamb
[1:30:28] of God and abode with him it was
[1:30:31] connecting man and heaven together again
[1:30:36] somebody with me that through him we can
[1:30:40] become connected I'm talking about
[1:30:42] connected because it's going to take
[1:30:45] your faith connected to an omnipotent
[1:30:47] God and then from dividends to work
[1:30:52] and we're in our where there must be I'm
[1:30:55] limited so this thing in fact every one
[1:30:58] of you that are born again or a display
[1:31:01] of omnipotence Amen what actually
[1:31:04] happened was to omnipotence met there
[1:31:07] was a potential in the seed gene of God
[1:31:10] that was resident in you by
[1:31:12] predestination hallelujah and then by
[1:31:16] the connection of the Holy Ghost coming
[1:31:19] to you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:21] you didn't have the seed in yet there's
[1:31:24] nothing in you to respond a man you just
[1:31:27] become a false anointed one at the end
[1:31:29] time but if there's a seed in you you
[1:31:32] became connected with God with heaven
[1:31:36] the moment you were born again
[1:31:41] hallelujah every every egg of a woman is
[1:31:44] dead unless is connected with the life
[1:31:47] of the male and the Turks is dead if
[1:31:50] it's not connected with the life of God
[1:31:53] you remain dead as a person unless you
[1:31:57] get connected but when you're connected
[1:32:02] there's omnipotence power to conquer sin
[1:32:06] I believe the devil
[1:32:09] unclean spirits the power God and the
[1:32:13] deliverance so every man or woman filled
[1:32:18] with the Holy Spirit is connected with
[1:32:20] God because of a new birth and that
[1:32:24] gives a connection with God as he
[1:32:26] resides within the soul now again this
[1:32:33] brings us right down to the use of the
[1:32:37] word Zoe life we liked the name name our
[1:32:40] kids Owen and you know sometimes going
[1:32:44] about without meaning but Jesus said I
[1:32:46] give them eternal life which is Zoe life
[1:32:50] and that Zoe that word eternal comes
[1:32:53] from that word Zoe which means the life
[1:32:56] of God a man here those that receive me
[1:33:00] I give them
[1:33:01] life all that artists that is all - sent
[1:33:07] shockwaves through you today hey man he
[1:33:11] puts his life in you abides his life and
[1:33:17] his life is an imminent life his life
[1:33:22] knows no limits there is no hindrance to
[1:33:26] it come on it is all-powerful
[1:33:30] hey man it'll blow everything out of the
[1:33:32] way notice now when we have God's life
[1:33:37] in us it makes us believe like God does
[1:33:42] hallelujah let me say to you when you
[1:33:45] have God's life in us it makes us
[1:33:47] believe like God does that whatsoever
[1:33:51] His Word says in the materialize a man
[1:33:56] for it says by His stripes were healed
[1:33:57] and for you a believer that settles it
[1:34:01] amen God said son wouldn't so when a man
[1:34:04] is born of the Spirit of God he's a son
[1:34:08] of God and then he believes for things
[1:34:10] that are impossible he still believes it
[1:34:15] why because his God is in him shall I
[1:34:18] say it again here's God he is in him by
[1:34:22] the Holy Spirit
[1:34:23] and he believes hey man now if you
[1:34:28] hadn't got the Holy Spirit in there you
[1:34:29] hadn't Hallett don't have anything for
[1:34:31] his mind - one to rest the bones it'll
[1:34:33] just wander here and there in doubt and
[1:34:35] unbelief he doesn't know them can't
[1:34:39] comprehend the things of God because if
[1:34:41] my natural man cannot understand the
[1:34:44] things of God they're just foolish to
[1:34:46] him but now he said then he then he
[1:34:51] talks about the Pentecostal and the poor
[1:34:55] and the Full Gospel and he said one of
[1:34:58] the things the greatest things were the
[1:35:00] greatest hindrance among us is it you're
[1:35:04] trying to place the great things of God
[1:35:06] yet to come when you're right in the
[1:35:09] middle of it now
[1:35:12] and this is always what it being you
[1:35:15] know one day one day the bride will have
[1:35:19] her power one day she's going to come
[1:35:22] into omnipotence one day one day and I'm
[1:35:29] telling you that your prophet of God

[1:35:55] drugs this is the day where those that
[1:35:59] are bent down and crippled in their
[1:36:01] spirit because of pornography this day
[1:36:04] they can have power over yesterday you
[1:36:10] can walk in freedom this day not another

[1:36:27] said today is the day of salvation this
[1:36:30] is the day then of deliverance today
[1:36:37] today you can shake off your lukewarm
[1:36:39] spirit today you can get rid of your
[1:36:44] unbelief it's an unclean spirit unbelief
[1:36:48] can I say it again it's an unclean
[1:36:51] spirit today you can get rid of the
[1:36:53] unclean spirit well you know people say
[1:37:01] well just wait in the Millennium to come
[1:37:03] well what would these things be in the
[1:37:06] Millennium when we don't need healings

[1:43:10] rapture and we know we've lived the time
[1:43:12] out and at the time of the rapture is at
[1:43:17] hand and we're looking for rapture and
[1:43:19] faith that a pull the church together
[1:43:22] and give it some supernatural strength
[1:43:24] that will change these bodies that we
[1:43:27] live in a man we swim we see a God that
[1:43:31] can raise the dead off the floor or out
[1:43:34] of the yard and bring him back to life

[1:45:26] laid dormant but as powerful begins to
[1:45:31] push the life that's in the seed that
[1:45:34] has laid dormant for years begins to
[1:45:38] push out against the soil against the
[1:45:41] thing that buried it and held it down
[1:45:44] are you with me and I say you've been
[1:45:47] held down long enough you've been bound
[1:45:49] down

[1:45:53] man there's a light on the inside of you
[1:45:55] omnipotence it's beginning to respond to
[1:45:59] the Annapolis of the season as the cycle
[1:46:02] changes and that Sun begins to shine
[1:46:05] upon the seasons

[1:46:34] give us rapture and faith the man that
[1:46:38] just something just kind of exists our
[1:46:41] faith up for a little bit and drops back
[1:46:42] down remember we one miracle ought to
[1:46:47] prepare us for another miracle a mammal
[1:46:53] one thing God does preparedness for
[1:46:55] another greater thing hey mom
[1:46:57] ma this is what it ought to be you said
[1:47:01] well but my faith is small this small is
[1:47:04] a tiny grain of mustard seed that's
[1:47:08] enough to move a mountain but it's got
[1:47:11] to be put to work somebody hear me he's
[1:47:17] a high priests working on what not on
[1:47:20] your crying

[1:47:28] no matter how much faith you got it will
[1:47:30] never do you any good gee but works with
[1:47:32] it cause faith without works is dead
[1:47:36] hey man there's a potential laying in
[1:47:40] the seed and it can be there for years
[1:47:42] and years and years and lay in there
[1:47:44] until the atmosphere gets right but
[1:47:47] until there's wax
[1:47:49] come on that comes with the potential of
[1:47:51] the seed and it'll just lay there for
[1:47:54] years and years
[1:47:55] we got years and years we're out of time
[1:48:00] hey man we're right down here they're

[1:48:06] last Messenger has come to the church
[1:48:09] come on the last prophet has come to the
[1:48:13] church I realize according to revelation
[1:48:16] 10 eight the bride prophesize seemed
[1:48:18] that must prophesy again but it's simply
[1:48:21] saying a bride under a messenger becomes
[1:48:24] the final boys to the final eight it's
[1:48:26] not another message it's the same
[1:48:30] message that same passing being preached
[1:48:33] again you haven't ever tried other
[1:48:37] people demonstrating Jesus Christ the
[1:48:40] same yesterday today and forever hey man
[1:48:46] where people looking for a resurrection
[1:48:50] of all the dead of the seven ages
[1:48:53] if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:48:58] we have one already waiting a celestial
[1:49:02] body and with that spirit and that soul
[1:49:06] is celestial body you'll raise up into
[1:49:10] this again this natural body for the
[1:49:12] great millennium and you have the power
[1:49:16] in you now to do that so we're going to
[1:49:22] where in the world you get scripture for
[1:49:24] that if the spirit that raised up Jesus
[1:49:29] from the dead dwell in you it shall also
[1:49:33] what make a lab quicken your mortal body
[1:49:39] hallelujah so therefore it's already
[1:49:42] laying in you resurrection power is
[1:49:45] already laying in yet that's what raised
[1:49:48] you up from the things of the world it's
[1:49:51] the same thing that will quicken your
[1:49:52] mortal body hey man it ain't something
[1:49:56] that's coming it's something already
[1:49:57] here it's something resident on the
[1:50:00] inside of you but if that power that you
[1:50:03] have in you now but that power that you
[1:50:06] have in you now could make a new world
[1:50:09] now these are some astounding things
[1:50:13] you can go back to all Roberts you can
[1:50:16] go to a a Alain they never spoke words
[1:50:20] like these they didn't have a message
[1:50:24] this is not just a sign there was a
[1:50:27] voice with the side there was a message
[1:50:31] from God you know with the sign notice
[1:50:35] now you but but that power that you have
[1:50:38] in you could they make a new world now
[1:50:42] listen God doesn't have little weak
[1:50:45] spots and big heavy spots is powerful

[1:54:51] happening Devils are getting defeated
[1:54:54] the element goes on the Ragnar because
[1:54:58] of nipple and begins to speak but in
[1:55:02] order for am nipa to speak there had to
[1:55:04] become a people speaking with an impetus
[1:55:11] if you're sick you're not a Christian
[1:55:15] become a Christian right now so that
[1:55:20] healing power can come in you by being a
[1:55:22] Christian and that'll give you a fait -

[1:55:36] have faith in God
[1:55:37] that pushes out good things for you
[1:55:40] which is you by the Holy Spirit
[1:55:43] do you understand clearly now like to
[1:55:47] bring out just a couple of more
[1:55:49] quotations on this now if we're born
[1:55:53] again of the Spirit of God God don't
[1:55:57] have little weak parts and big strong
[1:56:01] parts did you hang up on me no at least
[1:56:11] touch of God is omnipotent he's all
[1:56:15] together God amen the Holy Spirit that
[1:56:20] is in you is the Spirit of Jesus and is
[1:56:24] no weaker in you than it was in Jesus
[1:56:28] it's just as powerful in you as it was
[1:56:32] in Jesus a man of Christ not being you
[1:56:37] you are none of his but if you're here
[1:56:40] then his power is resident within you
[1:56:43] all right
[1:56:44] so God don't have little weak parts and
[1:56:47] big strong part he's all together God
[1:56:50] and you've had enough God in you till
[1:56:54] it's just a barely a
[1:56:56] shadow that's enough power to make a new
[1:56:59] earth that's enough power to make a new
[1:57:03] moon and a new system it's God and it's
[1:57:07] strong and right now I never believe in
[1:57:11] here that has eternal life which is
[1:57:13] God's Spirit in you is enough power that
[1:57:16] a raise up the dead that is healed the
[1:57:20] sick that sets orbits in conditions high
[1:57:26] now listen but it's controlled by love
[1:57:32] that spirit that is in you the Bible
[1:57:35] calls it the law of the spirit of life
[1:57:38] so we it's not that we just go out and
[1:57:41] begin to do things in our own will well
[1:57:44] I've got this power I'll go do it but it
[1:57:46] is that we find that will of God hey man
[1:57:50] now notice again I wonder why he brought
[1:57:53] the illustrates enough this is what a
[1:57:55] seed can do amen this is what that that
[1:58:02] life of God can do in you that's over
[1:58:08] any hindrance any Rock a man that can I
[1:58:14] tell it to you you are unstoppable
[1:58:17] you are entertaining
[1:58:21] hallelujah the mountains has to be moved
[1:58:24] because of nebadon start speaking in
[1:58:28] accordance with the word and I'd see the
[1:58:31] life in you begins to push out and as it
[1:58:36] pushes out it begins to crack the rocks
[1:58:38] around you begins to move the mountains
[1:58:41] and the boulders and the things and the
[1:58:44] heavy loads that has held you back and
[1:58:46] I'm telling you there's nothing that can
[1:58:49] hold you back as a seat of God and if
[1:58:55] God has given you I promise of God hear
[1:58:58] my words now and let me prophesy if God
[1:59:01] has given you a promise of God a man
[1:59:04] there is nothing can keep that promise
[1:59:06] from happening a man just put your faith
[1:59:10] in a nipper that God and omnipotence
[1:59:12] starts moving and Crocs begin cracking
[1:59:16] open and Mountain starts moving if it's
[1:59:18] one grain at a site at a time it starts
[1:59:21] moving but it's gonna move and tell it
[1:59:24] moves till it's gone completely hey man
[1:59:29] if you had enough of God in here till
[1:59:33] it's just barely a shadow there's no
[1:59:36] power now in every believer here's
[1:59:40] eternal life God's Spirit in you enough
[1:59:44] power that a raised up today that he
[1:59:46] healed the sick they sent their orbits
[1:59:49] and conditions but it's controlled by
[1:59:52] law and that's the spirit within you
[1:59:57] your sons and daughters of God the same
[2:00:00] spirit that you got in you will raise
[2:00:02] you up at the day of the resurrection
[2:00:04] Jesus when he was here on earth when he
[2:00:07] died his soul descended to hell and he
[2:00:10] preached to the spirits that were in
[2:00:12] prison a man and then that repented not
[2:00:16] in the long-suffering of the days of
[2:00:17] Noah this is true this is found in the
[2:00:19] book of Peter he said so his body went
[2:00:22] into the grave but when he died he
[2:00:24] commended his spirit unto the hands of
[2:00:26] God and his spirit went to God his soul
[2:00:28] went to hell his body with the grain and
[2:00:31] Jesus what's now was barred out barred
[2:00:37] out from the resurrection until the
[2:00:40] scripture could be fulfilled notice he
[2:00:46] could not come back because he had to
[2:00:49] stay in the grave for three days and
[2:00:52] nights but when the scripture was all
[2:00:55] fulfilled this bar was taken away and
[2:00:59] his spirit descended his soul and his
[2:01:02] Souls his body and he rose again all
[2:01:07] right now hold it it's a principle that
[2:01:09] goes with the power was in Jesus but he
[2:01:13] couldn't raise on the first day he could
[2:01:17] raise on the second day he had the
[2:01:20] raised on the third day come on because
[2:01:23] there was a word that barred him from
[2:01:28] resurrection power it laid within him
[2:01:31] but it could not work until it moved in
[2:01:35] the right position are you with me now
[2:01:40] that's why in the Millenium I had the
[2:01:44] bars that are placed by the word that
[2:01:46] banned us from Eden's power will be
[2:01:48] totally lifted from and our full
[2:01:51] potentials as sons of God will be
[2:01:53] manifested in that day in the millennium
[2:01:56] ahead we will not use an axe to move a
[2:01:59] tree there we will speak and it'll be
[2:02:02] done a man we will work but not by the
[2:02:06] sweat of our brow somebody with me Amen
[2:02:10] we will be exercising our full potential
[2:02:13] but right now we're still held back from
[2:02:18] fulfilling all of that until the
[2:02:21] appropriate hour are you with me now why
[2:02:26] is it that some still die even though we
[2:02:30] pray and believe you know I was with I
[2:02:37] was with brother Jerry show and I can
[2:02:40] take you back a decade ago when he was
[2:02:45] down with this condition within his
[2:02:47] lungs where he couldn't breathe and was
[2:02:53] having to have oxygen and dare one holy
[2:02:56] or one day the Holy Spirit moved on me
[2:02:58] as I walked past him he was still
[2:03:00] serving as a deacon and I walked past
[2:03:03] this man gasping for every breath
[2:03:06] sometimes fighting sleeping the service
[2:03:09] because he's not getting enough oxygen
[2:03:11] but still faithful to come to church I
[2:03:14] wonder what kind of testimony you're
[2:03:16] gonna face on a day like that and here
[2:03:20] he would come service after service and
[2:03:22] his pain and gasping for breath are you
[2:03:26] with me one service of walk past him at
[2:03:29] the end of his service the Holy Spirit
[2:03:31] just moving and in the audience and as I
[2:03:34] walked down this was in the old church
[2:03:36] who walked down past him walked down the
[2:03:39] steps and as I walk by I saw him there
[2:03:43] and I laid my hands on him and I rebuked
[2:03:45] that affliction and for three years he
[2:03:51] went without needing additional oxygen
[2:03:54] you know why God's a healer
[2:03:58] God said deliver a man but here he comes
[2:04:03] out now age comes own time comes own and
[2:04:06] the time of his departure is at hand
[2:04:09] say it how you want to God wants some of
[2:04:12] us to be alive and remain for the
[2:04:14] rapture and some will put in the grave
[2:04:17] but don't worry about those in the grave
[2:04:19] they'll rise first
[2:04:21] hey man hey man then brother Jerry dare
[2:04:25] who would go on go back on oxygen and
[2:04:28] now labour try he you know he'd me thank
[2:04:32] God for healing me and there would be
[2:04:34] little healings you remember when he
[2:04:37] laid there there in the hospital
[2:04:39] completely died and God raised him back
[2:04:42] up again and the doctor would call him
[2:04:45] Lazarus friend they would put him on
[2:04:47] Hospice then he would defy all odds in
[2:04:51] the years a year or more later it would
[2:04:54] be before he would die
[2:04:55] but he still would have to go by the way
[2:04:58] of the grave it was God's law and then
[2:05:02] no matter how we prayed how much we
[2:05:05] believed how we believed just like we
[2:05:07] did the first time
[2:05:09] you know it wasn't we wasn't believing
[2:05:12] we were still believing but he was fired
[2:05:15] out from that promise because he was
[2:05:18] accounted to be among those who would go
[2:05:21] and sleep and he has a dream of his self
[2:05:24] and he said I saw myself a young man
[2:05:27] running down the path there let breathe
[2:05:31] deep
[2:05:32] I can breathe I could run and just a few
[2:05:35] days later he got that shilling and
[2:05:38] crossed the dementia and today jeri-show
[2:05:41] is a well man sister Rachel just saw him
[2:05:52] the other day sit down on her bed right
[2:05:54] there and say and she reached over and
[2:05:57] grabbed him by the shoulder and felt of
[2:05:59] him and said Jerry you're real you
[2:06:01] really said yes I just want you to know
[2:06:03] I always hear you when you call my name
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:07] you think the dad you think the dad came
[2:06:10] here the Bible says they do man you
[2:06:15] think they can't see in this dementia
[2:06:17] the Bible says they do look at the souls
[2:06:20] on the altar they're not dead they're
[2:06:23] alive Jerry is more alive now that what
[2:06:27] he ever was but he was barred out from
[2:06:29] healing here on earth to get a greater
[2:06:32] healing there somebody with me but it
[2:06:38] didn't keep up nipa tons from working
[2:06:41] cuz one breath beyond this old feeble
[2:06:44] body was a new celestial body that
[2:06:51] doesn't have problems breathing
[2:06:56] hallelujah glory to God
[2:06:59] so what is it that some still die yet
[2:07:05] though we pray and believe
[2:07:08] and he says yet nothing shall be
[2:07:11] impossible to you it's because it's some
[2:07:15] yes yet must fulfill the word that was
[2:07:18] given because of our original sin man's
[2:07:22] original sin the day you eat thereof
[2:07:25] that day you die and some must fulfill
[2:07:28] that but one day
[2:07:32] may it be today one day the last one the
[2:07:43] last one will go what we call by the way
[2:07:47] of the grave the last one will die you
[2:07:54] say brother Tim you're way out on a limb
[2:07:56] let me just go back for a moment in the
[2:07:58] Jewish dispensation the last one to come
[2:08:02] in was the thief on the cross the last
[2:08:08] one finally King Abraham died Jacob died

[2:08:17] one Oh hallelujah

[2:09:00] announcement to the restaurant he's
[2:09:02] coming and he makes a little pit stop
[2:09:05] down in the regions of the loss read
[2:09:08] your Bible he takes the keys of hell
[2:09:10] away from Satan
[2:09:12] what the devil don't have a key to his
[2:09:15] own house
[2:09:19] tanka he preaches a doe spirit that were
[2:09:22] there that would repeal in the days of
[2:09:24] Noah the Bible said so while he was in
[2:09:28] the grave he was not dead he was living
[2:09:32] he was acting he was talking he was
[2:09:35] preaching and he comes to the Saints and
[2:09:42] say today's the day little children my
[2:09:45] blood is wet on the cross and your debt
[2:09:51] is paid for in full and today the last
[2:09:55] one has come in now it's going up time
[2:10:00] and the Bible said to remember this
[2:10:05] Matthew 27 the Bible said that many that
[2:10:09] were in the grave awoke the Saints who
[2:10:11] were in the grave awoke and appeared to
[2:10:13] many there was a resurrection so I'm not
[2:10:17] way off him huh hey man if there was a
[2:10:21] resurrection for that dispensation would
[2:10:24] there be a resurrection for this
[2:10:25] dispensation and we're here when one day

[2:10:34] member of the body will breathe their
[2:10:37] last breath this man this thief on the
[2:10:41] cross would go there in the grave only
[2:10:44] to rise in a couple of days hey man

[2:11:30] and potential or shall I say omnipotence

[2:11:50] living what a day that will be we will
[2:11:54] not all sleep but we shall all be
[2:11:58] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an

[2:12:19] because death and hardly with me the
[2:12:23] death an old age and all the remnants of
[2:12:27] sin will be barred out of going there

[2:13:51] God who spoke things out of nothingness
[2:13:55] and brought into existence we're looking

[2:15:08] holding the bag believing and nothing
[2:15:12] happens but there's a people in this day
[2:15:17] that will believe in impossible that
[2:15:21] realize nothing is impossible for this
[2:15:24] bride that's called in this last day and
[2:15:26] I'm part of that
[2:15:29] God would show us the power time on time
[2:15:32] again that power would go out hundreds
[2:15:37] of miles away and by the word just take
[2:15:39] a tumor out speak to storms because your
[2:15:46] God above omnipotence and you reign you
[2:15:51] reign over ever power over every
[2:15:53] situation your life you're not dead this
[2:16:01] is more than about just having a full of

[2:17:54] knowing there's no one in ever in the
[2:17:56] Bible that was baptized to any other way
[2:17:59] than in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:18:02] it's for the remission of sins so we can

[2:18:20] play it one more time let's just worship
[2:18:22] the Lord today
[2:18:26] [Music]
[2:18:31] see my brain has not yet reached a point
[2:18:34] where to form a thought that could
[2:18:36] adequately describe the greatness of my
[2:18:39] god
[2:18:41] and my lungs have not yet developed the
[2:18:43] ability to release a breath of an
[2:18:46] opportunity to breathe out the greatness
[2:18:48] of his love and my boys you see my voice
[2:18:52] is so inhibited restrained by human
[2:18:55] limits that it's hard to even send the
[2:18:57] praise up you see if there are words for
[2:18:59] him then I don't have them my god His
[2:19:04] grace is remarkable mercies are
[2:19:07] innumerable strength is impenetrable
[2:19:09] he is honorable accountable favorable
[2:19:12] he's unsearchable yet knowable
[2:19:15] indefinable yet approachable
[2:19:18] indescribable yet personal he is beyond
[2:19:21] comprehension further than imagination
[2:19:24] constitute generations king of every
[2:19:27] nation but if their words for him then I
[2:19:30] don't have them you see my words are few
[2:19:33] and the trying caps are the one true God
[2:19:36] usually my vocabulary would never do but
[2:19:39] I use words as an expression an
[2:19:42] expression of worship to a savior a
[2:19:44] savior was both worthy and deserving of
[2:19:47] my praise so I use word
[2:19:49] [Music]
[2:19:53] my heart its tolls the Lord blesses his
[2:19:56] name forever he has won my heart
[2:19:58] captured my - bound them both together
[2:20:01] he has defeated me in my rebellion
[2:20:04] conquered me in my sin he has welcomed
[2:20:07] me into his presence completely invited
[2:20:10] me in he has made himself the object of
[2:20:12] my sight
[2:20:13] flooded me with mercies in the morning
[2:20:15] trying to me with grace in the night but
[2:20:18] if there was for him
[2:20:21] but what I do have is good news for my
[2:20:25] god knew that man-made words would never
[2:20:27] do for words of the tools that we use
[2:20:30] the point to the truth so he sent His
[2:20:33] Son Jesus Christ as he were living
[2:20:35] through his image of the invisible God
[2:20:38] the firstborn of creation for by him all
[2:20:42] things were created giving nothingness
[2:20:45] formation
[2:20:51] and overall things
