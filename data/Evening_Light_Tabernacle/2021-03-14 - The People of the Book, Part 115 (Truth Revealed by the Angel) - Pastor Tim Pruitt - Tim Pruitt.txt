he brought deliverance to you when we mentioned that name that's the same as israel did when they were bitten by the snake and they looked at the brass serpent they looked upon that on that serpent and they were healed why it represented their sins that old serpent judged you say how did jesus represent a serpent or that serpent represent him because he became your sin that you might become his righteousness amen and when we when we call on the name of jesus we are calling in everything he did at calvary all the healing virtues that flowed from that cross ever saw the saving power that flew came from his veins there's power in that name of jesus we're seeing singing the jailhouse down well i tell you what i believe that's what believers can do they just got a song a victory within their

lingo strong and is here today and he's gonna be buried in the name of jesus christ we're going to replica it's a representation of a death a barrel and a resurrection amen of death to the old man amen burial of that old man and a resurrection to a new life amen i believe god's got that for you this morning for all of us it's whosoever will let him come and drink of the water of life freely amen we've been hearing some wonderful reports coming back from the youth camp and god's transforming lives pouring out his spirit as i told you this is a time where he don't just pour out a little bit he poured out a little with lutheran a little with wesley but in this day he just empties it all out until the people become the fullness of the godhead in a body called the bride hallelujah what

present among us who is the one that brought us this truth who is this one that's so concerned about his people that he would scream out today and say get back in step there will be those that this message will go to and it'll be a scream it'll be a scream that says get back in line get back in step i pray god that you'll move in a great way throughout this nation and the world today and in this service and in the youth campus they conclude every need now supply of your children bring healing to the sick as we heard it this morning there's power in the name if you're sick while the word goes forth it can be healed i pray lord as we enter into the ministry now some of it will be teaching some of it will be preaching but lord it'll be all the word of god i pray father that you'll give clarity and understanding and open up the eyes of our understanding that we might know the hope of our calling may they see lord it's not about some big ones or big preachers or big this ones or big churches or it's about you lord there's only one pig among us that's you may you be exalted in your name glorified in jesus name we love you lord amen amen god bless you amen isn't it good to be today in the house of the lord amen amen we want to welcome that adams family back after a real bout with the and sickness and uh their extended family too sister marie middleton all of them that the lord has been with them and brought them through all of this and we thanked him for it i meant brother tim winter singing you know he had the covet and it affected his his lungs and his the power well you see the healing power of god amen there's power in the name of jesus amen just walk in your victory and walk in your liberty today amen exodus chapter 3 and verse 1 is where we'll read from this morning exodus chapter 3 and verse 1. now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priesthood midian and he led the flop to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb now this horror would be the same as mount sinai it would be where the law would be given it would be where god would say i'll bring you back to this mountain and no matter what what happened he knew that he would bring the children of israel back to this place this would be a place where they would be covenant with god and as the jews say this where that god married israel and united with the old testament bride by giving them his word now this is really uh important to understand because we are also in another exodus we are also in another pentecost remember this would take place where we're where they would come back to this mountain 50 weeks after the passover 50 days after the passover which would be seven weeks and seven weeks later they would reach this place again where that moses met the pillar of fire and we have come now through seven church ages from the passover from calvary where jesus gave his life at the cross and the token was given all the way now to and we have the churches journeyed now for seven different church ages and now we come to the fulfillment of all the types of the scripture and so when the scripture says when the day of pentecost was fully come it was speaking about from from the time where calvary where jesus died to seven weeks later which these were the the the this the seven weeks of of um of unleavened bread and and feast days and then it would come now to the day of pentecost so it would be fully come the the weeks fulfilled and remember they were all typing now we have come from that passover for seven church ages and so this is a day where that the day of pentecost has fully come and this is the day where he pours out his spirit in the great finality of all that he's done of all the works that he's done from all the way from genesis and the creation right now up to this time and it all comes in it heads up right here in this day and this hour for fulfillment i say this is a wonderful day to be living in it's the greatest hour of all mankind to be standing right on the cusp the break the edge of the rapture itself amen where god consummates the whole thing and takes the people to a new home amen are you ready for your new home i'm ready for my new home amen i'm ready for a new body that's right amen and i don't care if you're 18 years old you you should be ready for a new body amen because this one is one where there is trouble in sin and sickness and disease amen but that one is a glorified body amen and whether to never any of that inner now verse 2 says and the angel of the lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed so here we see a light it is mailing it is it is it's flaming like a fire it looks like a fire it's a light and it has the appearance of a of an amber a yellowish green color and it's it's pulsating in this bush and and he sees it's not a natural fire because it's not consuming the bush and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight and why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw he turned aside god called unto him out of the midst of the bush notice if you go back to verse two go back to verse two and the angel lord appeared to him in a flame of fire then you come into here in verse four and god called him out of the midst of the bush so it was the angel of god yet it was god himself because it was the angel or the messenger of his covenant it was god in theophanic form and he would veil himself now in a pillar of fire now look at this and and he says and and then he called and said moses moses he said here am i and he said in verse 5 and he said draw not and i hit her put off thy shoes from off that feet for the place where on thy stand at this holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god then i would like you to turn with me to exodus chapter 23 and we will read from verse 20 exodus 23 and verse 20. behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared beware of him and obey his voice and provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him if thou will indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary into thine adversary for mine angels shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites the hittites of perizzites the canaanites the highlights and the jebusites and i will cut them off amen as well as any website that's against this message amen god bless you can be seated we're going to be speak on speaking today on truth revealed by the angel truth as revealed by the angel now as i went over last sunday and and you know i hope you don't mind me just kind of um taking a little bit of time here just to kind of bring us back into our thoughts we've had wonderful meetings and great times we had brother joe adams minister and wednesday night that bless us so much and you know many other things that as the week has went by and things that you've listened to or heard or read or [Music] communicated with others or whatever but i wanted to kind of bring our thoughts back now to the word today is i'm going to do a little bit of mixing maybe a preach teach today and and um kind of bring in some things to because i i think it's really important that you know who it is that is among us and i'm identifying the angel of his presence that was here in our generation and this continues to be here even unto this day because he is the i am god that was which is and shall come the almighty now what sets us apart as i've told you uh it sets us apart from this the rest of the denominations in the christian world today is that this message is not heralded from a denominational headquarters but it is a message that descended from the heavenly dimensions beyond as an angel stepped out of the light much like he did in the um first exodus this light was a whirling fire it mealed around churning within um within and hanging first in the air and pulsating with an energy growing bigger and brighter as it as it grew there the light spread in the window or not from the window but in in the place where brother branham was and spread out on the floor getting larger and larger spreading out across the floor now you know it would be sometimes later i think it was when with brother branham and seemed like the place was in vidalia um illinois where brother billy paul was awakened one night with brother branham and and he had asked him if he could see the angel of the lord said it would help billy to understand he helps me in the ministry can i wake him and he gave permission to it and he saw him standing there a man about six foot tall and uh olive complexion and he had dark hair about to the shoulder and and then he had um as he was there he he was he saw the the light around him and he said he was really scared and and and uh frightened by this light and said oh daddy don't let him get me and he said oh he'll not hurt you son he said this is the angel of god that talks to me and he said in a few moments the light gathered around him and around his feet and he stepped right into that and he said he changed back to that light and he went right out the window now this would come of course in almost every service that brother branham would preach if he would mention seeing the angel of the lord and let me just say if he didn't see him he was present and so in this occasion when he first came he would see this light come in a place where he was praying and he heard footsteps and and squinting at the light you see a barefoot um and then a white robe and then out of that you know would light would walk a man well it was like a man yet it was a supernatural being that walked out of a light that had entered the room and as it described you know a six foot tall about 200 pounds massive arms which fo were were folded in front of him and his dark hairs fell around his shoulders and he appeared to be about the age of 30 beardless face um and um a dark olive complexion his eyes were dark and piercing and and it was this angelic visitation from god that revealed the word now i want you to understand this is what has happened all down through the bible this is the bible way of the word being revealed to the prophets and apostles and that's what gave us the bible and then genesis 22 tells of the story of isaac being offered as a sacrifice and it was there the angel lord appears to abraham and refers to himself as god in the first person it would be exodus 3 that we read from where the angel lord was in this burning bush and identifies himself as the i am that i am it would be in exodus 14 and 19 that the angel of god led the children of israel and then would also follow behind them with the pillar of fire and this pillar of fire was a theophanic present that led the children of israel to their promised land and this too is a prophecy as we've already spoke about of the bride of christ who's led by a pillar of fire all the way to the rapture i want you to get it to you he has not left us and man he didn't go away when the prophet of god left amen but he is still here with us he is here except he you know he is in his bright body the church of jesus christ now the pillar of fire provided light so the israelites could travel by night during their exodus from egypt and the bible connects a pillar of fire with the manifestation of the divine presence uh by day as a pillar of a cloud notice a cloud by day of fire by night so it could manifest itself as a cloud or could manifest itself as a light or could manifest itself as a man and all of these were theophenic presence and of course this this made it so that the children of israel could travel by night or by day and during israel's travel in the desert they traveling to the promised land uh jehovah continually would use this pillar of fire and cloud to lead his people they were a people directly led by the pillar of fire and when the pillar of fire would move forward the people of israel would pack up their tents and they would see it moving and they know it's time to move amen when you see it moving it's time to move and they would pack up camp and they would follow behind it and similarly when the pillar of fire was present stopped the israelite would set up a camp underneath it and the levites would set up the tabernacle of the lord directly under the pillar of fire or the cloud of the lord and this way that god's presence was was visibly in the center of the camp at all times amen he must stay at the center of the church this is where that by the preaching of the word every true levite or ever true preacher of the gospel must center the church directly under the pillar of fire amen because he is the one that is leading him it has to be directly under the word of god and so it would be from this pillar of fire that god's theophanic presence um where the word of god would come in the form of commandments upon mount sinai and would be given to moses now this was this is how the word the lord would come to the prophets this would be where that moses then would write the first five books of the old testaments and actually transferred the thoughts of god from god's thoughts to paper i i'm talking about we we have an amazing book called the bible amen because it it records the words that were uttered by almighty god and the thought in the plan of redemption i hope that you love your bible and you read your bible that it becomes a very well-worn book i mean it's very important you say well i tell you brother jim i'm just rejoicing and i'm just shouting over what god has done but you better pray and read your bible stay anchored in god's word are you with me because that's the way you get close to god it'll give you it'll make you ready for the next experience with god you've seen there's other things about god that you can come to know that nobody has a right to remain in the same condition amen there's no excuse to be backslidden and if you're not going forward you're going backwards exactly right but as i say you know again here the commandments would be given to israel and he would get them from the pillar of fire i could see him almost as his finger of fire would go and write it in tables of stone and and of course what he wants to do now is take his finger of the pillar of fire and write his word in your very nature in your very heart and that's what our prayer is this morning it it'll be more than a sermon but it'll be an experience with the pillar of fire where he takes his fiery finger and writes in your nature to you and the word become one amen now these these words that were formed they were as we speak right now if you notice and yeah whether it's like brother joe said the other night you i'm not stupid but you know here's a definition of story well you know you're not stupid either but i but the words that come out of your mouth is your breath they come out by your breath is that right you breathe through your vocal cords and you express them with your tongue and form words so your words are your breath that is breathed out and you're speaking words as you do and so the bible said in second timothy 3 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of god now this this literally means all scripture is god breathe god uttered with his words with his breath and it is so it's god's breathe you cannot utter words without there being life in you and that life is is causing something to well up in you and come out the thoughts that's within your human spirit well god's spirit does the same thing that is that his life causes words to come out from his very mind and they become thoughts and then they become expressed to a prophet are you with me now so all scripture is breathed by god or or you know words are formed as i said uttered by your breath so god literally breathes out the scripture in other words god has transmitted his very substance into every scripture amen that's why it's it's a book that never goes old it's a by something that's eternal it it's not dated some with me somebody with me it's something that is as fresh today as when it was spoken then because it's eternal god substance right in the word and he said the words that i speak they are spirit and they are life so they're more than just words on the paper but they're a spirit expressing his very thoughts his very mind and his substance of his mind is uttered by the spirit now we're reading from the account of exodus the second book of moses and moses in the presence of this pillar of fire and the theophanic angel of the covenant he would receive a commission with signs of deliverance notice motives moses wrote as i've said the first five books of the bible the story of creation was revealed to a prophet by the hand of an angel amen moses would write in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth you know perhaps you know uh let's say the phoenician people they had their account of of how it all began maybe the the egyptians had all their accounts of how it all began you know perhaps the hebrews from you know had accounts of how it all began but moses would have to forget all of those accounts when he was in the prisons of god and he would come into god's presence and he would begin to receive revelation that would literally transport him back to the very beginning and he would see god created the heavens and the earth amen moses would would write that he would reveal even god's thoughts you know he would he would perhaps even hear and then repeat for us the conversations that you hear between uh from between adam and claude and the conversation between eve and the serpent and the conversation between eve and god moses would actually hear those conversations and he would write down what had happened because that is a gift of a prophet he is able to go up in the spirit and catch those things because they're all eternal they're all thoughts they're all they're all written out there in the in the very tape of god's word and man and so he can just be caught up in the spirit and go back all the way back to the beginning of creation now moses would reveal god's thoughts repeat these conversations and he would actually then confer god's thoughts back to man now how is this possible i mean this is incredible this is totally uh phenomenal beyond supernatural way beyond the comprehension of of human understanding you know we we learned in the prophetic ministry of brother branham that even club could come transporting him back 40 years i'm going to get you just a moment and say say to someone in the prayer line i see you are becoming a much younger person and he would watch them just shrink back to where they were no longer an old person standing maybe in their 60s 70s no 60s they know 70 years or 80s and and he could he could look back and he could say i see you're getting younger and he and he says you know you're you're you're about 12 years old now now can you imagine this go back till she's 12 years old and and he could see her in the classroom i see you in a classroom a school room and and all you hit your pen and it flew it flew up in the air and it struck you in the eye and it blinded your your eye and the woman began to scream and said brother branham that was me i'm blind in my right eye well that would pull him from the vision for a moment and he would stand back a moment and he'd say uh uh wait just a minute he says i see you now you're about 16 years old and he said you you're out on uh on the and you're walking you look like maybe going to school or something you have a checkered dress you have a big ribbon in your hair you have double braids hanging down your back and oh yeah now you're running or you're running from something i see what it is you're running from a big yellow dog and he said you ran up onto a porch and a woman now opens up her door and quickly you ran in and she says brother brandon i thought of that in years but that's exactly the truth that was me well then he said then he says now i see you it's at the age you are now and you're coming from a red barn of fri and you're walking toward a house real slow and there's steps going up this way and as you do there's a flower bed here to your right and it said as you as you will start at the steps you're you're leaning sideways and you're crying from the pain and you're saying if i can ever get to brother branham's meeting it'll all be over and when he said that that you know somebody actually had to catch the woman she started she she fainted because no because of that but when she came to her blind eye was normal and she could move her back anyway and her arthritis was completely healed now this is just one of the thousands of incidences you know the word that god provided to us that the word as the word discerned the heart that the word of the lord that we can say came to a prophet and just as moses could stand and watch all creation unfold the creation of man the fall of man and write it in the bible right down to the conversations so god would use the prophets of the bible to write the word of god for god reveals his secrets to his servants the prophets amen amos 3 and 7 surely the lord god will do nothing but he reveals his secrets to his servants the prophets so god used the prophets of the bible to write the word of god and for god reveals those secrets to his prophets this is god's way of revealing his word are you with me so even that that light i wanted to take for a moment that was that light would take the prophet to the river jordan and even let him see the baptism of jesus amen i mean when when you know he would talk about how that you know when he was a young preacher and then coming up in the in the church that uh as a lay member or lay minister rather of the church and brother roy davis was kind of instructed him and say you know we're baptists and we believe in baptism and john hadn't been baptized so when jesus got baptized to john he said suffered me so to fulfill all righteousness so then jesus turned around and baptized john so you know you know um so you know he had those little talks and brother brown said it just didn't settle right with me and he said you know i don't know good doctor about whether that's true or not i don't know i i i i do you know that sounds good it sounds fine for john to baptize jesus and then jesus turned around and baptized john but you know he said um i don't know but he said one day about two years ago out in the woods where i was sitting the holy spirit came down the light and then i saw it when he revealed it can you imagine now i mean this is different from somebody guessing what was happening there and i am supposing what took place this is someone that glob could take and sit around standing right there on the river jordan and watch the whole thing happen and i just want to say you can't argue with somebody that was there that's what a real witness is come on that's why in the last age that god said the faithful and true witness amen because god would bring a witness to the scripture like none other so that we gentiles in this last day could be sure as we stand on the cusp of the rapture that we can know this is a truth that has been restored that the same one that the pillar of fire brought in the beginning is the same one the pillar of fire revealed in the end time now he would explain that and he said jesus said you know it's becoming to us we fulfill all righteousness and jesus being god john being the prophet quickly jesus knew um that he that john would understand it because him being a prophet the word came to and he said because the sacrifice according to the law had to be washed before it was presented and that is true they would take the sacrifice and wash between its legs and different parts of it before they offered it now so again and jesus said but suffered to be so so he could see the very thing now this is the way the truth and revelation has always come amen this is the bible way i mean in our day education and knowledge it's thought that the true knowledge of god can only come from the high schools of knowledge and learning but but by the way which one of those schools of learning is really ordained of god how many why is it liberty university is it dallas seminary theological seminary is it moody theological seminary and graduate school in chicago which one is it i mean is it is it the university of notre dame or is it the holy greek orthodox school of theology in massachusetts or is it a princeton university cemeteries cemetery you know is it a loyola university in chicago is it yale divinity school is it the methodist university which one of these in fact the matter is there's about 40 000 denominations and they probably all have their school amen so which one of them was god ordained that a pillar of fire appeared to amen i want to ask did an angel visit them were they were there theologians taught by an angel you know if i graduate from loyola university with a summa laude an honorary ti that's an honorary title of highest distinction did god give that to me or did man do it well paul said i i graduated a pharisee of the pharisee i graduated summa laude but i counted it but done that i might win christ and i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached to me is not after man i didn't get this in a degree from man of some summer come larry i got in the presence of the pillar of fire that light i met on the road to damascus and it was their god revealed to me and separated from me the law from grace [Applause] and let me just tell you god bestowed more than an honorary title of summa laude upon william branham he gave him the title of a prophet amen and what must the prophet do is seek out the will the word of god he must do it because being a prophet the word of the lord comes to him they said to brother branham and this is what his critics say well he's not a theologian well never does the bible say the word of god comes to theologian nowhere they're the ones who messes it up the word of god comes to a prophet now what made moses message incredible what what if he to come with the commandments without signs first huh what if he'd come and said now i've been out here 40 years i met god in the wilderness it was a light a pillar of fire so this is all real real um phenomenal real i mean this is a big tale now you're coming out and i met god he took and wrote with his fingers on ten commandments on stone and and here i have these stones right here this is what you're to do oh israel you see you see what if he would appear without the signs and making claims of the appearance of the i am god in a burning bush this would just been a fantastic story come on without signs they would have never believed him but after turning a rod into a serpent after a leper's hand was thrust into his bosom and cleansed after 10 pledged and time after time it never failed israel believed him and got up and left with him and went to a promised land a land they had never seen come on somebody amen where do you think we are going we are following a pillar of fire to a land that has never been seen one i've never laid my eyes on but i know it's there i know it's real yes i know it's real [Applause] wow something's happened in my heart because i've seen the signs of vindication and after thousands of accurate pinpoint discernments after thousands of miracles and healings proven the presence of the angel of god we can believe the message of this messenger when he said i was in the wilderness i'm going to tell you without that talking about coming back and giving a fantastic story i said let there come a squirrel and there come a squirrel there oh yeah right i was there in the wilderness and i spoke to a storm and it dissipated oh yeah right i was there i was there you know you know in in a room and i spoke to a tumor 1500 miles away and it left well the tumor left but didn't have anything to do with you it just was a mistake it's kind of like our grandson jude after coming back and you know seeing the with the the proof of the the kidneys and the enlarged kidney and the the other shrunken and you know only working a certain percentage and and and you know and and coming up for prayer and the baby who would not even wet his diaper at night but next day after prayer start witness diapers every night soggy diapers take him back to the doctor and he said well somebody just made a mistake in in their test you know it's easy to dismiss when you're an unbeliever you don't have anything in you to believe god could do things a thousand times thousands of times over and over and over again jesus said it wouldn't do any good for you if one raised from the dead you wouldn't believe and jesus did raise from the dead and they don't believe we can believe the message of the messenger when he says i was out there in the wilderness i'm getting this now from the message of grace and i looked as i went down to sportsman hollow and something said turn this way and go there and i looked and i saw and there was their three rainbows and they were growing taller and taller and as i saw those rainbows there coming up about a look at like out of the ground you know rare right at ground level and and they were going up and they're pulsating and he says i sat down my gun i started walking closer went towards my towards it with my hands up and something seemed to tell me this is close enough and he said i was actually gonna sit down and take my boots off and see if i could walk a little closer and i got within a few yards of it i could see the color of it it was misting like a fog around and i stood still for a few moments it was right coming right off the top of that little mountain and as i watched the three one to the right and one to the left and the other in the center and running down into the into a bowl like a fair and and said whatever it was was alive amen it was moving it was making its motions and i stood there just as it was gray and dawn and i turned and i looked and i said and i screamed out oh god what would you have your servant know and just then the spirit of god came in and said jesus of the new testament is the jehovah of the old he only changed his mass from spirit to man and that was confirmed and of course my message of him let me know assured that these 31 years has not been in vain hallelujah amen can you imagine we have the truth of the godhead it is absolutely confirmed by the angel of god it's not a prophet's message of his own mind it's the mind of god expressed are you with me and it says jesus of the new testament is jehovah of the old he only changed his mass from spirit to mind how can you message believers come along and get two lords out of that how long how can you get more than one god or jesus a lesser god than god how can you imagine all of that kind of nonsense you've only could get that from a theologian you'd never get that from a prophet of god a prophet of god went in the presence of god and said the jesus of the new testament is the jehovah of the old testament i certify to you brethren that this which we receive is not a man it is a god it didn't come from the catholic university of loyola it didn't come from harvard it didn't come from a school of learning it wasn't summa laude backed up with a diploma by man and certified by man it was certified by god himself he said when i seen them rainbows about as wide as across that hair that halo is that angel of the lord but there were three of them running into one oh my how it helped my heart to know that god that jesus is not just a man as people think he is just a prophet is this modern-day idea today thinks that jesus was just a prophet he is jehovah of the old testament made flesh and dwelt among us amen and he said that sure did comfort me well i'll tell you what i'm comforted too by hallelujah amen we might have had men that could speak in tongues and prophecy and and it's sounding just rattled off like oh it was wonderful but i'll tell you what this prophet was more than a speaker a tongue and a prophesier he was a prophet of god amen he was the seventh angel to the last church age come on church amen and and there he walked into the presence of god and came out with revelation and that's what we believe because it's revelation by divine vindication he says again in the message of grace now jesus christ dwells in the people that's where he dwells now one day christ was in a pillar of fire that's the one you've seen taken find that that picture and keep it up here till we change verses one day christ was in a pillar of fire that one you see taken and we believe it to be jehovah god that's what the angel was trying to get to us notice brother branham bringing this out he said this is what the angel was trying to get to us now this is no theologian trying to pass on his reasoning this is what the angel is trying to get to you amen that now he was in the fatherhood then he was the father of israel a nation then he come down and dwelt among his people as christ the son is that right christ was the son of god now he's christ the holy spirit which is the anointing christ means the anointed anointed one upon the people christ with us the holy spirit is christ in us and then the holy spirit is christ with us in us notice notice now this is so this is so wonderful when i think where our faith is our faith is not in an old mother church that has twisted the words of what was supposed to be her husband from for thousands of years until they've got it molded into something that don't even resemble the bible i'm glad our hope is there brother brethren again let your light so shine see said jesus said the new testament is jehovah the old he just changed his veil when i said studying that i find the same word where he changed his countenance in the in the greek didn't mean changing his mask not exactly his veil but his mask and it come to place he was transformed and that means he changed his way he was jehovah god and jehovah god changed himself from a spirit and become a man he's the same jehovah god which that was the father and this is the son being the same person how do we get two gods out of that how do we get two lords in there how do we get god and his son jesus out of that they're the same person that's what the angel revealed amen now you know i'm going to show you where this is important here in a moment but and then balaam of god brother branham brings it again jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new testament he is the same god just changing his form that's right amen now somebody said the other day a baptist minister in tucson said how can you say that jesus and god would be the same person and i said well it would be very easy if you let your own thinking get away and think bible terms of it they are the south same being god is a spirit and jesus jesus is the body that he was veiled in i said like in my home to my wife i'm her husband i have a young daughter rebecca i'm her father i have a grandson his name is paul i'm his grandfather i'm a husband a father and a grandfather my wife has no claims of me as a father or grandfather she can't has claims of me alone as husband my daughter has no claims of me as husband or grandfather she is my child but yet all these three persons is the same person that's god father son and holy ghost is just dispensation claims god is same the same god amen god changed himself changed his form if you notice in philippians he said now not thinking of robbery but he took on the form of man now the greek word there in that form i've been looking at it all day yesterday trying to think of what it was and i couldn't find out what to come up with this word and morphe and that means that he changed himself he come down in other words he condescended now the greek word that means something that could not be seen yet it's there and then it's changed so the eye can catch it this is exactly what god did he changed forms he could not be seen as the invisible god so he comes and he changes form and becomes a man so the eye can catch it all right we'll go to philippians 2 and 5 and we'll see where where this is written philippians 2 and 5. let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form now that word is morphe and the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god so he was there first in the form of god he didn't believe it was wrong to be god come on and to show himself as god but he made of himself no repetition and took upon him the form the morphe of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of cross so you see for the purpose of dying he changes his form to become a man for the purpose of of giving or making himself to sacrifice to pay for your sins and my sins so in the unveiling of god brother brown said so that's what i'm trying to say that god has always was is the god that always was is here the only thing he done when he become man he changed his mask you see he he this is a morphing he changed himself to what he was to what he is and his mask to another act so he would change his form and he would appear as elohim and then he would appear to abraham as el shaddai the i am the almighty god amen and then he would change again to melchizedek the priest king come on amen because it would be there that would reflect the coming of another priesthood that would not come from levi because jesus would be born of judah but he would be a priest of the order of melchizedek and would be priest king somebody with me now amen now so again he would change his form it would be elohim it would be a shady eye the breasted god it would be melchizedek all of these forms and it would be jehovah jehovah there that he would reveal himself upon the mount all of these and all this you know abraham never got confused he knew it was the same god amen revealing himself as elohim as as el shaddai as melchizedek or however and let me tell you it was the same god that created himself a body and came in jesus and who is this melchizedek he said now we find out this person melchizedek had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending life it was god in morphe the world the the word comes the greek word means to change was used um changing himself and morphing from one person uh the greek word there in morphic means it was taken from the stage act that one person is changing his mask to make another character the english word you know that we would use is morph you know the morph would change from one image to another right amen you know and and so you can you they use it a lot of times in in cartoons and things like that where they'll take a character and he will morph all of a sudden into another creature you know this is what god would do he would morph himself in morphe he would change his form from spirit to man and then back to spirit again for jesus said i come from god and i go back to god i came from god is the spirit that's what i was i become a man and i'm going back to spirit again now then he explains he said like recently i was i believe rebecca just before she graduated they had one of the shakespeare's plays and one man changed his clothes several times because he played two or three different parts but the same person he come out next time one time he's a villain when he comes out another time he's another character now the greek word in morphing means he changed his mask and he said that's what god did it's the same god all the time god in the form of the father the spirit the pillar of fire the same god was made flesh and dwelt among us in morphe brought out so he could be seen as jesus is said of jesus you know no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father he had declared him and now the same god is the holy ghost father son holy not three gods three offices three acts of the one god and when the bible said there is one god not three that's how they couldn't you can't get this straightened out and have three gods you could never sell a jew that i'll tell you that one who knows better he knows there's only one god god and morphy and mask and a pillar of our god and mouth and morphy in a man cry called jesus god and morphy in his church god above us god with us god in us the condescending of god up there holy no one could touch him settle up on a mountain even if a animal touched the mountain had to die and then when god came and changed his tent and come down and lived with us become one of us and we beheld him that the bible said first timothy 3 16 without controversy great is a mystery of godliness for god was manifested in the flesh handled with hands you notice that god was manifest in flesh amen you know he said god ate meat god drank water god slept god cried he was one of us beautiful typed out in the bible that was god above us god with us now it's god in us the holy spirit not the third person the same person god came down and became flesh and died to death in christ so that god so he could clean the church in order to get into it for fellowship god loves fellowship and that's what he made man for at the first time was for fellowship god dwelled along with cherubims and he made man man fell so he came down redeemed man because god loves to be worshipped and the very main word god means object of worship and this comes from this that comes among us as a pillar of fire as something that changes our heart that's the same god listen church that's the same god that said let there be lights amen we've been singing there's power in the name of jesus there's power in the pride of jesus because the same life the same god the same holy ghost the same spirit of christ that dwelts in the corporal body of jesus is now here in bride form that's what he was showing through brother bradley's ministry he wasn't in the heavens he's right here on the earth working in bright people [Applause] his attitude to save toward the sinner come on don't go to tell me days of mercy and grace is over his attitude is the same towards sinner his attitude is sustained toward the lost his attitude's the same toward the sick amen no matter how lost in sin you are he's attitude is the same as he said to the woman at the well hey man leave your pot go go tell them there's a man here a man that can discern your heart a man that can heal your body that can save your soul that can answer the thirst in your hearts [Applause] the same god that said let there be light and there was light he was the same yesterday today and forever now you know there's a christian science woman challenged brother branham on the deity of christ he said she come to him and said i got something one thing against you brother branham i said i love what you're doing but i still got one thing against you and he said well glory be one thing he said i must be doing pretty good all you got is one she said no really i got one thing said um you know i'll tell you my my beef with you is you brag too much on jesus can you imagine that well you know that same spirit got in the message oh yeah and man they didn't want you bragging on jesus no more he just he's not even god he's just a man you know again that same evil spirit got on others and tried to make brother branham god come on so well you know brother branham said well if that's all you got against me and that's all god has against me i hope that's all he got against me is i brag too much on jesus she said well you know you make him divine and he said she said i'll prove he wasn't divine and he said well if he was anything less than god he's the greatest deceiver the world ever had i said the holy ghost god overshadowed the virgin and created a blood cell in the womb and this blood cell was the son of god and through that blood we have remission of sins man knew nothing about that woman she said i never knew a man and that was god himself tabernacling with man god himself i said he was both man and god amen what was it it was god reconciling the world to himself amen oh my wake yourself up now i know you missed an hour of sleep and i'm not going to let you make it up in church you make me work hard i'll tell you i'll take my coat off and work harder put this over there come on pastor hallelujah he said well you make him divine oh he's either god or he's the greatest deceiver the world ever knew a man he was god amen listen let me just go he said anybody that ever amounted to a hill of beans has been people that believed he was god so if you don't get here you'll never amount to hillary beans i'm just quoting the prophet amen you know why because he was emphatic the whole church is built on that revelation jesus said on this rock i'll build my church spirit revealed truth of the supreme deity of jesus christ on this rock the spirit revealed truth of the deity of jesus christ on this rock i'll build my church it's only when the churches establish that the gates of hell cannot prevail against her so you see it's important that we understand and we know who this is among us god hiding himself in simplicity he said when he stood there on the cross he said if you're the son of god and won't you come down on that cross we'll believe you see the same things when they could think of this man doing a miracle then they couldn't deny that but to see him standing there the very god of creation now i know modern trend today tried to make him something of some other person but he was no other person but god himself and that's right today the modern friend said he's a great teacher he he was a prophet he's a great teacher and he was a prophet but he was more than a teacher he was more than a prophet he was god nothing less than god god was in christ reconciling his himself to the world jesus said it's not me that does the thing it's my father and he dwells in me as the father me he was god manifested in the flesh now who taught him the godhead he couldn't have got this from loyola that's a catholic university who believes in three persons that god has three people god in three person blessed trinity well i was off key and i was off tomb but that's what they are they're off-key and they're out of tune because there's no such thing as a trinity even in the bible never one time the word mentioned trinity it's an invention from rome nowhere in the bible is three persons in a god head represented nowhere does it say in the bible jesus was in the godhead but the fullness of the godhead was in him so who taught him to god you know there are certain seemingly well you know some some contradictions in the bible such as matthew 28 and 28 19 won't you put that up for me let's just look at it we're going to baptize one this morning let's talk about this where some you know consider this a contradiction go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost say well brother tim there's three there's the father there's a son and there's the holy ghost that's reasoning you got that calculation by reasoning you didn't get that calculation from the bible come on look at it again go back back and baptize in what the name none of them are names they're all titles they're titles of one name isaiah 9 and 6. put it up for a moment let's see if his name isn't father let's see if his or his title is in father for unto us the child is born unto us the son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called these things these are things his name will be called these these these are uh these are adjectives that will describe him first of all his name isn't wonderful but he sure is he is a counselor but that isn't his name he is the mighty god which means the warrior god and he certainly was he come to take on human battle he's also the everlasting father amen he's the prince of peace is that right these are all the titles of his name but he has a name and they shall call his name jesus jehovah the savior is what that means for he will save his people from their sin and the bible teaches you there is no other name given among men whereby we must be saved amen but matthew 28 19 back up there again so here again and some would say well i know where you're going to next you're going to go to what old peter said i ain't going to believe what peter said i'm going to believe what old i'm only going to believe what jesus said i want you to read right down at the bottom right there and see who was it said that amen come on can anybody read it matthew matthew said jesus said that come on amen we're not arguing with matthew amen because he knew who he knew what the name was amen all of the apostles in the bible knew what that name was and when they carried this out all in the book of acts they carried it out and baptized them in the name of jesus christ every place in the bible where this scripture was put into practice was done that way until the romans got a hold of it and if you're baptized like that in in the titles of father son holy ghost number one you don't know who jesus is number two you've never taken on his name and he said do everything in word or deed do it all in the name of jesus christ so matthew said so are you going to believe matthew now or peter now jesus gives the keys to the kingdom to a man by the name of peter somebody with me he gives up keys to the kingdom to a man by the now he says the keys i don't have my keys with me you got keys on you no anybody got keys there's keys there's one come here so the key is given to open up the door this is what it's for is to stick in there and open the door now this is a father-son holy ghost key it won't open that door it might drive your car but it ain't gonna it ain't gonna open that door it's a father-son holy ghost key and it won't open the door but peter knew how to get the door open he said repent every one of you acts 2 38 repent every one of you amen and be baptized in the name of jesus christ what is the name here we got a name god has a name he was i am that i am in the beginning but now god has a name they don't even know how to pronounce his name i am that i am that loves to pronouncing but god gave us his name his name is jesus [Applause] and if you want to go into heaven you gotta have that key to go in that door because the door into heaven is jesus and you only get it through jesus amen and you've got to be filled with the spirit of jesus to get into heaven repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for remission of sin and you shall [Music] receive the holy ghost as a gift that's what that means receive the holy ghost as a gift it's the person of christ coming into you to dwell in you as the person the father came to dwell in jesus but who taught who taught brother branham the godhead you know when baptism one says baptize the name of the father pentecostals come along with the oneness moves just jesus only just baptize the name of jesus again they don't have the revelation that's why when i baptize always baptize quoting matthew 28 19 and saying in obedience to this divine command i baptize you in the name of the lord that's the father jesus that's the son the holy ghost that's the spirit but they're all in one you say brother tim they're not one like your finger no neither are they two like two fingers or three like three fingers but rather god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and so that one that was in jesus there in the body of jesus can come right here and be right with us [Music] and yet still be in the body of jesus just like the wind can be in minden and be right here now or it can be in california and be blowing all this way and the same wind now so once it's baptized in the name of the father and of the son the holy ghost the other says to administer baptism in the name of jesus christ so you know there's they seem to be this contradiction that god had explained i want you to watch the title brother branham's explaining the godhead and he said some of them said well i'll take what jesus said and not what peter said that's the dumbest thing i ever heard that was coined by the by the early trinitarian pentecostals when when the first uh the the first part the just the infancy of the revelation of the name of jesus was had come in they wow we don't believe what jesus said we're not going to believe what peter said and it wasn't even so much what jesus said is what matthew said jesus said and what peter was preaching was what jesus also said where do you think peter learned that how in the world does 100 you know 2000 get the holy ghost after peter tells them to be baptized wrong then 3 000 souls added right amen so again he said if they're contrary to one another what do we what are we going on if it ain't all god if it all ain't god what part of the bible is right it's got to go inside and come together and only the revelation of god in our schools will never teach it it's a revelation that you must see and then if them two men jesus and peter were contrary to one another then what kind of bible are we reading how do i know whether john 14 is right or not how do i know where john 3 is right how do i know see but only the way i can have faith in god is to know that the bible is right and believe it is right and stay right with it though i don't understand that i move on it anyhow but when these contradictions come up i want you to hear this everybody wake up right now when these contradictions come up then i go before god to find out and the same angel that meets me in the meetings in the night is the same one who taught me this why so well why come back to the bible is taught by the angel of the covenant because it is time for the mysteries to be made known see what day we're living in daniel 12 and 9 said he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed until how long till the time of the end and many should be purified and made white and tried and the wicked just helped me do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand are you with me now but when did he say it would be at the time of the end that these mysteries of the bible would be cleared up now again the end time message shall reveal it the last church age god ordained it until we come to the last church age after they lost the truth of the bible and they did and restoration sort of happened with luther wesley and each one adding a part back but again it took a prophet in this last day who went in the presence of the angel he didn't go to notre dame to get this he went into the presence of the pillar of fire like moses did like paul did like all of them did is somebody with me now amen he said the mystery the things the church bats her eyes and says it's nonsense the mystery of who jesus christ was not a third person not a second person not the third person but the person of god all all these other mysteries of god will be revealed because it's wrote in here in this book and be revealed to the end time generation now who in the world is going to come up and say well brandon make up your mind was he god or isn't he god he is god that's what he taught the whole thing amen that you need to make up your mind first of all get god in your heart and the holy spirit move it and get in the presence of god and he'll reveal and open up the thing to you you'll no longer have this double visions where you see two lords now and he said you know no wonder he says they said they couldn't see it no more in the seminaries and the schools and the nominations and the jews could see jesus being the messiah no wonder they try to think you're crazy no wonder they think you're foolish no wonder they can't understand why you don't clock up with them because there is a power and a vision behind it a word of god that's been revealed to get the church in order for the rapture and the going home yes many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase but thank god he's given us knowledge by the angel of god you see never was a trinity taught by the bible the bible let me tell you let's get it clear this bible is a one god bible amen junior romans 6 and 4 hero israel the lord our god is one lord and message people there never was two lords taught in the bible they ain't two lords zechariah 4 and 14 9 and the lord shall be king over all the earth and that day there shall be one lord and his name lord or his name one get it up there where you can see the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day and there shall be one lord in his name one now to this jesus agreed in mark 12 29 jesus answered him the first of all commandments is here o israel the lord thy god is one lord ephesians 4 and four there is one body and one spirit even as you're all called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all through all and in you all the same god is the one that is father of all come on somebody he is above all and he is now in you all that's the holy ghost now where did these people where do people get two lords from they get it from theologians i'm a student of the message you can't find this stuff in the in the message this is this was never a doctrine of brother brown never something formulated by it wasn't something ever taught by him he never said he never took a sermon and said okay we're preaching on two lords today you know it came from theologians and theologians get the word mixed up because you see they're made up by theories theory theologian theory a theory is a speculation and suppositions surmising and guessing without divine vindication i want you to understand what we have today wasn't surmised wasn't guest [Music] amen it was a prophet going in there in the midst of the pillar of fire and he's saying that jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new it's the same god only changing his mask and if you've got a problem with that you've got a problem with the angel amen psalms 110 verse 1 we're going to go through this for a minute the lord said unto my lord sit down at my right hand until i make thine enemies that footstool so now brother timothy now there's two lords because there's the lord and the lord that's two you're about as cross-eyed as the trinitarians are seeing three what are you saying here watch it now the lord that's jehovah how many agree with me capital o l o r d that's all in caps that represents jehovah the lord jehovah said unto my lord david the king sit down at my right hand until i make thine enemies my footstool so in other words meaning that god had positioned david upon the throne and he would sit in power and authority until all his enemies were conquered that's what this scripture means so jehovah said unto david amen he said unto him sit on the throne sit at my right hand you know sit in a position of power and authority until i make thy enemies my footstool now this became understood to me more than david but now a messianic prophecy whereas the messiah the son of david of the tribe of judah would come and would sit and be enthroned with power and authority and conquer every enemy now jesus would use this on the pharisees in matthew 22 verse 41. let's watch jesus now he uses it you know because they're trying to trap him up and he said well i got one for you now you answer you answer me and then i'll answer you so he says while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked him saying what thank you of christ whose son is he and they said to him the son of david because that's who they believe the messiah would be the one that savior that would come he would save them from the romans they had it all figured out he's going to be the son of david he said there's one promise sit on his throne and he said unto them then how then did david in the spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit down on my right hand till i make thine enemies my footstool if david didn't call him lord how is he his son and i said duh i don't know and no man was able to answer him a word neither dost any man from that day forth ask him any more questions now david called him lord so how is he his son because he is the root and the offspring of david as one born in the tribe of judah in the lineage of david he is also the root in that he is the creator of all things so he was the root of david he was the creator of the world and yet he come and was born in the lineage of david in the tribe of judah and this is how he was he was the lord the creator yet david's son because god was made flesh and dwelt among us now you can't understand that without knowing that jesus was god manifested in the flesh and this is what they didn't want to see now david called him lord so how is he his son because he's the root and offspring now acts chapter 2 verse 34. but david is for david is not ascended into the heavens but he said himself the lord said to my lord sit thou on my right hand so now david when he made this prophecy in the psalms he wasn't in the heavens but he said he said the lord said un to my lord sit thou on my right hand well then you would have to be in the heavens to sit on the right hand of god so he said david's not a sin in the heavens but he said himself the lord said unto myself say unto unto my lord sit down on my right hand until i make thy foes that footstool therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that the god hath made this same jesus whom you have crucified he is both lord and christ so when jesus rose from the dead come on amen he was not only he was not only christ the messiah the man of the flesh but now he's the lord of lord and the king of kings amen so he was made lord ruler of the universe just and hello the ruler of the death hell and the grave and this powerful and majestic lord is christ the messiah amen hebrews chapter 10 verse 11 every priest standeth daily ministered in offering sometimes oftentimes the same sacrifice which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice now here he's going over he said look think of the millions of lambs that have been slain and none of them could take away sin but he said but this man this man jesus after he'd offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of god from henceforth expect until his enemies be made his footstool so he said this man offered one sacrifice and went there and sat in the realm of power and authority now this right hand of god does not mean he's a lesser god setting besides a greater god this is not two people reigning either on the throne and the other at his right hand first of all god is a spirit and he don't have a hand god only has a hand when he has a body come on somebody amen and secondly the right hand means it means the position of power and authority and that simply means that this man jesus after he offered one sacrifice for sin has offered back has entered back into the power and authority of being god again and through this very act of his death at calvary everything every demon spirit every devil of hell ever sin and every sickness will eventually be fully and totally conquered and ruled by him he is confident that what he did at calvary works and that all we gotta do is come in his name and that name will cast out devils that name amen will transform lives that name will save the violence sinner from sin he he has no more work to do on earth because that one sacrifice will defeat every devil every addiction every drug habit every spirit of alcohol every demon of hell [Applause] the revelation of jesus christ in the church age book yes if there were three gods you might very well baptize for father son and the holy ghost but the revelation given to john was that there was one god in his name is the lord jesus christ and you baptize for one god you baptize for one god and only one well wait a minute don't get on from me for believing in one god he said here you baptize for one god and only one and that's why peter baptized the way he did at pentecost he had the true revelation which was let the all the house of israel know assuredly that god had made the same jesus whom you crucified both lord and christ there is the lord jesus christ amen and he says if jesus is both lord and christ and he jesus is and cannot be anything else but father son and holy ghost in one person manifested in the flesh it is not one god in three persons blessed trinity but one god one person with three major titles with three offices manifesting those titles here once more this same jesus is both lord and christ lord father i'm still reading lord father and christ holy spirit are jesus for he jesus is both of them lord and christ amen put that put that scripture back up there that last one he had made the same jesus both lord and christ now let's read it again notice this can you find it all right well it was a one before it was acts chapter 2 verse 36 amen therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god have made this same jesus whom you crucified both lord brother branham said that's father and christ that's holy ghost now ephesians church age he said these things which hold at this the seven stars in his right hand we walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlestick this is he of whom it said the same jesus is both lord and christ there he is the one and only lord god almighty and beside him there is no other there he is the savior salvation lord jonah 2 9 walk in the midst of the churches through these seven ages what he was in the first age he he is in all ages to every believer he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did once still do it and we'll keep on doing it that's right you know again i'm going to come back to this because i hear it all the time from people you don't want to come and say you know i heard your oneness i had somebody write me the other day from australia i heard you're a oneness well i do believe in one god not three and i believe in one lord not two and i'm not a oneness but i'm not a oneness like the upc and to jesus only i'm a believer in one god and his name is the lord jesus christ now in the revelation of jesus christ the church's book he said the spirit of god in john expressly thus expresses dustly in one in order to set forth the supreme deity of jesus christ and to reveal the godhead as one god so i don't know how you're getting more than one so well he ain't one it was god and his son jesus and jesus was not god now you're heathen now you now you've done come back to the place where you know anybody that that would ever amount to hillary beans will believe that jesus is the supreme deity okay so you say well but brother tim jesus couldn't be his own father but the eternal spirit the father created himself a body thus god fathered a son and came and dwelt in him now god is not one like your finger i'm going to go over that again neither is he true like two fingers and he's certainly not three like three fingers rather god was in christ reconciling the world to himself now this is this is really important that we under we understand this now watch this in discerning the body of the lord he said how many knows that jesus today is a pillar of fire that's the form he's here now in amen that followed the children of israel i came from god i'd go to god i came from that pillar of fire i'm returning back to there when paul met him on the road to damascus what was he the great light the bill of fire he's the same one today the holy spirit of god the body of jesus sets at the right hand of god on his throne in heaven but his spirit is here on the earth and completing completing and finishing his work now wait a minute so he can't be one like your finger because his body is there and his spirit is here and he said that same spirit that lived in the body of jesus christ was the same spirit that was in that angel that came down to sodom and gomorrah do you believe that the same one that followed the children of israel so again see he's not one like his finger he can be in the body of jesus upon the throne not comatose but ever living to make intercession come on and yet the same spirit of christ be in your heart and still move and blow like the rushing mighty wind through the church or even manifest himself in a pillar of fire to save jesus because brother branham said he's the same in every detail but his corporal body because he's not here in his corporate body he's here in the body of his church the same pillar of fire so what body is jesus in now in revelation book of symbols he said in the old testament he was a pillar of fire that led to children of israel that was christ the ark the angel of the covenant in the old in the new testament he manifested himself in flesh to take away sin to bring us back to sons and daughters of god one day coming down the road become a little sassy jew he's going to arrest those people who were crying and praising god and prophesying and what met him a beautiful light what body is jesus in now a light the same pillar of fire that it was at the beginning now we're talking about what body is he in now upon the earth because we'll meet the corporal body of jesus christ in the air amen but what body does he appear now in in a pillar of fire and then each one of us get a lick of that pillar of fire so he dwells in us too so he can't be one like your finger you see he you know he is there he's in your heart he is there in the congregation he's in your heart my heart everybody around the world at the same time come on he's not one like your finger and man but he is there he is one god but he can manifest himself in the in the in the in the body on the throne ever living to make intercession there in a pillar of fire discern the thoughts and intents of heart heal the sick come on he can there come transform himself right there as the angel of the covenant he can come right there move within your heart he can come and move through the church and licks of fire followed up on 120 in the upper room amen he's not one like your finger but he's the same god now brother bradham tells us god told moses i'm going to send an angel my angel before you to keep you in the way and anybody knows that angel was jesus christ which was the pillar of fire it was christ his name wasn't jesus yet until he was manifested in the flesh you know i was looking just a few moments ago for an address and somebody on there called one of our brothers uh a branamite we're not a brand of mite we were we're following the pillar of fire that's what we're following we're we're not a little william branham we're a follower of jesus christ we're a christian you see me are you are you with me am i here you see as he said his name let me let me read it together he said i'm going to send an angel before you to keep you in a way that anyone knows that angel was jesus christ which was a bill of our it was christ his name wasn't jesus yet until he was manifested in flesh and there you shall call his name jesus yeshua amen because he will save his people from their sins are you with me now so you see this is where he would come in the last as he approached in the last church age and he said i'm going to do something i'm going to set before you an open door and he's talking about it in the philadelphian age and he's telling there's a revelation coming that's just going to open the door to the rest of the scripture and he said what was that open door he said it was a revelation of the supreme deity of jesus christ not being a second person of a trinity but being god himself made flesh and dwelling among us so god would be given an open door don't try to close the door and make two lords or three gods or whatever else come on now church amen we gotta we gotta keep it right because it's a revelation when you know who jesus is then you know who you are amen and if you can be assured that this jesus that we are servant today he was in a pillar of fire discerning the thoughts and end thoughts of a heart he was so light that appeared on the road to damascus he was the one who dwelt in jesus christ he was the one that appeared to moses he was the one that created the heavens and the earth amen he is that same god and whatever he did then he's that same god that i moved today if he healed the sick then he'll heal the sick now if he raised the dead dead he'll raise the dead now cause he's the same god [Applause] and he's both lord and christ lord jesus christ father son holy ghost same god in his fatherhood his sonship and in his spirit [Music] this open door now what is that open door he said it's what is it but a revelation of him that revelation is opening up to bring us strength so brother tim you know you're you're really preaching elementary this is to give you strength amen to illuminate the word and glorify his name now you can see the same god working all the way through and he's here right now finishing up redemption oh hallelujah oh i'm so glad we don't have seven more ages to go i'm so glad we ain't got 2 000 more years to travel this journey i'm so glad we have reached the end i'm so glad we can see the manifestation of god in this hour bringing in the word that brought us hallelujah that our message is based on the saint the lord a man from the angel of god himself yes we knew him was god how else could he be our savior but to know he was only god or god alone that he is both he is alpha and omega that he's both jesus both lord in christ making him lord jesus christ the father son the holy ghost all one person and that has been lost since the first ages and but first church ages but now we are seeing it again the revelation of who he was has come back amen amen you want to take the power out of the church let a theologian mess it up amen they'll take it there until they ain't even an amen anymore they ain't even a hallelujah anymore they ain't even a movement of the spirit anymore it's as dead as as a roman catholic church you might as well have a priest coming down with a lantern sprinkling incense everywhere and it's the same old hedonism that there ever was but god is establishing a church of death saith the lord but by divine vindication showing it over and over and over and over and this angel never leaves us this angel encamps about us this angel won't leave you in your sins going to save you from your sins this angel won't leave you alone come on amen you might be way down deep in sin amen you might be like this brother that's going to be baptized you've never known jesus but i tell you it doesn't matter whether you ever knew him or not he knew you before the foundational world and he called you and he kept dealing with your heart and dealing with your heart and dealing with your heart amen i created you for fellowship i'm taking a people for my namesake and it's like a bride and a groom because physically we're not women but the church is he's the head of it and she's the body so it's like a bride and a groom so she's the bride and she's being married to the groom she's becoming one she's taken on his name she's been identified with him she has been changed there's a change transforms i always marvel you know when a bride and groom to come together they actually both change that's right you'll see them both change they'll just you know this boy may be this way and this girl that way and maybe they come from two different houses and they have different thoughts and what if they come to get married when they come along you'll see them once become one they're not just they're not two anymore they're one and they think alike and they believe alike and they're working together that's what oneness is are you with me amen but in this deal amen god is bringing us back to our original the way we were in his mind before the world began and so we come and unite with him and it isn't that he changes is that we change as we behold his image and we are transformed from glory to glory as we look into the word we are transformed in that same image of the word until us and the word becomes the same what you read on the paper becomes flesh [Applause] hallelujah i believe that's exactly what god's doing in this day he has taken the word that was on paper and making it flesh where people will be called for his namesake amen the revelation of godhead is back now the true church can build in strength again after all this time she finally knows who her lord is unless some theologian messes with her and all after all this time she knows who our lord is once again we're baptized in the name of the lord jesus just as he did at pentecost now i'm trying to get you to see who this is that has revealed the word in this day this message is a revelation of himself the pillar of fire that was discerning the hearts and revealing the mysteries is none other than the creator himself that's why in the prayer line a young boy walks up to brother branham and he's blind and he has no eyes and he asked him what color would you like your eyes to be a blind boy has never seen no color he's only heard of blues and pinks and reds and whatever and he says blue and they pray and formed in his sockets comes the prettiest set of blue eyes that you would ever see these things are not fixing they happened and that god is still just as real of god today [Music] who can take a little woman and one moment black with cancer the next moment clean he's the same god that can take a soul that is black with sin and in one moment turn it and cleanse it and make it white as snow this is the creator yes it is the creator let the musicians come what is it we're following who is it we're following who was it that revealed itself the man i knew is william branham when i sat how old are you 13. i was two years younger than you and i sat maybe that far away maybe about like william was right over on the wing right on the way my family sat right over there and this man talked about an angel i never saw the angel i didn't see the fire but i saw the effects i saw hearts discerned i saw things that man couldn't know unless some being was talking to him and that being go back 40 years in the life and tell him i saw you he was a little girl this is how you was dressed a pencil flew up no it was a pen it hit you in the eye it blinded your eye that was me oh i see you now about 16. you're running you're dressed in a checkered dress you've got braids it's a yellow dog that's chasing you oh now i see you an older woman you're coming up the steps there's a red barn you're coming from that barn you're walking down and now you're coming and as you come up the steps you're leaning over sideways and you said if i can ever get to brother branham i'll be healed who told him all of that now i was going to baptize brother james here james lingle strong somebody asked me what his name was he said lingo let's find out his name what's his last name if i would have guessed ain't no telling what i would have guessed i couldn't have made a if i just stood here the rest of my life i probably wouldn't ever get it i mean james is a bible name so that'd be pretty easy to get after maybe 100 or so guesses maybe less i might have got james the strom i'd have never got that i'd be here the rest of my life but god knows he said about you before you were formed in your mother's womb i knew you and i ordained you there's a book symbolic perhaps it's a symbolic book but it's a book and there were names that were written in there before the foundation of the world god knew you were coming he knows everyone that he is he knows exactly where to find you and how to find you he'll find some down in the gutters of sin he'll find some in halls of education mean just recently there was a you know i was supposed to go to japan minister and you know what happened kobe struck and i couldn't go things happened blocked the plans the very time i was to go to japan i i flew out to brother ron because he was come down with the first symptoms was fixing go first first treatments of cancer this was february and about the first day of january he finds out i've got cancer you got cancer it's melanoma it's in your lungs i'm supposed to go to japan and they're unannounced he don't even know i'm coming no meetings are planned i go in there and i preach saturday night and sunday morning wow the moment i'm supposed to be in japan there's a little lady there that's been witnessing she has actually graduated in her class with honorary degrees this lady been through a lot of sorrows and troubles of her own cancer and so on but she knows god is god she went to her japanese professor and she said to him there is a god i've heard you teach in the classes that there is a god that there isn't no god but there is a god and said if you don't believe it you tune in to the service we're going to have she didn't know i was preaching you turned into the service there at full gospel lighthouse tabernacle and that man who preaches will discern your heart and repeat our conversation say well brother tim i've been wondering there was a god i sat at the table with my wife yesterday we had on a plate i had cooked cabbage a salad dressing tomatoes in that lettuce i had fish blackened fish that had prepared on the stove i had all that laying before me a sweet potato i picked it up i said look at this leaf we're just talking we're just fellowshipping i'll pick up a leaf of a cabbage i said where did it come from i said now look over here look how different this is and i pick up her potato peel because i eat all of mine and i said where did this come from it's all together different from this cabbage i said look right there look over here you got beans on your plate too i said where'd they come from they're all together different i said did they just happen there did they just accidentally get on this plate that they we just you know they just something grew in the world and they just feared out of nothing i said look at you how different you are from this cabbage where did you come from you're so different from this cabbage and this these beans i said she shows us a designer as a creator amen i said now they want us to believe it's just two acids rubbing together but i said look here i have on my arm an apple watch have that get there i said how many millions of years would it take for two acids rubbing together to become this watch in my arm it's made out of some kind of plastic material here and some glass there and some parts in there that i don't know what is and everything some metal there on the wine stem and this and that where how how many years would it take for it just to come and now i can pick it up as a watch one billion years later it all came together and now here it is all of them and what's in my arm no i said there was a master designer there was a designer that said i want to watch and i want it like this and this and he designs and he figures and he comes and he gets the components he puts it all together it was a plan but i said where did he get all of that from he got that from the designer who made it all this is not an accident and you're not an accident and we're not just here by chance we're here by supreme design and god has called you for a purpose you're not without a purpose you're here for a reason the sooner you find that purpose the happier you're going to be because the devil wants to pervert you to his own purpose but god wants to transform you back into the image that he had of you before the world began let's buy our heads let's just talk to him just for a moment maybe you're here today and you just realize i really need a really a closer walk with that god i really do i want to come to know him more than what i've known him i need a deeper revelation of him and i just pray he'll make himself known to me he showed me that he cared he showed me he cares and he loves me so much that he came to earth to die in my place my lord will you just show me how to serve you you just show me your purpose you just show me lord will you just put the pieces in my life together or that i can work out the plan of god i can step right there because that's where i'll be the happiest would you just raise your hand to god and say that's me brother tim god sees you sees you god sees you god sees you god sees you lord will you bless us lord and you'll bless the word father lord will you just come in in a mighty way lord in this service today just move lord in hearts and lives change this lord into thy image in the name of jesus let

happened about 2 000 years ago when john was baptizing in the river jordan and jesus came to him to be baptized in the water that's where every son of god must come he must come to the word the word must come to the prophet as it was and we've been a part of god before the world began we are part of the great plan of god therefore the bride is the word of god chuck always comes to the prophet in the water and here this brother comes as jesus did many years ago and john had been preaching and saying you know there's i baptize with water but there's one that's coming after me that will baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire and of course that's where every baptizer stands he cannot give the holy ghost but there's one that comes after him after we obey the word after we do what god's word said then the holy spirit will come back and confirm it when a person truly repents and is baptized in his name god is obligated to give them the baptism of the holy ghost may the dub came to
