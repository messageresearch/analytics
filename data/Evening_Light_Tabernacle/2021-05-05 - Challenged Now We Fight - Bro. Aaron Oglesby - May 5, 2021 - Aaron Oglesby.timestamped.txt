[27:08] i ask you to take control now father of
[27:10] each and every part
[27:11] in jesus name we pray amen
[27:14] [Music]
[27:16] if you'll turn with me in your bibles to
[27:17] first samuel
[27:19] the 17th chapter
[27:22] first samuel the 17th chapter will start
[27:24] at verse 1.
[27:28] very familiar scripture very familiar
[27:30] story will be coming from tonight
[27:41] brother craig it's wonderful to see you
[27:42] and your family god bless you
[27:47] it says now the philistines gathered
[27:48] together their armies to battle
[27:51] and were gathered together at shoka
[27:53] which belongeth
[27:54] to judah and pitched between shoka and
[27:57] azika
[27:58] and aphis diamond and saul
[28:01] and the men of israel were gathered
[28:03] together and pitched by the valley of
[28:04] elah
[28:05] and set the battle in a ray against the
[28:07] philistines
[28:09] and the philistines stood on a mountain
[28:10] on one side and israel stood on a
[28:12] mountain on the other side and there was
[28:13] a valley between them
[28:15] and there went out a champion out of the
[28:17] camp of the philistines named goliath
[28:19] of gath whose height was six cubits and
[28:22] a span
[28:23] and he had a helmet of brass upon his
[28:25] head and he was armed with a coat of
[28:27] mail
[28:27] and the weight of the coat was five
[28:29] thousand shekels of brass
[28:31] and he had greaves of brass upon his
[28:33] legs and a target of brass between his
[28:35] shoulders
[28:36] and the staff of his spear was like a
[28:38] weaver's beam and his spear's head
[28:40] weighed 600 shekels of iron
[28:42] and one bearing a shield went before him
[28:46] you know i read that and it struck me
[28:48] that was just another man bearing his
[28:49] shield
[28:51] his shield bearer was just another
[28:52] philistine but the one that went before
[28:54] david was almighty god
[28:56] the one that goes before you tonight
[28:57] it's just not another person carrying
[28:59] your shield
[28:59] he is your shield he is your buckler
[29:02] what do we have to fear
[29:06] and he stood and cried unto the armies
[29:07] of israel and said unto them why are you
[29:09] come out to set your battle in a ray
[29:12] and not i philistine and you servants to
[29:14] saul choose you a man
[29:16] for you and let him come down to me and
[29:18] if he be able to fight with me and to
[29:20] kill me
[29:21] then we will be your servants but if i
[29:23] prevail against him and kill him
[29:25] then shall you be our servants and serve
[29:27] us and the philistines said
[29:29] i defy the armies of israel this day
[29:33] give me a man that we may fight together
[29:36] when saul and all israel heard these
[29:38] words of the philistine they were
[29:40] dismayed and greatly afraid
[29:44] may god had his blessing as you have
[29:46] your seats
[29:51] tonight i'd like to take a simple
[29:53] thought entitle it
[29:55] challenged now we fight
[30:00] challenged now we fight
[30:03] you know i feel like sometimes that we
[30:05] think that we are waiting on god
[30:07] to move on our behalf in reality god has
[30:10] done
[30:11] all that he needs to do for us he has
[30:13] already paid the price he has already
[30:15] healed the sickness he has already saved
[30:16] our souls
[30:17] and he's waiting on us to respond to the
[30:19] challenge he's waiting on us to step out
[30:22] in faith and do our part
[30:23] brother branham would say time after
[30:25] time that if the lord jesus was here
[30:27] in this very suit tonight he couldn't do
[30:28] no more for you than what he's already
[30:30] done
[30:31] he's already met the challenge he
[30:33] already knew what you would go through
[30:34] he's already provided for the situation
[30:36] that you're in tonight
[30:37] and we're sitting back going god move
[30:39] god move and he's saying no son
[30:41] i've already done it for you you move
[30:43] you step out tonight
[30:45] you do your part you come out the boat
[30:47] and walk on the waters that thing's not
[30:48] going to harm you because i've already
[30:50] taken care of this situation
[30:52] and so he's waiting on us to take a
[30:54] stand he's waiting on us
[30:56] to take a step and ever since the fall
[30:59] in the garden of eden that's how it's
[31:00] been
[31:01] man has had to battle the enemy for
[31:04] every inch of ground
[31:06] we know that that the enemy came to eve
[31:08] and with his lies he deceived her and
[31:10] she fell and then
[31:11] in turn adam also fell and because of
[31:13] this fall
[31:14] all of mankind was sold into sin
[31:17] relationship with god and fellowship
[31:19] with god they were all cut off
[31:21] they weren't how they once had been
[31:24] brother branham says that then angel
[31:26] battles come down to earth
[31:28] and they become human battles he said
[31:30] that satan come to destroy
[31:32] what god had created he said the battle
[31:34] came to earth
[31:35] and it began in us and it has been
[31:37] raging
[31:38] ever since i'm telling you church the
[31:40] battle that started it has been raging
[31:43] ever since
[31:43] it is a daily battle it is a daily
[31:46] struggle sometimes we don't know how
[31:48] we're going to take the next step
[31:49] but let me tell you tonight how we're
[31:50] going to take the next step we're going
[31:52] to take it through the power of the lord
[31:54] jesus christ
[31:54] we're going to take the next step
[31:56] because we win we're going to take the
[31:58] next step because satan don't have
[32:00] enough tonight
[32:01] to stop you it doesn't matter what he's
[32:03] put you through he's not going to stop
[32:05] you
[32:05] you are predestinated you are anointed
[32:08] to overcome
[32:09] you are predestinated and anointed for
[32:11] this moment
[32:12] he cannot stop us but man's position
[32:16] became a contested position
[32:18] and even though everything that was lost
[32:20] it was restored there at calvary brother
[32:22] brown would say
[32:23] every redemptive promise of god was
[32:25] restored back to us
[32:27] we still must constantly fight for it
[32:30] it's been restored but you're gonna have
[32:32] to fight for it
[32:33] down through the ages every man that has
[32:36] ever obtained anything from god has
[32:38] fought for it
[32:39] he has put his shoulder to the wheel
[32:41] he's put on the armor of god he's gone
[32:43] to battle and he's fought for everything
[32:44] he's ever gotten
[32:46] every man that ever overcame every man
[32:48] that was ever healed
[32:50] every man that ever received the baptism
[32:52] of the holy ghost they fought for it
[32:53] they fought for it they went to war for
[32:55] it it was a constant battle of faith
[32:58] it constantly is at war and it's not
[33:01] going to be any different in your life
[33:02] tonight church
[33:04] you see something that belongs to you
[33:06] you see a promise you see something that
[33:08] that god has restored to us and you say
[33:10] that's mine
[33:11] i'm gonna go get it and i agree with you
[33:14] it is yours and you do have rights to it
[33:16] but you're gonna have to fight
[33:18] in order to obtain it you gotta be ready

[35:54] satan challenging them at every turn
[35:57] constantly in your ear
[35:59] you don't deserve it you can't attain
[36:02] it you can't receive it and satan is
[36:06] determined
[36:07] more than ever now on this last day to
[36:09] fight you to lie to you
[36:11] to battle against you to keep you from
[36:13] attaining all that god has promised for
[36:15] you in their last days
[36:16] listen we didn't get all the way down
[36:18] here to the end and satan goes you know
[36:20] what
[36:21] they're right
[36:24] they keep telling me i'm defeated they
[36:26] keep telling me they're healed
[36:28] i'm just going to back off no it's not
[36:31] going to be that way
[36:33] listen i was sitting there praying with
[36:35] my dad in the hospital the other day and
[36:36] he looked at the app
[36:37] at me and he said the devil just don't
[36:39] quit does he
[36:41] no he don't but neither does my god my
[36:44] god don't quit
[36:45] and his people don't quit and his
[36:46] anointed don't quit and we keep going
[36:49] and we keep fighting and we keep
[36:50] pressing on
[36:51] because our god is greater greater is he
[36:54] that is in you
[36:55] than he that is in the world so let him
[36:57] do his worst
[36:58] let him come let him fight but
[37:00] somebody's going to take his head off
[37:02] tonight
[37:02] [Applause]
[37:05] so he's going about now like a roaring
[37:07] lion he knows his time is short
[37:09] and he's going to challenge you and he's
[37:11] going to fight you and he's going to
[37:12] scream and he's going to kick all the
[37:14] way down
[37:15] you're going to be tested your faith is
[37:17] going to be tried
[37:18] your courage is going to be proved

[37:26] challenged every great man down through
[37:27] the ages he challenged brother branham
[37:29] he's going to challenge you
[37:32] brother branham says and as it was then
[37:35] so it is now
[37:36] that when god's people starts to go to
[37:38] do something
[37:39] the enemy always has a challenge he's
[37:43] always going to challenge you
[37:44] for it but let me tell you something

[41:47] rise to the challenge of this hour
[41:49] willing to face the enemy and say get
[41:51] off my property
[41:53] get out of my life give me my health
[41:55] back give me my joy back
[41:57] give me my victory back listen it ain't
[41:59] just for preachers it ain't just for
[42:01] deacons it ain't just for singers

[42:05] for housewives

[42:13] that deliverance is for you that healing
[42:15] is for you that salvation
[42:17] is for you that devil is a liar you have
[42:19] not gone too far
[42:20] you wouldn't be here tonight he wouldn't
[42:22] be taking on your heart
[42:23] if you've gone too far but you're right
[42:26] where you were supposed to be
[42:27] he saw you here before the foundation of
[42:29] the world and he said answer the call
[42:32] answer the challenge it's for you
[42:35] [Applause]
[42:42] we've got to be more like israel israel
[42:45] don't take
[42:46] with allowing trespassers
[42:52] one footstep into their property one
[42:54] rocket launched one attack and they said
[42:56] we retaliate
[42:58] we're going to fire back it's time some
[43:00] of y'all picked up the rocket launcher
[43:02] of the word and fired one right back at
[43:04] him
[43:04] too long we took shells too long we took
[43:06] bombardment too long we sat there and
[43:08] listened
[43:09] and we began to listen and believe
[43:11] that's the problem
[43:12] that's the problem this to me faith
[43:14] comes by hearing but doubt comes by
[43:16] listening as well
[43:18] you can't constantly give your ear to
[43:20] the enemy and then expect to overcome it
[43:22] uh you've got to turn your ear away and
[43:24] when he lobs a lie at you just lob it
[43:26] right back
[43:26] at him get that rocket launcher and fire
[43:28] one right back and say no this is my
[43:30] territory
[43:31] that's my border i believe it was
[43:32] brother andrew glover said draw a line
[43:34] in the sand and if he near dares come
[43:37] across it
[43:38] just launch one i'll tell you what if he
[43:39] even gets too close to it go ahead and
[43:41] launch one at him he deserves it anyway
[43:43] just go ahead and launch one at the
[43:45] enemy tonight
[43:46] fire one adam protect your land
[43:50] too many times we're facing the things
[43:52] we're facing because we didn't do
[43:53] anything
[43:55] because we waited too long because we
[43:57] didn't think it was that big a deal
[44:02] listen he doesn't belong in your land
[44:04] it's your
[44:05] land therefore it belongs to you he has
[44:09] no right there it doesn't matter where
[44:11] he
[44:11] is it doesn't matter what part of the
[44:14] land he's on it doesn't matter if he's
[44:15] just out there in the outskirts
[44:17] it doesn't matter if he's just barely
[44:19] nibbling at your joy
[44:22] barely messing with your peace just a
[44:24] little bit
[44:25] barely trying to disrupt your home just
[44:27] a little bit and you're going
[44:28] that's not that big a deal it is a big
[44:30] deal because that's not all he wants
[44:32] that's not all he's after he's just
[44:34] looking for a foothold
[44:36] he's looking for an opportunity to come
[44:37] in and destroy to rob to kill
[44:39] to take everything god promised you if
[44:41] he's even trying to touch a little bit
[44:43] of my promise i say blast him
[44:45] i say take the word and go on the
[44:47] offensive tonight
[44:48] and run him clear out of the country
[44:53] run him out
[44:56] i don't know why this has came to my
[44:57] mind but i used to tell my kids the
[44:59] story of three little pigs and jackson
[45:01] loves it
[45:02] and the story ends with the last thing
[45:05] you saw was the big bad wolf running
[45:06] over the farthest hill
[45:08] and he never came back again but too
[45:10] many times we just run him out a little
[45:12] bit and go that'll do
[45:13] i mean no taste that big bad wolf out of
[45:15] the country
[45:16] chase him until he's too far away keep
[45:18] him on the run
[45:19] keep him going stay on his trail sinking
[45:23] go after him let him have no peace
[45:26] tonight
[45:27] [Applause]
[45:29] amen don't minimize the devil's presence
[45:31] in the land
[45:32] because you seem you deem the situation
[45:34] no big deal
[45:36] it is a big deal
[45:40] i've said this before let's simplify it
[45:41] because sometimes was that that big a
[45:42] deal and did brother branham really mean
[45:44] that and he says
[45:45] listen if it's in the word if it's in
[45:48] the message
[45:49] brother browning was here for a short
[45:50] period of time there's eleven hundred
[45:52] and something sermons on tape
[45:53] if god deemed it important enough to
[45:55] take up space on one of them tapes
[45:57] in the short amount of time he was here
[45:58] it's a big deal if he deemed it
[46:00] important enough to put it in this word
[46:01] i don't care if it's one word to it it
[46:03] is a big deal
[46:05] quit minimalize it just because it ain't
[46:06] a big deal according to what you
[46:08] think it's a big deal
[46:12] and if he's trespassing on your land
[46:14] even if it's the edge of your land it's
[46:16] still trespassing
[46:19] don't dismiss the issue and act like
[46:21] nothing's happening
[46:22] don't wait till he's inside your house
[46:24] to try to deal with it
[46:26] don't wait till your family is in danger
[46:29] go after him now
[46:30] go after him tonight leave no doubt
[46:33] where you stand
[46:37] we're too passive
[46:42] you know it would do wonders for your
[46:43] children to see daddy go to war with the
[46:45] devil
[46:48] it would do wonders for your marriage
[46:50] for your spouse to see you go to war for
[46:52] the marriage vow you made years ago
[46:55] it would do wonders for your family
[46:58] if you would take to take down the
[47:00] goliath that's haunting your life
[47:02] instead of just dealing with it and
[47:03] making excuses for it
[47:04] because it sets a trend and it sets a
[47:06] cycle daddy lived with it daddy never
[47:08] overcame it i guess i'm not going it's
[47:10] like i try to tell people
[47:11] don't let those family cycles follow you
[47:13] don't let those family cycles bring you
[47:15] down i say all the time
[47:16] it ran in my family until it ran into me
[47:19] it ran in my family until it ran into me

[47:23] want to know all about your daddy's
[47:24] health
[47:25] all about his health issues and your
[47:27] family health issue why that way they
[47:28] can take something and pin it on you

[47:32] here let me tell you something a little
[47:33] bit about the history of my father

[48:51] brother branham says i'm telling telling
[48:53] you it sent the rock to the killing
[48:55] place
[48:56] and down went goliath you know what
[48:58] happened then the israelites took
[49:00] courage
[49:01] in a way they went they cut philistines
[49:03] plum to the walls
[49:05] it just takes one person that's got
[49:07] enough courage
[49:08] to step out and say it's right and god
[49:10] said so
[49:11] brother you'll down a goliath and your
[49:13] whole family will go to cut cutting
[49:15] philistines the first thing you know

[49:32] what an awesome god we sir
[49:37] there is a people a chosen people called
[49:41] for this day
[49:42] called to stand and satan has stepped
[49:45] out in this age
[49:47] and declared his great challenge satan
[49:50] says
[49:51] i've made this world too easy to evil
[49:54] i've made it too evil i'm too powerful i
[49:57] filled the world with doubt
[49:59] i filled this world with fear there's
[50:01] not going to be any overcomers
[50:04] you're not going to rapture there will
[50:06] not be a victorious church
[50:09] you will not receive the baptism of the
[50:12] holy ghost
[50:14] but judging by some of the things people
[50:15] are preaching and teaching today a lot
[50:16] of
[50:17] preachers agree with the devil
[50:23] he's challenging anointed services
[50:26] he's challenging the moving of the
[50:27] spirit he's
[50:29] challenging the creating of an
[50:30] atmosphere that allows those births to
[50:32] take place
[50:33] trying to rob the life right out of
[50:34] services against
[50:36] worship against the moving of the holy
[50:39] spirit
[50:40] listen that's why jude had to say there
[50:41] in the first verse beloved when i gave
[50:43] all diligence to write unto you of the
[50:45] common salvation it was needful
[50:47] for me to write unto you and exhort you
[50:49] that you should earnestly contend
[50:50] for the faith which was once delivered
[50:52] unto the saints it was already
[50:54] they were already coming in they were
[50:56] already trying to change it they were
[50:57] already trying to formalize it
[50:59] listen that's a great challenge in this
[51:01] day it is a great challenge that the
[51:03] devil would come in
[51:04] and try to formalize things jude says
[51:06] contend for it
[51:08] fight for it challenge accepted now we
[51:11] fight we will not stand for that
[51:12] in evening light tabernacle we're not
[51:15] going to stand for some formalized
[51:17] religion
[51:18] we got to fight for it we can't let it
[51:20] slip away
[51:21] we can't let man's ideas come and twist
[51:23] it up
[51:24] listen we got to learn from the mistakes
[51:26] of the past ages
[51:28] from from the past moves of god at the
[51:30] very first age in the ephesian age
[51:32] the wolves came in with that nicolaitan
[51:34] spirit and they began to try to
[51:36] formalize things and already do away
[51:38] with the experience of pentecost that
[51:40] had just come only a few short years
[51:42] before that
[51:43] they tried to do away with that and at
[51:45] first it was called their deeds but very
[51:47] shortly it became their doctrine
[51:49] it became the doctrine and it began to
[51:53] rob the life out of it to where each
[51:54] church age got more and more formal more
[51:56] and more formal
[51:57] listen it's time we square our shoulders
[51:59] back i don't care who it offends
[52:01] i'm not here to offend anybody or preach
[52:03] against that's not what i'm doing i'm
[52:04] just saying square your shoulders back
[52:05] and say not
[52:06] on my watch it's not going to happen on
[52:09] my watch that's some cold formal
[52:11] denominational spirit listen to
[52:12] nomination
[52:13] is it some church name somewhere with
[52:15] soup suppers on tuesday night and family
[52:17] no denomination is a spirit
[52:19] and it tries to come in and tries to rob
[52:21] the life out of a church and i say no
[52:24] no sir not today satan not in this
[52:26] church not in this bride
[52:28] not in this revival it's our time it's
[52:30] our time
[52:31] listen you ain't gonna take away the
[52:33] opportunity of my children
[52:35] to have a backside of the desert
[52:37] old-fashioned tongue-talking lick of
[52:39] fire
[52:40] whoa sound of the russian mighty wind
[52:42] baptism of the holy ghost
[52:44] my kids can have it too and i will fight
[52:46] for it i'll stand for it and i'll answer
[52:49] that bell
[52:49] all day every day
[52:51] [Applause]
[52:58] that's a devil i'm not calling no man or
[53:02] no minister of devil by no means
[53:04] but the spirit that wants to rob the
[53:07] experience out of a church
[53:09] brother branham called it antichrist
[53:11] then so it's antichrist
[53:13] now it hasn't changed
[53:18] look i'll fight for that
[53:21] look that unchurch ordered the
[53:23] leadership of the holy spirit right out
[53:24] of the services
[53:26] can't have no song written after 1957.
[53:32] i don't know why 57 i don't know because
[53:35] that was old
[53:38] every move of the spirit is labeled
[53:39] pentecostal
[53:41] person that that moves and gets excited
[53:44] and maybe they shout and dance and run
[53:46] and we're quick to wonder i wonder if
[53:47] they just got in the flesh
[53:48] i mean i wonder why are you wondering
[53:51] why do you care how about you just taste
[53:53] and see
[53:55] how about you taste it why am i worried
[53:56] about if they got in the flesh that's
[53:58] not my business
[53:59] that's not for me anyone i'm just
[54:01] thankful they're not sitting there
[54:02] dead i'm thankful they're not sitting
[54:04] there asleep i see a young person
[54:06] running around the bed i wish i'd ran
[54:08] around the building a few times when i
[54:09] was a young person
[54:10] i wish i'd have cared enough i wish i'd
[54:12] have been involved enough it blesses my
[54:14] heart
[54:14] every single time i never once i thought
[54:17] i wonder if they're in the
[54:19] what then you obviously are because you
[54:23] ain't caught up in the worship enough to
[54:24] even be where you're worried about who's
[54:26] running around who's worshiping who's
[54:28] doing this
[54:28] i say be free i say be free i say let
[54:31] the spirit move
[54:32] i say if he moves and tells you to run
[54:34] run if he tells you to shout shout
[54:37] just praise the lord praise the lord
[54:45] brother branham said here in the
[54:46] tabernacle we want you all
[54:48] to know these things here when god
[54:51] begins to pour out the holy spirit
[54:53] upon people now notice this is god
[54:57] pouring out the holy spirit when he
[54:59] begins to pour out the holy spirit upon
[55:01] people sometimes
[55:02] i know i've seen people get in the flesh
[55:05] when they were under the anointing of
[55:07] the spirit so notice it's not that the
[55:09] spirit's not on them
[55:11] it's not that the holy spirit didn't
[55:12] pour it out on them he said
[55:14] in other words i've seen them get so
[55:16] excited they didn't know how to contain
[55:17] themselves
[55:18] and they got in the flesh a little bit
[55:20] what's he going to say about that oh
[55:21] he's supposed to blast them
[55:23] they don't want god in the flesh oh
[55:24] they're probably never coming back to
[55:25] the tabernacle
[55:28] i've seen them get in the flesh when
[55:29] they were under the anointing of the
[55:30] spirit
[55:31] i've seen them go to extremes with
[55:33] things
[55:34] but don't you say nothing about it
[55:40] but don't you say nothing about it you
[55:43] respect it
[55:45] what you respect it
[55:49] bow your head you might not understand
[55:52] it
[55:53] neither would i but i want to respect it
[55:55] anyhow
[55:57] we must have respects to god and when
[55:59] god pours out the holy spirit i just say
[56:02] thank you heavenly father you have done
[56:06] something for that poor precious soul
[56:08] and they just want to go to your home
[56:10] like i do someday
[56:14] so if you got a problem with it the
[56:15] prophet gave you pretty basic
[56:17] instructions
[56:18] just bow your head and respect it
[56:24] i love that quote i woke lydia of the
[56:27] night 11 30
[56:28] listen to this look what i just found
[56:30] out you're going to like it
[56:32] just listen
[56:36] be careful what you criticize church
[56:42] be careful what you run down around your
[56:44] dinner table
[56:45] your child may have a gift of speaking
[56:48] in tongues or any other gift i'm not
[56:50] elevating that specific gift or playing
[56:51] music
[56:52] or being a singer but because they hear
[56:54] you constantly run down the movement of
[56:55] the spirit
[56:56] and run down being free in church they
[56:58] begin to cover that gift up and they
[56:59] develop a complex and that gift is never
[57:01] used for the glory of god
[57:03] and you will answer for it
[57:07] be careful what you run down
[57:11] the moving of the spirit is being
[57:12] challenged the experience of the holy
[57:15] ghost is being challenged
[57:16] our services are being challenged your
[57:18] healing is being challenged your
[57:20] victory's being challenged your
[57:21] deliverance your salvation
[57:22] it's all being challenged and i don't
[57:25] know maybe others have said around for
[57:26] 40 years
[57:27] or 40 weeks or 40 days or 40 hours or
[57:29] whatever it was
[57:30] and they sit there and listen to that
[57:32] and listen to that but i believe i'm
[57:33] looking at a people that say you know
[57:34] what i think i've heard just about
[57:35] enough
[57:36] i think i've heard enough of you running
[57:38] down things i'm telling our young people
[57:39] they can't have the holy ghost of
[57:41] telling me i can't be healed
[57:42] i've heard about enough of it and i'm
[57:45] here tonight to shut your mouth
[57:46] i'm here tonight to answer the challenge
[57:48] listen the problem was saul and his men
[57:50] listen too long
[57:51] they listen too long i'm not gonna
[57:53] listen for 40 days
[57:55] i'm not going to listen for 40 i'm not
[57:57] going to listen for one more minute
[57:59] to the lies of the enemy it is no
[58:01] edification to me it's nothing but lies
[58:04] and it's filled and i say tonight satan
[58:06] i will answer your challenge
[58:08] i'm not listening anymore to you
[58:10] spreading your lies and spreading your
[58:12] fear
[58:13] don't listen another minute listen
[58:15] they're your promises
[58:17] they're yours i believe listen there may
[58:20] be another generation that wouldn't
[58:21] accept it but i believe there's young
[58:22] people today saying that's mine right
[58:24] there
[58:24] i'll take that there's people sitting in
[58:26] this church tonight that say i won't be
[58:28] robbed of my opportunity at a revival
[58:30] i won't be robbed of my healing i won't
[58:33] be robbed of my deliverance
[58:34] if no one else will go i'm going in the
[58:36] valley tonight
[58:37] i'm going down there to meet that devil
[58:39] i'm going to meet that goliath
[58:41] i don't care you can all stay in your
[58:42] tent i'm going down there
[58:44] i'm going to shut him up once and for
[58:48] all
[58:54] in every age he's put forth this
[58:56] challenge
[58:58] in every age the enemy is boasted and in
[59:01] every age god has somebody that would
[59:03] arise to that
[59:04] challenge whether it was in the old
[59:06] testament
[59:07] whether it was down through the seven
[59:09] church ages the enemies always
[59:11] challenged the people of god
[59:13] and most of us were never going to face
[59:15] what they may have faced down through
[59:17] the dark ages
[59:19] different trials different times
[59:21] different people different anointings
[59:23] but we should never forget what those
[59:25] people went through for the sake of the
[59:26] gospel
[59:28] when the enemy roared his boats they
[59:29] stood
[59:31] facing torture they stood condemned to
[59:33] death
[59:34] they stood and they're watching today
[59:37] because they know that they without you
[59:38] can't be made perfect there's going
[59:39] somebody's got to answer the challenge
[59:41] we did it we stood we answered the
[59:43] challenge who down there is going to do
[59:44] it
[59:45] who's going to answer in this day
[59:47] they're counting on you tonight to face
[59:49] that challenge
[59:50] there were men and women burned alive
[59:52] young people who were not
[59:54] who would not recant even though they
[59:55] were tortured even though they were
[59:57] being killed how
[59:58] but then how how did they do it they
[1:00:00] were anointed
[1:00:02] for the age they were anointed for that
[1:00:04] challenge
[1:00:05] and they rose and they stood and they
[1:00:07] met the challenge of that day
[1:00:09] brother branham says but when you think
[1:00:10] of that little group whose members were
[1:00:12] sawn asunder
[1:00:13] fed the lines persecuted and driven from
[1:00:15] pillar to post
[1:00:16] and yet stayed true to the word now
[1:00:18] definitely that would have to be god
[1:00:21] how they survived their battle of faith
[1:00:23] and carried on still
[1:00:25] he says a few weeks ago i walked into
[1:00:27] the catacombs where old bones and skulls
[1:00:29] just about that much of them left where
[1:00:31] saints and martyrs died
[1:00:33] and i stood in the area where they fed
[1:00:34] them to lines and everything else
[1:00:36] and without batting an eye they went to
[1:00:38] death knowing this that they knew
[1:00:40] they knew him in the power of his
[1:00:42] resurrection that someday
[1:00:43] shaking from there they would come forth
[1:00:45] as the blood was
[1:00:47] saints of the living god oh church what
[1:00:50] a testimony and what about us
[1:00:51] what about the things we face i say we
[1:00:53] ought to be able to stand it's a shame
[1:00:55] if we can't stand
[1:00:56] it's time we stand because god has
[1:00:58] always got somebody
[1:00:59] to put his finger on i say lord here i
[1:01:01] am put your finger on me lord
[1:01:03] lead me guide me give me the courage i
[1:01:05] need to face what i have to face
[1:01:10] he says you know god always has a
[1:01:11] remnant of the people that's going to
[1:01:13] believe him somewhere
[1:01:14] he always has a remnant someone he can
[1:01:16] lay his hands on
[1:01:18] always has always will
[1:01:21] see every age had its challenge and yet
[1:01:24] in every age somebody stood
[1:01:26] and although we're not living in that
[1:01:27] type of physical persecution and
[1:01:29] although we're not under that ox
[1:01:30] anointing as it were
[1:01:32] that's where we physically have to lay
[1:01:34] our lives down the challenges that we
[1:01:36] face are no less real
[1:01:38] the challenges that we face and
[1:01:40] spiritually speaking they're no less
[1:01:42] difficult
[1:01:43] spiritually speaking this is one of the
[1:01:44] most challenging hours
[1:01:46] that man has ever known as a matter of
[1:01:49] fact
[1:01:50] you are facing the greatest challenge
[1:01:52] that believers have ever faced
[1:01:55] there has never been a more unbelieving
[1:01:57] age in the age that we live in right now
[1:02:00] churches around the world are dying and
[1:02:03] amongst those that do still have church
[1:02:04] doors open and those that still go to
[1:02:06] church there are very few
[1:02:07] that actually believe in the power of a
[1:02:09] supernatural god
[1:02:10] a god that'll heal and deliver and save
[1:02:12] and change your life
[1:02:14] there's very few that still believe
[1:02:15] those things no one has faced what this
[1:02:18] generation has to face
[1:02:20] when it relates to doubt and as it
[1:02:22] relates
[1:02:23] to fear because this is satan's eating
[1:02:27] it was the very first thing he did in
[1:02:28] the original even eating as he made them
[1:02:30] fear
[1:02:31] he brought fear and it broke that
[1:02:33] fellowship and once again how many times
[1:02:35] the people brother and i'm afraid
[1:02:37] fear fear fear fear
[1:02:41] fear it's a weapon of the enemy and this
[1:02:43] age is full of it it's infiltrated this
[1:02:45] age
[1:02:46] and it's also the age of unbelief
[1:02:48] brother branham said in 1964 unbelief is
[1:02:50] the most horrible thing there is in the
[1:02:52] world
[1:02:54] what unbelief he said if you can only
[1:02:57] take a spiritual looking glass and look
[1:02:59] into your soul
[1:03:00] you doubt and you find out what it looks
[1:03:03] like
[1:03:04] and the greatest devil the chief of
[1:03:07] all devils is unbelief
[1:03:10] the chief of all devils is unbelief
[1:03:14] the chief of all devils has infiltrated
[1:03:16] the age of laodicea
[1:03:18] he's done it in every avenue of our life
[1:03:20] he's infiltrated schools
[1:03:21] he infiltrated science he infiltrated
[1:03:24] entertainment he's infiltrated religion
[1:03:26] he's infiltrated and permeated
[1:03:28] everything
[1:03:29] that surrounds our life it's in the news
[1:03:32] listen church you must have the seal of
[1:03:34] god
[1:03:34] you must have the seal of god in order
[1:03:37] to stand and meet the challenge in this
[1:03:38] day
[1:03:39] i thank god there's been a message that
[1:03:41] was sent that turned our hearts back to
[1:03:42] the fathers that lifted
[1:03:44] up faith and allowed us to the faith of
[1:03:46] the father to allowed us to stand
[1:03:47] that has allowed us to meet the
[1:03:49] challenge without this message
[1:03:51] there would be no one to rise to the
[1:03:53] challenge of the age
[1:03:54] without this message listen we should
[1:03:56] cherish it we should feed on it we
[1:03:58] should read it we should listen to it we
[1:04:00] should take
[1:04:00] part of it god went through great
[1:04:02] trouble and he did extraordinary things
[1:04:04] to make sure
[1:04:05] you had a message that would deliver a
[1:04:07] message that would allow you to meet the
[1:04:09] challenge of the day
[1:04:11] because satan has taken 6 000 years
[1:04:15] since the fall of man to study you
[1:04:18] to find every weakness every temptation
[1:04:21] that would catch a man's eye
[1:04:23] every temptation that would attract a
[1:04:24] woman every vice and every temptation
[1:04:27] that would appease the flesh
[1:04:28] and he's figured them all out he's
[1:04:30] figured them all out exactly he's put it
[1:04:32] all right here in the closing of time
[1:04:35] and then he created a society where
[1:04:37] those things are now looked upon as
[1:04:39] being okay
[1:04:41] as looked upon as being good
[1:04:44] listen i've said it before there's the
[1:04:46] evil has always been here
[1:04:48] homosexuality has always been around and
[1:04:51] sex sins and evil and all these
[1:04:52] that's always existed but the difference
[1:04:55] is even going back to when i was a kid
[1:04:57] those things were done in the haunts and
[1:04:58] the shadows and in the dregs of society
[1:05:01] those things weren't done out in the
[1:05:02] public but now it's become mainstream
[1:05:05] and you're the oddball if you're against
[1:05:07] it
[1:05:07] you're weird if you think something's
[1:05:08] wrong with it it's come right out in
[1:05:10] your face
[1:05:12] and that john has walked right out in
[1:05:13] the valley right before you and said
[1:05:15] is there anybody that'll stand against
[1:05:17] me is there anybody that can call right
[1:05:20] right and wrong wrong
[1:05:21] and he's walking right in front of you
[1:05:23] and in front of your children
[1:05:25] and he's challenging them saying can any
[1:05:26] of you stand can any of you resist the
[1:05:28] temptations
[1:05:29] and the filth of this world i say yes i
[1:05:32] say there's a people that can stand i
[1:05:33] say there's a people that will accept
[1:05:35] the challenge
[1:05:36] i'm not going to bend i'm not going to
[1:05:37] bow i'm not going to back up
[1:05:39] keep the fire seven times harder o king
[1:05:42] but we will not
[1:05:43] bow down we will not give in
[1:05:46] it is the most evil age
[1:05:50] and the enemy is making his boast that's
[1:05:52] right
[1:05:53] he's come out and openly declared war on
[1:05:55] you
[1:05:59] first samuel 17 10 and the philistines
[1:06:01] said i defy
[1:06:03] the armies of israel this day give me a
[1:06:07] man
[1:06:07] that we may fight together when saul and
[1:06:10] all israel heard those words of the
[1:06:12] philistine
[1:06:13] they were dismayed and greatly afraid
[1:06:17] and he boasts i have created an eden
[1:06:19] that crushes faith
[1:06:22] 200 million demons released from the
[1:06:24] river euphrates
[1:06:26] and they have one target you
[1:06:31] and he boasts you will not rapture
[1:06:34] you will not overcome i have torn down
[1:06:37] the traditional family structures in
[1:06:39] this last day
[1:06:40] i have replaced prayer time with social
[1:06:43] media time
[1:06:44] i have come in and made everything else
[1:06:46] of great importance
[1:06:48] and he boasts anxiety disorders are the
[1:06:51] most common mental illness in the united
[1:06:53] states
[1:06:53] affecting 40 million adults in the
[1:06:56] united states 18 and older
[1:06:59] 17.3 million americans yearly struggle
[1:07:01] with depression
[1:07:03] and he boasts one person every 40
[1:07:06] seconds will commit suicide
[1:07:08] and he boasts it is the second leading
[1:07:11] cause of death among teenagers
[1:07:14] and he boasts the u.s has 13
[1:07:17] million single parent homes
[1:07:21] 35 percent of downloads from the

[1:07:40] are women and he boasts
[1:07:46] one in every five mobile phone searches
[1:07:48] is for pornography
[1:07:51] my kid don't deal with it you better
[1:07:54] wake up
[1:07:58] you better be real with yourself not be
[1:08:01] afraid to meet the challenge not be
[1:08:02] afraid to deal with things that's coming
[1:08:04] in the home
[1:08:06] listen i don't know how to word this
[1:08:08] exactly
[1:08:11] it ain't a shame for young people to
[1:08:12] struggle with things it's a shame that
[1:08:13] won't nobody stand up and try to help
[1:08:15] them
[1:08:17] it's a shame that people won't go to war
[1:08:18] for them it's a shame people won't fight
[1:08:20] for them instead they'd rather go i
[1:08:22] was a good boy
[1:08:25] i agree with you i believe your boy is
[1:08:27] the son of god but i believe right now
[1:08:28] he needs deliverance and the baptism of
[1:08:30] the holy ghost
[1:08:31] and i believe parents need to step up
[1:08:32] and accept the challenge and go to war
[1:08:34] form and go to prayer for them and not
[1:08:35] be afraid to fight how many times we
[1:08:37] have kids come up needing deliverance
[1:08:39] and they'll be sitting there at the
[1:08:40] altar and mom and dad don't ever even
[1:08:42] show up
[1:08:45] might embarrass my boy if i go up there
[1:08:49] let me tell you what to be real
[1:08:51] embarrassing when he turns and looks at
[1:08:53] you on the day of judgment says why

[1:10:25] before me tonight
[1:10:27] i don't care how evil the world is there

[1:10:31] without spot or wrinkle that's thus
[1:10:34] saith the lord
[1:10:37] somebody's gonna rise to the challenge
[1:10:39] because somebody's gonna fulfill that
[1:10:42] scripture
[1:10:49] by the way 71 percent of teens admit to
[1:10:51] hiding
[1:10:52] all their online behavior from their
[1:10:54] parents
[1:10:55] let me tell y'all something that you
[1:10:58] don't like to hear
[1:10:59] when it comes to these things your kid
[1:11:01] is smarter than you
[1:11:05] sorry they are
[1:11:09] let me tell you what we got every
[1:11:10] firewall and every block you can imagine
[1:11:12] on computers at school
[1:11:13] and i bet once a week some kids getting
[1:11:15] in trouble because they don't got around
[1:11:16] it and looking at things they ain't
[1:11:17] supposed to
[1:11:18] i'm talking about stuff it would take a
[1:11:19] hacker to do and that sixth grader who
[1:11:21] can't pass english
[1:11:22] is in there
[1:11:30] you got to guard the door you got to
[1:11:32] apply the token
[1:11:33] list don't nothing come through that
[1:11:34] door that you ain't aware of that you
[1:11:36] don't know about listen we're not
[1:11:37] perfect there's going to be times that
[1:11:38] things come to your attention it's in
[1:11:40] your home that make you go
[1:11:41] what it's going to happen
[1:11:45] but don't let it become so common that
[1:11:46] you've become used to it being in your
[1:11:48] home
[1:11:49] it should shock you and appall you and
[1:11:51] make you go to war
[1:11:53] should make you go to battle make you
[1:11:54] draw your sword
[1:11:58] and he boasts and he does this day
[1:12:01] after day after day chapter 17 verse 16
[1:12:06] and the philistine drew near morning
[1:12:08] and evening and presented himself 40
[1:12:12] days and the challenge goes forth who
[1:12:15] will stand in satan's eden
[1:12:18] send me a man send me a woman
[1:12:21] send me a young person send me an old
[1:12:23] person send me someone
[1:12:25] is there no one who will stand and fight
[1:12:29] listen if you think you're just going to
[1:12:31] sit around in your tent while goliath
[1:12:32] marches back and forth through your
[1:12:34] promises and over your valleys and
[1:12:35] through your heels and robs your joy and
[1:12:37] rob your victory and you just peek it
[1:12:39] out the tent
[1:12:39] and you're just going to stay there to
[1:12:40] wrap your day and then you're going in a
[1:12:42] rapture that's not how it works
[1:12:44] all right those people ain't going to
[1:12:45] know the rapture happened because their
[1:12:46] tents closed up they're not even going
[1:12:48] to know i'm gone
[1:12:49] they're not even gonna know the battle's
[1:12:50] been happening in the valley you've
[1:12:51] gotta come out of the tent
[1:12:52] you gotta have victory you gotta
[1:12:54] overcome those things that are
[1:12:55] tormenting you
[1:12:56] you were put here to win you were put
[1:13:00] here to fight
[1:13:01] this isn't about having a better
[1:13:03] doctrine than other people and having a
[1:13:04] better lifestyle than other people
[1:13:06] it's about overcoming every single devil
[1:13:08] in hell
[1:13:09] it's about being victorious it's about
[1:13:11] being the bride of jesus christ and the
[1:13:14] bride of jesus christ is not afraid to
[1:13:16] fight
[1:13:17] [Applause]
[1:13:24] well i believe the message brother aaron
[1:13:26] i know god sent a prophet i had an
[1:13:28] experience back in 78.
[1:13:31] awesome i'm glad you did
[1:13:34] you had one this week have you been in
[1:13:37] the presence of god lately
[1:13:39] have you made your call in an election
[1:13:41] sure have you see have you been seeking
[1:13:43] that refilling have you been seeking to
[1:13:44] walk daily in his presence
[1:13:47] because that's the only way you're going
[1:13:48] to be able to fight it's the only way
[1:13:49] you're going to be able to stand
[1:13:51] look where are the soldiers
[1:13:54] where are the anointed ones i say it's
[1:13:57] time that we begin to prophesy to the
[1:13:59] devil like david did
[1:14:01] on this day no i'm not going to deal
[1:14:05] with it tomorrow but david began to
[1:14:06] prophesy and then he walked into the
[1:14:08] prophecy that he prophesied
[1:14:10] he said this day will the lord deliver
[1:14:12] thee into my hand and i will smite thee
[1:14:15] and take thy head from thee now notice
[1:14:16] he didn't just stop there
[1:14:18] he didn't just promise to speed goliath
[1:14:20] carcass he says and i will
[1:14:22] give the carcasses of the host of the
[1:14:25] philistines
[1:14:26] this day unto the fowls of the air and
[1:14:29] to the wild beasts of the earth
[1:14:30] that all the earth may know that there
[1:14:33] is
[1:14:33] a god in israel we like to talk about a
[1:14:36] living god but somebody's going to
[1:14:38] display into the world
[1:14:39] somebody's going to say on this day i'm
[1:14:41] overcoming on this day i'm casting down
[1:14:43] depression
[1:14:44] on this day i overcome those sins that
[1:14:46] have so easily beset me
[1:14:47] that the whole world may know there is a
[1:14:49] living god an evening like tabernacle
[1:14:52] there is an evening there is a living
[1:14:54] god in tennessee
[1:14:55] a living god in virginia a living god in
[1:14:57] connecticut a living god in texas
[1:14:59] it's not an evening like tabernacle
[1:15:01] revival it's the bride's revival
[1:15:04] all over the world he's getting abroad
[1:15:06] ready to go
[1:15:08] hallelujah
[1:15:15] this message came in power and
[1:15:18] demonstration
[1:15:21] night after night the devil challenged
[1:15:24] and night after night he was defeated
[1:15:27] it showed that satan is powerless before
[1:15:30] a son and daughter of god
[1:15:33] listen this message met the challenge
[1:15:35] this message will meet the challenge
[1:15:37] this message is power this message is
[1:15:40] deliverance
[1:15:43] i don't know i said devil you showed up
[1:15:46] in the wrong valley tonight
[1:15:48] you showed up at the wrong church
[1:15:50] service tonight
[1:15:51] because there's a different set of ears
[1:15:53] in the camp tonight these years have
[1:15:55] heard the word of the lord
[1:15:57] these ears have heard that they will
[1:15:58] possess the gate of their enemy
[1:16:00] these ears have heard that this is how
[1:16:03] you overcome
[1:16:04] these ears have heard that they will
[1:16:06] take a rapture these years have heard
[1:16:08] that we will not go down in defeat
[1:16:10] we have heard that the word of god will
[1:16:12] defeat the enemy
[1:16:13] any place anywhere anytime under any
[1:16:16] circumstances
[1:16:17] you showed up at the wrong place tonight
[1:16:20] there's got to be somebody to say
[1:16:22] on this day i will take your head off
[1:16:27] this challenge to my health it will not
[1:16:30] go unanswered
[1:16:31] this challenge to my deliverance it will
[1:16:33] not go on answer
[1:16:34] this challenge to my salvation it will
[1:16:37] not
[1:16:37] go unanswered
[1:16:41] goliath has shown up so now we fight
[1:16:46] you can't let the challenge go on
[1:16:47] answering listen there's deliverance
[1:16:50] for everybody
[1:16:53] not just for young people
[1:16:57] i'm not picking on anybody but it seems
[1:16:58] like most of the time when somebody
[1:16:59] comes up for deliverance it's young
[1:17:00] people
[1:17:01] it's always young people no people just
[1:17:02] sit back there
[1:17:06] y'all don't have any battles i don't i
[1:17:07] mean
[1:17:09] i'm not trying to encourage everybody to
[1:17:11] run up for prayer that's not what this
[1:17:12] is about
[1:17:13] i'm just saying deliverance is for
[1:17:15] everybody not just for the listen
[1:17:18] some old folks you know i'll count
[1:17:21] myself there
[1:17:22] i messed up before with the whole age
[1:17:24] thing look you've had your victory
[1:17:26] stolen
[1:17:28] for so long you forgot it was gone
[1:17:32] you don't know any other way than the
[1:17:34] way you are right now
[1:17:38] some of y'all never got delivered when
[1:17:40] you was young
[1:17:41] and so now guess what young person
[1:17:44] problems
[1:17:46] young man problems become grown man
[1:17:48] problems
[1:17:51] young girl problems become grown woman
[1:17:53] problems
[1:17:55] there's no such thing as well i just
[1:17:56] grew up so that devil went away
[1:17:59] oh you gotta have deliverance listen
[1:18:01] i'll tell some of the young people right
[1:18:02] now
[1:18:03] if you don't get delivered of that
[1:18:04] pornographic or that lust spirit it'll
[1:18:06] follow right you into your marriage and
[1:18:07] it'll ruin your marriage
[1:18:09] it'll destroy your home that lust that
[1:18:12] follows families if you don't get it
[1:18:14] dealt with right now to follow you all
[1:18:15] it don't go away because you're 60.
[1:18:18] and just because you get married doesn't
[1:18:20] mean all of a sudden that thing goes
[1:18:21] away
[1:18:21] it'll ruin you it's time to get
[1:18:24] deliverance no matter who you are it's
[1:18:26] time to get deliverance no matter what
[1:18:27] age you are
[1:18:28] it's too late to play church it's too
[1:18:29] late to have pride it's too late to go
[1:18:31] up it's too late but i can't go tell
[1:18:33] them i'm going through that sure you can
[1:18:34] like i said earlier there's no shame and
[1:18:36] having lost the battle the shame is
[1:18:38] sitting there in your in your defeat
[1:18:39] the shame is when there's deliverance
[1:18:40] here and the water's troubled and your
[1:18:42] pride gets in the way of the eternal
[1:18:44] destination
[1:18:45] of your soul i'm telling you it's time
[1:18:47] to meet the challenge tonight

[1:19:23] just had an experience with god
[1:19:28] the lord's been really moving in our
[1:19:29] young people it stirs my soul to see
[1:19:31] what he's been doing
[1:19:35] i mean if you just started your walk
[1:19:37] goliath's going to show up
[1:19:39] and he's going to tell you it was
[1:19:40] nothing he's going to tell you it was
[1:19:43] just emotion
[1:19:44] he's going to he's going to tell you
[1:19:46] that nothing has really happened in your
[1:19:47] life and if you sit there and you allow
[1:19:49] him to talk
[1:19:50] and you begin to listen to him and you
[1:19:52] begin to reason it out he's going to
[1:19:53] begin to shake you
[1:19:56] he'll begin to make you wonder did that
[1:19:58] really happen
[1:19:59] listen don't give him time to make his
[1:20:02] boast
[1:20:03] when he begins to talk you stand your
[1:20:05] ground and you meet him with the word

[1:20:14] of those things
[1:20:15] you know the deliverance that you
[1:20:16] received was real
[1:20:18] but you're going to have to be willing
[1:20:19] to fight to keep it because he's going
[1:20:21] to come back and tell you that you
[1:20:22] didn't
[1:20:23] the fight to get free is only the
[1:20:25] beginning now you got to fight to keep

[1:21:04] samuel 17 23
[1:21:06] and as he talked with them behold there
[1:21:08] came up the champion the philistine of
[1:21:10] gath
[1:21:10] goliath by name out of the armies
[1:21:14] out of the armies of the philistines and
[1:21:16] spake according to the same words
[1:21:18] and david heard them i've always loved
[1:21:21] this i love how brother branham talked
[1:21:23] about a new set of ears
[1:21:24] he said there was a new set of ears in
[1:21:26] the camp and that set of ears tonight
[1:21:28] belongs to anointed people
[1:21:30] that set of ears tonight belong to
[1:21:32] people that have seen god move
[1:21:34] listen we're not some dead group of
[1:21:36] people that don't know what it's like to
[1:21:37] see the power of the supernatural god
[1:21:39] working
[1:21:40] these people here have seen the bearer
[1:21:42] of cancer raise up and they have seen it
[1:21:44] come down
[1:21:45] these people here have seen the line of
[1:21:46] suicide raise up and they have seen that
[1:21:49] line be slain
[1:21:50] they have seen that giant of lust raise
[1:21:52] up and try to take our young people
[1:21:54] and they have seen the head of that
[1:21:56] giant come off
[1:21:57] satan let me give you fair warning
[1:21:59] tonight this is not just some other
[1:22:00] denominational group
[1:22:02] this is not just some man-made move of
[1:22:04] god these are god's people
[1:22:06] this is god's bride this is a people
[1:22:08] ordained of people anointed
[1:22:10] oh i don't feel anointed brother and
[1:22:12] that's okay i promise you when david
[1:22:14] walked out there there wasn't still
[1:22:15] anointing oil dripping off running down
[1:22:17] his neck it had happened a long time ago
[1:22:19] but he knew he knew his experience was
[1:22:22] real he was there when the anointing
[1:22:24] happened
[1:22:24] and he stepped out and tonight satan
[1:22:27] you've picked the wrong group of people
[1:22:28] to torment
[1:22:29] it's time that we torment the tormentor
[1:22:32] it's time that we

[1:23:29] is saul and his men had forgotten who
[1:23:31] they were
[1:23:33] it says in 171 now the philistines
[1:23:35] gathered together their armies to battle
[1:23:36] and were gathered together at shoka
[1:23:39] which belonged to judah
[1:23:43] this was theirs it was their possession
[1:23:49] but sometimes we forget well i have
[1:23:52] every right every redemptive promise is
[1:23:53] mine
[1:23:54] that's my promise we we have amnesia and
[1:23:57] the devil's walking all over something
[1:23:59] that belongs to us and we're just
[1:24:00] standing up there taking it
[1:24:01] and saul forgot what he was called to
[1:24:03] the men forgot what they were called to
[1:24:05] be
[1:24:06] that that philistine was in their land
[1:24:08] on their promise and they forgotten that
[1:24:10] they were god's people called for this
[1:24:12] very purpose
[1:24:12] to drive the enemy out of the promised
[1:24:15] land to drive the enemy off their land

[1:24:21] land off of your promises

[1:24:25] listen at calvary the price was paid
[1:24:27] you owe the devil nothing you owe him
[1:24:31] nothing he has no rights to your health
[1:24:33] he has no right to your mind he has no
[1:24:35] right to your family he has
[1:24:37] no rights he has no rights to put those
[1:24:40] complexes on you
[1:24:41] that are literally sucking the very life
[1:24:43] out of you
[1:24:44] that complex came from the enemy and he
[1:24:46] has no right to put that on you
[1:24:49] robbing you of your joy that god intends
[1:24:51] for you to live and we're not to walk
[1:24:53] around depressed and beat down
[1:24:55] the joy of the lord is our strength
[1:24:58] he batters against you and he brings
[1:25:00] self-esteem issues
[1:25:01] he brings feelings of worthlessness
[1:25:03] feelings of guilt oh why didn't i do
[1:25:05] things differently
[1:25:06] i say meet him in the valley tonight and
[1:25:08] shut his mouth
[1:25:09] i'm not gonna let the devil torment me

[1:25:16] with him standing in my property
[1:25:18] in my yard on my promises and let him
[1:25:21] run his mouth and torment me

[1:25:30] for what brother and why am i
[1:25:32] pronouncing to meet the challenge
[1:25:34] to meet the enemy look you need to
[1:25:37] remind the devil tonight
[1:25:39] that he needed the lord jesus needed
[1:25:41] somebody to overcome
[1:25:43] and he chose you
[1:25:46] you're not very important really because
[1:25:48] god decided that i must be the
[1:25:50] i'm the best because he put me in the
[1:25:52] last age the final voice to the final
[1:25:54] age and guess what he chose you
[1:25:57] he chose you god needed somebody to
[1:26:00] rapture who'd he choose
[1:26:01] woohoo he chose you
[1:26:05] and we're gonna let the devil tell us
[1:26:06] we're not worth very much we're not very
[1:26:08] good we're not
[1:26:09] listen god chose the best of the best of
[1:26:12] the best and he put him here in this
[1:26:13] last age and i know you're having a hard
[1:26:15] time doing we're not supposed to build
[1:26:16] ourselves up we're not
[1:26:17] god did he told you you were called he
[1:26:20] told you you were chosen
[1:26:21] he told you he was you were his bride he
[1:26:23] said it he said it it's his word
[1:26:26] and if he says i can be the bride i'm
[1:26:28] not going to argue with him i'm just
[1:26:29] going to say yes lord
[1:26:31] i accept it i'll take what you've given
[1:26:33] me i accept the calling i accept the
[1:26:35] challenge

[1:26:40] i accept all that you have for me lord
[1:26:43] he chose you brother brown says look i
[1:26:47] want you to notice
[1:26:48] he does it that way in every age he does
[1:26:50] it every time by the same method
[1:26:52] he has to take believers and then in
[1:26:55] order to have the believers to meet that
[1:26:57] word
[1:26:58] he's got to predestinate it to that age
[1:27:01] you see it
[1:27:02] he's got to predestinate this thing to
[1:27:04] be there to meet the challenge of the
[1:27:06] age
[1:27:07] did you get it did you feel it did you
[1:27:09] see it do you
[1:27:10] understand it that's what's happening
[1:27:12] today he prayed predestinated it to this
[1:27:15] by his foreknowledge when he
[1:27:17] predestinated malachi 4
[1:27:19] it's got to happen when he come over and
[1:27:21] predestined anything to happen in his
[1:27:23] word
[1:27:23] he had to prove his word to be so when
[1:27:26] he predestinates
[1:27:27] anything to happen and says it will
[1:27:29] happen he knows
[1:27:30] that seed will be there just at that
[1:27:33] time
[1:27:34] he predestinated abroad she's going to
[1:27:37] be there
[1:27:38] going to be a rapture she's going to be
[1:27:41] there he predestinates it
[1:27:42] by his foreknowledge see there's nothing
[1:27:45] going to stop it
[1:27:47] now where's that uncircumcised devil at
[1:27:50] where's those lies that now he's been
[1:27:52] telling you he predestinated you
[1:27:54] to be here to meet the challenge and the
[1:27:56] prophet of god said there
[1:27:58] is nothing going to stop it absolutely
[1:28:02] nothing that devil's been telling me i'm
[1:28:03] not going to make it
[1:28:05] does he not realize that the very reason
[1:28:07] i exist is to make it
[1:28:09] the very reason i breathe air that very
[1:28:13] reason i was put on this earth
[1:28:14] i was put here by almighty god to make
[1:28:18] it
[1:28:19] brother aaron am i gonna make it that's
[1:28:21] why you're here
[1:28:22] you're gonna make it you are gonna make
[1:28:25] it
[1:28:26] that's why he's put you here
[1:28:33] this isn't some in general thing
[1:28:37] this isn't well we're going to overcome
[1:28:39] the challenge of the age
[1:28:41] well we're going to defeat goliath
[1:28:44] no it's got to be you
[1:28:49] you got to be ready because you're going
[1:28:52] to face
[1:28:52] your goliath and you're going to have
[1:28:54] your challenges and your giants
[1:28:59] you are going to be the one that has to
[1:29:00] face it you're going to face the enemy
[1:29:04] but listen you can rest assured that
[1:29:05] when you do if you do it standing on the
[1:29:07] word you will be victorious
[1:29:09] you will win brother brown said many
[1:29:11] times i've been challenged all over the
[1:29:13] world and he has backed me up
[1:29:15] and met the challenge every time
[1:29:18] and you got to have that same assurance
[1:29:20] that you know that you know that when
[1:29:22] you meet the enemy
[1:29:23] he's going to back you up every single
[1:29:25] time because let me tell you church
[1:29:28] you don't know when goliath is going to
[1:29:29] show up
[1:29:33] you don't know thinking things can be
[1:29:35] going pretty well
[1:29:37] and the next thing you know you're
[1:29:38] staring at a giant
[1:29:40] it's never going to be when you expect
[1:29:42] it
[1:29:44] it's never going to be when you've
[1:29:45] planned for it look what the scriptures
[1:29:47] say about david
[1:29:48] in verse 17 and jesse said unto david
[1:29:51] his son take now
[1:29:52] for thy brethren and ephi of this
[1:29:54] parched corn and these ten loaves and
[1:29:55] run to the camp to thy brethren
[1:29:57] and carry these ten cheeses under the
[1:29:59] captain of their thousand
[1:30:00] and look how thy brethren fair and take
[1:30:03] their pledge
[1:30:05] david's just going grocery shopping
[1:30:10] he's just on he taking some cheese
[1:30:14] he did not wake up that morning and go
[1:30:15] today's the day
[1:30:18] going to kill goliath now he's like i
[1:30:19] gotta kick this cheese and this bread
[1:30:22] i got delivered there boy i'm just a
[1:30:23] little errand boy
[1:30:25] how many times i gotta wash these dishes
[1:30:29] i gotta fold this laundry i gotta go to
[1:30:31] work it's just another day
[1:30:33] i'm tired of teaching middle schoolers
[1:30:34] they're really getting on my nerves
[1:30:39] it's just another day it's just another
[1:30:42] day of laundry
[1:30:43] it's just another day of mowing the
[1:30:44] grass
[1:30:46] and goliath shows up all right
[1:30:51] well you're telling brother aaron you
[1:30:52] better be ready
[1:30:54] that's not the time to get prayed up
[1:30:56] brother brandon would talk about shamgar
[1:30:58] he didn't have time to learn how to
[1:30:59] fight
[1:31:00] he didn't have time he just got enough
[1:31:03] he just had enough he just got tired of
[1:31:06] dealing with it
[1:31:06] he got tired of being robbed he got
[1:31:08] tired of the enemy trespassing
[1:31:10] he got tired and one day they showed up
[1:31:12] it was just another day it was just
[1:31:12] tuesday
[1:31:13] and they showed up our problem is they
[1:31:16] only brought 600.
[1:31:20] listen i know we say it a lot it's one
[1:31:21] of my favorite things the devil ain't
[1:31:23] got enough
[1:31:24] if he'd had enough he'd have sent enough
[1:31:26] but he sent 600 and guess what it wasn't
[1:31:28] enough
[1:31:28] goliath wasn't enough the lion's den
[1:31:30] wasn't enough the red sea wasn't enough
[1:31:31] and whatever he sent
[1:31:32] in your life tonight let me tell you it
[1:31:34] is not enough
[1:31:36] he does not have enough because me and
[1:31:39] god
[1:31:40] is a majority you and god
[1:31:43] is a majority there's more for us
[1:31:46] than there is against us but there's 200
[1:31:49] million million
[1:31:50] i don't care it ain't enough to stop the
[1:31:53] bride
[1:31:54] of jesus christ from going in this
[1:31:56] rapture
[1:31:58] he don't have enough
[1:32:05] but goliath wasn't enough even though it
[1:32:07] was just a grocery run
[1:32:09] it wasn't in some powerful youth camp it
[1:32:12] wasn't in some powerful service he was
[1:32:14] taking bread and cheese to his brethren
[1:32:18] but we never get to choose when our
[1:32:19] battle comes
[1:32:22] we never get to choose when it's our
[1:32:23] turn but you're gonna have a turn
[1:32:28] you can't just go along look in the part
[1:32:31] act in the part
[1:32:32] play in the part and think you're gonna
[1:32:34] make it because there comes a day
[1:32:36] when looking the part playing the part
[1:32:38] acting apart ain't gonna stand up to
[1:32:39] goliath
[1:32:43] there's a reason saul couldn't face
[1:32:46] because his experience wasn't up to date
[1:32:51] if you're having a hard time facing your
[1:32:52] giants where's your experience at
[1:32:56] david could walk out there in confidence
[1:32:58] he didn't bat an eye
[1:33:00] because he had experience upon
[1:33:02] experience upon experience and it was
[1:33:04] fresh it was a fresh experience
[1:33:07] can't play the part can't just act the
[1:33:09] part saul had the army looking good
[1:33:11] if you looked out there you said that's
[1:33:12] a tough army really they ain't come out
[1:33:14] of their tents
[1:33:15] in 40 days because they're scared of one
[1:33:16] guy
[1:33:19] but he had them looking good their armor
[1:33:21] was shined up they knew all the restored
[1:33:24] doctrines
[1:33:24] they knew all the message terminology
[1:33:27] they knew all the buzzwords
[1:33:28] they had eagle belt buckles and 270s
[1:33:30] galore
[1:33:33] but not enough faith to pray for a
[1:33:34] toothache
[1:33:36] not enough faith to stand there when
[1:33:38] they're challenged and called out
[1:33:41] get to the point where the only thing
[1:33:42] that the ministry becomes in some places
[1:33:44] is to bash
[1:33:44] other ministries saul
[1:33:48] you need to repent because there's a
[1:33:51] reason that your
[1:33:52] church your army is still stuck in the
[1:33:54] tent and they hadn't went down
[1:33:56] it took somebody from somewhere else
[1:33:59] that had an up-to-date experience
[1:34:00] to come in and show them how it was done
[1:34:03] are you talking about from i'm not
[1:34:05] talking about nothing
[1:34:06] i'm saying if your experience is up to
[1:34:08] date you can face the enemy
[1:34:10] that's what i'm saying
[1:34:13] saul had them knowing the doctrines but
[1:34:16] one day goliath walked out
[1:34:18] look you can watch others all you want
[1:34:20] go through things
[1:34:22] you can say all the right things we can
[1:34:23] have faith for others we can say i'm
[1:34:25] praying for you
[1:34:26] i'm sorry this is going on everything's
[1:34:28] going to be okay
[1:34:29] and you understand they're going through
[1:34:31] a battle
[1:34:33] but brother when it's you facing the
[1:34:35] devil
[1:34:36] when it's your turn all those little
[1:34:38] cute sayings and things don't really
[1:34:40] mean a whole lot
[1:34:42] it does coming from other people i'm
[1:34:43] talking about your lips you better know
[1:34:45] the word
[1:34:46] you better be ready to stand for the
[1:34:48] word you better be ready to fight
[1:34:49] because when it's your turn and you are
[1:34:51] the one that has to walk down into the
[1:34:53] valley
[1:34:54] then where are you gonna be then what
[1:34:56] are you gonna do
[1:34:58] you better go back to the word that's
[1:34:59] what david did he went back to the word
[1:35:02] he came to him in the word what does the
[1:35:04] word say tonight by his stripes i'm
[1:35:06] healed
[1:35:06] you can have perfect peace love casteth
[1:35:08] out fear i can have the holy ghost
[1:35:10] i will overcome meet him right there in
[1:35:13] that moment
[1:35:14] with that word do it day one don't let
[1:35:17] him talk listen
[1:35:18] day one was the best opportunity that
[1:35:21] all them men had there to kill goliath
[1:35:23] if they would have went out on day one
[1:35:26] there were thousands of men there that
[1:35:27] had the opportunity to be the champion
[1:35:29] of israel
[1:35:31] they were given every opportunity and of
[1:35:33] all those thousands there there's very
[1:35:35] few of them who you know their name
[1:35:37] because men of courage leave legacies
[1:35:40] men of courage leave behind a legacy and
[1:35:43] they left behind nothing
[1:35:44] but an army that was scared to face the
[1:35:46] enemy that's what we know of them
[1:35:49] day one was their best opportunity the
[1:35:51] very first time he made his challenge
[1:35:53] every one of them there were seat of
[1:35:55] abraham all of them called
[1:35:57] all of them chosen to possess the land
[1:35:59] and yet fear
[1:36:00] gripped them i believe that any man in
[1:36:03] that army
[1:36:03] if they would accepted the challenge and
[1:36:05] went out there to fight and met the
[1:36:06] goliath in the name of the lord the same
[1:36:08] way that david did they would have been
[1:36:10] victorious
[1:36:12] but they had listened so long to the lie
[1:36:14] of the devil that they began to believe
[1:36:16] his lies oh i'm not going to make it
[1:36:21] oh i'm not good enough i am just a
[1:36:23] nobody
[1:36:24] oh i'm just a new christian but there
[1:36:27] and you don't understand i'm just a new
[1:36:28] christian listen david had been in the
[1:36:30] army five minutes
[1:36:32] he was as new a recruit as you could
[1:36:34] possibly be
[1:36:36] green and he went and killed goliath
[1:36:41] it's not about how long you've been here
[1:36:43] it's not listen if you just gave your
[1:36:45] heart to the lord
[1:36:46] while ago while i was preaching then you
[1:36:48] have the authority and the power
[1:36:50] to face any devil of hell and overcome
[1:36:52] him right now
[1:36:53] you can face any enemy you can face him
[1:36:55] and stand on the word of god and you
[1:36:57] will win
[1:36:58] church what am i telling you tonight go
[1:36:59] out and face the enemy meet the
[1:37:01] challenge
[1:37:02] you will be victorious but as long as
[1:37:04] you stand back in fear
[1:37:05] as long as you stand at the tent as long
[1:37:07] as you're willing to let the devil come
[1:37:09] and disrupt your home
[1:37:10] and come in and bring sickness and fear
[1:37:12] and unbelief you will not live in
[1:37:14] victory
[1:37:15] you will continue to live in the torment
[1:37:17] of the enemy saying you can't
[1:37:18] you can't you can't even like tabernacle
[1:37:21] you can
[1:37:22] you can because he did he's already won
[1:37:25] that victory for you
[1:37:28] he's trying to keep you in your tent
[1:37:29] tonight but i say goliath has shown up
[1:37:32] and now we must fight
[1:37:39] listen to bring this down to a close
[1:37:40] right now
[1:37:47] church tonight you are the winner
[1:37:51] listen to me you are the winner you
[1:37:54] are the army of the living god and you
[1:37:58] can not lose listen you must accept the
[1:38:02] challenge because you are the only ones
[1:38:03] who can
[1:38:04] accept the challenge because you hold
[1:38:07] the promise
[1:38:08] oh brother aaron but i can't yes yes you
[1:38:11] can
[1:38:12] the prophet of god says the hour is
[1:38:13] close at hand they don't need to do
[1:38:15] anything else but go to work
[1:38:17] give them material whatever is in their
[1:38:19] hand some might sing some might preach

[1:40:58] snarl and try to bring fears because
[1:41:00] they're about to come out
[1:41:01] it's because their head's about to come
[1:41:02] off and the goliath begins to boast and

[1:42:16] children of israel that had been too
[1:42:18] afraid to come into the valley on their
[1:42:19] own

[1:42:24] to face that anxiety
[1:42:26] too afraid that they were going to be
[1:42:27] struck down with lust the rest of their
[1:42:29] life
[1:42:29] too afraid they couldn't receive the
[1:42:31] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:42:33] and he turned around and he showed the
[1:42:35] entire congregation
[1:42:36] and he said if i can do it brothers and
[1:42:40] sisters if i can do it
[1:42:41] if i can overcome my fear if i can
