[32:30] Lord blessed be the name of the
[32:34] Lord
[32:35] hallelujah Glory Luke 1 and verse 26
[32:39] reads like this and in the sixth month
[32:42] the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
[32:46] the city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[32:49] virgin espoused to a man whose name was
[32:52] Joseph of the House of
[32:54] David and the virgin's name was Mary
[32:58] and the angel came unto her and said
[33:00] hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is
[33:04] with thee blessed art thou among women
[33:08] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[33:10] the saying and cast in her M mind what
[33:13] manner of salutation this should be and
[33:16] the angel said unto her fear not Mary
[33:19] for thou Hast found favor with God yes
[33:22] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[33:24] womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[33:27] call his name
[33:28] Jesus and he shall be great and shall be
[33:32] called the son of the highest and the
[33:34] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[33:36] of his father David and he shall reign
[33:38] over the house of Jacob forever and of
[33:40] his kingdom there shall be no end then
[33:44] said Mary unto the angel how shall this
[33:47] be seeing I know not a man and the angel
[33:51] answered and said unto her the Holy
[33:52] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[33:55] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[33:57] therefore also that Holy thing which
[33:59] shall be born of thee shall be called
[34:02] The Son of God and behold th cousin
[34:04] Elizabeth she is also conceived a son in
[34:07] her old age and this is the sixth month
[34:09] with her who was called baren for with
[34:13] God nothing shall be
[34:15] impossible and Mary said behold the
[34:18] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[34:20] according to Thy word and the angel
[34:23] departed from
[34:25] her I was reading a few quotes on
[34:28] Christmas today going through this just
[34:32] want to read something to you for a
[34:33] moment so today we find out that they
[34:36] have injected everything all of our
[34:38] holidays are polluted our Easter there's
[34:41] no more about the resurrection of Christ
[34:45] it's some kind of Easter rabbit some new
[34:47] hat or some little pink duck has nothing
[34:50] to do with the resurrection of Christ no
[34:52] more than Santa Claus has anything to do
[34:55] with the birth of Jesus Christ but us
[34:57] the world the commercial world has got
[35:00] everything in such a tangled and mess
[35:02] until no wonder God is Justified to burn
[35:05] the whole thing up and he's going to do
[35:08] it he promised he would he has to to get
[35:11] all of this mess in order there's no
[35:14] hope for it it's all gone but now in
[35:16] this hour of Darkness as I say is what
[35:19] we live in still Christians should be
[35:22] holding forth that light that there is a
[35:26] truth to Christmas
[35:28] that is the birth of Jesus Christ the
[35:31] son of God you know he said in Rome he
[35:34] said they make the same celebration that
[35:36] was the son God Su God's day they made
[35:39] it the son of God's birthday when they
[35:42] join joined it all together he said but
[35:44] what difference does it make see if it
[35:46] was in July or August or whatever might
[35:49] might be it's still the sacredness of
[35:52] remembering that God gave us the hope
[35:56] that we have in US and now you say well
[35:58] the rest of them's all Santa Claus and
[36:00] going on like that W they just might as
[36:02] well do it no sir that is not a p this
[36:05] is not a pagan celebration to us this is
[36:08] a sacred hour if there had been no
[36:11] Christmas there would have been no
[36:13] Resurrection if there would have been no
[36:15] Christmas there would have been no love
[36:18] there there had been no Christmas there
[36:20] would have been no peace if there have
[36:22] been there would have been no Christmas
[36:23] there have been no Hereafter for a
[36:25] Believer if there had been no
[36:28] Christmas he says what if there wasn't a
[36:30] real
[36:31] Christmas if there had not been a real
[36:34] Christmas things wouldn't be the way
[36:36] they are
[36:37] tonight if there wasn't a Christmas
[36:40] there wouldn't have been no
[36:41] salvation he said now we're facing
[36:44] Christmas again and it's too bad it's
[36:46] been changed they've changed it the real
[36:49] meaning of it being the birth of Christ
[36:52] to now as Santa Claus has taken the
[36:54] place of Christ in Christmas some
[36:57] fiction of Chris Kringle coming down a
[36:59] chimney and with a sack of toys on his
[37:01] back that visits the whole world in one
[37:03] night he said I don't know what you
[37:05] think about it it's all right I guess if
[37:08] you tell your children of that but he
[37:10] said the scripture says Thou shalt not
[37:13] lie and then someday they're going to
[37:15] ask you is Jesus the same thing as Santa
[37:17] Claus is is he real too when they find
[37:21] out there's no Santa Claus he said I
[37:23] think it's best myself that might not be
[37:25] your idea but I'm tell I'm not telling
[37:27] you how to to raise your children but if
[37:28] they catch you lying on that then
[37:30] they're going to say someday or maybe
[37:32] this is a this is also a lie so just
[37:35] tell them the truth the straight truth
[37:38] and then they'll know what you mean so
[37:41] no matter how bad the outside looks and
[37:44] what they're doing out there there that
[37:47] should not bother us from making
[37:49] Christmas what it should
[37:52] be amen
[38:02] [Music]
[38:16] God resty Mery gentle let nothing you
[38:22] dismay remember Christ Our Savior was

[52:58] Luke chap 2 and verse one says it came
[53:00] to pass in those days that there went
[53:02] out a decree from Caesar Agustus that
[53:05] all the world should be taxed and this
[53:08] taxing was first made of serenius was
[53:11] governor of Syria and all went to be
[53:14] taxed everyone into his own City and
[53:17] Joseph also went up From Galilee out of
[53:19] the city of Nazareth under Judea under
[53:22] the city of David which is called
[53:24] Bethlehem because he was of the house
[53:26] and lineage of David to be taxed with
[53:29] Mary his espouse wife being great with
[53:32] child and so it was that while they were
[53:35] there the days were accomplished that
[53:37] she should be delivered she brought
[53:40] forth her firstborn son and wrapped him
[53:43] in swaddling clothes laid him in a
[53:45] Manger because there was no room for
[53:47] them in the end there wasn't the same
[53:50] country shepherds abiding in the field
[53:52] keeping watch over their flock by night
[53:55] and lo the angel of the the Lord Came
[53:57] Upon them and the glory of the Lord
[53:58] Shone round about them and they were
[54:01] sore afraid and the angel said unto them
[54:04] fear not for behold I bring unto you
[54:06] good tidings of great joy which shall be
[54:09] to all people for unto you is Born This
[54:13] Day in the city of David a savior which
[54:16] is Christ the lord and this shall be a
[54:18] sign unto you that you shall find the
[54:20] Babe wrapped in swallen clothes lying in
[54:23] a manger and suddenly there was with the
[54:26] angel a multitude of heavenly hosts
[54:28] praising God and saying glory to God in
[54:31] the highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[54:34] toward men and it came to pass as the
[54:37] Angels were going away from them into
[54:39] heaven the Shepherds said one to another
[54:41] let us now go even unto Bethlehem and
[54:44] see this thing which has come to pass
[54:47] which the Lord hath made known unto us
[54:50] and they came with haste and found Mary
[54:53] and Joseph and the Babe lying in a
[54:55] Manger
[54:57] and when they seen it they made known
[54:58] abroad the Sayan which was told them
[55:00] concerning this child and all they that
[55:03] heard it wondered at those things which
[55:06] were told them by the Shepherds but Mary
[55:09] kept all these things and pondered them
[55:11] in her heart and the Shepherds returned
[55:15] glorifying and praising God for all the
[55:18] things which they had heard and seen as
[55:21] it was told unto
[55:23] them how God unfolded himself and he
[55:27] came in a Christmas PR package and was
[55:30] laid on a straw bed first thing he had
[55:34] to put his little head on was straw and
[55:37] a dirty piece of swadding cloth wrapped
[55:40] around him the last thing he had was a
[55:43] th Crown of Thorns with a dirty rag
[55:46] wrapped over his eyes and he was hit on
[55:48] the head saying if your Prophet tell us
[55:50] who hit you and then he was nailed to a
[55:53] cross that was love reaching out when
[55:58] his own children cried for his blood and
[56:00] screamed father forgive them they don't
[56:02] even know what they're doing that was
[56:05] love reaching out he said the church
[56:08] don't want him today they want a Creed
[56:10] but we need love the church is dying by
[56:13] Creeds it can only live by love because
[56:17] love is eternal life love overcomes all
[56:19] things love is the most powerful force
[56:21] there is no they didn't want him because
[56:24] they knew what was in the gift
[56:27] but some of them had it revealed to them
[56:29] what the gift really was what was really
[56:31] in the gift so some of them looked into
[56:33] it I believe the first one to look in
[56:35] that Christmas package I believe it was
[56:38] Angels cuz the Angels knew it it was
[56:41] revealed to them they knew it and they
[56:43] came out on the hillside and told it to
[56:45] the
[56:46] Shepherds but perhaps little Mary want
[56:49] you to listen to this real close as a
[56:51] quote little Mary sitting up there tired
[56:54] tired and Dusty poor old Shepherd boy
[56:57] come by stinking like
[56:59] sheep seeing that little mother sitting
[57:03] there meant something just like people
[57:06] today can see there's something that's
[57:09] fixing to happen tremendous
[57:12] times maybe an old Shepherd boy came by
[57:15] and seen that little mother and
[57:16] something struck
[57:17] him said I have some cool water here in
[57:20] this flask would you want to drink and
[57:23] the little family thanked him the little
[57:26] mother to be taking the drink of water
[57:29] maybe that was one of the little
[57:30] Shepherds laying there that night on the
[57:32] hill and down in the stable and the
[57:35] little baby crying the world didn't want
[57:38] him there wasn't no room for him but it
[57:40] was at the same time a shepher out on
[57:42] the hill the Angels came down and begin
[57:44] to sing The First Noel today in the city
[57:47] of David is born unto you Christ the
[57:50] Savior said that's the only way anybody
[57:52] in the world will ever know what's in
[57:54] that package it has to be revealed to
[57:57] you you'll turn it down maybe say it's
[57:59] fanaticism but when you get the
[58:01] Revelation you'll seek after it and
[58:03] you'll open it up and see what's on the
[58:05] inside and God will come in and suck
[58:08] with you and you with him then you're
[58:09] ready to open the door and let him in
[58:11] that little package that may be knocking
[58:13] at your heart tonight the greatest
[58:16] Christmas gift that was ever given the
[58:19] first one and the greatest one the
[58:21] little package knocking in the heart of
[58:23] a man I'll come in and suck you'll never
[58:26] know it until it's revealed to you but
[58:29] when it's revealed to you then you will
[58:32] go hunting for it
[58:35] yourself
[58:55] amen

[1:16:53] e e
[1:17:52] it's very striking to me as I was
[1:17:54] looking at this
[1:17:56] today brother Brandon would even speak
[1:17:58] about the shepherd who may have gave her
[1:18:00] a drink of water then they picked that
[1:18:03] up there in that film and then to see
[1:18:06] how that he was cast out of the
[1:18:07] religious Realms but when he came to
[1:18:10] Jesus he bound the
[1:18:12] broken that's what Jesus does and I and
[1:18:16] as they portrayed that in that film of
[1:18:18] when they heard and it was revealed they
[1:18:21] went they went looking for him and it
[1:18:24] was was in a place of humility it wasn't
[1:18:26] as they thought it would be in a you
[1:18:29] know maybe many thought it would be in a
[1:18:31] cathedral or he would have a angel
[1:18:34] salute as it were and come down on a red
[1:18:36] carpet into Caiaphas his Temple but
[1:18:39] brother Brandon would say it so
[1:18:41] eloquently he said how striking it is
[1:18:44] Jehovah born crying over a manure pile
[1:18:49] Jehovah born in a manger of straw there
[1:18:53] is your Everlasting sight to the proud
[1:18:55] and the puffed up amen the intellectuals
[1:18:59] who have involved in their own Theology
[1:19:01] and denied the truth of god Jehovah God
[1:19:05] a crying baby in a stinking Barn then we
[1:19:09] think we have the right to be proud
[1:19:10] holding up our nose criticizing acting
[1:19:13] as though we were somebody here's your
[1:19:15] real sign this is the right one Jehovah
[1:19:18] playing as a boy Jehovah working in a
[1:19:22] carpenter shop Jehovah washing the feet
[1:19:25] of fishermen I'll give you a sign said
[1:19:28] God not the sign of the white collared
[1:19:29] priesthood not the sign of wealth and
[1:19:32] power there's nothing in this sign that
[1:19:34] you will want or think suitable but it
[1:19:36] is an everlasting sign it is the
[1:19:39] greatest sign to all Jehovah standing in
[1:19:42] the courtyard bruised bleeding with
[1:19:44] thorns on his brow and spit on his face
[1:19:47] mocked and said it not Jehovah despised
[1:19:50] and rejected hanging naked on a cross
[1:19:52] while Hypocrites Jered and dared him to
[1:19:54] come down off the cross Jehovah ding
[1:19:57] Jehovah praying and nothing happened
[1:19:59] Jehovah died then Jehovah died that is a
[1:20:02] sign for all men now there isn't another
[1:20:05] one like it it is the greatest sign of
[1:20:07] all then Darkness Came Upon the Earth
[1:20:10] and they put him in a tomb and there he
[1:20:11] laid three days and night until the
[1:20:13] earthquake Shadow the shattered the gr
[1:20:16] Gloom of night and he came forth Jehovah
[1:20:18] came forth Jehovah ascended on high then
[1:20:22] Jehovah returned to indwell in his
[1:20:24] church Church Jehovah came back with a
[1:20:26] mighty rushing wind and flames of fire
[1:20:29] Jehovah came back to walk in the midst
[1:20:31] of his church and Empower his people
[1:20:33] once more Jehovah came in this time to
[1:20:36] stay in his people and again Jehovah
[1:20:38] heals the sick and again he raises the
[1:20:41] dead and manifest himself by the spirit
[1:20:44] Jehovah came back speaking in tongues
[1:20:46] and giving the answer back in
[1:20:48] interpretation Jehovah came down and he
[1:20:50] raised The Prostitute to sin no more he
[1:20:53] came down to the drunkard with fly bro
[1:20:55] fly blows on his face as he lay
[1:20:57] unconscious in the gutter yes Jehovah
[1:21:00] came to M be manifested in the flesh and
[1:21:03] manifested through the flesh Jehovah
[1:21:06] came God in us the hope of glory yes
[1:21:09] Jesus came and shed his blood and set
[1:21:12] the captive free he came and redeemed
[1:21:14] his lost sheep he gave eternal life that
[1:21:17] they should never perish and he won't
[1:21:19] lose one of them but will raise them up
[1:21:22] again at the last day Hallelujah as I
[1:21:24] think about it his birth brought his
[1:21:27] life and his life brought his death and
[1:21:29] his death brought his resurrection and
[1:21:32] his resurrection brought his Ascension
[1:21:34] and his and his Ascension brings his
[1:21:36] return his humility brought forth His
[1:21:40] Glory Hallelujah and his name shall be
[1:21:44] wonderful counselor Prince of Peace and
[1:21:47] the Mighty God is as as Paul said in
[1:21:50] Philippians 2:5 he said let this mind be
[1:21:52] in you which is also in Christ Jesus
[1:21:54] Jesus who being in the form of God
[1:21:56] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:21:58] God but made himself of no reputation he
[1:22:01] came in humility that he might leave in
[1:22:04] glory amen he he made of himself no
[1:22:07] reputation he took upon him the form of
[1:22:09] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:22:11] of men aren't you glad about that
[1:22:13] tonight and being found in the fashion
[1:22:15] as a man he humbled himself and became o
[1:22:19] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:22:21] the Cross wherefore God also hath highly
[1:22:24] exalted him and given him a name which
[1:22:27] is above every name and at the name of
[1:22:30] Jesus every knee shall bow of the things
[1:22:33] of Heaven and the things of Earth and
[1:22:35] the things under the Earth and every
[1:22:37] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[1:22:40] is Lord to the glory of God the
[1:22:44] Father Hallelujah he came with no name
[1:22:47] but he left for the name that's above
