stankies here today was so nice to have you brother gary sister barbara sandra god bless you uh each one of you that has gathered with us uh that has in the service today may the lord bless you in a very very special way and and speak to your heart those of you that's joining in with us by the way of internet we pray that the lord will bless you and your services there we never mean to take um away from what you have we just want to edify and build up the body of christ we believe um you know in assembling ourselves together and uh even so much the more as we see that they approaching and we like to see we like to see people faithful to their posted duty everywhere amen so we're not trying to take away from that we're just trying to build up the body of christ and encourage you in the lord today in a very special way amen we're going to look and back to the book of exodus this morning to the 23rd chapter and the 20th verse we're going to be speaking today on guarded and protected by the angel and we're just carrying this a little further today and going over some different points here that i want to uh make sure that the the holy spirit has the opportunity to to take that word and place it in your heart and so um exodus 23 verse 20 and we'll probably read from this chapter again a little later in the sermon today but it says behold i sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thy adversaries amen god bless you can take your seats amen god bless you brother johnny love you brother johnny amen appreciate every word of encouragement this morning that's what we're here to do we were exhorted by the apostle paul to preach the word be instant in season out of season we prove rebuke with all long suffering and doctrine amen because the time would come when they won't endure some doctrine amen but they'll heap to themselves teachers have an itching ears but oh god help us in this day to endure the sound doctrine of the world let it change our lives amen god bless you last sunday we were speaking on the angel leading the church and how the pillar of fire led the old testament church by the angel of his presence we know that in as we have been through this that he spoke to moses in the burning bush we also see in the bible that he came to daniel in a time where the jews were returning to their homeland when it was an hour for them to leave babylon and return to the land of their inheritance and the angel appeared to daniel and said i am now come to give thee skill and understanding for thou art greatly beloved isn't it wonderful to be told you're greatly loved angel that led the the book of acts church we know that we're going back to a book of acts church that's what we are about another another branch has come forth from the vine and we will have to be then to be a book of acts church where we have to be led by the pillar of fire and so it was a pillar of fire that uh filled the upper room and gave birth to 120 there and it was a pillar of fire then that turned and anointed peter as he gave to him the keys of the kingdom of salvation to the church would be the pillar of fire that gave faith to peter and john that the gate called beautiful and who said to the lame beggar look on us and it was that same pillar of fire that appeared in the jail cell and and an angel walked out of it and smoked peter on the side and loosed him from his chains it was the angel of god that appeared in the new testament church to a man by the name of cornelius and he described the angel as a man who stood before me in bright clothing and said cornelius and he said what is it lord he said thy prayers and nine alums are come up as a memorial before god god never forgets any righteous act and he said now send men to japan call for one simon whose surname is peter he lodges with one simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside and he shall tell you what you ought to do so to be a book of acts church we have to be a church that is left by the pillar of fire and filled with it you see the light of the holy ghost within you makes it easy for you to believe to have faith to claim god's promises and the angel of the covenant brother branham said you who have received the baptism of the holy ghost has got a witness that jesus christ lives and reigns and it ought to be an easy thing for you to believe in divine healing amen so again you know we we find this all throughout the bible and to be a bible church to be a new testament church we have to be a church that is led by the pillar of fire by the angel of the covenant in exodus chapter 40 and verse 36 we see it gives specific details about how that this this pillar of fire would be a light by night in a cloud by day and the bible said that when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the children of israel went onward in all their journeys but if the cloud were not taken up then they journeyed not until the day that it was taken up for the cloud of the lord was upon the tabernacle by day and fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of israel throughout all their journeys i don't think god's a respecter of persons i believe that if god is leading the church today he's just as interested in us as he was then amen and it ought to be even more powerful under the new covenant than it was under the old covenant there they were to follow that pillar of fire this was their instructions the pillar of fire would lead them no matter which way it went they were to be ready to go when it went and and the the but if we notice now that and i want to just quote this here is that the angel of the lord was going before them a pillar of fire by night a cloud by day the angel of the covenant the christ the logos before it was made flesh to dwell among us and that was a sign of the old testament they followed that pillar of fire wherever it went they went when it stopped they stopped when they built their camps under the pillar of fire and the priests watched foreign they sounded the trumpet and it was if it was midnight or three o'clock in the morning or 12 o'clock noon they all packed up and away they went they followed the pillar of fire and they kept in the will of the lord by doing so oh you know this has been the failure down through the seven ages they would see the pillar of fire and they would see it move and then they would make a camp there and then didn't move as it moved but you see there were the dark ages sometimes were they didn't even see the pillar of fire didn't even see it at all they wasn't led by it they wouldn't acquaint it with it but there was a fellow one day by the name of martin luther that he saw the pillar of fire and he went on the first reformation and he preached the just or the righteous shall live by faith and that fire of emboldened him to resist the unbelief of the age and to resist the catholic church and he nailed his 95th thesis to the door of the church and said salvation is by faith alone and then he said he taught the bible is the only authority and the priesthood that the priesthood is a priesthood forever believer amen that every believer is a priest unto god this is what the pillar of fire taught luther and he moved out of that but and there he began to to operate under the leadership of the pillar of fire the just shall live by faith he was inspired by it he was anointed by it he was sent out by it but it wasn't long until his followers would organize his church so tight until you could hardly tell them from the catholics and soon you had to be a lutheran or you were nothing and that's brother adams who commented about that he said the pillar of fire won't hang over nothing like that so away it went and he said and the pillar of fire moved away from the lutheran church luther couldn't go because he had all his rituals and everything that he wrote up and there was a little fellow by the name of john wesley in england that saw it and the way he went and he had a revival that saved england in the united states and and the english known world in that day under the wesley revival wesley and george whitfield and asbury and many of them had that great revival and their revival inspired new songs as a song sung the songs of their deliverance let me let me just take you back for a moment let's just go back into the the year 1880 140 years ago sister atlanta shared a link to this article and some of you may have read it but i want to share some of it this morning uh it was in august of 1880 that buddy robinson would be at one of those revival meetings now if you remember in our family camp that we had right over here in the edge of texas they had a big marble on the stone there that listed all the great speakers of the past and they reminisced some of them reminisce to to us we used to have meetings like you're having we used to see the holy spirit move on people like you see it moved and it made you wonder what did they used to have because today the methodist church is a far cry from what that that they they must have been back there they're far cry from any kind of meetings like we got where you shout and praise god and sing the songs of zion there's a heartfelt religion a man that lied that changes lives amen where the holy spirit can move but buddy robinson would be at that one of those meetings that revival was held somewhere near dallas texas where a rich ranch man had been converted and allowed them to meet on his place the word of the revival meetings had spread by circuit rider preachers and people came in from covered wagons from miles around and the ranch owner had told them just kill as many of his fat cattle to provide food for them daily and and perhaps as many as 300 people had gathered and put up a brush arbor as a shelter to worship under and buddy he these are from his words he said deep conviction had settled on me on the second day he said i felt that i was lost you know it's amazing that people can come to a church today and never realize they need jesus never a spirit of conviction that that tells them they have need of god it may never be an evening like tabernacle that there's not a holy spirit moving among us that deals with the hearts of men and women that tells them you need jesus amen in fact no matter i don't care who you are how great a saint you are you need him we everyone need that fresh and up-to-date experience with god and that's why we ought to come for every service one day he said to preachers i asked the workers to go down in the crowd and find the center and pray for him wherever they found him and he said a beautiful old mother with her beautiful white hair and the finest face i ever saw came through the crowd and she looked like you could take a a rag and wipe heaven off of her face and she fell she found me on the back mansion there was no need of her saying young man are you a sinner she looked at me and no no christian ever looked like i did she went down before me on her knees and put her hands up on my bare knees where they were sticking through my dirty overalls and prayed for me as loud as she could and the devil got up and said if you don't give her a cousin she'll never quit but it seemed the lord said don't you cuss this woman she's praying for your lost soul then it's then then it seemed to me that the devil said if you don't get up and run they're going to get you but beloved god had come on the scene i tried to get up but i couldn't get up off that it seemed that i was glued to it while the devil fairly hissed in my face and that beautiful mother prayed louder and louder and finally began to shout and rising to her knees began to beat me on the head until i thought i was going to sink to the ground into the pit and that old mother shouted as long as she wanted to and finally arose and looked like she was half glorified she went back toward the platform in the mourner's bench but she did not say when she left young man come to the altar tonight no beloved she didn't ask me to come to that altar that woman was acquainted with god and knew i was coming to the mourner's beach when the service was over i finally pulled loose from that and rose but the arrow of conviction had already went through my poor heart until i couldn't pull it out in my agony i walked the grounds that afternoon too sick to eat my dinner i wish for the sun to go down i thought if the sun would go down it would get dark and no one could see how mean i was and when the sun went down my upper heart was not only dark on the outside but it was black on the inside and then i felt i would be a dead man before daylight but praise the lord they lit up the old torchlights of the ground and the congregation began to sing oh who will come and go with me i'm bound for the promised land said i've marched to that little campground and i've taken a back seat and i noticed a little redhead girl that i'd met somewhere on the dance floor and the devil always goes to the meeting and he said he came to me and said if you get up a courtship with that little girl on the back bench you'll get easy but beloved a courtship never eases a guilty conscience and a lost soul and while i tried to talk to her i felt like a lost man the preacher who preached that night was a tall man with with a long beard and and the hair and a little inclined the baldness and wore a long coat and that's the one that preached up to that night but the man who preached that night he said did not feel the bill as far as i was concerned he wore a very short coat his beard was short his hair stood straight up on his head he looked dangerous and i thought he can't preach a leak and would be a failure but later i learned he was one of the greatest preachers west of the mississippi river he preached to the lost world without a savior where the devil was boss and general manager and where people were under the awful dominion of the devil he pictured christ laying outside his robes of royal splendor putting on humanity and being born in a manger then he pictured christ on the cross because he loved the lost and dying world he made the crucifixion of christ so real that it seemed to me he had he had died a week ago somewhere here in texas and when he made his altar call the response was so general that to all appearance the whole crowd would finally land at the altar they went whooping and yelling screaming and praying as loud as they could two or three preachers were helping men to the altar there were so many they turned the benches around to make a big pen and they actually filled it full and i stood back and wept i wanted to go the altar but i knew nothing of church preachers meetings of salvation i didn't know how to start or what to do but thank god he will always help a boy that wants to do right an old preacher with a lost long white beard and beautiful white locks came down the aisle and said is there a young man back here that wants to meet me in heaven and he said if so come give me your hand and i'll pray that god may save you i stood and i wept and one moment i said if jesus loved me well enough to die for me i will love him well enough to fight for him while in the next breath i said i will shoot the next man that talks about jesus christ my gun which was loaded was in my pocket the old preacher pleaded and i started saying i can do that much i can at least give him my hand when i reached him i was crying as loud as i could he grabbed my hand he missed it he took me by the arm he gave it a shake and when he turned me loose i started down the aisle toward the mourner's bench i didn't go very far until the devil stood before me and said if you go to that mourner's bench the preacher will see your old ragged your old ragged breeches and make fun of you well he couldn't stop me with that and he said well they'll see your old pistol and that'll get you in trouble but thank god he didn't stop me at that but i went down the eye aisle the old pistol felt as big as a mule and the old deck of cards in my pocket was as big as a bale of cotton and i was getting on my right foot i thought i was going to get right in the pit and i would stagger then i'd get on my left foot that day deck of cards weighed as much as a bale of cotton i know today what king david said when he said they will reel to and fro and will stagger like a drunk man and be at their wit's end and when i reached the altar somebody said fix a seat for this young man he's deeply struck thank god that man was a philosopher the only mistake he made was not that i was able to sit in a rocking chair because my head was so full of gospel bullets that i was just about all in i fell down on that mourner's bench and right somebody got me by the hills and straight me out right there i caught the devil in a lie he told me when i started down the aisle the people would see my old ragged breaches and make fun of me to my glad surprise every preacher knelt around me as i prayed and screamed as loud as i could and and for god to have mercy on me and save my life soul my streaks and whales seem to touch the heart of every preacher there as it knelt around me with their faces turned toward heaven and their hands in the air i never heard men pray like that before it was a life and death struggle a poor soul was right on the borderland of death and destruction but god's mercy had reached my case and while we were praying together the bottom dropped out of heaven and my soul was flooded with light and joy until the little waves of glory rolled up and down my soul i don't know how i got up but bless god i know i got up because i'm up now and when i did get on my feet people look like angels they appeared to be rubbed in white it was as light as i as it as this had been at the noon hour of the day but it was at 11 o'clock at night this was wednesday august 11 1880 how well i remember that light it'll stay with me forever no doubt the reader has heard the little song how well i remember in sorrow's dark night when the lamp of his word shed its beautiful life more grace he hath given and the burdens removed and over and over his goodness has proved and shall i turn back to the world oh no not i not i he said i believe that getting religion is the finest thing in the known world after i hopped and skipped and jumped and shouted unto midnight i would jump the mourner's bench from one side to the other all the time telling people i had got religion well thank god i got religion sure enough and it seemed like religion had got me after shouting until about midnight i went down to the ravine through my revolver way i killed a little chunk fire and burnt my deck of cards and then i crawled under an ox wagon lay down on the bare ground and place my hat on a chunk for a pillow i did not go to sleep where sleep had left the country i laid there and laughed like a boy at a circus i was almost tickled to death every burden was gone my guilt was gone all sorrow and sadness was gone i forgot that i lived in poverty i thought i was dressed like the angels and while my heart was turning somersault i was laughing like a boy at a circus i was one boy that kept company with his religion the very first night that he got it i felt that night was as though i would never be sick sad lonesome hungry or in trouble it seemed that heaven was only three feet away during that night jesus came under the wagon and called me to preach i could see his beautiful face with a crown of thorns on his brow i could see the sweat and the blood mingled on his face and the old purple robe over his shoulders he was so real to me i'll never forget my first meeting with jesus he told me he wanted me to preach the gospel while i told him i would go i had no idea what that meant to be a god-called minister or preacher of the gospel but after 47 years of preaching almost day and night living alone in my life sometimes spending only a week at home during the whole year i've learned that when god calls a man to preach god really has to do something for him the next morning his day was breaking i crawled out from under the ox wagon i went on to the campground i watched the sun rise in all its grandeur and glory the heavens were lit lighted up i would look one direction and it would appear to be like a mountain of oranges in another direction like a ton of strawberries i'd look at another direction it was like a ton of ice cream it seemed to me the angels were having strawberries and ice cream for breakfast i looked and and and and saw a big flock of clouds in another direction and i had the appearance of a great flock of sheep with their wool on fire and just about the time heaven came down on earth and i was so blessed that soon i was leaping up and down and clapping my hands and praising god as loud as i could shout about that time a man come along and said are you going to go up to the testimony meeting this morning i said yes sir i'm going up i've never been to a testimony meeting in fact i've never heard one i walked up to the big arbor i wonder what kind of a meeting it would be if it was good as the one we had last night it would be great and when we got up to the arbor if the man took the big ox horn and blew it until it sounded like a bugle the ox horn instead of they used it instead of a bell to call the people the tabernacle at the sound of the horn the people came from every direction that came out of their their tents and wagons until there were people all over the campground and and all over the camp shed and the and a man read a few verses of scripture and they sang and they prayed and after the meeting that the meeting was open for testimonies i wondered what in the world was it going to be like a man rose and began to praise god testify of the saving grace while he testified my heart was leaping for joy but when another went but when he sat down another man beat me up and and he said a big tall man with a black beard and long black hair with a big woolen shirt and overalls and high-heeled boots stood in the presence of that crowd his frame trembling said oh brother i've been all over these prairies for 20 years as a ranch man and i have committed all the sins known to a ranch man when i've heard of this medium last night about dark it made me mad i sat on my horse and rode in last night i came here to whip every preacher on the grounds and run everybody off but when i arrived here last night at a late hour i beheld one of the strangest sights of my life there would be a crowd over on one side singing and a crowd on another side shouting their hands were up their hair was hanging down their backs their faces looked like angels and over in another place it'd be a crowd down on their knees praying and somebody would raise up then and start shouting and i thought well i won't whip anybody until they quit and quiet down but instead of shopping stopping they became worse finally just to see what they were doing i made my way to the crowd to bench right in the middle of the arbor where i could see everything that was going on the great multitude seemingly did not know i was there but while they prayed and sang and shouted my whole life stood before me i saw i was a lost man i knew that if i would die i would go to hell the burden became so awful that i fell off the bench i got down between two benches where two or three men gathered around me and they began to sing and pray with me and form me and this morning just before day god save my soul and he said but he said i couldn't stand it no longer i had to do something or die or simply just blow up and i jumped just as high as i could i screamed as loud as i could and i began to jump up and down as fast as i could it looked like i would die with religious satisfaction amen this was a methodist meeting and the lord came to my relief and showed me a big post under the old arbor and i threw both arms around that post and started up just like a gray squirrel and i climbed until i got my head got to the brush and i could go no further and while i was sticking there on the side of the post god poured out a spirit on the people i believe the holy spirit fulfilled that multitude of 150 to 300 people they were filled with the holy ghost like they were on the day of pentecost there were hundreds of people leaping in the air clapping their hands praising god at the top of the voice the women literally danced and shouted like they were angels men ran into others arms and wrestles like athletes waves of glory swept over them and it took life looked like they were immense in glory that was the methodist church back then how far they have fallen from grace you see the pillow fire was there they were reacting amen to the very power of god that was in their midst amen this did not just produce emotion just changed their lives it made a preacher out of out of a card playing dancing bloody robinson and made a son of god out of him when he traveled around the country and been preaching the gospel for years and years and years because he met god in a pillar of fire amen but you know the first thing you know methodists got so organized until after a few rounds they got just as cold and starchy as they could be you see the pillar of fire and i'm quoting brother branham here he said the pillar of fire will not hang over that i'll tell you what if you're sitting here cold and in full and horrible come on and starchy the pillow fire ain't gonna hang over you it's looking for somebody that will respond to the word amen that believes it's the truth that allows you to change our lives amen and he said the pillar of fire won't hang over that's the way it went and he said a bunch of people called the pentecostal scene it and the way they went after but then they built him a church under but the sad part the pentecostals are so organized that the pillar of fire is moving out again and they can't go that's right the pillar of fire is moving anyhow god said it would they had the sign of the pillar of fire by night a cloud by day that led them and he's here in the gods house where that same pillar of fire is in the house right here now because it was the angel of the covenant the lord jesus christ when he died he rose again he lives forever more he promised the things he did we do also and greater for he went to the father amen so i wonder why today now wait a minute i wonder why the pillar of fire isn't hanging over some of these message morgues today backslidden preachers men who have long forgot even how to pray churches that don't even know how to pray people through to the baptism of the holy ghost maybe the real reason is because they never got the holy ghost themselves they must meet that pillar of fire and that then be sent by the angel of god the holy ghost it must be our drive it must be our passion amen it's a shame when preachers have nothing to preach are you with me now they have nothing to preach but to make fun of and ridicule and blaspheme anointed prayers i heard of one ridiculing people who pray with a passion and you know just recently saying brother branham only prayed softly and then he made fun saying is god death does god need a hearing aid that's blasphemy to make fun of to mock to ridicule amen yeah it's sad when a minister tells his church basically don't get anointed when you pray there's there were many ways brother branham prayed we know that he prayed softly but he didn't always pray quietly hey man he didn't always he didn't always lift his voice but many times he did and especially at the climax of a meeting you don't have to listen to too many tapes and find that out amen but let me just go to the words of jesus hebrews five and seven in the days of his flesh he offered up both prayers and supplication with loud crying or strong crying and cheers unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard and that he feared so so again this was jesus amen he offered up prayers and supplication with loud cries [Applause] and he was heard in that which he feared i say if the angels shake the post of the temples come on now that ought to be good enough for you good enough for me amen in isaiah 6 he said and decried one another and said holy holy holy is the lord god almighty the lord of hosts and the whole earth is full of his glory and the post out the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke amen this wasn't singing in a high pitch that broke a crystal glass this this was shouting crying holy holy holy amen that wasn't crying holy holy holy they wasn't whispered they cried until the post of the temple moved it ought to be the same way in the house of god where there is some fervency where there's some passion where there's a drive in the a if the methodist could do that come on what about us born again holy ghost field hoping life amen we got even more than sad about that they have hallelujah you say but brother tim the seals have been open to me and the the the revelation and we just sit there studiously and tried to absorb let me tell you that's not what they did in heaven when it was open amen the bible said and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and beasts and elders and number of them was ten thousand times ten thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wilson and strength and honor and glory and blessing and i'll tell you if you've seen the seals open hallelujah if you saw your name in the book if you saw the mysteries have revealed and you see where you are in this last day it'll make you sound too it'll make you rejoice also hallelujah amen why even the souls under the altar prayed with a passion and a loud voice they were so located to the throne that they could hear the answer coming back and the bible said and they cried out with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true will you refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those that dwell on the earth you see there there you see how we get we we that got to the place we're so formal we we we don't want we don't want any shouting we don't want any rejoicing we we don't want any any kind of uh emotion you know the people shouldn't get emotional today you know and brother timothy just recently preached on the dangers of formalism and and another pastor can you imagine these pastors had backslidness can be had the right of blood defending his formalism because his church is dead and as dry as last year's burden now i want to say why defend your formalism just repent yes [Applause] amen let me say it this way if you're not on fire if there's no passion if there's no drive if there's no joy flowing like a river you're formal and your wells are stopped up it's time to unstop let the blessings flow let the joy come out [Applause] amen well this is not all an emotion brother tim that may be right but god hates an emotionless religion amen in end time evangelism brother adam said and and he said these scientific theory of the modern so-called religious groups have tried to prove that this blessed thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotion it just don't stand up to theirs according to scientific theory well i just like to ask them this what makes them change what makes the drunkard stop drinking what makes the prostitute cease her evil life what makes the cancer and the diseases depart from the people and the deaf and the dumb and the blind and the dead to raise up explain that if there is that emotion it has emotion with it certainly anything that's alive has emotion and anything that don't have emotion is dead excuse expression but i think we ought to bury some of this emotionless religion amen because it's dead it has no emotion and any religion that has no emotion and it should be buried uh because it is emotional amen jesus when he entered the city and the and the children of them uh all his friends crying hosanna to him to him that cometh in the name of the lord those religions so that they couldn't stand it it was too emotional said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out something must cry out because life is there hallelujah well brother tim but you know we're we're we're balanced you know we we're we're not really over here fervent and on fire like that and we're really and we're really not real cold you know we get an amen once in a while and you know somebody you know has a inspired song and we raise their hand so we're balanced brother tim no that's called lukewarm mm-hmm amen listen brother branham said listen what he said we're now seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus sitting in there a great seat that's already fired up been raised from the dead we're a part of it if you're part of that bride you are because the bride's a part of the groom you know and so we find out the same thing she'll do exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day she won't be allowed to see her not by no means a lukewarm she'll be on fire for god she'll be moving in the spirit hallelujah amen now here's what he said about your formalism he said now this is door-to-door door of the door in 57 he said now that certainly fits the situation today of the modern church the pentecostal church today just lukewarm condition neither cold nor hot it would be better if we would either be back in their old denominational state status or be up in the realms of the blessings of god than to sit in a lukewarm condition as we are now the lord would appreciate us much more if we would do it god would rather you either be cold not in between not in between come on cold or hot that's what god wants amen he said he god would appreciate you even more just going on back to your old denominational state or status or be up here he said in the realms of the blessing of god then just in a lukewarm condition i say god don't let me be lukewarm whatever amen and i don't want to be cold either amen let me be on fire amen let the fire of god burn hot within the soul man now this angel leading israel it looked like he had led them into a trap we were there last sunday the sea was in front of the mountain on either side and now pharaoh's army was coming in behind but this was only to bring israel in the place where they could speak somebody with me now this is this was the whole purpose of it it was bringing israel to a place where they had to speak remember why christ fought unto me speak and go forward is that right that's right you see the evil age that we're in why are we here right now god is bringing us into a place where we are flushed can't go back payroll's army they can't go this way can't go that way and we've got a red sea in front of us wait man we we're we're surrounded so god has brought us to this place for us to speak speak the revelation of faith that came from that pillar of fire everybody go forward amen quit crying to me speak speak and lift up that rod look at exodus 14 15 and the lord said unto moses wherefore christ die unto me speak to the children of israel that they go forward but lift up thy rod and stretch for out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea so look where he brings them to him why are you crying why are you moaning how come you're moaning that that that even the republicans are worst liberals that you can imagine can you can you imagine this this guy running bruce jenner going to run for you know calls himself a woman now but he's not a woman he's a man but he don't know what he is mixed up going to run for for the governor of state of california as a as a conservative as a as a republican can you imagine that being conservative that is how far they have fallen they don't even know what the word conservative is i'm sorry i make some people mad but i'm going to go down this line anyhow but you know we got all these women governors and william women mayors and and they're all republicans and we're we're conservative and all they're not conservative they would be conservative they'd be at home preparing her a meal for their family being a mother in the house [Applause] that's what conservativism would do for you hey man that's what bible conservative is amen but anyway oh we we're conservative we got conservative values they have no values they're not even as good as yesterday's liberals so we're here in the time you say but brother jim we're we're we're we're all around i asked my barber the other day us he was talking about the world condition i said i wonder how we got the condition we are i just wanted to hear from him he said well it's the schools by the time they put liberals in the colleges put liberals there in the classrooms and they took and they and they have brainwashed their kids this man don't even go to church but he's got enough righteousness about him from some righteous parents before him a man in his 80s and he's cutting my hair and he said he said they put liberals everywhere and he said they they they're they're brainwashing our kids and their brain was a whole society and they got it on the television everywhere everywhere you look every advertisement everything you know pushing their agenda trying to change your mind amen and we're in danger are you with me we're in danger of being destroyed amen we are in danger in america of rel the of real true christianity being wiped out of being a persecuted group we're there amen i'll tell you what we're there we're in danger of it we're right on the cusp we're right on the edge of the tribulation we're right on the edge of the marking of the beast we're already seeing tribulation pre-tribulation plagues coming to our our lives that hope changes and not bro and and and um roots up our whole world the world that we know today isn't even the same as it was a year ago until 2019 i

coming up for our kids it's coming for our families it's attacking our homes somebody help me preach amen but i tell you it's in that moment that there is a people of mature people who have been called out of egypt who have been commissioned to use the word given to them and speak hallelujah it's time brother that we go right through the waters of separation between mortal and immortality and moving to the round beyond hallelujah speak and lift up that rod that rod is the name of jesus did you hear me lift up that name of jesus amen what was in moses hand in jesus name in the church's hand today everybody that's the truth and and if the egyptians could've ever got that rod out of his hand oh listen don't don't walk over that name don't use it don't use it in vain remember when you speak it speak with sincerity and now when you pray pray in that name whatever you do and what did he do in that name but speak and lift up that rod amen amen we we've got the banner of the name of jesus amen when you take that name of jesus come on somebody amen devils will scatter like roaches on the floor when the lights turned on brother i'll tell you enemies will vanish before the name of jesus but in the name of jesus every knee has to bow and every tongue has to confess that he's lord oh the old song we used to sing when sickness round together breathe that holy name in prayer amen why it is god's representative of judgment come on amen he was holding the judgment right is that right that's the name of jesus and it's god's representative of judgment against sin come on against the gods of egypt and man against the nile it was used in every way come on it would use even bring water out of the rock that name of jesus will bring water out of a dry place even feed a thirsty soul that's in the midst of a desert that name of jesus will open the way where there is no way hallelujah amen but it represents judgment where christ was judged in your place so when i pray in the name of jesus i can pray on the authority of where the judgment was placed on him that's why devils has to go amen that's why sickness has to move amen prayer in the name of jesus lifting up that rod now verse 19 and the angel of god noticed speaking the name lifting the rod caused the pillar of fire to move and the angel of god went before the camp of israel and removed and went behind them and the pure cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and it became between notice this between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud of darkness to them but it gave light by night to days so that one came not near the other all night listen lifting up the name of jesus brought the pillar of fire come on around and place it between them and their enemy hallelujah amen you see it made a light to israel and darkness of pharaoh it kept them apart it was their go-between oh i'm glad today there's a go-between amen and sickness between life and death he's our go-between amen he's the one that takes death in one hand life in the other he's that link that commit com connects man to god the go-between and it came down to as it go between and made a light on one side darkness on the other side to hold the pharaoh back come on listen pharaoh listen on all your armies of hell am in the very darkness a man is holding you back where there is a light that is guiding us forward hallelujah and one day that light's coming for us hallelujah lead us between over the great divide into the realms of immortality he came down as a goat between the angel of god is in the church right now given the light to the church to walk on in darkness to those who reject it that's exactly right oh my you see how can you see when you walk in darkness you can't see you don't know where you're going but you're if you're in the light and christ is a light he's given a light to the believers while he's given darkness to the unbelievers and he's showing a path a way of escape to the believer and darkness and stumbling to the unbeliever amen no wonder paul would say if god be for us then who can be against us amen oh hallelujah verse 21 and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord calls the sea to go back by the east wind all that night and made to see dry land and the waters were divided or one of the writers said that god was in that pillar of fire and he looked down to that with the angry eyes and when he did the red sea got scared and began to move back and israel began to move through on dry land can you imagine this god did what he actually looked through that pillar of fire and as he looked down through that pillar of fire the sea got scared and begin to roll back [Music] amen now let me tell you friends we're at another crossing yes we are yes amen we we are we are we're at another crossing of the red sea that just first crossing with moses only was typing amen there's another separation coming we will leave mortality and embrace immortality the close of our humanity will leave behind as we cross the border line between time and eternity and when we do there's going to be a separation oh yeah there'll be a separation from the impersonators the lukewarm church members among us oh yeah that bunsen wants to defend their formal ways one of these days you're going to try to follow that holy ghost band and your wills are going to come off amen you'll be stuck in the mud there the very mud of your own weights your own stubbornness your own refusal to move on with god amen you've been up you might have been a backslidden church member or grandchild of the message falling along half-heartedly oh yeah there's too many of those and you how you follow them because it's what you know remember those movies and the video games and the worldliness and the setting sense will bog you down and you'll sink down in that mud you'll be stuck to the things you wouldn't surrender amen but this time it ain't going to be a mixed multitude that makes it through the bible said that we're ten virgins five were wise five were foolish is that right you got to get oil in your lap and trim it up remember your lamps are bright and clear amen get all of the smut off of you the world off of you come on church amen but they're they're going to go the bible said they'll wind up we're weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth because they fail to have oil with their lamps amen they were church members that were gathered right along they were virgins like the rest amen but they failed to get the oil it's time to check your lamps hey man it's time to see your fire's burning it's time to cut the carving off of the whip amen just bring it up a little higher and let the light shine brighter get the smell off the globe and this was the hour of the going home and you can't be a foolish virgin in this hour you've got to be a wise virgin and a wise version get the holy ghost [Music] exodus 14 22 and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon dry ground and there the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left and the egyptians pursued and went after them in the midst of the sea even all of pharaoh's horses his chariots his horsemen and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord looked oh my he looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and he troubled the egyptians oh yeah and he took off their chariot whip and he prayed them heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for what the lord the lord fight it for them against the egyptians we would have died but the lord come on church we would have been taken captive but the lord amen there's somebody that's fighting on our behalf you're not in this alone little children hallelujah he looks down through his pillow fire and he sees the enemy among you and he begins to travel them hallelujah begins to tear off their wheels [Music] [Applause] let me tell you the pillar fire is a real fire and it'll stand between you and trouble brother bradham said when trouble begins to face you sickness on every hand the angel of the lord of god comes up and goes between you in sickness and stands there challenging you to take god's word [Music] notice what it does the angel god stands and goes between you and the enemy and then challenges you know what he did to moses why cry use what i gave you speak it go forward move on don't let nothing stop you you were told you were going to the promised land there was a red sea in your way it's got to move amen god gave israel the promise that we're going to the land maybe there was a million egyptian or more coming pursuing them but the angel lord who was there to carry them to the promised land rose up in the camp and stood between them in danger i say hallelujah he still does it he'll still make the way don't you love him for that this morning amen he'll make a way for every sick person amen he'll make a way for you that are in sin no matter what you've been dealing with he's already been made the way and he'll stand between you and your trouble hallelujah sister rachel the lord will be your lawyer amen whatever your need is he'll be for you he'll be your realtor he'll provide for you amen he's god that does the best he makes the way where there seems to be no way he's the god of god who understands us of god who knows our it and he said quit crying use what i've given you in advance [Applause] hallelujah stand right there between you in trouble amen just what he did then he is now and will always be the same the angel of god moving up to stand between us in sickness stand between us in death hallelujah amen you remember that sister janie you walked up to brother branham that day and standing between you and brother branham you walked right into a presence and that presence stood between you and darkness come on church challenging you to believe amen it does the same thing it it challenges you to believe take god in his word god said this believe it amen believe his prophets you'll prosper amen surely standing there the angel of god went before the camp of israel removed and wouldn't stood between them and the enemy and the angel of god is standing between every individual here and the enemy i know what i'm speaking of i know i stand here on the platform this little group of people i know that god is condescended coming from glory standing in this building now if you only dare to move out on god's word and see if he won't move before you now and he came between the camp and the egyptian he's coming between you and your sickness he's standing between you and your sins right now why we are in the exodus of the church amen now so brother branham deals with this and and he says he said when the enemy was right there over them coming so close that supernatural pillar of fire raised up from over israel come over here and stood between them and death now to every believer oh listen to this to every believer born again child of god when death comes stealing to the door prematurely the angel of god stands between you and the sickness now if you want to run right on to it that's your business but you don't have to he's standing between you and death challenging you to thank god's word [Music] hallelujah amen brother gary you remember that day in that hospital when demons had been surrounding you and scaring you and bringing fear all of that going on and we stood there and saw the holy spirit come down and stand between him and those howling devils and the devils had to go because god was looking down through the pillar of fire hallelujah the 19th of the spirit of god came down and he left from that hospital and god made him a well man he's here in the service today to the glory of god amen he'll still do it now amen he said well what's prematurity prematurely brother tim i i'm 82 i'm 83 i'm 80 this i'll tell you what it's premature if god wants you to stay here as long as i'm walking in the will of god if i'm 93 i still expect god to be my healer for the pillar of fire to stand between me and death [Applause] come on amen verse 26 and the lord said to moses stretch over thy hand over the sea hold that rod now hold it steady keep that name of jesus before you don't back away from the promise don't start fearing now don't look over your shoulder and see where the egyptians are and how closely advancing up through the promise stretch that hand lift that name of jesus hallelujah and that the waters may come down upon the egyptians upon their chariots upon their horsemen and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the mourning appeared and the egyptians fled against it now who's fleeing now who's pursuing now who's chasing who the egyptian was pursuing them but now come on tables have turned god is pursuing them hallelujah the waves are coming over them amen and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea hallelujah and when the waters returned and covered the cherish the horsemen into the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were wall unto them on the right side hand and on their left thus the lord saved israel that day of the hand of the egyptian and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the seashore and israel saw the great work which the lord did to the egyptians the people feared the lord and believed the lord and his servant moses now brother branham teaches us that this is a type of the blood sanctifying the power of god killing sin nature sin behind you the taskmasters the cigarettes the whiskey the road houses the picture shows everything that bothered you back there and hindered you in your christian experience died in the blood of jesus that's what buddy robinson found he didn't need the pistol anymore he had the lord as a guard and protector threw it over and around come on hey man he didn't need a deck of cards anymore that old thing that weighed like a bale of cotton burned with fire amen why he had went through the blood of jesus christ amen the red blood of jesus christ drowned every cigarette every tobacco and when the filth of the world was drowned like them past massacres right there and they were floating in the sea oh it's no wonder let a man like buddy dance and shout amen it'll happen to you amen it'll happen to you and to you and do you you come in the presence of god and your sins are gone and your past masters are dead amen it'll put a spring in your step too it'll put a shout in your life it'll paint it make joy unspeakable and full of glory that's what he'll do amen as i said the devil get our kids to look at porn then condemn until they hate themselves they'll feel so dirty they'll cut themselves and want to commit suicide he's a wicked and a hard taskmaster amen but i'll tell you what moses did moses got on the other side and he began to sing in the spirit he raised his hand to god and sang in the spirit and marry him got a tambourine and began to dance and shout and jump up and down and praise god hallelujah amen and all the taskmasters they looked and saw they were dead in the sea amen they looked back and said that thing will never bother me again i burp my bridges you know that's the problems people like an old girlfriend one of my brothers had one time she wanted you know wanted to catch his eyes so she uh she put all her makeup and she put all her pants and she put all her records and she put them all in a nice plastic bag and she went down the hole and she buried them i got rid of them i laid it all down i i i cleaned my life up you know now i can have this boy when she didn't get the voice she went back and dug up her pants and her records and her makeup and everything else you see you you can't do that you got to burn your bridges am i the sins i used to do i'd do them no more i'll not serve that devil another day come on i'll not be a slave to him another day my enemy is dead and when you can see he's dead by the blood of jesus christ then he has no more power over your life you have power down over him and that'll make you dance that'll make you sound and he might make you climb a pole like buddy robinson they're south the glories of god amen amen look moses was a type of this and he could see what the what had been done now now brother branham talked about this and he said this was pentecost he said this was a pentecostal experience they were the chosen people of god they had the spirit among them and he said when when moses had across the red sea and found behind him the red sea of the blood representing the blood and all the task masters he ever beat him and all the children of israel he raised his hand and sang in the spirit oh every one of us can be of moses hallelujah said every one of us can be of moses when we look back in the red blood of the lord jesus as he ever drunk every old bottle old vulgar woman or every old dirty man or oh every old dirty thing we've ever done in our life all dead in the blood of the lord jesus it'll make you sing in the spirit hallelujah cigarettes tobaccos bad habit everything gone and dead in the blood of the lord jesus and then we can raise our hands and sing in the spirit amen brother brandon said that was real pentecost now you want to talk about being a book of acts church start there hallelujah oh you lukewarm message believers today you've come out of egypt but why is it that that taskmaster still owns you come you can't keep out of porn keep your head out of movies still go into picture shows or worse than that have it in your house why is it your wives and daughters are still slave to makeup you know how come you still have that uncontrollable temper why is it your marriages are not sanctified and there is verbal and mental and physical abuse how come this how come is it your kids don't want your religion how come there's no love in your home why is it your heart is so hard you can't tell your wife and your kids that you love them and show it you know even the father said of jesus this is a son i love this is my beloved son and when the spirit of christ comes into the light it'll make you love everybody that's what buddy robinson was trying to say he saw us that everything looked different and men that women look like angels the heavens were on fire with the glory of god i began to shout because he now looked through a sanctified eye why is it you look for fault in the church is it just to justify your own meanness and your own sins i mean why is it if you go home and tell your kids wow they're just working up these people you know you don't have to shout and scream and jump like that and you know the baptist way of getting it is a lot better you know just accept the message say i believe it and you got the holy ghost well that ain't the way that god's prophet described the new birth he didn't believe in a new birth that was a dry eyed confession he believed he did not believe in easy believism the billy graham altar calls were not william branham's way of doing amen he taught that the new birth was a mess yes amen he said this in the deceit church by the world now we know all about that birth i don't care where it is or whereabouts it's a mess if it's a baby born on a ship pile on a hard floor or a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess anyhow a birth of a cat a birth of anything else is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess but people are so starchy well we'll go over there where they shake hands we'll go where they don't bawl and cry and beat on the altar and cry out we want to be too human what we need is a birth a dine out to bring forth life amen an old seed i know potato seed potato you take that potato put it in the ground until you can have new potatoes that old potato has to rot a corn cannot produce a new life until it's rotten and a man or woman will never have a new birth until their intellectuals and their own self is dead die out in the altar and scream and get all messed up to the place the starks gets out of your collar and you've been born again by the spirit of god i don't care if you squall speak in tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with his head off you're bringing forth new lives but we substituted something for it we wanted the classical way [Music] oh brother tim but that was before the seals and now you don't want me quoting what he said after the zeal deal by the way he used the same illustration all the way in 1965 and broken sisters but what about 1965 what what about when i was a little boy when i sat in like tabernacle you know i looked out at these new handrails that we got put up over here at our pavilion there going up those little steps and i thought about the kids and you know how we had to make them sturdy because little kids would get up and slide up and down on them you know we couldn't make them wobbly you know some of us our steps ain't quite as surprised they used to be and we need something steady to walk on and so i i i thought about brother james mitchell brother daryl and and and all the brothers all all of them wonder some of some of the best people in the world and they they they didn't just make a highway job they i mean they made it match everything on the building everything beautiful job but i thought about that i said i remember being a live tabernacle myself and this little boy sliding down those arm rails that's come out of that building i was a kid once myself so i kind of know what kids do but you see you know i was there when brother braden preached invisible union i was there when he preached the uh on the wings of a snow white dove i was there when he said i want an old-fashioned altar call that's why i still believe in altar calls i was there you can't take it from me i was there amen but anyway when he told us about an invisible union what brother jim an invisible union it takes place in the quiet and you know it takes place and no noise and it's all quiet and you know in the cover of everything that's uh what the invisible union you know no excitement no whatever and i say whatever but brother brad i'm saying if a woman won't have a baby for a husband she'll take a dog or a cat or something she's got a mother something it's a nature but to bear a child for a husband and raise it to the service of god that's entirely out of her line she said oh she would be disgraced if she did by our sin loving society of this 1965 type of women a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 2 38 youngins around her now i'm just going to tell you maybe an invisible union happens in the quiet but this is the results amen oh he said here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 2 38 youngins around her yeah yeah she don't wanted him whooping crying screaming amen hallelujah while such a child would immediately put her out her denomination that would not quit that in the churches why they throw her out right quick why are you letting such stuff go on is that it's a sad thing that we're now we're now having to quote that the message churches see she's pregnanted with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind the word will bring forth born to the spirit it has the spirit of god in no intellectual church joy and creed going bob had painted faces no such stuff is that at all in it you don't find that in the word of god you find an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost field child born to the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god something like a methodist meeting to me amen i wish that i wish some of these churches would at least be methodists in their worship like old betty robinson come on church amen you say i just want to say to you today have you had your pentecost where you got the victory over the works of the flesh you've got to cut them through the red sea and the blood where sin dies and the past masters of lust and pride and greed amen they all die and you sing a new song hallelujah listen the bible says when the seals were open they sang a new song i'll tell you then that should be our experience like moses had when he looked at himself the task masters are dead the army is gone the enemy is vanquished we're more than an overcomer hallelujah amen what did he do he wrote a new psalm he began to sing a new song they wasn't singing songs of their slavery they were singing songs of their victory hallelujah and that's what i want to know have you had your pentecost where you got the victory over the works of the flesh you've got to come to the red sea of the blood where sin dies where the taskmasters are dead let's let's let's look at exodus 15 verse 1. amen we've got just a few more minutes we're going to hang on for a minute exodus 15 and verse 1. then saying that moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord saying i will sing unto the lord for he a triumph gloriously the horse in his right ear hath the throne into the sea amen oh my this is their song they're singing a song of victory my old enemy is dead my sins are gone they're underneath the blood they're dead in the red sea amen the lord has triumphed gloriously he triumphed over my habits he triumphed over my ambition my pride my temper my works of the flesh come on he cried you got to have a victory you got to have a victory in your life you got to come to this pentecostal experience where you count and go through the red sea where your enemy is dead the lord is my strength in my song and he has become my salvation he is my god and i will prepare for him a habitation oh when it comes down when you sing this new song you'll say he is my salvation amen he is my god and my my god is no more heroes out here of sports my god is no more than a hero out here in politics they are not my heroes come on somebody it ain't hollywood it ain't the cheerleaders at school but my god my man my god is victorious he is he is my salvation i will prepare for him a place to live i'll let him come into my heart i will become the temple of the holy ghost me and god will become inseparable [Applause] amen my body is the temple of the holy ghost my father's god oh brother that speaks volumes the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob the god of elijah the god of daniel the god who is the i am that i am the god of william branham the god of buddy robinson amen he's my god amen i'll prepare him and habitation for my father's god and i will exalt him the lord is a man of war hallelujah do you know this god amen he's a man of war the lord jehovah is his name glory to god amen and even he magnified the name of jehovah when he became the savior amen pharaoh's terrorists in his house as he cast into the sea his chosen captains were also drowned in the red sea the death have covered them they spread they sank to the bottom as a stone thy right hand oh lord is become glorious and power thy right hand o lord has dashed in pieces the enemy don't you know what happened that right hand became flesh and it dwelt among us it cast out devils it healed the sick it healed the lame the death and the blind it triumphed over every sin come on it went down to hell and conquered death hell in the grave he dashed to pieces every sickness known to man hallelujah i'm talking about our lord the right hand of god the enemy to pieces your enemy has been death to pieces it doesn't matter what its name is it is cancer it's that's the pieces it is alopecia it's masterpieces whatever it is if it's luck if it's pride it's that the [Applause] to hallelujah he defeated it in hell he rose up over the tree he ascended on high he made a way into heaven for me it knew thy right hand the lord has become glorious in power and in the greatness of thy excellency thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sent us forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together and the floods stood upright as a heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said i will pursue and i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust that old lustful devil shall be satisfied upon them i'll throw my sword my hand shall destroy them but that was their famous last word not today satan this is god's moment he's looking down through the pillar of fire amen he's judging the enemy for what he is he's calling sin sin and wrong wrong and right right all you have to do is look at the grass battle that's going to take place amen before we go up you know revelation 12 shows the bride goes on up but satan has cast down we are the cause of satan's fall hallelujah did you hear what i said we are the cause of satan's father amen we have been brought to this age to this time for a reason for a purpose thou my god this blow with thy wind the seas covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious and holiness fearful and praises doing wonders that stretches out thy right hand the earth swallowed them thou i and thy mercy has led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou has guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation the people shall fear and be afraid and sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestine amen in other words demons will begin to tremble we have heard we have heard that an evening light tabernacle that a drunk came down to altar and got delivered gloriously delivered we have heard we have heard about young people who were found in sin and suicide spirits what's going to destroy them but we have heard we have heard what happens to devils and even in that tabernacle there's believers down there and they cast them out because they are under a commission the dukes of eden shall shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take a hold of them the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as lifeless or still as stone till thy people pass over oh lord to the people passover which thou hast purchased isn't this true in this what happened to him did rahab tell them the men i know the lord has given you the land and your terror has fallen upon us and all the inhabitants of the land i already fainted because of you as you are advancing devils are fainting as you are conquering a man the enemies are already quaking in their shoes the next devil that you're about to face is already running scared he's got his back on toward you and then he's running the opposite way amen my mama my my look at verse 17 thou shalt bring them in and plant them oh i love this plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance you're going to bring them right in you're going to put them right in a rapture you're going to take them right into the promised land amen to the marriage supper of the lamb in the place o lord which thou has made for thee to dwell in and that's in the sanctuary o lord which our hands has established the lord shall reign forever and ever i've got some good news for you not only are we going to defeat the devil and cast him out of heaven on our way up but on our way down we're coming by behind the one who is king of kings and lord of lords his name is called the word of god and behind him an army follows and we're coming to take this whole world back over again hallelujah satan you may have your heyday for a little while but i'll tell you your time is up you only got a short time you're angry you're mad but i tell you we're coming back to take it over again oh our lord is coming back to earth again amen oh lord thou hast made for thee to dwell in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands it prepared the lord shall reign forever and ever for the horse of the pharaoh went in with the chariots with his horsemen in the sea and brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea and mariam the prophetess oh hallelujah come on now look like they had gifts of the spirit among them and then the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out with her with timbrels and with dances and mariam answered them sing unto the you to the lord for he had triumphed glorious and that the horse and his rider had been thrown into the sea amen now you say well brother tim i just don't know about all this dancing and shouting and running i really don't think you have to do that well of course you don't nobody has to do that to be forced to have to do that would be babbling amen but i tell you if you see your enemies dead i don't know what you'll do you might climb the pole like buddy robinson in your jubilation you might run around the building like sister atlanta did because she saw she was leaning on the everlasting arms and that her enemy was dead and that put a depth in her step that caused her to rejoice amen i doubt i sincerely doubt you'll say well that was really nice wasn't it i'll tell you what you might speak in tongues like they did on the day of pentecost when they saw their enemy dead and they got filled with the spirit of god amen come on church amen brother branham said that angels are encamped about everything is order every wall can be took down it's already took down the sun of god goes before us his banners are waving there's nothing can stand in the way of a saint going to meet a promise of god oh i like that death can't stop it the grave can't stop it the devil can't stop that we're more than conquerors sickness is conquered for you friends death is conquered for you unbeliever once you receive him habits have been conquered for you temptation's been conquered you say i i've got a temper i can't get over it's conquered he's already conquered the great final seat of abraham there's no more conquering to do now he has conquered it for us that means all we have to do is follow him into battle for the battle is the lord and the lord is a mighty warrior amen brother branham told us over again he said that same angel of the lord that was there is the same angel of the covenant jesus christ leading the church today going from victory to victory yes amen now look look at israel going to the promised land it was not just egypt trying to bring them back but there was moab a cousin to them who wanted to stop them there was balak the king of moab that hired balaam to curse them and he would have except for the angel come on amen remember he said behold i sent an angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you the angel can't fail if the angel is here to bring us to the place that i have prepared that he will not fail at his task but whereof him obey his voice provoke him not for he will he will not pardon your transgression in other words he will not allow sin to go unpunished for my name is in him my name is in him can you imagine the name of the lord in the angel of the lord amen the name of jehovah was in this angel that is to say jehovah revealed himself in him and he's called in the bible the face of jehovah exodus 33 14 my presence shall go with thee that's literally my faith will go with you my presence my personal presence and i will give thee rest and he said if thy presence or thy face does not go with us don't lead us up from here let us stay here if you're not going with us we don't want to go now this angel of jehovah was not a creative spirit but it was the manifestation of jehovah himself and he went before them in a pillar of fire and a cloud you know and a cloud to guide them to defend them and we know now that it was christ that is the angel of jehovah this angel is frequently called jehovah elohim that's god this is plainly taught in in paul's gospel paul said neither let us tip christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the serpents amen is that right don't let us tell christ as some of them also were tempted and were destroyed at the serpents he called that angel christ amen he would rather suffer suffer the the the afflictions of the children of israel and the reproach of christ then enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season who was that in the wilderness it was christ is that right it was the pre-incarnate logos who would become flesh in jesus christ not another god the same god taking on human battles fighting your battles going through what you go through facing temptations you face is that right he couldn't do that as a pillar of fire he did that as a man now notice isaiah 63 and 8 says for he said surely they are my people children who will not lie in other words of people who'll be true to me he said they are my very own people surely they won't betray me so he became their savior in all their affliction he was affliction in their distress he was distressed and the angel of his presence or his face saved them and in his love and his pity he redeemed them and bear them and carried them all the days of old hallelujah mine angels shall go before thee and bring you to the amorites the hiptites the amorites the jebusites and i will cut them off i will utterly destroy them you're not to bow before they're gods of laodicea you're not to serve them you're not to do after their works thou shalt utterly overthrow them that is break down their images and then i've sent you a message so why is it you would rather listen and feed on the voices of hollywood than the voice of god i sent you a message why can't you believe it and walk in it i've vindicated it by an angel my angel has went before you to prepare the way you shall serve the lord your god he shall bless your bread and thy water and i will take sickness from the way from the midst of thee we're talking about the god that's with us i will take sickness away from thee he blessed them with their provisions their health their fruitfulness length of life where he said there shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in their land and the number of thy days i will fulfill and i will send my fear before thee and destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come and i will make thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and i will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the highlights and and the jebusite and the hittite from before thee amen and it goes on and said by little and by little i'm going to do this you'll advance and i'll help you advance father i mean you'll take a step and i'll clear the way i'm going to i'm going to do this until you are increased and you inherit all the land hallelujah you can look back at your life and you can say by little at my level he has been with me he helped me here he made that step for me he'll help me here he'll take me all the way till i inherit the land ever promised [Applause] without the angel israel would have never made it to the promised land he opened up the red sea that walked on dry land he then turned and then utterly destroyed the egyptian army he provided word the word of mount sinai come on when god's voice was heard from the mountain he provided water from the rock most unlikely place but that rock was christ amen he provided manna of bread from heaven and jesus is that bread that came from god out of heaven he provided protection from the curses of balaam he provided deliverance from the serpent's bite come on he was that angel who protected israel from from all the the the enemy he provided victory over the amalekites he then provided a passage on dry ground through the river jordan during the flood stage amen what was he showing as i was with moses so will i be with you amen he was the fourth man in the fiery furnace even nebuchadnezzar he said blessed be the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve or worship any god except their own god hallelujah he wants that angel that pillar of fire in the lines then with daniel somebody help me preach now trying to bring this down to a close as we as we look at these things in the scripture my god daniel said has sent his angel and shut the lion's mouth hallelujah he was that fire in the midst animals backed away from that fire amen here's the holy ghost that leads the church today as brother branham said that the legions and the powers and the backings of holy angels is in you was born into the deity of christ by the baptism of the holy ghost lord and god you not only got angels all around you you got the angel spirit of the holy ghost living on side of you the logos himself come on i want you to know this morning church he is our refuge amen the bible said there is none like unto the god of just siren that's in deuteronomy 33 26 just is the upright one this is a symbolic name for israel describing her ideal character when god talks about you he talks about you using his your the name jesus which is your ideal character amen it means they're an upright one a righteous one there is none like the god of the righteous ones who writes upon this upon the heavens and my health and his excellency upon the sky the eternal god is my refuge and underneath are this everlasting arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say destroy them hallelujah amen aren't you glad we have that refuge amen we're even more protected than they was because we're under not the blood of bulls and goats but the blood of jesus christ second samuel 22 2 said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation he is my high tower and my refuge he is my savior thou saveth me from violence i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so i shall be saved from mine enemies amen that don't sound like no quiet prayer to me everybody that don't sound like no badness you know formal way come on i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so i will be saved from my enemies amen he says the angel lord appeared there to get in and while he thrust weed and he says he and he says you know he said to him that mighty man of hour he said the lord is with you he said if god's with his word is miracles that's what a lot of people ought to be asking gideon knew enough if god was with us the miracles would be there if god is with you where are his miracles amen it was the angel of god then that would produce those miracles that would fight in their battles he would take 300 men against millions of midianites amen it was the angel of god that announced samson's birth gave him his great strength to deliver israel it was the angel that brought food and water to elijah who was exhausted laying under a juniper tree have you ever been there amen he went on the strength of that food that the angel brought him bread and water he went on that strength of that food for 40 days amen it was the angel god that slew 185 000 men in the for israel in the days of hezekiah god fought for them and the bible said in psalms 36 and 4 34 and 6 this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them oh taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man who trusteth in him hallelujah amen psalms 35 and one said plead my causal lord with them that strive with me fight against them that fight against me take hold of spear shield and buckler and stand up for my help a draw draw out also the spear and stop the way against them to persecute me say to my soul i am thy salvation let them be confounded and be put to shame that seek out to my soul let them be turned back and brought to confusion that defies my hurt let them be as chapped before the wind and let the angel of the lord chase them and let their way as they're running be dark and slippery and let the angel of the lord persecute them amen hallelujah it's time for the devil's persecution it's time to come and put the devil tormentors on the earth who know their god who do exploit amen who are there to make devil scream amen i've heard them scream i won't give up i won't i won't quit i won't give up i won't go out they did they did they made their posts but they did amen because why greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen psalm 68 17 said that chariots of god are 20 000 even thousands of angels the lord is among them as in sinai in the holy place that he ascended on high that thou has led captivity captive that thou received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also and the lord that the lord might dwell among them oh he said blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our salvation because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation for he shall give oh that said there shall be no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come now thy dwelling amen for he shall give angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and they shall bear thee up in their hands without dash of thy foot against a stone thou shall tread upon the lion and the adder the young lion and the dragon that shall trample under thy feet amen oh my this is it this is where we're at church amen there's a people whose god is the lord amen he's the angel of the covenant he's the one who appeared to zechariah and announced the promise coming that's right the promise coming of the fort rugger i'm talking about now our day we had an angel that also announced the promise coming of the forerunner didn't we amen it was the angel that would appear to to to marry and told her she would bring forth the messiah it was the angel who appeared to joseph three times hello amen first confirming the message given to mary that it was true second warning him to take the young child to egypt third to tell him to return back to israel fulfilling the scriptures again for out of israel thou has called i have called my son it was shepherds abiding in the field watching over their flock by night that the angel lord with the glory of the lord shining upon them that brought the tithing of great news i want you to understand this gospel was issued in by the announcement of angels an angel said come on amen an angel stood there and announced amen that of the tidings of great joy that a savior who is christ the lord has been born in the city of david the gospel that we believe the message we believe was issued in and announced by an angel are you with me amen and then after the angel's announcement suddenly there was a with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god saying glory to god in the highest and peace on earth and good will toward men hey man my goodness if you don't you don't if you don't believe jesus was god the bible said the angel said you'll find him wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger but it's christ the lord is that right he was prophesied to be god with us that ought to quell all the questions whether jesus is god or not amen he's god and with us behold a virgin shall be with child bring forth a son they shall call his name emmanuel which is interpreted god with us it was jesus now listen you think you're strong oh i got the holy ghost oh glory got the power of god well i don't need an angel anymore it was jesus when he was tempted of the devil that angels came and strengthened him hallelujah let me tell you even more it was angels who have watched over the elect ever since birth amen even before you were born matthew 10 tells us or 18 gems said take heed you despise not one of these little ones but i say to you that in heaven their angels their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven amen amen i want you to know brother branham didn't just have an angel that appeared to him you got an angel amen so when you were born your angel watches over you amen behold in your father's face pleading interceding on your behalf amen i like to think of it as the word that was thought of you is watching over you amen and you thought you walked out in front of that fiery car crash and you walked out of that by yourself no sir an angel was guarding over you amen and so there was an angel that attended your birth that watches over you all of your life and when you're born again there are angels that rejoice in heaven because you got saved and jesus said when you die the angels will carry you to paradise into abraham's bosom hallelujah angels all around you to keep you from harm amen angels all around you amen what was it it was angels it was angels that rolled away the stone amen you know jesus didn't roll away the stone when he rose up over death hell in the grave amanda an angel came and rolled away the stone he'll roll away the hindrance in your life he's there on your behalf this morning he's been watching over you he's guided you to this place come on church amen the bible said the angel lord descended from heaven came and rolled back the stone and held the door and then he sat upon it and when the angel sat upon it there was a no keeper that could come and pick it up and put it back when an angel sets up on the hinders of your life come on there ain't enough devils that can pick it up and put it back and seal you back in the tomb again come on it was angels two men and white apparel who said when jesus will send you why why do you stand gazing in the air this same jesus that you saw go away will come again like man amen oh my the bible said he'll come again with the angels of heaven come on didn't the bible say that amen and when they preached jesus and performed signs and wonders and the high priest locked the apostles in prison amen the angel of the lord opened the prison doors and brought him forth and and told him said go speak these words don't fear go speak these words in the temple or to the people of the words of life it was the angel of the that that visited philip the evangelist who was preaching a great revival down in samaria and the angel of the lord spoke to him amen it's going to rise and go south and you know to the to the way from jerusalem under gaza which is the desert and he meets the ethiopian and then after baptizing something happened to him and he was caught up in the spirit and transformed they found him miles away from there amen we're not talking about fanaticism we're talking about bible doctrine amen when peter was locked up in prison by herod the angel lord came upon him and the light shined in the prison and out of that light stepped an angel and loosed him from his prison bombs opened up prison doors he can do the same thing for you today he's the god who unlocks doors he said when i open it no man can shut it and when i said it no man can open it this is the god we serve are you with me amen it was the angel of god that appeared to saul on the road to damascus struck him down off his high horse and said he then he said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus i once was walking and listen amen to make it plain he said i am jesus of nazareth that's the bible amen i am jesus of nazareth acts 22 8 hey who are the lord and he said to me i am jesus of nazareth i'm the man who walked on the shores of galilee i am the one but now i returned back to the form that i was in before i came flesh i came from god i went back to being god again i took and became a man to bear the sin of man but now i return back to being god again and he said i am jesus amen oh my what a great thing amen and they locked peter up in prison you remember that we're just talking about it they locked him up in prison but i want you to know the angel wasn't through with just letting peter go look with me to acts 12 21 because there comes a time of payback to the devil herod had arrested him put him with a quadrillion of soldiers locked him up locked him in the inner prison and then right after this this man who says i'm going to kill peter on a saturday herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them and the people gave a shout saying it's the voice of a god not of a man and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave god not god the glory and he was eating the worms and gave up the growth ghost but let me tell you what happened with the word and the word the word of god grew and multiplied satan you ain't going to stop it you're coming you try to hinder you try to arrest the believers you try to put them in jail i'll get him in jail but not only that payback time praying back time you were going to kill him you meant his death but it's you herod the angel of god smotes you amen but the word of god grew and multiplied [Applause] hallelujah well the bible said in hebrews 12 22 but you are come to mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavily heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to so many angels you can't count hallelujah do you ever look in revelation in the book of revelation where it talks about those 300 000 000 supernatural devils released from euphrates this word is the same as that word is that's right and the king james has put you know three hundred thousand thousand just you know it's it's this insurmountable number here he says an innumerable man so now you think brother tim there's so many devils now there's more than ever but you have come to mount zion you are at the top of the mount ready to take every power that satan has away from him you have come to the city of the living god to the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable number company of angels there's more of us than there is of them come on church amen isn't that what elijah eliza found out when he looked out there and said boy you know you say we're surrounded but there's more of us we got more angels than they got men in their army and now what pharaoh found out there was more with god than what there was all the pharaoh's millions there's more for you little children this morning amen oh my this this is a day a wonderful hour that we're living this is the day of the seventh seal where the silence has been broken the mysteries are revealed first thunders which are sealed that was only silver time and this is the time where the ceiling is over now is the time the day that the voice of god is manifest and let the angels of god strengthen you today you who have been in battle you if you're sick and you're weary like elijah amen eat the food that's been provided by the angel to give you strength for the journey listen god hasn't left us without angel's food he left tape loads of it you've got a bible full of it [Applause] there's strength for the journey it's angel's food amen this bible was a book delivered by angels men moved by the holy ghost inspired by the spirit of god it's the book of angels this message was a message from an angel amen what we believe is a new testament doctrine amen we are following the angel no matter what's around you and how where you are the angels are watching over you no matter if it seems nice if it seems that right if it seems whatever if you've been lost in sin angels are watching over you ready to rejoice the moment you repent angels guarding over you you're not alone and innumerable that's right you can't count them all one angel would have been all that jesus would have needed that's right but he said i could call 80 000 of them 12 legions of angels and in a moment they would come to me that's what he could do as the son of god and then you think the devil's come along and says your cry means nothing to the master it's during the angels brother branham talked about the commotion in heaven when the angels looked down said have you been watching what's on earth god there's some of your children three of them stood for you down there yeah chad like me sack in the bed they've stood for you and they're fixing to die let me go down i'll destroy him no no i'm not going to let you go down he talks about another wormwood i'm the one i'm the angel over the waters i can just i can just send a flood right now and just flood out and put the fire out no no you're a great angel but it's not your job it's my job he said he reached up and he got him bolt of light and you know brother branham in his figurative way he swung down off of that onto a cloud for chariots rode down there with his majestic majestic garments flapping in the wind and there in the nick of time he stood there it wasn't too late he appears right in the fiery furnace he's with you in your triumph i will never leave you fighting alone angels watching over you before you were born when you were born when you were born again when you die some foolish man said one time where was that angel when william branham there where was that angel when when william branham was in that car wreck and died i said he was there took him from this dimension right into another like asking where was that angel when john the baptist's head got cut off he was right there the angel that announced his birth was there to take him across the river he'll be right here for you you're not fighting alone amen the god you serve is a man of war and when he sees his children tormented it makes him angry i've heard the cry of the task masters and i have come down to deliver let the musicians go you're not alone you're not by yourself you're not going to have to whip the devil by yourself it's too big for you there's too many of them but i can do all things through christ that strengthens me take a little more of that lamb eat some more that lamb for the journey take another another bite of that angel spread let it feel your being till you have overcoming power on the inside the strength to meet the enemy i've been filled with the holy ghost brother tim i'm i'm strong in the lord and i've got the power of christ in me and so did jesus but when he met the devil he needs strengthening oh if you're weary this morning won't you let him strengthen you won't you let the angels of god just come around you right now breathe life into you strengthened to you joy peace will you bow your heads just a moment i've been a long life's journey brother tim and it's been so hard i get so confused i hear them say oh pray this way or do this that
