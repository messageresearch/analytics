[1:01:47] he's the God who cares
[1:01:50] let's turn to Genesis 18 and verse 9 for
[1:01:53] our scripture reading this morning if
[1:01:55] you will look at this together
[1:01:58] Genesis 18 and verse 9.
[1:02:01] and they said unto him where is Sarah
[1:02:04] thy wife and he said behold in the tent
[1:02:06] and he said I will surely return unto
[1:02:08] thee according to the time of life and
[1:02:10] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:02:14] of course I believe this is the time of
[1:02:17] life where God is appearing to his
[1:02:20] church
[1:02:21] amen we uh we sang the song you know a
[1:02:25] moment ago all that is within me cries
[1:02:28] you know that God be glorified and that
[1:02:31] is God God with us but you know we're
[1:02:35] really entered into a time where it's
[1:02:37] God in us
[1:02:40] amen he's not only just God with us but
[1:02:43] he's God in us and he said I'll never
[1:02:45] I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll
[1:02:48] be right there with you to the end of
[1:02:49] the world and you look here in this
[1:02:51] promise here he said I will return unto
[1:02:55] thee and um then if you'll turn with me
[1:02:58] to Revelation 5 and verse 1 we want to
[1:03:01] read from here Revelation 5 and verse 1.
[1:03:06] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:03:08] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:03:11] and on the backside sealed with Seven
[1:03:13] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[1:03:15] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:03:17] worthy to open the book and loose this
[1:03:20] seal stir off and no man in the Heaven
[1:03:23] Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:03:25] I able to open the book neither to look
[1:03:27] their own
[1:03:28] and I wept much because no man was found
[1:03:31] worthy to open to read the book neither
[1:03:34] to look there on and one of the elders
[1:03:37] said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of
[1:03:40] the tribe of Judah the root of David
[1:03:42] hath prevailed to open the book in the
[1:03:44] loose the Seven Seals thereof and I
[1:03:47] beheld and low in the midst of the
[1:03:48] throne and of the four beasts in the
[1:03:50] midst of the elders to the lamb as it
[1:03:53] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:03:55] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:03:57] of God sent forth into all the Earth
[1:04:00] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:04:03] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:04:05] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:04:07] The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty
[1:04:09] Elders fell down before the lamb of
[1:04:11] Heaven every one of them Harps and
[1:04:13] golden vials full of odors which are the
[1:04:16] prayers of the Saints and they sung a
[1:04:19] new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take
[1:04:22] the book and to open the seals thereof
[1:04:25] for thou was slain and has redeemed us
[1:04:28] to God by that blood out of every
[1:04:31] Kindred and tongue and people and nation
[1:04:34] and has made us unto our God Kings and
[1:04:38] Priests and we shall reign upon the
[1:04:42] Earth and then then run over to
[1:04:45] Revelation chapter 10 and verse 8 we're
[1:04:48] going to read from here before you're
[1:04:51] seated and the voice which I heard from
[1:04:54] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:04:57] and take the little book which is open
[1:04:59] notice it was closed in Revelation 5 and
[1:05:03] no man was worthy to look upon it but it
[1:05:05] was taken by the intercessor the lamb
[1:05:09] the mediator between God and man God
[1:05:12] became
[1:05:13] God became a man that he might as man
[1:05:18] win back for man that which man lost so
[1:05:22] the book the title that man lost Jesus
[1:05:26] redeemed it for us as a man for man
[1:05:29] notice he did not need this for God as
[1:05:32] God because he owns everything
[1:05:35] but he needed it man needed he had lost
[1:05:39] a title to the Earth the title to his
[1:05:42] own Earth his own body
[1:05:44] and so there again
[1:05:46] um if you look and see at this now the
[1:05:49] little book is open
[1:05:50] in the hand of the Angel we standeth
[1:05:53] upon the Sea and the Earth and I went up
[1:05:56] to the angel and said give me the little
[1:05:58] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[1:06:01] it up and it shall be and make that
[1:06:03] belly bitter it shall be in thy mouth as
[1:06:06] sweet as honey and I took the little
[1:06:08] book out of the Angel's hands and ate it
[1:06:11] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:06:14] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[1:06:16] was bitter and he said unto me that must
[1:06:19] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:06:22] Nations and tongues and Kings God bless
[1:06:26] you can be seated
[1:06:28] I'm going to speak this morning on Sarah
[1:06:31] take the book
[1:06:33] now you know we have been we have been
[1:06:37] speaking about Sarah because she and
[1:06:39] Abraham is a prophecy
[1:06:41] of the church in the last day
[1:06:45] so she of course is representing the
[1:06:48] church who in the last days to take the
[1:06:51] book of inheritance and to receive it
[1:06:55] but Sarah in the tent of course had
[1:06:57] given up uh the right to be the mother
[1:07:00] of the abrahamic race her name was not
[1:07:04] even to be in the book
[1:07:06] instead of Hagar and Egyptian slave girl
[1:07:10] had taken her place
[1:07:12] and if things had continued the way it
[1:07:14] was Hagar and not Sarah would be in the
[1:07:18] abrahamic Book of Life
[1:07:21] and so now God has to get Sarah in
[1:07:25] agreement with the word
[1:07:28] with the promise of God and she had to
[1:07:31] see herself not some Hagar but she had
[1:07:35] to see herself in the book
[1:07:38] and she had to believe that it was for
[1:07:41] her and it was for her age
[1:07:43] um to fulfill and it was her promise to
[1:07:47] fulfill now she was at an age of time
[1:07:50] she had actually ran out of time she was
[1:07:53] now 90 years old and it already seemed
[1:07:56] to be too late by all by all the
[1:08:00] sensible thinking or reasonable thinking
[1:08:02] it was already too late
[1:08:04] and she's certainly now at this time
[1:08:07] cannot push the Fulfillment off to
[1:08:10] another day because um at 90 years old
[1:08:14] there's not a lot of days left
[1:08:16] and and I wanted to say that where we
[1:08:19] are in time that we are here in the last
[1:08:22] Church age and now this last Church age
[1:08:26] has existed the same amount of time as
[1:08:29] the first church age of 117 years and so
[1:08:34] again we we are run out of time this is
[1:08:39] the uh we we don't have time for another
[1:08:42] generation or another set of church ages
[1:08:45] you know everything has reached its end
[1:08:48] this is where we are and uh so like
[1:08:52] Sarah who has had was at an age where
[1:08:57] she had run out of time and it already
[1:08:59] seemed too late so for us it almost
[1:09:02] seems too late that we're way over into
[1:09:05] overtime somewhere
[1:09:07] and of course we know that as I have
[1:09:10] spoken Services past that with the
[1:09:13] coming of the Lord there is that word
[1:09:15] delay where that men will say the Lord
[1:09:18] hath the late is coming so that that in
[1:09:22] the very midst of time there are even
[1:09:25] Junctions of time where seemed like
[1:09:28] nothing is happening for for a bit as
[1:09:32] I've explained from the time word the
[1:09:35] angel came to Zachariah and simeon's
[1:09:37] prophecy and Anna's prophecy and and
[1:09:40] Jesus birth and all of these events that
[1:09:43] took place then for about 30 years it
[1:09:46] was nothing happened and except a little
[1:09:50] Glimpse that we have of Jesus at the
[1:09:52] temple at the age of 12 and so you know
[1:09:55] again when you look at it there there
[1:09:58] will be times of of where there's great
[1:10:01] things happening as we saw even in the
[1:10:04] intent Revival of brother branham's a
[1:10:07] great things happen in Dental lull and
[1:10:10] then the word Break Forth in great
[1:10:12] Revelations come forth and then and then
[1:10:16] a law and then you know Revelation
[1:10:18] strike the bride of Christ and an
[1:10:21] understanding come and then a law and
[1:10:24] and you know it's so you know what what
[1:10:26] we must do is not give up on the promise
[1:10:30] amen just because that we see a lull or
[1:10:34] a time of silence or a time where it
[1:10:37] seemed like God is not moving and
[1:10:39] remember this even in your own personal
[1:10:41] walk that there be those times that seem
[1:10:44] like God is a million miles away but you
[1:10:48] never give up on the promise of God you
[1:10:50] keep believing you keep expecting God to
[1:10:54] move on the scene on your behalf amen to
[1:10:58] reveal himself to you now the coming of
[1:11:01] the promised son was past due it seemed
[1:11:04] like it would never happen and so has it
[1:11:07] been with the church that every move of
[1:11:09] God you know has seemingly in the past
[1:11:12] just become another Ishmael the son of a
[1:11:16] slave girl another denominational move
[1:11:19] and Men settled down to just um well we
[1:11:23] thought it was going to be the Revival
[1:11:25] that would produce the the the coming
[1:11:28] son but it just produced a son of the
[1:11:31] slave girl another denomination another
[1:11:34] child of the bonds woman and uh so and
[1:11:38] while brother Bradham felt certain that
[1:11:40] would be no denomination that would
[1:11:43] follow this you know that we we find
[1:11:46] that denominationalism and its
[1:11:49] sectarianism has done its damage and it
[1:11:52] has divided us you know sectarianism is
[1:11:56] when a group of people is devoted to
[1:11:59] particularly narrow tradition or belief
[1:12:02] system and and they those who carefully
[1:12:04] adhere to one particular sect they'll
[1:12:07] actually feel hatred or bigotry toward
[1:12:11] those of other sex and you know it's
[1:12:14] like a little cancer a little cancer
[1:12:17] comes in there first it's a spirit and
[1:12:20] remember this when we go to dealing with
[1:12:22] things first of all everything you know
[1:12:25] the origin of it is a spirit
[1:12:28] even sickness in your body that's a
[1:12:31] spirit Jesus never did say
[1:12:33] um you know you epilepsy go he said thou
[1:12:36] devil go you know he never he never
[1:12:39] dealt with even the paralytic one he
[1:12:42] never did say
[1:12:43] um you know uh and call it by his
[1:12:46] scientific name he he would say you know
[1:12:49] that demon loose her and let her go you
[1:12:53] know all of these things you know he
[1:12:55] recognized it to be a spirit
[1:12:58] and uh so he said that little cancer
[1:13:01] comes in versus the spirit then it gets
[1:13:04] into backslidden cell or bruised cell or
[1:13:08] cell that's not operating right and
[1:13:10] that's what happens in the church when
[1:13:12] he when he gets someone failing to
[1:13:15] operate with the church Someone failing
[1:13:17] pulling off and getting indifferent
[1:13:20] that's a cancer in the church it's a
[1:13:23] devil in that person and that causes the
[1:13:25] whole church to be sick over it and of
[1:13:29] course as we look at the the church
[1:13:32] today uh of course that the church has
[1:13:36] been in a very sickened condition
[1:13:38] because of denominationalism and
[1:13:41] sectarianism even within the message as
[1:13:45] we pull off in our little camps rather
[1:13:47] than staying with the pure word of God
[1:13:50] and today the sons of Ishmael on a
[1:13:53] natural scene they fight as a cancer
[1:13:56] Over The Inheritance that belongs to
[1:13:59] Israel on the spiritual side how many
[1:14:03] ishmaels have risen up dividing the body
[1:14:06] and causing hatred and bigotry but you
[1:14:10] see you see again today there's where it
[1:14:14] wants to come right down to just point
[1:14:17] out and make us think that some man-made
[1:14:20] move that it all gravitated toward is
[1:14:23] was really God's purpose and God's
[1:14:26] design but I want you to know that that
[1:14:29] was never God's purpose God had never
[1:14:33] ordained an ishmaelite he he blessed it
[1:14:37] and he said I will bless it I'll I'll
[1:14:39] honor your efforts and all of that but
[1:14:42] that was never my promise my promise was
[1:14:46] never to to bring a message and it just
[1:14:49] died down in a little denominational
[1:14:50] move and and a little sector out there
[1:14:54] that is isolated from everybody else my
[1:14:58] promise was was to bring forth Jesus
[1:15:01] Christ back to the church
[1:15:04] amen now so so again you know the
[1:15:07] thinking of Sarah comes uh you know that
[1:15:11] the the anointing well that's for Hagar
[1:15:14] they they're the anointed ones at the
[1:15:17] end time and then we want nothing to do
[1:15:20] with the anointing because we see over
[1:15:23] here Hagar blessed and you know she had
[1:15:26] Angelic visions and and visitations and
[1:15:29] the voice that God spoke to her and so
[1:15:33] then we want to Discount the voice of
[1:15:34] God and and God the Angelic visit well
[1:15:38] it's never happened to me you know I'm
[1:15:40] Sarah and it's never happened to me so
[1:15:43] you see that's the for the false
[1:15:45] anointed one no it is for the true
[1:15:48] anointing and today Sarah is having her
[1:15:52] visitation from the angel of God God did
[1:15:56] not believe her alone neither did he
[1:15:59] just put the anointing upon the false
[1:16:01] but the anointing was actually set for
[1:16:05] the true elect that's who the anointing
[1:16:08] is for amen so you see again she would
[1:16:12] think you know the anointing that's for
[1:16:15] the Ishmael that's for the bombs woman
[1:16:17] that's for the denomination we don't
[1:16:20] want to have the anointing but Christ
[1:16:22] the son of man the word said no Sarah it
[1:16:25] is for you and it is for your children
[1:16:28] it is anointing to break the Yoke of
[1:16:31] unbelief all of your life it is the
[1:16:33] anointing that comes down to prepare you
[1:16:36] for a body change it is the anointing
[1:16:38] that we have received Grace upon Grace
[1:16:41] and but favor upon favor you are not a
[1:16:45] people void at the anointing Sarah you
[1:16:49] are a people that the anointing was set
[1:16:51] for
[1:16:51] [Applause]
[1:16:55] well I was speaking in tongues and
[1:16:57] prophecy and Gifts in the spirit uh
[1:16:59] that's for the the Israelites the
[1:17:01] Pentecostals that's only for Azusa
[1:17:04] Street just let's let Hague Gardner's
[1:17:06] Sons to doubt they're the heir of the
[1:17:08] promise you know Divine Healing that was
[1:17:11] for tent meetings and and healing
[1:17:13] revivals of the 40s and 50s it's it's
[1:17:16] not possible today we're too mature
[1:17:19] we're we're beyond that it's you know
[1:17:21] those uh expectations of Miracles can't
[1:17:26] be in the church we don't expect any
[1:17:28] Miracles we're too old for that no Sarah
[1:17:32] that's your story amen just as a deep
[1:17:36] mystery truth of the word are yours so
[1:17:40] are the promises of the spirit are yours
[1:17:43] amen you see Sarah had to take the book
[1:17:47] for herself she had to quit looking off
[1:17:50] to another age and realized the promise
[1:17:54] is now
[1:17:57] that's where I want you today
[1:18:00] I want you to begin to look at the
[1:18:02] promise as being now
[1:18:04] We cannot put it off
[1:18:06] we cannot be you know if you want to say
[1:18:10] you know well you're like the the
[1:18:12] Pentecostals you that's what you are
[1:18:14] brother Tim you're just like the
[1:18:16] Pentecostals no the Pentecostals are
[1:18:18] praising God for what he did and
[1:18:21] thanking the lord what what he's going
[1:18:23] to do but ignoring what he's doing today
[1:18:26] I'm saying today we are in the bride's
[1:18:29] Revival I am saying today amen the
[1:18:33] anointing is here I am saying that today
[1:18:36] is a day of Miracles a day of where not
[1:18:40] just mysteries of Truth are revealed oh
[1:18:43] of a great great Revelations of the word
[1:18:46] but the mystery truths of healing and
[1:18:49] miracles and signs and wonders are also
[1:18:53] ours
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:18:58] we got to quit trying to pass it back to
[1:19:01] Hagar
[1:19:03] that's for Pentecost that falling out in
[1:19:06] the spirit that was only for the
[1:19:07] methodists that's like saying Believing
[1:19:10] on Christ is only for the Baptist
[1:19:13] you see none of the promised word is
[1:19:16] close to her
[1:19:18] it has been opened
[1:19:20] and this is what Sarah has to do is take
[1:19:24] the book
[1:19:25] the whole book
[1:19:29] denominations have been built on partial
[1:19:31] truths
[1:19:33] the reason why we're not building a
[1:19:35] denomination and going to Rapture and
[1:19:38] we're going into a Rapture is because we
[1:19:41] are not building on partial truths
[1:19:43] partial truth causes denominations but
[1:19:47] when the fullness of the word comes it's
[1:19:49] a quickening power to Rapture and that's
[1:19:52] where we are
[1:19:55] now
[1:19:57] in condemnation by representation I'd
[1:20:00] like to share brother Brandon's prayer
[1:20:01] granted father heal all the sick and The
[1:20:04] Afflicted

[1:20:08] type of people today

[1:20:14] old-fashioned Revival he said the

[1:20:41] different manifestations not make
[1:20:43] believe nor try to believe or put on may

[1:22:20] one who the angel is trying to hand it
[1:22:22] to and John is representing the church
[1:22:25] and as he does as he does there he is
[1:22:29] told and commanded to take the book
[1:22:35] amen this is what he was saying to Sarah
[1:22:37] he was coming to bring her recognition
[1:22:42] amen that the book of inheritance that
[1:22:46] she had given away
[1:22:49] to Hagar was hers
[1:22:53] and that she couldn't give it away
[1:22:57] come on church she could not give it
[1:23:00] away God would never recognize it he had
[1:23:03] a name in that book

[1:23:06] and it wasn't Hagar the name in that
[1:23:09] book was Sarah come on now and none of
[1:23:13] her I believe was gonna erase it out of
[1:23:16] that book
[1:23:17] [Applause]
[1:23:20] look at this book
[1:23:22] Sarah your name is in it
[1:23:24] when did it get there
[1:23:26] when did my name get there when I
[1:23:29] started believing no
[1:23:31] down there at the altar when I prayed
[1:23:33] through no
[1:23:36] listen if you're let me let me make this
[1:23:40] clear if your salvation is in the
[1:23:42] temporary then your salvation is only
[1:23:45] temporary
[1:23:47] but if your salvation was in the
[1:23:49] eternals
[1:23:51] then your salvation is eternal
[1:23:55] right amen so again you see again when
[1:23:59] it didn't happen when I started
[1:24:01] believing it if if it got wrote when you
[1:24:06] started believing then it can be taken
[1:24:08] off when you start doubting
[1:24:13] and I want to give something new all her
[1:24:15] doubting
[1:24:17] and put it off to somebody else
[1:24:21] did not erase her name off the boat
[1:24:25] when God has a plan and he's
[1:24:29] predestinated a people
[1:24:31] they ain't enough devils in hell that's
[1:24:33] going to stop it
[1:24:35] Hallelujah his word will prevail of your
[1:24:40] doubt over your fear of your unbelief
[1:24:50] God did not just now find out you were
[1:24:52] coming
[1:24:53] your names was written in heaven before
[1:24:56] the foundation of the world that's the
[1:24:59] Bible
[1:25:01] amen God did not just start compiling
[1:25:04] this book
[1:25:06] that's why we've had to change a few a
[1:25:09] few words in some of the songs is
[1:25:11] because you know there there again it's
[1:25:14] it's sung with a with a denominational
[1:25:17] Twist of uh there's a new name you know
[1:25:20] written in glory in his in his mind yes
[1:25:23] it's mine no his the name wasn't written
[1:25:25] when you were at the altar
[1:25:27] the name was written in the Lamb's Book
[1:25:30] of Life
[1:25:31] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:34] and God can't change his mind about you
[1:25:39] [Applause]
[1:25:42] amen you can't make a mistake and God
[1:25:44] acts you off his list
[1:25:46] and scratch your name out
[1:25:49] now if he said you would be there you're
[1:25:52] going to be there if he predestined
[1:25:55] Sarah to be the mother of this race and
[1:25:57] in the book
[1:25:58] at some point she was gonna have to take
[1:26:01] the book and see her name in it
[1:26:07] even though it was too late
[1:26:09] 90 years old
[1:26:11] but with God he's always on time
[1:26:15] he's never too late
[1:26:20] this could Ephesians chapter 1
[1:26:23] and verse 3.
[1:26:26] why don't you just give me verse
[1:26:28] one
[1:26:29] and I'll start there Ephesians 1 and 1.
[1:26:34] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:26:37] by the will of God
[1:26:39] not by The Calling a man
[1:26:41] to the Saints
[1:26:43] we don't become Saints after we die
[1:26:45] we're already Saints
[1:26:48] a man with a Sanctified ones
[1:26:51] which are at Ephesus and to the faithful
[1:26:54] in Christ Jesus
[1:26:58] Grace me to you and peace from God our
[1:27:00] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:04] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:27:06] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[1:27:09] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:27:13] places
[1:27:14] in Christ Jesus
[1:27:16] now this this was this was exactly the
[1:27:20] position of the first church
[1:27:23] the last day church has to come back to
[1:27:26] that same position
[1:27:28] where that they are blessed with all
[1:27:31] spiritual blessings in their position in
[1:27:34] Christ
[1:27:36] amen that's what the message does for
[1:27:39] you it positions you in Christ it makes
[1:27:41] you know you were you're not an accident
[1:27:46] God then just certainly suddenly think
[1:27:48] of you he already had your life
[1:27:50] pre-planned
[1:27:52] and he knew exactly the moment that
[1:27:55] would be right to interrupt sin
[1:27:58] amen and interrupted the curse that was
[1:28:02] upon your life from your natural birth
[1:28:04] he knew exactly the moment to step into
[1:28:07] your life
[1:28:09] hey man it looked like it was too late
[1:28:11] for Sarah but it was the exact moment
[1:28:14] for God just trapped into that life
[1:28:17] and take the book and say here it is
[1:28:20] see your name in it Sarah take this book
[1:28:24] it is your inheritance
[1:28:27] it's not for the Baptist the Methodist
[1:28:29] the Presbyterian the Catholic the
[1:28:31] children of of Ishmael it is not theirs
[1:28:35] it's your inheritance
[1:28:41] now
[1:28:42] so see who he's addressing here
[1:28:45] now he's not addressing a bunch of
[1:28:47] babies these are the Saints
[1:28:49] these are the faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:28:51] they have been set in Heavenly places
[1:28:54] and they have been blessed
[1:28:57] and he you know in the end he says you
[1:29:00] know something you've been taught you've
[1:29:02] been saved but I want to tell you what
[1:29:04] it's all about I want you to put your
[1:29:06] feet up in the heavens a little while
[1:29:07] instead of being so EarthBound
[1:29:11] and I want to give you a little
[1:29:13] something that a little boost a Revival
[1:29:15] a little stimulation that kind of builds
[1:29:19] you up especially when you know it's the
[1:29:21] word of the lord it's thus saith the
[1:29:23] Lord
[1:29:24] not want to speak to you you that said
[1:29:26] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus been
[1:29:29] blessed together with all spiritual
[1:29:31] blessings the gifts of God manifesting
[1:29:34] Divine Healing prophecies everything
[1:29:36] going forth now you're grown up people
[1:29:38] now listen these are the kind that are
[1:29:40] grown up people
[1:29:42] that's what the early church was
[1:29:45] they were grown up so this was there
[1:29:47] and he said I want to talk to you I want
[1:29:49] to address this to you I want you to
[1:29:51] know you were chosen
[1:29:54] in him before the foundation of the
[1:29:57] world
[1:29:59] you're chosen for this moment
[1:30:02] for this moment in time
[1:30:04] no matter what the circumstances are you
[1:30:07] have been chosen now of course of course
[1:30:10] you have chosen Us in him
[1:30:14] now who did well you know I tell you
[1:30:16] what it was I heard the altar calling
[1:30:19] and I came let me tell you you didn't
[1:30:21] even seek out to God
[1:30:23] the Bible said that no man seeketh after
[1:30:26] God no not one if there's a hungry in
[1:30:30] your heart
[1:30:31] amen that there is a God that is calling
[1:30:35] upon you knocking at your heart you
[1:30:39] never sought God God sought you
[1:30:41] [Applause]
[1:30:46] salvations of the Lord all of it
[1:30:49] wasn't what you did is what he did
[1:30:53] when you were unlovable he loves you
[1:30:57] amen when he knew he was on the cross
[1:30:59] the song says you were on his mind
[1:31:02] but before all of that before the world
[1:31:04] began you were on his mind
[1:31:07] you were chosen
[1:31:09] amen you were chosen in Christ before
[1:31:12] the foundation of the world so you have
[1:31:15] chosen just to make sure you understand
[1:31:17] failure is not your name
[1:31:21] and My Chosen is your name
[1:31:24] you have chosen
[1:31:27] do you see this in the Bible you are
[1:31:29] chosen this is your identity you were
[1:31:32] chosen
[1:31:34] part of him
[1:31:36] before the foundation of the world so
[1:31:39] failure is not like your name so don't
[1:31:41] identify yourself with your past
[1:31:46] that's not your identity
[1:31:49] amen your name isn't defeat
[1:31:52] amen Well it can't be me I you know
[1:31:55] Sarah said I'm unworthy I'm worthy ain't
[1:31:57] your name
[1:31:59] quit saying that's who you are
[1:32:02] well I'll never do it don't don't say
[1:32:04] that that's not you
[1:32:07] don't call yourself names that the Bible
[1:32:09] doesn't call you
[1:32:11] the Bible calls you the faithful in
[1:32:13] Christ Jesus the chosen in him the
[1:32:17] Beloved of the Lord elect of God
[1:32:20] predestined from the foundations of the
[1:32:22] world this is what God calls of you this
[1:32:25] is what he thinks about you your name is
[1:32:28] chosen and you and you say well but I'm
[1:32:30] unworthy you know unworthy is not your
[1:32:33] name
[1:32:35] amen your your name is not unworthy You
[1:32:39] Are Holy
[1:32:42] look at look in First Peter 1 16 but he
[1:32:45] that called you is Holy so be you holy
[1:32:47] in all manner walks of life or
[1:32:50] conversation because it is written be ye
[1:32:53] holy for I am Holy
[1:32:56] so he said for you to be holy
[1:33:01] not be defeat
[1:33:03] not be unbelief
[1:33:05] be holy blame us you were chosen in
[1:33:09] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:33:11] world now he did not choose you because
[1:33:14] you were blameless
[1:33:16] he chose you to be blameless
[1:33:20] amen he chose you listen he never said
[1:33:23] you're blameless and you're you're you
[1:33:26] know hey I I really got something here
[1:33:28] to work with here Sarah you know you're
[1:33:30] a 90 year old woman this is gonna this
[1:33:33] is really something to work with God
[1:33:35] said I'm not looking at your 90 year old
[1:33:37] condition
[1:33:38] I'm not looking at your past failures
[1:33:40] I'm not looking how many monthlies had
[1:33:43] passed and nothing happened and there
[1:33:45] was no praying I'm not looking at your
[1:33:47] past I am looking right now in the book
[1:33:52] and the book says you are the mother of
[1:33:54] this new race the abrahamic race the
[1:33:58] people that believe God
[1:34:02] in fact the matter is your name is joy
[1:34:06] amen because once Sarah got to believe
[1:34:08] and she started having Joy spells
[1:34:12] Hallelujah when you start believing
[1:34:14] you'll start having Joy spells
[1:34:17] amen see even that dancing spells
[1:34:20] amen remember the reason I'm having
[1:34:22] dancing spells the reason I'm shouting
[1:34:25] is because I've seen my name in The Book
[1:34:29] of Life from the foundation of the world
[1:34:31] that's what made Sarah rejoice
[1:34:36] no better woman had nothing to Rejoice
[1:34:39] about sitting in the tent
[1:34:41] Hagar's took her place it smells become
[1:34:44] the son
[1:34:46] she's totally outside of the book
[1:34:50] the book of The Inheritance looks like
[1:34:52] his left her out
[1:34:55] but that was man's thoughts
[1:34:57] that never was God's thoughts God's
[1:34:59] thinking was I haven't let you out
[1:35:02] in fact I've included you in the last
[1:35:05] day when the church gets so old and so
[1:35:08] decrepit and so unbelieving and so
[1:35:11] bitter in her unbelief that in that
[1:35:14] moment I'm gonna take and bring a
[1:35:16] message back that is going to transform
[1:35:18] her back to being a young person again
[1:35:21] that she'll be the same as when she was
[1:35:24] married on the day of Pentecost
[1:35:27] Hallelujah a new bride
[1:35:35] Jesus said to his disciples who rejoice
[1:35:38] in and they were rejoicing because
[1:35:40] demons was was subject to them and he
[1:35:43] said don't just Rejoice about that
[1:35:46] you know that that's great to see Devils
[1:35:48] cast out and they were they were subject
[1:35:50] to you through my name that's wonderful
[1:35:52] but that's not not what I want you to
[1:35:55] rejoice and I want you to Rejoice over
[1:35:57] something bigger and better than that
[1:35:59] and that is you rejoice that your name
[1:36:02] is written in heaven
[1:36:07] now
[1:36:09] for those that are against Charlie
[1:36:11] when the lamb opened a book the whole
[1:36:15] universe shouted
[1:36:18] and if the message of his coming don't
[1:36:20] make you shout then maybe you're one of
[1:36:22] those Pharisees that want to crucify
[1:36:25] Jesus but if we hold our peace the rocks
[1:36:28] will immediately cry out somebody's got
[1:36:30] to do it
[1:36:32] it's going to set somebody with
[1:36:34] stimulation of Revelation amen that it
[1:36:38] caused them to shout and to dance and
[1:36:41] rejoice over what God's done in the end
[1:36:43] time
[1:36:47] now
[1:36:50] you know I again
[1:36:52] how can I help it
[1:36:54] how can I help but Shout
[1:36:57] it's part of the script
[1:37:00] it's what's been written to me it's
[1:37:01] written in the book
[1:37:04] that Sarah laughed
[1:37:07] that Sarah rejoiced come on somebody hey
[1:37:11] man it was written in the book of Sarah

[1:37:23] you know just take this book
[1:37:26] and look at the book
[1:37:28] because in the buck it is written that
[1:37:32] Sarah will have this son and it's going
[1:37:35] to cause her to Rejoice that even her
[1:37:38] Offspring will be called laughter
[1:37:41] because God has made us to rejoice
[1:37:45] amen or stop this rejoicing and shouting
[1:37:49] brother Jim and those young people going
[1:37:51] wild sometimes let me just tell you well

[1:38:01] on somebody he made them to rejoice
[1:38:05] how can we stop rejoicing when God made
[1:38:09] us to rejoice
[1:38:15] I was seen in the Bible

[1:38:40] he said and when I see that I was about
[1:38:43] there shouting and I am now here in time
[1:38:46] doing what I did in eternity
[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:38:55] because in the Eternal ages before in
[1:38:57] God's mind he saw me shouting
[1:39:00] he saw me rejoicing over a message
[1:39:05] service over a visitation when the son
[1:39:08] of man came the word came and when it
[1:39:11] came it made me rejoice
[1:39:13] so you see the sons of God shouted for
[1:39:15] joy
[1:39:16] brother Benham said I was preaching one
[1:39:18] night and a woman got to screaming and
[1:39:20] shouting the little Baptist brother told
[1:39:22] me the next day I was enjoying your
[1:39:25] message till that woman went to
[1:39:26] screaming you know that make chills run
[1:39:28] over my back and I said brother you're
[1:39:31] living in the quietest world you ever
[1:39:33] lived in
[1:39:35] you don't like shouting here you ain't
[1:39:37] gonna want to go to heaven
[1:39:39] amen if you go to hell he said there
[1:39:42] will be weeping in Wayland And national
[1:39:44] teams there's going to be noise in hell
[1:39:45] if you go to heaven they'll be screaming
[1:39:48] and shouting all the time while he said
[1:39:50] if that made children I've been down
[1:39:52] your back he said what will it do when
[1:39:54] you get to heaven you'll freeze to death
[1:39:56] when you get there you'll be so out of
[1:39:58] place because even angels with wings
[1:40:00] over their face and hands and over their
[1:40:03] feet and over their face are singing
[1:40:05] holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy
[1:40:08] holy holy holy and it was so loud and so
[1:40:12] was so great until the temple post moved
[1:40:16] [Applause]
[1:40:21] he said God is an object of worship
[1:40:23] listen this carefully I'm finishing this
[1:40:25] quotation God is an object of worship
[1:40:29] God is worshiped
[1:40:32] if anything I honor the Pentecostal
[1:40:35] people far is to let loose and worship
[1:40:38] God
[1:40:43] now you know we got to move in this
[1:40:45] message that wants to dishonor that
[1:40:49] but brother Brandon said there's
[1:40:51] anything that'll honor them for
[1:40:54] is that is for to let loose and worship
[1:40:57] God if anything if there's anything that
[1:41:01] I honor them about
[1:41:03] amen then if he honored that about the
[1:41:06] Pentecost some people what would he
[1:41:08] disapprove about some of these marks
[1:41:11] today
[1:41:12] amen you know we spoke about last Sunday
[1:41:15] about the Nicolaitans they wanted to
[1:41:18] dress up the church
[1:41:20] you know they started having dignitaries
[1:41:22] to come to church and they wanted to be
[1:41:24] in a more refined more dignified manner
[1:41:28] brother Bradham told us in the second
[1:41:30] seal he said to what did the nicolaitan
[1:41:33] age ask for it asked to get away from
[1:41:36] the bunch of people that shouts and
[1:41:37] claps their hands and looks disgraceful
[1:41:39] gracefully like they did on Pentecost
[1:41:42] act like drunk men staggering in the
[1:41:44] spirit and think they didn't want none
[1:41:45] of that stuff they said they were drunk
[1:41:48] and when the celebrities said now don't
[1:41:50] really miss this may sound crazy to you
[1:41:52] but it's the truth when the dignitaries
[1:41:55] begin to come in they couldn't stoop to
[1:41:58] that
[1:41:59] so you see there again it's you know
[1:42:02] there there's something about it about
[1:42:04] getting rid of your pride
[1:42:07] humbling down
[1:42:09] amen letting God move through you
[1:42:12] rejoicing over what the world thinks is
[1:42:15] crazy
[1:42:17] amen but when you bring dignitaries into
[1:42:20] the church they want a dignified formal
[1:42:23] religion that God hates
[1:42:29] Redemption and the completeness of Joy
[1:42:31] he said they were full of new wine
[1:42:34] amen that's right the the wine that come
[1:42:37] from God out of heaven
[1:42:39] he said you ever see a drunk man he just
[1:42:42] in love with everybody
[1:42:44] he don't care that's the way a man is
[1:42:46] when he gets drunk on the spirit and he
[1:42:49] said the Bible said be not drunk on
[1:42:51] strong drink but with excess but be
[1:42:53] drunk on the spirit
[1:42:55] amen the spirit of God makes you so
[1:42:58] drunk you forget all your enemies and
[1:43:00] everything everybody's in love with you
[1:43:02] you don't care who's standing around you
[1:43:04] you're the biggest man in the country
[1:43:06] right there I don't care if your
[1:43:08] neighbor's sitting next to you with to
[1:43:10] some dignified Church let's just let the
[1:43:13] Holy Ghost get on you one time and see
[1:43:15] what takes place you get real good souse
[1:43:18] drunk and you'll see what takes place
[1:43:21] you'll say sister I got it don't you
[1:43:24] want it to yes sir yes sir it's
[1:43:27] something to take place there you are
[1:43:29] that we're all drunk on the wine and
[1:43:31] listen some of you sisters here did you
[1:43:33] know the Blessed Virgin Mary was in that
[1:43:35] she had to go up there that mother of
[1:43:38] Jesus had to go up there and be included
[1:43:40] in that bunch of drunk people so drunk
[1:43:43] on the spirit till she staggered like
[1:43:45] she was drunken whiskey and saw
[1:43:47] something and you think you'll get to
[1:43:49] Heaven by slipping over the church and
[1:43:51] put your songbook under your arm and
[1:43:53] walking over every Sunday morning the
[1:43:55] Bell Tolls and sitting living listen at
[1:43:57] some kind of uh some of the and walk
[1:44:00] back you'll never do it you'll have to
[1:44:02] come that route because that's the only
[1:44:05] route God ever laid down and ever has
[1:44:08] and you'll walk it or you won't be there
[1:44:10] I'm not your judge but I'm preaching the
[1:44:12] gospel that's exactly the truth the
[1:44:15] blessed and virgin was right there acted
[1:44:18] just as idiotic as the rest of them did
[1:44:21] and just as drunk as the rest of them
[1:44:23] these men and women every one of them
[1:44:25] was full of new wine and if God ever
[1:44:28] changed that program put your finger on
[1:44:31] the scripture for me it isn't there no
[1:44:33] sir it was plugged on to the end of the
[1:44:36] age that way Plumb on down to the end of
[1:44:38] the Bible and it'll be the same thing
[1:44:40] when Jesus comes
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:45] well after the seals he talked different
[1:44:48] no he didn't go to this day the
[1:44:50] scripture is fulfilled and just read
[1:44:53] there where brother Bradham talks about
[1:44:54] his nephew that was seeking for God and
[1:44:58] he said you know I've run the Pillar To
[1:45:00] Post time to find something and I've
[1:45:02] been dreaming dreams of running up to
[1:45:04] the Altar and where he was preaching and
[1:45:06] making confession and he said Melvin no
[1:45:09] matter where you go how many churches
[1:45:12] how many Hail Marys that you say or how
[1:45:15] many blessings you get from man you've
[1:45:17] got to be born again of the spirit of
[1:45:19] God it's the only thing that is satisfy
[1:45:22] the human heart I know they got to
[1:45:24] substitute today of being born again
[1:45:26] just shake hands with the preacher put
[1:45:29] your name on the book but friends that's
[1:45:30] a Dogma it's not Bible truth if it was
[1:45:34] the acts of the Apostle in the second
[1:45:35] chapter would read like this when the
[1:45:37] day of Pentecost was fully come the
[1:45:39] pastor walked out and shook hands with
[1:45:42] the people but said when the day of
[1:45:44] Pentecost was fully come at the
[1:45:46] inauguration of the church there came a
[1:45:48] sound heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind
[1:45:51] and it filled all the house where they
[1:45:53] were sitting that's how the Holy Spirit
[1:45:55] came the first time that's how they come
[1:45:58] every time since that time he is God and
[1:46:01] James is not now it stumbles people they
[1:46:04] say it was for another day and he said
[1:46:06] but he's the same yesterday today and
[1:46:09] forever every time the church ever
[1:46:11] received the Holy Ghost said always come
[1:46:13] like he did it the first time under the
[1:46:16] same prescription Acts 2 38 has never
[1:46:18] changed and never will change
[1:46:21] hey man
[1:46:23] now
[1:46:25] you see we're to be like a vine
[1:46:28] that is planted by the rivers of water
[1:46:33] a constant renewing all the time
[1:46:38] it's like I preached on the Passover I
[1:46:40] named it in Passover
[1:46:43] you just don't do Passover once a month
[1:46:47] or once a year
[1:46:48] but your whole life now enters in in
[1:46:52] Christ in communion and fellowship with
[1:46:55] him and you are in Passover
[1:46:58] the fellowship never ceases the
[1:47:01] communion never stops The Joy never
[1:47:04] quits coming the love never never dries
[1:47:08] up and Fades away but you know it's
[1:47:10] always there he said he'll be like a man
[1:47:13] in the scripture that believes all God's
[1:47:15] word where the power and the nine
[1:47:18] spiritual gifts can flow through one God
[1:47:20] and to his innermost being in other
[1:47:22] words he will be like a man in the
[1:47:24] scripture that believes all of God's
[1:47:26] word
[1:47:27] that's why we want to be isn't it that
[1:47:29] is portions not just cherry pick
[1:47:32] not just parks that we're going to
[1:47:34] fulfill and listen we're fulfilling the
[1:47:36] New Testament
[1:47:38] does somebody hear that we are
[1:47:40] fulfilling the New Testament that's the
[1:47:43] groom will fulfilled the Old Testament
[1:47:45] we are fulfilling the New Testament or
[1:47:48] the New Covenant
[1:47:50] are you with me amen so everything that
[1:47:53] was in the New Testament that you read
[1:47:55] about is actually a type to be fulfilled
[1:47:59] in this last day
[1:48:01] Mary Magdalene out of whom he cast Seven
[1:48:05] Devils
[1:48:06] come on he casts out all the unbelief of
[1:48:10] all the seven churches
[1:48:12] you were that unclean woman
[1:48:15] that had to be made a Virgin by the word
[1:48:18] because God couldn't find one
[1:48:20] so he had to create one and buy a new
[1:48:23] creation that's who you are today a
[1:48:25] virgin bride
[1:48:27] are you with me he said in other words
[1:48:29] he'll be like a man in the scripture
[1:48:31] that believes all of God's word were the
[1:48:33] power the nine spiritual gifts can flow
[1:48:36] through one God in his innermost being
[1:48:38] and people don't believe in shouting to
[1:48:40] think of it is they haven't got
[1:48:42] spiritual joy and the joys of the Water
[1:48:44] of Life can flow through and that's the
[1:48:47] whole what's the matter with Bradham
[1:48:48] Tabernacle because that unbelief the
[1:48:51] cares of the world has bound the people
[1:48:53] until it cannot produce
[1:48:56] spiritual growth that's what's matter
[1:48:59] with our nation that's what's a matter
[1:49:01] with our churches they have no joy and
[1:49:05] the joy of the Lord is departed from
[1:49:07] them and that was written one time in
[1:49:09] the scripture in the in the Hebrew word
[1:49:11] of Ichabod means the presence of the
[1:49:13] Lord has departed that's over our
[1:49:15] churches because we left off the
[1:49:17] original foundation and placed ourselves
[1:49:20] into Creeds and denominations and
[1:49:22] permitted the things of the world to dry
[1:49:25] up our experience
[1:49:27] with God
[1:49:31] now listen he included his own church
[1:49:34] tonight that's one thing we don't want
[1:49:36] to become is indifferent
[1:49:39] and my brother Bradham said you know
[1:49:41] when they got starchy and cold he said I
[1:49:43] won't drive this home make you
[1:49:44] understand he said a church of people
[1:49:46] like this who would received the word
[1:49:48] became formal and you know and and dried
[1:49:52] up and becoming different and the next
[1:49:55] thing you know they were persecuting
[1:49:57] everyone who wasn't like them and they
[1:50:00] were trying to get rid of those who
[1:50:02] shouted and spoke in tongues and had
[1:50:04] experiences with God that was that
[1:50:07] Nickelodeon spirit that was coming in
[1:50:09] trying to take away the joy of the Lord
[1:50:12] from the church
[1:50:14] amen planting the Bible where to plant
[1:50:17] it he said you feel you'd like to feel
[1:50:19] like they did on the day of Pentecost
[1:50:24] um would you like to have the joy they
[1:50:26] had
[1:50:28] when God poured his life into the first
[1:50:30] branch of the tree the tree began to act
[1:50:32] like drunken people
[1:50:34] they staggered under the impact of the
[1:50:37] spirit lovely holy little women like the
[1:50:40] Virgin Mary was out there acting like
[1:50:42] she was drunken for she was drunk on the
[1:50:45] spirit she and she tried to talk and she
[1:50:47] could not she had stamen tongues which
[1:50:50] means clothing clothing like a stammer
[1:50:52] and trying to say something she was so
[1:50:54] full of the spirit she couldn't say it
[1:50:56] and he imitates this time in person and
[1:50:58] he said Stamford lips and all all of a
[1:51:02] sudden with another language they spoke
[1:51:05] out
[1:51:05] and a little preacher didn't know how to
[1:51:07] not to write his own name on a piece of
[1:51:09] paper turned over a soapbox or something
[1:51:12] or stopped and jumped on it and said and
[1:51:15] them unbelievers began to say these men
[1:51:17] are drunk that's a bunch of holy rollers
[1:51:19] and that little fellow picked up the
[1:51:21] scripture not a Creed book but the
[1:51:24] scripture said you men of Israel you
[1:51:26] that dwell in Jerusalem let this be
[1:51:29] known to you for these are not drunk as
[1:51:31] they are seeing this is the third hour
[1:51:33] of the day but this is that which was
[1:51:36] spoken of the Prophet Joel it shall come
[1:51:38] to pass in the last days
[1:51:40] come on now how many believes we're in
[1:51:42] the last days said God I'll pour out my
[1:51:45] spirit that was what was pulsating them
[1:51:48] amen he said would you like to be
[1:51:50] plucked out of an old Creed and uh of
[1:51:53] some sort and set by The Fountains of
[1:51:55] life where peace like a river that's
[1:51:58] exactly what happened to us God plucked
[1:52:01] us right out
[1:52:02] of a bunch of Creeds and planted us over
[1:52:05] by the rivers of water that's what he
[1:52:08] was doing to Sarah taking her out of her
[1:52:10] dead form of condition
[1:52:12] I thought about it as I read this Sarah
[1:52:15] had to be drunk on something to believe
[1:52:18] that now a 90 year old woman was going
[1:52:20] to conceive
[1:52:22] Hallelujah but the son of man was
[1:52:24] standing there with Wayne and
[1:52:26] stimulation and said take a drink of
[1:52:29] this take this milk and eat this book
[1:52:32] and when it does oh you're going to
[1:52:34] prophesy and what you prophesy will
[1:52:38] agree with the word
[1:52:44] amen
[1:52:47] think of that
[1:52:49] the church
[1:52:51] tells us in this morning age
[1:52:54] the church had this had begun to spring
[1:52:56] up a root of bitterness this is what
[1:52:59] happens a root of bitterness comes up we
[1:53:01] don't want no joy
[1:53:03] this is Sarah
[1:53:05] you know it's American not the promise
[1:53:09] saying it can't happen
[1:53:11] you know how can a woman my age have
[1:53:13] pleasure with my Lord let those hairs
[1:53:15] over
[1:53:16] that only happened we were young
[1:53:18] yet we danced together we shouted we
[1:53:21] rejoice and boy we heard but now I'm an
[1:53:25] old woman
[1:53:26] I can't do this
[1:53:28] it's not possible it's not this age
[1:53:31] you know it's not not our time they did
[1:53:35] it in other ages they did in other times
[1:53:37] but not us
[1:53:39] and they but brother Bradley said that
[1:53:41] this morning church began to spring up a
[1:53:45] root of bitterness and he said why it
[1:53:47] was bitter against those who wanted to
[1:53:50] continue on with the Holy Ghost
[1:53:53] the love that faded away and they were
[1:53:56] trying to swap a decrees and
[1:53:58] denomination getting away from the Holy
[1:54:00] Ghost leadership that's why the
[1:54:02] bitterness was in them he said the
[1:54:04] bitterness started Sweeping in the
[1:54:06] creeping in the the second church a
[1:54:09] little more creeped right on in because
[1:54:11] they were making a better Church
[1:54:15] You Know It embarrasses us for someone
[1:54:18] to speak in tongues it embarrass us for
[1:54:21] somebody to shout it embarrass us you
[1:54:25] know that's an embarrassment
[1:54:27] yeah and and so they were they had had
[1:54:31] as he said these dignitaries come in
[1:54:34] great Roman people great men Cardinals
[1:54:38] dressed fine and he said they got away
[1:54:40] from all the noise and everything they
[1:54:43] had very quiet it showed they were dying
[1:54:47] uh-huh they were dying you know you want
[1:54:50] to call that well we're more mature no
[1:54:51] you're you're dying
[1:54:54] and you got one foot on a banana peel
[1:54:59] you see they were dying they were so
[1:55:03] they got so they got dignified and they
[1:55:06] made a better body
[1:55:08] and that's what we wanted to do to the
[1:55:10] message in the last day it's just kind
[1:55:12] of dignify it
[1:55:15] where you know we may be we've begun to
[1:55:18] be embarrassed as brother Bradham said
[1:55:20] and ashamed of him just before he leads
[1:55:23] us he said are you saved of your
[1:55:25] Pentecostal experience Are you ashamed
[1:55:27] to say yes I've spoke with tongue yes I
[1:55:30] believe in Divine Healing he said that's
[1:55:32] being ashamed of him he said it's
[1:55:35] exactly like that if I would say you
[1:55:37] know to a young boy this is my son and
[1:55:39] he'd say who me you my daddy oh no you
[1:55:42] know you're not my daddy he said it
[1:55:44] would embarrass me for my son to say
[1:55:46] that and he said It embarrasses God when
[1:55:50] we are ashamed of him
[1:55:52] we're too ashamed of our Pentecostal
[1:55:55] experience
[1:55:56] we're too ashamed to have any joy in the
[1:55:59] church
[1:56:01] come on Amen now now again again there
[1:56:06] it was in restoration of the Bright Tree
[1:56:08] he said a dignified group got among the
[1:56:13] common people
[1:56:16] and they said well now that's good you
[1:56:18] can heal the sick and you can do these
[1:56:19] things that's wonderful but see what we
[1:56:21] ought to do we ought to just kind of get
[1:56:23] it out there we're a better class of
[1:56:25] people understand the better class the
[1:56:27] mayor the judges the dignitaries of the
[1:56:30] city and as long as you're carrying on
[1:56:32] like that they'll never come around you
[1:56:33] they're afraid of you
[1:56:36] somebody spoke out of the congregation
[1:56:38] said they still are and he said somebody
[1:56:41] said that there still are I guess that's
[1:56:43] about right they're afraid of the Holy
[1:56:45] Spirit
[1:56:46] so I used to sing a song about the
[1:56:49] old-time religion and it went like this
[1:56:51] as the old-time Holy Spirit and the
[1:56:54] devil won't go near it and that's the
[1:56:56] reason people fear it but it's good
[1:56:59] enough for me
[1:57:00] amen so you see again that that's the
[1:57:03] whole thing it will make you stop your
[1:57:05] line it will save you when you're dying
[1:57:08] it'll stop the devil flying and it's
[1:57:10] good enough for me and he said that's
[1:57:13] the reason people don't want it
[1:57:16] now in the message desperation after the
[1:57:20] token message was preached he said this
[1:57:23] ought to cause us to go in the
[1:57:25] desperation because it's the hour in
[1:57:27] time that the Holy Ghost must be applied
[1:57:29] the token the Holy Ghost must be applied
[1:57:33] we're going to talk about that maybe in
[1:57:34] a little bit
[1:57:36] but anyway in desperations
[1:57:39] he said that he read the scripture and
[1:57:42] I'd like you to turn with me because
[1:57:44] it's a favorite of of many of the people
[1:57:47] in the world today this is commonly
[1:57:50] given for encouragement and ought to
[1:57:52] encourage us this morning
[1:57:54] but he says in Jeremiah 29 the 10th
[1:57:57] verse for thus saith the Lord that after
[1:58:00] 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I
[1:58:03] will visit you
[1:58:05] so I want you to know now they had been
[1:58:08] taken down to Babylon and told they
[1:58:10] would be there for a specific time we to
[1:58:14] the church had been taken down to
[1:58:16] Babylon
[1:58:18] somebody help me preach think about what
[1:58:20] I'm saying we went down and we were
[1:58:22] dispersed now among the denominations
[1:58:27] and the Catholic Methodist Presbyterian
[1:58:29] whatever but it was in Babylon we was
[1:58:33] dispersed there you know taken from the
[1:58:36] promised land of the word and dispersed
[1:58:38] out into systems of religion
[1:58:41] down in the Babylon but I want you to
[1:58:43] notice God only allows that first set
[1:58:46] time
[1:58:48] and after that set time I'm going to
[1:58:51] visit you
[1:58:53] this is what he says to Sarah I'm going
[1:58:56] to visit you according to the time of
[1:58:58] life again he says I will visit you and
[1:59:02] I will perform my good word towards you
[1:59:05] in causing you to return to this place
[1:59:11] Hallelujah
[1:59:12] I will visit you
[1:59:14] and I'm going to perform my good work
[1:59:18] towards you
[1:59:19] and I'm going to cause you to turn
[1:59:23] return to this place
[1:59:26] I'm bringing you right back to the land
[1:59:29] that you were taken out of
[1:59:33] and he said but I know the thoughts that
[1:59:36] I think towards you
[1:59:38] aren't you glad
[1:59:40] Amen brother Madison isn't that sweet
[1:59:43] I think it's some of the sweetest words
[1:59:45] I know the thoughts that I think of you
[1:59:48] saith the Lord
[1:59:50] thoughts of peace
[1:59:52] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:59:55] end
[1:59:57] then you shall call upon me
[2:00:01] and ye shall go and pray unto me and I
[2:00:04] will hearken unto you
[2:00:07] and you will seek me with your heart and
[2:00:10] find me and when you seek with me for me
[2:00:13] with search for me with your heart with
[2:00:15] all your heart and I will be found of
[2:00:18] you saith the Lord and I will turn away
[2:00:20] from you your captivity and I will
[2:00:23] gather you from all let me bring it
[2:00:25] specific the denominations
[2:00:29] stop here stop here just for a moment
[2:00:32] how many some of your background was
[2:00:34] Catholic raise your hands
[2:00:36] I won two I know another so so there
[2:00:40] again Catholics
[2:00:42] all right so what what about you that
[2:00:44] were Baptists
[2:00:46] raise up your hands
[2:00:49] all right what about let's just say
[2:00:51] Pentecostal raise up your hands so you
[2:00:55] see you were there I'm gonna gather you
[2:00:58] from all of that isn't that what God has
[2:01:00] done
[2:01:02] come on
[2:01:04] amen you Methodist boy didn't he gather
[2:01:07] you
[2:01:08] he didn't leave you alone he knew
[2:01:11] exactly where to find you to bring you
[2:01:14] not the evening tonight Tabernacle but
[2:01:16] to this place
[2:01:19] what place are we talking about because
[2:01:22] it's black
[2:01:24] is somebody ready for it to cut back the
[2:01:27] Pentecost where you fell from
[2:01:34] I will bring you again into the place
[2:01:36] which I caused you to be carried away
[2:01:39] captive
[2:01:41] brother Branham says here now these are
[2:01:44] his words back to Pentecost
[2:01:50] so I want you to see this is what he
[2:01:53] what he thought of it this is where
[2:01:54] you're coming back to I know the
[2:01:57] thoughts and I think I'm going to
[2:01:58] perform my good word to you and I'm
[2:02:00] going to bring you back to where you
[2:02:01] fell from
[2:02:03] back to Pentecost
[2:02:06] amen you know again he said it I put
[2:02:09] that in myself it doesn't say that but
[2:02:11] that's what I was meaning to the church
[2:02:14] so brother Brandon's message of what he
[2:02:16] meant to the church was that the message
[2:02:19] of God would turn us back to the faith
[2:02:22] of the Pentecostal fathers Sarah I am
[2:02:25] returning you to Pentecost back to your
[2:02:28] youth
[2:02:30] back to when Mary the mother of Jesus
[2:02:33] with the 120 dance and shouted and
[2:02:35] glorified God under the power of the
[2:02:38] Holy Ghost I'm bringing you back
[2:02:41] you know something getting screamed out
[2:02:43] no no Sarah that's not you you're an old
[2:02:45] woman you're too dignified for that but
[2:02:48] we're about to lose all our dignity
[2:02:49] [Applause]
[2:02:51] Hallelujah the Nicolaitans brought that
[2:02:53] in
[2:02:54] the Holy Ghost never put that in amen
[2:02:57] the Holy Ghost put freedom and joy and
[2:03:01] rejoicing and dancing
[2:03:04] Hallelujah speaking of tongues and
[2:03:06] prophecy that's what the Holy Ghost
[2:03:09] wrote in Nicola anthonism brought in
[2:03:11] dignity
[2:03:13] dignitaries
[2:03:21] I can hear him saying
[2:03:23] hey Sarah
[2:03:25] you're you're too dignified for that you
[2:03:28] know this is not that day
[2:03:30] this is the calling out of the Bride not
[2:03:32] 2 000 years ago at Pentecostal the
[2:03:35] repeater the return
[2:03:37] let me just say something they're using
[2:03:39] Brother branham's words but let me just
[2:03:42] say the devil uses it
[2:03:45] scripture too
[2:03:48] let me make it clear we are not
[2:03:52] repeating Pentecost
[2:03:56] this is not another Journey Sarah where
[2:03:58] you're just going to be young and yet
[2:04:00] barren
[2:04:03] in this day instead Jesus
[2:04:05] instead of Jesus is setting as mediator
[2:04:08] which he still does he advances to take
[2:04:11] the book
[2:04:13] I want you to understand this is not the
[2:04:15] day of Pentecost
[2:04:17] because at the day of Pentecost Jesus
[2:04:20] sat down his mediator
[2:04:22] and sent back his own Spirit to come and
[2:04:25] live in the church
[2:04:27] is that right but this is the day when
[2:04:31] the lamb takes the book
[2:04:34] and reveals and opens the book father
[2:04:39] believer
[2:04:42] and then advances and brings the book
[2:04:46] down an open book
[2:04:49] not a close book
[2:04:52] but every promise of God opened to us
[2:04:56] not a few come on not just opening up
[2:04:59] the mystery of who the horse white horse
[2:05:02] rider the red the black the pale that's
[2:05:04] not it
[2:05:05] I was exposing the devil he is what
[2:05:08] bring you back to the mystery of your
[2:05:10] life
[2:05:11] Who You Are Sarah so you can see your
[2:05:15] name in the book
[2:05:17] Hallelujah he's gonna Rapture the names
[2:05:20] on that boat
[2:05:23] amen the names of the book that is the
[2:05:25] Believers
[2:05:27] that's who's written in the book
[2:05:30] and it had to be opened
[2:05:34] so we're not just returning
[2:05:36] to Pentecost
[2:05:38] we are taking this places they didn't
[2:05:42] get to go
[2:05:45] we are going all the way to the change
[2:05:51] Pentecost I'm done by 2 000 years ago
[2:05:54] stop short of the change
[2:05:58] they were right on the cusp of it the
[2:06:01] Mysteries were being given three
[2:06:03] Destinies and serpent sea eternal
[2:06:05] security baptism in Jesus name receive
[2:06:07] the gift of the Holy all of it was there
[2:06:11] ever mystery Paul was preaching them and
[2:06:14] he starts preaching the mystery of the
[2:06:16] rapture
[2:06:18] and says we which are alive and remain
[2:06:22] he's right on the cusp of it
[2:06:24] he's right on the edge of it
[2:06:29] and with all of that word
[2:06:32] they start falling
[2:06:38] the church
[2:06:43] now I wouldn't just say
[2:06:47] we are not just returning to Pentecost
[2:06:53] look at your neighbor and say that we
[2:06:56] are not just returning to Pentecost
[2:06:59] we are taking this to places
[2:07:02] they didn't get to go
[2:07:06] we are going all the way to the chains
[2:07:08] we have heard to shout
[2:07:10] We are Becoming The Voice
[2:07:12] and soon the trumpet's going to sound
[2:07:15] someone is going to fulfill the words of
[2:07:18] Jesus that the power of death will not
[2:07:20] be able to defeat my church
[2:07:24] but however despite all that all of that
[2:07:28] you know Malachi 4 and the ministry of
[2:07:31] the son of man he said I know the
[2:07:34] thoughts that I think of you they are
[2:07:36] peace and not of evil and it's for the
[2:07:39] purpose of uh back to Pentecost I'm
[2:07:43] going to bring you back
[2:07:49] I want to want to get this to you let me
[2:07:51] stop in a moment with Israel coming in
[2:07:54] from Egypt
[2:07:56] getting into the line was not all of it
[2:08:03] you know to build a nice home on your
[2:08:05] own and have your own Vineyard and raise
[2:08:09] your children in the promised land it's
[2:08:11] as I've said a land of milk and honey
[2:08:15] it's a wonderful place
[2:08:18] but God's intention was not just to give
[2:08:21] them a land where that they built a
[2:08:24] temple and had a synagogues or or they
[2:08:27] had they had their own piece of property
[2:08:30] and married and given marriage and just
[2:08:32] had children in generations and they go
[2:08:35] no he had brought Jim back to that land
[2:08:38] to receive the Messiah
[2:08:42] right
[2:08:44] she prepared them to receive the Messiah
[2:08:48] to come I want to say to you God has not
[2:08:52] just given us this land so that we could
[2:08:55] have our own churches and fit it with
[2:08:58] pews like we like and set Church ordered
[2:09:01] the way we want it and have our forms
[2:09:03] all set up the way we like them and we
[2:09:06] have something called a message church
[2:09:08] and we raise good kids and we have a
[2:09:11] church society that helps one another
[2:09:13] that ain't what God brought us here
[2:09:16] God has greatness here that we might see
[2:09:21] the Messiah that the promise said
[2:09:24] Hallelujah that the promise said
[2:09:30] we come
[2:09:40] otherwise it's all for nothing
[2:09:44] you might as well stayed in your
[2:09:46] denomination
[2:09:48] they had better churches and better
[2:09:49] facilities and better this and better
[2:09:51] that Aid societies
[2:09:55] but God has brought you to this land of
[2:09:57] the word
[2:09:59] that he might reveal to you the Messiah
[2:10:03] his plan his purpose and then you as a
[2:10:07] revelation so that he could come for you
[2:10:13] so he could give you the book
[2:10:16] of redemption
[2:10:26] so this is not just another Pentecost
[2:10:30] this instead
[2:10:33] are you ready for this
[2:10:35] is the Pentecost of all Pentecost
[2:10:42] this is a super Pentecost
[2:10:45] this is when the day of Pentecost has
[2:10:48] fully come
[2:10:51] Hallelujah there were partial comments
[2:10:54] in the past come on somebody that would
[2:10:57] still prophesying of something greater
[2:10:59] to come
[2:11:00] but we're not prophesying of something
[2:11:03] greater to come we have arrived
[2:11:07] we are at the church we are the people
[2:11:10] who are praying forth Jesus Christ back
[2:11:13] to the Earth again we're the people of
[2:11:15] the rapture
[2:11:23] the other instances of Pentecost
[2:11:26] where only a shadow of us
[2:11:30] Shadow is
[2:11:32] it's it's
[2:11:35] something that comes between that and
[2:11:39] as the real thing approaches you see
[2:11:42] something like it come
[2:11:45] the Shadow's not the real thing
[2:11:47] the type is not the real thing
[2:11:50] if it was Abraham it would have ended
[2:11:52] with Abraham
[2:11:55] so Abraham was left there as a type
[2:11:59] to say there's going to be someone this
[2:12:02] is going to be fulfilled in a greater
[2:12:04] way and a reality
[2:12:06] now hold that thought for a moment
[2:12:09] the other instances of Pentecost were
[2:12:11] only a shadow of us
[2:12:14] they were only prophesying of us
[2:12:18] I want you to look at it for a moment
[2:12:19] Acts chapter 2 is a prophecy of us
[2:12:26] the Pentecost 50 days or seven weeks
[2:12:30] after the Passover and leave in Egypt
[2:12:33] when they have their first Pentecost
[2:12:36] was on Mount Sinai and God married
[2:12:38] Israel and wrote his long stones
[2:12:42] gave his word on stones
[2:12:46] and then there was again another
[2:12:49] Pentecost it was only prophesying of a
[2:12:51] greater Pentecost
[2:12:53] because in that Pentecost
[2:12:56] it was 3 000 there that died
[2:13:01] when they made the golden calf
[2:13:05] and then you come right down along the
[2:13:07] line and and now you come all the way to
[2:13:10] the days of Jesus and it's prophesied of
[2:13:13] a greater Pentecost
[2:13:15] and then there was
[2:13:17] there was Jesus death the Passover Lamb
[2:13:21] I mean he's with me now and as the
[2:13:23] Passover Lamb of there he died and 50
[2:13:27] days later his Spirit or his anointing
[2:13:30] comes down and and brings and brings uh
[2:13:34] their the spirit of Jesus and now God
[2:13:38] writes his law on flesh
[2:13:46] so this one was only foreshadowing
[2:13:48] another
[2:13:49] that would be greater but can I just say
[2:13:51] to you this this it was only
[2:13:55] foreshadowing another greater Pentecost
[2:13:59] and we are in the greatest Pentecost the
[2:14:02] greatest Jubilee that there has ever
[2:14:05] been
[2:14:07] right now going on right now and you
[2:14:11] expect us not to shout and you expect us
[2:14:14] not to rejoice
[2:14:17] we are in the Jubilee of jubilees
[2:14:22] Hallelujah when those you have been
[2:14:25] enslaved come on somebody they were in
[2:14:28] slaves of sins and so were we but when
[2:14:30] we were also enslaves of unbelief come
[2:14:33] on somebody down to seven churches we
[2:14:36] got enslaved in citizens of man but what
[2:14:39] did God do he has sent a jubilee trumpet
[2:14:43] that says lay down your hole You Don't
[2:14:46] Have To Belong to baptist Methodist
[2:14:48] Presbyterian Catholic you don't have to
[2:14:50] be enslaved anymore come on home
[2:14:55] take your inheritance slow down your
[2:14:58] hole now
[2:15:08] just prophesy
[2:15:11] now
[2:15:12] 2 000 years ago
[2:15:15] we the Passover Lamb came
[2:15:19] Paul said he was our Passover Lamb
[2:15:23] he said Christ Our Passover
[2:15:27] so you see we have now come seven weeks
[2:15:32] and now after seven weeks after Calvary
[2:15:36] and Jesus where Jesus became a Passover
[2:15:39] Lamb his anointing comes down
[2:15:43] and brings to us an open book
[2:15:46] that is saying to the church Sarah take
[2:15:50] the book
[2:15:52] this is a full inheritance
[2:15:56] and and I just want to say Sarah this is
[2:15:59] the greatest day of your life
[2:16:02] this is not just the day
[2:16:05] that the lamb takes the book this is
[2:16:08] even greater than that this is the day
[2:16:10] where you take the book
[2:16:13] this is our wedding day we're us and the
[2:16:17] word become one
[2:16:19] God materialize itself in Brides form
[2:16:25] this is the last days that we're living
[2:16:27] in
[2:16:28] and it is greater than the day of
[2:16:30] Pentecost
[2:16:32] remember this is not just a repeater the
[2:16:35] return
[2:16:36] this is more than that
[2:16:39] we are living out and is greater than
[2:16:42] the day of Pentecost
[2:16:44] even though that that is the alpha and
[2:16:47] we are the Omega then yet there is
[2:16:50] something that has been left for us that
[2:16:53] day of the first age did not obtain
[2:16:56] this last day is greater I want to say
[2:16:59] it again it's greater than the day of
[2:17:01] Pentecost
[2:17:03] because that gave us a deposit on our
[2:17:06] inheritance
[2:17:07] and he believes that
[2:17:09] but I want to say this is not just
[2:17:12] another deposit
[2:17:15] amen this is the receiving of the full
[2:17:18] and complete inheritance
[2:17:22] Hallelujah
[2:17:23] this is where that
[2:17:25] people in the last day take the book of
[2:17:29] title that Adam lost
[2:17:32] that a man took for us which was Jesus
[2:17:35] Christ and he comes down with his book
[2:17:38] come on and he hands that book a title
[2:17:41] of the Earth
[2:17:44] can I say the title to yours is in it
[2:17:50] therefore when you completely receive
[2:17:53] possession of that your body is going to
[2:17:56] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[2:17:59] an eye and will no longer be under
[2:18:02] Satan's grip
[2:18:12] I want to get it to you
[2:18:18] they received a deposit
[2:18:23] a deposit
[2:18:26] you're not in the day of just receiving
[2:18:28] the deposit
[2:18:29] now individually you must receive the
[2:18:33] Holy Ghost and have the deposit and that
[2:18:35] deposits on the change of your body
[2:18:38] that just as God saved your soul you're
[2:18:40] going to have full and complete
[2:18:41] Redemption
[2:18:43] amen and the adoption that is the change
[2:18:46] of our bodies
[2:18:48] somebody with me now but now we're
[2:18:50] talking about the church
[2:18:52] and the church coming down now we're not
[2:18:55] speaking of individual and individually
[2:18:57] receiving the holy I'm talking about the
[2:18:59] move of God in this day and hour and
[2:19:01] remember back on the day of Pentecost he
[2:19:05] gave a deposit
[2:19:07] saying there's something greater to come
[2:19:12] now you know exercise is something a
[2:19:15] moment let's turn to Second Corinthians
[2:19:17] 1 and 21. now he which established you
[2:19:20] in Christ and hath anointed us is God
[2:19:25] so what established us in Christ and
[2:19:28] whatever who has anointed us that's God
[2:19:32] who has also sealed us and given us
[2:19:36] the
[2:19:38] help me now
[2:19:40] earnest
[2:19:42] of the spirit in our hearts
[2:19:44] now and Earnest is money in which
[2:19:48] purchases are given as a pledge or down
[2:19:50] payment that the full amount will
[2:19:53] subsequently be paid
[2:19:56] amen so again you know it is it is a
[2:20:00] deposit on a promise
[2:20:05] amen now if you go with me to Second
[2:20:08] Corinthians 5 and 5 and now he that will
[2:20:11] offer us the Same Spirit uh is God he's
[2:20:14] giving us an Earnest I'm sorry I meant
[2:20:16] Ephesians 1 13 and whom you have trusted
[2:20:19] after that you have heard the word of
[2:20:21] Truth The Gospel of your salvation and
[2:20:23] whom after you believe you were sealed
[2:20:27] with that Holy Spirit of promise
[2:20:31] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[2:20:36] until the Redemption of the purchased
[2:20:38] possession unto the praise of his glory
[2:20:42] so he said I'm giving you the Holy Ghost
[2:20:44] you have received is the earnest of your
[2:20:48] inheritance
[2:20:49] amen it's a deposit
[2:20:53] that is going to be left with the church
[2:20:56] until the full possession comes until
[2:21:00] the title is handed over
[2:21:02] somebody with me now amen so this is not
[2:21:06] a repeat of Pentecost why because this
[2:21:09] is not a deposit on our inheritance
[2:21:13] it is the coming of the full and
[2:21:15] complete inheritance it's the bride's
[2:21:17] calling it's the marriage of the Lamb so
[2:21:20] do we have something different
[2:21:22] brother Brandon said we do
[2:21:25] oh you and you think well what is it
[2:21:27] it's the seals yes
[2:21:30] the Thunder's yes but let me just say
[2:21:35] the early church didn't need the
[2:21:37] Thunders and seals it wasn't sealed to
[2:21:40] them
[2:21:41] amen they didn't need the book open
[2:21:45] the book was open to them
[2:21:51] they had the revelation
[2:21:54] come on somebody no they didn't know the
[2:21:57] churches they didn't need to know the
[2:21:59] churches
[2:22:01] they had everything they needed to go in
[2:22:05] a rapture
[2:22:07] except us
[2:22:14] Hallelujah because God had more names on
[2:22:19] the book
[2:22:22] Hallelujah so the church would go
[2:22:24] through seven churches
[2:22:27] and then gathered up those names of the
[2:22:30] book
[2:22:31] because God's determined there's not
[2:22:33] going to be one left out
[2:22:42] okay
[2:22:44] so what do we have that's different
[2:22:48] by the time you said
[2:22:50] you know yeah we got the Thunders and
[2:22:53] the seals but they didn't need them well
[2:22:55] let's stop this for a moment
[2:22:58] God didn't want them to know there would
[2:23:00] be seven churches
[2:23:02] the devil would have done great damage
[2:23:04] with that nobody would have died ready
[2:23:11] nobody would have been prepared
[2:23:15] so every age died ready to come up
[2:23:21] amen now so God hid that from them and
[2:23:26] and in fact from what we know of the
[2:23:29] Book of Revelation It Was Written even
[2:23:30] after Paul was off the scene
[2:23:35] so you know there's a whole book that's
[2:23:37] written after Paul is gone
[2:23:40] Paul never mentions the seals
[2:23:44] he never mentions the seven Thunders
[2:23:48] Peter didn't know them
[2:23:50] none of them knew him it was not to be
[2:23:52] known
[2:23:54] and back to the matter is when when John
[2:23:56] was going to tell it you know when he
[2:23:58] got it and he heard it and he was going
[2:24:01] to write it and he said don't do it
[2:24:04] it ain't even for the Saints
[2:24:06] it will be kept silent until the days of
[2:24:10] the voice of the seventh angel and when
[2:24:12] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[2:24:15] God will be finished
[2:24:17] [Applause]
[2:24:18] so hold that bright
[2:24:23] until the last days
[2:24:25] and when it's the last days it's time to
[2:24:27] let them know it's the last days
[2:24:30] Hallelujah
[2:24:32] hallelujah it's time for them to know
[2:24:35] where their hour of the mouth
[2:24:36] come on it's time to let them know where
[2:24:39] they come down to Seven Acres It's Time
[2:24:42] to Let It Go
[2:24:43] that they are in the last days that this
[2:24:46] is the cycle that is coming and the
[2:24:48] Silence of his Heaven has been broken at
[2:24:51] the seventh seal opened
[2:24:57] the seventh seal didn't start silence it
[2:25:01] ended the silence
[2:25:02] what God had held quiet and silence not
[2:25:06] become muttered
[2:25:14] what do we have different
[2:25:18] you know listen this is what some are
[2:25:21] saying we're not to return to Pentecost
[2:25:23] they're right
[2:25:25] we're not to repeat Pentecost they're
[2:25:28] right
[2:25:32] but they're trying to place that in a
[2:25:34] wrong way
[2:25:35] they're trying to say we're not to have
[2:25:38] the experience of Pentecost
[2:25:41] and Pentecost not experiences for all
[2:25:43] generation is for all people it never
[2:25:46] ends
[2:25:47] every person must have that Pentecostal
[2:25:50] experience but we are not merely
[2:25:53] repeating Pentecost
[2:25:59] we're not just going back there like
[2:26:01] they did
[2:26:03] stop for a moment now
[2:26:05] so what do we have this different
[2:26:08] what sets us apart
[2:26:10] from those on the day of Pentecost
[2:26:13] listen we have the same deposit
[2:26:17] the Holy Ghost
[2:26:18] we still have the same repentance and
[2:26:21] baptism in Jesus name brother Brandon
[2:26:23] said the word that that fell on the day
[2:26:25] of Pentecost won't work for today
[2:26:27] so what word was it repentance baptism
[2:26:31] in the name of Jesus Christ or you shall
[2:26:33] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what
[2:26:35] which one of those words won't work
[2:26:37] well brother Brandon was saying is that
[2:26:40] it's not that the truth that they had
[2:26:43] won't work today
[2:26:45] but God is not repeating that again
[2:26:50] this is not just going to be another
[2:26:53] Shadow another foreshadowing of another
[2:26:55] age this is the Pentecost of Pentecost
[2:27:00] amen this is what listen what do we have
[2:27:03] different the lamb in our day I want you
[2:27:06] to get this
[2:27:08] by revelation
[2:27:10] true a prophet of God the lamb haven't
[2:27:14] moved as a lamb took and opened the
[2:27:17] seals
[2:27:19] so brother Tim we have the mediatorial
[2:27:21] work yes we do amen just because he did
[2:27:24] the princess and working Calgary don't
[2:27:26] mean his purchasing stopped when he
[2:27:29] started mediating and when he mediates
[2:27:31] don't mean when he kept moving to the
[2:27:34] realm of of where that he has taken the
[2:27:37] book does not mean he stops mediating
[2:27:41] in fact it's as mediator he takes the
[2:27:45] book
[2:27:46] he doesn't do it as a as I he does it
[2:27:50] symbolically as a man not as God
[2:27:54] as a lamb see shows it symbolically a
[2:27:58] mediator
[2:28:00] lime is mediator
[2:28:05] but what is it we have different
[2:28:07] we have the lamb after Seven Ages taken
[2:28:10] the book
[2:28:12] tearing off its seals and
[2:28:17] and handing over the title deed
[2:28:20] the one that Adam lost
[2:28:25] the one Jesus paid for
[2:28:28] and it's now back in the hands of men
[2:28:31] and we are commanded to take it
[2:28:37] and the lamb is poison position to call
[2:28:40] for the names of all of those that are
[2:28:42] in the book to come and stand by his
[2:28:44] side which by the way is the rapture and
[2:28:47] to gather the Bride of the New Testament
[2:28:49] and Old Testament to the marriage supper
[2:28:50] of the Lamb
[2:28:52] so what is different
[2:28:54] here it is
[2:28:55] soon the lamb will take his bride
[2:28:59] to be ever at his side
[2:29:02] amen all the hostess Seven Ages it will
[2:29:06] be
[2:29:07] is going to be a glorious sight
[2:29:10] with all the saints and spotless White
[2:29:13] I'm with Jesus we will be eternally
[2:29:18] you see this time
[2:29:20] hold it this time it's great again
[2:29:24] just like that green back there
[2:29:28] and the disc grain is predestinated not
[2:29:31] to fall
[2:29:33] amen that Pentecostal Church went into
[2:29:36] the ground as a seed and was planted but
[2:29:39] this time the grain is he raptured in
[2:29:43] the glory without doubt
[2:29:45] [Applause]
[2:29:48] what a difference
[2:29:56] Sarah you'll not die
[2:30:01] Sarah you're not going on into death
[2:30:04] but there's an anointing that has come
[2:30:06] down
[2:30:07] Hallelujah to discern the thoughts and
[2:30:09] intensive heart the son of man revealing
[2:30:12] himself
[2:30:13] what's now and as it does it points a
[2:30:16] message to her of transformation a
[2:30:19] message of change
[2:30:24] you see
[2:30:27] I saw another Mighty angel
[2:30:31] descend from heaven with the title deed
[2:30:34] kinos pouring out the complete fullness
[2:30:37] of redemption place and defeat of his
[2:30:40] body upon the seed and the Sea and the
[2:30:42] lamb swearing by himself there will be
[2:30:45] no delay it's time to finish this
[2:30:49] I've come down to finish
[2:30:52] what I gave back to Abraham years ago
[2:30:56] I've come now to finish it
[2:30:58] amen Sarah now step into the prophecy
[2:31:02] the book is open now for you to see your
[2:31:04] name in there
[2:31:05] amen if the book is open to show you all
[2:31:09] these hagars that are not the one I
[2:31:11] chose
[2:31:12] come on somebody amen the one that I
[2:31:15] chose amen Sarah you're the one and it's
[2:31:19] the hour of fulfillment and I want you
[2:31:22] to for finish it with laughter I want
[2:31:25] you to finish it with great joy I want
[2:31:28] you to finish it with faith I want you
[2:31:30] to finish with with power amen finish it
[2:31:33] with her the bombs woman and her child
[2:31:35] cast out and you see your place in the
[2:31:39] box and go in a Rapture Hallelujah
[2:31:43] are you with me church that's the hour
[2:31:46] we're living in
[2:31:50] now let me just read it
[2:31:52] to you and trying to do God of service
[2:31:54] without his will
[2:31:56] the day of Pentecostal Spirit directed
[2:31:59] it right into that Joel 2 38.
[2:32:02] the spirit the day of Luther directed it
[2:32:04] right into that Wesley in this last
[2:32:07] Pentecostal move but this is another age
[2:32:10] this is a calling out of the Bride not 2
[2:32:15] 000 years ago at Pentecost or the repeat
[2:32:17] or the return
[2:32:20] now men run with that and say oh no
[2:32:22] we're not to have Pentecost
[2:32:24] no we are to be Pentecost
[2:32:26] the Pentecost of Pentecost but we are
[2:32:29] not repeating
[2:32:31] nor are we just returning there
[2:32:34] what would prompt brother Brandon to say
[2:32:36] this now I'm trying to close and I I
[2:32:38] will
[2:32:40] I'll let you know when
[2:32:45] but I want you to get this I want to
[2:32:47] finish this thought
[2:32:49] what would prompt brother Branham to say
[2:32:51] this
[2:32:52] what and and I just want to ask you
[2:32:56] what could be greater
[2:32:59] than the spirit of God coming down into
[2:33:01] a person
[2:33:03] think about it
[2:33:05] it seems like this would be the greatest
[2:33:07] of all experiences
[2:33:10] what would be greater than deity coming
[2:33:12] down on the inside of your soul and
[2:33:15] possessing your mortal body
[2:33:19] well it would be greater oh it filled
[2:33:20] them with such Joy they spoke in other
[2:33:22] languages as the spirit gave the mutters
[2:33:25] and glorified God but this is not a
[2:33:27] repeat
[2:33:29] not just a return to Pentecost
[2:33:32] it is not the initiating of redemption
[2:33:36] it is the finishing up of redemption
[2:33:40] now think of some of the displays of God
[2:33:43] in the past
[2:33:44] and I'm just going to take you on a
[2:33:46] little Journey won't be long
[2:33:47] it'll be a short one each one
[2:33:50] think of this great this place of God in
[2:33:53] the past
[2:33:54] let's go back to the children of Israel
[2:33:56] coming out of Egypt
[2:33:59] what could be greater than God
[2:34:02] descending on a mount
[2:34:05] and the glory of the Lord coming down in
[2:34:09] a cloudy pillar and quaking and
[2:34:12] trembling and the mountains trembled in
[2:34:14] God's voice speaking from that how many
[2:34:18] would agree that would be a great moment
[2:34:21] how many would like to see that
[2:34:24] amen what would be greater than God
[2:34:27] taken his Majestic finger
[2:34:30] I'm taking stones and lighted his laws
[2:34:35] in it
[2:34:37] I say that would be a great moment
[2:34:40] and I say if you were living in that day
[2:34:43] you would say what in the world could
[2:34:46] ever be greater than this
[2:34:49] this is the Apex this is the top this
[2:34:52] tops off everything the Cloudy pillar is
[2:34:55] coming down flashing the light
[2:34:58] thundering the voice of God being heard
[2:35:01] God taking his Majestic figure and
[2:35:04] writing his loss
[2:35:09] why you would have been thought
[2:35:12] Blasphemous to come out and said you
[2:35:14] know
[2:35:15] brother Aaron he you think this is great
[2:35:18] it was great ain't it
[2:35:20] but there's something coming greater
[2:35:22] than this
[2:35:29] oh wait a minute your devaluing what
[2:35:31] we've got
[2:35:34] yeah yeah you're you're you're
[2:35:36] diminishing you know you're you're
[2:35:38] dismissing how great this is no
[2:35:41] we're not to valuing what you what you
[2:35:43] have at all
[2:35:44] but what could be great
[2:35:47] his coming is Jesus
[2:35:50] was greater than him coming down on a
[2:35:53] mountain and writing with a finger
[2:35:57] God came and revealed himself in Christ
[2:35:59] that was only a portion of there there
[2:36:03] on Mount Sinai now here was the fullness
[2:36:06] of God being manifested in Christ Jesus
[2:36:09] and Jesus opened the eyes of the blind
[2:36:12] amen he he calmed the storms he he
[2:36:16] healed the ears of the death he he
[2:36:19] opened the eyes of the blind he did all
[2:36:21] of this he you know and you wonder what
[2:36:23] could be greater what could be greater
[2:36:26] oh you're that poor black man oh since
[2:36:29] birth now he see what could be greater
[2:36:31] what could be greater than these
[2:36:33] Miracles what could be greater
[2:36:37] what could be right it's God With Us
[2:36:41] do you know John hot here it's in your
[2:36:43] job is in the boat with us
[2:36:46] it's a great moment ain't it yeah but
[2:36:48] there's something coming greater how in
[2:36:50] the world could you say that this is the
[2:36:52] greatest moment that a human being could
[2:36:55] ever have was to be right on the boat
[2:36:58] with Jehovah himself
[2:37:17] but now you can look
[2:37:19] and you can look back at that and you
[2:37:21] say his death
[2:37:24] was even greater than that
[2:37:29] his death was greater than open the
[2:37:31] blind eyes
[2:37:35] making cripples walk
[2:37:37] common stormy seas
[2:37:39] his death was greater than that
[2:37:42] because when he died he paid for my sins
[2:37:51] so now that we have something greater so
[2:37:54] what could be greater than if dying for
[2:37:57] me
[2:37:57] his resurrection
[2:38:01] his resurrection was greater than that
[2:38:03] because he didn't just if you just died
[2:38:06] for your sins and your sins passed was
[2:38:08] taken care of what about your sins in
[2:38:10] the future
[2:38:11] amount but his resurrection was greater
[2:38:14] than his death
[2:38:16] and if you can receive it his Ascension
[2:38:19] was greater than his resurrection
[2:38:22] and is coming back on the day of
[2:38:25] Pentecost what's greater than all of
[2:38:27] that
[2:38:28] because if he did not come to dwell in
[2:38:32] you it was in vain for him to die if he
[2:38:35] just went back into heaven and
[2:38:37] disappeared we would be in a bunch of
[2:38:39] trouble today
[2:38:40] [Applause]
[2:38:43] so what happened on the day of Pentecost
[2:38:47] that was greater than his work at
[2:38:48] Calvary
[2:38:52] and it was but let me just say it could
[2:38:55] have never been done without his work at
[2:38:58] Calvary
[2:38:59] you see one was making the way for the
[2:39:02] next
[2:39:04] so the Lesser was making way for the
[2:39:06] greater
[2:39:09] come on church I'm looking back at
[2:39:11] Pentecost back there two thousand years
[2:39:13] ago that's the Lesser making way for the
[2:39:16] greater
[2:39:20] amen now listen you see because of you
[2:39:23] that just if you hadn't poured out his
[2:39:25] spirit that had been nobody cleansed to
[2:39:27] receive it if he hadn't died and shed
[2:39:29] his blood
[2:39:30] and we be in the same trouble that they
[2:39:33] would have been in the Garden of Eden if
[2:39:34] they'd have taken from the Tree of Life
[2:39:36] and ate without
[2:39:41] Jesus dying to cleanse for sin
[2:39:44] they would have lived eternally in sin
[2:39:47] what if we'd have got the Holy Ghost
[2:39:49] without Calvary
[2:39:51] to cleanse our sins we'd have been just
[2:39:54] like that
[2:39:55] hold your thought
[2:39:57] I got you listening
[2:40:00] so
[2:40:03] yet the coming of the Holy Ghost
[2:40:06] for God to come and dwell in men
[2:40:10] was a million times greater
[2:40:14] but it could have never happened without
[2:40:16] Calvary this is the law was part of the
[2:40:19] process Calvary was a necessary part for
[2:40:22] without the shedding of the the blood of
[2:40:24] the lamb and the slaying of the life it
[2:40:27] would have never been released to come
[2:40:28] back on the believer
[2:40:30] Jesus said if I don't go away if I just
[2:40:33] live with you
[2:40:35] from now on the comforter can't come
[2:40:39] but if I go away I'll send my spirit
[2:40:43] back to you the comforter which is the
[2:40:46] Holy Ghost
[2:40:47] but as long as I stay here Jesus we want
[2:40:50] you to stay here this is the greatest
[2:40:51] thing God with us Emmanuel God With Us
[2:40:54] he said no no I've got to go
[2:40:57] because there's some greater coming than
[2:40:59] me
[2:41:00] there's going to be an experience
[2:41:01] greater than you walking with me on the
[2:41:04] shores of Galilee I am not going to just
[2:41:07] walk with you I'm going to be in you
[2:41:11] hallelujah amen giving you an overcoming
[2:41:15] life it won't be me saying don't do this
[2:41:17] don't do that let's walk here let's go
[2:41:19] there this is the will this hate the way
[2:41:21] it'll be me and you
[2:41:26] but what could be greater
[2:41:29] that deity coming down in the pillar of
[2:41:31] fire and birthing sons and filling them
[2:41:33] with deity
[2:41:35] and them staggered and drunk under the
[2:41:37] inspiration of the Holy Ghost yet Paul
[2:41:39] says
[2:41:40] that this is only a deposit
[2:41:44] what you received is just a deposit it's
[2:41:47] a down payment it's not even close to me
[2:41:50] in the full payment
[2:41:54] somebody help me preach
[2:41:56] Pentecost received the deposit
[2:42:01] we must receive that deposit too
[2:42:04] amen but in this day there's more than
[2:42:06] the deposit
[2:42:08] amen there's a people that comes into
[2:42:10] full possession
[2:42:11] somebody with me Amen brother Brandon
[2:42:14] said in the invisible Union of the Bride
[2:42:16] he said here come Luther out Reformation
[2:42:18] his words his church his one won't work
[2:42:21] today Wesley's want Pentecostals one it
[2:42:24] worked in USA then their day this is
[2:42:26] another day
[2:42:27] this is the opening of them Seven Seals
[2:42:30] I know that sounds strange to you
[2:42:33] but God did vindicate it so perfectly
[2:42:38] there's no question in it
[2:42:41] just perfectly now brother Branham is
[2:42:44] saying here he said their words
[2:42:47] Pentecostals words of Azusa Street
[2:42:50] Methodist Wesley won't work this is
[2:42:53] another day
[2:42:54] this is the opening of the book
[2:43:00] the revealing of those Seven Seals
[2:43:03] I know it sounds strange to you and even
[2:43:06] now we have difficulty wrapping our
[2:43:08] minds around it
[2:43:11] amen it sounds strange people just like
[2:43:13] when John came out and said Behold the
[2:43:15] Lamb of God to take away the sin the
[2:43:18] world and they said oh what do you mean
[2:43:19] we've had the Lamb of God all of these
[2:43:21] years
[2:43:23] we were told by Moses bring one examine
[2:43:27] him must be without blemish we went
[2:43:29] through this tradition for a Passover
[2:43:31] for years and you mean there's a greater
[2:43:33] lamb coming than this yeah and he looks
[2:43:36] at me and says Behold the Lamb
[2:43:39] because you would be a lamb of all Lambs
[2:43:44] here would be a one without blemish
[2:43:47] greater than all of these
[2:43:49] more holy than any of these
[2:43:52] somebody with me now now we've had all
[2:43:55] this preaching all these years of what
[2:43:57] he did at Calvary
[2:43:58] a lot of people stopped there they Don't
[2:44:00] Preach what happened in the upper room
[2:44:02] amen they don't they just talk about
[2:44:04] forgiveness of sins and well if you
[2:44:06] believe the message you've received the
[2:44:08] Holy Ghost and then bypass completely
[2:44:11] The Upper Room experience
[2:44:14] you know Peter even had a revelation you
[2:44:17] say well we got Revelation brother Tim
[2:44:19] we don't have experience we got
[2:44:20] Revelation well Peter had a revelation
[2:44:23] from God
[2:44:24] and still didn't have the Holy Ghost
[2:44:28] is that right they weren't converted but
[2:44:31] the church World said it goes right on
[2:44:32] well we believed on Christ we've
[2:44:34] accepted his personal savior we got the
[2:44:36] Holy Ghost and when we believed you do
[2:44:39] not
[2:44:42] so they avoid Pentecost altogether and
[2:44:44] we have something to go as far as
[2:44:45] Pentecost and say well we have the upper
[2:44:47] room experience and they go no further
[2:44:50] but he said it's another day this is the
[2:44:53] opening of The Seven Seals I know it
[2:44:55] sounds strange to you listen the devil
[2:44:58] does his work
[2:45:00] the devil God in those priests in those
[2:45:03] High priests that go that told them just
[2:45:06] keep the law of Moses
[2:45:08] you know don't don't accept this new
[2:45:10] covenant
[2:45:11] he had to explain to the Hebrews he said
[2:45:14] listen we got something better
[2:45:17] this is greater
[2:45:19] you ever read the book of Hebrews it's
[2:45:21] all about greater and better
[2:45:23] we got a better Covenant
[2:45:25] we got a better sacrifice we got a
[2:45:28] Greater Tabernacle we have a greater
[2:45:31] priesthood everything this is better
[2:45:33] this is better this is better this is
[2:45:35] better today you look out there yeah
[2:45:37] yeah yeah yeah of course this is better
[2:45:39] what are you talking about Paul Paul was
[2:45:41] talking about a bunch of people that
[2:45:43] Satan was in their ears saying you know
[2:45:46] just keep the law of Moses and Paul was
[2:45:48] having to say listen this is better this
[2:45:51] is greater
[2:45:53] and the devil will do everything he can
[2:45:55] to see that you don't understand the
[2:45:59] greatness of the Lamb taking the book
[2:46:01] and loosened the seals and handed you
[2:46:05] the title deed
[2:46:11] so we come right down the same point
[2:46:14] and now there's a further work of the
[2:46:17] Lamb
[2:46:18] and he's opening the Seven Seals I know
[2:46:20] that sounds strange to you how could
[2:46:23] this be greater
[2:46:25] think about it views walking
[2:46:28] into glory for with the with them on the
[2:46:31] road to Emmaus
[2:46:32] and the glorified one came walking with
[2:46:35] you after the resurrection and you
[2:46:37] recognize and know he who he is the
[2:46:40] glorified one the resurrection you could
[2:46:42] say what could be more awesome than
[2:46:45] walking down the road hand in hand with
[2:46:48] the glorified Christ
[2:46:50] sitting there and watching him break off
[2:46:52] a piece of bread hand the wine to us and
[2:46:56] multiply it like he did
[2:46:58] well what could be greater what can be
[2:47:02] greater well the answer to that is the
[2:47:04] resurrected one coming to live in you
[2:47:06] now you're saying well what could be
[2:47:08] more awesome than Pentecost what could
[2:47:11] be more awesome than what happened two
[2:47:13] thousand years ago I'm trying to tell
[2:47:15] you but don't be dull of hearing the
[2:47:18] opening of The Seven Seals because it's
[2:47:21] that handy back of the entire
[2:47:24] inheritance
[2:47:25] it's not just another deposit
[2:47:29] come on church amen that means that
[2:47:32] where they are they only got a deposit
[2:47:34] but you receive the foulness
[2:47:37] amen that means they got their Earnest
[2:47:40] and the claim on their mortal body but
[2:47:43] you by receiving the same Earnest or in
[2:47:45] this day an hour or receiving a message
[2:47:48] that is changing you amen that will
[2:47:51] glorify your body that'll bring the dead
[2:47:53] out of the grave amen notice now it is a
[2:47:57] time where the angel stands at the
[2:48:00] maturity of times when it goes back to
[2:48:03] its original condition
[2:48:06] back to where Pentecost was
[2:48:09] and now where they fail we continue on
[2:48:14] where they went down and started Church
[2:48:18] ages
[2:48:19] we in the ages by taking a rapture
[2:48:24] Hallelujah this is real church amen this
[2:48:27] is where that you are no longer a part
[2:48:30] of the Fallen World
[2:48:32] come on Amen you're not a part of the
[2:48:36] Fallen World Sodom is fulfilling this
[2:48:38] part it is falling worse said worse and
[2:48:41] worse and worse and worse and give the
[2:48:43] days are getting more and more evil but
[2:48:45] that's not you
[2:48:47] you are the people of the Rapture and
[2:48:51] you're not going down you're going up
[2:48:54] Hallelujah you're going up and you're
[2:48:56] going up you are rising you are not
[2:48:59] following you are not powered you're not
[2:49:02] going backwards
[2:49:04] Hallelujah
[2:49:06] the title deed that was lost by Adam has
[2:49:10] been opened
[2:49:11] and handed back to your possession
[2:49:17] and to show you how close we were
[2:49:22] God showed you the power of this word
[2:49:27] it will create squirrels
[2:49:31] it will take tumors out of a body
[2:49:35] thousands of miles away
[2:49:38] the word going forth
[2:49:40] unlimited by distance time space
[2:49:43] out of that moving into the eternals
[2:49:46] right down to a little woman and
[2:49:48] Vanishing a tumor it'll cause a
[2:49:50] resurrection of a little fish

[2:49:58] the Lost
[2:49:59] to be saved

[2:50:09] the cusp
[2:50:10] and this third full ministry does what

[2:50:24] it can resurrect a little fish it didn't
