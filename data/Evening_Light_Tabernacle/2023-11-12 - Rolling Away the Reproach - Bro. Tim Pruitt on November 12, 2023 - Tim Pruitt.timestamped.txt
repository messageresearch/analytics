[1:08:48] side of Jordan Westward and all the
[1:08:51] kings of the Canaanites which were by
[1:08:54] the Sea heard that the Lord had dried up
[1:08:57] the Waters of Jordan from before the
[1:09:00] children of Israel until we were passed
[1:09:02] over that their hearts melted and
[1:09:06] neither was their spirit in them anymore
[1:09:09] because of the children of Israel and at
[1:09:13] that time the Lord said unto Joshua make
[1:09:16] thee sharp knives and circumcise again
[1:09:19] the children of Israel the second time
[1:09:21] and Joshua made him Sharp knes and
[1:09:24] circumcised the children of Israel at
[1:09:27] the heel of the
[1:09:28] foreskins and this is the cause why
[1:09:31] Joshua did circumcise all the people
[1:09:34] that came out of Egypt that were males
[1:09:37] even all the men of War died in the
[1:09:40] wilderness by the way after they came
[1:09:42] out of Egypt now all the people that
[1:09:45] came out were circumcised but all the
[1:09:47] people that were born in the wilderness
[1:09:49] by the way as they came out forth out of
[1:09:51] Egypt them they had not circumcised for
[1:09:55] the children of Israel walked 40 years
[1:09:57] in the wilderness till all the people
[1:10:00] that were Men of War which came out of
[1:10:02] Egypt were consumed because they obeyed
[1:10:05] not the voice of the Lord unto whom the
[1:10:08] Lord swear that he would not show them
[1:10:10] the land which the Lord uh swear unto
[1:10:14] their fathers that he would give us a
[1:10:16] land that floweth with milk and honey
[1:10:19] and their children whom he raised up in
[1:10:22] their stad them Joshua was circumcised
[1:10:26] for they were uncircumcised because they
[1:10:29] had not circumcised them by the way and
[1:10:32] it came to pass when they had done
[1:10:34] circumcising all the people that they
[1:10:37] Abode in their places in the camp till
[1:10:41] they were whole and the Lord said unto
[1:10:44] Joshua this day have I rolled away the
[1:10:47] reproach of Egypt from off of you
[1:10:51] wherefore the name of the place is
[1:10:53] called gilgal un this day amen God bless
[1:10:58] you as you're
[1:10:59] seated know I I spoken to you about
[1:11:02] crossing over into the Holy Ghost which
[1:11:06] is our promised land it's the land of
[1:11:08] our inheritance and how we have been
[1:11:11] positioned there and I I thought today
[1:11:13] many of the songs that we we sung you
[1:11:16] know even uh point out to us our
[1:11:20] position our place and what we're called
[1:11:23] for far in this day and hour and um you
[1:11:27] know and and of course um I have spoke
[1:11:29] to you about you know con continuously
[1:11:32] about crossing over into the Holy Ghost
[1:11:36] and his promises and and and why why is
[1:11:40] this because it is as it was in the days
[1:11:43] of Noah the Bible says that we should
[1:11:46] reckon that day and of course we see the
[1:11:48] marriage the given in marriage we see
[1:11:50] the evil in the land and you know that
[1:11:53] the hearts of men on evil continually we
[1:11:55] see all of that but we also know that
[1:11:59] there in that day was a message and that
[1:12:02] message was get in the
[1:12:04] ark and of course today the ark we must
[1:12:08] get into is not this church it's not a
[1:12:11] certain group of people but it is the
[1:12:15] ark is the Holy Ghost and that is the
[1:12:17] message today so as Noah would scream
[1:12:21] out in his day there's going to be rain
[1:12:24] that will fall from Heaven we are saying
[1:12:28] there is fire that is about to fall from
[1:12:30] heaven and God has given us a way out of
[1:12:35] this all through and over the Judgment
[1:12:38] into a Rapture into a millennium ahead
[1:12:41] so you know the whole message of God is
[1:12:44] get in the ark amen and of course again
[1:12:48] the ark is the Holy Ghost now it is so
[1:12:51] important that that in the the second
[1:12:53] seal as the Angels were breaking the
[1:12:56] mystery of God that God would charge the
[1:13:00] people through the messenger you who
[1:13:02] have not been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:04] I command you in the name of the Lord
[1:13:07] Jesus Christ fall to your knees and
[1:13:09] don't get up until the Holy Spirit has
[1:13:12] Sanctified you thoroughly and filled you
[1:13:14] with his love and his goodness until
[1:13:16] your soul is So Satisfied in the
[1:13:19] presence of God that your whole desire
[1:13:22] is to serve him and walk with for him
[1:13:24] and work with him all the rest of your
[1:13:28] life now you know he could have just
[1:13:30] said you know you don't need the Holy
[1:13:32] Ghost we got something greater the seals
[1:13:34] are open but that ain't what he said he
[1:13:37] said that here as that you who have not
[1:13:40] been filled Fall on Your Knees and
[1:13:43] receive it it is it is of course
[1:13:46] imperative even it to to to know what
[1:13:51] God has charged us to do in this day and
[1:13:53] a prophet is charging us as the seals
[1:13:56] are open you know make sure you have
[1:13:58] that
[1:13:59] token now you say but well brother Tim
[1:14:03] this is all mot to me it really it
[1:14:06] doesn't apply I'm already in the land

[1:14:48] fear pulling them out of the fire hating
[1:14:51] even the garments spotted by the flesh
[1:14:53] oh yeah so again you know stay in the
[1:14:56] word faith comes by hearing and the

[1:16:08] enemy it's important that you know how
[1:16:11] to pray you know how to pray powerful
[1:16:14] atomic bombs of prayer brother bradam

[1:16:20] is that is that is on the face of the
[1:16:23] Earth is prayer he said it's more
[1:16:25] powerful than an atomic bomb I I wonder
[1:16:28] is the church using it are they afraid
[1:16:32] of of of what the world will say or what
[1:16:35] others will say or are they afraid to
[1:16:38] use what God has given them are we

[1:16:56] grudges amen letting it go old ODS let
[1:16:59] them go hard feelings let them go this
[1:17:03] is all about dispossessing your

[1:17:09] church amen seeing God move you know and
[1:17:13] and and believing God for for your
[1:17:16] family for that which is

[1:17:27] it in your
[1:17:29] marriage Amen Let It Come let there come
[1:17:32] an atmosphere of godliness about you and
[1:17:36] positive Faith filled words that come
[1:17:38] out of your
[1:17:39] mouth amen many of you need to say God
[1:17:42] retrained my mouth I I've been uttering
[1:17:45] things that are unbelief I've been
[1:17:47] uttering things of what I see or what I
[1:17:49] hear or the circumstances around me
[1:17:52] rather than that using Faith filled
[1:17:54] words I can overcome I can Rise Above
[1:17:58] This I can have a happy home I can have
[1:18:02] God move on my behalf I can walk in
[1:18:05] health and
[1:18:08] healing you see again it has to come
[1:18:11] something to change that the Holy Ghost
[1:18:13] change the atmosphere about you where
[1:18:15] you quit seeing things in a negative
[1:18:17] light and see things in a positive
[1:18:21] light look at for Mercy learning to live
[1:18:25] to give and show Mercy one of the most
[1:18:28] Harless spirits that I've ever I've seen
[1:18:31] among message followers is wanting to
[1:18:33] condemn everyone else to
[1:18:36] Hell amen I'll tell you what if you knew
[1:18:39] what hell was about you wouldn't want
[1:18:40] nobody to go there not even your worst
[1:18:43] enemy in fact the matter is brother
[1:18:45] brandom said you know there is no mortal
[1:18:48] no matter what they have done that can
[1:18:50] condemn another that's right he said I
[1:18:53] tell you he said no man no mortal cannot
[1:18:55] condemn another and even Jesus when he
[1:18:59] was given opportunity to condemn he said
[1:19:01] neither do I condemn you that's just go
[1:19:04] and S no
[1:19:06] more the Bible said of some have
[1:19:09] compassion making a difference amen here
[1:19:12] in the Holy Ghost you can have
[1:19:14] compassion and make a difference you
[1:19:17] make a difference in a in a young
[1:19:19] person's life or somebody else's life
[1:19:22] lifting a bird and helping in a
[1:19:24] situation and the Bible says others save
[1:19:27] and I think this is really applicable to
[1:19:30] us because the fire is about to fall he
[1:19:32] said others safe pulling them out of the
[1:19:38] fire and hating even the Garment that is
[1:19:42] spotted by the
[1:19:49] flesh hating even the Garment
[1:19:53] refusing to wear the
[1:19:55] Garment spotted by
[1:20:01] flesh not just shunning
[1:20:03] evil but shunning even its
[1:20:09] appearance how do I overcome brother Tim
[1:20:12] and things how do I win the battle it's
[1:20:14] not just by shunning the evil but a
[1:20:17] shunning even the appearance of it you
[1:20:20] walk away as far as you can you you you
[1:20:23] refuse to walk you know along with in in
[1:20:27] in the past with unbelievers you hold
[1:20:30] yourself up through yet having
[1:20:32] compassion and mercy and inviting them
[1:20:34] to come and walk with
[1:20:37] you now in our reading Israel types of
[1:20:40] believer and they have left the
[1:20:42] Wilderness haven't come through as we
[1:20:44] would say the believer coming through
[1:20:46] justification and sanctification and up
[1:20:49] to the isua street tasting of the Holy
[1:20:51] Ghost at Caden
[1:20:54] but now Joshua has directed them into
[1:20:57] the land of promise and the and the
[1:21:00] Jordan has rolled back and and and and
[1:21:04] of course in this crossing the Jordan
[1:21:07] represents
[1:21:10] death now here every denomination when
[1:21:13] as as we see everything comes to his
[1:21:16] Jordan everything is coming to his
[1:21:19] Jordan every system of man every Kingdom
[1:21:22] of man
[1:21:23] everything is coming to its Jordan every
[1:21:27] denomination has come to its Jordan God
[1:21:29] no longer uses
[1:21:31] them God used them for time and they
[1:21:34] were a blessing for time but that's not
[1:21:37] his method today of his
[1:21:40] message amen is the the message for the
[1:21:43] Rapture is it doesn't come through
[1:21:45] denominational
[1:21:47] trumpets so every denomination comes to
[1:21:50] its Jordan ever create of man every
[1:21:52] man's idea and every man's theology has
[1:21:56] to come to his Jordan you just can't
[1:21:59] bring it in with
[1:22:02] you not in be in the
[1:22:05] land and this is what we are in this
[1:22:07] church age you cannot bring Leo Deo with
[1:22:11] you you cannot bring its
[1:22:14] lukewarmness you cannot you cannot rely
[1:22:17] upon its
[1:22:18] riches am man you you understand it's
[1:22:22] rich es will not get you in a Rapture
[1:22:24] there's only one thing and that's a gold
[1:22:26] that is Tried by
[1:22:28] fire and so again you you see we're in
[1:22:31] this church age that every system of man
[1:22:34] has come to his Jordan and has died in
[1:22:36] the wilderness and we have arrived to
[1:22:39] the Holy Ghost and its
[1:22:43] fullness you say oh brother Tim that
[1:22:46] that that is that isn't something
[1:22:47] everybody knows no that is this has not
[1:22:50] been true to this age
[1:22:55] since the first age there was a
[1:22:57] departing from the faith and only in
[1:23:00] this day has a God brought us back to
[1:23:02] the fullness of the Holy
[1:23:04] Ghost each other age received its
[1:23:07] portion of the spirit that would be
[1:23:09] justified by faith or Sanctified or have
[1:23:12] the gifts of the Spirit as a Zeus street
[1:23:15] but only in this age in this time has
[1:23:18] God brought a people back to the
[1:23:20] fullness so tell me
[1:23:23] is there ever been a time to preach the
[1:23:25] Holy Ghost like right now because right
[1:23:29] now is being pour out in his
[1:23:32] fullness not portions of the
[1:23:35] spirit not even something of anointing
[1:23:38] on your spirit
[1:23:40] realm but something within the
[1:23:43] soul something that seals to the day of
[1:23:48] redemption so it represents every
[1:23:51] believer where
[1:23:53] Jordan represents whereever believer
[1:23:55] comes where you die to
[1:23:58] self and with self road back then you
[1:24:02] pass through the Jordan through and
[1:24:05] leaving sin and unbelief behind that
[1:24:08] must stay in the
[1:24:11] wilderness it don't fit in the Holy
[1:24:13] Ghost and the land of the spirit
[1:24:16] remember the divine order now there was
[1:24:19] a divine order of bringing them across
[1:24:22] God had commanded Joshua to take the ark
[1:24:26] representing the word on the shoulders
[1:24:28] of the Levites and to pass through this
[1:24:33] Jordan you see again God had an ordained
[1:24:37] way and he ordained that through
[1:24:40] preaching of the word that man might be
[1:24:43] saved amen the Paul said it pleased God
[1:24:46] to the foolishness of what we preach to
[1:24:48] save those who believe so so again uh
[1:24:52] how was it that the Jordan is crossed it
[1:24:55] is crossed by the word on the shoulders
[1:24:59] of the levite making the way
[1:25:02] across the preaching of the word will
[1:25:06] get you to the altar through to death to
[1:25:10] S to come to your Jordan Amen to realize
[1:25:14] Sin is Sin and wrong is wrong amen and
[1:25:18] to condemn you of the of the evil in the
[1:25:20] past so it can die
[1:25:23] yeah I mean condemn it that it will
[1:25:26] die because you cannot bring sin across
[1:25:30] into the Holy
[1:25:32] Ghost and it takes the preaching of the
[1:25:35] word to do that you remember in the in
[1:25:38] the scripture even to return the word as
[1:25:41] we have had the return of the word in
[1:25:43] this day again we didn't get a new word
[1:25:47] a new word didn't
[1:25:48] come it was the return of the word and
[1:25:53] the same gospel that Paul preached
[1:25:55] returned to the church David had brought
[1:25:59] David what had a desire to bring the ark
[1:26:02] back to put it back in its place to
[1:26:05] bring it to
[1:26:07] Jerusalem because you know everywhere
[1:26:09] that the ark was the blessings
[1:26:12] flowed and because of the battle because
[1:26:15] of kabad being written over the doors of
[1:26:18] the hearts because that the glory of the
[1:26:21] Lord had Departed CA that the ark had
[1:26:23] been taken down to the villain Steins it
[1:26:26] had been moved out of his
[1:26:28] place and I'll tell you what we have
[1:26:30] went for years and years and years with
[1:26:32] the word out of its
[1:26:34] place we have went through centuries and
[1:26:37] ages and times with the word of God
[1:26:40] being on his place this is the day it
[1:26:43] returns Hallelujah do you realize where
[1:26:47] you're at you're in the day where the
[1:26:48] word is put back in his proper place and
[1:26:51] God is given pre
[1:26:53] Eminence you're you're you're in the
[1:26:55] you're in the day and the age where the
[1:26:58] truths of the Bible that have been
[1:26:59] misplaced are not placed in the proper
[1:27:03] place now I want you to think of
[1:27:06] this David did it he wanted the word
[1:27:10] returned but he actually brought death
[1:27:12] because he tried to bring the ark the
[1:27:15] same way the Philistines did that's
[1:27:17] right you see he used their example they
[1:27:20] made a they made an ox
[1:27:23] and a card with and pulled by oxen or by
[1:27:26] by some cows and and here they were they
[1:27:29] take it taken these and put the Ark on
[1:27:32] it and put offerings in it all of that
[1:27:35] because judgment had struck them because
[1:27:37] they had the Ark of
[1:27:42] God
[1:27:44] Amen let me tell
[1:27:48] you here is stayed right down at the
[1:27:51] edge of Israel and had not been put in
[1:27:53] the proper place and David said the
[1:27:55] words got to be put back in the proper
[1:27:57] place that ought to be the desire of
[1:28:00] every Christian today Lord every word
[1:28:02] put right in its proper place whether
[1:28:05] it's Holiness let it be in its proper
[1:28:07] place amen whe whether it's healing let
[1:28:11] it be put in his proper place you know
[1:28:13] when the healing is put in this proper
[1:28:15] place then that Miracles take place when
[1:28:18] the gifts of the Spirit are put in the
[1:28:20] proper place God Speak
[1:28:23] amen God reveals
[1:28:27] himself but David there tried to bring
[1:28:30] the ark like the Philistines did and God
[1:28:33] had an ordained way to bring it right
[1:28:36] that's right and he failed to consult
[1:28:38] the word he failed to consult the
[1:28:41] prophet amen the prophet would have told
[1:28:43] him the word amen and so here he comes
[1:28:47] along with his own homemade new Ox card
[1:28:51] and bringing along and and they're
[1:28:52] dancing and they're shouting and they're
[1:28:54] rejoicing and everything before the ark
[1:28:58] and a
[1:28:59] man a sincere
[1:29:01] man reached out to steady the ark when
[1:29:04] it's when the oxin
[1:29:07] stumbled and he
[1:29:09] died you see it shows it will bring
[1:29:12] death for those not anointed of God to
[1:29:15] handle the
[1:29:16] ark you you you have to be careful with
[1:29:19] this you you got to realize even today
[1:29:22] only the anointed of God only the
[1:29:25] anointed of God can handle the
[1:29:28] ark it takes a man called it takes a man
[1:29:31] set apart it takes a man consecrated it
[1:29:35] takes a man who is a Nazarite to God
[1:29:39] Amen dedicated to God anointed by the
[1:29:42] spirit not somebody who just decides I'm
[1:29:45] going to be a preacher but somebody
[1:29:47] called of God and ordained of God to be
[1:29:50] used of God
[1:29:53] that's why we must have God called
[1:29:56] men that's right now death didn't come
[1:30:00] because David rejoiced and danced before
[1:30:02] the Lord that's not the reason death
[1:30:04] Came Death came because he didn't
[1:30:07] consult the word for how to bring the
[1:30:10] ark he copied the way the Philistines
[1:30:12] had sent the ark and back on a new Ox
[1:30:15] cart pulled by by some auction and David

[1:30:44] the Prophet come back to him said you
[1:30:45] didn't bring it God's ordained way I've
[1:30:48] got a way to have the word brought and
[1:30:52] the word must be restored by being
[1:30:55] carried on the shoulders of the
[1:31:01] Levites

[1:31:05] carried notice not Creeds of men a lot
[1:31:08] of men carry something and they're

[1:31:24] promised land and all his
[1:31:26] promises but any true Minister will
[1:31:29] carry the word opening up the Jordan
[1:31:32] into the Holy
[1:31:34] Ghost a Creed a Creed or a dogma of
[1:31:38] saying I believe the message will not
[1:31:40] get you across Jordan preaching
[1:31:43] psychology the study of the Mind the
[1:31:45] science of Personality won't get you
[1:31:47] into the Holy Ghost it it won't even fix

[1:32:22] until it changes the atmosphere in your
[1:32:24] life and your
[1:32:27] home
[1:32:28] oh the only way you can come through
[1:32:31] Jordan of death to self and the Holy
[1:32:33] Ghost is by following the word carried
[1:32:37] by true
[1:32:39] Ministry and I just want to say there is
[1:32:41] a true
[1:32:43] Ministry I you know i' I've had to say I
[1:32:47] I've had to say to someone who who told
[1:32:49] me well I don't believe in the ministry
[1:32:51] I don't I don't believe in Preachers I
[1:32:52] don't believe in pastors I ain't found
[1:32:54] one that's true everyone that's going
[1:32:57] astray and I looked back and I said you
[1:32:59] can't say that and be a
[1:33:02] believer it's
[1:33:04] impossible that's impossible if you're a
[1:33:06] Believer you have to believe what God
[1:33:08] Said and God said God said I said in the
[1:33:12] church Apostles prophets teachers
[1:33:14] evangelists pastors some people can't be
[1:33:17] Pastor they evidently aren't
[1:33:20] cheap
[1:33:22] they sit right there and with the in the
[1:33:24] hearing of the ear that is still
[1:33:26] uncircumcised cannot hear what the
[1:33:28] spirit is
[1:33:30] saying amen but you see again again I
[1:33:34] don't care how many false Ministries
[1:33:37] rise up there has to be a true one
[1:33:40] somewhere amen it's it's impossible for
[1:33:43] it not
[1:33:44] to as I spoke to this brother about it
[1:33:47] you know and he said well I don't
[1:33:48] believe in Preachers I don't believe in
[1:33:50] pastors ain't never one of them I ain't
[1:33:52] never found one that's right I have
[1:33:54] never found one that stay true I've
[1:33:56] always seen them Sway and pulled away
[1:33:59] and I said
[1:34:01] well then you got a problem bigger than
[1:34:03] not thought you have a problem with your
[1:34:07] God your God is a little bitty weak God
[1:34:10] and a powerless God because if he's not
[1:34:14] able to keep a Man true to him and have
[1:34:16] someone to preach the unadulterated word
[1:34:19] he ain't God he ain't big enough
[1:34:22] but I want you to understand that God
[1:34:24] has raised up men in this
[1:34:27] hour just like he's raised up a bride in
[1:34:30] this hour men who will be true to the
[1:34:36] word the word still must be carried on
[1:34:39] the shoulders of
[1:34:40] ministers Jesus commissioned us to do it
[1:34:44] he showed but that the word preached by
[1:34:47] the ministry would open the river of
[1:34:49] death to self and make an entrance into
[1:34:53] the land of the
[1:34:54] promise true preachers are going to help
[1:34:57] you across
[1:34:59] Jordan they're going to make a way
[1:35:02] across Jordan they'll make altar calls
[1:35:07] available amen that preach sermons with
[1:35:11] conviction with power to change lives
[1:35:15] amen because they will stand in the
[1:35:17] middle of the river of Jordan amen with
[1:35:19] their feet planted in and see the waters
[1:35:22] part so you can
[1:35:24] cross Hallelujah I want you to consider
[1:35:27] the last words and the last instructions
[1:35:30] that Jesus gave to his disciples he said
[1:35:32] in Mark 16:15 he said go to all the
[1:35:35] world and preach the gospel to all
[1:35:39] creation this is what his whole desire
[1:35:42] was the instructions that he had was to
[1:35:45] give a commission and let me just say
[1:35:47] this is the Great Commission and brother
[1:35:50] Bram told us clearly denominations
[1:35:52] cannot fulfill this he said they can't
[1:35:55] agree on one scripture much less all of
[1:35:57] the scripture and all the Seven Seals
[1:36:00] have been open I'm quoting you from the
[1:36:02] invisible Union you can go read it
[1:36:05] yourself and and he said you know there
[1:36:07] the the seals have been opened and he
[1:36:10] said now now the Great Commission can be
[1:36:13] fulfilled do you realize we are the
[1:36:17] people that must fulfill the commission
[1:36:22] that we must finish the
[1:36:24] job Hallelujah not just preachers every
[1:36:28] one of us there's a bride not
[1:36:34] preachers amen God's not taking a bunch
[1:36:37] of preachers and them only he's taking a
[1:36:39] bride of people without spot or wrinkle
[1:36:43] and I'm talking about you and we have a
[1:36:45] commission to
[1:36:49] fulfill Luke 24:47 said that repentance
[1:36:54] and remission of sin should be preached
[1:36:57] in his name among all nations beginning
[1:37:00] at
[1:37:01] Jerusalem so again here was the
[1:37:03] instructions the last words of Jesus
[1:37:06] that repentance and remission of sin
[1:37:08] should be
[1:37:10] preached amen this is a important part
[1:37:13] of the word to do is preach
[1:37:16] repentance preach remission of sins
[1:37:20] preach their a god rich in Mercy preach
[1:37:23] there's a God of Grace that is bigger
[1:37:27] than your problem bigger than your past
[1:37:29] bigger than your
[1:37:34] sinsu but he instructed them not to
[1:37:36] preach until they were endued with
[1:37:38] powerful on
[1:37:39] high that don't you go don't you do
[1:37:41] anything till you're endued with
[1:37:43] powerful on high but when you get the
[1:37:44] Holy Ghost and preach because God
[1:37:47] doesn't want men preaching without the
[1:37:49] Holy
[1:37:50] Ghost yeah I've heard men brag and say I
[1:37:54] can I'm I can preach without the
[1:37:55] anointing well I don't want to hear it
[1:37:57] it's
[1:38:01] worthless amen it's just only puffed up
[1:38:03] ideas of man if you can preach without
[1:38:05] the anointing it's worthless we must
[1:38:08] have the anointing every service has got
[1:38:11] to be anointed every sermon has to be
[1:38:14] anointed amen every prayer an anointed
[1:38:17] prayer amen you know and we ought to be
[1:38:20] a people come together and say God
[1:38:23] whatever happens in this service let the
[1:38:26] anointing
[1:38:28] fall don't let us have a song without
[1:38:31] the
[1:38:32] [Applause]
[1:38:33] anointing I thought I thought today as I
[1:38:36] come to church and I just pushed the
[1:38:39] button and listening to some I guess
[1:38:42] they call it gospel great or something I
[1:38:45] thought well maybe maybe I can maybe I
[1:38:47] can enjoy a song from this as I go to
[1:38:50] church and I I heard Ling you know
[1:38:52] leaning on the Everlasting Arms and then
[1:38:55] they broke out into another and you know
[1:38:57] I I thought it was a a great song you
[1:38:59] know as it did but then it turned off
[1:39:02] just to be a see how you could show off
[1:39:04] how great your voice was reach the
[1:39:07] highest notes and you know everybody to
[1:39:10] admire how great a singer this was and
[1:39:13] you know all of that that's not
[1:39:15] glorifying
[1:39:18] God that's not worship come on worship
[1:39:22] is when a song gets
[1:39:24] anointed when we get moved by the spirit
[1:39:27] and and the Holy Ghost falls down upon
[1:39:29] us amen I believe in anointed musicians
[1:39:32] I believe we got
[1:39:34] them I believe in anointed singers I
[1:39:36] believe we have them amen I believe the
[1:39:39] song service was anointed this morning
[1:39:41] with an anointed anointed song
[1:39:44] leader amen I believe the whole service
[1:39:47] needs to be
[1:39:48] anointed and I believe the preacher
[1:39:50] needs to be anointed but also believe
[1:39:52] the congregation needs to be
[1:39:55] anointed and I say God let the anointing
[1:39:59] let don't remain just here on the pulpit
[1:40:02] but let it flow out all the way from the
[1:40:05] front all the way to the back
[1:40:11] pew when Peter preached he opened up the
[1:40:17] path the path through the Jordan over
[1:40:21] into the Holy Ghost he was given the key
[1:40:24] to do so that's right the key to back in
[1:40:27] the days of Joshua was the priest take
[1:40:30] the word put it on the shoulders and
[1:40:33] it'll open up a path this same key was
[1:40:37] used by Peter you don't believe it let
[1:40:41] me tell you when they come out of the
[1:40:43] upper room and they were empowered for
[1:40:45] on high the first thing that happened
[1:40:46] was a sermon was
[1:40:49] preached an anointed sermon and it was
[1:40:53] so anointed 3,000 got the Holy Ghost
[1:40:57] outwards Hallelujah they all come under
[1:41:00] that
[1:41:01] anointing verse 14 of chapter 2 of Acts
[1:41:04] says but Peter standing up with the 11
[1:41:06] lifted up his voice well I don't believe
[1:41:08] in shouting well you just got in the
[1:41:10] wrong
[1:41:12] crowd amen you get filled with the Holy
[1:41:14] Ghost The Voice gets lifted up oh yeah I
[1:41:18] realized Jesus taught in the streets
[1:41:20] didn't look his voice but also realized
[1:41:22] that he stood at the feast and cried
[1:41:25] shouted If any man thirst let him come
[1:41:28] to me and
[1:41:30] drink Hallelujah and here Peter an
[1:41:33] anointed preacher steps out on the
[1:41:35] anointing and he lifts up his voice and
[1:41:37] said you men of Judea and all that dwell
[1:41:40] in Jerusalem be this known to you and
[1:41:43] hearken unto my words for these are not
[1:41:46] drunken as you supposed see and this is
[1:41:47] the third hour of the day but this is
[1:41:50] that which the prophet Joel has spoken
[1:41:52] listen he pointed right to the
[1:41:56] word amen here he is carrying the word
[1:41:59] this is out I'm going to explain what
[1:42:02] has happened you don't understand what
[1:42:04] is happening but let me tell you I can
[1:42:06] show you by the scripture and the
[1:42:08] scripture opened up understanding and
[1:42:10] opened up Jordan for many men and women
[1:42:13] that day and they were filled with the
[1:42:15] spirit of
[1:42:19] God what do Peter doing he's shouldering
[1:42:22] the
[1:42:23] word and as he shoulders the word then
[1:42:25] the question is asked what shall we do
[1:42:29] Brethren what shall we do men and
[1:42:31] Brethren and here he comes back again
[1:42:35] with prophetic words that are just as
[1:42:37] prophetic today
[1:42:40] repent amen leave your sin behind
[1:42:44] you amen come down through death to sth
[1:42:48] cross over this Jordan and be baptized
[1:42:51] in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:42:53] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:42:55] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:42:58] promis is unto you and to your children
[1:43:00] and to all that are far off even right
[1:43:02] now to
[1:43:04] 2023 even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:43:06] shall
[1:43:08] call and he's still
[1:43:11] calling and you think his sermon was
[1:43:13] short it
[1:43:14] wasn't and with many other words did he
[1:43:16] testify and exhort saying save yourself
[1:43:19] from this un
[1:43:22] generation and they that gladly received
[1:43:24] the word were baptized and the same that
[1:43:26] were added to them was about 3,000
[1:43:30] Souls you think it stopped there did
[1:43:32] preach and stopped there they hung it up
[1:43:34] from there no at the house of Cornelius
[1:43:36] Souls were saved when the word was
[1:43:39] preached while Peter spake these words
[1:43:43] the Holy Ghost fell on them that
[1:43:45] believe amen oh my the preachers today
[1:43:48] would stand in the pull pit and preach
[1:43:50] fa Faith filled words words that will
[1:43:53] drive out sin and unbelief where the
[1:43:56] spirit of God will fall upon the people
[1:43:59] amen here again he said in in Romans
[1:44:02] 10:13 for whosoever shall call upon the
[1:44:04] name of the Lord shall be saved it is
[1:44:07] through the preaching of the word that
[1:44:09] men shall call verse verse 14 Romans
[1:44:11] 10:14 now how then shall They Call On
[1:44:15] Him whom they have not
[1:44:16] believed and how shall they believe in
[1:44:19] him of whom they have not heard amen and
[1:44:22] how shall they hear without a
[1:44:26] preacher you see God is an ordained way
[1:44:29] to get across this
[1:44:32] Jordan and the way the ordained way is
[1:44:35] the word carried on the shoulders of the
[1:44:37] levite and he says and how can they hear
[1:44:41] without a
[1:44:43] preacher well they ain't not I'm right
[1:44:45] you've got a problem your problem's with
[1:44:48] God you need to get it fixed
[1:44:51] amen amen and how shall they preach
[1:44:54] except they be sent that's so there
[1:44:57] again they have to be sin of God to be
[1:45:01] able to preach we don't want men just
[1:45:04] getting up and saying whatever comes to
[1:45:06] their mind or their own ideas come on we
[1:45:08] want men that are
[1:45:10] sent
[1:45:12] ordained called charged filled with the
[1:45:16] spirit knows how to cast Satan out
[1:45:21] amen hallelujah amen knowing their
[1:45:25] charge they have an ordained charge lay
[1:45:28] hands on the sick and they shall
[1:45:32] recover
[1:45:34] amen and how shall they preach except to
[1:45:36] be sent as written how beautiful are the
[1:45:39] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[1:45:41] peace and bring Glad Tidings of good
[1:45:44] things but they've not all all obeyed
[1:45:46] the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who have
[1:45:50] believed our report you see no matter
[1:45:53] how much the preacher preaches the
[1:45:55] report has to be
[1:45:58] believed and the effect on it is going
[1:46:01] to be on you believe in it if you
[1:46:04] believe the report then the arm of the
[1:46:07] Lord will be revealed to
[1:46:10] you it's easy for you as man just to
[1:46:13] fall on the doctor's
[1:46:15] report amen come on Amen but let's look
[1:46:18] at what was his report yes
[1:46:21] his report here is amen by his stripes
[1:46:25] you were
[1:46:26] healed so therefore what report are you
[1:46:29] going to
[1:46:30] believe so then faith comes by hearing
[1:46:34] and hearing the word of God
[1:46:38] preached so it didn't say that it did
[1:46:40] say that that's exactly what it was
[1:46:43] talking about preaching the word and
[1:46:45] faith comes by hearing the word when
[1:46:47] it's
[1:46:49] preached amen the whole object of
[1:46:51] getting people together like this this
[1:46:53] morning is that Faith would rise to the
[1:46:55] level of the promise so there could be
[1:46:57] Deliverance in the house of
[1:47:01] God
[1:47:03] Amen look at the example of the
[1:47:05] Ethiopian unich he was a man of great
[1:47:08] position under Queen Candace who was in
[1:47:12] charge of all of her treasure and this
[1:47:15] man had come to
[1:47:16] Jerusalem and he had a scroll and he was
[1:47:19] reading from the book of Isaiah as he
[1:47:21] rode along in his
[1:47:24] Chariot and an angel comes and appears
[1:47:26] to Phillip who's an evangelist the Bible
[1:47:29] calls him an evangelist and led him to
[1:47:32] take a a desert route and and as he is
[1:47:36] walking along he's he he joins there
[1:47:40] along the trail with a man this unic
[1:47:44] he's from
[1:47:45] Ethiopia and he's reading he's reading
[1:47:49] and the and from
[1:47:53] Isaiah and the angel directs Phillip to
[1:47:56] join him in his Chariot so Philip
[1:47:59] running up to him heard the man reading
[1:48:01] the prophet Isaiah and said do you
[1:48:03] really understand what you're
[1:48:06] reading now listen he was re he was
[1:48:09] hearing the words of the prophet he was
[1:48:13] reading the
[1:48:15] recording amen he was rehearsing the
[1:48:18] recording of the prophet of God and he
[1:48:21] didn't understand what he was reading
[1:48:25] until a preacher
[1:48:26] preached that why we don't need them
[1:48:28] brother you might need them more than
[1:48:30] you think I know you know that that
[1:48:32] really goes against the grain because a
[1:48:34] lot of people don't think I need a
[1:48:36] preacher I don't need a pastor they'll
[1:48:40] show up when they want to attend when
[1:48:42] they want to pretend when they want
[1:48:46] to amen but I tell you what this this
[1:48:49] man realized he said how how can I
[1:48:53] understand it unless someone guides me
[1:48:57] so he invites philli to get up on the
[1:48:58] Chariot with
[1:49:00] him and the place that he read was this
[1:49:04] he was led as a sheep to the slaughter
[1:49:08] and like a lamb dumb before his Sher so
[1:49:10] he opened not his mouth and in his
[1:49:13] humiliation his judgment was taken away
[1:49:16] who shall declare his generation for his
[1:49:19] life is taken from the earth so he looks
[1:49:22] over there at Philip he said you know
[1:49:25] this this man this prophet he speaking
[1:49:28] is this of himself or some other man and
[1:49:31] then Philip opened his mouth and began
[1:49:34] at the same scripture and preached to
[1:49:38] him
[1:49:41] jesusall Hallelujah am this would lead
[1:49:45] to the man's conversion it would open up
[1:49:47] the Jordan for him and lead him into the
[1:49:50] land of the Holy Ghost to the man said
[1:49:52] here's water what is hinder I want to be
[1:49:55] baptized right now amen and here he gets
[1:49:58] baptized and immediately the spirit of
[1:50:01] God picks Phillip up and transport him I
[1:50:02] don't know how many miles away to
[1:50:04] another
[1:50:06] place Hallelujah that's the way the
[1:50:10] gospel started that's the way the gospel
[1:50:11] has to
[1:50:14] End
[1:50:16] Amen now brother bradam tells us and
[1:50:18] spoken words in the original seed he
[1:50:21] goes over this and he said although an
[1:50:23] angel directed Phillip to the unic he
[1:50:25] did not preach to the angel did not
[1:50:28] preach to the unic he sent a
[1:50:32] preacher amen well God don't use Angels
[1:50:35] no more yes he
[1:50:37] does don't use him for you because you
[1:50:39] don't believe but he still uses
[1:50:43] Angels amen but God never committed I
[1:50:46] want you to get this he never committed
[1:50:48] his preaching and his gospel to an angel
[1:50:51] I'm quoting to a prophet of a prophet
[1:50:53] right now brother Brandon amen God came
[1:50:56] down below angels and committed to man
[1:50:58] which are Sons he never committed it to
[1:51:04] Angels you say well if an angel was
[1:51:07] preaching
[1:51:08] that God didn't ordain angels to preach
[1:51:11] the gospel he ordained men to preach the
[1:51:15] gospel he never said to the angels I'll
[1:51:17] be with you and in you he said to men
[1:51:19] I'll be with you and in you he never
[1:51:22] said to Angels the things I do you'll do
[1:51:24] also he said to men the things I do
[1:51:26] you'll do
[1:51:27] also the gospel comes by preaching of
[1:51:30] the word god manifests himself through
[1:51:33] human beings amen the only eyes that God
[1:51:36] has on Earth is mine and yours the only
[1:51:40] hands he has is our hands God working in
[1:51:42] his people God in his Universe God in
[1:51:44] his word God in his son God in his
[1:51:48] people amen I actually took that from
[1:51:51] two different places
[1:51:54] sources but listen this in the message
[1:51:57] look he said God could have chose to
[1:52:00] preach the gospel by the Sun by the Moon
[1:52:03] by the Stars by the wind or by
[1:52:07] nature but he chose men to preach the
[1:52:11] gospel and that's where the voice of God
[1:52:14] will come
[1:52:16] from so brother Tim can it come from
[1:52:19] Jeffersonville yeah if men preach
[1:52:23] it amen can it come from two son yeah
[1:52:27] when men preach it the gospel must be
[1:52:31] preached into all the world so the end
[1:52:34] can
[1:52:35] come amen you you know here here we come
[1:52:38] the devil has done his job to take every
[1:52:40] gift from the church and now has
[1:52:42] attacked the ministerial gifts and say
[1:52:45] there ain't no
[1:52:48] more because why
[1:52:50] is God's way of speaking to his church
[1:52:53] the voice of God will come from the unic
[1:52:56] have been to Jerusalem we know to to
[1:52:58] worship he had been with all the great
[1:53:00] rabbis but he but he but he couldn't
[1:53:03] understand the scripture so here he
[1:53:05] studying the prophecy of Isaiah and even
[1:53:08] though an angel directed Philip to unic
[1:53:10] The Germ of Life had to come through the
[1:53:14] body through
[1:53:16] Phillip now so what's now he said here's
[1:53:19] a son
[1:53:20] Philip had the germ the message the word
[1:53:23] that's how a child can be born Philip
[1:53:25] laid his hands upon Him Philip baptized
[1:53:27] him in the name of Jesus Christ there
[1:53:29] came forth the spirit of God now The
[1:53:31] Germ had to come from the body what body
[1:53:34] Christ's body correct and philli was a
[1:53:37] member of that
[1:53:39] body oh that's why it's so important the
[1:53:42] body realize as we have the germ of
[1:53:46] life amen to impart to those an angel
[1:53:50] can't do your
[1:53:56] job again spok in words Original Seed he
[1:53:59] said the same thing took place in Acts
[1:54:01] 10:48 Philip was on the housetop an
[1:54:04] angel direct him to cornel's house but
[1:54:07] where did the word come from the body an
[1:54:09] angel come and said don't worry don't
[1:54:11] call nothing unclean just go on don't
[1:54:13] think nothing and while Peter spoke
[1:54:14] these words not the
[1:54:16] angel not the Cardinal while Peter spake
[1:54:19] these words what he was the body he had
[1:54:22] the word the word took hold oh brother
[1:54:25] oh my the angel directed it but life
[1:54:28] come through the body of
[1:54:31] Christ Hallelujah life comes through the
[1:54:34] body oh it's important then that the
[1:54:37] body be filled with the
[1:54:40] spirit that an atmosphere of the spirit
[1:54:42] of God is there where people can cross
[1:54:45] their
[1:54:46] Jordan Paul on his way to Damascus same
[1:54:50] thing a vision directed him but ananas
[1:54:53] had the germ he had the word the prophet
[1:54:56] ananas saw Vision said go up and lay
[1:54:58] your hands on him and said brother Saul
[1:55:01] the Lord appeared to you in the road
[1:55:02] coming down how did he know he had the
[1:55:04] word the word the Lord came to the
[1:55:06] prophet he prophesied laid hands on him
[1:55:08] he come he has set me up here I might I
[1:55:11] might lay my hands upon you and you
[1:55:13] would be healed and receive the Holy
[1:55:15] Ghost receive your sight the scales fell
[1:55:18] off of his eyes he Rose he and was
[1:55:21] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:55:24] and went to study the angel directed it
[1:55:26] that's right but ananas had the seed
[1:55:28] germ it takes the spirit of God to give
[1:55:31] eternal
[1:55:34] life Hallelujah it has to come through
[1:55:37] the
[1:55:40] body
[1:55:42] amen now said well brother Tim that's
[1:55:46] the problem we don't you know we don't
[1:55:48] have prophets anymore or you know every
[1:55:50] every preacher of the Gospel is a new
[1:55:53] testament
[1:55:54] Prophet by the way that's a
[1:55:59] quote every preacher of the Gospel is a
[1:56:02] new testament
[1:56:03] Prophet I I don't know I don't know you
[1:56:06] know I don't know what people are
[1:56:07] expecting Brother Joseph to be other
[1:56:09] than a preacher because that's the only
[1:56:11] kind of prophet he could
[1:56:15] be amen a preacher a lonely
[1:56:20] preacher one of them that's you know
[1:56:23] that's uh that's scorned and and
[1:56:26] disbelieved in and said has nothing to
[1:56:29] say that's all he can ever be is a
[1:56:35] preacher every new every preacher is a
[1:56:38] new testament Prophet every anointed man
[1:56:42] of God preaches under the anointing
[1:56:44] under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:47] he actually prophesies while he preaches
[1:56:51] amen if you can receive it as God
[1:56:53] speaking to you this morning if the word
[1:56:55] is being preached and says you're healed
[1:56:57] you can receive that and say I'm
[1:57:00] Healed why cuz God just spoke by the
[1:57:03] anointing of
[1:57:04] God and he said a pastor in the pull pit
[1:57:07] is is as more Authority than an angel
[1:57:10] from
[1:57:12] heaven
[1:57:14] hallelujah amen you said well they're
[1:57:16] not needed well
[1:57:18] okay
[1:57:21] we'll find out if you're word bride or
[1:57:24] not if you're a word bride you'll
[1:57:26] believe all the word philli was sent to
[1:57:29] the unic this is f from signs of his
[1:57:31] coming certainly Lord he was sent there
[1:57:33] by an Angel but it took Philip's hands
[1:57:36] we realize a vision came to Paul on his
[1:57:39] road to Damascus but it took anan's
[1:57:41] hands the church that called out the
[1:57:43] elected one Peter was sent by Vision to
[1:57:46] Cornelius but it took the Apostle not
[1:57:48] the vision not the angel
[1:57:51] God I pray that you'll wake the people
[1:57:53] up and let them see the promises here it
[1:57:55] was given to the church whosoever sends
[1:57:57] you remit to them they're remitted Lord
[1:57:59] we know there's many of them that claim
[1:58:01] it but they're unauthorized Apostles
[1:58:04] because they're
[1:58:07] unscriptural now you see for believers
[1:58:10] to be filled the germ of Life the Holy
[1:58:13] Ghost has to pass through the
[1:58:18] body a church isn't necessary it has to
[1:58:22] pass through the
[1:58:24] body the Assembly of Believers isn't
[1:58:26] necessary a pastor isn't necessary it
[1:58:29] has to pass through the
[1:58:32] body God has to have a body of Believers
[1:58:36] with preachers who believe to pass on
[1:58:39] the germ of
[1:58:41] life amen when you see people in you
[1:58:44] know that and a church full of people
[1:58:46] that are not spirit filled you know
[1:58:48] there's a problem either the body is is
[1:58:51] dead or the preacher is dead or
[1:58:54] both we need live
[1:58:58] Ministry amen we need live
[1:59:01] Ministry live Ministry is Anointed
[1:59:04] Ministry called Ministry set apart
[1:59:08] Ministry God hiding himself in
[1:59:10] Simplicity brother Bram said he could
[1:59:12] have ordained a son if he wanted to
[1:59:14] deliver him he could have ordained a
[1:59:16] wind to deliver him he could have
[1:59:17] ordained an angel to deliver him but
[1:59:19] Hallelujah God can do whatever he wants
[1:59:21] to do well how do you know brother
[1:59:22] Brandon God won't leave his
[1:59:26] program that's the reason we know that
[1:59:28] this day has got to be simple God always
[1:59:30] works in Simplicity God in the beginning
[1:59:33] that could have made the son preach the
[1:59:35] gospel or the winds preach the gospel or
[1:59:37] an angel preached the gospel but he
[1:59:39] ordained men for that purpose and he
[1:59:42] never changes it he never ordained
[1:59:46] denominations he never ordained groups
[1:59:48] of men he ordained men to preach the
[1:59:50] gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices
[1:59:54] or any Angelic being it was man and when
[1:59:57] he brought Deliverance to the people
[1:59:58] down there he sent a simple human being
[2:00:01] born of a simple family and a bunch of
[2:00:02] slaves speaking to Moses and he said oh
[2:00:05] what God God he is unfolding himself in
[2:00:11] Simplicity
[2:00:13] amen so let's look at Joshua 3:1
[2:00:17] 17 and the priest that bear the Ark of
[2:00:21] the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on
[2:00:24] dry ground in the midst of the
[2:00:27] Jordan and all the Israelites passed
[2:00:30] over on dry ground until all the people
[2:00:34] somebody say all all the people were
[2:00:37] passed clean over
[2:00:41] Jordan now remember what has happened
[2:00:44] the Jordan is at its flood
[2:00:47] stage it's impossible across
[2:00:52] it and God has an ordained way to get it
[2:00:55] open he wants to open the promised land
[2:00:59] now remember the Holy Ghost to the
[2:01:01] believer and what's he do he puts the
[2:01:04] word on the shoulders of the
[2:01:06] Levites and they step into the muddy
[2:01:10] Jordan and it
[2:01:13] opens and all the children of Israel
[2:01:16] pass over on dry ground
[2:01:20] until all the people were passed clean
[2:01:25] over
[2:01:26] Jordan you see I want to just point it
[2:01:29] this way the Holy Ghost must be preached
[2:01:32] until all the people are crossed
[2:01:37] over not half the people not some of the
[2:01:40] people not just the elders but to the
[2:01:44] last little one every one of them yeah
[2:01:49] amen and that's why I'm standing here in
[2:01:52] this Jordan today making a path doing
[2:01:55] the best I can to make sure that every
[2:01:58] last one of you get over into the Holy
[2:02:01] Ghost don't want to leave none of you
[2:02:03] behind in the other side in the
[2:02:09] wilderness then Joshua said now while
[2:02:11] the water is held back while a priest
[2:02:14] are in Jordan I want every every tribe
[2:02:17] get a stone and make a
[2:02:20] Memorial I'm not leaving this Jordan you
[2:02:22] said until men and women roll up a
[2:02:24] memorial stone that they can point to
[2:02:27] and say it's right here that I crossed
[2:02:30] over Hallelujah that's what every man
[2:02:33] and woman needs to do come on as you're
[2:02:35] passing through pick up a stone of
[2:02:38] confession place it on the other side
[2:02:41] and look back every time the devil said
[2:02:43] you're not in the Holy Ghost you're not
[2:02:45] in the land the promise is not yours you
[2:02:47] look back right here
[2:02:49] right here is a
[2:02:53] stone right here I crossed over right
[2:02:57] here now devil you get out of my land
[2:03:01] you're the
[2:03:08] Intruder I'm not leaving Jordan until
[2:03:10] men and women roll up a moral
[2:03:14] Stone you know you have you have people
[2:03:17] screaming at you today
[2:03:19] get out of that Jordan people don't need
[2:03:21] an
[2:03:22] experience all they need to do is just
[2:03:25] have a mental idea they've crossed over
[2:03:29] a confession of Faith you know I can
[2:03:34] confess all Faith they want to they on
[2:03:35] the other side of Jordan a cross get on
[2:03:38] over on the other

[2:07:22] of the Prophet life had to come from the
[2:07:24] body through Philip's

[2:11:51] and the Holy
[2:11:53] Ghost lazen every
[2:11:56] promise brother brandham said about the
[2:12:00] restoration of the Bride tree you'll
[2:12:02] find this in palor canor P caterpillar
[2:12:05] but he said if God doesn't come in my
[2:12:08] generation I'll die on the
[2:12:11] stumps I'll die on the stump where the
[2:12:14] cankerworms eat it to believing that
[2:12:17] Jesus Christ Christ and his church and
[2:12:19] his word is the same yesterday today and
[2:12:22] forever I might not be able to reduce it
[2:12:24] out there in all these branches because
[2:12:26] the old sap lines of here the
[2:12:28] denomination and Creed cut me off and
[2:12:31] dropped me like a hot potato that may be
[2:12:32] true but I'll Stand loyal on the stump
[2:12:35] and cry that the hour will come God will
[2:12:39] restore his church to its former
[2:12:43] condition so brother Bram said if I if
[2:12:45] he don't come in my generation I'm going
[2:12:47] to stand right right here on this stump
[2:12:50] yeah and I'm going to say here the brid
[2:12:52] tree was a down but God said I will
[2:12:55] restore and if he doesn't do it now he's
[2:12:58] going to do it and I'm going to stand
[2:13:01] there and preach it and believe it until
[2:13:04] I see
[2:13:05] it amen true preachers will do the same
[2:13:08] they'll die on this stump believing and
[2:13:09] pointing to a living God who is the same
[2:13:12] yesterday today and forever you'll hear
[2:13:15] it in their desires as they pray you'll
[2:13:17] hear here and when they preach we will
[2:13:20] see the word
[2:13:22] returned and there are ministers Levites
[2:13:26] determine to shoulder it and let David's
[2:13:30] dance and rejoice before
[2:13:33] it amen ain't no true Levi carrying the
[2:13:37] word and it's being returned and Davids
[2:13:39] are dancing before them and rejoicing
[2:13:41] and shouting are going to say don't do
[2:13:44] that that's all out of order boys you
[2:13:45] know this is not what to do now this is
[2:13:47] not how dignified message Believers are
[2:13:50] no if we're returning the word Let The
[2:13:52] Davids
[2:13:53] dance let the people Rejoice why the
[2:13:57] word's coming back it's something to be
[2:13:59] happy about it's something to shout
[2:14:01] about don't try to stop it and shut it
[2:14:04] up they tried to do that with Jesus and
[2:14:07] he said if they hold her peace the rocks
[2:14:09] will cry out God's able to these stones
[2:14:12] to raise children Abraham John the
[2:14:14] Baptist said you won't believe God's
[2:14:17] going to have somebody who
[2:14:19] will amen but it can't be carried on the
[2:14:23] oxcarts of denominational theories of
[2:14:26] receiving the Holy Ghost by a dried eyed
[2:14:29] confession it can't come on oxcarts of
[2:14:35] psychology listen I believe God's
[2:14:38] training men for this hour to take the
[2:14:42] full
[2:14:43] inheritance why would you preach this
[2:14:45] brother Tim because I believe this
[2:14:47] message
[2:14:48] has been the message that has brought us
[2:14:50] over Jordan into the Holy Ghost to
[2:14:53] possess it
[2:14:55] all and as God listen brother Brandon
[2:14:58] said as God leads his people through
[2:15:00] great trials to purge them and sometimes
[2:15:02] it takes years to do it and as far
[2:15:05] myself I believe that right now God is
[2:15:08] training such men to meet the front line
[2:15:11] men who are going through and at times
[2:15:13] shook from their feet sometimes look
[2:15:15] like the whole things have fallen but
[2:15:17] yet in the midst of it all they know
[2:15:20] that Living God and they keep their face
[2:15:22] forward keep moving
[2:15:24] on that's where we are we're like Joshua
[2:15:28] being reckless in our
[2:15:29] calling amen we need more light we just
[2:15:32] call for
[2:15:34] it amen we called for we called for the
[2:15:37] moon to stay in this place and the Sun
[2:15:40] that was pretty reckless Faith he dared
[2:15:43] to believe God's word God you've
[2:15:45] ordained us to take this land and we're
[2:15:47] we're in this battle and we need more
[2:15:54] light oh God as long as we're here let
[2:15:57] the light
[2:15:59] shine brother bradam said and while we
[2:16:02] now we're determined to do all we can
[2:16:04] while the evening lights are shining
[2:16:06] Grant it Lord this is as he preaches the
[2:16:08] church Jesus May during this meeting
[2:16:11] cause men and women to take a new hold
[2:16:14] newly may you may may you raise up
[2:16:18] speakers with tongues interpreters of
[2:16:20] tongues may you raise up gifts of
[2:16:23] Prophecy raise up preachers and pastors
[2:16:26] evangelists and so forth that the church
[2:16:28] might be edified raise up missionaries
[2:16:30] to go in the field Yonder and bring
[2:16:32] forth this glorious Gospel wherever the
[2:16:35] word can shall go may it fall into good
[2:16:38] ground bring it forth a h hundredfold
[2:16:40] for we believe that we're at the End of
[2:16:42] the Age the consummation is
[2:16:46] near so now that we've crossed over it
[2:16:50] is the hour to roll
[2:16:52] away the
[2:16:56] reproach so Israel following the word
[2:16:59] carried by the Levites he crossed over
[2:17:03] Jordan into the
[2:17:05] land into the inheritance of the Lord
[2:17:08] and the first thing that
[2:17:11] happens is that at the that the reproach
[2:17:16] of Egypt has to be rolled away by coming
[2:17:20] into Covenant with God through
[2:17:23] circumcision the cutting off of the
[2:17:25] blesh notice the first thing into the
[2:17:28] new
[2:17:29] land is a
[2:17:32] rededication a new
[2:17:35] Consecration and enter into a
[2:17:38] covenant come on and at that time the
[2:17:41] Lord said to Joshua make these sharp
[2:17:43] knives and circumcise again the children
[2:17:46] of Israel the second time time so God
[2:17:49] had given this Covenant to Abram Abraham
[2:17:53] and his seed and cision was the sign of
[2:17:57] his Covenant I want you to stop for a
[2:18:00] moment as we talk about the Old
[2:18:02] Testament and then we'll go into the new
[2:18:05] because there is a circumcision of the
[2:18:08] New Covenant that is also must be or is
[2:18:13] required so in Genesis 7:11 and ye shall
[2:18:16] circumcise the Flesh of your forkin and
[2:18:19] it shall be a token or sign of the
[2:18:21] Covenant bet me and
[2:18:25] you it's 1711 babe it's my granddaughter
[2:18:29] up
[2:18:30] there in case you wonder who I was
[2:18:32] calling
[2:18:37] babe so ye shall circumcise the Flesh of
[2:18:41] your foreskin it shall be a token of the
[2:18:44] Covenant betst me and you and so this is
[2:18:48] my Covenant which you'll keep between me
[2:18:50] and you and your seed after you every
[2:18:52] male
[2:18:54] child among you shall be circumcised
[2:18:57] look here now the
[2:18:59] requirement then look at what would
[2:19:01] happen if they don't verse 14 and the
[2:19:04] uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of
[2:19:07] his foreskin is not circumcised that so
[2:19:11] shall be cut off from his people he hath
[2:19:13] broken my
[2:19:16] Covenant
[2:19:18] now this is pretty serious right it's an
[2:19:21] act that must be kept it must be
[2:19:23] followed here if they're not they are
[2:19:25] not in Covenant with God and they and
[2:19:28] they are cut
[2:19:30] off so this commandment clearly states
[2:19:33] that circumcision acts as an outward
[2:19:36] physical sign of the Covenant between
[2:19:38] God and his people it was required to be
[2:19:41] in the Covenant in the Old Testament and
[2:19:44] for the New Testament there is also
[2:19:47] circumcision
[2:19:52] required now when God made this
[2:19:54] Covenant it was during the time of the
[2:19:57] giving of this Covenant which
[2:19:58] circumcision would be the sign of that
[2:20:01] God there would change Abraham and
[2:20:04] Sarah's name he would literally put a
[2:20:06] letter of his own name within their name
[2:20:09] signifying that the only way the
[2:20:11] supernatural birth of the son could come
[2:20:13] is by God coming down and becoming one
[2:20:16] with Abraham Abraham you can't do it you
[2:20:19] see ishmail was the child of his flesh
[2:20:21] and of his strength but Isaac was the
[2:20:23] child of the supernatural power of God
[2:20:26] and the only way an old man like that
[2:20:28] could do it is God to come down in
[2:20:33] him now when we enter into the Covenant
[2:20:36] at the new births we are to be
[2:20:38] circumcised at heart and God comes to
[2:20:42] dwell empowering you with the
[2:20:44] supernatural to live an overcoming life
[2:20:47] and there our name is changed from that
[2:20:50] of her Sinner and we are positioned as a
[2:20:54] Son of
[2:20:56] God once your name your identity was
[2:21:00] sinner now your identity is
[2:21:04] son you're recognized as God's child and
[2:21:08] in Covenant with him so circumcision was
[2:21:12] required sign of the Old Testament but
[2:21:15] under the New Covenant there was a new
[2:21:17] circumcision that was M that made the
[2:21:20] required physical circumcision
[2:21:23] completely unnecessary and
[2:21:29] obsolete now Paul had to deal with the
[2:21:31] church that beli the physical
[2:21:32] circumcision was a sign of the Covenant
[2:21:34] with God so you know they had big fight
[2:21:36] in the in the New Testament Church
[2:21:39] requiring them for physical circumcision
[2:21:42] because they they had these judaizers
[2:21:46] who were still the Bible said in Acts
[2:21:49] chapter 15 who were still
[2:21:51] Pharisees that believed that couldn't
[2:21:54] rightly divide the word of Truth and
[2:21:57] here even Paul and even Peter was trying
[2:21:59] to tell them listen it's not
[2:22:00] circumcision of the flesh that is needed
[2:22:03] we got a new circumcision today and it's
[2:22:06] the circumcision of the
[2:22:13] heart
[2:22:16] now Paul would say in Romans
[2:22:20] 4:3 for what sayith the scripture
[2:22:22] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[2:22:24] to him for righteousness so Faith was
[2:22:27] credited to Abraham as righteousness and
[2:22:30] he had that Faith before he was
[2:22:32] circumcised so the physical act of
[2:22:35] circumcision did not make him righteous
[2:22:37] his faith did but as a sign of his faith
[2:22:42] that he was in Covenant with God he
[2:22:44] received the act of circumcision
[2:22:48] now so before circumcision Abraham
[2:22:51] believed God and was declared righteous
[2:22:53] but after believing Abraham must have
[2:22:56] this sign of circumcision or be cut
[2:23:01] off trying to say I'm trying to get you
[2:23:05] something the same is true of the new
[2:23:08] birth now notice every child born in the
[2:23:11] family had to be circumcised let me just
[2:23:15] say every child born in the
[2:23:18] Kingdom Come on must be
[2:23:23] circumcised
[2:23:25] sir he must be born of Faith by
[2:23:28] believing but then after believing he
[2:23:30] must receive from God the sign of
[2:23:31] circumcision which is the baptism of the
[2:23:35] Holy Ghost and any child without the
[2:23:39] circumcision the sign of the Holy Ghost
[2:23:42] is cut
[2:23:45] off yes
[2:23:47] none of them will go into Rapture cut
[2:23:52] off now brother Brandon was ask you know
[2:23:56] about that but you know we have faith
[2:23:58] there was a group of men come to him
[2:23:59] said but we have believed on the Lord
[2:24:01] and he said you know what more can a man
[2:24:04] do that than believe and he you know
[2:24:06] that Abraham was justified by faith and
[2:24:09] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[2:24:11] him for for righteous what so what can a
[2:24:14] more that a man can do but believe and
[2:24:18] he said he he made it clear you
[2:24:20] certainly must
[2:24:22] believe you must confess with your mouth
[2:24:24] that Christ has raised from the dead and
[2:24:26] through his death has cleansed you from
[2:24:28] sin but then God gave him the Seal of
[2:24:32] circumcision to confirm his faith and
[2:24:35] when a man believes on the Lord Jesus
[2:24:37] Christ God gives him the baptism of the
[2:24:39] Holy Ghost to seal that he has
[2:24:42] recognized his Rapture righteous faith
[2:24:44] and give him the Seal of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:47] and if you say you believed and you've
[2:24:49] never received the Holy Ghost yet then
[2:24:52] God hasn't recognized your
[2:24:55] faith but God gave Abraham a sign of
[2:24:57] recognition of his faith by circumcision
[2:25:00] and he gives you a sign of the
[2:25:02] recognition of your confessed faith in
[2:25:03] him when he gives you the baptism of the
[2:25:06] Holy Ghost to seal it as a finished work
[2:25:08] how long until the day of your
[2:25:10] Redemption not to the next Revival but
[2:25:12] until the day you're redeemed from this
[2:25:15] Earth so let's look here Romans 2 and
[2:25:18] verse
[2:25:21] 28 for he is not a Jew which is one
[2:25:27] outwardly now we got a lot of Jews today
[2:25:30] anti-semitic ISM all that stuff going on
[2:25:33] in the world today but those are not the
[2:25:36] real
[2:25:40] Jews neither is that circumcision which
[2:25:44] is outward of the flesh
[2:25:47] but he is a Jew somebody with
[2:25:51] me which is one
[2:25:53] inwardly and the circumcision is that of
[2:25:56] the heart in the spirit not in the
[2:25:58] letter whose praise is not of men but of
[2:26:03] God so now I we're talking about Israel
[2:26:08] they're Jews but you're the real
[2:26:11] Israel they Seed of Abraham but you are
[2:26:14] the Royal Seed of Abraham and the way it
[2:26:17] is is because you are Seed of Abraham
[2:26:22] inwardly not tracing by your natural
[2:26:25] birth but by a spiritual birth and
[2:26:28] everyone that is Born Again is
[2:26:31] circumcised amen what not of the
[2:26:35] physical but of the
[2:26:39] heart and of the
[2:26:41] spirit look at Colossians 2 and verse 10
[2:26:45] and you are complete in him Colossians
[2:26:48] 2:10 which is the head of all
[2:26:51] principality and Power in whom also you
[2:26:54] are
[2:26:56] circumcised amen
[2:26:59] hallelujah with a circumcision made
[2:27:02] without
[2:27:03] hands putting off the body of the sins
[2:27:06] of the flesh by the circumcision of
[2:27:10] Christ so you are circumcised with a
[2:27:14] circumcision made without man's
[2:27:18] hands what man's hands that circumcise
[2:27:21] you that's the natural but you are
[2:27:24] circumcised in putting off the body of
[2:27:27] the sins of the flesh by the
[2:27:29] circumcision of Christ you see it's a
[2:27:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost that cuts sin
[2:27:35] and the world off of
[2:27:39] you now I want to get something to you
[2:27:42] you may not realize this when we're
[2:27:45] preaching this but this is so different
[2:27:48] in this Covenant you know the in the in
[2:27:51] the Old Testament the woman could not be
[2:27:53] saved except by Union with the
[2:27:56] man could not be in the Covenant because
[2:27:59] it was
[2:28:00] circumcision and she had to be joined in
[2:28:02] her H to her husband in order to receive
[2:28:05] it so the female could not be
[2:28:06] circumcised so therefore the husband was
[2:28:09] the atonement for her because they're
[2:28:11] one but in this last
[2:28:14] days it's totally different God has
[2:28:17] poured out his Spirit and the women are
[2:28:20] circumcised in the heart just like the
[2:28:22] man that's Hallelujah so it's all
[2:28:26] inclusive whether your husband believes
[2:28:28] or is an unbeliever doesn't have
[2:28:30] anything to do with you amen you have
[2:28:33] your own experience with
[2:28:36] God and are circumcised by the
[2:28:40] spirit in the heart it's a circumcision
[2:28:44] not made with hands
[2:28:47] and every child born to Kingdom must
[2:28:50] have the putting off the body the sins
[2:28:53] of the flesh by the circumcision of
[2:28:55] Christ through the baptism of the Holy
[2:28:57] Ghost which is the Seal of the
[2:29:00] Covenant no one can dwell in the
[2:29:04] promised land of the Holy Ghost without
[2:29:06] being
[2:29:08] circumcised it is the Seal of God
[2:29:12] am now every child every child every man
[2:29:18] every woman in the
[2:29:20] Kingdom must have righteousness imputed
[2:29:24] to him by faith and then be
[2:29:27] circumcised by receiving the Holy Ghost
[2:29:30] so it is not enough to say well I
[2:29:32] believe well then has God accepted your
[2:29:34] faith because when he accepts your faith
[2:29:37] he seals you to the day of
[2:29:40] redemption are you with me amen it's
[2:29:43] it's important to understand you you
[2:29:45] know that th this is what God
[2:29:48] requires now look I I want you to
[2:29:51] understand here that that they were
[2:29:53] Crossing Jordan and to the rest of the
[2:29:55] Holy Ghost and and here the reproach of
[2:29:59] Egypt was being removed and the Bible
[2:30:02] says in Deuteronomy 4:20 he brought you
[2:30:05] forth out of the iron furnace even out
[2:30:07] of Egypt to be to him a people of
[2:30:10] inheritance as this day listen sin was
[2:30:13] going to burn you
[2:30:15] up but God brought you out of that and
[2:30:19] he called you out of Egypt and brought
[2:30:21] you out of the slavery of sin and he
[2:30:23] removes you from the iron furnace of the
[2:30:26] fires of Hell of death and destruction
[2:30:28] of sin into a land of
[2:30:31] freedom and you're not slaves
[2:30:34] anymore you're land
[2:30:36] owners and a slave is not a land owner
[2:30:39] come on somebody a slave has no rights a
[2:30:43] slave belongs to another amen you are
[2:30:45] free born
[2:30:47] Hallelujah you're not slaves anymore
[2:30:50] you're hearing the new life and the
[2:30:52] reproach the reproach of being slaves
[2:30:55] and burning in the fires of Egypt you
[2:30:59] burned in your sex sins you burned in
[2:31:01] your adulteries you burned in your
[2:31:03] iniquities you burned in your your
[2:31:05] habits but now you have been
[2:31:09] delivered and brought out of the fiery
[2:31:12] furnace into the land of an inheritance
[2:31:17] the inheritance of the
[2:31:20] Saints amen the circumcision of Abraham
[2:31:25] it resulted in a promised son remember
[2:31:28] that's what his inheritance was he
[2:31:31] didn't inherit the land he was told your
[2:31:34] seed will inherit this but you you're
[2:31:36] going to get inheritance and it'll be a
[2:31:39] child right so you see the circumcision
[2:31:43] of Abraham resulted in receiving a a
[2:31:46] promised
[2:31:47] child now The Inheritance in the Book of
[2:31:51] Joshua in the crossing of Jordan was to
[2:31:53] receive the promised land of the
[2:31:56] abrahamic Covenant and required that the
[2:31:58] people be circumcised in Covenant with
[2:32:00] god with their reproach of Egypt cut
[2:32:04] off buddy there was a mass circumcision
[2:32:07] that took place in other words there was
[2:32:10] a can can I bring it up to date there

[2:32:21] had their portion in Egypt they might
[2:32:23] have had their portion there that might
[2:32:25] have had their circumcision and that was
[2:32:26] their portion there but when they
[2:32:28] entered
[2:32:29] in these had not these had not got their
[2:32:32] birth under them they had not entered
[2:32:35] into Covenant under them they are over
[2:32:37] here in the new land and underneath this
[2:32:39] word they enter into a covenant with
[2:32:44] God hallelujah
[2:32:47] now who's going to possess the land
[2:32:49] circumcised
[2:32:52] Sons those who have cut all the world
[2:32:54] cut off his sin his unbelief cut off
[2:32:57] who's going to possess the land those
[2:32:59] who are no longer
[2:33:01] slaves those who are circumcised who the
[2:33:04] spirit the Holy Ghost has circumcised
[2:33:06] cut off and claimed them and filling
[2:33:09] them with
[2:33:12] deity as I said it wasn't angels that he
[2:33:15] said that I'll be in you and you and me
[2:33:18] it you he said I'll be in you and you
[2:33:22] and me amen you will lay hands on the
[2:33:25] sick and they shall recover not an angel
[2:33:27] oh God we need an angel to come down we
[2:33:29] need Sons to recognize their position in
[2:33:32] the land in the Holy Ghost and I'm a
[2:33:35] filled son I'm a I'm a called son I'm an
[2:33:38] ordained son I'm an aned son and he has
[2:33:41] anointed me to preach the gospel to cast
[2:33:44] out Devils he's anointed me to heal to
[2:33:47] Open the Eyes of the
[2:33:51] blind he promised he would do this that
[2:33:54] he would pour out his Spirit upon All
[2:33:56] Flesh until Sons and Daughters
[2:34:04] prophesy sister it's as important that
[2:34:07] the word of God is spoke out of your
[2:34:10] lips as much it is your
[2:34:13] husband or any other brother is it's
[2:34:16] important that you speak his
[2:34:19] word amen anointed until Sons see
[2:34:24] Visions listen listen under listen under
[2:34:28] this Covenant even men are bride of
[2:34:32] Christ under this Covenant even women
[2:34:35] are sons of
[2:34:37] God when we say sons of God we're all
[2:34:41] inclusive because in him there is
[2:34:44] neither male nor female and you are
[2:34:46] circumcised in him and my sons and my
[2:34:50] daughters they shall prophesy oh men
[2:34:53] will dream dreams and young men will see
[2:34:55] vision and all my
[2:34:58] handmaids all my daughters and my sons
[2:35:01] I'll pour out my
[2:35:03] spirit he promised he would do this pour
[2:35:07] out it's the word
[2:35:08] kenos not as if God was pouring
[2:35:11] something out of himself like you know
[2:35:13] you vomit something up you know
[2:35:15] something com that that's not you it's
[2:35:17] something come out of you wasn't you but
[2:35:20] literally God pouring himself into his
[2:35:23] people that's what it means when God
[2:35:25] pours out his spirit it's not not a
[2:35:27] third person it's not another person
[2:35:29] it's not a subservient person is not a a
[2:35:32] smaller person is not a minor person
[2:35:34] it's
[2:35:35] God hallelujah it's he himself being
[2:35:39] poured out into his
[2:35:41] people that's why in this land comes the
[2:35:44] bride coming to Christ
[2:35:47] started out with the groom coming this
[2:35:49] is now the bride
[2:35:51] coming we're going to have a meeting in
[2:35:53] the air yes but not before there's a
[2:35:55] bride
[2:35:58] coming and this bride has to be all the
[2:36:03] word God in morphe what is it is him
[2:36:05] changing his mask as with Abraham God
[2:36:08] coming to him doing what he couldn't do
[2:36:10] by the flesh bringing forth a son of the
[2:36:13] Supernatural and to bring the Rapture to
[2:36:15] bring Jes Jesus back the promised son it
[2:36:18] takes the pouring out of God's spirit
[2:36:20] again that's why circumcision is needed
[2:36:24] which is the pouring out of God's spirit
[2:36:26] it it cuts off the reproach of
[2:36:29] denomination of
[2:36:31] Egypt you see like like I said we are
[2:36:35] circumcised as we read circumcised with
[2:36:38] the circumcision made without hands
[2:36:42] putting off the body of the sins of the
[2:36:44] flesh by the circumcision of Christ
[2:36:46] look at Jeremiah 6:10 To Whom Shall I
[2:36:49] speak and give warning that they may
[2:36:52] hear behold their
[2:36:55] ear is
[2:36:57] uncircumcised and they cannot hear
[2:37:02] hearken behold the word of the Lord is
[2:37:04] unto them as a a reproach they have no
[2:37:08] Delight in
[2:37:09] it amen come on you can tell the
[2:37:13] uncircumcised they'll sit like a bum on
[2:37:16] the
[2:37:16] law they'll sit as Stone Face as they
[2:37:19] can they won't respond to the word they
[2:37:22] don't welcome it there come on Amen it
[2:37:25] shows you're
[2:37:28] uncircumcised come on if you're in
[2:37:31] Covenant with God Amen you ought to be
[2:37:33] able to least clap your hands raise your
[2:37:35] hand to God sing from the from the
[2:37:37] depths of your heart give praise unto
[2:37:40] God and not get mad when somebody ask
[2:37:43] you to do it in fact of the matter it
[2:37:46] ought to be shame that you have to be
[2:37:51] asked amen it ought to be coming out
[2:37:56] spontaneously amen even so come Lord
[2:37:59] Jesus Come into this service welcoming
[2:38:03] the word come on Amen going before it
[2:38:06] with Dancing with shouting welcoming the
[2:38:09] word amen we want it in this place we
[2:38:12] want it restored we want it
[2:38:14] here
[2:38:19] well brother Tim I I'm I'm just I'm just
[2:38:22] not a I'm I I'm just not responsive okay
[2:38:26] you're a
[2:38:28] stone but God's able out of
[2:38:31] stones to raise children
[2:38:36] Abraham
[2:38:38] amen well how you don't like that well
[2:38:42] okay let's see if we like this
[2:38:44] scripture
[2:38:47] remember here the word of the Lord's a
[2:38:48] reproach to these they have no Delight
[2:38:50] in it and their ear is
[2:38:53] uncircumcised they'll listen to tapes
[2:38:55] they'll listen to preaching of the word
[2:38:56] and their ears uncircumcised they don't
[2:38:58] listen they don't hear it or it's
[2:39:02] twisted by the time it gets there look
[2:39:04] at verse Acts 7:51 you stiff neck oh
[2:39:08] what if you had this for a
[2:39:10] preacher use stiff neck and
[2:39:12] uncircumcised and Harden ears you always
[2:39:16] do you do always resist the Holy Ghost
[2:39:19] as your fathers did so do
[2:39:22] you amen what's he do you're stiff
[2:39:26] necked and
[2:39:28] uncircumcised in
[2:39:30] heart and
[2:39:32] ear right you
[2:39:35] resist the Holy
[2:39:39] Ghost now this is what happens with the
[2:39:43] uncircumcised ear the Holy Ghost is
[2:39:46] resisted now God required Abraham and
[2:39:49] his seed to be circumcised as a sign for
[2:39:51] the believer he gives you the Holy Ghost
[2:39:54] is a sign the Holy Ghost circumcises the
[2:39:57] heart the ears of The Believer by
[2:40:00] cutting off the Surplus flesh all the
[2:40:03] things of the world the love of the
[2:40:04] world the pride of life the love of the
[2:40:08] Flesh and it puts you in love with Jesus
[2:40:11] with an Undying
[2:40:13] Love Now you know when you are
[2:40:17] uncircumcised in heart and
[2:40:20] ears you have difficulty having
[2:40:25] faith C faith comes
[2:40:28] by so if you got an uncircumcised ear
[2:40:33] then you are only hearing what
[2:40:35] circumstances says and not what the word
[2:40:43] says all right
[2:40:46] need some holy ghost on your
[2:40:50] ears faith comes by
[2:40:53] hearing and by hearing the word
[2:40:57] preached receiving the word brings
[2:41:00] understanding and
[2:41:02] obedience that's right the uncircumcised
[2:41:06] ear will hear the word of God and either
[2:41:08] flat out denied or
[2:41:13] doubted uncircumcised
[2:41:16] ears will hear the word of God but they
[2:41:19] hear it
[2:41:22] imperfectly usually because they're only
[2:41:24] hearing what they want to
[2:41:26] hear or they hear with such strong
[2:41:29] Prejudice that they reject the
[2:41:32] truth the uncircumcised ear will hear
[2:41:36] the Bible say are you ready for this
[2:41:39] that the Believers will speak with new
[2:41:41] tongues and will dismiss it as workings
[2:41:43] of the devil or something out of
[2:41:46] date or something God used to do but no
[2:41:50] longer does because it was actually for
[2:41:53] another
[2:41:56] day that's what the circumcised ear
[2:42:00] uncircumcised ear will
[2:42:02] hear the uncircumcised
[2:42:06] ear will hear days of Miracles as pass
[2:42:09] but what does the word
[2:42:13] say these signs shall follow them that
[2:42:16] believe to the end of the world in my
[2:42:18] name they shall cast out Devils they
[2:42:21] shall speak with new Tong they will lay
[2:42:23] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[2:42:25] that's Jesus last commission to his
[2:42:28] church his last
[2:42:31] commission the last thing that fell from
[2:42:35] his sacred lips as he departed this
[2:42:38] Dimension from for heaven stop here just
[2:42:42] a minute you know I just with brother
[2:42:45] Donnie and his
[2:42:47] family and there I was on my way to
[2:42:51] church just before she passed
[2:42:55] away sister Erica passed
[2:42:59] away and first I got a call from brother
[2:43:03] Donnie while I was still at the house
[2:43:05] and he said pray brother Tim pray right
[2:43:08] now she's in such bad pain and you know
[2:43:11] she just riding in bed and pray brother
[2:43:13] Tim pray so I pray
[2:43:16] he said I'm on my way to the hospital he
[2:43:18] got the hospital and I'm driving to
[2:43:20] church and he said brother Tim pray I'm
[2:43:22] going to put your on speaker phone pray
[2:43:25] and we
[2:43:27] prayed the pain subsided and let down
[2:43:31] and she became
[2:43:34] peaceful and one by one her family came
[2:43:37] in that
[2:43:38] day and she was able to give
[2:43:41] them some of her last
[2:43:44] words she as a mother she imparted some
[2:43:47] of the most precious things the last
[2:43:51] thing she would want to say to her
[2:43:53] children took them each one one at a
[2:43:56] time and even nieces and family members
[2:44:00] brought them in one by one and spoke
[2:44:02] with them had a wonderful
[2:44:05] day those those precious
[2:44:09] moments now let's go back 2,000 years
[2:44:13] ago Jesus is leaving the
[2:44:16] Earth his physical presence will no
[2:44:19] longer be
[2:44:21] there be the last time he's
[2:44:24] seen in fact of the matter he can't come
[2:44:27] back to the
[2:44:31] earth oh yeah he could come right now if
[2:44:34] he want no he
[2:44:36] can't he can walk down these aisles he
[2:44:42] can't his word says He
[2:44:46] can't and he can't cross over his
[2:44:50] word even for the Rapture he won't come
[2:44:53] to the Earth we will meet him in the
[2:44:55] air amen his feet his precious feet will
[2:44:59] not come to the Earth until till he
[2:45:01] comes down on the Mount of Olives and he
[2:45:03] Cleaves and two and the great armag
[2:45:05] getting battle is one that's
[2:45:08] right that's his word he can't come so
[2:45:12] here's his last moments to speak lip to
[2:45:16] ear with his with his beloved
[2:45:19] disciples and as he
[2:45:22] departs it's like a person dying you
[2:45:25] know they're leaving this world their
[2:45:27] last words last things are so important
[2:45:29] to leave with their loved ones but here
[2:45:31] Jesus was not
[2:45:33] dying but he was leaving the earth going
[2:45:35] to the
[2:45:36] heavens and so he said some things that
[2:45:39] that would be precious for was to leave
[2:45:42] is something precious to hold on to
[2:45:45] whatever you do hold on to this and he
[2:45:48] says these signs shall
[2:45:52] follow them that believe Amen in my name
[2:45:56] they shall cast out Devils they shall
[2:45:58] speak with new tongue they shall lay
[2:46:00] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[2:46:02] that's right last
[2:46:07] words last words go and preach into all
[2:46:10] the world last
[2:46:11] words how dare an uncir cze ears to hear
[2:46:17] that that was only for the 12
[2:46:20] apostles or to bring that forward how
[2:46:22] dare and uncircumcised here to believe
[2:46:24] that was only for the prophet the
[2:46:26] seventh angel messenger for his time for
[2:46:29] his era that we in a different day my
[2:46:32] Lord left us can I say it make it
[2:46:35] personal the my Lord left me his last
[2:46:38] words to cherish to believe and to
[2:46:41] practice that's and God by his spirit is
[2:46:45] trying to cut off all that unbelief and
[2:46:46] restore our hearing from Heaven that we
[2:46:49] are redeemed Sons restored Sons
[2:46:53] following his footsteps as sons of God
[2:46:56] Amen like the second Adam
[2:47:00] walking walking like the first Adam
[2:47:03] walked with God in Eden and say be thou
[2:47:06] plucked up be planted over here when a
[2:47:08] tree didn't look right the wind was
[2:47:11] blowing said Peace by be still and it
[2:47:13] happened and he controlled it animals
[2:47:15] and everything on Earth he was God of
[2:47:17] the earth he had control and power in
[2:47:19] him and when a you say well that was
[2:47:22] Adam so let me just say when a spirit's
[2:47:24] born Spirit-filled man in faith takes
[2:47:28] that word into his heart and places it
[2:47:31] on his
[2:47:33] lips I know you're out there right now
[2:47:36] I'm ready Brother D I'm ready I'm going
[2:47:38] to speak some squirrels I I they want
[2:47:40] you to speak to that problem in your
[2:47:42] life to that unbelief that's been
[2:47:45] holding on that Shadow of Doubt that's
[2:47:47] been hanging over that atmosphere of
[2:47:52] Darkness hallelujah amen amen I I I
[2:47:56] don't know I don't
[2:47:58] know I'll be honest with you I quit
[2:48:01] eating squirrels a long time
[2:48:04] ago if you want tree rats that's your
[2:48:11] business but I've had all I want have
[2:48:15] had all the want of armadilla pawsum
[2:48:21] raccoon I figure out I need to eat all
[2:48:25] that you need another squirrel that's
[2:48:28] fine but what you really need is
[2:48:31] salvation in your
[2:48:34] house salvation in the house of God
[2:48:37] people believing and speaking the
[2:48:41] word amen that and believing it there
[2:48:44] and and re act to the word that Souls
[2:48:46] run to the Altar and are
[2:48:48] saved come on we need an atmosphere of
[2:48:51] the Holy Ghost AM where he moves in such
[2:48:54] a way brother that that the word is
[2:48:57] comes and saturates us with his presence
[2:49:00] and life comes into the
[2:49:03] body amen we need the word to be in the
[2:49:06] body where the sick can't stay stay
[2:49:08] there that Darkness has to leave dark
[2:49:11] Spirits has to
[2:49:13] go amen
[2:49:17] ever Mountain brother Brandon said when
[2:49:20] a man Spirit fills Spirit born man in
[2:49:23] faith takes the word into his heart and
[2:49:25] place it upon his lips why that's the
[2:49:28] same as deity he speaking Every Mountain
[2:49:31] has to go Satan cannot stand before that
[2:49:39] man I wonder today if you can say the
[2:49:43] Bible speaks of
[2:49:45] uncircumcised lips so then lips can be
[2:49:49] circumcised what about cutting off the
[2:49:52] utterance of unbelief coming out of your
[2:49:56] lips that
[2:50:00] negativity that
[2:50:02] doubt listen you don't have to continue
[2:50:05] living under a shadow the rest of your
[2:50:07] life this is where the Shadows have to
[2:50:10] go come on church amen you know every
[2:50:14] Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand
[2:50:17] before that
[2:50:19] man because his lips are
[2:50:22] circumcised I
[2:50:25] admittedly it isn't the Millennium yet
[2:50:28] where everything is subject to
[2:50:31] us but even right
[2:50:33] now even right now Church the demons
[2:50:36] have to obey our Command and when we lay
[2:50:39] hands on the sick they shall recover we
[2:50:42] are a people with circumcised lips we
[2:50:45] will not speak doubt that's right we
[2:50:48] will not we will not speak um utterances
[2:50:52] of depression we will confess the word
[2:50:55] we will speak the word and let it flash
[2:50:57] like lightning and watch Satan
[2:51:02] fall when Adam fell he operated in the
[2:51:05] shadow of death and and darkness
[2:51:07] redeemed Sons don't operate under death
[2:51:10] and fear and and oppression redeem Sons
[2:51:14] operate under the covering of the blood
[2:51:17] of Jesus Christ with a token sign of the
[2:51:20] Holy Ghost that daring Covenant with God
[2:51:22] as his representative acting in his name
[2:51:25] with power and authority over demonic
[2:51:27] Realms but uncircumcised years only
[2:51:32] hear what they
[2:51:34] regard from their
[2:51:37] doubt as against the gifts and moving of
[2:51:40] the spirit why they have no heart for it
[2:51:44] that's right right their heart is
[2:51:47] weighed down with doubt and fear it
[2:51:49] won't happen because it's not happening
[2:51:52] because of lukewarmness and complacency
[2:51:55] of unbelief then they dismiss it as
[2:51:57] something that it's just simply not for
[2:51:59] us it's just out of season so they make
[2:52:03] excuses uncircumcised ears hear the word
[2:52:07] of God
[2:52:08] imperfectly it is not hearing the word
[2:52:10] of faith it does not hear what the
[2:52:13] spirit says when the word is heard by
[2:52:15] the ear of the uncircumcised they can't
[2:52:18] believe it they become stiff neck and
[2:52:21] resist the Holy Ghost and even latch out
[2:52:24] against those who like St insist that
[2:52:27] God is the same yesterday today and
[2:52:30] forever uncircumcised lips speak the
[2:52:34] word of God imperfectly or
[2:52:37] incorrectly it just says well you know
[2:52:40] it's is not the season for
[2:52:42] miracles the gifts are now laid on the
[2:52:44] Shelf yeah the devil did that healing is
[2:52:48] a minor and we have the word now that's
[2:52:50] a
[2:52:50] lie if you had the word you'd have
[2:52:53] healing you can't have the word and not
[2:52:55] have
[2:52:56] healing you can't have the word and not
[2:52:58] come on and there not be prophecies and
[2:53:01] tongues and gifts of the Spirit and
[2:53:03] shouting and dancing and rejoicing you
[2:53:05] can't have the word and I do
[2:53:10] thatall you show me you show me where
[2:53:13] the prophet of God condemned he
[2:53:15] condemned them for doing it you know W
[2:53:17] without having the spirit of God and
[2:53:19] there they were they they were
[2:53:22] impersonating and living the wrong kind
[2:53:24] of life sure he condemned that but
[2:53:26] friends what he was against was not the
[2:53:29] the moving of the spirit of God he was
[2:53:31] against people shouting and dancing
[2:53:34] under emotion and not having the spirit
[2:53:37] and rejecting the word we are not word
[2:53:41] rejectors we're word receivers
[2:53:45] we have been circumcised by the word
[2:53:49] cleansed healing is only a minor when
[2:53:52] it's compared to Salvation of the Soul
[2:53:56] otherwise it's the very heart of God to
[2:54:00] heal he took whippings and stripes for
[2:54:04] your
[2:54:05] healing can I say that again he took
[2:54:09] whippings and stripes for you healing
[2:54:12] why even in the Old Testament he
[2:54:14] revealed himself in the name Jehovah
[2:54:18] Rafa The God Who heals the healing God
[2:54:22] God Is A Healer by name and he's a
[2:54:24] Healer by
[2:54:25] Nature it is the very nature of God I've
[2:54:28] already said it said it again the very
[2:54:31] nature of God to
[2:54:33] heal he says in Exodus
[2:54:37] 15:26 I will not bring on you any of the
[2:54:40] diseases I brought on the Egyptians for
[2:54:42] I am the Lord who heals you I am Jehovah
[2:54:47] Rafa that was the Old Testament look at
[2:54:50] the new Matthew 816 they brought unto
[2:54:53] him many that were possessed with the
[2:54:56] Devils oh if we could bring them to
[2:54:57] Jesus today and he cast out the spirits
[2:55:01] with his word and he healed all that was
[2:55:03] sick that it might be fulfilled which
[2:55:05] was spoken by Isaias the prophet sayth
[2:55:08] himself took our infirmities and bear
[2:55:10] our
[2:55:12] sicknesses h Hallelujah the
[2:55:15] uncircumcised lip will say well it's a
[2:55:17] word now so we don't need speakers in
[2:55:20] tongues we don't need healing we don't
[2:55:21] need one emotion in the church that's
[2:55:23] not the
[2:55:25] word the word never says that the word
[2:55:27] says if he's a savior he's a Healer the
[2:55:30] word said he ascended on high and gave
[2:55:32] gifts unto the unto men no word does it
[2:55:35] say he took them away uncircumcised men
[2:55:38] will take them away but God never will
[2:55:40] the word says that any religion without
[2:55:42] emotion is dead and should be buried
[2:55:46] amen I want to pass out a bunch of Shel
[2:55:48] to a lot of preachers around the message
[2:55:50] today to bury your old dead
[2:55:55] religion amen because if it's a real
[2:55:57] religion it'll have emotion in it it'll
[2:55:59] be something to shout about no wonder
[2:56:02] people ain't shouting in the churches
[2:56:03] today they ain't nothing been preached
[2:56:05] in a long long time that would cause
[2:56:07] anybody to shout amen but let it come
[2:56:10] where the word is preached there'll be
[2:56:12] shouting there'll be rejoicing
[2:56:14] when the word is returned there'll be
[2:56:16] dancing when the word is returned
[2:56:18] there'll be healing when the word is
[2:56:21] returned the circumcised year will he to
[2:56:24] said yes Lord
[2:56:25] [Applause]
[2:56:30] amen but uncircumcised lips give
[2:56:34] uncircumcised
[2:56:35] sounds if the trumpet sounds from un
[2:56:39] from the circumcised lip then faith will
[2:56:41] come by hearing the word preached
[2:56:45] amen there would be faith for miracles
[2:56:47] there would be faith for
[2:56:49] healing but it must fall upon
[2:56:52] circumcised ears that understand it and
[2:56:54] accept it Jesus dealt with people who
[2:56:58] gave lip service to it but their heart
[2:57:02] was
[2:57:03] uncircumcised like Cain the truth
[2:57:06] remains a mystery to them and they can't
[2:57:10] and and then they just say well you just
[2:57:12] take it or leave it you can't just take
[2:57:14] it or leave it either will God will
[2:57:17] become Supernatural to you or you won't
[2:57:19] go into Rapture either one or the
[2:57:21] other amen they won't take the
[2:57:24] circumcision Mark of God and the ears
[2:57:26] and the heart and instead the word
[2:57:28] becomes filtered
[2:57:30] through
[2:57:33] unbelief and when the Holy Ghost
[2:57:35] circumcises the ear it changes the way
[2:57:40] you hear
[2:57:41] things you have an ear to what the
[2:57:45] spirit says and the spirit says what the
[2:57:50] word says the uncircumcised here will
[2:57:54] hear preaching of signs following and
[2:57:57] say well that was for day going by or
[2:58:00] our pastor our church don't believe it
[2:58:01] that way or they don't believe in
[2:58:02] Emotion we just accept the Holy Ghost by
[2:58:05] faith no you
[2:58:07] can't amen you must start there
[2:58:09] believing and accept by faith but then
[2:58:12] you must receive something
[2:58:15] for crying out loud the Holy Ghost is
[2:58:17] not Faith the Holy Ghost is a person you
[2:58:20] can believe all you want too you can
[2:58:22] believe the moon is made out of cheese
[2:58:24] if you want to believe that you can call
[2:58:26] that Faith that's not real faith faith
[2:58:28] is based on the
[2:58:32] word faith
[2:58:34] is well we just accept the Holy Ghost by
[2:58:37] faith well that's an intellectual
[2:58:38] conception when you accept it by faith
[2:58:41] something happens when the Holy Ghost
[2:58:44] ghost comes the person of the Holy Ghost
[2:58:46] comes in like a rushing Mighty Wind and
[2:58:49] joy Bells starts ringing in your Souls
[2:58:51] making this man circumcising the heart
[2:58:54] and cutting off the doubts and
[2:58:55] dissolving the fear and when your heart
[2:58:58] gets happy H your feet starts
[2:59:02] dancing amen and your feeble hands get
[2:59:04] strengthened and start getting raised up
[2:59:06] to praise the almighty God and there
[2:59:09] comes out lips come on what happened
[2:59:11] when they got the Holy Ghost they heard
[2:59:12] them in every language
[2:59:14] praising God giving glory to God
[2:59:18] magnifying God hallelujah I'd say that's
[2:59:21] what we ought to do this morning is make
[2:59:23] him great in our midst Magnify Him if
[2:59:26] we're filled with the Holy Ghost we'll
[2:59:28] lift up his name we'll say he's Mighty
[2:59:31] he is great he is wondrous he is there
[2:59:34] to heal he is there to deliver he is
[2:59:36] there to save he is there full of grace
[2:59:39] he is there full of Mercy he's there
[2:59:41] full of
[2:59:42] love that's my
[2:59:45] God let him circumcise every doubt and
[2:59:49] circumcise every fear from your heart
[2:59:51] and circumcise your ears and circumcise
