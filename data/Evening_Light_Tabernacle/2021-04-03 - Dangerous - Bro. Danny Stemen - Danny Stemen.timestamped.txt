[53:51] amen for the privilege to be here and
[53:55] wonderful ministry that you have here i
[53:57] know that you're very blessed
[53:59] we also want to thank uh you that have
[54:02] taken in the young people into your

[54:07] appreciate that and i know the lord

[54:10] how many is expecting a wonderful time
[54:12] in the lord
[54:13] not only that you're expecting to enjoy

[54:17] something from the lord
[54:19] we don't want to just come here to to
[54:21] watch
[54:22] we want to be a part of it and you don't
[54:25] have to be young to be part of it
[54:28] is that right and i i can't wait to hear
[54:30] brother ron preach
[54:31] tomorrow and and his son
[54:35] yeah amen
[54:38] amen we're all wearing these pens and
[54:40] for brother ron's sake
[54:42] you know we just believe amen that god
[54:45] has healed our brother
[54:47] and i don't know if any of you know
[54:49] we've come through kind of a strange
[54:50] year
[54:52] and uh and i carried i carried this book
[54:55] around in my bible all year long
[54:58] because what the enemy wanted to try to
[55:00] put on our church was fear
[55:03] fear something nameless or something
[55:06] that could come upon them fear of
[55:07] contact
[55:09] fear of even going to church
[55:12] shaking hands fear of
[55:16] seeing you uncovered
[55:21] uh fear and people became afraid
[55:26] to fellowship and to go to church
[55:30] not to go to walmart but to go to church
[55:32] he was afraid of those things
[55:35] and i thought how important it is for us
[55:38] to understand that the same god
[55:41] that told our prophet actually i just i
[55:43] read this to the church i want to read
[55:44] it to you before we start off he said an
[55:46] angel
[55:47] sent from the presence of the lord has
[55:49] given brother branham an infallible
[55:51] prescription
[55:52] that will heal any sufferer
[55:56] listen to the angel's word if you can
[55:58] get the people to believe
[56:01] shall stand before you say nothing
[56:06] nothing shall stand before you not even
[56:09] cancer
[56:11] he said truly the lord is good to those
[56:13] who would soon die
[56:15] to willingly guide them to complete
[56:17] deliverance
[56:19] if you have cancer or have a fear of it
[56:21] remember there's a god-given healing
[56:24] the fear of anything is often the reason
[56:27] we fall victim to it whether sickness or
[56:29] something else
[56:30] and the word of god tells us not to fear
[56:33] or set our minds
[56:34] on such things and he goes on to tell
[56:37] the statistic of
[56:38] of a doctor telling them that when they
[56:41] begin to fear
[56:42] that it contributed to the fact that so
[56:44] many people are stricken with it
[56:46] and they indirectly worried themselves
[56:48] to the place they injured their nervous
[56:50] system and hurt their bodies in other
[56:52] ways
[56:53] and he said surely if a medical doctor
[56:56] can reason that fear is an impelling
[56:58] force behind cancer
[57:00] then we as christians should realize all
[57:02] the more we should not
[57:03] fear but praise the lord
[57:07] for his goodness and mercy and let our
[57:09] minds
[57:10] rest and trust and love upon the good
[57:12] things of god and that's what i want to
[57:14] do this weekend don't you
[57:16] i believe that god is is going to do
[57:18] wonderful things this weekend for our
[57:20] young people i believe there's going to
[57:21] be people filled with the holy ghost
[57:23] amen i believe there's going to be
[57:24] people healed and delivered of bondages
[57:27] maybe
[57:27] that you've never been able to break
[57:29] free from but today is your time
[57:32] amen and i know this the prophet said
[57:34] that satan hates the book of genesis and
[57:36] he hates the book of revelation you know
[57:38] why
[57:38] because genesis sows his beginning and
[57:41] revelation shows his end i got good news
[57:43] for you
[57:44] we're in revelation
[57:46] [Music]
[57:49] hallelujah
[57:52] we're in revelation and it says in the
[57:56] first chapter of genesis the spirit of
[57:58] god moved and it said in the first
[58:00] chapter of revelations
[58:01] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[58:05] i want you to know the spirit of the
[58:07] lord is still moving
[58:09] he moves to confirm his word and i just
[58:12] want to read
[58:13] to you a couple of things the prophet
[58:14] said i know this is all familiar to you
[58:16] but it's just good to
[58:17] to start off a meeting this way when
[58:19] john said i was in the spirit he said
[58:22] i love that and that could be said this
[58:24] is the whole
[58:25] of the christian life is to be in the
[58:29] spirit
[58:30] amen if we're going to live as
[58:32] christians we have to be in his spirit
[58:35] john was not talking about being in his
[58:37] own spirit
[58:38] so this goes beyond your enthusiasm
[58:41] amen that would not have brought the
[58:43] visions it had to be
[58:45] the spirit of god it has to be the
[58:47] spirit of god with us too
[58:49] or our efforts are in vain paul said
[58:52] i'll pray in the spirit i'll sing in the
[58:54] spirit i'll live in the spirit
[58:56] if there's anything good that will come
[58:57] to me it has to be revealed
[58:59] by the spirit confirmed by the word and
[59:02] made manifest by the result
[59:04] it bears i believe amen that's what we
[59:08] will see
[59:09] amen he goes on to say let me use
[59:12] another illustration suppose you need
[59:14] healing how many need healing
[59:16] what does the word say he said we've
[59:18] read it countless times but did not get
[59:20] in the spirit when reading it did we ask
[59:22] god for his spirit to teach us the real
[59:25] truth of it if we
[59:26] did we would call the elders confess our
[59:29] sins
[59:30] be anointed and prayed for and that
[59:32] would be that
[59:34] it might not come immediately but in his
[59:37] spirit
[59:38] it is all over there is no other court
[59:42] of appeal there is no other court
[59:47] of appeal so he said oh how we need to
[59:50] get in the spirit and then things
[59:52] will be done don't go through the acts
[59:54] first get in the spirit and then go
[59:56] through the acts
[59:58] and watch what god will do
[1:00:01] can't wait to see what he does let's
[1:00:03] stand together
[1:00:04] if we will amen
[1:00:07] let's bow our heads our gracious
[1:00:09] heavenly father
[1:00:11] what a privilege it is o god to stand in
[1:00:14] front of your people that you've called
[1:00:15] for your name's sake
[1:00:17] we believe we're living at the end
[1:00:18] father we believe amen the times have
[1:00:21] come upon us and these are the chosen
[1:00:23] ones
[1:00:24] you've chosen to manifest what you're
[1:00:25] doing in this hour
[1:00:27] amen the church of god is a lighthouse a
[1:00:29] light post
[1:00:30] an outpost against sin and against
[1:00:32] unbelief lord and
[1:00:34] we ask lord that you would come in a
[1:00:36] mighty way
[1:00:37] and show yourself that we can say oh
[1:00:40] what hath god hath wrought
[1:00:42] lord i'm speaking for my own
[1:00:43] congregation for the young that have
[1:00:45] come that
[1:00:46] you would lord pour out your spirit upon
[1:00:48] them oh god
[1:00:50] lord as we enter into these meetings
[1:00:52] we'll shake off tiredness and we'll be
[1:00:54] alert in our mind lord and
[1:00:56] we recognize the enemy's tricks that
[1:00:58] he's tried to play upon us and we
[1:00:59] realize
[1:01:00] you didn't call us to be the tail you
[1:01:02] called us to be the head
[1:01:04] you called us to be overcomers oh god
[1:01:07] and i pray you'll help me oh lord give
[1:01:09] me strength in my body anoint my lips
[1:01:10] anoint the ears of the ear
[1:01:12] for we ask it in jesus name amen
[1:01:16] amen let's turn in our bibles to the
[1:01:18] book of numbers
[1:01:20] the 22nd chapter
[1:01:37] and i want to make a uh or rather title
[1:01:40] the service tonight and be kind of
[1:01:42] strange title
[1:01:43] but i want to title it dangerous
[1:01:48] dangerous the prophet said that
[1:01:53] the devil knows that if the people get
[1:01:55] the true revelation of the true church
[1:01:58] and what she is and what she
[1:02:01] stands for that she can do the greater
[1:02:04] works should be an invincible army
[1:02:08] that makes you dangerous
[1:02:12] and we talk about how dangerous the
[1:02:13] enemy is and what he can do to us and
[1:02:15] what he's done and all the works and the
[1:02:17] destruction he's had and all the things
[1:02:19] we've seen in our even our own families
[1:02:21] and
[1:02:21] and the church problems and everything
[1:02:23] danger and we live in perilous dangerous
[1:02:25] times but you're dangerous
[1:02:27] i want to speak to you young people that
[1:02:29] way what god has called you to be in
[1:02:31] this hour
[1:02:32] amen amen numbers 22
[1:02:36] verse 1 and the children of israel set
[1:02:38] forward and pitched in the plains of
[1:02:40] moab on this side jordan by
[1:02:42] jericho and balak the son of the poor
[1:02:46] saw all that israel had done
[1:02:48] to the amorites moab was sore afraid
[1:02:52] of the people because they were many
[1:02:56] and moab was distressed because of the
[1:02:59] children of israel
[1:03:01] and moab said unto the elders of midian
[1:03:03] now
[1:03:04] shall this company lick up all that
[1:03:06] around about us as the ox
[1:03:08] looketh up the grass of the field and
[1:03:11] balak the son of zappor was king of the
[1:03:13] moabites at that time he sent messengers
[1:03:16] therefore unto balaam the son of beor to
[1:03:18] be thor which is by the river
[1:03:20] of the land of the children of his
[1:03:22] people to call him saying behold
[1:03:24] there is a people come out from egypt
[1:03:27] behold
[1:03:28] they cover the face of the earth and
[1:03:30] they abide over against me
[1:03:33] come now therefore i pray they curse me
[1:03:36] this people i want you to notice
[1:03:37] something that
[1:03:38] he told balaam there's a people come out
[1:03:40] of egypt
[1:03:41] he don't know their true identity he
[1:03:44] just knows where they came from
[1:03:46] amen he says come i pray they curse me
[1:03:48] this people for they're too mighty for
[1:03:50] me
[1:03:51] they're dangerous pure adventure i shall
[1:03:55] prevail that we may smite them and that
[1:03:56] i may
[1:03:57] drive them out of the land for i what
[1:03:59] that he whom thou blessed is blessed and
[1:04:01] he whom thou cursed
[1:04:02] is cursed and the elders of moab and the
[1:04:05] elders of midian departed
[1:04:07] with the rewards of divination in their
[1:04:09] hand and they came unto balaam
[1:04:10] and spake unto him the words of balak
[1:04:12] and he said unto them
[1:04:15] lodge here this night and i will bring
[1:04:16] you word again as the lord
[1:04:18] shall speak unto me and the princes of
[1:04:20] moab
[1:04:21] abode with balaam and god came unto
[1:04:24] balaam and said what
[1:04:26] men are these with thee and balaam said
[1:04:29] unto god
[1:04:29] balak the son of the poor king of moab
[1:04:31] is sent unto me
[1:04:32] saying behold there is a people come up
[1:04:35] out of egypt which covert the face of
[1:04:36] the earth come now curse me them peer
[1:04:39] adventure i shall be able to overcome
[1:04:41] them and drive them out
[1:04:42] and god said unto balaam thou shall not
[1:04:45] go with them
[1:04:47] thou shall not curse the people
[1:04:50] for they are blessed you can be seated
[1:04:55] may god bless the reading of his word
[1:05:00] we realize that when we read some of
[1:05:02] these stories
[1:05:04] out of the old testament that people's
[1:05:06] attention can start to wonder because
[1:05:08] they look at these things as maybe just
[1:05:10] some history
[1:05:12] or or things like that but we know this
[1:05:14] is more than history the prophet of god
[1:05:15] said the bible's a history book
[1:05:17] it's also prophecy it's also prophecy
[1:05:20] it's also a love story it's what god
[1:05:22] has wrote to you amen and so the old
[1:05:25] testament being a
[1:05:27] shadow of the new and israel being a
[1:05:30] shadow or
[1:05:30] type natural israel being a type of the
[1:05:33] spiritual church
[1:05:34] we see the things that we read are still
[1:05:37] at work
[1:05:38] and it's also a way that we can know the
[1:05:41] enemy and and know his works a prophet
[1:05:43] of god told us that
[1:05:44] amen we ought to study the enemy because
[1:05:46] we know the enemy studies us
[1:05:48] and he studies our weaknesses in fact he
[1:05:51] he he looks to see how we uh will use
[1:05:55] what has been given to us
[1:05:57] brother branham said that satan studies
[1:05:59] our strategy with the word like
[1:06:01] we we have the preaching of the word
[1:06:03] going forth tonight and he's going to
[1:06:04] watch and see how
[1:06:06] you retain that word and then how you'll
[1:06:07] use it will you believe
[1:06:09] that it's actually talking about you or
[1:06:11] is this just another sermon
[1:06:13] that is being preached by another
[1:06:14] preacher and is it just
[1:06:16] something that's going forth we're
[1:06:17] filling up time we're we're kind of
[1:06:19] excited and
[1:06:20] we've enjoyed the the social part of it
[1:06:23] or is it something deeper than that that
[1:06:25] his word is still alive and
[1:06:27] and god is is imparting something to us
[1:06:30] tonight
[1:06:31] amen something that is eternal is
[1:06:33] already a part of his word
[1:06:35] amen that the enemy amen knows that if
[1:06:37] you get a hold of this
[1:06:39] he is really amen losing aim in
[1:06:42] possessions that he once called his own
[1:06:48] i just i just wanna i just wanna to show
[1:06:52] you
[1:06:52] just so you see where my my thought
[1:06:54] process is on this
[1:06:55] what satan knows
[1:06:59] brother man sent the message that thy
[1:07:00] word he says you're here lord and the
[1:07:02] devil knows his time has come
[1:07:09] amen now the devil knows that do you
[1:07:11] know that
[1:07:14] he knows his time is coming now i want
[1:07:16] you notice what he said
[1:07:17] to this woman entering into this fear
[1:07:21] of faith here
[1:07:24] so the woman is entering some she's in
[1:07:26] the building physically she's there
[1:07:28] she's listening but as the prophet is
[1:07:30] talking to her he said she's entering
[1:07:32] into a sphere
[1:07:33] of faith and he knows he's got to lose
[1:07:37] for when she enters into something that
[1:07:39] makes her beyond
[1:07:41] her condition but now she is dangerous
[1:07:44] to what satan
[1:07:45] has planned for her
[1:07:46] [Applause]
[1:07:52] amen and we're dealing with these
[1:07:55] spirits that have come into the church
[1:07:58] what i'm reading to you here in uh
[1:08:01] in numbers is something that is also
[1:08:04] spoke about in revelation
[1:08:06] the same spirits are at work you come
[1:08:09] all the way over into the gentile church
[1:08:11] and are doing things in that church
[1:08:15] for one purpose is to hinder the work of
[1:08:17] god and destroy and prove his word wrong
[1:08:20] and to put a habit in the church of
[1:08:22] balaamism and nicolaitanism and
[1:08:25] jezebelism not different spirits the
[1:08:28] same spirit
[1:08:29] just working from depth to death put it
[1:08:31] in the church until the people are
[1:08:33] so bound down by fundamentalism and
[1:08:36] formalism
[1:08:37] that the spirit of god cannot move and
[1:08:39] is a stranger to them
[1:08:41] until that when he begins to move they
[1:08:44] say it's not the way our church looks at
[1:08:46] it
[1:08:50] that's what satan is afraid of that
[1:08:53] people
[1:08:53] will start forgetting what kind of
[1:08:56] pedigrees they came out of
[1:08:57] and they'll start aiming losing
[1:08:59] themselves in a sphere of faith
[1:09:02] where all things are possible
[1:09:05] amen like cancer amen like any kind of
[1:09:09] disease
[1:09:10] any be setting sin that you will begin
[1:09:13] to rise up in the sphere of faith the
[1:09:14] devil told you
[1:09:15] the holy ghost is not for you but you
[1:09:17] will begin to rise up
[1:09:19] in a sphere of faith and i want to tell
[1:09:21] you there is
[1:09:22] nothing nothing
[1:09:25] can stop you from receiving it then
[1:09:32] hallelujah
[1:09:35] not one i'm talking from the youngest
[1:09:37] you know what it does
[1:09:39] to a devil of generations amen when a
[1:09:41] little child comes out
[1:09:43] and can defeat a devil that has been
[1:09:45] around
[1:09:46] since the beginning of time here's
[1:09:48] somebody here
[1:09:49] that the devil cannot stop
[1:09:53] you are that generation
[1:09:57] you are that kind of people you're the
[1:10:00] people david would want in his army
[1:10:03] you're the people moses would want
[1:10:04] following him you're the people that
[1:10:07] jesus would call
[1:10:13] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:10:17] [Applause]
[1:10:18] don't get too excited this is how
[1:10:19] mennonites preach
[1:10:27] why would we have a why would we have
[1:10:31] a scripture like this israel has been a
[1:10:35] long time
[1:10:37] been a long time in the wilderness but
[1:10:40] it's about to be over
[1:10:43] and satan wants them to be fearful at
[1:10:46] their time of crossing
[1:10:49] well i want to start out these meetings
[1:10:53] by reading another quote i've already
[1:10:54] read a couple so
[1:10:58] jesus knows the word
[1:11:02] by experience
[1:11:05] he knows it by revelation
[1:11:08] he knows he's the son of god that was to
[1:11:10] come into the world
[1:11:13] he knows his standing he knows he's born
[1:11:17] in this world for that purpose
[1:11:22] and that's the reason the word of god
[1:11:23] could work through him because he knew
[1:11:26] what he was
[1:11:28] he says have you caught it yet he knew
[1:11:30] what he was satan
[1:11:32] knew knew what he was and he knew he had
[1:11:35] no
[1:11:36] business with his wisdom on the word
[1:11:39] because the word is god now if jesus
[1:11:43] knew who he was
[1:11:45] that he was a predestinated creature of
[1:11:47] time
[1:11:48] jesus the body knew he was the
[1:11:51] predestinated word the person of god
[1:11:53] that was to stand in that day to be the
[1:11:55] sacrifice of sin
[1:11:57] and he knew his adversary
[1:12:00] and he knew who he was therefore those
[1:12:02] two great forces come together
[1:12:04] knowledge and faith jesus knew the bible
[1:12:07] as good
[1:12:08] as jesus did but it wouldn't work for
[1:12:10] satan when you i want to tell you the
[1:12:12] difference between satan's wisdom on the
[1:12:13] bible and your faith on the word
[1:12:16] satan knows the bible perhaps better
[1:12:18] than anybody in this room but there's
[1:12:20] one thing you can do that he cannot
[1:12:22] do and that is you can live the word and
[1:12:26] he cannot for
[1:12:27] it is not for him he may
[1:12:31] know the word he may be able to blog
[1:12:34] about it
[1:12:35] he may able to send you emails brother
[1:12:38] tim
[1:12:38] amen of deception sinners or whatever
[1:12:41] they're called
[1:12:41] he may be able to do all of those things
[1:12:43] but he can
[1:12:45] not live the words
[1:12:49] forest he can't live what you live
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:55] oh so if satan if jesus defeated satan
[1:12:58] upon faith knowing who he was
[1:13:01] he was a predestinated creature are you
[1:13:02] ready what about the predestinated bride
[1:13:05] of jesus christ now
[1:13:07] you believe the bride is predestinated
[1:13:09] that means
[1:13:10] amen that if i'm here i'm not here by
[1:13:14] chance
[1:13:14] god predestinated me to this hour that
[1:13:17] means the holy ghost is not by chance
[1:13:19] the altar call is not by chance healing
[1:13:22] is not by chance god
[1:13:23] predestinated for this hour you say how
[1:13:26] do i know it's for me because i'm here
[1:13:32] you are here to receive what god has
[1:13:35] predestinated for you in this
[1:13:37] hour the destiny the bride of christ now
[1:13:41] the church the word seed
[1:13:44] with everything god promised to put in
[1:13:46] the church is in it right now

[1:13:55] the holy spirit has been given the
[1:13:58] spirit the seed has been sowed
[1:14:00] the evening lights are shining the sign
[1:14:03] of sodom
[1:14:04] is here and malachi 4 it's a
[1:14:06] predestinated church
[1:14:08] oh devil
[1:14:12] church of the living god here and on
[1:14:14] tape too
[1:14:16] you didn't know that you was on tape
[1:14:17] you're here do you know where you stand
[1:14:20] do you know you're called of god
[1:14:24] that the holy ghost reigns in your
[1:14:25] hearts and every word of god is real to
[1:14:27] you oh brother
[1:14:29] how is satan going to stand against it
[1:14:32] how's he going to stop it from growing
[1:14:33] listen this is a good start to the
[1:14:35] meeting how's he going to stop it
[1:14:37] amen how is he going to keep signs from
[1:14:39] following
[1:14:40] you throw them in jail i don't care what
[1:14:42] you do they tried it they rotted in
[1:14:44] jails
[1:14:44] fed the lions sought asundered jerk to
[1:14:46] pieces you can't kill a church that's
[1:14:49] predestinated
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:14:51] those he for knew he has called those
[1:14:54] he's called
[1:14:55] he has justified and those he has
[1:14:57] justified he's already glorified
[1:15:03] and now in the last days with every seed
[1:15:05] sowed everything in order the world in
[1:15:07] its order
[1:15:08] have you ever seen such chaos
[1:15:12] the world is in order its order
[1:15:16] time is shaped up the church is in its
[1:15:19] order the seed the evening lights the
[1:15:21] signs like he said as it was on the days
[1:15:23] of sodom
[1:15:24] an angel of god the holy spirit coming
[1:15:26] down and moving and performing the signs
[1:15:28] he did then
[1:15:29] malachi 4 amen he promised he would sin
[1:15:32] in the last days what he promised and we
[1:15:34] see it all right here
[1:15:37] sure right here in the last days of
[1:15:39] predestinated church knowing
[1:15:41] where they're standing so with the seed
[1:15:43] the holy spirit is in the church
[1:15:45] satan be careful
[1:15:49] i want to ask you a question what does
[1:15:51] satan got to be careful of
[1:15:56] what does he have to be afraid of
[1:15:59] he's got to be afraid of the holy spirit
[1:16:02] in you
[1:16:03] that is lined up with the order of the
[1:16:05] hour
[1:16:07] because i don't know about you the
[1:16:08] greatest hope the church has is the pr
[1:16:10] is the coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:16:13] everything is in order can it be brother
[1:16:16] danny absolutely it's exactly what the
[1:16:18] scripture
[1:16:19] said it may not have come to pass the
[1:16:20] way you thought it would but it's coming
[1:16:22] to pass
[1:16:23] perhaps faster than you thought it would
[1:16:26] let's look at some of the things that
[1:16:28] are in order
[1:16:31] in this scripture that i've read to you
[1:16:33] we have a colliding of events a people
[1:16:35] and of time
[1:16:38] we're going to get to those people in a
[1:16:39] minute
[1:16:41] we have the prophecy of god to abraham
[1:16:46] and he told him in the fourth generation
[1:16:48] you're come hither again
[1:16:49] they will come hither again for the
[1:16:51] iniquity of the amorites is not yet full
[1:16:52] god was telling abraham that i cannot do
[1:16:54] some things
[1:16:56] that that perhaps you would want to
[1:16:58] hurry up and do now
[1:17:00] but we've got to wait till the iniquity
[1:17:02] is full the cup has to be full
[1:17:05] and god told abraham that his seed would
[1:17:07] possess the land after 400 years
[1:17:10] now god has said i'll give you the land
[1:17:12] you fall heir to it but the land already
[1:17:14] has inhabitants
[1:17:16] people with customs and habits that will
[1:17:19] not be allowed to stay there
[1:17:22] they can't be enjoyed by the church and
[1:17:24] they can't be
[1:17:25] tolerated by the church and they can't
[1:17:27] be compromised with by the church we
[1:17:28] can't have them
[1:17:30] they're actually disinherited because
[1:17:32] they will not follow god's ordinance
[1:17:37] because they had their own ordinance
[1:17:40] and the bible says god is not willing
[1:17:42] that any should perish but we should
[1:17:44] also
[1:17:44] see that there is a time that the
[1:17:46] longsuffering of god is over
[1:17:50] and you know i'm speaking more than
[1:17:51] about canaan and the amorites and
[1:17:53] abraham's seed i'm talking about america
[1:17:55] i'm talking about the bride of jesus
[1:17:56] christ i'm talking about the time we're
[1:17:58] living in
[1:18:00] god speaks to abraham at this time he
[1:18:02] speaks to him that this promise would
[1:18:04] begin to be fulfilled
[1:18:05] after four generations and it would be
[1:18:08] in that generation they would come to
[1:18:10] canaan
[1:18:11] now what would keep israel from
[1:18:15] taking the land before that
[1:18:18] was god would not thrust the people out
[1:18:20] of the land without cause
[1:18:24] and he gives to abraham the cause and
[1:18:26] that is the iniquity
[1:18:28] is not yet full
[1:18:31] prior to israel going into the land
[1:18:33] israel would have to believe that the
[1:18:35] land
[1:18:36] belonged to them that it's not their
[1:18:39] land and that church's land
[1:18:41] and that people's land and that tribe's
[1:18:43] aunt but it's my land and not yours
[1:18:45] and why would it be my land and not
[1:18:47] yours because god thrust you out
[1:18:52] would not have you because you would not
[1:18:55] have him
[1:18:58] so they would have to realize that they
[1:19:00] had
[1:19:01] just caused to take a land they had
[1:19:02] never seen
[1:19:04] they would have to believe they're not
[1:19:06] taking someone else's land but they're
[1:19:07] taking their land back
[1:19:09] they would have to be convinced this
[1:19:11] land is my land
[1:19:13] and to do this god himself would have to
[1:19:15] visit them
[1:19:16] and by his presence change their lives
[1:19:20] to fulfill the promise and his very word
[1:19:23] of his presence would change their
[1:19:26] spirit
[1:19:27] from slaves to overcomers
[1:19:32] you know when you have a church full of
[1:19:33] slaves you're constantly trying to tell
[1:19:35] them that they don't have to be that way
[1:19:38] but when you preach to a church of
[1:19:40] overcomers you don't have to keep
[1:19:41] telling them they're overcomers
[1:19:47] spirit in them knows that already
[1:19:53] amen they would very word that was given
[1:19:56] to them would be the restoration of the
[1:19:57] word that god had given abraham a
[1:19:59] restoration of the truth
[1:20:01] and putting a way of falsehoods
[1:20:04] now on the other side the land was full
[1:20:06] of iniquity and god
[1:20:08] had had enough but he would not
[1:20:13] and this is important he would not
[1:20:15] thrust out a people
[1:20:16] and fill up the land with the people
[1:20:18] like them
[1:20:24] say it again he's not going to thrust
[1:20:26] out of people and fill up the land with
[1:20:28] people
[1:20:29] like the ones he thrust out
[1:20:33] then if he did god is not god
[1:20:37] he's not just amen but
[1:20:40] the reason he's thrusting the people out
[1:20:42] is because it's fulfilling his word
[1:20:45] that the cup of iniquity is full because
[1:20:47] god
[1:20:49] even sets boundaries on evil
[1:20:56] evil can go so far and then god says
[1:20:59] i've had enough
[1:21:02] yes amen you can vote me out you can get
[1:21:06] rid of me out of the churches you can
[1:21:08] take me out of the pulpit
[1:21:09] amen but you haven't got rid of me
[1:21:15] and so when he sets boundaries on evil
[1:21:18] he calls it iniquity
[1:21:20] at that time he said it's not full but
[1:21:22] when it was full then you'll possess the
[1:21:24] land
[1:21:26] that word for in the hebrew means shalem
[1:21:29] and it means complete when iniquity is
[1:21:31] complete but it
[1:21:32] has an emphasis it says when iniquity
[1:21:35] is completely friendly
[1:21:41] now what would that mean that is
[1:21:42] especially friendly that
[1:21:44] you know you know does that mean
[1:21:47] iniquity gets better and better and i
[1:21:49] like it more and more what does that
[1:21:50] mean
[1:21:50] iniquity is especially friendly
[1:21:54] so i want you to pay close attention to
[1:21:56] that word there we'll get back to
[1:21:57] numbers 22 but just understand where
[1:21:59] what the children of israel are coming
[1:22:01] into
[1:22:03] so with this word meaning complete their
[1:22:05] iniquity would be complete but it is
[1:22:07] emphasizing this word friendly
[1:22:09] iniquity is friendly now think of this
[1:22:12] word
[1:22:12] friendly in other words
[1:22:16] they are no longer strangers with evil
[1:22:20] but now they have become accepting and
[1:22:22] friends of it
[1:22:24] and they change themselves to become it
[1:22:28] so when god lays down his principles to
[1:22:30] israel on their own conduct in the land
[1:22:32] he shows them how far the amorites
[1:22:36] have gone and when he uses this word the
[1:22:40] people
[1:22:40] the fullness of iniquity he says they're
[1:22:43] friendly with it they are
[1:22:44] accustomed to it and god had warned the
[1:22:47] jews
[1:22:48] not to follow the ordinances of the
[1:22:50] canaanites
[1:22:51] who lived in the land for the cup would
[1:22:53] become full
[1:22:55] when it becomes ordinances
[1:22:59] when iniquity becomes ordinance
[1:23:03] leviticus 18 3 said after the doings of
[1:23:06] the land of egypt wherein you dwell
[1:23:08] you shall not do and after the doings of
[1:23:09] the land of canaan where i bring you
[1:23:11] you shall not do neither shall you walk
[1:23:14] in their
[1:23:15] ordinance the key word is iniquity
[1:23:18] has become protected by law
[1:23:21] and when it becomes protected by law and
[1:23:23] becomes the custom of the nation
[1:23:25] it becomes the custom of the people and
[1:23:28] they start trying to cancel out
[1:23:31] the ordinances of god in order to lift
[1:23:33] up their
[1:23:34] ordinances i want you to know the cup is
[1:23:37] full and it is time to change the sea
[1:23:43] when they start trying to cancel our
[1:23:45] history
[1:23:46] i want you to know it's not confederate
[1:23:48] statues they're wanting to pull down
[1:23:51] they want to pull down every statue of
[1:23:53] the living god
[1:23:54] they want to pull down church they want
[1:23:57] to pull down christian
[1:23:58] they want to pull down the holy ghost
[1:24:00] but i want you know we
[1:24:02] will not be pulled down we will be taken
[1:24:05] up
[1:24:06] god will not allow his word to be pulled
[1:24:10] down
[1:24:10] and become powerless but god said i have
[1:24:14] a people
[1:24:15] that i have restored back to my
[1:24:17] orphanage
[1:24:18] by malachi 4.
[1:24:24] malachi 4 is not a debatable doctrine
[1:24:28] it is a revelation of the move of the
[1:24:30] holy spirit
[1:24:32] and i'm looking at a root full of people
[1:24:34] whose hearts have been turned
[1:24:56] hallelujah
[1:25:01] ordinances
[1:25:04] means it's an enactment it's a
[1:25:07] translated custom it's a manner it's a
[1:25:09] statue
[1:25:11] when things like the days of sodom and
[1:25:13] gomorrah
[1:25:14] begin to be protected in a livelihood
[1:25:16] begin to be protected
[1:25:18] a perversion begins to be protected
[1:25:21] and becoming an ordinance and this what
[1:25:23] i'm doing today becomes a hate crime
[1:25:27] amy god says the cup of america is full
[1:25:32] [Music]
[1:25:36] you want to protect spirits that hold my
[1:25:38] people bound
[1:25:40] you want to protect perversion that
[1:25:42] makes them lose your identity
[1:25:44] this isn't a gender problem it's a god
[1:25:47] problem
[1:25:51] people have forgot what they were doing
[1:25:55] churches have forgot what the pulpit is
[1:25:57] for
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:02] we have a church full of victimizations
[1:26:05] church full of victims if you think of
[1:26:08] yourself as a victim you're never
[1:26:10] changed
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:13] oh brother danny we need reparations we
[1:26:15] need this we need that i want to tell
[1:26:17] you
[1:26:17] amen you need restoration you don't need

[1:26:26] we'll give you this we'll give you that
[1:26:28] just accept what we are let me tell you
[1:26:30] the church of the living god
[1:26:31] don't need me to be propped up by evil
[1:26:34] amen she knows who she is and she knows
[1:26:37] the gods he serves
[1:26:38] amen says i've never seen the righteous
[1:26:40] forsaken
[1:26:47] brother daddy but i'm scared in there
[1:26:49] shut our churches down there shut them
[1:26:50] down anyhow
[1:26:52] but they'll never shut down the voice
[1:26:57] and the voice is not a tape the voice is
[1:26:59] a living holy ghost
[1:27:01] living in his people i don't need to
[1:27:04] push a tape to take preeminence over a
[1:27:07] spirit
[1:27:07] amen but the god in me will rise up
[1:27:10] somebody help me preach this evening
[1:27:15] i have not started this race amen to
[1:27:18] quit it
[1:27:19] i have started this race to finish
[1:27:25] my god has not brought me this far to
[1:27:28] give up now
[1:27:29] and my god has not said go out and start
[1:27:32] another website against the prophet
[1:27:34] he never taught me to do that he called
[1:27:36] me to be a confirmation
[1:27:38] of malachi
[1:27:45] i think 4. just going to do a tag team
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:50] is already is it all right get wore out
[1:27:52] after 10 minutes
[1:27:54] all right
[1:27:58] let's look at these characters for just
[1:27:59] a minute you love the lord
[1:28:04] israel's coming at a pivotal time she's
[1:28:07] not just arrived
[1:28:11] at a random moment it is when god has
[1:28:14] predestinated
[1:28:16] a fullness of iniquity
[1:28:20] and in numbers 22 we're given an inside
[1:28:23] look
[1:28:24] at a high-level meeting between powers
[1:28:26] and principalities rulers
[1:28:29] of nations
[1:28:33] now the bible says balak was afraid
[1:28:37] do you know balak's name means
[1:28:38] devastator
[1:28:41] here the devastator is afraid
[1:28:44] who's he afraid of he's not just afraid
[1:28:46] of israel
[1:28:49] he's afraid of what they represent and i
[1:28:50] want to tell you who israel is because
[1:28:51] we're going to talk about that for a
[1:28:52] while is
[1:28:53] it's not just israel this is the new
[1:28:55] generation
[1:29:01] this is the new generation coming up and
[1:29:02] the bala the devastator is afraid so he
[1:29:05] calls on balaam who means not of the
[1:29:07] people
[1:29:08] he's not for the people is hebrew hebrew
[1:29:11] meaning he's a swallower of nations
[1:29:14] it's all about him so it's a
[1:29:17] collaborative effort it's a
[1:29:18] gathering together for one reason
[1:29:21] forces are gathered together for one
[1:29:23] reason israel is approaching
[1:29:27] amen you know there might not have been
[1:29:28] a whole lot of people know about this
[1:29:30] meeting but i guarantee
[1:29:31] there are some forces new about it
[1:29:38] and israel is approaching with a proven
[1:29:40] experience and a proven power
[1:29:44] israel is in her training she's being
[1:29:46] trained for takeover and for inheritance
[1:29:49] and the devil knows that in the holy
[1:29:51] ghost there's identification and if you
[1:29:53] realize that you're not a part of a
[1:29:55] movement
[1:29:57] but you're part of a predestinated plan
[1:30:02] he'll not be able to stop you if he can
[1:30:05] just get you to think you're part of a
[1:30:07] movement called the message
[1:30:11] amen is just another side note that
[1:30:13] could have been a denomination or
[1:30:14] another church and we can take our pick
[1:30:16] or what flavor
[1:30:17] even of a message church but if he can
[1:30:20] keep you thinking you're in a movement
[1:30:22] that you can be persuaded out of you
[1:30:24] have no power
[1:30:25] but when you realize i have come here by
[1:30:27] the predestinated plan of god
[1:30:30] i am a part of the predestinated
[1:30:32] movement just like jesus
[1:30:34] christ was a part amen it was a fullness
[1:30:36] of it
[1:30:37] i am here to be his body
[1:30:39] [Applause]
[1:30:46] amen if you realize that you're not part
[1:30:47] of a movement you're part of a plan of
[1:30:49] god
[1:30:52] the spirit of god is not something that
[1:30:55] you can school into a person
[1:31:00] we don't ask schools of the holy ghost
[1:31:01] brother danny i got the holy ghost i
[1:31:02] believe the message have you received
[1:31:04] the holy ghost since you believed
[1:31:05] the message
[1:31:10] amen it's something the prophet said
[1:31:12] that's predestinating to you by the hand
[1:31:14] of almighty god
[1:31:15] your experiences cannot be schooled or
[1:31:17] taught unto you
[1:31:19] it's predecimated by god's hand in god's
[1:31:23] foreknowledge
[1:31:25] now when when
[1:31:29] balak was afraid and he's calling for
[1:31:30] help
[1:31:33] because israel is approaching
[1:31:39] the fear of israel is starting to
[1:31:41] envelop the land
[1:31:44] rahab will say i know the lord has given
[1:31:48] you the land
[1:31:50] and your terror has fallen
[1:31:53] upon us and all the inhabitants
[1:31:57] faint because of you
[1:32:00] let me tell you this is extremely
[1:32:02] precious knowledge
[1:32:04] extremely precious intelligence of the
[1:32:06] enemy's thought process
[1:32:09] that they are extremely afraid
[1:32:13] of you i look up here and i'm like what
[1:32:16] do they have to be afraid of
[1:32:19] we're talking about another realm for
[1:32:22] she said we heard how the lord
[1:32:24] dried up the waters of the red sea for
[1:32:26] you that was one generation
[1:32:30] when you come out of egypt and what you
[1:32:32] did unto the two kings of the amorites
[1:32:34] that's the second generation
[1:32:37] that we're on the other side of jordan's
[1:32:38] sigh on an og whom you utterly
[1:32:41] destroyed and as soon as we heard these
[1:32:44] things our hearts didn't melt
[1:32:45] neither did there remain any more
[1:32:48] courage in any man because of you for
[1:32:50] the lord your god he is god in heaven
[1:32:52] above and in the earth beneath
[1:32:54] this is an inside look young people are
[1:32:57] some of you sitting here gripped with
[1:32:59] things that you've never been able to
[1:33:00] break this is an inside look at
[1:33:01] the thought process of what's holding
[1:33:06] you
[1:33:09] you can't break free from lust
[1:33:12] because you're a victim of your fathers
[1:33:18] you can't change because you can't help
[1:33:20] it
[1:33:22] that spirit is extremely afraid that
[1:33:26] even on the first
[1:33:26] night you realize that his hold has been
[1:33:34] not as strong as you thought it was
[1:33:41] so what god wants to do
[1:33:44] is change you see that's what prayer
[1:33:46] lines that's what laying hands-on is all
[1:33:48] about
[1:33:49] is you start to move into a sphere of
[1:33:51] faith
[1:33:52] that the devil has lost every time
[1:33:56] in that sphere you know i told our
[1:33:59] church at the beginning of 2020. how
[1:34:01] many has ever heard of 2020.
[1:34:02] i told our church at 2020. i did not
[1:34:04] believe that amen if
[1:34:06] if if we're the bride of jesus christ we
[1:34:08] could not get coveted
[1:34:09] all right i never said that i said i
[1:34:12] can't tell you you won't get sick but i
[1:34:14] want to tell you one thing about this
[1:34:15] disease
[1:34:16] you do not have to be afraid
[1:34:19] because my god has never been defeated
[1:34:23] he has never been defeated somebody hear
[1:34:25] me
[1:34:26] he has never been defeated he's the
[1:34:28] champion a champion
[1:34:30] amen he's the lord of lords he's the
[1:34:33] king
[1:34:34] of kings he has never
[1:34:38] never been defeated
[1:34:48] hallelujah no wonder he's afraid
[1:34:50] [Applause]
[1:34:56] israel is a pivotal moment we're at a
[1:34:58] pivotal moment
[1:35:02] i love this i just go through it and
[1:35:03] read about i love it because i know
[1:35:06] what it can do for you young people
[1:35:09] they have watched they've been in the
[1:35:11] wilderness almost
[1:35:12] 30 40 40 years i believe the book of
[1:35:16] exodus covers about the space of one
[1:35:17] year the book of leviticus about a month
[1:35:19] from what i understand but the book of
[1:35:21] numbers covers about 38 and a half years
[1:35:24] wanderings book of numbers is an
[1:35:28] incredible book
[1:35:30] what god does there
[1:35:34] it should have been a short journey
[1:35:38] but it's taken them this long to get to
[1:35:40] this point
[1:35:42] and the book of numbers is covering
[1:35:46] in chapter 1 the first census of israel
[1:35:49] in the wilderness of sinai
[1:35:53] an account the number of
[1:35:57] fighters from the age of 20 and up and
[1:36:00] how many they would have
[1:36:02] amen that god puts the tribes in their
[1:36:06] order
[1:36:07] he separates the levites for the service
[1:36:10] of the tabernacle puts them in order
[1:36:13] they observe their first passover since
[1:36:15] departing egypt
[1:36:17] why because god is a god of order
[1:36:21] he orders man to his place and no one
[1:36:24] can take that place
[1:36:27] and that's what god is doing here with
[1:36:28] israel he's changing them
[1:36:31] from slaves to promised land
[1:36:37] all people
[1:36:41] promised land people are very different
[1:36:44] from slave people slave people you got
[1:36:48] to persuade you got to push
[1:36:54] you've got to tell them how important
[1:36:55] they are
[1:36:59] amen promised land people have already
[1:37:03] been told something
[1:37:05] and by somebody bigger than me
[1:37:12] amen israel comes from egypt a slave
[1:37:14] people
[1:37:15] unsuited for the promised land unsuited
[1:37:17] for the promise of god
[1:37:18] but god is transforming them because
[1:37:20] that's what he does he's got
[1:37:22] transforming power and he transforms
[1:37:24] them to promised land people
[1:37:26] by the word he's given them and the
[1:37:28] order it is producing there's no word
[1:37:31] like the word of god they've heard the
[1:37:34] word from mount sinai
[1:37:36] and they've built the tabernacle for
[1:37:37] worship and the aaronic priesthood has
[1:37:39] been set up
[1:37:40] and they're witnesses of the
[1:37:41] supernatural and they're walking in the
[1:37:43] supernatural
[1:37:45] slaves live day to day
[1:37:48] at the mercy of their slave masters and
[1:37:51] come be prayed for on sunday
[1:37:53] and on monday you couldn't help it
[1:37:59] well i tried brother danny but what you
[1:38:00] told me didn't work
[1:38:03] how many's never heard that i mean i
[1:38:05] should ask you have you ever heard that
[1:38:07] anyway you know you try
[1:38:10] to try to and you just know
[1:38:14] i mean that they want you to do it
[1:38:17] slaves want somebody else to do it
[1:38:22] they want somebody else to carry them
[1:38:27] remember promised land they know they
[1:38:30] living with purpose
[1:38:32] they know they go through things for
[1:38:34] purpose
[1:38:36] brother on you go through for purpose
[1:38:42] brother and i'm in greatest battle ever
[1:38:44] fought he said i thought of god's great
[1:38:45] army up there the stars and the moon and
[1:38:47] everything and he said
[1:38:48] if there's a moving of them anywhere
[1:38:50] it's for a cause
[1:38:52] see we're god's great army we come here
[1:38:54] it's for a cause
[1:38:56] amen he said and it will affect the
[1:38:58] earth and we see the results of it now
[1:39:00] some of them move into other spot it's
[1:39:02] affecting everything and i thought if
[1:39:03] that great
[1:39:04] heavenly host like that has to keep its
[1:39:06] place to make everything in order what
[1:39:08] about the disorder of the earthly host
[1:39:11] when one gets out of order how it throws
[1:39:13] the whole thing out of cater
[1:39:16] we so easily dismiss the instruction of
[1:39:19] god and we do what we want because we
[1:39:20] think it suits us
[1:39:23] and don't realize our actions put things
[1:39:26] out of order
[1:39:28] the whole program of god is upset when
[1:39:31] one member gets out of order
[1:39:32] we should continually strive to keep the
[1:39:35] order of the spirit i would to god
[1:39:37] that we bring this to a real healing
[1:39:39] service and we will tonight by the help
[1:39:40] of the lord
[1:39:42] that the group under this roof will be
[1:39:44] gathered in such a harmony that the holy
[1:39:46] spirit would place
[1:39:48] every member of the body here in such
[1:39:50] harmony till there be a spontaneous
[1:39:53] healing
[1:39:55] of our body if we would just hold our
[1:39:57] position
[1:40:00] brother daddy how am i going to hold my
[1:40:01] position tonight stay alert amen stay in
[1:40:04] tune stay with the word
[1:40:05] your position is important to the person
[1:40:07] around you
[1:40:11] how often we hear the prophet don't move
[1:40:13] around
[1:40:18] so god has placed them in order for he's
[1:40:20] taken them over to the crossing
[1:40:21] united united

[1:40:28] their inheritance he's getting them
[1:40:29] ready

[1:40:36] and we're watching this high-level
[1:40:37] meeting it's a strategy

[1:40:41] advance that's dangerous to our way of
[1:40:43] life

[1:41:11] antidote with them

[1:41:16] time to pay attention

[1:43:01] tell you
[1:43:02] [Applause]
[1:43:07] you think the canceled culture that hit
[1:43:08] our nation this year and the riots and
[1:43:10] everything is new now
[1:43:11] they've been rioting against the prophet
[1:43:13] trying to cancel him out for a long
[1:43:15] long time but they came too late because
[1:43:18] he's already gone in his work amen
[1:43:20] amen has been completed and is being
[1:43:22] completed and amen the devil came too
[1:43:24] late
[1:43:25] to stop the seed that has already been
[1:43:27] sold
[1:43:31] what the what god has placed inside of
[1:43:34] me the devil cannot take it out
[1:43:42] he can try he can cry but he's come too
[1:43:46] late
[1:43:48] amen he told me it's your daddy's
[1:43:49] religion but he's wrong it's my religion
[1:43:52] [Applause]
[1:43:59] don't take this story is history because
[1:44:01] it's your story
[1:44:02] think about it we've come and we've
[1:44:05] spread
[1:44:06] out before the enemy
[1:44:10] and he begins to call hey he's not
[1:44:13] calling little alley rats out here
[1:44:18] he's calling the top guys why are you so
[1:44:21] important
[1:44:23] he is calling the top guys i mean you
[1:44:25] know how many names balaam has been
[1:44:27] called through his career
[1:44:31] he's been called a prophet
[1:44:34] became a sousair
[1:44:38] huh he became some of the mothers i
[1:44:39] can't remember
[1:44:41] but he was those two
[1:44:46] he is a man of influence
[1:44:50] and balak realizes if i can get him
[1:44:54] because you stop and think about it what
[1:44:56] is a curse going to do to god's people
[1:44:58] what curse can stop him
[1:45:01] why in the world is god going to spend
[1:45:02] all this time on this
[1:45:06] and he's not going to allow him to curse
[1:45:07] israel
[1:45:09] but why is it such a story why would a
[1:45:11] curse be of such importance
[1:45:14] because god can remove a curse any time
[1:45:18] he wants
[1:45:20] but he knows satan knows what mandates
[1:45:23] do to people
[1:45:30] now i'm only taking this off brother ron
[1:45:32] not because i want to take this pin off
[1:45:33] i'm hot
[1:45:35] thank you he knows what mandates do to
[1:45:38] people he knows people follow mandates
[1:45:40] blindly sometimes
[1:45:43] they know that the devil tells them
[1:45:44] don't go to church their stop
[1:45:48] mandates you know i used to think
[1:45:52] that church was a good place to get
[1:45:54] healed but apparently it's not anymore
[1:45:58] church is just a place of information
[1:46:02] you're sick and you know it
[1:46:06] amen but i used to think that church
[1:46:07] used to be a place of the living god
[1:46:11] where that people can move up into the
[1:46:12] spears of faith and be healed
[1:46:15] and that no disease not even cancer
[1:46:17] could stand before you
[1:46:19] amen that when your faith would begin to
[1:46:21] rise up and you begin to know
[1:46:23] that the god of the bible is also my god
[1:46:25] and i'm a part of that bible
[1:46:27] and it ain't no mandate gonna keep me
[1:46:29] back brother darren
[1:46:38] that's why the devil wants to mask us up
[1:46:40] and shut us up
[1:46:41] and separate us in social distances and
[1:46:43] he wants you to be more afraid of the
[1:46:45] one
[1:46:45] that can kill your body but i want you
[1:46:47] to know don't be afraid of that guy
[1:46:49] you'll be afraid of the one that can
[1:46:51] kill both body and soul
[1:46:54] that's the one we're serving amen and if
[1:46:57] he can kill my body and soul
[1:46:58] he can also resurrect it and we are
[1:47:01] living in the day of resurrection
[1:47:11] brother danny are you preaching against
[1:47:13] the way people handed coleman absolutely
[1:47:16] not
[1:47:16] but i am preaching against fear that
[1:47:18] keeps you bound and the mandates
[1:47:20] the devil wants to hold over your life
[1:47:26] i want to worship together look what
[1:47:29] power we got going right now
[1:47:31] that in just a moment even every cancer
[1:47:34] is gone every devil is defeated
[1:47:41] what a moment we are dangerous to the
[1:47:46] devil's plans
[1:47:48] the devil said this is my eating but god
[1:47:51] said
[1:47:51] i got a generation in there you'll not
[1:47:54] be able to change
[1:47:56] they won't look like you they won't talk
[1:47:58] like you
[1:47:59] and you'll not shut them up
[1:48:09] why are you talking like that brother
[1:48:11] danny because the prophet told me
[1:48:13] he said don't just train amen train to
[1:48:15] make a knockout punch
[1:48:20] so i'm not just going to try to react to

[1:48:56] a hill
[1:48:57] and the same be a death that took moses
[1:48:59] down
[1:49:00] the same be a death that took david down
[1:49:03] the same be a death that took abraham
[1:49:06] down

[1:49:14] him i want you to know amen my lord is
[1:49:18] not just a fighter

[1:50:10] and that generation

[1:50:25] defeated devil
[1:50:32] drugs can't stop you sex can't stop him
[1:50:36] amen no dead or alcohol can't stop you
[1:50:39] false doctrine can't stop
[1:50:41] [Applause]

[1:50:58] bunch of fundamentalists
[1:51:00] that was gathering a bunch of
[1:51:03] fundamentalists gathering together
[1:51:06] against the children of israel he said
[1:51:07] we saw that same spirit two thousand a
[1:51:09] thousand years later
[1:51:10] fundamentalists crucified the lord jesus
[1:51:12] christ and it's fundamental it's trying
[1:51:14] to do the same thing today
[1:51:21] well this is just excitement brother
[1:51:23] danny this is excitement we believe
[1:51:25] the word but what do you think the word
[1:51:28] does
[1:51:31] i thought the word was for no but any
[1:51:33] word is just for soul and spirit
[1:51:38] but it's also for the body now you shall
[1:51:41] serve the lord
[1:51:43] with all the heart and all your mind
[1:51:46] with all your strength where's drew
[1:51:48] just strength
[1:51:52] brother bram said when i started
[1:51:53] training as a boxer i said i got
[1:51:55] in professional fighting i used to have
[1:51:57] a child didn't you know brother danny
[1:51:58] brother branham never was a professional
[1:52:01] i don't care
[1:52:02] you know what i found out
[1:52:05] i listened to brother branham and i got
[1:52:07] a lot of answers
[1:52:11] i got a lot of results i listen to these
[1:52:14] fellas that say these things are wrong
[1:52:16] they ain't brought one thing
[1:52:19] they don't even need to bring a picnic
[1:52:21] basket to the meeting there ain't
[1:52:23] nothing they got
[1:52:24] they can't even bring you rotten apples
[1:52:27] why in the world would you let somebody
[1:52:30] who's been your friend
[1:52:31] leave the message and try to persuade
[1:52:33] you out and you get shook up because of
[1:52:35] socialism
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:38] all that means is the god they had amen
[1:52:41] was not the one they thought it was
[1:52:43] oh brother name they had the holy ghost
[1:52:45] oh they might have had a fall on them
[1:52:46] but it never could hold them because it
[1:52:48] never went to where they surrendered
[1:52:50] because they never surrendered their
[1:52:52] hearts i had a man tell me one time he
[1:52:54] said i serve god in this message
[1:52:56] with all my heart with all my strength i
[1:52:58] said no you didn't
[1:52:59] i said if you just served him with your
[1:53:01] heart he would have never gave it back
[1:53:05] bob don't give the heart back
[1:53:12] brother brother bannon said six seconds
[1:53:15] smith when he was
[1:53:16] training me he said he that man liked to
[1:53:19] kill me he'd knock me out of the ring
[1:53:22] in training i was skipping rope and
[1:53:24] running seven or eight miles a day
[1:53:26] and taking all the training i said six
[1:53:28] why do you have to do me that way see
[1:53:30] i said you knocked the breath out of me
[1:53:32] man i went plumb over four ropes and
[1:53:34] came out amongst the chairs and like to
[1:53:35] broke my back on him and he laughed at
[1:53:37] me
[1:53:38] said it'll do you good i said do me good
[1:53:42] how can it do me good you're about to
[1:53:44] kill me
[1:53:45] he said look billy i don't care how
[1:53:47] physically fit you are
[1:53:48] i don't care how many quotes you can
[1:53:50] quote i don't care how much knowledge it
[1:53:53] got remember when the punchings are
[1:53:55] going to come
[1:53:55] you're not going to be able to stand it
[1:53:57] right quick if you take a hard punch he
[1:53:59] said if your body's
[1:54:01] not used to coming back you'll lay there
[1:54:03] and take the count
[1:54:09] but if your body's used to taking it
[1:54:12] every time you get hit it shocks your
[1:54:14] blood and runs back to the heart
[1:54:16] he said but if your body's used to
[1:54:17] coming back when you get knocked down
[1:54:20] you'll get on your feet again it doesn't
[1:54:23] mean a thing when you get knocked down
[1:54:25] you'll get on your feet again amen you
[1:54:28] might have took a punch
[1:54:29] and you might have took another punch
[1:54:31] but you kept coming back
[1:54:33] you know why the king of kings has
[1:54:35] prayed there
[1:54:37] amen great in battle
[1:54:47] hallelujah we didn't start this fight to
[1:54:51] lose it
[1:54:55] we started it to win it
[1:55:05] you can take a punch and you took them
[1:55:07] for a year and you took some punches
[1:55:09] but you keep coming back i want you to
[1:55:11] know you're preaching on sunday

[1:55:16] thousands to realize
[1:55:26] david's just looking for another drink
[1:55:28] of water again
[1:55:41] pretty sure neville don't like this
[1:55:48] let me just talk about this new
[1:55:49] generation because this is this is a
[1:55:51] youth service he's young
[1:55:53] a lot of new cells in him
[1:55:57] i want you i want you to look at
[1:55:58] something
[1:56:00] baelic wants to use the power of curse
[1:56:03] to defeat israel israel has already come
[1:56:06] through some major shake-ups
[1:56:10] let me dwell on some of those to show
[1:56:12] you the obstacles of the new generation
[1:56:16] this new generation has seen many
[1:56:18] hindrances to their walk and their faith
[1:56:23] they've seen dissatisfaction stir in the
[1:56:27] camps of israel
[1:56:29] fire from the lord went out from among
[1:56:32] them and
[1:56:34] destroyed many in the uttermost parts of
[1:56:35] the camp
[1:56:37] until moses prayed and fires quenched
[1:56:42] moses may have been wrong but his
[1:56:44] prayers stopped the fire
[1:56:49] are you saying brother danny moses is
[1:56:50] wrong maybe in the eyes of a mixed
[1:56:52] multitude
[1:56:54] the mixed multitude among them fell for
[1:56:56] lusting for meat remembering the fine
[1:56:57] things of egypt
[1:56:59] god sent them quail
[1:57:02] and the plague that destroyed many
[1:57:06] in writing the prophet's own family
[1:57:09] aaron and miriam murmured
[1:57:13] think about the hindrances of the new
[1:57:15] generation
[1:57:17] murmured against moses
[1:57:20] it became a very public event because
[1:57:23] the glory of god came down
[1:57:24] from the tabernacle says don't you fear
[1:57:27] god
[1:57:29] fear god talk about him that way
[1:57:33] to murmur against him this is his own
[1:57:35] family
[1:57:37] changing the effect in his commission
[1:57:42] amen and miriam is struck with leprosy
[1:57:44] it was a very public thing for the whole
[1:57:46] camp had to wait for her for a week till
[1:57:47] she's whole
[1:57:50] we come to a major event that changes
[1:57:53] everything for israel that's kadish
[1:57:55] barnia
[1:57:56] where moses sends out 12 surprise spies
[1:57:58] here to give a
[1:57:59] detailed report of the land and to
[1:58:02] travel by the route moses gave them
[1:58:05] these men that went out to spy the land
[1:58:07] these weren't just anybody these were
[1:58:08] rulers
[1:58:10] of the tribes of israel who spied out
[1:58:11] the land they came back with an evil
[1:58:12] report
[1:58:13] men of influence experts
[1:58:17] experts of the message
[1:58:22] think about the hindrances of the new
[1:58:23] generation
[1:58:25] weak don't have a voice
[1:58:28] watching experts you used to lead them
[1:58:31] in singing
[1:58:32] used to preach to them they watched
[1:58:34] experts
[1:58:35] turn their back after years and years of
[1:58:37] preaching and saying the prophet is
[1:58:38] brother branham is a vindicated prophet
[1:58:40] and all these things were true turn
[1:58:41] their back
[1:58:42] turn their back on these young people
[1:58:44] turn their back on their congregation
[1:58:45] said
[1:58:46] uh you you've been in a cult
[1:58:49] turned their back and said well it's a
[1:58:51] good land

[1:59:15] moses i'm going to destroy
[1:59:16] every one of them
[1:59:19] and my love moses responds he turned to
[1:59:22] god he said god

[1:59:29] that you could bring them out but you
[1:59:30] can't take them in they had a good start
[1:59:33] oh man he was a prophet when he was in
[1:59:35] discernment but his message amen he got

[2:03:23] these children will know the land that
[2:03:26] have been despised by their
[2:03:28] fathers
[2:03:32] let me say it again these children will
[2:03:34] know the land
[2:03:36] that even though your fathers may have
[2:03:37] despised it
[2:03:39] you will know it you'll experience its
[2:03:44] fruitfulness
[2:03:45] you'll be a partaker one of what has
[2:03:47] been rejected
[2:03:54] there's a new generation that knows the
[2:03:55] power of god
[2:03:57] because the prophecy of god cannot fail
[2:04:00] the weak ones will know the power
[2:04:05] look what this new generation had to
[2:04:06] face jason and abraham and
[2:04:09] rose up shortly after said moses you're
[2:04:12] not the only holy one
[2:04:14] we also can tell you what the thunders
[2:04:16] are
[2:04:18] what the holy ghost is we've got new
[2:04:20] apostles in the land our names are
[2:04:22] abraham
[2:04:25] and korra and that other guy
[2:04:29] and they rebelled against moses claiming
[2:04:30] they too were holy man and they gathered
[2:04:32] with him
[2:04:33] against moses and aaron 250 famous men
[2:04:37] right now these movements weren't small
[2:04:39] movements they were gathering the
[2:04:40] renowned people
[2:04:41] in the message people of influence
[2:04:45] those little children looked at that
[2:04:48] said how in the world can i resist this
[2:04:51] god said i'll show you who's holy you
[2:04:54] come up here to church
[2:04:55] let me see the way you respond to the
[2:04:57] fire boy they stayed in their tent we're
[2:04:59] not going to come up he said all right
[2:05:00] i'll kill you right there
[2:05:04] and they died there and the 250 died
[2:05:07] there
[2:05:09] abrahams abrams and the other guy
[2:05:15] jason and abram because they were not
[2:05:17] satisfied with their position it was
[2:05:19] rubinites and they'd lost
[2:05:21] they had lost their place
[2:05:25] their first fruits they'd lost their
[2:05:28] place as the firstborn arubanites
[2:05:31] they're trying to take it back
[2:05:33] encore who's a levite but wanting to be
[2:05:35] the prophet
[2:05:37] he wasn't satisfied with jesus being
[2:05:38] part of the setting up of the tabernacle
[2:05:42] the bible says that he destroyed them
[2:05:44] and their families
[2:05:46] but another wonderful thing took place
[2:05:48] in the second census
[2:05:50] the bible recounted it again in the
[2:05:52] counting of them all
[2:05:54] and they counted the new generation and
[2:05:56] then they recounted the story of dathan
[2:05:58] and abraham and cora he said but
[2:06:00] nonwithstanding the children of korah
[2:06:02] died not
[2:06:04] that means there were some children that
[2:06:06] broke the generation of their fathers
[2:06:09] and if they believed their father's lie
[2:06:10] they repented of it
[2:06:12] or they stood against what their father
[2:06:13] believed and said we're not going to
[2:06:14] follow your movement
[2:06:16] daddy amen we're going to stand i'm
[2:06:18] going to go to church whether you quit
[2:06:19] or not
[2:06:23] amen i'm going to worship god whether
[2:06:25] you do or not
[2:06:27] if my father was a drunkard i'm not
[2:06:29] going to be one
[2:06:30] amen if there's alcoholism if there's
[2:06:32] drugs in my family
[2:06:33] amen the cycle stops now
[2:06:44] you know who came out of core a bunch of
[2:06:46] singers
[2:06:48] the sons of korra that died not a bunch
[2:06:51] of singers came out
[2:06:53] amen samuel the prophet what about
[2:06:56] it is important if you stand what if the
[2:07:00] whole
[2:07:01] amen the whole uh genealogy of cora had
[2:07:04] been destroyed
[2:07:11] what if they just listen to that voice
[2:07:12] says you don't preach anymore
[2:07:17] it'd lose a generation of preachers
[2:07:20] there's some sons at cora that said you
[2:07:22] know i'm not going to listen to just the
[2:07:23] push play dogma
[2:07:25] i have something to say too because the
[2:07:27] holy ghost is in me and it's unique
[2:07:28] through my vessel can tell you what my
[2:07:30] testimony is and what god has done for
[2:07:32] me
[2:07:33] god didn't mean me to be a mindless
[2:07:35] person who just goes like this
[2:07:37] amen he put me here to take the sword in
[2:07:39] my hand and be skillful with it
[2:07:41] amen and show the devil there's another
[2:07:44] generation
[2:07:45] amen that knows how to fight that knows
[2:07:47] how to speak
[2:07:48] that knows how to preach god didn't just
[2:07:52] call tim pruitt and stop
[2:07:54] he never just called amen ron spencer
[2:07:57] and stop
[2:07:58] he called his son amen he caught his son
[2:08:02] he called other young men stand up young
[2:08:04] man and then he calls others
[2:08:06] why because if it stops in that
[2:08:08] generation
[2:08:09] that god is not the king of kings but i
[2:08:13] want you know
[2:08:13] god said there's a revival for every
[2:08:16] generation
[2:08:21] it's for you it's for you young man
[2:08:25] who is gonna run somebody run
[2:08:38] that's why the devil shouted that's why
[2:08:41] he wants to cancel you
[2:08:43] because you're god's property and your
[2:08:46] dog's property alone
[2:08:53] [Music]
[2:08:56] hey man young man my daddy told me
[2:08:59] as a young boy he told me don't believe
[2:09:01] what your mother believes
[2:09:03] she's in a court don't you believe it
[2:09:06] it worked i believe it
[2:09:13] i'm part of that well there used to be
[2:09:16] new generation
[2:09:18] remember that one what happened
[2:09:24] i'm almost done amen
[2:09:29] i'll tell you why the prophet said when
[2:09:30] every time they haven't got yet to where
[2:09:32] he got there
[2:09:34] up on the mountain you know balaam is
[2:09:37] the first recorded road rage experience
[2:09:38] that we've seen
[2:09:40] as far as i know got angry at his at his
[2:09:44] donkey
[2:09:46] and beat him three times think about the
[2:09:48] man's car was more spiritual than him
[2:09:50] that's some of the problems we got
[2:09:51] around the message right now
[2:09:55] amen their cars are more spiritual now
[2:10:01] i'm trying we got these smart cars they
[2:10:02] tell us when to break they tell us to
[2:10:04] watch out for the cars beside us
[2:10:05] they jerk the steering wheel out of our
[2:10:07] hands they stomp on the brakes
[2:10:09] they tell you you know what my truck
[2:10:11] does if i swerve a little bit few many
[2:10:13] times
[2:10:14] a little sign flashes up with a little
[2:10:16] coffee cup and says take a break
[2:10:20] i mean my truck knows when i'm tired it
[2:10:22] knows when i need coffee
[2:10:26] i'm telling you there's some vehicles
[2:10:28] more spiritual than people around
[2:10:30] you know why that you know why that
[2:10:32] donkey was more spiritual than balaam he
[2:10:34] solved god
[2:10:35] [Applause]
[2:10:40] maybe we need to bring some cars in here
[2:10:43] they mean god three times
[2:10:46] air went balaam losing his mind beating
[2:10:49] an animal and then talking to him
[2:10:54] road rage
[2:10:57] because he was more about himself than
[2:10:59] he was about the move of god and god
[2:11:01] said you know what
[2:11:02] brother branham used this he said in and
[2:11:04] does god change his mind said this is a
[2:11:06] danger line
[2:11:07] he said where man hears the word of god
[2:11:12] but then he won't do it then god will
[2:11:15] say okay go ahead and do what you want
[2:11:19] i gave you a chance balaam you ain't
[2:11:22] gonna do it okay go do what you want
[2:11:24] and you'll still be anointed and think
[2:11:26] i'm with you
[2:11:29] and i'll even speak to you some of the
[2:11:31] most beautiful portions of scripture
[2:11:32] ever recorded
[2:11:34] but i want to tell you something balaam
[2:11:36] i'm not going to let you write them down
[2:11:39] you'll say them but my prophet will
[2:11:41] write it
[2:11:43] amen and you're going to prophesy and
[2:11:44] you're going to look at jacob and you're
[2:11:45] saying let my end be like theirs but
[2:11:47] your end's not going to be like there's
[2:11:49] that new generation is going to kill you
[2:11:50] in the last battle before they cross
[2:11:52] over
[2:11:52] [Music]
[2:11:55] they're going to kill you they're
[2:11:58] dangerous
[2:12:00] you're dangerous you understand how
[2:12:03] dangerous you are
[2:12:05] you're dangerous to every devil that has
[2:12:07] ever afflicted
[2:12:08] every family of all the ages you are
[2:12:11] dangerous
[2:12:12] because the cycle stops with this
[2:12:15] generation
[2:12:16] and the devil says i mean i don't know
[2:12:18] what to do
[2:12:31] balaam is taken by balak up to a place
[2:12:34] the fundamentalists they made their
[2:12:35] altars they made their
[2:12:36] sacrifices and then balaam walks out
[2:12:38] there says baelik well come on to do it

[2:12:42] going to say what god tells me to say

[2:13:18] make you

[2:13:38] them
[2:13:39] even they know how to present some of
[2:13:41] these thoughts and
[2:13:42] even some of the preachers can't refute
[2:13:44] it so you know they just you know
[2:13:45] there's a lot of
[2:13:46] a lot of questions that are unanswered
[2:13:48] in the message
[2:13:53] you know we're living right in in this
[2:13:56] time
[2:13:57] few thousand years ago there was a huge
[2:13:59] question unanswered
[2:14:01] in the message he had died
[2:14:05] the one we thought was going to lead us
[2:14:08] to die
[2:14:10] huge question and there's a lot of
[2:14:12] questions to message i'm going to lead
[2:14:13] you to another place
[2:14:15] well look at this look look they got me
[2:14:17] that church there's people failing
[2:14:18] adultery there
[2:14:21] and people in there they say they love
[2:14:22] god but some of them they're big
[2:14:24] big time thieves and look and over here
[2:14:28] some
[2:14:28] young people they can't quit their
[2:14:31] online habits
