prophesied of the last day and we're looking here at the promises of god and i see victory amen and i'm looking for complete and total deliverance those of you that have been sick and wrestling it out and just problems here and there i'm looking for total deliverance i'm not satisfied with this partial not when we can have full deliverance amen let's talk to the lord today maybe you want to take your request before him today as we pray father as we bow before you we want to express our thanksgiving what a mighty god we serve an awesome lord father who has given us such a mighty message such a mighty word in this last day that you would call us sons of god and daughters of god and ordain us to be here in this very hour we believe that we have been predestined for this moment in time we're asking lord that you'll minister to hearts and lives you'll speak to souls lord according to the needs you'll just bring deliverance in in your children's life lord as we said not just deliverance but total deliverance oh god we're looking for people to be totally surrendered we want to be totally surrendered totally committed our whole lives surrendered to you i pray lord that you'd anoint the word lord as we read it today and anoint us as your children anoint here is to hear and anoint the speaker to speak lord wherever the people are around the world i pray that you'll just minister to them in a mighty way lord for we ask it in jesus name we thank you for it lord in jesus name amen amen god bless you let's turn to romans chapter 8 and verse 17 for our scripture reading this morning and i hope you're ready for to have church today to enter into the presence of the lord and let him speak to you amen so may the holy spirit just reveal himself to you in a very very spectacular way today romans chapter 8 verse 17 and if children didn't heirs and heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation that word is display of the sons of god then turn with me to john [Music] i think his first john 1 and john 1 and 12. but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name amen how many believe on his name today amen he gives you power then to become sons of god god bless you can be seated as i was thinking this past week there's certain things that has kind of rolled over my heart as we ministered sunday on and hit different points and different things that um maybe we will emphasize again this morning we will see how the holy spirit leads there's some really really um wonderful things that lay in the scripture and in the message that god has seen in this last day i you know i was reflecting back um to what was available back in the early 1970s where there was little print in those days of brother branham's sermons and there was a man by the name of brother jack palmer whose name sometimes you'll hear on tape brother branham referred to him he compiled a book of quotes and actually i later would find out some of them were misquotes and called it the nugget book and one of the questions that was asking there what does the bride of christ look for and then you know the the conclusion was um as you can kind of stack your quotes any way that you want them to get the desired um answer that you want that um he the conclusion was that there was to be nothing happened but the coming of the lord that we're just to wait for his coming and and i found that he was he was right at least he was partially right anyway but what he didn't realize was that the coming of the lord was to be in bright form where where there must be manifested messiahs and this would take place before the meeting in the air as um they're the coming of the lord is in phases we could see that outlined in the scriptures that shout the voice and the trump and um so three different phases of his coming and um we we didn't understand or comprehend or wrap our minds around all that god was doing i'm not sure that we have totally wrapped our minds around all that god is doing in this age um the song says i want to know more about my lord i think that should be something we should be looking into the message daily and into the bible to see what is promised and prophesied for this hour um but nevertheless um you know there there were three different phases that would come and and there would be the word coming to a prophet and of course that is the coming of christ and then there would be the the bride coming of christ which would be the word made manifest in a body of believers and then finally and ultimately and what we still look along for is the groom coming to christ where we will meet the lord in the air but all of this is part of his coming it was very necessary for god to send a message of restoration to send his word in this generation to open it back up where that we could understand um what had been lost down to the ages and so it's very important for the word then to be revealed to prophet because that's not god's only way of revealing his word and it wouldn't be a new word but it would be a restoration or an uncovering or another look back into the scripture as um the um the dust and the dirt of that had been covered by fragments of man's ideas down to the ages had covered up the truths of god's word and and god would he would reveal his secrets to his servants the prophets and um there would be a restoration of that word and then of course some many of us who were in that era of time we thought because we had the word the message was come we was already ready for the coming of the lord and so therefore you know it was we were ready we were prepared because we had the message and we didn't realize that it had to take on flesh we didn't realize that not only would it take on flesh but there were many that would that would be there in the promise of that word that wouldn't even be materialized yet they were we had to wait for them to come because their names were in the book of life and and of course um you know then then we we um we looked there in that era of time as as we have reflected back um in the in the sermons that we preached on is there hope for revival and you know go away jesus and how that you know we we've let christ our let the faith and the word of promise just kind of grow dormant in our lives and the churches settle down just content to argue out the message as we sail along the way and you know debate this part or talk about this great event or that event of the past and and uh not not realize that we're we're we were coming to a time where that there had to be there has to be an awakening where we has to come to a realization that it's more than just talking about the message and and discussing its higher points or it's more than just talking about the great miracles of that would take place and and now that god would singularly use a man to be a messenger in this last day an elijah prophet a forerunner to forerun the second coming of christ we didn't even realize that not only is he was he the forerunner of that meeting in the air but he was also the forerunner of the bride coming of christ that he would that he would point to a word born bride even as john the baptist pointed to the groom when he came and so he was identifying that there would be a bride that would come in this last day and and she would be a people in whom the word would be on display in she would become manifested messiahs now of course you know those who only saw the word coming of christ to a prophet and they stopped there they missed a very important phase of the lord's coming and you know so the church kind of settled down and put everything on the hold as it was and we were just told to wait and just grow and mature and get adopted and what most don't realize is that the true baptism of the holy ghost we are adopted and placed in the body of christ if you have that true baptism you are adopted sons and as adopted sons you do not have to crouch down like scared children and hide when a goliath comes stomping around and makes his threats we know that even a little slingshot of faith that we we have played with as census children that some pass off is just a child's toy or or something very elementary or thought is something not very deep but yet that little slingshot of faith can make giants fall when it's loaded with a stone from the name of jesus amen and and of course it is something that is is maybe this thought is elementary but it's something of great necessity that we be a people of faith in this last day and brother branham would would even remark about this and as he said and what it takes to overcome all of unbelief our faith and he says um god said i've heard the cries of my people i remember my promise which i had with abraham and today when the church is sick and the sickness is piled up and the people because of intellectual pride and so forth is getting away from divine healing getting away from the holy spirit god still hears the cry of his people i'm so glad for that here today that god still hears the cry even after men forget even after you know we just kind of lollygag around or just may enter into a slothful dormant stage god doesn't forget his promise and he hears the cry of his people and he sees the need that is in the body and if there was ever a need it is a time that we should awaken our faith to claim every redemptive promise that god made in his word amen but as brother branham would remark himself he said we have not used his faith in so long and his spirit and his faith so long till it merely goes to sleep in our souls and that's why we've got to come back to a faith to a living faith that works amen that's that's where brother branham would point it out and feast of the trumpets and he says that we find the scripture in malachi 4 there's an anointing that comes down to restore again that original faith and i just want to say that that's exactly where we stand today there's an anointing that has come down it wasn't just a word but an anointing an anointed word a word with life in it a word with transforming power in it a word that will change you amen there has to be anointing come down and restore that original faith and that's what we see revelation 10 shows that that mighty angel christ an anointing coming down you say it wasn't an anointing it was an anointing it was not a physical return of christ it was an anointing coming down to anoint a word in this day and some messiahs who will take that word and press it down toward the end time now here we are in this time you know but you know even even now we stand and we're we've been in a in a really really serious time as we've entered into 2020. you know and it's it's a it's a it's a struggling time it's a difficult time for many that is in the world i think you could agree with that amen and and you know i i just shared this little little thing with someone with several people you know brother joe preached on impossible math and and then someone said but if 2020 was a math problem if you're going down a river at two miles an hour and your canoe loses a wheel how much pancake mix would you need to re-shingle your roof you see it's been one of those kinds of a year you know every kind of thought every kind of mix-up idea everything to try to to scatter men's faith and to keep their faith from the promises of the word of god and everything to try to to do but it's in those moments that we as sons of god can exercise our faith that we can put the faith that we have been taught to work amen and and many of us even in this building today we have met with the thing that was feared and we have risen above it amen that our faith has conquered it amen i think of brother kenny sister genie today that that are home and and they're recovering they're on the man i just want to tell them again your faith your faith has had an opportunity to go to work and you see it working i mean this this is exactly where we stand in this day it's a troublesome time but it's a day where faith has to be fine-tuned and we've got to know how to use faith in this hour even brother branham would tell us in his in his discernment that he would that god would gift him with and it would tell them who they were and where they come from and what their situation was and it made them know that god knows that there's a god present amen that god had to be there and that he could be touched with their feelings right amen but but he said you know many of them will stand before me and he says they think their faith is way up here but he said they hadn't got faith and they you know they're saying they got faith but it isn't up here it's like it's like tuning a string on an instrument when it comes up and coincides with this up here and then things are ready it's got to come up and coincide with the word and any demon that's got that person bound has got to turn loose when that kind of faith comes that was the whole purpose of god's sin and a prophet and our generation was to tune our faith amen to make it tighter to bring it to where it is saying every time you strum it jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever not a people whose faith is out of tune but a people whose faith matches the word whatever the word said they believe it and it demonstrates it amen now again this is what he would say i'm catching your spirit i'm trying to get your spirit where it's caught and and i can catch it and then tune that spirit he didn't use the word tune in there but he said i'll catch that spirit and he says there's something hindering them and laying in the way and one little shadow will vibrate it away and then he said it then he said there was a little lady standing on the platform a moment ago and he says here's a little inside something i was catching her spirit and he said and when you're projecting when he gather her spirit to hold steady and that would would project to her your very thought and you change her thinking and get her centered on christ you know you know again this is the whole problem with sickness and the and problem with diseases is because your your thoughts are centered on will i ever be well again the pain that i'm feeling the situation at hand what the doctor says even what miss google says you know it's it's all on on that and brother branham would take and by a gift center the person's mind on christ they might change her way of thinking said she can't change herself she's in a world she's in a canoe and there's a then she's from the wheel and and you know how much pancake mix will it take to fix the roof it's just scattered from here to there from here to there but if you can ever get them centered on christ amen not a christ of the past not a christ who walked the shores of galilee but a christ that is here that is present that's a healer that's a deliverer that there's nothing too hard for our lord amen that he can change situation remember that's what he had to do with sarah he came and called her name and told her of a promise and she was doubting and he had to pull her thoughts back to the the word and she he pointed back to himself and he said is there anything that it's too hard for the lord and that's the whole thing when we can get centered back on christ again amen that he is god that is the same today that is here present among us amen there's no sin that can stand in front of that there's no sickness there's no disease there's no problem you can stand in front of that when you get them centered on christ the devil has to go amen and that's why preaching on faith is so necessary and that's why i'm pounding service after service to change your thinking and get it centered on christ amen now brother branham talked about a woman that who you know went to see a young girl she actually was um in her mid-30s and was teaching college and she met a psychiatrist and she'd never smoked or drank or uh and all her life she's a fine girl her parents were christians and her father a doctor and she gave her life to the to christ at a a young stage but this man began to work on her and he began to be begin to work on her thinking now i want you to stop and think a minute because this is where we are today you know it's here there they've got you where you don't know what to believe amen i mean every every kind of opinion every kind of thought the president's got one his opposing party's got another and the cdc's got another and everybody's got their own thought and weekly it changes and they got people's mind in a world amen but do you see this and this is what the world wants to do to you get your mind in a world exactly right oh is it really wrong to cut your hair is it really wrong to paint your face is it really wrong or can't you have a couple of beers and still be a christian you see it's trying to put the minds of the people in a world and you're hearing it from every side every side every side a barrage of voices am i coming against you and this this this psychiatrist began to work on this girl and said you mean to tell me you never kissed a boy you know not one time in my life no you mean you've never had a little drink in a party never well girl you just don't know what you're missing you know and him being a psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind until she became so evil and bad until she don't even want to hear the name of jesus spoke in her presence think of that that's what america has come got the minds of the people the nation in such a world amen until she's become so evil i'm talking about america and don't smirk out there in the world today your country is just as bad and mandarin all of them are controlled by the devil we got a whole world whose mind is being given to the beast are you with me amen and she america the the the world has become so evil and bad till she don't even want to hear the name of jesus spoke in her presence and even her father and mother can't see her no more and she lost her mind and this week we'll go to institution for shock treatment it's because her thoughts were turned from christ unto what a psychiatrist was moving her mind and what are we here for this morning is to move your mind this is what brother branham would even say what he was doing i'm moving your mind even paul would say let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus amen and what we are here for is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world unto the things of god which is eternally and that's what preaching is for is to convert the thinking to a higher and better to a place where christ is until you become converted then your mind reaches for those things that are above so here we are we're living in a time where we've got to have our mindset on christ and now we've got television movies education media social media that have changed the thinking of our world as you've learned in the last few days our social media and twitter and facebook and google and all of them you know if they if they don't want if they don't want something heard that would would hurt their candidate they don't want that spoken they silence those voices they might say it's like nobody can make or is allowed to look at all of the facts or all the things and make up their own mind they want to make up your mind and when the bible said these have one mind and they give their power and their strength to the beast here we are it's a crazy world that we're living in the world has lost all sense of decency there's no let me just say to you if you're looking for normal times again it's never going to be normal again what you knew is normal will never come again the world is loss of sense of decency there's never there is no going back to what we knew is normal what you're seeing now is becoming the norm for the world and i'm telling you that's why we must leave it we must leave it amen listen the bible said as it was in the days of noah in genesis 6 and 5 and god saw the wickedness of man was great on the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually certainly that describes again our day amen the bible said in that time there were great men and men of renown great sciences that came up and we're living in a day where that that education has reached its height and and science has reached its glory and all these other things and men are now men are renowned you with me amen but you see what does it produce these men of renown what are they producing an age of wickedness an age where where the wickedness of man is great in the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart on evil continually you know you cannot read a news article whether it's conservative or whether it's the other it doesn't matter if it's a conservative news site or whether it's a liberal news site they've got expletives you know with with that where they don't leave nothing really to your imaginations fewer you know asterisks there to block out a few letters as if that makes any difference things that would have never been said but it swung the minds of men until they're on evil continually amen but i want you to remember in the days of noah there was not only noah representing the church who found grace and decided the lord and went through the flood of tribulation but and passed over into a new land of the uh of um to a new earth but i want you to know that in that same time while men were choosing women such as they desired there was a man who walked with god there was a man who was also a man of renown the world didn't call him a man of renown but he's a man of renown in fact in that matter the names of those men of renown are not even known today but this man's name is still known enoch who walked with god enoch met dedicated a man a consecrated man who was dedicated to a purpose to a walk with god who kept going hype who didn't stay where he was you cannot be an enoch and stay where you are you've got to advance you got to take another step higher enoch brother branham would use him and he said you're going to have to be an enoch you're going to have to have an enoch type of faith and he would even say you know i i i don't might not have the faith to walk like enoch dud and take an afternoon walk with god and and and not die and just go on up home he said i may not i may not have that but i don't want to stand in the way of someone who would amen he kept saying i don't want to trip up or stand in the way of someone who does have that kind of faith because she said it's the kind of faith we're going to have to have we will be who are alive and remain that they come the lord shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and caught up together with the resurrected dead to meet the lord in the air and forever be with him this would make brother branham cry out as he come to the end of his time and he's and he would he would say this and just once more lord lord years i wanted to see this happen maybe it will just once more lord one more great move of the spirit one more time lord and the church might receive rapture and faith to go in my certainly as we look at it as he and he would say in the message token i'm looking for a time of the break forth of the spirit of god in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the holy spirit into the church a rapture in faith for a rapture and faith just before it comes and everything is setting straight in order for that i believe we received the rapture and message i believe we have raptured revelation amen that the word has been revealed but at the same time you know they're they're still we still must have our faith too to move up another notch amen until that we are beating in step with the word that is prophesied for this hour oh my now brother branham would talk about this and why christ speak and and he would say you know i i i said i think anyone any boy a girl man or woman you know an intellectual that have an intellectual conception of what they think the word is they can never have a full foundation until they've met that light that brings the word to reality and i said that i think the church and his practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot strive until the supernatural is made known among that people and they see it something they can talk to that will talk back to them that vindicates this written word you know moses heard that amen he had heard that already the word was there it was written in the word that that abraham your your people will sojourn in a strange land and but after 400 years i will bring them out i can't bring them into it now because the iniquity of the amorite is not yet full you see they had to reach a certain level until god would be justified to drive him off that land is that right sin would have to reach a certain height and god has also had to let it wait until this last age where sin reaches a certain height until god is justified to call it an end and take a people in a rapture and send tribulation on the earth amen but moses you know he he he there was was called out by god because god had written in the word but it's not enough for god to write it in the word you know it's not enough just to write it in the word it's got to be quickened and then god's also wrote it in the word that after seven church ages i will call a bride out and i'll bring it to an end and i'll pour judgment out upon the earth now moses knew all of this intellectually the seed that was born in him was laying in his heart and he cried through his intellectual experience with the word to try to deliver the children of israel and he knew it was the time and he believed that he was the man he you know that the scriptures had said that they had already been there 400 years and it was now time he could look and he said but the bible the word what he told abraham is now come to pass we've been here 400 years amen we've been at that time and and we we have we have blocked time along until we're here and yeah i was born a strange child and and my mother and dad said there was a light that accompanied me my birth and and all of the things that took place and they knew i was a special child and i've been raised up and trained and i'll take this training and i'll deliver the children of israel but it didn't work it was only intellectual that's why we've got to take what we have received and heard intellectually and have it quickened to us amen we we know we have lived a time out also come on you know the the bible didn't say after 400 years for us but he didn't leave symbols in the scripture right amen he said he he left in revelation chapter one through three he left a whole diagram of the word that he would lay it out and he was able to show it you know from here it would go from here and to the messenger and these are angels and these are men and and these are ages and these are times and we know now we have run out of time we have run out of ages in fact the last messenger has come and gone is that right amen and we've lived the time out and we know it's laying in the word that that that that we which are alive and remain will not hinder those that are asleep and we can look back and we can see nearly seven ages of sleeping ones and yet we got a word from the apostle paul like joseph's bones they're not going to lay there forever but one day they're they're leaving here and they're going there to the promised land are you with me amen and we have went through time we have went through stages we've went through ages and brother brandon said the time of the rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapture in faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change their bodies that we live in when we see a god that can raise the dead off the floor and out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a god who can take a cancer that's eat a man to his shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapture and faith to the people amen the things we've been seeing happening of healings and deliverance even things that god has allowed you to to overcome and defeat a very wicked disease and we don't know we'll you know we don't know we may have to face it again six months later three months later here come again and hear it come again and hear it come again we don't know amen but we have seen what god's done and it's an hour that we should be holding a clear deed in our hands of a token the holy ghost that the debt has been paid and wave that in the face of satan amen and say you can't stay here you've got to pass over amen it ought to give rapture and faith to the people that when the light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sound and the body of christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken in the heavens schools of theology says will never produce it you've got to meet that light and i just want to say all the schools of and the halls of message theology and training will never produce it either you got to meet that light you got to find that something people talk about in illustrator he said you know if you if but the loss of your senses if you bound them up you know you take a bandage and bandage the eyes of children the eyes become weak they're never used the thought was if you bind up those senses you know long enough and enough generations pass you'd have people who were blind born blind and unable to see and brother branham would say if you don't use your senses they become dormant they won't act at all now i'm just going to say irregardless if that is true of the natural it is sure true of the spiritual you bind faith you're buying visions you're buying tongues and interpretations you bind prophecies it won't take two generations and it will become dormant and non-existent don't hang up on me it's the truth and that's what you're seeing that is happening around the world that they have been bound up by men's theology until they're almost non-existent the church don't know how to use this faith brother brandon said they placed their faith off you know that and he called preachers doing it he said place of faith off in miracles and signs and the things that contacts god and gives him the holy ghost and he plays that off back there somewhere or somewhere else till the thing has become dead and he don't know how to use it oh you'll say yeah god's a healer and he said you know what about that god's a healer if he ever was a healer he's still a healer if he ever was a savior he's still a savior if he ever was god he's still god so you see it's a lack of faith that has been preached into the people and that makes them let that sixth sense which is faith lay dormant and he cries out oh god we're supposed to be the children of abraham what a poor excuse we are oh god wake up that sixth sense in this church among these people faith is what subdued kingdoms faith is what wrought righteousness faith is what did all kinds of miracles and signs down through the ages you see wake it up take the bandage off and that's what we got to do in this hour if there ever was a time we take the bandages off amen and we open up our eyes and begin to look and see our god's still god and he still got to heal he's still god to deliver to awaken that faith amen by hearing the word there's seven thousand promises that lay in this in this bible seven thousand promises of divine healing awaken that faith by remembering his testimonies that's why testimonies are so important we gotta testify the grace of god amen notice brother branham would talk about that and he said in his own gift he said that he said now the gift doesn't heal he said what it's trying to do is get you in a condition to receive him as a healer he said something stimulate the faith that's in you for being a christian is there but it may be laying dormant the bible said he has given to every man a measure of faith but faith ain't any good if we don't use that faith [Music] amen and he said if they will just halfway believe they'll get a blessing well what would happen if we would fully believe we'll get a blessing just by halfway believing what would we get if we fully believe i say god tuned the strings of our faith i say god awakened that faith within us amen it laid in past generations it laid in lois and laid over here in eunice but it's also indeed and don't be timid to use it it's an hour to use faith like we've never used faith amen for sons of god to be on display manifested messiahs brother branham would say in revelation book of symbols god is waiting and trying and pressing to get at the mystery of god revealed his church that's what's holding back the coming of the lord now the great millennium is a supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church potentials are there the potentials are there this is why he would say in the message pardon why we ought to be a million miles up the road jesus is waiting on the church to get ready his bride has made herself ready we got the potentials the holy spirit is here god is here the power to heal the sick the power to do all things that christ did i've seen it demonstrated myself by the holy spirit so the potentials are here but he said what is holding us back what god is waiting for us is to get away from his our traditions and come back under the blood of his sons jesus christ and become the church of the living god how many is ready to be the church i mean the church that the gates of hell will not prevail against it amen the church that is an overcoming church that is his body amen oh my the bible said in romans 8 14 verse many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the holy spirit is the spirit of adoption it is the baptism of the spirit of jesus that makes us recognize that we are the sons of god and all creation is waiting on us to recognize and act in our position as we sit with christ with authority and power now thinking of that brother branham would talk about it like you know the german natural life germantis from father the father the father the father and he said so in such a way is the life of christ he said that's the reason god uses the spirit elijah five times it's the handing down so you would hand it down you know from elijah to elisha from elisha to john the baptist to john the baptist to elijah the prophet in this day brother branham and then right on down to um israel and as the final time that the spirit of elijah comes so he said it's a handing down and he said it just as your natural life and traits is handed down from the natural breeding of your father so is the spirit of god that was predestinated before the foundation of the world and when the entire word of god incomplete was headed up in a human body called jesus christ in there god made me pay for my sins in there hallelujah you look at the crucifix up there when jesus died you were in him and there's a handing down of righteousness amen that comes to everyone that is born of him amen and he said when he rose he raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what god has given amen but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you are seated there don't believe and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you're seated there you will use it for your ordained to do what you're to do a handing down amen and if god is present they're supernatural if it's jehovah god in god's presence they're supernatural romans 8 19 says for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the display the manifestations of the sons of god the display of sons the demonstration of sons and christ the mystery brother branham would would talk about this and he said you know today he said that in the last days men will become lovers of pleasures the apostle paul said truth breakers and false accusers and high-minded and heady despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness denying the power thereof and he said of this sort leads silly women led away with divers lust with shorts and bobbed hair everything else led away with divers lust never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and these men resisted it as janice and jamboree wistered moses able to produce a church produce a group of people but their folly will be made known when jesus takes his bride and sets her up here and says this is her and away he goes with her remember their folly has got to come know are you with me amen and he said what happened when jesus takes his bride and lifts her up puts her on display amen and and sets her up and say this is her and the way he goes with her i'll tell you what we're here on the greatest display of sons of god that there ever was don't you forget don't you forget we're not elijah but every time god sends an elijah there's an elisa who follows come on i'm not talking about another man i'm talking about a group of people when jesus was here come on the great prophet what was it a double portion was sent back to the church more than this said you do amen we have seen the display of god's supernatural power i'll tell you you ain't seen nothing yet am i we're here on the very brink of the display of sons of god where god will make their folly known of all the impersonators all the mockers all the scarners all the heavy the high-minded hallelujah and he'll take a bride up and say this is her and away he'll go with her what does creation why does creation have this expectation if there's no promise at the last day that the sons of god will rise up and conquer in the last days why is it the bible said all creation is under expectation the world is all concerned because creation is groaning it's easy you know they they're looking at it and the scientists are saying and they're counter science and and again you know you don't know whether you're putting pancakes on the roof because you know everybody's got their idea and everything else is as the minerals are depleted from the earth and dug out of it and the oil and the and the fumes and the gases and the dying and the the world that we're living in nature is groaning and the very reason they're travailing is they're crying for sons of god you know these tree huggers think that the earth is crying for them to save it they can't save it are you with me i'll go on all of this stuff and his ideas and what he can't save it all the money that would jump into it can't save it the world is groaning not for fallen sons but for adopted sons to bring a millennium back upon the earth again are you with me and let me tell you there is coming a renewed earth and all that you're hearing about the groaning of the earth and they cannot answer to the groaning but you can and the change will not start with the earth those chains will start with you the king of the earth when man fell the earth fell with him so the only way for the earth to rise again is for the king to come back into his place and we're right on the brink of it let me tell you something there is future for this earth there may not be future for cosmos the world but there is future for this earth satan cannot destroy it he can contaminate it but he can't destroy it amen we're we're going to have a thousand years of eden upon the earth and after that a new heavens and a new earth and it won't be a new heavens or a new earth in the sense of uh a brand new one something that didn't exist before but it'd be the same one turned inside out and sin eradicated and unbelievable all the scars of it taken away until the whole heavens will catch on with the fervent heat but the earth will have bone and on and on and on because she's in the thoughts of god as you are in the thoughts of god and look at this body that you're laying in and living in of earth let me tell you it may look like it's grown in it may look like it's decaying but satan can never destroy it hallelujah even if it goes down in the ground it will rise again he can plug it with sickness but it'll be healed again and we're here on the brink of the greatest healing campaign that there's ever been will we be changed from mortal to immortality [Applause] first john 3 and 1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us oh my what love he's bestowed upon us oh my that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knows us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be what we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is turn with me also to ephesians chapter 1 and verse 17. let's just look at this together now ephesians 1 that the lord that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believed according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places far above all principalities and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and have put all things hallelujah under his feet amen far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but the world to come amen what is it and it put all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so again what did he say he put the christ and his body which is the church and he triumphed over everything put it under your feet if it's under his feet come on somebody it's under your feet i might put all things under seed and gave him to be the head of the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all the church is christ's body in which he speaks and acts and by which he feels everything with his presence this is where he acts this is where he's going to move amen let me tell you you're looking for the second coming of christ and the meeting in the air he'll not even come to the earth we meet him in the air he'll not even come to the earth so everything god's going to do on the earth right now he's going to do it in his body the bride amen wherever his church goes there is his presence for he's acting and speaking in her are you with me amen when she can overcome her creeds brother branham said and the world that's drawn her in there she'll come back to be in the bride of jesus christ miseries jesus christ come to realize who we are we are miss each jesus christ we're miss jesus christ brother branham would say mr jesus and miss jesus he says elijah and elisha hallelujah i'm telling you there's an elijah people here upon the earth amen that god will do a double portion people worried about us impersonating brother branham forget about personally impersonating brother branham you know we are the we are the elisha to the light of jesus christ received a double portion of his spirit amen as he poured out himself in the message of token he said it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the bride and christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same that was so good i'm going to repeat it amen the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same and remember these former treaties of the theophilus have i wrote into you that jesus began to do and continues to do his death didn't stop him no sir he returned again not a third person but the same person returned in the form of the holy ghost and to continue the work on and continues on said the book of acts jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the token that's the sign now so you see that's why that's why we need to be in that place of revival where that our faith is tuned and awaken our faith again to the reality of god and why god has called you in this day amen he hadn't just called us to sit out here on the highway now and display us out here and where we were once in the back woods and way back out in claiborne parish and and some little donald trump roads you know and now put us out here where everybody can see us that's not the display god wants god wants a pride a people who is called by his name who does the works of jesus christ amen that they are anointed messiahs amen he's the great light they are little lights amen they are anointed ones christ means the anointed one and if a church is anointed by the messiah spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah amen because it's his light reflecting his power people wonder well where is the pillar of fire well where do you think it's supposed to be some people can only find it at the grave of brother branham that's the only place they've ever seen it hello hey man i i you know i i you know the the the holy spirit is everywhere perhaps he passes by there sometimes i don't know but that's no vindication the pillar of fire is not with the tomb the pillar of fire is with the people are you with me and the angel of the covenant brother branham said that pillar of fire he said if i die this very night now that pillar of fire has nothing to do with me i'm just a man that pillar fire is in the church not only with me it's in every one of you it's in all of us hallelujah amen this is where he said he was baptized with the holy ghost and fire every person in the upper room received a tongue of fire a portion of that pillar of fire you say well where is the pillow fire it's in the church not in the building in the church it is people amen in the paradox brother branham said again this pillar of fire is identified scientifically by reaction by its character everything else is the same as it was when it was dwelling in the body of god's only begotten son so does it dwell in the body of his adopted sons for the last day hallelujah the pillar of fire dwells it lives in the adopted sons for the last days now you want to know where the pillar of fire is it's in every holy ghost-filled person amen amen it's the son of man being revealed in the bride body amen again go away jesus brother branham said you know i believe his earthly ministry has never ceased because he's in his people now so think about that the earthly ministry of jesus still goes on it's in its people this is why i would say it is it is under your feet every principality every power every spirit is under your feet amen because it's under his feet and his earthly ministry has never ceased because he's in his people now the hebrew book he would say it this way he said now god has always been on the earth god has never left the earth if he'd ever leave the earth i don't know what would become of it but god's always been here in some form oh praise his name in case you're wondering even after the bride leaves god will still be here amen filling and sealing 144 000 with the holy spirit anointing in you and and using elijah and moses come on amen leading them as he's seen in revelation 14 15 16 there uh that group there that 144 thousand up up on to mount zion all of that he's shown there even god will never leave the earth brother branham said when he when he was preaching campaigns he said now when i leave here the holy spirit will not leave amen somehow another you know people's faith wound up dying with the prophet again it's not in a tomb amen it's not in a tomb our faith is not to die with the prophet of god amen it's a handing down if it was in the prophet god there's a handing down of the spirit of god the same spirit that was upon elijah rest upon elijah he said he was with the children in the wilderness coming out of egypt in the form of a light he spoke to abraham in the form of a man he spoke to moses in the form of a man he spoke to the church in the form of a man his son christ jesus and he's speaking through his church today through the anointed church of the living god through vessels of clay you are the branches i am the vine and god is still speaking and the world sees jesus as you present him that's how the world is you are written epistles read of all men your life tells you what you are god has been building he's been building the church through the years until we come up even brother branham said it would come up like a pyramid not a pyramid but like one coming up narrow narrow as it comes and and to receive a capstone and and and he says there to meet the capstone there has to be a ministry that's exactly like him so that the two will unite together but that's why again there has to be manifested messiahs in the last day because there has to be a ministry that matches him it's the messiah the anointed one that anointing that we that we referred to that must come down that had to come down to malachi 4 an anointing coming down to bring back the faith this is why he would tell us in christ or the mighty god and veil he said that you know god was in christ god in a man the fullness of godhead bodily in a man god and a man now is god in men the fullness of the god hit bodily in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word the fullness of the godhead bodily now in the ages past we had luther that had a portion we had wesley with a portion with azusa street with a greater portion but this is not a day of portions this is the day are you with me where the fullness of the godhead bodily is in a people now he's not here just as a portion of his spirit he's not here just as a dead hopeless theology he's here in his fullness amount brother branham would talk about that and he said he would first reveal itself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the godhead body into a people this is god's plan it's the handing down this is why i would say god expressed in jesus christ who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily but now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence and that all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was was poured in the church the believers amen it was the anointed man but now it's the anointed people amen the anointed with the fullness of the godhead body how can we doubt it it's been promised for this hour you know when we can look back at jesus and moses fortunately partially had him and david had him and parsons you know had him partially and solomon and the songs of david all of them had him in portion but when jesus came he was all of that in one body hallelujah amen here we are in the last days you know he did that remember he did that the purpose of him doing that was that he could give his life on calvary and to bring that same fullness back into the church again about where that luther had him in portion wesley had him in portion and others had him in portion now the fullness of the godhead bodily have been poured out into a people for the last day for messiahs to be on display are we at the time brother branham said in there there would come a time and i want to deal with this just for a minute there would come a time he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in this church what oh my the anointed man now the anointed people almighty bring back what the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by what accepting what he turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit and the anointed with the word what he turned down he comes back and we accept now brother branham said there would be a time come forth i think brother branham when he would look at the seven thunder is going to be revealed and he said sirs is this the time and i'm looking at this right here at the moment when a prophet would say there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead oh god think these message preachers say you can't express him in the fullness of his godhead and deny the holy ghost deny the power of god deny divine healing just turn it into a cold hopeless theology you can't do it there is a time that has come forth word that he would express himself in the fullness of his godhead i say sirs is this the time is this the hour well if we're not who is if it's not the hour when is it if it's not the age when will it come somebody help me we're out of ages we're out of messages we're out of prophets i'm talking about messenger church ain't messengers we're out we we've reached the end and we there hasn't come a time for that he can express himself in the fullness of his godhead bodily deity through his church had the preeminence oh my i'm in the middle of something right here oh god help me today the anointed man now the anointed people to bring back the anointed pride and bridegroom anointed by what accepting what he turned down did that go over your head what did he turn down she turned down the opportunity to bring forth a spoken word child to become impregnated by the word she chose labor and child baron and sorrow come on instead read the bible you know what happened through the choice that she made when she turned down the opportunity amen yes yes she had she she had she was made out of the soil yes she was made of the dust of the earth yes she but she was the highest of all of the cattle in the field the fowl of the air she had dominion and she was more she was more than dust she had a soul and that soul was in the presence of god and then could bring heaven down on the earth and a millennial condition was there on the earth the lion laid down by the lamb nothing heard or destroyed in all my holy mountain amen what eve turned down what did she turn down she turned down the opportunity to have a spoken word child a child of the word come on amen she turned it down and the end and because of that it entered into sorrow trouble death affliction and everyone that was been bored of that way has been born in that condition amen what did he turn down she object she turned down the opportunity to bring forth a spoken word child a child of the word and if we're not careful that's exactly what the second eve will do again in this last day i mean she don't want any of them screaming hollering acts 2 38 blabbering screaming miserable creatures she thinks they are come on a man he would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to it would throw her out at the next council she can't have it she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth amen invisible union he would say this way again and at the end time both trees are coming to seed and proving themselves we're right here today laodicea and the bride just clear and pretty as it could be in the scripture right before your faces you can't serve god and mammon you can't be a virtuous believing christian and associate self in a denominational affair and i'll tell you church when you just have this easy believer when you have justice coming to the altar accepting christ and and that's it and never really getting changed are you with me it's a denominational affair amen and he says you can't do it at the same time one's got to be dead let the other live neither can you bear god's word son neither can the church bring forth they don't want one of them of screaming shouting speaking in tongues and all them things you can't do that in a denominational church can't do it in message churches because they're denominations they won't have you they don't want to bring them like that they will they take them up and shake their hands that if you believe it you got it as long as you put your name on the book that's all you have to do see it's illegitimate children to the word and still claim to be religious amen you see jesus would say if i don't do the works that is written to me don't believe me but if i'm doing the works that's written of me then believe what i'm telling you is the truth that's why there always must be signs following them that believe because we must do what is written of us it is written as us we shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover come on it is written of us jesus would say who can condemn me of sin you tell me one word the father said to me that i hadn't done that you can't if you can if i hadn't fulfilled all the word that's written to me then you can point your finger at me but i've done exactly what the scripture said i would do said oh if the church would take that stand tonight as a representative of jesus christ where are we short amen god i want to live to see the day that the church of jesus christ can be one in purpose and heart and body standing in the full anointed power of the holy spirit to perform and work like jesus did with god in them too amen now there are there again who can condemn me a sin who can condemn me who can say i disbelieve the word well when you've got a church and there's no signs and wonders among them they're disbelievers of the word amen when all the births are stillborn babies they are disbelievers of the word but when you have believers in the word true belief come on who can condemn us a sin amen god still heals cancer yeah god still heals heals brain bleeds yeah god still heals alopecia yeah god still heals crippled children yeah god still is a deliverer he's the same in principle amen who can condemn me of sin show me where what the father said we would do that we're not doing that's where the church has to stand [Music] because in this day we can't just claim to be messiahs we must be messiahs on display a bride that he will say this is her and the way he lifts her up and the way he goes with him let me find a stopping place but i want you to look at your life and see if he's doing the works that he promised he would do the works of christ of course is not just miracles and healings amen what about the what about the miracle of truth-telling if you're still lying he's not there amen what about the miracle of keeping your tongue i mean that's a miracle you know if you're still cheating and stealing he's not there if you're still in porn jesus not in your ship you went off without him hey man you might you might have met him down at the altar and talked to him a little bit you didn't take him with you hey man what about the miracle of never drinking or smoking or doping again i mean i you know i you know we we again we have those trying to destroy the faith and it's not being preached i know we got preachers that tell you yeah you know you're you're bright and you you just grow out of it but these you just grow out of these sins they're lying to you i mean they're folks representation of the message amen all you don't have to listen but a few tapes and you'll know that that teaching that kind of teaching's an absolute lie amen it's no different what's taught in the denomination somewhere it denies the power of the gospel that will enable you to live and overcome in life let me tell you this gospel works it ain't just a charismatic religion you know of a tongue or a prophecy if something comes to pass once in a while or healing or a miracle it's more than that it's a life that is changed [Music] you know let me just help you here a little bit if you're always struggling to live a christian life to overcome dope and alcohol and all these other you you need jesus you don't have him you're not born again amount and just let me just tell you a shocker you're not bright i don't whip some people's head off and spin them around but some of people need a head spun around i saw an old silence film of laurel and hardy years ago a silent film was on 16 millimeters how far back it was they went into some ritzy place and one of them knocked over a statue and you know it scared them because they were supposed to be moving a piano and it was expensive place and they had never seen and they were all goggle eyed and they looked over this statue and touched it and it fell over and the head fell off and so the guy grabbed it and he puts it back on but he sets it on backwards the other guy he's coming along behind him some steps later from one room to the other and they're looking at this marvelous place and so ritzy and everything else and he sees that statue there with his head on backwards and he goes and that's what i want to do sometimes when i look around and i see these that have got their heads on backwards turn it around people might have got used to it ahead on backwards but i ain't used to it amen i know i know this you're not bride let me tell you why you're not bright because you can only become bride by being united and married to him and you cannot be united christ and still be do be doing cocaine or drinking a beer or two dabbling in this or that come on you cannot be the bride of christ and be doing that you're not married to him you've got another husband you might claim to be bride and i would say potentially i hope you are with all my heart i like to believe you are but i don't see any evidence yet the evidence is a changed life where you hate sin well i hate it but i can't help but do it no you don't hate it you still love it it's still your love life although you might claim to hate the way you are and maybe even say i hate that i hate that cocaine i hate that alcohol i hate that tobacco i hate that those drugs i hate that you know that porno but the truth of it is you still love it you're still at slate it's still your master and you might protest but i love jesus perhaps so but you love sin more it's still your master you can't serve two masters you'll love one and hate the other come on of course you would never say you hate jesus but you just let him left and here's the truth of matter you don't know jesus you might know of his word but you don't know him you might know of some of his truths but you don't know jesus to know jesus is to know of his power to save and deliver amen now i'm not saying there's no hope for you i'm telling you that your only hope is jesus amen you'll never find jesus by digging until you find some preacher that'll comfort you amen by telling you your bride and that god will never lose you that you're predestinated and you'll be okay the truth is you're not bright and you're not okay and you're lost and the only way for you to come bride is to die is sin what sin nature is dead and you're born again a new creation a brand new species and that's who i'm talking about the bride of christ she's a brand new species she's born again that's why she can believe so well where will i find jesus well well i find him at the altar maybe maybe not well i find him at my pew maybe maybe not will i find him there when i'm driving down the car one day maybe maybe not or where you're going to find jesus when you get rid of your stinking pride and you realize i must get to jesus when you realize you're a dying man and you're grasping for straws and these trials come from false preachers and they ain't saving me finding jesus comes only to repentance by turning from sin and being born again and your old man is dead sorry until that happens you're not bright but you can be but you got to let go of the other lovers first i'm predestinated you don't know that until you get the holy ghost the bible said you're predestinated to adoption is that right amen and so you see when you get the holy ghost and you know i always was his when you get the holy spirit you can look back and say i never really belong to the devil he has no claim on me i'm blood washed i'm not just blood washed and my sins is gone they're annihilated and they're not just annihilated they've been changed by the chemistry of the blood until it lays on the head of the accuser and the one who accused me is going to hell not me hell was created for the devil and his angels it was never created for one son of god and i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god it's a positive token it's not a hopes of religion the bible said to he that's born of god does not commit sin for he cannot sin for the seed of god remains in him and how can he sin when a sinless god is in him when he's when a sinless god he's in a sinless god how can he sin no matter what he's done the blood's covered him he is a new creature now his desires and ambitions is in heaven that's what you want to find out where are your desires amen worries what is your ambitions amen what is your heart set upon amen his desires and ambition is heaven because he's chained from a cup of bird to a wheat his desires aren't the same as it once was and he displays it you say well i believe that and you're still sinning now you're deceived it can't display nothing but the token oh yeah well i'll tell you what brother tim this body is mine and i can i can do what i want to with it i want you to remember he also created your body and our bodies will have to obey him you surrender your thoughts to him surrender your life or into your faith you watch his body your body start doing what he says automatically if you're a drunkard you can't quit drinking surrender that life to him you won't drink no more amen if you're a mitchell smoker try to give it up and can't do it surrender that to him watch what happens amen he'll make that body come in subjection to the word but you've got to surrender it to him you've got to believe him as many as received him to them he gave you power to be sons of god he makes our body they obey his will they obey his will also you believe that if you're a christian you have to you say he makes our bodies obey oh i believe we have jurisdiction over that and there are some of you do so you put a still put on paint still cut your hair still wear the wrong kind of clothes still use abusive drugs and alcohol and this and that because you got jurisdiction of it but you're not fully surrendered amen but when them whole worldly thoughts die and that old man that old sin nature dies and you're born again anew you're a new creature in christ jesus and old things are passed away and behold all things become new and it's not hard anymore to live a christian life there's no struggle it's natural and it's supernatural what you could not do before it does for you amen it changes you and what a secure feeling that is is knowing and watching the holy spirit change your nature from a vile person and then know you pass them death into life and see his holy spirit living in his life and so then his works become on display manifested sons your little sisters new men all of us we walk down the streets displaying the gospel of jesus christ amen displaying the gospel of jesus christ it's lived out of our lives it's manifest it's messiahs on this play no not not just oh we all we healed the sick we did this we had a miracle here you know that no our lives are displaying his character you know we're we're missing something you know we're we're doing a lot of preaching on the flash and the flash and the flash and listen get the holy ghost and you won't have to worry about the flesh you'll have something that will rule the flesh there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit sure you feed your flesh it's going to destroy you but if you get the holy ghost you won't feed the flesh you'll walk in the spirit it'll teach you and guide you and lead you into all truths that's why brother branham said we find there's something missing in our churches it's the power of christ it starts on the very elementary level we've got to live right first it's not a bunch of do's and don'ts it's about a nature change you know you no more have to tell christians anymore don't don't do this and don't do that and don't do that any more than walking out looking at apple trees don't you never bear any pears you never have to tell that apple tree don't bear pears you're an apple tree right because why it's from the nature it's from the nature it's from the root and when you are from the root christ then christ is going to be through all the branches then these signs will follow them that believe hallelujah then they live overcoming lives and then there will be that power that is in the church brother branham said we're missing something we're missing power we ought to have where the big machine ought to be running and great signs and wonders which building ought to be full of the power of god till sinners couldn't stay in here the holy spirit condemned it right quickly like that like ananias of our and we're missing something then he say where are we short god i want to live to see the day that the church of jesus christ can be one in purpose heart and body standing in the full anointed power of the holy spirit to perform and work like jesus did with god in them too too often we're still preaching reformation instead of restoration pastors are trying to reform the church and she can't be reformed without making just another denominational child denomination of children still had to be reformed by constant preaching against the sins of flesh if you ever get that man or woman converted you don't have to worry about the deeds of the flesh amen what god is once he wants sons of god with power and that power starts with your flesh bringing it subject bring it to the obedience to the will of christ listen when when man sin he yielded his members to satan to sin with right in other words his hands his feet his eyes his mouth his mouth that never spoke guiled was never dishonest he yielded that to satan and now he begins to speak that now he begins to behave in ways that he would have never done as a son of god because why sin nature had taken hold but when you're born again you're a new creature in christ and sin nature has no more dominion sin does not have dominion over you it does not reign over your body you reign over sin and you bring that body subject to the word of god now you are members we're at righteousness amen we're going to stop right there because i want to deal in the next time what sin did it made a chasm between man and god but then i want to show you what the new birth does it takes the chasm completely away where there's never even a remembrance anymore that god can never look at and say one time you were over there and you don't ever have to worry about falling in the chasm again because it's gone forever and you stand under the blood as an adopted son and operate as a son bringing everything under dominion sin unbelief doubt every kind of sin whatever you name it you bring it under it's dominion you have dominion again you're a son a messiah on display let's stand together that the musician comes let me just read this to you remember when sin entered the picture it put a breach a chasm between god and man but reformation will never bring you back only restoration and brother bradley said in the future home just like all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you you don't accept it it accepts you because it's god's attribute see if it's the holy ghost it means god's spirit and it's the attribute the thought of god has accepted you because you were ordained for that purpose yet you were born in sin but god had that attribute and here you expressed yourself on here on earth and he comes down and gets you and your back here here is where you belong see sin has lost its power that's right this desire of sin has done gone from your heart when the holy spirit comes in you are a restored person not a reformed person a restored person restored to what what god had in his mind of you before the world began a restored person that's where we're standing that's what the message is about restoration is not about reformation find that old song redeemed how i love to proclaim it redeemed by the blood of the lamb let's just worship god for a moment [Music] we're redeemed been bought with a price how i love to proclaim it redeemed by his infinite mercy his child he might lose me now his child and forever amen i am no going back no falling away no more disgrace no shame on me and i got a token the holy ghost that says every debt against me was paid and my deed is cleared and that's what god did in this day was to confirm it to an end time people amen redeemed how i love to proclaim it [Music] i [Music] [Applause] [Music]
