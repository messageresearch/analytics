[43:02] as the heart paneth after the water
[43:05] Brooks so panteth my soul after thee o
[43:09] God
[43:10] my soul thirsts for God for the Living
[43:12] God
[43:13] When shall I come and appear before God
[43:16] my tears have been my meat and day and
[43:19] night while they continually say unto me
[43:21] where is thy God what I when I remember
[43:24] these things I pour out my soul in me
[43:27] for I've gone with a multitude I went
[43:29] with them to the house of God with the
[43:31] voice of joy and praise with a multitude
[43:34] that kept holy day why art thou cast
[43:38] down on my soul or thou disquieting me
[43:41] hope thou and God for us so yet praise
[43:44] him for the help of his countenance oh
[43:47] my God my soul is cast down Within Me
[43:50] therefore I remember thee from the land
[43:53] of Jordan and of the hermionites and
[43:57] from the hill mizar the Deep calleth
[44:00] unto the Deep at the noise of thy water
[44:03] spouts all thy waves and thy Billows are
[44:07] gone over me
[44:09] amen we let you be seated
[44:26] I I don't think that we could find
[44:28] anyone in here that could say that we
[44:31] didn't have some wonderful meetings
[44:33] amen just a wonderful outpouring of the
[44:36] Holy Spirit if if you didn't get what
[44:38] you needed it wasn't anybody's fault but
[44:40] yours
[44:41] amen because God was here and the
[44:44] atmosphere was in place and and God was
[44:46] moving in a miraculous way and we saw
[44:50] him move very uh spontaneously in many
[44:53] ways and and many many different Avenues
[44:56] and uh just a prayer line that would
[44:58] form and different things even Sunday
[45:00] afternoon as the Lord would begin to
[45:03] still deal with hearts and and I just
[45:05] want to say thank you to all that was
[45:07] involved in in helping with every part
[45:10] of that I I was saying to the ones in
[45:12] the back that this meeting went went
[45:14] without a hitch it wasn't a even a
[45:16] hiccup and it was because of Amen
[45:20] dedicated hearts that saw a vision and
[45:22] and put their heart into it and we've
[45:24] witnessed the Glorious outpouring of the
[45:27] spirit of God there were many healings
[45:29] there were many deliverances there were
[45:31] families that were restored amen there
[45:34] were many things and no doubt we'll mark
[45:37] this uh for a long time as one of the
[45:39] the greatest meetings we've ever ever
[45:42] been in
[45:43] but I want to say it's in the past
[45:46] and I want to also say I want more
[45:50] amen I don't think we should ever amen
[45:54] just only be able to point to the past
[45:55] and what God did but God is still moving
[45:59] and God is still touching and I I
[46:00] believe we ought to come to every
[46:02] service with the expectation amen you
[46:05] know we call them special meetings but
[46:07] every service that we ever Gather in
[46:09] ought to be special amen we ought to be
[46:11] expecting amen the outpouring of the
[46:13] Holy Ghost and we we have that a lot
[46:15] here at this church and and God comes
[46:18] according to our expectations amen and
[46:21] he comes according to what we're
[46:22] expecting him to do if you expected him
[46:24] to do the exceedingly abundantly he'll
[46:27] do the exceedingly abundantly if you
[46:29] expect him to heal and deliver he'll do
[46:31] exactly that whatever you expect amen I
[46:34] believe he would do and so tonight amen
[46:36] just as uh even that that song that
[46:39] brother Michael brought to the to the
[46:41] meetings and and I've been listening to
[46:43] it over through the week amen I I just
[46:46] want to speak for a moment on I want
[46:48] more amen I'm not satisfied I was
[46:51] yesterday but I want more I believe
[46:53] every day ought to be a fresh and a new
[46:55] experience with the Lord amen I believe
[46:58] our I believe we ought to be looking for
[47:00] a you know as a children of Israel they
[47:02] went out and they gathered Manna amen
[47:04] they couldn't depend on the manna that
[47:05] they gathered yesterday but they had to
[47:07] gather more for every day of their life
[47:09] and it ain't just get the one it ain't
[47:11] just a one and done with the Holy Ghost
[47:13] and one and done when his presence and
[47:15] one and done but we need to be expecting
[47:18] God to move more and more and greater
[47:20] and greater than he ever has before amen
[47:23] because we're looking to something
[47:25] greater that's never happened before
[47:27] amen we're a group of people is going to
[47:29] take a body change
[47:31] amen if you say it happened I guess you
[47:33] know we could look back to Abraham and
[47:34] Sarah but as a group amen a
[47:37] multi-membered body amen I believe we
[47:39] have to be moving our faith to that
[47:41] moment to believe for that moment amen
[47:44] so therefore our faith King decrease has
[47:46] got to increase amen and so I want to
[47:49] look at this and I want to look again at
[47:51] another scripture in Psalms 34 and verse
[47:53] 1. it said I Will Bless The Lord at all
[47:57] times
[47:58] I will bless the all the Lord at all
[48:01] times and his praise shall continually
[48:04] be in my mouth amen not just in a
[48:07] certain setting or a certain time but at
[48:09] all times my soul shall make her boast
[48:12] in the Lord The Humble shall hear
[48:14] thereof and be glad o magnify the Lord
[48:16] with me and let us exalt his name
[48:18] together I sought the Lord and he heard
[48:21] me and he delivered me from all my fears
[48:24] they looked unto him and were lightened
[48:26] and their faces were not ashamed this
[48:29] poor man cried and the Lord heard him
[48:31] and saved him out of all his troubles
[48:34] have you found yourself anywhere in
[48:35] there the angel of the Lord and campus
[48:38] round about them that fear Him and
[48:40] delivereth them oh taste and see that
[48:44] the Lord is good and blessed is the man
[48:47] that trustses in him oh fear the lord
[48:49] use his Saints for there is no want to
[48:53] them that fear Him oh taste and see I
[48:56] love how the scripture put that it
[48:57] wasn't oh see that the Lord is good oh
[49:00] taste and see amen you can see a picture
[49:04] of a of a wonderful meal or maybe your
[49:06] favorite thing you ever ate maybe it's
[49:08] crawfish or whatever it is you can see a
[49:10] picture of that but that is nothing like
[49:13] be able to be there and taste what it's
[49:15] like amen when you taste it and you put
[49:17] it in your mouth the picture is good it
[49:19] looks good looks amazing but it's just a
[49:21] picture amen but if you could ever taste
[49:24] it if you could ever put it into your
[49:26] mouth it'll start Awakening the sensory
[49:29] things in your mouth and saliva start
[49:32] falling and things are beginning your
[49:34] stomach will start rumbling amen as you
[49:36] begin to taste and if it's good you'll
[49:39] want more of it
[49:41] amen if it's what you thought it was
[49:43] going to be and it's what you've been
[49:44] designed you'll want more of it amen one
[49:47] little bite won't satisfy you amen will
[49:49] want more and more and more amen many
[49:52] times more than your portion amen amen
[49:55] the prophet of God said it like this he
[49:56] said the supper call is home the robes
[49:59] are being given God is taken from the
[50:01] gentile people for his namesake in the
[50:04] last days and he's bringing them in
[50:06] through campaigns of healing the lame
[50:08] blind the Halt and the withered he said
[50:11] now these big starchy stuck-ups won't
[50:13] even come they think they're better but
[50:15] Jesus said they won't taste my supper
[50:18] Hallelujah but you can taste and see
[50:21] that the Lord is good it tastes like
[50:23] Honey in the Rock and oh how good it is
[50:27] he said I've seen it in the churches
[50:29] well people will all be filled in a
[50:31] little prayer meeting somewhere to the
[50:33] children even lick their tongues it's so
[50:35] good spiritually speaking wonderful it's
[50:38] Honey in the Rock
[50:40] hallelujah amen he said to remind him
[50:42] one time of being up there in a hunting
[50:44] trip and and he was going he had caught
[50:46] a few trout and was going to skin him
[50:47] out and make him a little breakfast and
[50:49] he was getting some things together and
[50:50] he come back into Camp after he cleaned
[50:52] up the trout and got them all skinned up
[50:54] and he's going to bring him in and find
[50:56] his frying pan and his grease and things
[50:58] and here's a bunch of rumbling going on
[51:00] he looks in there and there's these
[51:01] bears that are coming to the camp and
[51:03] they had found at something he couldn't
[51:05] figure out what it was until he finally
[51:07] could get over a little bit and he could
[51:09] find where one little Cub had found the
[51:11] Molasses jar and somehow he had got the
[51:14] top off of it and he stuck his paws in
[51:16] there and he said ma he was just having
[51:18] a wonderful time and and he said I was
[51:21] just watching him as it took place and
[51:23] and then he said I tried to make a noise
[51:25] he said if you ain't careful those bears
[51:27] and scratches what he said he said so I
[51:29] try to make a little noise to get him
[51:30] out of the way and that's when Mama Bear
[51:32] made a little noise and sent one Cub
[51:33] running and but the other one wouldn't
[51:35] leave there was something that had his
[51:37] attention it was something that was
[51:39] greater than and the fear of men or the
[51:41] fear of what's around him or what was
[51:43] going on around the circumstances he
[51:46] found something better
[51:48] and he wasn't ready to leave it and she
[51:50] could coo and she could call and he just
[51:52] kept on stopping he said and he stopped
[51:55] some more and he stopped some more and
[51:57] he stopped some more he said till he got
[51:58] the last sop out of the bucket
[52:01] and he said he ran back when he finally
[52:03] got that last little sop out of the
[52:05] bucket and he pulled his foot up and he
[52:07] saw me he said I thought he saw I
[52:10] thought my he said what's going to
[52:11] happen now he said he got he said I
[52:13] screamed get away from here and he ran
[52:15] to his mama he said but they didn't go
[52:16] nowhere for a while because they
[52:18] realized he had something on him that
[52:20] they wanted and they began to stop and
[52:23] they begin to he said a brother if that
[52:25] ain't the old time Pentecostal meeting I
[52:27] never saw one got his hand in the Honey
[52:30] Bucket come up to his arm like that just
[52:32] sopping away all condemnation was gone
[52:35] all fear was gone everything was on the
[52:39] only thing in his mind was I want some
[52:42] more
[52:44] Hallelujah I want some more amen they
[52:48] say the only thing he was doing is just
[52:50] kept oh it tastes like Honey in the Rock
[52:52] the strange one thing was when he
[52:54] finally sopped the bucket out he went
[52:56] over to where this Mammy was and his
[52:57] little brother and they began to lick on
[53:00] him just like the red like he had
[53:02] getting them some of the honey amen I
[53:04] believe that's what we should do that's
[53:06] why we should share our testimonies it
[53:08] is sharing the honey that we received
[53:11] it is sharing the things of God and the
[53:13] goodness of God that we have tasted and
[53:16] saw that he was good we have saw that
[53:18] he'll raise the dead we have saw that
[53:21] he'll heal the sick we have saw amen
[53:23] they'll take depression off our lives
[53:25] and break black streaks of family
[53:27] troubles off of life we have saw it and
[53:30] therefore we want some more of it
[53:32] we want more of his goodness we want
[53:35] more of his grace we want more of the
[53:37] Holy Ghost to be poured out in our lives
[53:39] we want more
[53:40] [Applause]
[53:44] Hallelujah
[53:46] he said one thing the Tabernacle needs
[53:48] us is the Tabernacle with Jeff he says
[53:51] is a rededication and a refilling of the
[53:54] Holy Ghost everyone to get to the Altar
[53:57] and pray until they get a renewing the
[53:59] whole church be filled with the power of
[54:01] God he said that's what we need not only
[54:03] the Tabernacle there but the body of
[54:05] Christ Universal I I like David said it
[54:09] one day restoring to me the joy of my
[54:11] salvation see he hadn't lost his
[54:13] salvation but he lost the joy of it and
[54:17] he said when it comes to a place I can't
[54:19] enjoy my religion there's something
[54:21] wrong somewhere
[54:24] you ought to want more of it amen there
[54:27] should be an enjoyment amen if there's a
[54:30] something that whatever your brother
[54:32] brother Joe what's your favorite meal
[54:35] yeah
[54:37] I know what it is and he don't even know
[54:40] it's Biscuits and tomato gravy
[54:44] [Applause]
[54:46] when he gets some of it he might be on a
[54:49] diet but he'll let that diet go
[54:52] amen amen if he could just find somebody
[54:55] that'll make him a good pan of biscuits
[54:57] and tomato gravy you got one happy man
[54:59] right there and let me let you know he
[55:02] ain't interested in just a little nibble
[55:03] on it oh he might nibble on something
[55:06] else sometime but that ain't what he
[55:08] really desires but if he ever gets what
[55:10] he really wants
[55:12] amen and I found evening like Tabernacle
[55:16] has found what she really wants
[55:19] the other world other churches they can
[55:21] nibble they can nibble but this church
[55:23] has found the goodness of God and God is
[55:27] being poured out in hers and we want
[55:30] more
[55:38] Hallelujah if you can't enjoy your
[55:41] religion there's something wrong with
[55:43] you but I like enjoying my religion I
[55:46] like to enjoy the presence of God I like
[55:49] to just sit in it and then let him rain
[55:51] down or dance or shout or whatever it
[55:54] takes I'm going to enjoy it
[56:00] Hallelujah if you got a problem with me
[56:03] enjoying it you just ain't tasted it yet
[56:06] maybe it ain't your favorite thing to
[56:08] eat
[56:11] amen
[56:13] Hallelujah
[56:15] it was a debate that was being taken
[56:18] place it was an infant that was saying
[56:21] there was no such a thing as God
[56:23] doing that little silly looking boy
[56:26] sitting there with his hair hanging down
[56:27] his eyes over all his own came walking
[56:29] out one tooth out in the front stood up
[56:33] in front of that Infidel started peeling
[56:35] the Apple
[56:36] he said what do you want
[56:38] little boy said I want to ask you a
[56:39] question he said well ask
[56:41] well wait a minute he just kept peeling
[56:43] his Apple
[56:44] cut the core out of it got it just like
[56:46] he wanted
[56:47] he said hurry up see what you're going
[56:49] to do say her or I'll I'll get you
[56:51] through it wait just a minute and he
[56:53] kept peeling the Apple
[56:55] and he took a piece and he put it in his
[56:57] mouth and he chewed on and swallowed it
[56:58] he said I had to ask you a question is
[57:01] this apple sweet or is it sour
[57:05] Infidel said I'm not eating it I don't
[57:07] know he said that's what I thought
[57:09] and he walked right on down and sat down
[57:11] how do you know whether there's a holy
[57:13] ghost or not until you received it how
[57:16] do you know Jesus heals or not until you
[57:19] receive it
[57:20] how do you know what it's like to be in
[57:22] the presence of God till you've been in
[57:24] it
[57:26] how do you know what it's like to be
[57:28] free until you're free
[57:32] once you realize what it was to be a
[57:35] free man you want more of it
[57:41] everybody else can kind of look and
[57:43] don't don't understand and don't know
[57:45] what's going on and what's happening
[57:47] look at that person dancing and they can
[57:49] call it a bunch of work up and a bunch
[57:50] of motion the problem is they ain't ate
[57:53] the apple
[57:54] they ain't hated the presence of God oh
[57:56] taste and see that the Lord is good
[58:03] they want more of it
[58:06] no matter how much you read out of the
[58:08] Bible
[58:10] that won't work the Holy Ghost has got
[58:12] to witness it to you that he's
[58:14] resurrected in your life therefore you
[58:17] won't know whether sweet or whether or
[58:19] sour as David said taste and see that
[58:22] the Lord is good who knows if it's good
[58:25] before you taste it
[58:29] but it's he that tasted it that knows
[58:37] Hallelujah as old saying goes the proof
[58:40] of the puddin isn't in the eating
[58:43] thereof
[58:45] Hey listen
[58:46] I've seen some beautiful cakes
[58:50] that look beautiful
[58:52] looked amazing
[58:53] look like you're even you're starting
[58:55] you know stuff starts
[58:58] and all of a sudden you get your slice
[59:00] of it and it's terrible
[59:04] look it tastes like you put some kind of
[59:06] sweet stuff on cornbread or taste got
[59:08] some funny taste it's it's all to us
[59:14] you're like man that thing don't taste
[59:16] as good as it looks
[59:18] it's deceiving
[59:20] a lot of people's religion looks real
[59:22] good
[59:23] but you get a taste of it you find out
[59:25] there's a lot of bitterness there
[59:27] amen you find out there's a lot of
[59:29] dryness there you find out there ain't
[59:31] much moisture of the spirit of God there
[59:33] you realize the rain ain't been on it
[59:38] kind of gets in your mouth and you can't
[59:39] hardly swallow it and you're trying to
[59:41] get it down and trying to and it just
[59:43] won't go and there's it just ain't there
[59:46] but I've also saw some cakes that didn't
[59:48] look like much
[59:50] wasn't the prettiest ice and wouldn't
[59:52] have put together the best but boy when
[59:54] you got a bite of it you wanted more
[59:57] you got a bite of his eye on another
[59:59] piece of that
[1:00:01] let me just give you a little hint while
[1:00:02] we're just family here if brother Tim
[1:00:04] ever hands you a piece of cake it ain't
[1:00:06] no good
[1:00:09] [Applause]
[1:00:11] I made that mistake before
[1:00:17] me once it's your fault fool me twice is
[1:00:20] mine
[1:00:21] amen it ain't no good
[1:00:25] amen but when when he's over there and
[1:00:28] he ain't giving you none you want a
[1:00:29] piece of that cake
[1:00:32] amen there's something in there that's
[1:00:34] good it may not look the best it may not
[1:00:36] be the you may be your favorite but if
[1:00:38] it if he's eating it you want it
[1:00:42] I know it's going to get you in trouble
[1:00:43] because sister's going to be looking at
[1:00:45] you like is he eating my cake or not
[1:00:51] but I was it I was there before I was
[1:00:54] sitting in a group of people and he got
[1:00:55] his peace and and I was waiting on my
[1:00:58] piece and it looked so good looked so
[1:00:59] good and he said here you can have mine
[1:01:01] I didn't think about it I just took me a
[1:01:03] big old bite
[1:01:07] I see why you gave it to me the proof of
[1:01:10] the pudding is in the eating thereof
[1:01:12] therefore you wonder why some people's
[1:01:15] religion you just don't want none of it
[1:01:17] you tried it but I don't want no more
[1:01:19] none of it but if you can ever get the
[1:01:21] sweetness of the honey of God and you
[1:01:24] can get into the spirit of the Wrath the
[1:01:26] realm of the spirit of God and let it
[1:01:28] get to flowing over you and then you'll
[1:01:30] know why there's joy in the heart said
[1:01:32] why we got a George shoes on and why are
[1:01:35] we rejoicing if you'll just eat what
[1:01:37] we're eating
[1:01:39] if you don't want it it's up to you I
[1:01:42] ain't gonna make you eat it
[1:01:45] ain't gonna make you eat it
[1:01:49] but just get a taste
[1:01:51] just get a taste
[1:01:54] he says
[1:01:56] he said see he said he was sitting there
[1:01:59] and he said see no man can say Jesus is
[1:02:01] the Christ only by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:04] you need a taste
[1:02:06] he said well how do you know taste and
[1:02:08] see
[1:02:09] give God a chance
[1:02:11] see if he will take it and give your
[1:02:13] glory give you glory for your misery see
[1:02:17] if he will give you happiness for your
[1:02:19] Gloom see if he will give you health for
[1:02:22] your sickness see if he will give you
[1:02:24] the Holy Ghost for your theology try it
[1:02:27] and see taste and see the Lord is good
[1:02:30] let's give him a chance
[1:02:34] Hallelujah
[1:02:36] he said see I don't want to just walk
[1:02:39] I want to walk closer to him
[1:02:43] he said while the Branham Tabernacle is
[1:02:46] having a Revival I want one myself
[1:02:50] amen I just wanted to happen in the
[1:02:52] building I don't want it to just happen
[1:02:54] in the building I want it to happen in
[1:02:56] me
[1:02:58] I want more of the Holy Spirit oh
[1:03:01] that's what the prophet of God said I
[1:03:03] want more of the holy spirit in me to
[1:03:05] reflect Christ in me I want to be like
[1:03:08] him I know that every true Christian
[1:03:10] wants to be like him that's my heart's
[1:03:12] desire to be like Jesus I want him as an
[1:03:16] example I want him I want to be as him
[1:03:19] the example of what I should be I'll
[1:03:21] take it'll take the Holy Ghost to do
[1:03:23] that that's the only thing that I'm not
[1:03:25] interested in seminaries I'm not
[1:03:27] interested in what somebody else got to
[1:03:28] tell me I don't care about kissing
[1:03:30] crucifixes or doing all that I want more
[1:03:33] of the Holy Spirit to take over William
[1:03:36] Branham
[1:03:39] well if he can have that desire we can
[1:03:41] have that desire
[1:03:44] I'm not interested in joining a greater
[1:03:46] Church than what I belong to
[1:03:48] I belong to the real Church of the
[1:03:50] Living God the firstborn I was born into
[1:03:52] it I want more of the holy ghost in my
[1:03:56] life to reflect Christ who I love I
[1:03:59] don't care what plane or level I have to
[1:04:01] come on to get it
[1:04:04] I don't care if I have to go here go
[1:04:07] there be called a fanatic a Holy Roller
[1:04:09] or whatever it may be I want more of his
[1:04:12] life to be reflected in me I'm not
[1:04:15] interested in the plane I have to come
[1:04:17] on
[1:04:21] in other words don't be satisfied with
[1:04:24] the plane you're on
[1:04:26] ain't talking about the one buzzing over
[1:04:27] I'm talking about the walk you're on
[1:04:30] and they don't you don't have a walk of
[1:04:31] satisfaction
[1:04:33] and I'm satisfied
[1:04:36] no we ought to be something wanting more
[1:04:40] I want more
[1:04:42] more than I had yesterday more than I
[1:04:45] had in the last meeting
[1:04:48] just think how great these meetings
[1:04:50] would be if you come to the next meeting
[1:04:52] with more
[1:04:55] than what you had the previous meeting
[1:04:59] and then we all have that same walk and
[1:05:01] we all get there and we come in with
[1:05:04] more
[1:05:07] when I get a taste of God when the Holy
[1:05:09] Spirit comes into the meeting that's
[1:05:11] good but I want more of it
[1:05:15] there's more of it or you wouldn't never
[1:05:17] have that desire for more of it
[1:05:20] because he promised it is every
[1:05:22] Redemptive blessing is ours you get what
[1:05:25] you're looking for
[1:05:27] you get what you're Desiring for If
[1:05:31] You're Expecting tonight to get healed
[1:05:33] you're going to get healed
[1:05:38] if you're not expecting it if you come
[1:05:40] to the meeting and say well I'll just
[1:05:41] see what goes on that's all you'll see
[1:05:44] is what's going on
[1:05:47] the devil will show you something
[1:05:51] that isn't right
[1:05:54] if you say I know that's not right the
[1:05:56] devil's going to make sure he shows you
[1:05:58] something that isn't right if you say
[1:06:00] Lord I believe you I want a blessing in
[1:06:02] my heart you'll get it just what you're
[1:06:04] expecting that's what you'll get always
[1:06:06] be expecting
[1:06:10] when you get up in the morning be
[1:06:12] expecting when you go to bed be
[1:06:15] expecting when you come to the house of
[1:06:17] God every service say God I want more of
[1:06:20] you
[1:06:20] [Applause]
[1:06:25] usually you get just what you expect
[1:06:30] if you come to the meeting or service
[1:06:32] and you say well I'm just going to go
[1:06:34] there tonight there's nothing to it
[1:06:35] that's what you're going to get out of
[1:06:37] it you'll get down there and say well
[1:06:39] I'll go down there there's no need of me
[1:06:40] going because I'm not going to get
[1:06:42] healed well that's just the way you'll
[1:06:43] go back but if you'll come expecting God
[1:06:46] to do something for you he'll do it if
[1:06:49] you expect to find something to
[1:06:51] criticize the meeting or criticize the
[1:06:53] way it's conducted Satan will show you
[1:06:56] plenty of it
[1:06:57] you'll find plenty but if you'll come
[1:07:00] not to criticize a meeting but you'll
[1:07:02] come and say God I want to see where you
[1:07:05] are in it
[1:07:08] I want to see where you are in it amen I
[1:07:11] want to see where you are God will show
[1:07:13] you himself in it
[1:07:17] just whatever you expect God will give
[1:07:20] it to you it's your expectancy now I
[1:07:22] want you to come tonight expecting to
[1:07:25] see God move in the greatest ways move
[1:07:28] since we've been here
[1:07:30] [Applause]
[1:07:32] what's wrong with that expectation every
[1:07:35] service
[1:07:36] [Applause]
[1:07:41] I had a man a preacher friend of mine
[1:07:43] that says well we can't just expect
[1:07:45] every service to be special meaning I
[1:07:47] say why not
[1:07:49] if you want to exp if you want to preach
[1:07:51] that expected expectancy that's what
[1:07:53] you're going to get
[1:07:56] but how come we can't expect God to move
[1:07:59] the greatest he's ever moved since he's
[1:08:01] been here since we've been here
[1:08:05] amen that's where that's where you know
[1:08:08] we wonder sometimes how come is it when
[1:08:10] you can come out some services and you
[1:08:12] sing one song and the place explodes you
[1:08:15] know why because people are expecting it
[1:08:18] they're they're they're longing for it
[1:08:20] they're look they woke up that morning
[1:08:22] maybe it was a song that hit him or or
[1:08:24] Bible verse that hit him it caused the
[1:08:25] desire and there's and then another one
[1:08:27] comes and it's got the same desire in a
[1:08:29] few and this fire begins to spread as
[1:08:31] the music begins to go and the song
[1:08:33] leader comes out he ain't hardly got to
[1:08:35] sing nothing
[1:08:36] and it just goes
[1:08:38] why it ain't because he done anything
[1:08:41] greater it's because you did it
[1:08:47] Hallelujah
[1:08:49] let's ask God not to leave one crippled
[1:08:52] person one blind person one deaf person
[1:08:56] one dumb person one sick person in our
[1:09:00] midst tonight let's believe it will you
[1:09:02] do that with me and I'll believe God
[1:09:04] will do it if we're expecting that right
[1:09:07] now
[1:09:11] Hallelujah
[1:09:15] why are you going to be taking a body
[1:09:18] change because you're expecting a body
[1:09:20] change
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:25] he said usually as we talk of expectancy
[1:09:28] well we think whatever we expect to do
[1:09:30] that's the way to be he said I'm
[1:09:32] expecting I got an engagement or
[1:09:33] appointment to meet you I expect you to
[1:09:35] be there I know one thing that we
[1:09:37] everyone today got an appointment that
[1:09:40] we're going to meet God somewhere
[1:09:41] sometime or another do you know that it
[1:09:44] was once appointed to man to die and
[1:09:46] after that the Judgment we're all going
[1:09:47] to meet that some men sins go before
[1:09:49] them if you confess them here some
[1:09:51] follow after so let's meet God now let's
[1:09:54] get the thing right now and then be
[1:09:56] expecting him when he comes in his glory
[1:09:58] and power for him to say it was well
[1:10:01] done my good and faithful servant enter
[1:10:03] into the joys of the Lord if you come
[1:10:06] with a kind of sarcastic criticism
[1:10:09] whatever you expect to see that's just
[1:10:12] what you'll see
[1:10:17] if you come expecting to be disappointed
[1:10:21] you will be disappointed
[1:10:26] you'll get what you expect
[1:10:29] if you come to receive you'll be
[1:10:32] expecting to receive and you shall
[1:10:35] receive just what you expected to
[1:10:37] receive
[1:10:39] so why not come with your cups up
[1:10:43] matter of fact I've been back Gathering

[1:10:51] him to fill them all
[1:10:54] Hallelujah I'm coming in to expect I'm
[1:10:57] coming to expect them to do more
[1:11:00] more listen we're not going down into a
[1:11:04] time of less healings less deliverances
[1:11:07] less promises being fulfilled we're
[1:11:09] going into a time of more
[1:11:12] more power more anointing more healings
[1:11:15] more deliverances
[1:11:18] until it becomes so much more until it

[1:13:31] ain't many tonight but many opossum
[1:13:33] Hunters I had an old dog once talking
[1:13:35] book about this tree everybody took him
[1:13:37] out the tree but he'd come and treat
[1:13:39] something it was a skunk and I'd get a
[1:13:41] skunk on the brush pile and a dog dog

[1:13:50] seek Him and he'd go get him the worst
[1:13:53] skunk I know of is the devil
[1:13:55] and he said a little amen a little while
[1:13:57] once in a while and a second that's what
[1:14:00] we need to do is seek the devil every
[1:14:03] service
[1:14:08] amen let's turn it a little bit not just

[1:14:41] will fulfill the desires of your heart
[1:14:49] Hallelujah
[1:14:51] being led by the spirit of God be

[1:16:11] the holy spirit will see to it
[1:16:15] you get what you're expecting so be
[1:16:17] expecting it
[1:16:18] but look at Mary when the Holy Ghost
[1:16:20] told her you're going to have a child
[1:16:21] knowing no man she didn't reason with it
[1:16:24] she just took him at his word and said
[1:16:25] there it is and she went around
[1:16:27] testifying I'm going to have a baby
[1:16:32] I'm going to have a baby I'm going to
[1:16:35] have a baby she didn't wait till she had
[1:16:38] a positive result she didn't wait till
[1:16:40] she had a kick she didn't wait till she
[1:16:42] had one sensation she said I'm going to
[1:16:44] have a baby she took God in his word she
[1:16:47] didn't wait excuse the expression you
[1:16:49] listened to a doctor I'm listening I'm
[1:16:51] your brother she didn't wait till she
[1:16:53] felt life she didn't wait till something
[1:16:54] took place she could see naturally she
[1:16:57] was going to be a mother she just took
[1:16:59] the Angel's word and when the Angels
[1:17:01] said you're going to do it she said
[1:17:02] behold the hands made of the Lord be it
[1:17:05] unto me according to Thy Word
[1:17:09] and she went around rejoicing I'm going
[1:17:12] to have a baby before she had one
[1:17:13] evidence the baby was coming
[1:17:17] outside of what the angel had spoke to
[1:17:19] her
[1:17:21] that's the only evidence she had
[1:17:23] she couldn't go even go back in the
[1:17:25] Bible and say hey
[1:17:27] here this happened before it had never
[1:17:28] happened before
[1:17:30] that a woman received a child without
[1:17:33] knowing a man
[1:17:36] amen Hannah couldn't look back and look
[1:17:39] at back and see it amen different others
[1:17:42] had an examples but she didn't have that
[1:17:44] example but she had the word of the
[1:17:46] Angel so she took him at his word and
[1:17:48] started expecting him to bring it to
[1:17:50] pass
[1:17:52] she took God his word started rejoicing
[1:17:54] saying God said so that settles it I'll
[1:17:57] Rejoice anyhow I don't have to feel
[1:17:59] nothing I don't have to have some
[1:18:01] sensation I just believe it anyhow
[1:18:04] oh you'll see an old-fashioned Revival
[1:18:06] sweep this country burning out sin and
[1:18:08] every church will fill up what a time
[1:18:10] it'll be of men and women will do just
[1:18:13] that
[1:18:14] take God in his word and be expecting
[1:18:17] him to do what he said he would do
[1:18:27] he said
[1:18:30] it was a little boy one time that would
[1:18:32] eat erasers off
[1:18:33] of bicycle tires because there was
[1:18:35] something lacking in his body he had a
[1:18:38] taste for it
[1:18:39] because there was a lack
[1:18:44] and he wanted more
[1:18:46] it's something called sulfur and they
[1:18:48] had but before he could have that desire
[1:18:50] that had to be something there to
[1:18:51] respond to that call
[1:18:54] or it wouldn't be a call there
[1:18:55] something's hungry got to be something
[1:18:57] to respond when our forefathers the
[1:19:00] pilgrims landed on here in Plymouth Rock
[1:19:01] they found the Indians they were
[1:19:03] worshiping the sun they were worshiping
[1:19:05] images sprinkling with blood dancing
[1:19:07] carrying on what was it it was a human
[1:19:09] being it was something in their heart to
[1:19:12] worship something
[1:19:13] they had knew there had to be a Creator
[1:19:15] there was a deep calling to the Deep if
[1:19:17] there's a deep call and there's got to
[1:19:18] be a deep to respond amen you remember
[1:19:21] not long ago before you received the
[1:19:22] Holy Spirit your heart burned for
[1:19:24] something it was something down deep I
[1:19:27] got to have something more I want more
[1:19:29] you come to church you joined it
[1:19:31] whatever but you've never been born
[1:19:32] again your heart called for what was it
[1:19:34] the deep that called it to the Deep
[1:19:36] there's got to be a deed to respond and
[1:19:38] tonight if you're craving healing God's
[1:19:41] Bible says us there something's in you
[1:19:43] telling you it's there and it sure is
[1:19:45] there something you craving for Divine
[1:19:47] Healing there's a fountain open
[1:19:48] somewhere
[1:19:50] Hallelujah there's a fountain open
[1:19:52] somewhere the same Holy Ghost they gave
[1:19:54] Simian the promise and led him to the
[1:19:56] Christ has led you here tonight has led
[1:20:00] you to the fountain or if you'll just
[1:20:02] see it and bathe in it and get more and
[1:20:05] more and more and more and more of it
[1:20:12] Simeon led by the Holy Spirit here he
[1:20:14] comes not knowing where he's going
[1:20:17] men who walk with God don't care where
[1:20:19] they're going as long as they're walking
[1:20:20] with him
[1:20:21] he walked into out into the building I
[1:20:24] could see this old sage as he's walking
[1:20:26] the holy spirit is leading him it was a
[1:20:29] deep calling he knew he had been
[1:20:31] promised he would see the Messiah before
[1:20:33] he would die and it was something in him
[1:20:35] looking for it and anticipation for it
[1:20:38] and wanting it and Desiring it it wasn't
[1:20:41] satisfied just sitting over in the
[1:20:42] corner somewhere but there was a pool
[1:20:44] that was going on he said Lord now has
[1:20:47] it come and he's seen this little baby
[1:20:48] he picks up this little bundle of love
[1:20:50] and he wrapped it in swallowing clothes
[1:20:51] pulled him up to his bosom tears running
[1:20:53] down his cheeks he said Lord now let
[1:20:56] your servant depart in peace according
[1:20:58] your word for my eyes of senior
[1:20:59] salvation the Holy Spirit was moving
[1:21:02] because he was expecting it
[1:21:06] he was expecting to see it and God led
[1:21:10] him to his full expectancy are you
[1:21:13] expecting him tonight
[1:21:15] if you are God will lead you to him
[1:21:21] same time there was this prophetess
[1:21:25] Anna was blind 80 years old stayed in
[1:21:28] the temple prayed day and night
[1:21:31] she too was looking for the consolation
[1:21:32] of Israel the coming of the Lord and
[1:21:34] here she sat in the corner blind the
[1:21:37] same time the holy spirit said rise up
[1:21:39] and here comes this old blind woman
[1:21:41] filling away her way to the crowd going
[1:21:43] to the great host of the temple till she
[1:21:45] got right to where he was and lifted up
[1:21:47] her hands and blessed God if the Holy
[1:21:49] Ghost could lead that Brian prophetess
[1:21:51] because she was expecting to see the
[1:21:53] Lord Jesus when he comes and he could
[1:21:55] leave he can also lead you to The
[1:21:57] Fountains of His blessings and Grace
[1:21:58] just be expecting it looking forward to
[1:22:02] it it's here God said it is he's moving
[1:22:04] by his Spirit moving all over the Earth
[1:22:07] signs and wonders when God moves say
[1:22:10] move oh Lord on me
[1:22:12] move on Lord on me
[1:22:19] everywhere God moves anytime Through the
[1:22:21] Bible you will see healings
[1:22:23] miracles signs and wonders
[1:22:32] I like how he said this because it it's
[1:22:34] it the devil takes that black line of
[1:22:37] family issues and wants to follow you
[1:22:39] listen to what he said he leaves a track
[1:22:41] behind him of the supernatural
[1:22:49] foreign
[1:22:51] God has a track record
[1:22:56] he leaves a track behind him of the
[1:22:59] supernatural I don't care what
[1:23:01] theologians say the Bible is right when
[1:23:04] God moves the world shakes and when he
[1:23:07] moves at every Revival they've ever had
[1:23:09] at Luther's day Wesley's day days of
[1:23:11] Calvin Knox Finley and saying all the
[1:23:13] way down through and today he's no less
[1:23:16] than he was then if anything he's
[1:23:18] greater today than he was then
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:21] [Applause]
[1:23:26] what a mighty God we serve
[1:23:30] what a great God we serve
[1:23:33] what a what a wonderful God we serve
[1:23:39] over there and go get my phone
[1:23:46] be expecting it
[1:23:49] now what if you're sitting here
[1:23:53] he
[1:23:55] let me go back for a minute I missed
[1:23:56] something he leaves a track behind him
[1:23:58] of the supernatural why did you come
[1:24:00] here tonight
[1:24:03] did you come to get healed did you come
[1:24:04] to see him did you come what'd you come
[1:24:07] for
[1:24:08] he said here not long ago I was over in
[1:24:09] Dallas Texas started back home an
[1:24:11] airplane got caught in a storm we had to
[1:24:14] come down to Memphis and Memphis
[1:24:15] Tennessee put me up in that famous hotel
[1:24:17] the Peabody

[1:24:20] own money but they put me up there
[1:24:22] and I'm wondering what's going on he
[1:24:24] said why was I there he said because of
[1:24:26] a little woman's expectancy

[1:27:08] he said let me tell you what I expect
[1:27:11] I expect the church to be on fire
[1:27:16] I expect the glory of the Lord to be
[1:27:19] falling everywhere centers around the
[1:27:21] altar people getting saved and filled
[1:27:24] with the Holy Ghost that's just a great
[1:27:26] thing my expectation and anticipation is
[1:27:30] built way up high
[1:27:33] well if he had these expectations why
[1:27:37] does the bride of Christ have anything
[1:27:38] different
[1:27:41] they don't expect doctors to be filled
[1:27:43] no more that's why they closed them and
[1:27:45] put them in the basement they don't
[1:27:47] expect anybody to be healed of prayer
[1:27:48] line that's why they don't have them no
[1:27:50] more but I still expect God to move how
[1:27:54] he wants to move
[1:27:57] foreign
[1:28:05] I'm going to ask this right now how many
[1:28:08] how many experienced God at this altar
[1:28:11] this weekend
[1:28:12] I want you to raise your hands if you
[1:28:14] get I need you to stand on your feet
[1:28:16] raise your hands because I want the
[1:28:18] whole world to know God still deals in
[1:28:20] an altar
[1:28:23] all right I'll let you be seated how
[1:28:26] many God what you was expecting through
[1:28:28] a prayer line I want you to stand and
[1:28:31] wave and let the whole world know
[1:28:33] [Applause]
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:40] all right
[1:28:41] Hallelujah he's still the same yesterday
[1:28:44] and a day and forever this should be the
[1:28:47] bride's expectation
[1:28:53] man wants to put God In The Box and he
[1:28:55] only operates the way they want him to
[1:28:57] you're limiting God by limiting your
[1:28:59] expectations
[1:29:02] I'm expecting something to happen
[1:29:07] Hallelujah
[1:29:14] he said I believe
[1:29:17] he said let me go back
[1:29:19] he said I want to speak on the subject
[1:29:21] to kind of build up Faith
[1:29:24] you got to
[1:29:25] build your faith up
[1:29:27] if there's ministers here in which
[1:29:29] there's no doubt there is knows that
[1:29:31] when you're speaking to people you have
[1:29:33] to have an atmosphere of preaching for
[1:29:36] salvation then you want to make that
[1:29:39] call for it then if you want the
[1:29:41] atmosphere of healing you get the
[1:29:42] anointing you get the anointing Yourself
[1:29:44] by the word of God and deliver it to the
[1:29:47] people and that puts the whole group in
[1:29:50] the anointing for a certain thing under
[1:29:52] expectations of certain things we're
[1:29:54] expecting something he said you know I
[1:29:56] believe then to bring that little higher
[1:29:58] that God's got to all all of his church
[1:30:01] now the called out remnant of his church
[1:30:03] under expectations of his coming
[1:30:08] you see I remember at the gate and it's
[1:30:10] coming there must have been tremendous
[1:30:12] Good Friday when they knew he was coming
[1:30:13] to the feast and expectation many of
[1:30:15] them were expecting them to be there to
[1:30:17] see him some kind of Miracle he
[1:30:18] performed others wanted to see him
[1:30:20] others there to make fun of him and it
[1:30:22] was kind of a different Passover than
[1:30:24] been for a long time when he wrote to
[1:30:25] the city let's be expecting him to come
[1:30:29] take us home
[1:30:37] Hallelujah let's be expecting him to
[1:30:40] come take us home
[1:30:48] but God
[1:30:49] is moving again in his people
[1:30:54] I got a testimony I got to read
[1:30:59] here tonight if I can find it right
[1:31:01] quick
[1:31:03] we know the
[1:31:04] Belgium Group that came brother Joshua
[1:31:08] his brother Isaiah and his wife brother
[1:31:10] Isaiah's wife Julie
[1:31:15] they had come with expectations
[1:31:19] but God did exceedingly above what they
[1:31:21] even expected see if you can get your
[1:31:24] expectations high God will always move
[1:31:27] higher
[1:31:28] because he does exceedingly above
[1:31:32] what you can expect
[1:31:36] so people say I ain't seen a miracle
[1:31:37] because they hadn't had their
[1:31:38] expectations High Enough
[1:31:47] she said I based this sister Julie now
[1:31:49] brother Isaiah was saved Lord got a hold
[1:31:52] of him there in Europe back in the end
[1:31:54] of as 2019 was turn it over into 220 me
[1:31:58] and brother Danny stayman was their
[1:31:59] Minister and at a youth conference for
[1:32:02] Brother David Iverson
[1:32:04] and the Lord had dealt with me to preach
[1:32:06] on born of the fire
[1:32:08] and I was preaching about the seeds that
[1:32:10] was in the Giants uh the giant trees
[1:32:14] they're in California how they'd fall to
[1:32:16] the ground but they cannot come to
[1:32:18] fruition unless they burnt over with
[1:32:21] fire
[1:32:22] and how that man has has regulated the
[1:32:25] fire and to try to keep from getting the
[1:32:27] old trees burned up they've they've
[1:32:29] regulated the fire into where now
[1:32:31] they're actually having even issues and
[1:32:33] things because of man-made regulations
[1:32:36] so you could tell where all that was
[1:32:37] going
[1:32:39] and here we were ministering there and
[1:32:42] I was
[1:32:43] coming down to the end of it and the
[1:32:45] altar it filled up there was actually
[1:32:47] tongues in Prophecy that went forth
[1:32:50] and
[1:32:51] um
[1:32:52] brother brother David Mayer started
[1:32:54] praying for this young man I didn't know
[1:32:56] who he was had no idea
[1:32:58] and but I was expecting God to do
[1:33:00] something because he just had spoke to
[1:33:02] me about him so I went down there and
[1:33:04] began to pray with Brother David and
[1:33:06] David Mayer was he knew the Brethren is
[1:33:09] raised up together
[1:33:10] and uh been in been in some false
[1:33:12] doctrines and Brother David of course
[1:33:14] come out of it and this young man had
[1:33:16] gotten really wounded in that false
[1:33:18] Doctrine
[1:33:19] and um so anyway he'd but his his dad
[1:33:23] had spoke to brother Ron about it and
[1:33:25] brother Ron had spoke to him a few
[1:33:26] things so here we are and we're and I
[1:33:28] began to pray and all of a sudden this
[1:33:30] man's hands went up
[1:33:32] and he just began to scream to the top
[1:33:34] of his lungs
[1:33:36] and just shout the glories of God and
[1:33:38] the place begins to erupt and things
[1:33:40] begin to take place
[1:33:42] and still I'm not catching this because
[1:33:45] God goes above your expectations
[1:33:48] and uh and so he told me later he said
[1:33:52] you know I I the reason he said I I
[1:33:54] couldn't contain myself no more he said
[1:33:56] because I actually heard what sounded
[1:33:59] like another Realm and he said such
[1:34:02] beautiful voices of singing like I
[1:34:03] thought wow these people are singing
[1:34:05] amazing and it's just pouring into him
[1:34:07] and he just begins to enter into that
[1:34:09] and Shout
[1:34:10] and he actually goes back and if I
[1:34:12] understand right he goes back and
[1:34:13] realizes it wasn't really even singing
[1:34:16] going on in that moment
[1:34:18] there's rejoicing in the presence of
[1:34:20] angels
[1:34:22] his dad had went on just a few months
[1:34:24] before that and his desire was to see
[1:34:26] Isaiah and his family saved and and God
[1:34:29] got a hold of him there and just a few
[1:34:31] weeks later his wife would come to the
[1:34:33] Lord and and God would save her but I
[1:34:37] want to read you her testimony she said
[1:34:38] I basically can't possibly put into
[1:34:40] words what we experienced and felt in
[1:34:44] those Services there in Louisiana but
[1:34:45] I'm going to try anyway
[1:34:47] the presence of the Lord in the Eden
[1:34:49] light Tabernacle was simply like no
[1:34:51] other I've ever experienced before
[1:34:53] it really made me very quiet that week
[1:34:56] speechless with moments to be very
[1:34:59] honest
[1:35:00] speechless in moments to be very honest
[1:35:02] the Lord is doing great things for his
[1:35:04] children as much as I realize that I
[1:35:06] don't deserve it all but I know for sure
[1:35:08] now I'm his
[1:35:11] how did I ever get to these meetings in
[1:35:13] Louisiana because oh if you would have
[1:35:15] told me this 10 years ago but the Lord
[1:35:18] knows and knows I realize even more now
[1:35:21] that we're simply fulfilling the vision
[1:35:23] as brother coffee preached in our church
[1:35:25] a while back I had to be there
[1:35:26] everything has a greater purpose for the
[1:35:29] Lord otherwise I and I'm very I'm sure
[1:35:31] many others with me wouldn't be writing
[1:35:33] down our experiences right now I really
[1:35:35] wanted to be in those meetings
[1:35:37] Isaiah has been following them for a
[1:35:40] long time and they had also attracted my
[1:35:42] attention more and more throughout the
[1:35:43] few last few years
[1:35:45] when I was very but I was very excited
[1:35:46] about the Jubilee Service as I was
[1:35:48] streamed from Cloverdale bibleway and he
[1:35:51] asked me if I would like to join him at
[1:35:52] the meetings in Louisiana this year and
[1:35:54] even though I never thought of going in
[1:35:56] advance here we are
[1:35:58] we were there an old
[1:36:00] and I can tell you I was full of
[1:36:03] anticipation
[1:36:04] not only did I crave for the spiritual
[1:36:06] food but I was looking for more more of
[1:36:10] him
[1:36:11] the first service of Wednesday evening
[1:36:13] was powerful the sermon did not miss its
[1:36:15] effect on me and certainly not when
[1:36:17] brother Andrew spoke the words and the
[1:36:20] author flips the script because yes that
[1:36:22] is exactly what he did in our lives and
[1:36:25] that was just a start the next evening I
[1:36:27] was even under more anticipation brother
[1:36:29] Ron Spencer spoke for me that man is a
[1:36:32] miracle in his own right I remember my
[1:36:35] heart was about to explode when I
[1:36:36] entered the room that night and the
[1:36:38] prediction or the
[1:36:40] prededication itself was again a true
[1:36:44] blessing
[1:36:45] the message itself is a translated the
[1:36:47] message itself is again a true blessing
[1:36:49] let's finish this
[1:36:51] toward the end pour your spirit out
[1:36:53] sound it out through the room like many
[1:36:54] others I stepped forward and I raised my
[1:36:57] hand to the Lord Brother Ron began to
[1:36:58] pray in the presence of the Lord and the
[1:37:00] Tabernacle was so intense I could feel
[1:37:03] it about my head and started praying
[1:37:05] myself I prayed Lord I know and feel
[1:37:07] that you are here I know I'm in these
[1:37:09] meetings for a reason please give me
[1:37:10] something personal Lord something that
[1:37:13] is for me that I know that I'm in the
[1:37:15] right place you know my heart and I need
[1:37:17] this confirmation I need more from you
[1:37:21] I converted a while ago and also most
[1:37:24] people know that and I had an experience
[1:37:26] at home before but given my past and the
[1:37:28] doubt Satan plants in my head every day
[1:37:30] I just had to know that there was
[1:37:32] nothing left that stood between me and
[1:37:34] him and that I was okay so I got very
[1:37:37] serious as I prayed and I beg please
[1:37:39] give me something something tangible
[1:37:41] Lord so I just know forever and suddenly
[1:37:44] I felt a hand on my shoulder I stiffened
[1:37:48] I can't describe it but every muscle in
[1:37:49] my body cramped a feeling of fear
[1:37:52] overtook me at first and I tried to turn
[1:37:54] around after a short while I could
[1:37:56] remember but I just couldn't turn I did
[1:37:59] feel that grip remained completely the
[1:38:01] same and so did the pressure I would I
[1:38:03] would could collapse because the
[1:38:05] emotions afterwards and I literally
[1:38:07] can't put in the words what was going on
[1:38:08] inside of me at that moment I told
[1:38:10] myself I had to put myself in my many
[1:38:12] other thoughts together my thoughts
[1:38:14] together again and afterwards I would
[1:38:16] become enraptured and saying like
[1:38:17] personally never had I hadn't saying
[1:38:20] before even though I no longer lived in
[1:38:22] sin we still make mistakes I think and
[1:38:24] Satan also was always trying read it in
[1:38:27] my head to sow new doubts this was the
[1:38:29] moment for me the Breakthrough that deep
[1:38:32] down I craved so much and what can I say
[1:38:35] he knew and he knew exactly what I
[1:38:37] needed after the service I was
[1:38:39] completely speechless sincerely silent I
[1:38:42] did not dare to share it at first so I
[1:38:44] laid awake all night but my heart was
[1:38:46] overflowing so how can you not share
[1:38:48] what the Lord has done for you I told my
[1:38:50] husband Isaiah and sister Bethany Dexter
[1:38:52] the next day about my experience and we
[1:38:54] shared it with brother Ron two days
[1:38:55] later brother Ron also knew that that
[1:38:58] same Thursday evening another sister
[1:39:00] from the audience had seen the angel
[1:39:01] Lord coming through the door I just
[1:39:03] can't help myself but say hallelujah
[1:39:06] praise the Lord he knows exactly what
[1:39:09] he's doing and he always answers every
[1:39:10] prayer besides his personal experience I
[1:39:13] had and I'm so so thankful for that
[1:39:15] there were honestly many more things
[1:39:17] that touched me deeply during these four
[1:39:19] days of meetings it still makes me
[1:39:21] emotional with moments these meetings
[1:39:23] were a life-changing experience for me
[1:39:25] was very powerful and clear message and
[1:39:28] I can only exclaim I take it all Lord I
[1:39:31] want to stay in his presence forever my
[1:39:34] heart only wants more
[1:39:37] foreign
