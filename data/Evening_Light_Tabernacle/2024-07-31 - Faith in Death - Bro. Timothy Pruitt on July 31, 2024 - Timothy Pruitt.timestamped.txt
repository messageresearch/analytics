[4:58] uh man
[5:00] maybe maybe do things a little
[5:02] differently like brother Jackson Burns
[5:04] told me one time I'm a wild card and
[5:07] we'll do things a little bit differently
[5:08] tonight but you know I'm sure all of you
[5:12] have heard by now of the passing of
[5:14] brother Tony Adams and certainly been
[5:18] heavy on our hearts and brother Tony was
[5:22] a very dear dear brother and we don't
[5:25] weep as those that have no hope but
[5:30] it does leave a hole and it leaves a
[5:31] void and I think one of the first things
[5:35] I thought of was just wish I would have
[5:37] been able to hug his neck one more
[5:39] time and we have that time tonight so
[5:42] we're going to do things a little bit
[5:44] differently if you have somebody on your
[5:45] heart it doesn't matter if you're
[5:46] running the video playing music if you
[5:49] just want to take a few moments we often
[5:51] say turn around and greet your neighbor
[5:53] but out of just some sincerity if you
[5:55] just want to go to somebody tonight just
[5:56] shake their hand tell them how much you
[5:58] appreciate them how much you love them
[6:00] why don't we just take a couple of
[6:01] minutes at the beginning of the service
[6:03] just to Fellowship one with another

[35:04] things I was looking at today or this
[35:06] week earlier this week but in light of
[35:09] what has happened and then today some
[35:11] other thoughts begin begin to think on
[35:13] things and amen the uh seriousness of
[35:18] life these things begin to well up
[35:21] inside of me so I just like to share
[35:23] some things as as we go into this Psalms
[35:26] 23 and verse one it says the Lord is my
[35:29] shepherd and I shall not want he maketh
[35:32] me to lie down in Green
[35:35] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[35:37] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me
[35:41] in the paths of righteousness for his
[35:43] name sake yeay though I walk through the
[35:46] valley of the shadow of death I will
[35:48] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[35:52] rod and thy staff they comfort me and
[35:55] thou preparest a table before me in the
[35:57] presence of my enemies thou anointest my
[36:00] head with oil my cup runneth over surely
[36:03] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[36:05] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[36:08] the house of the Lord forever amen God
[36:11] bless you you can be
[36:14] seated I'd like to speak to you tonight
[36:16] on faith and
[36:19] death brother brandom mentions this
[36:22] passage of scripture and I want to just
[36:24] key in on Psalms 23 and verse4
[36:28] yay though I walk through the valley of
[36:30] the shadow of death he says many times
[36:33] I've heard people quoting the 23rd psalm
[36:36] and saying though I walk through the
[36:38] Dark Shadows of the Valley of Death he
[36:41] said if you'll notice it isn't the Dark
[36:43] Shadows is the shadow dark isn't in it
[36:48] the shadow of the valley of death now it
[36:51] could not be dark and yet have a shadow
[36:53] for there has to be a certain percentage
[36:55] of light before there can be a shadow
[36:58] if it's perfectly dark there would be no
[37:00] shadow in it I I can test to that I was
[37:04] in a cave one time and very dark and
[37:06] they turned off the lights there was
[37:07] nothing but Blackness there wasn't a
[37:09] shadow there wasn't a hint of a shadow
[37:11] was nothing but Darkness so if it's
[37:13] perfectly dark there's no shadow in it
[37:16] so yay though I walk through the shadow
[37:18] of the valley of death now there has to
[37:21] be enough light to make a Shadow if it
[37:24] was dark my shadow would not be on this
[37:26] pull pit but being there's a light then
[37:28] it makes a shadow so the death so death
[37:31] is dark in a certain way but it's only a
[37:35] shadow the Valley of the shadow of death
[37:38] there has to be a certain amount of
[37:39] light in death to make a Shadow aren't
[37:41] you happy to that that's so that there's
[37:43] light in the valley amen that's the key
[37:46] to the whole thing there's light in the
[37:48] valley sometime so he says someday we're
[37:50] all coming down to that way friends
[37:53] every one of us are on our road there
[37:55] tonight each time our heart beats is one
[37:57] last time that it'll ever beat again
[38:00] it's just got so many beats as it goes
[38:02] to make this journey it'll make his last
[38:04] beat one of these days so then we got to
[38:07] go down through that shadow of death but
[38:09] we're happy that we have been promised
[38:12] that the Morning Star will meet us there
[38:15] to light up that Valley amen and give us
[38:18] light to cross that River amen and I I'm
[38:21] thankful for that because you know death
[38:23] is it it looks like a a great dark thing
[38:26] and surely it is a veil that is there
[38:28] and and honestly if death wasn't there
[38:30] in the darkness of
[38:32] death we would do everything we could to
[38:35] go over on the other side but there's
[38:37] that thing called Death that is is dark
[38:39] and it's it's scary at times but to a
[38:42] Believer we're not afraid of death
[38:44] because our God has already conquered it
[38:46] he's already came down and gave his life
[38:49] and and showed us that death now no
[38:51] longer has any sting it has no longer
[38:53] any Victory am man he brought death back
[38:56] to life again again and it showed that
[38:58] he has the power of resurrection and but
[39:01] I want to just kind of go down this
[39:02] thought and for a moment says we're
[39:04] mindful of someday when death is going
[39:06] to chill our bodies maybe tonight we're
[39:09] if we're not prepared maybe we're
[39:11] prepared maybe we'll go ahead and
[39:12] prepare to meet that hour when death
[39:15] comes to our room to take us from this
[39:17] life to the one that is beyond maybe we
[39:20] can come to it with
[39:23] joy come on now not with sadness but
[39:26] with joy and faith knowing that we know
[39:29] him who said I am the resurrection and
[39:33] the life amen so a Believer does not
[39:35] come to death and sadness but he comes
[39:38] to death and joy knowing when his last
[39:40] breath is out of this body amen he's
[39:43] entered into a place that we can't
[39:45] hardly describe with human tongue or
[39:47] human intellect amen the Bible says
[39:49] words cannot even say what a Waits we
[39:51] can we we don't we don't have the
[39:53] abilities to be able to speak about what
[39:56] it's like and the body that away you
[39:57] know I thought about I've been thinking
[39:59] about that today as we know brother Tony
[40:01] took his last breath there out there on
[40:03] on a job and and just that last moment
[40:07] coming from breathing this breath and
[40:09] then stepping from this moment in this
[40:11] Mortal body and a in a body that was 55
[40:15] and speaking to his wife he had the
[40:16] normal aches and pains and things that
[40:18] he was going through but he fell there
[40:20] upon the ground breathing that last
[40:23] breath but his next breath was in a body
[40:26] that knew no pain it was in a body that
[40:28] knew no sin brother Tony at one time had
[40:31] sin in his life and lived a very sinful
[40:33] life and God came on the scene and moved
[40:36] in him but he moved into a place he knew
[40:38] no more sin any longer there there was
[40:40] no more fear any longer there was no
[40:42] more worry no more dread and then I
[40:45] believe that's how we should all look at
[40:47] this as we don't come to this place with
[40:49] with sorrow as those who have no hope
[40:52] but we have a hope that's beyond the
[40:54] grave amen we're not planting the seed
[40:56] this week of brother Tony's body Amen in
[40:59] the grave mour and never to see him
[41:01] again never to know what is what happens
[41:03] never but we know as we plant that seed
[41:06] that seed has a promise upon it that
[41:08] that seed is going to come back to life
[41:11] again because he is the resurrection of
[41:13] the life but you know God knowing and
[41:15] seeing how fragile we
[41:18] are we're very fragile you know you you
[41:21] say well I'm just I'm a teenager I I got
[41:23] big I'm working on my muscles but you're
[41:25] still a very fragile person
[41:27] where humanity is fragile human bodies
[41:30] are fragile knowing that what we're
[41:33] walking while we're walking on this
[41:35] brittle thread of life I like how
[41:38] brother Bram describes that he said
[41:39] we're fragile bodies walking on a
[41:42] brittle thread of life this Mortal life
[41:45] not knowing what time we're going to be
[41:47] summoned to answer on high let us oh
[41:50] Lord lay aside everything in our
[41:54] hearts and that's what you know I think
[41:56] it ought to call us all to a moment cuz
[41:59] never none of us know what our time will
[42:01] be we don't know sure we all have faith
[42:03] to believe that we're going to see a
[42:04] about body change and we're going to be
[42:06] one of those that are alive and remain
[42:08] but we don't know what God has chosen
[42:10] for us but we want to be living our life
[42:13] not carrying around bitterness and fears
[42:16] and and and complexes and things that
[42:18] has no value and allowing them to weigh
[42:20] us down and tear us down and not be
[42:23] ready for that moment when we meet our
[42:25] Lord that moment when we draw our last
[42:28] breath James 4: 13 says like this he
[42:32] says go to now ye that say today or
[42:35] tomorrow we will go into such a city and
[42:38] continue There year and buy and sell and
[42:40] get gain whereas you know not what shall
[42:44] be on the tomorrow for what is your life
[42:47] it is even a vapor that appear for a
[42:50] little time and then vanish away for
[42:53] that you ought to say if the Lord will
[42:56] we shall live and do this or that amen
[42:59] if the Lord will that's where we get it
[43:01] Lord willing Lord willing I'll be there
[43:03] amen it comes from this scripture if the
[43:05] Lord will we're going to do that because
[43:08] if he's not willing we're not going to
[43:10] do that amen but if the Lord willing it
[43:13] for us to be there to do this or to do
[43:15] that because we know amen any moment we
[43:18] could draw our last breath any moment we
[43:21] could say our last words and thinking on
[43:23] that thought what would we want our last
[43:25] words to be come on
[43:28] amen I know it's a very serious moment
[43:30] and it's very serious kind of checking
[43:32] up for a moment because you know brother
[43:34] I I would hope it would be said about me
[43:36] that that morning I ate my breakfast and
[43:39] I read this and I read the Bible and I
[43:40] talked about the Lord and I prayed for
[43:42] this one that one amen I wouldn't want
[43:44] it to be that my last breath was a word
[43:46] to my wife that we is in a you know in a
[43:49] bad disagreement or fussing at my
[43:51] children or this that and the other amen
[43:53] we got to be very careful because we
[43:55] don't know the moment God's going to
[43:57] call us
[43:58] home amen so you know it's just like I
[44:01] heard this story this man that was was
[44:04] on his way to town and it was back
[44:05] before cars and he was walking into the
[44:07] town and he come by his friend's house
[44:09] and and his friend says where you going
[44:11] he said I'm going to town he says you
[44:13] mean you're going to the town Lord
[44:15] willing he said I don't care if the
[44:16] Lord's willing or not I'm going to town
[44:18] so along the way he gets down and waves
[44:20] a little bit and he gets he gets he gets
[44:23] beat by some robbers jumps out of the
[44:24] bushes and they beat him half to death
[44:27] and they take everything that he has and
[44:29] he comes back across in front of the
[44:31] neighbor's house and he's dragging one
[44:32] leg and he's all tore to pieces and
[44:34] neighbor sitting there said where you
[44:36] going he said I'm going to the house
[44:38] Lord
[44:40] willing amen we don't know what the Lord
[44:43] Wills but we want to be in his will amen
[44:46] we want him to be directing our lives
[44:48] and and and and directing us our every
[44:50] moment he says it just goes to show that
[44:53] we are here today and tomorrow we're not
[44:56] here we don't know when when the time
[44:57] comes when it's coming but we know it's
[45:00] coming and he said I was thinking about
[45:02] this life is a great thing life is an
[45:06] opportunity yes sir amen it's an
[45:09] opportunity to live the best life and
[45:11] what is the best life it's not millions
[45:13] of dollars in the bank and vacation
[45:15] after vacation and this that oh that's
[45:17] the life no the best life the
[45:20] opportunity that we have is to live a
[45:22] life for Jesus Christ amen to live for
[45:25] him with everything that we have every
[45:28] moment every moment of Our Lives ought
[45:30] to be centered around the Lord Jesus
[45:32] Christ and I believe it's a call in our
[45:34] church and as we face this moment to say
[45:37] Lord if there's something in me that I
[45:39] can tighten up let me tighten it up if
[45:41] it's in your will for me to do this let
[45:43] me do it Lord willing amen that you will
[45:46] guide every part of my life and I will
[45:48] allow you to guide every part of my
[45:52] life because we want to be one of those
[45:54] that have a testimony as we have went
[45:56] through some of the people of Faith
[45:58] there the Believers of faith in Hebrews
[46:00] chap 11 amen it brings it all the way
[46:03] down to Hebrews chap 11 and verse 13 it
[46:05] says these all died in
[46:09] faith see I'll probably ever say it
[46:12] again but I'll say it now death that we
[46:15] have had had to this week is not a new
[46:18] thing it's been going on since the fall
[46:21] as we know death there's not a man yet
[46:24] other than our Lord Jesus Christ and he
[46:26] I and a few others but all the others
[46:30] had to go through
[46:31] death amen they had to come to this
[46:34] place they had to had to have that
[46:36] Reckoning in their life to come to this
[46:39] moment and I want to be have a testimony
[46:41] if God chooses to take me Amen on this
[46:44] side of it without before the Rapture I
[46:46] want to have the testimony that I died
[46:49] in
[46:50] faith amen not having and they they died
[46:53] in faith not having received the
[46:54] promises but having seen them far off
[46:57] and were persuaded of them embrac them
[47:00] and confess that they were strangers and
[47:02] pilgrims on the earth for they that say
[47:05] such thing declare plainly that they
[47:07] seek a country and truly if they had
[47:09] been mindful of that country from which
[47:11] they come out they may have had
[47:13] opportunity to return but now they
[47:15] desire a better
[47:19] country come on now this is what he's
[47:21] talking about Abraham Abraham left a
[47:23] country and if his desires were still
[47:26] for that country he would have had an
[47:27] opportunity to go back that's right amen
[47:31] you know this is the world that we're
[47:32] living in Satan wants us so so driven by
[47:36] this world and the things of this world
[47:38] and if you have your mind and your
[47:40] desires upon it you will have an
[47:42] opportunity to go back but if your
[47:45] desires is on a better
[47:48] country I believe we live as far as
[47:50] human beings in one of the greatest
[47:52] countries that's ever been on the face
[47:54] of the Earth amen the freedoms we enjoy
[47:56] but I'm I'm telling you there's a better
[47:58] country that's right there's a better
[48:00] land there's a place of real Freedom
[48:03] there's a place of real joy as a place
[48:05] of real
[48:09] happiness a better country that is a
[48:13] Heavenly country wherefore God is not
[48:16] ashamed to be called their God for he
[48:18] hath prepared for them a city amen I I
[48:22] want to be a prepared people for a
[48:24] prepared place yes sir this is what he
[48:27] said in John 14 and verse one he says
[48:30] let not your heart be troubled you
[48:33] believe in God believe also in me in my
[48:36] father's house are many mansions and and
[48:39] you know I know the world gets that idea
[48:40] of mansions that it's gold doorknobs and
[48:43] and big buildings and big structures and
[48:45] stuff but the Mansion he's not speaking
[48:47] about is not a mansion a building it's
[48:50] talking about a mansion a
[48:52] body I believe I got a mansion that's
[48:54] about this tall

[49:00] 5 foot tall but God wants you to be 4ot
[49:02] tall amen he he got you a body somewhere
[49:06] amen it's so he said I'm going to go
[49:08] prepare a place and and I think think
[49:11] about that brother Tony left here but
[49:13] God had already prepared him a
[49:17] place god listen it may have shocked us
[49:20] but this did not Shock
[49:22] God it may have astounded us when we got
[49:26] the new news and how this happen or what
[49:28] going on what's going you know things
[49:30] turned upside down real quickly but God
[49:32] was never shocked he saw it coming he
[49:35] knew the moment it was going to take
[49:37] place and he already prepared him a body
[49:41] he already prepared him a place and this
[49:43] is why he said let not your heart be
[49:45] troubled I'm going to prepare you place

[50:07] little bit
[50:10] jealous amen because the things that

[51:43] body pass away we have an immortal body
[51:46] that is prepared for us that we can step
[51:49] into and never go back to sin again
[51:52] never go back to fear again never go
[51:55] have another mind battle again never get
[51:57] sick
[51:57] [Applause]
[52:00] again it's not a
[52:03] myth it's a
[52:06] reality he said in Romans 8 and verse 28
[52:09] it's been quoted already we know that
[52:11] all
[52:12] things work
[52:15] together all
[52:18] things sicknesses that that goes in all
[52:21] things
[52:23] right trials that goes in all things
[52:27] problems that we face yeah that's in all
[52:29] things all is a pretty powerful
[52:32] three-letter word I said it before but
[52:34] it's amazing how how how it encompasses
[52:37] so much three letters all things work
[52:42] together for the good to them that love
[52:45] God to them that are the called
[52:48] according to his
[52:52] purpose death is in all things
[52:57] sure we can't see it that for our own
[52:59] good sometimes and we wonder well did I
[53:01] have faith or did I did did I did I hold
[53:06] did did did I did I pray right did I did
[53:08] I have something wrong somewhere what
[53:10] happened all
[53:13] things I I'm here to say one thing the
[53:16] devil is not greater than
[53:18] God the devil can't touch a hair of our
[53:21] head unless God allows it to happen
[53:27] brother Brandon was dealing with this
[53:28] with a little mother that her baby had
[53:30] died in Germany and her husband was a a
[53:33] a
[53:34] Chaplin and he he could he couldn't get
[53:36] there very quickly but they called him
[53:39] and and asked him to come and and she
[53:42] was declaring I know and they were
[53:44] declaring I know that God's going to
[53:46] raise up my little baby and called
[53:48] brother brother brandom said you know
[53:50] pray for him I know God's going to raise
[53:52] it up he said well let me go pray and I
[53:55] went and prayed prayed all that
[53:57] afternoon that
[53:58] night he said sometimes you think don't
[54:00] doctors don't believe but he said let me
[54:02] show you he said you know she she had
[54:04] already give the doctor my book to read
[54:06] that's called the Propet visits South
[54:08] Africa or visits Africa something like
[54:10] that and she said God will raise my baby
[54:13] up God will raise my baby up and that
[54:15] was their confession and the baby had
[54:17] been dead now four or five hours or so
[54:19] and they got word to the father down at
[54:22] the base where he was stationed he had
[54:24] to fly in and baby had been dead died in
[54:26] the night and the doctor said all right
[54:29] you believe said all right I tell you
[54:30] what I'll do I'll slip over and turn the
[54:32] oxygen back
[54:35] on and he let that baby lay there for
[54:38] two days with oxygen turned on
[54:40] waiting and I was over here praying and
[54:43] they was going to fly me across in the
[54:44] Jet and I could leave here in an army
[54:46] jet and be back the same day to Germany
[54:49] one one morning about daylight I got up
[54:51] and my wife went out of the room and
[54:52] when she went out I just waking up and I
[54:54] was laying there for a little bit and
[54:56] something came into the room I looked up
[54:58] there something moving and I jumped up
[55:00] and I said Lord what would you have your
[55:02] servant
[55:03] know and a voice spoke and saido not
[55:06] rebuke that that's the hand of the
[55:10] Lord so I got her on the phone I said no
[55:14] God has called your baby
[55:16] home and when she come over to see
[55:19] us said what was it brother brandom was
[55:23] my faith
[55:25] weak I thought thought I had
[55:27] faith I said you had great faith you
[55:30] prayed for your baby and your husband
[55:33] prayed for your baby you held on to God
[55:35] to raise that baby but he refused to do
[55:37] it because he knows what is
[55:43] best he knows what is best and still you
[55:48] love him
[55:50] anyway Hallelujah that's real
[55:54] faith that when God said say no y you
[55:58] still love him yes amen this is where
[56:02] brother brandom even came to in his own
[56:04] in his own life with his baby Sharon
[56:06] Rose and his wife dying he said he went
[56:08] down there he like Lord don't take my
[56:10] baby don't take my baby and just my let
[56:12] me let me die and he said a black sheep
[56:14] come down and he said and he said of
[56:17] course the devil came to me and said
[56:18] think about all the things you've done
[56:20] for him and now he's going to turn his
[56:22] back on
[56:23] you and he said here I was in this he
[56:26] said but something down deep rose up in
[56:29] me and said though God slay me yet I
[56:32] will trust
[56:34] him and he said and he there PL many
[56:37] places he talks about it and he said it
[56:39] was to the place if God sends me to
[56:42] hell I'll still love
[56:46] him that's real
[56:48] Faith amen faith when You Face death
[56:52] that When God says no you still love him
[56:56] am you still trust him and you still say
[56:59] God knows
[57:02] best this is where he what he said he
[57:04] said he God knows best still you love
[57:08] him that's real Faith anybody when
[57:11] mountains are moving can have faith but
[57:14] let it go backwards one time and see how
[57:16] it works that's when you prove whether
[57:18] you got faith or
[57:25] not many have crossed over the great
[57:28] sea Jordan River is is referred to The
[57:32] Divide he said I've watched them come
[57:35] down to the end of the road and buried
[57:37] many as sure as there's a God in heaven
[57:40] I believe if I will live true to him
[57:41] someday in a better land I'll be with
[57:44] him again so that's the main thing so
[57:48] that's the main thing after all what is
[57:52] life we just don't know how long it's
[57:55] going to last
[57:56] just might be gone this afternoon might
[57:59] might be our last time together do you
[58:01] know that but whether it is or whether
[58:04] it isn't we can't lose that's
[58:10] right Hallelujah whether it is the last
[58:14] time together or whether it isn't we
[58:17] can't lose there's no way for a
[58:19] Christian to
[58:21] lose you just can't lose no matter what
[58:24] there's no loss in Christianity if I
[58:26] live I gain if I die I gain well I say I
[58:30] die I can't die as long as I have
[58:32] eternal life in me I can never
[58:37] die there's no such a thing as death to
[58:40] a Christian it's not one scripture in
[58:42] the Bible that tells you a Christian
[58:43] dies very much contrary they're all
[58:45] alive Jesus said he that believeth on me
[58:48] hath everlasting life how can it have an
[58:51] end if it's got everlasting life he that
[58:54] heareth my words and believeth on him
[58:55] that sent me ha everlasting life and
[58:58] shall not come into the condemnation but
[59:00] has passed from Death to
[59:04] life we cannot die we cannot cease to
[59:08] exist we will always be that's
[59:11] right oh but that ain't the same with
[59:14] you Old Devil that's right that ain't
[59:17] the same with you cancer that ain't the
[59:20] same with you any kind of disease you
[59:21] want to name any kind of complex you
[59:23] want to that ain't the same with you you
[59:26] you have an expiration
[59:28] date but as for me I will not cease to
[59:32] exist I am Eternal as God is eternal you
[59:35] as Eternal as God is eternal so when
[59:38] cancer is gone and every disease is gone
[59:41] and problems is gone and heart troubles
[59:43] is gone we will still be shouting the
[59:46] victory over everything including
[59:50] death
[59:55] hallu there'll never be a
[59:58] time let me go back there was a
[1:00:02] time when you was
[1:00:05] nothing but there will never be a
[1:00:09] time but what you'll be something
[1:00:14] somewhere you're going to be somewhere
[1:00:16] from this all through his ceaseless ages
[1:00:18] all
[1:00:19] eternity so now just think about it
[1:00:22] sometimes When Trials get hard we hit we
[1:00:25] hit snags in life like everybody
[1:00:29] does listen Christians are not the only
[1:00:31] ones that hit snags in
[1:00:35] life some hard trials we had to pull
[1:00:37] hard to get through it he said but when
[1:00:40] I'm up against it I just think on this
[1:00:43] what difference does it
[1:00:46] make the Bible said all things work
[1:00:49] together for the good that love him is
[1:00:51] that right so maybe it's for my
[1:00:54] good I just go right ahead and take it
[1:00:57] anyhow there's nothing can bother you
[1:00:59] even death itself can't bother you when
[1:01:01] death comes the old Apostle when he was
[1:01:03] building a scaffold out there to cut his
[1:01:04] head off he looked out there and said
[1:01:06] death where is thy
[1:01:09] sting grave where is thy Victory grave
[1:01:13] said well I'll have you after a while
[1:01:15] the Apostle said what can you do to
[1:01:18] me I just cuz I'll point you over to Y
[1:01:21] to Jesus Christ who broke all the bands
[1:01:24] and Rose up again how are you going to
[1:01:27] hold me death said I'll make you squeak
[1:01:29] I'll make you holler show me where you
[1:01:32] can do
[1:01:34] that the only thing I know that God did
[1:01:37] to death he harnessed it to a
[1:01:40] buggy the only thing he can do is pull a
[1:01:43] Believer right into the presence of
[1:01:47] God hallelujah so what's going what's he
[1:01:51] going to do he cannot hurt us we haven't
[1:01:55] got nothing to worry
[1:01:58] about he said you know the little story
[1:02:00] I told about death having no
[1:02:04] Stinger Satan wasn't sure when Jesus was
[1:02:07] on Earth if he was really the son of God
[1:02:09] see him standing there Satan come to him
[1:02:11] said well if you perform these Miracles
[1:02:13] if you'll do this if you'll do that you
[1:02:15] you know Bow Down and Worship me or turn
[1:02:18] this Stone into bread he said man shall
[1:02:20] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:02:22] word that proceeded out of the mouth of
[1:02:23] God
[1:02:26] you know and so he took him up and said
[1:02:27] see all the kingdoms he said he showed
[1:02:28] him the United States he showed him all
[1:02:30] the all the kingdoms of the earth he
[1:02:32] says Bow Down and Worship me and you'll
[1:02:34] have
[1:02:35] them Jesus said get behind me Satan cuz
[1:02:39] he knew he was going to fall air to
[1:02:40] every one of it
[1:02:43] anyhow finally when they got him down
[1:02:45] one day and they took a rag and put
[1:02:47] around his face he said I imagine it was
[1:02:49] old dirty scarf pulled it around his
[1:02:52] head beating bleeding and hurting
[1:02:56] morning cold wind blowing they already
[1:02:58] whipped him blood running down his
[1:02:59] shoulders they threw something around
[1:03:02] him that blood sticking to his back he's
[1:03:04] sitting there in the crown of thorns
[1:03:05] over his face blood and spit from the
[1:03:08] soldiers all over his face sitting there
[1:03:11] what an awful sight to look at oh God
[1:03:13] you say if I'd been there I'd done
[1:03:15] something about it he said well why
[1:03:17] don't you do something about it
[1:03:19] now you've done the same thing that
[1:03:22] you'll do then now that you'll do then
[1:03:24] when he was sitting there mocked up and
[1:03:26] spitting mocked at and spit on there was
[1:03:29] disciples standing back said oh my could
[1:03:30] it been could have done this that man
[1:03:32] could have called a man dead man from
[1:03:34] the grave and look at him there but he
[1:03:36] they failed to see what was taking place
[1:03:38] in
[1:03:40] scriptures the blood and the spit was on
[1:03:42] his face and the rag upon his eyes and
[1:03:45] they you know they tell me he's a
[1:03:46] spiritual prophet and a discerner let's
[1:03:49] hit him and let him tell us who hit him
[1:03:51] they got a stick and hit him on top of
[1:03:52] the head with it if you're a prophet
[1:03:54] tell us who hit you he never opened his
[1:03:57] mouth he just sat there Satan said well
[1:03:59] you know that can't be
[1:04:02] God but he was faithful even in
[1:04:07] death the same thing you know
[1:04:10] denominations say that bunch of hly
[1:04:11] rollers that can't be God that can't be
[1:04:14] God moving there that can't be that's
[1:04:16] mental telepathy that's fortune tell
[1:04:17] that's this that and the other so they
[1:04:19] started up the hill and they put a robe
[1:04:20] around him the only clothes he ever had
[1:04:22] I guess when he was a man put it over
[1:04:25] his back and and there was little spots
[1:04:26] on his coat but as he went up the hill
[1:04:28] dragging him bumping that old cross and
[1:04:30] his little frail body going along
[1:04:32] whipping him everything else and it
[1:04:34] bumpy bump bumpy bump and his shoulders
[1:04:37] rubbing he'd stagger and he'll continue
[1:04:39] then spots got bigger and bigger to
[1:04:41] after a while they become one big red
[1:04:44] spot and old Satan
[1:04:47] said that couldn't be
[1:04:50] God how could that be God he's just a
[1:04:53] man he's just putting on he just put on
[1:04:56] I I I'll sting him and I just like I did
[1:04:58] everybody else if he was God he couldn't
[1:05:02] die so I'll sting him and see about like
[1:05:04] that I'll give him a try so when he got
[1:05:06] him on the cross he sucked that stinger
[1:05:09] in him and when he did he lost his
[1:05:14] Stinger there was more to that man than
[1:05:17] what he
[1:05:18] thought that man was God said and he
[1:05:22] said that's the reason he said oh death
[1:05:24] Paul said oh death where is your sting
[1:05:26] he had lost it that's right he said just
[1:05:30] as a Bee once stings deep it can't sting
[1:05:32] no more the bee is finished then he said
[1:05:35] this bee of death doesn't have no
[1:05:37] Stinger no more and Paul would scream
[1:05:40] out oh death where is your sting grave
[1:05:42] said I'll get you Paul I'll swallow you
[1:05:44] up I'll canker your body I'll rot you
[1:05:47] away oh grave where is your Victory but
[1:05:50] thanks be to God who gives us Victory
[1:05:52] through our Lord Jesus Christ death has
[1:05:55] lost his sting I fought a good fight I
[1:05:58] finished my course I have kept the faith
[1:06:01] yes sir henceforth as laid up for me a
[1:06:04] crown of righteousness that the Lord the
[1:06:06] righteous judge will give me at that day
[1:06:08] and not only me but all who love his
[1:06:12] appearing chop now on if you want to
[1:06:15] death you can't hurt me any
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:23] longer you can look in that grave
[1:06:26] he said go ahead grave destroy that
[1:06:30] body go ahead grave turn it into dust go
[1:06:33] ahead your bunch of maggots turn it into
[1:06:37] dust but Jesus Christ is the
[1:06:40] resurrection and the
[1:06:43] life you can take me down to a graveyard
[1:06:47] you can lay my body down but one of
[1:06:49] these
[1:06:51] days going to hear the trumpet sound
[1:06:56] and what was nothing but a handful of
[1:06:58] Ashes will take form again in a
[1:07:01] body but it won't be that same old Tony
[1:07:04] that we
[1:07:05] knew won't see be that same old Caren
[1:07:07] that ragged body we saw where her buried
[1:07:09] in I didn't even recognize her laying
[1:07:11] there in the caset death had so
[1:07:12] destroyed her body it won't be that same
[1:07:15] it'll be a perfect body Perfect Teeth
[1:07:18] perfect hair perfect perfect h a perfect
[1:07:22] house amen yeah it might not be nothing
[1:07:25] but a spoonful of Ashes but on that
[1:07:29] day death won't have no hold on that
[1:07:32] body on that day that body will rise
[1:07:38] up and we can declare as they did about
[1:07:41] those they died in faith so is Gerald
[1:07:43] sha died in faith cam PR died in faith
[1:07:47] Tony Adams died in faith and one day
[1:07:49] they're going to raise by the power of
[1:07:51] almighty God
[1:07:59] he says Chop on now grave Chop on death
[1:08:02] if you want to that's the real Christian
[1:08:06] Spirit that's right look death right in
[1:08:08] the eyes so you can't hold
[1:08:13] me even death itself doesn't worry you
[1:08:17] in when you're in the Lord he rose from
[1:08:20] the dead we don't worry about that death
[1:08:22] comes like the little sister was
[1:08:24] speaking about there if it's time to go
[1:08:26] let's
[1:08:30] go what do you do change this old V
[1:08:33] carcass that we got for an immortal one
[1:08:35] made like his own glorious body who
[1:08:38] wouldn't change for
[1:08:41] that come on now if all you had on you
[1:08:44] tonight was a bunch of
[1:08:46] rags and somebody offered you a new suit
[1:08:48] of clothes for
[1:08:50] free would you take
[1:08:52] it well if God offered you a new body
[1:08:55] would you take it he said who wouldn't
[1:08:58] make that exchange tell me somebody that
[1:09:00] would older person young person no
[1:09:02] matter if you're only 15 years old 12
[1:09:04] whatever it is death May lays right at
[1:09:06] at your door you don't know what time
[1:09:08] that human heart that beats like this
[1:09:09] has got to stop someday it might stop
[1:09:11] when you're 10 years old 12 years old it
[1:09:13] does it by the thousands every day but
[1:09:17] in here in this body we're going to
[1:09:19] exchange it for the blood that don't
[1:09:21] pulsate it the Holy Spirit Will pulsate
[1:09:24] it amen it can't die it's Immortal
[1:09:27] Eternal it'll never die
[1:09:31] again yes sir the Lord so when death
[1:09:35] comes to our door and he screams out
[1:09:37] glory to God well that's kind of a odd
[1:09:39] deal right I mean when death comes to
[1:09:41] our
[1:09:42] door we want to cry and we do we
[1:09:45] sorrow but here brother brand said when
[1:09:47] death comes to our door glory to
[1:09:51] God as long as God's requirement the
[1:09:54] blood's been placed on the Lin of my
[1:09:56] heart post what difference does it make
[1:10:00] it can't bother me if the doctor says
[1:10:02] you're going to die tomorrow what
[1:10:04] difference does it make the blood's on
[1:10:06] the
[1:10:06] post you got to die anyhow but if the
[1:10:09] blood's been applied I've got a
[1:10:11] Resurrection
[1:10:14] coming amen so I I I was looking at
[1:10:16] these things second Peter 1 10 says
[1:10:19] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:10:21] diligence to make your calling and
[1:10:24] election sure
[1:10:29] for if you do these things you shall
[1:10:32] never
[1:10:34] fall think it's a time that we look at
[1:10:36] our
[1:10:38] lives it's a good time to
[1:10:41] examine just say Lord what about me am I
[1:10:43] am I where I need to
[1:10:46] be then when it's written about me if I
[1:10:49] go be by the grave that he died in faith

[1:10:59] days from the first breath to the last
[1:11:02] breath and all that's in between he is
[1:11:05] the God of all of it I want to read to

[1:14:23] body when you created me in the secret
[1:14:25] place carefully carefully you shaped me
[1:14:29] from nothing into
[1:14:33] something you saw me when you created me
[1:14:37] to be before I became
[1:14:40] me before I'd ever seen the light of day
[1:14:43] the number of days you planned for me
[1:14:47] and were already recorded in your
[1:14:51] book every single moment you are
[1:14:53] thinking of me
[1:14:59] how precious and wonderful to consider
[1:15:02] that you cherish me constantly in your
[1:15:05] ever thought oh God your desires toward
[1:15:09] me are more than the grains of the sand
[1:15:11] on every Shore and when I wake each
[1:15:14] morning you're still with
[1:15:20] me we're living in the shadows of the
[1:15:22] coming of the Lord
[1:15:26] what can you promise
[1:15:27] yourself what can Any Nation promise
[1:15:31] there's not a promise
[1:15:33] left nothing is left there's chaos in
[1:15:37] everything there is nothing this way you
[1:15:39] can see or nothing that way you can see
[1:15:41] that has hope the only thing that has
[1:15:44] hope is to look this
[1:15:46] way to look up every promise in the word
[1:15:50] is true some Glorious Day Jesus is going
[1:15:53] to come
[1:15:55] and all these things will be taken away
[1:15:57] and Christ will reign isn't it a
[1:15:59] wonderful hope to know that these old
[1:16:01] frail fragile bodies we're living in and
[1:16:04] these little brittle threads of life
[1:16:06] that we're walking on someday will give
[1:16:08] away and every Mortal will that's
[1:16:11] turning will stop and we'll take a trip
[1:16:13] to Zion's Hill to live in the presence
[1:16:16] of God forever like a new man and a new
[1:16:19] woman young and a splendor of Youth to
[1:16:21] be that way forever the young will be
[1:16:24] old there forever transformed in a
[1:16:26] moment of time Immortal shall shine in
[1:16:28] his likeness the stars and the sun to
[1:16:31] outshine what a glorious Assurance we
[1:16:33] have of this because God's Eternal Word
[1:16:35] who has been true to all
[1:16:38] ages has promised it to every believer
[1:16:41] so what have we got to worry about not a
[1:16:45] thing but just be happy about it
[1:16:51] all cuz he knows us he's numbered our
[1:16:55] days he knows exactly what we're going
[1:16:58] through and where we're at he said I
[1:17:01] know that sitting before me like every
[1:17:03] Mortal here tonight is a great big black
[1:17:06] big black
[1:17:08] door and every time the heart beats
[1:17:11] you're going one step closer to
[1:17:14] it it's called death and one time your
[1:17:18] heart beats that's one time less it'll
[1:17:20] beat again we're going that way I don't
[1:17:22] know when it's going to stop but when I
[1:17:24] enter there I don't want to go like a
[1:17:30] coward hello somebody I don't want to go
[1:17:33] like a coward I want to wrap myself in
[1:17:36] his righteousness and enter into that
[1:17:38] channel of death knowing this that I'm
[1:17:40] persuaded I know him in the power of his
[1:17:43] resurrection for he has resurrected me
[1:17:46] from a life of sin and he's made me his
[1:17:48] servant and I know him that way and I
[1:17:50] know when he calls I will come out of
[1:17:53] the grave
[1:17:55] I want that as my
[1:18:02] testimony you know another place he says
[1:18:06] when Moses had
[1:18:08] failed and moved from Moses to Joshua
[1:18:11] and Joshua sees the pillar of fire move
[1:18:13] and he says come on children we're on
[1:18:15] our road he brought them up to the side
[1:18:17] of Jordan he said when I think of that
[1:18:20] how beautiful he said now before we
[1:18:22] cross over we'll get a couple spies to
[1:18:24] go over know how Rahab and all of that
[1:18:27] said like the other night talking about
[1:18:29] the red streak she her red cord she put
[1:18:31] there and it saved her house hold and
[1:18:33] all the walls fell but her part because
[1:18:35] there was that red cord on their door
[1:18:38] like like the other night we talking
[1:18:39] about the death angel he said coming
[1:18:41] through is there a red streak on your
[1:18:42] door before this great shaking comes he
[1:18:46] said now once more will I shake the
[1:18:47] Earth but I will shake the heavens and
[1:18:50] we but we have received a kingdom that
[1:18:52] cannot be shaken we're living in such a
[1:18:54] great power he said but I see Joshua the
[1:18:57] young leader and God meets him and he
[1:18:59] says don't get scared now my servant
[1:19:01] Moses is dead but rise and go over this
[1:19:03] Jordan no man all the days of your life
[1:19:05] better stand before you as I was with
[1:19:07] Moses so I'll be with you fear not be
[1:19:09] strong and very courageous my I can see
[1:19:11] that old Warrior walking down there
[1:19:13] little humble fell he called all Israel
[1:19:15] together and looked over Jordan it was a
[1:19:17] month of harvest and the Snows were
[1:19:19] melting and the river was roaring I seen
[1:19:20] Joshua and now he's standing there how
[1:19:22] he's going to get across look they
[1:19:24] didn't have Bridges they didn't have no
[1:19:26] arches they didn't have material to
[1:19:27] build anything wood steel nothing in
[1:19:30] those days they didn't have they didn't
[1:19:31] have nothing but Joshua looked across
[1:19:33] that M muddy Jordan and he looked back
[1:19:35] there and seen those thousands and tens
[1:19:37] of thousands of Jews waiting and he said
[1:19:40] God Will Make A
[1:19:43] Way and if God promis it God will keep
[1:19:46] his
[1:19:47] promise and he goes on he says Joshua
[1:19:49] standing there looking around he says oh
[1:19:51] my we're going to stand there too one of
[1:19:53] these days
[1:19:55] we're going to stand at the end of the
[1:19:56] road you might be healthy tonight friend
[1:19:59] there may might be nothing wrong with
[1:20:00] you but one of these days the doctor
[1:20:02] will be in your room and say there's
[1:20:03] nothing else can be done that pulse will
[1:20:05] be slipping up the sleeve those youthful
[1:20:07] days are gone something struck the
[1:20:09] doctor says there's nothing sorry she's
[1:20:11] a young woman young boy old or young
[1:20:13] whatever it don't matter there's nothing
[1:20:15] can be done walking out of the room
[1:20:16] you'll feel the cold Vapors of death
[1:20:18] floating down into the room and that old
[1:20:20] Jordan muddy will look muddy and rough
[1:20:23] but may you be as Josh UA he looked
[1:20:26] sitting back there on the hill he looked
[1:20:29] in there he said there's an ark of
[1:20:30] Covenant that go between he had
[1:20:33] something that would go between him and
[1:20:35] the flood something between him and the
[1:20:38] trouble and tonight we also have an arc
[1:20:41] and it's Christ Jesus who stands between
[1:20:43] us and death some of these days when the
[1:20:45] last breath is leaving my body I want to
[1:20:47] run down that River and say give away
[1:20:49] Jordan I'm going over to see my Lord I
[1:20:52] believe in the Morning Star will come
[1:20:54] out and light up the Valley of the
[1:20:56] shadow of death and a light up the way
[1:20:58] and the Holy Ghost will stretch two
[1:21:00] glossy Wings across that Jordan and will
[1:21:02] bury our weary souls to a better land
[1:21:05] amen yes Lord hallelujah oh
[1:21:12] yes he says my brother I'm no boy no
[1:21:16] more I'm a middle-aged
[1:21:18] man and one of these days I got to come
[1:21:21] to the end of the road and if I go like
[1:21:24] most brandom's Harvey's when they get
[1:21:26] old they kind of get
[1:21:28] shaky hope he lets me stay to the end
[1:21:32] but when I come down to the end of the
[1:21:33] road I hope an old gray-headed man gray
[1:21:37] whiskers leaning on the
[1:21:40] staff and when I hear the old Jordan
[1:21:42] waves dancing around everywhere I know
[1:21:45] the time has come I want to beh holding
[1:21:48] in my hand a
[1:21:53] sword that's right I want to turn and
[1:21:55] look down through a lifetime of ministry
[1:21:58] and see every Brier patch I come through
[1:22:00] and every Hill I took and when it's done
[1:22:03] I want to take that old sword and stick
[1:22:05] it back in the sheath of Eternity and
[1:22:08] take off the helmet of salvation and
[1:22:10] kneel on the bank and say God push out
[1:22:13] the Lifeboat I'm coming
[1:22:16] home if I'm faithful to my savior to his
[1:22:20] guiding hand I'll cling he'll guide me
[1:22:23] over death's r River Heaven's new sweet
[1:22:27] song I will
[1:22:29] sing let's byow our
[1:22:36] hearts faith in
[1:22:41] death I want to be holding a
[1:22:49] sword I have fought the good
[1:22:52] fight I have kept the faith
[1:23:00] may we all be guilty of
[1:23:02] that looking back and seeing all the
[1:23:05] heels we took all the Brier patches we
[1:23:08] come through the trials and the things
[1:23:10] we went through the
[1:23:13] sicknesses we look
[1:23:15] back then we'll be able to take that
[1:23:18] sword put it into the sheath of
[1:23:22] Eternity then we can take our helmets
[1:23:24] off off then we can take off our
[1:23:28] breastplates then we can lay our armor
[1:23:32] down then we can
[1:23:36] rest but until
[1:23:41] then let's keep
[1:23:47] fighting I don't know who all we will
[1:23:50] have to lay down in the
[1:23:51] grave but let's keep fighting
[1:23:55] cuz we know there's a promise that is
[1:23:58] greater than the
[1:24:01] grave and one day and I don't think it's
[1:24:05] going to be very
[1:24:08] long actually we're some of the lucky
[1:24:11] ones if you can say it that way we don't
[1:24:15] have long to
[1:24:21] wait coming down to the closing of time
[1:24:26] if I could hear Brother Tony's voice
[1:24:29] today in the choir he'd be screaming out
[1:24:32] it's worth
[1:24:33] it press
[1:24:38] on I never knew there would be so
[1:24:40] grander so much grander and so great I
[1:24:44] never knew could never
[1:24:47] understand but now I have eyesight real
