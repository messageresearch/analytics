[22:25] but um i actually got to listen to last
[22:28] night's service
[22:29] it's a wonderful service to listen to
[22:31] and god's really using him in a
[22:34] in a mighty way in a personal way he's
[22:36] preaching on praise him in the storm
[22:39] and he said a lot of people can talk
[22:40] about preaching about praising him
[22:42] after a storm or during a storm but
[22:45] there's you know he's able to preach
[22:47] while he's in the storm and just know
[22:49] that jesus is there and
[22:51] taking care of his needs and situations
[22:53] such a message of faith
[22:55] and uh he's we're just looking for some
[22:58] good reports
[22:59] but no matter what the report we believe
[23:02] the lord's report
[23:03] and the lord's report is by his stripes
[23:06] he's healed
[23:07] and so that's what we're holding on to
[23:08] today also
[23:10] sister karen pruitt is not here with us
[23:12] this morning we had to
[23:14] yesterday we had to take her to the er
[23:16] in in
[23:17] in lsu there in shreveport she's just
[23:19] this week been having a lot of issues
[23:23] with being cognized and
[23:26] also with her memory and just a lot of
[23:28] confusion
[23:29] doctors seem to think maybe this has
[23:31] something to do with their medicine
[23:33] so they're trying to get all that
[23:34] figured out and uh
[23:36] i'm just i'm just once again believing
[23:38] in the lord's report
[23:41] we're at right out a year of her having
[23:43] that
[23:44] major brain bleed and major surgery
[23:47] and it was right there at that same time
[23:51] that brother ron
[23:52] spencer had planned to come down and had
[23:55] felt on his heart to come here and to be
[23:56] brave for
[23:58] felt like it was a unction of the holy
[24:00] holy spirit to lead him here
[24:02] and from that time and and those moments
[24:05] there at the lake house
[24:07] the devil tried to block it and uh it
[24:10] was during that time my mom went into
[24:12] the hospital with that
[24:13] severe brain bleed and and he he ended
[24:17] up coming anyway
[24:18] and we spent some wonderful days there
[24:20] in prayer
[24:21] and from that time god has moved on his
[24:24] behalf
[24:25] we saw him move on sister karen's behalf
[24:28] and as
[24:28] we've been preaching he's the author and
[24:30] the finisher
[24:32] and we believe he is the finisher i i
[24:34] don't believe he does anything halfway
[24:38] it's just the devil trying to raise his
[24:39] own ugly head and i'm here to tell you
[24:41] the devil's in trouble this morning
[24:44] amen i had a late night he's in trouble
[24:47] amen brother tim had a late night last
[24:49] night but he's he's
[24:51] the devil's in trouble amen because
[24:53] we've reported here to duty for our duty
[24:56] as believers and we're going to bind
[24:58] together and we're going to bind this
[25:00] devil that's been tormenting her and
[25:02] her mind whether it be through the
[25:03] medication or whatever it is
[25:06] god's greater than anything and we're
[25:08] going to stand on the promises of god
[25:10] he's omnipotent
[25:12] he's greater than any issues he's
[25:14] greater than any circumstances
[25:16] he's greater than anything any of these
[25:18] surgeries that's coming up
[25:19] he's he's in control amen you believe
[25:22] that this morning
[25:24] amen so we're going to come together in
[25:26] prayer as brother johnny if he'd come i
[25:28] just really felt to have you pray this
[25:30] morning
[25:31] amen ask god to move on the behalf of
[25:33] his believers
[25:35] and the situations that we have going on
[25:37] we have a lot of needs
[25:38] but we serve a great god for our needs
[25:42] and he's got the answer now as i've said
[25:44] before

[54:22] and verse 7 revelation chapter 12 and
[54:26] verse 7
[54:27] and while you're just finding your place
[54:30] in the bible i
[54:31] i just wanted to mention today that um
[54:36] you know this past week i
[54:39] i was able to speak for nearly three
[54:42] hours
[54:43] with um on a zoom conference call with
[54:46] about
[54:46] 18 uh different russian-speaking
[54:49] ministers
[54:51] um from russia ukraine
[54:54] i'm not sure uh each each one what
[54:57] country maybe somewhere from
[54:59] lithuania or latvia but anyway they were
[55:03] they all gathered and we had a wonderful
[55:05] time of fellowship with them and
[55:07] ministering to them
[55:08] uh this week and um you know so when we
[55:13] when we think of the the services here
[55:15] it's more than just
[55:16] that what you see here in this building
[55:18] but there are many many that are
[55:20] represented
[55:21] around the world that are actually
[55:23] listening in or will hear this service
[55:26] and we want to bring them into heavenly
[55:29] places
[55:31] amen by by the word of god and by the
[55:34] power of christ
[55:36] i was really touched when one brother
[55:40] introduced himself he is in the ukraine
[55:43] he was he was speaking to me from prison
[55:46] he was uh he's a life in prison for a
[55:50] crime that he did not commit
[55:52] and uh i don't know all his story or
[55:55] whatever but
[55:56] i asked him us because he had kind of
[55:59] organized the meeting and
[56:00] and had requesting that i come and and
[56:02] speak to them and so
[56:04] through his inspiration we kind of they
[56:06] kind of got it together and we
[56:08] men we ministered to them this past
[56:11] thursday
[56:12] and um and so i asked him well
[56:15] how in the world do you know me you're
[56:17] in prison in
[56:18] in um in ukraine and he said um well
[56:23] um i've heard dvds of you in ministers
[56:26] meetings where you spoke and where they
[56:28] translated in
[56:29] into russian and conventions and things
[56:32] like that but
[56:33] said i also get online and i listen to
[56:35] you preach i don't understand
[56:37] english i catch the inspiration from the
[56:40] service
[56:41] amen so you know you think about that
[56:43] you're inspiring a little heart
[56:45] that it's there that's in prison and
[56:49] and you know the devil isn't bigger than
[56:51] god
[56:53] and god has a purpose for everything so
[56:55] if he's in prison
[56:57] for a crime that he didn't even commit
[57:00] god's got him there as and he's got a
[57:03] little group of men there that he's been
[57:05] ministering to
[57:06] and trying to bring the gospel of jesus
[57:09] christ to so
[57:10] you know it's um when you are in service
[57:13] like this
[57:14] there are a host of unseen witnesses
[57:18] everywhere that are part of our service
[57:21] and
[57:22] you know i see a little bright spot in
[57:24] our service today again sister catherine
[57:26] right there and
[57:27] she used to be one of those that were
[57:29] listening in just like that and
[57:31] and receiving um the services and
[57:34] and so on so that you know it ministered
[57:37] to her so she knows what i'm talking
[57:39] about
[57:40] amen and there are thousands of others
[57:44] around the world and you know it's
[57:45] fulfilling the gospel
[57:48] amen that this gospel must be preached
[57:50] into all nations
[57:52] so the end can come so we got a purpose
[57:55] and a place and a plan
[57:56] that god has for us amen revelation
[57:59] chapter 12 verse 7
[58:01] and there was war in heaven michael and
[58:03] his angels fought against the dragon
[58:05] and the dragon fought and his angels and
[58:09] prevailed not and neither was their
[58:11] place
[58:12] found any more in heaven and the great
[58:15] dragon was cast out that old serpent
[58:17] called the devil and satan which
[58:19] deceiveth the whole world
[58:20] he was cast out into the earth and his
[58:22] angels were cast out with him
[58:24] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[58:26] heaven now is come salvation
[58:29] and strength and the kingdom of our god
[58:31] and the power of his christ for the
[58:33] accuser of our brethren is cast
[58:34] down which accused them before our god
[58:37] day and night
[58:38] and they overcame him by the blood the
[58:40] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[58:42] and they loved not their lives and to
[58:44] the death therefore rejoice
[58:46] your heavens and ye that dwell in them
[58:49] woe to the inhabiters of the earth and
[58:50] of the sea for the devil has come down
[58:52] to you having great wrath
[58:54] because he hath knoweth he hath but a
[58:57] short
[58:58] time amen and i'll tell you what his
[59:01] time is even
[59:02] short now the rapture is really soon
[59:06] amen this battle is about to be over god
[59:09] bless you can be seated
[59:11] we're going to focus more on this
[59:14] statement
[59:15] concerning the devil where he says
[59:18] neither was their place
[59:20] found anymore in heaven now
[59:23] we um we're going to be speaking today
[59:26] on the battle for
[59:28] preeminence again i was speaking on this
[59:31] last sunday
[59:32] and got a little little ways into my
[59:35] thought and of course we lost
[59:37] electricity because of a tree falling on
[59:40] a power line
[59:41] some four or five miles away and and uh
[59:44] knocked us
[59:44] out of electricity for a little bit but
[59:47] we persevered
[59:48] and prevailed and went right on and
[59:51] ministered and
[59:52] and the good news is is that you know
[59:55] brother
[59:55] michael dexter he's johnny on the spot
[59:58] so he
[59:58] he just really him and his brother david
[1:00:01] went to recording some other way and
[1:00:04] they pieced it all together and got it
[1:00:05] out there anyhow so
[1:00:07] you know the devil can't stop us amen
[1:00:10] we're pressing on
[1:00:12] amen so today we're we want to
[1:00:15] as we look at this we i find this really
[1:00:19] curious
[1:00:20] where it says that of concerning the
[1:00:22] devil neither was
[1:00:24] their place found any more in heaven
[1:00:28] and and so we want to find out
[1:00:31] why he is in heaven why is the devil in
[1:00:34] heaven
[1:00:36] and whose place is he occupying there
[1:00:39] because he doesn't have a real place
[1:00:42] there
[1:00:44] amen and and then we want to find out
[1:00:48] how to cast him down from that place
[1:00:53] now and so we we're we're looking and
[1:00:56] we're pondering in the scripture of
[1:00:58] how is it that satan is occupying a
[1:01:01] place in heaven
[1:01:02] that is not his rightful place now
[1:01:05] i know you know a place in heaven
[1:01:08] represents authority and power
[1:01:12] and we can see from the beginning of how
[1:01:14] satan wanted preeminence
[1:01:16] over what he at what was not his it's
[1:01:20] just as
[1:01:20] we see here on the earth right now the
[1:01:24] the battles that are happening
[1:01:25] everywhere as you know we
[1:01:27] are at war and there are wars that are
[1:01:31] happening everywhere there's a war
[1:01:34] between
[1:01:35] right and wrong and good and evil
[1:01:37] there's a right
[1:01:38] a war in politics among nations and
[1:01:41] families
[1:01:42] even in homes um everywhere
[1:01:45] i mean i was in the hospital until about
[1:01:48] um
[1:01:48] until nearly midnight last night with my
[1:01:51] wife
[1:01:52] and and there you know the television is
[1:01:54] showing on
[1:01:55] uh on there oh at nothing it was a
[1:01:57] computer i'm sorry
[1:01:59] was uh there that was showing um uh
[1:02:02] just a uh um you know a flag
[1:02:06] of the gay the gay flag and you know
[1:02:08] with its uh
[1:02:09] false rainbow rainbow covenant is is
[1:02:12] god's covenant it's not the gay covenant
[1:02:15] god's color is seven theirs is six
[1:02:18] number of men
[1:02:19] and they want to change it into
[1:02:21] something evil
[1:02:22] and you know make it all inclusive and i
[1:02:26] i as i watch them you know advertising
[1:02:29] for the hospital well we want to
[1:02:31] represent
[1:02:31] all all uh uh every everybody and
[1:02:36] and everything well why isn't there a
[1:02:38] flag flown for
[1:02:39] um for real marriages and real homes
[1:02:44] you know why why is it why isn't i mean
[1:02:47] they're they're having what they call
[1:02:48] their pride
[1:02:49] why isn't there a pride in in in
[1:02:52] truth and reality and what's real and
[1:02:55] what's holy
[1:02:57] are you with me but anyway we we we know
[1:03:00] there's
[1:03:01] wars that are going on jesus said this
[1:03:03] end time would be
[1:03:04] with wars and rumors of wars
[1:03:08] so there's wars on every on every front
[1:03:12] satanic attacks and we see even in
[1:03:15] israel of late they have been uh
[1:03:18] under real battle and um and we were
[1:03:21] talking about that
[1:03:22] how that this contest over jerusalem
[1:03:26] and as you know every denomination wants
[1:03:29] to be
[1:03:30] the jerusalem the place where god puts
[1:03:33] his name and the claim
[1:03:35] uh they're the place for heaven and
[1:03:38] um and again the the battles that have
[1:03:41] been
[1:03:42] uh here of late in jerusalem just to
[1:03:45] recap that for a moment
[1:03:46] it's been about removing squatters a
[1:03:49] squatter is a person who
[1:03:51] unlawfully occupies an uninhabited
[1:03:54] building or piece of land
[1:03:56] and so these rights that has been taking
[1:03:59] place in gaza
[1:04:00] has been over a supreme court uh ruling
[1:04:04] where they were going to rule
[1:04:06] you know to give rights to israelis to
[1:04:08] legally remove these palestinians from
[1:04:11] properties that were actually
[1:04:12] purchased by the jews the jews own
[1:04:16] title to it they bought it with money
[1:04:19] and yet there and they bought it
[1:04:22] from the palestinians but they won't
[1:04:25] leave the property
[1:04:26] and so they want to be a squatter on
[1:04:29] there and
[1:04:30] and so in 1982 they even signed an
[1:04:33] agreement accepting jewish ownership of
[1:04:35] the land
[1:04:36] while being allowed to live there is
[1:04:38] protected tenants
[1:04:40] and but they uh since that time have
[1:04:43] refused to pay rent and you know they're
[1:04:46] laying
[1:04:47] claim to what is not legally theirs
[1:04:51] and and let me just talk about that for
[1:04:53] a minute furthermore all the land
[1:04:55] that the jews owned prior to israel
[1:04:57] becoming a nation
[1:04:59] was purchased they paid for it for
[1:05:02] decades
[1:05:03] they bought swamps and deserts
[1:05:06] and they rehabilitated the land
[1:05:10] this and then the same arabs that sold
[1:05:13] it to him wanted it back
[1:05:14] when they saw it to be developed you
[1:05:16] know and
[1:05:17] the um the land changes hands by two-way
[1:05:21] by purchase
[1:05:22] or through war but the jews have gained
[1:05:25] this property in jerusalem by buying it
[1:05:28] and but they can't possess it because of
[1:05:30] squatters
[1:05:31] illegally possessing the property
[1:05:34] and you know people forget that before
[1:05:36] the jews
[1:05:38] returned to israel and by the way her
[1:05:40] name is israel
[1:05:42] and not palestine it was labeled
[1:05:44] palestine by the romans
[1:05:46] but before they returned to israel
[1:05:50] it was a desolate mainly swamps
[1:05:53] and deserts they in fact the well-known
[1:05:56] mark twain
[1:05:57] um that that we know here in america is
[1:06:00] a literary figure
[1:06:02] he visited palestine in 1867
[1:06:05] and he said it was a hopeless dreary
[1:06:08] heartbroken
[1:06:09] land and this is really important
[1:06:12] statement to think about
[1:06:13] what kind of condition it was in for two
[1:06:16] millennium
[1:06:17] of abuse two thousand years of abuse
[1:06:21] there um the land with wind and
[1:06:24] water erosion as a result in the land
[1:06:27] being non-productive
[1:06:29] and so as the jews returned to israel
[1:06:32] they purchased
[1:06:34] a lot of this swamp and and desert lands
[1:06:37] and
[1:06:37] they lovingly restored the land
[1:06:40] literally and it became one of the most
[1:06:43] productive places
[1:06:45] on the face of the earth if you ever go
[1:06:47] there you'll see what i'm talking about
[1:06:49] places that was formerly just swamps and
[1:06:52] are barren
[1:06:52] and desert and and it's fulfilling the
[1:06:55] scripture isaiah 35 and verse 1.
[1:06:58] the wilderness and the solitary place
[1:07:01] shall be glad for them
[1:07:03] and the desert shall rejoice and blossom
[1:07:06] as the rose
[1:07:07] it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice
[1:07:10] even with joy and singing and the glory
[1:07:14] of lebanon shall be given unto it and
[1:07:17] and the excellency of carmel and sharon
[1:07:20] they
[1:07:20] shall see the glory of the lord and the
[1:07:23] excellency of our god
[1:07:25] so we we actually saw uh
[1:07:29] witnessed in our day a barren land
[1:07:32] becoming fruitful
[1:07:33] uh a desert land blossoming like a robes
[1:07:37] what was swamps
[1:07:38] and full of mosquitoes now um it
[1:07:41] is is productive land and uh
[1:07:44] so you know we we have seen that but
[1:07:46] we've also seen
[1:07:48] neglected and abandoned areas of the
[1:07:51] word of god
[1:07:53] that would blossom abundantly too come
[1:07:56] on now
[1:07:56] we saw healing that had been neglected
[1:08:00] promises of healing that had been
[1:08:02] neglected and abandoned
[1:08:04] by the church and we've seen it
[1:08:07] repossessed
[1:08:09] amen we've seen it blossom and bring
[1:08:11] forth abundantly
[1:08:13] miracles among gifts of the spirit
[1:08:16] and mystery truths of the word that was
[1:08:19] just stagnant
[1:08:20] scriptures of murky waters
[1:08:23] and when the swamp water was drained and
[1:08:25] the disease
[1:08:26] bearing mosquitoes the demons of
[1:08:29] affliction
[1:08:30] tormented spirits were cast out
[1:08:33] amen leaving them no habitation and
[1:08:36] that's what i want for our land
[1:08:38] this promised land of the word of god i
[1:08:40] don't want the devils to be able to
[1:08:42] squat on one promise
[1:08:43] and say you can't have it that i possess
[1:08:47] it you
[1:08:47] you cannot occupy this but we want to be
[1:08:50] complete total believers in total
[1:08:54] deliverance and
[1:08:55] total victory we're not going to accept
[1:08:58] something
[1:08:58] less than that but total victory amen

[1:09:04] purchased
[1:09:05] by the blood of jesus christ how many
[1:09:08] believes that
[1:09:09] i mean we we've got a title deed to it
[1:09:12] amen but satan wants to squat on the
[1:09:15] promise
[1:09:16] he wants to stand there and possess that
[1:09:18] and keep you from
[1:09:20] occupying it and bring all of hell
[1:09:22] against you
[1:09:23] but i'm telling you right now it's been
[1:09:26] purchased by the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:28] and how dare us to let one purchase
[1:09:31] parcel
[1:09:32] of god's word lay there with the devil
[1:09:36] sitting upon it
[1:09:37] amen without challenging him and saying
[1:09:39] you have no right to this promise
[1:09:42] you have no right to keep the children
[1:09:44] of god from enjoying the blessing
[1:09:46] of healing of signs of wonders of
[1:09:49] deliverance of the power of god

[1:13:09] now remember this is exactly what john
[1:13:12] the baptist the malachi 4 was to do
[1:13:15] it was a voice of him crying in the
[1:13:17] wilderness

[1:13:32] christ you're sent with a message to
[1:13:34] forerun the second coming of christ

[1:13:53] of neglected truth have been raised up
[1:13:55] the mountains of exalted man's ideas
[1:13:58] have been pulled down
[1:14:00] a highway has been made for our god
[1:14:04] and for the people of god to put to
[1:14:06] press and go
[1:14:07] right to any divine promise
[1:14:17] i like what he says in verse 9 no lion
[1:14:20] shall be there
[1:14:22] nor any ravenous beasts shall go up
[1:14:25] thereon
[1:14:26] it shall not be found there but the
[1:14:28] redeemed shall walk there
[1:14:32] let's say it like that this morning
[1:14:34] let's realize the redeemed shall walk
[1:14:36] here where i'm walking
[1:14:38] devils ain't got a right to trod where
[1:14:41] i'm
[1:14:41] walking amen that ravenous beast cannot
[1:14:44] be found there
[1:14:46] where i'm walking where i'm walking in
[1:14:48] this path in this promised land
[1:14:50] it is not for the enemy to trot there
[1:14:53] it's for the redeemed of the lord
[1:14:55] to go from victory to victory to victory
[1:14:59] and the ransom of the lord shall the
[1:15:02] ransom of the lord don't be
[1:15:04] missed this is the redeemed of the lord
[1:15:06] shall return
[1:15:07] and come to zion with songs and
[1:15:10] everlasting joy shall be upon their
[1:15:12] heads
[1:15:12] and they shall obtain joy and gladness
[1:15:15] and sorrow and sign shall flee away
[1:15:18] are you ready for that this morning let
[1:15:21] the joy then fall
[1:15:24] amen let sorrow and sadness flee away
[1:15:28] there's been a highway made
[1:15:34] but you know what riots
[1:15:38] work
[1:15:43] you're right against the police and we
[1:15:46] defund them please
[1:15:48] instead of defunding and attacking crime
[1:15:50] we attack the police
[1:15:52] the palestinians have learned riot
[1:15:56] make a bunch of noise threaten send
[1:15:59] thousands of missiles
[1:16:01] and you can even make laws ineffective
[1:16:04] because
[1:16:04] laws are worthless when authorities are
[1:16:07] afraid to enforce them
[1:16:11] are you with me amen exactly right the
[1:16:14] the path this is what the palestinian
[1:16:16] and the devil knows
[1:16:18] when you step on the promise of god all
[1:16:20] he has to do is make a bunch of noise
[1:16:22] ride and start throwing missiles
[1:16:26] because why people will back up
[1:16:29] whoa yes ours
[1:16:34] it's our land it's our promise the word
[1:16:37] of god is ours
[1:16:39] but that word is worthless when you're
[1:16:42] afraid to enforce it
[1:16:47] i want you to look what happened with
[1:16:48] the with the blm movement
[1:16:51] it's a homosexual anti-nuclear family
[1:16:53] movement
[1:16:55] where they're you know um
[1:16:58] they're against the nuclear family which
[1:17:00] is where a father is in the home and
[1:17:02] it's based on christian principles
[1:17:06] and you look at their movement what do
[1:17:08] they learn
[1:17:09] right burn loot
[1:17:12] while the police stand helplessly buy
[1:17:15] not backed up by mayors and
[1:17:18] governors teaching their people to
[1:17:20] resist
[1:17:22] authority and a risk as resist arrest
[1:17:25] and if you get killed what happens to
[1:17:27] you if you get killed you get
[1:17:29] memorials built in your honor
[1:17:33] you get streets named after you
[1:17:36] you you get memorials that are and
[1:17:39] towers that are builds and signs that
[1:17:41] are put up
[1:17:42] in your honor and even though your life
[1:17:44] was a crime-ridden life
[1:17:47] millions of dollars will be paid to you
[1:17:49] your family
[1:17:50] even though you're a career criminal
[1:17:54] and they learn they learn this and the
[1:17:56] devil knows too that riot's work
[1:18:00] just put your foot on a promise to take
[1:18:02] authority and a preeminence on a promise
[1:18:04] to
[1:18:05] er and you'll watch the devil how
[1:18:08] scream riot he'll deny you possession if
[1:18:12] he can
[1:18:13] of the promise with the support of the
[1:18:17] whole world behind him
[1:18:24] let me just tell you heaven's supreme
[1:18:27] court has taken the seals off of the
[1:18:29] ancient records
[1:18:33] and it shows plainly that the throne is
[1:18:35] ours
[1:18:38] come on somebody help me preach now
[1:18:42] amen we're talking about satan being
[1:18:44] dethroned we're seeing him in a heavenly
[1:18:46] place the day in his
[1:18:48] it belongs to you the children of god
[1:18:51] where you stand in authority over every
[1:18:53] spirit over every enemy but he's there
[1:18:56] to resist you
[1:19:01] remember in the church ages
[1:19:05] and i kind of ended with this note the
[1:19:07] other day but what the church had at
[1:19:08] pentecost
[1:19:09] is her inalienable right originally she
[1:19:12] had the pure word of god she had the
[1:19:14] power of the spirit
[1:19:16] manifesting to die the signs and wonders
[1:19:18] and gifts of the holy ghost
[1:19:20] inalienable rights or rights that are
[1:19:23] unable to be
[1:19:24] taken away are given away
[1:19:28] amen you know i mean we we today
[1:19:32] we want to give away parts of the
[1:19:34] promise
[1:19:35] well you know we'll just give away we'll
[1:19:38] just give away the gifts of the spirit
[1:19:40] that's
[1:19:40] that's babyhood what are you talking
[1:19:43] about that's babyhood how can you plan
[1:19:46] on having the fuller word of god and
[1:19:47] some of it's missing
[1:19:50] how can you claim to be perfectly uh
[1:19:52] mature and built up in christ
[1:19:54] and yet some of it doesn't work it is
[1:19:57] ineffective in your life
[1:19:59] come on somebody i mean you can't give
[1:20:01] it away
[1:20:03] and i'm just going to tell you you
[1:20:04] cannot give any promise of god away
[1:20:07] whether it's healing or whether it's
[1:20:09] deliverance whether it's a gift of the
[1:20:11] spirit
[1:20:11] whether it's water baptism in jesus name
[1:20:14] if it's one god truth or whatever it is
[1:20:18] it can't be given away come on now
[1:20:21] amen and it and the devil is unable to
[1:20:25] take it away from us
[1:20:29] today what the church had at pentecost
[1:20:32] is still
[1:20:32] our inalienable right and cannot be
[1:20:35] taken away
[1:20:37] or given away by us as a possessor
[1:20:42] but when we began moving squatters from
[1:20:45] the land
[1:20:46] from our title deed inheritance that's
[1:20:49] when war begins
[1:20:52] i want you to know brother branham
[1:20:54] placed the rapture right here
[1:20:57] revelation 12 and 7 and there was war
[1:21:00] in heaven michael and his angels fought
[1:21:03] against the dragon
[1:21:04] and the dragon fought in his angels and
[1:21:06] prevailed not neither was their place
[1:21:09] found
[1:21:09] any more in heaven and brother branham
[1:21:11] ties
[1:21:12] this to the rapture in the second seal
[1:21:15] and the fourth seal he tells us clearly
[1:21:18] that when satan is cast down here in
[1:21:20] revelation 12
[1:21:21] the bride goes up
[1:21:25] so what you're seeing by the casting
[1:21:27] down of satan you are also seeing there
[1:21:29] the ascendant of the bride that's why
[1:21:32] you're
[1:21:33] hearing there there when satan is cast
[1:21:35] down there is
[1:21:37] rejoicing in heaven why is it
[1:21:40] is because the the saints have taken
[1:21:43] their position
[1:21:44] there and so so again
[1:21:48] we you know the rapture itself is a
[1:21:50] battle it's a war
[1:21:57] you're not on a picnic you're not here
[1:22:00] for somebody to feed you cheerios and
[1:22:03] spoon-feed you
[1:22:05] applesauce you're not babies anymore
[1:22:08] you're sons and daughters of god you're
[1:22:11] here to take your inheritance
[1:22:14] amen it's you know it's time you know
[1:22:17] where
[1:22:17] where the churches be got to be diapered
[1:22:19] and their messes cleaned up and bottle
[1:22:21] fed
[1:22:21] that should be over with we should be
[1:22:23] mature sons and daughters of god now
[1:22:26] amen now so what in the world was satan
[1:22:30] doing in heaven how did he get there
[1:22:32] and whose place did he have there
[1:22:35] i'd like you to turn with me to ezekiel
[1:22:37] 28
[1:22:39] verse 12 and because he was once the
[1:22:42] anointed cherub
[1:22:43] it covered it's perfect in all his way
[1:22:46] until iniquity was found in him
[1:22:49] verse 12 says son of man take up a
[1:22:51] lamentation unto the king of tires now
[1:22:54] i want to just give you something here
[1:22:56] he's speaking
[1:22:58] to a man on the earth but he's
[1:23:01] addressing the spirit that is in him
[1:23:05] because the man is in all of this that
[1:23:07] the bible says it's the spirit that he's
[1:23:09] talking to
[1:23:11] remember when he's addressing this king
[1:23:14] he is addressing the spirit behind it
[1:23:17] and he said take this lamentation upon
[1:23:19] the king of paris and say in him
[1:23:21] thus saith the lord thou sealeth that
[1:23:23] the son
[1:23:24] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[1:23:26] thou hast been in eden the garden of god
[1:23:29] every precious stone was that covered
[1:23:31] the sardis the
[1:23:32] topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx
[1:23:35] the
[1:23:35] the jasper the sapphire the emerald and
[1:23:37] the carbuncle and the gold
[1:23:39] and the workmanship of that tablets and
[1:23:41] all thy pipes was crea
[1:23:43] was prepared in the in the day that that
[1:23:45] was created
[1:23:46] thou art the anointed cherub that
[1:23:49] covereth
[1:23:50] and this is what satan's original
[1:23:52] position
[1:23:53] was in the heavens he was a protector
[1:23:57] of the word brother branham would call
[1:23:59] him
[1:24:00] you know god's right-hand man
[1:24:05] all but a creator
[1:24:08] and he was there to like all angels are
[1:24:12] to see that the word is carried out
[1:24:15] that the word is kept pure angels are
[1:24:18] messengers and messengers
[1:24:21] you know can't be a true message and the
[1:24:22] messenger unless they're telling what
[1:24:24] the real message was
[1:24:26] hey man any messenger that has his own
[1:24:28] message or embellishes
[1:24:30] or changes it is not a true messenger
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:34] so you see he said thou art the anointed
[1:24:36] cherub that covet and i have set thee so
[1:24:38] thou has walked upon the holy mountain
[1:24:41] of god
[1:24:42] that was walked up and down in the midst
[1:24:43] of the stones of fire
[1:24:45] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[1:24:47] day that that was created
[1:24:48] till iniquity was found in me
[1:24:52] so now notice again you know there
[1:24:56] there was this time where where that
[1:24:59] he was the anointed cherub that covered
[1:25:03] but then iniquity was found in him
[1:25:06] going with me to isaiah 14 12. howard
[1:25:09] thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer
[1:25:11] son of the morning how could the art
[1:25:13] thou cut down to the ground
[1:25:15] which didn't weaken the nations for thou
[1:25:19] hast said in thine heart i
[1:25:22] will ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[1:25:25] star
[1:25:25] my throne above the stars of god i will
[1:25:28] sit upon the mount of the congregation
[1:25:29] and the sides of the north
[1:25:31] i will ascend above the heights of the
[1:25:33] cloud i will be
[1:25:34] like the most high
[1:25:38] how many wants to be like jesus that's
[1:25:40] not what lucifer wanted
[1:25:42] he wanted worship i'll be like the most
[1:25:46] high i'm going to exalt myself this is
[1:25:48] where
[1:25:48] it is found fulfilled in 2 thessalonians
[1:25:51] where he sits in the temple of god
[1:25:53] worshipped as god
[1:25:55] are you with me convincing all that he's
[1:25:58] god
[1:25:58] but i want you to know where he here's
[1:26:01] the ultimate end
[1:26:02] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[1:26:06] to the sides of the pit
[1:26:10] he's got a scheme he's got a plan and
[1:26:12] he's been working now for thousands of
[1:26:14] years
[1:26:15] and he's he's he's got his skills all
[1:26:18] honed
[1:26:19] because he's worked against men down
[1:26:21] through the ages
[1:26:29] but notice he was cast out of heaven
[1:26:33] but now we see in revelation 12 verse
[1:26:36] 9 he's cast out of heaven again
[1:26:39] but how did he get back into heaven
[1:26:42] that's the million dollar question he
[1:26:45] got cast out
[1:26:48] and he come to the earth walked in eden
[1:26:50] in the very garden of god
[1:26:53] but how how was it when he got cast out
[1:26:57] and that he wound up getting back and
[1:26:59] the great dragon was cast out
[1:27:01] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:27:04] satan which deceiveth the whole world he
[1:27:05] was cast out in the earth
[1:27:06] his angels cast out with him so here in
[1:27:09] revelation
[1:27:10] he's in heaven but he's not i want you
[1:27:13] to notice he's not
[1:27:14] a garden a guardian cherub
[1:27:17] with wings spread over the word i mean
[1:27:20] he is a
[1:27:21] tormentor he is called a
[1:27:24] devil that's a tormentor he is accusing
[1:27:27] the brethren
[1:27:29] and by accusations and by bluffing you
[1:27:32] trying to take you and keep you from
[1:27:35] your rightful position
[1:27:37] of authority of sinship
[1:27:43] now you want to ask the question well
[1:27:44] how did he get back in the heavens after
[1:27:46] being cast down in the first rebellion
[1:27:50] because the bible said his tale through
[1:27:51] the third part of the stars
[1:27:54] so not only did he fall but his angels
[1:27:56] fell with him and then we find out
[1:27:58] here again he gets back into heaven
[1:28:01] somehow
[1:28:02] it's kind of a mystery isn't it i mean
[1:28:05] he's cast out in the beginning and now
[1:28:07] in the end
[1:28:08] he's got to be cast out again well how
[1:28:10] did he get back
[1:28:12] well you see he had been cast out the
[1:28:16] heavens and he comes to the earth
[1:28:20] looking far away back
[1:28:23] now he is the tree of death in the
[1:28:26] garden of eden
[1:28:28] and by his anointing upon the serpent
[1:28:32] who was a beast
[1:28:33] that could talk he was not a reptile
[1:28:37] but his upright creature at the top of
[1:28:38] the animal world being the most subtle
[1:28:41] the most shrewd sensible intelligent
[1:28:44] beast of the field notice he's a beast
[1:28:47] not a reptile
[1:28:48] he could reason he could talk
[1:28:52] amen and the devil using this serpent
[1:28:57] anointing this serpent this one we're
[1:28:59] calling the serpent the beast
[1:29:02] we think of the serpent now a snake
[1:29:04] that's crawling he was no snake in the
[1:29:06] tree
[1:29:07] and man it was it was an upright
[1:29:10] creature he
[1:29:10] cursed him and said on your belly you'll
[1:29:12] you'll crawl the rest of your life
[1:29:15] what good was it do just curse him if
[1:29:17] he's already on his belly
[1:29:19] right he was an upright creature he's
[1:29:21] standing there he could reason he could
[1:29:23] talk
[1:29:25] he could be convinced with cunning words
[1:29:28] and come to come to eve now notice and
[1:29:31] and using the serpent he convinces eve
[1:29:35] that she'll be as wise as god
[1:29:39] now notice the whole spirit of the devil
[1:29:41] is for preeminence
[1:29:43] it's to exalt himself you watch a person
[1:29:46] always wanting to exalt themselves
[1:29:49] you watch a preacher always craving the
[1:29:52] position and
[1:29:53] exalting you'll see a satanic anointing
[1:29:56] is what you'll see
[1:29:58] you see the devil was used in there and
[1:30:01] and he convinces he that she'll be as
[1:30:03] wise as god and
[1:30:05] knowing good and evil well
[1:30:08] she was already his god she was a
[1:30:11] daughter of god come on
[1:30:13] she was adam was made in the image of
[1:30:16] god
[1:30:17] and and she already knew the good
[1:30:20] everything god had ever done was good
[1:30:23] the whole world
[1:30:24] when he made it and he said and he
[1:30:25] finished all his creation he said oh
[1:30:28] it's very good
[1:30:30] and she knew evil
[1:30:33] it was now personified
[1:30:36] in the tree of knowledge
[1:30:40] and it was evil that satan offered her
[1:30:43] to know
[1:30:44] he got her to doubt her position
[1:30:48] i want you to catch a key there
[1:30:51] she was already positioned
[1:30:55] but he got her to doubt her position
[1:30:59] to question to question now
[1:31:02] uh you know that and and wanting to
[1:31:05] push herself out into an area
[1:31:08] into a realm that she didn't belong in
[1:31:12] are you with me now and so he gives her
[1:31:14] to doubt her position and she fell i
[1:31:16] mean come on
[1:31:17] it's like the stars that are in heaven
[1:31:19] get one of them off its path
[1:31:21] get one of them moving out of its cycle
[1:31:25] and what will happen it'll crash into
[1:31:26] another and crash into another and crash
[1:31:28] into another and first thing you know
[1:31:30] the whole universe would be
[1:31:31] in chaos but god's got every one of them
[1:31:34] hung in a certain place in a certain
[1:31:36] orbit
[1:31:38] are you with me now amen now so
[1:31:42] again it was it was here that
[1:31:45] satan offered her knowledge and got her
[1:31:49] to
[1:31:50] doubt her position you know trying to
[1:31:53] bring
[1:31:54] something that was better than what god
[1:31:56] said
[1:31:58] now remember this is exactly where our
[1:32:00] contest is
[1:32:01] we have to cast down every high thing
[1:32:06] that exalts itself against the word of
[1:32:08] god i don't care if it's a doctor's
[1:32:10] report
[1:32:11] we take what god's word said over what
[1:32:14] the doctor said
[1:32:15] the doctor he's telling you what he
[1:32:17] knows as far as what his signs can tell
[1:32:20] him
[1:32:20] but he's not the ultimate he's not the
[1:32:23] final say
[1:32:25] he's not the authority god is the
[1:32:28] authority
[1:32:29] amen there is there is no devil can take
[1:32:32] your life
[1:32:33] until god is through with you
[1:32:36] satan can only go so far he's limited
[1:32:40] i want you to know you're dealing with a
[1:32:42] limited
[1:32:43] devil he does not have supreme power
[1:32:46] he doesn't have supreme control he's not
[1:32:49] in control of your situation
[1:32:52] he's not in control of my home he's not
[1:32:54] in control of my wife's health
[1:32:56] he's not in control of me he's not in
[1:32:58] control of my health
[1:33:00] he's not in control of the church he's
[1:33:03] not in control of the bride of jesus
[1:33:04] christ
[1:33:05] he is not in control there is a god in
[1:33:08] heaven
[1:33:09] and he's the one that's in control
[1:33:14] hallelujah now
[1:33:18] adam was not the seed but he was also in
[1:33:21] the transgression
[1:33:23] when he took his wife quickly to himself
[1:33:26] now the discovery of their nakedness
[1:33:28] learned from the servant calls
[1:33:30] eve to bring forth from the serpent
[1:33:34] that knowledge that she learned the
[1:33:36] discovery of nakedness
[1:33:38] caused her to bring forth cain who was
[1:33:41] that wicked one
[1:33:43] and then through that knowledge
[1:33:46] she brought to adam and they brought
[1:33:49] forth
[1:33:50] abel now in doing this
[1:33:54] adam's fall decreed that every child of
[1:33:58] his
[1:33:58] would be born of sexual birth
[1:34:03] and and so they would be born of sexual
[1:34:06] knowledge that was taught to them by the
[1:34:08] serpent that made them realize they were
[1:34:10] naked
[1:34:11] and then every human child born would
[1:34:14] now be
[1:34:14] born with sins nature having preeminence
[1:34:18] and ruling over them and all would be
[1:34:22] born wrong
[1:34:23] and would have to be born again
[1:34:27] and the only way that salvation could
[1:34:29] come was one we born without sex
[1:34:32] without the original sin come on and
[1:34:35] would be born there
[1:34:36] of the spoken word and when he came
[1:34:39] forth
[1:34:40] he was not under the rule and dominion
[1:34:43] of satan
[1:34:44] satan had no control over him he said
[1:34:47] the
[1:34:47] that that's that satan has come and he
[1:34:50] had found no place in me
[1:34:52] he don't have a right to me anymore at
[1:34:55] all
[1:34:56] he never did have now so all
[1:34:59] all of us was born that was in nature
[1:35:02] having preeminence
[1:35:03] we would all be born wrong and we would
[1:35:06] have to be born again
[1:35:08] and this would cause our fall from
[1:35:11] immortality
[1:35:12] to mortality now subjugated and
[1:35:16] brought under satan's dominion satan as
[1:35:19] adam rather could no longer rule from
[1:35:22] the heavenly realms
[1:35:24] but only through strength and human
[1:35:28] strength and human intellect and and his
[1:35:30] abilities could he rule the earth
[1:35:33] and adam and all of mankind came
[1:35:37] under satan's lordship
[1:35:41] but satan is not the true owner of the
[1:35:44] earth
[1:35:45] he didn't create it it wasn't created
[1:35:48] for him
[1:35:50] he is a squatter on the earth and he's
[1:35:53] even the squatter
[1:35:54] on your body your body of this earth
[1:35:57] come on your earthly body
[1:35:58] amen in his death and his mortality
[1:36:02] reigns within our mortal frame
[1:36:07] now from then on every time the sons of
[1:36:10] god appears
[1:36:13] satan appears with him
[1:36:17] what's this in the book of job turn with
[1:36:20] me jobs one and six
[1:36:22] when the sons of god appear
[1:36:25] satan's right there with him
[1:36:29] what is he there for accuse him
[1:36:32] what's what he's he's the accuser
[1:36:36] he is finding fault as to why
[1:36:39] job should not be considered a perfect
[1:36:42] man
[1:36:43] why he shouldn't have authority so now
[1:36:46] there's a battle going on
[1:36:48] god says he's perfect come on
[1:36:52] amen satan says but i can make him curse
[1:36:55] you
[1:36:56] so there is a war that goes on and it
[1:36:58] winds up in job's body
[1:37:01] and it depends now on which one job
[1:37:03] believes as to what wins
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:08] and as long as job is accusing god
[1:37:11] of his problem and not getting his eyes
[1:37:14] on who the real problem
[1:37:15] is then the devil is winning
[1:37:20] but when job gets his eyes on the
[1:37:22] redeemer
[1:37:25] when he gets his eyes on the promise and
[1:37:27] he says
[1:37:28] i know my redeemer liver and i know
[1:37:31] america if it means that i come for
[1:37:35] that i go through all of this and be
[1:37:37] purged i will come forth
[1:37:38] as pure gold
[1:37:43] all the beating that the devil is going
[1:37:44] to do to me is going to just
[1:37:47] beat the impurities out of me
[1:37:50] like the beaten gold now
[1:37:55] look there come a day when the sons of
[1:37:57] god came to present himself and satan
[1:37:59] came also among them now what right
[1:38:03] did satan have among the sons of god
[1:38:06] it was because of the fall then the lord
[1:38:09] said to satan
[1:38:10] where comes that where you been
[1:38:14] and he said from going to and fro and
[1:38:16] through the earth from walking up and
[1:38:18] down in it
[1:38:19] now the earth don't belong to him
[1:38:22] it wasn't made for him it wasn't created
[1:38:24] for him
[1:38:25] he wasn't created for the earth
[1:38:28] come on somebody the earth belongs to
[1:38:31] god
[1:38:33] it's to be the place that he will dwell
[1:38:35] in the great new jerusalem ahead
[1:38:38] it's god's dwelling place is that right
[1:38:41] and he put man to have dominion over it
[1:38:44] but he never gave the devil that
[1:38:46] but man did through the fall now notice
[1:38:50] and so he says i come from going to and
[1:38:52] fro through the earth
[1:38:54] walking up and down in it as tormentor
[1:38:56] he walks to and fro
[1:38:58] he stirs up stripes and nations he's
[1:39:00] trying to stirs up strife and family
[1:39:03] strife in the weather with typhoons and
[1:39:06] floods and hurricanes and destruction
[1:39:10] think about this the nature that adam
[1:39:13] once controlled
[1:39:17] now controls and dominates his thoughts
[1:39:20] his plans towards his efforts
[1:39:23] freezes burns brings torments of famine
[1:39:28] and destruction all of this happens
[1:39:31] under satanic lordship over mankind in
[1:39:34] his earthly home
[1:39:36] in the book of zechariah we find that
[1:39:38] when joshua the high priest
[1:39:40] appears before god and satan is at his
[1:39:42] right hand to oppose him look at
[1:39:44] zechariah 3 1.
[1:39:45] the lord and he showed me joshua the
[1:39:47] high priest standing before the angel
[1:39:49] lord and
[1:39:49] satan standing at his right hand
[1:39:53] to resist him amen
[1:39:56] so here here again sons of god appeared
[1:39:59] before god
[1:40:00] and you would read the book of zechariah
[1:40:02] he would he would dress and put the fair
[1:40:04] minor on him put clean garments upon him
[1:40:06] all these things preparing him
[1:40:08] for the presence of god right but you
[1:40:11] see when
[1:40:12] but when he goes to appear before god
[1:40:15] satan is there at his right hand
[1:40:19] to resist him
[1:40:22] let me tell you you can't pray a prayer
[1:40:26] without there being war in heaven
[1:40:30] you cannot start toward a promise
[1:40:33] without the devil standing there to
[1:40:35] resist you
[1:40:37] those of you seeking for the baptism of
[1:40:40] the holy ghost
[1:40:41] you can't walk toward that promise
[1:40:43] without the devil telling you
[1:40:44] it ain't for you or it ain't real
[1:40:48] or it won't happen to me that way
[1:40:56] now let me tell you jesus is no
[1:40:58] exception
[1:41:00] as the first one filled with the spirit
[1:41:02] who the spirit indwells now not just
[1:41:04] simply anoints but he
[1:41:06] dwelt him jesus having received his
[1:41:08] position of sonship
[1:41:11] when heaven opened i want you to notice
[1:41:14] heaven open and the atmosphere like
[1:41:18] a dub of heaven came down in him
[1:41:21] i want you to get this amen jesus there
[1:41:25] was told this is my beloved son
[1:41:29] in whom i'm well pleased this is the son
[1:41:32] i love
[1:41:33] this is my son you see that's what the
[1:41:36] baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:41:38] it's not you recognizing god it's god
[1:41:41] recognizing you
[1:41:44] when you come to the altar and you
[1:41:46] accept christ as your savior you're
[1:41:47] accepting christ
[1:41:48] but when you get the holy ghost that's
[1:41:50] christ accepting you
[1:41:52] that's when he recognizes your faith
[1:41:59] now jesus having received his position
[1:42:03] of sonship
[1:42:04] when heaven opened and was recognized as
[1:42:07] god's son
[1:42:08] the tempter comes down accusing now here
[1:42:11] comes the fight
[1:42:13] look with me in matthew chapter 4 verse
[1:42:16] 3
[1:42:17] and the tempter came to him look he just
[1:42:19] been baptized
[1:42:21] with the holy ghost
[1:42:26] let me just say this if you're a holy
[1:42:28] ghost-filled person today
[1:42:30] god isn't afraid of the devil
[1:42:34] he isn't afraid of any trial you go
[1:42:36] through
[1:42:37] he isn't afraid that you're going to
[1:42:39] cave in
[1:42:40] that you're going to throw in the towel
[1:42:42] and quit he knows you're going to
[1:42:44] prevail
[1:42:46] come on somebody amen the matthew there
[1:42:50] says
[1:42:50] the chapter came to him and said if
[1:42:53] thou be the son of god command these
[1:42:56] stones
[1:42:57] to be made bread in other words prove it
[1:42:59] you gotta you know
[1:43:00] try to prove it to me and the and every
[1:43:04] time that he comes as a chapter
[1:43:06] he comes questioning his sonship
[1:43:09] if you're the son questioning his
[1:43:12] position
[1:43:14] here jesus now just now baptized with
[1:43:17] the holy ghost
[1:43:18] the spirit comes in and dwells him and
[1:43:20] the moment that he does
[1:43:22] here comes lucifer
[1:43:27] trying to jesus to doubt
[1:43:30] i'm trying to get something to you
[1:43:35] when you take a promise of the word of
[1:43:37] god
[1:43:38] the devil's going to come with every
[1:43:40] kind of accusation
[1:43:42] he's going to tell you you're not a son
[1:43:44] you're not a daughter
[1:43:45] you don't belong to god see it might be
[1:43:49] for some people but it ain't for you
[1:43:51] you've done blasphemed the holy ghost or
[1:43:53] has done something and he'll never come
[1:43:55] to you
[1:43:56] he'll do everything he can to keep you
[1:43:59] from the promise
[1:44:01] he'll throw fear on you doubt on you
[1:44:04] unbelief
[1:44:04] he'll cover you in every way that he can
[1:44:07] and jesus had to fight satan in order
[1:44:11] to operate as a son from the heavenly
[1:44:13] realm it was
[1:44:14] war his position was
[1:44:17] was questioned the very moment he stood
[1:44:20] into his position of sonship
[1:44:23] a man he was questioned because though
[1:44:26] he was a son of god
[1:44:28] his dominion only was in recognizing who
[1:44:32] he was don't let that go over your head
[1:44:36] because though you're a son of god your
[1:44:38] dominion only lies and you
[1:44:40] recognizing who you are
[1:44:44] i am a blood wash bloodbath son or
[1:44:47] daughter of the living god
[1:44:49] and the devil has no right to me
[1:44:54] he has no right to my home he has no
[1:44:57] right to my life
[1:44:58] he has no right to my spiritual walk he
[1:45:01] has no right to me
[1:45:04] i am a son of god i don't belong to the
[1:45:07] devil
[1:45:07] i belong to god that's who i belong to
[1:45:11] i was purchased by the blood of jesus
[1:45:16] and satan has no power over me unless i
[1:45:20] give it
[1:45:20] that's right
[1:45:27] but it's not mine to give away
[1:45:34] now jesus dominion was
[1:45:37] only in recognizing who he was and
[1:45:39] operating
[1:45:41] as a son of god with power and authority
[1:45:43] from his position of head
[1:45:45] of sonship in the heavens now
[1:45:49] would god's word have preeminence
[1:45:52] here's the battle with jesus would god's
[1:45:55] word add preeminence
[1:45:56] what god said to him or would satan's
[1:46:00] doubt have preeminence
[1:46:03] here's the war which one is he going to
[1:46:06] give preeminence to
[1:46:08] here's this one coming with his dark
[1:46:10] depression
[1:46:11] his evil spirit haunting coming down
[1:46:15] you could see it in the spiritual realm
[1:46:18] maybe it was like a dark cloud maybe it
[1:46:21] was a disfigured
[1:46:23] figure may i don't know what it was like
[1:46:27] but here he comes haunting breathing
[1:46:29] right down
[1:46:30] on him if you are the son of god
[1:46:36] if you're really who you say you are
[1:46:40] if you're really a son prove it
[1:46:44] but jesus didn't have nothing to prove
[1:46:46] to the devil
[1:46:48] and trying to prove to the devil he
[1:46:50] would have only been doubting his own
[1:46:52] position
[1:46:54] are you with me amen so it was with
[1:46:56] god's word that preeminence or would
[1:46:58] satan's doubt have reminisce
[1:46:59] now jesus knowing his authority and his
[1:47:02] position
[1:47:03] cast out devils by his authority of
[1:47:06] sonship
[1:47:08] taken his position in the word he healed
[1:47:10] the sick
[1:47:11] by the authority of his sonship he
[1:47:14] literally
[1:47:14] brought heaven's rule to earth
[1:47:18] let me show you matthew chapter 4 verse
[1:47:20] 23
[1:47:21] jesus went about all galilee teaching in
[1:47:24] their synagogue
[1:47:25] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[1:47:27] healing
[1:47:28] all manners of sickness and all manner
[1:47:30] of diseases
[1:47:32] among the people what was he doing he
[1:47:34] was bringing heaven down
[1:47:37] hallelujah heaven's rule began now
[1:47:39] casting out the devils
[1:47:41] casting out sickness casting out
[1:47:44] maniac spirits casting out seven devils
[1:47:48] of mary magdalene
[1:47:49] casting out come on healing the sick
[1:47:53] that's right hallelujah he could so
[1:47:56] wrong rule in that realm he could call a
[1:47:59] man
[1:48:00] that had traveled four days journey from
[1:48:04] his body
[1:48:05] back in just a moment's time
[1:48:09] and raise him up from the dead his name
[1:48:11] was lazarus
[1:48:12] are you with me in luke 10 we see that
[1:48:15] jesus
[1:48:15] authorized 70 to act by the authority
[1:48:18] of his position here's what you can do
[1:48:22] now remember he he said you can act by
[1:48:24] the authority of
[1:48:25] my position
[1:48:28] by acting in my name i'm going to send
[1:48:32] you out to act
[1:48:33] in my position luke chapter 10
[1:48:36] verse 9 and heal the sick that are
[1:48:39] therein and say to them the kingdom of
[1:48:41] god
[1:48:42] or the rule of god has come nigh to you
[1:48:46] right when the sick are healed it's a
[1:48:49] battle in the unseen
[1:48:51] heavenly in that unseen heavenly realm
[1:48:54] and it's there when satan falls
[1:48:56] as a believer takes god's word and
[1:49:00] conquers look at verse 17 and the
[1:49:03] seventy returned again with joy saying
[1:49:05] lord even the devils are subject unto us
[1:49:09] through thy name and he said unto them
[1:49:12] thou i beheld satan as
[1:49:14] lightning fall from heaven
[1:49:18] can't you can't you get it yes sir he
[1:49:20] would say
[1:49:21] yeah i saw it i saw it that they were
[1:49:24] subject to my name
[1:49:25] he said i saw the great battle in the
[1:49:28] spirit realm
[1:49:30] and i saw every devil that you conquered
[1:49:33] and i saw it like satan fallen from
[1:49:35] heaven
[1:49:37] i saw when you believed in my name
[1:49:40] and when you proclaimed my name and you
[1:49:43] took
[1:49:43] authority i saw the devil had the vow to
[1:49:46] that
[1:49:46] and fall from that position and i saw
[1:49:49] healing take place
[1:49:50] and i saw deliverance take place i saw
[1:49:53] miracles take place
[1:49:54] because satan was cast out
[1:50:01] behold verse 19 i give you power
[1:50:07] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[1:50:10] over every power
[1:50:11] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[1:50:14] shall by any means hurt you
[1:50:16] notwithstanding and disrejoice not that
[1:50:18] the spirits are subject to you
[1:50:20] but rather rejoice because your names
[1:50:23] are
[1:50:24] written in heaven rejoice because
[1:50:27] this shows your authority in the
[1:50:30] heavenly places
[1:50:32] this authority is with me through my
[1:50:34] name
[1:50:36] amen now listen this war if you go with
[1:50:40] me to ephesians 6
[1:50:41] 10 you'll see what i'm talking about it
[1:50:43] says finally my brother be strong in the
[1:50:45] lord and the power of his might
[1:50:47] put on the whole armor of god what is a
[1:50:49] good world is a armor for if you're not
[1:50:51] going to fight
[1:50:53] you're just going to parade
[1:50:57] that you may be able to stand against
[1:50:59] the wiles of the devil
[1:51:02] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:51:04] blood but against principalities is
[1:51:06] against powers
[1:51:07] against rulers of darkness of this world
[1:51:11] against spiritual wickedness
[1:51:12] in high places do you know what that
[1:51:15] word is
[1:51:16] heavenly places it's exact same greek
[1:51:19] word
[1:51:19] is where he says in ephesians 1 and he
[1:51:22] have made us to sit in heavenly places
[1:51:25] but i want you to notice here that there
[1:51:28] is spiritual wickedness
[1:51:30] in high places or heavenly places
[1:51:34] amen so he says you're gonna have to
[1:51:37] fight to have dominion
[1:51:39] you want dominion over disease you want
[1:51:41] dominion over sin you want dominion over
[1:51:43] affliction

[1:51:54] i'm preparing you from head to toe
[1:51:57] and i want you to fight and you're going
[1:52:00] to fight

[1:52:24] body i'm going to work through

[1:52:29] now i'm showing you what i'm going to do
[1:52:30] in the bride body
[1:52:34] take your position you see
[1:52:37] he says we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:52:39] blood but against principalities against
[1:52:41] powers
[1:52:42] against the rulers against satan himself
[1:52:47] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:52:50] against spiritual wickedness in heavenly
[1:52:54] places
[1:52:56] spiritual wickedness that opposes you as
[1:52:58] you take
[1:52:59] your position of sonship
[1:53:02] wherefore taking you the whole armor of
[1:53:04] god that you may be able to withstand
[1:53:06] in the evil day and having all done all
[1:53:09] to stand
[1:53:11] what stand
[1:53:14] don't be a quitter don't run you know

[1:53:18] stand but keep standing there
[1:53:21] come on now keep that sword out don't
[1:53:24] turn
[1:53:24] and run don't back up from the promise
[1:53:27] it's
[1:53:28] god he possessed it with his own blood
[1:53:30] he
[1:53:31] paid for it do not let a position that
[1:53:34] jesus paid for
[1:53:36] escaping from you it's your promise
[1:53:39] dress yourself for war
[1:53:41] do all yours can do to stand stand
[1:53:43] therefore having your loins gird about
[1:53:46] with the truth
[1:53:47] having the breastplate of righteousness
[1:53:49] having your feet shot with the
[1:53:50] preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:53:52] and above all taking the shield of faith
[1:53:54] whereby
[1:53:55] we're with you shall be able to quench
[1:53:57] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:53:58] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:54:00] sword the spirit which is the word of
[1:54:02] god
[1:54:02] praying always with all prayer and
[1:54:04] supplication of the spirit
[1:54:05] and watching there too with all
[1:54:07] perseverance that means not giving up
[1:54:10] and supplications for all saints
[1:54:13] amen so what are you doing you're
[1:54:15] bringing in heaven's atmosphere and the
[1:54:18] power of faith
[1:54:19] into the church where all things are
[1:54:22] possible
[1:54:24] like i told the brothers from russia the
[1:54:26] other day if you want
[1:54:27] healing you got to preach healing you
[1:54:29] want faith in the church you got to
[1:54:31] preach faith
[1:54:32] you want to see miracles you got to
[1:54:33] preach miracles and
[1:54:35] whatever it is you gotta preach it
[1:54:37] remember because faith comes by hearing
[1:54:39] i hear the word of god
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:45] so what are you doing you're bringing
[1:54:46] heaven's atmosphere that that's exactly
[1:54:48] why when satan attacked one of our
[1:54:50] sisters their
[1:54:51] sister atlanta there immediately when
[1:54:54] she come down with that cancer i
[1:54:55] immediately began to preach faith every
[1:54:57] service
[1:54:58] faith faith faith faith faith
[1:55:02] faith what was i doing building her up
[1:55:04] for victory
[1:55:06] building the church up to believe for
[1:55:07] victory amen
[1:55:09] and that one as well caused another
[1:55:10] victory and another victory
[1:55:12] and another victory and we're not
[1:55:13] through
[1:55:16] hallelujah we're not thrilled there's
[1:55:18] more battles to win
[1:55:20] there's more enemies to be conquered
[1:55:22] amen the enemy is already a defeated
[1:55:24] enemy jesus defeated him with calgary
[1:55:28] hallelujah we know he's the squatter on
[1:55:30] the land
[1:55:32] he doesn't have a right to it he does it
[1:55:34] it's not his possession
[1:55:39] so what are you doing when you believe
[1:55:40] you're starting to bring heaven's
[1:55:42] atmosphere and power of faith into the
[1:55:45] church where all things are possible
[1:55:48] you're bringing heaven down to the earth
[1:55:52] brother branham said this in a wedding
[1:55:54] supper he said then you say
[1:55:56] well we'll gather in his name speaking
[1:55:59] the name
[1:56:00] of jesus by word is not what he meant
[1:56:04] so much is the attitude that you're
[1:56:07] gathered in
[1:56:08] the environment of the name of jesus
[1:56:13] when you gather in my name then ask what
[1:56:15] you will it's the motive that you come
[1:56:16] in the attitude is the attitude
[1:56:18] instead of so much calling the name
[1:56:20] sinners call them that name on the
[1:56:21] street and curse it and everything else
[1:56:23] but it's the environment or the
[1:56:25] surrounding atmosphere that you're in
[1:56:27] the attitude that you come coming in the
[1:56:30] name of jesus
[1:56:32] amen do you realize when you come in the
[1:56:34] name of jesus
[1:56:36] are you with me it represents
[1:56:41] every redemptive work that he done
[1:56:46] amen the healing that was wrong in
[1:56:48] calvary the deliverance of salvation
[1:56:51] everything when you when you call on the
[1:56:53] name of jesus you are calling
[1:56:55] on all the redemptive qualities
[1:56:58] of the name of jesus christ
[1:57:03] with some mercy's faith he said now you
[1:57:05] find out those atmospheres
[1:57:08] when you get whenever where faith is
[1:57:10] taught in the church
[1:57:11] you'll find a church in that atmosphere
[1:57:13] that's right
[1:57:14] oh god let me get this to you you see it
[1:57:17] see that's the reason
[1:57:18] people come among the saints
[1:57:21] where they're praying and where they're
[1:57:22] believing paul didn't find any
[1:57:25] in the city only timothy that was like a
[1:57:27] precious faith he had you know the rest
[1:57:29] of him was all denominationless but
[1:57:31] when he got into that atmosphere you
[1:57:34] find things
[1:57:35] coming on that atmosphere was created
[1:57:38] you find people living by faith
[1:57:42] when you get into a place where it says
[1:57:44] my
[1:57:45] why the bible is true god heals
[1:57:48] and you walk around their congregation
[1:57:50] and you find while i was dying with
[1:57:52] cancer
[1:57:53] i was healed i was once blind
[1:57:56] i see and the stranger says
[1:57:59] my why what do you mean what's the
[1:58:01] matter with you i'll show you my record
[1:58:03] come on with me
[1:58:04] come eat dinner with me i'll show you i
[1:58:06] got a record up there
[1:58:07] my neighbors know that i was this kind
[1:58:09] of condition i was paralyzed for years i
[1:58:11] was prayed for
[1:58:12] what is it that word in that church that
[1:58:15] group of believers
[1:58:16] has created that atmosphere
[1:58:21] amen you realize you this morning have
[1:58:23] the power
[1:58:24] to bring heaven down amen to create an
[1:58:28] atmosphere of heavenly places
[1:58:31] where miracles take place where healing
[1:58:33] takes place
[1:58:34] where salvation takes place what joy
[1:58:37] comes come on
[1:58:39] don't fuss us at us about our joy and
[1:58:42] our
[1:58:42] shouting and our dancing in the spirit
[1:58:45] heaven came down
[1:58:46] my goodness if ever never comes down in
[1:58:48] your soul like that
[1:58:50] it'll get your methodist foot patterned
[1:58:52] too and you'll begin to rejoice and get
[1:58:54] out in the spirit too
[1:59:00] hallelujah see that word
[1:59:03] in that church that group of believers
[1:59:07] has created that atmosphere
[1:59:11] he speaks about two atmospheres in
[1:59:13] wisdom versus faith
[1:59:15] he said how is the word in simplicity
[1:59:17] yet in its completion
[1:59:19] ever going to grow in a place where
[1:59:21] knowledge overshadows that
[1:59:22] and says it can't be so i want to ask
[1:59:24] that question
[1:59:26] i want to ask my brothers around the
[1:59:27] world how in the world is the word in
[1:59:31] its simplicity yet
[1:59:32] in its completion ever gonna grow to a
[1:59:36] place where
[1:59:37] where knowledge is overshadowing
[1:59:40] and that knowledge says it can't be so
[1:59:44] we're beyond that uh we got the perfect
[1:59:47] word and because we
[1:59:48] have the perfect word we no longer have
[1:59:51] uh
[1:59:52] the the gifts of the spirit we no longer
[1:59:54] have the promises that are there
[1:59:56] you know it it's a it's a minor not a
[1:59:59] major
[2:00:00] what have you got to major where's the
[2:00:01] miner
[2:00:04] how can you claim to have a perfect word
[2:00:06] and part of his mission
[2:00:09] when that which is perfect he's come
[2:00:10] then just having part is done away with
[2:00:14] so when we get the prayer when we have
[2:00:15] the perfect word then having just part
[2:00:17] of it
[2:00:18] is done away what was this message to do
[2:00:20] to bring you
[2:00:21] the word and his completion so well
[2:00:24] brother tim you know that's in past
[2:00:26] you know there was justification
[2:00:27] sanctification restoration of the gifts
[2:00:29] and we're beyond that oh you are well
[2:00:31] where are they
[2:00:35] well you know but that's all past you
[2:00:37] see john 14 12 was just for brother
[2:00:39] branham that's a lie
[2:00:41] and brother branham refuted that over
[2:00:42] and over again
[2:00:45] a demon from hell taught that
[2:00:48] ministers got under that anointing it's
[2:00:51] against the word of god
[2:00:53] the signs follow them that believe john
[2:00:56] 14 12 is your belief it's your
[2:00:59] your personal property every one of you
[2:01:02] come on now amen this is the word when
[2:01:06] faith is preached
[2:01:07] from the word brother branham said the
[2:01:10] children live where knowledge is
[2:01:11] preached
[2:01:12] from a seminary the children die
[2:01:16] and the same thing happened in the
[2:01:17] garden of eden that's what happened to
[2:01:19] them
[2:01:19] two atmospheres there when eve got off
[2:01:22] the right one on the wrong one she died
[2:01:25] and it'll do it every time
[2:01:26] so they cannot say you if your church
[2:01:28] has got that kind of atmosphere
[2:01:30] oh child if you want to live you believe
[2:01:34] the word
[2:01:36] so when man forsook god's word
[2:01:39] he died to heaven's atmospheres
[2:01:44] or it became close to him and he could
[2:01:46] only operate in
[2:01:47] earth's atmosphere now
[2:01:51] an atmosphere of faith now that's what
[2:01:52] elijah was supposed to do in our day
[2:01:55] how many knows that elijah was to do
[2:01:58] what
[2:01:58] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[2:02:00] pentecostal fathers
[2:02:02] now i don't want pentecost well that's
[2:02:04] what elijah was to do you missed
[2:02:06] his message to turn us back to the same
[2:02:10] faith the same doctrine word by word the
[2:02:12] same power
[2:02:13] the same signs the same wonder the same
[2:02:15] holy ghost come on
[2:02:17] with the shout of the king in their
[2:02:19] midst that's what it was to do
[2:02:20] malachi 4 was to turn your heart back to
[2:02:22] believing again
[2:02:24] and when you've got more and more
[2:02:26] unbelief that's being preached what
[2:02:28] that's why you're not seeing miracles
[2:02:30] that's why you're not seeing signs and
[2:02:32] wonders follow them that believe
[2:02:34] the signs and wonders will follow the
[2:02:36] word
[2:02:38] the bible said jesus went with them
[2:02:40] everywhere
[2:02:41] confirming the word with signs following
[2:02:44] paul said the word that i preached was
[2:02:47] not preached by the knowledge of man
[2:02:49] but by by though but the word he said
[2:02:52] came not
[2:02:53] when word only but with power and with
[2:02:56] demonstration that's how the word got
[2:02:59] brother branham told us
[2:03:00] you're you're just a teacher if there's
[2:03:02] no signs that are following
[2:03:04] if you're a real preacher signs follow a
[2:03:06] preaching of the word
[2:03:07] he said we were commanded to go the
[2:03:09] world and preach it
[2:03:12] deliver the people bring heaven's
[2:03:14] atmosphere down
[2:03:16] bring the holy ghost in the meeting see
[2:03:19] heaven come down
[2:03:20] and when heaven comes down nature's
[2:03:22] change
[2:03:23] [Applause]
[2:03:25] the animals get to quarrel and among
[2:03:27] themselves in eden
[2:03:28] and a little something coming up you
[2:03:30] know the lion was a lion the lamb was a
[2:03:32] lamb and
[2:03:33] you know here here there all adam did is
[2:03:37] brought heaven's atmosphere down had a
[2:03:40] millennium
[2:03:44] amen come on somebody it'll happen for
[2:03:47] you
[2:03:48] you see the atmosphere of faith
[2:03:52] comes by the elijah message to turn our
[2:03:54] hearts back to faith again to believing
[2:03:57] now because of the fall adam's position
[2:04:01] the heavens of sonship was closed off to
[2:04:03] man
[2:04:03] and and lucifer becomes the accuser of
[2:04:06] the brethren
[2:04:07] in heaven keeping us from our rightful
[2:04:10] position
[2:04:12] this is what brother branham would tell
[2:04:13] us in the future both the heavens and
[2:04:15] the earth now is contaminated with
[2:04:17] devils
[2:04:18] that can accuse us before god but jesus
[2:04:21] is there to intercede for us
[2:04:23] while the accuser keeps pointing a
[2:04:26] finger
[2:04:26] they did this they did this they did
[2:04:29] this
[2:04:29] but the blood still covers he came to
[2:04:32] redeem the elected
[2:04:34] that he foresaw but that's why it's so
[2:04:37] filthy today
[2:04:38] because your heavens and earth is
[2:04:39] contaminated with devils
[2:04:41] every time you move toward god here
[2:04:43] satan comes to resist you
[2:04:45] every time you pray every time you reach
[2:04:48] out
[2:04:49] come on now when brother branham was
[2:04:51] there in a
[2:04:53] in a meeting and there was a man just
[2:04:56] before he went into the meeting in a
[2:04:58] very crowded place
[2:05:00] this is the same place that the
[2:05:01] blind-eyed uh colored girl
[2:05:03] received her sight that she he got a a
[2:05:07] man there stopped him and said
[2:05:08] if you would just for a moment said come
[2:05:11] over here to this ambulance and pray for
[2:05:12] this woman
[2:05:14] said i've driven her and you know her
[2:05:16] husband is
[2:05:17] heartbreaking heartbroken he's he she
[2:05:20] his wife just died and he said well if
[2:05:22] she died she went to heaven she's better
[2:05:23] off than us
[2:05:24] i got to get this meeting said no please
[2:05:26] come come come
[2:05:28] and he said you know and he he he was
[2:05:31] compelled to go that way
[2:05:33] he got it that meant some men got him
[2:05:35] over to the ambulance where the
[2:05:36] woman was laying and there you know
[2:05:40] her husband was crying and he was he was
[2:05:43] just weeping there
[2:05:44] just saying oh brother oh it's you
[2:05:46] brother branham well it's too
[2:05:48] late now i guess my wife was a good
[2:05:49] woman we sold
[2:05:51] but all our blackberry jam and stuff to
[2:05:53] make it to this meeting we
[2:05:55] took our quilts and sold them and we've
[2:05:57] tried and we've just tried to serve god
[2:05:59] with all our hearts and
[2:06:00] we're trying to make it to the meeting
[2:06:02] and and i couldn't get her to you
[2:06:04] brother brandon we
[2:06:05] you know and brother branham said well
[2:06:07] let's let's just pray and he
[2:06:09] took her by the hand and he began to
[2:06:12] pray with her
[2:06:14] and he said as he began to pray
[2:06:17] you know he he he felt like
[2:06:22] you know there was a little squeeze come
[2:06:23] to his hand
[2:06:26] and and he said as he did the devil said
[2:06:30] to him
[2:06:34] you just imagined that
[2:06:39] you see what i'm talking about he's
[2:06:42] right there
[2:06:43] to oppose he said but i just kept on
[2:06:46] praying
[2:06:48] i just ignored that and i kept on
[2:06:50] praying
[2:06:51] and believing god and he said in a
[2:06:53] little bit
[2:06:54] he said i felt the cancer stop
[2:06:58] as i had her by my hand and i said the
[2:07:00] disease was being felt there by my hand
[2:07:02] and he said i felt the disease stop i
[2:07:04] knew the cancer was dead
[2:07:06] and i got just praying and a moment she
[2:07:09] licked her lips
[2:07:10] and she opened her eyes and she said oh
[2:07:13] is that
[2:07:14] who are you and he said i'm brother
[2:07:16] branham
[2:07:17] and about that time you know her husband
[2:07:20] began to hear her talk and begin to
[2:07:22] scream
[2:07:22] oh mama mommy you're alive and they
[2:07:24] began to hug one
[2:07:26] another and he got out the door on the
[2:07:28] other side and slipped away and that's
[2:07:30] where he met the blind girl
[2:07:32] and where she was healed but you know
[2:07:34] all of that but again the point is
[2:07:36] the devil said to him
[2:07:42] you see in the future home he said all
[2:07:44] the sin that's in the heavens above he's
[2:07:46] a prince of the power of the air
[2:07:48] you know the bible said that air is
[2:07:50] atmospheres
[2:07:51] and he wards off and keeps off the
[2:07:53] blessings from god
[2:07:55] in there comes thunderbolts and
[2:07:56] lightnings and strikes the earth
[2:07:58] and everything from the heavens sheets
[2:07:59] of ice and rain and typhoons and
[2:08:02] storms and everything else comes from
[2:08:04] above which is satan
[2:08:06] the prince of the power of the air
[2:08:12] but i want to remind you he may be the
[2:08:15] prince of powers of atmosphere
[2:08:19] to bring doubt and confusion and try to
[2:08:22] get you to disbelieve the word
[2:08:24] but i want you to know my jesus
[2:08:27] paid for every divine promise there is
[2:08:30] and the devil has no right to keep
[2:08:34] resisting you when you take that
[2:08:36] name of jesus and you press that word to
[2:08:38] the heart of the enemy
[2:08:40] i want you to know he is not the one in
[2:08:43] authority

[2:27:02] set me free
[2:27:03] let it be a little big whatever it is
[2:27:06] he's worthy of all praise
[2:27:09] and glory i wonder what's happened to
[2:27:11] the church when they forgot how to
[2:27:13] praise
[2:27:14] when the praise of the lord has left the
[2:27:17] camp
[2:27:18] what the church is sitting dead is
[2:27:19] midnight and it's like a morgue
[2:27:21] everywhere
[2:27:22] and you can't even find a man out of the
[2:27:24] people anymore
[2:27:25] and there's no shouts or no hallelujahs
[2:27:29] well brother branham talked about that
[2:27:31] he said
[2:27:32] i always thought of an old nightingale
[2:27:35] he said i
[2:27:35] i would hear it sing oh i'd be coming
[2:27:38] home from a meeting
[2:27:40] up in up up in millstown and come home
[2:27:43] and i hear an old nightingale scene and
[2:27:46] he said well
[2:27:47] i began to study about the nightingale
[2:27:50] and he said i found out if the
[2:27:52] nightingale
[2:27:53] can just see a star shining if it gets
[2:27:56] his eye on the star
[2:27:58] it'll start singing and he said it might
[2:28:01] be all
[2:28:02] dark and gloomy but if just a little
[2:28:06] cloud moves back
[2:28:09] where he's not even seeing the whole
[2:28:11] picture of all the stars shining
[2:28:14] but just one little star
[2:28:17] he sat down he said he sees that star
[2:28:20] and he goes to singing
[2:28:22] and he said i like it in the church with
[2:28:25] an old saint will sit down
[2:28:27] in the service of god and the clouds
[2:28:30] will begin to move back
[2:28:31] by the preaching of the word and one
[2:28:34] little nightingale out there
[2:28:35] begins to get a glimpse of the promise
[2:28:38] of god
[2:28:39] and you hear a hearty amen and a
[2:28:41] hallelujah
[2:28:42] and a glory to god
[2:28:45] he said then i know the sound is still
[2:28:48] shining somewhere
[2:29:00] i asked for it last night it didn't come
[2:29:02] through clear enough jason jackson
[2:29:05] has in his office a picture brother
[2:29:07] branham

[2:29:10] the pulpit
[2:29:12] he's got his leg all the way up top
[2:29:13] jumped up on the
[2:29:15] pulpit and been preaching
[2:29:19] people get an idea brother branham that
[2:29:21] he was just an old baptist
[2:29:24] he preached baptist sermons and had
[2:29:26] baptist experience and had a baptist
[2:29:28] attitude toward worship
[2:29:30] he wasn't he said i want to be
[2:29:32] pentecostal from the top of my head to
[2:29:34] the soul of my feet
[2:29:37] come on church amen he said it's a shame
[2:29:40] that even the pentecostals have got
[2:29:42] ashamed of the name pentecost

[2:29:46] inheritance amen

[2:30:43] ashamed of it
[2:30:44] he said that's being ashamed of him

[2:30:51] reality
[2:30:52] to the power of the living god so we
[2:30:54] don't do that

[2:31:11] praising god in his universe
[2:31:13] and he went round and round and round
[2:31:15] the tree shouting god

[2:31:31] afraid of me about what are you chatting
[2:31:33] about and he got
[2:31:34] realizing he wasn't chattering him at
[2:31:35] all he was
[2:31:37] he was looking at his eye on an eagle
[2:31:39] sitting up there
[2:31:40] and he said well god what do you want me
[2:31:42] to see in that eagle i see you in your
[2:31:44] universe

[2:32:41] not a coward
[2:32:43] he's not afraid of anything he's got
[2:32:46] bravery and he said
[2:32:47] that's one thing god hates as a coward
[2:32:52] you remember in gideon's battle he said
[2:32:53] everybody that's fearful and afraid go
[2:32:55] home
[2:32:57] every man when he lined him up for war
[2:32:59] and the priest said come by
[2:33:01] he sent him out and he said now you're
[2:33:02] going to say anybody's afraid go home
[2:33:06] anybody just married a wife and you
[2:33:08] you're worried you know about fulfilling
[2:33:10] that
[2:33:10] go home if your mind isn't made up to
[2:33:13] win this battle

[2:33:18] god doesn't want cowards god wants men
[2:33:20] and women of faith
[2:33:21] [Applause]
[2:33:23] hallelujah are you with me now amen so
[2:33:26] in this in this as brother branham was
[2:33:28] was saying
[2:33:29] he watched him there and he began to
[2:33:32] move those
[2:33:33] wings there he said you see he had faith
[2:33:37] in the wings that god has given him
[2:33:42] you know jesus told us that that you
[2:33:45] worship god in spirit
[2:33:47] and in truth you know that amen two
[2:33:50] takes two wings to fly
[2:33:52] you don't fly nowhere with one wing
[2:33:55] [Applause]
[2:33:56] right you want to keep your chickens
[2:33:58] bound down in a cup you
[2:34:00] clip one wing you make them out of
[2:34:02] balance and they just flip around in a
[2:34:04] in a in a circle right because they
[2:34:06] can't get over the fence they can't
[2:34:08] escape into freedom because you clipped
[2:34:11] a wing
[2:34:12] amen we've got two wings that god gave
[2:34:15] us
[2:34:16] we worship him in spirit and in truth so
[2:34:19] brother tim we got the truth
[2:34:21] well where's your spirit so what we got
[2:34:24] the spirit well where's the word
[2:34:26] it's got to be balanced
[2:34:30] come on otherwise you just flop around
[2:34:32] and around around
[2:34:36] that's what some do you know they get
[2:34:37] all spirited they
[2:34:39] you know they have no life to go with it
[2:34:40] there's no word that goes with
[2:34:42] you got over here and you got all word
[2:34:44] no spirit
[2:34:45] it takes a balanced approach to worship
[2:34:48] god you worship him in spirit and in
[2:34:50] truth
[2:34:51] he began to see what's that eagle and he
[2:34:53] said after bid he got tired
[2:34:55] of the chatter chatter of the old pine
[2:34:58] squirrel
[2:34:59] and he said he made one leaf off of that
[2:35:02] branch
[2:35:03] and there he said he never dropped his
[2:35:06] wings anymore
[2:35:07] he just spread his wing and he caught
[2:35:09] the current
[2:35:10] of the moving of the wind and he began
[2:35:13] to ride upon there
[2:35:14] and ride upon there and rise upon there
[2:35:18] until he went way away where he no
[2:35:21] longer could even hear
[2:35:22] the chatter of the spine squirrel that
[2:35:24] would say days of
[2:35:26] miracles are passed it ain't right you
[2:35:28] shout like that you can't have that in
[2:35:30] the message church
[2:35:32] amen but an eagle of flowers
[2:35:35] with spirit and truth and elsa are in
[2:35:38] the heavens
[2:35:39] where all things are possible to them
[2:35:41] that believe
[2:35:42] [Music]
[2:35:44] and you think oh well that's the way
[2:35:46] brother branham worshiped
[2:35:48] you know in the woods but no not in
[2:35:50] church he practiced
[2:35:52] an order yet any order that orders the
[2:35:56] holy spirit out is not god's order
[2:35:59] in fact of the matter brother branham
[2:36:01] said you ought to get out of order long
[2:36:02] enough to get saved
[2:36:07] people take such a legalistic approach
[2:36:09] to things
[2:36:10] they think they're the frozen chosen
[2:36:15] yeah they're deader than a drier than
[2:36:18] last year's bird's nest
[2:36:21] it's been abandoned a long time there
[2:36:23] ain't been no children even born there
[2:36:25] shame on the church that there ain't
[2:36:28] people at an altar
[2:36:30] calling out to god same on the church
[2:36:32] that people ain't being baptized in the
[2:36:34] name of jesus christ
[2:36:36] shame on the church that there ain't
[2:36:38] something a witness in their heart
[2:36:39] that's going out to the highways and
[2:36:41] byways and compelling them
[2:36:42] come in shame on the church when the
[2:36:46] devil isn't cast out
[2:36:47] shame on the church
[2:36:52] that ain't seeing people filled with the
[2:36:53] holy ghost

[2:37:07] let me catch the wind of the spirit move
[2:37:09] in the spirit where all things are
[2:37:11] possible
[2:37:13] you don't know brother branham i happen
[2:37:15] to be in his meetings too
[2:37:18] brother branham would stand there in
[2:37:20] front of a microphone because they had
[2:37:21] to catch the recording
[2:37:23] he learned to stand in one spot most of
[2:37:26] the time
[2:37:26] because of the recording because the
[2:37:28] microphone the audience the large
[2:37:30] audience couldn't hear him but when he
[2:37:32] was that little
[2:37:34] when he was that little bunny rooster in
[2:37:36] jeffersonville
[2:37:39] before all the recordings he preached
[2:37:40] from one end of the platform to the
[2:37:42] other
[2:37:43] running back and forth he would get so
[2:37:45] in the spirit
[2:37:46] that he would even start getting out in
[2:37:48] the aisles and rolling up his
[2:37:49] and come to himself rolling up his his
[2:37:51] trousers
[2:37:52] walking out there and he said first
[2:37:54] thing i know i spoke in other tongues
[2:37:57] and he said and as i did an
[2:37:58] interpretation came
[2:38:00] that he is a rock in a weary land and he
[2:38:03] is a fountain
[2:38:04] and a shelter in the time of storm
[2:38:07] hallelujah let me tell you friends
[2:38:10] that's the spirit of god
[2:38:11] that moves upon the people amen that's
[2:38:14] the prophet that i know about
[2:38:16] that's the holy ghost i'm talking about
[2:38:21] you see the devil has to recognize the
[2:38:23] supreme power
[2:38:24] and authority of jesus christ he said
[2:38:27] it's not me
[2:38:28] he hates me he don't have to mind me
[2:38:31] but he has to mind the one i represent
[2:38:35] he has to mind the one who sent me
[2:38:40] it ain't me but i'll tell you what
[2:38:44] i've seen demons scream
[2:38:48] i've locked eyes face to face with them

[2:38:56] bondage of sin
[2:38:59] i've stood there and called on the name
[2:39:01] of jesus christ
[2:39:02] and even when they resisted we didn't
[2:39:05] give up
[2:39:06] until they were delivered
[2:39:10] why because all authority lasts in the
[2:39:13] is in the name of jesus and if you have
[2:39:15] to resist him resist him
