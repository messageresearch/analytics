control in Jesus name amen amen I I like to Echo what what brother Joe had said about the importance of of the contents in in the in the church age book every every major doctrine that we believe is in that book and and and one thing I just want to reiterate is that that these Services what I'm really hoping that they'll do is just be to to come behind and reinforce and strengthen what it is you've already read so I would like to ask that you do your best to make sure you've read um each portion Before We Gather and that's really was my desire in all this is that each one of you can say I I have read the church age book I've dug into it I found these truths for myself and and I promise you not just in these youth services but on Wednesdays and Sundays as you sit here and hear the word come forth you're going to begin to recognize and see things that you've been reading for yourself and you'll be able to place those things in the scripture and it won't just be what my daddy believes this or my mama believes this or this is what brother Tim says but you'll be able to know oh I know where that comes from because I've read it for myself so so thank you for those of you that have made sure to keep up with the reading and if you hadn't been I would just like to encourage you to do so so we're going to start tonight by reading the message to the Ephesian church again we started the Ephesian Church age last time and do the length of it we broke it into two parts and so tonight we'll be covering the second part of that and we're going to start with the message to the Ephesian age and it says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand and who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks just like that song We were singing how we know he's with us this right here shows that he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so we know that he's still here all the way till the end of time we can take solace in that he says I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou can'tst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted never the less I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy First Love remember therefore from which thou are fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to each of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God Amen I pray the Lord without his blessings to the word as you take your seats every time I go through the church age book and begin to read and study I'm amazed at how much more I come across and how much more is opened up to to me so I'm thankful even for myself to be going through this again and having the opportunity because the word is just so rich and there's just so much in it and you never can you never can get get it all out it's just so much for us to to dig into and we last time just to briefly review we we talked about how brother Branham said there was a key that allowed him to to determine who The Messengers were and to go through these Church ages and he said the key is is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is and he tells us that the lord gave him this key and it allowed him to discover the messengers at each age and this is the very scripture that is at the core of the message Hebrews 13 8 and that is that God never changes he is the same yesterday today and forever and so what he did in the first age he'll have to keep on doing until the very until it's done until the last age so he teaches us that the kind of man that God chose in the first age and how he operated and how the the ministry manifested through that that ministry will be how God does it in each and every age and so it was that key that allowed him to determine who the The Messengers were to each age and we learned that Paul was the messenger to the Ephesian Age and and we talked about how that that Paul being the messenger we dealt not only with Paul but with Pentecost and how that it was the pattern for every Church going forward brother Branham says the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost so we talked about that and we also talked about and we introduced among other things that there were two Vines there's a True Vine and there's also a false Vine and that's where we're going to pick up this time with with the seed of nicolaitanism the seed of nicolaitanism and in Revelation 2 and 6 we just read this it says but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate so after God has told them what he has against them in the earlier verses and how they had left their first love and and how they must repent or else they're going to have their light taken away he's kind of he's come down on him a little bit he says I got this against you and you've done this and you've done this but then he comes back around he says but I want to compliment you on something I want to tell you what it is that I like about you here and he says that you hate the Deeds of the Nicolaitans and he says so do I not only do you hate them but so do I so we have that in common and he's complimenting them here and I think it would behoove us if God hates this and he likes it when we hate it too it would behoove us to find out what these were and make sure that we hate it to find out what these Deeds of the Nicolaitans are to stay as far away from it as possible and if need be to preach against that thing with all our might because God hates it and it's obvious that we're not to have the these Deeds within our church within ourselves within the move of God Amen so he says here whatever starts in the early Church Must continue in every age until it is finally blessed and exalted by God or destroyed as an unclean thing in the Lake of Fire so we learned a key earlier that that God is unchangeable and in his ways but this is another key concept to watch as we go along and that that the seeds that are planted early on will continue to grow and manifest as we go down Through the Ages so things that are just seeds will grow and become deeds and become doctrines and as you go through the ages they will manifest fully as we continue he says thus we see seeds in Ephesus that will continue and will become a doctrine that will go right up to and into the Lake of Fire amen so so so if it's of God it's going to grow and it's going to be blessed and it's going to be exalted like he says in this first quote he said but if it's planted by the wicked one it's going to be destroyed in the Lake of Fire remember we talked about last time the parable of the wheat and the tares and we covered that and it says but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way what was this these were seeds that were planted that were not planted by God they were planted by the wicked one they were planted by his enemy seeds not of God and these seeds are going to grow together all right the wheat and the tares are going to grow together all the way up until they manifest what they are and The Good Seed will be taken into the Garner and the tares are going to be bundled for the burning so what we see is the seeds of the Nicolaitans right here aren't fully manifested you're not exactly sure what they are they're still in seed form they're not fully manifested yet in the Ephesian age but the seeds are planted in the Ephesian age and they quickly began to grow and begin to manifest what they are and more importantly who they are of and that's what we're going to deal with not just what are they but who are they of what do these seeds come from and brother Brandon would tell us that the word nicolaitan comes from two Greek words Nico meaning to conquer and Laos meaning the laity so there in that early age you had some thing or some person or some Authority brother Branham would say that was going about trying to conquer the laity now just so we understand what that means what is the laity you are the laity just means the people the The Everyday People of the church something was going around trying to control the people trying to take away freedom from the people there in that very first age and God said there in verse he says but this thou has thou hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate so just uh not in detail but to say this what is this that he's hating he's hating people trying to exert authority over his people he's hating men trying to come in and control his people and take authority upon themselves to try to to rein in people's worship to try to take people's freedom to try to take it to where it's not about a spiritual Revelation anymore but what we tell you to do he says I hate this and that first age hated it as well and I want to say again when we whenever we buy the word see how that Spirit acts when I say that Spirit I'm talking about nicolaitanism we when we see how that acts then we as the True Vine must hate it too and that's what it is when he says Thou hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans he's speaking to the True Vine and the True Vine will never be able to sit back and take that nicolaitan Spirit they'll never be okay with that lukewarm formal Spirit but the True Vine will hate the Deeds of the Nicolaitans the true and the false Vine and we talked about this just a little bit just a little bit last time that there's is two two parts that intertwine but are completely opposite two different plants and God did not plant the tares we see that in the in the in the wheat in the Terrors Parable that we talked about Satan planted those tares right amongst the good seed of God now keep your mind where we're at we're at the very beginning the first church age and brother Brandon would type it to like the Genesis of the church he said that first age was just like the Book of Genesis so we're right at the beginning and Satan comes in and plants Terrors amongst the good seed of God and so now we have two kinds of plants or people two types of people because when I tell you that there's two different vines in the church you know we're not looking around looking for Greenery we're talking about two different types of people and so there's two different plants or people from two different seeds that grow up together they come up together all right and the same was true in the Ephesian church and as we already said if it was true in the Ephesian Church it must be true all the way till the very end so it's still true today it was true in every other age and it's true today but it was there in the Ephesian church it was made up of good seed and bad or the True Vine and the false Vine those are there and two Vines make up the church listen to brother rounds he says religion and the spiritual world are made of those two trees which had their roots in Eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other what a thought so close together so close together that their branches would intertwine and and and Seed from both of these make up the church now when we say the church that's one thing I want you to remember is we're talking about all the church not like just this church but all the church Christendom you're talking about the church not just evening like Tabernacle so those two Vines make up the church and within those within the church as we said that there are two Vines a false find and a true vinyl don't let this worry you don't let this make you afraid and scare you well how do we know what's true how do we know what what's right how will we know how how do we understand what is what and what is true and what that's false and I want to remind you tonight that the elect or the True Vine will never be deceived so don't let that fear come in of all my be accidentally taken over here to the falls and this is going to come now listen the True Vine will never be deceived brother Branham says in only the elect will really know which is the true Spirit only the elect will not be deceived Matthew 24 24 for there shall I Rise false Christ and false prophets and shall sow great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible if it were possible it shall deceive the very elect and I know we've covered this before but sometimes people look at that and they're like it's going to be so close I'm so worried about it it's going to be so close and they allow that scripture to actually bring fear when in reality it should do just the opposite because when you read it it tells you you cannot be deceived you're not going to be deceived you're going to recognize truth truth is going to call your name you're not going to fall you're not going to stumble you're predestinated not to fall if it were possible you could be deceived but it's not it's not possible so when God speaks to the church he is speaking to both the True Vine and the false Vine he's addressing both of them brother Brown says when he speaks he when he says the church he's talking to everybody that's in the church and he's calling them both the church and so so very early on just a few years Beyond Pentecost the false Vine begins to entangle itself with the truth now keep that image as we had in the garden of the image of the branches so close together think about that so close and so the false Vine begins to entangle itself with the true and it begins to fight truth it begins to to fight Revelation it begins to fight the moving of the spirit it begins to try to reign in the way people worship and early on it's fighting the True Vine and it's going to continue to do that all the way up until it's destroyed in the Lake of Fire young people you will be in a battle all the way up until the Lake of Fire which we're not going into by the way but it says that's where the false Vine will go because it hates the life that's in the True Vine it hates the life that you have and if you don't have it if that seed hasn't been quickened its very goal is to keep it from being quickened in your life so it fights you to such you won't get it and then once you get it it hates you even more and it fights you even more so you're going to be in a continual battle but let me remind you tonight we're the winners you are going to make it you are going to overcome and you're not going to stumble and fall short amen he tells us that that first church began to drift and it began to lose its first love and even before we go into it right now I want you to think about you at your highest point in your relationship with the Lord when I say that I mean the way you felt the Zeal you have where are you at how you felt after that camp experience or maybe that experience right here or that experience at home wherever it was when you so fell in love and you knew he loved you and you loved him I want to ask you are you still there or better yet are you even beyond that or have you slid back from that place is that love burning just as strong as it was at first when it was your first love when it was more important than anything else when it was more important than your entertainment or your day-to-day when it was what you thought about when you couldn't go through a day without prayer when you couldn't go through a day without feeding on the word where are you at right now in relation to where that place was because they began to fall from their origin or fall from their birth and the Bible tells us that they left their first love and I want to tell you tonight don't let that happen to you don't let yourself begin to fall back don't don't lose the passion you have for the word don't lose the excitement for coming to the house of God don't even let a Friday night use service just be a I wish he'd get done so we could go to the gym but let the passion be there that I know this is life I know I gotta have this I know I need more and let it be what drives you and pushes you because as you slide back from that place and cool off you become an easy target don't let things begin to creep in things of the world that you know don't please God don't let those things creep in even if they're not quote unquote things that would send me to hell I've often said it's time that we quit looking at things and asking the question is this right and wrong and ask the question does this please God is this something that pleases him brother Branham goes into it in this chapter where he talks about do all that you do in the name of Jesus and if you can't don't do it but where are you at they had fallen from their first love from their origin they're at Pentecost but when you begin to lose that daily seeking of A Closer Walk that that day that daily seeking of a deeper experience and for more Revelation than you become vulnerable to the Grievous wolves that Paul talked about because you've drifted away from the shepherd you've drifted away from the one that's going to protect you from the ones that want to kill you wolves that come in with enticing words and they begin to lead you astray from Holy Spirit leadership brother Branham says they began to follow man's leadership instead of the leadership of the Holy Spirit he tells us that it was the same thing that had happened to Israel when they came out of Egypt and he says the way of God excuse me I accidentally changed slides he says the way of God was to lead by The Cloud of fire prophetic utterance Miracles and signs and god-given wonders this was to be accomplished by God selected and God ordained and God equipped and God sent men with the now here we go here's the difference the Nicolaitans will say see they're supposed to be led by by men but he finishes that by saying with the whole Camp being dominated by a holy ghost move the whole Camp being dominated by a holy ghost move he says that is exactly how the first church age started and it will get worse and worse until the holy spirit is completely rejected and God Must Destroy the people what happened to Israel they came out they seen signs they'd seen wonders they seen the hand of God opened the Red Sea but then they began to want rules and regulations they began to want a king like the others and they wanted to fit in with the world and when they did that they lost the pillar of fire leadership and the same thing is what's happening in that first age as they began to look more like the worldly church as they began to get away from the move of the spirit when they began to get a little embarrassed by people jumping and shouting and saying we don't need all that is they got cold and they got formal they began to lose the leadership of the pillar of Fire and the people in the Pulpit began to tell them you don't need that you don't have to have that and they took and they vested it all upon themselves and you end up with the people who aren't in the word for themselves so they don't know when they're being led astray that's what we're saying in reading this church age book I want you when you hear something to come across this desk I want you to go yes I know that's in the word because I've been feeding on it for myself but if you don't feed and you don't dig and you don't look you can be told anything do you know how many brother Branham said there is out there that brother Branham never said don't fall away because then you become a target of the leadership of man that will lead you away from the move of the Holy Spirit but stay fervent stay in love continue feeding but Israel fell away just like this just like the first age and that nicolete and spirit Spirit began to teach against the experience any body who teaches against the experience of the new birth is under a nicolaitan spirit and that is nicolaitanism it began to teach against the experience of the new birth it's hard against the moving of the spirit and slowly the power of God in their midst was lost young people you've been blessed to be raised up in a time and not only in a time but in a place to where it is fostered and and we accept the moving of the spirit and we want the moving of the spirit and we look for the moving of the spirit don't ever take that for granted I say in the first stage that was lost but we live in a time where it's been restored and you need to make it a cry within your own heart that it will not be lost again on my watch I Won't Let It Go by the wayside I won't take it for granted but when I come on Wednesday night I'm looking for a move of the spirit when I come on Sunday I'm looking for more of God I'm asking God move in a mighty way move in a miraculous way because if you get to where you're comfortable with services without the moving of God and you get to a place where that's okay and you quit expecting it it quits happening I'll just speak for my own home when we go several listen we we understand let me make it very clear there are many different ways in which the spirit of God moves and every one don't have to be what we would call one that makes everybody jump shout dance Rejoice but those are good I like those but the spirit of God moves in every service if we allow him to it's not always the same way but you know what I'm talking about when I say there are times where it seems like it's just ready to break out in the place and you can almost feel it and maybe it doesn't and then maybe it goes that way for a few services and me and my wife me and sister Lydia will be talking like I'm so ready for that I'm so ready for that outpouring I'm so ready for that manifestation and and we'll even begin to pray you know Lord don't let it be me that's hindering it don't let it be me I felt it there I sensed it there it was ready to move there was people ready to be delivered what's holding it back but never get to the place where you can go service after service after service and just be like that was fine we came together we sang some songs we preached and we went home no but why do we come here to draw closer to experience more to go deeper to have a greater relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ if you've Fallen away from your first love get back to that we live in a time where it has been restored and we must be willing to fight for that fight for the Holy Spirit fight for for the experiences fight for altar cause fight for prayer lines fight for deliverance fight that the spirit of God can have freedom I want to say it again it's not that we come here looking for you to act any certain way during a service but that you have the freedom to act how you feel led to when the spirit falls upon you the freedom to worship completely and holy however you feel led to do it what are you saying tonight I'm saying fall in love again fall in love again brother Brandon would he would say he would say you know they they waited too long they waited too long because the scripture says repent he says apparently they waited too long to do it it says remember therefore from which Thou Art Fallen where did you come from this is Brother Brown I'm talking from Pentecost you fell down to where you are now backsliding repent and do the first Works go back to Pentecost again or else I will come unto thee quickly apparently they'd slid away from from where things were in the upper room and from from where they had originated at Deeds to doctrines he says see how it started out in the early church it was called Deeds then it became a Doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way and it finally took over and God was pushed aside what do you think is happening when people say we don't need the moving of the spirit we don't need his gifts think about it in a very carnal way for a minute I understand that that gifts don't save you we understand all that but just think for a minute boys you like a girl and she supposedly likes you and every time you bring her a gift that you got just for her just because you wanted to bless her she said I don't need that give that to somebody else that's that's for the denominations and they take your gift and give it to another girl we don't need your gifts how are you going to feel about that relationship you got a fiance that you know that's going to be your bride and you bring them something they go that's that's old fat get that away from me I don't want that I ain't got to tell you how to feel I think you know how you'd feel think about when when when when Ellie easier came to find a bride and went and went to the well and all the gifts that he brought yeah it wasn't the bridegroom but it was gifts from the bridegroom and what if she said you brought me this tongues that's the least of the gifts why do I want that think about the attitude we have towards the gifts and Christ is just pushed aside so what it was in this first age the actions of a few began to take hold and people began to surrender their rights listen a lot of it goes on with what's said in the Pulpit no doubt there's pulpits that will be held accountable but don't you ever surrender your rights don't you ever back up off the freedom that God has given you and your right to freedom of worship and freedom in the spirit don't you ever give up your rights because apparently they're in the first age even though Jude had called out to him and said contend apparently most of them didn't contend they let it go and now God's leadership was pushed aside and man's leadership was fully instituted no notice when we say this we're not talking about God called men leading by the spirit and leading by the word we're talking about the Grievous wolves that would come in and take authority on themselves and Lead according to their desires and Lead men away from the Holy Spirit and Lead men unto themselves and then with that as few as many begin to give up their rights the false Vine began to come in and squeeze the life out of the church that's why a church with no leadership of the spirit and no moving of the spirit will be void of the works of the spirit because the life that produces the works of the spirit is not allowed to operate in that place that's why they don't see it because they don't allow it to move the life that produces those things isn't allowed to operate and brother Brown says the True Vine hated the formal Deeds of the Nicolaitans and so did God he says oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good stop right there that's why you take it back to the word it looks so good but is it in the word well you shouldn't do that because we've moved beyond that but is it in the word either way whether somebody tells you you should or shouldn't take it back to the word and find out whether you should or shouldn't always take it back to where he said it looks so good it seems so sound then it caught a hold like a python brother Aaron why are y'all constantly talking about this why are you constantly well listen read the church age book and ask the prophet why was he constantly talking about it because I promise you we don't emphasize it any more than the prophet did but why because if it ever takes a hold if formalism ever takes a hold it squeezes the very life out of you like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality that there was in the church nicolaitanism kills the spirituality it kills the moving of the spirit it kills the atmosphere of worship and therefore it kills the opportunity at a birth and if you get to the root of it and we'll try to bring this back around at the end that's exactly what it's trying to do it doesn't want you to have the new birth how would you like to be held accountable as one who believed that that you were teaching God's word and yet you were keeping people from the very birth they had to have to go in a rapture and yet that spirit's fighting against the New Birth young people we can't let it in that's why we're constantly on it that's why we're constantly pointing it out that's why we're constantly talking about the moving of the spirit and the freedom of the spirit and the new birth and weeping your way to Calvary and have an experience for yourself because we can't let that in and it starts so small it starts so innocent he says it looks so good you know it usually starts with trying to protect the people from fanaticism it starts under the guise of protection and guarding against what they call emotionalism and it ends up in a place where only the pastor is spiritual it ends up in a place where only the pastor has a gift and life is robbed Joy is robbed freedom is robbed and brother Branham says and you were ridiculed and attacked for the Liberty that you have in Christ think about it he says see how the church began to get formal during that time they begin to kind of break down the people under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost now pay attention what he's saying here and think about this they begin to break down the people who were under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and begin to cause people to kind of make fun of them when you find that it's someone under a nicolaitan spirit that would make fun of people under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost church we can't let that come in may it be that I'd even like Tabernacle that's never accepted that service is without the moving of the spirit of the spirit or something that we say no we will not have that but he'll always be welcome to move here how he sees fit break out on our services when he sees fit to pour the gifts out in people's lives and we will accept them now I may never once speak in tongues in my life and that's fine I know it has nothing to do with my salvation but I say Lord if you want me to I'm sure willing Lord if you want me to operate under a gift of the Holy Spirit I'm sure willing because I'm not going to reject and push aside the spirit of Christ in any way now look all of this goes that it doesn't mean that we don't believe in rulership and headship in a church but like the prophet said he said I believe that the church is to be ruled over by men that God sends to take charge but that rule is by the word and that is not men really ruling that's the spirit of God so it's not men ruling it's the spirit of God ruling but in order for that to happen you've got to have men that are surrendered to the spirit of God Amen rulership of man he says see what was happening back there that false fine was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed and he says the Ephesians hated that and any True Believer will hate it too Believers will hate when men quench the moving of the spirit Believers will hate cold and formal worship Believers we will hate when they see men trying to control the freedom of worship in a congregation brother Brown says they got the people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship and I want you to pay close attention well the way we worship doesn't really matter brother Aaron you know as long as the word listen to what brother Brown says he covers all this about the Nicolaitans he covers it all and then when he sums it up how's he sum it up they got the people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days after Pentecost apparently the way we worship matters and it should resemble the way it was at Pentecost because he says what they did is they pulled them away from that worship it pulled them away from that passion and the moving of the spirit Paul here is speaking to the Elders of the Ephesian church because Paul being a prophet saw it coming he saw this coming and he says in Acts 20 and 27 for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock and brother Brown says here is Paul's wolves the Deeds of Nicolaitans when you operate under the spirit of nicolaitanism you are one of the Wolves Paul spoke of brother Brown says that's Paul's wolves the Deeds of the Nicolaitans and he says also of your own self shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them notice what makes it so dangerous because these wolves are of your own selves listen God bless every Church there is I wish there was more of them but y'all ain't being deceived by the nominational message what makes these wolves dangerous of your own selves shall men arise people that can talk the same talk you talk quote the same quote you quote believe the godhead the way you believe the godhead there's the wolves he says therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears brother Brown says he knew they would Implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in the Holy Spirit Ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the Holy Spirit there's not too much freedom in the laity wow he says in the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to exorbit it listen Paul cried out against it and if he was here today he'd cry out against it again he would cry out just the same and he would say back to the leadership of the spirit back to Pentecost back to what the word actually teaches quit saying the word the word the word and actually do what the word teaches you to do the holy ghost in the ministry the holy ghost in the people the holy ghost in the worship the Holy Ghost dominating the whole camp not a man dominating the holy ghost manifested in a people doing the same things and acting the same way that it always acted what I want from evening like Tabernacle is that it be said of us just like God said of them they hate the Deeds of the Nicolaitans they hate that seed they they hate the way it manifests itself they hate the Deeds of the Nicolaitans we're going to move on now to verse 7. the voice of the spirit let me find some water real quick it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches now we know because we're this is pretty simple to say but we know that this isn't talking physically because everybody in here has an ear everybody does but it's saying he who will lend his ear this is Brother Branham he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of God enlightening him if your ear is open to the word not just saying I believe the word but it's actually open to it the spirit of God will make the word real to you now that is a work of the spirit now it's worth noting here that it says churches unto thee churches so it wasn't just talking to Ephesus it wasn't just a message to Ephesus here but it but it's a message to the first age but it's for each and every age each and every Church anybody down Through the Ages that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith the rest of the verse says to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God this is the promised reward brother Brown tells us that this is a future reward but it's for the Overcomers of each and every age if you overcome your reward is to eat of the Tree of Life the Overcomers from Ephesus all the way down to the Overcomers of laodicea your reward is that you will be able to eat from the Tree of Life Now notice and I want you to pay close attention as we go forward from here because I want you to be able to tie some things together in scripture yourself without me having to just explain it completely I think if you'll open your ear right now you'll recognize some of this notice the reward is to eat of the Tree of Life your reward will be will be eternal life but what I want you to notice is the language used it's the same language that Jesus would use that made everyone turn away from him think about it what was in John 6 53 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you to eat from the Tree of Life and we'll come back to this and connect this as we go on the tree of life is mentioned six times in the scripture in this context three times in Genesis 2 and 9 3 and 22 and 3 and 24 then also three times in the Book of Revelation in Chapter 2 and 7 22 and 2 and 22 and 14 not going to go to each one of these places but the Tree of Life what is it or should I say who is it who is the Tree of Life in all six places the tree is symbolizing the exact same thing and that is the Lord Jesus Christ go ahead and get that right now the Lord Jesus Christ is the Tree of Life throughout the scriptures often what you'll find is that is that tree symbolize people it's just like that in Psalms one brother Joe read this Wednesday night it says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counts of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in this season so this person is like a tree and this person will bring forth fruit that bringeth forth fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper and like I said what we see here and as we see in other places in the scripture is trees referring to people and if there was a tree that was the tree of life then that tree had to be Jesus because he alone is the source of life he alone is the source of life so you can't have Jesus as the source of life and then there's this mystical tree that also is the source of life it's not two different things we're going to do that what we're going to do here is look at quite a few scriptures just to establish that there is no other source of eternal life outside of Jesus all right further showing you what am I trying to do I'm showing you that the tree of life was Jesus okay so first John 5 11 and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son it could just have easily said and this life is in the tree of life it would have been the same thing but it's in his son verse 12 he that hath the son hath life so who is the Tree of Life Jesus all right we're going to keep going with this now look John 6 31 our fathers did eat Manna in the desert at his as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life the same way that he's a loaf of bread he's the tree you follow so he is the the bread of life he is the Tree of Life moving on John 6 47 barely verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life I am that bread of life I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world it says whoso eadeth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drink indeed now notice not only does this establish that Jesus is the source of life I want you to pay attention because it also hearkens to the symbolism of eating in order to have life you must eat you must partake of what Jesus is offering you you must partake of the fruit of the Tree of Life what Jesus is trying to give you that is the fruit that was on the tree of life and so if it's if it's hearkening back to to the symbolism of eating it doesn't take a big leap to recognize that this is the exact same type of type of language being used in Genesis when it speaks of eating in the garden Genesis 2 17 but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die and just as We Know I believe we know and if not hopefully we will in a minute that you didn't literally eat Jesus we also know that they didn't literally eat fruit in the garden from a literal tree to cause the fall otherwise if that was the case then you'd have to literally do what Jesus was telling you to do there nah but they reckon they thought it was crazy because they didn't understand that and they said this man's accountable they walked away there's no there's not enough of him how could we all do this but just says that we know that they didn't mean literally eat him they didn't literally eat this fruit it's interesting to me that when when people read this account of Jesus saying Eat My Flesh and drink my blood they immediately understand that he didn't mean it literally but when you apply that to to Genesis they can in no way fathom or apply that to that language in the garden they can read that every time goes well that's not really what it meant you know it was a symbolism and then but then you try to explain that in the guard and they're like really how big a leap is that it's the exact same language with the exact same symbolism he says this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat Manna and are dead he that eateth this bread shall live forever so Jesus makes it very clear in John chapter 6 through 8 that he is the only source of eternal life he is the bread of life in chapter 7 he declares that he's the source of rivers of Living Water in chapter 8 he declares that before Abraham was I am so if he is the source of life if he's the bread of life if he's the rivers of life and if like Peter declared he was the only one with the words of life then Jesus is the Tree of Life amen so brother Branham says now since the record cannot change be taken from or added there unto then the record stands that the life is in the Sun since this is so the tree in the garden has to be Jesus now that's going to take us to our next little leap here brother Branham says all right if the tree of life is a person then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a person also it can't be otherwise it wouldn't be symbolism and Jesus is it's really Jesus and then the other is a tree if one is Jesus then the other has to be a person also we spoke about the two Vines we've talked about the true and the false and what we're fixing to find out is the source of those Vines why is there a false fine why was the evil one able to to spread seed Amongst the Wheat where did the tares come from you know many believe that the two trees in the garden were just trees but we've already established that the only source of life was Jesus and that only in eating that tree or partaking of him can one live and so if the tree of life is a person then so it is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is equal speaks when he's speaking of Satan he specifically says thou has been in Eden The Garden of God so we know that he was there as equal points that out and makes it clear so we're going to delve into this just for a second the truth of the garden we know that the sin in the garden wasn't literally eating a fruit but it was a sexual act that occurred when the serpent beguiled Eve Genesis 3 1 says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made now I want you to pay close attention and don't get it in your head like many do that the serpent was a snake but brother Aaron you have a snake up there yes post curse because we're going to look down at verse 14. if you think the serpent was a snake pay close attention to this and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast the east of the field upon thy belly shout thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life now I'm not trying to be jokey but can you imagine if the serpent was already a snake and in all of God's infinite wisdom the best curse he could come up with is that you're going to keep being a snake I can just see this everyone you got me wow no he completely changed him upon thou Valley shout thou go this was the greatest curse that God could put upon him he wasn't going to curse him to continue being what he already was he took him from an upright creature that obviously could talk think about this and this is just me rambling forgive me for a minute but if I wanted to deceive you do you think that my best course of action would be to send an animal to you that you know cannot talk and have it begin talking to you yeah what's the first thing you think Eve would have done when that snake was like what's up let me think about it I mean I mean really I'm that's not the sense that it's not going to work he chose something that could reason that could walk that could talk as a matter of fact some before you get into your head like you know this is so crazy you know it was this ugly beast yes it could walk and it could talk but it was a beast like an ape I don't know brother Branham said he was beautiful as a matter of fact I have the quote here she saw the serpent he was beautiful handsome far better than her own husband he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field and he was probably a fairer man than her husband so close to human and yet not you wouldn't have been able to tell you'd have thought and I know I'm talking to young people so I'm just gonna say it you'd have thought that dude right there looks better than Adam that's a better looking man you wouldn't have thought that's a good looking animal that there is a good looking Beast no he was attractive he looked like a man brother Brown said looking better than Adam so close to human and yet not beautiful muscular subtle seductive wise and cunning the scripture says in verse 13 and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat now we're not going to break out the Webster's Dictionary and break it all down but beguiled means seduced she was seduced brother Brown said that's one of the mysteries of God that has remained hidden but here it is revealed it happened right back there in the midst of Eden when Eve turned away from life to accept death and through this act Satan is able to introduce himself and his characteristics into the human race brother Brandon says now why did this have to be why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest was man the temple Satan knew this all along and he also wanted to indwell man even as God does but God had reserved to himself that right Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh Satan could not and cannot do that he does not have creative Powers the only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in Eden Genesis 3 15. now what I'm going to do there's quite a few scriptures here they don't go together is I want to scripturally back up what I've just explained to you just so it just isn't I want to show you in the scriptures just to back this up because people want to argue the doctrine of the serpent seed but this scripturally here tells us without debate that the serpent had a seed verse 15 I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed between thy say he's talking to the serpent so I don't care if you ever end up in a discussion about it you might not can explain it all out and show every scripture there is because there's a lot of them but you can go to Genesis 3 15 and say all I know is the scripture says the serpent had a seed and it says it shall bruise thy head he's talking about the woman's seed which everyone knows is Christ and thou shalt bruise his heel which means the Flesh of Christ where he touches the earth now you tell me I'm not sure but there at Calvary was he crucified by a bunch of snakes he was crucified by men the tares the tares that were planted Amongst the Wheat he says the certain the certain when the word seed here means lineage of people so between thy lineage is what he's saying to the serpent that lineage and the woman's lineage it'll bruise the hill of the seed of the woman which which we know was Christ I want to look at First John 3 12. not as Cain who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous now it says here that Cain was of who Wicked one was Adam Wicked oh the scripture actually talks about him as the son of God never declares him as wicked so Cain was not of Adam says Cain turned out in the character like his father a bringer of death a murder where did that nature in Cain come from one who hated the word of God one that was full of bitterness and jealousy and anger enough to murder where did that come from his father Matthew 12 33 it says either make the tree good and his fruit good we're back to that again or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit o Generation of Vipers how can ye being evil speak good this is Jesus talking to the Pharisees I want to show you some more John 8 39. this one here I I love how this lays it out it says they answered him and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus said on them if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham so he's ultimate Jesus is questioning their lineage he's saying you didn't come through the seed line you think you did but now you seek to kill me a man that I told you the truth which I've heard of God this did not Abraham ye do the Deeds of your father now notice here they catch the reference they know exactly what he's talking about they catch the reference and they know he's pointing back to the garden and saying you are on that act took place in the their response then they said unto him we be not born of fornication we're not born of that act in the garden you can't put that on us we have one father even God and Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God and neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do now look another reference even to Cain he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in truth you are of your father the devil and so from this you find two lines of man brother Brown says of course students for a long time have set forth two lines of men one of which was The Godly line found in Seth and the other the ungodly line as founded by Cain and it is strange but true these same students have never told us how it was that Cain was the kind of person he was while Abel and Seth were of the spiritual and godly line how were Abel and Seth God-fearing spiritual men and yet Cain was so different so full of hatred wickedness and violence one tree of life is Jesus tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Satan and what did that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil produce It produced exactly what God told them it would produce and it manifested itself in Cain and immediately produced death not only death to the human race but there was an immediate manifestation It produced death and came because Cain was of that Wicked one looking at the two lines the tree of knowledge produced people that were clever smart lots of Commerce invention but then we know and brother Brown talks about it with all the things that come off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil everything it produces that's good also has evil look at the inventions gunpowder think of the death brought about by that invention bombs cars we love cars we all in some ways partake of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil how many of y'all even I didn't walk here how many of y'all walked here no you came in a car but do you know how many people die every year in a car oh it's it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil medicine's a wonderful thing but do you ever read the side effects on some medicines it's good and it's evil so with everything that comes off that tree you have good and you have evil brother Branham tells us though that the people in this lineage the false fine those that come down like that are very very religious now pay attention as we bring this and begin to wrap this up he says they are very religious they believe in God they are like their father the devil and their ancestor Cain because both of them believed in God they go to church they mingle with the righteous as do tears mingle with the wheat very religious and this is where we're going to Loop it back around to nicolaitanism because that's where we came from where did that false find come from that that began to Institute this nicolaitanism because from them the false Vine we see the nicolaitan religion come forth you have the True Vine and the false Vine and the false Vine is always spreading poison always spreading negativity listen here's the deal if all you have to Rally people around is negativity and in our churches in the message it shouldn't be about what everybody else has wrong because when you have something worth presenting I can just present it I don't got to make it look better by by showing you all the faults in everybody else and if all you have to Rally people around is negative stories and accusations you can trace that right back into the heavens where Lucifer rallied people with his complaints and always remember this just because people agree with you doesn't make you right because there was a whole lot of angels who agreed with the Devil that always you know kind of makes me smile when people are throwing their complaints out and they name drop and so and so agrees with me too man what why does that matter if you're Gathering people or you're using negativity for your ministry that's not the ministry of the True Vine they're always spreading negativity under the guise of religion and spirituality to destroy the true seed of God just as Cain killed Abel it tells us to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God man had fallen and sin nature had entered into the human race and God couldn't have man living eternally in a sinful condition and so the way to eternal life was blocked and guarded brother Brown it says he says right here was guarded by a cherubim with the Flaming sword due to the fall but but now because the seed of the woman that that is promised there in the garden has actually come forth and has come down through time and has crushed the head of the seat of the serpent at Calvary there is now a way made to once again partake of the Tree of Life brother Brown says what a thrilling thought it is that tree of life in the Garden of Eden which could not be approached because of the fall of Adam is now given to the Overcomer the Flaming sword of the Guardian cherubim has now been sheathed and the angel that once guarded the way and and wouldn't let you back into the garden and wouldn't let people get to the tree brother Brown says that same Angel is now pushing people saying get back to the Tree of Life get back to eternal life go partake of Jesus go get all you can it's a free Fountain and it's flowing and there's access made to it you once couldn't go but he's saying now you can go because it was a perfect sacrifice it was a perfect lamb and now every Overcomer from every age is given this as a reward eternal life and constant fellowship with Jesus Christ brother Brown says get back to God repent before it is too late see the handwriting on the wall it is writing judgment as the sacred vessels were desecrated and thus brought the wrath of God now the sacred word has been desecrated and the spirit grieved and judgment is here and even at the door repent repent go back to Pentecost back to the leadership of the Holy Ghost back to the word of God for why will ye die look at this for just a minute that subtle spirit will come in and quote quotes it'll twist it this way and that anything to keep the people living in the same birth of the sin of the garden see it's always been about birth that's what it was about with Cain it was about birth that's what it was about all the way up to Jesus and his virgin birth it's about birth and even today that Spirit questions the new birth because that Spirit doesn't have a problem with the first birth because that's where its roots are found of course they don't think you have to be born again they're okay with the birth that their roots are found in their roots are found at the sin of the garden so they don't need a new birth they're okay with the birth that was there at the beginning but today there's been a restoration today there's a voice that cries out to the elect of God and it says You must be Born Again Church I'm not okay with my first birth and you can't be okay I don't care how good you are how bad you are no matter where you're at on that Spectrum you must be born again why was that Jesus's very first Doctrine because something was wrong with our first birth you must have a new birth you must be born by the spirit of God and why is that even possible because he came and took and came through a virgin birth so the curse of sin had no claim on his flesh and so now you must be born again I don't want my roots found in the act in the garden I don't want my flesh to be what controls me I want to lay this down and I don't want to have any tie to the center of the garden I only want my birth to be tied back to Calvary tied back to Pentecost tied back to the upper room I say yes Lord I want the new birth give me the new birth change me change my flesh change my spirit change everything about me because my roots are Eternal my roots are in heaven they're not found in the fall they're in the Garden of Eden Hallelujah you must return to Pentecost you must have the Holy Ghost and if you don't why will you die he's saying why won't you go back you know this is death why I'm not just return to Pentecost why will you die because you're too prideful because you don't want to accept it because you don't want to change your ways because you're stuck in Traditions he says You must have the Holy Ghost and if you do not you will die then I ask you this question let's go all the way back to the garden where it said if you do this you'll die and now we see if you don't go back to Pentecost you'll die then you tell me what type of voice it is that would contrast that and say you don't have to go back to Pentecost you won't die it's the voice of the serpent that would tell you shortly surely you won't die just believe there's a True Vine and there's a false fine and since the fall they've been worn at one another and all the way to the end they will be at War Return To Life brother Brown says how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank God in the last age there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit now listen I'm just going to put it out there it's going to tell you what the true bride is going to do it says in that day of gross Darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ they go together if you're not returning back to Pentecost you're not welcoming back the Lord Jesus Christ brother Aaron these are your opinions these are taken straight out of the message this is the word of the Lord for this day the false Vine got in and introduced the leadership of man subtle at first just like the serpent Rob the power robbed the life made it seem so good and seemed so reasonable but the elect will not be deceived the elect will know the truth they will return to the power of the new birth which breaks the curse of sin as we wrap up the Ephesian Church age I just want to tell you return to Pentecost return to the new birth leave the old birth behind forget it all and come to the Fountain of Life the power of the new birth amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we thank you so much for the truth that we see in your word Lord Lord we thank you how plain and how obvious you've made it Lord Lord but even I stand in here saying that recognize that it's plain and obvious because we had a Prophet come and make it that way to us thank you for that Lord thank you for the revealed word Lord thank you that the elect will not be deceived and Lord when we see people maybe that are straying or people that that don't see it exactly the same that's not that we're calling them anything Lord Lord I know if they're your elect you'll get a hold of them and Lord they'll be there and Lord that's that's my desire Lord I just want to see people saved Lord I just want to see people make it but Lord the more I study this message the more I realize the way that's got to happen is by the new birth and the way that's got to happen is by returning to Pentecost Lord the very thing the message came for to turn us back to the father faith of the fathers Lord may we be a people that are willing to contend may we be a people that won't give up our rights and lay down no matter who comes and says it makes fun and calls us fanatic maybe comes and says we don't need that anymore Lord we can go back to the word we can go back to the message and read where the messenger said the true bride will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ Lord I ask Lord right now with this young people before me with their heads bowed at their be any that have left their first love Lord if there be any that have fallen back lord away from that point I'm not saying they've gone out into the world or or just given up but if they've slid back from that place that passion that real zeal Lord may they find a place of repentance and Lord may they come back to that place and even go beyond it go further press deeper call out for more Lord I pray tonight that the words we've spoken Lord will find a resting place though we commit these people these young people and each one that's gathered into your hands lord they're your people though they're not for me or any other man to rule over they're to be ruled by the Holy Spirit Lord I pray that each one of them will know you and come Lord God to that experience of the upper room for themselves in Jesus name we commit them in this time into your hands [Music] Draw Me Lord and I'll come running after you and draw me draw me Lord Thou come running after you oh draw me being oh and I'll come running after you or Draw Me Draw Me Lord now come running you alone you alone are all I need oh can you just tell them that you're
