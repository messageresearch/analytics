under this roof tonight as a congregation but each one that's tuned in God you knew they would be listening and you knew what we had need of and we're just expecting the bread of life to be broken to

situation's things that we can handle Lord pressures that are pawn his father Lord we just want to commit it to you and to give it to you father Lord would know you're able to handle it we know you know the answers Lord everything order were so thankful father for the report Lord a brother on and what you're doing in his body in his life he's just so thankful Lord you're still the healer you're still the deliverer Lord you still move in impossible situations well god thank your father that's not you bless us this evening Lord you'd speak to our hearts you touch us Lord erectus or do you know those that are listening the hearts cry father even across the land Lord across the waters places we can't get to and we can't go to right now but Lord is not necessary that we go where we be there with our physical presence because know Lord we know there's angels they can go in places that men forbid Lord and jail houses bars and gates angels just go right into where they're at Lord and minister and moving among among them Lord as you did Peter and Paul and Silas Lord I know there's those are suffering father in places Lord that we can't get to but Lord we know the angels of God can come to the tonight and minister to them Lord and lift them up Lord and Lord and drive away the old spooky spirits and little things that are haunting them and Lord and put a joy in their heart we pray we commit this to you Lord in this service in your hands in Jesus name Amen amen let's turn to James chapter 4 a man just want to pick up on the thought again of submit yourselves therefore to God submit yourself therefore to God says here in James chapter 4 and verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you amen will let you be seated this evening also on a read from Romans 6 and verse 14 says for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace what then shall we sin because we're not under the law but under grace god forbid I notice his verse no you're not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness now we know also the Lord Jesus would say that no man could serve two masters so you're either going to yield yourself to one or to the other and we know when you get down to the bare bones of the whole thing that we're dealing with the day there's two powers there's God and there's Satan and and you know we could look at Satan and Satan has very very many faces and very many a very a lot of spirits and things he attacks in different ways some that he can use against you that don't necessarily work against me and and he tries to find out what works according to our human nature and how that we are built and so he tries to come in those areas but we know as we as he said no man could serve two masters so Paul is speaking here and he said whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you babe whether it's sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness but God be thanked think that you are the servitor we that you were the servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which delivers delivered unto you being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness so I'd like to also look at mainly three words tonight yield or a submit yield and commit you know what will we yield to what what are you be yielding ourselves to or what or they are in other words what are we permitting our granting rulership over us is it fear or regrets or past or our failures of the past or past hurts or pain inflicted by others or are we yielding to the complexes and the hurt and this calls from the pain or you know what you say well I can handle it you may handle it for a little bit but sooner or later your your your extent of your strength will run out you said well I can carry it well you can carry that for a little bit but sooner or later the strength that you have on your own you'll wear out and and you'll find yourself crash somewhere or are we here where we yield ourselves to God and allow him that with the unlimited strength you're the unlimited stamina or the unlimited abilities allow him to take our burdens and our pains away from us and and to deal with them you know as long as we think that we can do it we can't do it but as long as the way when we can get to a place where we know we can't do it and yield ourselves to God then he can do it he meant I'm thankful when I can get I love that when I'm able to get to that place you know we all come to places in our lives we come to as it said the metaphor or whatever said to the end of our road or end of our rope and we get to the place where we don't know where to go or how to go or how to handle something or our you know when we just kind of finally get to that pull spot to where we take our hands off the wheeler we take our hands off of it that's when I can move on your behalf that's what then if it's us trying to do it will fail we'll come to the end of our strength we'll come to the end of our stamina will come to end of our abilities will come to the end but God never comes to the end of his strength he never has an end to his abilities he never has a straight into his stamina amen he still can carry you through he still can move he still can move in obstacles amen he still can do all of those things it's the only thing God cannot do and that's fail hallelujah he can do anything else but fail we can fail governments can fail people can fail daddies mamas can fail children's can fail remember one thing God cannot do it's failed Amen there's one thing he can do that's fail he can do anything else but fail and so as long as we're trying in ourselves and we're depending upon our own abilities will do nothing amen but when we get to the place that would know we're nothing then God can use us God can use this amen the important thing now this is an important thing to master and here in our lifetime and sometimes it takes a lifetime to master amen but some it says that you know brother Brad was safe to speak of I kiss you he said especially us you young preachers or but he said even lay members alike there's one thing we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life and I I think that's where it comes down to is the war between our desire and God's desire he said but if we come down and we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life we have to master the thought of human ability well it's my abilities I'm gonna be the best I'm gonna do the best huh I'm going to get this driving this I got to do this I got to do but it comes to the point that we have to master the thought of human ability that human ability no matter if you're the best basketball player the best athlete or are the bestest or best that you have a limit to your ability you have the I have a limit to what you can do or what you can achieve or what you can accomplish but we serve a God as we said has no limits there's no limitations on him so he can take you places further and greater than you can ever take yourself he can provide for you more and greater than what you could ever provide for yourself he can do more for you than what you can do for yourself amen so if you ever get to the spot that we think we can do it or our own intelligence or own abilities we got to master that in such a way to where we can lay that aside and so God can use this right then it takes a complete surrender amen that's a hard thing to do is surrender self and and to surrender to the thought of I can or I will or you know and then even the age that we're living living living in is very much geared on on human abilities and the and they're lifting up or the exalting of human abilities you know never has there been an age to where there's been an exulting of of the human ability to you know to shoot a basketball to throw a thing or or to kill an animal or to do this or do that it's always I got the best I've done the best I've done this and now we got all the platforms to put out all the eye things you know and so but it but this is completely opposite to what God wants God wants a body of people that he can use that would yield themselves and yield their mind yield their spirits use their bodies whatever and so some pletely surrender to where it's not God not you doing it but it's God doing it inside of you see we cannot use one ability we got to make a complete surrender and to come to God you got to surrender him both body so our body soul and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and in me it's hard it's a hard thing this human nature was I I got this and I got that or you know we got these hurt so we got these pains and and we want to hold it because we're in holding that we think we're holding something we're not letting them out of their faults or out of their failures in and out of what somebody did to us but truly and holding all of that you're the one that's truly the prisoner you're held by those things and the best thing to do is let them go a man and so but all of this and in our mind and our spirit and our body I mean every part must be surrendered to God some people can give they're fed their bodies and some people can give their minds and some people but God wants it all amen I love the sermon brother Brett brother Donnie preach we listened to it a few weeks ago on the danger of Unser endured heart amen Samson could surrender his body I mean this one could surrender this but God wants everything and I want him to have everything of my life I want him to have every facet because I know that he'll take me further than I can take myself he can lift me higher than I could lift myself he can move me in places that I can't get and I can't go God can do things beyond the human abilities of the human understanding but what a human can manufacture God can go so far beyond all of that hallelujah but see we see we're always wanting to put our part into it you know how that will I did this or I did that something that we know you know that that's what we want you know well I just know it should be done this way but as long as you're doing it that way it's going to come out wrong Oh God will never use that effort maybe with the help of Lord he says we're going to show you amen how God cannot use your abilities but he can use your availability hallelujah amen we want to give it we don't but God want as I said well it's everything he but if you can give him your abilities then and also give him your availability and you can let him use it then God can do something with it but you know he said there's so much put upon the experiences of a seminary or some education or upon a relationship or a fellowship are we rest upon somebody else or are we rest upon men with abilities and he said the Bible says how can you have faith when you're preferring one another so when we're expecting saying this guy he's a great person or that's not a great person I'll lean on them that displeases God we must lean on God and God alone this is why you see people that fall away when a minister falls away or or they get they get all delusion and then turned upside down because some great Minister fell off the side of the earth and walked away from the Word of God he meant what was it their eyes or their abilities was on the wrong person and they was drawing strength from the wrong person God is a jealous God he wants you for himself aim in your mind for himself your body for himself your soul for himself your heart for himself he wants everything of us amen and so when our minds are for our eyes our heart is upon a man and his abilities or his ministry or his ability to sing or this sat in the other when they fall off somewhere or they hurt us in some way then we become disillusioned but listen God is trying to tell you get your eyes off the man he may have done you wrong he may have done wrong and he probably did do wrong well dirty human being that he is but listen that's not what we look at we look at what God did for us and what God is doing for us and how God is moving in our hearts and our life how God has changing me man is not doing this God is doing this hallelujah hey man so people should start trusting you know they put their trust in the ability of a man and then that manner do something to abuse that trust and man I'll do something to hurt that a man and then they'll go through years of pain and suffering because that trust was what they thought was a godly man what they thought was a good man what they thought was a righteous man and he does something amen and it causes an issue he said what is it we must yield ourselves not to man but to God because God is not going to break your trust God is not going to do something to wound you to hurt you know I wrote a letter here the other day as I sent a pen to somebody as a gift and was made this one it's just to come on my heart and they've been wounded by a facet of the message at the nomination of the messages I said I guess I could say it and they've been really wounded by people and I knew their wounds that they had cuz I've dealt with many of them has had these same words when they sing stuff and and I just wrote in my letter to them I said you know listen what we go through many times in the hurts that we face and the things that we face in our lives many times and I you know and you know it's not it's not what God did to us it's what man did to us he meant man I do you wrong a metahuman my man is nothing but a brute beast without the Holy Ghost he will do you wrong hey man now man with the Holy Ghost he won't do your own if he does he'll repent for it if he sees he made a mistake he'll come to you and say hey I'm sorry about that I shouldn't have done that but these others that you know they go right on and they make excuses for why they do things and how they operated how what to what they did and some of them committing sins and things in their lives and making excuses for it and living with it and hurting people but listen you can't look at that you got to turn back to God you got to yield yourself to God and say God I can't look at this stuff because when I look at it I get down I get depressed like I get it I'll get away from but I want to turn my eyes back to what you did for me and what you did for me is not betray me what you did for me has not hurt me what you did for me is you gave your life for me hallelujah but when we get our eyes upon a seemingly great person oh I can lean upon them that displeases God we must lead upon God and God alone we must trust the ability we must not trust the ability of ourselves or any man hello we must completely yield to God no ability I don't care whose it is he said who will ever be usable in the sight of God God has to get all of our abilities out of the way before he can achieve his purpose if he's got something for us to do and as long as we feel we're doing a pretty good job of it we'll never be used of God you know I have truly found that some of the sermons that touch the people is emotion when I walked out the back door and I said that was a terrible job that was horrible I don't even know if I want to preach anymore and you get all these kind of feelings going through and you realize this one was touched that one was dealt with that heart was dealt with and he was young right yes right God it wasn't me anyhow hey man it never has anything to do with me I don't want it to ever have the end to him true called God God called man never wants it to have anything to do with it all he can do is yield this is where the prophet of God would save himself and the guilt that God would use it's such a great magnitude in this hour he said the only thing I have to do with this is yield I yield to him and he speaks I yield to him and he does since it is him that doeth the work hallelujah and any Christian Amen that ought to be our hearts cry all I have to do with this as I yield and God does it for me he moves through me he says have you got something for us to do as long as we feel we're doing a good job of it we'll never be used of God you said whether you're making off a broad statement brother Brennan he said that is a broad one but look around and find out if it's not right or not look around today all the great achievement we think we've done where's Christian in the United States look at all of our churches denomination evangelist healing campaigns everything else worse than it ever was in the beginning it's worse off today than it ever was because we tried to do it in human abilities amen they gathered together they make long prayers they go out and how the other day says so many a hundred and fifty thousand or something gathered together both Protestant and Catholic saying some prayers praying some prayers making some prayer so forth they might as well not gathered it's nothing worth nothing in the sight of God he said well if I get critical forgive me but you got along you got to drive the thing down what good did it do nothing it'll never be until every person that professes to be a Christian will forget his own ability and yield himself to God then God can achieve his purpose by sending a man was not a revival but brother what he needs to do is first send the killing Oh hallelujah then we can revive we have to die before we can be born again amen he needs to can we need that he needs a killing of ourselves the tabernacle needs a killing and me with it pillow those there was a prophet of God and me with it all of us we need a killing so he can revive in a new life a new hold a new hope a new experience we need first a day a good day of mourning mercy we need a place of yielding to the spirit instead of so much dependent on schooling or upon our programs and our campaigns and all that we have we rely upon corporation so much with different minister to cooperate we allow this he said if we can get so many we won't do it we don't get so many we won't do it we won't go to cities without that we got this great big machine all this stuff happening we got to get out of the way from that that human ability we got to get to the place where you see we've now surrender our souls we surrender our lives even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic whoever it is so completely surrender to God and know that we are nothing then let God start from there and then he starts moving and working and that includes all of us every one of us he says that's the thing we've got to do mercy is he said history proves God always chooses the nobodies to become his somebodies hallelujah a song that they just come out with a I really like it says I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody all about somebody he's the somebody hallelujah he's the somebody but we get into and we get into such a struggle how how can I make this work how can I do this and we got our minds running a million miles an hour's sometimes we can't even sleep at night because we're trying to figure it all out and things are going in their minds they're running yield give it to God he'd put it very simply like this and how can I overcome he said it's just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole he's just up and down you ever seen a baby trying to get there or you know even open up one two years old trying to get your head sometimes her head comes out the armhole or this that the other and he says he trying to put it up down over everything and you can't do it you just say well put your coat on honey he can't do it little arms up down around it takes your steady hand he said oh how glad I am I can just yield my hand to the Father and say Lord Jesus I can't get it in there you helped me put the coat on I quit trying and just let him do it he said if a little baby keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it I can do it you know my one of my two little kids would be like that no I can do you know they get a little age old and they want to try to do it for themselves like I said sooner or later they finally come out of the room and lot times your heads out the harm pockets and their clothes are all kind of different ways and sooner or later they do figure it out but you know the stages that they go through and then you go through that I can do it I can do it and gods saying just let me have it I can do I can haven't let me have it I can do it let me have it he says he says he's just there and he can't do it and he said neither can i and neither can you but if you'll just hold still and let him do it just yield to him here Lord Here I am just let be nothing meet me nothing I yield you put my hand in the right place and let me tell you if you'll give your hand to him every time he places it it will be in the right place glory gonna try to put your hand out of a head hole or out of the other place a leg hole somewhere God knows exactly where your hands supposed to be and your hands supposed to be and your feet goes he knows all about you he knows all about your life and he said if you'll just say Lord you put my hand in the right place that's the victory that's the overcoming the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him and he overcome for you he knows the way whoa I know a man who knows the way through the wilderness he knows the way we don't he says then he stops and he says now don't struggle not him that will earth or him that runneth but God just let God do it what am I supposed to do with all this pain give it to God he'll put it in the right place what am I supposed to do with these complexes give it to God what am I supposed to do with my fear my anxiety give it to God yield say Lord I can't handle this but here's my hand here's my heart here's my body you put it in the right place this is like God just yield yourself to him walk home with that perfect satisfied faith hallelujah I so enjoyed Sunday service of faith anchoring place eternal resting place or faith rest a man that your roof faith rests in God will do it God can handle it God's Word won't fail and he won't fail what God has promised he's able to perform he says not just running and joining they're so running and doing that running and running and walking doing they just yield yourself to God walk with Him peaceful quiet uninterrupted hello I hope that's what you've been using this time for walking with God uninterrupted just keep on walking with Him that's right is that's what I told our brother just had to break down then listen this just had the breakdown just yield to him he's here he who knew he who knew what you have done and what caused you being and doing this way and everything about it he knows all about you well if I can just sink in a lot of pieces start flowing he knows what's been done he knows what you've been through he knows what's making you work to be the way you are and doing the way you are he knows all about you now and he says the only thing you have to do is just go do it and do this forget all about the past walk live for the future hello did you hear me lives before the future I think Tom might live for the future of 2020 or 2021 or 2030 40 whatever we go in that with I don't know that ain't the future that he's talking about live for the future in glory well how to change a lot of our attitudes of everyday life was living for that future many times we're living for the future the future 401 K or the future this that and the other future job promotion future this and our future is very limited because our eyesight is limited don't I want you to understand if you walk by these eyes your future is limited if you walk with this eye sight alone and all you can see is this that and the other around you your future is limited but if your eyesight can be changed from eyes of flesh and to eyes of faith and you begin to look beyond all the things that's going on around us and and the chaos around us and the problems all around us and the situations all around us and they ain't all of us in the whole world if that we could do anything about it if we wanted to and we do want to and ain't nothing we can do about it but my eyes are not going to continue to look right here around me but God I want my eyes to look into my future and then we start looking into that future this around here changes your focus changing your worries changing the things around you change because you're not living for just right now you can realize I got a greater future hallelujah and you forget all the past and you keep walking and living for the future and glory and the presence of God now there is a perfect way and there's a permissive way and even brother Brent I'm talking about that in this situation here he says I feel that if God here on the platform can show me things that's being in my rooms and so forth he's able to tell me just where he wants me and what he wants me to do but I feel as long as I've got it all hooked up and or a feel like when he won't put he won't put his hands on it as long as I'm doing it he said that's the way it is anything as long as you're doing it it's if someone talks about you or you talk back about them god can't fight your battles you're fighting yourself let loose and let him do it just commit it to him and so if he's doing it that's the perfect way but when we get our hands on it if we ain't careful we're gonna get in the permissive way because it's our way and our best side what we see fit but God has a perfect way and he said let loose and let him do it and just committed to him he says the greatest weapon I know use prayer and I write four or five other things but this is one of them the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian has today is committed to God Wow how many times do we use that greatest weapon or do we use our own abilities he said because when you can't do nothing about it and you commit it to him God to take care of it keep your faith there I can't do nothing about my child she's all out or he's out this is out and I can't do nothing about it I'm a human ability and humanly speaking there's nothing I can do I'm giving it to you God and God will do something about it commit it to God and we'll go through a few of these on committal now believe it step on it step out on it claim God's promises just committed to God commit that waste to the Lord he will bring it to pass whatever you want but as long as you're holding it and you're saying it's mine and I swear now I can see it now I'll see if I'm any better now I'll see if I can make this work see it won't work you committed to him and forget about the rest of it and go testify on other things you don't even see and believe it and not what you see it's what you believe it's not what you feel he never said to you feel it he said do you believe it that's how you saved by faith that's how you're healed is by faith believe it faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you don't see taste feel smell or hear you just believe it and commit it and act upon it as if I tell you anything and Christ doesn't say that it's so then don't believe it if I tell you something that he's done and he testifies that he that he's done it then you believe him is that fair enough I'd say any man now the gift doesn't heal no one is here that the gift doesn't heal no one the gift is not for healing no more than a gospel preacher is sent for saving he can't save anyone he can preach under the power to bring people to a knowledge of the word of God and comforted to their confession and God does a saving that's the same thing this is he's got a sign he's preaching under the power of the breeze conviction to human heart they come to the altar by faith they accept Jesus and get saved and then the results come is that right but when we make a committal to God and committed to him and believe him then the results will come healings the same way demonology he talks about committing again he said you committed to God he spoken his word in my name that shall cast out devils nothing shall harm me by no means then we're wrapped in the bundle of life what other life of God ever believer it's just like when you receive the Holy Ghost God gives you a bankbook and at the bottom of every check is got Jesus name signed on him just whatever he got need up fill out the check send it in he'll make it good do you believe that how many believes that the pot the deposit was put in the bank at Calvary he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and the stripes were healed any of those redemptive blessings that belongs to every believer if you're scared to fill the checkout well it won't do you no good but if you'll fill it out and then tear it off and put it in your pocket it'll never do it no good but tear it off and give it to him committed to him and watch him take care of it he uses this this terminology he said I used to have to shift for myself but since I found him to be in my fight be my father why he does it for me I found out this in my 21 years of experience of preaching the gospel any job that's too big for my Lord to attack what's the use of me trying it well he found that out in his experiences I feel like it probably goes good for me too because he'd come up against some pretty big stuff you know at one time he came up as a of a table float member that started the table in the air they wished doctors had lifted up and he come and used all kind of names on it and he said you know the name of the most higher this setting the other name of this church something different they don't remember all them right off the off the bat but trying out different names that table never moved but he said but I command you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to come down he said it came down so hard like too broke off all four legs he said that's the power in the name of Jesus Christ amen if he would show us there's power in the name of Jesus Christ to bring a table back to the ground and he's and his word enough and concerned enough to back up his name when it's called upon to bring a table down to the ground don't you think that he's still concerned enough to call and he's called upon in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to bring your cancer down to bring your sugar diabetes down and bring your blood pressure down to bring whatever demon that's oppressing you to bring him crashing to the ground that's what he's he is committed enough to his name that he would bring a table down I know he's just as committed to his name when you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus and fever has to leave it and sin has to go and depression and fears and anxieties at the name of Jesus Christ has to fall prostrate and come submit to the name of Jesus Christ he said when he he said when I come something too big he said I find anything too big for my Lord to attack what's the use of me trying it I just give it to him committed to him he promised to take care of me everyone here tonight he promised to take care of you everyone on the stream tonight he promised to take care of you you said well I ain't got nobody to take care of me I'm by myself no you're not he promised to take care of you and I can tell you one thing he'll take care of you better than any daddy better than any mama better than anybody that around you any kin folks in the church he'll take care of you better than any brother any friends this God has never for suck one of his loved ones one of his children a man if a bird came fall to the ground and God don't know about it God knows when that demons attacking you God knows when you're going through that thing and at the name of Jesus Christ it has to fall when opposition comes I committed to him because he said he would do it for me and if he can't do it I know there's no need in me trying it but the problem is a lot of us say well I I got this you know special in the hour that we're living in young people especially put on that facade of I'm cool you know I got this there's nothing wrong with me you asking much nothing I got it you know they try to be cool because they afraid they show these hurts or these pains it would it would make them less cool or less strong or less something but listen on the inside they're all tore up and hamburger meat it out seemed like just tore up and went through a grinder and spirits were attacking them on means anything just be honest and say God I ain't got this I don't have it I can't handle it I'm giving it to you gotta take care of it he said that so that feel if I know he'll take care of because he said he would I know there's no need in me trying it so we'd might as well he said there's no need in us trying to so he might as well to live peaceably and go on he will bring it all out right I don't to put some step on us as we leave tonight we turn off the stream the night head I that do we ought to just see them you know what I'm just gonna live peaceably he's gonna bring it out all right he's going to take care of it there's no need of getting all fretted and stood up about it the Lord knew I needed that because these goofy real does restrictions they're puttin on us about this church I'm excited starting to get against my red-blooded American male syndrome hey man you know somewhere about 1776 they signed the paper that lifted all restrictions hey man anyhow and you get all stood up and you get all mad and angry and there ain't nothing you can do about it seemingly but I'm gonna give it to God God sees what's going on and they gonna get by with none of it he's just going to make it all right I love him for that hallelujah I love him for that he says you know the doctor may say you can't get well but what does God say God said I could you know it really God's Word is not dependent upon what percentage the doctor gives you to live it ain't dependent upon if it's a bad case of cancer a good case of cancer bad huh high blood pressure sugar by whatever whatever kind of disease what His Word is not dependent upon what the doctor's diagnosis is His Word says you can therefore I can I will I do believe his word said I can so I can His Word said I do because I'll do his word said I beloved to believe so I believe Amen this word that's what we're singing is not some man's words some man's decree it is God's Word and God said I could if you're sick tonight God's Word says he can't be healed and he will heal you according to his word he's a well I'm still sick as I was last night that don't make a bit of difference just makes you stronger belief be more of a miracle tomorrow night if it for me to get it said that's what when that's he said when you say amen to that he said that's Abraham's seed don't stagger at the promises of God the doctor did all he could do and that's all he can do but God hasn't done oh he can do that's shouting ground right there and I want you to understand when the devil has done all he can do that's all he can do he has limitations he has limited power as we said if he had enough he would bring it up but he ain't got enough amen but God's got enough and when he moves he moves amen when he moves upon that cancer that cancers gotta flee when he moves when I had blood pressure and he moves on those things around and the things around this on your body or whatever's going on in your mind and your spirit when God moves God moves and it will flee because God has yet done all he can do he still has more our it's unlimited mercy he says here let me go back any job that's too big for God I can't tackle I just commit it to him and go on he says many times person will accept him as their healing that go out and aurochs shame to confessing you should never be ashamed to confess you should never be ashamed of him he said my people will never be ashamed you should never be ashamed no matter what takes place you should be right up in front to stand on your testimony for God can only save you and heal you as you testify you can only hear you as you testify he's sitting at the right hand of the Father to make intercession upon your confession is it isn't how loud you cry how hard you beat the altar how many good deeds you do it's your faith that saves you if you're confessing with your lips and coming from your heart he goes to work as a high priest sitting on the right hand of the Father to make intercession upon your confessions Hebrews 3:1 he cannot do one thing for you until you first believe it accept it confess it to be so and the people today they go and said well I felt better last night but today I'm so bad I just can't understand it that's exactly when you lose your confession and you drop it and no matter who you are how saintly how godly if you're a minister clergymen if you're a deacon whoever you are it's been a Christian for 50 years if you go out here tomorrow and lose faith that you're Christians start telling people you're not a Christian anymore you'll backslide he said one only by your confession can you be saved that's the most powerful weapon that God put in the hand of man is committal and accept what God has done and it'll do it every time believe it and stay with it hallelujah so much here we going down hold on me her memory dismisses here too good to pass up I got to go back didn't get it highlighted to catch my attention but I just caught some things here he says talking about cancer and how it starts developing and sales starts growing sometimes you'll hardly know it's there and it's moving on sucking the blood the doctor he said what if the doctor can't get it he said I made myself clear that I respect doctors in hospitals and pray constantly for them what we were what would we do without them but I'm trying to tell you what the disease is he told by there's something behind this disease and we I mean brother Brendan was one of one that came in and said it's not just cancer as the spirit he identified it what it was behind it a demon and he says God seemed today coming that people would walk in unbelief like this mercy hisses in 57 where we had today and with this love he let us happen with his love he let us have doctors in hospital sure he did that's his love gift to you so for you that don't believe in doctors there you go but the very first thing you should have his faith in God that's the first thing amen so therefore what a doctor will say shouldn't shake what your faith says and if faith says he heals you if God pronounces you to go there ain't enough medicine the world to keep you here it's all in God's hands don't by leaving the world but notice he said this cancer is grow and he's sucking your blood and the first thing you know you start getting weaker and the doctor says I can do no more about it you go to God and that's God to heal you you make compromises that you'll do and when you're doing you fill in your heart the prayer of faith shall save the sick God said that as the prayer of faith is prayed then you feel assured now watch right close now ninety percent yes 99 out of 100 was hope instead of faith he's in the first little symptom rise you'll doubt it and he goes to show it wasn't god-given faith god-given faith won't take no for an answer Oh hallelujah that's why I said knock and keep on knockin seek and keep on seeking god-given faith won't take no for an answer no matter what is happening hallelujah you came Bluff at the devil you can Bluff him but you got to have the goods to prove it he recognized his faith hey man don't matter that when you came Bluff him you got to have the goods to reprove it he recognized faith he has to but it's the only weapon we have in our hands now what produces faith is prayer prayer of faith shall save the sick suppose say a person comes with a growth the growth is prayed for and the shirts of the Holy Ghost says it's finished the patient goes out and the first thing you know they feel better what happens anybody knows anybody never hunted a big game or a body high starts decaying goes through that amen the human body shrinking and these sales begin to shrink and die first day is shrinking the second day is shrinking the Thursday third day it begins to swell because it's contaminated and it begins to fall away he said that's the reason people are all stunted about Jesus being in the grave three days and nights it was within three days and nights because David said I'll not leave my soul in Hell neither wife suffer my whole One to see corruption upon that solemn promise jesus said you destroy this temple I'll raise it up in three days he knew that no sale could corrupt that not one cell could grew up with some time within the 72 hour time frame God would raise him up for the profit it said so so you see when they cells begin to break and it begins to come the next day they come back testify and all I can see better a cataract I can see better tumors go I can feel better well what happened starts getting worse worse all of us said oh well praise God I guess I lost my healing I'm so sick I can't stand up I lost my healing he said all you poor excuse that's the best sign in the world you've got your healing what is it the death growth in you is breaking up as a heartbeat it pulls the blood and it purifies the body and the third day usually have sickness and fever that dead growth is laying on you rotten and away he said what is it healing is in the body don't give up keep confessing he's my healer hallelujah but it goes on down he says see a many if sickness is a blessing become bi people told my sickness is the curse of God upon you in this setting the other he said if sickness is a blessing and Jesus came to heal the sick everywhere then he defeated his healing and purpose in coming which would you say would be a blessing if a loving God or a father who give life or promised you a long life on the earth and you'd obey Him you come and strike you down with a devil and let him lay there on you and eat you up with a bed and cancer TP oh this is God this is God's love to me or would you rather say the devil struck me down and a loving God just come to heal me [Music] hallelujah the loving God has come to heal me and give me life again Jesus never did tell his disciples never preach that anywhere or ask the disciples to go tell people they must stay pinned down with sickness to obey Him come on now you don't have to stay pinned down with that devil hallelujah somebody's been pinned down with bitterness or pinned down with this or pinned down with unforgettable and to be pinned down with some unforgiving spirit it's time to you rebelled against that thing it's I'm a God cold son and I'm not going to bow to you but I'm gonna submit myself to Jesus Christ people get pinned down by depression and pinned down by every kind of spirit and he'll listen there's a power to cast that thing out there's a power in the name of Jesus Christ that every demon will leave trembling how do you he didn't teach them he didn't go around teaching or have him preached they had to stay pinned down with sickness to obey him he sent them to liberate them sickness hallelujah to liberate them from sickness and to preach to those that are in captivity and those are in bondage he come to bring deliver he's got to be either the author of life or the author of death if you put sickness on God and say God is making you sick to die then you got to make him the author of death when death and life can associate together mercy he goes on many places we're bringing us down he said if we commit everything anything to God and believe it like our children or whatever more let's believe that God will answer that prayer the day before I left to go away the phone constantly the ring and mothers with their children saying I pray for the pray for them pray for them I said just commit them to God that's all you have to do don't put your hands on it anymore let God have it if you're going to do something about it then God will stand back and let you go ahead until you're finally finished but when you commit it to God and let him have it he will do it you just believe him just stand back don't work just believe oh ma there's so many wonderful things here I know I can't get to a mall there's last one as we bring this musicians could come committing submitting committing and yielding to God see I think of our sister sitting here to help trouble on that crunch how much power that God can give you to move up with strength and faith to lay that crunch down and walk away without it he's I sing that little Georgie Carter with her little limp looking much bigger than a broomstick been laying there nine years and eight months couldn't move they'd put a draw sheet under couldn't even get good put a bad pan under but when the power of God struck that girl out of that she'd come run down to that organ

George before she passed away so this is heart right here look there looked at that picture of smiling face thinking of a little girl that laid there for nine years couldn't get up couldn't move but
