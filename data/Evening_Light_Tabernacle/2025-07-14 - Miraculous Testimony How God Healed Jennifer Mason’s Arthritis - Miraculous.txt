========================================

Praise God. I believe the Lord's doing some things tonight. I &gt;&gt; just want to give a little testimony that I want to share with you or Sister Jennifer Mason wrote me the other day. She said, "I was healed instantly of arthritis when I went through the prayer line." This is from camp. said, "I've hurt for several months now. So much that I've had to sit in recliner about half the day because of the pain. I've been on Moxyan to slow the progression. The weekend of youth camp was the hardest ever. Severe joint achiness. After the prayer line, I noticed all pain was gone. And I've hadn't had any joint pain since." I was praying in my heart that God would heal me because I have so much that I still have to do on a daily basis. I was also praying for my family. When you verbally rebuked the spirit of arthritis, it left. Honestly, honestly, I expected a gradual healing, but God gave me a miracle. &gt;&gt; And I'm so grateful. And I've stopped medication because I know I will not need it. It damages kidneys and liver after years of use. And I have been testifying to everyone of what God has done for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just asked today, you know, about it. I said, "Are you still walking in victory?" She said, "Absolutely. I've had no joint pain or inflammation since that night. It was really a miracle. And I thank can't thank God enough. I believe that all arthritis has stopped in his tracks. Amen. is stuck in his track. Amen. Our God reigns. Our God's a healer. Our God's a deliverer. If he'll do it once, he'll do it twice. If he does it twice, he'll do it three times. He's a God of one chance, two chances, three chances, four chances. This God is a God who will not quit. He keeps pouring out his blessings.
