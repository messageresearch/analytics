[Music] why don't we stand together for a moment [Music] all right I get to be the bad guy again we just wanted to make another announcement about the social distancing and safety at the church so before we get started in the service just wanted to get this past so if anybody is planning to go to the wedding of the announcements about the logistics of the wedding for the weekend so I'm not going to talk about that but we do ask that you continue to try to social distance if you can and please if you have any kind of signs of any sickness if you have a cough your nose is running if you have anything that could potentially be infectious even if you don't think you have a virus for the corona virus but anything that could be infectious please help all of us out and please stay home

be smart about it so thank you for working with us and we're praying that it won't affect our church I know it's affected many but if it if it's anything that you may feel is a sickness coming on you

mercy and grace Lord just convict us of the Lord lord help us to repent Lord and make it right God we commit our hearts to you everything father for your glory and for your honor in Jesus name hey man you turn in your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 6 a man and also Hebrews an eye on it's good to be in the house the Lord a man Ephesians 6:13 says wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore also Hebrews 9 24 said for Christ is not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the true but unto heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as a high priest in Earth in the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment so Christ has once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation well look at that again and unto them that look for him shall he appear amen we'll let you be seated I don't think that we would we could all I mean I believe we all could agree that we live and we're living in the evil day evil time man's mind is on evil continually and seemingly going further and further towards evil as they get further and further away from God but I believe that as we read in the scripture there's a people that's able to stand in the most evil day as he said here in the scripture he said that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore I believe there's a people in turn up regardless of what you see all the bad news and all the things there's plenty of that's out there but there's a people on earth that are standing there's a people on earth that are standing for righteousness they're standing for holiness they're standing for the supernatural God to move among them they're standing for the kingdom of God and there's a people on this earth as able to take the pressures of this age because they have been pressurized for this age and I like to speak to you that again on pressure pressure eyes and realizing that's all that's going on in the world and and I believe there's a people here that really realizes that all this going on there in the world is just setting the scene for they're going away amen and that's what this is all about this is a setting the scene for your going away or your catching away as a thief would come in the night amen you know looking at this word pressurized it means to be brought to or be maintained and an atmospheric pressure higher than that of the surroundings or greater than that of the surroundings in other words there's a power greater or higher than the power that's on the outside a power a power higher or greater than that of its surroundings you know I've gotten a jet plane now I know there's many here there's I've been in a plane and you get up and you fly overseas especially and they got you know they've got it now do I remember as a kid they didn't have this but and you know has technology has progressed now you get in a plane you got your own little screen you can watch whatever you want to you can game whatever you want to I mean there's all kind of options out there but they have a map that you can watch and you can watch where the plane is and and on that map it'll tell you the temperature of the on the outside the altitude all those sayings and you get up at a certain place and you begin to realize it's not very pleasant on the outside you may be sitting in a short sleeve shirt and you may be comfortable as you can be you know squeezed together in that little seat but on the outside it can be somewhere around 65 below zero and but at that plane has been built in such a way to withstand the pressure of all the things that's going on around it and it has been pressurized so that the inside can keep its ability to be comfortable to have a comfortable temperature to be able to relax as much as possible and on the outside it can be cold it can be all kind of things storms lightnings and all that thing around there happening but there's on the inside of that plane it has been pressurized for that atmosphere or for that place and it shows that what's on the inside is greater because unless there's something that cracks or something that malfunctions in that plane and thank God I've never had that happen while I've been in the plane you know they give you all the rundown of what you're supposed to do and out of the roofs supposed to come some cups and you stick it over your face and breathe naturally and normally I don't know how many by can do that in that kind of situation but anyway if that happens I don't know how I would react but I've never been there but apparently that is there but you know that plane is built to withstand things that and then and can go to those places and be in those places and while on the outside it is uncomfortable it's freezing it's whatever on the outside but on the inside there's a prayers of pressured cabin and it's been pressurized to withstand to where that things on the outside cannot get to the inside and I believe that there's a people upon this earth that has been pressurized and been pressurized by the seal of the Holy Ghost now this this seal you don't have to worry about it blowing apart or breaking apart or falling apart and the time of chaos and the time of trouble or if it's cold outside hot outside this seal will hold this Holy Ghost gospel this Holy Ghost pressure pressure rises about a body of believers to a place that no matter what's going on the outside what's taking place on the outside whether hail has come to earth or whether whatever is going on this on the inside is pressurized for what for this and getting able to take it now we know that also as astronauts as we begin to lift off the earth they also are in a pressurized capsule and they have pressurized suits they're they're gearing up and they're becoming a men geared up to be able to withstand where they're going or to be able to take where they're going and you know Anna as we spoke about this here the last time on a couple Wednesday's ago that as they're sitting on top of that capsule in there and the time is counting down to they're going away they're there looking to where they're going they're sitting there looking up into the heavens because that's where they're going they're not looking and you know if they're sitting on that coaster out there on the Florida coast they're not looking back over at New York are not looking to Louisiana or toward the west they're looking up a ma'am because that is where they're going they're not planning on going to Louisiana or going to the other coast or going to the other side of the world they're planning on leaving this atmosphere and going into another atmosphere they're looking at where they're going amen God has also has a stir and they have their eyes trained on where they're going a man if you're planning on going to hell just keep looking at hell if you're planning on staying here on earth just keep looking at this earth but you're planning on leaving this world you better train your eyes to look to another dimension to look to where you're going because you know even NaturallySpeaking uses human eyes you're generally looking to where you're going if you're walking this way you better be looking where you're going you know you see people that ain't you see videos of people that not looking where they're going they're looking at their phone or they're talking to somebody and they got their head they're distracted and they hit themselves upside the head with a pole they walk right into it because why they're not looking where they're going but I believe there's a people with their eyes fixed on another dimension they're not concerned so much with what's going on around them remember but they're moving and they're moving towards that other dimension as that dimension is blending into this dimension there's also a people that's ready to take that step into that other dimension you know what I also looking at this it was very interesting that as there's also astronauts or circling the Earth they're going at a greater speed than what this earth is going at they're going at somewhere around 17,000 200 miles an hour that's a great speed I haven't never been that fast don't ever plan to go in that fast as far as NaturallySpeaking but in going that fast they see about sixteen to seventeen or so sunrises and sunsets a day you know and they're moving around there they're not looking at Earth and seeing all the problems on earth they can't see all the problems on earth they can't see the things that are going on they have been lifted up into another dimension to another atmosphere they're moving at a faster rate or faster speed and brother branham will talk about that other dimension and move this here it says but it's moving just a little faster than we are hallelujah and let me tell you Church if you're looking at the church problems and you're looking at situation around you you're looking at family problems you're looking at sicknesses you're looking at this you're not moving fast enough he meant it's time that we begin to move in another atmosphere we operate in another atmosphere with more sincerity about us and longing looking to where we want to go a man brother branham would use this and look he would say look like going down the road sometimes maybe certain scene will come and somebody to say looked just like right now look at that organ look at that organ see you did it automatically the word look causes you many of you some of your stubbornly just looking this way but if many of you it kind of makes you want to look what I'm talking about because this is a voice that spoke and it told you there's something to look at and there's many voices that are speaking in this day and they're saying look at this and look at this and look at this and look at this in their eyes if we're not careful we're look at all kinds of things and get caught up in it but there is a greater voice there is a voice speaking in this day and it's saying don't look at what's going on around here look beyond those things there's something greater there's something is going on all of what's going on around you it's only setting up the atmosphere are they climate for you're leaving here but see everybody's looking everybody's looking for something they're looking for something to happen you know the world is constantly looking there they're looking for radar on their radars or whatever they got nowadays screens around the world every nation you know trying to keep their defenses up you know trying to keep their eye on the sky looking for somebody to push the button to send a nuclear weapon look look everyone is looking but there is some people on this earth that is also looking there is a bride that is looking for the coming of her Lord and he said unto those that are looking for my appearance will I appear to them hallelujah Amen we're all looking but it depends on what voice we're listening to some of us are saying look for this and look for that he said but what is happening to the world they're going on in their blindness and they're getting blinder and more or all the time as it was in the days of Noah people were blind they couldn't see what was going on all the things that were going on in this day he said but we who look for Christ the second time it is an inside of his soon coming when we see the days as it was in the days of Noah or we see the day as it were in the days of lot and it vexes our soul and it hurts us to see the world go in the way that it's going and the things that are going the way that they're happening hurts a man it hurts it you don't want to see it get this way but it's prophecy we can't stop it governments can't stop it they came put enough laws and regulation out there to stop it it's heading down this track why because prophecy has said it to be so amen and it said that it was going to be the climate that is going to be on there as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot what is it is nothing but an in sign to look at he's coming we see something is about to happen but it depends on what you're looking at what you'll see no one new by the Word of God that was coming to flood but by faith he saw it and he knew that it was going to be because God word promised it either we believe this word that we don't believe this word hey man but the world could not see it because it didn't line up to their beliefs it didn't line up to what they thought it didn't line up to their political ideas they didn't line up to how they wanted you to be then it didn't line up to them and they found themselves and in water over their heads they found themselves destroyed because they could not see what Noah saw and it wasn't a popular message what Noah saw neither is this a popular message it wasn't a popular message what Noah was preaching it's going to rain it's going to come you better get in this heart why are you building this heart why are you doing all this because I've seen another vision I'm saying God has come and revealed something to my heart I'm putting one more nail in I'm cutting another board I'm going right along according to what God's Word says what you living the way you're living why you'd believe the way you believe because I've caught another vision it's not the vision of this world and what the devil wants you to believe in to see I caught a vision from another realm and there's also people here on this earth that's also caught that vision there is a people that's caught a vision they caught a vision of a destruction and there get into the structure as hard as they can go but there's also another people that's called a vision of leaving here hallelujah but Noah kept his eyes on that word the church the bride that called out knows that the coming of the Lord is at hand regardless how much the world is progressed and and we've been succeeded in and opening up things in the physical realm and scientifically speaking amen going to the moon it that means nothing to the believer only a sign that the coming of the Lord is at hand we see nations breaking we see nations falling apart we see the world being pulled apart the church move is coming apart and we're taught that when we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved well as these things begin to happen the church itself the bride together tighter binding itself tighter and tighter and tighter to the Word of God it's a great day we're living in Oh hallelujah it's an evil day but it's a great day everybody's looking for something you might already be looking past this service already looking for to know what's happening tomorrow or what you're going to do when you get home what I got to do tomorrow might be something another next week you got you're already looking to and then that's our problem we keep our eyes on other things we're looking for this thing to happen or this neighbor to come over or this friend to come or that to happen everybody's looking for something but as a group believers tonight assemble together let's fix our thoughts and our principles and our heart upon the coming of the Lord hallelujah looking for Christ who shall appear the second time without sin unto salvation to those that are believe and that are looking for him to come but the devil is constantly trying to get our eyes on what other things are going on and sicknesses that we got in this coronavirus over here and that over here and this problem over here and this world problem issues and this and in your mind just about ready to go explode what is it we get out of focus we'll get our eyes off on what's really important it's the devil's job to get your eyes off the coming of the Lord that's what's important I know people don't believe in it they don't some people don't believe in the coming of the Lord but I believe in it I believe in the rapture of the church I believe that there's a going away I believe there's a people here that's been judged by the word and the Word of God has placed upon a robe of righteousness the seal of the Holy Ghost upon their lives adopted sons and daughters of God that are not going into judgment but they're going into a rapture they're leaving this whole world this world is going into judgment but if you want to go go with them I'm not going I'm looking unto Jesus brother Branham talks about a camera he had brother Billy Billy Paul's a young boy and had taken pictures and he can to his dad said take that picture out there's a beautiful swirl crack cactus and it just look at that incredible he said so I threw up the camera and he said I saw not one stock but I saw three stocks not two but three stocks and I took it down there was only one stock I put it up again and there was three stocks he said let's just say it this way sometimes we get out of focus and if we're not careful all the things that are going on around us is going to get us out of focus it's going to get us out of stamp it's going to pull us one way or the other if we give our eyes to it no heart to it and our thoughts to it it's there to pull you away from one thing the coming of the Lord Jesus this is what he said again in Luke chapter 21 and verse 25 he said there shall be signs in the Sun and the moon and the stars and upon the earth distress of Nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's heart failing them for fear and for looking after these things which are coming upon the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and great glory and when they's when these things begin to come to pass what do you do look up lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth not they meant what are you looking at what are you so what you're seeing depends on what you're looking with if you're looking with these two eyes you'll see the things of this world the problems around you the situations around you if no one would have looked with these two eyes he would have never built a boat if Moses would have looked with these two eyes he would have never went and seen a burning bush it made excuses why there must be a bad drought going on something happened everybody wasn't looking with these two eyes something else grabbed ahold of him just as no something else grabbed ahold of until where it wasn't looking with these two eyes now I no doubt these two eyes tried to take over sometime no doubt he had mine battles and things things he had to deal with wanted to quit wanted to give up there's 120 years of this going on I don't know what all he had to deal with all I know is he continued to walk with God and continue to do what God told him to do and God sent the rain God sent the judgment and the boat floated and he was saved and his family was saved hallelujah I don't know when you may have mine battles you may feel like giving up but you just keep walking with Jesus you keep walking according to the Word of God got us in the rain gotta send the judgment of the things that are bothering you God will move those obstacles out of your way just could walk one with God keep looking into the unseen God has are people that are looking away from the world the world wants you to look at it the world wants you to see all the problems and the bad news everything's bad news they don't want you to see any good news it wants you to believe that everybody's hateful and spiteful and ungodly and everybody's wrong and everybody's everybody's just terrible person than ain't true it wants you to believe that there's no hope and mankind that ain't true it wants you to believe there's more problems than our solutions there's more sicknesses in there as health there's more disappointments and there are happy times and what happens we as people if we're looking with these eyes when disappointment comes our reaction and how we react and how we how we how we carry ourselves after a disappointment tells us what we're looking at and what we're looking with come on somebody even a person can go through disappointments in their lives and and they react and they get bitter towards God it shows you you're looking at the wrong thing you're not looking at the promise of God you're not looking at God himself you're looking at middle line poor old me how bad I got and how terrible I'm having and how and nobody else was having a bad day like I'm having come on now this is our human about human so thoughts aren't human they're thinking and how we turn to ourselves well I'm having such a bad day there's nobody having a bad day like I'm having instead of looking saying I'll have such a good God there's nobody got a God like I got he'll take care of me when nobody else to take care of me he'll feed me when nobody else will feed me he'll heal me when nobody else can heal me he'll deliver me when nobody else can deliver me hallelujah I have a great guard oh if our minds can turn away from our disappointments and our sicknesses and our problems and realize God is God and his word don't change God is God he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same God right now that can move aside every problem every sickness every trouble and her family strife everything in a moment in a twinkling of an eye if you take your eyes off of what you're looking at and look to Jesus look at him my brother Timothy all I see is strife all I see is problems all I see is the world has fallen apart huh all I see is everybody's terrible everybody's horrible there's no good person in this world you know Isaiah at one time looked at Jesus he could have looked at problems he could look at situations around him his life maybe wouldn't go in the way he planned it but one day he caught another glimpse and he looked away from the world and he looked to see him and when he saw him he said I see a counselor I see a Prince of Peace I see the mighty God I see the everlasting father that's what I said looked away in song hallelujah Daniel one time he could have saw a lot of problems he coulda saw a kingdom that was turning against him he gonna saw a king that decreed he going to a Lions there but he looked away from the Lions Den he looked away from the other problem and he said I see a stone you'd out of the mountain without hands I see a God who's able to move when there's impossibilities zico he mine and his life no doubt was not going the way he played but he looked away and he looked one day at him and he said well he's a will in the middle of the will hallelujah he's a will in the middle of the wheel and he's the hub that everything's connected to he's the big wheel that's run by faith and all of us are turned and spokes connected to that wheel by the power of the Lord Jesus that's what Ezekiel saw when he looked away what are you looking at well I had this problem and I got this going on and I'm bitter I'm just mad ain't nobody gonna make me happy no as long as you're looking at that ain't nobody gonna make you happy but if you'll turn and look let me say if you just continue in that way God can't even make you happy he said well I need God to do this will change your attitude and God can move listen it's our attitude that causes a lot of issues pressure gets to us and we ain't quite pressurized amen things of life and things around us and our attitude stinks sometimes I just be honest with you it gets on the world the things of the world and all the stuff around us I don't know how many he's dealt with depressions in his last few months spirits won't ever hand me and my wife were trying to set aside time in the morning I meant to have devotions together and pray and the more we try to go into that realm seem like the more the devil fights that tells me I'm going the right direction hey man that's what he's gonna do he coming against you to try to get your eyes of what's really going on around you what's really happening around you John the Baptist he could have looked and said my head's fixing to be on a platter government's turned against me things are going wrong but when he looked and he caught sight of him he saw a dove and heard a voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in that's what he saw when he looked at Jesus hallelujah they saw him because the Spirit came down from heaven like a dove said this is my son Noah when he looked away to see him Noah saw the just judgments of God coming upon the people of the world who had rejected his word listen all this burning and things that's going on is only a precursor it's only a precursor of the judgment that's about to come upon this world lawlessness homei amen things that's coming upon this earth and the situation is going to happen when this bride lifts off of here I had somebody email me telling me they don't believe in the rapture I'm sorry I'm not going with you don't take my hope away that's the only hope of ever getting out of this situation we're in how many coming told Noah they didn't believe in a boat how many come told Noah they don't believe in rain well I got my quotes and I got my this and I got my scientific proof it ain't gonna rain it ain't never rain it as possible to rain no one said God said is going to rain all I know is the Prophet said there's a bride getting ready to go in a rapture he preached a message called the rapture so sound like you're listening to another voice not the voice I've been trained to listen to him Moses when he looked away Moses had all kind of problems he had a government behind they was trying to kill him he's running on the backside of the desert he had all kinds of reasons to hide behind a bush somewhere but he saw when he looked away he saw a bush on fire the pillar of fire had been come down into a bush and when Moses draw close to it he heard a voice that said take off your shoes the I am is here hold hallelujah the I him is here it did not I was not I will be the I am eternally I am he saw him that's what he saw in the burning bush Israel they had all kind of problems they had fire serpents going among them because of their sin and their disbelief in God amen but God raised up brass certain and said look and live change what you're looking at quit looking at this below and look to that look and live amen what was it was speaking of the suffering of Christ for the judgment of the sick and the lost in the atonement Oh hallelujah I love hate deals with this because some people can believe for the atonement for sin but they can't believe for the atonement of sickness Jesus was that atonement as Moses lift up the brass serpent the wilderness so must the Son of Man be lifted up for the same purpose they had sinned and they got sick but he that came to take away their sins and their sicknesses and that's what Jesus did Jesus was wounded for our transgressions but by His stripes were healed take divine healing away from Christ you cut the atonement in half but what do you see when you look at him a man Moses saw a burning bush no assault rain he saw judgment right just judgment coming up on the air Ezekiel saw a will in the middle of the wheel Isaiah saw a counselor mighty God and everlasting father but what do you see when you look away from your problems and you put your focus on him then what do you see I tell you what I see I see a savior I see a healer I see a deliverer I said God is worthy of every praise and every honor no one I can sing that song every praises to my god sing hallelujah to my god because I know why I was when he found me and I know where I am when he brought me and he put me up on a rock by his side hallelujah praise be to God what do you see when you see him if you look through a crate they'll tell your days of miracles are past it's not super 10 natural times anymore it's it's just believing on the word but if you look at it through the word you see he's the same yesterday today and forever the disciples had a lot to look at on the ship they had a lot of problems going on winds and waves and it ain't fun being on a little boat out in the middle of a sea been there done that don't care to do it again waves you can't even see over and it's cresting over the boat you feel like at any moment you don't know what's about to happen because we're going down we're going through what's going on and here they are rocking and carrying on and they're looking at these waves and they're getting worse getting worse and all of a sudden once it who is that who is that out there and when they looked away at the from the troubled sea they saw the only help that could help them I trust somebody tonight and look away from the sickness and see the only help that can help you the only one maybe I can look away from your family issues or your problems that's going on and the things that's happened in your life and the situations nobody could fix if they had all the time in the world it'd be impossible for them fix but there is a help that can help you man Caine helping governments can't help you people can't help you but there is a help that can help you you said well I'm depressed I got anxiety I got fear I got dread I got there is a help that can help you it's not a psychologist there's not a doctor it's not somebody here on this earth but there is a help that can help you that can come in a moment in a twinkling of eye and change that whole situation hallelujah I was listening to this tape this morning look away to Jesus and brother Brandon was going through all the different things that happened in his ministry incredible incredible tape going through the different things of God speaking and and the word had he write in the squirrels and I don't in the storm and his wife and all those things that had taken place and he tell us about a mr. shim and on the candy store that was in a bad suit way it got in sick and was in terrible situation and he'd went there as a little boy and bought candy from him and I know many of us probably been to that store I've been there enjoy that plays red hearts are great had some just a few days ago where the Ben Coleman sent me something for my birthday I appreciated that anyway I had you know as he went there's a little boy told some things that I can't comprehend talking about getting a can't ice cream cone for a penny or something like that and having a pocket full of candy just for a couple of cents and things we can't comprehend the day within times that we live in as far as by value value of money and things but this man he went there as a little kid and this man had gotten really sick and he's hit he said he'd heard about brother branham and his prayers and how God answered him and he called for him to come by his side and he was in a terrible shape I can't remember all the problems in possibilities but all of a sudden brother branham looked from what he saw to something else and he said what he said brothers brothers him it's going to be alright he said I'm gonna buy redhots from you again one day he said it completely forgot about it they went home for Christmas or something sometimes going home back to Jeffersonville went to run to grab a few things as gifts and ran into he said I went right went into Simpson he said I walked over there with my hat draw down there was mister Shemp now standing heard he got healed he said but I hadn't seen him yet and he said I've seen him standing behind there I walked with my kind of my hat covered and I said I'd like about a half a pound or a pound okay member of Red Hots he said okay and he fixed him up and he handed him up and he said brother branham looked up and he said well brother Brenner he said I told you I you would sell me Red Hots again I'd like to have about another half pound of Red Hots then we could catch a different vision all the things going around us and all the problems in the situation and the devil pointing out there it's important out that and this failure and this problem and this situation over here I don't like how this hat I don't like catch a different vision and you can get out of that old decrepit position that you're in and you may be down and out and seem like nobody cares but if you'll catch the vision that God cares for you that God cares enough about a man to tell him you're gonna sell me Red Hots again does it care enough about a person to say hey you're not going down and cygnus you're going back up again and you're going to be changed in a moment a twinkle I to go in a rapture Martha had a lot to look at a lot of problems to look at pressure she had pressure anxiety she had anxiety fear no doubt she had fear she had all kinds of thing but when she turned away from death itself and she turned and she looked and she saw Jesus the resurrection and the life whoa hallelujah let me tell you he's a still that same God right now I'm feeling so close right now he is the resurrection and the life turn your eyes from what you're looking at turn your eyes from all the sicknesses around you and your body giving up and all the things that's going on and say God you are the resurrection and life you're still the same yesterday today and forever you're the Lord God that heals all our diseases cancer is nothing but a toothache to you there's no devil no spirit no sickness that cannot and will not bow to the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah pressure she had pressure but when she looked at him she saw the resurrection in the life the hungry the hungry sitting out there no food date but when they looked at him they saw sustaining life they saw a man that could take fish and break it off and there'd be another piece there they saw a man that could take bread break it off and there was another piece of cooked bread there the Creator had work I think about the blind man pressure anxiety fear being blind I think about blind people all the time my heart goes out to him cuz I couldn't imagine living in that world of darkness fear you don't know what the fear you have sometimes just being in the dark not knowing what's around you or waking up in your room and it's dark and you see a shadow and the things jump out you and you're wondering if it's this or robbers didn't come in all kinds of thoughts come in your mind because you imagine as a blind person every day of your life living there pressures anxiety fear get knocked over getting pushed around nobody seemingly cares how long did it go on for this young man day after day year after year hour after hour minute after minute second after second and all sudden somebody

people his have taken my eyes of what I see I'm looking to Jesus who did it before and he'll do it again he saved the loss before he is able again He healed cancer before he'll heal it again

thank God for my joy unspeakable and full of glory I want to thank God he's the same yes every praise every praise is to our God whoa lower the car tonight hey man a song brings back a story to my mind about a little boy who was apprehended by Justin Otho took him and drug him into his car and begin to take him off kidnap him and that little boy something beginning you don't have pressure anxiety and fear Amen begin to grip that boy but his testimony was I just started singing a song every praise is to my god every word of worship belongs to him sing hallelujah I'll shut up sing hallelujah to my god he said when the man will say shut up he'd just get louder amen The Devil's of a men of creeds and dormers is trying to his brother Tim but say shut up but they're putting their foot upon the neck of the bride of Jesus pray we ought to sing louder we ought to praise God louder we oughta glorify God louder if he's truly kidding we're on a praise him as a king he'd be truly

worship I've had enough of their praise I've had enough of their glory I don't know get out goodbye world goodbye world [Applause] pressures pressures there's plenty of pressure but there's a people this pressure nice I don't have the time we can look at brother Brennan was here speaking and I thought it was very interesting this is right at the end of 63 the last message of 63 the next message is Shalom oh mercy and it goes into Shum and he begins to talk about the darkness is to fill in the world and how dark it is now remember this is 64 it's real quick how many years is that being long time 56 is that close 56 huts a long time yeah that's your way Jay - Tina no 56 years and he's talking about how dark it is and he says but 1977 he might uses that day and at some time and he's talked about how dark it is you don't say I'd go past that and we're now here where we're at and it's dark but he read a scripture in that sermon that said arise and shine for that light has come light can only truly show its brightness in darkness it can only truly show how bright it is the darker it gets the greater the darkness the greater the light the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee though darkness shall cover the earth groats darkness to people but the Lord shall rise upon thee did you hear me Church the Lord shall arise upon thee Satan says cancers gonna rise upon you or sugar diabetes for this land the other whatever kind of problem it's gonna know the scripture let me take him back to Scripture the scripture says the Lord shall arise upon thee the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory you not due to be crowned in the glory of cancer of the Gloria I've ever kind of seeing the call you're here to be crowned with the glory of the Lord it shall be seen upon thee is it gross darkness upon the people he said this is prophesied of the day we're now living in and he goes on to say he said and it'll only get darker if he reads that he reads out of Psalm 62 truly my soul waits upon the Lord for him from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long were you imagine mischief against a man you shall be slain of all you he says / slain of all you as a Boeing Walsh a you being as a tottering fence next all the way down they only counsel consult to cast him down from his excellent sleep they delight in lies who does they do they bless with their mouths but they cursed inwardly Selah my soul wait on thou only upon God for my expectation is from him ho holiday he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense and I shall not move and god is my salvation in my glory the rock of my strength in my refuge isn't God trust in him at all times you people pour out your hearts before him God is a refuge for us he says but in Isaiah I'm going back he said I rise and shine for the glory that God has come upon you the light is here the next verse he says gross darkness upon the people and we are in the mist mix of light and darkness he said my address to the church though to the bride to the church is Shalom peace this let that sink down what is what yours what are what are you supposed to be listening to peace we're facing this year both darkness and light now the world wants you to only see darkness but there's also like the world is as one the most chaotic times of darkness that is ever student and yet we're here again in the most blessed light that has ever shine begin the differences just as it were in the beginning when gross darkness upon the earth but the spirit of glory upon the face of the water and said let there be light and the power of darkness could not stop the light hallelujah he said I believe that's what we're living in the hour again when God is separating light from darkness he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest that's why he says I say to the church I say shallow is because it's God's peace I got a piece that the world didn't give and the world therefore can't take it away it's not the peace of the world and their peace pact to world packs in this packet and all the things as they come up with and their laws that's not the peace I'm looking for or I need I have God's peace and God's peace is not affected by the temporary peace or worldly peace there is a difference but what are you looking where are you looking at what are you looking for he said the world's 1 they going cried peace and sudden destruction is going to come he said but now we see breaking over the on a realm is breaking between mortal and immortality we see it break in between heavens and earth from an Earthbound sickness in trouble world into a bright shining day of immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal earth that shall never pass away he said that's why I can say chillon what are you looking at if you're looking at this earth the earth you can only be at peace when the earth is at peace when you have a you know they don't seem to be near as much bad bad news in the world and you got you know this and that and the other and then nothing having a good day it's Wednesday oh my great day Friday great day I can have peace and Saturday you get up in the world falls apart what happens to the peace that's not the peace I'm talking about tell my gods peace they can come into your heart and settle you and say no matter what the world does they didn't give me this peace and therefore if they didn't give it they can't take it I don't care how bad the world gets I don't care if how many people died tomorrow how many people died this that and the other or this government gives up and that government starts fighting that this country starts fighting that country that has nothing to do with this piece this piece is connected to that place hallelujah but he says you you work look at the world is constantly going down down down down listen they turn to what this country regardless if we want to admit it or not turn down the gospel somehow has message believers we got in our mind at this country somehow it's gonna turn around it is not going to turn around is thus saith the Lord and that's why even brother branham said he said I don't even pray for it he said because she rejected the word but we want to pray for certain things because our motives to have a peaceful day or peaceful time peaceful life have a retirement have the that's not what we're here for our 401 K that's not what we're here for our retirement that's really not what we're here for if you make it god bless you but that's not why you're here for one day retirement to run out what then but what are we looking for what are we looking at Shalom when one day and a mortal life will make an immortal body to come and live on an immortal earth that's the piece I'm looking for hallelujah he says he goes on he talked about the world as just getting dark and he gets goes on you can listen to his incredible sermon gross darkness he said I even see up on churches and they're failing to see light shining there seemed to be such a heavy press said some of the noted evangelist is there constantly screaming for revival working right against it seeing not understanding not knowing but the Prophet said gross darkness would be upon the people and he said it was the same darkness it was on the Jews when Jesus came they missed him and he said the same darkness again we're a whole group of people are missing him and calling it fanaticism calling it this or whatever all kind of but he said the hour is upon us darkness gross darkness gross darkness on the people that's what it is what does it all mean where are we standing one hour over here how close are we to coming he says fear not little flock it is your father's good will to give you the kingdom peace Shalom God is beginning to separate the light from the darkness and is pressing behind it like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of a new day the church ages are fading out Amen God is pressing the darkness into a place it has to do it to fade out the organization church organization fade out the world the world is covering this thing over worldly isms taking this place where only things worldly dressing worldly acting worldly living it's the world but we are not of the world we are of heaven this is not our home no holiday is it sure as many good people sincere people that get caught up in the creeds and the dogmas and the denying the power thereof and having a form of good of godliness but denying the power gross darkness it blinded Israel is now blinding the church he said but the bride is making herself ready mmm how many is part of that bride making herself ready for a time it's time for the rapture direct quote it's time for the rapture for darkness is fading upon the Gentiles and dawn will soon break upon the Jews the Sun is traveling from the east to the west and we're at the West now the light can only do one thing go back east again the light can only do that he said but see good people are caught caught in it just like though they were then even Mary and Joseph for good people thought Jesus was with them and come to find out he had left him and he wasn't even with them and he said so is the church world they think Jesus is with them but in this darkness they've lost him he said but there is a people that has not lost him hallelujah groans darkness is upon the people but what about the light what are we to look for when I look at the darkness look at the light rise and shine for the light has come look to the light hallelujah he said that's why I can say to you this morning Shalom God's peace peace peace and Salone good morning god be with you god's peace go with you it's good morning ooh and if it's good morning the scripture said his mercies are new every morning hallelujah it's good morning it's the breaking of the day it's the time of the coming of the Lord it's good morning it's Shalom its peace its hallelujah it's praise the Lord we see darkness settling we see the enemy coming in but we also see the light don't take your eyes off the light that's him among us that's his word being identified Shalom it's the great day of breaking upon us the greatest day ever known to man when that day breaks that bright and cloudless morning when the earth dead in Christ's arise what a day and somehow God Satan is so dark in people's mind to where they're not looking for that day they're looking for destruction they're looking for judgment they're looking for issues and problems looking for this world to burn over that's where they're headed I'm not looking to that I'm looking to good morning I'm looking shalom peace good morning His mercies are new that same amongest darkness is being separated God is causing it hello did you hang up God is allowing this to happen because it's set in the atmosphere for good morning chalo gods causing it the lights doing it the lights pressing itself in such a way until darkness has to congregate together they had a chance to accept it and they wouldn't do it so now it's being condensed together and together disagreeing but Isaiah 60 rise and shine for the light has come to you darkness to them light to you Oh glory to God peace and happiness and joy and love forever what a day this is going to be what are you looking at maybe were you maybe you ought to realize where you're going is where you're looking and where you're looking is where you going quit looking at these things around us look to Jesus the author and the finisher hello he started it but he's also going to finish it he didn't start it just to let it go no he said I'm the author and the finisher arise and shine this barians he says like a man one morning looking at the paper picked it up put his glasses on begin to read his wife was getting out breakfast said anything new he said no same old same old just new people that's right same murder same rate same everything's but somebody else done it but he said to you it's not turn a page its turn to the word see what the word promises for today see what the light of the day is supposed to be what we ought to do this years not go back to Creed's and things of old denominations back to those things of the world old church turn to the word get to the word flip this right
