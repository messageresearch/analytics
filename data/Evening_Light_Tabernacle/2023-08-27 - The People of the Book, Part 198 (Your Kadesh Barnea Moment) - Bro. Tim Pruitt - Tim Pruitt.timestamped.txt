[39:48] amen amen God bless you my goodness
[39:52] let's turn to the scripture this morning
[39:54] let's go to First Corinthians chapter 10
[39:57] and verse 1.
[39:59] amen I know this is going to be a
[40:02] serious thought in one sense but on the
[40:04] other hand it's a rejoicing thought
[40:06] so you you can either you can either
[40:09] take it one way or the other you can
[40:12] either rejoice in it or you can go back
[40:16] to Egypt and go back to bondage amen so
[40:20] you can either look into the things of
[40:21] God and say it's mine or you can turn
[40:24] around and walk back as many others will
[40:27] do amen but this morning I'm going to be
[40:30] speaking on your Kadesh barnia moment
[40:34] and ma'am First Corinthians chapter 10
[40:37] verse 1 moreover Brethren I would not
[40:40] that you should be ignorant how that our
[40:42] fathers were under the cloud and all
[40:45] passed to the Sea
[40:47] and all were baptized into Moses in the
[40:49] cloud and the Sea and all did sit did
[40:53] and all did eat the same spiritual meat
[40:57] and all to drink the same spiritual
[41:00] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[41:03] rock that followed them and that rock
[41:06] was Christ
[41:08] with many of them God was not well
[41:11] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[41:13] wilderness and now these things were an
[41:16] example to the the intent that we should
[41:20] not lust after evil things give me the
[41:23] next verse two and neither be idolaters
[41:26] as some of them as it is written the
[41:29] people sat down to eat and Rose up to
[41:32] play
[41:33] amen God bless you you can be seated
[41:36] interesting this is where the text that
[41:40] I took for the very first sermon I ever
[41:42] preached when I was 15 years old I
[41:45] preached right here from this scripture
[41:48] but this morning we're going to be
[41:50] looking at this because I believe that
[41:52] we are in a very very serious hour very
[41:55] serious time
[41:57] and um we are in a Kadesh barnia moment
[42:02] as far as the bride of Christ as the
[42:05] people of the message
[42:07] now of course
[42:09] um just to preface this a little bit
[42:10] that Israel had journeyed from Egypt to
[42:14] Mount Sinai where they had met God in
[42:16] the pillar of fire upon the mountain and
[42:19] from there they journeyed 11 days to
[42:22] Kadesh and we're on the border of the
[42:25] promised land if I understand right it
[42:28] was only 30 more miles and they would
[42:30] have been right into their Promised Land
[42:32] but they were close enough to send
[42:35] representatives from each tribe to the
[42:38] land to discover if they lived in Walled
[42:42] cities or tent or you know to kind of
[42:44] check out the land just bring a report
[42:46] back
[42:47] and Cadence Barney is a place that as
[42:50] Moses and the children of Israel camp
[42:53] where they sent these to this promised
[42:55] land that spies and and um and it was
[42:59] intended that that would leave from
[43:02] kadash and go into the promised land
[43:05] instead what happened is that they left
[43:08] from Kadesh and went wandering in the
[43:11] wilderness for 40 years
[43:13] and and brothers and sisters the message
[43:16] Community stands here at Kadesh barnia
[43:20] and and I wanted to say that the promise
[43:23] of the word of God since the Seven Seals
[43:26] are open the mysteries of God have been
[43:28] revealed that that the promises are true
[43:32] and that our our God is real as we heard
[43:37] his song a while ago and the Holy Ghost
[43:39] is Our Land
[43:41] and we can however blessing of it
[43:44] amen we can have everything that it
[43:46] possesses we don't just look and
[43:49] emphasize in one thing like a jumper a
[43:53] shout or a dancer neither do we just
[43:55] emphasize just healing or Miracles or
[43:58] signs or wonders but we believe every
[44:01] bit in the book
[44:03] amen we believe every promise of the
[44:06] word of God it belongs to us as
[44:09] Believers this morning amen and I
[44:12] believe that it has been open to us in
[44:14] this day and many are standing on the
[44:17] edge and looking in and and you know
[44:19] it's not just that and I I don't want
[44:22] you just to take it just as that but I
[44:25] want you to also realize many or you are
[44:28] at your own kedish barnya moment
[44:31] sometimes when you're sick and you're
[44:35] um diseased in your body or you got a a
[44:37] horrible situation that's going on in
[44:40] your family you come to a kiddish Barney
[44:45] a moment where you are going to decide
[44:48] whether I'm going to believe the word of
[44:49] God and possess the land possess that
[44:53] promise or whether on the other hand I'm
[44:56] going to turn and go back into the same
[44:58] old wanderings of wilderness and my
[45:00] doubts and my fears and my unbelief
[45:03] so you don't don't just take it as them
[45:06] and day but I want you to ever want to
[45:09] make this real personal to your own life
[45:11] because you will have not just one
[45:14] Cadence Barney a moment but you will
[45:17] have many kids born here moments where
[45:20] you've got to make a decision am I going
[45:22] to believe the word of God and I am I
[45:25] going to take him as what he said or am
[45:28] I going to turn around and walk away
[45:30] from it and say I can't do it
[45:33] I can't possess it
[45:36] now
[45:37] they they had come to Mount Sinai
[45:41] already from Egypt and it journeyed
[45:44] there there they had a wonderful
[45:46] experience of course they had many
[45:48] wonderful experiences even down in Egypt
[45:52] they had wonderful experiences they saw
[45:55] the power of God and the Deliverance of
[45:58] the Lord in the hand of God go forth and
[46:01] and then on the other hand they went and
[46:04] and uh that would go to the Red Sea and
[46:07] they would see the mighty Deliverance
[46:09] there and their enemies dead in the Red
[46:12] Sea and then they would cross them there
[46:15] and water would come out of a rock where
[46:18] that the people would actually murmur
[46:20] because there was no water in the desert
[46:22] and God would actually Smite The Rock
[46:25] instead of smiking the people
[46:27] because the people should have been
[46:29] smitten because of their unbelief in
[46:31] their murmuring but God said take the
[46:34] Rock and smite The Rock instead and out
[46:37] of that came life-giving water so they
[46:40] had a marvelous experiences and and seen
[46:44] the Miracles of God and the word of the
[46:47] Lord come to pass that had already
[46:49] brought Manna down from heaven great
[46:52] things had happened already in for them
[46:55] and it was a tremendous but but I want
[46:59] you to notice now as they come to Mount
[47:01] Sinai and there the voice of God
[47:04] Thunders out on the mountain
[47:08] and there Moses goes up into the cloud
[47:11] and the pillar of fire and and Moses
[47:14] experiences the wonderment of seeing the
[47:17] theophany of God and God taken with his
[47:21] finger and writing upon Stone and giving
[47:24] them his to their command giving them
[47:26] his Commandments and so he does all of
[47:30] this and the thunderings That Shook the
[47:33] mountains and and the the quaking of it
[47:36] all in the and realizing this is an
[47:39] awesome God we serve
[47:41] and yet now they they border they come
[47:44] from there 11-day Journey from Mount
[47:47] Sinai and come to Kadesh and they're
[47:51] right on the border and I want to say to
[47:54] you many of you today are sitting right
[47:56] on the border of your promise right on
[47:59] the border of your deliverance right on
[48:01] the border where that God is about to
[48:04] pour out the blessings of the land and
[48:07] you can have it as a believer
[48:09] God is about to do some greater Mighty
[48:12] wondrous things amen I believe there's a
[48:16] Rapture that is laying ahead I believe
[48:18] there's a change in my body laying ahead
[48:20] amen I believe that God is about to do
[48:23] the phenomena like you've never seen
[48:25] before
[48:27] he is showing his power and he is on
[48:29] showing his display
[48:31] of his omnipotence
[48:35] now as we look at this I just want you
[48:39] to think of this because it would now be
[48:42] 40 years later they would again come to
[48:45] the point
[48:47] where that again's thighs would be sent
[48:50] out
[48:51] and just think as I mentioned my last
[48:54] sermon you know that many many of those
[48:57] young men that were now
[48:59] um 10 years old young children 10 years
[49:01] old would be 50 before they could go in
[49:05] and they man they missed out 40 Years of
[49:08] planting and 40 Years of building and 40
[49:11] years all because of unbelief all
[49:14] because of refusal to enter into the
[49:16] promised land that lay right before them
[49:21] now
[49:22] take this represents that border
[49:26] and where everyone comes to the promised
[49:29] land and looks into the promises of God
[49:32] and discovered what is theirs
[49:36] Moses in our 12. I think it was a little
[49:39] bit political
[49:40] maybe you know as they disgusted of
[49:44] sending out someone maybe so they they
[49:47] get the favorite from each tribe
[49:50] and and making sure every tribe was
[49:53] represented and 10 out of 12 Spies gave
[49:58] an evil report
[50:01] think about that now these were all
[50:03] supposed to be message believers they
[50:06] were also supposed to be you know
[50:09] following the prophet
[50:11] but here out of them as their sin into
[50:14] the line 10 out of the twelve bring an
[50:19] evil report of the Lamb that God gave
[50:24] do you hear me amen but but I want you
[50:27] to notice 40 years later and this is
[50:29] what I was going to bring you know that
[50:31] when Joshua sent out spies to spy out
[50:34] the lamb he only sent two
[50:40] amen he didn't sin 12. he said two
[50:43] because two believed and he said I'm not
[50:46] sinning about to unbelievers
[50:49] I'm not going to send a bunch of
[50:51] borderline believers who won't go all
[50:54] the way but I noticing somebody that
[50:57] will bring me a word of faith Mountain
[50:59] that we can't take the land
[51:06] so he sends out
[51:07] too
[51:09] and the Bible said they bring back a
[51:12] report
[51:13] and it's different from their others the
[51:16] report before these two bring the same
[51:19] report that Joshua had brought
[51:21] and said truly the Lord is delivered in
[51:24] our hands all the land for even all the
[51:28] inhabitants of the country do faint
[51:30] because of us
[51:32] so here they bring they bring a report
[51:35] back and their report is listen we can
[51:38] take this
[51:40] amen that the inhabitants of the country
[51:42] are her faith because of us and the Lord
[51:46] truly has delivered Hallelujah delivered
[51:50] them into our hands
[51:52] I'll tell you what friends I don't care
[51:55] what kind of devil is standing on your
[51:57] promise
[51:58] care how big a devil how big a demon or
[52:01] how big a Giants or how many they are
[52:03] what kind of depression what kind of
[52:06] unbelief what kind of suicide Spirit
[52:08] what kind of schizophrenia no matter
[52:11] what it is I'll tell you there is
[52:13] nothing amen there is nothing that our
[52:16] God can't do there is nothing that can
[52:19] withstand His holy name at the name of
[52:22] Jesus and
[52:24] [Applause]
[52:26] he is Lord
[52:30] Hallelujah
[52:31] he's a ruler overall
[52:34] now you know these two these two had a
[52:38] Joshua and Caleb attitude
[52:41] they saw they could see Jericho's walls
[52:44] coming down
[52:46] amen they they heard how the enemy
[52:49] really viewed them
[52:52] you know the team imagine how the enemy
[52:55] viewed them you see in their imagination
[52:58] in their as they
[53:00] intellectualize the situation
[53:04] are you with me that's a reason the
[53:07] situation they said we are as in their
[53:11] sight
[53:12] as grasshoppers
[53:15] we're just bugs that could squish under
[53:17] their feet
[53:19] these are giants these are Mighty Men
[53:22] these are powerful men and we can't take
[53:26] it
[53:28] but anybody I want you to hear that they
[53:32] came back with a report and their report
[53:35] was totally different from that
[53:37] it was the same at Matt's report of
[53:40] Joshua and Caleb's and said we're more
[53:42] than able to take it
[53:44] and the report was here's how the enemy
[53:46] sees you Joshua 2 and 9 and and Rehab
[53:50] seven to the men I know the Lord has
[53:53] given you the land and your Terror has
[53:56] fallen upon us and that all the
[53:58] inhabitants of the land faint because of
[54:00] you for We Have Heard
[54:05] we have our listened Devils have heard
[54:08] that we got young people living overcome
[54:10] alive
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:24] the darkness of this hour
[54:26] [Applause]
[54:29] oh yeah

[54:34] let me tell you Church you are shaking
[54:36] the gates of hell
[54:38] you are shaking the gates of hell
[54:41] [Music]
[54:43] but we also got Brethren Among Us who
[54:46] are too afraid to take it
[54:49] who want to bring a word to try to throw
[54:53] a stone or quote
[54:56] to try to tell us days of Miracles are
[55:00] passed or this is just nonsense that
[55:03] shadow the king among them there's no
[55:05] King to shout about
[55:07] I'm telling you right now friends I
[55:10] meant I don't want to be identified with
[55:13] them spies I want to be identified with
[55:16] a Joshua and a Caleb I want to have the
[55:19] same Spirit they had and say we are far
[55:22] the label
[55:25] Hallelujah
[55:27] oh when we got demons that are stripping
[55:29] our weapons and girls and women grow
[55:32] women with dresses up above their knees
[55:34] because of a demonic anointing that is
[55:38] trying to destroy them you don't think
[55:41] I'm going to say we're more than able to
[55:43] take that we're more than able to see
[55:46] our Holy Ghost come down upon a life and
[55:49] keep people how to dress right and walk
[55:51] right and talk right come on
[55:53] we're more than able

[56:23] it's all right for our boys to wear
[56:25] shorts I just it's just William Brown's
[56:27] opinion

[56:31] you better come on in
[56:34] you better get another Spirit on you
[56:36] you're a Cadence marnia
[56:39] this is your moment
[56:42] amen if I was you if I had that attitude
[56:45] I'd repent right now
[56:47] I turn from that wickedness
[56:50] amen so you know she she said we have
[56:53] heard how the Lord dried up the Waters
[56:56] of the Red Sea oh yeah when you come out
[57:00] of Egypt and what you did to the key to
[57:02] Kings of amorites that were on the other
[57:05] side of Jordan Zion and all God whom you
[57:09] utterly destroyed
[57:11] and as soon as we heard these things our
[57:14] heart didn't know
[57:16] listen these Devils were already running
[57:19] back
[57:20] they were already afraid come on you
[57:23] know listen listen what would happen in
[57:26] brother Brandon's meeting he would go to
[57:28] expose the cancer
[57:30] somebody help me preach and what would
[57:32] happen another one would reach out and
[57:34] say help me
[57:36] this one was screaming help me to the
[57:38] other help me come reinforce this I
[57:41] believe
[57:43] because he knew the moment that people
[57:45] started believing something was going to
[57:48] happen
[57:50] Hallelujah if I could give you to
[57:53] believe it this morning you can have the
[57:55] Deliverance that you are asking for in
[57:58] your life
[58:05] as soon as we hurt these Saints
[58:07] our heart did melt neither did that
[58:11] remain any more courage in any man
[58:16] because of you because of you devils are
[58:20] trembling
[58:21] because people are starting to believe
[58:24] things are starting to happen
[58:26] amen for the Lord your God oh I love
[58:29] this he he is God in heaven above and
[58:34] the Earth beneath
[58:36] he had went away to heaven and forgot us
[58:38] all but he's right here in the earth
[58:40] he's right there in your life he's right
[58:43] there in your Earth
[58:45] he's right here in the evening like
[58:47] Tabernacle to be your God
[58:51] to show you show himself God on your
[58:53] behalf
[58:55] so now
[58:56] let's just review just a moment
[59:00] let's just review how did this happened
[59:03] let's go to numbers
[59:05] 13 23 and let's just look at them
[59:08] bringing the evidence
[59:10] of the Lamb numbers 13 23. and they hear
[59:15] they go and spy out the land now they
[59:17] spend 40 days
[59:20] and they come to the brook of escrow
[59:23] and cut down them a branch with one
[59:27] cluster of grapes
[59:31] and they too bear it to upon the staff
[59:36] Brother The Grapes were so big
[59:41] listen the fruit of the land was so good
[59:46] amen it was so have you ever seen grapes
[59:49] that big I've seen some great clusters
[59:51] about like that but they're so big
[59:54] two men had to carry it
[59:57] on the side
[59:59] amount and they they bear between if
[1:00:04] between two upon his staff and they
[1:00:07] brought the pomegranates and the figs I
[1:00:10] want you to notice three fruits
[1:00:13] now as you look in numbers 13 27 they
[1:00:19] told them that we have come
[1:00:21] we came unto the line which thou sensed
[1:00:25] and what's now their first confession
[1:00:29] and surely
[1:00:31] it floweth with milk and honey and this
[1:00:35] is the fruit of it
[1:00:39] now this is her first confession well
[1:00:41] I'd say what a land
[1:00:43] amen one cluster of great two men had to
[1:00:45] carry and then the wonderful fruits of
[1:00:48] pomegranates and figs
[1:00:50] three fruits three pulls
[1:00:54] amen we you know one of those polls was
[1:00:58] Divine Healing
[1:01:00] somebody help me preach I'm talking
[1:01:02] about the prophet of God in three phases
[1:01:04] of his ministry
[1:01:05] that's why the poll is as a face amen
[1:01:08] the first phase was Divine Healing
[1:01:12] and so you know here again in this first
[1:01:15] fruits of our promises there were huge
[1:01:18] prayer lines that sometimes would go for
[1:01:21] city blocks
[1:01:23] I remember where every Miracle
[1:01:25] conceivable was done
[1:01:28] there was nothing impossible
[1:01:31] blind eyes without eyeballs formed in
[1:01:35] the head
[1:01:36] let me remind you of jacco's testimony
[1:01:39] who went there as an Assembly of God
[1:01:41] preacher but he was an unbeliever in
[1:01:43] Divine Healing
[1:01:45] and he thought all of this was just hype
[1:01:48] and hysteria so he went out to see being
[1:01:50] that he was in San Antonio Texas in 1945
[1:01:53] and watching brother Branham and this is
[1:01:56] his testimony and why I give the date
[1:01:57] because that's the date he gave and he
[1:01:59] said when I heard the man William
[1:02:01] Branham was Discerning people's hearts
[1:02:03] and praying for the sick
[1:02:05] and he said sometimes we we think we're
[1:02:08] the only one doing something for God so
[1:02:11] he belonged to the prestigings and
[1:02:13] denominations and thought if you're not
[1:02:15] in our group you ain't doing nothing
[1:02:17] and then in that show isn't that what
[1:02:20] happens around the message if you're not
[1:02:21] in our group it ain't happening
[1:02:24] or if it's happening there well we gotta
[1:02:26] make light of it or be jealous of it or
[1:02:29] enviously I say don't be envious of what
[1:02:32] God's doing amen be desirous of it
[1:02:37] to your church
[1:02:39] evolutionize your
[1:02:40] [Applause]
[1:02:44] let it do for you what it's done for us
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:48] and he said when I heard about
[1:02:50] Discerning he said I thought it was for
[1:02:52] fortune telling
[1:02:54] so I went to find out for myself
[1:02:57] and he said I tried to get in the
[1:02:59] healing line but failed and and he was
[1:03:01] Discerning people and declaring them
[1:03:03] healed and one man came up had no
[1:03:06] eyeballs
[1:03:08] and he said he told him said now in
[1:03:11] three days it will be eyeballs form in
[1:03:14] your eyes
[1:03:15] well he said anybody could say that you
[1:03:19] know that man go get lost in the crowd
[1:03:20] and you could you forget about seeing
[1:03:22] him again nobody know whether that's
[1:03:24] true or not
[1:03:25] and he said um so as brother Brandon was
[1:03:28] praying he's praying for the people they
[1:03:30] let him out the door right where he was
[1:03:32] and brother Branham laid his hands over
[1:03:34] on his on his only messy
[1:03:38] um pass by and just stop in there for a
[1:03:41] moment and said you're not sick
[1:03:44] but your body is tired and he softly
[1:03:47] said to me you're doubting whether this
[1:03:49] is of God or not I want to tell you this
[1:03:51] is of God and we're both fighting the
[1:03:54] same devil
[1:03:57] amen come on I'm going to say to you
[1:04:00] listen I believe in everything the
[1:04:02] prophet of God said I believe in the
[1:04:05] things where he was correct in emotion
[1:04:07] and I believe the things that he was
[1:04:09] purporting emotion I believe every bit
[1:04:11] of it
[1:04:12] amen I believe in the mechanics I
[1:04:15] believe in every bit of the word and I
[1:04:17] believe in the Dynamics
[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:21] and I just want to say Brother Where in
[1:04:23] the world you want to throw stones at us
[1:04:25] when we when we're fighting the same
[1:04:28] devil get on our team we've got to dying
[1:04:32] to defeat we gotta land
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:41] so we're fighting the same devil go and
[1:04:44] continue in your Revival for you're also
[1:04:47] called to preach he said well man I are
[1:04:49] called to pray for the sick he said I
[1:04:51] left the mean I felt like I was walking
[1:04:52] on clouds but he's still a little bit
[1:04:54] skeptical
[1:04:55] so he said three after three days I
[1:04:57] thought I'd go find out
[1:04:59] about that man without eyeballs
[1:05:01] and when I saw him he still was still
[1:05:04] blind but eyeballs had formed
[1:05:06] and it was Now noon and that night after
[1:05:08] he fell asleep he woke around 7 PM must
[1:05:12] have been about the start of the meeting
[1:05:13] and he started running around to
[1:05:15] shouting praises to the Lord because he
[1:05:18] was now seeing that he said from then on
[1:05:21] I knew Reverend Brown was no ordinary
[1:05:23] preacher but was called for
[1:05:25] dispensational purposes
[1:05:27] now that was a testimony of a once
[1:05:30] critic and then become a fellow
[1:05:32] evangelist in the same field of Divine
[1:05:34] Healing and I just want to say brother
[1:05:36] we're fighting the same devil
[1:05:38] hey man Dave you know I'm not ashamed of
[1:05:41] any quote of the prophet of God I
[1:05:43] believe every one of them don't throw
[1:05:44] them at me they're for the enemy
[1:05:47] [Applause]
[1:05:49] don't go and stone me with stones
[1:05:52] try to take your little Revelation and
[1:05:54] stone it with me now let's use that
[1:05:56] against the devil
[1:05:57] [Applause]
[1:05:59] listen listen in I'm talking about
[1:06:01] clusters of grapes right now is somebody
[1:06:04] with me
[1:06:05] amen this is huge and what God showed us
[1:06:08] in this age because we are the Cadence
[1:06:11] by Nia too he brought evidence of the
[1:06:14] land
[1:06:16] are you with me I mean cluster of grapes
[1:06:20] so big
[1:06:21] that wooden couldn't pack it by himself
[1:06:24] my horribly Twisted bodies was
[1:06:27] straightened like the boy in South
[1:06:29] Africa who came in the prayer line with
[1:06:31] the dog like a lab like a dog with a
[1:06:33] chain about his neck
[1:06:36] he was mentally handicapped for one
[1:06:38] thing you don't think God heals mental
[1:06:39] handicap
[1:06:41] he showed over and over he does
[1:06:44] he still does he was mentally
[1:06:46] handicapped and some sort of disease it
[1:06:49] twisted his back and he walked like an
[1:06:51] animal on his hands and his feet it was
[1:06:53] a wretched conditioner you know a boy
[1:06:55] like this in in Africa like that where
[1:06:58] they were they're impoverished they
[1:07:00] would use them for begging
[1:07:02] and they were they would um bring them
[1:07:04] out and this hideous deformed condition
[1:07:07] and they brought this boy on the stage
[1:07:10] and he he started he started doing this
[1:07:13] little war dance because you know he he
[1:07:16] was before a crowd and and he you know
[1:07:18] he'd been trained to to do that
[1:07:21] and and you know so he was trying to do
[1:07:24] a war dance because that's what he would
[1:07:26] do when when begging would would get out
[1:07:30] you know and and on his hands and feet
[1:07:32] like an animal do a little war dancing
[1:07:34] people out of pity would give money
[1:07:39] and brother Branham stood there and
[1:07:41] trying to catch his spirit and trying to
[1:07:43] get him to settle down for a minute and
[1:07:45] break into a vision he said he's born in
[1:07:47] this condition
[1:07:48] and his parents outside an audience
[1:07:51] confirmed this was to be true and and
[1:07:53] then the vision began to show something
[1:07:55] he was thinking about
[1:07:57] this just really breaks my heart
[1:08:00] he was thinking about a younger brother
[1:08:04] who had been hurt
[1:08:06] riding a goat and it had crippled him
[1:08:09] and he's there now and he's thinking
[1:08:11] about if my brother could be healed
[1:08:15] and the vision picks that up and and
[1:08:17] tells of his desire and said what he's
[1:08:20] thinking about is his brother he's got a
[1:08:23] younger brother and he's in the meeting
[1:08:24] and he's crippled from riding on a goat
[1:08:27] and he fell off and he got hurt
[1:08:30] and I said I see him now said he's
[1:08:33] healed now he's looking at the vision
[1:08:35] and from the audience from the crowd
[1:08:37] came a boy running there with crutches
[1:08:40] over his head and screaming at the top
[1:08:43] of his voice
[1:08:45] totally healed
[1:08:48] amen and that little boy's seeing that
[1:08:50] you know his faith began to rise no
[1:08:52] doubt and and the Beast and goes on and
[1:08:55] he said I saw the boy like a blue shadow
[1:08:57] standing straight normal in his right
[1:08:59] mind
[1:09:01] and I said stand up Jesus Christ has
[1:09:03] made you whole he didn't know what I was
[1:09:05] talking about and then The Interpreter
[1:09:07] said and he didn't get it so brother
[1:09:09] Brandon walked over and grabbed his
[1:09:10] chain and took a hold of it around and
[1:09:13] said Jesus Christ makes you whole and
[1:09:15] pulled on his chains and his looks
[1:09:17] changed
[1:09:18] until you're starting dropping off his
[1:09:20] cheeks on his back belly and he's
[1:09:23] standing there looking around in his
[1:09:25] right mind every bone had snapped and
[1:09:28] went into place and here this crippled
[1:09:30] child deformed from birth
[1:09:33] comes home
[1:09:35] talking about The Grapes of this laugh
[1:09:38] I'm talking about the power of the Holy
[1:09:41] Ghost that can take a crippled boy I
[1:09:45] meant the foreign child and shield him
[1:09:48] in such a way as insane and make him
[1:09:50] normal
[1:09:53] that's what lays in this land
[1:09:55] oh it's a good land I say it's a good
[1:09:59] land amen here's the fruits of it God's
[1:10:02] so damn in this day the fruits of it
[1:10:08] Minds that were gone restored as
[1:10:11] horrible demons were cast out
[1:10:13] like the woman in Arkansas who brother
[1:10:16] Brandon was called to come down and pray
[1:10:19] while the prayer line was being formed
[1:10:22] and some of the bad cases was down in
[1:10:24] the basement and he walks down there and
[1:10:26] sees a woman there
[1:10:28] she's from a mental institution
[1:10:30] and her feet and her legs are up in the
[1:10:33] air and she's crawling around on her
[1:10:35] back both of their feet and legs stick
[1:10:37] up she's in a pair of shorts because you
[1:10:40] know that's about what they could dress
[1:10:41] her in there in the in the institution
[1:10:44] they had brought her brought her to the
[1:10:46] meeting
[1:10:47] and brother Brandon went down to pray
[1:10:49] for our new brothers the guy said no
[1:10:50] don't do that said her husband said
[1:10:52] listen she kicked out all the windows of
[1:10:55] the ambulance
[1:10:59] I'll tell you she'll kill you and he
[1:11:02] said no oh no he said I don't think so
[1:11:04] and he walked down there to take her by
[1:11:06] the hand and see if it was a germ
[1:11:07] disease and and when he took her by
[1:11:09] their hands she jumped so hard he said
[1:11:11] if I hadn't been able to lift my foot up
[1:11:13] and put it on her breasts and took away
[1:11:15] from it she'd have jerked me right down
[1:11:17] on her
[1:11:19] he said I ran back to get away from her
[1:11:21] and climbed up on the platform
[1:11:23] the little platform they're standing
[1:11:25] with her husband and she went crawling
[1:11:27] around on her back like and said she
[1:11:30] went over to a bench and she took and
[1:11:32] hit the bench with the back of her head
[1:11:35] and when she did she hit it so hard a
[1:11:38] big Splinter came out of it she picked
[1:11:40] that up and flung it at her husband and
[1:11:42] barely missed him and it hit the plaster
[1:11:44] on the wall and It Came Crashing Down
[1:11:46] broke the plaster on the wall it hit so
[1:11:49] hard
[1:11:50] and she said William Branham I have
[1:11:53] nothing you have nothing to do with me
[1:11:57] and he said well the husband said why
[1:11:59] she don't even know her name how did she
[1:12:01] know who you were she hadn't spoken
[1:12:03] three years
[1:12:06] how did she know that said that wasn't
[1:12:08] her that was a demon speaking through
[1:12:10] her
[1:12:11] amen oh let me let me just tell you let
[1:12:15] me just tell you these are not just
[1:12:16] Grapes of yesterday
[1:12:19] we are in this land and I can testify to
[1:12:23] you those grapes are still just as sweet
[1:12:26] Hallelujah I've seen demons cast out by
[1:12:30] the power of my Christ I know the power
[1:12:33] [Applause]
[1:12:34] what it can do and turn someone into the
[1:12:37] right mind
[1:12:38] yes sir I can stand here and we can give
[1:12:41] testimony after testimony of what we
[1:12:44] have seen God do
[1:12:47] because our God's real and these grapes
[1:12:50] are not fake
[1:12:52] they're not on a picture
[1:12:55] are you with me they're not just
[1:12:58] something that is plastic in an ornament
[1:13:01] they're not history
[1:13:12] thank you
[1:13:13] brother Branham said that was that devil
[1:13:17] talking through her using her voice
[1:13:21] and he said brother
[1:13:24] he said almighty God met me an angel of
[1:13:27] the Lord met me
[1:13:28] and gave me a gift to Divine heal and
[1:13:31] you believe that he said I do with all
[1:13:32] my heart he said well if I could get
[1:13:33] people to believe nothing would stand
[1:13:35] before me
[1:13:38] so well what must I do brother Brandon
[1:13:40] he said take her back to the insane
[1:13:41] institution and he said you know she and
[1:13:46] and she's going to come out of that in
[1:13:47] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:50] three days later you know she she never
[1:13:52] moved another time they took her
[1:13:54] peaceably back in another ambulance they
[1:13:56] put her back in the insane Ward about
[1:13:58] three days later she came to herself and
[1:14:00] a few months later was in the meetings
[1:14:02] where their little children her husband
[1:14:04] a restored mom
[1:14:08] oh this God is a restored

[1:14:18] rescuer of children come on this God
[1:14:20] cares about your situation
[1:14:24] he's interested in you no matter how
[1:14:26] small or how great this God is
[1:14:28] interested in you
[1:14:30] oh yeah I put all of these in my notes
[1:14:34] yesterday
[1:14:36] as I was praying for this service this
[1:14:38] morning
[1:14:39] and then there's been study known and
[1:14:41] well you know I told you I was going to
[1:14:43] preach on this two weeks ago
[1:14:46] but you know
[1:14:47] cancers are the worst kind
[1:14:50] s of the worst kind we're healed brother
[1:14:54] Branham talks about Florence Nightingale
[1:14:56] I'm just talking about The Grapes of
[1:14:58] this land
[1:14:59] that's what I'm talking about I mean you
[1:15:02] know that they're huge they're they're
[1:15:03] clusters and and they're so big
[1:15:07] you know God was showing us the
[1:15:09] abundance
[1:15:10] the greatness of his power
[1:15:13] so that you can believe in anything for
[1:15:17] anything
[1:15:20] well
[1:15:21] you know
[1:15:23] Florence Nightingale had got down to 60
[1:15:26] something pounds Skin and Bones and and
[1:15:29] was in a dying condition with
[1:15:30] tuberculosis and they flew her there to
[1:15:33] England and she just said
[1:15:35] from South Africa and just sit you know
[1:15:37] let's pray that I can die I can't die
[1:15:41] and brother Brandon said I couldn't pray
[1:15:43] that way
[1:15:44] she'd come all that way I couldn't pray
[1:15:46] that she would die
[1:15:47] so he he said we got down and started
[1:15:49] praying and a dove flew in the window
[1:15:51] and began to cool
[1:15:54] and he said I stood up and looked at
[1:15:56] that and I said I started to say did you
[1:15:58] see that and he just came out of my
[1:16:00] mouth
[1:16:01] you're you're healed
[1:16:03] you're going to be well
[1:16:06] and and you know and here this woman
[1:16:09] would come back and and and show him a
[1:16:12] picture months and months later there of
[1:16:14] Hertz 160 something pounds you know in
[1:16:17] full bloom health
[1:16:19] amen every kind of thing
[1:16:22] you see all great clusters may not be so
[1:16:27] big
[1:16:28] but this shows us what the land is able
[1:16:31] to produce
[1:16:33] Amen in this cluster in his clusters is
[1:16:36] a gift of faith
[1:16:38] in its clusters is the gift of healing
[1:16:42] Gifts of healing workings of Miracles
[1:16:45] these grapes wouldn't squeeze out
[1:16:48] would make the wine of stimulation as
[1:16:50] the word ripened and was revealed and
[1:16:53] would stimulate the believer to believe
[1:16:55] forever promise of God
[1:16:58] oh yeah but it's not just grapes
[1:17:01] they're pomegranates
[1:17:05] made of hundreds of tiny little fruits
[1:17:08] in one pomegranate
[1:17:10] perfectly detailed to every individual
[1:17:12] need
[1:17:14] somebody with me
[1:17:16] amen it could go back 40 years in your
[1:17:18] life
[1:17:19] amen I can tell your name and your
[1:17:21] address and repeat repeat the doctor's
[1:17:24] conversation or anything about your
[1:17:26] personal life well what did it do it it
[1:17:29] showed us that our God is a personal God
[1:17:33] he knows where you live he knows what
[1:17:36] your address is he knows the burden of
[1:17:40] your heart and our God cares about you
[1:17:42] he is concerned about every detail of
[1:17:45] your life
[1:17:47] amen oh my it showed us how God is
[1:17:50] personal God and like a pomegranate it's
[1:17:53] just crammed with every bit of goodness
[1:17:57] maybe all discernment is not on the same
[1:18:00] scale
[1:18:01] but it shows us that God knows every
[1:18:04] detail of our life and can give it can
[1:18:06] give insight into our troubles at any
[1:18:09] time
[1:18:11] discernment never delivered anyone it
[1:18:15] just raised their fate to a level that
[1:18:17] they could believe and thus receive
[1:18:18] God's promise
[1:18:20] every person can I say it every person
[1:18:24] is to have discernment of spirits in
[1:18:27] order to know what is right from wrong
[1:18:29] we can discern both good and evil and we
[1:18:34] can be confident that God knows and is
[1:18:37] concerned about every facet of life
[1:18:41] discernment comes in all sizes and
[1:18:44] shapes
[1:18:45] discernments of spirits and word of
[1:18:47] wisdom and the word of knowledge it all
[1:18:50] Lays there
[1:18:57] and there is prophecy
[1:18:59] there's so many wonderful lays things
[1:19:01] that lays there you see it is a good
[1:19:03] land
[1:19:05] for Deuteronomy 8 and 7 describes it for
[1:19:08] the Lord thy God bringeth thee unto a
[1:19:10] good land a land the Brooks of water of
[1:19:13] Fountains of depths that spring up out
[1:19:16] of valleys and Hills a lamb of weed and
[1:19:18] barley and Vines and fig trees and
[1:19:20] pomegranates a land of olive oil and
[1:19:23] honey oh you see they're not just three
[1:19:25] things
[1:19:27] it's full of all kinds of goodness a
[1:19:30] lamb when you or you will eat bread
[1:19:32] without scarceness thou shall not lack
[1:19:35] anything in a land whose stones are iron
[1:19:39] and out of Hills our made us dig brass
[1:19:43] out of there will come the tools that
[1:19:45] you will need to use in that line
[1:19:48] is there but you know what it takes
[1:19:51] Faith to see it
[1:19:53] unbelief will never see the goodness of
[1:19:56] the land
[1:19:57] unbelief will point to the negative
[1:19:59] of them kids shouted but they didn't get
[1:20:02] nothing
[1:20:03] well I tell you someone did shout and
[1:20:06] they did get something
[1:20:07] in fact the reason they shouted was
[1:20:09] because they got something
[1:20:11] [Applause]
[1:20:13] oh yeah there are a few people that are
[1:20:15] shout to get it and you'll never shout
[1:20:16] enough to get it it comes to repentance
[1:20:20] turning from your sins and being sincere
[1:20:22] before God that's the way it comes the
[1:20:26] shout won't bring it down you can shout
[1:20:27] and scream all you want to it won't do
[1:20:30] one bit of good but I tell you what you
[1:20:33] cannot get in touch with deity and not
[1:20:35] have some kind of emotion happen
[1:20:38] [Applause]
[1:20:39] amen
[1:20:43] but it takes Faith to see it
[1:20:46] unbelievable point to the negative
[1:20:48] today's Miracles being passed
[1:20:51] to the promise of God being for
[1:20:54] yesterday
[1:20:55] faith says though is now unbelief says
[1:20:59] it's too late those days are passed
[1:21:02] or it's just not for me
[1:21:06] well then that means the Wilderness and
[1:21:09] death is for you
[1:21:13] now
[1:21:14] so
[1:21:16] brother Branham says about faith
[1:21:18] he said there's a little Door of Faith
[1:21:20] he's preaching doors in the door and he
[1:21:22] said there's a little door there's faith
[1:21:24] and said oh I'll give it a try Faith
[1:21:27] doesn't try
[1:21:30] oh blessed be his name Faith knows where
[1:21:33] he's standing Faith got big muscles and
[1:21:36] a hairy chest what
[1:21:38] and when he raises up with his big
[1:21:41] muscles everything contrary sits down he
[1:21:44] lets out a scream and it sounds like a
[1:21:47] panther screaming and every Jack Rabbit
[1:21:50] takes to his den faith is the boss
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:54] Hallelujah faith is the boss and all
[1:21:58] things are possible to them that believe
[1:22:00] all things
[1:22:02] well you said well I might ask God too
[1:22:04] much brother Branham you can't ask him
[1:22:06] enough
[1:22:07] he loves to do that for you and then he
[1:22:10] brings out the little fish about a half
[1:22:13] inch long in the middle of the Atlantic
[1:22:15] saying I better drink sparingly because
[1:22:17] you know I I might drink all this water
[1:22:19] up and then this ocean will go dry
[1:22:22] because I'll run out one day what
[1:22:24] nonsense and he said it would be more
[1:22:26] nonsense to think that you can exhaust
[1:22:28] the father's Good Will to do things for
[1:22:31] you
[1:22:32] Hallelujah you've come through the
[1:22:34] inexhaustible Fountain you come to the
[1:22:37] place of untapped resources you come to
[1:22:40] the place where the blessings of God
[1:22:42] never stop Hallelujah with a form of
[1:22:45] rain and the latter rain are poured out
[1:22:47] together and bring forth the highness of
[1:22:50] wheat
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:22:53] and oil
[1:22:55] and wine
[1:22:57] oh yeah
[1:22:59] could you imagine a little mouse about
[1:23:01] so long under the great Gardeners of
[1:23:03] Egypt saying now just a minute now
[1:23:06] there's there's billions 450 billions of
[1:23:09] tons of this Garner of grain in here but
[1:23:13] I better just allowance one one kind of
[1:23:15] day because I might run out before
[1:23:17] springtime
[1:23:18] and he said that's the way some
[1:23:20] Christians think God is trying to allow
[1:23:22] allowance herself just join in the
[1:23:25] church
[1:23:26] let me tell you this message is more
[1:23:28] about than just sitting on another pew
[1:23:31] let's just change it from the Catholic
[1:23:33] or the Methodist or the Baptist or
[1:23:34] whatever and come in here and sitting on
[1:23:36] the Pew it ain't about trading cues

[1:23:42] and saying this is the best I can do you
[1:23:44] see if and and of course if that if you
[1:23:48] do the best you can do I'll tell you
[1:23:49] what you'll believe every promise God
[1:23:51] made
[1:23:52] if you'll do the best you can do amen
[1:23:55] you can never ask him too much he loves
[1:23:58] to give it ask abundantly that your Joys
[1:24:00] may be full just ask for great things
[1:24:03] and believe for great things
[1:24:05] but he said the reason you can't do it
[1:24:08] now here's them at their kadash
[1:24:11] the reason you can't do it you say now
[1:24:13] Jesus you saved me don't you let me go
[1:24:16] to hell
[1:24:17] but don't fool around maybe Dr P H
[1:24:19] Calhoun is right
[1:24:21] it might be that the days of Miracles
[1:24:23] are passed it might be
[1:24:26] it is for you
[1:24:28] you just make that up it is
[1:24:31] if you believe that it is
[1:24:34] and I want you to say days of Miracles
[1:24:36] has passed for some
[1:24:38] healing is over for some
[1:24:41] shouting is over for some
[1:24:43] amen Holy Ghost dancing is over for some
[1:24:47] but it ain't for you
[1:24:50] Hallelujah not sir you were at this key
[1:24:53] this morning moment and there's Jocelyn
[1:24:56] calebs that are here that's it we can
[1:24:58] take the land we can't enjoy all the
[1:25:02] blessings of God
[1:25:05] Hallelujah
[1:25:08] Ma
[1:25:11] he said a man came to me some time ago
[1:25:13] said Miss some random I don't care what
[1:25:15] you do or say I don't believe in
[1:25:16] miracles
[1:25:18] I said it wasn't for you unbelievers it
[1:25:21] was for those that believed that's the
[1:25:23] only question Jesus said he that
[1:25:25] believeth all things are possible it's
[1:25:27] for those who will believe and place
[1:25:28] their unadulterated faith in the
[1:25:30] finished works of Christ God's there and
[1:25:32] obligated to do it
[1:25:37] and then there were figs
[1:25:40] there were pomegranates and there were
[1:25:42] grapes
[1:25:43] and there were figs
[1:25:46] in Second Kings 20 and verse 5 it tells
[1:25:49] about Hezekiah
[1:25:51] a man who had got a word from God you're
[1:25:54] gonna die
[1:25:56] set your house in order but Prayer
[1:25:59] Changes Things
[1:26:02] and he set his face against the wall and
[1:26:04] began to pray and said God you know I've
[1:26:06] served you with a perfect heart
[1:26:08] give me some more years
[1:26:10] and he turned there and that prayer sent
[1:26:13] the prophet of God back to him that says
[1:26:16] I have heard thy prayers I have seen thy
[1:26:19] tears behold I will kill thee
[1:26:22] and I want to tell you he's saying that
[1:26:24] to somebody today I have heard that
[1:26:26] prayer and I've seen your tears but I
[1:26:30] will heal thee you know why because he's
[1:26:33] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:26:36] if I can get you to look in This Promise
[1:26:38] of the word in your case martinia moment

[1:26:50] it can be for you too
[1:26:53] and I want you to know this he said I'll

[1:26:58] deliver thee and this city out the hand
[1:27:00] of the king of Assyria and I will defend
[1:27:02] this city for my own sake and for my
[1:27:04] David's servant's sake and Isaiah said
[1:27:07] take a lump of figs
[1:27:10] and they took it and laid on the boil it
[1:27:12] must have been a cancer

[1:27:39] of figs
[1:27:41] take the word of God take this
[1:27:43] third-pull message and they took it and
[1:27:46] laid it on the boil and he recovered
[1:27:49] I tell you I challenge you to take any
[1:27:52] promise of the word of God and lay it on
[1:27:54] your problem and once a thing disappear
[1:28:00] foreign

[1:28:05] Mysteries that God revealed seven
[1:28:07] Thunders utter their voices opening up

[1:29:53] more than just theology it's more than
[1:29:56] just a new revelation it is a revelation
[1:30:00] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:30:03] today
[1:30:07] I believe in the whole land

[1:30:13] Jericho and and seeing that sealed walls
[1:30:15] come down and the seals are open and we
[1:30:17] stand there at Jericho
[1:30:19] and then you build you build a wall
[1:30:21] around Jericho up again and you encamp

[1:30:48] power of the spoken word there's the
[1:30:51] power of binding and loosened

[1:36:40] Is My Land
[1:36:43] foreign
[1:36:50] there's a power the spoken word
[1:36:54] there is the opening the word the
[1:36:56] revealing of the Mysteries it all came
[1:36:59] from a prophet
[1:37:01] nobody can take his place
[1:37:04] none of us are trying
[1:37:06] don't get don't envious like they like
[1:37:09] like Joshua 1 to Moses because 70 begin
[1:37:12] to prophesy in the congregation because
[1:37:14] he'd been Anointed with the same Spirit
[1:37:15] of Moses and Joshua says went screaming
[1:37:19] stop him stop him he said to you envy
[1:37:22] for my sake I would have got all of his
[1:37:25] people were Prophets
[1:37:27] amen
[1:37:29] so you see
[1:37:31] that that in here though about victories
[1:37:35] there is a warning that goes with fig
[1:37:39] trees
[1:37:40] the Fig Tree must produce fruits
[1:37:46] a gospel without power is to be cursed
[1:37:50] and a religion without emotion is dead
[1:37:56] now if you want religion without motion
[1:37:58] stay in the wilderness
[1:38:00] amen if you want to gospel without
[1:38:02] powers stay out there in the wilderness
[1:38:06] but in this land
[1:38:08] there's every promise of God
[1:38:10] John 15 2 ever branches in me that
[1:38:13] beareth not fruit he taketh away this is
[1:38:16] what he says every branch that Beth
[1:38:18] fruit he purges it that it may bring
[1:38:20] forth more fruit well I'll tell you I'm
[1:38:22] either in the position of being banished
[1:38:24] or purged and I just say God Purge me
[1:38:29] but whatever he's looking for fruit if
[1:38:31] he doesn't find fruit he's gonna he's
[1:38:33] gonna take that away do you know what it
[1:38:35] means to be taken away to be cut off
[1:38:37] you're bound to bound together in bones
[1:38:40] for the burning
[1:38:41] for the tribulation
[1:38:43] for the fiery Trials of the tribulation
[1:38:46] now Jesus found a victory in his day in
[1:38:49] it isn't it a wonderment how that Jesus
[1:38:53] did this and remember these things were
[1:38:56] for examples the Bible said
[1:38:59] and Jesus found a victory and he
[1:39:02] expected it to be bringing forth fruit
[1:39:05] out of season
[1:39:08] now you know people think you need a
[1:39:11] certain season
[1:39:14] well this is not the day of Pentecost
[1:39:17] brother Tim well maybe not
[1:39:20] we certainly don't have to carry in the
[1:39:22] city of Jerusalem but I tell you we must
[1:39:25] be imdued with powerful and high
[1:39:29] oh it's not the repeated return right we
[1:39:32] don't have to go and do what they did we
[1:39:34] are not waiting for the Holy Ghost to
[1:39:36] came they they come because Christ had
[1:39:38] ascended and he said as long as I'm with
[1:39:41] you the Holy Ghost cannot come but when
[1:39:43] I sinned I'm going to send back the
[1:39:45] promise of My Father which will be the
[1:39:47] Holy Ghost
[1:39:48] and he said you wait in the city of
[1:39:50] Jerusalem until I do a few things there
[1:39:53] in glory and I'm going to send it back
[1:39:55] so they waited
[1:40:00] hmm
[1:40:02] you know
[1:40:04] again we think it needs a certain season
[1:40:08] well you know this is just out of season
[1:40:11] for fruit this is that you know it was
[1:40:14] the season for miracles and signs and
[1:40:17] wonders in the 40s and the Vintage but
[1:40:19] that's not our season
[1:40:24] I saw some of you who had the sharp look
[1:40:26] on your face but I've had preachers say
[1:40:28] that
[1:40:31] we are not in that season
[1:40:35] I don't really care
[1:40:38] Jesus looks at the big tree and is not
[1:40:40] seasoned and he expects fruit
[1:40:46] and he says he said if you don't bear
[1:40:49] fruit you're going to be cursed
[1:40:52] I I don't care about your seasons
[1:40:56] amen I want you to know if you want to
[1:40:59] go to Seasons I'm going to say it's your
[1:41:01] season to be blessed
[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:05] it's your season for a rapture
[1:41:08] hallelujah what do you think will
[1:41:10] Rapture even means it means ecstasy
[1:41:13] uncontrollable estracy shout in
[1:41:16] rapturing
[1:41:18] you're claiming to be an erupture and
[1:41:20] you don't have any shout in your church
[1:41:23] amen you say well we got Rapture and
[1:41:26] Faith by the team will show it
[1:41:28] amen it's like if you're happy let your
[1:41:30] faith notify your face amen if you're
[1:41:33] really in the mood of God bless there be
[1:41:35] signs and wonders let there be healing
[1:41:38] and miracles let the power of God move
[1:41:40] into salvation
[1:41:43] Hallelujah
[1:41:50] what do you think we're standing
[1:41:53] many people are standing right there
[1:41:55] Kadesh
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:57] and they're looking over and said we
[1:41:59] can't take it
[1:42:01] we can't take it because of you young
[1:42:03] people get a little bit too excited
[1:42:06] so we don't want that
[1:42:08] well I do
[1:42:10] I'd rather them be excited about Jesus
[1:42:15] then be dancing and shouting in a ball
[1:42:17] game
[1:42:18] come on I'd rather them dance and Shout
[1:42:21] in church than to be out in a honky tonk
[1:42:25] amen I'm happy to see our young people
[1:42:28] enthused about God Amen I always say
[1:42:31] every one of you from the front to the
[1:42:33] back would get enthused about Jesus
[1:42:35] Christ
[1:42:37] he ought to be the joy of your life he
[1:42:40] ought to be the sensible theme of
[1:42:42] everything we do as safe he ought to be
[1:42:45] the praise of our hearts
[1:42:52] that you understand that the borderline
[1:42:54] and criticize and say we can't take it
[1:42:57] I'm going to say we are more than able
[1:43:00] to take it Hallelujah it is Our Land
[1:43:11] well brother Tim I know you you're just
[1:43:14] a Pentecostal let me just tell you
[1:43:15] something
[1:43:18] first of all I'm not I'm not I never was
[1:43:21] birthed to under Azusa Street
[1:43:26] I never was
[1:43:28] I got I got filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:30] in this message
[1:43:33] by the way I spoke in tongues in this
[1:43:35] message
[1:43:36] that's not the evidence but I still did
[1:43:39] it
[1:43:40] it is one evidence
[1:43:42] the Holy Ghost does speak with tongues
[1:43:44] it's like hair on your head everything
[1:43:46] that has Harry in a human
[1:43:49] everything speaks in tongues ain't
[1:43:51] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:52] [Applause]
[1:43:54] but I I figure if you are human you're
[1:43:56] gonna have hair unless you've got some
[1:43:59] kind of malady and God can heal that too
[1:44:03] because we've seen it happen alopecia
[1:44:06] accursive autoimmune immune disease on a
[1:44:10] young girl in our church and God
[1:44:11] restored her glory
[1:44:13] the thing was cursed in the name of
[1:44:15] Jesus Christ and hair began to grow
[1:44:18] Hallelujah
[1:44:22] you say well brother Tim I think you're
[1:44:24] Pentecostal where you got this from Penn
[1:44:26] now listen I learned how to preach from
[1:44:29] listening to the prophet
[1:44:31] I never went to Bible School
[1:44:33] I've never learned how to preach in some
[1:44:36] Pentecostal church I church I left that
[1:44:39] the United Pentecostal church when I was
[1:44:40] six years old
[1:44:44] my my parents did I had nothing to do
[1:44:46] with it I followed them out
[1:44:54] I was born in there and I followed them
[1:44:56] out
[1:44:57] they wanted to come out because they
[1:44:58] didn't want to they wanted a church
[1:44:59] independent denomination
[1:45:02] they began to hear about brother Branham
[1:45:04] in the message and we started we got the
[1:45:05] first church age book in 1965.
[1:45:09] we begin to we begin to realize God sent
[1:45:12] a prophet and then God then God took him
[1:45:14] home
[1:45:17] and in that era of time in 1970 and a 15
[1:45:20] year old boy preacher boy I started
[1:45:23] preaching this message and I had never
[1:45:25] preached Azusa Street
[1:45:28] never
[1:45:32] well so you know
[1:45:35] but however
[1:45:36] I do want to say we are Pentecostal
[1:45:41] when brother Brandon preached here Leo
[1:45:44] to see in church and as a messenger of
[1:45:46] that church and preaching his message to
[1:45:49] that church age and he preached his time
[1:45:52] he said I want to be Pentecostal from
[1:45:55] the top of my head to the soul of my
[1:45:57] feet now I'm not denomination but I mean
[1:45:59] the real genuine
[1:46:05] hallelujah amen
[1:46:10] now you you know again brother Branham
[1:46:13] talks about it because he had to fight
[1:46:16] with the same thing his whole Ministry
[1:46:18] he had to defend dancing in the spirit
[1:46:22] he had to defend shouting he had to
[1:46:25] defend Divine Healing he had to defend
[1:46:28] workings of Miracles
[1:46:30] against a Church of Christ an antichrist
[1:46:34] spirit
[1:46:36] who raised up and said now because we
[1:46:39] have the complete Canon of the Bible
[1:46:43] then nothing can ever happen again
[1:46:46] we have the complete and total word of
[1:46:49] God so there cannot be a prophecy that
[1:46:51] would be an addition to the Bible there
[1:46:53] cannot be a healing because that would
[1:46:55] be an addition to the Bible there cannot
[1:46:57] be Miracles because that would be an
[1:46:59] addition to the Bible
[1:47:03] and they formed their cult and I call
[1:47:06] them Antichrist because Christ means the
[1:47:08] anointing and they're against the
[1:47:10] anointing
[1:47:13] anti-anointing and that Spirit has come
[1:47:17] right in the message of the hour
[1:47:22] and I think you know just like YouTube
[1:47:29] God is calling Ministries Apostles
[1:47:31] prophets teachers evangelists pastors
[1:47:35] I mean it's a shame to have to defend
[1:47:37] that
[1:47:38] it's ridiculous I mean now duh you ought
[1:47:41] to know God's calling ministers
[1:47:44] die we ought to know that but no you
[1:47:47] know they want to come along and use a
[1:47:49] few little isolated quotes there to try
[1:47:51] to shut down the ministry
[1:47:55] and the same thing happens with that
[1:47:57] Antichrist Spirit they're going to shut
[1:47:58] down shouting shut down
[1:48:00] same one that wants to shut down
[1:48:02] preaching
[1:48:03] and I have something to say
[1:48:06] I have something to say about some of
[1:48:08] these preachers
[1:48:09] they will criticize people in a prayer
[1:48:12] line that will be going to the prayer
[1:48:14] line and shouting and rejoicing and
[1:48:17] showing emotion and dancing to the
[1:48:19] spirit but they'll get up in the Pulpit
[1:48:21] themselves and they'll run back and
[1:48:23] forth on the platform and scream and
[1:48:24] holler and they call that anointing
[1:48:29] and they say oh but these are only
[1:48:31] blessings and it's without power
[1:48:38] I'll tell you what we come down to the
[1:48:40] point where there's just a few inspired
[1:48:42] preachers
[1:48:43] amen while the people just sit there and
[1:48:46] try to absorb it
[1:48:48] this is nicolaitanism
[1:48:51] I say it again it's Nicholas in his and
[1:48:54] his conquer the laity is to keep the
[1:48:56] holy ghost from moving in the pew
[1:49:00] I tell you the Holy Ghost is in the in
[1:49:02] the pulpit and a man can shout and
[1:49:05] scream under the anointing of God let me
[1:49:07] tell you under that same anointing that
[1:49:10] people can get under there and stand and
[1:49:12] shout and scream and rejoice
[1:49:15] Hallelujah
[1:49:19] yet you want some nickel here in spirit
[1:49:22] attire shut it down I'll tell you it
[1:49:26] ain't gonna happen
[1:49:28] might happen in your church you can have
[1:49:30] that if you want to but here an evening
[1:49:32] like Tabernacle we're gonna have the
[1:49:34] power of God under salvation we're going
[1:49:37] to have to Leverage
[1:49:53] well Pentecost is over brother Tim
[1:49:55] that's ages passed and gone yazoo's the
[1:49:57] street is
[1:49:58] that's not where we're at we're in the
[1:50:00] bride age but Pentecost is not over
[1:50:03] let me read you the from the prophet of
[1:50:05] God where they were saying days of
[1:50:07] Miracles have passed and he was he was
[1:50:09] talking about 1965 in the Easter seal
[1:50:12] and he was talking about the gifts of
[1:50:14] the Spirit and and how that somebody on
[1:50:16] the radio was criticizing Divine Healing
[1:50:19] gifts of the Spirit the moving of the
[1:50:21] Holy Ghost and said the days of of the
[1:50:24] Apostles is over with
[1:50:27] and he said
[1:50:28] he said Paul is ordaining these gifts in
[1:50:31] the church 30 years later
[1:50:33] and said in Galatians 1 and 8 if an
[1:50:36] angel from heaven preaches to you any
[1:50:38] other gospel than this which is already
[1:50:40] received see already been preached let
[1:50:44] him let him be a curse I believe that
[1:50:48] Pentecost began without an ending I
[1:50:51] believe it is to Every Creature all
[1:50:54] times all places that Pentecost should
[1:50:56] always remain the Pentecost of blessing
[1:50:59] should be upon the people
[1:51:03] well I better tell them what you have
[1:51:05] there is is not power it's blessings
[1:51:07] okay but the Pentecostal blessing is
[1:51:10] always be on the people
[1:51:13] what's wrong with the blessings
[1:51:16] [Applause]
[1:51:19] and I bet you ain't got no power either
[1:51:33] anointing without power is satanic
[1:51:39] listen
[1:51:41] oh yeah
[1:51:43] oh but brother Brandon said the word
[1:51:45] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[1:51:46] not work for today
[1:51:48] this is for the bride we got something
[1:51:50] different
[1:51:51] you don't think I know that quote
[1:51:54] oh yeah I know it
[1:51:56] I believe it
[1:51:59] you know you don't don't use something
[1:52:01] like that to throw a stone at me
[1:52:04] that's for the enemy
[1:52:07] I believe that
[1:52:09] well the the
[1:52:12] but you see
[1:52:15] you see the word that was fell on the
[1:52:17] day of Pentecost will not work for today
[1:52:19] we do not go to the city of Jerusalem to
[1:52:24] be empowered well if I'm on high but you
[1:52:27] must be empowered
[1:52:30] but you don't have to wait what was it
[1:52:34] what was it how long did they wait
[1:52:36] 11 days what was it 10 days whatever it
[1:52:40] was they waited they had to wait after
[1:52:43] the Ascension for the Holy Ghost to come
[1:52:46] and you know ever since then nobody has
[1:52:49] to wait
[1:52:51] we're not able now let me explain that
[1:52:53] we are not waiting for the spirit to
[1:52:57] come God is waiting on you to repent
[1:53:02] to submit yourself
[1:53:04] amen there's still a waiting there are
[1:53:07] people that have to tarry some people
[1:53:08] wait for 10 years
[1:53:11] because it won't die out to Old Man's
[1:53:13] self
[1:53:15] but not because the Holy Ghost ain't
[1:53:17] here the Holy Ghost is there the first
[1:53:19] day he'll be for you the moment you
[1:53:22] repent
[1:53:26] but God ain't going to come and seal
[1:53:27] your car and all kinds of meanness and
[1:53:29] everything else in it God ain't going to
[1:53:32] come and see I'm talking about the
[1:53:33] railway car the railway car brother
[1:53:35] random side of Houston I work for the
[1:53:37] railway
[1:53:39] and he said no you know there they would
[1:53:42] pack that car
[1:53:44] and and everything had to be put in just
[1:53:47] right
[1:53:48] then an inspector had to come along and
[1:53:50] and inspect
[1:53:52] what was in there and that it was right
[1:53:54] he said because he would have to not
[1:53:57] Shake loose
[1:53:58] on the journey
[1:54:01] because they would be responsible for
[1:54:03] the damage
[1:54:05] so you know if your temper is out of
[1:54:07] place
[1:54:09] if your lust is out of place
[1:54:11] you know lust is desires is just for the
[1:54:14] wrong things you get that desire toward
[1:54:16] Christ it's okay
[1:54:19] come on to have a great desire and love
[1:54:22] for your wife that's wonderful
[1:54:25] but for somebody else's wife that's sin
[1:54:29] are you with me so all of that has got
[1:54:31] to be put into place
[1:54:36] Before He'll seal the car
[1:54:38] and he comes there and he checks and he
[1:54:41] sees in your repentance and he visits
[1:54:43] you at the altar and sees in your
[1:54:44] repentance that there's still something
[1:54:46] loose in your life that you hadn't
[1:54:48] surrendered you know what's going to
[1:54:50] happen
[1:54:51] you're going to wait
[1:54:55] you're going to wait till that gets put
[1:54:56] in order
[1:54:57] because it's going to be sealed to the
[1:54:59] day of redemption
[1:55:01] it's going to be sealed to the rapture
[1:55:04] are you with me so these things have got
[1:55:07] to be put in order in your life and
[1:55:09] surrender to God you've got to give up
[1:55:11] the desires of the world you got to
[1:55:13] surrender
[1:55:15] amen and the more you surrender the more
[1:55:18] he takes control
[1:55:19] now so you see again again that the
[1:55:23] season of waiting is over listen brother
[1:55:25] Bradham tells us in Gabriel's
[1:55:27] instruction to Daniel God never blesses
[1:55:30] Israel till she gets to her Homeland God
[1:55:33] will never bless you a Methodist of
[1:55:36] baptism Presbyterian a Catholic Pilgrim
[1:55:38] holding his Nazarene Church of Christ or
[1:55:40] a Pentecostal organization he will never
[1:55:43] bless you that way come back to the
[1:55:45] Homeland to the beginning back to the
[1:55:48] Pentecostal experience like it happened
[1:55:50] on the day of Pentecost when the power
[1:55:52] of the Living God changed those
[1:55:54] thousands of people and set their heart
[1:55:57] aflame with the fire god that showed
[1:55:59] genuine not impersonated signs
[1:56:03] don't just stand there at the border and
[1:56:05] look
[1:56:07] don't don't don't just walk over there
[1:56:10] I've got just a few more minutes
[1:56:18] earn peace
[1:56:22] Giant on that I'll never do that I
[1:56:25] I could never be that way no
[1:56:31] you know
[1:56:33] Jesus passed by victory
[1:56:35] and he was disappointed there was no fix
[1:56:39] and he looked at it and said no man
[1:56:41] eateth from thee from henceforth
[1:56:44] now I'm going to tell you so it ain't a
[1:56:47] certain season we're waiting on you know
[1:56:49] if it is we've arrived this is Harvest
[1:56:52] Time this harvest season
[1:56:55] this is bright time
[1:56:57] I mean you want to go down and name it
[1:57:00] it's Eagle time
[1:57:02] Eagle hour
[1:57:04] all of these things that he mentioned
[1:57:07] wheat
[1:57:08] wheat age talking age
[1:57:12] so whatever it's all in season
[1:57:15] the word is always in season and and the
[1:57:17] bride tree is one he said like in
[1:57:20] restoration of Bright Tree now when
[1:57:22] that's tree that Jesus that God planted
[1:57:25] it was to Bear nine different kinds of
[1:57:28] fruit nine different kinds which means
[1:57:30] nine spiritual gifts nine fruits of the
[1:57:33] spirit to go with nine spiritual gifts
[1:57:36] that was God's tree he planted it on the
[1:57:38] day of Pentecost
[1:57:40] and this tree is planted by the river
[1:57:42] where the Springs nine different Springs
[1:57:45] reading into him rivers of water one
[1:57:48] Spirit one water one Spirit there are
[1:57:51] Gifts of healing Same Spirit Gifts of
[1:57:53] Prophecy Same Spirit All The Same Spirit
[1:57:56] but many gifts one Giver
[1:58:00] we're still in the message aren't we
[1:58:02] all right now and I'll tell you what if
[1:58:05] Jesus if Jesus comes to this church
[1:58:09] I'm talking about the Church of this
[1:58:10] last day and he doesn't find faith
[1:58:14] he's going to be like he was with that
[1:58:16] fig tree disappointed
[1:58:17] in fact of the matter is to keep that
[1:58:21] from happening and he said I'm going to
[1:58:23] send you Elijah the prophet to turn your
[1:58:25] hearts back to the Pentecostal faith of
[1:58:27] the fathers
[1:58:28] lest I have to just Smite it all with a
[1:58:31] curse because if I don't send Elijah to
[1:58:33] bring a restoration I'll have to curse
[1:58:35] the whole thing
[1:58:38] now he actually does this at kadash he
[1:58:41] says he says to Moses I'm going to curse
[1:58:44] the whole bunch of them to every one of
