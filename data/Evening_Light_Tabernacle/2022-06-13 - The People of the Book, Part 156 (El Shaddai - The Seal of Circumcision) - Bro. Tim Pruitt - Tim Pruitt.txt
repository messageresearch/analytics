that we find help in our time of need and lord we thank you that it is the throne of mercy that we approach lord we are grateful to you for all that you have done and you're doing and hands lifted up to you that says lord i need you to do something for me special this morning i want you to come by my way lord i think about right now in the service over at happy valley church there in johnson city brother donny the church there right now having a prayer line no doubt many of your children coming through and each one having special burdens and situations i pray that you'll meet them too lord may they find out lord that you're a living god and that you answer the prayers of your people and that you bring healing deliverance i know you want to do that lord i pray father you'll save this the sick lord from their sickness save the lost from their sins i pray lord you bless the people that have joined with us around the world that god that you are [Music] you will just meet with them in a special way today may it be that your anointing just sweeps in lord the understanding and the enlightenment of the word becomes real to them ever need supply we pray in the name of jesus we ask it amen amen god bless you turn with me to genesis 17 and we'll read from the first to the third verses then we'll skip down to verse seven so genesis 1-3 and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying now drop down to verse 7 now and as we're reading this i want you to think these things were written in the scripture for our examples amen so that we through comfort and hope of the scripture might have find our hope in them so there again verse 7 and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee and their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee and to that seed after thee the land were in thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god amen do you know what that means to us that means everything that's in our canaan which is the holy ghost he has given to us everything it is a an everlasting possession and he will be our god and god said to abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee and their generations and this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee and he goes off and he says thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not steal and thou shalt not bear false witness and thou shalt not commit adultery is that the covenant he's making no here's the covenant he makes with the seed of abraham here's what he does every man child among you shall be circumcised this is my covenant i'm going to make with you every child must be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token or the sign of the covenant so the circumcision is going to be the sign of the covenant the cutting off of the flesh is going to be the sign that you are in covenant with god amen and and he that is eight days old um and shall be circumcised among you a man every man child in your generation he that's born in the house are bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed and he that is born in that house and he that is bought with thy money must be circumcised my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man-child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant but my covenant verse 21 my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at the set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham just to just so we can be rested together mark 16 verse 14. just gonna have you stand as i read this one still afterwards he abraded he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at mead and upgraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved that he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen god bless you can be seated of course that should be said of every believe in church and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following i think it's very important that we as a people who are in the unfolding of the last day events by the opening of the seventh seal which brings us into the the phases of his coming as it not it's not a singular event but a multitude of events winding up the end time processes and i think it's very important that we realize that it is to those who have received the breaking of the silence the revealing of the word that we have received the uh the again this admonition to fulfill and finish the great commission brother branham would tell us this an invisible union of the bride it's very striking where he talks about this uh he talks about the seventh um about the seven seals being opened and he said this is why the denominations cannot fulfill or finish the great commission because they can't even agree on just one or two of the words much less the entire word of god and so it is those who receive of the entire word that have the the um the duty then to fulfill and finish the great commission now we have been 2 000 years and yet the gospel is not went into the into all the world yet and we are right now of course um a people that are uh have went beyond borders beyond the um between between the boundaries that men set up of countries and communist countries and and um you know all types of countries where that they had they had boundaries that were set up where that the gospel could not get in but we are people that are breaching all of those and the gospel will reach every predestinated seed now it's not it's so important that every person hears it but that the seed of god hears it and because god has an elect now so again you know we the gospel must be preached everywhere the lord working with us and confirming the words following with signs following so yeah i'm hammering at this just like noah did in his day preparing the ark for his salvation now we we preach a lot of times as it was in the days of noah and we say okay well they're married and given in marriage and and they're um there's marriage and divorce and remarriage and the buying and selling and trading and they're building cities and and going on like everything is is going to last forever but forget don't forget there's another part to the days of noah and that is a people in the last day that are hammering on an ark that are making a way through this perilous times that we're in and a people that are going to make it to the other side so we are like it was at noah's junction noah could say there's water coming from the sky there's going to be so much of it that it will float an ark that would be full of life and it but it would take the omnipotence of god to do it but you see and god had pro exactly perfect instructions on how it was to be built how the way prepared to to make that escape of the things that was coming on the earth and i want you to remember this is the same thing that we're also building an ark we're building a way of escape and that way of escape is a rapture for us it's not a flood that's coming it's a fire that's going to fall but there's a people going to leave here by the fire before the fire falls so you see noah was preparing an ark he was making a place of safety and that was a miracle all of his own of course you know there there had to be some signs in that would follow them that believed there had to be an effect that would take place and and not only would it gather the elect of the people of that day but in that time the supernatural would go out and gather all the animals into the ark amen you you see there was a whole moving of the spirit of god as things were happening and the omnipotence of god was being shown at that junction and and so he was preaching there was there is a water coming out of the skies well it never rained well it's different from us we're saying there's fire going to fall and there's already been fire f fallen right hiroshima would vanish in just a moment and nagasaki and different other places we've seen what the fire can do and russia has got you know three three uh uh networks of bombs that they have got for america when they hit the east coast one hit the west coast and then other with um with our government uh central place and they say this they call it satan and these satan bombs will just unleash just thousands of warheads at a time and wipe out the whole country at a time brother branham told us they got our name on it they call it satan we have turned from the lamb to speak as a dragon now so you see but but by faith you know noah was warned of god and he prepared an ark now that's what we're trying to do is prepare a people for the coming of the lord so no matter how foolish it might have been and seem and how fanatical it might be you see it's a miracle to see a people in this day hammering away at something that seems just impossible or ridiculous you know to to really go in a rapture to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you see but all of that is repeating again just as noah was calling for rain it repeats again when men are pounding the gospel of the lord jesus christ preaching the baptism of the holy ghost and getting a people ready for the coming judgment preparing a shield from that amen may and while all this is going on modern churches laughing you know all the rebellion against the word of god that is going on and on and on and on today and the church is laboring under the preaching of the gospel with signs and wonders why because they are preparing for a miracle and i just want to say this is exactly what god is doing right now he is preparing a people for a miracle every sign every healing every deliverance everything is preparing hearts for a miracle and that miracle of course will be the rapture of the church that changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye think about it a day of gone by they didn't even know what rain meant it never rained and yet 2 000 years ago you know um after god's preaching the gospel now for 2 000 years people don't know what it means to be born again or the spirit of god they don't know what omnipotence means they don't know god's omnipotent power that can transform a soul from a street center to an angelic position in the kingdom of god as a son or daughter of god amen they don't understand it they're too infatuated with the things of the world they're still flirting and don't realize that that's an evil spirit and a great signpost for the people of this day to watch and be ready our we are a signpost because we are declaring god's omnipotent power in this great time of darkness now we've been speaking on el shaddai but that was at a junction and we are at that same junction this is a time of the pouring out of the almighty the pouring out of the spirit of god you know it was a time when god's omnipotence was shown and we are at a junction where the holy ghost that has worked by portion through justification and sanctification and baptism of the spirit but is but but he's now here as almighty god in full omnipotence in the full power of the holy ghost now so as we as we know el shaddai means it comes from the word breast like a woman abraham i'm coming to you in the name of the breasted one the nurse the life-giver like when a little baby is sick and the mother holds that that child to its breast and she nurses if it's fretting and crying and it just lays there and nurses and and gets strong right amen so where's this nursing his life from it's nursing from its mother and god appears to us as el shaddai the breasted one both of them the old and the new testament just full of promises full of the vitamins of the word not just one breast but two breasts amen why he died for a compound reason amen he was wounded by transgressions and with his stripes he provided a way for our healing that's one breath and one for our salvation one for our healing amen i'm the breast of god i have two witnesses in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everywhere be established so in the old testament he would be known as jehovah or alpha jehovah jireh the lord did he let the jehovah in the old testament that the different compound names of him but in the new testament he would be known by one name amen by one name his name would be one and in that name and only in that name would there be salvation there would not be deliverance in the name of el salvador or elohim or or the only way of salvation would be to recognize that all of them was encapsulated in jesus christ and that jesus christ was a man that else said i am that else said i became jesus christ that elohim became jesus christ that melchizedek became jesus christ and all the fullness of god was wrapped up into that one and contrary to some of these some of these liars today that think that oh one day the body of jesus christ would just become like another man and and no that will he will be there throughout eternity the only visible form of god will be in jesus christ now so we can take the old testament we can go back there and we can draw strength from it we can go the new testament and we can draw strength from it amen and then that in that drawing strength you know we can have strength for our healing or strength for our salvation it doesn't matter what the need is it's all encapsulated in him amen it's all lays right there in the word and that's why we always try to get your faith not to lie in man but in the word of god because it's the word of god that never fails are you with me amen so you know in this type we're all kind of like bottle babies amen god provided two bottles old and new testament amen we got spiritual vitamins in it there there's calcium for the bones b vitamins for the complex there for the for the nerves if you're nervous if you're full of anxiety hey man there's plenty of things in here to calm it hey man if you're weak and your bones are weak there's plenty of calcium in this word to give you strength for the journey it doesn't matter what your need is you can draw it from the word of god amen and it's up to date it's for right now it's for this moment now god would say to abraham you're going to have a promised son so how am i going to bring it how is it sarah is this 2 000 year old new testament bride is going to how is it she's going to finally bring forth the promised son how is he going to bring jesus back to earth again we've been looking for it a long time and to a large degree many have given up on it and you know how are they how are they going to bring forth it they are going to do it by receiving receiving el shaddai and nursing from him and so how are we going to do it we're going to do it the same way else that i represents the baptism of the holy ghost it is christ in the full power of his word amen to do this god will require a covenant and that covenant will be the sign of circumcision are you with me now that's why we're speaking this morning on the seal of circumcision the seal that sign of circumcision is the cutting off of the flesh in the secret parts now you see you see it isn't about laws of do's and don'ts it's about changing the heart you know a lot of people say well it don't matter what's on the outside it's what's on the inside and the inside is what is important that must be changed but you get the inside fixed and it will control the outside amen amen now you see again the sign of the circumcision is the cutting off of the flesh in the secret parts that was the old testament covenant the new it is the cutting off of the flesh in the secret part of the heart because our heart is being claimed by god and it belongs to him and all the issue from the heart belongs to him and thus our life belongs to him god says if i can get their heart i'll have the rest of them amen that's what god wants remember you know he told them about laws and this and that the other and thou shalt not because they ask what can we do so he gave him a bunch of things to do and but then he then he expressed his desire oh that my people would just love me with all of their heart with all of their soul with all their being that's what i want i want to be loved from the heart i'm not so interested in you loving me because you'll i'll save you from hell i want you to love me for who i am now so among the pharisees there was always this um there was always much concern as the strict keepers of the law about the outward cleansing of the hands remember they would go around complaining about the disciples they didn't wash their hands before they ate and they didn't do these certain ceremonial things and you know we we do that because we're more holy that way and and jesus was more concerned about the condition of the heart than the condition of the of their hands you see it was always law do this and don't do that it was never a love affair it was never done out of love it was always done out of this is what i have to do you see a bomb's woman like hagar she never had a love affair with abraham a bonds woman never serves out of love they do it because they are forced to do it you see they are born bombs woman and they are they are told that's what you have to do because they're slaves now you see there's been too many slaves in christianity god is not marrying a slave woman he's marrying a free woman do you understand you know that when you see you see many years ago they would they were there was slaves sold and they would go and swap slaves and and and brother branham said of that he said that's what many of you are right now is a slave many of you through the city and through the country are nothing but church slaves nothing but slaves to christianity when you should be free you see god wants more than a denominational christian who just has a form of godliness and lacks the power you see it's more about receiving the power than it is receiving the dress code amen it's it's more you see god wants children of the supernatural not children of the slave woman that's what god wants he wants those that are born again my children are people who love me who call me father amen a people who know their god so they can do exploits because they're not slaves a slave doesn't worry about all the other things around there he just to slay it it is the three children that says this is our land this is our country this is our promise this is our boundaries this belongs to us because we are the free people it don't belong to slaves i want to get something to you every promise in this bible belongs to you it does not belong to slaves we have to get rid of our slave mentality and realize we are now the children of the most high god and every promise of the word belongs to us now true the seed of the word you can give the word of god portions of the word of god to a bonds woman but it'll only produce an ishmaelite a wild man you can put promises of the word of god in a bonds woman and it'll bring forth life but what kind of life is ishmael meal never give the word of god preeminence and god had to bring an isaac that would bring the give the word preeminence there would be a difference between the two one would be a gentle man yielding to god obeying god fell led by god the other would be a wild man but i'm seated of abraham i'm a christian and i can live like this you see because they won't be subject to the word of god because why they are it brings forth wild seed now the constant upholding of the word of god is what people don't understand so when you watch the life of abraham it was the constant unfolding of god they even get confused on the deity of god and first thing you know you've got multiple deities you've got elohim and el shaddai and the almighty and then you have jehovah rapha and all the different forms of rapha or jehovah i mean and all of that next thing you know you got many gods because why it was just god unfolding itself the same god all the time now so we many times people don't understand the unfolding of god and the question comes like through abraham how could god give me ishmael and yet he's not the one how could it be the spirit you know that god allowed me to have this son and yet he's not the one he's making covenant with you see you see it was where it was times where where that was where god was not where god is you see luther was where god once was and god blessed him and he brought forth a bunch of wild lutherans and wesley is where god was amen god blessed him and he brought forth a bunch of wild methodists i don't know if you've been watching them in the news here or listening about them in the news but there the methodist church there is is um you know is actually there's a split going on within their denomination because a whole group of them are accepting the homosexual community which by the way some of you have asked me what the h word was that's the h word that you're not supposed to say anymore from the pulpit but anyway you know they they have this whole movement that is going on where you know with wesley why because they brought forth a bunch of wild children who will not be subject to the bible not even on basic things not even on righteous living you see and again the azusa street revival was where god was and and and and and so but again it brought forth a bunch of wild seed that wouldn't be subject to the word of god that would take his gifts that will take his prophecies they'll take his tongues they'll take his interpretations they'll take manifestations but they don't want him they won't give him preeminence so you know again now god has revealed himself in word form coming to a prophet that's actually what you see of that mighty one coming down in revelation 10 that is the word coming to a prophet it is christ coming in word form to a prophet but but now we're at another junction we're a junction where it changes from the days of the voice of the seventh angel and now that voice is finished and he has sounded his message as the lord descends he progresses from the shout to the voice the voice of the resurrected ones now and so william so many stopped in revelation 10 7 you know that's good that's wonderful and it still is wonderful but what about the rest god continues moving on he continues unfolding himself you see revelation 10 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven speak to me again go and take the little book which is open it was close to revelation 5 open in revelation 10 what happened a messenger came and the and the mysteries was revealed him god opened the seven seals and took the seals off the book providing us an open book amen where the whole bible is open to us from genesis to revelation and it all becomes pertinent come on and we are going to give it preeminence because there's got to be a people in this day who give that word preeminence now so again you see he said go take the little book and which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and then he commands him to eat the book amen now you see this was not wrote to some apostle coleman this does not this does not represent teacher veil john here is typing the bride this is you in the bible and she goes to the angel and says give me the little book verse nine and he said take it and eat it up there's some people there's some people that are saying give me every promise in that word i don't care what it is if it's healing i want it if it's against the spirit i want it if it's the dynamics i want it if it's the mechanics i want it if it's baptism in jesus name i want it if it's one god i want it everything that's in that bible i want it i'm going to give that word preeminence because i'm not a slave and a slave now as a wife she will give him total preeminence out of love the others out of duty why do we want to eat it the word the message must become flesh you see else had i was the breasted god eat of me i'm your sustainer i'm the giver of life and when eating and digested then it becomes a voice thou must prophesy again verse 11 and he said to me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen so again there must be a final voice a bride who's under her messenger becomes the final voice to the final age but you know we have received the word brother tim the message and that all there is just to receive the message isn't that the climax you can't go any further than the word can you why not just the word brother tim the word don't we receive the holy ghost when when we receive the word well let me just say it's got to be more than word in a book form the word has to become flesh it has to produce a people of the supernatural you see it must say the lord god omnipotent reigneth the lord is in full power full control of this people amen he must be displayed in his fullness in all that he is why because it's not complete until it's made flesh and all the word manifests in itself in bright form now as we look at this i want to just remind you of this quotation brother branham said as soon as he can get his church in speaking conditions where the word comes on your lips when he gets his word in his church and speaking conditions he gets his church to a place he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then there will come an eaten how many likes to eden to come amen he'll take the church back where it left him at back to an eden again where there where it fell god's going to bring a people back to eden but it will be as soon as he can get his people in unison with the word and saying what the word said agreeing with the word and applying that word you see you can never be healed until you agree the bible's true and that jesus died for you and he paid for your healing and you confess it is yours you see you can never be saved unless you first realize you first realize that he that cometh to god must believe that he is as long as you're wondering whether god exists or not you can never be saved you must believe he is and that he will reward those that diligently seek him so therefore you never give up you keep pressing in you keep seeking and seeking until you are rewarded because you believe he's going to reward you you have to believe the promise is yours now only el shaddai can take us back to eden almighty god only he can do that a true baptism of the holy ghost is the only thing that will produce a bride without the holy ghost this morning you may be potential bride but you're not bride until you enter into covenant you might be engaged and committed and say i got a ring of predestinated unmerited grace brother damn i'm called before the foundation but until you get that seal of circumcision until you are enter into covenant with him until you receive his life into you you are not yet bride now you see only a true baptism of the holy ghost can do this because you see sarah was 90 abraham was a hundred god would have to restore their bodies he'd have to heal sarah for bareness he would he would portray and use their voices as a voice of prophecy of what he would do at the end time for he pours out his spirit in its fullness until he changes the body of the living church let me tell you do not do not one moment give up on more of the pouring out of the holy ghost do not for a moment think we got it all now until our bodies change we will need a refilling after feeling after feeling after moving after moving after moving of the holy ghost you will need another drink from outside the eye you need you'll need another dip of the spirit you will need another draw from the life of god and it will happen until your bodies are changed don't ever stop progressing don't put a period in your experience i've got all that i need and i don't need anymore that's laodicea god i have needed nothing amen one of the very evidences of the holy spirit in your life will be a constant desire for more now you see again you see it's going to take el shaddai to do this almighty god it will require him to get a bride in the rapture it will require it look it required god to turn our hearts back to faith in believing again it required god not a denomination not a theologian a god to come and move and use a prophet to bring the word again whether we have what was presented in the book of acts it would take that it would take the supernatural and it's going to take the supernatural every step of the way now god promised that the grain of wheat that he planted at pentecost in the book of acts would return back to grain again now the other stages of the wheat plant the blade the toss of the shell they were not the promised restoration when god said i will restore and he planted a church and it was it was a weak grain a mature church a mature grain at pentecost he's got to have the same thing when he comes back again you don't harvest hay of the wheat you don't harvest the blade you don't harvest the shuck sucks no you don't do that right amen you want the grain god is coming for a mature church a mature body a restored people now so you see this is like it was with abraham even as ishmael was not the promised son neither was a zoos of pentecost a restoration of pentecost it's called that just like ishmael was called the son the promised son and even abraham abram believed that for a while until god said no no no he's not the one that was of your strength i'm going to bring one of the supernatural so you see the seed that was planted and during the dark ages it came up and the corn began to grow and so we had different stages of the same wheat plant it wasn't that luther wasn't wheat they were wheat they were just another stage not a harvestable stage that's why rapture didn't take place in that day but you see we are at a harvestable stage amen where that the wheat grain that was at pentecost has come now again in the last day for another harvest this time not to be planted and repeat ages over again but this time to go in the garner and go in a rapture amen so you've added down to the ages you had the the the advancement of the of the church as a wheat plant you'd have the missionary age and which was the pollen age and the thousands with was wesley and greatest missionaries and you know went around the world and excelled us many times in our age with their seal and everything else but what that age do is scattered like pollen in the breeze amen and then what's the next step now logically after the pollen you would think oh next thing is the grave right that's logic but before the grain comes the shock comes and that shock was azusa street it would look like the real seat so much that it would get misnamed pentecost it would get misnamed pentecost until today there's a confusion when you say pentecost many people think you're speaking about azusa street and pentecost they never was pentecost and they are pentecost they label themselves like ishmael did abraham's seed but he said that's not your seed they are not in the covenant i'm making a covenant are you with me i'm making a covenant with isaac i'm going to bring a son out of the pre a predestinated son by the supernatural and it'll be that supernatural church of people born of the word with the word of birth and they are the word the full word not part word all the word now so you have the husk or the chaff that comes to protect the seed and out of that would come the little seed we would be birthed right out of that shock movement what do you think brother branham came from he came right there who received him who protected him who let it grow where did that come where did that message start up in the azusa movement amen now you walk through those grain fields in the late summer pluck the heads of wheat rubbing your hands they get grain and at that stage they ain't none it shuck are they important yes was it a move of god yes did the holy ghost move there yes just like he did in abraham's past yes but now he's revealing himself in a greater way and he's going to pour out his fullness as almighty god with all the old and the new testament are you with me now so you open up that there ain't no grain in there you just got a chaff though it looked like surely wheat was there you see but to prove that it was not they just become another denomination they just become another bombs woman they showed herself as another slave to men's creeds amen and proving that instead of being the real seed they were the chaff amen they were just a protecting cover for the wheat seed that would come and it's this stage that is so dangerous because this stage is the stage that jesus said matthew 24 24 that they would deceive the elect if it were possible so become so close that you're sure you got grain but there ain't no grain in it it's not a mature church it never will mature into that it's got something come out of that that comes to maturity so you know man felt like this huck this husk this this um so-called pentecostal age was a true seed but it proved to be just a carrier carrying the life over the next age in which the true restoration comes and the weep bride is manifested in power so you see there was not a restoration back in luther that was not the restoration of the original grain it was just a further advancement toward that wesleyan church did not restore and then speaking of the azusa movement brother branham said the pentecostal age did not restore but god has to restore it because he cannot deny his word this is the restoration god will take the church right back to pentecost of the beginning so whatever was planted in the original church it's going to be here in the last day church now i have a reason for going over this because we want to understand what kind of people would she be she will be a genuine christ-centered christ-centered word of god christ's field christ-centered word of god that's what the bride will be a genuine christ-filled christ-centered word of god now and from this will come the royal seed of abraham the seed of the promise now and i want you to say today the promised seed is here amen not back at azusa street but right now it is this message that brings forth the promised seed the seed that is going to go in the garner now for those of you that don't know azuza street what that means well it was a street it was a street where there was a house in um in los angeles california it's actual street in los angeles called azusa and there was a a house there where that they met and they had a little upper room in it and a prayer room down low and and there they all gathered in the holy spirit fell and speaking in tongues began to take place and they began to have an outpouring of the holy spirit and so that from that little church meeting come now nearly um nearly 500 million believers today who believe because of that azusa movement and let me just say to you i mean we we too we too have roots back there just like we do in wesley and luther amen but you see the zeus movement was not the promised bride of pentecost just as ishmael was not the promised seed of abraham and that's why we're not trying to reproduce azusa street again many times people hear me preach on some of these things oh he's trying to go back to pentecost well i sure am that's what malachi 4 was to do turn our hearts back to where the pentecostal fathers but i'm not trying to get a people to go back to azusa street neither am i trying to bring a people back to baptist or methodist or lutheran in our beliefs but back to the original bible the full word of god are you with me amen so you see this message is a return back to pentecost but not a zoo's history but a continuation of the book of acts now ishmael was called the seed of abraham but was not the child of the promise of zeus it was thought to be to return to pentecost but it was not they thought because they spoke in tongues and manifested gifts of the spirit it was a long awaited restoration and brother branham said it was not for the latter rain can only come after the form of rain which is the springer teaching rain the latter rain then is a harvest ring how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers had not come thus was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the rapture had not come and it was a mixture of unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the holy ghost as we kept pointing out to you it was also devil power well as men were under control of of devils yet no one seemed to realize and then to prove it was not real these people within seven years of the zusa movement formed a denomination on speaking in tongues being the initial evidence and so they organized and they wrote these kind of unscriptural doctrines and built their fences as every other group ahead of them did and they got a bunch of slaves that they keep confined now these pentecostal charismatic full gospel people were actually given the promise of el shaddai the open book about both the old new and new testament they were actually offered it but you see they were offered but instead of taking the open book that would restore them back to the original vine they took instead the breast from a denomination specifically they took speaking in tongues as initial evidence and denied the birth of the world now you get it they made speaking in tongues more important and greater than even the discernment which proved the word was now present because only the word discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart so speaking in an unknown tongue or that nobody understands became more important than god discerning the heart turn with me to hebrews 4 12. i want to show you what the word of god is the word of god is quick that means it's alive it is powerful it is sharper than a two-edged sword it pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit brother it can get right down and pierce look way down into the very soul of man it can say you're shattered with death and that be cancer you're shadowed with death oh that's sin even the dividing of the soul and spirit and of the joints in the morrow and is the discerner of what thoughts and entrance of heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight in other words the word totally has a capability of totally exposing sin sickness disease everything but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with it with whom we have to do so that you see that the gift of discernment that we saw exhibit to the prophet of god was not the word of knowledge it was the same ministry it was not one of the nine gifts it was one the same ministry that identified that the messiah was here 2 000 years ago that very discernment that said your name is so-and-so and you came from so and so and you you know i see you coming across the sea and you've got this affliction and died and oh you know you're you're healed where where what was that that was that was the same ministry of jesus christ that was identified to us that the word was now present because only the word can do that that was the vindication the word had come to a prophet now the samaritan woman at the well whose heart would discern when she stood and her past was completely exposed before him when when the messiah comes she knew he would do these things see that was a sign of the messiah then amen it was the same ministry that identified and as elohim who appeared to abraham and sarah and told of isaac's coming discerned her heart in the tent behind him you see this proved to us god was speaking that's why it never failed because god can't fail amen brother branham now brother branham was not the messiah amen but his gift proved that the messiah the word was present so this discernment that you hear us talking about the discerns the thoughts and the influence of heart was to identify somebody who was present that knew your past your future your present who you were what your disease was what your sin was everything exposed before you before him amen now that was not identified brother branham as the messiah that was identified the messiah christ the anointed word was now here now also it was identification of the deity of god to the last age the amen because every time that brother branham would finish what he have the discernment said now god will speak and he and amen was given the final say if i have told you the truth let him come now you see this proved that god was speaking in this generation that the word had come now but pentecost the azusa movement made the least gift of the spirit which is speaking in tongues more important and greater than the word itself like what the word says about holiness as long as you speak in tongues you can still bob off your hair cross dress wear men's imperil go out in public in their underwear their shorts right wow as long as we spoke in tongues and they exalted the least gift greater than the sign of the messiah and they would reject the word over receiving their gift now i want you to get this so what's the pentecostal age as he come through there he made the promise of el shaddai nurse for me the question is can you nurse that was brought before the pentecostals seal said i was offered them can you nurse in other words can you receive it but they didn't do it they grabbed the breasts from a denomination where they came out of but then the real seed the seed the real seed came to nurse on that breast so one took a denominational breast the other has been offered a shed eye a real seed that has come to nurse on that until their bodies are changed i want you to get that thought now the ensues of movement organized on evidence of the holy ghost being speaking in tongues even daddy bosworth knew this was wrong he lost his position among them he was assembly of god he debated before the the general counsel assembly of god their organization he debated on the subject of tongues being the evidence of the holy ghost and it was not he declared is not the evidence or the initial evidence the holy ghost does speak with tongues but it's not it's not the initial evidence and he debated that before the assembly of god organization and they kicked him out so they took the breast of denomination by nursing for their strength a dogma of the church of the initial evidence of the holy ghost is speaking in tongues so what today is the strength of azusa pentecost i spoke in tongues i spoke in tongues and they can go out and backslide and come back to alder and speak in tongues they're all right they're ready to go rapture bound and go back out sin go out marry somebody else come back in the church and speak in tongues again because why that is the streak they are nursing from that organization and it's dubnia are you with me amen so they take the breast of denomination by nursing their strength a dogma of the church of the evidence of the holy ghost is speaking in tongues and that becomes the their assurance i have the holy ghost is because i spoke in tongues now that's where azusa made their mistake the holy ghost does indeed speak with tongues but the holy ghost is not tongues tongues is a gift of the spirit the same as gift of healing workings of miracles word of knowledge are all gifts of the spirit it's what the spirit does do amen tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost it's just one of the many things that the holy ghost does tongues is a gift of the spirit not the spirit and yet they can still speak in tongues and bob their hair and paint their face and cross dress and drink cocktails and sniff a little cocaine or marry and divorce and remarry and even remain in their formal denominations even just speak in tongues and go back to their episcopalian church or catholic church and you know there the pope is speaking in tongues and the bishops are speaking in tongues and they all have the holy ghost because what they drank their strength that i now have the holy ghost from a dogma from the breast of a denomination amen now you see they will but yet they will reject the word even elementary basic truths like baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ but i'm going to heaven because my strength is based on my assurances based on i spoke in tongues but then turn around and reject the word of god in other words they won't let the word have preeminence now i'm trying to get to something because we're going to talk about the evidence of the holy ghost today and you're going to understand it's a the evidence is not going to be just one thing it's just like the evidence of being a human is not having hair you do have hair most humans have it most all of them if they're normal they have hair but everything that has hair is not a human so we cannot identify a dog is a human because it has hair it's a dog a cat has hair but it's a cat it's not a human but one of the traits of being human it will have hair right now the same thing tongues is like hair all humans have hair but everything that has hair is not a human hair is not the evidence of being a human amen so if so some of you are less human than others speaking in tongues is in the body of christ i mean believes that it's what we do i said it's what we do amen these signs follow them that believe it must be in every church the body of christ but everything that speaks in tongues is not the body of christ heathens will speak in tongues demons will speak in tongues and christians speak in tongues real ones so but you can't identify everything you cannot identify the holy ghost by just that one thing you know like jesus and the pharisees they they loved jesus when he was healing the sick but when he began to bring the word when he began to bring the word of god and begin to say things like i and my father are one and other things like that like original sin or serpent seed a holy life and predestination and baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and one god the shock will mock that and then the shop pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god and i want to get that entire word of god not just one word every word man shall live by what every word life comes by believing every word the entire word of god and his fullness so what is our strength you know brother branham pondered this himself and he would say he would think you know uh well the fruits of the spirit you know you've got to have the fruits of the spirit by their fruits you will know them so he took galatians 5 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and it's true the holy spirit will bear these kind of fruits in your life but then he realized that these that some can do this naturally too some people just naturally are more loving than others more long-suffering than others more gentle than others and it's not the holy ghost it's just natural amen and then some religions like muhammad or even christian science can produce them and at times he you know the pharisees would seem to exhibit more of these fruits than what jesus did you know but but let me just say if you have the holy ghost you are going to have these fruits but just because you love everybody and you say i love god well you know you can love god and even wind up in hell because there's all kinds of types of love you can be loving him for the wrong reason amen you there again you can speak in tongues and have genuine holy ghost tongues and still wind up in hell because it's not the holy ghost it is his gift and there is a difference between the gift and the giver like i've explained before you know i can i can i can give the gift of my pen right here to my son timothy son i'm going to give you a gift did that come from me where did you get that from me hey man does it look like something that would come from me i usually have that kind of pen don't i and i've given it to you but do you have me what do you have my pen amen you see you don't have me you have my pen you have my gift and people get the gift a lot of times they will speak in tongues or they will shout or they will dance or or they will have an emotional and they were and that was the holy ghost that damn it but they didn't get him you see that that's that you said well brother tim you know people shouldn't fake it no we should never fake it but we ought to press in i mean we ought to do that with everything that we got we ought to press in when you're seeking god you seek him with your whole heart with everything within you well crying isn't the hell the holy ghost but the holy ghost will make you cry so i didn't in the holy ghost but it'll make yourself i mean tongues is not the holy ghost but it'll it will speak in tongues that's what the holy ghost does it'll make you love everybody but just because you're good in love everybody don't mean you're going to heaven you see you you are you will have these fruits there's a lot of people that has a lot of joy really joyous really happy and they don't have the holy ghost but they've got joy they got some of my peace and they really really have convinced themselves and they're peaceful but you see it's not much different from humans and dogs both have an air because an animal has a hair doesn't mean he's human man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that's why when we talk about being holy ghost field we are talking about a people who give the entire word preeminence not just a part some will give him preeminence till they speak in tongues but then they go and pop their hair off some will give him preeminence you know and get baptized in jesus name but then deny the holy ghost being an experience there's a there there's a lot will only go so far you see but but if we're going to live we're going to live by every word proceedeth out of the mouth of god you say brother tim i believe the message well believing the message is good but that can be just being able to read it so well that's sensible and i believe that because it's sensible you see but that's not the whole the evidence of the holy ghost but the holy ghost will believe the word amen now again you know jesus told us when he's on the earth he said believeth not this john 14 10. believe his thou not that i'm in the father and the father in me the words i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father dwelleth in me he doeth the works so this is the manifestation the perfect manifestation of god in the spirit was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and acts and works and this is what this is what we must understand you see when the bride gets back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that jesus did because it's the spirit of god and they're all one will produce what jesus produced our doctrine will be the same as his and we will begin to do and teach not just teach it but do it you see jesus said my doctrine isn't my own it's my father's we got to realize the doctrine that we believe is not our doctrine it is not william branham's doctrine it is a doctrine of god the doctrine of the bible now the word will always come to the spirit field you see this is evidence of being filled with the holy ghost that's what jesus said would be the the the evidence and john um he said he said i will pray the father he will send you another comforter that he may abide for with you forever even the spirit of truth so the holy ghost is the spirit of truth it cannot be in you and not lead you to truth he cannot deny himself so every word of the bible every word that god said in his word you're going to believe it if you've got the holy ghost you know the word is truth that's what truth is the word amen so a believer that is filled with the holy ghost what will they do believe every word of god they'll be able to say amen to every word now not the ridiculous thing of some people got that in their mind oh it's saying amen so to prove i i believe it pastor gets up good morning church nice to be here this morning amen amen hey man what are they doing that was trying to prove they had the holy ghost because they are going to say amen to every word it's not your verbal amen if not what you're saying with your mouth or with your jump it's the life that you are living you sisters that dress holy are living according saying amen to first corinthians 11. are you with me amen you brothers and sisters that have been baptized in the name of jesus christ you are saying amen to acts 2 38. you see you see the amen is now living in your life and you are agreeing with that word and you are obedient to that word and it's not just one thing we just what if i just do this one thing so pentecost wanted to do this one thing and that is we can just speak in tongues and we got it we got it we got it you know i can have assurance i i i draw my strength from that you see it's not one thing it is it is there's many things that makes up a human there's many qualities that goes with him amen you know again there is lots of description that makes not just one there are many that identifies you as being a christian amen now if there's something in the bible something in the word of god and you can't say amen with it then you wonder do you have the holy ghost if you see worldliness and sin and cutting hair and makeup coming out against the bible and i'm quoting brother branham now it's a direct evidence you don't have the holy ghost because he cannot deny his own word if you refuse to take on the name of jesus christ in baptism it is absolute assurance you do not have the spirit of god if you make our god into two lords three lords or trinitarian or whatever else and you turn them out from this one god bible it is identification you don't have the holy ghost now so you see why because the spirit of truth john 16 13 when the spirit of truth the word has come he will lead and guide you into all truth all the word and he'll not speak of himself but what he will ever hear of the of the word of god he shall speak and he will show you things to come so the spirit will actually bring words of prophecy so the evidence would be in the truth that you would be in the word for your age well i'm in the message brother tim i've got it no no just because you belong to the society of the church doesn't put you in the word your only way into the word into the body of christ is by a birth and that's an experience so you see again to receive the word the truth is to believe it and obey it so if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age amen as even every true christian down to the ages took the word for their age you also will do the same being one with the word proves whether you are of god and the spirit field there is no other criterion now so again again it isn't just i'm going to do one thing i'm going to speak in tongues and i got it or i'm gonna have love and if i love everybody i got it or if i if i if i wear this kind of uniform you understand a lot of people will come and become a part of the society of a church and they learn the uniform of a christian so i'm wearing the uniform of when i dress this way my hair is that way my dress is that way my you know i don't do this and i don't do that and you wear the uniform and you fit in and you look like one but your heart's got to be changed amen so you see the sign that we really believe and and receive the holy ghost says we believe all the word and that it manifests in the body of believers that we are worshiping with because in the body believers there's going to be these signs now all won't speak with tongues out of the five instances in the bible you know that where they received the holy ghost three of them they spoke in tongues one they actually spoke in tongues and prophesied two of them they didn't speak of speaking in tongues if tongues was the evidence god would have absolutely wrote it in the word you must pray until you speak in tongues to have the holy ghost this will be the initial evidence of receiving it would have to be written in the bible we got too much word here and too much silence on that there is no scriptural evidence that you got to speak in tongues to be filled with the holy ghost but the holy ghost does speak with tongues in fact to the latter of the times of receiving the holy ghost more times than not they spoke in tongues so rather than there being less prominent it ought to be more prominent because though these signs shall follow them that believe in other words in the group of believers in the church in the body of christ there's going to be tongues interpretation prophecy gifts of the spirit divine healing miracles all of that will be in the believers not one person doing all of that but it will be in the body now in the body these signs shall follow them to believe they shall speak with new tongues this is mark 16 to not speaking in tongues today to say we don't do that no more or that's just pentecostal so we don't do that that was for an age past that's not something we do today you see then you are denying mark 16. because jesus said this is going to be in my church they will speak with new tongues but paul comes along and says do we all speak with tongues to all have gifts of healing that we all prophesy the obvious answer to that is no but that's some unbelievers you see so so there again when paul was converted there was no tongues when down in samaria it was tongues wasn't mentioned but you see if tongues was the requirement and the initial evidence of the holy ghost wouldn't the bible say so it tells us plainly how to be baptized it tells us plainly that god is one not three it tells us plainly the doctrines of the scripture of predestination wouldn't it say in the bible you see if this was of the importance that the church but this became this became that strength of the organization so pentecost took speaking in tongues and denied the birth of the word the supernatural birth now it's the birth of the word in you now not intellectually agreeing with it or giving a mental assent is a life-changing power that makes you believe all the word of god amen you believe holiness because without it you'll not see the lord amen well brother tim we don't believe in the gift i don't know who we is because if you believe that you can't have the holy ghost we don't believe in speaking in tongues that's because you don't have the holy ghost you will we think hey you know healings and miracles are true but it's not the season for it because you don't have the holy ghost you see we we believe the seven seals or we don't believe that seven seals are open it's because the holy ghost isn't there we don't believe in preachers well your problem is you don't have the holy ghost you have to agree with the word amen if god put a fifo ministry in it show me where he took it out until you can show me where he took it out shut your mouth and believe it you see but man reason today well it's not the season or we're past that time are we going you see that is the spirit of the antichrist because why if he can get you off of one word you see israel came by reasoning and man's own human efforts to bring the word to pass without the supernatural and instead of the supernatural you know what this zusa bunch did just like abraham did you know when he took hagar and out of his own strength produced he took speaking in tongues a worked up emotion with manufactured tongues instead of waiting for the real manifestation of god our even taking the real gift of tongues and exalting it over the giver himself you have water baptism like we're going to have today if you was in an azusa church that would gather around you and cause jabber to come out of your mouth by saying screaming at you saying say it say it say it say glory glory glory glory say praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord say thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you they would scream those things at you and you would you by trying listen by works it's bomb's woman again it's not a spontaneous move of the holy ghost that's what happened on the day of pentecost the holy ghost fell and they spoke in tongues glorifying god now i've said i really don't care what language you speak in when you are baptized in the name of jesus christ and you see the holy ghost your life will glorify god it don't matter to me if it's in italian language or the japanese language or in the english language but your life will glorify god that's what the holy ghost will do to you it will cause you your whole life to glorify him now at this junction when the true manifestations are being made known to the people who have the work now we have been offered the breast to milk jedi else had i and we have the opportunity to receive the holy ghost as they did in the book of acts and when that happens men want to crucify it we won't have that nonsense in our church we don't want tongue speaking acts 2 38 youngins too many have listened to the serpent who has been looking for the secret of their power attempting to turn us into a powerless group of people listen we must not be a people who don't allow all the word to have preeminence you see somebody's going to believe it and it will work through them i'm talking about all the word not just part of it remember i started out saying even the true word parts of that word can be given to the bonds woman and it'll produce a life an ishmael but we don't want a bunch of wild children we want children that are obedient to the word the kind of the second adam are you with me now you see adam's pride believed every word every bit of the word but was confused on one promise and that he's the same yesterday today and forever don't get confused on that promise so when you look at anything in the bible you got to remember that he's the same yesterday today and forever if it's healing he's the same today as he was yesterday if it's baptism in his name it's the same as it was yesterday amen if it's speaking in tongues it's the same as it was yesterday if it's divine healing it's the same yesterday today and forever you see she got confused on one but one promise and and he said but she failed under the temptation of the enemy faced to face and now the people that has called for his name of course is his bride and she has to come in contact by the same thing not by denominational truth or something but every word so god brings us right back to where eve was [Music] and he denied one word of god and it caused all the sin to come now we're coming back where every bit of the word has been unsealed and there is a bride that's going to receive every bit of the word i said every bit of the word amen you see you say well brother tim uh he's the same yeah he's the same but in a way okay well let's have a prayer line well we don't believe in prayer lines well what happened to they to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that is to be among believers i'm going to say it if you don't believe in prayer lines you don't have the holy ghost amen plain and simple hey man you you got a bad disbelief from methodist belief you don't even have a good azusa belief you got something way back yonder under alexander campbell which is baptist candlelight's church of christ who says days of miracles are past amen again but but you see that's refusing to give christ preeminence and my brother donny reagan and his church are having a prayer line today it's probably still going on people coming around from all over the world you've been flying in from norway in different places coming for that prayer line i think that's wonderful i think that's what the bride ought to be doing amen i believe that amen i sent him a quote here you know just before this prayer line and brother branham was talking about the preachers he said you're gonna he said god anointed preachers he said i want to call them up there he said now brothers you're going to lay hands on the sick and he said it's going to be like an ark a.r.c and he said you know with your hands like that he said it reflects solomon's temple with the over saturn wings and there's a minister standing on this side of the line raise their hand and this side you're approaching the mercy seat where their healing is and you're passing under the wings of those angels the ministry of god earthly angels laying their hands on you and they shall recover hallelujah why wouldn't the pride believe in that amen sure she will she's got the holy ghost but if you refuse to give him preeminence it's refusing to give him voice how can you show his omnipotence and allow him to reign you see because it's refusing his commission laying hands on the sick and they shall recover oh well okay you know we we believe we believe he's the same brother tim okay let's have an altar call well we don't believe in altar calls well i don't know who we are but it ain't me amen we got too many stillborn babies amen who the voice of god is not living through and the only ones that the word can bring forth and screaming hollered blabbering acts 2 38 youngins tongue speaking youngins come on church amen so therefore you know we do believe in the altar calls because we still believe he's the same yesterday today and forever brother branham would preach leadership being led by the holy ghost 1965 i want to have an old-fashioned altar call they're out of date now but it's never out of date with god hallelujah let me tell you friends i believe in old-fashioned holy ghosts moving upon souls that cause them to find a place to pray and call out to god until their lives are changed you can't have the holy ghost to not believe in altar clause say it's a methodist tradition well i'll tell you what they did make a tradition out well in the bible it wasn't so well you say brother tim they were there in the house of the cornelius and while they heard the word the holiest fell upon them and how did they know because we heard them speak in tongues and prophesy something happened not just embracing a message and say well i believe god sent a prophet but something happened amen while the word was preached what happened something happened it fell upon the people see it didn't call an altar yes it did they had an altar right there in their heart right there in their home amen so well okay well we believe he's the same okay let's have our people get the holy ghost like they did on the day of pentecost well we don't believe in an experience like they had at pentecost we don't even want an atmosphere like that in our church what in the world have we come to when we don't want the atmosphere of the holy ghost in our church brother branham said god is able at this minute to speak every cancer out of this building to open every blinded eye to set everybody in the liberty and this and freedom and liberty god has provided ways made away sin his son jesus christ and the holy ghost is brooding over us today the holy ghost is all over is blessing us it brings us into an atmosphere why you can take a shin egg and put it under a brooder house and and the mother don't him don't have to be over the egg to hatch it just so some warmth is over it'll hatch it's talking about the incubator now what is the egg he's using the egg represents the promise so whether it's the promise of healing or the promise of the holy ghost somebody with me whatever the promise is you've got to get it in the right atmosphere amen then he anointed preachers and set it out now to bring the word to put the eggs in the right position place so what i'm doing when i preach is i'm trying to take the promises of the word get them in the right position and get the atmosphere of the holy ghost over because i know if the warmth of the spirit comes and broods over that word it's going to take life in somebody's heart and there's a change coming hallelujah there's healing coming amen there's salvation coming okay well let's have a next personal experience with god well we don't need an experience we got the holy ghost without knowing it nobody not one example in the bible ever got the holy ghost and didn't know it it is an absolute experience not a baptist mental ascent amen oh well let's pray for the sick well divine healings of mine are not a major oh so it's not important then why is it in the atonement it was important to god so important your healing it was so important to god that he took stripes for it so you could be healed amen he you see everywhere that jesus went he healed the sick and that jesus is the same come on then he has the same attitude toward the sick that he had them and it is a solemn obligation of every true preacher to pray and then bring the word to the dying and the needy people amen to get that promise in the atmosphere of the holy ghost so it'll happen well brother tim we're third full believers of the opening of the word okay well then the tenth vision which was the third pull had altar calls and prayer lines well we don't believe in a i make personal experience with god you see we're we're third pull we're we're we're we're word believers okay well in the vision people going in the little room in that third pulled vision they all had a personal experience with god every one of them did amen they everyone went into the presence of the pillar of fire well what about science following them to believe well we don't need signs today you see that was only to vindicate the message not to the messages come we don't need signs so you see the days of miracles are past them are you sure i just want to say to these candlelights you want to call me pentecostal what about you candlelights i'll do a little name calling what do you mean campbellites alexander campbell's formed from the baptist movement he formed the church of christ and their their main emphasis was we'll speak where the bible speaks in silent word silence so god doesn't do miracles today that was only for the church the early church in the apostle so you see i and i quote from brother branham said you say wait a minute i'm taught in the church of christ days of miracles has passed he says you got a devil that's right oh i belong to the church of christ like i said that was alexander's organization alexander campbell you can read about him he was uh in in the in the hundreds there he formed the what's called the christian church in churches of christ and and they say the days of miracles have passed he said they are false prophets yes i wanna tell you something everywhere brother branham went he had to defend divine healing gifts of the spirit the movement of the holy ghost everywhere and he was having to defend it against alexander campbell's movement they were one on the radio saying there's i'll give you a thousand dollars anybody can produce a miracle brother branham brings a a a testimony of a miracle and a doctor's deal and they say well that money ain't here it's up in the organization and they they have to prove it but i'll tell you take this little girl cut her hand and show me you can heal he said you devil said you're no different to them in the days of those devils in the days of jesus come off that cross and we'll believe you amen there are false prophets he said ask one of them people they think the holy ghost is for day why certainly not do you believe divine healing is certainly not then he's an unbeliever if the holy ghost is in you one he testified to his own word and if the spirit is in you testifies contrary to what the word is says it's true it is not the spirit of christ you see you've got to have the circumcision of the holy ghost that cuts that unbelief off of you and when you do then you can believe in divine healing why because you received it in your soul amen you know it changes from death to life amen so you see with the with some groups it became like i said saying amen to every word this we got the perfect word now brother tim and you see this was alexander campbell's argument his argument was we have the complete canon of the bible nothing can be added nothing can be taken from it so this is a complete word of god that which is perfect has come so anything in part is done away so you prophesy in part and you know in part and then you know and so tongues of cease and gifts of cease and guess what else these knowledge is cease so you're a bunch of dumb people now knowledge is ceased read the bible there's a lot of things when that that which is perfect is come then just having part is done away with about when you receive and embrace the true word you don't just have part of it tongues or believe in christ or or sprinkling baptism all of them are baptism but it's part of the word it's not all of the word is not the right word come on now when that which is perfect has come having part is done away with amen so now then when that which is perfect comes we have now the word in its fullness we don't just have part of it in this word we have tongues in this we have interpretation in this we have the power of god in this we have divine healing in this we have the baptism of the holy ghost in this the seven seals are revealed in this we know we're predestinated before the foundational world in this we know our name was ripped in glory before the foundation of the world in this we know we no longer have heart we have all of it well but don't you know that quote brother tim and question answer 64. you see we have the perfect word now and he said so jumping up and down like a kid and speaking his tongues is over with because we got the perfect word so jumping up and down like a kid speaking in tongues is over with that's not what he said what he said was jumping up and down like a kid trying to speak with toms is over we don't have to jumping down to get the holy ghost we don't have to jumping up and down like a kid and try to speak in tongues no that's over with in other words trying to impersonate and force tongues upon people is over with [Music] you see bringing a confusion of tongues is over with getting people to jabber and saying that's holy ghost tongues is over with now again question answers brother bradham said this he said now a lot of times i've seen many people accepting initial evidence speak in tongues as the holy ghost sometimes shake the people and beat them and pat them and say say it say it say it you know repeat a word over it say it say it say it it's something you're doing yourself and it's nothing you know what the problem said it's nothing they are putting their consolation and their eternal security on nothing on a self-work you might get a confusion of tongues you might get a lot of things in sensation but if anything comes outside of your own personal faith it has to be a divine gift of god given to you see don't don't you see that's not a spontaneous move of the holy ghost it's again works man by his own efforts makes himself have a confusion of tongues and works works man's efforts to save himself is what the bonds woman does now brother branham said in 64 he also says if the church would work in harmony like that that among us would be casting out devils taking up serpents drinking deadly things all kinds of things going on but when you force that to individuals then you get yourself that's pentecostal again speaking of azusa then you get babylon confusion but then he went on in that same block of words to say i wish every one of you spoke in tongues i sure do so if it's over with why does he wish we would do it and that's what paul said wouldn't he have to say what paul said paul said first corinthians 14 5 i would that you all spoke with tongues brother branham wished that every one of you would have the experience of speaking in tongues instead of 99 of message believers never having the experience he wished that every one of you had that experience and he said paul said i wish you all spoke with tongues but rather did you prophesy for greater is he that prophesied than he that speaketh with tongues so he said prophecy is greater tongues is the least of the gifts and pentecost made the least the most important that without it you couldn't have the holy ghost you couldn't get it you couldn't have it couldn't know you had it couldn't go to heaven unless you spoke in tongues they made that from the breast of denomination first corinthians 14 18 i thank my god that i've never spoke with tongues that sounds like a lot of message preachers today shame on you brothers i thank my god i spoke in tongues with more than you all i am grateful i am thankful i speak with tongues more than anybody yet in the church i would rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in unknown time so what if my whole sermon this morning would have been just standing here speaking in the tongue you couldn't understand what good would it have done to you what prophet would you get he said i would rather have five words in the church in the church amen i'd rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might be able to teach others but i speak with other tongues but it's more profitable for you that by my voice i preach to others in a known language than it would be for me to preach to speak ten thousand words in tongues so now did you know that in question answer 64 that brother branham actually encouraged people to pray until they spoke in tongues about speaking in tongues he said he spoke of a person a genuine person a real person and they lived right a person that was living right they're genuine a real person and they've heard me say the evidence of the holy ghost wasn't speaking tongues and it isn't but i advise that person to ask god to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy because it's the nature they needed he saw in them a need to have something supernatural happen to them to where they spoke in tongues and he says now i believe this now i do not believe speaking in tongues there's any evidence the holy ghost it isn't because i see witches wizards snake handlers devils everything else speaking thugs it's not an infallible act of god when you speak in tongues when that you got the holy ghost but remember the holy ghost does speak in tongues and the devil can impersonate it and the evide the evidence you've got the holy ghost is the life you live by the fruits you know them and the kind of fruits of the spirit not somewhere not uh is not nowhere in the scripture found speaking in tongues the fruit of spirits love joy faith long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience now that's the fruits now you find that on the tree to find what tree is and he said you ministers men are looking you preachers you deacons you trustees you're evangelists you could speak in tongues out on this street all day long they'd never believe you but what but you live what you're talking about you sow sweetness all the roots of bitterness out of you that men realize there's something about you speaking of tongues now i believe this again question answers this is 61 i believe this that sometime another that a spirit-filled person that lays under the altar of god will speak with tongues what brother branham said this i've seen many speak with tongues that never knew nothing about god they know nothing about him all and they still speak with tongues any gift can be impersonated but the fruit of the spirit proves what the spirit is on side you bear witness of the life of jesus christ because there are peach trees snapping the apple tree it'll bear peaches through the world see because the light that's in it but now let's not get away from that now let me just not get away from that now because i don't want to dishonor a great gift god has given i believe that a spirit-filled man or woman or child that lives under the altar of god won't live there long until they'll be speaking in tongues now i believe he will do it or she now you can receive the holy ghost maybe you didn't speak with tongues when you get it but if you constantly lay there before god all the time with baptism after baptism striking you something's going to take place you get so full someday till you can't talk nothing else see you try to say something you just can't say it no more you you just can't say it many times if people just realized that was the holy ghost the holy spirit they'd go ahead and just open up their heart and let god speak to them the bible said with stammering lips another tongue well i speak to these people isaiah 28 18 with stamina lips other tongues will i speak what what is stammer someone who can't talk plain brother brandon may illustrate someone's stammering you just you're stammering you're just saying so full of the spirit you say like i was going to say brother jack jack brother jack brother jack jack jack jackson and it's like that you're trying to say it but you can't say it's so filled with the spirit and he said i want you to ask the brothers have you ever felt the holy ghost shake you so bad until you couldn't hardly say nothing and you would sit quiet sometime and just sit there and cry somebody raised their hand you ever have that amen well he said that's the holy ghost and the reason people don't speak with tongues many times they don't know how to yield to the spirit they're looking something for something way off when it's right on them and then some people just get themselves worked up in a motion and say a bunch of words has no meaning and still ain't got the holy ghost trying to say they spoke with that they have it because they spoke with tongues by their fruits you shall know them so you see if you'll lay under the altar of god long enough what's the matter with a lot of message people they ain't never laid under the altar of god they let the holy ghost strike them time after time after time until it took over it shook them so bad he said they shake until they just sit there and cry and he'd say if you knew how to heal that if you just yield to it amen it would come out of you in another language because that's what god does it's a sign that follows believers believers do this oh we got the perfect word now so speaking in tongues is over well how could speaking in tongues be over that would mean mark 16 and the great commission is over that signs no follow no longer follow them that believe that we will speak with new tongues i say nice try satan nice try trying to slip in you're so afraid of being a zeus of pentecostal that you become candlelight baptist church of christ teaching's a denomination and teach that now we got the perfect word the entire complete canon of the bible so now the great commission is of march 16 the apostolic age is over and this was what brother branham was opposed over and over and over again even to the last of his ministry he's still defending the great commission and saying we have not achieved it and he tells us if the seals are open it's only to them people that can finish it so you don't just see we're right back where eve was at the beginning where the full word has been restored and now what are we going to do with it we must let the word go through us because we become the word when we let it flow through us nobody can become that word of concern and speaking in tongues until they let it flow through them nobody can become that of mark 16 of laying hands on the sick and they recovered till they let it flow through them it's got to flow through the journey and when it flows through then you become that word you see now that's what's happening instead of instead of receiving the whole word then we become guilty of accepting the word of a denomination a candlelight teaching a hybrid word that causes a short and blows a fuse how by quenching the spirit by despising prophecy by throwing a wet blanket on worship by saying the days of miracles are past because we're in another season now i'm calling him message preachers by the way by saying john 14 12 was only for brother branham by saying we got the word now and we don't need an experience and the the message community is exactly in laodicea and they are becoming as guilty of refusing christ's entrance as any of the denominations they're rejecting the word which is the evidence the holy ghost is not there to deny one word of this bible shows the holy ghost is not there amen but when you can get the current to flow right through it'll produce healing miracles signs wonders every promise of the bible amen a people who's gonna who is going to express christ in the fullness of his godhead do you see this is where shall shout out come i am almighty god i am the omnipotence of god i am god in all power i am all that he is and i am your shield and your exceeding great reward and i want you to show your mind by letting me circumcise your life cut the unbelief that is in this world off and start believing every word of god because when you have this seal that's the seal you're in my covenant i'm talking to a covenant people this morning a people of the covenant a people who if god is sworn to lifted his hand to heaven and said you know that that that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to swell remember he swore by him that liveth forever and ever amen that there'll be no more delay then i'll no longer hold this back i'm pouring out my fullness i'm giving you the complete word and there's somebody going to receive it and somebody's going to believe it i just happen to be one that's going to believe it all hallelujah are you that kind of people this morning well stand your feet this morning and say that's me god that's me i'm going to believe every promise of god it is mine it is mine it is mine every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse and every line amen i am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is mine do you believe it hallelujah how many would just say lord just let me get so in love with you then i can just have baptism after baptism until i'm so shaken by the spirit of god i speak in a heavenly language in the message the quickening power you know it is the rising of the sun that's brother branham told us he said may they speak with new tongues amen may they speak with tongues and new tongues and unknown tongues may they speak without you listen this is a new testament church i'll have everything god has i'll start lord just surrender myself to you let you work through me in your fullness amen amen we got a couple here that wants to be baptized today brother and sister mayo they come all the way from mobile and they want to be baptized in the name of jesus christ what is that song i wrote i got it wrote it's it's all in him see if you can find the words to that it's all in him the fullness of the godhead is all in him they put it in i want you to think of this because what we got today is the full word of god you cannot listen you cannot have the perfect word and some of it missing so what were you got the perfect word okay do you believe in you believe even in the least of the gifts well then you don't have a perfect word what do you believe in you don't have a perfect we are people who give the word preeminence the only way the holy ghost can ever come in your life is when you make a surrender this is a boy the people that would be circumcised they would do that very thing they would they would surrender themselves to have the secret parts of their lives the excess cutaway this is what the new birth entails is when you come to god and you let you let him come in the secret parts that thing that wants to hold on to a grudge that thing that holds on to this habit that thing that holds on to the world that thing that has the wrong desire surrender that him let him just cut it off that says you're mine you're separate people unto me you're separate people do you find words for that i'll put me up to words amen i'll preach forever it's all in him it's all in him the fullness of the godhead and it's all in him it's all in him it's all in here the mighty god is jesus and it's all in him it's all in him it's all in hell the fullness of the goddess is all

coming to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ what a privilege it is today to be able to represent the lord and to know that this uh this is so true you know i can only baptize with water but the one coming after me will baptize with the holy ghost and fire amen and that is the spirit giver and so we're here today to obey the lord and water baptism taken on the name of jesus this is part of our covenant with him that we we take on his name because we are his child and as his child we will walk as new creatures and creations in the in the newness of life so it's a joy today to be able to come and knowing this sister johnny has repented of her sins he's been serving the lord and she's been baptized but today she wants to you know sometimes it's uh the bible says that and peter said that baptism does now save us not in putting away the filth of the flesh but in the answer of a good conscience toward god and this is why our sister comes she wants to have that just nothing between my soul and the savior that's why her brother's coming he's one that just to declare i don't nothing no questions i don't know trouble at the river when it comes to crossing over i want to make sure everything is right so today we're we've come and we're going to obey the lord in water baptism and we're going to call on the name of the lord let me have your other hand right there right there as we just call on the name of the lord the bible said that it that he he that calls on the name of the lord shall be saved so therefore we call on the name of the lord we invoke his name when we pray and then we invoke his name when we are baptized because we are by baptism there in symbol taken on the lord jesus christ so we are identifying with him by baptism in his name so today as um we i prayed for our brother and our sister down at the altar a moment ago and they're here and they drove all this way i come through many many dangerous toils and snares to get here and even think we've waited along to this day just for them amen and so we're here now all together at this predestinated moment and today we we come to see that sin and unbelief is behind us to rise in the newness of life sister johnny you have asked the lord jesus to be your savior and to come into your heart and you've repented of your sins well the lord jesus sent me into all the world part of the great commission to preach the gospel and he commanded us and told us go to all the world and preach the gospel baptizing those that believe in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost in obedience to that divine word of god i baptize you sister johnny in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you lord praise the lord amen thank you jesus amen praise the lord amen thank you jesus amen

back home amen and he's come to me take on the name of the lord one more time and just make every every work perfect before god where there's nothing between my soul and my savior amen where he knows
