[0:13] [music]
[0:15] I won't be discouraged.
[0:18] Even when I'm discouraged, [singing]
[0:22] [music] I'll remind my soul [singing] of
[0:25] all you've done before.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[0:29] &gt;&gt; I won't be distracted [singing]
[0:33] even in the distraction.
[0:36] [music]
[0:37] I will trust the [singing] one who's
[0:39] greater than the storm. [music]
[0:44] Oh, I will [singing] trust the one who's
[0:47] [music] greater than the storm.
[0:53] I don't need another reason.
[0:57] I don't need more convincing.
[1:00] [music] The same God who made a way. The
[1:05] same God who's here today. [music] Even
[1:08] in my darkest room.
[1:12] This will be the truth [music] I'm
[1:14] holding.
[1:15] The same God [singing]
[1:17] who made a way is the same God who's
[1:21] here today. [singing]
[1:23] [music]
[1:28] I [music and singing] won't be shaking.
[1:31] Even when I'm shaking,
[1:35] having done [singing and music] all I
[1:37] can do, I still will stand.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; And I will [music] worship.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, I will worship. [music]
[1:50] I will face [singing] whatever comes
[1:53] right in hand.
[1:59] I don't need [music] another reason.
[2:03] I don't need more convincing.
[2:07] The same God who made [singing] a way.
[2:10] [music]
[2:10] The same God who's here today. Even in
[2:14] [singing] our darkest moment,
[2:18] this will be the truth. I'm holding.
[2:21] The same God who made [singing]
[2:24] way. The same God who's here [music]
[2:27] today.
[2:30] [singing]
[2:33] [music] We believe. We [singing] believe
[2:36] you, Lord.
[2:38] [music]
[2:43] If you're not done [singing] moving,
[2:45] [music]
[2:47] then I'm not done waiting.
[2:50] If you're not [singing and music] done
[2:52] working,
[2:54] then I'm not done praising.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; If you're not done moving,
[3:01] then I'm not done waiting. [singing]
[3:05] If you're not done working,
[3:08] then I'm not done praising.
[3:11] [singing]
[3:13] You're moving
[3:16] so I'm not done waiting. [music]
[3:19] I believe you're working. [singing]
[3:23] So I'm not done praising
[3:34] another [singing]
[3:34] reason.
[3:36] I [music] don't need more convincing.
[3:40] The same God who made
[3:42] [music and singing] a way. The same God
[3:44] who's here today. Even in our darkest
[3:48] [music] morning,
[3:50] this will be the truth I'm holding.
[3:53] [music] The same God who made the way.
[3:57] The same God [music] who's here

[4:02] reason.

[4:08] The same God made away. The same [music]
[4:12] God who's here today. Even in our

[4:53] same God is here. And there is no one
[4:57] higher, no [singing] one greater, no one
[5:00] [music] like our God. There is none more
[5:04] able. Christ our savior [singing]
[5:07] great and glorious. [music] There is no
