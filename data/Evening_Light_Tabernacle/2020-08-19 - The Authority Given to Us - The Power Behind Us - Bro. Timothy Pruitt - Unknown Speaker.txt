god may you just come and meet needs tonight father there's so many needs so many needs god we have great needs but thankfully we have a great god who can answer our needs we ask that the god of heaven would reach down and touch your suffering children lord suffering with cancer and suffering with various types of diseases and suffering chained by circumstances of sin and things lord in their lives father set your people free lord may they walk out of the bondage of the lord tonight father and lord as we get ready to move from this dimension into another dimension lord may our hearts turn towards you even more we pray father turn it away from this old vile world that we live in lord and the things of this world that just gets worse every day but god we're thankful this is not our home this is not our planning for our futures not here and living for this place is not in our hearts but god we're looking for a better land we're looking for a better place lord lord of the government lord will be a pure government lord a king that will be a pure king father with righteous judgments and lord the spirit of god to reign supreme and the people of god we thank you now father for these things lord that we have we just ask you to anoint it to our hearts lord help us to move out of the way we pray in jesus name amen and amen hallelujah let's turn to revelations 3 and verse 14. amen you know i i the things that are going on in the world can weigh heavily upon your heart and it i just wanted to say this it's not going to get any better it's going to get worse and as it goes off into the tribulation it's only going to take degrees of getting worse and but i i'm thankful that's not our hope but our hope is out of here leaving this old place behind and going to another place and but i just got some things because we know the natural types of spiritual we can see the natural where it is we know the the spiritual where it is amen because you know what we're dealing with today is not even a race issue it's a it's a spiritual issue amen because one day there'll be all the tongues the nations different races that'll be there living in perfect harmony and perfect peace why because the spirits have been dealt with amen so we want to look at these things revelations 3 and verse 14 these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god amen we'll let you be seated you know as we just was speaking this world we live in in the natural we're seeing things happen like never before we're seeing uh the attack coming against authority like never before and all attack out even all-out attack against our police force and wanting to defund them and strip them of their authority and you know in many places you can no longer say the whole city is even behind them or even the state is behind them or whatever you know brother branham would use the policeman many times in his it through through his messages about the authority and that's what i would like to speak tonight is on our god-given authority but you know he says we do not believe we have power we don't claim to have power we claim to have authority and he says we realize the little policeman on the street with his little cap sitting on his head the big cars sweeping down to the broadway's 90 miles an hour 300 horsepower engines in them he hasn't got one bit of power to stop one of them they would crush him amen he says but just let them let him show that badge and lift his hands and brakes will squeal and tires will hum it's the authority that stops them he said why because the whole city is behind him he's got authority not power he may not weigh a hundred pounds but he's got the authority to make them stop and so we see in this hour that we're living in i think it's very amazing that that you know that the devil or spirits are actually anointing people amen to come against the authority and the natural and and if he's doing that in the natural he's also going to try to do that in the supernatural and so you know we see an all-out assault to strip the authority of the enforcers of the law and so that that way the lawless can do as they please they can rape they can murder they can loot they can kill they can steal they can ride in streets they can destroy buildings they can destroy livelihoods of people and the political atmosphere we're living in has got the police to be in such a place that they're afraid to assert their authority or what they had because it has been stripped from them and so now that those out there those those men anointed by spirits they can tear down what monuments they want to they can graffiti them they can graffiti our streets they can write anything they want to on our buildings they can do what they please because they don't have any repercussions from it therefore the law no longer has any value to them because it has nothing to back it up and the devil is now trying as we said he said the natural types of spiritual so at the same time you see the devil is trying to strip the power of god out of the church he's trying to take the authority out of the church because if there is no power there is no authority amen because if there is no power there is no authority so why does he do that so he can come and go as he pleases him and to rob to pillage to destroy as he pleases you know he may be succeeding in the physical realms amen but he and and and creating his chaos of an eden and cities are folding up to the political pressures of the age that we're living in refusing to stand for what's right but he will not succeed in the spiritual realm because there's a heavenly government that is ruled by the king of kings and the lord of lords who will not back down off of his promises but will stand upon them to the end amen we see that there are people that have have stood up on laws they've stood up on things and they've stood for rights they've stood for things and all of a sudden all of that is being washed away governments no longer have the power that they once had they no longer have the backbone that they once had but you know and he's trying to bring that also into the spiritual realm into the church of the living god but there's still authority in the church backed by the power of god there's still authority in the church of the living god to tell cancer to take your hands off of god's property amen they may not have the authority to tell them not to burn a building or or not to root or not to do this or that but in the spiritual realm there is still a people upon this earth that has the backbone given to them by the holy ghost to stand upon the word of god and tell that devil you're not riding in these bodies you're not taking control of these situations this is not your possession this is not your problem property so you have no right here and you have to back off in the name of jesus christ and they have the authority given them by the power of the holy ghost this is there's authority in the bride to tell spirits of the enemy that they cannot come into our place they cannot come into our homes they cannot come into our churches they cannot come into our bodies amen there's an authority in the church of the living god to tell satan you cannot come any further there's a power to stop every sickness there's a power to stop every sin there's a power to stop every devil there's a power that's in the body of jesus christ to turn corruption into incorruption to turn mortality into immortality there is a power to break every chain hallelujah and the church of the living god is not backed by mortal men that one day believe this and the next day they believe that they're not backed by mortal men that don't have the backbone to stand for righteousness and stand for godliness we are not backed by man's creeds or man's ideas or man's laws we are backed by the holy ghost we are back by the name of jesus christ we're back by the things that god has done for us in this age the church of the living god is not backed by an earthly government hallelujah i'm thankful for that today amen your government believes one thing one day and believes another thing the next day amen it fails men every day amen it fails men left and right amen we are not backed by earthly governments that can be swayed by money or our popularity or politics but the church of the living god is backed by god himself hallelujah and every believer through the ages has been backed by him because he depicted himself as jesus standing in the middle of the candlesticks so tonight we're not standing up on our own our own our own beliefs we're not standing on what we think is right or what we think is wrong we're standing upon the word of almighty god we're not standing upon laws legislated by man some wednesday man it can be this one day and that the other day can stand for you in your face and shoot you in your back that's not who we're still we're back by i want you to understand and hide we're backed by the holy ghost and the holy ghost still defeats cancer and the holy ghost still defeats every sin and the holy ghost still raises the worst among us up to be a christian in this hour that's the power that's in the church of the living god hallelujah and i want you to understand this power is not diminishing hallelujah this power is not diminishing it's not going out it's not fading away it's getting stronger every day you say well all hell is against us well wonderful news when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose so if you see all hell around us believe you me all heaven is for us this is what he would say this is what's back even in our age he said this is what is back in you as we read in revelations 3 14 this is to our description for our age his description of himself for our age these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god my isn't that a wonderful description of himself the attributes of our lord and savior jesus christ these words amen just makes you want to shout because he's talking about himself in my age in the time that i'm living in he's faithful in the time i'm living in he's a true witness in the time i'm living in he's a final voice or a final say to my situation i don't know you the devil passed judgments on some of you a long time ago and said you'd nothing be it but to be a bar room flyer or some druggie on the streets that was his judgment but he didn't have the final say there was another voice that spoke that had authority and the power to back it up the power to break the chains off of you the power to take sin off of you the power to break every kind of spirit off of you amen that's the power i'm talking about that's in the church of the living god tonight and he's in our age that way he's a faithful witness he's a faithful god amen if he brings such a spirit of reality in your heart when you realize he's faithful and true he's the amen the beginning of the creation of god this is jesus giving us him a description of himself in relation to the time that you're living in the last age as the days of grace are winding up he has looked from the first century all the way down to the 20th and told us all things concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us he gives one final look to his own gracious and supreme deity this is the capstone revelation of himself listen to me children of god i am the amen i am the faithful and true witness i am the beginning of the creation of god thus saith thee amen jesus is the amen of god jesus isn't so let it be of god amen so you're not backed by some measly government made by man and we're under a government that was it was depicted to be a christian government that was it was wrote by christian people it's a far cry from that today because it's moved from its landmarks it's moved from its monuments it's moved from it but i'm talking about a government that won't move you can be in the worst trial of your life and he's still a faithful and true witness he's still the amen of god it says the devil is not going to have dominion over here you are my child hallelujah it stands for finality finality in other words when he says amen and he puts it to it that's all there is to it ain't nothing the devil can say about it hallelujah if he says you're healed you're healed if he says you're my son you're his son the devil can help how the devil can halt the devil can do whatever scream and holler he can do everything he wants to do he can make the symptoms gets worse he can do whatever he wants to it does not change anything the final voice has spoke on your behalf mercy it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promises it stands for unchoosed unchanging promises it stands a man stands for the seal of god that's why i love this message because the angel of god the angel of the lord would come behind every sermon and say amen hallelujah tell me another message that he did that too he would come you know if brother brown would make the challenge many times if i've told the truth he will come amen if what i've said is the truth let him come amen he would come and reveal the hearts as he did 2000 years ago as he did in the days of abraham hallelujah he would come what was he doing he was saying amen amen amen oh hallelujah you have a message today that's backed up by not my amen but the amen of god it stands for unchanging promises oh we got a change in government changing every day rapidly changing every day so rapidly that even the best lawyers can't keep up with the changes that are taking place changing every day going along a certain line going further and further away from god changing every day amen uh you know but we're we're we're not under that government sure as an american citizen but i'm not talking to you tonight as an american citizen i'm talking to you as a citizen of another kingdom hallelujah amen i believe that's how we ought to live our lives as a citizen of another kingdom amen that this world is not my home i'm just passing through amen they can do whatever they want to they can ride on the streets it's not my streets not my buildings it's not my it's just a temporary dwelling place one day it's going to be all mine one day it's going to be all yours and we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked but until that day let them have it well we are coming back to claim what is rightfully ours brother brown would tie this in with the old testament he would bring it to show that the god of the old testament is the jesus of the new and he read out isaiah 65 and 16 said that he that blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth brother i don't say that was really interpreted the god of the the god of the amen and i went and read it in the amplified version it says so it shall be that he who invokes a blessing on himself in the land shall do so by saying the god of truth the a man bless me hallelujah oh if the amen blesses you what does it matter what anything else does to you do you want you understand what blessing you are under tonight you're not on the blessing of some some feeble government well i have you to know the government's about to bless us with a with another check well who cares that's not the check or the approval that i'm looking forward to that's a money that won't be here in just a few days be gone but you're not under just a blessing of some earthly government you're under the blessing of the most high god and under that blessing who can curse you his cursing to be turned to blessings hallelujah may the god of truth the amen bless me and who taketh the oath in the land shall swear by the god of truth the amen the faith and faithfulness to his promises because the formal troubles are forgotten and because they are hidden from my eyes and this is what he would go on to say you can read that on down to verse 16 but to save a little time he said see the real translation is not just the god of truth it's the god of the amen amen and we should and we read it and we read it so blessed bless himself in the god of the amen he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of the amen because the formal troubles are forgotten because they're hid from my eyes he says it goes on he says hallelujah see here is the jehovah of the old testament the god of the amen here's jesus of the new testament the god of the amen hear o israel the lord thy god is one god there it is again the jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new hero israel the lord thy god is one god the old testament the new testament does not reveal another god it reveals a further revelation of the one and same god christ did not come to make himself known he didn't come to reveal the son he came to make the father known he never talked about two gods he talked about one god jesus is god he and the father is one there is one god in his name is the lord jesus christ he is the god of the amen and he said whatever you ask in my name i'll do it i'll put my amen on it he never changes well blessed be the name of the lord i don't know about you but i love serving a god that don't change his mind how terrible would it be that you got up this morning saved and the next day he told you you're lost well the next day you know i'm sorry i got you mixed up with somebody you're saved and one day he forgives you of your sins and the next day he said hey i i can't quite get over that when you're going to do some more repentance in other words he'd be human hello somebody but this god never changes therefore if he put his finality upon you is a man upon you he cannot change his mind if he said you're my child you are his child the devil can do what he wants the devil can try everything he's got but he don't have enough because god doesn't put the final voice upon you amen you're not under the voice of me of a mere man you're not under the regulation of a mere man this message is not the message of a mere man this message is not the message that was said of the great kentucky preacher it's not the my message it's a message of almighty god that is what we are under the amen he put his amen on you and what he does never changes what he says stands fast hallelujah he called us the true saiyans of god read that revelation we are the truth say these are the true saiyans of god who is he talking about you the spoken word of god in this time you're the true saiyans of god hallelujah what he says stands fast so he said you're the true saiyans of god god spoke you out you can't do nothing but win you will not fail you was not born to fail you was born to rise over everything i need you to understand tonight you even the weakest among you you wasn't born for depression you weren't born for anxiety that wasn't what was you was born for for it to rule over you you was born that you can rise above it you are the true saiyans of god what he says stands fast oh hallelujah and let me say this right now when there's no more cancer when there's no more anxiety when there's no more fear and there's no more alopecia and there's no more brain bleed there's no more high blood pressure there's no matter whatever kind of sickness you want to name no matter what kind of set sin you want to name when there's no more devil you shall remain hallelujah it's time you look the devil in the face and say boy when you're long gone i'm still going to be here because i am the true saiyans of god and i will remain he does it and it's done forever no one can take from what he says or add to it so let it be a man so let it be aren't you glad we serve that kind of god you know exactly where you are with him at any time at all times he's the amen of god and won't change these things saith amen it means that whatever he said is final you don't have to worry about him changing his mind tomorrow about a certain thing so if yeah if there's if there's a a way to dress when he first spoke it it still goes today there's a way to wear your hair when he first spoke it it still goes today it was a way of life that his first focus still goes today i know the world don't believe that but i want you to understand it's the world that changed not god he said well i'll tell you what these men hugging up with me and makes me sick dressing like women makes me sick well men dressing like women makes you sick how long has it been since you got sick at a moment dressed like a man same thing it's spirits but what happens over time i i get we get numb to it and you know laodicea is there as sandpaper shaving off convictions and shaving off all kinds of things and lukewarmness comes in all kinds and to where we get lukewarm to it don't even nauseate us no more hello somebody it don't even turn our stomach no more now all of a sudden something new comes in and it turns our stomach it won't be too long and it won't turn your stomach no more it's the lukewarmness is laodicea but what he said is finally it means that whatever he said in the first age or into the second ages to all the ages about his true church and about the false vine is exactly still right and it won't change it means that what he started out in genesis he will finish in revelation for he has to for he is the amen so let it be so we can see again why the devil hates revelation or genesis to revelations he hates the truth so these are not people that are hating the truth these are spirits that are in people that are hating the truth as i said we're not we're not facing race issues we're facing spiritual issues a spiritual warfare that's being poured out into human beings because when these spirits are done away with they'll be every race lived together in peace you know i want to tell some people i just seen some stuff on facebook it's a bunch of nonsense we got ministers joining up and making these things about it goes to take a survey about is there any racism in the message that's nonsense in this message a true believer there's no racism the problem is you got racism in your own heart get the holy ghost and it'll take care of it it'll make over it'll make overall put his arms around his tuxedo it'll make a white man hug a black man amen why it ain't a white or a black it's a brother it's my sister it's god's child the world wants to make it a black and white thing it's not what it's about it's a spiritual warfare and it's demons anointing the minds of men he hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail hallelujah he knows what his end will be how he fights that but we oh man you got your shouting shoes on anybody ready to just give a good old shout we are on the winning side is it a white side it's a black side no it's a god's side [Applause] is it a red side yellow side no it's a god's side hallelujah we he says i mean the believers of this word are on the amend side hallelujah i'm not on the american side i'm not on the japanese side i'm not on the european side that's not who i am i am on the amen side and the amen side i'm on the winning side i'm going to rise above every devil in hell and i'm looking at a people that's on the same side and they're rising above cancer and they're rising above sugar diabetes and they're rising to go above every spirit of sin it is the amen side what happened god said amen god said amen and it's over with on the amen side these things say the faithful and true witness so if you'd get on the amen side you wouldn't need your surveys these things say at the faithful and what is it why can't get off of it what it is you're joined up you've joined yourself with the political spirit a demonic spirit i want to show you what i find the thought of faithful oh my you want to hear about faithful your government not may not be faithful to you but this god is faithful you know he says how we talk about a great unchanging god whose words does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we get the view sometimes of him being very impersonal but he said as though god made the whole universe and the laws that pertain to it then stands back and becomes a great impersonal god it is though god made a way of salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross and then when the death of christ is atoned for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him god just folded his arms up and stood back it is if as if we majored in believing in a great creator who created and lost personal interest in his creation but he said i like i now say that is how too many people are apt to think but that's the wrong thinking for god is governing in the affairs of men right now hallelujah he's both creator and sustainer hallelujah colossians 1 16 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions principalities powers all things are created by him and for him and he is before him and by all by him all things consists he's a sovereign god by his own counsel he purposed the plan of salvation for his elect which he foreknew the son upon the cross to establish a means of salvation and the holy spirit carefully executes the will of the father he's working all things at this moment hello somebody he god hasn't lost control hallelujah he's working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he's right in the midst of it all [Music] he's allowed these demons to come to this place he's a great creator savior god faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great shepherd of his sheep his very existence is for his own maybe i say it like this his very existence is for you mercy he loves them and he cares for them his eye is always upon them when the word says your lives are hidden with christ and god it means exactly what it says he said i'm so glad that my god abides faithful he's true to himself and he won't lie he's a true to his word and he will back it up he's true to us he will lose not one of us whoa hallelujah won't you tell the devil god can't lose me god cannot lose me he will not lose none of us but he'll raise us up at the last day i'm glad i can rest in that kind of faithfulness amen philippians 1 6 has been confident of this very thing he that began the good work he's the beginning of the creation of god he that began the good work in you will perform it unto the day of jesus christ the day capital d a y unto eternity hello somebody he's not got to 2020 and said good luck enjoy yourself see you on the other side maybe no that ain't god that might be governments and that might be rulers of men earthly rulers of men but that's not god he's not somewhere on the porch drinking iced tea somewhere and having himself a vacation somewhere no he's ever on the job he's been watching over you every day of your life he's been watching over you when he drove to church he'll watch over you while you're in church he'll watch you while you leave church he'll watch you in your bed he'll watch you every moment of your life this god don't take his eye off his children he said my eyes are upon the various little sparrows little bitty birds that ain't hardly worth a few pennies and there's millions of them and god's got his eye on every one of them and he knows when one falls but if he knows when a little bird falls on the ground breaks his little wing or call has a little problem can't fly no more don't you think he knows his ultimate creation the human being the very form of himself he's got his eye on you and he knows when the devil comes and attacks you he knows when cancer is in your body he knows when he's coming and moving the mind battles you're having he knows all about it and he says i got the answer he is there to enforce he is there to tell satan no more he is there to tell satan give it back to restore it back to its rightful owner that's the age that we're living in one day satan held something over men and through the dark ages they only had a portion of the spirit but this day he can't hold it no more it's been restored back full power full vindication amen i've been listening to the restoration of the bride tree he speaks about restoration and bringing back the claim the claim that can be enforced to bring anything back to his rightful owner where it belongs now the police today may not be able to do that but the holy ghost can somewhere it went from its rightful owner and can wander around anywhere he said but to restore is to bring it back to who it really owns to almost and to bring it back to its natural state where it was in the first time or the beginning bring it back to its natural condition in order this we have a right to enforce if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition or restoration to restore now we've been talking about the power now we're going to talk about the authority amen he said if somebody stole some property and they've been holding your property capital captive and you take the go to the law and you go to this personal law will force or should enforce this person to restore this property back to its natural owner to its first estate enforcement he said oh he said we have the privilege you're a privileged people because you're living in a time to be privileged to force and force upon satan the claims that god gave you we are living in a moment that the power of the holy ghost is in the church again in full demonstration in power not a portion not a part but all of it and full power has been restored back into individuals hearts again as it was on the day of pentecost hallelujah he said god has a law and his word is the law and god is in his word made certain claims of the church told him you could have certain things and we have a right to force upon satan our god-given rights and say give it back hallelujah amen we heard a prophecy here amen just a couple of months ago almost almost a year ago now at our labor day meetings but ron speaking on take it back amen and the little girl had been bound by anxiety and fear amen almost didn't make the trip to the to the services because every time she'd get go go somewhere just fall upon her to where she'd almost become motionless and trying to figure out what to do and the mama says we're taking her because we're going to get her delivered we're going to take her because god is going to meet her there and god's going to deliver her this thing and god ordained a whole service called her out by name and we don't think god don't know who we are we don't believe he knows about our everyday struggles and our mind battles we've been going through and the spirits have been haunting at us and things has been happening he knows all about it you know he knows and he cares not only does he knows about it he cares about it and he cared enough to amen invite a whole a 7-800 people whatever it was to come to a meeting and a service i know many were delivered in this service but it was pinpointed to one person read your name in the scripture abigail what was it a son of god robed in the robe of the holy ghost adopted son of god preaching the word in his day and god coming down and saying amen and you saw a little girl get delivered and delivered today hallelujah why there was a power there when the voice was spoken authority went out there was a power that backed it up and it said yes satan you went far enough take your hands off of god's property she's free today why because of the power of almighty god hallelujah oh come on somebody and that power was not just for that meeting it's for tonight as well if somebody's willing to use the authority that's been given to them by the power of almighty god and say devil you come far enough i'm taking back what is mine i'm taking back my inheritance i'm done with you devil i heard wednesday night i can believe for the impossible therefore i'm gonna believe and god's gonna back me up the law of the land is to enforce the law of the spirit of god is to force satan to give listen this to give up what he has unrightfully and deceitfully taken from god oh my souls are men he took from god souls of women he took from god children sickness of the body he placed upon people god made them in his image to be like them and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the bible to take the holy spirit and enforce this upon them amen hallelujah hello somebody and he goes to tell a story happened in an event of a car that gotten stolen a car a car not a person not a child not a million dollars a car somebody stole it man's clothes and his wife closes in it they drove 1500 miles to be in service coming to the service before a poor fellow found himself without anything 700 something miles from his home didn't know what to do he turned it to the police they had a big racket in louisville when stealing cars and repainting them didn't have to have the title there to sell it so they'd make you a title in a few minutes any number you want to put on it so they're having a terrible time so we got down on our knees amen now jesus wouldn't have had to do that he was the word we're not the word the word of the lord came to the prophets we were they wasn't the word but the word came to them jesus is the word he didn't have to pray he was god but we are his servants his prophets his servants whom the word of the lord comes to and the prophet is vindicated by whether it's the word of the lord or not but what he says come to pass and then when we have scripture here that says whatever wherever two or more gathered in my name and if they agree i'll be in their midst if they will agree on touching any one certain thing and ask and don't doubt they shall have what they ask for it will be given to them there's the law this is not a man's law this is god's law the one that's here to enforce the law is not some man it's not some earthly government it's the holy spirit how about people he says some of them don't even believe in the holy spirit he said you're rejecting your own peace of mercy he said but we got on our knees about five of us brother fred saltom and many others there four or five men knelt down and i pleaded this case before god and i took the word of the promise and sent it forth and the great holy spirit as he took the word to serve the summons oh my goodness listen this spirit can go behind walls it don't have to have a door to be open and go through the door amen they don't have to have a warrant it can go all the way past all that stuff they don't need nothing dictated by the man's creeds or dogmas it ain't bound by those things any longer it's been loose from all those things it was bound for 2000 years but now it's been loosed therefore it can go where it wants to go it can set who it wants to be set free he can deliver who it wants to be set free he can restore who he wants to restore it's not bound by laws of the land or man's creeds or ideas or dogmas and he said the holy spirit fell into that car a thief not a christian a thief not even somebody may be raised right a thief and it served as summons on him had a yellow shirt on driving it holy spirit came upon him and began to condemn him he turned around about halfway he said i saw him come and park the car on a certain street over across the river i raised up and told the brethren thus saith the lord and when they started out they went down the road and they set the car they're half empty with gasoline he said just it's just enough to take him halfway to bowling green and bring him back these men are sitting here as a witness what was it enforcing give it back and god cared enough about a little car well don't you know if he cares about a car he cares about your body he cares about your children your god-given heritage he's not we're not talking about a car tonight we're talking about something that god gave you he gave you your healing sister erica he gave you your healing that's nothing but the devil that's trying to put something on you but there is a body standing here on the earth that is enforcing the law of god and say give it back hallelujah and give it back amen there's a spirit that's greater than cancer is there somebody here to witness that tonight there's a spirit here that's greater than cancer there's a spirit here than greater than any sin there's a spirit that's greater than any lukewarmness there's a spirit greater than any anxiety or fear any kind of thing the devil wants to put on the children of god there is someone in the building greater hallelujah and he's here to enforce your god-given rights amen there ought to be somebody with enough gupta that says devil give it back give me back my son give me back my daughter i am coming in the authority given to me by the name of jesus christ he says if he's afflicted you and made you sick you have the right before god to enforce the laws of god that's right praise the lord by his stripes i am healed bring it back turn it loose oh my instead of satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of god we have a right by the holy spirit to enforce the claims of god and say bring it back a man is sick bring it back a baby is sick bring it back a woman is sick bring it back they're out of their natural condition bring it back we have a right to enforce the claims of god given to us by the word of god it's our enableable rights as sons and daughters of kings there's laws there's a law of christ there's a law in man he said you can bury a man that's a christian you can bury him in the deepest grave you can bury him in the deepest sea or in the lowest hell there is a law the spirit of god that says i will raise him up again hallelujah oh mercy many of you some of you i don't know how many of you some of you had a lot of lives that you was running from the law worried about what the law was going to do what his next move was blue lights running things going on didn't know and the devil trying to put every kind of thing upon you think about it how much garbage did he pile on your life the best of us how much garbage did he put on your life he tried to cover you up with every kind of thing to make make you so undesirable unwanted to where god would maybe look at you and say ah i can't do nothing with that he tried everything he could do to put it all on you but there was some other law governed in here it wasn't the law of the united states of america it wasn't the law of some man-made creed it was the law of god that spoke before the world began said that's my son the devil can do what he wants to he can pile all the nonsense he wants on the sin he wants on things upon him put him in the lowest hell but my arm can go far enough there's no one not one of my sons not one of my daughters can go low enough that my arm can't reach down amen god broke every kind of sin off of your life every kind of spirit off your life amen what was it that was you was you thought that you was abiding by law or satan's curses or whatever and you thought that was your life but there was another voice that spoke there was another voice that said no i had first choice he's my son he was my son at the beginning and then no matter what you've done devil i'm going to raise him up again hallelujah let me go down i want to say something here brother brother david dexter shared this quote with me i just had to throw it in here talking about the uncertain sound men giving uncertain sounds maybe god don't heal no more deliver no more all kinds of things out there uncertain sounds yeah he said brother brattle he said brother i believe my church preaches the gospel so he said all right he said jesus said i'm going to give you a certain thing to believe you go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be down and said don't stop there preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe no uncertain sound there it's the gospel amen they cast out devils there was authority in their name in their in their walk there was authority that they had given to them by the name of jesus christ and then peter would come to the gate called beautiful he said i don't have silver and gold but such as i have give unto thee in the name of jesus christ get up and walk amen there was an authority given there he said the gospel said that's the tone that's the tone that's in the bell that's the tone of the bell when they're casting out devils hallelujah i love to hear that bell tone and a devil hit the floor lost his power he might have had power brother hell over you for years but there was a tone that sounded it was a bell boom what was the sound and devil you were about to lose you're about to lose a person you thought you had you tried to cover him up with this you tried to cover him up with that amen every one of us he tried to cover up but there was a tone in the bell the devil said i'm going to go out like i went out before and he put his own boxing gloves on and he went out but this time he wasn't meeting brother hell he wasn't meeting brother timothy he wouldn't meet none of you he was meeting the champion of champions the lord of lords ladies and gentlemen i'd like to present to you tonight the champion of champions hallelujah there ain't a sin in case he can't cure they're in a sickness he can't heal they ain't a person in this building he can't deliver i wish i had voice to preach tonight because this god is a champion [Applause] hallelujah he has come to show you tonight i will enforce the authority given to you you speak my word and i'll bring it to pass you say and say to this mountain be moved and watch it be flowed into the sea that's the tone of the bell there's a certain tone in that gospel you hear about bell tinkle and says there's no more altar call that's the wrong tone it says no more prayer lines wrong tone devils are laughing laughing at preachers won't give a sinner a chance to repent laughing at preachers won't give a person a chance to be delivered but i like a certain tone it's the tone of deliverance [Music] i like to hear the gospel speak and demons start screaming hello i don't like them laughing i like them screaming i like them running i like them fleeing i like a gospel that's got power in it that'll go up into a mezzanine and grab a little girl and say today's your day of deliverance i like a gospel that's got enough holy ghost in it that'll fall upon a young mother in a in the mezzanine seeding and anoint her heart and she run around the building and deliver of the cancer i like that kind of tone if you don't like that tone this gospel ain't for you but i like that tone i like the tone of devils screaming they screaming brothers means how come they can't scream and iron me why are they comfortable sitting on our pews why are they comfortable living in hearts we should be again in the days of ananias and fire where sin is called out what demons scream and run for their lies because there's a bride standing upon her feet she's heard the sound of a trumpet and the sound is moving in her heart and it's lifting her up [Applause] when that tone sounds they're sounding out all kind of gospels nowadays oh you just believe the message you're saved that's wrong tone just confess it'll be all right you fess brother brown is a prophet you're saved wrong tongue that's not the tone that this bible brings and this message rings the same tone as this bible now the interpretation of this message may not but this message rings the same time if it don't it ain't the message amen he says when when you put on that he says when you put on that helmet of salvation and that great shield the size of the door of faith brother is not what you are it's who you represent well you're just making yourself somebody no i'm not it's who i represent i'm with him it's who you represent our armor is jesus christ and when he sees that armor every devil slide their breaks and squeal hello they squeal when they see that full armor of god the true baptism of the holy ghost and that scene it coming straight from the throne of god dressed in the full armor of his resurrection not that you're strong you're nothing but it's what's behind you you're dead you joined the army you joined the police force you joined to keep the law and to control these devils hello control these devils you're on the police force and the whole kingdom of god is behind you you're nothing you can't stop anything but authority has been given to you because you're raised and setting in heavenly places in christ jesus and the devil will recognize that amen and every one of them will slide his brakes when that hand goes up he says no matter how little you are you say i'm just a little washed woman hey your brother don't maybe even hardly know his abc's don't make no difference it's not who you are it's who you in christ which makes you who you are and you will triumph over all things and your authority you don't hear what your authority is a couple of you yeah okay you want to hear what your authority is amen your authority is over every devil and every power that the devil has oh my god that's the authority that's been given to you brother james that's the authority that's been giving you levi that's the authority that's been giving you your sisters that's the authority that's been given to your mothers your authority is over every devil name that devil you have authority over and over every power that the devil has you're in christ triumphant hallelujah hallelujah oh my god there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down you say what are you talking about the grave is when you die i'm talking about any kind of grave you want to talk about there's more graves than the one that takes you down and dead there's plenty of people held by graves of anxiety and graves of depression and graves of cancer and graves of all kind of spirits but there ain't no grave going to hold this body down because this body is not the body of timothy pruitt and how's the spirit of just timothy pruitt it houses the lord jesus christ and the same power that broke the truth and the testile of the romans and it rolled that old stone away and out came that body the same power that's living on the inside of everyone that's got the holy ghost and ain't enough power in satan's kingdom to hold a child of god in a tomb it'll break every seal of satan it'll break every stall he can throw in front of you there's angels of god that are rolling away and you'll sit on the very thing to try to hold you in hallelujah that is the power that you have tonight that is the authority that you have tonight if i was you i rejoice right now i have authority in christ jesus it's not my power it's not my mind it is his amen it is his it is his and i rest upon his word
