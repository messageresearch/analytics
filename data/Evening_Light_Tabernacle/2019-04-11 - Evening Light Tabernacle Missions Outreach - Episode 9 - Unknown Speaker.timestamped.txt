[0:04] so good to have you today to be with us
[0:08] on this session is where the ministry
[0:10] team and evening like Tabernacle and
[0:14] here in Minden Louisiana we're happy
[0:16] that you joined with us hope that you'll
[0:18] invite your friends and family to join
[0:22] with us today and share in this
[0:25] discussion that we're having we were
[0:28] discussing about how that the gospel of
[0:33] Christ is the power of God and the
[0:35] salvation and it gives us the power to
[0:38] live and overcome in life so does it
[0:43] does a Bible having these thing to say
[0:45] that we have to remain sinners or that
[0:48] we can be victorious I'm saying what's
[0:50] the Bible actually teaches about that
[0:52] what Paul in Romans 6 says let not sin
[0:56] therefore reign in your mortal body that
[0:58] you should obey it in the lusts thereof
[1:00] neither UT your members as instruments
[1:02] of unrighteousness it goes on to say in
[1:05] verse 14 says for sin shall not have
[1:09] dominion over you so it shows that
[1:11] there's a power and you know I think in
[1:14] this world that we live in we we have so
[1:17] so many people that want to just say
[1:19] well you know I'm a Christian I'm a
[1:22] believer but I got this and I have this
[1:24] situation I have this little issue drugs
[1:29] whatever you know they allow that it
[1:32] kind of be like like we said last time a
[1:34] cop-out you know of but I believe that
[1:37] he didn't just come to save us
[1:39] in our sins they come to save us from
[1:42] our sins basil you go back to verse 1
[1:44] and Romans 6 there it says what shall we
[1:47] say then shall we continue in sin that
[1:49] grace may abound so we just keep sending
[1:52] that the grace of God so whoever our
[1:53] sins the Emperor sins and Paul
[1:55] pathetically says right behind it god
[1:58] forbid I should we have sure we that are
[2:00] dead in sin live any longer therein
[2:02] did to see this that's what we've been
[2:04] baptized into his baptism we raged with
[2:07] him in his resurrection we can't
[2:09] continue to live and see him because why
[2:11] because our desires and our natures have
[2:13] been changed that's what the whole new
[2:14] birth is about so old things have passed
[2:17] away all things all things become new
[2:20] when your creation and in being a new
[2:23] creation where a new genis are new
[2:26] species and we are born in the God life
[2:29] with the God species in verse 4 in
[2:31] Romans 6 it says there that we should
[2:33] walk in the newness of life amen so he's
[2:35] going through this whole rim of sin and
[2:37] the departure of sin and the newness of
[2:40] life and an overcoming victory as far as
[2:42] being reborn there's a newness that old
[2:46] life is dead amen
[2:47] you're not packing a dead corpse run
[2:49] with you the whole time it's a new life
[2:51] it's got life and it's got power in it
[2:53] that man's got to die for you to live
[2:55] victorious well do you have seven steps
[2:58] that you got to go through or some type
[3:00] of rehab in order to get this what's the
[3:04] deal there's a very simple prescription
[3:06] given on the day of Pentecost repent be
[3:10] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:11] Christ and you shall be filled with the
[3:14] Holy Spirit and with that comes the
[3:16] power to overcome all the things that
[3:18] used to bind you you know I don't think
[3:20] we should ever be guilty as those that
[3:23] have a form of godliness but denying you
[3:26] do that to me
[3:28] you get preeminence or you give power to
[3:30] the things of the enemy you say this
[3:32] thing of the enemy is more powerful than
[3:34] that then that Holy Spirit that I've
[3:36] accepted people that say well I'm born
[3:38] again but I still do this this and this
[3:40] what you're saying is that that life
[3:42] that Jesus Christ gave you isn't
[3:44] powerful enough to overcome those small
[3:47] hindrances of the devil and to me that's
[3:49] a slap in the face to the sacrifice that
[3:52] Jesus the price that he paid for us he
[3:55] didn't pay that price that we could
[3:56] continue in sin god forbid you bring a
[3:59] good point if we lived under the law
[4:01] then we very well may be defeated in our
[4:05] testimony right because the law didn't
[4:07] have the power to break nicotine to
[4:10] break alcohol to make sex spirits and it
[4:12] is ID 4 it would only condemn you
[4:15] but the blood of Jesus Christ when
[4:17] Christ died at Calvary he broke the
[4:21] backbone of Satan it's finished sin was
[4:24] absolutely finished at Calvary Satan has
[4:28] no rights the power of God destroyed
[4:30] every work of sin exam at that moment
[4:34] that day at Calvary crazily and then at
[4:36] the day of Pentecost when they received
[4:38] the life of God it was the very life of
[4:41] God the victory of God and the whole New
[4:44] Testament all the writers of the New
[4:46] Testament the scriptures that you're
[4:48] reading it all speaks over victory the
[4:51] victory over sin and power over sin and
[4:55] victorious lives so the Peter then that
[4:58] cursed and lied and denied Christ it was
[5:02] a changed man then babe at the Pentecost
[5:06] when the Holy Spirit came into him and
[5:08] he was filled with the Holy Ghost and
[5:10] brother Craig speaking about being under
[5:12] the law they were under the law there
[5:13] was under the blood of bulls and goats
[5:14] and you know that life and that lamb was
[5:17] slain it could not come back you know
[5:20] the life of a woolly lamb could not come
[5:22] back and the believers so that blood
[5:24] that blood would just cover the sin the
[5:26] man if it came in with lust he left with
[5:29] it he was forgiven there was a sacrifice
[5:31] that was but he still had it but I love
[5:34] a said about the power of Jesus him the
[5:36] blood of Jesus had broke the backbone
[5:38] and now we can see people we've all
[5:41] witnessed to the people that went
[5:43] through steps and programs trying to
[5:46] quit alcohol cigarettes
[5:47] chain-smoker generations of chain
[5:49] smokers in the just a moment in that
[5:53] presence well just gone I mean to say
[5:57] that I don't know what happened I don't
[5:59] even desire the not even desire not a
[6:02] desire matter of fact I even smell it in
[6:04] it is I mean it just total that's what
[6:06] the blood of Jesus because it's not a
[6:08] covering of the sin where that still had
[6:11] that you know whatever in your life but
[6:13] in knowledge and to me that's such a
[6:16] the church has done that is that they've
[6:19] turned the blood of Jesus Christ into a
[6:22] covering yeah I know where they treat it
[6:24] just like the blood of bulls and goats
[6:26] yes you're forgiven just as they were in
[6:28] the Old Testament but you still have
[6:30] that thing and you're still gonna fall
[6:32] to it and that's why you got to come
[6:34] back and ask forgiveness again and
[6:35] you're still gonna fall to it instead of
[6:37] the fact that the blood of Jesus is a
[6:39] bleach and when the sin is put in there
[6:42] it's done away with you can't find a
[6:44] trace of it it deals with the sin issue
[6:46] that's right
[6:47] see bleach has a power in it and it's
[6:50] the power of disassociation so you take
[6:53] a drop of ink and put it into a say a
[6:56] cup of bleach and in just a few seconds
[6:58] it's completely dissociated the contents
[7:01] and the elements of that ink is
[7:03] completely dissolved and it goes back to
[7:06] its natural first elements that it was
[7:09] actually originated from in the same way
[7:11] the power of the blood has it has the
[7:12] power to disassociate sin from our lives
[7:15] where we wants you to smoke or drink and
[7:17] desire to womanize or anything like that
[7:19] the power of the Holy Spirit the blood
[7:22] of Christ has a power to disassociate
[7:24] that and completely rewrite a man's life
[7:27] that Rick you know if you let they read
[7:28] about this bleach says no you not that
[7:31] unrighteousness shall not inherit the
[7:33] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[7:36] fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers
[7:38] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[7:41] with mankind nor thieves nor covetous
[7:43] nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[7:45] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[7:47] of God and such were some of you
[7:50] yeah but you're lost there you are there
[7:53] are sanctified you are justified in the
[7:56] name of our Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[7:58] of our God
[8:00] and I will watch there means loosed
[8:01] loose perfect loosening from the bondage
[8:05] of sin whatever form that it come in
[8:07] it's washed us loose does freedom race
[8:10] alone and look God didn't free you to
[8:12] put you back in bondage Dave man their
[8:14] love didn't come to free us to put us
[8:15] back in bondage to something else
[8:17] brother they're free obviously obviously
[8:19] they they experienced the power of the
[8:23] blood in that first church amen
[8:24] does he do it today does the blood still
[8:26] hold the same
[8:27] sulla de lejos is their testimonies like
[8:30] this so you always a Christian no sir
[8:32] were you always a Christian then it has
[8:34] to hold brother Tim were you always
[8:36] agree said we all came in this world as
[8:38] the Bible says in sin did my mother
[8:40] conceive me or iniquity so he came born
[8:43] in sin shapen in iniquity but two had to
[8:45] have something else they had to be a new
[8:48] birth when we were born not from our
[8:50] natural parents and their genetics that
[8:53] they handed down but we got born again
[8:54] of a new spirit his spirit so that those
[8:57] two metas can be transferred into us his
[9:00] desires become ours and the sins the
[9:03] desires of sin is no longer there the
[9:05] longer thought about because while
[9:07] because like you said the power of sin
[9:08] is broken off of a believers life and
[9:11] now his desires are to please God yes
[9:14] that's right his nature has been changed
[9:16] he's not the same rough nature that he
[9:18] was born with in its natural world
[9:20] his nature's been conformed to the image
[9:22] of Christ Dave ban him Paul would tell
[9:24] us be not conformed to this world but
[9:26] transformed and I think that's where the
[9:28] church is missing it they're not being
[9:30] transformed by the power of God strictly
[9:32] moment they're conforming to this well
[9:34] we can bring a nice rock band into the
[9:36] church and get all the kids there I've
[9:38] had many people tell me about my
[9:40] workplace they're marvel that our young
[9:42] people how dedicated they are to the
[9:44] Lord like what do you do at your church
[9:46] so we preach the gospel to work yes we
[9:50] don't have rock groups we don't have
[9:51] West Country country-western we don't
[9:53] have social gigs we don't have pizza
[9:55] parties and things like it we preach the
[9:57] gospel because gospel is has the power
[10:00] to say this gospel can't save a man who
[10:03] are we to try to save a man that's right
[10:06] takes the gospel it takes the blood it
[10:09] takes preaching Christ and him crucified
[10:11] that's right a new man but not only
[10:13] crucified rose and the rest are
[10:15] resurrected again they come again and
[10:17] said they don't that they have
[10:18] penetrated in or into man to give them
[10:21] that Jemison that nature of the Holy
[10:23] Ghost here so shall we continue in sin
[10:25] god forbid I know what it's done for me
[10:29] personally yes I mean I was 20 to 21
[10:31] years old when I met Christ I remember
[10:34] that night very vividly of me kneeling
[10:37] to sat beside my bed
[10:38] gone if you don't do something with this
[10:39] life I'm gonna take it because I don't
[10:42] have a desire to live anymore
[10:44] and would you believe it when I got up
[10:45] the next morning something happened a
[10:47] man I mean something notably happened my
[10:50] language completely changed overnight
[10:52] the words that would flow out of my
[10:54] mouth days and weeks and months prior to
[10:57] that or before that was all foul you
[10:59] know vulgar language but all suddenly
[11:01] begin to change it changed it
[11:03] immediately then things begin to fall
[11:04] and fall off and fall off that's the
[11:07] power of God amen
[11:09] and I'm taking the power is alive today
[11:11] to change a life you don't have to live
[11:14] in sin amen you can live above sin but
[11:17] there's only one way to live above seems
[11:19] and has to be born again in the spirit
[11:20] of a sermon I've experienced it I know
[11:22] it to be true I've met murders that have
[11:25] been converted by the power of God kill
[11:27] killers of more than eight people and
[11:30] I've I've seen drug addicts set free
[11:33] alcohol except homosexuals can be said
[11:36] exactly right people bound by depression
[11:39] and all manner of evil they don't have
[11:41] to live like that there is a power of
[11:43] God God can meet them in his power set
[11:47] them free and bring joy and live that's
[11:49] right and give them purpose for while
[11:52] they're here break the yoke of sin off
[11:54] of their life Dave Maass and I think
[11:57] Paul City you know so clearly of such
[11:59] for some of you that's that and every
[12:02] one of us you know were born in sin and
[12:06] had our experience in sin and so of such
[12:10] for some of you but you are lost but
[12:13] very simplified but you're cleanse by
[12:15] the side Jesus and what that blood is is
[12:19] the very blood life the Verte life of
[12:22] Christ comes into you and filled you
[12:25] with his spirit and that gives you that
[12:29] overcoming power
[12:30] amen amen it's it's a it is a must for
[12:34] yourselves today and factly agree if you
[12:39] if you're not living above seeing then
[12:41] something's wrong somewhere in your
[12:43] experience that's right
[12:44] and if your church is not preaching that
[12:47] you can live above seeing there's
[12:48] something wrong somewhere in that church
[12:50] yeah well you know today we make a lot
[12:54] of excuses you know even you know the
[12:58] ministers well um you go out and maybe
[13:02] live with a prostitute or be caught with
[13:05] a prostitute well you know what do you
[13:08] think they're just human well you see
[13:10] we're more than human when we're born
[13:13] again that's a person exactly in our
[13:15] first birth we were born human our
[13:18] second birth were born sons of God man
[13:21] and those who has us has a new birth who
[13:23] are truly born of the Holy Spirit they
[13:26] have the God life in them like I said
[13:29] you know one of our other sessions you
[13:32] know Jesus you know there was manifest
[13:37] in his life he had went away he sent
[13:39] back his own spirit because as the
[13:43] scripture says you don't have the the
[13:45] spirit of Jesus you're none of you
[13:47] exactly and the Spirit of Jesus came and
[13:50] now a hundred and twenty Jesus was there
[13:53] on the day of Pentecost sons of God who
[13:57] couldn't miss the powers of darkness and
[13:59] overcome and prevail well it's obvious
[14:02] by Paul's writings in the New Testament
[14:03] that the early church had this same
[14:06] revelation we're talking about exactly
[14:08] they didn't believe in walking in sins
[14:10] and claiming being saved they didn't
[14:12] they didn't believe that at all they
[14:14] believed in this but somewhere something
[14:17] began to change ever so slightly
[14:20] yes and so by the time that we arrived
[14:24] here today then we we have a powerless
[14:28] gospel you know there's no power to heal
[14:30] there's no power to deliver there's no
[14:33] power to say there's no power to live a
[14:35] clean life
[14:36] we have divorces and marriage and
[14:39] divorce and marriage and divorce all
[14:41] happen and in the Christian Church until
[14:44] they can't tell any difference between
[14:46] the church and the world right and
[14:49] that's what's a
[14:50] and it is sad why even to the point that
[14:53] we get homosexual ministers preaching
[14:56] the gospel right how do you preach the
[14:58] gospel when your life is full of scene
[15:01] the Bible said let him that name it the
[15:03] name of Christ depart from his iniquity
[15:05] I said the early church would not stand
[15:08] sin in the church they stood against it
[15:12] and and there there are many today that
[15:17] have substituted the the freedom of
[15:22] Christ the experience of Christ the full
[15:25] experience of Christ and they have tried
[15:28] to reform behavior they have they have
[15:31] substituted the power of God for
[15:33] counseling and psychology and taking
[15:37] different avenues that never can do what
[15:40] conversion can exactly never do it and I
[15:43] I just feel to say this while we're here
[15:45] that if there's someone listening in
[15:48] that you know that is hungry for God
[15:51] that to access this power you can access
[15:56] it right where you are a man through
[15:59] faith right and a lot of the time the
[16:01] problem is not the power of God a lack
[16:03] thereof it's the lack of faith in God's
[16:06] Word today no and there is an access I
[16:09] know by experience I wasn't saved in a
[16:12] church I was in my home right and I
[16:15] developed a hunger for God and I called
[16:17] upon him and he met me there and the
[16:19] Bible said all that call upon the name
[16:21] of the Lord shall be saved and you can
[16:24] access God right here and now and say
[16:28] God deliver me from this and reveal
[16:30] yourself to me and he will take you on
[16:33] from there and and I just want to say to
[16:35] those maybe the listening some maybe at
[16:38] their end or just feel like you know I'm
[16:40] so discouraged because I've gone from
[16:42] pillar to post church to church and I
[16:44] can't find that doesn't change the fact
[16:46] that God's truth still remains true
[16:49] today for every believer anyone that'll
[16:52] take him at his word that's right man
[16:53] that's right so today we found that
[16:56] churches have become a treatment center
[17:02] for sin and so they treat these symptoms
[17:06] of sin you know well you shouldn't
[17:08] commit adultery you know now you you
[17:11] should do this and reform your behavior
[17:13] and so churches have become a treatment
[17:17] center for sin and where they should be
[17:20] preaching and presenting a thin cure
[17:23] amen and that sin cure again is found in
[17:27] the tunel prescription where it was Acts
[17:30] chapter 2 verse 38 n every one of you
[17:34] and that means to turn from your sins
[17:36] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[17:39] Christ for the remission of sin and you
[17:43] know got to meet a sincere heart yes he
[17:46] says you shall receive the gift of the
[17:48] Holy Ghost and this promises to you is
[17:51] to your children it's to them that are
[17:53] far off no matter how far you've strayed
[17:55] away from God as you know as many as a
[17:59] lawyers oh they'll call said God's call
[18:01] in your heart there's a God to respond
[18:03] to you if there's a deep calling to the
[18:05] DDS there's a deep - hey man and in our
[18:08] next session we're gonna talk more about
[18:10] the church and how it fell away and and
[18:13] and how that today that there is the
[18:17] power of God unto salvation to bring the
[18:20] church back on the right track again
[18:22] because God will have a church without
[18:24] spot or Ebay bye god bless you till we
[18:26] meet again thank you for joining the
