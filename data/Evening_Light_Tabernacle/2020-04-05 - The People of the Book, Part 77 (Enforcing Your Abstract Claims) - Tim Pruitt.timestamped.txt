[35:54] we thank God for His goodness and His
[35:57] mercies His grace who want to thank you
[35:59] the team that has come out today to make
[36:01] this service possible and although you
[36:05] don't see the audience here I want you
[36:08] to know that's sitting on every one of
[36:10] these pubes or the angels of God that
[36:14] have gathered and he kept about us so we
[36:17] thank God for his presence today that he
[36:20] said I'll never leave you or forsake you
[36:23] amen I'd like to read from Ephesians
[36:25] chapter 6 and verse 10 and just reading
[36:32] in the Word of God today we're going to
[36:33] be speaking on the people of the book
[36:37] are as we are here in the land of the
[36:42] promise and here we are to enforce our
[36:45] abstract claims and that's what we're
[36:48] going to be speaking on this morning
[36:50] enforcing your abstract claims a man and
[36:55] here in the book of Ephesians it tells
[36:59] of this battle that we have vision six
[37:04] verse Tim finally my brethren be strong
[37:07] in the Lord and then the power of his
[37:09] might put on the whole armour of God
[37:12] that you may be able to stand what's
[37:15] this word stand against the wiles of the
[37:18] devil but we wrestle not against flesh
[37:21] and blood but against principalities
[37:23] against powers against the rulers of
[37:26] darkness of this world against spiritual
[37:29] wickedness in high places instantly
[37:32] interestly
[37:33] enough this word high places is the same
[37:36] word used earlier in the scripture in
[37:39] the visions one where he speaks of
[37:41] heavenly places so this is a battle of
[37:46] the heavenly realms
[37:47] and he says wherefore take unto you the
[37:51] whole armour of God that you may be able
[37:55] to withstand in the evil day and having
[37:58] done all to stand don't give up keep on
[38:03] standing stand therefore having your
[38:07] loins gird about with truth having on
[38:10] the breastplate of righteousness and
[38:13] your feet shod with the preparation of
[38:15] the gospel of peace and above all taking
[38:18] the shield of faith where would you
[38:21] shall be able to quench all the fiery
[38:23] darts of the wicked and take the helmet
[38:28] of salvation the sword of the Spirit
[38:31] which is the word of God and praying
[38:34] always with all prayer and supplication
[38:37] in the spirit and watching thereunto
[38:40] with all perseverance and supplication
[38:43] for All Saints may God bless you you can
[38:49] be seated and god bless you as you
[38:52] gathered today in and to honor the
[38:55] resurrection of the Lord Jesus and to to
[39:00] announce to the world that He is risen
[39:02] that he's not dead but he's a living God
[39:05] I want you to bear in mind a couple of
[39:07] scriptures that we have been using as a
[39:11] theme I won't read them this morning but
[39:14] as you know from Daniel chapter 12 were
[39:17] in that day so Michael stand up in a
[39:20] very troublesome time and deliver those
[39:24] whose names are written in the book and
[39:26] then also in Revelation chapter 12 and
[39:30] there's seven we won't read it but the
[39:33] war in heaven where Michael and his
[39:35] angels fought against the dragon and his
[39:38] and the dragon fought in his angels but
[39:42] they prevailed not and neither was their
[39:45] place what's these words again neither
[39:48] were there their place found any more in
[39:51] heaven so again the battle is a battle
[39:57] within the heavenly realm
[40:00] but ever since the fall of man heavenly
[40:03] battles became earthly battles and men
[40:06] and women such as yourself are our part
[40:10] of the soldiers in this battle if we
[40:13] were not going to fight then why was it
[40:15] that we were told for this fight to put
[40:18] on the whole armor of God to prepare
[40:20] yourself for battle now
[40:23] this seems kind of strange because we
[40:27] say well God has given us this land God
[40:30] has given us this promise of his word
[40:33] and he has restored it back to us and it
[40:36] is our inheritance so we would think
[40:39] automatically that it would be given to
[40:41] us on a silver platter that you know it
[40:44] just handed right over to it God gave it
[40:46] to us but that's not the way that it is
[40:49] you have to fight for every inch of it
[40:52] God give you a healing God gave you
[40:54] salvation God gives you deliverance but
[40:57] you have to fight to possess that to
[41:00] claim it for yourself if you find this
[41:04] with Israel God gave Israel a title to
[41:07] the land of Canaan but they would have
[41:09] to clear it of its inhabitants numbers
[41:13] 33 52 says then you shall drive out all
[41:16] the inhabitants of the land from before
[41:19] you and destroy all their pictures and
[41:21] destroy all their molten images and
[41:24] quite plucked down all their high places
[41:26] and ye shall dispossessed the
[41:29] inhabitants of the land and dwell
[41:31] therein for I have given you the lamb to
[41:35] possess it and you shall divide the land
[41:37] by lot for an inheritance among your
[41:40] family and to the more you shall give it
[41:43] the more inheritance and to the viewer
[41:45] you shall give it the less inheritance
[41:48] and every man's inheritance shall be in
[41:50] the place where his lot falleth
[41:52] according to the tribes of your father's
[41:55] ye shall inherit now canaan was a land
[42:01] that was that rightfully belong to
[42:05] Israel God had given it to Abraham and
[42:08] to his seed
[42:10] and yet there were squatters that were
[42:14] there illegally living there they were
[42:18] enjoying the benefits while of that land
[42:21] while Israel was down in Egypt in
[42:25] bondage living as slaves the milk and
[42:29] the honey the oil and the wine of the
[42:31] land was being enjoyed by those to whom
[42:36] it did not belong and fiercely today
[42:41] spirits of unbelief possess and insist
[42:45] on holding back God's promises from us
[42:48] as believers it isn't that God's
[42:51] promises isn't true it isn't that the
[42:53] land does not exist it is not that it
[42:57] doesn't have its milk and honey and it
[42:59] doesn't have its wonderful fruits and
[43:02] and grapes a cluster that is so big that
[43:07] two men in it it takes two men to pack
[43:10] it out and to show it to Israel of the
[43:14] of the fertility of that land and what
[43:18] it provides if you notice it would album
[43:21] it would have the figs and the
[43:24] pomegranate and the grapes it would have
[43:26] three fruits or the three pulls or the
[43:29] that would would be shown to us you know
[43:32] what it can do well wonder what is the
[43:36] power that lays in this land what what
[43:39] life given resources lay within it but
[43:44] of course it is possessed and this is
[43:47] what discouraged the children of Israel
[43:50] when they went over to take that land of
[43:53] promise that were discouraged by the
[43:55] report of the spies but you know we went
[43:58] there and they're stronger than us and
[44:00] and we're not able to take it and that
[44:04] brought back an evil report of we just
[44:07] can't do this and maybe the
[44:11] circumstances that you're looking at
[44:13] today and the problems that you're
[44:15] facing
[44:15] maybe puts a fear in your heart we just
[44:18] can't go through this
[44:19] we can't make it through it we can't
[44:22] possess this but I want you to day to be
[44:26] a Joshua and the Caleb and look at the
[44:30] promise of God and say we're more than
[44:33] able to take it it is our land and in
[44:36] our possession and and you know that we
[44:40] are able to take this possession that
[44:43] belongs to us
[44:44] but fiercely today spirits of unbelief
[44:48] possess and insist on holding back God's
[44:53] promise and maybe you're looking at a
[44:56] promise for healing and it seems like
[44:58] every demon of hell wants to camp on
[45:00] every scriptural promise their ears and
[45:03] laugh at you and mock you for your
[45:06] tenacity of trying to hold on to that
[45:09] word but I wanted to say to you hold on
[45:12] my child joy comes in the morning the
[45:16] battle is the Lord's man you may have
[45:20] run out of strength but God hasn't run
[45:22] out of strength and God is still God
[45:26] regardless of the circumstances that you
[45:29] are facing and today we battle against
[45:33] this unbelief even until now unbelief in
[45:37] doubts and fear all resist our
[45:40] possession of the land as we go out to
[45:44] fight I want you to never forget the
[45:47] awful price that Jesus paid so that we
[45:51] can have possession of every promise of
[45:54] this land I want you to remember that
[45:57] Calvary is not in vain
[45:59] where he was wounded for your
[46:01] transgressions and he was bruised for
[46:04] your iniquities and the chastisement of
[46:07] your peace fell upon him and with His
[46:09] stripes you were healed it was it was
[46:14] not for nothing that Jesus died
[46:17] paid the price of redemption but it was
[46:20] for you so that you could possess every
[46:24] promise of the atonement everything that
[46:28] Jesus paid for belongs to you and yet
[46:32] the battle rages now revelation 9 shows
[46:36] 200 million supernatural demons released
[46:40] and allowed to come to this battle as
[46:43] hell opens wide his mouth and I want to
[46:46] say don't be discouraged at this because
[46:50] when all of Pharaoh and his armies came
[46:52] against Israel it was for their hurt and
[46:55] for their destruction and not for the
[46:58] children of God just enough this distant
[47:02] not escaped gods and notice and neither
[47:04] was it something that wasn't in God's
[47:07] plan but way before the world began when
[47:10] he shaped the earth and he put the
[47:13] mountains and he put the sea he knew
[47:15] exactly he would bring his children
[47:17] right down here and it would be here he
[47:19] would trap Pharaoh and all his armies
[47:22] and bring deliverance to his children
[47:25] never forget never forget this God has
[47:30] got it whatever your problem is the
[47:33] battle rages but our God it's his battle
[47:37] and not yours so you see there is 200
[47:41] million supernatural demons that God has
[47:45] released and allowed to come to this
[47:47] battle because this is a day where hell
[47:51] will meet his defeat this is a day of a
[47:55] rapture where people are under an eagle
[47:58] anointing a man as we are under that
[48:02] anointing where miracles happen where
[48:05] you're snatched out of a situation in a
[48:08] moment one moment SiC another moment
[48:11] well at one moment in distress and
[48:14] problem and another
[48:16] woman snatched out of it one moment
[48:19] about to go down into the door of death
[48:22] and the next moment it snaps out of it
[48:24] just in the nick of time this is the way
[48:27] that to say eagle anointing works and I
[48:30] want you to remember you're under that
[48:32] anointing even your strength that feels
[48:36] so weak this morning they shall mount up
[48:39] with wings as an eagle they will run and
[48:44] not be weary they shall walk and they
[48:47] shall not face wait on the Lord this
[48:51] morning expect him to come on your own
[48:53] to you for your need sir revelation 9
[48:59] shows 200 million supernatural demons I
[49:03] wonder what God looks at it if he
[49:06] doesn't just say that the devil is that
[49:08] all you got you know the Satan's Eden
[49:15] and now I've even a special permission
[49:18] for you to bring in a reserve to call up
[49:23] your reserve that have been waited for
[49:25] this time and now you've got not just
[49:29] the demons you've been fighting with and
[49:31] well and had in your army for all this
[49:34] but now you have reinforcements of 200
[49:37] million more but you don't got enough
[49:42] because I want you to know we are not
[49:44] the only ones in this battle the word
[49:48] preached and his fullness has liberated
[49:51] the Holy Spirit that was not allowed to
[49:53] work down to the ages because of
[49:57] man-made denominational spirits
[49:59] you see denominational Church world with
[50:03] its Creed's and man-made dogmas has
[50:05] bound and sequestered the Holy Ghost
[50:08] down through the dark ages and even
[50:11] through bitter persecution where they
[50:13] killed out believers trying to stop out
[50:15] the true faith and to keep the Holy
[50:17] Spirit from working in the church
[50:19] because of man
[50:21] systems during these past two thousand
[50:25] years and they continue fighting against
[50:28] the holy spirit unto this day but I want
[50:31] you to know the time is up
[50:33] because now the Holy Spirit has found
[50:36] somebody a people of God in this last
[50:39] day who he can work through a man
[50:42] Michael whose name means who is like
[50:45] Jehovah the angel of his presence it
[50:48] should stand up to deliver God's people
[50:51] those whose names are written in this
[50:54] book and then again in Revelation 12
[50:57] fighting against Lucifer and his army I
[51:00] want you to know war has been declared a
[51:03] man in the heavens war has been declared
[51:06] this war is to the bitter end and in
[51:10] this war there will be a bride go up and
[51:13] Satan will be cast down there will be a
[51:17] people moved back into the position
[51:19] where Adam fell from a trade that's
[51:22] kings and priests a man and rule and
[51:25] reign over every disease and every
[51:27] affliction you think cancer is something
[51:29] you say this disease that is coming
[51:32] there is something let me tell you we're
[51:35] not just looking for just for divine
[51:37] healing we're looking for it total from
[51:42] the top of your head to the sole of your
[51:44] feet changed in a moment in a twinkling
[51:47] of an eye it's the eagle and nineteen
[51:53] teased now as I said war has been
[52:00] declared I want you as I preach Sunday
[52:05] about the unseen realms and the angels I
[52:09] want you to realize Michael has called
[52:13] all his hosts together a man just as
[52:17] Satan has gathered all of his and we're
[52:20] right here at the final battle war has
[52:24] been declared and it's time for Adams
[52:28] race to return to their position that
[52:31] was once held in God's presence
[52:34] brother branham would tell us this in
[52:37] the Feast of the trumpets he says that
[52:40] church and let me decide with its creeds
[52:43] and dogmas of man and unbelief has bound
[52:46] the Holy Ghost for nearly two thousand
[52:49] years and it did it by martyrdom back
[52:53] there under the church ages he's been
[52:56] bound not as a river Euphrates but at
[52:59] the door of creeds and dogmas and he
[53:03] said that the Holy Spirit can't work in
[53:05] the church because of manmade systems
[53:08] but she's going to be liberated she's
[53:11] coming back that's what the Bible said
[53:14] so brother Branham is telling us that
[53:16] even as there has been a liberation of
[53:19] spirits that God has held back until
[53:23] this time and would not let move and
[53:26] operate until until it would bring on a
[53:29] tribulation time here they are now come
[53:32] and streaming right into this dimension
[53:34] and here as the battle begins to raise
[53:39] he said so as the Holy Spirit been held
[53:43] back at the doors of creeds and dogmas
[53:47] unbelief has held it back remember
[53:49] Sunday sermon unbelief was holding it
[53:53] back unbelief held Jesus back from doing
[53:56] many mighty work miracles but with Jesus
[53:58] found faith when Jesus found somebody
[54:02] that would believe
[54:04] when Jesus found that there was a group
[54:07] of people who who started believing him
[54:10] it was there Jesus can unleash the power
[54:14] of God and I want you to know as his
[54:17] bride has begun to believe a man the
[54:21] power is being released so don't look
[54:25] for less power look for more power and
[54:27] man because for you the doors of creeds
[54:32] and dogmas have been moved down
[54:35] obliterated man the Holy Spirit is free
[54:39] to do what the Bible said to heal the
[54:42] sick to raise the dead to cast out
[54:44] in his name it is
[54:48] liberated for the purpose of meeting
[54:51] those 200 million demons that has been
[54:55] released so God in the in time sends a
[54:59] message that will remove the shackles of
[55:03] she creeds and dogmas and unbelief a man
[55:07] so people can start believing again now
[55:11] so it's liberated to meet the spirits
[55:14] and he says and those to meet one
[55:18] another on the battlegrounds Lucifer and
[55:21] Michael again like in the beginning
[55:24] they've been bound for two thousand
[55:27] years almost almost two thousand years
[55:29] of Holy Spirit has been bound by these
[55:32] denominational rivers for near almost
[55:35] two thousand years but it's to be loosed
[55:38] in the evening time by the evening time
[55:41] message the Holy Spirit back in the
[55:44] church again Christ himself revealed in
[55:47] human flesh in the evening time he said
[55:51] it and he promised it hallelujah
[55:55] hey man so therefore the Holy Spirit is
[55:58] back in the church again the evening
[56:01] time message brings the Holy Spirit back
[56:06] in the church the life not just the
[56:09] tongue not just an emotion but the life
[56:12] with the faith back in the church again
[56:16] indeed the Holy Spirit is released to do
[56:19] battle against these millions of demons
[56:22] and then we hear them going through the
[56:25] country right now we see a manifested in
[56:28] an insidious disease that is going on to
[56:31] the land as a striking fear chaos in our
[56:36] world today but I want you to notice
[56:39] here this the Holy Spirit is also
[56:43] released to do battle against these
[56:46] millions of demons a man for you said
[56:49] the Holy Spirit can't work in the church
[56:51] because of manmade
[56:54] systems you see man-made systems
[56:56] formulas policies to do away with the
[57:00] baptism of the holy ghost with the real
[57:03] precious in filling of the Spirit
[57:06] worried has been substitute with either
[57:09] easy believe ism or emotionalism man but
[57:13] now and now again we have access to the
[57:17] real true genuine Holy Ghost that
[57:20] literally for Jesus Christ back in the
[57:23] believer again a man soon so again it
[57:27] formulas and policies to do away with
[57:29] prayer lines and altar calls and divine
[57:33] healings and speaking in tongues and
[57:35] gifts of the Spirit and the supernatural
[57:38] workings of cloth but we have been done
[57:41] liberated from them we have thrown off
[57:44] their yoke hallelujah yeah I know down
[57:48] to the ages
[57:50] they bound the church the this kind of
[57:53] unbelieving theology this faithless
[57:56] preaching made Goliath really brave and
[58:00] made the church really weak brother
[58:05] branham found this to me true when he
[58:06] began to preach Jesus Christ is the same
[58:09] yesterday today and forever it is true
[58:13] when the church has forgot how to cast
[58:16] out Devils that this is their Commission
[58:21] everywhere they go they are to cast out
[58:24] Devils Amanda castle out devil brings
[58:29] salvation in the Flex room and in the
[58:32] sphere around and man casting out Devils
[58:35] they you know again the church has
[58:38] forgotten about how to cast out Devils
[58:41] instead they're telling you how to live
[58:44] with Devils you have to live with your
[58:47] problems you have to live with your
[58:49] habits you have to learn to live with
[58:52] with your temper and and learn
[58:55] live with your gambling problem or your
[58:59] sins or you have to learn to live with
[59:02] them I'm telling you friend let me tell
[59:04] you
[59:04] the church has forgot that they are to
[59:08] cast those Devils out we're not to live
[59:11] with them and man we are to walk three
[59:14] of them the same is true for divine
[59:17] healing we we're told well you know if
[59:19] it be the will of God if it be the will
[59:21] nothing here is the will of God a man
[59:27] here is the will of God he's already
[59:28] told in his will he told the church what
[59:31] to do when somebody comes to the altar
[59:37] and seeking salvation do we say if it be
[59:39] God's will you'll be saying no we say it
[59:42] is God's will for you to be saved and
[59:44] man you can receive the Holy Ghost all
[59:47] you need to do is repent and accept that
[59:50] is your own man when it comes to divine
[59:52] healing we have to do the same thing
[59:54] instead of say if it be thy will god
[59:56] what a dishonoured thing after Jesus
[59:59] showed his will
[1:00:00] I will shoot up prosper in health I want
[1:00:06] you to be healed
[1:00:07] I got Laurie to take on human battles to
[1:00:11] pay for your for your sins and your
[1:00:13] sickness if it be thy will my goodness
[1:00:18] how many how many different ways does he
[1:00:21] have to show us his will his whole
[1:00:23] ministry was showing his attitude toward
[1:00:25] the sick and the lost ministry Jesus
[1:00:29] ministry of William Branham which
[1:00:31] displayed again the ministry of Jesus
[1:00:33] Christ shoot his attitude about sickness
[1:00:35] and sin right a man but again the church
[1:00:40] has forgot its commission that you are
[1:00:44] commissioned to cast Satan out until
[1:00:50] they know nothing about being a
[1:00:52] spiritual church they called himself a
[1:00:56] word Church and that becomes a phrase oh
[1:00:59] we're where where the word where the
[1:01:01] word you don't call himself a word
[1:01:04] Church but they're just a theological
[1:01:07] Church
[1:01:08] for that know nothing about using a
[1:01:11] two-edged sword a word Church let me
[1:01:14] tell you about a word Church a to church
[1:01:17] here your prophet says and if the church
[1:01:21] is the true church it will have the same
[1:01:24] spirit the very same spirit and the word
[1:01:27] and acts of power that they had at
[1:01:29] Pentecost by experience it will be a
[1:01:33] Pentecostal church and there will be
[1:01:35] tons and interpretation and prophecy and
[1:01:38] healers and God will be in the midst of
[1:01:41] her and God will declare himself in the
[1:01:44] midst of her as he always has hallelujah
[1:01:49] now that's a word church but they see in
[1:01:53] even when brother Branham went out
[1:01:56] commissioned by an angel even in the
[1:01:58] early days before the angelic visit when
[1:02:02] he went when he went to pray for his
[1:02:05] little sister Georgia Carter looking for
[1:02:08] that lamb that was in the caught up in
[1:02:12] the brambles of unbelief down in the
[1:02:14] wilderness and he you know he would have
[1:02:19] to deal with church theology the
[1:02:24] persecution was not coming from the
[1:02:27] government per se and the World Council
[1:02:30] of Churches but was that it communica
[1:02:33] thinking that we're all the same and and
[1:02:36] you know we just have a philosophy today
[1:02:39] and and anyway we're doing and don't did
[1:02:43] disturb our people by by telling them
[1:02:47] they need a real experience with God and
[1:02:50] the divine healing is real and for today
[1:02:53] you know there's let us set where we're
[1:02:55] at no don't don't make us move out of
[1:02:58] our comfort zone I wonder how the church
[1:03:01] got comfort or becoming comfortable
[1:03:03] anyway they're sitting in a place where
[1:03:06] miracles were passed where there was no
[1:03:09] healing where there was no deliverance
[1:03:13] they said there the whole church the
[1:03:16] standing defeated because some demons
[1:03:20] some Goliath
[1:03:22] was crying out the days that miracles
[1:03:24] are past but it didn't work when David a
[1:03:28] man of gods come up that little stooped
[1:03:30] stooped shoulder ruddy lookin boy but
[1:03:33] God was with him
[1:03:34] he had an experienced man his brethren
[1:03:39] the clergy
[1:03:40] you know said get back to your seat
[1:03:43] dates of miracles of past your naughty
[1:03:46] boy you know where wonder where did you
[1:03:48] get your education if you delay if you
[1:03:51] listen to us you know we can't defeat
[1:03:53] this Goliath we got to find some way to
[1:03:56] reason with him and you know get him to
[1:03:58] go back and maybe we'll be slaves or
[1:04:01] what have you you know the boy but you
[1:04:07] know David could stand here and I'm
[1:04:09] talking about the messenger and this day
[1:04:11] the prophet of God he could say but I've
[1:04:14] met an angel and the glides he said you
[1:04:18] meet with a sword in the shield and with
[1:04:21] science and education with your theology
[1:04:24] and but I meet you with a commission
[1:04:26] given by an angel hey man you don't Saul
[1:04:31] Saul tried to give him an honorary
[1:04:33] degree of some armor and and things like
[1:04:36] that but he said they don't fit me I
[1:04:38] don't know anything about your theology
[1:04:40] and besides that your theology is never
[1:04:43] defeat a glide yet whether you're
[1:04:47] wearing it are wearing it what it won't
[1:04:49] defeat Goliath there's only one thing
[1:04:51] that will defeat him I'm coming in the
[1:04:53] name of the Lord
[1:04:54] I'm coming because I am a circumcised
[1:04:58] child of God that is under a covenant of
[1:05:02] God that covenant i can stand there with
[1:05:07] an axe axe in my feet is cleared and my
[1:05:10] sins are cold my sacrifice has been
[1:05:13] offered and accepted and I am God's I am
[1:05:17] the seed of Abraham and today Wow let's
[1:05:21] Giants head off
[1:05:24] I am anointed for this job how many of
[1:05:30] you out there were just saying that
[1:05:32] that's the the Prophet would say the
[1:05:34] bride is in doing it one of this day how
[1:05:37] many would declare I am anointed I am
[1:05:41] The Anointed of the Lord a man and I'm
[1:05:45] going to slay this giant that says the
[1:05:49] days of miracles are past there's got
[1:05:51] his mouth on the churches everywhere now
[1:05:54] like David of old he couldn't slay all
[1:05:56] the Philistines but he can kill that
[1:05:59] boaster out there man Goliath and when
[1:06:03] Goliath was slain while all of Israel
[1:06:05] took courage and away they went and and
[1:06:08] they beat the Philistines plumb back to
[1:06:10] their gates and he says what we need
[1:06:13] today is somebody with an experience
[1:06:16] like David who will stand up and say you
[1:06:20] mean to tell me that you let men and
[1:06:22] people rise up and tell you the days of
[1:06:25] miracles has passed and that Jesus blood
[1:06:28] dried up 1,900 years ago and you and all
[1:06:32] we need to do is join the church well
[1:06:35] why in the world would we change the
[1:06:37] gospel of power into a powerless
[1:06:40] religion the church world has done that
[1:06:44] bivalent god from the people by covering
[1:06:48] its crease with wood trees are its trees
[1:06:51] truth with reeds of men they've tried to
[1:06:54] put God behind a veil of trees and hide
[1:06:59] him and say we got all of God here
[1:07:02] Matthew 28:13 2313 says but what would
[1:07:07] you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for
[1:07:10] you set up the Kingdom of Heaven against
[1:07:13] men but you neither go in yourselves and
[1:07:16] neither suffer ye them that are going
[1:07:18] that are Internet to go in so he said
[1:07:22] this is what religious systems are doing
[1:07:24] they're setting up the kingdom of heaven
[1:07:28] and they will go in themselves and
[1:07:31] neither will they allow anybody else to
[1:07:33] go in
[1:07:34] but I want you to understand friend the
[1:07:38] job of the message was to restore the
[1:07:41] power of the Holy Ghost back to the
[1:07:43] church again to bring back a God of
[1:07:47] miracles a God of healing the god of
[1:07:50] delivers a God of true salvation that's
[1:07:54] what this message is about the job of
[1:07:57] the seven messenger is to unveil that
[1:08:01] God hey man the mighty God unveiled
[1:08:06] before us the unveiling of God we've
[1:08:10] heard of those sermons we ought to look
[1:08:13] at him in a new light
[1:08:15] and the veil was turned off or torn off
[1:08:19] and the mighty God was unveiled before
[1:08:23] us but unfortunately what's happened is
[1:08:27] like what happened with there with the
[1:08:30] Jews after the temple veil was ripped
[1:08:32] away when Jesus was crucified they they
[1:08:36] just put up another you know again this
[1:08:40] is this is the problem you know as soon
[1:08:43] as God moves a veil here the the people
[1:08:48] want to put up another and it's the same
[1:08:53] old devil just just new excuses you know
[1:08:57] we can't do that that was brother
[1:08:59] branham's job we can't do that we can't
[1:09:03] all angels can't be present today and
[1:09:06] pillar of fire is not for us and and the
[1:09:09] Holy Ghost doesn't move like he used to
[1:09:11] oh you know we got the word now or Oh
[1:09:14] friends if it's the word work where's
[1:09:16] the power that goes with the word hey
[1:09:20] mom there has to be a vindication to
[1:09:22] that word so well it's already been
[1:09:24] vindicated yeah it was in Jesus time and
[1:09:27] it was again in our time but again it's
[1:09:30] gotta be manifested in your own mouth in
[1:09:33] the unveiling of God brother Branham
[1:09:36] says the word has had a veil over at all
[1:09:39] these years to the people it can't be
[1:09:44] done and this is where
[1:09:47] we come again because no sooner than God
[1:09:51] will pulled the veil down men just put
[1:09:54] up another and it's amazing it's amazing
[1:09:58] how many criticized william branham for
[1:10:02] seeing an angel oh yeah and he would
[1:10:06] have to defend that because they said
[1:10:08] all that was only for the Old Testament
[1:10:10] in the New Testament we got the Holy
[1:10:12] Ghost and so we don't have Angelica
[1:10:15] visitations well Jesus was strengthened
[1:10:17] by Angelus
[1:10:18] Peter was delivered by one a man a real
[1:10:23] angel that stepped out of a light and
[1:10:26] took the bands off of him and opened up
[1:10:28] the doors and then we think we're living
[1:10:31] in a great time where we just you know
[1:10:34] our sins to be in there by a sinner and
[1:10:37] it opens the doors for us Peter had one
[1:10:40] of them one day invisible hands opened
[1:10:43] the doors and he walks right out of jail
[1:10:46] hey man you know he you know he was
[1:10:50] straightened he was treated and then
[1:10:52] delivered Paul had visitations by an
[1:10:56] angel judge on the leper Revelator
[1:10:59] talked to one can you imagine having to
[1:11:02] defend angelic visitations and man but
[1:11:09] it comes around today we can fit two
[1:11:11] years now away or so
[1:11:13] well angels are present anymore and God
[1:11:17] doesn't speak and year you can hear the
[1:11:19] good voice of God oh that was only for
[1:11:22] the prophet or some other things days of
[1:11:24] miracles are passed and oh we got the
[1:11:27] word today
[1:11:27] same old Church of Christ and the Christ
[1:11:30] spirit that moves again that says oh
[1:11:33] that was just the framework now we got
[1:11:36] what's real we've you got what's real
[1:11:38] then friends we ought to have everything
[1:11:40] in it brother Branham would say he's in
[1:11:44] Velen of God you remember the sermon I
[1:11:46] preached the morning when I left the
[1:11:49] first time about David and Goliath and
[1:11:51] David I said look out there to
[1:11:53] challenger say in the days of miracles
[1:11:55] is past what some tapes as it come down
[1:11:59] and watch each one how its come in more
[1:12:02] planar and planar if you have ears to
[1:12:04] hear and I see eyes to see what their
[1:12:08] stands that great I said that their
[1:12:10] stands at great ecclesiastical world out
[1:12:13] there that's InDesign to be gauged that
[1:12:16] it cannot be done but I said but God in
[1:12:21] that life boy was ever taken
[1:12:23] but once never been was taken then it
[1:12:26] was on the Ohio River there her down on
[1:12:29] the river there where they never took
[1:12:31] the picture of it he said they II told
[1:12:33] me it would be done he would make a call
[1:12:36] and it would sweep the nation no to
[1:12:39] reminds you what it said as john the
[1:12:42] baptist was sent to forerun the first
[1:12:46] coming of christ you're sent with a
[1:12:48] message to forerun the second coming of
[1:12:51] Christ man and that that was again spoke
[1:12:55] at the Ohio River it would be spoken of
[1:12:57] again and again and the Pentecostal
[1:13:00] circles as men and women would stand up
[1:13:02] and prophesy speak in other tongues not
[1:13:05] knowing it was said and say it again God
[1:13:13] has sent us Elijah the Prophet God has
[1:13:17] sent us a message in this last day God
[1:13:20] has sent us a restoration and what that
[1:13:23] restoration was to do was to turn our
[1:13:27] hearts back to the faith turn us back to
[1:13:30] believe it again then he said and even
[1:13:36] the dr. Davis that was as Baptist pastor
[1:13:38] said you were the grammar school
[1:13:40] education passin to the seventh grade
[1:13:43] we'll be praying for kings and monarchs
[1:13:45] and we'll start a revival then to sweep
[1:13:47] the nation's and he said I said that's
[1:13:49] what he said and it's been done see it's
[1:13:53] been done that's the thing he don't need
[1:13:55] no interpretation he's done it he's
[1:13:57] already done it that interprets ourself
[1:14:00] see calling his elected see from all
[1:14:03] walks of life and now it's made manifest
[1:14:05] so so again you know as he starts out
[1:14:09] you think he starts out and
[1:14:12] body receives him he starts on there's
[1:14:14] opposition among do you think we're
[1:14:18] standing in this last day without
[1:14:19] opposition
[1:14:21] there's even more opposition 200 more
[1:14:25] million supernatural demons coming
[1:14:29] against us trying to battle war against
[1:14:33] us in our minds coming with every kind
[1:14:35] of news and education and scientific
[1:14:38] knowledge and ideas a man against the
[1:14:41] Word of God and yet when God would
[1:14:47] unveil it and rip the veil at Calvary
[1:14:51] Israel just put up another one and when
[1:14:56] God would unveil himself in this day and
[1:14:59] show he still has the same attitude and
[1:15:01] does the same thing
[1:15:02] what does men dude just put up another
[1:15:04] veil now the old say in the days of
[1:15:09] miracles has passed the walls have
[1:15:12] turned torn down
[1:15:13] Jehovah still stands at full view
[1:15:16] manifesting his word unveiled one that's
[1:15:20] right notice the Gentile Church has been
[1:15:23] blinded from the from the veil after
[1:15:26] it's been torn off and shown God the
[1:15:28] ecclesiastical veil how by veiling the
[1:15:31] word in a human being again so again it
[1:15:36] was it was an ecclesiastical pressure
[1:15:38] and in ecclesiastical veil and we're
[1:15:43] looking we're looking at and many people
[1:15:46] are saying well you see it is a
[1:15:48] persecution against the church now
[1:15:49] because it won't let us meet together
[1:15:51] well that's funny when you read in the
[1:15:55] West plain news and there missourian in
[1:15:58] the in the flu epidemic or pandemic back
[1:16:02] in the 1800 or 1918 rather and then a
[1:16:06] terrible Spanish flu come through the
[1:16:08] country to kill millions and the mayor
[1:16:11] puts that in the paper no assembly and
[1:16:14] anywhere churches are to be closed
[1:16:16] schools that are closed that businesses
[1:16:19] are closed everything is closed and we
[1:16:21] as we try to to quell this virus that is
[1:16:26] going through but did the same thing
[1:16:29] newspaper clips under seen from from
[1:16:32] from British Columbia saying the same
[1:16:34] thing we were shutting down everything
[1:16:37] trying to quell this virus that is going
[1:16:40] to the land what the religious
[1:16:43] persecution now is not what now I'm but
[1:16:48] where it is is it's still against this
[1:16:51] bride in an ecclesiastical manner of the
[1:16:55] days of miracles are past we don't need
[1:16:59] to move of God we don't need the Holy
[1:17:02] Ghost hey man oh my brother Brennan said
[1:17:08] what we need today is a good
[1:17:10] old-fashioned st. Paul's revival and the
[1:17:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost like it found
[1:17:16] on the day of Pentecost to bring the
[1:17:18] people back to a living faith in God
[1:17:21] again that's exactly said I believe in
[1:17:24] confessions to raise up and accept Jesus
[1:17:26] Christ that's good see Billy Graham was
[1:17:28] doing that I believe in all of that but
[1:17:30] friends we need something more than that
[1:17:33] and I'll tell you you've got to realize
[1:17:36] today we need something more than I just
[1:17:38] be the message I believe God sent a
[1:17:41] prophet
[1:17:42] we need an experience to go along with
[1:17:45] that not just a head knowledge a
[1:17:47] sympathetic agreement that it's true you
[1:17:51] know
[1:17:52] well we know that God did it but the
[1:17:55] days of miracles is past not for David
[1:17:58] he was anointed he knew where he was at
[1:18:02] positionally The Devil's doesn't said
[1:18:05] the days of miracles have passed and
[1:18:07] gotten to the preachers and preached
[1:18:10] that all through the country notice
[1:18:12] known as we said the devil moved and he
[1:18:15] moved into the preachers I wonder if we
[1:18:18] can't see his movement he moves into the
[1:18:21] preachers and holiness isn't preached
[1:18:23] anymore he moves into the preacher and
[1:18:28] we just self-serve the gospel you
[1:18:33] just a pleasant way of everything's
[1:18:36] gonna be alright you know again
[1:18:40] again where where is the cry going out
[1:18:43] right now
[1:18:44] repent flee to God and then went to the
[1:18:49] horns of the altar I'm gonna pray that
[1:18:52] it ain't too late where is the cry that
[1:18:57] is going out across America come back
[1:19:01] get your priorities right what are the
[1:19:05] real essentials what do you really need
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:12] the devil's done said the days of
[1:19:15] miracles is past got into all the
[1:19:17] preachers and preached that through the
[1:19:19] country but arrows have been David not
[1:19:21] long ago a man got his head chopped off
[1:19:23] I'm telling you what the Israelites
[1:19:26] armies of beating it now from not to
[1:19:28] west east to south and I'm just saying
[1:19:31] friends if you're a follower of this
[1:19:33] message you got a sword you're beaten
[1:19:35] not into me any man who's saying the
[1:19:38] days of miracles is past right now we
[1:19:40] need miracles right now we need divine
[1:19:43] healing right now we need some real
[1:19:46] altar calls right now we need some
[1:19:49] people filled with the Holy Ghost the
[1:19:51] power of God moving the church right now
[1:19:53] we need it more than ever so what is the
[1:19:59] intellectualism going to do for you now
[1:20:04] what good is had knowledge going to do
[1:20:08] for you now I'll guarantee you now there
[1:20:13] are many ways the altar had never been
[1:20:16] put in the basement and the people knew
[1:20:20] how to pray I guarantee you now you wish
[1:20:24] that faith had been preached and not so
[1:20:27] much intellectualism and had knowledge
[1:20:30] I've guarantee you right now in a moment
[1:20:34] like this when we're facing this demon
[1:20:37] that is threaten humanity divine healing
[1:20:40] all of a sudden isn't a minor anymore
[1:20:45] I'm out and let me just say this divine
[1:20:49] healing never was a minor now III know I
[1:20:56] know right now yeah just to your your
[1:20:58] typing on your quote deals and you're
[1:21:00] gonna prove me wrong on that it was only
[1:21:03] minor when it was compared to the need
[1:21:07] of salvation of the soul but it isn't
[1:21:10] truly a minor this is a dual atonement
[1:21:14] and divine healing is equally important
[1:21:18] I remember he was wounded for our
[1:21:22] transgressions and by His stripes we
[1:21:25] were healed a man so and if there is no
[1:21:28] divine healing there is no resurrection
[1:21:33] I'm out so you see it's not that much of
[1:21:37] a minor is it but even if it is
[1:21:41] considered minor how can you say you've
[1:21:44] got the word and you don't have it
[1:21:46] included how can you have a perfect word
[1:21:50] I mean know nothing about divine even in
[1:21:59] the message fellowship brother Brennan
[1:22:02] said notice if we have that and that was
[1:22:04] included a Redemption we've got to have
[1:22:06] divine healing for the earnest of our
[1:22:09] complete deliverance if there is no
[1:22:12] divine healing there's no resurrection
[1:22:14] of the Dead how about that teacher if
[1:22:17] there's no divine healing there's no
[1:22:19] resurrection divine healing is the
[1:22:21] earnest of the resurrection if the Holy
[1:22:25] Spirit is here that's the earnest of our
[1:22:27] eternal life you know the Bible said the
[1:22:30] Holy Ghost is your down payment your
[1:22:34] deposit a man it's the earnest of your
[1:22:38] inheritance it ain't all of it is the
[1:22:41] support taste right well you know that
[1:22:45] that again is is the Holy Ghost is is
[1:22:48] the foretaste of our complete redemption
[1:22:52] but again it's a deposit but if the Holy
[1:22:56] Spirit
[1:22:56] is the earnest there what about the
[1:22:59] change of our body then divine healing
[1:23:01] is the earnest of our change if we
[1:23:05] brother madam would say often if I can't
[1:23:07] get you to believe even then divine
[1:23:10] healing how am I gonna believe get you
[1:23:13] to believe for a rapture now if that
[1:23:20] doesn't mean well if you're sick new you
[1:23:23] die well you just didn't have the faith
[1:23:25] for a rapture that's not what that means
[1:23:26] that what he means is if I can't even
[1:23:29] get the church to just simply believe
[1:23:31] for the healing of their body how am I
[1:23:34] going to get them to believe for a
[1:23:35] complete transformation from from ashes
[1:23:38] and a spoonful of dirt to becoming a man
[1:23:42] back again how I'm not gonna get you to
[1:23:45] believe in a resurrection I'm not gonna
[1:23:47] get you to believe in and the body cheat
[1:23:48] how am I gonna get you to believe in the
[1:23:50] translation if I can't get you to even
[1:23:52] believe it divine healer listen the
[1:24:01] reason God included divine healing how
[1:24:05] could you take it out of the gospel when
[1:24:08] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:24:10] and with His stripes were healed the
[1:24:12] same birth from the same man on the same
[1:24:16] day one for salvation one for healing to
[1:24:20] deny one is to deny the other and
[1:24:23] they've just turned it around today in
[1:24:25] the days of Jesus healing here in the
[1:24:27] physical bodies that we know he can heal
[1:24:30] but he makes herself God by forgiving
[1:24:32] sins and but now today the same he's all
[1:24:35] right he can forgive sin but he can't
[1:24:38] heal but he says praise be to God he can
[1:24:41] do both I'm a witness and so are there
[1:24:44] many millions around the world to a man
[1:24:48] but now he would tell us just before he
[1:24:50] left our faith isn't ripe
[1:24:54] intellectually we're hearing the message
[1:24:57] that God has given us and I wonder when
[1:25:02] it's time for us to stop just hearing it
[1:25:05] intellectually and get in the presence
[1:25:08] of God to our faith is
[1:25:11] this is an hour to use that faith I'm an
[1:25:16] amateur faith a faith that is ripe then
[1:25:20] that is ready to meet the challenge of
[1:25:23] the hour we're facing a crisis in the
[1:25:26] world and people who know their God will
[1:25:30] do X voice a man o brother Adam would
[1:25:36] tell us about his leaving from the home
[1:25:38] church going out on the mission field
[1:25:41] he says I'm thinking about another
[1:25:43] Sunday morning when I was leaving the
[1:25:46] tabernacle and you people were weeping
[1:25:47] and asking me not to go but when I
[1:25:51] preached on David and Goliath and how
[1:25:54] are you going to face that cold
[1:25:55] indifferent world that says the days of
[1:25:59] miracles are past I said if there's one
[1:26:02] big time there's one big giant and as
[1:26:05] soon as we can slay him the recive will
[1:26:08] take courage I'm still drawing courage
[1:26:12] from that a mountain I can look back
[1:26:15] here at lately I've been going through
[1:26:18] some of the prayer lines that is sermon
[1:26:20] just hearing some of the things that
[1:26:22] have been said and I have been going
[1:26:24] through the supernatural books and
[1:26:27] looking at these things over again you
[1:26:29] know why because we need a supernatural
[1:26:31] God I know some of you are searching for
[1:26:35] plagues and searching for our God for
[1:26:38] depression and searching for financial
[1:26:41] troubles and all of this you know what's
[1:26:44] happening is their play we're not in the
[1:26:47] tribulation but we are in a day of
[1:26:52] trouble and what I'm searching the
[1:26:56] message for is can I be found with that
[1:26:58] faith somebody gotta believe this word
[1:27:03] in this crisis each day I pray for you
[1:27:11] God put a wall about your people protect
[1:27:16] them yet we hear beloved brothers and
[1:27:19] sisters who are sick with this virus I
[1:27:21] still believe there's a wall of fire
[1:27:24] I still believe there's a god of
[1:27:27] deliverance God deliver your people hey
[1:27:31] man
[1:27:31] he says there's one big giant and as
[1:27:36] soon as we can slay him one glass disco
[1:27:38] eyes the same days of miracles his past
[1:27:41] he said the rest will take courage and
[1:27:44] the Lord granted that there was no
[1:27:46] Robert so Jagger's so forth pulled his
[1:27:48] sword and we fought the enemy on the
[1:27:50] land shut their mouths they can't say
[1:27:53] that miracles don't happen because they
[1:27:55] sure that here they are
[1:27:57] sure God's Word is eternally flashed on
[1:27:59] the Urim flashed on the word
[1:28:01] that's his here I'm Thurman and when he
[1:28:03] flashed on that it was positive
[1:28:05] hey ma'am and so without a doubt I want
[1:28:08] to say without a doubt William Branham
[1:28:10] through that giant and proved that Jesus
[1:28:14] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:28:18] forever but Goliath has some brothers
[1:28:23] who have defined the word of God and
[1:28:27] once again declare that Christ is not
[1:28:31] the same but I wanted to say it
[1:28:36] sometimes Remender eyes david's mighty
[1:28:39] men a man is described in and second
[1:28:43] Samuel 23 men who have been inspired but
[1:28:47] David's courage a man men like ELISA
[1:28:51] who slew through Philistines until his
[1:28:56] hand stuck to his sword and I say God
[1:28:59] let that be me may I be an ally either
[1:29:03] in this day take my sword against the
[1:29:05] enemy and strike and strike and strike
[1:29:08] him until you have to pry my hands off
[1:29:11] of the sword men such as a dino who slew
[1:29:18] 800 Philistines at a time others who
[1:29:22] killed lion like men others who went
[1:29:25] down in the pit and killed a lion others
[1:29:28] who who fought men men who'd hurt David
[1:29:32] who they believed would be king saud for
[1:29:36] drinkable
[1:29:37] water out of the well of Bethlehem now
[1:29:41] let me just say again you know we we
[1:29:45] have we've seen the Goliath same yeah we
[1:29:50] can point to a figure who God used but I
[1:29:53] want you to remember remember friends
[1:29:56] not making the man God at all let's
[1:29:59] forget about that but but realizing the
[1:30:01] real David is Christ he's the one that's
[1:30:04] coming King hey mom
[1:30:07] he's the one that really slayed the
[1:30:10] Goliath
[1:30:10] even the angel of God tell brother
[1:30:13] better never forget it's not you doing
[1:30:15] it it's me doing it I think this is what
[1:30:22] we got to take courage in this hour
[1:30:24] never forget this isn't done by human
[1:30:27] strength this isn't a a weak and frail
[1:30:31] man this is God I'm a brother branham
[1:30:36] but say over and over you didn't touch
[1:30:38] me you touch the high priest he was say
[1:30:42] over and over I would heal you I could
[1:30:45] but Jesus Christ has already done it
[1:30:48] a man over and over and over again he
[1:30:52] would declare I can't do this but he
[1:30:55] came if I can bring his presence and you
[1:30:59] know that he's real by suing you signs
[1:31:01] and you know that he's alive in the same
[1:31:04] yesterday today and forever you know
[1:31:06] he's here to kill your Goliath but then
[1:31:12] he said he he counted his self as one of
[1:31:16] those mighty men who was tannin with
[1:31:19] David who is to be king and will crown
[1:31:23] him in the Millennium to come and he
[1:31:26] said they're the real David Christ is a
[1:31:29] fugitive outside his church if you look
[1:31:33] at him in Revelation chapter 3 he is on
[1:31:36] the outside of the church and he's
[1:31:37] knocking warning in oh they're still
[1:31:41] singing about him they're still talking
[1:31:42] about him they're still preaching
[1:31:44] sermons about him but he's not there
[1:31:46] he's not welcomed his presence
[1:31:49] and welcome his worship isn't welcome
[1:31:53] his word isn't welcome not the fullness
[1:31:58] of it oh yeah
[1:32:01] anyway David sighed and said I want a
[1:32:06] drink you know again brother branham
[1:32:12] would reflect on this he said what a
[1:32:14] time we're living what is the sign that
[1:32:17] God said he would show last before it
[1:32:20] was to come to pass what was the thing
[1:32:22] he said Israel in her place over yonder
[1:32:25] the victory restore and her set back
[1:32:27] again looking at everything's just
[1:32:31] exactly sitting in line and the church
[1:32:33] in the Laodicean condition with Jesus on
[1:32:37] the outside a fugitive to his own church
[1:32:39] just as David was up above juror
[1:32:42] Bethlehem a fugitive from his own people
[1:32:45] a fugitive and Christ the Bible said in
[1:32:48] the last day was a fugitive his own
[1:32:50] people and their revelation the third
[1:32:53] chapter of the Laodicean age that we're
[1:32:55] living Christ on the outside knocking
[1:32:57] trying to get in a fugitive from his own
[1:33:00] people or to his own people they didn't
[1:33:03] want him but now people are crying god
[1:33:07] save us an angel of death is coming to
[1:33:12] the land it's kind of like 9-1-1 you
[1:33:16] know when that happened even the beer
[1:33:18] joints put out saying god save america
[1:33:20] or god bless america
[1:33:23] yeah you know again the people all of
[1:33:26] sudden got religious people begin to
[1:33:29] call on God oh I hope it ain't too late
[1:33:33] hey man I hope right now that wallets
[1:33:36] wallets yet day that you yourself would
[1:33:38] make you called in an election sure a
[1:33:41] man they didn't want him but now people
[1:33:44] are wanting him now people are crying
[1:33:47] even church services well I can take it
[1:33:50] or leave it
[1:33:53] and I don't want to be us folder here
[1:33:56] this morning I want to be an encourage
[1:33:58] or but I don't want to say there have
[1:34:00] been many of times people have set out
[1:34:02] of
[1:34:02] Church when they could have been present
[1:34:05] but many times they've used have a
[1:34:08] little excuse of why not to be here a
[1:34:11] man that found some reason no I'd not to
[1:34:16] come and encourage the brothers and
[1:34:18] sisters and now now well now all of a
[1:34:23] sudden there's that want to be in church
[1:34:25] now all of a sudden a mystic you know
[1:34:29] this old adage is you've never missed
[1:34:31] the water to the well runs dry
[1:34:33] you never realized what you had remember
[1:34:38] this is a time God gives you an
[1:34:40] opportunity to reflect on what you have
[1:34:43] and it might be speaking to some people
[1:34:45] in your little churches ten twenty five
[1:34:47] people oh don't feel alone and by
[1:34:49] yourself I preach some many a sermon
[1:34:52] when I started out to 12 people killer
[1:34:54] 12 or less I've reached a million hour
[1:35:00] to where there wasn't 20 people man
[1:35:04] we've been bust we have been blessed
[1:35:08] abundantly and I don't know and I can't
[1:35:12] even make a promise to you will ever
[1:35:14] ever be able to come together again who
[1:35:17] knows only God it's in his hands some
[1:35:23] say whoa but what would be the use of
[1:35:25] this fine building what would be unused
[1:35:28] to this place that God did so many
[1:35:30] miracles I'll tell you what well that
[1:35:33] miracle is still going on right now as
[1:35:35] we're speaking across the foreign lands
[1:35:37] because if we didn't have where we're at
[1:35:39] right now we wouldn't have the internet
[1:35:41] capabilities to reach you this morning
[1:35:43] but God made a provision but there was
[1:35:48] David he the Bible said David long now
[1:35:52] we're making this David Christ then you
[1:35:56] will know that that I Christ is longing
[1:36:01] he'll know that that one could give me a
[1:36:06] drink of the water of the well of
[1:36:09] Bethlehem which is by the gate second
[1:36:12] Samuel 23 16 and
[1:36:14] three mighty men break through the host
[1:36:17] to the Philistine
[1:36:19] that means the army other Philistines
[1:36:21] and through what around the well the
[1:36:23] Bethlehem that was by the gate and took
[1:36:26] it and brought it to David
[1:36:28] you see they heard just the side just an
[1:36:34] ill-wish
[1:36:36] from their king now they knew their king
[1:36:40] had been anointed
[1:36:42] they knew that Samuel the Prophet had
[1:36:45] poured the oil upon him they knew he was
[1:36:48] going to come into power let me just say
[1:36:50] we know our Lord Jesus is an onion we
[1:36:53] know these will be king of kings and
[1:36:56] Lord of lords
[1:36:56] we know that don't Satan may be king or
[1:37:00] Prince of this world right now that this
[1:37:02] king is coming to take it over a man and
[1:37:07] we hear we hear as they did they did you
[1:37:11] a sigh oh that I wasn't kidding get a
[1:37:15] drink if I could be refreshed now you're

[1:37:35] for some refreshments but I'm telling
[1:37:38] you in this moment he's looking for
[1:37:41] refreshment he's looking for somebody as
[1:37:45] relic Branham would say that what
[1:37:47] warrior could see the great Holy Spirit
[1:37:50] come in the form of Jesus Christ the
[1:37:52] little body of Christ had taken over
[1:37:54] again he says 10 with me and let's offer
[1:37:57] him a drink of fresh Pentecostal waters
[1:38:01] he said that some stagnated system but
[1:38:05] all fresh Pentecostal water a threat
[1:38:09] poor not the Holy Ghost
[1:38:11] and refresh your king with your praises

[1:38:56] not just a bunch of screaming and
[1:38:58] hollering and cara nonne but I mean a
[1:39:01] genuine Holy Spirit baptism that
[1:39:04] produces a life of Jesus Christ back
[1:39:07] into the person that life Oh men of God
[1:39:15] in Christ where is that sword a man our
[1:39:20] Lord desires a fresh drink and I don't
[1:39:24] care if it's life or death
[1:39:26] let's cut through this thing it's so
[1:39:29] hard
[1:39:29] standing by yourself and I'm calling for
[1:39:32] men to stand by me and stand with the
[1:39:34] word what the word say just do the way
[1:39:37] the word said it I don't care what
[1:39:39] anybody else or anything else says stay
[1:39:42] stay it that way for there's only one
[1:39:44] thing that will cut let's go get back to
[1:39:47] Bethlehem the true water of God in his
[1:39:53] prayer he would pray like this Oh God
[1:39:56] I've noticed with that word and bring
[1:39:59] thy word promise to this last day to
[1:40:02] pass and may we leave this building this
[1:40:06] morning as shining instruments of God
[1:40:09] may we go with the sword its glittering
[1:40:12] in the air and cuddly ever weighed and
[1:40:15] everything else until we get back to the
[1:40:18] to get back to people to Christ and
[1:40:21] bring a cool
[1:40:22] fresh drink our Lord instead of all
[1:40:25] these fad may decrease let the people
[1:40:28] drink from that fountain a real cool
[1:40:31] refreshing Pentecostal blessing that it
[1:40:34] might bless his heart and bring him back
[1:40:37] among us again that ought to be our
[1:40:41] prayer warriors he said a fresh drink
[1:40:46] for him a real true worship a genuine
[1:40:49] heart where he can pour down as make his
[1:40:53] word to live in this day and he'll have
[1:40:55] it
[1:40:56] he said he restored the faith of the
[1:40:57] people back to the father's the faith of
[1:41:00] the children Malachi Ford tells us that
[1:41:02] will come and it'll be there don't you
[1:41:05] worry
[1:41:05] it'll be there Gustin said so and if you
[1:41:08] wonder will the faith be there I want to
[1:41:11] say that's what this message produces it
[1:41:14] produces that faith ok ma'am
[1:41:18] oh my not just an excitement not just an
[1:41:24] emotion that comes with it but create
[1:41:27] that undying faith that won't give an
[1:41:30] inch to the enemy now we have the word
[1:41:34] the Bible is our abstract and I'm going
[1:41:38] to try to bring it down in these next 30
[1:41:40] minutes as we try to try to get to cover
[1:41:44] some territory this morning because I
[1:41:48] will told you I wanted to preach on
[1:41:50] enforcing our abstract of title we have
[1:41:55] the Word of God the Bible is our title
[1:41:59] man and the Holy Ghost is our abstract
[1:42:03] in other words it has cleared the deed
[1:42:06] and given you the right and it is time
[1:42:12] to throw out the squatter the invader
[1:42:16] that's on the island now you know many
[1:42:20] many years before David probably five
[1:42:23] seven eight hundred years before I don't
[1:42:26] know as far as chronologically what it
[1:42:28] was but you know Joshua had given the
[1:42:31] people the land but now the invaders had
[1:42:34] come in
[1:42:35] the land was theirs they had been
[1:42:38] possessing it but now invaders had come
[1:42:41] in that's what water filicide means an
[1:42:44] invader and so he is an invader and then
[1:42:49] when Satan like a Goliath invades your
[1:42:52] land and begins to claim your property
[1:42:55] and threaten use with this Angel of
[1:42:59] Death
[1:42:59] what are you to do now I meet Saul and
[1:43:04] his army was around trying to figure out
[1:43:06] what to do there was only one man with a
[1:43:10] solution and that was David and David
[1:43:14] said well here's the solution
[1:43:16] don't kill Goliath hey man the solution
[1:43:21] is easy I can I can solve the problem it
[1:43:26] ain't that hard
[1:43:27] we don't need 40 more days of looking
[1:43:30] around and wondered at making plans
[1:43:32] we just need to kill that glass today is
[1:43:36] heads coming off man and I just want to
[1:43:39] say when glass invades your land and
[1:43:42] claims your property claims your health
[1:43:44] claims your victory claims your joy and
[1:43:48] threatened you with an angel of death
[1:43:50] I'm gonna tell you so I'm out he's an
[1:43:53] invader he has no right to be there it
[1:43:57] is not his land it is your land I want
[1:44:02] to say to you this Bible is your Bible
[1:44:04] this word is your word this promise is
[1:44:07] your promise you don't belong to the
[1:44:09] devil he has no right to squat on it and
[1:44:12] say you can't have it and then you are
[1:44:14] the children of the Most High God and
[1:44:17] you've got to realize what you gotta do
[1:44:19] you gotta throw it off cast him out
[1:44:25] you're waiting for some miracle worker
[1:44:28] to come work your miracle you're the
[1:44:30] miracle worker
[1:44:31] a man you're the child of God so I'm out
[1:44:37] when Satan like the Goliath invades your
[1:44:41] land and claims your property and
[1:44:43] threatens you that's what you do throw
[1:44:46] him out don't negotiate
[1:44:49] no reason with him man
[1:44:53] turn out the Holy Ghost is your token
[1:44:56] it's your sign that the lamb has taken
[1:44:59] your place so it's your abstract that
[1:45:01] everything against you is struck off and
[1:45:04] it gives you a free pass so death angel
[1:45:08] you got a pass over me that's what you
[1:45:10] gotta announce who the devil today death
[1:45:13] angel you got a pass over this house
[1:45:15] we're under a token man say that
[1:45:19] remember brother branham would Satan say
[1:45:22] that be careful there's a people rising
[1:45:25] in the last day I see them coming
[1:45:28] amen show me the fire boys to the final
[1:45:31] age show him your token
[1:45:36] it's your abstract it shows that your
[1:45:39] deed is clear you have ever right to
[1:45:43] God's promises yeah that right took
[1:45:45] healing deliverance salvation come on
[1:45:49] every provision and the Bible ever need
[1:45:53] my God shall supply all your needs
[1:45:57] according to his riches and glory amen
[1:46:02] remember when you truly repent and you
[1:46:04] have fully surrendered and you have been
[1:46:07] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:46:10] are entitled to the token it's yours
[1:46:14] God can't hold it back the devil can
[1:46:17] keep you from it it's you just take in
[1:46:20] an exception it is for your own man
[1:46:23] there's something for something some of
[1:46:24] you need to do right now and say I
[1:46:26] accept that promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:28] from my life I've repented I've been
[1:46:29] baptized but right now I'm accepting it
[1:46:33] now that that's that's divine healing on
[1:46:36] the soul ram divine healer on the
[1:46:38] visible realm is the same day you say
[1:46:41] jesus paid for it and I am a repented
[1:46:45] child of God I have received the Holy
[1:46:47] Ghost and right now I accept all the
[1:46:50] promises that are his
[1:46:51] I accept that healing right now from my
[1:46:53] body in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:46:56] it's just a simple right there is that I
[1:46:59] accept it you did it you paid for it I'm
[1:47:02] taking it and then you take it and you
[1:47:05] hold on to it you don't let no devil
[1:47:08] talk you out of it full obedience to the
[1:47:10] Word of God the whole Word of God
[1:47:12] entitles us to the token o brother to
[1:47:14] him I did I do this right that I did you
[1:47:17] repent happy fully repented have you
[1:47:22] been baptized in his name then it
[1:47:23] entitles you to the Holy Ghost when you
[1:47:27] believe on the Lord and you confess him
[1:47:28] as your Savior you're you're an owner of
[1:47:31] the promise it's a deed but when you
[1:47:35] receive the Holy Ghost the token it is
[1:47:37] the abstract that your deed in other
[1:47:40] words it's the proof your deed is
[1:47:42] cleared and you are sealed with the Holy
[1:47:44] Ghost come on
[1:47:46] and then you saw I believed on the Lord
[1:47:48] I've accepted a message but this is a
[1:47:51] moment to get desperate and be filled
[1:47:53] with the spirit there's an angel of
[1:47:55] death in the land you must have the
[1:47:57] token our parish the older ghosts is a
[1:48:01] confirmation it's abstract that ever
[1:48:05] claim the devil has against you is
[1:48:08] tricky enough a man now and when you

[1:49:21] token it's our duty to express God to
[1:49:25] this world to your neighborhood
[1:49:27] and brother branham would over and over
[1:49:30] it must have been in his notes because
[1:49:31] every time he preached the token he
[1:49:33] would tell you these words he expects us
[1:49:36] now to display the token over our faith
[1:49:40] displayed the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:49:43] must be on display in the church he said
[1:49:46] that he expects us now to display the
[1:49:50] token over our faith to Satan's group
[1:49:52] and the unbelievers and the cults and so
[1:49:57] forth that don't believe in it that we
[1:49:59] believe in what he said others promise
[1:50:02] and that Jesus Christ has raised up from
[1:50:05] the dead showing himself alive and
[1:50:08] that's the badge the token of
[1:50:10] identification because it is Christ's
[1:50:13] own life and you didn't identify in the

[1:50:26] unbelieving coats and denomination that
[1:50:28] we believe that his promise is true and
[1:50:32] he will do what he promised so this is
[1:50:35] the hour of best friend the Holy Ghost

[1:50:43] he says you can't leave the blood in the
[1:50:46] bucket it's got to be displayed on the
[1:50:48] doorpost and the same thing we've got to
[1:50:52] be identified with the Holy Ghost from

[1:55:07] need to do you know I can just give you
[1:55:12] an example of examples of brother
[1:55:15] Branham even the prayer line you
[1:55:17] bringing people out telling them
[1:55:19] something in their life whispering
[1:55:21] something to them some sin in their life
[1:55:24] and then say okay you've repented is
[1:55:27] forgiven now you can be healed well how
[1:55:31] long did that take a man how long did
[1:55:35] that take one sister would sister
[1:55:37] Jeannie Kempster
[1:55:38] the prayer line and they're in
[1:55:40] Shreveport Louisiana little girl that
[1:55:42] was a teenager Methodist girl didn't
[1:55:45] know any better
[1:55:46] sleeping around smoking and their hair
[1:55:48] brother Brandon call out a woman tell
[1:55:50] her her exposure sin that she was
[1:55:52] smoking and so on it just took a minute
[1:55:55] just a few more people in the prayer and
[1:55:58] she repented that God forgive me I'm
[1:56:01] sorry I didn't know that was so wrong
[1:56:04] don't let him tell that to my mother or
[1:56:07] a prophet didn't even discern it and
[1:56:10] call it out why from there three people
[1:56:16] later it was forgiven a man your pardon
[1:56:21] is not a pardon unless you accept it as
[1:56:23] a pardon
[1:56:24] so if you think there's something accept
[1:56:26] the pardon but believers take the token
[1:56:35] now what Jesus began to do in Galilee he
[1:56:40] continues to do now through his display
[1:56:43] of the token of the Holy Ghost back upon
[1:56:45] the church but is not was not the Acts
[1:56:49] of the Apostle it was acts of the Holy
[1:56:51] Ghost in the Apostles and that was a
[1:56:54] token now so the huh the real token is
[1:57:00] the accent of Holy Ghost in the church
[1:57:03] now so again he's the same yesterday
[1:57:06] today and forever so he expects us now
[1:57:10] to display his token to all of Satan's
[1:57:14] unbelieving cults and denominations of
[1:57:17] this world that we believe that what he
[1:57:20] has promised so notice what he sees
[1:57:23] telling us over and over each time he
[1:57:25] preaches that token he expects us now to
[1:57:29] display his token hey man
[1:57:33] it's just like he said the rainbow sang
[1:57:35] when the Sun comes up of the rainbow we
[1:57:38] remember God has remembered his promise
[1:57:41] he's not going to store the world with
[1:57:43] water right and he said you
[1:57:46] it's been thousands of years but that
[1:57:49] token is still the truth and he said it
[1:57:52] Jesus don't come for ten thousand years
[1:57:54] you know no my a still gotta honor that
[1:57:58] token hey man no matter how many things
[1:58:02] changes and he's gotta honor that token
[1:58:05] he said he would and the expenses now to
[1:58:08] display his token over our god-given
[1:58:12] faith to ever unbelieving cult in the
[1:58:15] nation and the world that believes that
[1:58:18] signs and wonders don't follow the
[1:58:20] believer God expects us to display it
[1:58:24] that science will follow them that
[1:58:27] believe this is like the Jewish
[1:58:30] resistance this is our homeland and he
[1:58:33] sends it to pinnacle some people just
[1:58:35] realize we're not the scum of the earth
[1:58:38] hey man we're sending daughters of God
[1:58:41] we're heirs of all things to Christ but
[1:58:44] as long as the devil can keep you afraid
[1:58:46] to claim your inheritance city's got you
[1:58:49] but don't be afraid of me any word that
[1:58:51] God wrote just hang your faith on every
[1:58:54] punctuation of it and say it's right you
[1:58:58] got to stand up and claim it for
[1:59:00] yourself

[2:11:36] but I do hallelujah
[2:11:39] I do I need this message it's my
[2:11:43] abstract to a title that's what I want
[2:11:49] to tell some of these guys sometimes
[2:11:51] they gets lifted up so much in their own
[2:11:54] selves and got their own thing well you
[2:11:57] know why do you need brother Branham if
[2:11:59] you're so great why do you need the
[2:12:02] message if you're so wonderful just go
[2:12:05] on and do your stuff alienate yourself
[2:12:08] away from your bigger than it anyway
[2:12:10] just do your stuff but to me the promise
[2:12:14] has been given and it's my land
[2:12:18] and I'm going to take this laughs and in
[2:12:21] this land we have a right to enforce the
[2:12:24] law
[2:12:24] hey man and the law giver the Holy
[2:12:27] Spirit is here the agent of God to see
[2:12:31] that it's done that way and let me just
[2:12:33] tell you what a prophet told me you
[2:12:35] don't have to nut down to the devil we
[2:12:38] don't have to bow down to him the days
[2:12:40] of slavery is over we don't belong to
[2:12:44] the devil in my way we're don't have to
[2:12:46] have this sickness we don't have to have
[2:12:49] his faults doctors we don't have to be
[2:12:51] slave to him you don't have to obey his
[2:12:54] sins anymore somebody help me preach you
[2:12:56] don't have to knock down the devil we
[2:12:58] got a law and that's the law of the Holy
[2:13:01] Spirit now the thing you have to do is
[2:13:06] to know how to let go and let God do it
[2:13:09] sometimes we are trying so hard within
[2:13:12] ourselves to make something happen
[2:13:14] just take God at His Word and say Lord
[2:13:17] you made this promise and it's mine and
[2:13:21] I accept it now in your name and I'm
[2:13:23] going forward in your name a man and I'm
[2:13:30] claiming it for myself because I have
[2:13:33] the privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[2:13:37] claims that God gave us my brother
[2:13:40] Brandon gave an example of this he said
[2:13:43] one of the brothers they're driving up
[2:13:45] miles miles from down in Georgia had
[2:13:49] come up parked his car you know where
[2:13:52] went into a place and somebody come to
[2:13:54] stole it with all of his longings old
[2:13:57] family was it lost with their clothes
[2:13:59] everything it was gone and he's they
[2:14:05] came to brother Branson what are we
[2:14:07] going to do so they've stolen our car so
[2:14:08] there was a theft ring going on in
[2:14:11] Louisville and they was stealing cars
[2:14:12] right and left and he said so what we
[2:14:15] did he said if we got down on our knees
[2:14:20] wonder wasn't the last time you've done
[2:14:22] that
[2:14:23] I gotta we got down on our knees and he
[2:14:27] said we begin to pray and he said after
[2:14:30] a while evasions
[2:14:31] and he said I saw the man he had once
[2:14:35] been a Christian and said the Holy
[2:14:37] Spirit got to dealing with this man and
[2:14:39] said you know you could get caught at
[2:14:42] this you ought to return that and he
[2:14:44] said in a few minutes he turned around
[2:14:46] and it brought it right back and he left
[2:14:48] it over and on a certain Street and
[2:14:50] brother Brendan said and a little bit go
[2:14:52] by a certain Street and you said you'll
[2:14:53] find your car with the keys in it he
[2:14:56] said a half of a tank of gas and be gone
[2:14:58] because he went all the way down to
[2:15:00] certain town and came back and he's
[2:15:02] there he said what did the Holy Spirit
[2:15:05] was sin out by a word come on that was
[2:15:10] being prayed a word was prayed and it
[2:15:14] went out and got him and brought him
[2:15:16] back
[2:15:18] a man with the stolen possession now I
[2:15:23] want you to know friend maybe maybe
[2:15:26] you're in a situation like that but
[2:15:28] we've got a right to enforce a claim and
[2:15:33] it doesn't take a physical present to
[2:15:35] make it happen
[2:15:38] right now right there in your room with
[2:15:41] the poor the pastor can't get to you I
[2:15:44] can't believe hands on you where it
[2:15:45] can't be a physical thing right now the
[2:15:48] word going forth can't bring deliverance
[2:15:51] to your life and you say this think give
[2:15:56] it back and it's got to do it because we
[2:16:00] can take God's agent the Holy Ghost go
[2:16:02] down on my knees and say thus sayeth the
[2:16:04] Lord where are we getting the say Thor
[2:16:06] we may not have a vision but we got the
[2:16:08] word that's the vision and he's got to
[2:16:11] give it up so the law the law of the
[2:16:15] Spirit of God is to force Satan to give
[2:16:20] up what he is unrightfully deceitfully
[2:16:23] taken from God souls of men he took from
[2:16:27] God souls of women children sickness of
[2:16:30] the body he placed upon the people where
[2:16:32] God made them in his image to be like
[2:16:34] him in the church is given the rightful
[2:16:37] legal rights by the Bible to take the
[2:16:40] holy spirit and enforce this upon him
[2:16:44] so you see he has made you a deputy in
[2:16:48] other words he has given you the
[2:16:50] authority to tell Satan to get out hey
[2:16:55] Matt now you got a house you got to be
[2:16:57] ordained to do it you got to have the
[2:16:58] bags of believer which is the Holy Ghost
[2:17:00] you say you got the powers no I don't
[2:17:03] have the power but I got the authority
[2:17:04] hey man I've got the authority to use
[2:17:07] his name hey man now again he says when
[2:17:12] Satan put something up on you in a way
[2:17:14] of sickness whatever it is every
[2:17:16] born-again person has an abstract
[2:17:18] warrant a warrant from God now a warrant
[2:17:21] is a document from the government of
[2:17:24] authorizing the deputy to make an arrest
[2:17:26] and the Holy Spirit is here to put the
[2:17:30] devil out no matter if it's cancer tumor
[2:17:33] cataract brother Jerry I treble whatever
[2:17:39] he is the Holy Spirit will put him out
[2:17:43] if you'll serve notice on him in the
[2:17:47] name of Jesus Christ because he has no
[2:17:50] legal right I am the lord that healeth
[2:17:53] all of that diseases that right he was
[2:17:55] wounded for our transgressions with his
[2:17:57] tracks we were healed but you have to go
[2:17:59] over and take it I'm at Florida God a
[2:18:06] man when a man or a woman brother
[2:18:09] Brennan said his trust in the full armor
[2:18:11] of God and a power its authority from on
[2:18:14] high and Devils will scream and brakes
[2:18:16] will screech and even deaths itself must
[2:18:19] shatter and even Ghia graves will open
[2:18:22] at the authority that Jesus Christ gave
[2:18:24] his church what a promised Elias
[2:18:28] a man has no legal rights to rule over
[2:18:34] so whack him like him again take your
[2:18:36] sword don't put it back in the sheath
[2:18:39] it's time we stood on our promise this
[2:18:44] is the day of enforcing your rights
[2:18:50] abstract
[2:18:51] right now I want you to think of this as
[2:18:56] we bring it down you can no longer be a
[2:19:00] slave again never never he has no claim
