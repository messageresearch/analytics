nobody like you you given us life the goodness of God has been on our lives your mercy never fails thank you Lord your presence is with us the never failing presence of Jesus that said I'll never leave you or forsake you I pray Lord today that we'll realize we're in the presence of the allmighty and that he's speaking May the spirit speak through is his servant today and he through the ears we give it to you Lord in Jesus name amen hallu amen God bless you before you're seated let's turn to Revelation chap 2 in verse 17 if you will please and uh Revelation 2 and verse 17 he that hath an ear I pray you have an ear today not everybody has one amen not a hearing ear not an anointed ear but he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith into the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it and then if you'll turn with me to Exodus chapter 16 and verse 14 I'd like to read from there to Exodus 16:14 and when to do that lay was gone up behold upon the face of the Wilderness there lay a small round thing a small as the hor frost on the ground now us southern people don't know really how to compare that cuz we've probably never seen hor Frost but nevertheless it was just a small round thing and when the children of Israel saw it they said one to another it is Mana for they wish not what it was and Moses said unto them this is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded gather of it every man according to his eating an OM for every man according to the number of your persons take ye every man for them which are in his tents and the children of Israel did so and gathered some more some less and when they did meet it with an OM he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little Had No Lack and they gathered every man according to his eating and Moses said let no man leave it till the morning not withstanding they hearkened not un Moses but some of them left it until morning and it bred worms and stank and Moses was wro with them then down to verse 31 and the house of Israel called the name thereof mana and it was like coriander seed White and the taste of it was like Wafers made with honey and Moses said this is the thing which the Lord command fill an OM of it to be kept for your Generations that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness and when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt and Moses said unto Aaron take a pot and put an full of Mana therein and lay it up before the Lord to be kept for your Generations as the Lord commanded Moses so Aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept and the children of Israel did eat Mana 40 years until they came into to a land inhabited they did eat Mana until they would come to the borders of the land of Canaan God bless you you can have your seats if you will turn with me also over to Psalms chapter 78 I want to read from there as well uh we'll read from verse 12 Psalms 78 and 12 marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt in the field of zoan he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand up as an Heap in the daytime he led them with a cloud and all the night with the light of fire he clav the rocks in the Wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depths he brought streams also out of the Rock and cause Waters to run down like rivers and they sin yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness and they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust yay they spake against God and they said can God furnish a table in the wilderness behold he smokee the rock that the waters gust out and the streams overflowed can he get bread also can he provide flesh for his people therefore the Lord heard this and was wro so a fire was kindled against Jacob and anger also came up against Israel because they belied not in God nor trusted in his salvation though he had commanded the clouds from above and open the doors of heaven and it rained down Mana upon them to eat and had given them of the Corn of Heaven man did eat Angel's food he sent them meat to the full oh my what a wonderful scripture reading today and I just want to say that our God is just as much with us today as he was as he was recount here by David in the psalms now if you notice in the reading from The Exodus though that you know a lot of people had gathered the the Mana but they they um they had gathered it and tried to keep it over to the next day and and that Mana some of that Mana grew stale and bread worms and stank you see he had been and they had been instructed to leave none of it until the morning but they didn't hear What mo Moses said but they left it to the morning and it bred worms and stank but then we also read that there was a place that the Mana never grew old or bred worms and stank amen for he said take a pot and put a full Mana thereof and lay it up before the Lord to be kept for your generation so here's Mana that will last for generations and and then there's Mana that will only last for a day now I want to speak on today of the place where Mana never grows old or grow stale and of course that place is behind the veil in the holies of holies behind the veil is where the Mana in the presence of the sh Glory never gets old and it never stinks but outside the veil the Mana will grow stale and breed worms now brother Bram told us uh in the message and I want to it seemed like I'm just jumping off here somewhere else but I'm want to bring us this for you to understand in the message leadership he said many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible said so that's exactly right well you know this has caused many to question and wonder oh what do we even need the Holy Ghost for if it won't keep us from hell and we could have it every hour of our life and still be lost and go to hell well what do we want it for you know perhaps you know we we don't even want that Mana I tell you you do we all do but a person must go Beyond the Veil beyond the courts of justification and S the veil of sanctification and past the mere anointings of the spirit the the holy spirit that comes and goes like it did in the Old Testament it would come down upon men and then would leave but here in this new covenant there is a place that you go in God that the Holy Spirit never leaves you it doesn't come and go it abides with you forever now so again we we must go beyond the inner Veil or into the inner Veil where the spirit of God comes into the soul and that is where the Mana never grows stale it must be more than just an anointing upon your human spirit that stirs your emotion but it must come upon the soul and change your nature now will it be emotional sure it comes with feelings it is not emotion amen but it can be experienced now but of course this problem as to why many will go from Camp to camp and the experience will will go off before next camp and they'll go from meeting to meeting and and um from revival to Revival as it was uh needing all to be Revival again and some you know just blame it on Youth Camp or others want to blame it on on the experience itself and say well it was just a motion no it wasn't just emo motion amen it was the genuine Holy Spirit but to lack of total surrender it only got As far as the the realm of the humans Spirit but if it ever gets down in the soul and Roots out sin nature and the person of Christ the Holy Spirit comes in to dwell within the soul you are sealed to the day of redemption and Satan is sealed out amen so it's no longer just a baptism or an anointing of the spirit that you can have every day of your life and go to hell but it is an indwelling presence of the almighty God the person himself Christ coming to live within you now brother Bram uh spoke about this the this mana and uh for example speak to the Rock I'm going to refer to a number of them today some I won't I'll just paraphrase and won't tell you but but he says brother every man or woman that comes into this Divine Holy Ghost priesthood has a right to get the genuine heartful of the original baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost the same signs the same power the same demonstration same feeling same action Glory not something that looks like it the original amen and the Lord said I'm going to store up a whole lot of this cuz there going to be many generations so every time one comes in I'm going to give him a great big heart full of it I I I'm so glad to know that there's Mana been stored up and there is a place of an endless supply of the Holy Ghost that is not just an anointing on your spirit but but abides with in the soul now here's the problem with with stal Mana you know as as brother Brandon would talk about it he said he said don't pick up too much of it just what you can use today don't just try to go to church one day and get enough religion to last you until next year amen it won't last it's that kept over got wiggle tails in it you know well I prayed up I come to the altar last Sunday I got my religion done now for the for the year for the month or you know I'm satisfied and you know that's what's wrong with a lot of churches in other words you had a lot of it wigger tails that tries to get in your experience of years ago as he says let's get up higher and move right on remember the Mana never ceased from that day until they entered into the promised land and the holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost will never cease falling on the church till the Millennium comes Jesus comes in power the old corn again now so note now we must we must go Beyond the Veil and we when we receive the Holy Ghost we re become a priest un God remember this is the anointing for priesthood amen the Bible speaks of us as a royal priesthood it says he has made us under our God Kings and Priests we have a right to go Beyond the Veil and receive of the original mana mana that can never rot Mana that'll never get old manner that will never grow stale because it's in the presence of the Shina glory and and it's the experience is renewed every day now in power de seasion brother randam says he says this this Holy Ghost Mana that began to fall on the day of Pentecost was to sustain the church and the church was to live only by the Holy Spirit until the day we enter the Millennium so how long does this holy the Holy Ghost is going to last us how long will it be poured out how many how many more years do we have experience until we are translated amen the same Holy Ghost notice it was for everyone that was a priest in the Old Testament everyone in the New Testament that becomes a Christian born again becomes a priest of God we are priests and Kings a priest is to make sacrifice amen I hope today you came as a priest Amen to make a sacrifice oh you say oh brother Tim Jesus is our sacrifice and we can't kill Jesus again no that's not your sacrifice that you offer this morning you are to offer a sacrifice in your worship amen it is to be a sacrifice of praise giv giv praise to his name a sacrifice of our lips I want you to know it's not your head nodding amen not a mental asent but an actual response a sacrifice your lips offer a sacrifice and praise put up Hebrews 135 and you'll see what I mean for for he says he he says there we're to give God the sacrifice of our lips our lips have got to make a sacrifice a praise to God continually amen that is the fruit of our lips hallelujah amen now listen this this is the fruit offering that you're to give to God Amen Jesus was the lamb and the Passover this is not the Passover this is not offering Christ this is you offering back to God fruit in your worship bringing the fruit of your lips yeah amen which is the the fruit of our lips giv thanks to his name and and and let me quote brother brandom say I don't feel like it he says do it anyhow it has nothing to do with how you feel or how depressed you are how much trouble you've had this week or how much sickness has been in your home or how what your bank account level is right now has nothing to do with that it has to do with not your problems but who he is who he is notice he said he said say I'm too tired and that's the way it is brother mam said himself I preached some more tired people than than ever ever in all my life amen it seemed like everybody just wore out I'm too tired this morning didn't get enough sleep we've been working too hard we've been making too much straw and too much bricks and and working for Pharaoh amen he said so he said say I don't feel like it do it anyhow that's a sacrifice say I feel too tired the devil will tell you that till he takes you to hell that's right you are to make a spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips given praise to his name Kings and Priests unto God how many are priests and Kings this morning then offer fruit amen and it must come from your lips you just can't sit there and be an observer you must be a participator you are a priest you have a job to do I I you know sometimes I I watch I well I'm not even going to say where I was but I was in a meeting not too long ago and and watching young people there and as everybody else is singing you don't think you've got a job to do you you parents you don't know how to teach your children from when they're like this you know don't let you know here we're worshiping God get up when they stand when they ask to stand you stand when they clap hands you clap hands when you raise your hands to praise you raise your hands to praise amen come on that should be that should be something that parents impart to their kids to their young people and young people should never sit on the Pew much less you oldow grouches out there I don't feel like singing let everybody sing for me problem is you ain't felt like singing for years well it's my nature well I'm I'll tell you what I wouldn't claim grouchiness am amen when you come to the house of God you are a priest and you are to offer praise to his name it ought to come when we're singing it ought to come when there's preaching it ought to come you know just glorifying the name of the Lord you [Applause] participate how will walk out on you again well go ahead walk out we're going to worship amen now so he says so he so again you know he he tells us to that the devil will tell you that till he takes you to hell now so so again you know you refuse to worship God you refuse to enter end do you know what's going to happen you're just going to be pulled right down Into the Depths it'll not lift you up out of your your ways and your doldrums and your lukewarmness you've got to fight lukewarmness the Bible said that we are Overcomers and we are going to overcome the lukewarmness of this age and so offer fruits it must come from your lips you just can't sit there and be an observer now of course we know of course we know brother brandom said it over and over again where that Jesus is there is noise but we know there can be noise and Jesus not present that's right amen even brother Brown told us we get noise confused with the anointing noise isn't ain't the anointing he said I've seen a lot of noise and not enough Faith to cure a toothache you got to come solemnly to the father amen and some have trained even you can be trained in a congregation to to give a response running to the platform standing shouting screaming to the preaching you know just noise and some have confused that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and it's not amen the evidence of the token is not noise but a surrendered life to [Music] [Applause] God Amen now in the message all things he said oh I went down there there's a lot of power brother the whole the whole floor was dancing in the spirit and and not enough Faith to heal a tooth he you call that power that's not power that's blessings there's a lot of difference between blessings and power God makes his blessings on the righteous and unrighteous The Sun Shines and we you know we got to get back to truth we got to come back to what God means but I want you not to lose your balance here though it is not power nor faith it is blessings and blessings are still needed hallu amen amen shouting is needed in fact of the matter is shouting should be encouraged that's right amen hallelujah W what if it's just noise but but just and only blessing well why why God deny God's people blessings but anyway let's just talk about what the Bible said about shouting for a minute Psalms 32:11 be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye righteous and Shout for Joy all ye that are upright or righteous in heart amen so he encourages us to shout for Joy Psalms 47 And1 oh clap your hands all you people shout unto God with a voice of Triumph what are you doing you're already counting it done you know Jesus defeated it at Calvary so you've got a right to shout with a voice of [Applause] Triumph Psalms 5:11 let those that put their trust in thee Rejoice let them shout ever shout for Joy because thou defended them amen let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee amen but prayer is also the job of a priest David prayed may my prayer be set before you like incense Luke chapter 18 you know Jesus tells a parable to the effect that they ought to always come and pray and not lose heart I you know sometimes this is so difficult because of course he uses the parable of the unjust judge and the woman you know coming to him and but he taught us to pray and not give up so so again he taught us to pray that we Al all to pray not lose heart and pray not get become discouraged pray and never give up you you say well brother Tim we prayed for our loved one and and they died and we didn't God didn't answer our prayer the way we wanted him to so you know so you know so so what now we prayed and why he told us to pray and then we didn't get an answer God wants us to God wants us to pray anyway even when he says no we continue to pray right on for the promises of God now if he said no to that no need to pray for that anymore but however you know the rest of time we can just go right back to pray and well what about this Lord here's another need I'm not giving up just because somebody died of cancer don't mean we're not going to pray for cancer to leave the people come on just because somebody's sick and and they died from me we won't pray for that disease anymore no we know our God [Applause] answers but you know it seems like the more oia comes in the more we want to refine the church and her behavior until we just want dry theology anymore brother brandham told us this in the exposition of the seven Church ages said Paul saw it coming but he warned them about the subtle priesthood that would come and take over with its false doctrines he knew they would Implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a Holy Spirit Spirit Ministry and even today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom and the leoty the best we can see is a you preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to sorb it this is a far cry from Paul who said they when they all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship amen so so there again we we have worship leaders what are they doing trying to Lead You In Worship that's we have the ministry of the word going forth where God is speaking to the people you must respond to that amen if you want God to move on your behalf had he right didn't just sit there and Nod her head but it was her response that moved God on her behalf she he said that's nothing but the truth and it was her profession uh there a confession that she made in that moment they caus God to say give her what she wants you want God to give you what you want you have a need amen then respond to the word of godall now brother bradam talked about this over and over all the way through 1964 even after the seals would use this illustration he talked about how Aaron the great priest now remember you are a priest look over to your neighbor said I'm a priest well okay you probably wasn't very convincing your wife said oh sure right well amen I'm a priest that's what I am so bear in mind we are we are priests being B born of the Holy Spirit we are a priest unto God all right now as a priest now we're dressed a certain way the high priest would be dressed with a bell and a pomegranate a bell and a pomegranate all around his His Garment and it would ring out holy holy holy unto the Lord amen so you see that's how they knew that they hadn't been slain because they could hear the priest moving around behind the veil because of the noise and he said now listen I'm starting to quote now the only way he knowed he was alive when he was back there they could listen and hear the Bell hear the noise brother I tell you we need some pom granates and bells beating beating together like that with a Joyful Noise un the Lord is a witness that God still lives and Reigns amen what kind of witness them witness like that climbed up to that Upper Room here's a kind of witness same kind of the priest now the same kind watch is not bells and PM granat we wear around our garments but what what kind of noise now them Witnesses climbed up in that Upper Room there got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they made a palm granite and the bell get together they staggered like a drunk man under the impact of the Holy Spirit God still got witnesses of the same thing you be by Witnesses of this power in Jerusalem Judea Samaria Jeffersonville Indiana and Mena Louisiana hallelujah what a now brother brandham calls this a beautiful picture of the church today I wonder I wonder if our churches are looking like that walking you know the reason he made them Bells the people on the outset didn't know whether he's a liive H or not unless he was making some noise I'm telling you our dead church that don't make any noise A Something's Happened yes sir they haven't entered into that holies of holies sir get mad at the prophet amen he said them dead churches that don't make any noise they haven't entered into that holies of holies everything you find God you find everywhere you find God you find a lot of noise it's exactly right when Jesus went into Jerusalem they broke down palms and Galilean phants began to to uh sing uh hosana to him that cometh in the name of the Lord some of those Pharisees said oh that makes chills go up my back that's sacreligious make them hold their peace what Jesus said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out something has to take place when Christ comes in so again I'm going to read just a couple of these for you because way too many to bring them all and and and it would be redundant but it's over and over and over listen this is not just one little isolated thing he talks about this is something he brings out all through his ministry even after the seals in fact this is 64 it's strange well it's strange wherever he's at there's always a lot of noise you know noise is a sign of Life remember the high priest when he dressed and went to the holiest of holies on the end of His Garment he had a PM granate in a bell and that noise in the holiest of holies was only way the waiters knew that he was alive or not it made a noise and where there ain't no noise in my he might be dead well I think that's what's a matter with a lot of our churches today there's not enough noise about it not enough enthusiasm not enough something oh where Jesus is there's always a noise one time he come Jerusalem they were screaming hollering hosana to the king they cometh in the name of the Lord some of those priests standing there why make them keep still hold her peace said if they hold her peace the rocks will cry out something has to move move when he's around amen again he talks about it there I tell you what a church lets off its noise and something happens this ass sure the world because everywhere this should kind of Glory is there is noise but you know the thought today is but we're grown up we're mature Christians we are now well we we are we're not babies Pentecostal babies we're the mature bride tree yeah well if that's so and she's mature well guess what in her restoration she got her Joy back so actually lack of joy is a sign of immaturity hello amen you he said the devil ate off the joy of Salvation you people make too much noise Hallelujah so I want you to notice here brother Brandon told us what takes the joy away like that is the devil so what kind of spirit would be anointing people today to say that's right you're making too much noise but I want you to know the brid tree has been restored and the joy of our Salvation is back he has restored to us the joy of our salvation and think of this God gives us Angels food bread from Heaven that tastes so sweet it's just Heavenly amen now that man was kept in in the ark of testimony within the holiest of holies in the presence of the sh sh kind of glory and I want you to think there are three things that must be in your Ark of testimony now remember it was called the testimony or the Arc of testimony so all of these must be in your testimony must be in your art you're a priest these must not be less missing one a supply of Mana the holy ghost that never runs out you're always filled the Holy Ghost remains it doesn't come and go it never breeds worms or stink amen so one number one is a part of Mana representing the Holy Ghost amen and here you have come in the presence of God with the Holy Ghost and your Mana never grows old and it never breathes worms and it never stinks it's still just as good as the day you got it it's still just as fresh as it always was it's still joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah number two the law of God the tablets where God wrote with his finger Amen Let me just bring it down to you you got it too if you if you're a Christian today if you become behind the veil if you are in the holiest of holies you also have in your Ark the tablets he writes in your heart his law in your nature so this must be a part of your testimony I have the law of God living in my heart a bird flies why because of the law within him that's right amen a fish swims why because of the law within him amen now a Christian now keeps the word of God why because the law of God is in him amen so you see you must believe every bit of it you cannot he cannot deny himself amen now the third thing is the staff brother some of you will know exactly where I'm going to Aaron staff amen it was kept in the Arc of testimony what was it it was when a question had come up as to whether he was really chosen of God to be a priest whether this was God's choice or man's Choice cuz they just said hey you're Moses brother and Moses chose you it's a family deal and we won't in on this and God said okay bring all your staffs and bring them in the Hol of holies Aaron bring yours put it there mark them all put it there and and the and the next day Aaron's rod in the the presence of the Shag Glory it came alive amen and what did it do it bore almonds what was that a personal testimony a personal experience a personal Vindication of God every person must have their own experience with God that lays within their Ark amen that you can point back to the time that the old Dead stick that you were came to life Hallelujah and both the fruit that only the Holy Ghost can bear somebody help me preach now so you see you're going to have to have it you're going to have Mana that never fails that never breathe words that never get stank come on that that that 10 years down the road you don't lose your religion you don't turn your back on Christ you don't deny the message you're going to have to have your own personal experience where God vindicates to you you are chosen man didn't choose you this wasn't your idea this was him you're going to have to have his word written in your nature yes amen but we're speaking about Mana this morning mana on that Journey a mixed multitude came that started hating The Bread of Heaven that's right that's right Angels food could you imagine that on the journey there was some that didn't want it no more well brother Tim we're already in the in the we we're already in the canaan's land and we're eating the old corn of the land and the Mana quit listen that's the wrong type we'll type it that way in our next time wrong time mixing your types this Mana can continues to fall God continues pouring out his Spirit until the millennium are you with me it never ceases this Mana came on the day of Pentecost and is forever generation is that right amen so so again you know you're not you can't say well glory to God we're eating the old corner of the land because we're already in the promise no not in this type amen we're still on the journey yes and as long as we're on the journey there's going to be Angels food a fresh supply of it every day amen well brother Tim I've got it in the holiest of holies but let me just tell you I don't keep it from falling out here we still need visions and prophecies and dreams and come on we need visitations from God we need right now to continue pouring out of God's spirit well it only on their flesh well at least it's here to get on their flesh some places it ain't even there to get on their flesh well some they just got emotional wealth thank God we had enough of it till somebody got happy yes sir some didn't go all the way well you're point to them but how many that did go all the way right amen you see on the journey some begin to despise The Bread of Heaven they don't want it no more it becomes despised unwanted in fact they're embarrassed or ashamed of it some of the last things imparted by this messenger was one that they would become ashamed or embarrassed of the new birth experience that's right they wouldn't want none of them tongu speaking acts 238 youngans amen they would be embarrassed that's message churches today cuz it's only moved inward amen you think the rejection is out there all them Leo Deans rejected Christ it has moved right into the message and many are rejecting Christ today they don't want his Spirit Well brother Tim by the year judging them by by by the the atmosphere and whatever and and they're going through a trial it doesn't really matter matter your trial has nothing to do with where you are in Christ and who you are in Christ well our church just ain't in the atmosphere well it's in the responsibility of the ministry to preach the word to lift him up into higher rounds don't stay where you're [Applause] at if I was if I had a dead Church I'd be doing everything I could to preach the word of God to them to tell them don't stay Dead come on in this sh kind of Glory but the Holy Ghost becomes the spies and unwanted and they're embarrassed or ashamed as I said one of his last sermons brother Brandon preached you know you you've heard me say this before but I read a book on Killing Lincoln and it was by um fell by the name O'Reilly and and I I I read it and you know it was the last two weeks or so of Lincoln's life and today Mr Lincoln went here and he did this and he did that and here he addressed the troops and the man who only had so many days to live and you know finally comes right down the last day and him taking his life but you know it was a it was a good historical account ah I would recommend you read it if you want but nevertheless what it did for me is I begin to think okay what about our messenger and what were the last things that God was trying to impart listen let me stop here just a minute this message is not brother Brandon's [Applause] message it was given to brother brandham for us but he was not its source he did not originate it he didn't write it that's to the angel of the church Church of leoda write these things so it was to the angel addressed to the angel of the church the messenger for us are you with me so it is not just a William Brams or brother Bron's message it it is God's message so what were the last things God was trying to impart to us might ought to go back and listen when you think this one who only had this many more sermons to preach in brandom Tabernacle he had only this many more sermons to preach and just just last few things God was going to impart and one of the last things that he would say to the church he warned them his own church don't become ashamed of him so he preaches a message ashamed of him what was it God warning us and and he would say this in there yes you know he warned them that he warned them that we will become ashamed to say yes I've spoke with tongues yes I've seen Vision yes I believe in Divine Healing yes I praise the Lord now but you let a man get a hold of the Hidden Mana in the realm of the Soul where he never leaves that sh of glory and he partakes of that Mana that never goes stale or breeds worms and and he will he will never be ashamed of this Holy Ghost Gospel and so as I quote from ashamed of him a man who has once come in contact with God which is the word and the word has been made plain and manifested to him there's no shamess about that you're not embarrassed it don't embarrass me to say I believe every word of God doesn't embarrass me when the Lord says to say anything and you go say it and do it it don't embarrass me to say I've been filled with the Holy Ghost it don't embarrass me to say I spoke with other tongues it don't embarrass me to say that our Lord has shown me Vision it don't embarrass me to say he's the same yesterday today and forever so the Mana is to be our food it is to be our strength it is to be our source of Vitality until we reach the Millennium amen the Holy Ghost Mana this Holy Ghost is a balanced diet amen everything you need even brother BR said the Rapture is in it so go with me to Numbers Chapter 11 and verse 4 and I want to just read a few things here numbers 11 and four and the mix multitude that was among them fell austing and the children of Israel also wept again and said who will give us flesh to eat we remember the fish which we did Edens and Egypts freely the Cucumbers the melons the leaks the onions and the garlic and now our soul is dried away and there's nothing at all besides this Mana before eyes and the Mana was as a coriander seed and the color thereof was a color of De bellium and and the people went about and gathered it and grounded in the meals or beat it with mortar baked it in pans made cakes of it and the taste of it was as a taste of fresh oil and when the Dew fell in the camp the Mana fell upon it and then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families and every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly Moses also was displeased notice a mixed multitude went out let's just let's just deal with some of this you you see you have Revival and phenomenal Miracles are performed and signs and wonders and a mixed multitude will come along too and impersonate the ones is called even in the isua meeting you know it wasn't long from the outpouring of the spirit and they began to speak in other tongues that impersonators rose up who manufactured their own tongues amen you see what it is is the unconverted people follow because of the supernal and it causes trouble people who are sinners now I'm quoting this from brother Brandon people who are sinners who don't accept the Lord Jesus can still enjoy seeing the moving of the miracle of God Healing The Sick can rejoice in people doing right can open their hearts and rejoice in a sermon that was preached under the anointing and that's the same time type of Mana that the Christian is eating so notice notice again as he said these they can come and enjoy seeing a miracle enjoy enjoy um you know people rejoicing and rejoicing doing right and and can even open their hearts and rejoice in a sermon that is preached under the anointing and yet be a part of a mixed multitud amen now men and women who come to church and profess to be Believers and they're not Believers now wait a minute we done come a long ways yes we found it in the Pulpit we found that in the in the deacons we found that in church members who said I'm a beli believer and professed to be a Believers and they were never Believers amen they were just carnal and just as soon as a little strain come maybe a little question on the message maybe you know a little doubting here or there next thing they go right back to Egypt amen they want the garlic pots they want the fish out the river they want the leak the garlic they want things that they had down in Egypt and the Bible said if you love the world or the things of the of the world the love of the father is not in you you see it never was there let them go through a trial and you'll find out what they're made out of you see no matter how much you try to pretend when it comes a strain a man will show his best and worst Parts but you take a Christian a really born again Christian put him under strain you watch how he acts you can tell what he's made of you see anybody can praise the Lord while the holy spirit's inv fallen in a Congregation of people but let trouble rise and watch what takes place amen now brother bradam ask are you one of the mixed multitude are you the person as the street expression says can't take it that's it you can't stand up to it brother if you're that way backslidings ups and downs ins and out why why don't you come to Calvary and die yourselves and be born again of the spirit of God shame on you you profess you people who profess to be Christians and live something else that you're not here in an ettt to the Society of the Lord Jesus Christ you who profess to be a Christian and shame to take him at his word and testify to his power and His glory when he comes you're an indent to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so so again the these are things that that he spoke about and he brought out these these and the types you know we we remember isn't it strange they didn't remember the bondage yeah they didn't remember their daughters being pulled out and you know Liv like concubines with some somebody else they didn't they didn't remember they didn't remember the slave belts and and and the humility ition and the hard task all they remembered was the leaks the garlic the good things yes sir you know that that can happen in a church right you know have a little fuss rise up in the church you know and it gets something started like a cancer and it'll it'll kill the whole church and then those are the times you know you know they don't remember they don't remember the blessings that God gave they don't remember the deliverance from sin they don't remember how that once they were a drug addict or a dopehead or whatever else it's like a man that come to me and he was all upset he's all upset because that the the church had decided to put a parking only for the pastor in the parking lot and he was upset ready to leave the church and of course you know sometimes a pastor you know situations comes and whatever and he maybe arrives late or whatever and I said I I was listening this man talked to me about it and I said don't you remember don't you remember when you were a drunk don't you remember when you were a drunker out there in the the world and you came among Believers and and you were just happy to be with Believers just happy to be with with with Holy Ghost filled people and you know you you just felt so privileged and honored don't you remember when when you needed a pastor and you prayed for a pastor and you got a pastor and God gave you a pastor and now you don't even want to give him a parking place I said what is wrong what's wrong with this picture you know you get into these places and these things that you don't remember what God gave you where he brought you from the slavery that was down in Egypt and what God did to deliver you amen the ministry that God brought you in nurtured in a time of Hallelujah of trouble you begin to hate the the Mana that's being preached you begin to disdain the moving of the spirit of God you begin to desire the leaks and the garlics of the world Amen all of these things can happen you know what we need as brother Brandon said an old pent oldfashioned Pentecostal Backwoods in killing Revival amen with the power of God back in the church oh they were they were just eating Angel's food but they still wanted the garlic wanted to go back to the old garlic pots it showed they wasn't ready to go to Canaan amen somebody said to me well brother Tim my my daughter went out into sin and oh she's done some awful things I said well you know look on the bright side of it what's a bright side she found out she wasn't what she claimed that's right now she can start over amen as long as she was sitting self-righteous in the church and everything's all right and I'm going to heaven and I got the Holy Ghost and and now you found out what you really had aren't you glad that the Rapture didn't take place back there you wouldn't have [Applause] wi amen now so you see but they became much discouraged along the way numbers 30 21 and and five says and the people spake against God hey you know when you stop speaking against the moving of the Spirit when you speak against his gifts when you speak against Divine Healing altar calls prayer lines you're not speaking against me you're speaking against God that ain't my message this is God's message you you know you're you're you're not you're not coming against evening like Tabernacle no you're coming against God they became and they began to speak against God numbers 21 and5 and against Moses the leadership wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in this Wilderness for there is no bread neither is there no any water and our soul loatheth Angels food bread from heaven we hate it we hated and brother Brandon said when it comes it comes like the upper room with an old outpouring of the Holy Spirit and people get they get saturated with it and get joy in their heart come on and people despise it Angels food bread from Heaven Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost and a mixed multitude gets sick and tired of it lothus mean means a sickening dread I I I just dread going to church they're just going to expect me to be a priest in worship and offer a sacrifice of praise can you imagine that's what they're expecting of me I know I know they will I I know but I'm sick of it I'm just tired of that I'm tired of services like that I I just like it be well remember there more times in in Egypt down in our Catholic church we just said hell mares and jumped up and down a few times on our knees and that was it and we got out in 15 minutes you remember remember those old times and Presbyterians and oh how reverent it was wasn't even a sound you know there was never an amen or hallelujah or glory to God or nothing like that don't you remember how it was down in Egypt don't you remember how how it was you know we you know we back then we had that good old easy believism you just believe the message is right and you got the Holy Ghost there was no dying out to sin there was no weeping and snotting down in an altar there was no there was no real you know no need for real repentance we was oh that that's I tell you I tell you little SA ology that made us feel good a good my goodness you know wouldn't it be great if every once in a while we at least could have once a month anyhow maybe a little more often you know a a a good old you know good old sermon you know that would make us feel good and lift us up and you know a a good gal stream meeting that we we could have and we just all you know just clap our hands and go feeling how great I am you see they get weary of the word a Mana with full vitamins everything needed for the journey brother Brandon said in the message count down in 64 when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost there is something in him that is full of God's spiritual vitamins that makes him shout and praise God and act different because why he's no longer out Earthbound he's in the heavens sailing around in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now let me just say you know and I know leaks onions and garlic they're not main courses they're just to flavor the food and so the gospel has been flavored by additions of Egypt's garlic who whoever sat down please don't raise your hand please don't but who ever sat down just to have a bowl of garlic you know they flavor food that they have a distinct taste so you get them variety you know you get Mexican food and Italian food and Indian food all or you know maybe the same Meats some of the same veggies or whatever but they have a different taste different flavor right and it comes from it comes from the the seasoning and the same true people crave certain foods we have Baptist flavors Methodist flavors Pentecostal flavors whatever you're liking and we have flavored the message with all kinds of flavor we want garlic of perusia or a lusen for th you know Coleman's Thunders or another Lust For headquarters in Jeffersonville or you know you know but the true Mana from Heaven has a distinct taste and it tastes like Wafers with honey try a little garlic on that man try a little garlic try try try to Munch an onion while while eating while eating this sweet wafer you're either crazy or you're pregnant hello but we have a Mana today that we can have food amen that is not tainted by man's flavor it's not got additions come on from Egypt amen it's a Mana without seed or bones in it it's Wafers that come down from heaven covered over with the sweetness of Heaven like David said it tastes like Honey in the Rock Hallelujah brother Brandon would always bring it around to this he said David a Shepherd boy knew to put honey on certain rocks for the mineral value and when the Sheep licked the honey he got the minerals from The Rock and he said when we put the honey on the Rock Christ Jesus sin and troubl go away when you lick on that rock healing is available for every sick sheep when you lick on the [Applause] Rock oh I hope there's a house full of people that loves that sweet Heavenly man but you know he would say to the ages now watch this is quoting brother Brandon but there's something I got against you and that is you left your first love you left that love you once had for them good oldfashioned Holy Ghost meetings and you begin to kind of slide backwards into that formal old come in with our father nonsense so that's how the devil got in the book of Acts church this is the way that brother Brandon describes it in the second seal some of them wanted a little more class to the message a little more finesse a little something more a little bit more refined something that is sophisticated and and so we become intellectual teachers instead of anointed preachers you see he never told us to go teach the gospel but to go preach the gospel and I'm quoting brother Brandon from Christ the mystery he said in other words demonstrate the power and these signs shall follow them that believe just teaching doesn't do it it takes actual Spirit itself demonstrating these signs but you know the first thing you know we become very educated and very refined in the message and we were going to preach the Deep things of God and buddy we later out here and there and you know and and the next thing you know speaking in tongues was baby talk and gifts of the Spirit was only for the immature and the the Holy Ghost well you know that was just dismissed as just to just just in a refined cultured way of just saying I believe the message and you got now now look Church you know I'm telling you the truth there's some of you been in those moves you know what I'm talking about Andy you know you know exactly what I'm talking about the Holy Ghost teaching of course Holy Ghost teaching is all right we want Holy Ghost anointed teachers it's needed in the body but but much of our teaching has come from the wisdom of man without any anointing to it and the Bible said they would keep to themselves teachers you know having itch and ears in other words the people pull on them to tell them what they want to hear you see real teaching uh is not educating real teaching is not intellectual stimulation true teaching settles the heart in faith and causes you to believe every word of God teaching is not dry lectures teaching must be anointed brother Bram said and we would see Jesus after the seals he said are you lecturing Jesus never said go into all the world and teach this or teach that he said go into all the world and preach the gospel preaches to demonstrate the power of God these signs have follow them it don't come by lecture that's right see that believe it doesn't come by by lectures it comes by uh it comes by the presence of the Living God moving among in human flesh proving himself he's the same yesterday today and forever that he never fails to be the same it comes so simple the Simplicity of it is what drives the intellectual mind away from it so again this is what Paul said I didn't come to you with Excellency of speech of our wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God you see when you get people's their faith standing in the wisdom of man well we understand the seals and we understand the Thunders and we've got this Revelation and we got an understanding greater than anybody else and your your faith is in that you see it will never stand you're going to fall away but your faith has got to be in the power of God I know I met him I know I had an experience I know he changed my life I have that testimony where my dead stick amen it came in the presence of God and it bore almonds I've got that witness in my life I know he's the same yesterday today and forever brother Brandon said we got people can stand up and explain the word in such a way it's just breathtaking but we find it's still just a lecture see it's the mechanics and that's the trouble we have had the mechanics and we have had it for 60 years going over and over and over and over you know this and that and looking at how the card work how carburetor works and how the valves are timed and making sure sure everything is exactly right and you know all of this and we fiddle fadle with it until it won't run amen we played around with it until it won't drive to Divine Healing and the sick lay sick come on Amen we've got to have a faith a greater Faith you say brother Tim that was for the Divine Healing movement no sir amen the change of our body is nothing but just more d power of the same Divine Healing and if there is no Divine Healing there is no Resurrection amen that's exactly right now instead of having preachers we got lectures men who know the word just as well can put it together in such a way it's astounding how they can do it they know the mechanics but that ain't the Dynamics we want the Dynamics I'm quoting brother brand I don't care about the mechanics I want to know the Dynamics that's amen I don't know how the car runs out there it's got piston cylinder I don't know how much pressure it's used the only thing I know is a dynamic put her out there and drive it sir that's what we know God made the promise I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy how's he going to do it I can't tell you I just know the Dynamics of God's system I'll tell you what that's what the prophet wanted amen that's what we ought to want we I I believe I believe we have the mechanics I believe things are set in order I believe that we got the mysteries of God revealed in this day and our but they need to be quickened in our lives amen we need Faith to rise up in us when we see this sick something Rises up and but our God made a promise amen we're not just going to let the sick lay sick we're going to believe we're going to call Heaven down amen oh God help us to realize friend we're not in this alone we are not by ourself but a host of angels is on our side and the host on the other side are screaming out keep pressing the battle keep pressing the battle you don't know what's laying at the end of the road oh God let me get to the end that's what I say sometimes I get so weary of this I say Lord just let me get to the end I'm here I I don't know I don't know how far we are into this hour of Darkness but we pressed in we have keep pressing on keep pressing on I don't know church I don't know if it'll end in 2024 I don't know if it'll be over in in 20 uh 27 I don't know when it's going to be amen all I know to do is keep pressing put another fo forward put another arrow in my bow stuck the enemy one more time amen stand on righteousness preach the truth amen call Heaven down let the Holy Spirit move that's all I know to do I don't know how it's all going to wind up I don't know when it's going to be I just know he said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and he can't leave us behind you see back there that back there with how the devil got in the book of Acts Church the Holy Ghost was poured out on ignorant unlearned people and slaves you know like the Ethiopian unic the poor of the land they testify their their bosses who saw the Miracles and signs and wonders The Works of the supernatural that's good and those bosses testified to their friends the celebrities the great up and UPS the Mayors the doctors whoever they were you know more sophisticated more sophisticated and they just couldn't bring them down to that old dingy Hall and that meeting you know remember the early church didn't have fine temples of worship but this God didn't meet in temples made with hands but a body has I prepared and he dwells in humans fine buildings and beautiful temples are not evidence of his presence well brother Tim you sure got a nice church here well let me tell you compared to what Rome has he a 10 can box and I'm thankful I was in you know you know some some guy come to me some time ago you know and said back to them dimly lit places and back to them I said wait a minute I I've been to dimly that places I don't know what you're talking about like we didn't come through that I said I bet through dimly lit places I've been where there was six light buls no AC no indoor toilets I've been in those places where you burn on one side and cold on the other from an old Barrel heater I've been in those places I know what dimly lit places are amen we we don't forget we don't forget our humbl beginnings amen we're not we're not an exalted people we're not don't have a greater Ministry cuz we have a nice church and I'm thankful for the nice church but let me tell you God doesn't meet in people in in in buildings made with hand but a body has prepared we're not trying to get a building ready for a Rapture we're trying to get you ready for a Rapture amen for God to come and live in your building where you have an arc of testimony and brother brandom said and I quote they couldn't bring him to a place where they were meeting in a little dirty dingy Hall clap their hands and Shout speaking in tongues getting messages he'd never believe it like that he's got to dress it up so what did the nickol of an age asked for it asked to get away from this bunch of people that shouts and clap their hands looks disgracefully like they did on Pentecost like drunk man act like drunk men staggering in the spirit they didn't want none of that they they said they were drunk and when the celebrity listen don't miss this it may sound crazy to you but it's the truth when the dignitaries began to come in they couldn't stoop to that so what they become embarrassed you know who is this mixed multitude there were people who were never called to leave Egypt but just went along and their heart was still in Egypt it was never in the promised land you see like like lot God called Abraham but Abraham called lot you you see they here they are can you imagine they are leaving the flesh pots and garlic in Egypt to eat Angels food and was still complaining leaving the boasting Physicians of Egypt say the days of Miracles are passed there's no such thing as Miracles no more and they go out to be with the people who who believe in the signs follen with sign of the king in the camp great wonders and signs a pillar of Fire hanging over them the blessings of fallen and spirits of Mana out of heaven and still grumbling insult to their maker the modern day would be oh every Wednesday night prayer meeting oh every Sunday morning back to the church what do we hear same thing the preachers stand up and preach songs and going back and then you're then you're just going on as a line of duty you're not a worshiper a worshiper goes there to worship to express himself before his God to praise God for his goodness to every word he hangs on to it amen oh my it's a precious word It's a Wonderful truth amen what's it taste like brother Tim he said honey weers with honey brother bre said I tell you I've seen the saints of God so drunk upon it till they live lick their lips and say good there's something about honey amen that's the way you're supposed to be but you know it becomes very common and what am I saying to you today don't let meetings like this become common don't let it just be another Sunday morning service don't let it just be another denominational Gathering or like a denominational Gathering amen real iiz Mana is going to be coming down from heaven Angels food and what I want to do I want to welcome it amen I want to I want to realize God's doing something special for me hey it's special what you got that's the seals have been open the Thunders have uttered their voices the Mysteries have been revealed and your recipients of it Hallelujah and it doesn't have any denominational flavor out of it God made sure it was a Pure Clean unadulterated word of God and you ought to be able to taste it and that feels good and get so drunk on it CU it's Anointed with the Holy Ghost get so drunk on it but when a man or woman begins to complain about going to church they're get they're so tired of going to Church they're not ready for the journey it breed worms and it's stank it's death in the pot it's killing the church takes the life right out of it somebody went and got a weed of psychology you know what I'm talking about right Elisha and them that's they were trying to gather some food one of the preachers one of the young men went out and he picked some wild gourds and they got to taste them and said there's death in this pot this is going to kill us all they cried out to the prophet somebody's mixed death in this pot listen this is a problem this is a problem today there's too much death in the pot too many poisoned amen amen come on somebody went and got a weed of psychology I'll tell you now psychology is a weed that too many of our preachers are smoking hello and they've incorporated into the diet of the church are you with me amen and what is it they mix that in there hybridize this and you know mix this idea and what Dobson says and what this says or what some what some theologians said we don't need it mixed stuff we already got a Mana without seedar bones if you want flavored Mana get out there to the denomination that's where it's flavored but not here amen we don't want it flavored we want D say it the Lord we want the pure unadulterated word we want God in his power we want everything that's in the book we want what God Said Amen we're going to stick with what God Said Hallelujah oh my you know some have emphasized Greek words Greek words we need a few Greek lessons we're going to educate you on a Greek word here's a new Greek word for the week you know they tried that with brother Brandon a Baptist man said brother Brandon we'll never have Revival until we get the Bible exactly right we got to go back and examine the Greek and you know word by word and letter by letter and find the Greek interpretation what the Greeks said he said man they've been arguing about the Greek cian Council it's not to know the Greek is life it's to know him that's life amen you see Wild GS death in the pot but what did he do to remedy that he said he took a handful of meal and that meal represented Christ and it was all ground with the same Bur made it in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he took that and put it back in the pot put it in the pot and it healed the po took the poison out you want the poison of false Doctrine out amen put Jesus Christ back in the church the same yesterday today and forever the same in power the same anointing the same Holy Ghost the same as always come on Jesus Christ the same and it healed the pot [Applause] hallelujah amen but you know some they get a taste of the Mana and before the next Revival they got to go out and get renewed again so they run from revival to Revival they run from camp meeting to camp meeting now camp meeting is okay Revival meens are okay that's what they used to call special meetings was Revival those are okay they're fine but you know in between revivals if your experience is dropping out and you're losing what you had you need to go further with God it's okay to go to re rival sure go go there encourage somebody else lift them up amen e even even eat some more Mana Rejoice ever more are you with me but friends if you're if it's running out from meeting to meeting then go a little further when God than you went die out to sin because you see there's too many that are like a broken system that can hold no watch so they wa they first of all a a sister has to wait for for Revival Reigns to get filled up and you know we had one down at the farm in PL de when I was a boy well mosquitoes would breed in we had an old screen up there that would keep the leaves out of it and you know it ran off the top of the house and and and whatever and went there the well the well was always going dry in that place and so you could never never depend on on good fresh water so you had to have sister water too and that sist water they you know the rain would come and you know the chickens rusted on that Barn then the you get the drift you know the the dirt kicked up from the plow and everything's on that Barn it all washes right down into the sistern well you just got a screen where you screen the leaves out and now you got cyan water don't drink he'll give you the trots amen but you see I mean it's death in the pot amen and and that's the way a lot of people are but it can be even worse Jeremiah said because they have sisters and they're broken and they hold no water so they're worse off than a sister that's right because they don't even have Revival Waters so that's what brother bradam would talk about broken sister and he said these sister would be filled up from revival to Revival listen you're not to be a sistern you are to be a well of Living Water springing up up to everlasting life come on something on the inside of you pushing out Hallelujah it'll push out sin it'll push out unbelief will push out whirling amen and also out of it will come a bubbling out of you the joy of the Lord hallelujah that no man created but it's coming because there's a life that is down on the inside of you pushing it out you're still happy because the spirit of God is in there and it's bubbling forth praise the Lord now you can go into this and I'm just going to take take maybe the next few minutes just to deal with it but let me read this quote yesterday's Mana is contaminated I hear people say 40 years ago I did so and so that's right but what about today what about the church on fire we talk about yesterday what about the church today what about you as an individual today for yesterday's won't do for today it was all right yesterday so again he talked about the light and he said it all must blend together and he said what it ought to have done was blend with it and went on to make the perfect loaf of bread went to make perfect perfect manner of God but now as we as as I just bring it down here for a moment and I I want to bring some of these points because I don't want to pick it up again but he he talks about this in the messages Eagle stirs her nest some of the brothers have touched on this I've had this in my notes for the last six weeks probably just trying to get to this but he talks about this and Eagle stirs her nest and he and and and right down to the end like SE not a with the shuck anointed ones in the end time all the message he brings his principle out and that is how that an eagle is meant to fly in the heavenlies and how that God is like an eagle and he and an eagle doesn't want his little family his little chicks Little Eagles little eaglets to be Earthbound so you know it's it's a time that they're in the nest but there comes a time that they have to leave the nest and Learn to Fly amen amen now so he he goes on to talk about this and and he equates it with the church he he uses the pattern of the hop The Hop he he types with Pentecost said they they've got where that they just vulture down on things they waiting for a a dead rabbit there on the road to eat and they're wait they're they're waiting to find something like that they want they don't have fresh Mana but he said that's not the way the eagle is to be his Eagle is to be always fresh where the carcass is the eagle Shall Gather you said well now brother Tim uh Eagles are vultures too they'll eat dead things well of course of course any any animal will be forced out of his habitat but if it gets his preference a a a real a real Eagle especially the golden eagle it will it wants fresh it wants to kill it fresh he doesn't really vulture eyesee down now if he's hungry he'll do anything I used to raise Dairy goats and people don't understand about goats they think they're nasty but a goat would not drink it would not drink my goats would not drink out of water that was stale they would not drink out of water that was contaminated if they stuck their feet in a accidentally stuck their feet in a grain pan and and got a a little bit of their foot in there and and messed around in the grain pan they would not eat it they were clean animals and so but if you forc them out of their habitat if you force them out of their natural ways you can force a goat I saw in Africa drink out of a mud puddle because there was no other source are you with me so they can be forced to an eagle there can be forced out of hunger starvation and the eating things that it would that it doesn't prefer but it prefers the fresh killed meat are you with me and brother brother brandham Todd went to Great Lengths and preaching about this and he said what it is he said that the the the thing that they're trying to eat on is Mana from another day and they're not taking the fresh killed meat of the word the message of the hour are you with me so they vultz down like that and they just hop from carcass to carcass to carcass like that and he said the hawk which is a lesser brother to the eagle it's like the Pentecostal they just hoop from one carcass to the other and doing that he said I saw a hawk there doing that the other day listen let me tell you again let me tell you again friends you know many of them they would prefer to have the right meat but it ain't available to them that's right but that's not your problem that's right God has given you the fresh meat of the word and the way that you want it this is the way we want it we want it so fresh we want it so fresh that when the Ripper of the beak pars it open the blood flows and when the blood flows it gets all over the eagle amen that's the way you want it you want the Holy Ghost full of life until the life of God comes all over you as you eat of the word as you pull on it here it comes the blood flows Hallelujah when you get out of church everybody knows you've been worshiping everybody knows you're a worshipper come on because they see blood off all over you amen you ought to be able to leave the church house this morning and everybody know you have been with Jesus Hallelujah that blood got all over you that his life flowed all over you and that it speaks let me tell you this Blood speaks oh yes hallelujah praise the Lord prise the Lord amen yes so not less of Christ more Christ amen but the perfect word now coming down brother Timothy brought it out in one of his sermons but he talks about an eagle doesn't want his his little eaglets to be Earthbound builds his nest way up high makes it where that he gets up there and then there Comes A Time where he wants to take it on a flight well some say well brother Tim there ain't no Eagle that ever took a bird another eaglet on the flight well all I know is is God said I carried you on wings like an eagle all I know is in Revelation chap 12 he said and he gave and he gave the woman two wings as an eagle that's to fly to fly Old and New Testament all I know is is that this Eagle will bear you upon its wings amen carry you in the heavenlies and then drop you off amen so that you will yeah so that you will learn how to fly I wonder if God ain't doing that to some of us let some things happen in our lives that makes us have to exercise our wings amen man to use our faith a little bit come on church and he said is those Eagles there those little eaglets they'll go tumbling down on the inside over and over and whatever he said now they get out of order but let them fly they're trying to learn how to fly and he said don't worry about them getting out of order the the mother Eagle will come back with her two Wings Hallelujah and bear them back up the grace again I'm not worrying about order I'm wanting to see eagles fly I want them to see that all things are possible I want them to see Jesus Christ is real I want them to see they can have the same Holy Ghost they had on the day of Pentecost I want them to have the same Mana the same Holy Ghost the same outpouring I want to see them have Mana that never grows stale our breed worms let's stand together hallu you said well brother Tim that's just not happening where we are well then go and you beyond the camp listen to this I'll just let the the prophet answer for you now in this Camp miracles signs and wonders was in this Camp they moved them out to the Wilderness they left the natural Camp they left the mud Camp they left the the camp made with straw and brick to dwell in tents out in the wilderness where there was no grain or nothing else sometimes God ask us to do foolish things our own thinking and if you'll ever leave the camp of your own reason that's the place you'll find God now as soon as they went out in the wilderness there was Miracle signs when they moved out in this Camp remember they left Egypt's Camp moved out of the Wilderness with God's Camp how do you know it was God said your people sojourn for 400 years years but I'll bring them out with a mighty hand I'll give them this land here and there they were on the road by Vindicated light a Vindicated Prophet with signs and wonders that God was in the camp and they were there on their Road they had a pillar of fire they had a prophet they had Mana they had Living Waters they had changed campgrounds you remember when you did Brother Gary you left those campgrounds out there to come to campgrounds amen where that there was miracles signs and wonders amen they had to change campgrounds in order to see the supernatural so will the people of this day have to change the camp from them denominations that say the days of Miracles has passed there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost all these other scriptures are wrong and they work for they work for another age you have to change your Campground and be go beyond the camp where all things things are possible Mana that will never grow stale if your Mana is rotten if your experience has got warmy if you allowed bitterness in your life if you allow things that shouldn't be come on in a little further come on into the presence of God God come where the do drops of Mercy are bright where that the Mana never ceases want you to Bow your heads together with me you tired of being mixed multitude [Music] tired of being complainer murmer the journey is so hard things are so difficult you want your joy back you can have that Joy Jesus Christ is our Living Hope you want that peace that surpasses all understanding you want to be able to love your enemy you want to be able to love God and hate sin I get I get embarrassed I get embarrassed talk about embarrassed I get embarrassed I see so-called Christian see a girl that out in some skimpy dress I'm talking about supposed to be a believer some kind of skimpy garment dress above the knees or doing something they shouldn't be doing or maybe in a bathing suit all these likes and oh you look so adorable or pictures of them with full of makeup oh you're so adorable you're so cute how manyan likes what in the world is wrong how in the world could you do that of course you don't want to get on there and say something derogatory but sometimes I wonder if you couldn't just be a witness and step up and say look we ought to present Christ before the world and this in Christ do you love the world you love the things of the world the love the father is not in you there is Mana there's a place that you can have this Mana that your experience will never grow stale no more never breed worms you cannot ever be classified as lukewarm cold and formal because it's bubbling up into eternal life it's right behind the veil you got to go beyond your veil of reasoning got to go beyond that Veil that says days of Miracles are passed God don't do anything like that anymore we can't live like that that's just you know we just have to take a denominational life you got to go beyond those veils because there at Calvary he told tore down the veils to seek Christ The Living Christ since Calvary man has put up their own veils God is not veiling himself away from you the Mighty God is unveiled before us this is the unveiling of God but what has veiled is denominational theories of men want to hide God from you come on past them come on into his presence ask God ever more Lord give us this bread from heaven let it Satisfy My thirsting Soul pour a fresh on me Lord but in the inner Veil where I just get another handful if I'm hungry I don't have to wait for Revival I don't have to wait for a special move in the church it's there all the time whether I'm up or whether I'm down whether it's trouble all the same time I'm constant on the inside because my light never grows dim the Mana never goes stale and there's always evidence a reminder of how he changed my life father bless these words today bless them to the hearts of your children may they just move into your presence today and in a in a real and Living Way I pray oh God if there be among us any of a heart that has got embarrassed or maybe they remember leaks or garlic or they looked over and seen what others have with their leaks and garlic they want that may they come back to you today may they be a full surrender of their lives in Jesus name amen amen [Music] Lord I Lift It Up come and quench and
