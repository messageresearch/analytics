========================================

tonight we're going to be speaking about healing divine healing in the lord's supper now god has an attitude towards sickness and he showed that attitude in jesus christ now jesus told us to cast out demons of afflictions he did not tell us to live with them amen and since sickness is a demon it doesn't glorify god you ever hear of a demon glorifying god no so it doesn't glorify god for us to live with demons jesus commissioned us to cast them out that is the work the principle work of the church is to cast satan out amen now there are two basic parts to the communion we have right here before us and there are two parts to it there is the bread there is the wine and of course for the passover there were two parts of the passover there was the lamb and the body of the lamb there was to be a lamb slain its blood was to be applied to the doorposts of every house it was to identify them as being under god's covenant of protection god said the blood shall be for you for a token where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you how many remembers that amen and the plague shall not come upon you to destroy you you see this represents in type our identification by faith with the blood of jesus christ the lamb so now we're being justified by faith by his blood we are saved from the wrath that is to come amen so that's number one but number two second thing is every israelite had to eat the lamb's flesh amen and this was for a different reason this was not for protection from sin nor the death angel this was for physical strength for the journey eating the lamb was for physical strength amen for physical strength if the deliverance from slavery then meant healing for the body also did delivery tonight from the slavery of sin must provide for healing also you can't have one without the other amen if you've got if you got the wine you got to have the bread to go with it if you got the blood of the lamb you got to have the body of the lamb to go with it so you see there has to be divine healing that is included in the promise now if it was in the passover then and we now have a greater lamb and a greater passover then healing must be provided in this passover eating the lamb's flesh had nothing to do with the passing of the destroyer the blood was the sign of the token when i see the blood i'll pass over you you see the destroyer had no authority to touch that house amen israel was beginning a journey and as they started that journey which is a type of our own christian journey amen god planned that his children for that journey would be well and to be strong for this journey and i want you to know tonight that's still god's plan god wants you to be well god wants you to be healthy god wants a people that believes his word and proclaims that word for our own healing and deliverance it's god's desire for you said third john 1 and 2 said beloved i wish above all things that might prosper and be in health even as our soul prospers god wants you to be well it's the wrong thinking god wants you to suffer god wants you to be healed amen so while this is for god's glory it might result in god's glory but god don't get any glory out of you being sick god gets glory when you're healed when he was took those stripes when he was beat on the head with a rod amen for everyone that had a headache or that has a headache or is troubled with headaches are you here tonight amen jesus took the beatings on his head and received headaches in your stead so that you could be healed you say i've got back pain he took stripes on his back so that your back could be healed you say i've got footprints he took the nails in his feet so that by what he suffered at calvary you can be free from the sickness that wants to come against your body for by whose stripes we were healed
