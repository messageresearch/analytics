[29:33] leave that with your pastor and whatever
[29:35] you all do in your church i'm not going
[29:37] to even argue with that but right here
[29:40] at this campground you'll go by our
[29:42] rules
[29:43] and uh and so if you don't have any
[29:46] if you don't have any um uh rules that
[29:49] maybe at your church for this or that

[49:35] ministered in that meeting for us
[49:38] we had just got acquainted the year
[49:40] before and
[49:42] i invited him to the spring camp for
[49:44] that year but the daniel williams and i
[49:47] agreed to have him
[49:49] there for the camp
[49:54] and the holy spirit moved in such a way
[49:56] it was such a dynamic
[49:59] moving of the holy spirit there was
[50:01] there was
[50:02] victory in the camp there was more than
[50:04] victory
[50:06] as far as just jumping shout there were
[50:08] lives that were changed completely

[54:42] amen
[54:44] we're so so happy to be gathered
[54:46] together here tonight
[54:50] post post-covered
[54:53] post troubles
[54:55] post heartaches
[54:57] we were saved before kovac came
[55:00] we're still saved after covet is gone
[55:03] no matter what satan throws at us we are
[55:06] more than conquerors
[55:09] it's such an honor to be able to to be
[55:11] with you i wanted to say before we
[55:13] read how much i
[55:15] appreciate brother tim
[55:17] and his
[55:18] church and
[55:20] all the
[55:21] workers that makes this possible for all
[55:23] these many many years that they've done
[55:26] this
[55:27] i want to be standing near one day
[55:30] when my little buddy walks up before the
[55:32] throne of god and the lord goes to
[55:35] reward him
[55:36] and no doubt many of you will stand
[55:38] right there and say
[55:39] i got the holy ghost
[55:41] i was saved
[55:43] i was delivered
[55:45] thank you about tim
[55:47] we appreciate all the efforts and all of
[55:50] that to make it possible
[56:02] god bless you listen tonight if you
[56:04] would to the book of ephesians chapter 6
[56:06] verse 13.
[56:08] i know you're tired many of you
[56:10] driven today flew in today you're tired
[56:14] and
[56:15] worn so i'll keep that in mind as we
[56:18] start for the service tonight
[56:20] but we know that we'll never
[56:23] ever be gathered quite like this again
[56:26] even if the lord tarries another year
[56:28] and there'd be another spring
[56:30] camp
[56:31] probably some of you would not be able
[56:32] to be here maybe myself brother tim
[56:35] brother ron we don't know
[56:37] so we want to take advantage of this
[56:38] time
[56:40] every moment that we're together and see
[56:42] what the lord will do
[56:45] this is a very um
[56:47] famous portion of scripture as far as in
[56:49] the book of ephesians
[56:50] it's called the panoply of god which
[56:53] basically means
[56:54] dealing with the armor
[56:56] of god but i think it's very fitting for
[56:59] the day that we're living
[57:01] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[57:03] of god that you may be able to withstand
[57:06] in the evil day
[57:09] and having done all
[57:11] to stand
[57:12] stand
[57:13] therefore
[57:14] and this is how we will do it
[57:17] having your loins
[57:18] gird about with truth
[57:21] having on the breastplate
[57:23] of righteousness
[57:25] and your feet shod with the preparation
[57:28] of the gospel of peace
[57:30] above all taking the shield of faith
[57:33] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[57:36] all the fiery darts
[57:38] of the wicked
[57:40] and take the helmet of salvation
[57:44] and the sword of the spirit
[57:46] which is
[57:47] the word of god
[57:48] now i'd also like to read to you from
[57:52] satan's eden paragraph 13.
[57:54] i love the way that
[57:56] brother branham approached this
[57:59] he's had a few meetings there in
[58:01] jeffersonville and he says i wanted to
[58:03] speak to you something
[58:05] to bring something to you to enlighten
[58:08] you
[58:09] to the promise of god
[58:11] for this age
[58:13] something not something that somebody
[58:15] else was and some other day
[58:17] them things are all right and we all
[58:20] refer to those things but i thought
[58:23] i would try to bring something
[58:25] to your mind
[58:27] in these scriptures that i've got
[58:28] written down
[58:30] that would enlighten you
[58:33] to know
[58:34] and to make you a better soldier
[58:37] in the field
[58:39] that you're fighting in now
[58:41] to learn
[58:42] the tactics
[58:44] of the enemy
[58:46] so that you can block
[58:48] everything
[58:50] that gets to you
[58:52] see that's the main thing he said
[58:55] if you get time sometime do a search on
[58:58] that how many times that he said that
[59:00] that's the main thing
[59:02] a lot of the things that we think are
[59:03] the main thing are not the main thing at
[59:06] all
[59:07] but this is what he said is one of the
[59:09] main things
[59:10] that that's the main thing is to learn
[59:14] to keep the punches
[59:16] off
[59:17] of you
[59:19] as much
[59:20] as you can
[59:22] so the main thing is to be able to learn
[59:25] to keep the punches
[59:27] off of you as much as you can now
[59:29] remember brother branham when he was
[59:31] younger he was a boxer
[59:34] now most of us of course have not boxed
[59:36] too much but for him
[59:38] saying this
[59:40] would have had such a powerful meaning
[59:42] because the more punches you take the
[59:46] weaker you are
[59:47] the more punches you do the more you
[59:50] surrender
[59:51] that secrecy about yourself
[59:54] and your enemy watches you
[59:57] and he learns your tactics so you're
[1:00:00] sparring he's learning you're fighting
[1:00:02] he's learning so the main thing is
[1:00:05] keeping it all we thank god for the
[1:00:07] blood of jesus that forgives us when we
[1:00:09] do wrong don't we
[1:00:11] but i appreciate the holy ghost that can
[1:00:13] so live in our lives that can keep us
[1:00:16] from doing wrong in the first place
[1:00:19] now the majority of christendom that's
[1:00:21] where they live in this age we're living
[1:00:23] so it's constantly about repentance
[1:00:25] their songs are constantly written about
[1:00:27] the mercy of god the grace of god which
[1:00:29] basically they have no power to help
[1:00:31] them overcome the world so they're
[1:00:33] constantly thinking
[1:00:34] for the blood the blood does this that's
[1:00:36] what the blood's for they say it's to
[1:00:40] god knows you're going to make mistakes
[1:00:41] and you're going to live awful so they
[1:00:42] say so the blood's there to forgive you
[1:00:44] so you just basically go ahead and do it
[1:00:47] that's not what the lord jesus died for
[1:00:50] he died to redeem us from the power of
[1:00:53] the devil
[1:00:55] amen
[1:00:56] and we'd like to be remembered tonight
[1:00:58] as we pray
[1:00:59] god bless you let's bow our heads
[1:01:01] together
[1:01:03] heavenly father it's such an honor to be
[1:01:05] able to stand here lord and
[1:01:07] address these young men and young women
[1:01:11] lord some their parents and grandparents
[1:01:13] also here
[1:01:15] lord not only those in the visible
[1:01:17] audience but those that are invisible
[1:01:19] different time zones around the world
[1:01:21] that are streaming tonight and some that
[1:01:23] will archive this service
[1:01:25] father we just come before you with
[1:01:27] humility in our hearts and asking you to
[1:01:30] help us
[1:01:31] we're so needy lord in this hour that we
[1:01:33] live but we're grateful that all of our
[1:01:36] needs we can bring them to you and
[1:01:38] you're mindful of us
[1:01:40] i pray for a few moments here this
[1:01:42] evening lord that you would be able to
[1:01:44] capture our attention
[1:01:46] you see for many of them lord they're
[1:01:49] tired in their bodies and they're just
[1:01:51] settling into a place that's not their
[1:01:53] own home and not their own bed and all
[1:01:55] of that but
[1:01:57] would you help us while we're here these
[1:01:58] few days
[1:01:59] may we hear
[1:02:01] from across the river
[1:02:03] may eternity
[1:02:05] speak to us lord
[1:02:07] dear god we know if there's anything
[1:02:09] that's accomplished out of these
[1:02:10] meetings that'll be of eternal value
[1:02:13] it'll be you that'll do it no doubt
[1:02:15] brother ron has studied and prayed
[1:02:17] brother ander has studied and prayed
[1:02:19] i've done likewise brother tim
[1:02:21] lord has prayed and prayed in his church
[1:02:24] but father we know without you coming
[1:02:26] supernaturally it'll just be a
[1:02:28] protractive gathering we don't want that
[1:02:31] lord
[1:02:31] but we want lives to be changed
[1:02:34] delivered
[1:02:35] set free speak to us tonight father we
[1:02:38] pray in the name of the lord jesus
[1:02:41] and the saints said
[1:02:43] god bless you you may be
[1:02:50] i'd like to speak to you tonight for
[1:02:52] just a little bit on
[1:02:54] standing
[1:02:56] in the evil day
[1:02:58] i could imagine that brother random
[1:03:00] would have had so many things
[1:03:03] that he
[1:03:04] had the ability
[1:03:06] the understanding
[1:03:07] the revelation
[1:03:09] to be able to bring
[1:03:11] to his people here he's in branham
[1:03:13] tabernacle he felt more liberty to
[1:03:16] preach there than pretty much anywhere
[1:03:18] else in the world
[1:03:19] no doubt he could have spoke on some
[1:03:21] great mysteries some great things that
[1:03:25] had so much depth and would have brought
[1:03:28] such exhilarating feeling to our
[1:03:31] emotions and we would have thought wow
[1:03:34] that was so profound
[1:03:36] but yet his desire was to be able to
[1:03:40] bring something that would enlighten not
[1:03:42] only the branham tabernacle
[1:03:44] but those of us that never even got to
[1:03:47] meet brother branham and see him and yet
[1:03:50] we are the trophies of his message as
[1:03:52] well as they were
[1:03:54] but something that would enlighten us to
[1:03:57] the hour that we're living in now we
[1:04:00] know that whenever the prophet was here
[1:04:02] there was great darkness on the earth
[1:04:04] but in reality it was nothing compared
[1:04:07] to what it is today
[1:04:09] and for sure he said even then that the
[1:04:12] world was groping in insanity what would
[1:04:15] he say about it today when people don't
[1:04:18] know if they're a man or a woman or a
[1:04:20] dog or a cat or a horse they're not even
[1:04:22] sure really what they even are
[1:04:24] they're not sure what they even want to
[1:04:26] be
[1:04:27] and we know that that darkness is so
[1:04:30] permeating over the entire earth and we
[1:04:33] can see that the handwriting is
[1:04:36] certainly on the wall and if he was here
[1:04:38] today i wonder what would be the burden
[1:04:42] on his heart if he could stand here
[1:04:44] before you tonight and be able to speak
[1:04:47] something to you would it be rallying
[1:04:50] words that would just help us to get
[1:04:52] excited for a few days would it be
[1:04:54] something that he would point us to a
[1:04:56] system would he point us to some
[1:04:58] doctrine as even some message people
[1:05:01] would do and they think the message is
[1:05:03] all about this doctrine and that
[1:05:06] doctrine and another doctrine but i'm so
[1:05:08] glad who i'm looking for is not a
[1:05:11] doctrine he's a person
[1:05:13] it was not a doctrine young people that
[1:05:16] died for you it was not a doctrine that
[1:05:19] raised from the dead it was a person it
[1:05:23] is not a doctrine that we're looking for
[1:05:25] to come and change our bodies but it is
[1:05:29] a person as much as we thank god for the
[1:05:32] teachings and the doctrines of the
[1:05:34] message yet if satan cannot stop us from
[1:05:37] embracing those truths he will try to
[1:05:40] get us to emphasize that instead of the
[1:05:43] very literal life of the lord jesus
[1:05:46] himself but i'm glad that over the years
[1:05:49] that we've been able to be a part of
[1:05:51] this camp and the years that i wasn't
[1:05:53] here was able to get a bus and send our
[1:05:56] young people here because i feel like
[1:05:59] that what is going to be said and what
[1:06:01] is going to be preached is going to be
[1:06:03] an emphasis that the lord jesus would be
[1:06:06] happy with and not only that but that
[1:06:09] there will be lives that will be changed
[1:06:11] and it will not be so much that it will
[1:06:13] be trophies for brother ron trophies for
[1:06:16] brother tim trophies for brother andrew
[1:06:19] but trophies for the lord jesus himself
[1:06:23] and as we are in this darkened age and
[1:06:26] may i say to those of you that are
[1:06:28] serving the lord that no doubt you are
[1:06:31] facing things that no other generation
[1:06:34] of young people ever had to face the
[1:06:36] darkness that is keep continually coming
[1:06:39] out upon the face of the earth even
[1:06:42] though we're walking in the greatest
[1:06:43] light that's ever been we cannot keep
[1:06:46] from being affected by the darkness that
[1:06:49] is here the prophet told us when he was
[1:06:51] here that the lid had been tore off of
[1:06:55] the kettle and demon powers were
[1:06:58] streaming in every direction now if that
[1:07:01] was 1961-62
[1:07:03] can you imagine what it is in the day
[1:07:06] that we're living now
[1:07:07] and we're not here tonight to give the
[1:07:10] devil praise we're not here tonight to
[1:07:12] tell what a mighty mighty devil that he
[1:07:14] is but i do want you to recognize that
[1:07:18] we do uh are are against a powerful
[1:07:21] adversary and we are also more equipped
[1:07:26] than the army of hell is equipped but
[1:07:29] that is only as we find our position in
[1:07:32] the word and we realize what what god
[1:07:35] has done for us and we know that our
[1:07:37] position is more than just quoting
[1:07:39] quotes and we can have all the
[1:07:41] memorabilia of the message of the hour
[1:07:44] we can know many of the great events
[1:07:46] where brother branham was sharing a
[1:07:47] certain day brother branham was there on
[1:07:49] a certain day and all that is good but
[1:07:51] yet really what i want to emphasize to
[1:07:54] you tonight is not just where brother
[1:07:56] branham was on a certain day but where
[1:07:58] were you when life struck you
[1:08:00] because it's not going to be us just
[1:08:03] recognizing who brother branham was as a
[1:08:06] matter of fact brother brennam tells us
[1:08:08] one day the bride will recognize who she
[1:08:11] is and when she recognizes who she is
[1:08:14] the rapture will go
[1:08:17] not the rapture will come but the
[1:08:20] rapture will go when she recognizes who
[1:08:24] she is so it's not it's not great enough
[1:08:27] for you to be able to say oh i've got a
[1:08:29] wonderful mama i've got a wonderful
[1:08:31] father my pastor is such a wonderful man
[1:08:34] that's wonderful i'm glad that you have
[1:08:37] that kind of parents and that kind of a
[1:08:39] pastor but that will not give you the
[1:08:41] overcoming power that you need to face
[1:08:44] the darkness in this day
[1:08:46] you have got to be able to know that you
[1:08:48] have met the god of your mother the god
[1:08:51] of your father the god of william
[1:08:54] branham we don't want to just say well
[1:08:56] where is the god of brother branham we
[1:08:58] want to be able to say i know where he
[1:09:00] is he's here in my heart
[1:09:03] he's in my church he's in the message of
[1:09:06] the hour he's here in this meeting do we
[1:09:09] believe that with all of our hearts we
[1:09:11] believe he is the same yesterday today
[1:09:14] and forever for real believers that is
[1:09:17] not just a cliche that we say around the
[1:09:20] message of that well he's the same
[1:09:22] yesterday today and forever we really
[1:09:25] believe that he is the same
[1:09:28] and i really want to inform hell tonight
[1:09:32] that they are coming against the
[1:09:33] greatest generation of young people that
[1:09:36] have ever been on the face of the earth
[1:09:39] we're not just a second-handed
[1:09:41] generation of people well my grandfather
[1:09:44] was in the message or my grandmother or
[1:09:46] my mother or my father no that's not our
[1:09:49] credentials our credentials are we have
[1:09:52] met the lord jesus christ ourself
[1:09:55] is that right now you know the enemy
[1:09:58] that we are faced with there's certainly
[1:10:00] one that we would not want to meet on
[1:10:03] our own i would not want to meet this
[1:10:06] enemy on my own he was so defiant
[1:10:09] against the lord jesus that he just came
[1:10:12] right up against him and questioned who
[1:10:14] he was and we must remember that we have
[1:10:17] a strong adversary that is by no means
[1:10:19] saying that we acknowledge him as being
[1:10:21] some great something and we are
[1:10:23] weaklings but yet peter says it this way
[1:10:26] in first peter chapter 5 verse 8 be
[1:10:28] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[1:10:32] the devil as a roaring lion walketh
[1:10:36] about seeking whom he may devour now you
[1:10:40] know peter was a man that i really
[1:10:43] really like in the bible because he's
[1:10:45] one of the few new testament characters
[1:10:47] that were able to see growth in his life
[1:10:50] we see him fall flat on his face and get
[1:10:52] right back up again by the grace of god
[1:10:55] so who better than peter to write about
[1:10:58] this now paul we don't know so much
[1:11:01] about his walk but yet peter were able
[1:11:03] to see that peter was able to be a man
[1:11:07] that had a lot of pride about himself
[1:11:09] and an element of arrogance about
[1:11:11] himself and he felt like that he was so
[1:11:14] secure in the kingdom of god and he felt
[1:11:17] like that if john backslid and turn away
[1:11:20] from jesus peter would never do it and
[1:11:22] he had such confidence but his
[1:11:24] confidence was not in the reality of god
[1:11:27] it was in the strength of his own flesh
[1:11:30] those others will turn you away lord i
[1:11:33] will not do it and it must have been
[1:11:35] very very hard for him to accept what
[1:11:38] the lord jesus said that you will deny
[1:11:41] me
[1:11:42] is that right now i want you to notice
[1:11:44] that the lord jesus tried to warn peter
[1:11:46] several times and tell him that satan
[1:11:49] was out to get him but you see the
[1:11:52] danger of having spiritual pride and
[1:11:55] spiritual arrogance is that we tend to
[1:11:57] look at ourselves and think well the
[1:11:59] devil will never get me well so-and-so
[1:12:02] is caught up in porn but it'll never
[1:12:04] happen to me so-and-so is caught up in
[1:12:07] this and that but it'll never happen to
[1:12:09] me we need to hide behind the mercy and
[1:12:12] the strength of our god not confidence
[1:12:15] in our flesh
[1:12:17] for if a man thinks that he stand let
[1:12:19] him take heed lest he fall
[1:12:22] now you know i find this myself and i'm
[1:12:24] sure our brothers could agree that
[1:12:26] there's so
[1:12:27] too many christians that are around this
[1:12:30] message that have gone to sleep they've
[1:12:32] entered into a slumber of the last days
[1:12:35] and they're taking confidence in what
[1:12:37] they think they can do and they're not
[1:12:39] really listening to their pastors as
[1:12:41] their pastors are trying to warn them of
[1:12:44] the darkness that's pressing against us
[1:12:46] and yet we know that as we go on it's
[1:12:49] going to get worse listen to this in
[1:12:50] matthew 26 40 when he cometh unto the
[1:12:54] disciples and find them asleep and he
[1:12:56] says unto peter what could you not watch
[1:12:59] with me one hour just one hour listen to
[1:13:03] these words watch and pray that you
[1:13:06] enter not into temptation the spirit
[1:13:08] indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
[1:13:11] once again the lord jesus warns peter
[1:13:15] and he lets him know that the spirit may
[1:13:17] be indeed willing but his flesh was
[1:13:20] still very weak now the pewter whenever
[1:13:23] peter when it goes back to this and he
[1:13:25] remembers no doubt this very night
[1:13:28] relived it many many times i'm sure in
[1:13:30] his life and peter sought to write in
[1:13:33] his epistle what could i say to the
[1:13:36] people that are in this day and the
[1:13:38] people that will read this what can i
[1:13:40] say to them that i would be able to give
[1:13:42] them something that would help them and
[1:13:45] peter chose to use the word sober and he
[1:13:49] chose the word vigilant and he could
[1:13:52] have described the devil by many many
[1:13:55] terms but he chose to describe him as a
[1:13:59] roaring lion not as a sitting lion or a
[1:14:04] sleeping lion or even as a crouching
[1:14:08] lion now notice he said as a roaring
[1:14:12] lion notice peter says be sober be
[1:14:15] vigilant the word sober is to watch to
[1:14:19] be calm collected in spirit to be
[1:14:21] temperant to govern both the outward and
[1:14:25] the inward man by rules of temperance
[1:14:29] modesty and mortification cares will
[1:14:33] intoxicate the soul therefore be sober
[1:14:38] now many of you have never drunk any
[1:14:40] alcohol in your life
[1:14:42] you've never drunk any wine or any any
[1:14:45] type of spirits as the world calls it
[1:14:47] but yet you know there's so many more
[1:14:49] things by which we can become
[1:14:51] intoxicated than it would just be wine
[1:14:54] or alcohol but we can just get so busy
[1:14:57] with the sayings of life themselves now
[1:15:00] peter was not drinking it wasn't that
[1:15:02] peter had truthful girlfriends on the
[1:15:04] side and peter was kind of running the
[1:15:06] bars you know and he was smoking and
[1:15:08] doing all that sort of thing but peter
[1:15:10] just got so caught up and no doubt he
[1:15:13] felt like that he himself was really
[1:15:15] established upon the truths of what he
[1:15:17] believed the gospel was and he felt like
[1:15:20] if everybody forsook the lord jesus
[1:15:22] there's no way he's going anywhere and i
[1:15:25] just can't believe that peter actually
[1:15:28] took the words of the lord jesus when he
[1:15:30] said peter before the croc crows you
[1:15:32] will deny you even know me now if peter
[1:15:36] would have believed that i believe the
[1:15:38] man would have fell on his feet and
[1:15:40] repented and say please strengthen me
[1:15:42] please help me help me that i won't do
[1:15:45] this but it was as if though he was so
[1:15:48] arrogant in himself that the words of
[1:15:51] the lord jesus did not even penetrate
[1:15:54] his soul and shake him to such a spot
[1:15:57] that he would say lord please help me
[1:15:59] that i don't do this give me strength
[1:16:01] and i don't do it you know you think
[1:16:03] about life whenever a lot i was given
[1:16:06] the decision to choose which way would
[1:16:08] go to the left to the right abraham said
[1:16:10] whichever way you go i'll go the
[1:16:12] opposite way if lot would have known who
[1:16:15] abraham was you think of being the
[1:16:17] prophet of that age they would have come
[1:16:19] back and said help me guide me lead me i
[1:16:23] i don't know what to do i don't know
[1:16:25] which way to go that it's apparent that
[1:16:27] lot had so much confidence in the
[1:16:30] leadership of his own mind's own walk
[1:16:33] maybe the influence of his wife because
[1:16:35] she had this worldly desire he didn't
[1:16:38] even inquire from the prophet what
[1:16:40] should i do help me to know i don't know
[1:16:43] i mean there's evil there there's evil
[1:16:45] there you direct me you guide me all
[1:16:47] young people how many have we seen that
[1:16:50] have had such confidence in themselves
[1:16:52] and then they they tend to become to a
[1:16:55] spot to where they're not as peter said
[1:16:58] that they are sober now the next word
[1:17:00] that he uses is vigilance and it means
[1:17:03] to watch and wait oh
[1:17:06] so wonder why he's using these words
[1:17:09] watch and be awake
[1:17:12] watch and be awake these are the very
[1:17:15] words the lord jesus spoke to him
[1:17:19] but did peter do it he did not
[1:17:22] this is one thing i love about the grace
[1:17:24] of god all these preachers up here and
[1:17:26] how many evermore's out here and how
[1:17:28] many ever stream in this service every
[1:17:31] one of them is preaching to you about
[1:17:33] the mercy of god you know one reason
[1:17:35] they can preach it with such passion
[1:17:37] they've experienced it you know why they
[1:17:40] can preach to you god can forgive you
[1:17:42] because god's forgiven them
[1:17:45] is that right i wouldn't give you a
[1:17:47] nickel for a preacher that preaches so
[1:17:49] high and he acts like that he ain't
[1:17:52] never needed no forgiveness he's a
[1:17:53] hypocrite
[1:17:55] that's exactly right there won't be one
[1:17:57] preacher that will ever walk down the
[1:17:59] streets of gold that did not need the
[1:18:01] mercy of god the salvation of god
[1:18:03] sanctification forgiveness is that right
[1:18:06] that's why they can stand up and tell
[1:18:09] you that god is mindful of your needs
[1:18:12] i'm sure as we've gathered here tonight
[1:18:14] there's young people that maybe not even
[1:18:15] say there are some of you that are saved
[1:18:18] and you're not sanctified there's
[1:18:19] somebody that are saved and sanctified
[1:18:21] not filled with the holy ghost and
[1:18:23] there's probably some that are saved
[1:18:25] sanctified filled with the holy ghost
[1:18:26] but maybe you're fighting depression or
[1:18:28] sadness or whatever it is we've got
[1:18:31] people with all walks of life but i
[1:18:33] believe our god is so mindful of every
[1:18:36] one of your needs that from the very
[1:18:38] back back road to the very front row all
[1:18:41] the way across the whole front i believe
[1:18:43] our god can lead these men and direct
[1:18:46] these men to preach exactly what you
[1:18:48] have need of in these days that we are
[1:18:51] here and we don't want it to be a
[1:18:53] protracted meeting but we want it to be
[1:18:56] a meeting where devils are cast out and
[1:18:58] the sick are healed and tumors will lead
[1:19:01] people's bodies hallelujah and the
[1:19:04] shackles will fall off of people's lives
[1:19:07] and those that are bound will say praise
[1:19:10] god i'm true why because we are watching
[1:19:14] and we are vigilant and we say we need
[1:19:18] to be stirred in this hour we need more
[1:19:21] holy ghosts than we've ever had in our
[1:19:23] life we need more the love of god we
[1:19:26] need the power of god we need the word
[1:19:28] of god is that right why because we are
[1:19:32] facing a deadly enemy but we want to let
[1:19:35] him know tonight we are more than
[1:19:38] conquerors
[1:19:39] we are not leia to sin survivors we are
[1:19:43] overcomers
[1:19:45] [Applause]
[1:19:52] so this man when he wants to write to
[1:19:55] young people
[1:19:57] to preachers
[1:19:58] to older people
[1:20:01] he wants to tell
[1:20:03] watch
[1:20:05] stay awake
[1:20:08] why
[1:20:09] because he hadn't done so good at it
[1:20:13] to be cautious
[1:20:15] to take heed this is the meaning of the
[1:20:18] word vigilant
[1:20:19] lest through remission
[1:20:22] and carelessness
[1:20:25] some destructive calamity
[1:20:28] would overtake you
[1:20:30] be
[1:20:32] self-controlled
[1:20:33] now we realize this is what the majority
[1:20:36] of christendom lacks
[1:20:38] brother branham uses a very simple
[1:20:40] illustration
[1:20:42] about salvation
[1:20:44] something like this
[1:20:46] you go out in the barnyard
[1:20:49] and there's a glass laying out there
[1:20:51] it's got cow manure on it straw
[1:20:54] hay it's filthy nasty
[1:20:57] there's no way you're gonna pick that up
[1:21:00] and drink out of it
[1:21:02] so you reach down and when you do you
[1:21:04] pick it up now you have taken the filth
[1:21:08] of this
[1:21:10] upon yourself
[1:21:11] this is why he had to become a man
[1:21:15] god in spirit form could not take our
[1:21:18] sin upon himself so god became a man
[1:21:23] is that right now whenever he did this
[1:21:25] he reached down and he took our sin upon
[1:21:29] himself but did he save me he saved me
[1:21:32] from the barnyard but i'm still not full
[1:21:35] of anything yet full of myself full of
[1:21:37] arrogance full of stench full of all
[1:21:39] that sort of thing now this is where the
[1:21:41] majority of christendom is they profess
[1:21:44] him as their savior all glory i'm saved
[1:21:46] thank god i'm saved are they they are
[1:21:49] they're saved from the barnyard they're
[1:21:51] same from the you know the things that
[1:21:53] are out there but are they in service
[1:21:55] they're not but you know if you really
[1:21:57] want to use that you take that glass in
[1:22:00] the house and you go to run in some warm
[1:22:02] water and you'll put dishwashing soap
[1:22:05] inside of there and you'll suds it up
[1:22:07] and you'll stick it down in there and
[1:22:09] wash it depending on how picky you are
[1:22:11] you may rush it once and then twice and
[1:22:14] then three times why because you do not
[1:22:16] want to put anything in that glass and
[1:22:19] press that glass to your lips until that
[1:22:22] glass has been washed and sanctified and
[1:22:25] filled all young people may i say to you
[1:22:28] tonight you don't want to just be picked
[1:22:30] up out of the barnyard and say oh
[1:22:32] hallelujah the lord saved me oh
[1:22:34] hallelujah i'm different than what i was
[1:22:37] is the glass different it is different
[1:22:40] but that's not the end destiny of what
[1:22:42] god wants for that glass
[1:22:45] you bring it in you wash it really good
[1:22:47] and then you set it up on the counter
[1:22:49] there it is it's justified it's
[1:22:51] sanctified but unlike that gatorade
[1:22:54] bottle it is still empty oh my let's not
[1:22:58] leave this place may there not be a one
[1:23:01] that'll leave this place on sunday
[1:23:03] that'll say i'm an empty vessel may
[1:23:05] there not be a one young person or
[1:23:08] middle-aged person that'll pull out of
[1:23:10] this parking lot that won't be so full
[1:23:13] of the baptism of the holy ghost that
[1:23:15] every fiber of your being is
[1:23:24] this is what makes it so sad that many
[1:23:27] are washed
[1:23:29] and they're even cleaned and they're
[1:23:31] setting there and they're empty
[1:23:33] they never go any farther they never
[1:23:35] move beyond and they're just oh i thank
[1:23:38] you lord oh i used to drink but i don't
[1:23:40] drink no more i used to cuss but i don't
[1:23:43] cuss no more i used to do this better
[1:23:45] don't do that no more and they're still
[1:23:47] just thanking god that they come out of
[1:23:49] the barnyard and they're thanking god
[1:23:51] that they've been baptized and they've
[1:23:53] been washed
[1:23:54] but they're not in service
[1:23:57] so they're just sitting there praise the
[1:23:59] lord praise the lord oh hallelujah i'm
[1:24:02] so clean i feel so clean i feel so good
[1:24:06] to be clean ain't it good to be clean
[1:24:13] this is why we needed a profit in this
[1:24:15] day
[1:24:16] to be a help to restore us back to the
[1:24:19] true apostolic face
[1:24:21] of our fathers
[1:24:23] they didn't just preach justification
[1:24:25] and sanctification they preached the
[1:24:27] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:30] and a message preacher that ain't
[1:24:31] preaching that i ain't preaching the
[1:24:32] message
[1:24:34] well praise the lord
[1:24:36] not only the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:38] but the baptism of the holy ghost with
[1:24:39] the same sensation the same emotion
[1:24:42] living the same kind of life the prophet
[1:24:44] said it right here in the state of
[1:24:46] louisiana that the second adam's
[1:24:48] children have only got one way to act
[1:24:51] and that is like they did on the day of
[1:24:53] pentecost and if we're born i know a lot
[1:24:55] of our folks don't want emotion anymore
[1:24:58] i'll tell you the reason some preachers
[1:24:59] don't preach for emotion because they've
[1:25:01] not had a real experience themselves
[1:25:03] they've accepted an intellectual
[1:25:05] conception of the message but that'll
[1:25:07] never back up the devil in your life
[1:25:09] that'll never keep all the sins of sin
[1:25:12] and the power of darkness that's on the
[1:25:14] face of the earth today we will not be
[1:25:16] able to back the devil up just by
[1:25:18] quoting quotes i'm telling him brother
[1:25:20] branham said this and brother branham
[1:25:22] said that the devil cannot quote every
[1:25:24] one of us the devil can quote the bible
[1:25:27] better than every one of us but there's
[1:25:29] one thing we can do we can live right we
[1:25:33] have the power of god and our soul the
[1:25:36] devil cannot live this word he cannot
[1:25:40] have the life of christ
[1:25:54] now i'll tell you one thing i appreciate
[1:25:57] i really appreciate
[1:25:59] this container
[1:26:01] can you imagine me now i'm getting hot
[1:26:03] and sweating and i'm going to be thirsty
[1:26:05] shortly
[1:26:06] can you imagine me trying
[1:26:09] to get this gatorade in me
[1:26:11] without a vessel
[1:26:14] so if it was just here it was all laying
[1:26:16] on the floor and it was laying on the
[1:26:18] pulpit how am i going to get it am i
[1:26:20] going to do like a dog go around and
[1:26:21] laugh it up with my tongue
[1:26:24] how i appreciate a vessel
[1:26:28] young people this is what god wants you
[1:26:30] to be right here
[1:26:32] a vessel oh
[1:26:33] glory to god a vessel so full of the
[1:26:36] holy ghost
[1:26:37] that when you get up on monday morning
[1:26:39] the devil says oh no here they come

[1:26:45] hallelujah not you getting up on monday
[1:26:48] morning say no no not monday again i'll
[1:26:51] tell you what the prophet said he said a
[1:26:53] man or woman could live so close to god
[1:26:56] that the devil don't know what to do
[1:26:58] with you we ought to be young people in
[1:27:00] this message that when we get up out of
[1:27:03] the bed the devil says oh no there's
[1:27:05] that young man there's that young woman
[1:27:07] there's that preacher that's that deacon
[1:27:10] walk out hell here they come here they
[1:27:13] come they're not compromising they're
[1:27:15] not just talkers they're possessions
[1:27:24] [Applause]
[1:27:27] so what do you do
[1:27:29] you take that glass and you set it there
[1:27:32] you fill it with milk
[1:27:34] orange juice
[1:27:35] water tea
[1:27:37] whatever it is
[1:27:41] now
[1:27:42] you identified yourself with it
[1:27:45] hallelujah
[1:27:47] you identified yourself with it
[1:27:50] when you picked it up the first time
[1:27:52] now it's identifying itself with you
[1:27:55] when you press it
[1:27:57] to your lips
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:07] is it possible that that filthy dirty
[1:28:10] thing
[1:28:12] could minister drink to the lord jesus
[1:28:17] hallelujah is it possible that the lord
[1:28:20] could so feel you god don't want just
[1:28:23] preachers to talking about this he wants
[1:28:25] you young people set on fire
[1:28:29] hallelujah he wants you young people so
[1:28:31] filled with the power of god that people
[1:28:34] will notice something about your life
[1:28:36] not just your hair sisters not just your
[1:28:39] dress not just your brothers don't look
[1:28:41] like women and all that sort of thing
[1:28:43] but the life of christ so permeating out
[1:28:46] of your life that people say there's
[1:28:48] something about that young boy there's
[1:28:50] something about that girl what is it it
[1:28:52] ain't the bottle it ain't the vessel
[1:28:55] it's the contents
[1:28:57] it's the conscious that's what it is
[1:28:59] that's what makes us different
[1:29:11] oh
[1:29:12] but our adversary
[1:29:17] the greek word here calls him
[1:29:19] diablos
[1:29:22] the slanderer
[1:29:25] the slander
[1:29:27] peter said his as a roaring
[1:29:30] lion
[1:29:31] lion walking about
[1:29:34] seeking
[1:29:35] whom he may devour
[1:29:38] not a sweeping line
[1:29:41] as i said not a couching
[1:29:43] lion
[1:29:44] several years ago i was in kenya
[1:29:47] going to the serengeti park
[1:29:50] a brother there in the message was a
[1:29:52] game warden
[1:29:53] and i was able to go
[1:29:55] in places to where the normal tourist
[1:29:57] was not able to go and see
[1:30:00] and as we were driving out in the
[1:30:01] serengeti on a jeep and i saw this big
[1:30:04] female lioness
[1:30:06] up on an abandoned anthill
[1:30:09] maybe maybe this tall something like
[1:30:11] that
[1:30:12] and she was so conspicuous
[1:30:16] you could see her she just stuck out of
[1:30:18] the sore sum as we would say
[1:30:20] so i asked the brother i said why why is
[1:30:23] she doing that
[1:30:24] and he said she's a decoy
[1:30:27] now there were gems about there was all
[1:30:29] kinds of animals out there everywhere
[1:30:32] saying that if you look really close
[1:30:34] in the bush
[1:30:36] you'll find the hunters
[1:30:38] so we had binoculars and we started
[1:30:40] looking in there we looked and we looked
[1:30:43] and the grass there is almost identical
[1:30:45] same color of the lions and there we
[1:30:47] finally found them and they were
[1:30:49] sneaking up but yet all of those animals
[1:30:52] hundreds of them they were not looking
[1:30:55] in the bush
[1:30:56] you know where they were looking
[1:30:58] at that one decoy
[1:31:01] so they have their eyes listen young
[1:31:03] people satan will not hit you in your
[1:31:06] strengths
[1:31:07] he will hit you in your weaknesses
[1:31:10] oh come on now don't get quiet on me
[1:31:13] what what strengths in your life he will
[1:31:15] not hit you so much there but every one
[1:31:18] of us has weaknesses inside of our flesh
[1:31:21] and that's what we've got to fortify by
[1:31:23] the grace of god
[1:31:25] your weakness might be not been able to
[1:31:27] cope and deal with people laughing that
[1:31:30] you're making fun of you and satan will
[1:31:32] deal with you that way you're some of
[1:31:34] you others your weakness may be one
[1:31:36] thing or another but we need the grace
[1:31:38] of god to help us strengthen those
[1:31:41] weaknesses
[1:31:42] because satan will put a decoy in front
[1:31:44] of us and we'll get our eyes on that
[1:31:47] decoded coin not knowing the real enemy
[1:31:50] is right here and your greatest enemies
[1:31:53] not your mama your greatest enemies not
[1:31:55] your daddy but your greatest enemy is
[1:31:58] yourself
[1:32:02] now that's very difficult
[1:32:04] because there ain't nobody i love in
[1:32:06] this world
[1:32:08] any better
[1:32:09] than me
[1:32:12] oh i just love me
[1:32:14] don't sit down and look at me like i'm a
[1:32:16] weirdo you do too
[1:32:20] i ain't nobody you love no matter who
[1:32:21] did you feed today your mama or yourself
[1:32:24] who did you get ready for church your
[1:32:26] sister or yourself
[1:32:32] satan don't put the whole you better oh
[1:32:33] you better watch oh oh my oh my
[1:32:37] but your enemies actually over here
[1:32:41] as i sat there and i watched and i
[1:32:43] watched and i pondered and i thought
[1:32:44] about brother ron how the enemy actually
[1:32:47] does
[1:32:48] you know and whenever naturalists tell
[1:32:50] us
[1:32:51] that whenever the lion is roaring
[1:32:55] that is when he is the most hungry
[1:32:59] i i hope that you can see tonight that
[1:33:01] every individual here including me
[1:33:06] satan looks at us as potential supper
[1:33:13] what do you think he'd rather have in
[1:33:14] his trophy room one of these men of god
[1:33:18] or some denominational guy that don't
[1:33:19] really know nothing about god
[1:33:22] which do you think he'd rather have some
[1:33:24] of these denominational young people
[1:33:26] that all they've ever known is
[1:33:27] denomination there's a denomination that
[1:33:29] or some of you that's been raised in the
[1:33:31] message of the hour oh you said well
[1:33:33] that's my protection no it's not your
[1:33:36] protection has not been raised in a
[1:33:38] message pew but it's that baptism of the
[1:33:41] holy ghost don't take that pride oh i
[1:33:44] i'll never do this i'll never do that
[1:33:46] there's only one way you won't do it the
[1:33:49] power of the holy ghost inside of you
[1:33:51] [Applause]
[1:34:00] in 1898
[1:34:04] england which is in control of kenya
[1:34:07] wanted to build
[1:34:08] a railway
[1:34:10] so they send an engineer
[1:34:12] they hire many locals and bring
[1:34:15] also other people from england to come
[1:34:18] and to construct this railway
[1:34:21] they start missing
[1:34:23] employees
[1:34:27] they first they're bewildered by it and
[1:34:29] they start finding blood trails
[1:34:33] and in the middle of the night hearing
[1:34:35] people scream
[1:34:36] and holler
[1:34:38] come to find out it was two lions
[1:34:42] lions from savo
[1:34:45] one was called ghost
[1:34:47] and the other one was called darkness
[1:34:51] these lions were man-eaters
[1:34:55] a minimum of 35 that they know of and
[1:34:57] they say possibly up to 135
[1:35:01] that they killed
[1:35:03] they had no appetite for the gyms but
[1:35:07] impala
[1:35:08] normal lion food
[1:35:12] but they had an appetite
[1:35:14] for people
[1:35:17] and they killed one after another after
[1:35:20] another
[1:35:22] they finally found their den
[1:35:25] and when they did they found the skulls
[1:35:28] and the bones
[1:35:30] of one human being after another
[1:35:33] after another
[1:35:35] well i'm going to tell you tonight our
[1:35:37] enemy is even worse
[1:35:39] than the lions of savo
[1:35:43] they're in the museum in chicago to this
[1:35:45] very day
[1:35:47] it's been a mystery for all of these
[1:35:49] years why
[1:35:50] that they actually did what they did
[1:35:53] but let me tell you young people your
[1:35:55] enemy tonight is even more cunning
[1:35:58] even more
[1:36:00] of a challenge for you and i
[1:36:03] than the savo lines were
[1:36:06] they finally were able to take them both
[1:36:09] and there they are in the museum the
[1:36:11] most famous and infamous animals in all
[1:36:14] the natural history museum
[1:36:17] i actually have a mountain lion myself
[1:36:20] that come from the same area
[1:36:22] of saavo
[1:36:24] those lines are very peculiar in that
[1:36:26] they did not have a mane they were
[1:36:29] massive in size and the one i have is
[1:36:31] massive as well
[1:36:33] but it doesn't hardly have any mane
[1:36:36] so i found a mane on ebay
[1:36:38] and i bought him a toupee
[1:36:44] but he's sort of like the devil he ain't
[1:36:46] really got no hair but he looks like he
[1:36:48] does
[1:36:49] now unless you knew it you know unless
[1:36:51] you was there in my house should never
[1:36:53] even know so sometimes people will come
[1:36:55] and want to look at it and while they're
[1:36:56] saying oh wow how beautiful wow he's
[1:36:58] really big he's this and that and i just
[1:37:00] reach over and grab this whole thing off
[1:37:02] of him and there he is bald as a pumpkin
[1:37:05] why because it's something about their
[1:37:08] dna they found out in that area
[1:37:12] that it does not produce a mane
[1:37:15] you know i think for a real child of god
[1:37:17] if we really know
[1:37:19] what satan is and what our lord is he
[1:37:22] might roar and he might terrify you in
[1:37:25] your flesh
[1:37:26] but if you have got the baptism of the
[1:37:28] holy ghost you're able to remove his
[1:37:31] toupee and say peter said you was as a
[1:37:35] roaring lion he didn't say you were one
[1:37:40] hallelujah
[1:37:41] hallelujah but i'll tell you the line
[1:37:44] that i love it's the lion of the tribe
[1:37:48] of judah
[1:37:50] that's the lion that is the conqueror
[1:37:52] and satan is nothing but an impersonator
[1:37:56] he wants to act like he's the almighty
[1:37:59] but he's not the almighty he is a devil
[1:38:02] he is a thief he is a liar and he is
[1:38:07] defeated by the power of the holy ghost
[1:38:21] hallelujah
[1:38:24] look at yourself tonight
[1:38:27] you're a walking ham sandwich
[1:38:32] you're a walking t-bone steak
[1:38:35] you're a walking pork chop dinner
[1:38:37] or a big chicken dinner
[1:38:40] the devil looks at you
[1:38:42] as food
[1:38:50] but aren't you glad
[1:38:52] that if he does just get a portion of us
[1:38:55] in his mouth
[1:38:56] we'll turn his stomach
[1:39:01] you are undefeatable
[1:39:04] you cannot be defeated as long as you
[1:39:07] are in christ jesus
[1:39:09] there is no enemy young people that can
[1:39:12] defeat you oh brother donna you don't
[1:39:14] know this and no i don't but i know a
[1:39:16] mighty god that's bigger than everything
[1:39:18] you're facing tonight you don't know
[1:39:20] what i come here with you're right i
[1:39:22] don't but i know my father knows what
[1:39:24] you're facing i know what you're going
[1:39:26] to face i don't have an idea what you're
[1:39:28] going to face when you go back home but
[1:39:30] i want to bring to you a message about
[1:39:32] the power of the holy ghost that when
[1:39:34] you leave out of here on sunday evening
[1:39:36] if you've got to face a trial or a test
[1:39:38] you can say by the grace of god out of
[1:39:40] my way you lying devil
[1:39:43] out of my way you lying devil you're not
[1:39:47] gonna stop me i was in the barnyard but
[1:39:50] i ain't no more i was in the dishwater
[1:39:52] but i ain't no more now i've got the
[1:39:55] water on the inside of me i'm full of
[1:39:58] that water
[1:40:11] you know satan tempts
[1:40:13] in three forms
[1:40:17] as the subtle serpent
[1:40:20] to
[1:40:21] our senses
[1:40:24] pervert
[1:40:25] our judgment
[1:40:27] and enchant
[1:40:29] our imagination
[1:40:32] the form of the serpent is the way it
[1:40:34] came to our mother in the garden of eden
[1:40:40] to enchant her
[1:40:42] to lead her by the power
[1:40:45] of imagination
[1:40:47] to beguile
[1:40:49] her senses
[1:40:51] the serpent
[1:40:52] beguiled me
[1:40:55] oh my
[1:40:57] and to pervert
[1:40:59] our judgment well you can get by with
[1:41:01] this my you've been hearing the lord's
[1:41:02] coming all these years well who knows it
[1:41:04] may be a hundred years it may be
[1:41:08] but can any of you show me the divine
[1:41:09] guarantee that you'll live
[1:41:11] till the end of the service
[1:41:18] for generations
[1:41:21] nuclear
[1:41:22] war
[1:41:23] nuclear fear
[1:41:25] has not really been on the average
[1:41:26] common mind
[1:41:28] but look in the last month and a half
[1:41:31] we're hearing more about nuclear this
[1:41:33] and nuclear that my it has been in
[1:41:36] decades
[1:41:37] i spoke to my church the other night and
[1:41:39] told them that i just found where russia
[1:41:40] had been working on a stealth bomber
[1:41:45] they call the name of that bomber
[1:41:48] the messenger
[1:41:51] the messenger
[1:41:54] america turned down
[1:41:56] god's messenger
[1:42:00] but they won't be able to turn down
[1:42:02] russia's messenger
[1:42:04] look young people there's only one place
[1:42:06] that we can hide
[1:42:08] oh you know i'm sure that you you've
[1:42:10] read about it already and heard bomb
[1:42:12] shelters have went through the roof in
[1:42:15] the last month
[1:42:16] people ordering them online
[1:42:18] having them buried in their backyard put
[1:42:21] here and there and there but aren't you
[1:42:23] glad you've got one
[1:42:24] made
[1:42:25] out of feathers
[1:42:27] [Applause]
[1:42:29] that's what the prophet said we've got a
[1:42:31] bomb shelter made out of feathers i
[1:42:34] don't want a concrete one i don't want a
[1:42:36] steel one or a titanium one i've got one
[1:42:39] that's called my father's wings for
[1:42:42] before one of them bombs every land this
[1:42:44] way hallelujah the bride will be sailing
[1:42:47] off into the presence of god
[1:42:51] you understand friend how close we are
[1:42:54] those warheads when they start this way
[1:42:56] our nation only has a quantity of 40
[1:42:59] deterrents by which they can stop them
[1:43:01] and if russia starts sending hundreds of
[1:43:03] those and those warheads moving 15 000
[1:43:07] miles an hour
[1:43:09] that plane will fire so fast it can be
[1:43:12] from moscow to any place on the earth in
[1:43:14] less than 30 minutes
[1:43:17] people won't have time to get right they
[1:43:19] won't have time to fix this and that now
[1:43:22] is your time tonight is your time in the
[1:43:25] morning tomorrow night now is your time
[1:43:28] this is the day of your visitation
[1:43:31] accept your hour accept your time if
[1:43:34] you're on the barnyard the master is
[1:43:36] here to pick you up if you're filthy
[1:43:39] he's here to wash you if you're empty
[1:43:41] he's here to fill you so when you leave
[1:43:44] out of here you can leave a full vessel
[1:43:46] full of the holy ghost and say lord what
[1:43:49] do you want me to do
[1:43:54] oh
[1:43:56] he reveals himself and tempts us
[1:43:59] as a serpent
[1:44:00] but also as an angel of light
[1:44:03] to deceive us try to deceive us
[1:44:06] with false views
[1:44:09] of spiritual things
[1:44:12] and to redefine
[1:44:14] the declarations of god's word whether
[1:44:17] it's on holiness and sanctity or even
[1:44:19] the holy ghost
[1:44:21] and what's so sad is that we're dealing
[1:44:23] in our own ranks
[1:44:24] with preachers preaching a watered-down
[1:44:26] version of the holy ghost all you've got
[1:44:28] to do is believe god sent a prophet well
[1:44:30] if that's so every devil in hell will be
[1:44:32] saved
[1:44:35] there are no devils that follow the move
[1:44:37] but believe the sign
[1:44:39] because they know better
[1:44:42] they talk people into believing he
[1:44:43] wasn't a prophet but they know better
[1:44:47] so the angel of life will try to deceive
[1:44:50] people with false views of the truth
[1:44:54] or restructure the truth in such a way
[1:44:57] that it is more appealing and easy
[1:45:00] believism if you will
[1:45:04] and then as
[1:45:06] a roaring mind
[1:45:08] to tear us down
[1:45:11] destroy
[1:45:12] with violent
[1:45:14] opposition
[1:45:16] and y'all ever seen an african lion out
[1:45:18] in the wild i ain't talking about the
[1:45:19] cincinnati zoo now one brother back here
[1:45:22] a few
[1:45:23] brother here
[1:45:25] well i i don't mind telling you i've
[1:45:27] seen him in the zoo
[1:45:29] but they're like kitty cats
[1:45:32] compared to the ones that you see in the
[1:45:34] wild
[1:45:35] several years ago my wife and i was in
[1:45:37] south africa and the brothers there
[1:45:38] wanted to treat us to a really nice nice
[1:45:41] place to stay so they got us
[1:45:43] a place out and there was a dark
[1:45:45] whenever we got there
[1:45:47] and
[1:45:47] it was a very neat place
[1:45:50] but yet about three in the morning
[1:45:52] something like that
[1:45:54] we heard something
[1:46:05] and i'm not sure who moved the fastest
[1:46:08] me or my wife
[1:46:11] she was moving toward me and i was
[1:46:12] moving toward her
[1:46:16] we didn't know
[1:46:18] that we were staying right next door to
[1:46:20] a game reserve
[1:46:22] and right outside of our window was a
[1:46:24] fence about 15 feet tall something like
[1:46:27] that but we didn't know that because we
[1:46:30] came in in the dark
[1:46:32] all we knew we were hamming eggs
[1:46:35] for breakfast
[1:46:39] the next morning the baboons woke us up
[1:46:41] on the roof
[1:46:43] well whenever we
[1:46:44] finally got up and stirred around a
[1:46:46] little bit and saw that fence
[1:46:49] it made me feel somewhat better
[1:46:52] until three in that morning
[1:46:55] come to find out the king
[1:46:58] like that resort
[1:47:00] so he was camping out real close to our
[1:47:03] room
[1:47:04] so needless to say it took a little bit
[1:47:06] of the fun out of us watching the
[1:47:09] empower and all the rest of the things
[1:47:11] that was there because every morning we
[1:47:13] were being awakened by this
[1:47:15] now many of you from the
[1:47:17] signs of your hands you've never seen or
[1:47:19] heard you're saying quite like that but
[1:47:21] let me tell you you've heard worse
[1:47:24] because you have heard this impostor out
[1:47:27] of hell
[1:47:29] as he roars i'm going to get you i'm
[1:47:31] going to get you i'm going to destroy
[1:47:33] you i'm going to do this to you and i'm
[1:47:35] going to do that to you and his roar is
[1:47:38] so ferocious and so terrifying but if
[1:47:42] you could only look in his mouth and
[1:47:44] realize he ain't got no teeth to bite
[1:47:46] you he goes
[1:47:50] because the lord jesus doesn't pull his
[1:47:52] teeth on calvary
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:55] glory to god remember he's got a bow but
[1:47:58] he ain't got no arrows
[1:48:01] so he'll roar and roll and roll and can
[1:48:05] you imagine you run up on this line
[1:48:10] and then he opens his mouth
[1:48:15] and you're second you've got to be
[1:48:17] kidding me i was scared of that
[1:48:20] oh grandpa where's your polygrip
[1:48:24] oh brother sister if we knew who we were
[1:48:28] and can look at it in the right way when
[1:48:30] that devil comes roaring i'm going to
[1:48:32] kill you i'm going to do that you can
[1:48:35] look at him by the word of god and say
[1:48:37] get behind me satan you are a liar i'm a
[1:48:43] child of god i'm born again i'm going to
[1:48:46] heaven and you're going to hell leave me
[1:48:49] alone
[1:48:58] but
[1:48:58] instead he roars
[1:49:03] and then whenever we jump
[1:49:15] i ain't going to get too much out of use
[1:49:16] camp because boy last year last time i
[1:49:18] was here i already got a lot more the
[1:49:20] devil jumped me back
[1:49:22] so i ain't forget much this time if i
[1:49:23] shoot i get more
[1:49:28] i get more
[1:49:29] i make up in my mind this is going to be
[1:49:32] one of the paramount times of my life
[1:49:36] i'm talking about an emotion i'm talking
[1:49:38] about just a stir i'm talking about
[1:49:41] something in your soul
[1:49:42] that'll set you on fire
[1:49:49] so the devil is so
[1:49:51] hungry
[1:49:53] he's roaring
[1:50:02] i want russia i want ukraine i want to
[1:50:05] young people i want your preachers i
[1:50:07] want them all
[1:50:11] and he roars
[1:50:12] and we jerk
[1:50:14] and he roars and we quiver
[1:50:16] can you imagine god's prophet being so
[1:50:18] in tune with god
[1:50:20] that he said if a person had cancer
[1:50:25] and you didn't fear it
[1:50:26] it couldn't hurt you
[1:50:30] your sister's frying frying meat one
[1:50:32] morning for breakfast
[1:50:34] and the grease pops out and burns your
[1:50:36] hand
[1:50:37] and if you don't fear it you can say in
[1:50:38] the name of jesus
[1:50:40] you said that's a quote no it ain't
[1:50:42] it happened to my youngest daughter
[1:50:45] a year or so ago
[1:50:47] frying meat in her kitchen
[1:50:48] and the grease jumped out of her hand
[1:50:51] and pop trot on her hand and her first
[1:50:53] reaction was what it's the fight or
[1:50:55] flight within us and the devil wrote oh
[1:50:57] you're going down you're this or that
[1:50:58] the other but all of a sudden something
[1:51:00] from on the inside of her reminded her
[1:51:03] of that quote
[1:51:04] hallelujah oh what would it be like if
[1:51:07] we as the children of god whenever satan
[1:51:09] comes against us instead of us running
[1:51:11] and said well i'm quitting i'm just
[1:51:13] turning my back on the lord oh you
[1:51:15] coward come on get your backbone in this
[1:51:17] meeting i'll be able to walk out of here
[1:51:19] and look the devil in the face and say
[1:51:21] look devil you have blessed me your last
[1:51:23] time
[1:51:24] you have loved me your last time roar oh
[1:51:28] you want to devil but i am a young
[1:51:31] person in this message that is more than
[1:51:34] a conqueror
[1:51:47] or
[1:51:49] you can keep coming to this meeting year
[1:51:51] after year after year
[1:51:52] and get what brother brown called camp
[1:51:54] meeting cramps
[1:51:57] so you come and you get all fired up
[1:52:00] then you go back home and it lasts about
[1:52:02] a week or two
[1:52:04] and then some of your pastors get up
[1:52:06] there to preach and you say
[1:52:07] oh no
[1:52:10] not him again
[1:52:12] and you say well if he'd preach what
[1:52:14] brother andrew does well if you'd get
[1:52:16] with him the way you get to brother
[1:52:18] andrew
[1:52:19] you might turn that dry high preacher
[1:52:21] yours into a fireball
[1:52:23] if you had pulled on him
[1:52:25] come on to you saying brother branham
[1:52:27] would have looked at his dog go fritz
[1:52:29] whenever he wanted friends to be able to
[1:52:30] get that skunk and brother branham would
[1:52:32] have went
[1:52:36] that's what other message folks folks do
[1:52:38] anymore they don't say amen
[1:52:41] they nod
[1:52:42] we're not holy rovers we're holding
[1:52:44] others
[1:52:46] so you're reckoning that brother brandon
[1:52:48] looked at fritz and said principle what
[1:52:50] they said are you kidding me you think
[1:52:51] i'm going in there and going to tackle
[1:52:53] that skunk but what brother andrew said
[1:52:55] seeking boy
[1:52:56] seeking boy you don't need just get with
[1:52:58] me and brother ron and brother anger and
[1:53:00] these special meetings you need to take
[1:53:02] this special something home with you and
[1:53:04] when your pastor gets up to preach
[1:53:06] staring to death
[1:53:08] god said amen pastor that's why brother
[1:53:12] oh wow they located one will a revival
[1:53:15] may break out in your church

[1:53:48] with a defeated enemy
[1:53:51] a defeated and brother donna the
[1:53:53] symptoms are still there sure they may
[1:53:55] be there but by faith you can look at
[1:53:57] that which is not and say it is as
[1:54:00] though it was already substance in your
[1:54:02] life oh but i've got to beset him sin
[1:54:04] yeah and that lion wants to tell you

[1:55:16] since she herself
[1:55:18] was a woman

[1:58:45] they've had missiles shot at their homes
[1:58:48] their homes are annihilated
[1:58:50] their country nearly destroyed
[1:58:52] and you've probably seen some of the
[1:58:54] videos that are coming out from the
[1:58:55] message people there
[1:58:57] and they're gathering i saw one the
[1:58:59] other day but the bad coffee had sent it
[1:59:00] to him and it was the young people in a
[1:59:02] certain area
[1:59:04] of ukraine
[1:59:05] and they were standing there singing
[1:59:07] about 20 of them maybe 30 something like
[1:59:10] that
[1:59:10] sending their singing of the victorious
[1:59:13] power of god their home gone the
[1:59:16] livelihood gone every single round i'm
[1:59:18] gone maybe their freedom naturally
[1:59:21] russia want to take them over because
[1:59:22] the bear is wanting to exercise its
[1:59:25] authority
[1:59:26] and there they were singing i thought
[1:59:28] praise god still able to sing about the
[1:59:31] grace of god what about you you may look
[1:59:33] at how well this is gone and my dreams
[1:59:35] are gone and that's gone but if you got
[1:59:37] enough joy the lord inside of you that
[1:59:40] you can stand and say i maybe look like
[1:59:42] at the end of my rope but my god has
[1:59:44] never lost a battle
[1:59:46] which one are you going to hear the line
[1:59:48] or the tribe of judah or are you going
[1:59:50] to hear this toothless liar that's going
[1:59:53] to tell you there's no way you're going
[1:59:54] to have to believe one or the other
[1:59:56] you're going to have to believe the
[1:59:57] voice that said you can't come back
[1:59:59] you're going to have to believe the
[2:00:00] voices said this preacher's prayed for
[2:00:02] you and that one's prayed for you and
[2:00:04] you didn't get the holy ghost but who
[2:00:06] knows tonight might be your night friend
[2:00:08] tonight might be your night and if you
[2:00:10] don't get it tonight i'll be back in the
[2:00:11] morning and tomorrow night and the next
[2:00:14] morning and the next night you say lord

[2:00:19] ghost
[2:00:31] hallelujah
[2:00:33] standing
[2:00:35] on this dark day
[2:00:38] it is so dark friends
[2:00:41] when brother branham looked
[2:00:44] and he looked into that realm
[2:00:46] he could not see past 1977. now many
[2:00:49] people try to take that and twist it
[2:00:51] around it make him a false prophet he
[2:00:53] never said he prophesied in the first
[2:00:54] place
[2:00:55] he said i predict
[2:00:57] so you imagine as he's looking out
[2:00:58] through that realm by vision and he
[2:01:00] cannot see any farther than 1977.
[2:01:04] you know where that puts us
[2:01:07] from 77 till now
[2:01:09] it's been so dark
[2:01:11] that the prophet couldn't even see past
[2:01:13] it
[2:01:14] no wonder you're fighting the powers of
[2:01:16] hell every day how many knows what i'm
[2:01:18] talking about every day of your life
[2:01:21] well used two years ago my i used to

[2:02:08] the darkness is pressing
[2:02:11] the ghost
[2:02:12] and the darkness
[2:02:15] the wanting to haunt you
[2:02:18] remember cigarettes is not your enemy
[2:02:20] pornography your smartphone no
[2:02:23] it's demons
[2:02:26] demons
[2:02:27] they've gathered right in this building
[2:02:29] right here tonight oh yeah
[2:02:33] you may find it shocking
[2:02:35] but they would follow the prophet's
[2:02:37] meetings
[2:02:39] demons
[2:02:40] and angels
[2:02:42] they'd say the darkness is here and the
[2:02:44] light is here
[2:02:46] i can hear him screaming
[2:02:48] the angels of god walking down the
[2:02:50] aisles he said
[2:02:52] which way will the battle go he said
[2:02:55] it'll depend upon
[2:02:56] your
[2:02:58] face your face
[2:03:02] praise the lord
[2:03:04] well i believe
[2:03:07] that we are going to be more
[2:03:10] than conquerors
[2:03:11] any young men here tonight want to say i
[2:03:14] refuse
[2:03:15] i refuse
[2:03:17] to be the devil's supper
[2:03:19] breakfast or lunch
[2:03:22] what about young ladies
[2:03:24] i refuse i refuse
[2:03:27] i want to give my body my soul
[2:03:31] now all those lines of darkness all they
[2:03:33] could do
[2:03:34] was eat the bodies of those people
[2:03:37] they could never touch their souls
[2:03:39] but this one
[2:03:41] this one
[2:03:42] wants your body
[2:03:44] and your soul
[2:03:47] he knows
[2:03:48] this is the shortest span of time that
[2:03:51] he will have people so people live to be
[2:03:53] 80 years old they live a wicked life and
[2:03:55] they die
[2:03:57] satan knows okay no big deal
[2:03:59] i'll take them
[2:04:00] to the lake of fire
[2:04:03] and there i'll have them for maybe
[2:04:04] hundreds of years
[2:04:06] or thousands
[2:04:08] of years
[2:04:12] which will it be
[2:04:14] you're going to hear the line of the
[2:04:15] tribe of judah
[2:04:17] as he whispers his message of redemption
[2:04:21] and love and salvation but brother
[2:04:22] donnie i am so filthy
[2:04:25] my god specializes
[2:04:27] in picking up filthy vessels
[2:04:30] [Music]
[2:04:32] some of us we don't even want to get our
[2:04:34] hands dirty dealing with some people
[2:04:37] it's it's pretty bad i mean a lot of
[2:04:39] these preachers these brothers right
[2:04:40] here are guaranteed they have dealt with
[2:04:41] some filthy cases
[2:04:43] filthy lives of people
[2:04:45] and there's a reproach there's a
[2:04:46] preacher even doing it
[2:04:48] but our god is so loving and so
[2:04:50] wonderful that he can reach down and
[2:04:53] pick up your life oh you say but i come
[2:04:55] here today with cigarettes i come drink
[2:04:57] and i i sinned even today
[2:04:59] well acknowledge that
[2:05:01] and that's the lord to forgive you
[2:05:04] and pick you up out of that old filthy
[2:05:06] barnyard
[2:05:07] and wash you
[2:05:09] and cleanse you
[2:05:10] and fill you with the holy ghost before
[2:05:12] you leave this place
[2:05:14] or
[2:05:15] you will become satan's meal next week
[2:05:19] or the week after remember you'll never
[2:05:21] be the same
[2:05:22] after this meeting
[2:05:24] either you'll be better
[2:05:26] or you'll be worse we can't be the same
[2:05:29] we can't be the same god called these
[2:05:31] meetings i think it's more than brother
[2:05:32] tim would you i think he's more than
[2:05:34] brother tim i believe god did it
[2:05:38] amen
[2:05:40] but i want to be a better person when i
[2:05:41] pull out of here lord willing on sunday
[2:05:44] i want to be a better man
[2:05:46] i want to be closer to god
[2:05:49] when the devil roars after me and he's
[2:05:51] roared after me my whole life
[2:05:53] i give my heart to the lord when i was a
[2:05:55] 12 year old boy and started preaching
[2:05:56] when i was 18. so i've been preaching
[2:05:58] almost all my life
[2:06:00] and he roars and he roars and he still
[2:06:03] does
[2:06:04] and he wants to scare me
[2:06:06] and make me fear
[2:06:10] but i found out a long time ago
[2:06:13] i can listen to his roars and be
[2:06:15] intimidated by him
[2:06:16] or i can listen to the coos
[2:06:19] of the dove of the holy ghost
[2:06:22] as he's drawing us closer and closer i
[2:06:24] mean brother tim was talking to us i
[2:06:26] guess some of the message brothers have
[2:06:27] been studying on russia more and he said
[2:06:29] yeah probably some of them having said
[2:06:30] but i ain't
[2:06:31] he said i've actually been studying more
[2:06:33] on how to get people filled with the
[2:06:35] holy ghost
[2:06:36] how to get them a ticket in their hand
[2:06:38] to be able to leave this world in a
[2:06:40] rapture
[2:06:42] can we bow our heads
[2:06:46] i wonder on the first night here tonight
[2:06:48] maybe there's some that's
[2:06:50] you're not where you need to be with the
[2:06:52] lord we're not going to be here to look
[2:06:54] at you and judge you and none of that
[2:06:57] but you say really you describe my life
[2:06:59] i'm out in that barnyard i'm so filthy
[2:07:02] i'm so dirty i'm so ashamed
[2:07:04] anyone you'd like to be remembered just
[2:07:06] raise your hand to the lord not not to
[2:07:08] us preachers
[2:07:09] god bless you
[2:07:11] god bless you friends
[2:07:12] god bless you may the lord help you
[2:07:15] maybe there's others of you that you're
[2:07:16] picked up out of the yard
[2:07:18] but you're in the sanctification process
[2:07:20] you're still hanging on to habits and
[2:07:22] this and that and you need the lord to
[2:07:24] help you you raise your hand to the lord
[2:07:26] god bless you
[2:07:28] maybe there's others heavy that you're
[2:07:29] washed you're sitting up on the counter
[2:07:32] of god
[2:07:33] you've been there for five years ten
[2:07:36] but you know but the way you live you
[2:07:38] still don't have the holy ghost
[2:07:40] because you have to make yourself live
[2:07:42] this life
[2:07:43] the prophet tells us how can overcome
[2:07:45] it's not a life that you force yourself
[2:07:47] to live it's lived out of you
[2:07:48] automatically
[2:07:52] and if you're here tonight that way and
[2:07:53] you say
[2:07:54] i need to be filled
[2:07:56] not just in the visible audience but
[2:07:58] streaming as well
[2:08:01] all right let's break together in this
[2:08:02] belief when we pray
[2:08:06] heavenly father
[2:08:08] as we bow our heads to the dust of the
[2:08:10] earth from whence we came
[2:08:13] the first night lord
[2:08:15] of what we believe to be
[2:08:17] a great great meeting
[2:08:20] our hearts have been under such
[2:08:21] anticipation
[2:08:22] [Music]
[2:08:23] lord god i pray in the name of jesus
[2:08:27] may you deal with every heart tonight
[2:08:29] you saw the hands this is like a
[2:08:31] one-room schoolhouse as it were
[2:08:33] we have people of all different
[2:08:35] spiritual levels speech spiritual
[2:08:37] understanding
[2:08:38] so may you deal with every one of them
[2:08:40] on their level father
[2:08:42] oh lord god may you
[2:08:44] deliver those that maybe have got habits
[2:08:46] and besetting sins
[2:08:49] lord they've been around the church in
[2:08:50] the message for years but they've never
[2:08:53] really moved beyond that
[2:08:55] father may this be the meeting
[2:08:58] that they can say i'm free
[2:09:00] i'm free
[2:09:02] lord maybe some's been picked up out of
[2:09:04] that barnyard
[2:09:06] and they're in the process of
[2:09:07] sanctification
[2:09:09] when they get angry they still lose
[2:09:10] their temper and say words they
[2:09:12] shouldn't
[2:09:13] lord they they have resentment in their
[2:09:15] hearts and this and that and they're
[2:09:16] they're being washed but they're just
[2:09:18] not quite clean yet
[2:09:20] you saw the hands it was uplifted in
[2:09:22] that category and the others lord that
[2:09:24] believe that they've been picked up and
[2:09:26] they've been washed and sanctified
[2:09:29] but they're still empty
[2:09:31] lord god your prophet said you're
[2:09:33] wanting empty vessels
[2:09:35] and if you can get those empty vessels
[2:09:37] and you will fill them with yourself
[2:09:40] you'll send them out to conquer the
[2:09:41] world
[2:09:43] how angry hell must be
[2:09:46] satan and all of his demons
[2:09:48] has our nation under control
[2:09:51] they have our president's office under
[2:09:53] control
[2:09:54] congress senate
[2:09:56] every senate of the state
[2:09:59] the nations of the world but there's a
[2:10:01] group of people on the face of the earth
[2:10:03] he cannot get and it makes him so angry
[2:10:07] [Music]
[2:10:08] of all the people on the face of the
[2:10:10] earth why are these people still here he
[2:10:14] hates us
[2:10:16] so if he can't get our soul he'll try to
[2:10:18] afflict our bodies and if he don't
[2:10:20] afflict us he'll try to afflict our
[2:10:22] children
[2:10:24] lord god
[2:10:26] help us father
[2:10:28] but lord jesus give us the strength as
[2:10:31] your children
[2:10:32] to stand and face this enemy
[2:10:35] not with our strength we don't want to
[2:10:37] be strong like peter was in his flesh
[2:10:39] but lord god we want to say not through
[2:10:41] me
[2:10:42] but through him who lives in me
[2:10:45] hallelujah
[2:10:47] oh jesus may your presence sweep down
[2:10:49] this way tonight lord have been
[2:10:51] listening to the brother and brethren
[2:10:53] saying that satan is howling and he's on
[2:10:56] the rampage and he uses that statement
[2:10:58] several times satan is howling he's
[2:11:00] howling
[2:11:02] oh
[2:11:03] lord how beautiful it was the other day
[2:11:04] when you spoke to him and i was down the
[2:11:05] basement listen to the prophet saying
[2:11:07] that
[2:11:08] and you said he's howling but i'm cooing
[2:11:12] praise god
[2:11:13] you're cooing to your little bride
[2:11:16] oh hallelujah you're cooing to your
[2:11:19] bride
[2:11:20] that's what it was when moses pinned it
[2:11:22] there in genesis
[2:11:24] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[2:11:26] face of the deep and the word there is
[2:11:29] ruach elohim
[2:11:31] ruach elohim and the hebrew word is as a
[2:11:35] mother bird as she gathers her little
[2:11:38] chicks together and you brood it over
[2:11:40] the earth
[2:11:41] oh jesus come by tonight father brood
[2:11:45] over our hearts lord
[2:11:47] ruok elohim
[2:11:49] brood over my heart brood over me jesus
[2:11:54] hallelujah
[2:11:56] we worship you lord god
[2:11:59] we worship you
[2:12:01] can we just worship him now just a
[2:12:03] little bit before we go
[2:12:06] look at me for just a moment
[2:12:08] that vessel which was filthy dirty and
[2:12:10] nasty
[2:12:11] now administers back to me
[2:12:14] the prophet tells us in question answer
[2:12:15] 64
[2:12:17] when rebecca
[2:12:18] went and got those pots and started
[2:12:21] watering those camels and whenever you
[2:12:23] multiplied and see how many gallons
[2:12:26] she had to have for those camels it was
[2:12:28] phenomenal she was packing back and
[2:12:30] forth about six or seven hours
[2:12:33] to be able to get those camels enough
[2:12:35] water you imagine she's probably ringing
[2:12:37] wet with sweat and she was just worn out
[2:12:41] but little did she know
[2:12:43] those beasts she was watering was the
[2:12:45] same ones that was going to carry her to
[2:12:47] her bridegroom
[2:12:49] so when you praise him you're watering
[2:12:52] you're blessing his name
[2:12:55] let's water tonight you know oh he said
[2:12:57] but i'm tired and i'm weary that's one
[2:12:59] of the best times
[2:13:01] to give him a sacrifice
[2:13:03] of praise
[2:13:05] amen can we just worship me brother
[2:13:07] timothy would you sing something for us
[2:13:09] can we just worship him we'll let you go
[2:13:11] here just momentarily but may the spirit
[2:13:13] of god just be able to come by
[2:13:16] and flood her over our hearts cool
[2:13:20] cool
[2:13:22] brother charlie cox told me one time
[2:13:23] brother brown was down there in the year
[2:13:25] 1956
[2:13:26] there were some power lines over brother
[2:13:28] charlie's driveway in his house there
[2:13:31] maybe some doves that would get out
[2:13:32] there
[2:13:33] and they would coo he said brother
[2:13:35] branham would go out there and he'd
[2:13:37] listen to them doves he makes mention of
[2:13:39] it and god making a way in brooklyn new
[2:13:41] york 1956
[2:13:43] and he said them doves they just cool
[2:13:46] and they make love to one another
[2:13:48] and they take their little necks and
[2:13:50] they just wrap around one another
