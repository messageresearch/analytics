[14:43] Amen. Amen. Let's pray together.
[14:49] Father, Lord, what we know is that you
[14:51] are in control of every situation and
[14:54] everything. I just pray right now, Lord,
[14:56] that you'll just come and move in this
[14:58] service, speak in this service, Father.
[15:01] Lord, have your way. Things always go
[15:03] according to your plan. And I just pray
[15:05] that you would just help us now to step
[15:06] aside and allow you to use us, Lord,
[15:09] however you would see fit, Father. We
[15:11] commit this time to you, Lord, and ask
[15:14] that you would just take control now. In
[15:15] Jesus name we pray.
[15:17] Amen.
[15:19] Amen. Well, I I I'll tell you so that
[15:23] you can uh pray with me. We uh very
[15:28] interesting.
[15:30] Hello. Hello. There we go. Yeah, it's
[15:33] going to continue to be interesting. I
[15:34] can tell. Uh you know, the Wi-Fi has
[15:38] been in and out and crashing over and
[15:40] over all day. So, a while ago, I went
[15:42] back there to put the finishing touches
[15:43] on the sermon that I worked on all day,
[15:46] and it is
[15:48] gone. Does not exist. So, so here we
[15:50] are. Uh, it completely I'd opened it and
[15:53] saved it throughout the day. Uh, had 30
[15:56] something pages. And while ago, I got
[15:58] there in the back to open it to finish
[15:59] the last little bit, and there was three
[16:01] pages. So, it is what it is, and what we
[16:05] rest in is that God's in control. you
[16:07] know, I might have had 27 pages of stuff
[16:09] that he said, "Nope, that don't need to
[16:12] be said tonight." So, that's fine.
[16:13] That's just where we are. You know, I I
[16:15] still have my PowerPoint, uh, which is
[16:18] just a few slides of things that I like
[16:20] to put up for y'all to be able to go
[16:22] along with me, but it is what it is.
[16:24] We're not going to worry about it. We're
[16:25] going to take our time and and I'm I'm
[16:28] going to be very aware of of the time
[16:30] element tonight, knowing that we have a
[16:31] skit to follow this. And I want to give
[16:33] them plenty of time to prepare for that.
[16:36] So, do we have the PowerPoint ready to
[16:38] go? Let's put that up so we can so we
[16:41] can get started. We're going to begin by
[16:42] reading in the book of
[16:44] Revelation. And we're going to read from
[16:46] chapter 3 verse 14 verse uh for the 14-
[16:52] 22 as we read about the Leodysian church
[16:55] age here. And it says, ' And unto the
[16:58] angel of the church of the Leadyans,
[17:00] write these things, saith the Amen, the
[17:02] faithful and the true witness, the
[17:04] beginning of the creation of God. I know
[17:07] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[17:09] hot, I would thou were cold or hot. So
[17:12] then, because thou art lukewarm, and
[17:14] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[17:16] out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I
[17:18] am rich and increase with goods, and
[17:20] have need of nothing, and knowest not
[17:22] that thou art wretched, and miserable,
[17:24] and poor, and blind, and naked. I
[17:26] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[17:28] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[17:30] white raignnt that thou mayest be
[17:33] clothed and that the shame of thy
[17:34] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[17:37] eyes with eyes that thou mayest see. As
[17:40] many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be
[17:43] zealous, therefore, and repent. Behold,
[17:46] I stand at the door and knock. If any
[17:48] man hear my voice and open the door, I
[17:51] will come into him and will s with him
[17:53] and he with me. To him that overcomemeth
[17:55] will I grant to sit with me in my
[17:57] throne, even as I also overcame, and am
[18:01] set down with my father in his
[18:05] throne. He that hath an ear, let him
[18:08] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[18:10] churches. Amen. You can have your seats
[18:13] this
[18:14] evening. Amen. Very early on in in the
[18:17] church age study, brother Brandham
[18:19] points uh to an early key to a key in
[18:22] the church age book that helped him with
[18:24] his study and and all his studies. And
[18:27] we point to it every time because it's
[18:28] of such vital importance. And he said
[18:32] the key is that the is the revelation
[18:35] that God never changes and that his ways
[18:37] are as unchangeable as he is. Amen. So
[18:41] Hebrews 13:8, we know that that is the
[18:44] the the theme of our message, that Jesus
[18:46] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[18:49] forever. And this really is the the key
[18:51] to it all. It's the keystone to the
[18:54] entire Bible that that God never
[18:57] changes. The world around us changes,
[18:59] people's attitude changes, um things are
[19:02] constantly changing, and yet God never
[19:05] changes. And so tonight, you can you can
[19:07] rest on his word. You can rest on his
[19:09] promises. And you can you can rest
[19:11] assured that he's going to do exactly
[19:13] what he said do. If if he loved
[19:15] something yesterday, he loves it today.
[19:17] If he hated something yesterday, he
[19:19] hates it today. And and when all else is
[19:21] changing and failing, this word can
[19:24] never fail. And this word can never
[19:26] change. Amen. And so we we looked last
[19:29] time at at the the Leodysian age was in
[19:32] part one and we know it began around
[19:35] 1906 and it runs up through present
[19:37] times. We see Leodysia in the bottom
[19:39] right hand corner here of our map and it
[19:42] means people's rights and Leodysia was
[19:46] actually a very common name back then
[19:49] and it like I said it meant people's
[19:50] rights or justice of the people's and
[19:54] and we discussed last time how you know
[19:56] we believe in in treating people right
[19:59] it's not that we're against people's
[20:00] rights we're for people's rights but but
[20:02] at the heart of this age that there's a
[20:05] push to make everything equal no matter
[20:08] how preposterous it is. And they try to
[20:11] make everything equal. And I just want
[20:13] to say tonight that two does not equal
[20:15] three, no matter how many times that
[20:17] they say it does. Amen. That there's a
[20:21] it's preposterous. But the truth behind
[20:23] this push isn't isn't a true equality.
[20:26] It's that's not the push. The truth is
[20:28] it's an attack on biblical standards a
[20:31] and and on social norms that were formed
[20:34] by those biblical standards. Amen. And
[20:38] and and so social norms are even under
[20:41] attack. And you may say, okay, well,
[20:43] what's the big deal about about social
[20:45] norms? What is
[20:47] normal? Normal means conforming to a
[20:51] standard. Usual, typical, or expected. I
[20:56] want to focus on that for a minute.
[20:58] Normal means conforming to a standard.
[21:01] Usual, typical, or expected. And for so
[21:06] many years, so it's talking about
[21:08] conforming to a standard. And for so
[21:10] many years, what was that
[21:12] standard? For so many years, that
[21:14] standard was set by the Bible. And so
[21:18] the usual behavior of most people was
[21:21] behavior that was influenced by that
[21:24] standard. So what was normal was to act
[21:27] the way the Bible said act. That was
[21:30] normal. That was usual. That was the
[21:32] expected behavior. It was the typical
[21:35] behavior and the expected behavior of
[21:37] people in society was influenced by the
[21:40] Bible. And maybe it was at different
[21:42] levels. Not everybody believed the Bible
[21:44] the same. Not everybody um was maybe as
[21:46] fervent about it. And so it was at
[21:48] different levels, but still it was the
[21:50] major influence of our society. That's
[21:53] why we were called a Christian nation.
[21:55] If you were born in this nation today
[21:57] and you hear we're a Christian nation,
[21:58] that may not make sense to you because
[22:00] we don't seem to be that anymore. We're
[22:02] not that anymore. But it was based on
[22:05] that norm. It was based on that
[22:07] standard. But what is the standard
[22:10] today? Whatever you want it to be.
[22:13] Whatever makes you feel good. Whatever
[22:16] doesn't offend people or hurt people's
[22:18] feelings or whatever the media portrays
[22:21] as the norm. Whatever Hollywood sets
[22:24] before the people. Because today, what
[22:27] most young people coming up feed on and
[22:29] adults too isn't the word of God
[22:31] anymore. It isn't the Bible anymore.
[22:34] It's it's their social media feed or the
[22:36] news feed or the entertainment that
[22:38] they're constantly drawing from on a
[22:41] daily basis. And so that's what presents
[22:44] them with what normal is.
[22:48] So, I want you to just stop and think
[22:49] about that for a minute and maybe we'll
[22:50] just hunker down here here for a minute
[22:53] because I I think you know, and I I've
[22:56] made it clear that that we're not the
[22:58] the the entertainment police. We can't
[23:02] legislate to you what you should feed
[23:04] on, what you shouldn't, what you should
[23:05] watch, what you shouldn't.
[23:09] The truth of the matter is that I
[23:10] learned a long time ago, if you'll just
[23:12] focus on getting people to fall more in
[23:14] love with Jesus, those things will take
[23:15] care of themselves. I can get you to not
[23:18] watch nothing and not read nothing and
[23:19] live in a hole in the ground, but if you
[23:21] don't get the Holy Ghost, none of that's
[23:22] going to matter. So, I don't want to
[23:24] focus on make sure you're not doing this
[23:26] and make sure you're not doing that.
[23:27] What I want you to do tonight is go
[23:29] deeper with Jesus. I want you to fall
[23:31] more in love with Jesus and seek more of
[23:33] God and it'll legislate itself. Amen.
[23:36] So, so my point being is I'm I'm not
[23:37] here to to to be the entertainment
[23:40] police, but but the fact of the matter
[23:41] is if that's what you set before you
[23:44] constantly and you feed on that and you
[23:47] feed on that and you feed on that, what
[23:48] it does is it shifts your view of what
[23:51] normal
[23:53] is. And I I kind of got on this a bit
[23:55] when I was preaching up at brother
[23:57] Matt's last last week. If all you ever
[24:00] knew was the Bible, you had no outside
[24:03] influence. If all you ever knew was
[24:06] Evening Light
[24:08] Tabernacle, if that's all you knew was
[24:10] the Bible and the message and the people
[24:12] around you, what would your view of
[24:15] marriage
[24:16] be? What would your view of courtship
[24:19] be? What would your view of normal
[24:23] be? But what happens is all of us are
[24:26] exposed to outside influences. Whether
[24:28] it be at work, whether it be at school,
[24:30] whether it be what we're feeding on. And
[24:32] so those influences move our opinion or
[24:36] ideas of what normal is. So what is
[24:38] normal, brother Aaron? What's normal is
[24:41] what the word of God says. You want the
[24:44] word of God to be your center and to be
[24:46] your focus and to be where you establish
[24:48] your normal. Because what happens is the
[24:51] more even clean entertainment, what I
[24:54] want you to understand is what is
[24:56] Hollywood?
[24:58] It's not a bunch of good folks going,
[25:00] "Let's make movies to to strengthen the
[25:02] core of the American family. Let's make
[25:06] movies so that people really want to be
[25:08] in church on Sunday and we want to
[25:10] strengthen marriages and we want No,
[25:12] that's not that that's not what they
[25:14] want. They want to influence your idea
[25:16] of
[25:18] normal. They want a movie. So even if
[25:21] you feed on clean entertainment
[25:23] constantly and this clean and maybe
[25:24] there's nothing in it that I could point
[25:26] to and go, "Man, that's awful. You
[25:28] shouldn't see that." But if that is your
[25:29] steady diet, if that's all you're seeing
[25:32] and that's all you're feeding on, then
[25:34] your your your normal is getting moved
[25:37] to where when a standard is placed
[25:39] before you by a father or by a pastor,
[25:42] you go, "Why can't we just be normal?
[25:47] What
[25:48] normal? Hollywood's normal or the
[25:50] Bible's normal.
[25:53] The books that you've been reading is
[25:54] normal or the books normal.
[25:58] And you get to the place where you began
[26:00] to say things like, "Well, that's just
[26:03] oldfashioned. That's just oldfashioned."
[26:05] Well, why don't we just reword that and
[26:07] see if you still feel that way? Because
[26:09] remember, oldfashioned, what was
[26:11] oldfashioned based
[26:13] on the Bible, right?
[26:17] So instead of saying that's just
[26:18] oldfashioned, next time you want to buck
[26:20] up against something that the preacher
[26:22] says or mama says or dad says, just word
[26:24] it like this and see if you still feel
[26:26] that way. Dad, that's just what God
[26:32] wants. Dad, why do you got to do
[26:34] everything that the Lord
[26:35] wants? Why don't we just start saying it
[26:37] like that instead of saying, "Dad,
[26:39] that's so
[26:44] oldfashioned. Dad, why do we got to do
[26:46] that? That's just the
[26:48] Bible. But instead, we make it sound
[26:51] better by going, "That's just old.
[26:52] That's just Dad. Nobody does that
[26:54] anymore. Nobody thinks that way
[26:56] anymore." I
[26:58] know. That's the problem. That's what
[27:01] we're talking about. But we're allowing
[27:03] nonsense to become our
[27:07] normal. And so, what am I saying
[27:09] tonight? Let's get back to the true
[27:11] normal. Let's get back to the reality of
[27:13] what God wants. and make that the basis
[27:16] for our decisions because you watch
[27:18] those and you watch the, you know, movie
[27:19] after movie or book after book and your
[27:21] idea of how dating supposed to be done
[27:23] changes. Your idea of how marriage is
[27:25] supposed to be changes, you know, and
[27:27] and and I made the the the joke. It's
[27:30] not really a joke, but I said, you'll
[27:32] find yourself watching something and
[27:35] you're rooting for the, you know, oh, I
[27:38] sure hope this guy ends up with this
[27:41] girl and this guy and this girl are both
[27:44] married to other people. And you're like
[27:46] sitting there, why don't you just come
[27:47] out and say, I'm rooting for adultery in
[27:49] this movie. Nobody would say that. But
[27:53] what are you doing? I'm just being
[27:56] honest. Our normal gets moved. our idea
[28:00] of what's okay and what's not okay gets
[28:03] moved and it changes our view and it
[28:06] begins to influence what normal is. So
[28:09] that's that's why the word of God tells
[28:11] us let this mind be in you which was
[28:14] also in Christ
[28:16] Jesus. Don't think like the world.
[28:19] Romans 12:2 says, "And be not conformed
[28:22] to this world, but be you transformed by
[28:25] the renewing of your mind that you may
[28:28] prove what is that good and acceptable
[28:32] and perfect will of God." Let's renew
[28:36] our minds tonight, young people, how do
[28:38] I do that? Get back into the word. Seek
[28:41] more of God. You know, are you saying
[28:43] entertainment's wrong? No, I'm not
[28:45] saying that. But I'm saying when it
[28:46] begins to raise to the level of
[28:47] importance in your life as the word of
[28:50] God or you begin to give it the same
[28:52] amount of time as you give your
[28:53] relationship with God and you begin to
[28:56] develop more of a thirst for that water
[28:59] than for the wellsp springsings of life
[29:01] that come out of the word of God,
[29:02] there's a problem there. We need to
[29:04] check up, step back, and say, "I need to
[29:07] let a different mind be in me. I need to
[29:09] renew my mind. I I need to quit being
[29:11] conformed to this world because it's a
[29:13] snare. It's attract. I used to tell
[29:16] people all the time if I was ever
[29:18] addicted to anything, it was
[29:19] entertaining my
[29:21] flesh. Entertaining this spirit. I
[29:23] always wanted to be entertained. I
[29:25] always wanted to be entertained. And we
[29:26] become addicted to
[29:29] entertainment. But I say, let's get a
[29:31] different addiction tonight. Uh let's
[29:33] get a drinking problem tonight. Let's
[29:34] start drinking from the fountain of
[29:36] life. There's a fountain open in the
[29:38] house of David. Let's draw from that
[29:40] tonight. and let's drink and let's drink
[29:42] and let's drink to where that's the
[29:44] water that our soul
[29:46] craves. Amen.
[29:50] The messenger to our
[29:53] age, William Marryiam Brham. We can say
[29:56] that without a doubt and unashamedly, a
[29:59] vindicated prophet, vindicated by signs
[30:03] and wonders and and and you know, we
[30:05] went through the whole thing last time
[30:06] and and talked about how he established
[30:09] how each messenger would be based off
[30:11] the key that God doesn't change. And and
[30:14] so he said if God chose Paul to be the
[30:16] first church age messenger, then every
[30:18] messenger that would come after that
[30:20] would be the ministry that most
[30:22] resembled Paul's ministry. And you and
[30:25] you look at this ministry and and you
[30:27] look at the the fact that night after
[30:30] night after night that whenever he
[30:32] preached it wasn't man coming down
[30:34] saying amen. It wasn't man coming down
[30:36] saying this is good. Matter of fact man
[30:38] was against him but night after night
[30:40] the pillar of fire would come down into
[30:42] the services and the pillar of fire
[30:44] would say amen this is the truth. This
[30:47] is a vindicated message. Listen we may
[30:50] look at it sometimes and go oh that's
[30:52] oldfashioned. the pillar of fire came
[30:53] down and said, "This is the truth. This
[30:55] is what pleases me." God wouldn't come
[30:58] down and put an amen on a
[31:01] lie. God wouldn't come down and do the
[31:03] things he did behind a lie.
[31:07] You you you think about it, and I
[31:09] believe I have this right, but one of
[31:11] the first very first times brother
[31:13] Brandham talks about me meeting the
[31:15] angels in the cloud coming down and
[31:18] there there in Arizona is when brother
[31:19] Wayey falls dead in the service.
[31:22] And so right there after he's told all
[31:24] that and people want to say, "Well, that
[31:26] wasn't true. That wasn't true." Brother
[31:28] Way falls dead in the service and
[31:29] brother Brandham goes down and calls him
[31:31] back and God raises the dead in that
[31:34] very service right behind the testimony
[31:36] of the meeting the seven angels. God
[31:39] doesn't come down and vindicate a lie.
[31:42] He came down and said, "This is the
[31:43] truth, and I'm going to restore life to
[31:45] vindicate that this is the truth." This
[31:48] was the messenger to our
[31:51] age. We covered the seven visions that
[31:55] he had in 1933 and the the scriptures
[31:57] that pointed to an Elijah ministry there
[32:00] in Matthew 17 and also Malachi 4. And we
[32:03] we we focused on the turning of the
[32:05] hearts. How there was two parts to that
[32:07] from from the fathers to the children
[32:10] which which is what John the Baptist
[32:12] came and did. And then also from the
[32:14] children to the fathers which was the
[32:16] Elijah ministry of this day. And in this
[32:19] age the leadyian age there were two
[32:23] indictments. One was that the people
[32:25] were lukewarm and another was that they
[32:28] say they are rich and have need of
[32:33] nothing. We'll look at lukewarm for just
[32:35] a moment.
[32:39] Brother Brandham says here, "Then what
[32:41] is wrong with these people of the last
[32:43] day? They've gotten away from the word.
[32:46] They are no longer fervent about it.
[32:49] They are lukewarm about it." What do we
[32:53] mean by that? What What does the term
[32:54] mean? I know we talk about it means it's
[32:56] neither cold nor hot. And then so
[32:59] therefore, you know, lukewarm, you're
[33:00] going to be spewed out of the mouth of
[33:02] God. But let's just bring it down into a
[33:04] way we can discuss it for our individual
[33:06] lives. lukewarm about it doesn't mean
[33:10] necessarily that you sit in church
[33:12] lukewarm, although you
[33:14] will. But too many times we like to talk
[33:17] about our Christian life and based it on
[33:19] Sunday and
[33:22] Wednesday and and I do care, but just
[33:25] understand what I'm saying. I don't
[33:27] really care what you're doing in here on
[33:30] Sunday and Wednesday. That doesn't tell
[33:32] me anything about your Christian
[33:35] life because anybody can come and be
[33:38] moved and be emotional and be excited.
[33:42] Good Christians can have a bad day and
[33:44] sit there like a bump on a log. Those
[33:46] things can happen both ways. When we
[33:49] talk about lukewarm and being lukewarm
[33:51] about the word, I'm talking about
[33:53] Monday,
[33:54] Tuesday, Thursday, Friday,
[33:57] Saturday. What is your desire for the
[34:00] word? What is your desire to fellowship
[34:03] with Jesus? What is your desire to grow
[34:05] that relationship when you're not here?
[34:09] When you're not surrounded by other
[34:11] believers patting you on the back and
[34:12] other people saying amen and incredible
[34:15] songs being sung and an atmosphere being
[34:17] created. It's easy to worship in that
[34:20] atmosphere. It's easy to to to love God
[34:23] in that atmosphere and we all do and and
[34:25] I encourage you to do so. But when we
[34:28] talk about being
[34:29] fervent, I'm talking about on Monday and
[34:32] Tuesday and Thursday, is there a fervent
[34:34] desire to know him more? Is there a
[34:36] fervent desire to fellowship with him
[34:38] more, to pray more, to listen more, to
[34:41] read more? I'm not even saying you're
[34:44] always going to be perfect and you're
[34:45] never going to miss a day and you're
[34:46] never I'm not saying that. I'm saying is
[34:48] there a burning desire
[34:50] there? Are you filling it with other
[34:52] things? or the channels clogged because
[34:54] there's too much gunk going down it, too
[34:57] much entertainment, that there's no time
[35:00] left. I say it all the time and I'm very
[35:03] open about it that I'll say things like,
[35:05] "Man, this was such a busy week. I
[35:07] didn't have time to do anything." And
[35:09] then I'll get my screen
[35:14] report. Let's be real. I'm swamped.
[35:18] There's no time. I didn't have time.
[35:22] I had time for a lot of stuff
[35:24] apparently. And I did nothing
[35:26] apparently.
[35:30] Either that or somebody stole my
[35:33] phone. We have more time than we think.
[35:36] The thing is is priorities.
[35:39] You will find time for what you want to
[35:41] do.
[35:43] You will find time for the things that
[35:45] you prioritize. When you say, "I don't
[35:48] have time to do that.
[35:51] Once again, why don't we just be honest
[35:52] and say, "I don't want to do
[35:56] that." Because I found out a long time
[35:59] ago, people are going to do what they
[36:01] want to
[36:03] do. And they're going to not have time
[36:05] for the things they don't really want to
[36:07] do. We're all that way.
[36:10] There's been days I did not have time to
[36:12] mow my yard, but I got 18 holes of golf
[36:18] in cuz I wanted to do that more than I
[36:20] wanted to mow my
[36:22] yard. You're going to have time. So,
[36:24] what is a fervent desire for the
[36:28] word? Just just in your own in your own
[36:31] hand. I'm not asking for hand raising.
[36:33] This ain't condemnation. I'm asking us
[36:35] to be honest and look in a mirror and be
[36:36] real with ourselves. The hardest person
[36:38] to tell the truth to is yourself. Man,
[36:41] I've had no time. I've had no
[36:46] time. But if you checked your your
[36:48] screen, I'm just saying if you checked
[36:49] it, you don't think there was no time to
[36:52] mix in a a message somewhere in
[36:55] there. There was no time for a couple of
[37:00] psalms. There was
[37:02] time. Brother Aaron, you're being hard.
[37:04] You know what I'm saying? Tonight's a
[37:06] night to check up and go, God, I want
[37:07] that fire rekindled. I'm going to be
[37:10] honest with myself and say, I haven't
[37:11] been as fervent as I need to be. I
[37:13] haven't been as hungry as I need to be,
[37:15] and I want that desire to be rekindled
[37:17] tonight. I I want I want that desire to
[37:19] raise up above the desire for this and
[37:21] that. I want to be on fire for you,
[37:23] Lord. I want to be fervent. I want a
[37:26] desire in my heart. I don't want it to
[37:28] be, oh, it's Wednesday. I can't believe
[37:31] I got to get off work and go straight to
[37:32] church. I want it to be. I get to get
[37:35] off work and go straight to church. I
[37:37] get to pray. I get to read my Bible.
[37:41] Look, I understand that life tries to
[37:43] choke all those things out. That's why
[37:44] we're saying, "Lord, I need your help. I
[37:47] need you to rekindle it. I need you to
[37:48] set me on fire. I want to be an
[37:51] overcomer.
[37:52] I want to be fervent in my
[37:58] life." Brother Brandon would begin to
[38:01] break this down.
[38:05] The second part of this accusation or or
[38:07] the
[38:08] indictment, Revelations
[38:10] 3 17 and 18 says, "Because thou sayest,
[38:15] I am re rich and increased with goods
[38:16] and have need of nothing and knowest not
[38:18] that thou are wretched and miserable and
[38:19] poor and blind and naked. I counsel thee
[38:22] to buy me gold tried in the fire that
[38:24] thou mayest be rich and white raignment
[38:26] that thou mayest be clothed and that
[38:28] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[38:30] appear and anoint thy eyes with Isav
[38:33] that thou mayest see. Now if we look at
[38:37] the very first phrase of
[38:42] this it says because thou
[38:47] sayest brother says the leas is seeing
[38:49] church ages saying I am reach rich and
[38:51] increased with goods and have need of
[38:52] nothing that was her
[38:55] selfestimate this is the church the
[38:57] modern church she looked at herself and
[39:01] that is what she saw remember what I
[39:04] just told you it's very hard to be
[39:05] honest with
[39:07] oneself very very look I'm that guy that
[39:11] many times I I look in the mirror and I
[39:15] go this color makes me look
[39:19] thinner no you look the same it's just
[39:21] red and not
[39:23] blue but we like to tell ourselves
[39:25] things that make us feel better about
[39:29] ourselves and the church is saying we're
[39:31] rich everything's good and they're not
[39:34] being honest with themselves
[39:36] And brother Brandham says because thou
[39:38] sayest, in other words, it's them, the
[39:41] ones that that are speaking. But just
[39:43] because you say something doesn't mean
[39:46] it's the truth. Just because they're
[39:48] saying we're we're rich and we're we're
[39:50] increased with goods and this and and
[39:53] and we have need of nothing. And God's
[39:56] saying, I never said that about you.
[39:59] That's not my diagnosis of you. That is
[40:02] a self
[40:07] diagnosis. I am increased with
[40:11] goods. It actually means I have
[40:14] spiritual
[40:17] riches. And before I before I go there,
[40:19] I do want to just I want to go back one
[40:22] because the first thing he said
[40:24] was rich.
[40:26] And brother Brandham actually breaks
[40:28] this down and says this literally means
[40:31] with worldly
[40:33] goods. And he says the church is
[40:35] literally bragging we have lots of
[40:38] money. He goes how different is this
[40:42] from the church in the book of Acts that
[40:44] sold everything they had for the good of
[40:46] the
[40:47] gospel that sold everything. And he
[40:50] says, "Look, we're not saying rich
[40:51] people can't go to heaven and rich
[40:52] people can't be spiritual and and
[40:54] blessed churches can't be, you know,
[40:56] doing good things." He said, "But for
[40:59] all the richness they're claiming," he
[41:01] said, "Bigger buildings than we've ever
[41:03] had before, radio programs, millions and
[41:06] millions of dollars pouring in, and yet
[41:08] less works of the Holy Spirit being done
[41:11] than ever
[41:12] before." And I want to tell you there,
[41:14] there's nothing wrong with a good job.
[41:16] There's nothing wrong with a nice house.
[41:18] There's nothing wrong with a nice big
[41:19] church. That's not the point he's
[41:21] making. He's saying, "But when that
[41:23] becomes the focus, when that becomes the
[41:27] focus and not the Holy Spirit working in
[41:29] lives, when we be been saying, we're so
[41:32] blessed because of look at our paycheck.
[41:34] We're so blessed. Look at our building."
[41:36] And he even says, and I can't remember
[41:38] the exact quote, but he says, "Back to
[41:40] the dimly lit buildings, back to the
[41:42] storefronts, back to the small places."
[41:45] Well, he wasn't telling everybody to
[41:47] shut their their church down. What was
[41:48] he saying? Let's get back to the same
[41:50] hunger we used to have. Let's get back
[41:53] to the desperation we used to have when
[41:55] we were willing to stand on the street
[41:57] corners and witness to people and street
[41:59] preach and sing. He goes, "Let's get
[42:01] back to
[42:02] that." And wherever you're at in life
[42:05] tonight, however blessed you've become,
[42:08] wherever your career has led you,
[42:10] wherever marriage and life and kids and
[42:12] all those things, and you look around
[42:13] and say, "I'm so blessed. I thank God
[42:15] for those blessings. But let's make sure
[42:17] we're as desperate as we were the day we
[42:19] came to the altar. Let's make sure that
[42:22] we're as hungry as we were when he first
[42:24] touched our heart and he first touched
[42:25] our lives and say, "I want to get back
[42:27] to that, God. I want the same hunger and
[42:30] the same desire. I want to have the same
[42:32] excitement when your presence moves
[42:34] through this place. Get me back to
[42:36] that." He says they became focused on
[42:39] the wrong
[42:42] riches and then they claim I'm increased
[42:45] with
[42:46] goods. They
[42:48] claim that they have spiritual
[42:55] blessings. He says, "How can this
[42:58] be? How can this be possible? Thou
[43:01] sayest, I'm increased with good." This
[43:02] literally means I have spiritual riches.
[43:07] If the church were truly spiritually
[43:09] rich, its influence would be felt upon
[43:12] the community. What's he mean by this?
[43:15] In other words, there's churches on
[43:16] every corner. Minden has churches
[43:18] everywhere. Boer, Halton, churches
[43:21] everywhere. And yet, what's the
[43:23] impact? The world's getting worse and
[43:26] worse and worse and worse. He's saying
[43:28] if the church was
[43:29] truly spiritually rich and the people
[43:32] that stepped through the doors were
[43:34] truly being changed, if there was truly
[43:37] people being born again, you would see a
[43:39] change in your community. There would be
[43:42] an effect upon lives. He says this,
[43:44] listen to this. Take a good look around
[43:46] you. Now, focus this in as as you
[43:49] consider what is a Christian. What is
[43:51] the effect that the word should have on
[43:54] your life?
[43:56] Take a good look around you. Examine the
[43:58] people as they walk by. In the multitude
[44:02] you see, can you pick out those that
[44:04] have the appearance of
[44:05] Christians? Watch how they
[44:09] dress. Wait, brother. And it matters how
[44:12] we
[44:13] dress.
[44:15] Absolutely. Watch how they dress. Watch
[44:18] how they act. Hear what they say. See
[44:23] where they go.
[44:25] I want to stop and look at that for just
[44:27] a minute. Watch how they dress. Watch
[44:29] how they act. Hear what they say. See
[44:32] where they go. Your testimony isn't just
[44:36] your true testimony. Isn't what you say
[44:40] you
[44:41] are. Your true testimony is what
[44:43] manifest out of your life. He says,
[44:46] "There's Christians everywhere, but
[44:47] let's see how they're dressing. Let's
[44:50] see how they're acting. Let's see how
[44:52] they're talking.
[44:54] Listen young people, I've said this to
[44:56] you before, but there still should be a
[44:59] huge difference in the way you talk and
[45:01] the young people of the world talk. And
[45:04] I'm not even talking about things that
[45:06] you're like, "Well, yeah, I know we
[45:07] shouldn't be cursing." I'm not even
[45:08] talking about that. But if I sit next to
[45:10] a table of message young people on this
[45:13] side and worldly young people on this
[45:15] side, I ought to be able to tell them
[45:17] apart without looking at them.
[45:21] But too many times our conversations
[45:23] have become too loose because what we
[45:26] think is normal,
[45:29] what we consider
[45:32] normal, watch how they act. Listen, I
[45:35] want to I I want to pat you on the back
[45:37] and and testify. I believe Evening Light
[45:40] Tabernacle has an incredible group of
[45:41] young people. Y'all are an incredible
[45:44] testimony to the world that there is a
[45:45] living God, that there is a power that
[45:48] will keep you and change your life. I'm
[45:49] not saying you're all perfect. None of
[45:51] us are. But I look at you and I'm proud
[45:53] of you. I'm proud of what God has done
[45:55] in your life. But I'm just telling you
[45:57] to be aware when you walk in public that
[46:00] they should see something different.
[46:02] They should hear something different.
[46:05] When you're at the restaurant as a big
[46:07] group, I'm not saying you got to sit
[46:08] there and not talk and everybody make
[46:10] sure you talk in a load. I'm not saying
[46:11] that. Sometimes we get the idea, man,
[46:13] you grown-ups don't want us to have any
[46:15] fun. I want you to have all the fun you
[46:17] want. I want you to have a great time,
[46:20] but at the same time do it in a way that
[46:22] when people look at you say there's
[46:24] something different about those young
[46:25] people. I don't know where they're going
[46:28] and what they're doing and what and
[46:29] who's raising them, but there's
[46:31] something different about them. And it's
[46:33] a light shining. Brother Brandham said,
[46:35] "You were put here to light up the age."
[46:38] Think about that. You're not just going
[46:40] through daily life, but you were put
[46:42] here to light up the age in this day.
[46:45] What a responsibility that we have.
[46:48] Light up the age, he
[46:54] says. Take a good look around you. I
[46:57] just read this. We're going to read it
[46:58] again. Examine the people as they walk
[46:59] by. In the multitude, you see, can you
[47:01] pick out those that have the appearance
[47:03] of Christians? There's a way Christians
[47:05] are supposed to
[47:06] look. Watch how they dress. Watch how
[47:09] they
[47:10] act. Should be an A
[47:13] there. Hear what they say. See where
[47:15] they go. Surely there ought to be some
[47:18] real evidence of the new birth amongst
[47:21] all those we see go by, but few there
[47:26] be. Hey, determine in your heart that I
[47:30] want to be one of the few. I want my
[47:32] life to be a life that's a testimony.
[47:35] Don't ever let my life be a snare. Don't
[47:37] ever let my life be a smear. And I'm not
[47:39] even talking about a smear on your
[47:41] family, which it can be, or a smear on
[47:43] Evening Light Tabernacle, which it could
[47:44] be, but I'm talking about a smear on the
[47:47] testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:49] Because we claim he did something for
[47:51] us, then let our life manifest that. Let
[47:54] our life be a witness and a testimony of
[47:57] the power and the grace of Jesus Christ.
[48:01] He goes on talking about the church and
[48:03] they say, "I have need of nothing."
[48:08] He says now when anybody says I have
[48:10] need of nothing he could very well be
[48:12] saying I have everything or he could be
[48:15] saying I don't want anymore as I am full
[48:17] now you can express this any way you
[48:19] want and it all adds up to the fact that
[48:22] the church is
[48:25] complacent now understand there you know
[48:27] there are people that that just don't
[48:29] want anymore you hear them I was saved
[48:32] 25 years ago you hear them you hear it
[48:34] saying all the time I don't need any of
[48:36] that evangelistic preaching You know,
[48:38] God already got a hold of my heart. I
[48:41] don't ever need to go to an altar. I
[48:42] don't ever listen. We believe in a
[48:44] peace. Okay? We believe that when it's
[48:47] settled, that you're sealed to the day.
[48:48] We have faith in the seal, don't we,
[48:50] brother Timothy? That when it's settled,
[48:53] it's
[48:54] settled. But I've often said, and I'll
[48:56] continue to say it, that the greatest
[48:58] evidence that somebody has had an
[48:59] experience with the Holy Ghost is that
[49:02] they want more of the Holy Ghost.
[49:05] They've got a touch of it and they want
[49:07] more of it. They are not complacent. It
[49:10] is not a oneanddone deal. It's one and
[49:12] done as far as the day of redemption.
[49:14] But if you've really got that, you're
[49:16] going to seek more and seek more and
[49:18] you're want to grow more. Listen, there
[49:20] are depths we will never
[49:21] achieve. There there are things about
[49:24] God I believe he'll reveal to us little
[49:26] by little all throughout eternity and
[49:27] we'll still never know all of it. So why
[49:30] are we here? while we're here, how can
[49:32] we act like, well, I've got everything.
[49:35] I know it all. But no, I come on Sunday
[49:37] and I come on Wednesday and when I pray
[49:39] and when I listen to a message, God,
[49:41] show me more of yourself. Reveal more of
[49:44] yourself to me. Draw me closer to you. I
[49:47] don't want to be
[49:48] complacent so many times. And and I've
[49:51] been a part of it and I'm just talking
[49:52] to you from my heart. I've been a part
[49:55] of supernatural moments at this altar,
[49:58] at other altars, at youth camp, to where
[50:00] the power of God drops down and you know
[50:02] it and you feel it. I know it's not in
[50:05] feelings. I'm just telling you, you know
[50:07] it and you feel it and the power hits
[50:10] you and it hits the person you're
[50:11] praying for and they rejoice and they
[50:13] shout and they scream and that's
[50:15] wonderful. I'm for it. Half the time I
[50:17] do, too.
[50:19] But then six months later or seven
[50:21] months later or a year later they're
[50:24] gone. You say, 'Well, nothing really
[50:26] happened. Yes, it
[50:28] did. Something very real
[50:31] happened. But they thought that's
[50:35] it. It settled and there was no
[50:40] progression. There was a spark that hit
[50:42] them and they
[50:44] rejoiced, but they didn't add wood to
[50:46] the fire. They didn't allow the fire to
[50:49] grow in their life and they felt
[50:51] something draw near and it excited them.
[50:53] It excited me too and they ran off on an
[50:56] excitement and they said that that
[50:58] that's
[50:59] it guys come back the next service
[51:02] looking for more. Come back the next
[51:04] service said God I know you touched me
[51:05] but I want to settle the issue. I want
[51:06] to go deeper. Brother Brandham talks
[51:09] about it. He says he says the church's
[51:11] altars are full. He said, "But seldom
[51:13] are people stay in there long enough to
[51:15] break through and settle the
[51:17] issue, guys. It's the last age and it's
[51:20] the the closing of the last age. We we
[51:22] got to be beyond just just, you know, a
[51:25] little churchity. But have you settled
[51:26] the issue
[51:28] tonight? Is there even a little tinge of
[51:30] fear that if the rapture happened in the
[51:34] morning?" Because if you're where you
[51:36] need to be, that overjoys you right now.
[51:39] There's nothing more exciting to you
[51:41] than to think we may not leave this
[51:43] service.
[51:46] But if you don't have that peace, you
[51:48] need to settle the issue.
[51:52] Well, I'm justified. Listen, I'll put it
[51:53] to you like this. Justification's
[51:55] somewhere we all got to go, but that we
[51:58] can't
[52:00] stay. Sanctification is somewhere we all
[52:02] got to go, but you can't stay.
[52:06] I rejoice in what God's done for you up
[52:08] to this point in your life, but let's
[52:09] take another step and not be
[52:12] complacent, not be lukewarm, but go on
[52:15] with God. He said, "If if this church
[52:18] has all of it that it needs, why were
[52:20] they crying out for more of God in the
[52:22] book of Acts?" as though they didn't
[52:24] have it all. And yet, they had far more
[52:28] than what we have today.
[52:30] Think about you read the book of Acts
[52:32] and the upper rooms just happened and
[52:33] you go over just in the next chapter or
[52:36] chapter 4 and there's a refilling and
[52:38] the the place is shaking and they
[52:40] receive more and they're seeking more.
[52:42] They just came from the upper room and
[52:44] they want
[52:45] more. We can't be complacent where we're
[52:48] at. But our cry of our heart tonight is
[52:50] God, I want more of you. I got to grow
[52:53] in you. Amen. But that's their diagnosis
[52:56] of who they are.
[52:59] God has a different
[53:03] diagnosis. He says, "But God saw it
[53:06] otherwise." He said, "You don't know
[53:08] this, but you are wretched. You are
[53:11] miserable. You are poor,
[53:14] blind, and
[53:16] naked." Brother Bram says, "Now, when a
[53:18] people are that way, especially naked
[53:20] and don't know it, there has to be
[53:23] something awfully wrong." Amen to that.
[53:28] He says, "Surely something must be
[53:30] happening." And then he gives us a clue
[53:32] right here to recognize where we're at
[53:34] in time. Think about what happened. Why
[53:37] couldn't the Jews recognize who Jesus
[53:39] was? They were blinded. So that the
[53:42] gospel could come to the Gentiles. So
[53:45] that he might have a a bride for his
[53:47] name's sake pulled from the Gentiles.
[53:49] And so, Brother Brandham points to this
[53:51] and says, "If they can't even see that
[53:54] they're naked," listen to it. He says,
[53:56] "Is it not that God has blinded their
[53:59] eyes as he did the Jews? Is the gospel
[54:03] going back to the Jews? Is history
[54:06] repeating itself?" I say it
[54:09] is. And if we're at the place of the
[54:12] blinding of the Gentile
[54:14] eyes, where the churches are standing up
[54:17] there saying Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, and
[54:19] he's saying they're blind, they're
[54:20] miserable, they're naked, they're
[54:22] wretched, and they don't even know it.
[54:24] Then the prophet of God looks at that
[54:26] and says, "That's not." He said, "Their
[54:27] eyes have been blinded because the
[54:30] gospel is turning back to the Jews. They
[54:32] can't even recognize it." Well, if
[54:34] that's where we're at and that's where
[54:36] we're standing at the blinding of the
[54:37] eyes and the gospel turning back, then
[54:40] I'm telling you, we're standing in some
[54:41] of our final church services. We're
[54:44] having some of our final opportunities.
[54:46] And once again, that's not to scare you.
[54:48] That should rejoice your heart that it's
[54:50] almost going home time. And that if
[54:53] you're not right, you have another
[54:54] opportunity right now. That's right. To
[54:57] get it right, to make it right, to
[54:59] settle the issue.
[55:06] He's talking about this
[55:08] age. He says it's
[55:11] wretched. Wretched and miserable. And
[55:13] think about the world we live in. He
[55:15] says, how strange in this age of plenty,
[55:18] in this age of progress. Now, think
[55:19] about the age we're blessed to live in.
[55:21] I'm going to be honest, man. I look back
[55:23] in in old times and maybe western times
[55:26] and there's there's a little bit of
[55:27] romanticizing about how cool that era
[55:30] was. Man, that have been awful.
[55:35] Once again, we're just not really honest
[55:36] with
[55:38] ourselves. How many of y'all would be
[55:40] here tonight if from where you lived you
[55:42] rode a
[55:44] horse? I'm just saying.
[55:48] And we look back and yeah there are neat
[55:50] things about you know maybe the 50s and
[55:53] in and that time period and and the
[55:55] reason we look back as Christians and
[55:57] like is because we look back and see the
[55:58] morality and how things were better in
[56:00] that way. You like it would have been
[56:02] better. But the fact is you're very
[56:04] blessed to live in the time you live
[56:06] in. Wait till August and turn on the air
[56:09] conditioner and just go thank you. I'm
[56:12] blessed. That's right. Brother Jackson
[56:14] raised his hand.
[56:16] But he says, "How strange in these age
[56:18] of plenty, in the age of progress, in
[56:20] the age of abundance, he says, how can
[56:23] there be trials?" He says, "Well, it's
[56:25] strange, but in the age of plenty,
[56:28] plenty opportunity when everyone has so
[56:30] much and there is so much more to be
[56:32] had. What with all the inventions to do
[56:35] our work, so many things to give us
[56:38] pleasure." And he says, "Think about it.
[56:41] Suddenly we find mental illness taking
[56:43] such a toll as to alarm the nation. This
[56:45] is in '
[56:48] 65. Mental illness since then is I I
[56:51] can't even probably tell you how much
[56:52] it's gone up percentage wise. I wouldn't
[56:55] dare
[56:56] guess when everybody ought to be
[56:59] happy with really nothing to be unhappy
[57:05] about. This is your prophet. You have
[57:09] nothing to be unhappy
[57:13] about.
[57:15] Amen. Millions are taking sedatives at
[57:18] night, pet pills in the morning, rushing
[57:21] to doctors, entering institutions, and
[57:24] trying to drown out unknown
[57:27] fears. People are afraid and don't even
[57:29] know why. Wretched,
[57:33] miserable. Trying to drown out unknown
[57:35] fears by alcohol. Yes, this age boasts
[57:38] of it tremendous stores of worldly
[57:39] goods, but the people are less happy
[57:41] than ever. This age boasts of its
[57:44] spiritual attainments, but the people
[57:45] are less sure of themselves than ever.
[57:48] This age boasts of better moral values,
[57:50] and it is more corrupt than any age
[57:54] since the
[57:56] flood. Wretched and
[58:00] miserable. Miserable means that they are
[58:02] objects to be pied.
[58:05] pied. Think about it. They are poor. I'm
[58:09] just talking about God's diagnosis here.
[58:11] Brother Brown says, "Now, of course,
[58:12] that means spiritually poor. The sign of
[58:15] this age as it
[58:19] closes is bigger and better churches
[58:22] with more and more people with more and
[58:25] more manifestation of what is supposed
[58:28] to be demonstrations of the Holy Ghost.
[58:31] But the filled altars, the gifts of the
[58:34] spirit in operation. Think about this.
[58:35] Now listen, the remarkable attendance is
[58:39] not the answer from
[58:41] God. For those who come to the altars
[58:44] very seldom stay to go on with God. And
[58:47] after the great campaigns are finished,
[58:50] where are all those who came down the
[58:52] aisles? They heard a man. They listened
[58:54] to an appeal. They came into the net.
[58:57] But yet they were not
[59:02] fish. It's an evil
[59:04] age. It's an awful age. He says, "You
[59:07] are blind. You are naked." He says, "I
[59:10] cannot imagine anything as tragic as a
[59:12] man who is blind and naked and does not
[59:14] know it. There's only one answer. He's
[59:16] out of his mind. He is already deep in
[59:19] oblivion. His faculties are gone and
[59:21] spiritual
[59:23] amnesia has set in." They're blind.
[59:26] They're miserable. They're wretched.
[59:28] They're naked. Why are we not in that
[59:30] same
[59:31] condition? Because God sent a message in
[59:34] this day. And because there was a deep
[59:37] on the inside of you that responded to
[59:39] the deep. And we're not blind. Because
[59:41] we see the world through the eyes of an
[59:43] eagle, prophet, messenger who raised up
[59:45] higher above all the things of the
[59:47] world. And he could see the whole
[59:49] picture. And he shared it with you. And
[59:51] you didn't say, "Oh, that's nonsense.
[59:53] Oh, that's that. That's oldfashioned."
[59:55] But you grabbed a hold of that message
[59:57] with all that you were worth and it's
[59:59] opened your eyes and you look around and
[1:00:01] you can recognize insanity. You can
[1:00:03] recognize that that it's wretched and
[1:00:05] it's miserable and the world is falling
[1:00:07] apart. But that's not your condition
[1:00:09] tonight. Praise God. Because you've been
[1:00:11] called. You've been chosen. He said,
[1:00:13] "Come out of her, my people." And he
[1:00:15] given you an opportunity and you've
[1:00:17] seized that opportunity. And tonight,
[1:00:19] you sit here by the grace of God in your
[1:00:22] right mind.
[1:00:24] That's right. not giving in to the
[1:00:26] things of the world, overcoming. You
[1:00:27] don't recognize what a miracle you are
[1:00:30] in this
[1:00:31] day. But you are a
[1:00:33] miracle. You are a wonderful testimony
[1:00:36] that this message is
[1:00:38] truth. You can't do this on your own.
[1:00:40] This is the power of God living his life
[1:00:43] out through a people, manifesting to the
[1:00:45] world that there is a living God. There
[1:00:47] is a truth. There is a peace. You don't
[1:00:50] have to be wretched, miserable, and
[1:00:51] blind and naked. Why are we not naked?
[1:00:54] Because we've been clothed with the word
[1:00:56] of the hour. The messenger of the age
[1:00:58] brought down the wedding garments and he
[1:01:00] said, "Clothe yourself, little bride,
[1:01:02] and we've wrapped ourselves in it
[1:01:04] tonight. We've got gold tried in the
[1:01:06] fire." And we're wearing white raignment
[1:01:08] tonight by the grace of
[1:01:10] God.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah. The final council of the
[1:01:16] ages. Revelation 3:18 and
[1:01:19] 19. He says, "I counsel thee to buy of
[1:01:22] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:01:25] mayest be rich and white raignment that
[1:01:28] thou mayest be clothed, and that the
[1:01:31] shame of thy nakedness do not appear,
[1:01:33] and anoint thine eyes with eyes, that
[1:01:36] thou mayest see. As many as I love, I
[1:01:39] rebuke and chasen." I want to read that
[1:01:42] sentence again.
[1:01:44] As many as I
[1:01:46] love, I rebuke and
[1:01:51] chasen. Be zealous,
[1:01:55] therefore, and
[1:01:57] repent. Now, notice
[1:02:01] here that he directs this last day
[1:02:04] church to one hope.
[1:02:07] He points them back to
[1:02:10] himself. Buy
[1:02:12] of
[1:02:13] me. Come back to me. No. No. Not Notice
[1:02:18] he doesn't say that you don't have
[1:02:21] gold. They've already said they were
[1:02:23] rich. But he's saying you've been
[1:02:25] searching after the wrong kind of gold.
[1:02:27] You've been seeking after the wrong
[1:02:29] things. But he says, "Buy of me gold
[1:02:32] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:02:36] rich." He says come to me and buy. He
[1:02:39] says their transactions although they
[1:02:40] have claimed it to be spiritual cannot
[1:02:42] be spiritual. They may think that they
[1:02:44] are spiritual but how can they be? He
[1:02:48] says buy us of me gold tried in the
[1:02:50] fire. And in other words, he says this
[1:02:54] this is exactly the the organized
[1:02:56] churches of the last day. For it says in
[1:02:59] in verse four, come out of her my
[1:03:01] people. What have they done? They
[1:03:02] they've got gold and they've got riches
[1:03:04] and they put it all in in in huge
[1:03:06] programs and they put it all in in giant
[1:03:08] buildings. They put it all in in radio
[1:03:10] broadcasts and and brother Brown talks
[1:03:12] about those things. He says that that
[1:03:14] looks like a blessing. He says, "But
[1:03:16] understand the snare in all that. The
[1:03:19] snare is that that the men behind the
[1:03:21] pull pit are afraid to preach the truth.
[1:03:24] They're afraid to say things that might
[1:03:26] offend the biggest donor. Are afraid to
[1:03:28] say things that'll keep the money from
[1:03:30] coming in." And he says, "And the gold
[1:03:32] that they have is
[1:03:33] corruptable." But he says, "Buy of me
[1:03:37] gold tried in the fire." What is that
[1:03:38] gold, brother? And what are you talking
[1:03:40] about? First Peter 1:7, "That the trial
[1:03:44] of your faith, being much more precious
[1:03:48] than of gold that
[1:03:50] perisheth." He says, "The gold of God is
[1:03:53] a Christlike character produced in the
[1:03:56] fiery furnace of affliction. That is the
[1:04:00] right kind of gold. He says, "But what
[1:04:04] kind of gold does the church have
[1:04:05] today?" It has but the worldly gold that
[1:04:09] will
[1:04:11] perish. Think about it. When you die,
[1:04:14] what are you taking with you? Once
[1:04:16] again, I've made it very clear. I'm for
[1:04:18] you getting a good education or getting
[1:04:20] a good job and and working to provide
[1:04:22] and having nice things. We're for that.
[1:04:25] I pray those things work out for you.
[1:04:27] But when you die, you're taking none of
[1:04:29] that with you.
[1:04:31] You're taking none of it with you.
[1:04:32] There's only one thing you can take with
[1:04:34] you. One thing that'll go with you
[1:04:36] beyond this place, and that is your
[1:04:38] character. And then will it been? You
[1:04:40] got to ask yourself this question. Is my
[1:04:42] character the character of a soft leotan
[1:04:45] that gets offended by every little
[1:04:47] thing? Have I been molded once again by
[1:04:50] what Leodysa says is normal? Have I been
[1:04:52] molded by movies and books and and
[1:04:55] social media? Is that what's molding me?
[1:04:57] Or is mine the character of Jesus Christ
[1:05:00] that's been molded in trials and molded
[1:05:02] in temptations and molded in battles and
[1:05:05] in every situation? I didn't get
[1:05:07] offended or hurt when the word came and
[1:05:09] chasened me when the word came and
[1:05:12] rebuked me. Did I allow that to mold my
[1:05:14] character? Did I let the potter take the
[1:05:17] clay and break it apart and put it back
[1:05:20] together again? because that's the only
[1:05:23] thing you can take with you is that
[1:05:25] character. He says, "You had better come
[1:05:28] before it's too late, sayeth the Lord,
[1:05:30] and buy of me gold tried in the fire,
[1:05:33] and then you will be truly rich." That's
[1:05:36] the only way. You want to be rich, be
[1:05:37] born again. There is no other richness
[1:05:40] like that. There is no other peace like
[1:05:43] that. There is no other joy like that.
[1:05:46] be born again and and to have a family
[1:05:48] serving God and a marriage built on
[1:05:50] Jesus Christ. You want to be rich?
[1:05:53] That's true riches in this day. All the
[1:05:56] money and the houses and degrees and
[1:05:58] diplomas, it's all going to burn. But
[1:06:00] that is eternal.
[1:06:04] He says, listen to me. Are we getting
[1:06:07] it? Naked we came into the world, but
[1:06:10] naked, he says, spiritually we will not
[1:06:13] leave it. Oh no. We're going to take
[1:06:15] something with us. What that something
[1:06:17] is, all we can take with us. Nothing
[1:06:20] less and nothing more. So, we had better
[1:06:22] be real careful now to see that we take
[1:06:25] something that will make us right before
[1:06:27] God. So, then what will we take with us?
[1:06:30] We will take our character, brother.
[1:06:33] That is what we will take with us. Now,
[1:06:37] what kind of character will you take
[1:06:39] with you? Will it be like his character
[1:06:42] who was molded by suffering in the fiery
[1:06:44] furnace of affliction? Or will it be the
[1:06:47] softness of this characterless Leodysian
[1:06:50] people? It is up to each one of us. For
[1:06:52] in that day every man will bear his own
[1:06:57] burdens. Buy of me gold tried in the
[1:07:01] fire. That the trial of your faith being
[1:07:04] much more precious than of gold that
[1:07:06] perisheth. The gold of God is Christlike
[1:07:09] character produced in the fiery furnace
[1:07:12] of affliction. That is the right kind of
[1:07:16] gold. First Peter 5 and 10. But the God
[1:07:21] of all grace who hath called us unto his
[1:07:23] eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that
[1:07:26] you have suffered a while make you
[1:07:28] perfect, establish, strengthen, settle
[1:07:33] you.
[1:07:34] He says, "You had better come before
[1:07:36] it's too late, sayeth the Lord, and buy
[1:07:38] of me gold tried in the fire that you
[1:07:41] will be truly rich." I want to remind
[1:07:45] you again tonight, we're not saying that
[1:07:46] if you're in a lay and lukewarm
[1:07:49] condition that it's too late for you.
[1:07:51] He's calling even tonight. Come tonight
[1:07:53] and buy gold tried in the fire. Come
[1:07:56] tonight and make your calling and
[1:07:58] election sure. Come tonight and say,
[1:08:01] "Lord, I've been wrong. I've been soft.
[1:08:03] I've been lazy. I've been lukewarm. I
[1:08:05] want that fire and that zealous. I want
[1:08:08] it once again burning in my life and in
[1:08:11] my
[1:08:12] heart. He says, "As many as I love, I
[1:08:15] rebuke and chasen. Be zealous
[1:08:19] therefore and
[1:08:21] repent." Prophet God says to rebuke is
[1:08:23] to reprove. To reprove is to expose with
[1:08:27] a view to correction. Chasen does not
[1:08:30] mean to punish. It means to discipline
[1:08:33] because the subject's amendment is in
[1:08:37] mind. In other
[1:08:40] words, God doesn't punish or or doesn't
[1:08:43] chasen to punish you. He doesn't rebuke
[1:08:47] to punish you. He does it because he
[1:08:49] wants to make you better. He wants you
[1:08:52] to come out as gold. Come out as pure
[1:08:55] gold. And he's saying, "Be zealous,
[1:08:57] therefore, and and repent. I I rebuke
[1:09:00] and I chasen those that I
[1:09:03] love. Listen, don't don't get offended
[1:09:06] when the minister's preaching and he
[1:09:07] starts hammering on things that you know
[1:09:09] you've been doing. Don't don't be like
[1:09:12] Cain and get all
[1:09:13] upset, but examine
[1:09:17] yourself. That's what we come to the
[1:09:19] house of God for. Sometimes we we we
[1:09:21] forget that correction
[1:09:23] begins the house of
[1:09:26] God and and our mindset gets a little
[1:09:29] warped. Sometimes we're twisted. There's
[1:09:30] many times, man, the preaching goes
[1:09:34] forth and it's joyful and it's exuberant
[1:09:36] and people run and shout and man, it's
[1:09:38] awesome. And we leave and go, man, that
[1:09:40] was awesome. That was a good service.
[1:09:42] But how many times do you come to a
[1:09:44] service where the preacher stomps on
[1:09:46] your toes the whole time and rebukes and
[1:09:49] rebukes and rebukes and we meet in the
[1:09:51] line and they go, "That was
[1:09:55] awesome." Why do we look at it that way?
[1:09:58] Because we all
[1:10:00] like we all like to be told you're going
[1:10:03] to make it. You're an overcomer. You're
[1:10:05] the bride. You're gonna But none of us
[1:10:08] like to hear how to be molded into that.
[1:10:17] Not to make light of it, but but we all
[1:10:20] look at
[1:10:22] ourselves. Let me back up a minute. Let
[1:10:25] me talk about me. I look at myself and
[1:10:28] go, "Man, I would love to be 40 pounds
[1:10:31] lighter, but I don't want to talk about
[1:10:33] what it's going to take to get
[1:10:36] there." You understand? There there
[1:10:38] there's things that you have to give up.
[1:10:40] There's sacrifice. There's hardships.
[1:10:41] There's work. There's things you got to
[1:10:42] do. There's things you got to lay
[1:10:47] down. And yeah, God comes and says,
[1:10:49] "You're going to make it. You're an
[1:10:50] overcomer. You're called to this age.
[1:10:52] You're the bride of the age." But then
[1:10:54] he may come back the very next service
[1:10:55] and say, "It's time to quit this
[1:10:57] nonsense and quit playing games and quit
[1:10:59] skipping church and quit feeding on this
[1:11:01] and quit feeding on that and quit having
[1:11:03] a bad attitude." And and you're sitting
[1:11:05] there
[1:11:07] going, "I thought you wanted to be the
[1:11:09] bride. It excited you last
[1:11:15] service. Why does he do that? Do you
[1:11:18] really think as men of God, we want to
[1:11:20] get up here and do that? I much prefer
[1:11:23] people to be going,
[1:11:26] "Yay!" But God moves in ways sometimes
[1:11:29] and puts things on your heart and says,
[1:11:30] "As many as I
[1:11:32] love, I rebuke and chasen. I mold them
[1:11:38] into the image so that they can be
[1:11:40] exactly what I already know they're
[1:11:42] going to be. But I'm going to put them
[1:11:44] through this process so they come out as
[1:11:47] pure gold. Amen. He says to his own, "As
[1:11:50] many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. To
[1:11:53] rebuke is to reprove." In other words,
[1:11:56] he's just looking to in to improve who
[1:11:59] you are. Says, "Be zealous and repent."
[1:12:03] This was very interesting. And I know we
[1:12:05] have a skit, so maybe I'll I'll begin to
[1:12:07] wind this
[1:12:09] up. Says, "Be zealous and repent." And
[1:12:11] then Brother Brown makes this
[1:12:14] statement. See if I can find it here.
[1:12:16] Here it
[1:12:17] is. He says, "But God is calling for
[1:12:20] another zeal." He says, "There's plenty
[1:12:22] of people zealous about church." Plenty
[1:12:24] of people in the denomin denominations
[1:12:27] are zealous. Plenty of people, they're
[1:12:28] zealous. He said, "But they're zealous
[1:12:29] for the wrong
[1:12:30] thing." He says, "God is calling for
[1:12:33] another zeal. It is the zeal to cry, "I
[1:12:37] am
[1:12:41] wrong." Boy, we all love saying that,
[1:12:44] don't
[1:12:47] we? I'm
[1:12:50] wrong. Don't get to the place, and we're
[1:12:54] just going to sit here for a second.
[1:12:56] Don't get to the place where saying,
[1:12:57] "I'm wrong" is a hard thing.
[1:13:00] Don't get to the place where I'm sorry
[1:13:02] is a hard thing because it'll affect way
[1:13:05] it'll affect your whole life. It'll
[1:13:07] affect your relationship with friends.
[1:13:09] It'll affect your marriage. It'll affect
[1:13:10] your relationship with your children.
[1:13:11] It'll affect your
[1:13:13] job.
[1:13:15] Self-reflect. Be willing to say, "I'm
[1:13:18] wrong." Be willing to look at a
[1:13:19] situation. Oh, here's the one people
[1:13:21] love. This is a little bit of me. Okay?
[1:13:24] So, if you don't like it, throw it away.
[1:13:25] That's fine. Be willing to find your
[1:13:28] wrong in every single
[1:13:32] situation, even when you're
[1:13:36] right. My kids can testify to this and
[1:13:39] my kids hate
[1:13:41] this. But the very first thing we're
[1:13:43] going to talk about in any situation is
[1:13:45] what' you do wrong. You come in my house
[1:13:48] and you just got punched in the nose and
[1:13:49] you're bleeding and you're screaming.
[1:13:50] They hit me. I'm go, "What'd you do?"
[1:13:53] Every time.
[1:13:55] every time. My daughter tells me all the
[1:13:58] time, "You've never once took my side on
[1:14:00] anything." And I say, "And I don't plan
[1:14:05] to." You're going to find you're wrong
[1:14:08] in the situation. Then we'll deal with
[1:14:09] the rest of it.
[1:14:12] I don't care how disrespected you've
[1:14:14] been. I don't care how ugly someone has
[1:14:16] been to you. I don't care how mistreated
[1:14:18] you've been. Find the part in the
[1:14:20] situation you could have handled better
[1:14:24] every
[1:14:25] time. I'm just talking from me. I've
[1:14:27] told you you can throw this away. If
[1:14:30] I've ever had a run in with my kids and
[1:14:32] it turned into an issue, the first thing
[1:14:33] I'm going to do is I'm going to examine
[1:14:35] it. I'm going to find places I could
[1:14:36] have handled it better and I'm going to
[1:14:38] go apologize to them before I expect
[1:14:40] them to apologize to me because I'm the
[1:14:42] adult. I set the example. I love that.
[1:14:44] You know, the adults are they owe me an
[1:14:46] apology. Have you taught them how?
[1:14:52] I apologize to my kids all the time.
[1:14:55] Even if it's not necessary, I find
[1:14:58] anything that I feel like I could have
[1:15:00] done better and I say, "Look, I'm sorry
[1:15:02] about I could have handled that. My tone
[1:15:04] could even if it's tone, I understand my
[1:15:06] tone was a little off right there." Why
[1:15:08] do you say that? Because you always want
[1:15:10] to be willing and
[1:15:13] able because I promise you, you'll never
[1:15:17] improve if it's always everybody else's
[1:15:21] fault. You'll never get better if it's
[1:15:23] always everybody else's
[1:15:26] fault. You'll never grow in God if you
[1:15:28] can't see your need. So why why why am I
[1:15:32] focusing that way? Because there's a lot
[1:15:33] of people who are really really really
[1:15:34] really great Christians probably so far
[1:15:36] beyond me.
[1:15:38] How do they continue to
[1:15:40] grow? By being willing to find where
[1:15:43] they could do things
[1:15:45] better. Don't ever get to the place you
[1:15:48] can't say, "I'm sorry." Do you know how
[1:15:50] many situations you can diffuse? Even if
[1:15:54] you're not really the one that needs to
[1:15:55] apologize, if you will start it, it even
[1:15:59] if it's really vague and it's not, hey,
[1:16:01] I'm sorry that all that just
[1:16:03] happened. That's pretty vague. I mean,
[1:16:05] it may be 100% wrong. the other person's
[1:16:07] fault that it happened. But you start
[1:16:10] with the attitude, I'm sorry that
[1:16:12] happened. You know, I'm sorry for any
[1:16:14] any role I played in that. Well, let's
[1:16:17] look at that. Let's apply that
[1:16:19] spiritually in our
[1:16:21] life. Not examine ourselves to beat
[1:16:23] ourselves down. I want to go back. We
[1:16:24] got faith in the seal. We're settled.
[1:16:27] We're at peace. But we want to grow. We
[1:16:30] want to progress. And you cannot grow
[1:16:31] and progress if you're not willing to
[1:16:34] self-reflect and and look at yourself in
[1:16:37] the mirror and not look in the mirror
[1:16:38] and go, "Man, I'm doing pretty
[1:16:41] good." As we jokingly say to one
[1:16:44] another, those of us who aren't exactly
[1:16:46] in the best of shape, we'll often say,
[1:16:48] "Hey man, you're looking great. Keep
[1:16:49] doing what you're
[1:16:51] doing." We're really
[1:16:54] not. But too many Christians look in the
[1:16:56] mirror and go, "I'm doing great. I'mma
[1:16:59] keep doing what I'm
[1:17:03] doing. Self-reflect. Be willing to
[1:17:05] humble yourself. God is calling for a
[1:17:08] zeal to cry, "I am wrong." It's very
[1:17:14] interesting when I read that. And as you
[1:17:16] can tell, it really struck me and it
[1:17:18] made me sit there and really think about
[1:17:20] it and ponder
[1:17:23] it. Christ outside the church.
[1:17:27] I'm going try to wrap this up. Behold, I
[1:17:28] stand at the door and knock. If any man
[1:17:30] hear my voice and open the door, I will
[1:17:33] come into him and will suck with him and
[1:17:36] he with
[1:17:40] me. Brother Brandham makes this very
[1:17:43] clear. He says, "A lot of people take
[1:17:46] this and make it an individual thing."
[1:17:49] He goes, "But this is a message to the
[1:17:51] church."
[1:17:52] He he said a lot of evangelists will
[1:17:54] take this and say this is Christ
[1:17:55] standing at your heart's door. He's
[1:17:56] saying but no this is quite obviously
[1:17:59] showing that this is Christ outside of
[1:18:00] his own church. And if you'll remember
[1:18:02] in our study, we go all the way back to
[1:18:04] the Ephesian age, the very first age,
[1:18:06] and you had the the deeds of the
[1:18:08] nickelans. And it became nickelanism.
[1:18:11] And it was just and it just began to
[1:18:12] worm its way into the church. And age
[1:18:15] after age, they drifted a little more,
[1:18:16] and they drifted a little more, and they
[1:18:18] drifted a little more to we end up in
[1:18:19] this age where we're at right now. And
[1:18:22] Jesus is on the outside of his own
[1:18:24] church, and he's
[1:18:27] knocking and he's calling and he's
[1:18:30] drawing. He says, "If any
[1:18:32] man," but he's been put out. The church
[1:18:35] he died for, the people he died for, the
[1:18:37] he's been put out to where he's not
[1:18:40] welcome there anymore. His word isn't
[1:18:41] welcome there. His miracles aren't
[1:18:43] welcome there. His presence isn't
[1:18:44] welcome there. Oh, I pray that never be
[1:18:47] said about evening like
[1:18:49] tabernacle. May Jesus always be welcome
[1:18:51] in this place. May we always be willing
[1:18:54] to move in his presence and to hear his
[1:18:55] word and do what his word says and be
[1:18:58] willing to say, "I'm wrong." Be willing
[1:19:00] to be called. Be willing to be drawn. Be
[1:19:02] willing to be chasened. Be willing to be
[1:19:04] rebuked. Be willing to welcome him in
[1:19:06] his word. No matter how it comes forth,
[1:19:09] no matter what part. You can't just love
[1:19:11] parts of the word and not all of the
[1:19:12] word. Before the Passover, they had to
[1:19:14] roast the lamb. They had to eat the
[1:19:16] lamb. They had to eat all of it.
[1:19:19] The word comes forth and some parts make
[1:19:21] your belly
[1:19:22] bitter. But may it be welcome here just
[1:19:24] as well. May we welcome all the word and
[1:19:28] allow it to change our lives. Brother
[1:19:31] Brown says, "Oh elect of God, beware.
[1:19:33] Study closely. Be careful. Work out your
[1:19:35] salvation with fear and trembling. Rely
[1:19:37] upon God and be strong in his might.
[1:19:40] Your adversary, the devil, is even now
[1:19:42] going about like a roaring lion, seeking
[1:19:44] whom he may devour. Watch unto prayer
[1:19:47] and be steadfast. This is the end time.
[1:19:51] Both the true and the false vine are
[1:19:53] coming into maturity." He says, "But
[1:19:56] before the wheat matures, those ripened
[1:19:58] tears must be bound for the burning.
[1:20:01] This is the end
[1:20:05] time." He says, "This whole message has
[1:20:08] a summation as does every message in
[1:20:10] every age." In verse 22, it says, "He
[1:20:13] that hath an ear, let him hear what the
[1:20:14] spirit saith unto the churches." So this
[1:20:16] is the message to the church of the last
[1:20:18] age. This is the condition of the
[1:20:20] Leodysian church as it end as its end
[1:20:23] nears. It is not a personal message to
[1:20:25] one person. It is a spirit telling us
[1:20:28] where Jesus is. Christ has left the
[1:20:35] church. I just read that to
[1:20:38] you. Revelations 3:21. To him that
[1:20:41] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[1:20:42] in my throne, even as I also overcame
[1:20:45] and am sat down with my father in his
[1:20:47] throne. Now, before we move on to
[1:20:49] Matthew, what he's talking about, the
[1:20:50] overcomer. I'm so thankful that there's
[1:20:52] an overcomer talked about to him that
[1:20:55] overcome it. That right there settles
[1:20:57] the issue. Somebody's going to overcome.
[1:20:59] Somebody's going to make it. And I
[1:21:01] believe we ought to have the attitude
[1:21:03] tonight. If it ain't nobody else going,
[1:21:05] I'm going. You got to make it that sure.
[1:21:07] It ain't that I'm against y'all. I'm
[1:21:09] just making my calling and my election
[1:21:11] sure. So I know that I know that I know.
[1:21:13] I can't speak for you, but I'm going to
[1:21:15] be him that overcomemeth. And that needs
[1:21:18] to be each and one of our attitudes
[1:21:20] where we settle the issue. And brother
[1:21:22] Brown says it doesn't matter what you're
[1:21:24] supposed to overcome. He says that's not
[1:21:26] the thought of this verse. It's not so
[1:21:28] much what he says but how are we
[1:21:32] overcoming?
[1:21:33] How? He says how did Eve
[1:21:36] fall? Eve fell because she's got away
[1:21:39] from the word. He says she took another
[1:21:41] idea. She took another thought. She
[1:21:43] began to look at what the world thought
[1:21:45] was normal instead of coming back to the
[1:21:48] word. He says, "But if that's how Eve
[1:21:50] fell, how did Jesus overcome?" He
[1:21:53] overcame by the word. It tells us about
[1:21:55] in Matthew and he says, "It is written,
[1:21:57] man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:21:59] by every word that proceedth out of the
[1:22:02] mouth of God." And I'm telling you,
[1:22:03] young people tonight, cast down your
[1:22:05] ideas. Cast down your thinking. Cast
[1:22:08] down the influences that have made you
[1:22:10] think the word is old-fashioned and out
[1:22:12] ofd and and no longer matters anymore.
[1:22:14] If you're going to overcome this age,
[1:22:16] you're going to overcome it by sticking
[1:22:18] to the word. And the word says you must
[1:22:20] be born again. If you're going to
[1:22:22] overcome, you're going to overcome by
[1:22:23] the new birth and by feeding on the word
[1:22:26] and growing in the word and progressing
[1:22:28] in the word. That's how we're going to
[1:22:31] make it. That's how we're going to
[1:22:33] overcome. That's why the word was
[1:22:35] restored. And with the restored word
[1:22:37] came a restored power. And you have that
[1:22:39] power living on the inside of you
[1:22:41] tonight. And allows you to be the
[1:22:44] overcomer that will sit on the throne
[1:22:47] with Jesus Christ.
[1:22:49] Amen. Amen. He says, "Now then there
[1:22:53] will not be one person who will sit in
[1:22:55] the throne of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:56] unless he has been living that word.
[1:22:59] your prayers, your fasting, your
[1:23:01] repentances, no matter what you present
[1:23:03] to God, none of that will gain you the
[1:23:06] privilege of sitting in that throne, it
[1:23:08] will be granted only to the word
[1:23:13] bride. Then finally, we come to the
[1:23:16] consummation of the
[1:23:20] ages. This quote just struck me as so
[1:23:23] final when I read it. There's just a
[1:23:25] finality to it. He says, "This age is
[1:23:28] the last of the seven church ages. What
[1:23:32] began in the first or the Ephesian age
[1:23:34] must and will come to full fruition and
[1:23:37] harvest in the last or leodysian age.
[1:23:40] The two vines will yield their final
[1:23:42] fruit. The two spirits will terminate
[1:23:44] their manifestation in each of their
[1:23:46] final destinations. The sewing, the
[1:23:50] watering, the growing is all over.
[1:23:53] Summer is ended. The sickle is now
[1:23:57] thrust into the
[1:24:01] harvest. He says in this, the mystery of
[1:24:05] the tears and of the
[1:24:07] wheats, he said, is is is revealed. And
[1:24:12] I'm not going to go through all this,
[1:24:13] but you know that the parable while the
[1:24:15] man slept, his enemy came and swed
[1:24:17] tears. And he says, "When the blade
[1:24:19] sprung up and it brought forth fruit,
[1:24:21] and the servants came and said unto him,
[1:24:24] did thou not sow good seed?" And he said
[1:24:26] unto them, "An enemy had done this." And
[1:24:28] he says, "Shall we go gather them up?"
[1:24:30] He says, "Nay, lest while you gather up
[1:24:32] the tears, you root up the wheat also."
[1:24:35] So he lets it grow together. Two
[1:24:37] vines, two
[1:24:39] seeds all the way down through the ages.
[1:24:43] true vine, false vine, true church,
[1:24:46] false church. But at the end of the
[1:24:50] age, at the end of the age, he says,
[1:24:52] "The wheat and the tears which came from
[1:24:54] the first age until now have grown side
[1:24:56] by side or harvested. No longer will the
[1:24:59] wheat and the tears grow side by side.
[1:25:02] No longer will the tears receive the
[1:25:04] blessing of God just because of the
[1:25:06] presence of the wheat. For the wheat
[1:25:08] will be gone and the wrath of God will
[1:25:11] be poured out upon the
[1:25:14] tears. He says, "Harvest time." Yes,
[1:25:16] harvest time. The two vines that grew
[1:25:19] together and intertwined their branches
[1:25:21] will now be separated. The fruits of
[1:25:24] those vines which were at such variants
[1:25:26] will be gathered into separate garners.
[1:25:28] The two spirits will go their separate
[1:25:29] destinations. Now it is time to heed the
[1:25:32] final call that comes only to the wheat
[1:25:34] bride. Come out of her, my people, that
[1:25:37] ye be not partakers of her sins, and
[1:25:39] that ye, the wheat, receive not her the
[1:25:43] tears
[1:25:45] plagues. Think about
[1:25:48] it. The tears have reached full
[1:25:52] maturity, but that's not the whole
[1:25:53] picture I want to focus on tonight. If
[1:25:56] the tears have reached full maturity,
[1:25:58] then so has the wheat.
[1:26:01] There is a wheat bride. There is a full
[1:26:03] word bride standing on the earth today.
[1:26:05] And brother Brandham says, "If this is
[1:26:07] true, then it's also true that the bride
[1:26:09] church will mature and her ripeness
[1:26:11] shall be in identification with her Lord
[1:26:13] by means of the word and her head who
[1:26:15] will come to her is the mystery of
[1:26:17] godliness which is Christ." He says,
[1:26:19] "And as the false church with all
[1:26:21] cunning and diabolical power made up of
[1:26:23] political force and physical force and
[1:26:25] demons of darkness has come against this
[1:26:27] true vine, the true vine with the
[1:26:30] fullness of the spirit and the word will
[1:26:32] do the very acts of power that Jesus
[1:26:34] did." Then as she nears her headstone,
[1:26:37] becoming like him through the word,
[1:26:39] Jesus will come that the bride and the
[1:26:42] groom may be forever united as one.
[1:26:46] church, we're at that place where Jesus
[1:26:48] Christ is to be manifested out of our
[1:26:50] lives. And I realize that that it's not
[1:26:53] just going to be me doing all the works
[1:26:54] of Christ. And it's not just going to be
[1:26:56] you doing all the works of Christ, but
[1:26:58] it's it's this seed gene. It's this
[1:26:59] attribute. And it's this one here in
[1:27:01] Louisiana and some in Texas and some in
[1:27:04] in Virginia and some in Tennessee, some
[1:27:06] all over the world, but each one doing
[1:27:09] their little part. And as the tears are
[1:27:11] coming up a and they're a manifestation
[1:27:13] of who their father is, there's another
[1:27:15] group on earth today who is a
[1:27:17] manifestation of all that Jesus Christ
[1:27:19] is. And they're manifesting his love and
[1:27:22] his forgiveness and his overcoming power
[1:27:24] and his healing and his deliverance.
[1:27:26] Why? Because she is him. Think about
[1:27:30] that tonight. If she is him and you are
[1:27:33] she, what does that say about who you
[1:27:35] are? You are made of deity. You are made
[1:27:38] of the same material as Jesus Christ
[1:27:40] was. And just as he perfectly manifested
[1:27:42] the father, this broad body will
[1:27:45] perfectly manifest the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:47] in this day upon the earth. Why don't
[1:27:50] you put that in Satan's face tonight? He
[1:27:52] says, "You're not going to make it.
[1:27:53] You're not going to overcome. You can't
[1:27:55] not make it. You are made of deity. You
[1:27:58] are made of the same material as Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ is made of." That's who you are.
[1:28:03] You can't miss the rapture. You are the
[1:28:06] rapture. And it's rapture time. It's
[1:28:10] harvest time. That's where we're
[1:28:13] standing. The last
[1:28:16] warning. He that hath an ear, let him
[1:28:19] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:28:23] churches. Will you bow your heads with
[1:28:26] me this
[1:28:28] evening? Prophet of God says, "This is
[1:28:31] the last
[1:28:32] warning." Just listen. This is the last
[1:28:36] warning. There will not be another. The
[1:28:40] throne room has been set up. Oh,
[1:28:42] hallelujah. The 12 foundations have been
[1:28:45] laid. The streets of gold have been
[1:28:47] paved. The gates of gigantic pearls are
[1:28:50] raised and hinged like a pyramid. She
[1:28:53] stands so fair and glorious. The
[1:28:55] heavenly beings who have prepared her
[1:28:57] watch breathlessly. For she glistens and
[1:28:59] shines with a glory that is unearly.
[1:29:02] Every facet of her beauty tells a story
[1:29:04] of amazing grace and Jesus love. She is
[1:29:07] a city prepared for a prepared people.
[1:29:10] She awaits only for her inhabitants. And
[1:29:13] soon they will throng her streets with
[1:29:15] joy. Yes, it is the last call. The
[1:29:20] spirit will not speak in another age.
[1:29:23] The ages are
[1:29:26] over. We've reached the end of the ages.
[1:29:29] And I don't just mean in a church age
[1:29:33] study. You've reached the end of the
[1:29:39] ages. Time is not going to go on. It may
[1:29:42] go on a few more years. There there may
[1:29:44] be. We don't know that. But this is the
[1:29:46] final
[1:29:47] age. It's been vindicated. It's been
[1:29:50] shown. God has come down and proven it
[1:29:53] by his
[1:29:54] word. This is the final call.
[1:29:58] You're a part of the final call. As a
[1:30:00] matter of fact, you're supposed to be a
[1:30:02] part of the voice giving the final call,
[1:30:05] the final voice to the final
[1:30:08] age. Do you have gold that's been tried
[1:30:11] in the
[1:30:14] fire? Have you been seeking after the
[1:30:16] right kind of gold? He says, "Come to
[1:30:19] me. Turn away from all the stuff you've
[1:30:22] been seeking after. Turn away from all
[1:30:24] the things you've been pursuing. turn
[1:30:26] away from from all the things you've
[1:30:28] been feeding on that's been changing
[1:30:29] your ideas. He said, "Come to me tonight
[1:30:32] and buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:30:36] that you might have eternal
[1:30:39] life." I'll just say it like
[1:30:42] this. The time you spend on this earth
[1:30:44] will be the shortest amount of time that
[1:30:46] you live
[1:30:48] anywhere. Make
[1:30:50] sure. Just make sure. I love y'all so
[1:30:53] much. You're such a wonderful group of
[1:30:55] people. Such a wonderful group of young
[1:30:57] people. You make me proud. You make
[1:30:59] Evening Light Tabernacle
[1:31:02] proud. You are a shining light, lighting
[1:31:04] up this
[1:31:06] community. But I'm talking about you
[1:31:08] right now. Your heart as an individual
[1:31:11] is the Gold Tribe. Will it pass the
[1:31:14] test? Don't show up that day with fool's
[1:31:17] gold. Don't show up that day with a run
[1:31:19] and a shout. Don't show up with a dance
[1:31:21] or a youth camp experience.
[1:31:23] But show up with a character that has
[1:31:27] been molded by Jesus
[1:31:29] Christ. Show
[1:31:31] up. Show up like him because you've
[1:31:36] allowed him to rebuke. You've allowed
[1:31:37] him to chasen. And you didn't have
[1:31:39] Cain's attitude, but you said, "Be it
[1:31:41] unto me, Lord. Change me, Lord. Show me
[1:31:44] where I can be better." And with that
[1:31:46] attitude, he's the master craftsman. He
[1:31:50] will mold you. Listen, this ain't about
[1:31:52] being a conformist. This ain't about
[1:31:54] rules and regulations. I don't want to
[1:31:56] take away your individuality. We're all
[1:31:58] different, but he wants to mold you into
[1:32:00] his
[1:32:01] image, the best version of who he
[1:32:04] intended you to
[1:32:06] be. Let him do that
[1:32:08] tonight. You be willing to raise a hand
[1:32:11] to God and say, "God, I need more of
[1:32:12] you. I need that gold. I need to be
[1:32:14] trout. I need to be changed. I need to
[1:32:16] be molded. Help me." What we really all
[1:32:18] need tonight is an attitude adjustment
[1:32:20] that we're willing to be molded because
[1:32:23] we all want to be the final product. But
[1:32:25] Lord, let me be willing to go through
[1:32:27] what I got to go through to be that
[1:32:29] final product. Lord, help me. Father,
[1:32:31] you see every hand, every heart. Lord, I
[1:32:33] just want to thank you for the
[1:32:35] opportunity to speak to these people.
[1:32:37] Lord, what a privilege and an honor to
[1:32:39] stand before a purchase, a piece of that
[1:32:42] purchase of the blood of Calvary. Lord,
[1:32:44] I just pray tonight. Lord, you saw, you
[1:32:46] knew you were in it. Lord, I thank you
[1:32:49] that you came and spoke. That you came
[1:32:51] and anointed and you touched hearts and
[1:32:53] spoke to lives. Now, Lord, may we all
[1:32:55] take and apply what we've heard. May we
[1:32:57] allow the word to change us. Allow the
[1:32:59] word to mold us. Lord, I don't want to
[1:33:01] be found, Lord, without your character.
[1:33:03] I don't want to be found on that day
[1:33:05] standing with but Lord, I preached, but
[1:33:07] but Lord, I prayed for people, but but
[1:33:09] Lord, because Lord, I see in the word
[1:33:11] where there'll be those that say that
[1:33:12] and you say depart. Lord, I don't want
[1:33:14] to hear depart. I want to hear, "Well
[1:33:15] done, my good and faithful servant." And
[1:33:18] the only way is have a character that
[1:33:20] matches your character and a life that
[1:33:22] matches your life. And you've offered
[1:33:24] it, Lord. I just say, "Help us all to
[1:33:25] receive it. Help us all to walk in it,
[1:33:27] Lord. Change us. Forgive us of our
[1:33:30] failures. Forgive us of our
[1:33:31] shortcomings, Lord, and mold us, Father.
[1:33:34] Lord, we commit this time into your
[1:33:36] hands as we go from here and we we go to
[1:33:38] this skit, Lord. Help each one of these
[1:33:40] young people, Lord. Many of them put in
[1:33:42] so much time and so much effort. Lord,
[1:33:44] may you be involved and may you use it
[1:33:46] for your glory. May you use this whole
[1:33:48] night for your glory. Lord, we commit it
[1:33:50] to you now. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:33:54] Amen. God bless you.
[1:33:58] Me
[1:33:59] Lord with the fire of your
[1:34:05] spirit.
[1:34:08] Conserve me,
[1:34:11] Lord, and make me more
[1:34:14] light.
[1:34:17] Oh,
[1:34:19] break me,
[1:34:22] Lord, and bless the broken
[1:34:26] pieces of my
[1:34:30] love. Oh, can you just truly tell them,
[1:34:32] "I want to be used.
[1:34:37] Lord
[1:34:39] God. Oh, just lift your hand to him.
[1:34:41] Tell him that now. Say, "Consue
[1:34:46] me,
[1:34:48] Lord, with the fire of your
[1:34:54] spirit.
[1:34:56] Conserve me,
[1:34:59] Lord, and make me warm."
[1:35:04] Oh, if you have to
[1:35:07] break me,
[1:35:10] Lord. Oh, bless the broken
[1:35:14] pieces of my
[1:35:19] life. Oh, I want to be
[1:35:23] you,
[1:35:25] Lord. Oh, can we just all stand together
[1:35:28] now? Sing that to him.
[1:35:30] Consume
[1:35:33] me
[1:35:36] Lord with the fire of your
[1:35:41] spirit.
[1:35:43] Consume me
[1:35:47] Lord and make me more like you.
[1:35:54] Break me
[1:35:57] Lord and bless the broken
[1:36:03] pieces of my
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:08] life.
[1:36:10] Oh
[1:36:13] Lord my
[1:36:16] you and come quench this thirsting.
[1:36:21] Lord, I am
[1:36:25] ready. Here I am
[1:36:29] waiting. Come fill my
[1:36:33] heart. You are the
[1:36:37] only one who can fill
[1:36:42] me. Here I am.
[1:36:47] Way. Oh, just tell him that again.
[1:36:50] Say, "Come quench this
[1:36:53] thirst." Oh Lord, I am
[1:36:59] ready. Here I am
[1:37:03] waiting. Come fill my You're the only
[1:37:10] one, the one who can fill
[1:37:15] me. Oh, here I am.
[1:37:22] waiting.
[1:37:24] Oh, come quench this
[1:37:28] thirsting. Lord, I
[1:37:31] am I am
[1:37:35] ready. Oh, come fill my heart.
[1:37:41] And you are the
[1:37:45] only one who can fill
[1:37:49] me. Here I
[1:37:52] am. Oh come fill my
[1:37:59] heart. Come fill my
[1:38:02] life. I am in complete.
[1:38:08] Oh, let your
[1:38:10] love shine down on
[1:38:15] me. I need you
[1:38:18] more. Lord, I
[1:38:22] confess. I need more of you and nothing
[1:38:29] less. Come quench this thirsting.
[1:38:37] Oh, here I
[1:38:40] am. Oh, come fill my
[1:38:44] heart. And you are the
[1:38:48] only one who can fill
[1:38:52] me. Here I am
[1:38:56] way. Come fill my heart.
[1:39:01] You are the
[1:39:04] only one who can fill
[1:39:09] me. Here I
[1:39:12] am. Oh, come fill my
[1:39:18] heart.
[1:39:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you enjoy the
[1:39:23] word
[1:39:24] tonight? Amen. It's
[1:39:27] wonderful. Amen. And how many can say,
[1:39:29] "I'm going to rejoice no matter what the
[1:39:31] what the service says. If it lifts me
[1:39:33] up, if it comes right down my alleyway
[1:39:35] and says, "You need to change." I want
[1:39:37] to rejoice in the correction, I want to
[1:39:40] rejoice in the freedom. Amen. Whatever
[1:39:43] it would be. Amen. The song would say,
[1:39:47] "Let the
