[54:40] and forever father and we'll commit it
[54:42] to you in this service in Jesus name we
[54:45] pray amen amen God bless you I want to
[54:49] title this this evening what I titled it
[54:52] last night the eagle
[54:54] Christian but I want to at you amen from
[54:58] a a little different angle as we was
[55:02] talking about the eagle and what she was
[55:06] born or the eagle is born to do being a
[55:10] special equipped bird uh special
[55:14] equipped to fly to places that no other
[55:17] bird can fly to the prophet of God said
[55:21] if the church only knew how to set its
[55:24] wings of faith into the promise of God
[55:27] not beat from here or beat from there
[55:30] join the Methodist join the Baptist join
[55:32] the Presbyterian join the Oneness join
[55:35] the assembly join every little ISM that
[55:37] comes along that's not it it's to set
[55:40] your wings in his promise and let the
[55:44] Holy Ghost just Lift You Up Up and Up
[55:49] you know we can find a condition where
[55:52] you know as as Jesus taught us in
[55:55] Matthew 13 where the seed would fall
[55:58] into different conditions and and in
[56:00] these conditions because of what they
[56:03] were whether it was the Stony ground uh
[56:06] whether it just fell by the wayside and
[56:08] was caught away immediately uh fell on
[56:10] the Stony ground the Bible says and they
[56:13] received the word with joy but then When
[56:15] Trials came because of the word amen
[56:18] they left amen then it fell into other
[56:21] places where the cares of Life choked it
[56:24] up and and and did not allow to grow but
[56:27] then it said it also fell into good
[56:29] ground and brought forth some
[56:31] hundredfold some 60 and some 30 amen and
[56:34] he's talking about a condition of a life
[56:37] that it can fall and there's some that
[56:39] the word will come to they they've
[56:40] already made up their mind they're not
[56:42] going to receive it they want nothing to
[56:44] do with it they're in opposition of it
[56:46] like the religious systems when Jesus
[56:48] came they wanted nothing to do with what
[56:50] he offered because what he preached was
[56:52] against their system and but then he
[56:55] said there were other that they received
[56:57] the word and they had great joy in
[57:00] receiving it but they thought that was
[57:02] all that it was but when trials begin to
[57:05] come amen they turned around and they
[57:07] left and the Bible specifically said it
[57:10] was because they had no root in them
[57:14] there was no anchor there but what God
[57:16] does with his his young is he he makes
[57:19] sure that there is an anchor inside of
[57:22] you amen that though everything else is
[57:25] being pushed and and and and the winds
[57:27] are blowing and and everything is coming
[57:30] against you there is something in you
[57:32] that will never let
[57:36] go amen amen and so as a young as a
[57:41] young one it is hard to understand amen
[57:44] because the love of God Amen is is to
[57:47] give us these blessings and to give us
[57:49] wonderful things I I want to read I want
[57:53] to read to you h a couple quotes from
[57:56] the prophet to show you what the spirit

[59:56] raises up in the last day I'm glad that
[59:59] I am resting in his
[1:00:02] faithfulness amen again in the church
[1:00:05] age book he says Now by his Spirit he is
[1:00:08] creating many sons unto himself God the
[1:00:11] Creator creating himself a part of his
[1:00:15] creation this is the true revelation of
[1:00:17] God this is his purpose this purpose
[1:00:20] took form through election that is why
[1:00:23] he could look right down to the last day
[1:00:26] when all would be over and see himself
[1:00:29] still in the midst of the church as
[1:00:32] author of this creation this new
[1:00:35] creation of God his Sovereign power
[1:00:37] brought it to pass do you know amen
[1:00:39] because he is Sovereign he doesn't have
[1:00:41] to ask permission of anybody Grace does
[1:00:45] not have to ask permission of anybody
[1:00:47] whether it can move in a life amen he
[1:00:50] does what he wants to
[1:00:52] do amen no matter what the condition is
[1:00:55] his grace amen is purposed amen that he
[1:00:57] will have a bride he will bring to
[1:01:00] himself create many sons and daughters
[1:01:02] of God he has promised in this hour he
[1:01:05] would have daughters and sons adopted
[1:01:07] sons of God Amen that he would bring and
[1:01:11] manifest himself in this
[1:01:14] age praise the Lord amen he
[1:01:17] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:01:19] children according to the pleasure good
[1:01:21] pleasure of his will by his omniscience
[1:01:24] and his omnipotence he brought it to
[1:01:26] pass how else could he know he would be
[1:01:30] standing in the midst of the church
[1:01:33] receiving Glory from his Brethren if he
[1:01:36] did not make sure all things he knew and
[1:01:39] all things he worked out according to
[1:01:41] what he knew in order that his purpose
[1:01:43] and good pleasure be brought to pass you
[1:01:46] might tell me brother Danny what in the
[1:01:48] world does this have to do with eagles
[1:01:51] and an eagle Christian because I want
[1:01:53] you to know amen the one you're born
[1:01:57] from we're not talking about animal life
[1:02:00] or bird life we're talking about God
[1:02:03] right amen the omnipotent one the
[1:02:06] omniscient one the the one amen before
[1:02:09] there was ever an earth before there was
[1:02:11] ever a universe before there was ever an
[1:02:14] angel he already had thoughts in his
[1:02:16] mind he had thoughts about you and about
[1:02:19] how he would bring you and as we heard
[1:02:20] this morning what age that you would
[1:02:22] come in and and he would bring you there
[1:02:25] and he's delegated to you to bring the
[1:02:27] word to you amen so that you could
[1:02:29] recognize why you're here amen there's
[1:02:32] be some things you don't know why it's
[1:02:35] happening to you and he will not show
[1:02:36] you all of his purpose because he wants
[1:02:38] to demonstrate what faith looks like and
[1:02:41] and how it will operate if he told you
[1:02:44] everything you would have no faith but
[1:02:46] it's your faith that shows
[1:02:50] everything praise the name of the Lord
[1:02:52] so an eagle as we read the prophet said
[1:02:55] is he has to learn to set himself in the
[1:02:57] wind
[1:02:59] right amen the scripture amen that was
[1:03:02] read this morning and last night that
[1:03:04] they will Mount up with
[1:03:06] wings now if you study that you find out
[1:03:10] it is actually like a person getting on
[1:03:12] a
[1:03:13] horse how many's ever ridden a horse you
[1:03:16] just jumped on a horse and hoped it went
[1:03:20] somewhere you didn't try to control it
[1:03:22] you just said get it
[1:03:24] up and off you went and you hoped you
[1:03:28] would just wind up somewhere in a good
[1:03:30] place well that's not riding a
[1:03:33] horse amen amen and it's the same when
[1:03:36] it's talking about an eagle mounting up
[1:03:38] is he he takes The Rains of the wind and
[1:03:41] he he is going to use the wind to go to
[1:03:44] a certain place an already predetermined
[1:03:48] place that he's going to go to he's not
[1:03:50] just randomly floating in the currents
[1:03:52] amen a young one may as he's learning to
[1:03:55] fly but the mature Eagle is not randomly
[1:03:58] floating and letting it beating him
[1:03:59] around he has learned how to conquer and
[1:04:02] master amen flying into the heights
[1:04:05] storms can't stop him when other birds
[1:04:08] would run from a storm he will wait for
[1:04:11] the storm and then when the storm comes
[1:04:14] he will Mount up into it and he's going
[1:04:16] to do one thing he's going to rise above
[1:04:19] the cloud to where the sun is still
[1:04:23] shining I'm talking about an eag e that
[1:04:26] has learned how to
[1:04:28] [Applause]
[1:04:31] fly
[1:04:33] amen the Bible tells us that the eagle
[1:04:36] would put his nest in the Cliffs of the
[1:04:40] rock there reason he do this he's not a
[1:04:43] vulture he's not a
[1:04:45] chicken they put their nest on the
[1:04:47] ground they don't have the care for
[1:04:49] their young Like an Eagle does for
[1:04:52] theirs amen when you're on the ground
[1:04:54] you're susceptible to anything that can
[1:04:56] come in and get in there but but these
[1:04:58] eagles they
[1:04:59] plan carefully the birth of their young
[1:05:02] all
[1:05:03] right the birth of their young is not a
[1:05:07] random event but they've already planned
[1:05:10] it they build it and they plant
[1:05:15] it amen I want you to know God has
[1:05:19] predetermined already he was preparing
[1:05:22] for you before you even had a desire he
[1:05:25] was preparing for you then he put a
[1:05:28] desire in you then he be to draw you
[1:05:31] because he had already planned
[1:05:35] it he's planned you amen you may not
[1:05:39] feel
[1:05:40] planned and now may be talking to people
[1:05:42] who've come from all walks of life and I
[1:05:44] know I know some of your families and
[1:05:47] some of the things you've come out of
[1:05:49] and some of the things you've went
[1:05:50] through I know for some of you amen how
[1:05:53] the enemy has has destroyed your family
[1:05:55] family broke up and divorce or whatever
[1:05:57] more amen but I want you to know amen
[1:06:00] that may be Earthly fathers and mothers
[1:06:02] that's not the heavenly
[1:06:04] [Applause]
[1:06:06] father amen he he will make his nest
[1:06:10] high in the Cliff of the rock high above
[1:06:12] everything they do this because they
[1:06:15] they want to keep the nest from
[1:06:17] predators right the eagle has has one
[1:06:21] natural enemy and that's the serpent all
[1:06:25] right you you say well what about a crow
[1:06:27] or what about a hwk them aren't natural
[1:06:29] enemies they just Peck at
[1:06:30] them amen you ever seen an eagle flying
[1:06:33] around there's a little bird going after
[1:06:35] it how many's ever seen that amen how
[1:06:38] many's been
[1:06:40] outside amen they just be you know you
[1:06:42] see you see these eagles flying around
[1:06:44] there's a sparrow not a sparrow there's
[1:06:46] a crow it's usually a crow or black bird
[1:06:48] behind it you know and there they're
[1:06:49] chattering and they're diving at it and
[1:06:51] they're
[1:06:54] D you know only reason that that it's
[1:06:57] doing that is because that Eagle's at
[1:06:58] the same
[1:07:03] altitude amen now I want to W I want you
[1:07:06] to watch and I want you I want you to to
[1:07:08] watch these descriptions is what Moses
[1:07:10] is writing down because Moses is an
[1:07:12] eagle
[1:07:13] right and he knows what it's like he's
[1:07:16] been trained and he's writing and he and
[1:07:19] he said that as the eagle stirreth up
[1:07:23] her nest and FL utth over her young
[1:07:27] right amen so this
[1:07:31] Nest amen as I said was pretty
[1:07:33] determined for the young to be raised
[1:07:36] in and if youve if you've read about
[1:07:38] them or studied about them you can find
[1:07:40] out these nests can weigh up to two two
[1:07:42] tons can be up to 8 foot high amen and
[1:07:45] they build them way up in a place amen
[1:07:48] cuz they're going to raise their young
[1:07:49] there oh and I love the statement of of
[1:07:51] these golden eagles that they would they
[1:07:53] would lay their eggs in the winter
[1:07:56] time and then the mother would stay on
[1:07:58] the eggs while the father had to
[1:08:00] constantly work and feed amen and amen
[1:08:04] they didn't lay their eggs at the best
[1:08:06] of the
[1:08:07] Season amen but they laid them amen as a
[1:08:10] promise that spring is
[1:08:13] coming there's going to be a spring
[1:08:15] there's going to be a
[1:08:17] birth we're not going to run from the
[1:08:19] from the
[1:08:21] weather amen but we're going to bring
[1:08:23] forth and I want to tell you something
[1:08:25] else about eagles and I'm talking about
[1:08:26] you Eagles are are picky
[1:08:33] eaters Bible talks about
[1:08:36] it Bible says that said where the
[1:08:39] carcass is on there will the Eagles be
[1:08:42] gathered together the word Eagle means a
[1:08:44] ripper with
[1:08:47] beak mean they ripping amen the fresh
[1:08:52] kill amen the uh job wrote down he he
[1:08:55] said the eagle dwells on high and he and
[1:08:57] he looks he he sits on his on high in
[1:09:00] the Rock and he watches for his prey and
[1:09:02] the young suck the
[1:09:04] blood they're not looking for some
[1:09:07] garbage on the
[1:09:09] road come on church amen you know why
[1:09:13] because their diet is their source of
[1:09:16] [Applause]
[1:09:20] strength well I'm going to preach that a
[1:09:22] little
[1:09:23] bit amen you you show up from Camp to
[1:09:26] camp and you're weaker than the last
[1:09:27] Camp amen it's not because the camp
[1:09:32] failed amen but Eagles are picky eaters
[1:09:35] and they're not random

[1:12:00] just flipping randomly through the word
[1:12:03] and hoping something pops out he knows
[1:12:05] what he needs and he goes and finds it
[1:12:08] in the word and he begins to feed upon
[1:12:10] it because he knows his diet is his
[1:12:13] source of
[1:12:18] strength that's
[1:12:20] right amen young people you should not

[1:12:31] diet in fact you should start asking him
[1:12:33] creating me a care for the message you

[1:12:54] overcome
[1:12:56] oh we make our situation so much worse
[1:12:58] than other ages amen but it's not
[1:13:02] important what you have to overcome it's

[1:13:34] nest they build it in mine for their
[1:13:38] young man and they build this strong
[1:13:41] place for the eggs to come and to hatch
[1:13:46] in and then they begin to line the nest
[1:13:50] with
[1:13:51] Fur and
[1:13:53] Feathers in fact the female will take
[1:13:57] her own
[1:13:59] fur out of her breast and she lying the
[1:14:01] nest with it for when they're born she
[1:14:03] wants them to be surrounded with
[1:14:06] herself feel like they're cared
[1:14:09] for they put skins in there and and and
[1:14:13] this is funny but I was reading where
[1:14:14] the male is so excited about the young
[1:14:16] that are come and they here actually go
[1:14:19] and bring objects and put them in there
[1:14:21] cuz he's going to he wants to keep their
[1:14:23] attention they said they've actually
[1:14:25] found

[1:14:29] and by them you understand but amen they
[1:14:31] said they found balls they found a golf
[1:14:34] ball in the nest they found they didn't
[1:14:36] play golf but there's something about
[1:14:37] that object they thought oh maybe this
[1:14:39] will keep the attention of these young
[1:14:41] and and because they want the young to
[1:14:43] be attracted Amen to love the nest to
[1:14:46] love the comfort of the nest and when
[1:14:48] they're born they're just laying there

[1:17:01] to pull out those soft
[1:17:04] things amen as I was studying the book
[1:17:06] on these eagles they said the mother one
[1:17:08] day comes back with a strange look in
[1:17:10] her
[1:17:12] eyes she's not this friendly hovering

[1:17:18] time if you look at that word flutter he
[1:17:21] flutters over
[1:17:22] them I want you to go back study what
[1:17:25] that means it takes it all the way back
[1:17:28] to the Book of Genesis in the beginning
[1:17:30] when God Amen would would
[1:17:33] create and it was said it was a spirit
[1:17:35] of God hovering over them at the
[1:17:37] beginning of his creative
[1:17:41] acts he was hovering over them and even
[1:17:44] though there was a shaking going on
[1:17:46] which brought fear and anxiety it was
[1:17:48] the beginning of something
[1:17:51] creative is this something amen that
[1:17:54] these two things can Collide where fear
[1:17:57] and anxiety can collide with creative
[1:18:02] power cuz one day Mama comes home and
[1:18:06] she looks
[1:18:08] weird she doesn't look happy with her
[1:18:11] little chicks that have been just so
[1:18:14] satisfied with the nest and to always be
[1:18:18] fed thems cuz they've got to learn how
[1:18:21] to

[1:18:49] to grow looks like
[1:18:52] freckles he's weird
[1:18:56] and that's why amen as it begins to get
[1:18:58] older the mother would just start
[1:19:00] blasting
[1:19:01] them because he knowses are beginning to
[1:19:04] develop that little stuff that's just
[1:19:06] hanging on them amen it cannot be used
[1:19:09] in
[1:19:12] flying so he's going to blast them with
[1:19:14] their wings to blast off the little
[1:19:17] things that they don't need in
[1:19:22] Flight you know this little this little
[1:19:24] Eagles laying there in that comfortable
[1:19:27] nest and he's got these useless claws

[1:27:58] everything's against me but God had said
[1:28:01] you can't make him curse
[1:28:06] me you know why you can't curse
[1:28:09] me cuz you're from
[1:28:13] me and you may not feel like
[1:28:17] it but I'm going to prove to the
[1:28:20] devil that you're the answer to his
[1:28:23] question
[1:28:24] on that what you have inside of you will
[1:28:28] stand the test of the
[1:28:30] [Applause]
[1:28:33] age now job did not lose everything in
[1:28:36] increments over the course of months and
[1:28:38] years he lost everything in one
[1:28:45] day you talk about
[1:28:48] crushing loses family in one day there's
[1:28:52] the news news comes in and and his
[1:28:54] businesses have been destroyed or
[1:28:57] robbed so he's lost his
[1:29:00] wealth one
[1:29:06] day and that's
[1:29:09] bad you know what the Bible said job
[1:29:13] did things have been stripped from
[1:29:17] him you know what job
[1:29:19] did he got down on his
[1:29:23] knees
[1:29:25] I'm going to show you how to worship
[1:29:28] when every cushion is
[1:29:33] gone and he raised his
[1:29:36] hands and the Bible said he worshiped
[1:29:40] God you know if we're in a nesting
[1:29:43] syndrome and bad things begin to happen
[1:29:46] let's be honest times we look for
[1:29:48] somebody to complain
[1:29:50] to cuz somehow we think the love of God
[1:29:53] is associated only with his good
[1:29:57] things but the Bible just says that not
[1:30:00] that you just would know him in the
[1:30:01] power of his resurrection many times we
[1:30:02] stop there but it says also in the
[1:30:04] fellowship of his suffering do you know
[1:30:08] for this message to come through to you
[1:30:10] it came in great suffering and sacrifice
[1:30:13] it was not an easy thing for this
[1:30:15] message to come to this point it was not
[1:30:18] an easy thing for our Lord to go to the
[1:30:22] cross come on it was not an easy thing
[1:30:26] it was not an easy thing for every
[1:30:28] Messenger to come in their age and to
[1:30:30] bring a message it was great sacrifice
[1:30:33] great personal sacrifice people left him
[1:30:36] people hated
[1:30:37] them and they lost and suffered many
[1:30:40] things and then we're turn around in
[1:30:43] this digital age and we're believe some
[1:30:45] Google Prophet over who's never
[1:30:47] sacrificed anything they don't even go
[1:30:49] to
[1:30:52] church
[1:30:55] oh you might as well help
[1:30:57] me amen amen they don't know how to fly
[1:31:01] they don't know how to soar into the
[1:31:03] heavenlies but yet they want to tell you
[1:31:05] this is a false prophet you shouldn't
[1:31:07] believe what he's
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:11] saying amen but if you sacrifice for
[1:31:14] something it's worth fighting
[1:31:17] for I want you to know this message I'm
[1:31:20] not ashamed amen of this message that
[1:31:22] our Prophet has SP and spoken because it
[1:31:25] was not the message of a man it was the
[1:31:27] message that God sent through a man
[1:31:30] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:31:33] amen and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:31:37] children amen I want you to know Satan
[1:31:40] will not be able to stop the Turning of
[1:31:42] the hearts of a predestinated seed he'll
[1:31:45] do everything in his power he'll bring
[1:31:48] storm after storm amen but she will
[1:31:52] turn you know why God said he would turn
[1:31:56] [Applause]
[1:32:04] it I'm living proof of Hearts being
[1:32:08] turned there's a question in the
[1:32:10] answerers 1964 brother bams asked a
[1:32:12] question by my grandmother I have two
[1:32:14] daughters married to men in
[1:32:15] denominations received great received
[1:32:17] opposition what should they do he said
[1:32:19] hold fast Show Your
[1:32:21] Colors I don't say don't go around
[1:32:24] and fellowship but you know a dove can't
[1:32:26] eat with a buzzard there's that diet
[1:32:29] again amen I want you to know amen that
[1:32:32] that little word of advice from a
[1:32:34] prophet Eagle Show Your Colors don't be
[1:32:38] ashamed of what's being preached in this
[1:32:41] hour do you know why because when you
[1:32:44] make your
[1:32:45] stand God will make his stand he's just
[1:32:49] waiting for you to show that you believe
[1:32:52] what he has said in his
[1:33:01] word God took a man's heart who hated
[1:33:04] this message said he didn't want to be
[1:33:06] there in heaven if brother Brandon was
[1:33:07] there said we're in a cult said told me
[1:33:09] don't believe what your mama believes
[1:33:11] and he took a heart and he turned it
[1:33:14] until that man would give his life for
[1:33:16] this gospel I want you to know it pays
[1:33:19] to stay with the word I am a beneficiary
[1:33:23] of standing upon the
[1:33:28] word it came with
[1:33:31] sacrifice it came with threats to leave
[1:33:33] the
[1:33:35] family but I want you to know if it's
[1:33:37] worth standing for then stay with it no
[1:33:42] matter how you feel stay with the word
[1:33:45] amen because if there's an anchor there
[1:33:47] it will show up in the time of
[1:33:52] trouble
[1:33:54] before we get back to job I mean there's
[1:33:57] something else what an eagle will do
[1:34:00] when he gets sick and usually he gets
[1:34:03] sick because he eats something poisonous
[1:34:05] something he didn't recognize something
[1:34:06] he shouldn't ate he gets a hold of it
[1:34:08] becomes sick but he'll do
[1:34:11] something and what he'll do is he'll go
[1:34:14] find a place that's inaccessible to
[1:34:16] anybody
[1:34:18] else and he spread himself upon a rock
[1:34:22] and lay in the presence of the son and
[1:34:24] fix his eyes upon it until Health
[1:34:27] returns back to his body this is what
[1:34:30] Eagles
[1:34:31] do Amen brother Ron you've laid yourself
[1:34:34] upon that rock and you spread out your
[1:34:37] wings and you look and you fix your eyes
[1:34:39] upon the sun and the son says he was
[1:34:41] wounded for your
[1:34:43] transgressions and mean just keep your
[1:34:45] eyes fixed on that because that word is
[1:34:48] designed by his stripes you are healed
[1:34:51] the son has designed it
[1:34:55] amen yes sir you know brother man tells
[1:34:57] a story about amen a little mechanic
[1:35:00] down in
[1:35:00] Florida amen who who was trying to fix a
[1:35:03] problem in a car and he was tinkering
[1:35:05] around he tried to do this and tried to
[1:35:07] do that and tried to fix it and it
[1:35:09] wouldn't run he couldn't get it fixed he
[1:35:11] said there was a well-dressed man
[1:35:13] standing back there watching him and he
[1:35:14] told that little mechanic said he said
[1:35:16] if you would just do this this and this
[1:35:19] he said I believe it'll run so this
[1:35:21] mechanic went and he done exactly what
[1:35:23] that well-dressed man said he done this
[1:35:25] this and that and the thing turned over
[1:35:27] and it ran and he said say who are you
[1:35:31] he said he was the chief
[1:35:34] engineer of the company that produced
[1:35:36] that car he was the one who designed
[1:35:40] it and the one who designed it knows how
[1:35:43] to make it
[1:35:45] run and you may tinker and try to put
[1:35:48] things together to try to make it do
[1:35:49] something but the chief designer is
[1:35:51] already here and he well dressed rest in
[1:35:54] the power of his resurrection and he
[1:35:55] knows how to bring about a Rapture and
[1:35:58] he's here tonight to produce exactly
[1:36:00] what he said in his word there is a
[1:36:02] Rapture there is a people who will fly
[1:36:05] in the Rapture for he promised you shall
[1:36:08] not all sleep but you shall be changed
[1:36:11] in a moment and a twinkling of an eye he
[1:36:13] has promised it and there's Eagles here
[1:36:16] who
[1:36:22] experience
[1:36:24] oh praise the name of the
[1:36:26] Lord Amen brother bam says that mother
[1:36:29] Eagle is going to be positive that those
[1:36:32] other those Eagles are not going to be
[1:36:35] like
[1:36:36] chickens she does not want them
[1:36:38] Earthbound their Eagles and she knows
[1:36:42] their
[1:36:44] Eagles amen you may not even know it but
[1:36:47] she knows it the one who brought you
[1:36:50] forth knows who you are
[1:36:54] and this is the hour that the word has
[1:36:56] opened and this is the hour that the
[1:36:58] lamb comes forth to collect his subjects
[1:37:01] and he's going to call them from any
[1:37:03] kind of condition and that condition
[1:37:05] will not stop them from responding to
[1:37:08] his calling voice amen he said death
[1:37:11] can't hold them the sea can't hold them
[1:37:14] nothing can hold them they could be
[1:37:16] ashes scattered but he
[1:37:18] call and their
[1:37:22] answer and he's calling
[1:37:25] tonight and his own are answering
[1:37:30] back
[1:37:31] Hallelujah isn't he
[1:37:34] wonderful maybe your nest is becoming a
[1:37:38] little bit
[1:37:39] uncomfortable but because he he designed
[1:37:42] it that way that he's not going to
[1:37:43] always let you sit in a place amen where
[1:37:46] you just have to be fed by somebody else
[1:37:49] but he's going to come bring you to a
[1:37:51] place where you are going to fly and
[1:37:53] learn to feed
[1:37:58] yourself you're going to get what you
[1:38:00] have need of you're going to reach out
[1:38:03] and take it amen your hands become
[1:38:07] strong and learn how to grab hold right
[1:38:11] and not let
[1:38:12] go another thing the eagle does every
[1:38:15] morning that he gets up he will praying
[1:38:19] himself he's not Vain and looking in a
[1:38:22] mirror and trying to make himself
[1:38:24] presentable to everybody else but he's
[1:38:27] getting ready for the hunt and he will
[1:38:29] run every
[1:38:31] feather through his beak and it's like a
[1:38:34] steam clean system that he runs it
[1:38:36] through and it'll seal every feather to
[1:38:39] another brother R says you can't pull
[1:38:41] them apart with
[1:38:43] pliers what is he getting ready for amen
[1:38:45] when he does that he has he has
[1:38:48] something in his mouth that brings some
[1:38:50] waterproofing over the feather so he can
[1:38:52] go in the water and in the air whether
[1:38:55] it's fish whether it's something flying
[1:38:58] amen he is adapted to that
[1:39:01] hunt and then when he gets done printing
[1:39:04] he will sit and he'll begin to look what
[1:39:06] do I need every morning it'll take about
[1:39:09] an hour for him to do it every morning
[1:39:11] he'll get up and prepare himself for the
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:16] day come on every morning he gets up and
[1:39:20] prepares
[1:39:22] himself yeah
[1:39:24] for the
[1:39:25] hunt he just don't roll out of bed and
[1:39:28] hope God shows up but God is trained you
[1:39:32] to be an eagle to learn how to fly in
[1:39:35] the word of
[1:39:40] God brother bam said the eagle hunts for
[1:39:43] it he hunts for that food he's hungry
[1:39:47] for it nothing else can satisfy
[1:39:51] him why because he born to eat that kind
[1:39:55] of
[1:39:57] food if he's eating something diseased

[1:44:37] 11:30 at night brother Matt 11:39
[1:44:40] Saturday night I had to preach in the
[1:44:43] morning began to text me you know your
[1:44:45] only reason you're following that man
[1:44:48] he's a false
[1:44:50] prophet you're following a Deceiver the
[1:44:53] only reason you're not admitting it to
[1:44:54] your church is you don't want to give up
[1:44:56] the
[1:44:57] money said man you've been to my
[1:45:04] house I asked the Lord said Lord do you
[1:45:07] want me to reply to this
[1:45:09] man and the Lord told me don't cast your
[1:45:12] pearls before the
[1:45:14] swine so I did what any Eagle can
[1:45:18] do I hit
[1:45:21] block
[1:45:30] I wasn't going to argue with him I
[1:45:33] wasn't going to debate with him I'm not
[1:45:36] even going to listen to
[1:45:38] [Applause]
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:41] [Applause]
[1:45:42] him Amen in the nest you hear the word
[1:45:46] and you're being fed on the word but
[1:45:48] when you're kicked out of the nest
[1:45:49] you're being disciplined to the word and
[1:45:51] you're learning how to use the word
[1:45:54] [Applause]
[1:45:56] God designed this word to do exactly
[1:45:59] what it said that's why our great amen
[1:46:02] Papa Eagle said only
[1:46:07] believe amen this is not Jesus plus your
[1:46:10] thoughts Jesus plus your ability this is
[1:46:13] Jesus
[1:46:15] only it was Jesus that died for you it
[1:46:18] was Jesus that shed his blood it was
[1:46:21] Jesus who rose again it was Jesus who
[1:46:24] came back upon the church it's Jesus
[1:46:26] that's here tonight and it's Jesus
[1:46:28] that's calling your heart he's the one
[1:46:32] that I owe everything to he's the one
[1:46:35] that turned my family he's the one that
[1:46:38] prepared my Nest he's the one that
[1:46:40] kicked me out he's the one that teaches
[1:46:43] me how to
[1:46:51] fly I think it's amazing that when he's
[1:46:55] he's hovering over you and he's getting
[1:46:56] ready to kick you out that's a beginning
[1:46:59] of a creative act and at the same time
[1:47:02] there's fear and trembling amen I think
[1:47:05] it's amazing that when creative power is
[1:47:07] moving in that we can emotionally be
[1:47:10] experiencing trembling and
[1:47:13] fear the enemy wants it wants you to
[1:47:16] think it's your
[1:47:17] lack but that's not
[1:47:19] scripture the believer is constantly
[1:47:21] being told in the scripture sure fear
[1:47:25] not fear not it is I Be not Afraid fear
[1:47:32] not even in the midst of a storm and the
[1:47:35] disciples are in a boat amen and and
[1:47:37] it's rocking to and fro and they see him
[1:47:39] coming and they think it's a spirit and
[1:47:41] he said it is
[1:47:43] I be not afraid you're going to learn
[1:47:46] how to fly in a
[1:47:51] storm well if that's you you Lord B me
[1:47:54] come right come you know here's the Lord
[1:47:58] telling you you can do what I'm
[1:48:02] doing amen devil told you you can't walk
[1:48:05] on water but God said I
[1:48:07] could cuz he said come well how you
[1:48:10] going to do it I have no idea but I'm
[1:48:12] just going to step out of the
[1:48:15] boat amen you know some of you might be
[1:48:17] afraid you're going to lose a friend if
[1:48:19] you step
[1:48:20] out some of you afraid you might have to
[1:48:22] give something up if you step
[1:48:25] out amen don't worry about that if
[1:48:27] there's one calling you just step
[1:48:31] out put your eyes upon
[1:48:38] him why because it's a creative
[1:48:42] act and he's going to do in your
[1:48:47] life
[1:48:49] Hallelujah creative
[1:48:51] Acts
[1:48:54] the Bible says that he told Moses that I
[1:48:59] took you I took you I bore you amen
[1:49:05] and Deuteronomy 32 he said he flutter he
[1:49:09] taketh
[1:49:11] them now that word taketh he may take
[1:49:15] you places you don't like to
[1:49:20] go amen am this is how he dealt with
[1:49:25] Israel I took
[1:49:27] you I seized you while you were in Egypt
[1:49:31] and I brought you out and I took you
[1:49:32] away I took you to the Red
[1:49:36] Sea you remember what their reaction was
[1:49:39] at the Red Sea
[1:49:41] fear and
[1:49:43] trembling you have brought us this far
[1:49:46] to
[1:49:49] die have you brought us here to die at
[1:49:52] the hands of the Egyptians it have been
[1:49:53] better if we had stayed back
[1:49:57] there but what did God tell
[1:50:00] Moses amen you're going to learn how to
[1:50:02] fly I'm teaching you how to seize the
[1:50:04] wind right speak to the children of
[1:50:09] Israel that they go
[1:50:12] forward forward do you see what's in
[1:50:16] front of
[1:50:18] me there's a Red Sea in front of me
[1:50:21] here's the enemy behind me don't worry
[1:50:23] about the
[1:50:24] enemy there's somebody standing between
[1:50:27] him and
[1:50:28] you don't worry about him just speak and
[1:50:32] go
[1:50:34] forward Moses the eagle took his rod and
[1:50:37] he stretched it out I don't know how
[1:50:40] he's going to do it you know what it's
[1:50:42] not my business to know how he's going
[1:50:45] to do it it's my business to believe it
[1:50:48] and when he stretched it out God worked
[1:50:51] the miracle in some something that they
[1:50:53] could not see a way through you know God
[1:50:55] can look where there is no door and he
[1:50:57] can make a door he can look at a SE
[1:50:59] where there is no Road and he can make a
[1:51:01] road he can look at something wet and
[1:51:03] make it
[1:51:05] dry that's the God that I serve

[1:51:30] hour the word is in the bride like it is
[1:51:33] in Mary he prophesied that in this hour
[1:51:35] there'd be the same Harmony between the
[1:51:38] bride that there was between Jesus
[1:51:40] Christ and the father and that he amen

[1:52:17] chapter it says the devil came back to
[1:52:20] God again he said you let me touch his
[1:52:25] health skin for skin what will man give
[1:52:28] for his
[1:52:29] life God says you can touch his health

[1:57:30] minute let's go down into a dark
[1:57:35] basement and in this basement is a
[1:57:38] man and he's standing by a little
[1:57:41] bed and that bed is a little baby dying
[1:57:46] right suffering so hard that his eyes
[1:57:49] are
[1:57:50] crossed flies of land it on his body
[1:57:52] underneath the net this man was
[1:57:57] suffering his wife had just

[1:58:04] before that a
[1:58:06] sinner his church was
[1:58:09] dwindling he'd lost his brother not too

[1:58:19] baby he said
[1:58:21] God don't let my little baby
[1:58:28] die and a black
[1:58:31] sheet fell down in front of
[1:58:34] him and he
[1:58:36] knew God had refused
[1:58:44] him God never even said no he just
[1:58:47] didn't talk to him
[1:58:50] right go this man had preached Divine
[1:58:53] Healing this man had baptized people in
[1:58:56] the name of Jesus Christ this man had
[1:58:59] preached and people had been healed

[1:59:24] old crow goes to
[1:59:27] yapping you know if God really loved

[1:59:45] baths he'd give you everything you
[1:59:48] want he's going to show you what a
[1:59:50] Victorious Christian looks like
[1:59:53] he likes to tell you

[1:59:58] moved up when God refused my
[2:00:03] prayer

[2:00:08] him and now he won't listen to
[2:00:11] you you've prayed and God has answered

[2:00:25] him why don't you leave
[2:00:28] him you know brother brandom said I open
[2:00:32] my
[2:00:33] mouth to
[2:00:36] say if that's the way God's going to
[2:00:39] be I'll no longer serve
[2:00:44] him I want to tell you
[2:00:46] something the message of Malachi
[2:00:50] 4 hung in the
[2:00:53] balance on the decision of a man who
[2:00:57] said I'm no longer going to serve him he
[2:00:59] said I open my
[2:01:02] mouth to
[2:01:04] say I won't serve him
[2:01:07] anymore in that strong dark time
[2:01:13] couldn't feel God
[2:01:15] on he said but when I open my
[2:01:20] mouth
[2:01:22] on it needs to be real quiet right

[2:01:29] longer serve him
[2:01:34] something and I'm asking you do you have
[2:01:38] that something way down on the
[2:01:42] inside moved

[2:02:31] years ago exactly like job prophesied
[2:02:35] there would be a redeemer come and death
[2:02:37] would not hold him the darkest condition
[2:02:40] Jesus did not walk up to Calvary and joy
[2:02:43] he walked up without the spirit of God
[2:02:46] on him he walked up
[2:02:50] alone crying
[2:02:53] out amen but God looked upon that body
[2:02:57] and he saw you in him amen and Jesus
[2:03:02] refused to give in to what the devil
[2:03:05] asked him to do just give in amen you
[2:03:07] can have a few more years of a good life
[2:03:10] give in and live that way but he refused
[2:03:13] to do it in his trial he opened on his
[2:03:16] mouth he was beaten he was abused and he
[2:03:19] went up as a man to die alone
[2:03:25] he died alone cuz he knows what
[2:03:27] loneliness feels like he did not die
[2:03:30] like a
[2:03:31] buzzard he did not die like a
[2:03:34] chicken he died Like an
[2:03:37] Eagle remembering what David said I'll
[2:03:39] not suffer my Holy One to see corruption
[2:03:42] and he kept his eyes and his focus on
[2:03:45] that though he no longer felt God Amen
[2:03:48] when he was on the cross being mocked he
[2:03:50] cried out my God why have you forsaken

[2:03:57] alone so that you could feel
[2:04:01] him amen he knows what it's like to fall
[2:04:04] he knows what it's like to feel alone
[2:04:07] but you don't have to be alone
[2:04:09] anymore amen and when he died and he was
[2:04:12] buried but on the third day he rose
[2:04:18] again amen he rose again he was a rumor
[2:04:22] at first but then he became a
[2:04:24] reality don't let him be a rumor let him
[2:04:26] be a reality tonight amen it's a real

[2:06:05] else do you know why he was in that
[2:06:07] condition he was in that condition

[2:06:11] Pentecostal
[2:06:13] church he listened to someone else who
[2:06:15] criticized him which was his
[2:06:17] mother-in-law he allowed a relationship
[2:06:20] to stop him from going over over there
[2:06:22] to preach that gospel to them why
[2:06:24] because the seed had to move it had to
[2:06:27] come to a place where you could hear the
[2:06:28] word you know I am preaching this

[2:07:08] of all reasonings something inside of
[2:07:11] all emotions and everything else there
[2:07:13] was an inside man that held in that hour
[2:07:17] and nothing else could have done it
[2:07:20] every reason everything that could be
[2:07:22] showed everything that could prove it
[2:07:24] was wrong and I was in the wrong but the
[2:07:27] word of God that was predestinated
[2:07:30] before the foundation of the world held
[2:07:32] on the inside right do you know what he

[2:08:21] out of the nest to leave me but when he
[2:08:25] kicks me out he flies around me and
[2:08:28] he'll catch me and he'll bring me up
[2:08:30] again and he'll drop me again and he's
