the spirit many many years ago well let him F you again and just saturate saturate your whole being with his spirit amen we have this privilege of serving the lord today we got a year looking ahead we'll have a New Year's service on Tuesday night it will not be a Wednesday night meeting this coming up but Tuesday night brother Murphy will be speaking we have brother Murphy Wong with us today to minister to us I think you know God's grace Upon Our Lives and reach an ever predestinated seed I think of what the scriptures said where he where he declared and made it clear that this last prophecy would be to every nation Kindred tongue and people I think it where he said that the book would be sealed into the time of the end in the Book of Daniel he tells us the words are closed up and sealed at the time of the end but then it'll be a time where men will run to and fro travel will be vastly increased and I think in this day where we have the opportunity to reach around the world even in this broadcast today in the services that will go forth from this church I know that God will minister to hearts and lives of people he'll reach his elect he'll call his bride to attention and even those that are out of Step will hear the words of God to get back in line and we're here today if you know maybe you're out of line maybe you've been out of Step today's there's no day like today to get in line just get in March and tune with the Gospel of Jesus Christ we're in the last days little children and we must prepare for the coming of the lord we are nearer now than when we first believed so as we today prepare our hearts I want to just welcome our brother Murphy Wong brother Murphy is a precious dear friend of mine and someone that I've learned to love and respect his in his ministry has blessed thousands around the world back in 1995 brother John leay and those that were with him witnessed to him and and from there he it started a journey and he he came to know the Lord and a greater way than he ever knew him and the message of the of the hour took hold in his life and he didn't just sit on it but you know since that time he has translated ever sermon of brother Brams in into um the Chinese language this next year by February uh in the month of February he'll finish the uh voice over of the ever taped sermon that's where brother bram's voice is played in the background and an interpretation into Chinese will go into there we'll make a tape for them to listen so he'd be the voice of William brandham in China and so is then but that wasn't all but seeing that they had only the official version of the Chinese Bible that would be allowed by the government he translated the Bible Into The King The King James Bible into the uh the language the Chinese language for the Chinese people so that they would have the whole word of God because the Bibles that they had left a lot out and so you know this has been his burden this has been his vision and I want him to be able to share that with you today of what God has done in his life and how he's used him and then how that we're here in this last day to finish the Divine call we're the last runners in the race and the Baton has been passed to you so as we take and we run and we look toward 2025 we want to run with all our hearts we want to throw every encumbrance on our lives aside every weight every sin that would so easily beset us pushing aside all unbelief and put everything we got into it and finish the race we want to finish strong we want to finish strong today at the end of the service we'll have a baptismal service Sister Janice Adams has just really surrendered her life to the Lord I've known him for many many years and you know this is a testimony for many of you you might have been up you might have been down you might have been in you might have been out of church and whatever but you know there comes that moment in a life where you make that full surrender and I believe she has made a full surrender to God she wants she wants to know she's filled with the Holy Ghost and she's prepared to meet the Lord so today her son brother Joe Adams and I will baptize her in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I believe there's one coming after that will fill her with the Holy Ghost baptize her with the Holy Ghost in fire amen let's as we close out this year let's close it out with a Thanksgiving to God for the great things that he has done and with a look toward 2025 that I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus God bless you brother Murphy as you come and share your heart today pour your spirit out on me just like the [Music] rain saturate thirst my [Music] thirsty fall Ares on [Music] me my cup again my and make behold I need bless [Music] brother God bless you all so good uh to be back at again it's been quite a few years uh uh ago I was uh here and uh really enjoyed all the fellowship and uh uh to be with uh brother Tim it was always my uh heart of the heart of a desire and yesterday we have a a wonderful time together uh I I told brother Tim I almost feel like I had to sit at the feet of Jesus to listen to uh the Jesus uh expounding the word to me and uh as the disciples on the road of EMAs uh when the Jesus is coming uh out of the Bush to talk to them and said they said uh isn't our when he was talking to us explaining the scripture to us uh is in our hearts feels this Burning inside that's how I felt I appreciate your pastor brother Tim very very much and he has been um hero of of the faith to me has encouraged me so many ways and in so many times and I bringed a greeting from the clel Bible Way and uh brother at bisco and then my uh Pastor former pastor and now brother Tom Ray is the pastor and uh and all the people that uh you have many friends is over there and they just want to greeting all of you and may the Lord bless you for everything that you have done for the gospel and if you don't mind I'll just invite you to the scripture right away let's turn to a a book of a numbers book of numbers of chapter 21 I'll let read from verse one and when King read the Canaanites which had dwelt in this house H tell that Jesus of that the Israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against the Israel and took some of them prisoners and Israel vow a vow unto the Lord and said if thou will indeed deliver this people into my hand then I will utterly destroy their City uh and the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and he called the name of the place of horah and they journeyed from the mount by the way of the Red Sea to comp to come past the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way and the people spake it against God and that against Moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loest this light bread and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bite the people and much people out of Israel died therefore that the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and that against thee prayed unto the Lord that he take away the serpents from us and Moses pray for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and said it everyone that is bit and and that that everyone that is Abit when he looks upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of breast and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld a serpent of breast he liveth may the Lord blesses his word let's just bow our head one once more our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we have a turn over the pages but Lord that this is not a merely just an ank on the page but this is a God's Own word Lord you have a say so but he take the Holy Spirit to reveal what is the countenance is inside of it Lord we dare not to use our own interpretation our own mind but Lord it take you to reveal your word to each heart that represented and he so Lord we ask you to speak Lord Lord I commit myself as a humble vessel ask you to use your servants Lord I'm trembling because not because of the people but because of you Lord only you has ability to reveal your word to us we thank you Father we commit ourselves into your hand ask you to speak to our heart in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated uh once more I want to say uh thank you so much there especially uh brother Tim to give me this opportunity to uh speak to you uh you know years ago uh brother Tim just um uh mentioned that I was um came into the message in 1995 uh forever remembered that a moment when brother John le uh that he has um uh put put all the message book in his backpack and then went out to a a garment to church just outside of there and shared a a message to me a little I think a little did he know that it will become the result like today little did I know that will be the uh the result of the today how the word that came my way and but I know that God has a greater picture and at our eyes when look at it things we only look at uh so far right now because we're human but when God to look at his things he look way further ahead but it doesn't it doesn't take it us to uh to see far because as a human we don't see far but we're so thankful to the Lord he led us to have the spirit to yield to him and when we don't see far but we have a confidence to know whatever God has ordained whatever God has has plan that he will Carri out and if we just surrendered our will to him then uh he will make it things as come to pass and uh I just saw brother Craig uh so nice to see you again has been the bosom of friends that we've been the uh been the ministers that in the Wai in Connecticut and in your uh churches over there and we have a wonderful time I just have so many people is that David I just cannot believe that's uh that's a impossible and he I couldn't I was just drawn I said I think that David well God bless you and so many friends over here just so I want to may the Lord bless every one of you and I would like you to speak this morning just to give it a title look and live you know we're coming to the time uh we really need to be focused um this is um brother BR says uh uh in a message that said when it come to the end of the world and when it come to the end of the consummation of the time and especially look to Jesus because there are so many distractions that on this Earth in this time uh is it's not how you are look at at the one thing is to keep on looking at because as the time goes by you will find out is um to look at a just one right thing become harder and harder and harder and to look at the things that that God ordained you to look at it become more difficult than ever it it's not because it's not attractive it's because there are so many distractions so many things that you could look at and if the certain if the people they look at to the certain thing you'll find out they become a weary they be they become a boring if just like the people the Lord just give them uh in the Israel the Lord will just give them the victory but very soon and the complaints start to come murmur start to come and people are so easily to forget what God has done that's that's why God constantly reminding us God doesn't constantly renewing things to attract our attention that is the world doing that is an entertainment in this world doing that is the videos of the movies and it everything they try to attract it to the people but God always just do us one thing he said keep look at the things I first give you to Luc it's uh but the devil who had got all the tinsels he got all the invention he got all the voices he got all the new Gadget some new idea some new psychology psychology some new book uh some new uh uh new YouTube version uh this person's idea that person's idea it was a constantly try to draw you and when time come like that especially Look Away to Jesus and is in the time that that a lot of time you'll find out when we look at the things and we become um uh seemingly the things that we look at doesn't do us any good and then that the people they get easily it's not this not only just distracted they said you know what I need to find some new way it seems like this doesn't work if you're taking a medication there one medication you go to the doctor and uh they they try you almost feel like you're a guinea pig and uh you go to the doctor they said that you know I got a certain symptom okay try this one and if this one doesn't work you go back to the doctor and said okay try this one and then the one after the one after the uh who are we you know uh am I just the garbage just a testing of the drug if this is work and that one to work but that's a human doctor but when God doing things he doesn't changes the medication when you take the medication doesn't work it's not to have just said okay give me some a new medication Lord give me some a new idea give me some a new preacher give me a new pastor give me some the new or things online this person said that no go back to the message God never changes a medication if the inoculation work on Jesus and that inoculation will work on you and God just like in the uh in a book of the first king if the Lord give the time we can go into that uh a little later and when the when the uh uh Elijah asked his the Servants of Gesa and went up to take a look and uh he asked him and said look at go up to look seven times and the g the servant in my wall say the first time I look nothing happened he said it didn't say change the direction he didn't say go look at the right and the Elijah said go up to look at again I been look at it to the Sea which is to the west and nothing happened he doesn't said to change your way of looking change the direction he said look at the same direction and look at the Time After Time After Time and one the seventh time there's a cloud rising and is in this seven times age if we keep on looking you will see that a rising Morning Star start to rising in your heart we have a more sure word in this hour God never change he want you to look at it the same thing you know appreciate the message just s simple message it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain no matter how how much many different angle he approach he approach to the same subject is going to RN 120 years just thinking about it brother Tim PR if he can live that long he preached one message is going to RN it R last night he said it's impossible for another he only have one message to preach about and that it's going to rain you know we only have one message to preach it about it's going to have a Rapture it's going to have a body change God give us a message in this hour this is the only way for you to go to [Applause] that there's no other way this is the only way that you need to look at but instead of looking the way to the right thing you'll find out the people when they keep on looking at the right thing people want changes many times we look at the God's promise we look at God's word but it seems like it doesn't work wake after wake months after months you find out if the word work it should work now if the word should work my trial should be over it's been many years if this a work Lord 10 years is not enough for me to go into the tunnel and never saw the end of it Lord my children has been back has been backslide has been Wayward for so many years is another 5 years is not enough how long Lord are you going to wait and then we start to look at us things differently you still come to the church you still sit that at a pew but Zeal start to losing the passion start to losing why because when you're holding a gun gun it's not at the first second the second second when you're holding the the gun the longer you hold your hand start to shaking when you first your adrenaline when you go to hunting when you're adrenaline start to coming up your in your blood is that a word adrenaline I I I don't hunt so I don't know how how that feel so when you're holding that you try to calm yourself you try to aiming to the right but if the target isn't moving and you're holding you try to go in that the longer you hold and the the gun become a heavier you find out that there's many times that the people that start to losing their focus they're losing their aiming it's not that they don't aiming it it's not they don't Focus but they don't Focus long enough and then when he become a weary then he start to look at a different things and Israelites One Day become a weary instead of having the Mana instead of having the Lord had given them they said that this is a light bread we want something different we want to taste different we don't want a Mana anymore we want pizza we want a burger we want a different flavor Lord that this the one flavor you have been feding us for so long we want a different flavor of her preaching we want a different flavor of idea we want a different flavor of a music we want a different all thing all this world don't you find out and the world will try to cering to the people's taste is that that the the nutrients it's the taste of it it's you go to the restaurant you don't go for a restaurant maybe you do just for salad I said poor you you go to your restaurant you for a taste you go to the restaurant you for excitement you go to a restaurant you want some spice you want some of the Exotic I know the woman I mean the sisters that go there just for salad why bother but you know believer shouldn't be that that way when God provided the food it doesn't just try to change the the flavor to catering you the nutrient that everything still the same he give it to you you eat it no matter which part of it you eat it no matter what flavor of it you eat it because it's good for you but as the time goes on no matter what church you go to no matter how wonderful your pastor is no matter how wonderful word that you heard people want to hear something something different they want to taste different they want an excitement you wanted something that more exotic that's how people start to Falling it way and that the Bible in the Book of Numbers chapter 21 it said to those people when it start a murmur start to complain then God sended a serpent the fiery serpents and it amongst them then when a when the fiery serpent start to biting them how that happens people lose focus people become aboring people start to finding something new then God sended a fiery serpent start to biting them I think it's behooved to us to let us refocus refocus on the right thing you said the things that doesn't happen keep on looking at the right thing when things is right when God has indic it when God has a give it or to prove it that's behoove to us to look at what God has to prove to vindicate it or to be the truth and one of fiery serpent was sending it into them and then we find out the people and there been hundreds of thousands of the people start to Ding and because of the fire serpent was was abiding them and then but even in that condition but God has a full of Mercy that he given him a remedy and he give or given him a cure for it and the Cure is lift up of a pole and put a breast serpent on it and the people who look at to the the bre Serpent and they can be healed you know you can't stop the the serpent to bite because when God sented the serpent amongst them no matter how you try to avoid it will bite them but God put a remedy give it to them let me put it in this way you can't stop the sickness to bite you no matter how healthy you are no matter how wonderful body that you've been built sooner or later you will get sick you're young people you might not feel that but when you're getting about five years or 10 years and you will start to feel the weakening of the body start to get on you and I'm 53 and I feel that's uh each uh well not not that yet each day not each day yet but each year passing or a few months of the the passing I feel some aching start to coming and it's coming on your body and I start to I start to relate it more have more sympathy to my dead and I started more sympathy to the older older people because of the older you get and the more sickness you're easy to get sick and it it just curs the body that we're living in you can't stop that the serpent to bite you no matter how you try to take care of your body no matter how you try to eat a salad every day and if sooner or later it will get on you and then I heard some people well that me just a just drink eat and drink uh uh cuz tomorrow I die because they let me just have a burger every day I just uh uh CU we're going to we're going to go to that way uh anyway I won't go down that but there was some people said idea you find out and the longer that we're living on this body is um um subject to uh to the attack that in this uh uh whatever sickness or or or things that in this world and no matter how you try to avoid a trial the trial will get on you no matter how you try to avoid a hurt the hurt will bite you there was a many things that we find out that on this Earth no matter how you try to escape sooner or later as the time goes on it will start to bite you you can't stop the the the biting of the the serpent but God provides a remedy for it and when God provided a remedy it was just a simple remedy it was just a lift out of the pole and put a breast serpent on it and people who look at it they can be healed it's not of people run to it it's not the people crawling to it but is the people who look at that breast of the serpent that means that the sickness has been judged the sin has been judged the hurt has been judged the complaint has been Jud judged everything that has been judged and when the people they look at that then they can be healed let's dramatize this a little bit and one of the people one the people got to bite to bed a serpent and that they they they can feel that the death start to get into uh their bloodstream start to going to their brain they start to losing their vision and their their Vision start to getting blur their body start to getting weakened but then because there is a breast of serpent that was erased up in amongst the camp and that the person and according to the prophets commandment if he just look that serpent that he can be healed and maybe when it first look at it it seems like nothing happened but as he keep on looking that then his vision started getting better the bloodstream started getting the the the poison that in the in the in the blood start to disting that stren start to getting back on him and then it start to get his body recovered and I was thinking what a testimony that was and that that young man or an older man and he started to testify that it to the people he said when they look at that Serpent and did the believe or not what a prophet has said was absolutely the truth when we look at the message when we look at the word that Jesus has paid the price for me and my sickness was healed and that the her was of was a healed and my way were children that come back to life go come back to the to the seaold again what a testimony that is and that encouraged in many other people they keep on looking they keep on looking and one after another one after another and the people got healed what a Revival that it caused though there is a there is a condemnation because they have complain and murmur because they do the things that that is a wrong but God given them a remedy and then what a remedy give it to them they to prove that it work and testimony after testimony and they start to to the coming people got very excited and there the more more people as I said you can't stop that the serpent to bite you don't know one that to strike you don't know one is that come to your family but God provided a remedy for us that are people that look that they can live as time goes on you know when they look at that people start to getting boring people start to getting uh said maybe they're sharing their testimony a little bit of the difference and one man and who was bite by The Serpent and he was almost going to die then he look at the pole then he seemingly doesn't work but that man become a desperate he start to running but as he run his weak his um body start to failing him his strength started to gone that he's crawling and his crawling but in his heart he was a desperate he said I must get to that the pole I must to get to that breast serpent because of that's my sin was judged my sickness was a judged and his was a crawling his a crawling his a strength is a failling him but finally he get to that pole and he embrace it and he look up and then he saw his vision start to come back to him he start to his as the Blood start to flow in it again and his biting started fading away and this man started sharing testimony he come to even in light Tabernacle he said you know what Brother The Prophet's word says absolutely the truth the word is working he said I was a far away he said I was a bite by the serpent something happened to me I started feeling I lost my strength I lost my Zeal I lost my passion he said I start to run I start to become a passionate I start to run toward that the pole I run to the remedy that the prophet give it to me I look I run I my strengths start to filling me but in one of the service the pastor was just preaching keep on running keep on running keep on believing he said I keep on running he said finally I get to the pool yes I embrace it yes he said I was a healed you know something wrong with that testimony something wrong is not his running is not is crawling he said my finger started bleeding my nail almost pulled off he said my strengths is losing but I become a desperate that's wonderful but what next oh oh I run to the pool I finally I can touch it I can feel it I embrace it yeah yes but what next what next I embraced the pole I got healed brother you forget one last thing is to look and live though you did all of that but it's not your running it's not your embracing it's your final look that look then you live amen it's not your running it's not your embracing it's your believing it's not only your pounding at an altar it's not you just to do this do that you believe you can pound as much as you can but you must to do that final look and live you must to believe this is mine healing is mine Joy is mine peace is in mine you must look and live no matter how sick it I get I believe that's the truth that look that makes you sickness become a healed no matter how Wayward our children are our family has been backod but I believe I look and then I live don't forget to the last part you might do all your running you might do all your pounding you might all your crawling but don't for God faith believe what he ever said look straight to that word and keep on looking it's not to keep on running to it but it Keep On Believing to it don't add anything else Keep On Believing believe it what's the word what a promise has said about your situation what is the word of a God has give it to you you know the pool was in the middle of the camp and is race it high so that everybody can look and live everybody can look at when he lifted it up it would draw all men unto me Jesus said some people might be very far they look at a pole when it bites by the serpent am I thinking that's too far it seems like for me to get back to the house of God just too far it seems like to me in my situation just so far gone I don't even know how how my life can be transformed I've been boring in a message I've been sitting in a in the to but you know what I never met God though the pole was Far maybe some people was close to the pole they still have to look no matter how they touch how they fail how they do whatever that they try to do they still have to look up but no matter how far they way it's not that a detail of what is the end that poll and saying they vary all the Inc all the craving carving all the no even that far you can't see the detail of it even it's that's so far away you can't even see clear of it but as long as you move your focus on that direction where the serpent has been judged sin has been judged sin has no domaining on you when you look at that you might not have the Seven Seals of Revelation yet you might to know exactly what is the how is it going to be but as long as you believe it and your sickness will be healed your back siding will be healed and your we word will be healed no matter how bite the serpent has been biting you but as long as you look into that you can be healed and that healing is not only one time is not when you've been bite one time then you got an immune system and start to kick in it's the time after time when you were bitten and the time after time you will look at it's not because you look at it one time you got immune system and build up and next time the serpent doesn't bother you every time the preacher can be bite and the spiritual man can be bitten time after time but time after time they have to look back to the word of God said to look and live whatever the word of God God has said I look to that it's not because we're preacher to we build up immune system and everything that we can resist and automatically every time we have to look into the word every time we look at it the serpent has been judged is to believe every word of a god Set to be the truth as I said that you can't stop to the B the serpent to bite brother said it in the blind berus had talk about the little Moses and I heard his parents I have to put him into the buket and then send him to a river of Nile was all the crocodiles and and everything and he said it's just like a breast serpent why the serpent didn't have no virtue in it he said it was a piece of a breast and they brought it up out of E Egypt and nether the pole have any virtue in it not a bit but it was obeying what God Said do what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God but you know as the time goes on even the come to the time that breast serpent people start to burn incense to it instead of a just a look and live live people always feel that we needed to put something into it we always have to do something and to put out our idea put our way our thinking of toward to it he said look it's too simple why don't we just burn incense that shows more sincerity that we have but God said no it's not to burn in an incense you can burn incense to many things to your own idea to your own thinking it might work it as one time but if you keep on keep on just as I said the people start to burning ancest to their own oh I this is done this is good for me I I craw I climbed I do everything that that I do but if you forgot that that the last the look and live you still won't be healed brother BMA said in the power of a devil he said how that it go into the river he talking about Moses that he take the little ones that have throw him in a river and then notice that that's the end of Satan's domain his domain can only come that far to the river and then his power is cut off it said it is that Satan has the power over death but thanks be to thanks be to the Living God who has the power of a resurrection he said beyond the shadow of the death he said what a Marvel thing it is and he said his domain can only come that far to the river then his power is cut off Satan can throw you into sickness but he is not the one determined the outcome of it Satan can throw your loved ones into a chaotic condition or send them the backslide to the world but Satan cannot determin the final outcome of it you have more control than he does Satan can throw the Hebrew children into the fiery furnace but he can't control the outcome of it is it a God himself and like a son son of a God that a forc man start to walk in the fiery furnace that fan off the power of the flame Satan doesn't control it but you control it Satan maybe put you into trou put you into difficult put you into the things that you probably never would think that will get out upon you but you control the outcome of it by faith believing the the word you have more control than Satan has do the reason is you don't belong to him you belongs to God if you belongs to him he has the more control he can do whatever he can do he wants to do but because uh you're not belonging to him so he has no claim among you Jesus said in the John 14 and3 just before Jesus was uh a was nailed on on the cross he was a taken away from the disciples he said here after I will not talk much with you he said for the prin of this world cometh and he has nothing in me let me read that another translation of it and he said I will not talk with you much more for the prince The Evil Genius the ruler of the world is coming and he has no claim on me he has nothing in common with me there is a nothing in me that belong belongs to him and he has no power over me when I look at that I saw how marvelous that is that's not only talk about a Jesus but that's a you and me too because you are the genin of God and if Jesus if he said the prince of this the world to come and he has nothing in me or he has no claim on on me and I'll see when a prince of this world though he still on this Earth but he has no claim on you and on me either he has nothing in common with me and I'll say yes he has nothing in common with me and I have everything in common with God inside of my inside the Gin is not of my own father it's a mothers but the Gin was coming from God himself and that because of of my soul and I was born again you were born again that gen was coming from God so Satan has no claim on you Satan has cannot claim your soul because that Soul doesn't belongs to them that Soul belongs to God himself and they said that there's nothing common there there he has nothing in common with me you said oh in my body and I I this body body doesn't belongs to Satan this body belongs to God Satan only perverts this body but original owner is a still God any one day and when I received the word and something changed the inside of me though on the outside hasn't been changed but because of the inside has been changed so is's working from the inside out it had taking control of my spirit and it would taking control of my body that the body to be subjected to the word of God Satan has no claim on this body even I died but God is an original owner well one day will change his body in an incorruptable form so just like it the Christ the life that the inside of him and it doesn't belongs to the Satan the life the inside of you and me doesn't belong to the Satan Nei it belongs to God himself and he cannot claim what is rightfully belongs to God and Satan since the power was limited as I said he can throw into the sickness and into the trial but it cannot determine the outcome of it and Satan in another word he was abound he was abound by the power of God and God only allowed him to go certain distance he can only go so far Satan is not annihilated yet in one day in in future he will be annihilated he will be thrown into the lake of a fire he will be completed to become a nothing but right now he's only bound he's not annihilated he was AB bound because sin has been judged in the Book of Romans chapter 83 says for what the law could not do in that it was a weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned the sin in the flesh and the the sin was condemned not because of that because of Jesus and so if if I can say in this way then Satan the Devil is being condemned is being judged though he was not annihilated but he has been condemned the things that has to bother you has been condemned has been judged have you go to the court probably most of you don't that's good I never been there but I saw some uh uh some of the court and when they go to the court and the the person who was a condemned or judged or like a criminal they put a handcuffed on him and they they take him better the sheriff and to the court and waiting for it is a verdict to be sentenced and when it is the verdict was a pass sentence to jail or sentence to uh execute it the execution doesn't happen they're right out of court there and then go to the prison still have a distance he has to be taken away and there's a there's a time that he go into the prison still other period of a time but the one that aord he was a handcuffed he he was a deprived of his the freedom he cannot just move freely as much as he didn't want that person may be threatening to the person on the witness um desk that per that criminal may be uh threatening with his word I tried to shake shaking his feet and to do everything he can but he was deprived of his Freedom though his a Conant is still fears and he's hate full of hatred but he cannot have a full power to do what he want to do the only thing that he can do he might curse you he might say bad word about you but he doesn't possess any real power to do that because he was a judged and I say Satan has been judged Satan has been bound because of Jesus Christ has already paid a price for the sin he condemned the sin in his flesh he judged the sin in his flesh so that sin will have no domination upon you he has no Dominion on you you don't have to leave Unholy life you don't have to live a pretended hypocrisy life you can put your foot on his neck that the sin has been judged Satan might accuse you he might condemn you and said you did this and you did that but the blood of Christ hasn't paid all the price for me because the sin has been judged so he was a deprived from his freedom he couldn't do anything that he wanted he was a bound he was a handcuffed let me bring you another point of here he was not fully annihilated but in the future yes he will be but right now he was a bind and the time that the time that we said we bind the devil you don't bind the devil just by Your Word you bind the Devil by your life brother BR said in a Christian and an answer he would talk about in the millennium he said Satan was bound but what he was bound he but he was bound he said A Thousand Years Satan was a loose out of his prison that is abound by an Angel with a chin not a lock chin but a chin of circumstances it's not that the Satan was abound just by a chin and tried to Chin hand cover him him up so it's not that you bind it up just by Your Word by your It Is by Your Word but it's a life of the inside which your word has confessed and match up with what is on the inside it's a displaying that a token that Satan will recognize that is a displaying of your life that Satan will recognize that but bre said he said he said about a chain of the circumstances of all of his subject was in hell and all that was resurrected on Earth was redeemed and Jesus wisdom he couldn't work on nothing the reason that Satan was abounded in the Millennium because there's no unbelievers over there he cannot work on the unbelief he the only way that he can be Unbound is if there's unbelief in there that he can have something that Satan can work with but if you believe there's nothing inside of you that he can work with he can work on believer he can work on unbeliever but if when you have a faith when you look and live when you've been born again when there's a new life living in you Satan was bind by the circumstances brother BR said that the church that's on Earth is redeemed and to right in the presence of a Christ so he has nothing he can work on so it's not a chain as I said a lot chain it's a chain of circumstances he has nothing he can do he is helpless and hopeless think of what a position that you are in my brother and my sisters is not how loud we can shout to to bite him to cuss him to cast him out it's the life that inside of you if Jesus has to said that the prince of the world has to come but he has nothing in me he can't claim anything in me it Ain I what in myself there's no unbelief no unbel that the Satan can come can work with can clim this is mine you know the Satan can come to you and with a smoke and with a drink with a drug and things but when he come he find out there's nothing no desire in there why God has to change you he can't claim nothing he can't work on nothing has no power to work on because the circumstances has a CH him you that I've been born again that inside of you there's a different life in there that bind Satan he tried to influence you he try to do everything that he can but it's nothing that he can work with then he become a helpless and a hopeless but said in the chist Myster of God reveal he said that Christ is the living through you so pregnant which is a spirit that you are a prisoner to anything else you are confined to the gospel confined to the word word uh word and all the children that you can bring forth is that he said because you are a prisoner you can't commit adultery you are already pregnant Glory he can take a hold the womb of alive is a closed to anything else you are already his by predestination the seed has come to life no world can get in when you receive the seed word of God that seed is the inside of you and you're responding to the word then the womb was closed and nothing else can get in there and brother BR said as as soon as of the life giving flow that seed laying there other seed that just would come in wouldn't take a hold just couldn't do it why they couldn't do it it doesn't say that outer seed don't want to come in they will try all their best try to come into you but when you receive the the word that Faith whom has reive the word then the womb was closed though they outer SE they tried to to get in but because of the womb was closed there the seed from the outside couldn't get in you are changed when you receive the word in this hour and it when by faith you receive it and your life changed and that shows it's not you live anymore but Christ are living inside of you though the influence of the world try to come he will not go in there though the devil try to put a trick and put it on your trap try to set a trap for you but he couldn't do that why because it he was abound by the circumstances inside of you there's another life living in there so Satan cannot come in to claim anything that belongs to him because you were born again there's a different life living in you and he can come claim temper but it's not in there I know when I said that some people said it won't take a hold if there was a real believer when there is something they do wrong right away Lord forgive me that bleach is still there that blood is still there so Satan cannot come to claim anything that rightfully belongs to him but there's one can claim you God can claim you because inside of you there's a soul and that's a g of God that's a rightfully belongs to God himself Satan couldn't claim it Satan might put things on you but you never lost that the life that God had to put it in there before the foundation of the world the Bible talk about the prodical son though he is a prodal but he's a still son he's a son forever sometime you feel you might be like a prodal but still the sunship never lost the sunship still inside of you the prodal might be in the peak pan but a sunship never lost he's a still son that a born in the family just one day that prodical son wake up why he can wake up why not other son we C because he's coming from the father's house the boss of the prodical son never wake up the colleague of the prodical son never wake up but a prodical son wake up and the angel brother BR was a tap on his shoulder said it's time to go home and when that tap is his s that prodical son start to get back home when a son get back home the father put a robe on him put a band on him and put a shoes around him he's a Ste a son he never lost his sunship how the father prove that he never lost it he gave it what is rightfully belongs to a son the slave never wear shoes but the son wear shoes the slave never world that unmerited grace of God that the band that had put on his finger but the son would do and that the robe that was still put on the sun it in our way we're thinking he need to take a shower before you put a robe on him but the father never let him take a shower the way to receive a son is not to you got to clean up first the way to receive the son give him a more give him more grace give him a more robe give it them more the gospel that shot as a shoe give it them more unmerited the wedding bner that they give it to them it's not to take a shower clean up clip your nail then we can put the Rob on him it's the f hard when a son is a prodigal but when a prodigal coming home he said I will give you my robe over righteousness I will give you the grace that you are not merited all father's want the brother B said all father's want just want a son to come home and a father would take care of the rest of of you might be in the prodical station stage you said oh I I Bor in a m you might be in that prodical sense stage even sitting in a peo but your mind and is somewhere else and your life is not a cul of the wiard is not trying to like oh I you try to clean up you try to quit this you receive the word the father only wanted one thing that done to you it's said I put out my robe of righteousness is on you put under my grace that you are not IMM merited along you it's not to try to give it an excuse for the sin but in order to get rid of all of that it's like God's own life living inside of you pray look and live when you look you can live and Jes and he cares to do you care brother BR talking about other Legion and he was uh possessed of thousands of demons brother BR said he care when a neurotic called Legion carrying not under opposition to we go out from under those Tombstone of the devils and to go out to meet Jesus and throw himself prostrate one Legion them Devils of would have never come if Legion hadn't have a pushes way out there to meet him and why he car enough to make that effort that stand in his belief Jesus car enough to cast out this religion of the Devils from him that Legion has to make a move though as the thousands of a devil has a possess of this Allegiance and that seems like it was a fully controlled by all the demon power but that Legion still possessed that a power he can move out of the Tomb because the inside of that allegion there's a predestinated seed is in there no matter how outward appears it maybe seems like completely hopeless and helpless but inside there there's a gene that belongs to God and though de demon possessed him even when that Legion come out of the Tomb he still bris it out the curse he still bris it out just like that a demon power has was a talk he said are he said are you coming he said our time is is not here yet he said you come to torture us but inside of that there's a gene that's a predestinated by God thousand thousand of a demon cannot hold him thousands of those demon the fils a demon the pornography demon and all those are demon the lust of the demon the hypocrisy demon the depression demon the bitterness demon all those demon though has to possess them and drive him to the tomb but those demon cannot hold the G inside of that Legion the legion still possessed inside of him there's a power when she when he recognized that his original owner has a coming to him Jesus said Jesus heard a soul that was a cry when Jesus heard our soul cry that predestinated the SE that was a crying inside of the Legion then Jesus cross the sea that you claim that Legion why because of that Legion on the outside the devil might claim every bit of it because it's done wrong but inside of that Soul devil cannot claim that but the original owner Christ can claim that Christ doesn't claim that the body doesn't claim it is his mind but Christ are coming to claim the gene that laid inside of him man on the outside of there are so many things has it wrapped them up but when Christ come that inside of that soul of that Legion he recognize my masters is here my original owner is a here my legal owner is a here on the outside of the squatter of a demon has a squatting on the land but an inside of an inside that he know there was a something doesn't belongs to that then the inside was a cry out and Jesus heard that and he come for that Legion and that Legion brother BR said he wiggle through out of the the tomb he said those demon would by no means that will come to meet Jesus they were run but inside of there there's a gin of God living in there think about what a power that a lady in that Legion don't say how weak that is but what a power lady in that Legion thousands of a devil cannot hold him down thousands of a demons cannot hold that g down thousands of a depression cannot hold that g down thousands of a backside cannot hold that J now that je right can said there is my master coming there is a real legal owner over me coming Satan squatted on landine Satan deprived of my peace Satan deprived of my joy Satan deprived of everything that I rightly owned but now I know my master is to comeing and he is an original [Applause] owner even as his own Gene cannot overcome that but when he called on him man hasn't heard that a voice but that g inside of him heard that crying out and Jesus heard that voice and he are coming for that allegion let me share a little testimony here just about two months ago and we went to a Philippines and to have a cuz we can we can't have a meeting in China I cannot go back I think I probably told or you heard that because of the Distributing of the Bible that the brothers are from China there was a for of them that was arrested and they was sent to jail and the longest would for two years almost two years and then they were released but during the trial I was a look at a because that's during the covid time and during that time nobody uh be in person to go to the court so but the they have the live broadcast of uh when the trials of the pass of the sentence to the brothers so that the family has the passcode and they give me the passcal so I can log in and I look at the trial when the brothers was uh ready to sentence you know when I saw those brother I I thought that's the hero of the faith and they stand standing there their head was completely shaved with their prison closes on them they standing to the uh the uh whatever defense offense whatever that and one they senten so they ask him said uh any of you he said Do you have do you have uh do you have anything that you can say against your uh the fellow prisoner because if you can say anything or uh I don't have the right word if you can say anything against them or or give some a secret or whatever then you can beave a lesser a lesser sentence and those Brothers said nothing there's nothing I can see about my uh my people I wish I can have the right word for it and they WR to go to jail in you know not to betrayal their own fellow prisoner and when I when they having that when of the lawyer defending for them and the prosecutor from the government said we arrested this for because they disputing of the Bible doing the illegal things but he said that an the mean one we haven't C him yet catch him yet and he said his name is Murphy one is in Canada when I heard that I know okay I probably won't be able to go back any anymore but you know the Lord has a way to do things if it was that I'll be still going back to China try to work with the brother we do the mission works but during those four years of time during of the co of 2020 until last year we finished all the 1200 message and the in text and in out four years of a time I can really sit down and now we have a finished 1130 message in audio form and by God's grace next by February next month are we're going to finish all the audio translation I was thinking without that I this going to be prolong I don't know how many years but just in another a little less than four years of time actually less than two years of time we finished almost the 700 audio messages that's a one year and a half that's basically every day I need to record about a two message but if without that this cannot be done but because of that when you look at it back you saw the hands of a God all he need to do is just you yield yourself yield yourself Jesus has to said now the darkness has control he yield himself to The Darkness Be crucified on the cross then the resurrection can come your sin that it can be buried your uh your your sickness and your everything that he paid a price for it the darkness has it controled but God has had the great greatest Glory that ever and then so the brother said what we going to do I know just give me a five minutes I I'll try to write up and then just the brother said I'll come uh you know is there any way that we can meet because of my last trip there is 2018 and never being able to back sins and then the brother sister if possible these are any way that we can do this and then uh God put that in the brother Tom's heart he said brother Murphy have you ever thinking about the two go to Philippine and then just a few months later brother Vernon came from the Philippine then it came to our church then we asked if that's possible he said sure I'll arrange for it then the last year it will be the first time yeah actually it was the first time that it was a three brothers a brother Caleb a Brother David a brother R the all this pastor then the three of them they come to Philippine that we met at each other the first time and it was just marvelous that when we reunited together it was a very emotional time and then they asked if this year they said can we meet it again then I went to pray I said Lord though I miss them I have the emotionally tied with them but Lord I don't want to just base on emotional TI though as wonderful as it it it is but Lord unless this is the supernatural hand of a god leading I don't want to just go Philippine spend a thousand of dollars preach a few service and then meet to the brothers I said Lord never never be my be my goal or my that's in my heart I said Lord you have to show me and I prayed I prayed but I just lend to war to it you know did you have it come to the time you lend but you don't know what's going to happen so I I I just by by faith I said yes I I believe that's said Lord that that you leave me there so that the brothers they had a they they said brother Murphy there's a more people want to come this time and they they uh they calculated there was more than 50 60 I said no no no that's too dangerous I said I don't want that happen I said uh I said please uh limited a number so they actually they finally they only got about 18 young people that are from the different Church they're all coming over and uh you know you have to understand they have to spend the thousands of dollars and the buying a take care that they paid everything to the go there there are young people just like you they have a work in China there's no such a thing holiday holiday doesn't belongs to people holiday belongs to Americans they're just sorry they just work and work and work some people they have ask day off they said if you ask day off you don't have to come back you just go you're you're fired and they have to some people they have to do that but they said we want to do that you know when you want to pay the price you know we said God is a Jehovah jyra but do you know what is the Jehovah jar really mean Jehovah jarra means see when Jehovah see he's a Jehovah Gyra he's a Jehovah se but he must have see you move then he's a Jehovah Gyra he provides is a Jehovah when he saw Abraham and move then he become a Jehovah Gyra he provided the sacrifice I have the quotes for it but it was a Jehovah he has to see you you have to re willing to pay the price to put up the cause to make a move like that of the Legion he made out of that move they said if that's SP those demon that demon will by no means try to move it out but it's something inside of him he moved himself he crawling himself out of that tomb then Jesus claimed to him and those young people they came in it over and I when I saw them I just cannot help but cry cuz I know every one of them since they were a little baby but now they have grow up and some are 18 some are 20 it was in there a wonderful a young man and there was in there you know there was a one girl and uh his little one brother's uh daughter she uh uh she was in a terrible condition she was a in a severe depressed and uh for uh for five years in the last five years she was a genius top of students of the school but then that depression Spirit had get on her and he couldn't she couldn't get out of it and she uh she she related to me she said every time I walking passing a highrise I was watching just some thought in me which window is open so that I can jump it off every high rise she walking and finally two less than two years ago she committed suicide and she she he a whole bottle of depression drugs and then cut his her wrist right in the University but it just thank the Lord then they uh the students find her and they send her to the am ambulance's RightWay to the emergency and she was uh they they rescued her and they later she writed it to me she said brother Murphy she said when I come May rest rest I cried it out she said where is the god of Elijah if God is God where is God in my life she's a lovely girl born in a message R up in a message love the Lord you can't find any any good person L her but she needed experience that the devil just take her down take her down take her down and she come to a point she want to ended her life but then she cried out where is the god of Elijah he said I know Elijah he said brother Murphy I consider you as an man of a God but where is the god of Elijah where is the god of you that is in me where where is he I was thinking oh Lord what can I do what can you do brother Craig we can't do nothing and I said Lord the only thing I can do is to pray for her and her father is a minister was pray for her but nothing getting better she's just getting she's a after that she tried to commit a multiple suicide and they have to let her out of the school take her home watching her they at night don't let her everywhere she go they're watching her because they don't know what is the next step she going to do and she said I'm coming to Philippine this time and so she came in it over as we look at her she was walking out of the uh the the airport and there's a there's a one sister coming from our church she look at her she said is she got a depression I said yeah and then brother Michel we're talking she said you don't even need to tell brother Michael Ray brother Tom son you don't need even to tell me that his that Depression was right all over her and then she was there she just bow lower her head Never Smile never talk not a not a word no social with anybody and while we're walking into the hotel and she was pulling my cold she said brother Murphy can I get a time with you I said sure I said I want to spend some time with you I said we have a meetings here was meeting after meeting I said can we just wait a but and then after a few hours she coming over ping my coat I said Murphy can I can I just see you for a few minutes I said I I would love to but then those was all things has happen to you know be wisit of the people that the counseling and we have the meeting coming and she was just persistent she was just holding my cold she said can I just see you for a few minutes I said sister way wa just wait I said I want you to hear the word and the after of the service I'll spend the time with you and she said okay and so then we have the meeting and while we're having while we're having another meeting and as the word was as a preaching and I was wonder if that word would do anything to that little young girl and I saw that the word has been moving and the Lord has been moving there was the people start to coming up there was a people that they just coming to the altar give their heart to the Lord and as a change to the person I just wondering what Lord where is the god of Elijah for that young girl and after the service is over and I was uh just uh coming back to the from of the pulpit and standing on the uh there and that the pastor already dismissed of the service and I as dismissed but something just in my heart I said Lord I don't feel this is over I don't feel this is over I was standing there and it was kind of awkward because of the pastor asked if we can go out just having a dinner together and and I just I just stand there I I did a move and while I was standing there I was just praying then there was a young man coming for us and as a young man said to brother Murphy I don't know why but something I almost feel like something lifted in my he said I'm not a spiritual person brother Murphy but something just almost feel lifted me up let me coming to to the front he said I want you I want you to pray for me I don't even know what you want what the Lord want you to pray for me and that young man was married just uh got married and I prayed to prayed to WID him and wisdom of the brothers and then later he said I want to uh we want to have a child and by God's grace and just one month ago and his wife who found a pregnant and then this is not only just the beginning and then one after another people start to coming all those are Chinese young people they coming from China sometime I wonder why God has to let people spend thousands of the dollars let people to go to their prisons do this and that but you know just for one person maybe and then I saw this young girl wew she came forth with a solemn face teared in his eye and as she coming up she said brother Murphy I said I believe the word has spoke to me but can you can you pray for me I said may you want to be delivered I said yes I said wait wait the god of Elijah is right here you have a right desire you don't want just Elijah you wanted the god of Elijah I said a way I believer right here you can meet him it was a quiet there's uh no music because the musician all left everyone is already left just a whole group of the Chinese young people over there and I lay hands whisper a m and a different one we lay hands on on her is not lightning no thundering sometime I even thinking Lord is that it is that it I know she uh shed the tears as she cried but I said Lord I I wish she can pounding at altar just something confirmed that she's been changed nothing that's the time you look and live that's the time you be certain over God that's right when you turn over every stone when he still doesn't speak right that's the time you be certain of God you look and live and commit it to the hand of the lord lord I believe the god of Elijah is here and I said that the god of Elijah is here and I know God of Elijah is here not because I failed it but I know he's here because he promised that two or three that get in his name when the word was preached when I know that's the word of God and I know you're going to M and we let her go and then afterward everybody is dismissed and uh while we're fellowshipping I just turned around I look at I saw her she pulled up with some of candy she give it out to the children and she started sitting down with the children started talking with the children and then after she talked with the children you know if the person was depressed the children don't get along there don't get around them because they want to make everybody depressed and the children but the children they were talking she was talking with them giving them a candy and after a little while she get her the person she never talked all those 18 young people she never talk a word to any of them not even her her mom and dad and she started talking with those young people and then she started sharing her own testimony she never shared it before if she never shared it I wouldn't share this with you she talking about the how the the demon tried to let her depressed and the uh committed suicide she said but the Lord delivered me and she was a sharing with every oldest of the young people and she was praising the Lord raiseed up her hand give a god a Grace give a god a praise I said that girl changed in a moment of I love and live when you look she live when she look she lived and then she was a happy she was a smiling first time all this year I saw her smile her dad and watch her in the Maze doesn't know what's happened to my girl and then they went back to the little not a motel but like Airbnb that in a in a in a in a uh was a room it was a little house there was a C yard yard in there and they all went back she's still talking she's still witnessing she's still talking how the Lord had do the wonderful things to her and while she they were talking she was just in the courtyard there she was talking with a little one sister or two sister then before we know everybody started coming out and all those young people and The Wizard a brother wizard dead they're all coming out and made a circle just hearing this a young girl tting about what a marvelous God that we serve and then this time Storm come you know how tropical storm in Manila just so I could hear way worse than here the lightning started flashing the Thunder started roaring and the the r started dropping they can hear the rain I I was in an other Hotel the r started pouring and I saw then then they said that the r started dropping on the Shing goes just as the r started to pouring down but you know what not one drop of rain that in that little circle that is 10 15 people which is gathering there God determined nobody going to disturb that his daughter to share about how God delivered a person Satan can claim her mind Satan can claim her body but Satan couldn't claim her soul Satan claimed the legion but Satan couldn't claim the Gin that laid inside of that soul that in the religion but God can claim God claim that little girl that has been depressed for 5 years and you know what this girl after that she's uh helping us with the translation she helping with about a 50 some of message that has been translated what a marvelous God that we serve Satan looks like a very powerful but our God is way more powerful look and live look and live yes my brother my sister just look and live you know God don't required us to do a lot of things but he required us to give us everything to him you know just before they came I was a look at at a scripture talking about the the reown ruler I look at a I look at that I thought what a Pity what a Pity that Rich Young Ruler he's a rich and he's a young and he's a ruler and he's not something corruptible person even Jesus look at him the Bible said that Jesus love him brother BR said that the young man had the right approach he run to Jesus he's not a deor he's not just uh whatever come or whatever goes he run to Jesus he kneel down he said a master good Master what can I do to inherit eternal life he got a everything and that a mom and dad probably can you're really Desiring for but he still doesn't possess of eternal life and he finds that the right object the right one that he can ask for he had a right attitude towards the Eternal Word and that hour he done everything right not one thing he did it wrong everything he done is all right and Jesus even love him even when he died later on going to hell he still held his testimony in hell he didn't say where my riches go in hell he didn't said that where my treasure all gone in hell he look it up but it's not to look and live in hell he's still looking it up and so Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham said go get some water touch my tongue and he in hell he even testified said go to my loved one I have a five brothers let them don't come over here if one resurrected from Death he know about a resurrection if a one resurrected from the death go to them they will know what a character in hell he still had a testimony in Hell he's not thinking of himself he's thinking about his own Brothers he's thinking about his loved ones but he's facing the eternal life but he rejected Jesus said you only need one thing Brothers if Jesus tell us Murphy you only need to do one thing I will say Lord not one thing give me two thing three milon whatever but the Lord said to him you only need to do one thing if anyone of here if the Lord coming here ask you I only need you to do one thing you will be run to do it no matter what if I have to use my noses to push on the floor and to get the the the coin push it over there I will do it just one thing think about it just do one thing you can get eternal life but that one thing is everything that one thing is everything he couldn't do it he's not able to do it he didn't reject it orally he just turned around sadly he never rejected a message he never rejected a message by saying it but by not receiving it he rejected it but then when I read further on I thought what a pity for that reach Young Ruler if he can just stay though he cannot do it but if he can just St say just for a few moment because right after that Jesus said it's so hard for a rich man to enter into heaven it's so hard it's a harder is the camel go through the eyes of a needle is uh is easier for the rich man then go to heaven and we know what the eyes of an needle is right that the camel has to go through the gates CA the eyes of a needle they have to unload and then the camel can go through still can doable can go to it just you have to unload so to get in but Jesus said it's so hard but if that young man can wait a little bit more later Jesus said just in that the same chapter and Peter said Lord we have forsaking all have a follow to you and then Jesus then G they said Peter said he said Lord now who can be saved who can go you know what Jesus said to man is impossible but to God all things are possible I wish I was that a young man that reach your own ruler if he can just wait for a few seconds he will hear Jesus said to man is impossible but to God all things are possible then if I would be to the young man I would say Lord I couldn't do it I couldn't give it up but you said to man is impossible but to God all things are possible I believe you Lord Lord you take that desire away from me you take that pornography out of me you take that lust out of me you take that condemnation out of me you take that depression out of me I couldn't do it but to man that's impossible but to God all things are [Applause] possible because of just a two chapter before that there was a father with a son got epy and couldn't got delivered the disciples couldn't cast The Demon out of him thy father take the son one to Jesus Jesus said Lord if you can do anything please do something it's not said to Lord I believe you Lord you are marvelous I have a 100% Faith toward you he said Lord if there's anything you can do your disciple failed but Lord is there anything that you can do Jesus said if you can believe if you can believe all things are possible you know what that father said that father doesn't have a 100% pure face that father said I believe but help thou my unbelief I still have unbelief in me Lord I'm not trying to be hypocrite toward you I still am not what I ought to be I still the things that are in my life I feel shamed about it I couldn't do it myself but Lord you said all things are possible to man that's impossible but to God all things are possible Lord I do believe but Lord my face just not reached up to there but Lord help my unbelief Jesus never give him an education Jesus never turn around and said you go to read a read a Seal's books again go to go to the the church to hear the preaching Jesus turn around and they cast a demon out of that man that of is his son to man that's impossible but to God all things are possible what a marvelous God that we serve if it required us let a musician come if just it required us I we probably like that of reach Young Ruler said how can we do this that's impossible for me to do but I'm so glad we hear that the word said to man is impossible but to God all things are possible and when when that a father did that Jesus turned around and casted a demon out of his son I was thinking of how God has a cast out a demon of Oppression depression from the young girl you know he so like that Elijah he asked get the servant is said to go up is said to to look at it the see where the cloud going to come where the rain going to come he said I heard the r songs of an abundant R though it looks like they just the size of a men's hand of a cloud that are coming out of him sea but Elijah saw difference he saw the r is coming I think this is a Time before it us to look at it well we all we have always been looking but we don't need to the changer look just to look straight to what the word of God has said Lord if you ever say so I believe it one time two times three times four times keep on looking the things that we always look what God has a Vindicated as a proof to be the truth if you keep on looking it and God will make sure that size of a man's hand of a cloud would become a two hands of a cloud the brother Bram said will be a three size three hands of a cloud and before we know it it will be the head of a cloud and they are coming on you like the head of a cloud on Arizona so you have been Justified the Judgment has to pass the sin has been judged the blood has to cleanse to you your has has to come you as the body is a United with hasip we're not what we ought to be we're not what we were but we are what God has ordained us to be in this hour you are the Bride of Jesus Christ that the head
