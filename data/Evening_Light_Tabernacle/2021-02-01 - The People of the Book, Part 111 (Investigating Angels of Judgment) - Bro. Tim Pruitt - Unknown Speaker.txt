drove driven through maybe a lot of you have driven through we're usually the in between between here and and the mountains of colorado so anybody who's ever been to colorado usually comes through our area usually can tell that it's dry it's always dry and so we had a project that we were wanting to help out this weekend and and i kept hearing the situation of we need to pray that it doesn't rain and i'm sitting there we're praying for rain where i come from how in the world is praying for no rain and but we kind of knew that the circumstances were were there we're going to do consider the circumstances were there that we needed to get something done and i just kept hearing these testimonies of people just we're just praying that the rain hold off and rain hold off and we just kept seeing you know still supposed to happen and and then we got here and uh we got the job completed and literally probably within i don't know bro timothy which stayed 30 minutes after everything was done and started to rain and i just said wow lord you just the smallest little details he cares about for each and every one of us and and maybe you're here this morning and you know maybe you're going through a struggle and you think he doesn't care about my little details he cares about your little details that's the god that i serve you ever just had went through a circumstance god doesn't care i'm just a little nobody he cares about you the bible says that he cares about you he loves you and and this song is an old one that you you know and you can sing it i just bear with us but it's it's considered the lilies and it just this is my testimony from what god has done hallelujah let's try consider the lilies [Music] [Applause] with more splendor they don't plant war souls but they're fed by the master who watches them grow and we have a heavenly father above with eyes full of mercy and a heart full of love here it is i know that he really cares when [Music] [Laughter] and then you

that my uh father-in-law used to sing and we're singing a lot at home and maybe even sing in here it's uh it's one of those songs where you know in our humanity we have to understand that we need we need god right now more than anything else no matter how much religion you have or how much you claim to be in this message without jesus it's nothing without love there's nothing and this song has always been a from my childhood has always meant so much to me because it's a pouring out of i need to get rid of myself and god i need you more than anything else and so hopefully maybe it'll

ones who trusted in his grace long for jesus christ my king to come and take me to my home beyond the skies [Music] he whispers loving words to me and tells me to be strong that he will always lead and die and i'm longing for jesus i long for jesus christ my king to come and take me to that holy my fears my toes my tears to come and take me to my home beyond the skies [Music] hallelujah what a day that'll be we're looking forward to that with all with a great anticipation and especially as the days grow longer and we get closer to the times of the tribulation that is headed up on the earth and we can feel the winds already blowing as it begins to move across the earth and things are changing the climates are changing in in in spiritual life and home life and political life in nations things are happening we are here in a time of fulfillment of great prophecy let us prepare our hearts to meet the lord amen to be a part of that great coming here in this last day where he comes and he descends from heaven with a shout with a message with the voice of an archangel someone takes the book and eat it and becomes one with that voice amen that they speak the word of god in this end time finally for the great trump to sound and all the dead in christ arise we're looking forward to that it ought to be our anticipation what we we long for in our heart we're going to be talking about some of those things this morning amen god bless you luke chapter 17 verse 28 is where we'll begin reading from good to have each one of you with us today and pray the lord special blessings upon you all luke chapter 17 verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same way the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed notice this is not just the coming of the son of man but the revealing of the son of man when the word is revealed there's also going to be a uh uh an exposing or revealing of the of the man of sin and his works and what he's done down to the ages is in the white horse red horse pale and a black and pale as as it the antichrist writes and an exposing of him at the same time at the revealing of the son of man so the man of sin is revealed and the son of man is revealed now genesis 18 verse 20. genesis 18 verse 20 and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know amen may god bless you you can be seated we're going to be speaking today on the investigating angels of judgment because we are in a time of investigating investigation judgment where angels investigate and discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart this would be something we saw through the prophetic ministry of brother william branham as over and over again time after time without fail that um the hearts were discerned our sins were exposed and um things were were brought to light um because of the discerning of the angel as it says you know i will go down now and see whether they have done according to the cry of it so god is actually doing an investigation in this last day and then a judgment follows that investigation now as you know the holy ghost um dispensation came in and will continue on by the administration of angels to the church uh they're ordained spirits of god they're sent from god to carry out god's orders his plan and and of course um every man to you know who had a special calling back to the ages um angels visited them and uh in the last age as it was in the days of sodom the bible said when the son of man is revealed there is again to be angelic visitations and one thing that they are looking for is to find faith so there are things that as investigate and separate remember the last day is a separation where the angels go forth and separate because um they separate the terror from the wheat and and um and some are some are put in one classification by the angels and summoned another and then we we have a viewed in the book of genesis and as we have been uh speaking about this in genesis 18 were three messengers one was god himself came to abraham and they're described as men but when the two of them appeared at the gate of sodom genesis 19 1 says of them and there came two angels to sodom at evening and lot sat at the gate of sodom now so if you'll see this just for a moment they come and they appeared as men but they were angels now you know again um yet that um as we as we see they went all angels but actually one was a self manifestation of elohim himself so there are specific anointings that will anoint people in the last day there will be those of the abraham group they will be visited by elohim himself if you'll see this in genesis um 18 22 when the men turned their faces from them and went towards sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord so two of them were angels went down to sodom while the the man which was the lord stood before abraham and this is the one that would discern sarah's heart he was coming to and looking for faith now as we as we know the phenomena was being done this was a a miraculous event this was a time where the pillar of fire the the light the logos of of god the pre-incarnate christ came down in abraham's day and he would touch the soil and gather the necessary elements to make a body for himself and two angels and they stepped into them now i want you to i want you just to visualize they come from light they came from the light and stepped into this dimension and when they stepped into this dimension they touched soil and as they touched soil they drew from that the elements to make a human body and appear now as men before abraham amen now that shouldn't be too hard for you to grasp if you got the holy ghost that yes because the the pillar of fire the holy ghost hovered over your soil one day and a portion of that holy spirit came in your life amen so when when abraham and sarah are standing before the lord it is at that time that sarah now is investigated and and her heart is discerned and it is found that she is lacking faith now now again because this is what he will do when he comes he will investigate or look to find faith that's the number one thing that he's one to he wants a bride a church that believes him are you with me that believes his word above theologians above our denominational ideas that exalts the bible over the trends of the day are you with me they take the word of god and they believe that word with all of their heart they stick their lives on it amen and so again again this is what jesus said when well you know will i find faith in my investigation when i come so if you're turning you'll see he spake a parable to them and to this end that men ought to always pray and not to faint now he gives us this to teach us don't quit praying and don't give up on a promise if you're wanting a promise from god if there's something that you need from god don't give up if you're seeking the holy ghost don't quit amen if you're seeking healing keep pounding at the door keep knocking keep on seeking and then keep them asking if your children are lost don't give up on them you keep on knocking you keep on believing you got somebody sick in your family in the church or whatever you don't give up on a promise so he tells us i'm saying that there was a in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man there was a widow in that city and she came unto him say it offends me of mine enemies or my adversary and he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard men yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the lord said hear what the unjust judge said shall not god avenge his own elect which cried day and night into him though he bear along with them i tell you he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith he is going to be looking for faith listen if he says shall i find faith this is what he's looking for he is investigating hearts to find somebody that will believe him somebody that'll give the word preeminence now this translation says it this way then the master said do you hear what the judge corrupt as he is is saying so what makes you think god won't step in and work justice for his chosen people who continue to cry out for help won't he stick up for them i assure you he will he will not drag his feet but how much of that kind of persistent faith will the son of man find on the earth when he returns persistent faith not easy believism persistent faith people who won't quit amen people who won't give up to people who will not let go of the promise but they're going to see it manifested in their lives are you with me amen now as i have been through things in the past and i want to just bring it out again to you again today god will do extreme things to get you to believe amen this angel is real and he'll go out to all out to get a people believing hallelujah i believe that as um as as it was with brother branham visited south africa and i and i'm just going to show you the the how god will go out all out to do things there was a couple of brothers that were talking they were uh they were dutch reform ministers and and um and they were um they were there in south africa and they they were arguing with one another about the meetings and and um one was one was calling the you know brother branham he's just a spiritualist and he's nothing but a spiritualist and the other man um was was on the on the other side of the argument he was saying no this is our day of visitation and we sit here and you should hear this and and and so he said well he ain't nothing but a spiritualist and he said well did you ever see a spiritualist heal the sick he said no he said well i'll tell you what you know you're you're such a in a sinful unbelieving condition i'll just go out and pray for your lost soul and he got down in the backyard and knelt down under a tree and began to pray and say god had mercy on my friend's soul and when he did down before him came the angel of the lord in a whirl and as it moved this angel came and laid his hand on his shoulder and told him to return back to his friend and there when when he when he got together with his friend and and there and he told him about the angel's visitation and that this was their day of visitation then the then the the man looked and on the man on his back where the angel had touched him was the scorch print of the angel's hand laying on his shirt that's what i'm saying god will do some extreme things sometimes to get us to believe god's going to have somebody in this day who will believe him amen are you with me amen he'll do whatever he has to do to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers if he asked her and he did raise up a prophet in the spirit and the power of elias amen now he wasn't elijah but he was in the spirit of elijah which was the anointing of christ upon him for a prophetic work are you with me and man god does some things very very drastic sometimes just like what happened in the meetings there in fort wayne indiana where a lady was playing on the piano the great position now is near the sympathizing jesus as the prayer line was going through and they handed brother branham a hideously crippled up twisted up child who's had club feet and and limbs were twisted and brother branham stood and held clutched that child to his bosom and began to pray over that child and as he did there was a bright light that got shown on him and he actually in his human thoughts said this is very rude you know for the custodian to turn a light on like that from on me and blind me like this and then and he opened his eyes to see um the light and it was the pillar of fire that was hanging over him and he was he was so um it was so shocked there in that moment he dropped the child and the child took off and running his limbs untwisted and ran across the platform and this little girl i don't know what religion she was she was protestant of some sort but she was sitting there playing the piano and as she watched that child run across the platform she chipped up and began to lift her hands and began to dance in the spirit over the over the platform and the piano never missed a beat continually playing the great physician now is near the sympathizing jesus what is it god doing everything he can to let you know i am the god present for you in your situation i am the sympathizing jesus i'm the great physician remember that there's nothing too hard for the lord no matter how twisted up how crippled how the how deformed that you are this god nothing's too hard for him in one moment he can change your life [Applause] forever it was these things that brought us to the realization and the recognition of the unseen world that we were blinded to because of sin amen we were born in sin shape and iniquity because of that we were we we were lacking that vision or that ability to see that realm of angels that unseen realm of the realm of angels that unseen realm of the power of god now and so but god was wanting to bring to us the reality of the unseen world even to the point that brother branham would be told by the angel you know that your thoughts are louder in heaven than your words are on earth so then that god knows every thought he hears every prayer this is why so often you know i saw you you were there you were sitting on the sofa you were looking out the window and as you there you were praying oh god somehow if i could get in that prayer line and would repeat back the prayers that they had because god heard those prayers god was wanting you to know he's a personal god and that you are receiving a visitation this is the day of his visitation we're living in that time now you know it was in 1946 and we have been through this before but just to remind you again um 1946 where that in the meetings of brother branham's there where um it it prophecy rang out twice that year once in san antonio and another in another place where tongues and interpretation went forth and it was a stern message that was given and both of them were almost identical and they were given a a testimony of the authenticity of this of the ministry of brother branham and it was uttered with such a rousing force they said that it just seemed unearthly this is way that they described it and yet this was the the message as john the baptist was sent to war on the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of christ you see it was things like that again that this would be echoed again as i said in tulsa oklahoma by by sister anna schrader not neither none of these had heard of that none of them had heard of the light coming down and speaking and saying as john the baptist was set to forerun the first coming of christ as brother branham was baptizing in on the ohio river in 1933 none of them had heard of this but now god was even speaking through the pentecostal people amen to rouse them to stir them to make them realize you know god was doing some very extreme things amen we could testify of t.o osborne who would say the same that he said i didn't know the voice had spoke these words i knew nothing of that i had not been with any of the other ministers that believed in in him but because most that i was with did not believe in him with in him but like a voice yet not a voice i heard it it came to me as john the baptist was sent as a force a writer of his first coming william branham is a forerunner of his second coming amen now how can we be accused of making brother branham elijah are calling him elijah when if he went forth into power like john the baptist who went forth in the spirit and the power of elijah they themselves had to testify you see god was doing things that was phenomenal i i've been through it where you would take a a a young boy little david walker and and call him out in a ministry and give him a supernatural ministry it was an era of time where god was preparing hearts and been trying again one more time i want to get it to you not just to heal the sick and god show his power but for him to be able to restore a faith in a faithless older woman the church like who had given up on the promise are you with me who were who was no longer truly expecting the coming of the lord and i'll tell you if there was ever a people that was under anticipation for the coming of the lord it is our generation because god has done phenomenal extraordinary extreme things to get us on of course so we would believe just one more i would mention john jack coe's faith how it was anointed and man you know jack cole was an assembly of god preacher he's just doing his own little evangelistic work and you know he hear him talking he said you know we kind of figured if it wasn't us it wasn't nobody so he said but he began to hear of these phenomenal things and decided to go to the meeting and and uh and he said i sat there as a skeptic you know i i as brother branham looked at a man who was blind with no eyeballs and and he told him in three days eyeballs will form and after that you'll see and then jack scoff said you know anybody can say that you know this man had disappeared out in the crowd and he's a big thousands of people there and you know we'll never see him again how will we know he ever gets eyesight and so as he sat there and brother branham starts to leave the platform at the end of the service he walks by jack cole and he pats him on the leg and and he says um or on the knees said you're not sick you're just worn down from preaching meetings said don't be skeptical you were doubting whether this is a god and whatnot i want to tell you this is of god we're both fighting the same devil go and continue in your revival for you also we're called to pray for the sick and on the third day jack went back to the meeting because he wanted to check out this man and he found this man and by that time eyeballs had formed in his eyes but he still couldn't see but by evening he was seeing and he was shouting all over the place but the glories of god and even jack would have to admit and no he said william branham was born for dispensational purposes amen and i'm gonna just tell you and remind you we cannot afford to go to sleep in this hour amen god has spoken out particularly for your day and your hour to awaken your faith amen god's doing extreme things to let you know that you are in the cycle in the very hour of his coming amen then how can we just sit complacent amen how can you treat these moments just like they were another moment in time this is not just another moment in time this is where god's doing extreme things moving in extreme ways [Music] i just want to say to you how can you dare let the devil destroy your home and your marriage how do you dare how dare you to just go up down television and movies and and worship sports gods and spends hours in pornography or playing useless video games that steal your time when we were told to redeem the time the day is evil how can you just settle down as complacent as though this is just another hagar move where another denominational move just produce another wild child and you know everything go back to normal sarah's never going to receive that promise on the whole jesus is not coming back not in our generation and i ask you could god have made a mistake this god who time after time showed how accurate his word could be could it be that this age could get so faithless the time so evil that laodicea would get so bad and even the majority of the aids would put him outside the church and god then would simply just have to give up on his divine plans and go back in the heavens and forget it all and just become the absentee creator of the earth could it be that god made a mistake saying this was his forerunner of his second coming i'm just going to say there is no mistake in the word god sent a forerunner to prepare hearts for the coming of the lord and it must prepare your heart amen you must be one that opens your heart to it and say god prepare me and as a church body we ought to be ones who open our hearts and say god prepare this church for the coming of jesus christ remember he said i will return to you according to the time of life you know yesterday i listened to the first 10 chapters of luke like today like we are in this age an angel came but this angel's name was gabriel and he came to zechariah and they told him he was to have a son and when he was told this he immediately doubted and questioned the angel are you with me amen and he was struck dumb until the the baby was born i'm going to tell you god doesn't like it when we disbelieve amen and i i and i just said god shut my mouth keep me from sin and uttered any unbelief whatever lord i i don't want to be a a part of a faithless generation amen now he would he would command him said now you're going to bring forth a son and he is never to take wine or other form fermented drink well i couldn't help but think of the last day forerunner who like john the baptist was told by a voice in a whirlwind and a tree at seven years old never drink or smoke or defile your body in any way for i have a work for you to do when you're older amen what a messenger that god would prepare him in such a way that he wouldn't be educated by men he didn't even come with a high school education let alone a degree from a university and why is why do you think that's so great brother tim why do you exalt that thought how come you don't like to rest the world look down on it this man had poor grammar and this man was uneducated and this man because this man instead of being dependent on his learning from the from the university from from the religious theology amen he had to be dependent upon the angel for his knowledge that's why that's why that even his advice shouldn't be discounted amen even some of the inside you said well that was his opinion i'll tell you when you realize a man's opinion many times is based on a spiritual revelation so then you've got to be really careful about how you discount things that are said are you with me and i couldn't help but think of mary where uh where an angel came to her the angel gabriel looking for a virgin remember he was looking for a virgin and and one that would believe in the creation of god that she could have a child by creation without knowing a man now i'm going to tell you this was even more difficult than what that what uh sarah had to believe sarah had to believe that she's 90 years old could give birth to a child amen but this woman had to believe that she would have a child without even knowing a man and god in this day is looking for a virtuous people a virgin people not polluted by men's ideas amen who will who can believe that god will actually bring back and fulfill his word and that there will be a change of the body there will be a meeting in the air there will be a rapture for a church and it's going to happen with angels appearing not only an angel but your angel your theophany appearing to you it's going to happen to people who are familiar with the pillar of fire with that holy light of god moving down among them that knows their hearts that knows their thoughts that knows whether or not they're got faith or not now it's the investigating judgment once again where the angel is seeking out someone who is a virgin not a part of the whole horror system unpolluted by the seed of an and theology of man but a woman a bride who will bring forth children of the word and finally bring forth christ back to the earth again now so god does some extreme things to get you to believe amen to and he it goes extreme to give us examples of what god will do in the end time he would take sarah now who is past 90 he would wait until she has passed 90. why not do this when she's a young girl i'll give you a child you're going to have a child and his name is isaac and why not give it to him when she's a young lady and a full spring in her step and she can i have many many years with this boy and and everything anyway she waits god waits till she's impossible god waits till she's 90. and she's shall bury now why does he do that again it's a prophecy it's speaking of the last day where he would demonstrate to us his power once again and he's chosen in the type with sarah that and he and he wants us to understand that there is nothing too hard for the lord now sarah of course didn't have the faith but that's why he came because he's got to have faith now let me explain something to you god said i'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish he says there will be a rapture amen now if there's a people unprepared for it that don't change what he's saying he's still going to have rapture and his glove was still going to have a people without spot or wrinkle or blemish he will take a he will have a bride that that is a spotless bride who will be united to him and if there isn't one he'll create one he'll bring a message his own word and create a bride a people for his namesake are you with me because again he's showing us there is nothing too hard for the lord but you're in laodicea brother tim you're in the last day where the rich increased with goods and have needed nothing and are wretched and miserable blind and poor and naked and self-centered on their own a religious way yet religious people and going about their way and it's going to be impossible but is there anything too hard for the lord now when he comes and he doesn't find the faith then he brings a visitation in order to give that faith that means that's why the angel's always shaking you move away from that unbelief move into god i want to i want to increase your faith i want to raise it up another level amen this is what brother branham would do many times with his gift he said now the gift doesn't heal it just raises your faith to a higher level so you can receive the promise and that's what god would have to do in this last day he would have to raise the faith of a people into a rapturing faith somebody with me now this of course nothing would happen until sarah quit looking at herself and she kept looking you know there there again it's a secret to sickness that you're you look at the sickness you see how bad it is how bad of i am or how how you know this is something i could never get over nobody's ever had a case like mine or is it you know i'll never get well i've had this 15 years or i've done this and i've done that and i've tried this and i've tried that you know as long as you're looking at yourself but here in hebrews 11 11 it gives us a key sarah herself received strength to concede seed and was delivered of a child when she was past 8 when she judged him faithful who had promised now she could look back at herself and see where she had been faithful to believe come on but now she got her eyes over herself and that she's 90 and how impossible it is come on hey man where she even laughed within herself and kind of you know you know mocked at me an old woman you don't have pleasure does this man not know how old i am you know i'm past 90 and i have pleasure with my lord and he's old also amen but when she turned from her problem and look to him and judge him faithful hey man you know sometimes you get to look at faults and you can look at situations you can look at your own shortcomings and how will god ever get a bride out of this mess well if you can turn your eyes off of the trouble around you and i'll be leo to see you and the world around you and put your eyes back on jesus amen and realize there is nothing that is too hard for the lord and he'll do everything he can to get me believing will i find faith is his question if he's finding he's investigating looking for faith betty daughtery she was one of the first healed in the early campaigns brother branham went to brother daughery's church it's a it was a long story but they thought at the time she had saint vitus dance doctors had given up on her didn't know what it was and finally come down to brother branham had a vision and in that vision he would see her a little a little child some couple of years before and she was playing around an old cellar and she tripped and fell hit her back on a stone and knocked a vertebrae way out of condition in her back and and he he he was told just take there and and and as he they prayed he just pressed down on that spot and it went right take there and and and as he they prayed he just pressed down on that spot and it went right down the spine went right back into place again and the child was healed and this is one of the very first things where the visions were were being manifested now but sometimes later when she is now a young woman she again has got a some sort of affliction i don't know what it is is something else but when she comes in the prayer line and and as i was with moses and he says he says to her betty he said you've grown up in your beautiful girl and he says but now is there anything down in your life that you've failed betty now just as a doctor would look over your physical body i want to look through your soul have you failed god anywhere betty if there is just acknowledge it to him lord if you'll let me go over it again i'll do different all right think of that now here again she she is now an older girl now she's at the age pass the age of accountability now she's a young adult and she's done something and she pulls him he pulls brother branham aside and whispers something in his ears and they have prayer together but you see again i want to get it as a doctor he said would look on your physical body i will look down into your soul have you failed god anywhere now that pillar of fire still has that same ability to look right down into the very soul of a man or a woman and discern the very thoughts and the intents that the intentions of the and that same angel of god has ways to speak and convict and to convince you of sin and especially if you have the holy ghost because that's one of the signs of the indwelling spirit he will convict you of sin and i'll just say if you can sin and just get on by with it you're missing something very important in your life look down into the soul not just see you know that's this is the way the judgment is going to be the great white throne judgment now maybe i'm carnal but this is the way i view it this way i mean it'll be eternally eternity sometimes you know wouldn't it be neat just to sit back for for for a time where there's no time but for um this opportunity to start back with god as he and maybe some of it he would fast forward it to bring it down to the millions of years as it moves from the invisible god to a visible form of the logos and lugos to begin to do his work and brood over the earth and bring up the creation and move along like that and then finally it's going to come down to your time and some of you we will see this very service play back again and we will see what you did with the word this time what was done in secret will be shouted from the housetop this time not just your not just your actions will be there but your motive what was really in your heart will be displayed and it'll be displaced for the whole world and you'll see yourself walk right back into the church again and replay scene after scene actually i'm telling you you let me tell you i will not have to judge you and condemn you to hell god will not have to do it your own sins because god would show us through this prophet that everything is recorded he would go back 40 years in life and say look i saw it it was a black dog he got after you he scared you ever since this you've been this way you barely made it into the house the screen door just slammed behind you and this and it scared you it's a scare and it started a complex in your life it's all recorded so it's one great video but it contains more than what we see now it contains your thoughts your intentions that's what the judgment's going to be you your own actions will the bible say they'll be judged for the by the deeds done in their body amen now that's that's going to be serious and i'll tell you how serious it is brother brandon said let my belly be cut open and let sulfur be burned in it he said but don't let me stand is that white throwing judgment now let me stop a minute let's talk about that just a second because it started when you were a little baby and it goes right on recording recording recording to the end of your life but i'm telling you for a believer there will be none of those acts there will be none of those sins there will be none of that to condemn you because the blood of christ will have been applied to your video and the only thing will be seen is your righteousness that's the only thing that has stopped that voice is the blood of jesus christ now you say brother tim that's sober and yeah it's going to be in like huge now you know just take right of here we got it wrote i will fear no evil for you are with me but what if that contained your thoughts of this past week you would feel very exposed to the psalms 23 4 joe adams you feel exposed that's where it's going to be at the judgment you will be totally exposed what is done in secret be shouted from the house up and there's only one thing that will cleanse the record well i'm glad to say the old account was settled long ago hallelujah i've been plunged in the blood and i'm gonna just tell you even and there it won't even be a blip won't even come to a spot and there's a blimp oh there was something done there but we don't know what it was it was covered no there won't be a flip that won't be a spread of it you'll say he's staggered now at the promise of god who was strong in faith giving praise to god will i find faith investigating judgment i'm taking too long on some of this i've got a long ways to go you know he said these gifts are only to show you what god's attitude toward the people to get you people back to believe in god because if you haven't got faith enough to believe for your sick body how are you going to have faith enough for a rapture he says jesus asked this question when i return to earth well i find faith there's got to be a great church full of faith and god sent these things down to stimulate faith to bring out faith to prove what faith is and so this is why god would do what he's done in our generation not just to show his power but he wanted to get you believing now again would he find faith knowing that that would be one thing that people would lay on or let go on hearing the also the holy spirit speak in these last days how these times would come men would have a form of godliness but deny the power lack of faith and we thank thee lord tonight because that in our hearts we feel we have just a little faith and help us lord that our faith might be increased tonight until it be so high so lost and complete to surrendered in christ until great until it be so high so lost and complete surrendered in christ until great and mighty works will be shown tonight forgive us of our shortcomings now and help us may the holy spirit just now the great officer of god here in the earth searching out for a pride for the lord jesus may he visit every heart here in a special way what the great officer of the holy spirit again i truly believe before the church can have a rapture it's got to have rapture in faith we cannot even have faith for divine healing let alone rapture in faith god have a faith in a change and quicken this body and be taken away i believe there's a church on its road tonight a power of the living god that men will speak the word here and there and in a flashlight lightning and the church is coming out not a psychologist not someone who's put on or make-believe but a real genuine anointed holy ghost called out church abraham and lot are shown in the wise and the foolish virgins there comes a separation time for a while they're gathered together for a while abraham and lot will walk together but there comes a time of separation one of them sanctified having a profession if you look with me um in second peter two and six you'll see this scripture and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow and making them an example into those that actors should live ungodly and deliver just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them and seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds amen so you see he was a sanctified man a lot of sanctified he types the church who goes to the tribulation he was a man lacking the holy spirit but yet he was righteous it was something you know that he was inside him but invest him oh there's many of righteous people out there good sanctified wonderful people are you with me amen who today will wind up in the tribulation period who'll miss the rapture because lot never had the faith of abraham come on somebody amen he didn't stay with the promise but he drifted from it though he was a righteous man and though it vex him oh i tell you what how many people are through america today that are vexed at the sins that are being done you know that are troubled with with the way that our government is going and and running over the constitution and many other other things and there are vexed about it and they don't know what to do i mean if they're frustrated i mean they're frustrated about it and to think of it you can be justified without being sanctified you can be sanctified without having the holy ghost and being clean in a pure life in a form of godliness deny the power of healing speaking in tongues great gifts of god and every one of them right here in the bible there's your five virgins that had oil with their lamps wrapped in faith believe in all the signs wonders and prophecies and these five of that cut out of this remnant was taken away the rest were still virgins will not be lost if it goes through the tribulation period where there's weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth so you know again he would say how can you have rapture in faith when we haven't got healing faith now he's not talking about you have been praying for something for 15 years and ain't got healed yet and you're hanging on to the promise and you don't have the faith he's talking about the church if i can't get to church to even believe for divine healing how am i ever going to get a people to believe for complete divine healing and their body be changed in a moment a twinkling of an eye which is a greater healing than a heart trouble even or cancer being taken away and if i can't get you to believing for that how am i going to get you to believe for something greater amen now so he says he says we're moving right now into another great age coming for the rapture of the church and this i believe we're living in the time of restoration of gifts it stumbled many of the divine churches it sent nazarenes backwards it made fanatics out of a lot of pentecostals but just the same god is moving right on bringing in the rapture and faith of his church that's right so tonight i represent that faith that faith that was once delivered to the saints in the way of a divine gift amen and i think we can say that he well represented that faith amen again in in the in this in the first seal there's something we've got a step farther we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in the moment we swept up out of this earth oh he would look at the church compared to samson we got members but you're weak you lost your covenant with god got members got bigger muscles but where's the strength of the lord your big muscles won't meet the challenge of the hour the rapture and faith to drink the church out of this thing before the judgment strikes the earth don't we realize where we're at this is a challenge of the hour i mean we're preaching about divine healing and faith in the church and the power of god working in the church are you with me but let me tell you something friends it's got the challenge of the hour is not just divine healing faith but a raptured faith of people who will believe to the coming of the lord now what an hour this is he said someone asked me about the coming and the rapture we know we've lived the time out at the time of the rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapture in faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we can that we live in when we see a god that can raise the dead off the floor or out in the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a god who can take a cancer let's eat a man to his shadow and raise them up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapture and faith to the people that when that light flashes i want you to watch this word when the light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken to the heavens yes there's something that's got to happen and our intellectual theology ain't going to produce it this is why he says i want you built up in the holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour the faith that's going to take more faith than ever was in any age this has to be raptured faith be taken up so we want you to believe that on all you've seen and heard the words you've heard preached the signs and wonders you have seen we want you to accumulate that all together in your heart and consider whether it's god or not let me just ask you is it god or isn't it god is it god to change your life or was wasn't it god amen it was a god that took some of you that were dope addicts went to jail for it amen and god transformed your life and made a new creature out of you is it good that would heal the cancer among us that would touch a crippled child that would open up the eyes of blind is it god would give hearing back to the death come on somebody amen we ought to then we ought to accumulate all of that in our heart together amen and consider is it god or not god and if it's god when we should do like elijah and he said if god be god didn't serve him [Applause] hallelujah you ought to let go of everything else in other words and serve god with all your heart put everything you've got into it until he becomes a compass for your life when he becomes the compass you're no longer going to what the little twiddly work women that your work is saying about how cute you know this hairstyle is and that paint and this and that you quit giving that any validity and you give the word preeminence come on amen when you when you begin to do that you quit looking at social media and comparing yourself with them out there in the world and your have-nots and i can't and i can and i can't and i can't have this and i can't have that and when you give the word commit the preeminence then it becomes the guide in your life jesus in his last commission that he gave his church when he appeared to the leaven he upgraded them because of their hardness of heart and their unbelief can you believe this isn't this incredible that after all they had seen done the miracles signs wonders the lazarus after four days he you know brought back to life the the widow's son at name you know coming out on a on a beer as they were bringing him out and then and and there jesus stops it and and tells him to rise up and walk and man what about the jairus's daughter and peter james and john goes in there with him and and he says he's not dead like you think she just sleeps hey man they left him to scorn because she was dead and he raised her up called her spirit back from the other rounds raised her up to life again delivered him to her parents come on somebody amen and then after all the things happened the death the barrel the resurrection seeing him after he was alive and he still happened to abrade them because of their hardness of hearts and unbelief because they believe not them but has seen him after after his resurrection and he says to them you know he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and then it said and these signs shall follow them that believe so you've been taught to shake hands and put their name on a book jesus said different these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they will cast out devils they will speak with no tongues they will take up serpents or drink deadly things it wouldn't harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and that's the last commission jesus gave and here's the question will i find faith when i return well you know he didn't say will i find righteousness will i find a church he said well i find faith amen now jesus would turn to those disciples in that time when he when they tried to cast out an evil spirit out of a child and brought it to him and the father said they can't cast him out lord if you can do anything will you do something and jesus answered in matthew 17 17 oh faithless that's unbelieving and perverse generation a generation that distorts and turn aside and opposes and plots against the saving purposes and plan of god how long will i be with you how long will i suffer you bring him hither to me you think of this you see if this kind of faith would be expected of the disciples before calvary are you with me amen then what about after jesus shed his blood and we're now operating under a greater blood how much more should the power be in the church to cast satan out to heal the sick come on to save the lost to bring up the angels come and tap somebody on the shoulder and bring him down to the altar for repentance you don't believe that happens that's exactly what happens you don't come on your own nobody seeks after god no not one it's god coming to you the angels of god is coming to buy your pew and say you better make that right boy [Music] girl you better make that right amen but you know god gave israel a blood he gave us the blood and he happened to display that blood and i hear this prophet say and to be scared when you were under the blood i may believe you're under the blood and then to be scared was an insult to jehovah if a man what's under the blood feels afraid that god won't keep his word it's an insult to him jehovah perhaps this is your word but i don't know if it's right or not shame on you why once in the blood i am the lord that healeth you i believe that that's all don't insult him he that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out i believe it what's coming of the blood take his word for anything he says now can you imagine god taking a bride to his home who won't believe all his word god's going to have somebody that i believe in the message from god to abraham contains in his prophecy a message of the coming of the end time a message of the coming of the lord and the long-awaited son it also contains a saving of the church through the tribulation and also the judgment and the burning of their of of sodom which will be the world genesis 18 17 and the lord said shall i hide from abraham the thing that i do can't you see that in the last day that god's obligation to abraham's seed is to is to reveal to them what his plan of redemption is in other words shake the seals off the book amen show the plan so shall i hide from abraham what i'm going to do i've got to reveal to him the mysteries so it goes to show you there's an end time people who gets a visitation come on amen listen no not from pensacola not from bob jones not from some of these schools of seminaries come on somebody but get a visitation from the angel of god and to bring them back to their faith that was once delivered to the saints now he reveals the secret concerning the long-awaited son the coming of jesus back to earth again the change of the body the secret of redemption what is he doing he is breaking the silence removing the seals off his plan of redemption and in doing so at the same time he's sending investigating angels now in ezekiel 9 you will see nine and and maybe we should just reference it by the way he he tells them you know there's a slaughtering angels are going forth but before he does he said i want you to start at my house and i want you to put a mark on all of those that sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city is that right now of course this is this is played out in in in even in in titus with his surrounding jerusalem and and those who were in the house top when they saw jerusalem being compassed about with armies don't go get your steps flee to flee out get out of the city leave out of there what was that it was the marking of god or who believed the words of jesus that when they saw the sign of the of the jerusalem being surrounded get out of the city but you know again this is only a prophecy of the last day come on amen because he again he he is wanting us to make hate when you see the signs coming when you see it surround it when you see the solemn hour again get out of it flee it because everyone that's a part of it is gonna burn don't be caught in there [Music] praise the lord now listen he says slay older utterly old and young and maids and little children and women but come not nigh anybody that's got the mark began in my sanctuary and he put a mark on those who had sighed and cried for the abomination that's done in the city and i want you to understand it's a that's a travail of soul and brother adam describes it as a person who's always hungry and thirsting for god i tell you one true sign of the holy ghost is you can't ever get enough of god amen you just you're happy for what you've got but you're longing for more you want to know him in a greater way i mean that is an evidence of the indwelling spirit of god and sin makes you sick to where you sigh and you cry over the abomination things that are going on that god hates and it brings any true christian into a soul travail brother branham said you know he said if someone say to me now look william branham i'm going to make you answer for a group of people what you tell them now what do you want what do you want them all to do do you want them all to shout and he says sure i want them all to shout hey listen you s you slept out there you some of you churches he wants us to shout do i want them to dance from spirit i want every one of them to do you hear that out there amen all right that's very good but you know what would you you want them to all speak with tongues i want every one of them to you say brother tim oh everybody speak with tongues paul said i would you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied right amen so it's scriptural and he said well that's very good but what would you rather have them do he said i'd rather have a church that had such a burden on their heart for prayer that they just stayed at this altar and would be day and night and everything else and their house was constantly in prayer and humble and trying to get people to come to god and making calls at the hospital and visiting to sit and trying to get people to come to church and do right i would rather have that than all the other put together all the although the other is right and it belongs in the church but if i had to have it i put that first because if you got that the other will take place amen if you get so hungry for god shouting will take place if you've got homie for god speaking in tongues will take place if you get hungry for god you'll keep on hungry and keep yourself and you're going to see in yourself but if you go seeing yourself get a different there's another spirit trying to work itself in there stay right before god humble with travail of soul he said what if they come what if god went through churches the ceiling angel looking for those who would be at home or in churches saying god sent a revival just so hungry for a meeting oh god look at the sins of the city oh isn't it terrible god would you please send a revival would you send some good preacher send someone oh lord just let the holy ghost would he seal think of that now again this is what he's looking for he's looking for somebody that's got to care they they're so sure this is going to happen they are convinced that makes them concerned so therefore they have a concern for the lost and he says i believe that the doors of the gentiles are closing together and the season is about over and that's the reason you can't find a revival like that you know there's no travail of soul you can't get that burden and people have lost that burden but he said that's what the angel's looking for and if you're losing it and you're becoming cold and indifferent and backslidden in your life it's time to check up because the ceiling angel will only seal those who are signing and crying for the abomination done in the city they look over this sin cursed world and it smacks their heart look some are looking at it and like lot they want to go towards sodom but your look toward it will cause a travail god save my boy save my daughter you see him walk in the church the piano playing jesus keep me near the cross tears flowing down walking the church hear them there's a precious fountain in the cry coming out god laid some soul on my heart save that boy lord save that girl she's lost but you don't find it no more and let me just tell you it's rare to find it even in message churches the spirit of god is withdrawn jesus predicted it would be that way because iniquity would abound the love of many would actually wax cold you know and and he said that love is dying away he said what they got into just to form beat up the beat the piano up and down real hard and holler glory hallelujah and praise the lord and that's just a form and people have they can just make it a form that's just what we do when we come to church we get noise and we clap and we go home and that became a form but you know most of the form uses everybody just as quiet as a mouse and nobody says an amen you couldn't you couldn't buy any men out of them you know again you know this this is what we're finding it's a and and and church is not to be something where we're just acting but it's got to be a life that is being displayed oh my now as we look at this for a moment let me hurry and and he he he talked about it just like the casting of the net and he says you know as you cast him and he's the net he said you get in jesus parable you get everything from crabs to you know snakes and and spiders and whatever else that you get in this net when you cast but you get a few fishes too right so you cast that net and he said the pond's almost sane in other words we're coming down to where we're going to find the last name on the book are you with me amen and and he said jesus will come and he'll take his fish in and the serpent and the snake the snake the serpent the spider the whatever just crawl right back out into the pond and he says these words oh if there's one speck of christianity in you if there's one speck of desire for you to serve god hold it as tight as you can this morning and cherish it with all your heart amen oh my for the that same angel coming into the city which is the holy spirit dressed in white like his purity if that angel come to this city went through the pentecostal churches where in the world would he find men that sighs and cries and begs all night long in prayer for the abomination done in the city who would he mark we're going to find out who's got the holy ghost one of these days a marking angel investigating judgment the angels went looked down at sodom for righteousness notice the plea of abraham if you find 50 righteous so the angels they're going down there they're not looking for faith they're looking for righteousness so they go down to sodom you know because at sodom he's going to separate the righteous from the wicked you wonder sometimes what's going on and people taking sides and you know the liberal agenda and the conservative agenda i'll tell you it's the angels going forth separating you may not think it that way but let me just tell you there are things that are happening in the supernatural realm that you that are invisible to the naked eye and just as sure as the angel of god separated you and man and put faith in your heart he's out there looking out there in the world today to find the righteous ones and gather them together for the tribulation period for they will be saved in the tribulation actually they're saved on this side but they they will in the tribulation they give their life it'll be you read the bible revelation chapter 12 they'll be hunted down destroyed the last verses of revelation 12 tells you that he went looking for faith when he appeared to abraham and find sarah had none he raised her faith because a faithless and perverse generation cannot bring forth the promised son so the angels of god were bringing a total separation from unbelief from the bride and given to abraham the chains of the body on the other hand in sodom he they the angels are looking for a speck of righteousness in love you know revealing the salvation through tribulation the investigating sodom judging them and giving them the reward of their sins through their burning if you look with me to genesis 18 20 and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because her sin is very grievous i will go down now and see investigate whether they have done according to the cry of it and which is coming to me and if not i will know it and the men turned their faces from then and went toward sodom yet abraham stood before the lord 19 1 and there came two angels to sodom at evening and lot said in the gate and lot seeing those rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground and here shows three anointings three end time anointings the lord abraham elohim god himself with abraham's group and two angels who go down to sodom and these two angels will represent the end time anointing used to call the church not the bride but the church out of sodom now one anointing will be largely upon evangelicals billy graham would personify that anointing the other angel would come the anointing would come upon the pentecostal charismatics and oral roberts would personify that anointing now these angels are not billy graham and oral roberts they are anointings that were manifested on these men and the preachers to the church now not the bride the church and righteous lot represented the church and the angels represent the anointing that comes upon the ministry to the church and you cannot watch a billy graham's sermon without knowing that man was anointed that's the truth he was anointed to call people out of sodom to bring a separation amen what was it god looking for righteousness listen i i watched billy graham hear it sometime ago when i'm in a when i was in a cabin brother dan dyer and i was there together and you know there's i'm not much in the football side i didn't look at that but i flicked i found billy graham there in a 1968 or nine uh meeting there in it was in england and there you know he had his he had his own glasses on you know the teardrop glasses of style at the time and and um big big lenses on and and uh he was he was preaching a message and somebody had criticized him and said it's the motion of the music of you singing just as i am that's causing them to come and so that service he wouldn't even play anything but he had you know the old deal of of one of their rock stars that come up and sang a little kind of halfway gospel song you know you know here's a rock star that's been saved and then they had a football coach so it was which their soccer is football so their soccer coach you know with a big name in england and he come up and told how he accepted the lord and so on and you know just showing you know it's cool to you know you you can be a rock star or ball player whoever and accept the lord and it's cool it's a chick thing to do you know and and whatever and billy graham then gets up and he preaches his sermon and as after he preaches he brings it down he says now i'm just going to call and those of you that want to repent and come to christ come to him now and he stood there i'm waiting and without any music or anything and tens of thousands listen i looked and at least 50 000 people were moving out of the stadiums in union in unity coming right down there to accept crisis they're saying you can't do that without an anointing [Applause] i'll tell you what they're you know i don't know of another preacher so anointed that so many would move what was that what moved them an angelic anointing it was god trying to find righteous ones and separating them from the sodomites are you with me amen the same thing on the other hand with oral roberts oral roberts was anointed there were many that were healed in his meetings bonafide genuine healings amen amen and then he turns into his prosperity message and many embrace that what again god was looking to try to bring in a separation now again sodom represents a world condition it shows how the world has become so perverted that anything sacred or holy they want to pervert it and we have been moving steadily if you'll go back and even in our recent history where that men begin to or women begin to take on women's clothes and now men are beginning to take on women's clothes and now we're in this sodom world condition and it shows that the world has become so perverted that anything or that is sacred or holy that wanted to pervert it you know what one of the things first things this administration did was to roll back the the the and say we'll not have it taught in our schools about god and the pilgrim fathers we're going to teach a progressive type of history that is all inclusive and neutral you know again there is a perversion of our of of our um our heritage and man that will pervert marriage that is a sacred act between a man and a woman and made it legal to make a marriage between uh males or between females with females romans 1 24 and i'm going to read this from another version but hang on here this is why god lift off lifted off his restraining hand i want you to get this thought this is romans 1 24 if you want to look at it in king james this god gave them up to him cleaning us he actually lifts up his restraining health okay i'm going to just let you do whatever you're going to do everybody turns the world over to their own lust let's progress right on into sodomy in the laodicea brother i'll tell you you don't ever want god's restraining hand to be taken off of you that's right amen sometimes there's a restraining hand with you young people your parents it's god's restraining hand sometimes it's the pulpit are you with me which is god's restraining hand don't go that direction don't dress like that don't look like that don't be like one of them you think it's hard i'm trying to save you from the burning a man it's difficult it's difficult to preach against short hair and painted faces and high heels and and and and cross dressing and men with long hair and women with short hair it's it's difficult to preach on those things but you want to save them don't go that direction it's god's restraining hand this is why god lifted off his restraining hand and let them have full expression of their sinful and shameful desires they were given over to moral depravity dishonoring their bodies by sexual perversion among themselves all because they traded the truth of god for a lie they worshiped and served the things god made rather than the god who made all things glory and praises to him for eternities in eternity and for this reason god gave them over to their own disgraceful and vile passions inflamed with lust one for another have you ever seen lust so flames so high i mean millions of dollars billions of dollars in pornography even if i brought you the stats is shocking how many in one second in one second time of every day of porn sites that are visited hits upon them and god gave them over to their own this disgrateful and vile passions inflamed with lust one for another men and women ignored the natural order in exchange normal sexual relations for homosexuality and women engaged in lesbian conduct and men committed shameful acts with men receiving in themselves the due penalty for their deviation and because they thought it was worthless to embrace the true knowledge of god god gave them over to a worthless mindset now here's the danger if you want to take what god's word said he'll give you over to a worthless mindset he'll withdraw his restraining hand you'll greet him away for the last time they're sinful lives become full of every kind of evil and wicked scheme greed and cruelty their hearts overflowed with jealous cravings and with conflict and strife which drove them into hateful arguments and murder they are deceitful liars full of hostility they are gossips who love to spread malicious slander with inflated egos they hurl hateful insults at god yet they are nothing more than arrogant boasters they are rebels against their parents totally immoral they are senseless faithless ruthless heartless completely merciless although they are aware of god's laws and proper order and knowing that those who do all of these things deserve to die yet they go headlong into darkness encouraging others to do the same and applauding them when they do it second timothy 3 and 1 similar translation but you need to be aware that in the final days the culture of society will become extremely fierce and difficult for the people of god people will become self-centered lovers of their own selves and obsessed with money they will boast of great things as they strut around in their arrogant pride and mock all that is right they will ignore their own families they will be ungrateful and ungodly they will become addicted to hateful and malicious slander they will slaves to their desires there will be ferocious belligerent haters of what is good and right and with brutal treachery they will act without restraint bigoted and wrapped in clouds of their conceit they will find their delight in the pleasures of this world more than the pleasures of the loving god that we may pretend to have a respect for god but in reality they want nothing to do with god's power stay away from people like these now these horrible men are so like these these horrible men of sodom demanded a lot to give the angels to them so they could violate the angels genesis 19 5 and the niv that called to lot where are these men who came to you tonight bring them out to us so we can have sex with them this was this was the the sodomites this is what they would do to something righteous and holy and pure come on now amen listen i don't know if you're awake or sleep anymore in this in this time that we're living in but have you read the news lately where they're blaming right now blaming christian home school curriculum for the rights that happened at the capitol building specifically mentioning of becca and bob jones and ace the media blaming what happened in washington on art on christian teaching where are we where have we come we have the first openly gay person now in biden's white house cabinet as the secretary of transportation that is if he gets affirmed then biden's choice of assistant secretary of us department of health and human services is a man who wants to be a woman calls itself a transgender rachel levine and by the way twitter as of today has suspended a christian magazine from the focus of the family for saying that biden's trans nominee is a man who considers himself a woman and calls that hateful conduct it's cancel culture trying to force that no man can buy or sell unless you identify with them listen listen folks we're here where where the environment is being set up for a canceled culture are you with me amen where no one can buy or sell you can't even advertise or even be i president could even post his views because of cancel culture and we're coming right down where no man will buy or sell you're not able to even advertise on twitter facebook and all these other or even have your your news out there or whatever else unless it conforms to their agenda amen amen this is where we're at the spirit of sodom come on now if the angels of god are here demons are also here and the spirit of sodom is here upon the world and upon our nation and god is giving him up do what you want to you say brother jim why could this be because there has to come people in place just like it was when mary and joseph was to go down to to bethlehem to be counted in the census and god god there raised up a man to fulfill the word it had to get from nazareth down to bethlehem for jesus to be born and took an ungodly king with ungodly loss with hearts loss to force the word to fulfillment and let me tell you god has brought men into position to bring the word of god to pass amen are you with me amen and i'll tell you what some of it is just like it was in the days of elijah [Music] are you with me in the days of elijah what happened there was a there was a man that is that that raised up called himself a prophet and said you know what these two horns god will god will raise up and push them off and and and um and give the the land back to israel and and elijah said well how can god bless what he has cursed and he said and and who who was the prophet somebody help me right quick and man somebody tried to say it what was it micah micah the problem there's a bible reader at least one of us and my micah stood up and he said well i got the word of the lord and the word of the lord is that i saw a spirit rise up out of hell when god said who can deceive ahab that he'll go down to the battle and god said and he said how will you do it he said i'll be a lion spirit in the mouth of their prophets and their aligned spirit went forth from the presence of god to go in there to fulfill the word and let me tell you there are spirits in this age that are bringing about the fulfillment of prophecy a lion spirit deceiving the people but god's word is not going to fall to the ground amen now this is the job of the two anointings upon men today they are anointed by the angels to call men out of sodom and the same preaching of the gospel blinds the eyes of the unbeliever so some will believe by it and some will be blinded by it and that was what the angels did blinded the sodomites that they couldn't see the door now you see it was an angelic anointing that anointed thousands to respond to graham it was an anointing of the angel that inspired thousands to to when to believe uh for divine healing when oral roberts preached it you know look at the preachers of the charismatic realm that got on that faith wagon and even his prosperity message and he was doing his part calling out of sodom bringing the separation you're finding righteous ones here righteous ones there for what the tribulation hallelujah but if that anointing is upon men of the preachers in this day amen under the evangelicals and in the faith movements somebody help me preach if that anointing is still alive and moving and calling then the anointing of the elohim is still with the church today he is still looking up by the mind faith and putting faith in the hearts of god's children will i by faith i want to say brothers and sisters we are under anointing we are not here in this time alone we are not by ourselves amen but there is a greater one than what you see among us he's the one who heals the sick he's the one that changed the law he's the one that cast out devils he's the one that moves in our servants he's the one because i'm the same yesterday today and forever and i'm doing extreme things to get you to believe i want you to tell you this morning we are under the influence of a mighty angel it's the angel of the covenant it's the pillar of fire it's the holy ghost and it's the holy ghost that fields you it's the holy ghost that shields you and it's the holy ghost that are right for you hallelujah hallelujah we are in the vision we are in the prophecy we are in the moment and we are under anointing and that anointing will break the yoke of sin and unbelief and unrighteousness and filthiness of all this will it'll forgive you because i'll have a bride and she'll be without spots or without wrinkles or without a blemish i'll have a people for my name's sake lights yes we're used to hearing about lights there's a light over that woman there she has such and such problem her name is so and so she came from so and so we're we're familiar in this message with a pillar of fire with a light let me just tell you friends we are in a day of angelic visitation they're not going to get less they're going to get more and they will crescendo in lights coming from glory coming out swiftly even as brother branham would say i saw seven of them they come so fast i couldn't hardly count them you know i'm saying well you know where they're five where there's seven but here they come you know quicker than a blink of an eye and they were there and they caught me up in the midst of them oh man and the revelations that came from that boulevard let me let me tell you this was no this was no joseph smith and golden plates this was the bible coming alive this was the word of god not not something dug up out somebody's ground somewhere it's a mystic golden plate with some interpretation but the bible the very king james version bible vindicated [Applause] as i was taught just by an angel who stand before them who would argue with him but by the about the godhead and he says but brothers this is how i was taught by the angel of the lord the same one who never failed never misses and those seals if i ever had anything in spite of god it was that he said i was there in the room about to go to my old thinking my old ways you know what so-and-so said i preached it this way in the past but about that time he came in the room and changed my thoughts forever and it's perfectly with the scripture we're back in the day where god would take a light would appear and use dust to speak through he would do it in the days of abraham coming from that holy dimension of the logos the pillar of fire and there hover over some soil and there he would change that soil bring out the 16 elements step into a body walk down and sit down with abraham he would eat flesh drink the milk of the cow and the butter he would dare talk to abraham in his own language and i hear brother branham saying in this he says he said i pray father you'll wake the people up let them see they're living like a modern sodom and gomorrah granted lord they'll see that that angel that was promised to visit through human flesh and lord we know that that angel is a messenger from heaven which is the holy ghost it is him that wants to work through us the will of god to call the church granted lord send them again tonight send that great elohim that came down and just and made his have known because he could talk to man through the dust use the dust that's in here lord that's been consecrated to you this sanctified dust by the blood of jesus use them that ought to be our cry this morning lord use the dust that you have sanctified to reveal yourself in this sodom age to abraham's seed now this angel would initiate the coming of the lord it would initiate the gospel and power to bring on his second coming god doing extraordinary things but let me tell you about this angel this angel this is the one who would be sent to brother branham when he was there in 1946 at the first occurrence we would come and like a great light next thing out of that light came a couple of feet and these feet then would come to the hem of a garment and come up and finally show the face of a man standing there six foot tall 200 pounds coming right out of a light when he would converse and give his message he would turn back to that light and go right through the wall you say that's impossible brother tim jesus did it after his resurrection lights mystic lights something that the church world knows little about they've long forgot about the logos the pillar of fire and how he divided himself on the day of pentecost to give each man a portion of his own life they long for god in fact they come to a place we don't need angels today well i'm going to just say even jesus needed angels the bible said in matthew 4 11 this is after he got the holy ghost matthew 4 11 then the devil believeth him and behold the angels came and ministered to him there are just those days i feel like i need that ministry there's just those days when i fought it out that i feel just like jesus did come on i'm not even i'm not even half the man jesus was or a quarter or a third or whatever you want to say i'm not you know but here here again you know i need that angels came and ministered to him in in luke chapter 22 verse 42 father if you're willing to take this cup from me but not my will but yours be done verse 43 then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him i kind of feel that way too here we are in a very trying hour perhaps this is our gethsemane perhaps this is one of the darkest nights that we've ever been in in this message are you with me amen but today i say oh angel of god it's time for your appearance i need that strength coming from the angel of god i need a trust from elohim i need a touch from the almighty i can't go on i need a strength matthew 26 53 he talks about the angels at his assistance and he said don't you think do you think i cannot call on my father and he will put at my disposal more than 12 legions that's 80 000 angels we're talking about a book of acts church we preach about a book of acts church we say you know if the vine ever puts forth another branch she'll write another book of acts behind it did you know the new church had more angels ministering than the old testament did hello the new testament more angels there than the old testament you know there's ministered spirits that are sent from the presence of god amen brother branham said what's this angel lord we know this true what kind of nature it has it bears the same fruit that it did like it when it's on the earth now it's back in the church bearing the same fruit making another pentecostal church just exactly like it did in the first time the angel lord making another pentecostal church and if that angel truly comes from god and is sent from god it's bound to be it's a direct message from glory again he says and he declares god takes his mind but he never takes the spirit and i want to declare to you again just because if god took the prophet off the sea doesn't mean that the angel of god is left let me just say it just because billy graham and oral roberts are gone doesn't mean that men are not anointed with that same anointing today and make it a separation [Applause] but i want you to look and see what happened at the angels return their bodies begin to change abraham travels 40 miles to career for the purpose that the story can be wrote of this young king abimelech to show us that god has changed a 90 year old woman to where she is beautiful and desirable he had to change her and i want you to know that here we are living in in the day and hour of the angel's return it's his visitation and in his visitation he said i will return yeah he came to a prophet he used the prophet he used his ministry but he promised before the change i will return again there is to be the return of the angel now i don't care how the return is because he said i'll never leave your forsaken maybe maybe it's not maybe it's not that he's not been here i don't think that's it remember but it is that we just became where we were less cognitive and we got so involved in this and that and the other and theology and man's ideas and so on until we failed to recognize the living presence of the living god among us but it's a time in the hour for him to appear again to do what to give that strength to sarah body changing strength hallelujah come on somebody amen we often think discernment being the last sign brother brandon we're often talking about you're seeing your last sign but it's not the bride is the last sign the last sign is elohim in human flesh is that right amen and he said he said his church would be there without spot or wrinkle she's going to stand there in the splendor of him his word manifests she'll be a token or a sign to the world oh my he says in the again the trial i challenge you to believe that jesus christ is being revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body again he was saying it was showing a sign that god was in flesh jesus has gotten flesh and if jesus is in you tonight it's still him manifesting the last day the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known now so you see it is still the revealing of the son of man it was revealed in a prophet but it's got to be revealed in bride form amen so now he will have to change sarah and to do that she's 90 years old her milk veins are dried up her bath's being barren in her age she's got to be returned her heart's got to be changed amanda she's too weak to give forth labor is somebody with me amen because again you see there has to be something that changes sarah now the message came to turn her back to believing but then the angels returned the visitation to cause her to be changed oh i hear brother branham say it the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies because see the church the word the pride and christ his ministries and the bride which is his body the supernatural spiritual body of youth on the earth his spirit is living his life right out until him and the church becomes one for the wedding again what is the holy ghost it's all coming forth of the holy spirit so that great church is being filled up and choked full of the great powers of almighty god until it's got a place into the very works that jesus done has manifested itself right in the church now look again adoption time the church waiting on you and me adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when christ and the church become so close together till christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture amen oh again god's little flock that believes the word how many is one of them that little flock that believes the word its mechanics is ready too it's ready for the dynamics to set it a fire with the holy ghost fear not little flock it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom the holy ghost will strike a little church that's come out from the world women that wears long hair nazirite to prove they're separated themselves from the world oh my but god's got a loyal group of people a genuine flock who don't care what the world says they believe jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever god's going to send another shaking i'm just reminding you of the angel's return god's going to send another shaken amen and there's still somebody out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere somewhere in the world amen i believe we're on the brink of one of the greatest outpourings that's ever been ever had in this age i believe it i can't say the lord told me just something inside of me catching a hold of something that i hadn't seen in all my life till just now in the token i am looking for a break forth of the spirit of god in these last days that we're living in for another surge of the holy ghost into the church for a rapture and faith before it comes i wonder what your expectations are amen oh my it's not that god's forgot us god is here it's not that god has left us alone god is present hallelujah he said now you're going to see something happen i'm only building the hours close at hand where you're going to see something happen when something's going to take place and all this background here has been laying the foundation for a short quick message that will shut the whole nations i wonder if you're ready to be a part to be a party that elohim can step into everyone that he can reveal himself in now let me bring this down to a close brother branham didn't believe in little green men who came from flying saucers but in genesis there were three men that came walking up appeared from nowhere like i said the light the pillar of fire hovered over some dust pulled from its elephants elements needed to make a body stepped into it and disappeared again perhaps leaving a pile of dust somewhere and you know there's been a lot of carnal fantastics along the way a lot of silly little ideas brother branham would talk about that he said these little carnal things impersonation little fantastic he talks about a church in dallas texas they had people standing on the streets people the minister actually put in the paper little superman's coming out of heaven and flying saucers and gonna come down prove this revival center was a real genuine holy spirit was in it had people stand on the street looking for such as that he said how far can the christian church stoop down and eat from a garbage can there's no such thing as that word sheep don't listen to to stuff like that certainly i don't care if flying saucers flew through the building and everything else unless that dove he's talking about the holy spirit is there brother no need of having anything but now though he was aware of the fantastics and the fanaticism and all this the the the little rumors and ideas and floating stories but he was also aware of in the bible where there's a man called enoch who walked with god and was not he simply was there one moment and gone the next we're not talking about science fiction now we're talking about bible he was very aware of another rapture where elijah was taken up now i believe he was taken up into abraham's bosom that's where i think he went paradise without death but elijah taken up into paradise without death and he went in a fiery chariot with horses of fire and a chariot of fire and was caught up by whirlwind moved up into the heavens a fire light mystic lights jesus was standing there at the very end of his ministry talking to his disciples and suddenly light came under his feet and he was caught up not into a thunderhead but into a supernatural cloud and vanished from sight that was a rapture in the message paradox he says we see the world geographically we see the signs earthquakes and diverse places nations against nations we see all things as predicted we see fearful sights in the skies man's hearts failing flying saucers and so forth they can't explain investigating judgments coming down to the earth we see atomic bombs hanging out yonder everywhere and the great missiles that can carry total destruction in an hour we see the gases hanging right above us there that would rain down the fire down out of heaven and destroy the earth but we see jesus also who made the promise who said this same jesus that was taken up from you will come again in like manner if you've seen him go to heaven and we're watching for that great day to come christ revealed his own word you see these little pockets go into the air they call saucers well we better leave that alone you hear all these people come up missing and say they don't hear from them no more they're standing there they don't they're not there now see those can be made up stories and fictitious things men's imaginations but listen this but that's the way the rapture is going to be one of them will drop we'll talk about them lights god is a light he's a pillar of fire he come on the day of pentecost and licks of him come out birth and sons one of them will drop down here and this terrestrial body will take on a celestial body and there'll be hot hair bones left it'll be transformed in a moment of time dropping right out of space and taking home that we see this all going on they're wondering pentagon's wondering mystic lights are seeing them in the sky you see one here in the paper jeffersonville this week i'm missing like oh so they don't know what that is but listen little children it's going to pick you up one of these days see don't you worry as jesus said as it was in the days of sodom missing people what happened just before sodom god came down with angels they had an investigating judgment i've heard the cry it was so sinful so great i've come down to find out whether it's all together the truth or not that's right watch that main one that stayed with abraham could discern the thoughts that was in sarah's heart now you look around just a little bit and notice and watch what it's doing doing the same today is an investigating judgment why after a while and i believe we're in that after a while the church when he can stay in that place and every seed has been brought to its spot they'll be gone they won't know what happened to them one will be going one way one will be going over to the pastor's house one will be going over here down here the first thing you know they're not there for enoch which was a type god took him and he was found not come down to investigate the continuity how the enoch translation a type of israel being carried over in the ark missing people can't see him no more but you're getting together with the rest of the group now this is what he said one day if you die you'll leave your body here you will step into another body that's eternally waiting in the heavens and there you will join with the other theophanies in a body that is incorruptible the bible said that we'll drop these clothes and be clothed upon with another body with the temple he says that's not made with hands as i said and it's you know when darkness comes in as you're drawing your last breath and it begins to be all dark it comes this little light and you just start moving toward that light and you just follow into that light and it'll lead you right into a beautiful open area panoramic area where thousands of saints will be coming to greet the new arrivals but if you happen to be among those that are alive and remain those that in their theophanies will come here and they will appear among us and when they do you're going to see them and when you see them it's going to change starts happening you'll feel those chains sweep over but i want you to know what happens is your theophany your body that he's prepared for you will come to you and it'll sweep right over this body and it'll change you while you're standing on your feet and you'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and be caught up to meet the lord in the air and we will forever be with the lord comfort one another with these words that's the only comfort that i have in this hour not a new president not a new political system
