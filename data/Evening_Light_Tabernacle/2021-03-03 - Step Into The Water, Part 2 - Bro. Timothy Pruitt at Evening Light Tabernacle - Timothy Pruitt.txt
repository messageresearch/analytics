let's turn to joshua three in verse nine if you would it's good to be back in the house of the lord amen always i was glad i'm like david i was glad when they said unto me let us go amen to the house of the lord i know a lot of you has been out for some time with sicknesses and and of course the weather that we had and i know you're glad to be back amen there's nothing like being together with believers of light precious faith and amen an atmosphere that can come and and in these atmospheres we can receive a touch from the lord and that's what our desire is joshua in chapter 3 and verse 9 and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear the words of the lord your god and joshua said hereby you shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites the hittites the hivites the perizzites the gergescites the amorites and the jebusites behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passes over before you unto jordan now therefore take ye twelve men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe of man and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the fee the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall the rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heap and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people as they that bear the ark were comed unto jordan the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped and the brim of the water for the jordan overfloweth all his banks at the time of harvest that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city adam that is beside zaraten and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea fell and were cut off and the people passed right against over right against jordan and the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on the dry ground in the midst of the jordan and all the israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over jordan amen we'll let you be seated just like to continue a little bit on the thought of step into the waters you know i had the a privilege of being at this very place as far as as man has been determined of the crossing of the jordan river and today it's not a what you would consider even maybe looking looking at it didn't look like much of a river it was actually uh it was deep in some parts but it wasn't very wide but you know today it's controlled by man-made devices and and with dams and different things that controls its flow but you know looking at this river is actually one of it was one of the fastest flowing rivers of its size i looked a little bit of history on this river as a prominent it was a prominent feature in ancient israel the jordan river was mentioned you know almost 200 times in the bible it's fast flowing waters created a natural barrier between the canaan between canaan and the lands to the east and at times it also served as a line of protection when god's prophets or god's kings were being pursued but it begins this river begins at the mount hermon as the jordan travels about 25 miles from that mountain and it would empty into the sea of galilee and then it goes from the sea of galilee all the way down to the southern end and goes about 65 miles on down to the dead sea and it's you know this river is surprisingly narrow many places you know 50 to 75 feet wide in most places but you know the jordan name was derived from the words meaning to descend or go down the river actually significantly drops in elevation because mount hermon stands nine hundred nine thousand feet above the sea level while the dead sea sits 1400 feet below sea level so as it comes from a very high point to a very low point it's a very fast flowing river so it would help you understand the danger of this river and also in that day it was not controlled no doubt by man-made devices of dams and and locks and different things that would help control the flow of it and so in that time it was a very dangerous thing to even cross at the best of times amen and as we read in our scripture we they were to go across at seemingly the worst of times in the in the flood as it would come about at the time of the cross and there would be a flood in the harvest time you know and in many many ancient cultures rivers are thought to be sacred you know but the israelites didn't look at this necessarily as a sacred thing they looked at the jordan river as a barrier something that had to be crossed before they could move forward in their calling you know many ancient people you know would consider their their rivers uh you know to be sacred you know the the people of india they revere the uh genghis river uh they the egyptians they revered the nile river you know they made it to be a god to where they would worship and even the pagans that lived in in canaan would look at the jordan river as a god the jordan river symbolizes a power or a protection for them amen from their enemies it was also a power of fertility because rivers you know they give fertility to the land to bring forth fruits and different things and so they would begin to actually worship this god this god of the river but you know the israelites they didn't worship the jordan river they saw it as a barrier to be overcome and they would look from the other side of jordan over the jordan river to the other side there and on the other side was their promised land that had been promised them some 400 years before and here they're right here as they've been wandering even 40 years in the desert in the desert because of the others that refused to go in no doubt there was a great longing in their heart to cross over here but there was a seemingly a great obstacle in their path and it seemed impossible you know it seemed like it was at an impossible time and and this river was out of its bank so we would read here and you know and no doubt the the canaanites felt very comfortable that what an opportunity what a time this was that that the israel would try to cross but yet now it's flooding now it seems impossible to cross and no doubt the canaanites thought their god was protecting them during this time no doubt they thought that their god baal had been had come on their behalf and raised up the waters and caused floods to come to where the israelites could not cross over but what they did not realize is their bug their god baal was not as powerful as the living god that was among the israel amen and they did not realize how powerful that this god really was you know here they were amen please you know doubt no doubt by the timing they had heard about the israel's victories but they thought here our god has raised up a protection for us he's flooded the waters and is going to keep us from the israelites invasion but here israel had come to a monumental moment there was to either trust in god's power and step into a very dangerous river or they could disobey god's commands and go back into the desert in their fear amen god had brought them to a time of decision they had to make a decision am i going to go on with god or i'm going to go back in fear they'd already went back in fear and thousands of them died in the wilderness but here they had their own choice amen god gives every person their own choice amen a choice whether you're going to go on with god even though it may look impossible even though it may look insurmountable even though it may seem like god that god's against you or you know seemingly the devil has done more and he's done more he's more powerful than god and he's raised up things more but god is asking us to step out in faith amen when he bring when the devil brings cancer god is asking for you to step out in faith to believe the word of god no matter how insurmountable it may seem how impossible it may seem and you have to have been you will be brought to a time of decision amen and we are also a people in this age that we're living in when it seems like the world and it is getting worse and worse on every hand amen the demons have been released into this age and spirits on every kind and you can see it infiltrating amen to every government realm and to ever almost into every human amen thinking and to where their thoughts are on evil continually and it seems like the worst possible time for a rapture it seems like the worst possible time that god could come into this realm and snatch a body bodies out and take them into another dimension but god has got a people that say come to a time of decision you're either going to trust god or you're going to go back in fear amen but i believe there is a people upon this earth just like there was there amen that says yea though god slay me i'm going to trust him i'm going to go on into the into the power of god i'm going to go on into the holy ghost i'm going to go on unto the signs and wonders i'm going to go where god leads amen he may lead through the valleys he may lead to the mountains he may lead to the mountains or through the rivers but he said though the waters may come against you they'll not overflow you the fire won't burn you because i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world so he's looking for a people that'll go on with him amen that made their decision we're not going back hallelujah what's there to go back to there's nothing to go back to but death and dying and deserts amen the deserts of when there wasn't no spirit of god that could be moved and moving in the church we're not going back to that we're going on with jesus amen but it takes a trusting in him amen the priest a priest that would take the first steps into the jordan and immediately when they stepped into the river i mean the water stopped so they could pass through on dry ground and no doubt you know the pagans that had trusted in baal were stunned amen we're stunned at the power of god amen we're coming to a time that demons are going to be stunned people unbelievers are going to be stunned amen when they see the power that god has in the body called christ the bride of jesus christ living upon the earth he's going to be i mean his mouth is about to fall open you know we found that it was at the same cross at this same crossing amen of the jordan river is also where elijah would take the mantle and he would smite the water and it would open you know elijah seeing elijah you know and seeing god demonstrate so very powerfully in elijah's ministry amen he elijah would ask him what request he would have before he was to go and he said i want a double portion and he said you asked a hard thing he said but if you see me going up amen then then you can have what you asked for and we know that elijah as he came to that moment amen that chariot of fire swept down and picked him up and elijah's elisha saw him go up into the heavens and that man will come falling down and elisha grabbed that mantle and he took it to that same jordan river amen and he smote the same as elijah did and he said now where is the god of elijah if he's still the same today as he once did he has to show me himself to say amen and there's a people amen that the holy ghost has fell upon and they're calling for that same god of elijah i mean that same god that opened this red sea that same god that opened the jordan river that same god of the of elijah that would heal the blind and heal the lepers and heal the lame and raise them up out of wheelchairs amen there's a people here with the same holy ghost and saying where is that same god because if he is the same god he's the same god tonight as he was 50 years ago hallelujah i'm not serving a dead god i'm serving a god that's alive but it takes a people under the same anointing that'll grab that man of the holy ghost and walk down to the river and say where is the god of elijah hallelujah i believe we're at the same way at that moment amen where our people are under the same anointing as elijah was under the same god as elijah was [Applause] the same yesterday to tell him forever and we're saying if he healed cancer then he'll heal it now if you open the eyes of the blind then he'll open him now if he raised him up out of wheelchairs then he'll do it now and be filled with the holy ghost there he'll do it now where is the god of elijah where's the god i want him to be not elijah's god i want him to be my god i wanted to show himself to me to save all hallelujah the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah that's where your young people need to be i don't want to conquer my parents i wanted to be my car i wanted to show himself to me the same yesterday hallelujah he's bringing you to the same place and he's asking you to step out in faith [Applause] hallelujah he was also at this same place jesus was baptized hallelujah and he would step into those waters and the world would never be the same again because when he stepped into those waters and he was baptized in that water he came out of there and there was a dove that came out of heaven the holy spirit what was it symbolizing that god and man are together again hallelujah and you have the right to come to the same place but you have to step in the water and die out to your thoughts down to your unbelief die out to all the things that you thought you were your pride and your arrogance and all that stuff leave it all behind and say god bear me in the waters [Applause] hallelujah you have to be baptized with the same baptism he was baptized with at the same place i'm not talking about now a physical place i'm talking about the same place the same spot in christ hallelujah who am i why can't we just have that tonight just have a baptism of the holy ghost amen i'm looking for him to come all the way from this wall all the way to the back wall not leave a person behind but say god how many were here tonight say lord i want to fall in those same waters i want to step in that same water i don't want to be back there in my unbelief and back there in my pride and back there in my arrogance but i want to lay it all down hallelujah this is what he said in mark 1 and verse 1 the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare that way before thee the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his path straight john did baptize where in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins and there went out unto him all the land of judea and they of jerusalem and all were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins and john was clothed with camel's hair and with a girdle and a skin about his loins and he didn't eat locusts and wild honey and preached saying there cometh one mightier than i am and then i after me the latchette of whose shoes i'm not worthy to stoop down and unloose i indeed haven't baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth to galilee and was baptized of john and the jordan and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open and the spirit like a dove descended upon him and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son and whom i am well pleased what happened here the priest stepped into the water just like they did on the jordan river amen some thousand years before bringing the ark of the covenant down and they step into the water and the barrier that kept them out of the promised land was now done away with hallelujah and when he came down into the water and was baptized the barrier that would keep you from health has been done away with hallelujah young person i'm here to tell you there's nothing that separates you from the holy ghost [Applause] hallelujah folks there's nothing to separate you amen there is one baptism but there's many refillings if i was you would ask god refill my cup again hallelujah jesus stepped into the water and it made a way for man to come to god that we could still then we could that we could also step into the water and die out to ourselves that god and man could be joined again and again he came to conquer every barrier hallelujah between god and man to reconcile you back to god again what do you do with the woman at the well it's a very wonderful story she had a lot of barriers she had rejection that's a big barrier to get past that's right young people have a hard time getting past rejection we all want to be accepted and sometimes you know even our own mamas and own daddies don't even receive us we get rejected and it causes a scar there and it cause a barrier amen in the past she had a big past wasn't a good past either it's a bad past but now she's been visiting she's meeting the present that can do away with the past that's right that's right hallelujah what was it he was wanting to take her from the surface to the depths amen like like we know in the scriptures of the uh they're in the old testament of the of the prophet looking at waters coming out from under the throne amen he said what was it it was a waters to up the ankle deep and he said i need you to move on out a little deeper it was knee-deep and hip deep and all the way out and he said until there was waters to swim in see god is not just wanting you to just be a christian well there's a confession i'm a christian he wants you to move a little deeper than that if that's all you got that's what the woman at the well head with her past that's right that's right amen her past didn't keep her from i said i'm a christian that's right come on amen and when jesus said said look if you if you knew who i was or who i am you would ask me of a dream what did she look at him and she's looking at it like with a superficial understanding she's looking at him like what do you mean you ain't got a water pot that's right i know i've used this before but you ain't even got a water pot look what i got you know and she's bringing up her crutch and her her thoughts and her reasoning and her thinking and that was more important not realizing what's sitting right before said bring me a drink she said what what are you talking about the well's deep and and and you have nothing to draw with if you knew who you were talking to you would ask for a drink from me but it's surface superficial things that she's concerned with and she goes into religion and and you want to take her past the religion some of you only got to religion he wants you past just a religion just a theology or or some uh you know buzz words or or something that'll just make you how he wants us past all of that amen he wants you to come to the rivers of life hallelujah and this is what he was trying to get her to understand there's more than a water pot sitting here there's a god of creation sitting right in front of you the way one that brought you into existence i don't think we understand sometimes who's before us in our services who walks among us is the very god who brought you into existence and he's wanting you to get past your surface relationship with him he's warned you to go deeper step into the water go deeper into christ don't don't just not a bunch of surface relationships and i well i got i got this quote and i got that over there and i got this memory no it's more than that amen caught her to step into the waters of eternal life the waters of eternal life are not just ankle-deep amen they're not just up to your hips let's see it brother madam said it's either sink or or swim that's what the waters of life is amen the waters of eternal life you know it's time to leave the past behind that's right some of you have been dragging your past with you all the way but there's somebody here to tell you leave it behind let the past be the past there's a god here to not worry with your past he's already paid for it he's already done away with it he's put in the sea of forgetfulness leave it there and look at now your present future amen step into the water hey man what was it he was trying to talk to her and she was well it's not customary for you jews you know the very surface you're jews oh yeah we asked we women of samaria is such a thing and the conversation went on until jesus you know caught her spirit he said go get your husband said i don't have a husband that's right you got five and the one you're living with now is not your husband that still didn't get it four he was wanting to go deeper because then she goes to well we know when the messiah cometh he'll tell us he's saying but who are you right come on you know i i'm not here to i guess promote anything but let me tell you that chosen series caught some things this particular one about about the woman at the well when jesus started to tell her details about her life we know he does that because we saw him do it in this day details of her life and i know all those that they come up with probably wasn't her but whatever it was showing you who he was that he knows the details of your life he knows the ins and outs he knows your private closets he knows all about it hey man and he begins to tell her who she is and no doubt did he did he no doubt he told her about her first husband and details just like you did you lived on this street and you married this man that goes all the way down her life and she realized this is more than a man this is more than just a prophet this is the messiah this is the one that god has promised in this generation and you can read the scripture and the scripture says she left her water pots and she ran into the city what she thought was important at the beginning was no longer important why because she had stepped into a different kind of water it wasn't a water that would quench in your thirst for just a moment and the next day you're thirsty again that's what sin is it leaves you thirsty and thirsty and more thirsty but there is a water that can quench your thirst and it'll take you from the surface into the depths [Music] you know it was also at this river naaman the leper had to step into the water and this wasn't the easy thing for him to do you know he had he had a place you know to be a place of honor you know he was a a captain or a general whatever and but here he had something he was hiding under clothes and leprosy was eating his flesh people at his home knew about it but he'd go into the king's court as a leper hiding it all amen pride had kept him in this position and here he even finds out about a prophet and he hears this little servant girl in his house telling well there's a prophet in the land of israel and you go to him he he can tell you what to do amen man them little girls that little girl had more sense and a lot of people on this day we're living in somehow they're trying to do away with the message the very help that they could receive but here he goes and he comes up to the prophet and he said well you and no doubt he's thinking in his mind he's going to maybe say something over men and then all of a sudden he's going to vanish and the prophet says go dip in the jordan seven times he said what got angry about it here i am somebody that a nobleman are you going to tell me to get that muddy jordan river and bow down and humble myself like i ain't going to do it sounds like a bunch of message people they got hidden leprosy in their life but they refuse to get in what can cure them come on somebody there is a god who can cure you but you got to take the cure but there was somebody that must have been pretty wise in his his entourage and said look you need to do what that man said do it wasn't just one good good thing to dip in at one time he had to go two three four five six seven times amen to where all of a sudden at that seventh deal his blow his skin come out all fresh and renewed again wow but it took the first step it took that first step into that jordan river forgetting about his pride and his arrogance and who he was and well i'm the god's wanting us to shave all that off of us amen you know and jesus says we'll go back to him for a moment jesus with a ministry that moved that moved that area and that work and he said he went down the brother brown talks about him going down the jordan he said and that that spirit fell upon him he said it's now upon another people but they had to take a step to get into that place they had to move in that place into the spirit until god could anoint them god could baptize them with the holy ghost so god could change their lives amen that's what he wants to do he wants to do more than just crown you with a religion or clown crown you with some kind of head knowledge he wants more than that he wants to baptize you with his spirit that's why the church of the living god never never never needs to get away from the movement of the holy ghost from the baptism of the holy ghost preaching the baptism of the holy ghost why that's what it takes when you have that the works he said the works that i do shall you do also listen what he said it is going away he said lo a little while the world the visible the intellectual the culture the scientific the world will see me no more but you will see me for i'll be with you even in you and the works that i've done you shall do also and more than this shall you do for i go to my father oh my he's a good great god of heaven we're talking about it's not something that he was it's something that he is where is the god of elijah it's something that he is and he said of his people who are called by his name uh who's that who who heard your name called right there and his people who are called by his name will get past the barrier there's a barrier here of what the world's got to say or what the church has got to say or what science has got to say it's put there as a barrier but if you'll get past that and look at what god has said amen in a minute if you'll continue to look in that direction and keep your eyes upon it you'll pass that vibration of unbelief and you'll go free and you'll go out of this building tonight as happy as you can be serving god free sins all gone healed from all your sickness [Applause] what a power there is in this word amen if you can get past the barrier of unbelief the barrier of what the world has said or what critics are saying or what this will get passed at all tune it all out he said boy it'd be wonderful we have a wonderful time if we can get past that and he said listen and when you do he said god would not be a god of justice who would reward one person of their faith and disreward another he can't do it and he goes into some things let me read these for a moment he said if god took the leukemia out of that girl when she was laying yonder one of the best hospitals john hopkins that she could have been in and her limbs were falling off from her and but in one hour after prayer the child was pronounced sound and well by the same doctors god can't be just he said congressman nutshall who's been in a wheelchair for 66 years broken his back walks now like mr roosevelt would and we would heal that man and bring him out of that chair by vision and if another man set the same way and met the same faith god would be unjust to heal one and leave the other one alone but he is just he said it is us friend did you hear me it is us friend if we can move past that barrier if we can get to a place where it don't make any difference who says it as long as god sells it says it's the truth sail on as long as it's written in his word stand on it and believe god will bring it to pass i love this he said i thought about a little poem in one of my school books i was a little boy many of you men and women my age maybe remember sell on sell on is that when christopher columbus was given ships by the queen of spain because in his heart he saw a vision oh my of another world you know it was men that was expressing their doubts and unbelief that you know that the world is square and you're going to go so far and you're just going to fall off the edge of it and there's doubting him and saying it ain't possible and it's it but he had caught another vision did you hear me and i'm looking today at another people who's caught a vision of another world [Music] and people are expressing their doubts and and the rivers getting flooded more and more with the demons on every hand and spirits are rising up everywhere it says that ain't possible no more spirits even raising up in the message saying mercy's over and saying there ain't no holy ghost no more and saying all kinds of stuff nonsense but there's a people that's heard the word they've heard the cry of another land they saw it now by vision that that's been given to them by elijah prophet that's went to that place and said hey it's a good land it's a land flowing with milky honey you know in that land there ain't no sorrow there ain't no sin there ain't no worries there ain't no threatening amen and what is it has done something to my heart i can't help but believe it i want to go there and i believe if i want to go there god has made me a way to get there he has provided the power to get me from here over to there i just got to step out in faith no different than christopher columbus as he jumped on that boat it took a step and he goes settling across the ocean he said here he was given some ships with a bunch of prisoners and cowards that was his church members oh my bunch of pullbacks hello somebody wanted to always go back you know the the the winds of the holy ghost get to moving too much like oh let's pull back on this [Music] the lord gets to moving on hearts and lives oh let's pull back on this no doubt they had something in their songs that they would sing the devil don't like no we don't sing because the devil don't like us singing we don't shout because the devil don't like us shouting we don't praise god because the devil don't like us you know that a different verse but we got a verse we don't care what the devil don't like we don't care what critics don't like we don't care what unbelievers don't like amen i've been called to another land there's something pulling me there's something drawing me and i'm not going to be one that pulls back i want to go forward with all my might and say god i want more of you to fall amongst us i want more of that atmosphere i want more of the power of the holy ghost to fall in our services to give me a greater desire to leave here to go there [Music] there was all kind of unbelievers trying to discourage you a little while longer boy you're going to drop off the deep end y'all going off into pentecost praise the lord you're exactly right that's where i'm going yeah i know that curled a lot of you methodist message believers that curled your toes right up and you baptist and you catholic messes people that curled your going back to pentecost look at them pentecost was that not what the elijah prophet was set to do was to turn the faith of the children back or turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers what fathers the pentecostal fathers not azusa street the original pentecost amen that's exactly where i'm going back to and it's full throttle ahead because i see what message baptism the religion would do to people i've seen it strip them out of everything and give them an easy believism and then just believe the message and you're saved and yet be caught up with every kind of sin of unbelief and say i'll just grow a little more you'll get there one day old boy like a carrot out in front of them somewhere no hope to ever survive but there is a pentecost there is a holy ghost that'll fall upon a heart and change your life forever it'll strip out every barrier it'll strip out every sin amen there is a holy ghost bigger than pornography there is a holy ghost bigger than every drug addiction and every power come on now drug addiction is legal or illegal it'll take every one of them away from you there is a holy ghost and i'm going to stand into the water until every person passes by and god has called god called me to stand in the water and say there is a passage there is a place come on there there is a place to the holy ghost there is a place for the body chase come on in get in while it's open get in while it's open oh there ought to be a cry from even life get in while it's open there is a passage to the other side there is some passage of all things are possible get in while it's open there's a healing there's a deliverance there is nothing with the lord for the church of the living god get in while it's open and god has god called me standing in the river and saying it is the same yesterday the day and forever it is a safe baptism it is the same holy ghost it is the same healing hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah what will you say say hello [Applause] amen he said god give us men in the church like that that's right come on we ain't a bunch of pullbacks preachers preaching and we're sitting on our a man no no we're saying sick him amen yeah i never forget being in a in a little church over there in south carolina and i must have got on someone remember what i was preaching on but apparently i got on something that was going on all of a sudden this brother out there in the audience he stood up he said dad that devil is deal with him a while [Applause] that's the way our hearts ought to be not sitting on our hands and sitting on our laurels and sitting on our paths sitting on what we've done yesterday but there the devil is he's been tormenting the church of the living god there that cancer is there that lust is there the spirit of fear is sinking get him out of here he don't belong in the presence of the people of god hallelujah god give us more men women in the church like that amen i don't care what the scientific world says i don't care what the denominational church says i take god's word and i'm going to sell on i'm going to sell until i pass every barrier we're going to pass those by that's sitting around and thinking that god don't do anything no more come on the world ends here there's no more there's more no more to it there's no more god there's no we're going to push on past all of that that's right he said there was old church songs that i crossed the separating line and i've left all the world behind he said there was ever a time that the church needs to step across the line which separates you from between faith and unbelief by sight and you start looking to the unseen when you leave everything behind every care ever weary everything that says you can't be a christian come on cell on it says you smoked too long said you drank too long i've lived in adultery too long i don't care what you say what you've done though your sins being scarlet they will be made white as snow you watch once you pass the line of barrier of the devil trying to torment you saying you can't do it you can't do it i can do it for jesus said whosoever will let him come and i'm coming with all my heart [Applause] leave it all behind you know you know the devil wants to come and tell a lot of you well tonight ain't your night and it's for another day and maybe the next service it'll be your you need to look at that devil and say why not now and why not me why not me and why not now he promised it for me amen some of you young people been seeking after the holy ghost he promised it for you you need to quit letting the devil tell you it ain't for you and say god why not me why not now some of you've been balanced sicknesses for a long time and the devil said well it's just your burden to bear and god's trying to work something that ain't that's a lie the devil god has come tonight for your healing you need to look that devil in the eye and say why not me why not now you may have plowed through prayer line after prayer line and been prayed for you've been to doctors you've been to everything and still death trying to haunt at your door when you get to that place where you can say i don't care what the doctor said i don't care what scientific world said jesus christ made a promise to me he said what does it happen it begins to pass you through that barrier of unbelief and the vibrations that says it ain't possible and says it ain't so until you get past that and your soul and then you're free and there's not one thing that can shake it from it you'll sail just right into your healing just as certain as i'm standing here in the pulpit oh hallelujah you'll never turn to look that way no more you'll be looking this way you're so free from them things that say days of miracles are past there's no such a thing as divine healing i want you to know i'm free from those things it says ain't no such a thing prayer lines and laying on sick i'm settling on past you amen we're going on past it we'll climb the walls i'm in until all are free every rope every fetter has been cut loose every vibration has been left behind and then you're free free indeed oh how many wants freedom tonight then you need to tell the devil i'm not standing here no longer the prison bars have been open i've seen the king has been put in the lock and it works and he opened the door and he's speaking to my heart tonight i'm free [Music] how long your man you're free from that lust come on young lady you're free from that anxiety and fear amen come on you're free from that sickness of every kind move on past all of that still don't pass over there i'm not staying here why sit here until i die i'm going on with the law hallelujah amen it was four lepers that set it again in a time of famine and the enemy had surround them on every side but something began to stir in their hearts and said hey boy why are we sitting here if we sit here we're gonna die we might as well go out there into that camp and see if we can find something to eat whoa hallelujah amen we're sitting here we're going to die if we go there we die i'd rather die trying here hallelujah and it took one step it took one step in the direction of the anointing amen and anointed picked it up to such a place where the enemy out there heard them coming they said wow they got a big multitude that's headed our way and the fear began to come on them and all kinds of things began to happen until they fled from what four lepers yeah but it was the unseen force [Laughter] some of you need to ask that same question why am i going to sit here till i die the children of israel will they'd have set there and when god told them to go on in they'd have died just like their forefathers did that's right all it takes is one moving in the right direction amen that's why you would say one or two hearts on fire for god will do more for a church than 40 revivals what do you what is it one or two hearts moving in the right direction stepping into the water may make them look foolish make them look like they're foolish for a while but they know god's done something for them and when you know something god god's done something for you you could care less what the world says what your husband says what your daddy says what anybody says you know what god's done for you you know who you used to be you're not no more and you can see where you are today amen is not who you used to be like that woman said i ain't what i ought to be but thank god i ain't what i used to be there's a whole lot of people in here can look around and say hey i used to be this and i used to be that i used to be there but god rich in mercy came down on my behalf and it changed my whole life and i'm not who i used to be all of a sudden it starts a little vibration something begins to happen and the devil's like oh wait wait wait wait wait a minute you're going to get beside yourself and you're going to run around the church people going to thank you crazy i don't care there you go one or two hearts will fire for god will do more for a and 40 revivals we got one person that don't care then we have another person that don't care amen there's a whole world that's caring about what hell thinks there needs to be a group of people in this building that could care less what the game will ever say about them because i'm free i've been translating favor the blood of the lamb and i'm not going back stay alone i want to step a little deeper i want to go further in the love of god i want to go more to his riches in his mercy and the enemy's saying what is that sound what is that sound amen that's catholics or enough people amen has heard the voice of god that way they begin to break away from the vibrations and the little funny feelings that they felt coming to church and they lay them all aside and they said you know what tonight i'm getting something out of this church i'm not leaving here amen with the good still there and i go home empty i'm going home cool can we get somebody that says i'm going home hills i'm going home delivered i'm going home full of the holy ghost i'm going home sealed i'm going home chase [Applause] glory to amen blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] you know what he did for you can you worship him for that amen [Music] [Music] oh yes he's worshiping he's here [Music] [Music] i'm going home oh bless the name of the lord i ask the holy ghost to just sweep to this building sweep whoever hard god change every life father don't let there be one person left out [Applause] the devil's been lying to you saying this message ain't for you and it's a bunch of hoopla but there is a one here among us it's not timothy pruitt tim pruitt or any other preacher it's jesus christ himself and he's walking up and down the aisles right now and he's changing hearts for life and he's here to change yours he's here to change your whole thought process blessed be the name of the lord oh you're getting past that last vibration so that last part of unbelief i believe we're in a time where every person can go home here where every person can be saved and filled with it listen why not believe it he did it 50 years ago he can do it today we're in that kind of atmosphere right now of all things are possible if i was you i'll just say lord i lay aside every bit of unbelief every bit of my pride every bit of my thinking everything around me i lay it all down it's me and you jesus come and do what you do i believe in this atmosphere there's strength to conceive [Music] that lying devil's been trying to put amen bareness upon our sisters i curse that devil in the name of jesus christ [Applause] we are not a barren people we are a people of the spirit of god amen there is a bride that's called to step into the water it is a water separation it's a water separating you from the unbelief and everything that's not go god amen if i was you i'd start taking steps amen right now steps steps are possession overcoming every spirit some of you allow spirits to stay in your home it's time for them to go you allow things to come up higher than god it's time to tear down every high place we're crossing over it'll take the first step to get to the last step enoch had to take a first step come on brother andrew enig had to take a first step to get to that last step oh but what a last step that was oh my god elijah had to take the first step to get to that last step but oh what a step that was jesus had to take the first step to get to that last step but oh what a step that was you've had to take a step to get to the last step but what a step that's going to be hallelujah hallelujah listen to this jesus christ god's son has set in the church for you people such things as this first he said apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists to confirm this word to prove who he is oh hallelujah he has placed them in the water some of them are stepping out but i ain't i'm staying in until the last soul comes home come on evening light we got into the water we ain't stepping out until that last soul comes home i believe it like this one service is going to be our last service and it may be in that last service the last prodigal comes home the devil tried to put king slap on him try to keep them bound but that chronicle is now taking his first step oh hallelujah and he's coming home she's coming home they are coming home in jesus name [Music] it's in the bible [Applause] step into the water i remember a first step a little girl she's about 16 years old stepped up to the altar something that moved on her heart she come up and she said i got a brother that ain't saved i want my brother i want my family back together it took that first step [Music] she seemed there was somebody greater than some minister standing there it was somebody that could meet her need she just wanted to touch the hem of his garment that took that first step [Music] we know what happened the brother at home sleep wakes up and sees his family at home terror struck him somehow he finds his way to church that very same night and he took that step down to the altar that was a sign there's more to come and i'll put it this way devil there ain't nothing you can do about it you try to cover them over with every kind of unbelief and every kind of scientific proven every kind of day but there's a god who'll break every berry but there's a seed laying on the inside of there and it will come forth [Applause] here's a bride that took a first step
