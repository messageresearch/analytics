[13:05] I'm amazed.
[13:08] Oh, how you came.
[13:10] [Music]
[13:12] Through your preious
[13:15] blood I found pardon.
[13:19] And my sins are washed. They're all
[13:25] washed away. Oh, my sins are washed.
[13:31] Oh, I'm amazed.
[13:33] I'm amazed
[13:37] that you love me.

[13:47] Through your preious blood, I found
[13:51] pardoned.
[13:54] And my sins are washed. They're all
[13:59] washed away.
[14:01] All my sins all wash away.
[14:07] No one knew
[14:09] how alone I was feeling.
[14:15] And the emptiness I tried so hard to
[14:18] hide.
[14:21] Though I laughed and said my life was
[14:25] fine without you.
[14:28] I was covering up the secret tears. I
[14:32] cried
[14:35] and one day someone told me of your
[14:39] mercy
[14:40] [Music]
[14:42] and the love you showed on a hill called
[14:45] Calvary.
[14:48] There you died
[14:51] and purchased my redemption.
[14:55] When you broke sin's power, set my
[14:58] spirit free.
[15:01] Oh, I'm amazed
[15:05] that you love me.
[15:08] Oh, I'm amazed
[15:12] how you care.
[15:15] Through your preious
[15:18] blood, I found pardon.
[15:22] And my sins are washed. They're all
[15:27] washed away. Oh, my sins are washed
[15:33] away.
[15:35] Yes, it's true. There have been days
[15:39] when I failed you.
[15:43] Lord, you know the many times I've gone
[15:46] astray,
[15:49] but I've learned your love is stronger
[15:53] than my weakness.
[15:56] And your ear is open every time I pray.
[16:03] No one else has ever cared for me like
[16:07] you, Lord. Other
[16:10] friends could never be as close to me.
[16:16] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[16:20] tomorrow.
[16:23] Knowing you are everything I'll ever
[16:28] need.
[16:29] Oh, I'm amazed.
[16:34] Oh, yes I am. I'm amazed
[16:40] how you care.
[16:43] [Music]
[16:47] I found pardon.
[16:50] And my sins are washed. They're all
[16:56] washed away. Oh, my sins. Let's stand
[17:00] together. Sing it again. Oh,
[17:04] I'm amazed.
[17:08] that you love me.
[17:11] I'm amazed.
[17:14] [Music]
[17:15] Oh, how you care.
[17:20] Precious blood I found pardoned.
[17:24] And my sins are washed. They're all
[17:29] washed away. Oh, my sins are washed
[17:35] away.
[17:40] Hallelujah.
[17:41] Aren't you thankful your sins have been
[17:43] washed away by the blood of Jesus?
[17:46] Amen. I want to remember tonight or
[17:48] today, brother Glenn Westerfield been
[17:51] very sick for the last few days and
[17:54] doctors hadn't been able to find a
[17:56] diagnosis.
[17:57] Also the children of brother Jason
[18:00] Tagert is very sick with hand and foot.
[18:03] So I want to remember them today. Also
[18:05] pray for brother James Hollis having
[18:08] problems with his other eye. One he
[18:10] hasn't had surgery on yet. So make it's
[18:13] making it very difficult to see. Brother
[18:16] Alvin Adams request prayer for his hands
[18:19] still hurting him. Uh brother Gary
[18:22] Stanky his back is hurting really bad
[18:25] today. He just needs a touch from the
[18:26] Lord. Also remember Joe, brother Joe
[18:29] Adams as he's ministering down in Mexico
[18:31] and brother Jonathan is with him and
[18:34] maybe others as well that the Lord will
[18:35] be with them and give them a wonderful
[18:38] time there. How many would have a need
[18:39] just want to make it known to the Lord.
[18:41] I mean I'm ask brother Aaron if he'd
[18:43] come and open up our service today in
[18:45] prayer and Amen. just pray together and
[18:49] ask God to minister to these needs this
[18:52] morning.
[18:54] [Music]
[18:57] Amen. Let's pray together.
[19:00] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just want to
[19:02] take a moment right now and say thank
[19:03] you, Lord. We're thankful, Lord, for
[19:06] everything that you've done, Lord. Lord,
[19:09] knowing that your hand has been upon our
[19:11] lives, Lord, from Lord, from before the
[19:13] foundation of the world, you saw us, you
[19:16] knew us, and you cared for us, Lord.
[19:18] Lord, I want to thank you for this
[19:19] opportunity this morning to gather here,
[19:22] Lord, to lift up your name and to to
[19:24] worship you, Father. For truly you
[19:26] deserve it, Lord, for the opportunity to
[19:28] come and have you speak to us, for the
[19:30] opportunity to to be in your presence,
[19:33] Lord. How many today, Lord, don't have,
[19:35] Lord, what we have, Lord, with this
[19:37] opportunity. And Lord, I just pray that
[19:38] no one will, Lord, let this opportunity
[19:40] pass us by, but may we take full
[19:42] advantage of it today and grab a hold to
[19:45] it and give our everything, Lord. Lord,
[19:47] I just want to lay aside the events of
[19:49] the week past, Lord, and lay aside maybe
[19:52] what I'm looking forward to in next week
[19:54] and and just enter in this morning with
[19:56] my whole heart. Give you my everything
[19:58] and allow you to speak to me, Lord, and
[20:00] change me and mold me. And Lord, we just
[20:03] want to praise you and and create an
[20:04] atmosphere that you feel welcome in this
[20:07] morning. That you that you are pleased
[20:08] with and that you'll come down and begin
[20:10] to deal with lives and deal with hearts,
[20:12] Father. And Lord, we don't just gather
[20:14] out of tradition. We're not just just
[20:16] here to see one another or fulfill a
[20:18] duty, Lord, but we want to be changed in
[20:20] your presence this morning, Father. And
[20:22] we want the word to have its full
[20:23] effect. So, Lord, right now, we're going
[20:25] to open up ourselves and ask today that
[20:27] not only will you anoint our minister,
[20:29] Lord, but you'll anoint me and you'll
[20:31] anoint every hearer today. That Lord,
[20:33] that the word can take its effect in our
[20:35] lives and the word will fall on good
[20:37] ground and will allow it to change us,
[20:39] Father. Lord, we thank you for this
[20:41] opportunity. We thank you that you're
[20:43] still the healer. Lord, you heard the
[20:45] many needs, Lord, right across this desk
[20:47] from from Brother Gary to brother Hollis
[20:49] and the Tagert children, Lord. And you
[20:52] know each one, Brother Alvin, that's
[20:53] suffering, Father. You see the needs in
[20:56] the body, Lord. You know the ones that I
[20:58] I can't recall, Father. But not only do
[21:00] you know, but you've provided and you've
[21:02] taken stripes, Lord. And and I'm asking
[21:04] today, Lord. I'm asking that you'll go
[21:06] to each one of these needs, each one
[21:08] that was mentioned. And may your healing
[21:10] angel begin to go on their behalf even
[21:12] now, Lord, and begin to work in those
[21:14] bodies, Father. Lord, we know that this
[21:17] is an imperfect time and that sickness
[21:18] still comes, but we know the stripes you
[21:21] took still work, Lord. And that the word
[21:23] that says that you are our healer, Lord.
[21:25] That by your stripes, we're healed. It
[21:27] still works today, Father. Lord, and
[21:29] we're standing on your promises and
[21:31] we're believing today and asking you to
[21:33] move, Lord. Lord, you see your little
[21:35] bride today gathered around the world.
[21:37] Lord, in churches, Lord, all over this
[21:39] country, all around the globe. Lord, I
[21:41] pray that you'll meet with them. Lord, I
[21:43] pray you'll speak. I pray, Lord, that
[21:45] you'll help each one of us come to that
[21:47] place. Lord, I don't want to be one
[21:48] hindering. Lord, I don't want to be one
[21:51] not ready. Lord, I pray we'll all get
[21:52] ready today, Lord, that Lord, when it's
[21:55] time, we're ready to go, Father. Lord,
[21:57] we just ask you to move in this service
[21:59] in a special way. I want to remember our
[22:00] brother Joe this morning, Lord.
[22:02] Ministering there in Mexico, Lord. We're
[22:04] here in good reports. I pray that you'll
[22:06] just pour out your your spirit. Pour out
[22:08] a blessing. Strengthen him and give him
[22:10] wisdom, Lord, for every service. I pray
[22:12] we ask you now, Lord, to move in this
[22:14] service to have your way here, Father,
[22:16] in Jesus name. Amen.
[22:22] Amen. God bless you this morning. Just
[22:24] want to say that we've made quite a bit
[22:26] of changes to the sound and things. a
[22:29] complete change out. Going to be a lot
[22:31] of changes here on the platform as well.
[22:33] So, be looking for that. But, so if you
[22:35] see some people and some moving parts,
[22:37] that's what that's all about. God bless
[22:38] you today. Turn around, shake one of his
[22:41] hand, welcome each other to the house of
[22:42] the Lord and say, "It's good to be here
[22:45] this morning."

[34:31] And everything I go through, he knows
[34:36] what's best for me.
[34:41] My father knows what I need. I put my
[34:47] life
[34:49] I put my life.
[34:53] Oh yes, Lord.
[34:57] I put my life
[35:01] oh in his hands. So every road I walk
[35:06] down, I'm sure it's in his plan.
[35:13] [Music]
[35:14] I put my life in him. Oh, he's got it
[35:20] all.
[35:22] He's got it all in control.
[35:29] He's got it all in control.
[35:36] [Music]
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[35:40] Way down in my soul.

[35:50] Sing it again. He's got it all.
[35:54] He's got it all
[35:57] in control.
[36:01] He's got it all in control.
[36:08] He put that reassurance
[36:12] way down in my soul.
[36:18] He's got it all.
[36:22] Oh, I put my life one more time in his
[36:24] hands.
[36:26] I put my life in his hands.
[36:31] [Music]
[36:34] I put my life.
[36:37] Oh, in his hands.
[36:40] [Music]

[51:46] Here's my cup,

[52:25] I want
[52:27] no
[52:29] more?
[52:31] Here's
[52:33] my cup.
[52:35] Fill it up
[52:39] and make me home.
[52:44] Before we pray this morning,
[52:47] just thinking about the age, the time
[52:50] that we're living, and it's a
[52:52] troublesome time, a troublesome hour.
[52:55] We've had in recent days a tragedy that
[52:58] has hit our nation. And
[53:01] I know that it's grieved the hearts of
[53:03] many. And we're a man that was righteous
[53:07] standing for what he knew.
[53:11] is just his life snuffed out in just a
[53:13] moment.
[53:15] And I just wanted to say, God, help us
[53:19] to be faithful to the call of duty in
[53:22] this critical hour.
[53:25] I'm inspired by this wonderful quote
[53:27] where brother Brandham once prayed for
[53:29] us and said, "Anoint ministers, Lord,
[53:33] like flames of fire, making the last
[53:36] call the sign of the last day.
[53:40] And we too must stand under that
[53:42] anointing today. We're called to go
[53:45] forth in his name knowing that the bride
[53:48] is the last sign,
[53:51] the final voice to a dying world. And
[53:55] Satan is doing everything he can to
[53:58] silence the voice of the righteous
[54:01] because we are his voice. Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; We are the voice of many waters as said
[54:07] in Revelations 1:15.
[54:09] And our voices today blend with the
[54:12] mighty men and women of the past. We're
[54:15] testifying of the same Christ, the same
[54:19] word, the same spirit, the same power.
[54:23] I think today of Stephen, the first
[54:27] martyr who was stoned because he spoke
[54:30] words that God put in his mouth that
[54:33] others didn't want to hear. And recall
[54:36] the prophets and the apostles and of our
[54:39] Lord himself
[54:40] who often spoke hard truths and bore
[54:46] great persecutions
[54:49] rather than compromise the word.
[54:53] The book of Isaiah admonishes us to cry
[54:56] loud and spare not, but lift up thy
[54:58] voice like a trumpet.
[55:01] Paul would tell us, "Preach the word, be
[55:03] instant in season, out of season,
[55:06] reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
[55:09] longsuffering and doctrine."
[55:11] [Music]
[55:15] The book of Proverbs says that the
[55:17] righteous are bold as a lion
[55:22] while the wicked flee when no man
[55:24] pursueth.
[55:26] And we can remember these words of
[55:29] Jesus. Blessed are you when men, people
[55:34] insult you and persecute you and falsely
[55:37] say things, all kinds of evil things
[55:40] against you because of me.
[55:43] But rejoice and be glad because great is
[55:46] your reward in heaven.
[55:50] So therefore today we want to do as Paul
[55:53] admonished us and
[55:56] as he said that it's granted to you on
[55:58] the behalf of Christ not only to believe
[56:00] in him but also to suffer for him. So I
[56:05] tell you today
[56:07] let us speak boldly.
[56:09] Let's refuse to be silenced
[56:12] &gt;&gt; in this perverse generation.
[56:15] Let's earnestly contend for the faith
[56:18] that was once delivered to the saints.
[56:21] Let's stand
[56:23] as flames of fire to herald his coming.
[56:27] Jesus commissioned us. Go into all the
[56:30] world and preach.
[56:33] And our commission is a command. And we
[56:36] are the living voice of God in this
[56:39] hour. And if others fall silent in fear
[56:42] or compromise,
[56:46] let us not.
[56:48] The cost of truth may be high,
[56:51] but the cost of silence is even greater.
[56:55] [Music]
[56:56] May we have the courage, the career, the
[57:00] clarity, the fire to bear witness no
[57:03] matter what.
[57:05] May we go forward with courage and unity
[57:09] and unquenchable fire until ever last
[57:11] soul is called and the bride is ready.
[57:16] Realizing we have a job to do and a
[57:19] mission to fulfill to take this gospel
[57:23] to all the world. Don't be afraid to
[57:26] testify,
[57:28] to witness, to live a life a shining
[57:31] example before others.
[57:33] Bear the cross.
[57:36] Hold forth the banner.
[57:39] Let's live today as if today were our
[57:42] last because we never know when we will
[57:45] be called.
[57:47] The rapture is imminent. The coming of
[57:50] the Lord is at hand. Let's prepare our
[57:53] hearts.
[57:55] Let's leave no one behind.
[57:58] Let's encourage everyone to press the
[58:01] mark, to have a greater passion, a
[58:04] greater desire, a greater ferveny to
[58:08] serve God.
[58:11] Today, as we just bow our heads and ask
[58:13] God's blessings over the word, maybe you
[58:16] would like to be remembered in prayer as
[58:18] we pray and say, "God, help me to have a
[58:22] passion for the truth and to stand for
[58:24] righteousness."
[58:26] Sodom. This Sodom world hates us. It
[58:30] would snuff out our light.
[58:32] But Jesus Christ
[58:35] will herald the light all the way to the
[58:37] end through a bride. Father, in the name
[58:40] of Jesus, we love you today and we thank
[58:43] you for the many blessings you bestowed
[58:46] upon our lives. the grace that has been
[58:50] shown to us, the love that has been
[58:54] given. And Lord, we are here saying
[58:58] today, here's my cup. Fill it up. Let it
[59:02] overflow so that I can be a witness to
[59:04] others.
[59:06] Let not me be one who would hide my
[59:09] candle under a bushel, but let me tell
[59:12] the world Jesus saves and that there is
[59:15] a life worth living. Living for you
[59:19] means everything. I pray, dear God, that
[59:22] you'll bless us together in your
[59:24] presence. Let your Holy Spirit anoint us
[59:27] today. May we do more than just say
[59:30] words, but Father, may the spirit of God
[59:33] come upon the word and anoint it to
[59:36] every heart. We pray in the name of
[59:38] Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. If
[59:43] you turn to your Bibles, we're going to
[59:45] be reading from the scriptures this
[59:47] morning. And and uh today I'm going to
[59:49] be speaking on the new birth, lost now
[59:54] restored.
[59:56] And um of course you know our subject
[59:59] has been on the mountain movers where
[1:00:02] that we have we have um been quoting
[1:00:07] from this scripture. Who art thou oh
[1:00:08] great mountain? Thou shalt become a
[1:00:11] plain and the headstone shall be brought
[1:00:13] forth with shoutings crying grace grace
[1:00:16] unto it. And I want you to understand
[1:00:18] there's been great favor that has been
[1:00:21] poured out upon this generation.
[1:00:24] Which is why that God has sent a message
[1:00:26] in this last day to prepare the hearts
[1:00:29] of the people and turn them back to the
[1:00:31] faith of the fathers. And that's grace.
[1:00:35] But in order to do so, there had to be
[1:00:37] mountains that were moved out of the way
[1:00:41] and valleys of neglected truth that had
[1:00:43] to be exalted. And of course, we're part
[1:00:46] of that where God is bringing a great
[1:00:50] restoration this day, not only of his
[1:00:52] word, but of a people that is called by
[1:00:54] his name who will be united with him.
[1:00:58] And so today, we're going to take our
[1:01:00] scripture reading from John 3:1.
[1:01:04] There was a man of the Pharisees named
[1:01:06] Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. the same
[1:01:09] came to Jesus by night and said unto
[1:01:11] him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a
[1:01:13] teacher come from God. For no man can do
[1:01:16] these miracles that thou doest except
[1:01:18] God be with him." And Jesus answered and
[1:01:21] said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say
[1:01:23] unto thee, except a man be born again,
[1:01:27] he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[1:01:30] Nicodemus sth unto him, how can a man be
[1:01:33] born when he's old? Can he enter the
[1:01:36] second time into his mother's womb and
[1:01:38] be born?
[1:01:40] And Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I
[1:01:42] say unto thee, except a man be born of
[1:01:45] water and of the spirit, he cannot enter
[1:01:49] into the kingdom of God. That which is
[1:01:52] born of the flesh is flesh. That which
[1:01:55] is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel
[1:01:59] not that I said unto thee, you must be
[1:02:02] born again. The wind bloweth where it
[1:02:05] list, and thou hears the sound thereof,
[1:02:08] but can not tell whence it cometh, and
[1:02:11] whence it whether it goeth. So is
[1:02:14] everyone that is born of the spirit. God
[1:02:18] bless you. Can be seated. We're so happy
[1:02:21] to have every one of you today that has
[1:02:24] gathered with us. And I feel uh very
[1:02:27] privileged that you are here today and
[1:02:30] want to share in this in these moments
[1:02:33] together. And you know, Sunday is a day
[1:02:36] where we come together, put two services
[1:02:39] into one, Sunday morning, Sunday night
[1:02:41] because many travel in got ways to go
[1:02:44] back home. But nevertheless, we're here
[1:02:47] today to receive of the word of God. And
[1:02:51] uh I'm still in my teaching mode because
[1:02:53] there are some things that I want to
[1:02:54] establish the church in. And um of
[1:02:58] course when we do this it it it opens
[1:03:01] the way for the evangelistic ministries
[1:03:04] which I have and others have to come
[1:03:07] behind here and you know to to see the
[1:03:10] Holy Spirit come in in a great way and
[1:03:13] uh bring a harvest to the seeds that
[1:03:15] were planted. So um you know we spoke
[1:03:18] last week of Leodysia the most deceiving
[1:03:21] age and we read from from Matthew 24:24
[1:03:27] for there shall be false Christ and
[1:03:29] false prophets and shall show great
[1:03:31] signs and wonders in so much if it were
[1:03:34] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:03:38] elect. And of course, brother Brandham
[1:03:40] told us in in the message, I believe it
[1:03:43] was, you must be born again, that false
[1:03:46] prophets
[1:03:48] bring or give forth false births. So,
[1:03:52] it's very important then to understand
[1:03:56] in this day that is so deceiving what
[1:03:59] really the new birth is. Now, and and of
[1:04:04] course, one of the causes of the great
[1:04:06] deception in the end time is because of
[1:04:10] the lost meaning of the new birth and
[1:04:14] the and that meaning the true meaning of
[1:04:17] that was lost down to the dark ages and
[1:04:22] has been restored in stages. Now, this
[1:04:26] is why there's going to be a huge
[1:04:29] number. The Bible describes them in
[1:04:31] Revelation chapter 7 that there's going
[1:04:34] to be a huge number. He called it a
[1:04:36] multitude without number.
[1:04:39] an innumerable multitude who will be
[1:04:44] saved this side of the tribulation, but
[1:04:47] will wash will have washed their robes
[1:04:49] in the blood of the lamb and will wind
[1:04:51] up at the great white throne judgment
[1:04:53] where they will finally be led to living
[1:04:57] waters
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; because they miss receiving the living
[1:05:01] waters of the Holy Ghost. And so, you
[1:05:04] know, it was it's with such a great
[1:05:07] deception and it's not going to be a few
[1:05:10] deceived, but the Bible said all the
[1:05:13] world will wonder after the beast in his
[1:05:15] image. And so there will be those um
[1:05:19] that that are redeemed in and Joel
[1:05:22] chapter 2 speaks of it of the remnant
[1:05:24] that the Lord thy God shall call that in
[1:05:27] in Mount Zion which is the bride in the
[1:05:30] remnant which thou the Lord thy shall
[1:05:33] God shall call and of course in Israel.
[1:05:36] So we know then there are three places
[1:05:39] where there is going to be salvation in
[1:05:42] this day. And and when I say that there
[1:05:46] will be a bride who will go on a
[1:05:48] rapture. There will be a church who will
[1:05:51] go through tribulation wind up there at
[1:05:54] the white throne judgment judged
[1:05:56] according to the deeds done in their
[1:05:57] bodies. And then there will be the
[1:06:00] 144,000, the Jews, the remnant, the
[1:06:02] leftovers of the Jews that will be
[1:06:05] redeemed and sealed by the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:08] And they will be in the millennium
[1:06:10] together with the bride as we rule and
[1:06:12] reign with Christ during the thousand
[1:06:14] years. And and it is because though of
[1:06:17] the deception that we have mass numbers
[1:06:21] that will actually miss the rapture and
[1:06:25] will go through the tribulation and will
[1:06:29] wind up at the white throne judgment
[1:06:32] judged according to the deeds done in
[1:06:34] their bodies or what they've done with
[1:06:37] with with Christ. And and so now as we
[1:06:41] look at this, I want to think of this
[1:06:44] because the original meaning of the new
[1:06:48] birth, to be born of the water and the
[1:06:52] spirit, verse five up here, was lost in
[1:06:55] the dark ages. As light began to break
[1:06:59] forth into reformation,
[1:07:02] restoration
[1:07:03] came in portions of justification,
[1:07:07] sanctification, gifts of the spirit. Yet
[1:07:10] none of it was the fullness of Pentecost
[1:07:13] as in Acts two where the believer was
[1:07:16] indwelt with Christ himself. Now, and
[1:07:21] the and the source of confusion today
[1:07:24] is is um here here's where it multiplies
[1:07:28] in our age that there are multitudes
[1:07:32] justified and sanctified and have indeed
[1:07:36] received works of the spirit. Others are
[1:07:40] even anointed, baptized with the spirit
[1:07:43] upon their flesh, even perform miracles,
[1:07:46] prophesying,
[1:07:48] demonstrating signs and wonders, yet
[1:07:51] their lives remain unchanged.
[1:07:54] They live in sin, still unconverted and
[1:07:57] still unsealed.
[1:07:59] and and the spirit may touch them and
[1:08:02] they may even have various degrees of
[1:08:04] sanctification, you know, uh and and God
[1:08:08] might even use them or anoint them, but
[1:08:11] they still lack the token, the literal
[1:08:14] life of Christ dwelling within them. Now
[1:08:18] at originally at Pentecost, the Holy
[1:08:20] Spirit fell and the church was alive
[1:08:24] with unity and simplicity and and
[1:08:27] dynamic power. And the believers, they
[1:08:30] shared all things in common. And the the
[1:08:33] apostles went from house to house
[1:08:35] breaking bread. And the spirit moved
[1:08:37] mightily among them. But it wasn't long
[1:08:40] Satan come along and quickly sewed
[1:08:43] murmuring in the church, you know, and
[1:08:46] and there was division among them. And
[1:08:49] there was Pharisees which believe people
[1:08:51] that were still hanging on to their old
[1:08:54] denominational
[1:08:55] uh uh Phariseic ways and and the law and
[1:09:00] not a and not walking in the spirit and
[1:09:04] and soon it was the slaves and the poor
[1:09:07] as we have been through and brother
[1:09:09] Bradam talks about this in the second
[1:09:11] seal. You can go read that, listen to
[1:09:13] it. It's great. Uh where he describes
[1:09:16] this that the slaves and the poor, those
[1:09:18] that were first received the spirit,
[1:09:20] they went out testifying everywhere. And
[1:09:24] and they testified even to their masters
[1:09:27] who saw a change in their life. And and
[1:09:29] when they the dignitaries, the military
[1:09:34] leaders, the wealthy began to take
[1:09:36] notice of all of these great miracles
[1:09:39] and and and they saw even the changed
[1:09:43] lives of their of these these poor and
[1:09:46] even some of the them were slaves. Well,
[1:09:49] they too embraced Christianity.
[1:09:53] Yet they could not humble themselves to
[1:09:55] worship in a dimly lit room with
[1:09:58] clapping of hands and speaking in other
[1:10:01] tongues and appearing like drunk men as
[1:10:04] they did in Acts chapter 2. And so you
[1:10:07] know what they did? They sought to dress
[1:10:10] it up.
[1:10:12] And they reasoned, if we're going to win
[1:10:14] the world, we must refine this movement.
[1:10:18] And this reasoning birthed the deeds of
[1:10:22] the nickelatans
[1:10:24] uh to to conquer the leoty to build a
[1:10:27] separate priesthood to model the church
[1:10:31] after pagan systems
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; and or or even even the the Old
[1:10:38] Testament system of the law and its
[1:10:40] priesthood and its temples and the glory
[1:10:44] of all of that and and and they would
[1:10:46] try to model it toward a separate
[1:10:49] priesthood. Now, so as we as we look at
[1:10:53] this, I wanted just to see that there
[1:10:56] was a desire to dress it up. You see,
[1:11:00] from from the earliest days, there's
[1:11:02] been a human tendency to dress up God's
[1:11:06] plan, to make it more refined and and to
[1:11:10] make it more respectable, to make it
[1:11:13] more acceptable to the world. But every
[1:11:17] time the church tries to adorn the
[1:11:19] gospel with human wisdom, it always ends
[1:11:22] up watering it down.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; And so what what began as a fire then
[1:11:27] becomes form. And what began as an
[1:11:30] experience, it become a ritual run by
[1:11:34] man. And then you know the second or
[1:11:36] third generation are no longer sons of
[1:11:38] God. They're grandchildren
[1:11:41] of the movement. And and so you know
[1:11:44] this this um Paul warned of this drift,
[1:11:48] you know, when he said, "Beware lest any
[1:11:50] man spoil you through philosophy and
[1:11:54] vain deceit and traditions of man after
[1:11:56] the rudiments of the world and not after
[1:11:59] Christ." So he warned them of that. And
[1:12:01] of course Jesus rebuked Ephesus for
[1:12:04] allowing these deeds to come to creep
[1:12:07] in. And he said, "But this thou hast
[1:12:08] that thou hatest the deeds of the
[1:12:10] nicicoatans which I also hate." Now they
[1:12:13] hated it. They didn't like it. But they
[1:12:16] allowed it to slowly creep in. Why?
[1:12:20] Because the spirit of nickelanism
[1:12:23] despises the humility of God's way. And
[1:12:27] true Christianity looks foolish to the
[1:12:30] carnal mind, shouting, weeping, speaking
[1:12:32] in tongues, staggering under the spirit.
[1:12:34] You know, but what the world mocks as
[1:12:38] weakness, God calls his wisdom and
[1:12:42] power.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; So you see what man calls wisdom, God
[1:12:48] calls foolishness. And what the world
[1:12:50] says is foolish, God said that's where
[1:12:53] my wisdom is. So soon the nickel leotans
[1:12:57] took away the Pentecostal experience and
[1:13:01] replace it with something that was
[1:13:03] imparted by the priest and bishops. So
[1:13:08] now as we look at this that we know that
[1:13:11] there was then a shift toward priesthood
[1:13:14] power as the centuries passed the church
[1:13:18] institutionalized the new birth and the
[1:13:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And by the
[1:13:23] second to through the fourth century,
[1:13:25] the outpouring of the spirit was no
[1:13:27] longer expected as a spontaneous
[1:13:30] experience. It was tied to the sacrament
[1:13:33] of confirmation
[1:13:35] and only bishops later priests could
[1:13:38] administer. Now confirmation is where
[1:13:41] they lay hands on you and say words over
[1:13:44] you and that's the Holy Ghost. So the
[1:13:47] Holy Ghost then became the in the power
[1:13:51] of the priesthood.
[1:13:53] The church held the power to remit sin
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; or or to retain sin.
[1:14:02] So now again, you know, thus instead of
[1:14:05] the spirit falling on all flesh, as Joel
[1:14:07] 2:28 fulfilled in Acts 2, the the church
[1:14:10] claimed that only the the clergy had
[1:14:14] authority to impart the spirit and this
[1:14:16] centralized spiritual power into the
[1:14:19] hands of a holy priesthood creating a
[1:14:22] divide between the clergy and the leoty.
[1:14:26] And this is exactly what Jesus condemned
[1:14:30] the deeds of the nic as the deeds of the
[1:14:32] nicicoatans. As you know, nicl mean
[1:14:34] needs to conquer. Leotans means the
[1:14:36] leoty and a system where the leoty could
[1:14:40] no longer have free access to the spirit
[1:14:45] but had to receive him through the a
[1:14:47] control of an elevated class of men.
[1:14:51] So you see the church would impart
[1:14:53] salvation
[1:14:55] uh through baptism. When you were
[1:14:57] sprinkled as a baby, you were
[1:14:59] automatically now born again. And then
[1:15:03] so that it it born again now takes on a
[1:15:06] new meaning. It's no longer what
[1:15:09] happened in Acts two.
[1:15:12] It now becomes something controlled by
[1:15:16] priests and bishops
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; who administer and give it to who they
[1:15:22] want to holding the power to hold it
[1:15:25] from those they don't want to have it.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; So unless you belong to them,
[1:15:31] you can't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:34] So by shifting the focus from a direct
[1:15:37] outpouring of the Holy Spirit to a
[1:15:40] ritual controlled by priests, the church
[1:15:43] effectively took Pentecost out of the
[1:15:46] people's hands
[1:15:48] and made the spirit subject to
[1:15:51] institutional control and substituted
[1:15:54] then. Well, I want you to watch this
[1:15:55] word because we're going to key on it.
[1:15:57] substitute substituted sacramental
[1:16:01] ceremony for a genuine new birth.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Now, so in short, what happened was
[1:16:09] the Catholic confirmation shifted the
[1:16:12] impart impartation of the spirit from
[1:16:14] the upper room experience into the hands
[1:16:17] of a of of a hierarchial um priesthood.
[1:16:21] And this institutional control fulfilled
[1:16:24] the prophecy of the nickelans conquering
[1:16:26] the ley removing the freedom of the
[1:16:28] spirits I porn that marked the original
[1:16:31] church. So by the second age of Smyrna
[1:16:34] the root of bitterness had defiled many.
[1:16:39] Now Smyrna the word smrna for the second
[1:16:42] church age it means bitterness and it
[1:16:45] comes from the word myrr. And so we see
[1:16:48] the Ephesian age had already began to
[1:16:52] drift. They had aimed at the high
[1:16:55] calling and relaxed.
[1:16:58] They were already allowing Nikicoat and
[1:17:01] his men even though there was an element
[1:17:03] of believers that hated it.
[1:17:07] Now watch. I want you to see this that
[1:17:11] by Smyrna the root of bitterness was
[1:17:14] already beginning to spring up and began
[1:17:16] to defile many and it would wound up
[1:17:19] defiling the whole church.
[1:17:22] Why? Because the majority wanted to push
[1:17:26] the Holy Spirit,
[1:17:29] its leadership in the church and replace
[1:17:32] it with the rule of man.
[1:17:35] And they long for a priesthood. I want
[1:17:37] you to listen. They wanted, remember
[1:17:40] brother Brandham always talking about
[1:17:41] how Israel wanted a king be like all the
[1:17:45] other nations. Well, this was the same
[1:17:47] thing even with Moses. You know, brother
[1:17:50] Brandham said grace had brought them
[1:17:51] out. Grace had given them a prophet.
[1:17:53] Grace had but they wanted a law,
[1:17:56] right? So they asked for a law, for a
[1:18:01] priesthood to mediate between them and
[1:18:04] God. And God allowed them to have it
[1:18:07] just like he allowed them to have a
[1:18:09] king.
[1:18:10] Now, I want you to watch this because
[1:18:13] they long for a priesthood like Israel
[1:18:16] of old rejecting the the spirit's
[1:18:20] freedom and and the pagan religion and
[1:18:22] and and their temples. They all had holy
[1:18:26] priests, beautiful temples, sacred
[1:18:30] rituals. Oh, all the pomp, the parade.
[1:18:34] Oh, the things the fine dress uh the the
[1:18:37] the vast richness and and and so they
[1:18:41] could it just became more platable to
[1:18:44] them. They they could easily accept
[1:18:47] Christianity when it was mixed with
[1:18:51] pagan ways.
[1:18:54] And thus began the Nicoladan spirit.
[1:18:57] Nikode means to conquer the ley and they
[1:18:59] wanted a ruling clergy and and it soon
[1:19:02] produced bitterness that brought the
[1:19:04] church onto bondage. Now brother
[1:19:06] Brandham taught this in the Smyrnian
[1:19:08] church age where he said now this now
[1:19:10] sma means bitterness and it comes from
[1:19:13] my the first church age had lost their
[1:19:15] first love. the Ephesian church. And
[1:19:18] this church had begun to have a root of
[1:19:20] bitterness coming up in them because
[1:19:23] that this church, the main church, the
[1:19:26] big part, the majority of them always
[1:19:28] was hammering
[1:19:30] against the Holy Ghost ruling in the
[1:19:34] church. And they wanted to rule
[1:19:36] themselves. And they wanted to set up a
[1:19:38] priesthood. They wanted to act like Old
[1:19:41] Testament people did. They wanted
[1:19:45] priests.
[1:19:47] So, you know, it it didn't look good,
[1:19:50] you know,
[1:19:52] meeting in a little dimly lit place and
[1:19:55] caves and and and things like that. They
[1:19:58] they wanted majestic temples.
[1:20:01] They wanted pomp and parade and and and
[1:20:04] and dignitaries and important men and
[1:20:08] trained men.
[1:20:10] So you see it moved away from the spirit
[1:20:14] leadership. Listen, brother Brandham
[1:20:15] said, "This church had began to spring
[1:20:18] up a rooe of bitterness. It was bitter
[1:20:20] against those who wanted to continue on
[1:20:23] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:25] The love had faded away. They were
[1:20:27] beginning to swap it for creeds and
[1:20:29] denominations, getting away from the
[1:20:31] Holy Ghost leadership." Think of that.
[1:20:33] That's why the bitterness was in them.
[1:20:36] And now the bitterness started creeping
[1:20:38] in the second church a little more and
[1:20:40] it creeped right in because they were
[1:20:42] making a better church.
[1:20:45] They thought they were right there. They
[1:20:48] had something right here. They had
[1:20:50] something dignified. The great Roman
[1:20:53] people could come in. Why? They had a
[1:20:55] pope. They had great men and cardinals
[1:20:57] and so forth. And they dress fine. And
[1:20:59] they got away from all the noise
[1:21:04] and everything they had very quiet
[1:21:08] showed they were dying.
[1:21:12] Hello. Uh-huh. When you take the shout
[1:21:14] of the Holy Ghost, the shout of the king
[1:21:17] out of the church and the praise of God
[1:21:20] and the worship from the people.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're It shows you're dying.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Is a dead church. Amen. They were dying.
[1:21:30] So they got dignified and they made a
[1:21:32] better body. And the first thing you
[1:21:34] know, first thing up here, they had the
[1:21:36] whole thing in a big ecclesiastical
[1:21:38] denomination. The Roman Catholic, which
[1:21:41] means universal church, the Roman
[1:21:44] Catholic Church in the dark ages. And
[1:21:46] then they had dignitaries and they had
[1:21:49] class. So I want you to know they had
[1:21:53] they traded the moving of the spirit.
[1:21:58] They've prayed in it for oh more church
[1:22:02] order,
[1:22:04] dignity,
[1:22:07] away from all the noise,
[1:22:10] away from the Holy Spirit moving,
[1:22:13] making a better church dignified
[1:22:19] now.
[1:22:21] Oh, it was much prettier than when they
[1:22:24] used to stand on the street
[1:22:27] and and had to walk in sheep skins as
[1:22:29] goat skins and destitute and saw to
[1:22:32] sunder and laughed at made fun of as
[1:22:34] Paul said in Hebrews 11th chapter. Why
[1:22:36] this great big fine road church with
[1:22:39] underskirts on of all this stuff they
[1:22:41] wear like that sure look dignified
[1:22:43] father, reverend, doctor, father so and
[1:22:46] so. Oh, they could put on some real dog
[1:22:48] there. But you see, it was a hybrid
[1:22:50] thing. Hybrid. It didn't have any life
[1:22:52] in it. And they cannot go back no more.
[1:22:55] That's the reason they never rise. The
[1:22:57] Lutheran revival never did rise up. The
[1:23:00] Wesley revival never did rise again. The
[1:23:02] Nazarene revival never did rise again.
[1:23:05] Neither will the Pentecostal revival
[1:23:08] rise up again. Why? Because you killed
[1:23:10] it. You hybrid with the world with
[1:23:12] nicolate and idea, not let the Holy
[1:23:15] Ghost have its way. That's right. You
[1:23:18] hybrid the church and it can't breed
[1:23:20] itself back again. When you breed back,
[1:23:23] you get more Methodist, Baptist, breed
[1:23:26] Baptist back, get more Baptist,
[1:23:28] Catholic, breed back, gets more
[1:23:31] Catholic, same thing. You're selling off
[1:23:33] the ear. But let me tell you something.
[1:23:35] When the Holy Ghost comes back, it
[1:23:37] brings a new birth and new life.
[1:23:40] Conversion, baptism of the spirit brings
[1:23:43] the church back to itself again. puts
[1:23:46] life back in it.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see they they never rise
[1:23:52] again and and as he says these early
[1:23:55] bishops thought they were above the
[1:23:58] world. They told the people they could
[1:24:00] forgive sins upon confession of sins.
[1:24:04] You know they that never was the truth.
[1:24:06] They began to baptize infants in the
[1:24:09] second century. They actual pra they
[1:24:12] actually practice regenerational
[1:24:14] baptism. No wonder people are mixed up
[1:24:17] today. Well, what does that means? That
[1:24:19] means that the water changed you.
[1:24:22] Sprinkling holy water certainly on a
[1:24:25] baby made it born again.
[1:24:29] On a new convert, apostro sprinkle holy
[1:24:32] water that made it born again.
[1:24:35] You see they were if he said no wonder
[1:24:39] the people are mixed up today if they
[1:24:41] were so mixed up then
[1:24:45] look just the second century
[1:24:51] just the second century away from the
[1:24:54] upper room
[1:24:56] so close to Pentecost
[1:24:59] now they are in a most desperate
[1:25:01] condition being about 2,000 years away
[1:25:04] from the original truth. Oh church of
[1:25:06] God, there's only one hope. Get back to
[1:25:08] the word and stay with it.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; So he says in verse 14 of Revelation 2,
[1:25:15] thou hast them that hold the doctrine of
[1:25:17] Balum, who taught Bailac to cast the
[1:25:19] stumbling block before the children of
[1:25:21] of Israel to eat things sacrificed to
[1:25:23] idols. And so you can't have a nickelan
[1:25:27] setup in the church and not not have
[1:25:32] other doctrine come in too. Now let me
[1:25:35] back up for a minute. I I skipped
[1:25:36] something. Thou hast those that hold the
[1:25:39] doctrine of Balum who taught Bailac to
[1:25:42] cast a stumbling block before the
[1:25:44] children of Israel to eat things
[1:25:47] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[1:25:50] fornication. Now you see later on she's
[1:25:54] identified as the great Why?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; These fornications
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; her daughters are corrupted because they
[1:26:03] learn mama's ways.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And so why? Because of teaching them to
[1:26:11] commit fornication, spiritual
[1:26:13] fornication,
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; adultery on God's word.
[1:26:17] So you see now you can't have a nickelan
[1:26:20] setup in the church and not have this
[1:26:21] other doctrine the doctrine of balum
[1:26:23] come into if you take away from the word
[1:26:26] and the movement of the spirit as a
[1:26:28] means of worship they that worship me
[1:26:31] must worship me in spirit and truth then
[1:26:33] you have to give the people another form
[1:26:36] of worship as a substitute what's this
[1:26:39] word a substitute and substitution
[1:26:42] spells
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; bamism
[1:26:47] Now,
[1:26:48] so now we we find that there comes a
[1:26:55] let's see something here.
[1:26:59] All right. So, right there then we have
[1:27:02] then the rise of a of a substitute
[1:27:06] of a substitute um um of a substitute
[1:27:11] religion. now and the the nickelan
[1:27:14] age it it it wanted something different
[1:27:19] and they substituted the direct
[1:27:22] outpouring of the spirit with a ritual.
[1:27:25] Follow my thinking now. priest with
[1:27:28] Christian which means put Christ in
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; right Christian
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; infants and proelites claiming them to
[1:27:38] impart the new birth
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; they so that's what born again means
[1:27:42] just to be born in the church
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; be sprinkled by the priest bishops laid
[1:27:48] hands on to confer the Holy Ghost priest
[1:27:51] administered the eukarist that's the
[1:27:53] communion claiming they were imparting
[1:27:56] Christ himself self and they returned
[1:27:58] the salvation to a priesthood just under
[1:28:01] the Old Testament. And and so you see in
[1:28:03] the Old Testament the the blood of
[1:28:06] animals we remember now it provided a
[1:28:10] substitute.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; It was not the real thing. It was a
[1:28:14] cover until the real true lamb came.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; This is why John the Baptist message was
[1:28:23] so so pertinent. He said, "Look, the
[1:28:28] lamb of God." Oh, we already had the
[1:28:30] lamb.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; But that lamb that he had was a
[1:28:35] substitute.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came, he was the real
[1:28:40] lamb
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; that the others were substituting for.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Understand?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Now, so again, when Jesus came as the
[1:28:50] lamb of God that take away with the sin
[1:28:53] of the world, take away the sin of the
[1:28:55] world. No longer was the substitute
[1:28:59] accepted.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; You see, his blood was the fullness and
[1:29:05] the only cure for sin. Now, this is why
[1:29:08] multitudes go through the tribulation,
[1:29:10] multitudes wind up at the white throne
[1:29:12] judgment. Even though they had washed
[1:29:14] their robes in the blood of the lamb and
[1:29:16] made them white, they went through and
[1:29:18] they went through acts of washing, of
[1:29:21] purification, of sanctification.
[1:29:24] And they had they were they were had
[1:29:26] certain sanctified conditions, but think
[1:29:30] of this, they didn't have anything to
[1:29:33] get him in a rapture.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:29:42] when Jesus came, let me explain this. He
[1:29:46] was not a shadow. He was not a portion
[1:29:48] of truth.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh. In him dwelt
[1:29:52] all the fullness of the godhead bodily.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; When his blood was shed at Calvary, his
[1:29:57] very life was released and returned to
[1:30:00] the church as the Holy Ghost,
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; the fullness of God to dwell in his
[1:30:05] people. And we're in the hour, I want
[1:30:08] you to get this. This is key. We are in
[1:30:11] the hour where the fullness of the new
[1:30:14] birth has been restored. Yes.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; And it is mandatory
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; for the rapture
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; to have the the the the full birth in
[1:30:25] its fullness.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; The sealing of the spirit and its
[1:30:28] fullness corresponds with the fullness
[1:30:31] of the word.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Catch that. Down to the church ages,
[1:30:36] believers would receive a measure of the
[1:30:39] revealed word.
[1:30:41] And with that measure came a measure of
[1:30:45] the spirit
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; to quicken it. But the full sealing, the
[1:30:49] complete new birth could not return
[1:30:53] until the full word was restored in this
[1:30:56] last day.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so again, as we as we look at
[1:31:02] here, um the Bible said, "In whom you've
[1:31:05] also trusted that after watch now, after
[1:31:09] you have heard the word of truth, the
[1:31:12] gospel of your salvation, in whom also
[1:31:14] after you believe, you were sealed with
[1:31:18] the Holy Spirit of promise." So get the
[1:31:20] get this real clear. The Holy Spirit
[1:31:23] comes after you trust, after you've
[1:31:26] heard the word,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; after you a after you've heard the
[1:31:29] gospel of your salvation and after you
[1:31:32] believe you are sealed.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't come when you believe.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; It comes after you believe.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; This is consistent throughout the
[1:31:41] scripture. The spirit seals the revealed
[1:31:45] word.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Did you see that? In whom also you have
[1:31:49] believed, you receive the word of truth,
[1:31:50] the gospel of salvation. In whom you
[1:31:52] have
[1:31:54] also after you believe, you were sealed.
[1:31:56] So what? I want you to get this. The
[1:32:00] spirit seals the revealed word. As the
[1:32:04] word increases, the spirit's
[1:32:07] manifestation increases
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; until at last the whole word has been
[1:32:12] brought back and the bride is sealed in
[1:32:15] its fullness.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Now at the opening of the seven seals,
[1:32:19] brother Brandham told us the full word
[1:32:22] was born into manifestation. Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; So he said, so so again at the opening
[1:32:27] of the seals, Revelation 10, the
[1:32:29] mysteries hidden from the ages was
[1:32:32] unveiled and the whole word was born
[1:32:35] into manifestation again, vindicated by
[1:32:38] the spirit of God, operating at the same
[1:32:40] strength and doing the same thing it did
[1:32:42] in Jesus earthly ministry, making Jesus
[1:32:45] Christ the same yesterday, today and
[1:32:46] forever. That means the bride is not
[1:32:51] living on partial light. Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; But on the whole revealed word
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; and therefore the fullness of the
[1:32:59] spirit, fullness of the spirit comes to
[1:33:02] seal her. So as he said in whom you have
[1:33:05] trusted after you've heard the word of
[1:33:08] thy salvation, the gospel of your
[1:33:11] salvation in whom after you believe you
[1:33:14] were sealed. So notice the it is when
[1:33:17] the gospel is restored the seal comes.
[1:33:22] Amen.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; So there was again portions of the
[1:33:26] spirit
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; given down to the ages
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; according to the portion of the word
[1:33:33] that was received.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; But now in this day the full word has
[1:33:38] been born into manifestation and with it
[1:33:41] comes the seal of the spirit.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we need. The seal
[1:33:46] of the spirit that seals you to the day
[1:33:48] of redemption. So now this is a pattern
[1:33:51] in every age that Luther's age the
[1:33:53] revealed word of justification those who
[1:33:56] received it were quickened by the spirit
[1:33:58] to that measure.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; It only quickened them to that measure.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; All right. Wesley age the revealed word
[1:34:08] of sanctification the spirit empowered
[1:34:10] holiness and deeper concentr
[1:34:13] consecration. Watch now the same thing.
[1:34:16] It quickened them to that measure.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; In the Pentecostal age, we're talking
[1:34:21] about Isuza Street.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; The revealed word of the baptism of the
[1:34:25] Holy Ghost with gifts. The spirit gave
[1:34:28] power and manifestation. Watch. It
[1:34:32] empowered them
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; with a with a deeper a deeper experience
[1:34:37] even. But now this age, the full
[1:34:42] revealed word is restored in its
[1:34:44] fullness, bringing the token, the
[1:34:47] sealing spirit, the literal life of
[1:34:51] Christ indwelling the bride.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; That's where we are
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; now. So each age, each age's new birth
[1:35:01] corresponds with the measure of the
[1:35:04] revealed word for that age. Yes.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; And with each unveiling comes a greater
[1:35:11] manifestations of the spirit.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Now because Jesus said the spirit is the
[1:35:16] word. He said the words I speak to you,
[1:35:19] they are spirit and they are life. And
[1:35:21] the Holy Ghost quickens the word.
[1:35:23] Whatever manifestation
[1:35:26] of the word that God says to your age, I
[1:35:28] want you to get it. That is Jesus Christ
[1:35:32] to your age. Amen.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; I I don't want you to miss that point.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost quickens the word. And
[1:35:43] whatever manifestation of the word God
[1:35:46] sends to your age, that's Jesus Christ
[1:35:50] to your age.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Well, I've received Jesus. Okay. But
[1:35:55] have you received the Jesus for this
[1:35:58] age? Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; The fullness that he's pouring out
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; or are you rejecting it and only wanting
[1:36:05] a portion?
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Well, you only letting go so far.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; So, receiving the revealed word of your
[1:36:15] time is re is receiving Christ in
[1:36:18] himself. And let me say rejecting it is
[1:36:22] rejecting him. Yes.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Now, in this last days, friends, the
[1:36:29] full word has returned.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; That's what Malachi 4 was to do.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; And with it came the fullness of the
[1:36:36] spirit, no longer portions, no longer
[1:36:39] shadows. The bride of Christ now stands
[1:36:41] sealed with the token, not a partial
[1:36:43] birth, but the complete birth of the
[1:36:46] spirit.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; The same spirit, let me get this to you.
[1:36:49] The same spirit that walked in Jesus,
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; that walks in his body,
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; The same life that conquered death will
[1:36:59] then raise up the bride and mouth.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; So Luther had the word for his day. How
[1:37:04] many agrees with that?
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; He had the spirit for his day.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; You don't know Wesley had a greater
[1:37:10] portion of the word for his day and with
[1:37:13] it a greater portion of the spirit. And
[1:37:15] assuz of Pentecost had the word for its
[1:37:17] day and the spirit for in its day. But
[1:37:20] this bride, she has the full word. And
[1:37:23] with the full word comes the full
[1:37:25] spirit. Not a measure but the fullness
[1:37:28] of God indwelling his people, sealing
[1:37:31] them for rapture.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fullness of the word brings
[1:37:35] the fullness of the birth. has the
[1:37:38] complete revelation of the word has been
[1:37:40] restored in this age also too comes with
[1:37:43] it the fullness of the new birth
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; the pattern of the natural birth now
[1:37:48] we're going to find will will actually
[1:37:51] mirror
[1:37:53] the spiritual birth so let's look at
[1:37:55] this justification
[1:37:59] is like is like conception the seed of
[1:38:02] the word is planted the believer's sins
[1:38:06] are forgiven
[1:38:09] Sanctification is like gueststation,
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; growth, development of life implanted,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and I'm
[1:38:21] not talking about an anointing here,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; a spirit that comes and goes,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; but I'm talking about the indwelling is
[1:38:28] like the birth itself when the breath of
[1:38:30] life enters and the new creation comes
[1:38:33] forth. So you got you got these stages.
[1:38:36] You can't say, "Well, a baby's born and
[1:38:38] he's still in guestation." You can't
[1:38:41] say, "Well, baby's born and he's already
[1:38:44] he's just conceived."
[1:38:46] He's not born to win. The spirit of life
[1:38:48] enters into it.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:52] like the birth itself is when the breath
[1:38:54] of life enters and the new creation
[1:38:57] comes forth. So at the beginning of the
[1:39:00] Pentecostal revival, I want to just get
[1:39:03] it. The spirit hovered near.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; It was like the breath ready to enter
[1:39:11] the body.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; You ever hear brother Bradom talking
[1:39:15] about question answer 64 and he said
[1:39:17] when a baby's born, the mother gets real
[1:39:19] sweet. She could be as mean as whatever,
[1:39:21] but there's a sweet spirit. He said,
[1:39:22] "What is that little angel spirit about
[1:39:24] ready to come into that baby when it's
[1:39:26] born?"
[1:39:27] Well, that was Pentecost.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; that was Isuza Street. It was like the
[1:39:32] breath ready to enter the body. But only
[1:39:36] when the Holy Ghost himself breathes
[1:39:38] into a soul does that soul become a
[1:39:42] living spiritfilled child of God.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Now, so the breath of life equals
[1:39:49] the complete birth. This is why Jesus
[1:39:52] said and he told Nicodemus except a man
[1:39:56] be born of the water and the spirit. Did
[1:39:58] you how many noticed that when we were
[1:40:00] reading?
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus' first doctrine.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; And this is the first thing that come
[1:40:05] under attack
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; was how to be born again.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Because if you can keep children from
[1:40:12] coming to birth,
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; the church is dead.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So that's why Jesus
[1:40:18] told Nicodemus, "Except a man be born of
[1:40:21] the water and the spirit." You see, now
[1:40:24] conception and growth is vital,
[1:40:27] but the birth is not complete until the
[1:40:30] spirit's own life enters in.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; And when that happens, the believer does
[1:40:35] not merely have a doctrine of Christ.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; He has Christ himself living on the
[1:40:40] inside of him.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory. Now
[1:40:45] Jesus Christ the full word he released
[1:40:48] his full life and that life returned
[1:40:52] returns now not as a portion but as the
[1:40:56] Holy Ghost breathe into the believer
[1:40:58] producing the complete new birth. Now
[1:41:02] conception and growth lead to life.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But birth brings the child into
[1:41:11] manifestation.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. So with the church
[1:41:14] justification and sanctification
[1:41:17] prepares the vessel.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would call it in statue
[1:41:21] of perfect man building a tabernacle
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; for the living God to dwell in.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; So you see it prepares the vessel but
[1:41:30] only the Holy Ghost the breath of life
[1:41:33] can bring a believer in the full
[1:41:35] sunship.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:39] So justification is just a conception.
[1:41:42] You see sanctification grows it but only
[1:41:46] the Holy Ghost can bring forth bringeth
[1:41:49] forth alive. So as the spirit of God you
[1:41:53] know was breathed into Adam and he
[1:41:56] became a living soul. So Christ breathes
[1:41:59] into the bride. She becomes a full
[1:42:01] expression of his word. Not a partial
[1:42:04] birth
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; but the full birth of the spirit. Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; And on Pentecost, he came as a pillar of
[1:42:10] fire.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; He separated himself.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; He imparted a tongue of fire to every
[1:42:17] believer. And the church, it was born
[1:42:20] not by ritual.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; It was born by fire.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible said of his own will be daddy
[1:42:28] us with the word of truth. And that with
[1:42:31] that truth came an experience.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's just look just for a
[1:42:37] moment how that the church fell back
[1:42:40] into partial truth when the nickel
[1:42:44] spirit conquered the church drifted back
[1:42:47] to law and ritual and partial light.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Now and there became a substitute
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; priesthood. What's the words again?
[1:42:58] Substitute
[1:42:59] and they substitute birth.
[1:43:04] Now this nickelan age substituted the
[1:43:07] direct outpouring of the spirit with
[1:43:09] ritual. Priests, Christian infants and
[1:43:12] procelites claiming to impart the new
[1:43:15] birth by baptism sprinkling. Bishops
[1:43:19] laid their hands on them to confer the
[1:43:22] Holy Ghost. Priests administered the
[1:43:25] communion, the Eucharist as though they
[1:43:27] were imparting Christ himself. What
[1:43:30] happened?
[1:43:32] This returns salvation to a priesthood
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; just as just as under the Old Testament,
[1:43:40] but it was only a partial word, a shadow
[1:43:43] of substitute. So now in the in in the
[1:43:46] medieval um system, the Eucharist was
[1:43:49] taught as the actual body and blood of
[1:43:52] the Lord. They they believed by taking
[1:43:55] this bread and wine and saying their
[1:43:57] words over it, making their prayers and
[1:43:59] sprinkling their waters. They actually
[1:44:01] turned that back to Jesus on flesh and
[1:44:04] blood.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; And only a consecrated priest had the
[1:44:08] power to consecrate the wine and the
[1:44:11] bread and and then they would lift it up
[1:44:14] and distribute it to the faithful. And
[1:44:17] this effectively turned communion into
[1:44:21] priest controlled pipeline of grace as
[1:44:24] though Christ himself could only be
[1:44:26] given through a through the hand of the
[1:44:28] clergy.
[1:44:30] And this mirrors the old covenant where
[1:44:33] priests handled the sacred offerings,
[1:44:36] sprinkled the blood,
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; presented the sacrifices on the behalf
[1:44:40] of the people.
[1:44:42] You see, this practice moves salvation
[1:44:46] out of direct faith in Christ and back
[1:44:49] into the hands of a human priesthood.
[1:44:52] Instead of believers directly receiving
[1:44:55] the Holy Ghost by the spirit or Christ
[1:44:58] by the spirit, the the priest then was
[1:45:01] seen as the mediator.
[1:45:03] So in the Old Testament only the high
[1:45:06] priest could enter the holiest of holies
[1:45:09] once a year
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; with the blood. The pre the people
[1:45:14] could not approach.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; They stayed in the outer courts and they
[1:45:18] could not come near. The priesthood
[1:45:21] stood between God and the people and
[1:45:23] they dispended they dispense grace
[1:45:27] through rituals.
[1:45:30] So under the Catholic sacramentalism,
[1:45:33] the priest became the new high priest
[1:45:36] figure.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; He handled the body and the blood. He
[1:45:39] heard confessions. He imparted
[1:45:42] absolution which means freedom from
[1:45:45] guilt and he salv administered salvation
[1:45:49] through through a ritual. But let me
[1:45:52] tell you something friends. The new
[1:45:55] covenant, when the gospel is restored,
[1:45:58] the new covenant turns this system
[1:46:00] upside down.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; When Jesus died, the veil of the temple
[1:46:07] was rent and twain.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did it do? It signified that
[1:46:13] access to God was open for all.
[1:46:18] Everybody, anybody can come in
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; and that Christ himself is our only
[1:46:23] mediator
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; because the Bible said there is one God
[1:46:26] and what mediator between God and man
[1:46:29] and that's the man Christ Jesus
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; and now through Christ's blood. Are you
[1:46:34] listening?
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Through Christ's blood, every believer
[1:46:37] you this morning have direct access
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; to the throne of grace
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus. The Bible said
[1:46:45] you have therefore boldness to enter
[1:46:49] into the holiest of holies by the blood
[1:46:52] of Jesus.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That you as lively stones are
[1:46:56] built up as a spiritual house. You see u
[1:47:00] to offered spiritual sacrifices and
[1:47:03] you're a holy priesthood
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; and and the Bible said you are a chosen
[1:47:08] generation, a royal priesthood. And
[1:47:11] under the new covenant, the whole church
[1:47:14] is the priesthood.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No believers has to stand at
[1:47:19] a distance.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; All are invited
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; to come in the holiest of holies. Your
[1:47:25] prayers mean as much to God as any
[1:47:27] preachers's prayer.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; You have access to the throne. You don't
[1:47:31] have to go through a preacher to get it.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have access to the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:36] You don't have to go through a preacher
[1:47:38] to get it. You have a right to your own
[1:47:41] acts two experience. You don't have to
[1:47:44] have a preacher to impart it to you.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; You don't have to belong to his church.
[1:47:48] You don't have to belong to his
[1:47:49] organization. You don't have to belong
[1:47:51] to to him at all. You have to belong to
[1:47:53] Christ.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Now, why does this matter? You see, to
[1:47:59] treat the communion, salvation,
[1:48:00] remittance of sin as a priest control
[1:48:03] impartation of Christ reverses the new
[1:48:07] covenant pattern.
[1:48:09] It places the the believer back under a
[1:48:12] human mediator
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; and so the veil is still up. Let me tell
[1:48:16] you friends, the veil the veil has been
[1:48:21] ripped.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; The veil that kept you out.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. The message, the gospel return
[1:48:32] rips the veil.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; That's what this message did for us. It
[1:48:36] ripped the veil of traditions.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; And it made an access where anybody
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; any one of you
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; could receive the same Acts two
[1:48:47] experience.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; So the true covenant of the gospel is
[1:48:54] not a sacrament dispensed but the person
[1:48:56] of Christ that is received by faith and
[1:49:00] sealed by the spirit and living inside
[1:49:02] the believer.
[1:49:03] Excuse me.
[1:49:07] So through the ages,
[1:49:09] God has sent portions of truth.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Luther restored justification by faith.
[1:49:15] Yet salvation soon became tied to church
[1:49:19] creeds and rituals.
[1:49:22] Wesley pressed deeper with
[1:49:24] sanctification,
[1:49:25] but it still moved under church forms
[1:49:28] and priestly controls.
[1:49:31] Pentecost restored the baptism of the
[1:49:33] Holy Spirit as an anointing with gifts.
[1:49:36] But yet it became a substitute when
[1:49:39] salvation was reduced to a manifestation
[1:49:43] like tongues often taught by men instead
[1:49:48] of sovereignly given by the spirit.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Think of that. These were glorious
[1:49:55] restorations,
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; but they were all partial. Amen.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; And they worked for their time just as
[1:50:04] animal blood worked until the true lamb
[1:50:08] came.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; But substitutes
[1:50:12] cannot cure sin. They only cover it.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; You see, it'll treat sin, but it will
[1:50:22] not Are you with me? It will not cure
[1:50:24] sin. That's right.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, the gospel
[1:50:28] we have today that's been restored by
[1:50:30] the message of Malachi 4 is not a a
[1:50:34] treatment for sin. It is a sin cure.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:50:45] this is the problem with
[1:50:46] denominationalism. They are treatment
[1:50:48] centers for sin.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Try this. Maybe you'll get a little
[1:50:55] better. Well, try that. Here's a little
[1:50:58] psychology. Or, you know, here, practice
[1:51:01] this, you know, for your temper. You
[1:51:04] know, not a string so many times, you
[1:51:06] know, before you explode.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; All kinds of little tricks and gimmicks
[1:51:12] and whatever else,
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; but no cures.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; But you see, we are in the day of the
[1:51:18] restoration of the token. Today God has
[1:51:21] restored the original gospel in his
[1:51:23] fullness. And this is not justification
[1:51:26] by confession. Is not sanctification
[1:51:28] reduced to social reform. Nor is it
[1:51:31] Pentecostal gifts as evidence. It is the
[1:51:34] indwelling of the spirit himself.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Christ incarnating
[1:51:39] his bride just as he did in the book of
[1:51:42] Acts.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; And Paul declared Christ in you the hope
[1:51:45] of glory. You see, this is the token,
[1:51:48] the very life of Christ applied to the
[1:51:50] believer, not as a ritual, not as a
[1:51:53] substitute, but the supreme evidence
[1:51:55] that the blood has been accepted.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; It is the token.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; It's what's needed for the rapture.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; So, we'll just look at the contrast for
[1:52:05] a minute. The Old Testament law gave his
[1:52:07] shadow a substitute lamb. Jesus was a
[1:52:09] true lamb. He brought a new birth by the
[1:52:12] life of the blood returning at
[1:52:15] Pentecost. The dark ages returned to
[1:52:19] ritual and priesthood. The reformation
[1:52:21] gave portions of truth
[1:52:24] as substitutes.
[1:52:27] Remember, just like the substitute lamb,
[1:52:30] it would be a lamb. It would be blood,
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; but it was only to work until what it
[1:52:36] was speaking of came. Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; But at the evening time, it restores the
[1:52:42] fullness of the word and the spirit
[1:52:44] together. The fullness is here again
[1:52:46] because why? He says at the evening time
[1:52:49] it shall be light. You see now, no more
[1:52:52] bitterness, no more partial covering, no
[1:52:54] more substitute. Only a bride filled
[1:52:57] with the Holy Ghost and standing in the
[1:52:59] light of the revealed word. You see, we
[1:53:02] don't need substitutes.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; It needs the real.
[1:53:07] But what happened right after in Acts
[1:53:09] chapter 15? What did they do? They tried
[1:53:12] to get them to go back to substitutes
[1:53:15] again
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; were Pharisees who believed insisted
[1:53:18] that they be circumcised as the law of
[1:53:21] Moses said. And that was only a
[1:53:23] substitute to work until the real circum
[1:53:27] circumcision came which was circumcised
[1:53:29] the heart. And he that has the
[1:53:32] circumcision of the heart needs not have
[1:53:34] the flesh to be circumcised.
[1:53:37] the truth.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; No more than what we need to go get a
[1:53:40] lamb and offer it on an altar and take
[1:53:42] that woolly lamb and let it bleed and
[1:53:44] die and what it's it's in vain.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; It won't save you.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Only the true lamb will save.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Now this age does not need substitute.
[1:54:00] We need the real.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; It does not need ritual. It needs fire.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; It doesn't need a priesthood that
[1:54:09] imparts a ritual. It needs Christ in the
[1:54:12] believer.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; The token applied.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; His life is an evidence in your life.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Now, so soon what we saw was substitutes
[1:54:24] that were given to
[1:54:28] for a genuine experience. So, brother
[1:54:31] Brandon would talk about this. He said,
[1:54:32] "Let's go down. When I was ordained in
[1:54:34] the Baptist church, let's take us
[1:54:36] Baptist.
[1:54:38] The Methodists, what did we do? If thou
[1:54:40] wil confess Jesus Christ is the son of
[1:54:43] God, you are saved.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; The devil believes he he's the son of
[1:54:48] God and trembles at it and probably
[1:54:49] believes it more than a lot of church
[1:54:51] member does. The believer, the devil
[1:54:53] believes the same thing and trembles
[1:54:55] because he knows he's doing.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:00] So they watch now what they did. They
[1:55:04] offer a substitute of confession.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Joining a church, becoming a member,
[1:55:17] saying I believe. Are you with me?
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; We're going to deal with this.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon says why we're not a
[1:55:24] denomination. So your creeds and
[1:55:26] denomination has barred God away like
[1:55:29] that. We believe this and we believe the
[1:55:30] days of miracles have passed. It's a
[1:55:32] false prophet that says that.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; It's a false prophet that tells you that
[1:55:38] you can shake hands and receive the Holy
[1:55:40] Ghost.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; It's a false prophet that tells you you
[1:55:43] receive the Holy Ghost when you believe.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Now they may even say, "Well, when you
[1:55:49] believe the message, you got it." That's
[1:55:51] a false prophet.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:55:53] It isn't about it. It is certainly you
[1:55:56] have to believe. You must believe. But
[1:55:58] I'm telling you, there is a deception in
[1:56:00] this last day
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; of easy belieism.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; And it is not the bride's message. It is
[1:56:07] Solver's message.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; It will save Lot out of Sodom,
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; but it will not produce the body change
[1:56:16] for Abraham and Sarah.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. You see the deception of easy
[1:56:25] belieism. You see Billy Graham blinded
[1:56:28] the eyes and deceived millions
[1:56:36] with this.
[1:56:39] And today I want I it's sad to say but
[1:56:42] we're facing a form of easy belieism of
[1:56:45] Baptist approach
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; that has crept into the very ranks of
[1:56:50] the message
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; and it says the new birth is nothing
[1:56:54] more than believing the word just just
[1:56:57] believe receive the message and by
[1:56:58] believing it you have the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:00] They teach that the spirit comes quietly
[1:57:05] without knowing it and without feeling,
[1:57:08] without sensation.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham never taught that.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; So, well, it's a restored truth, mystery
[1:57:16] truth. Brother Tim, he told us that in
[1:57:18] services at the time. He did not.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; That is not what he said. He said we
[1:57:24] have today the Holy Ghost without
[1:57:27] sensation
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; but the person of Christ
[1:57:32] dwelling within you
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; doing the same works that he did.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; He says in the seals sensations it's not
[1:57:43] it but yet it comes with it. Amen.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to talk about this for
[1:57:48] a moment because this is a lie that has
[1:57:52] been recycled and parited from a
[1:57:55] backsliden message rejector who once
[1:57:58] claimed we received the Holy Ghost like
[1:58:00] Mary received it. And that's without
[1:58:02] sensation.
[1:58:05] Well, let's let's look at that. When
[1:58:08] Mary conceived Christ, she was indeed
[1:58:11] overshadowed by the Holy Spirit. But
[1:58:15] that was not the baptism of the Holy
[1:58:17] Ghost.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; But it was the miracle of conception.
[1:58:20] And and of course it came without sexual
[1:58:24] sensation. It was a virgin birth.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:58:29] But when Mary received the Holy Ghost
[1:58:31] for herself,
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; it was on the day of Pentecost and she
[1:58:36] was among the 120 and she received it
[1:58:39] the same way they did with a rushing
[1:58:41] mighty wind with tongues of fire with
[1:58:42] tongues of speech and with such power
[1:58:44] that men thought they were drunk.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; And to say she received it without
[1:58:50] sensation is a twisting of the truth.
[1:58:52] The overshadowing for conception is not
[1:58:55] the same as the indwelling for the new
[1:58:58] birth.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:59:05] brother Brandham said in the message,
[1:59:08] why you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:10] Ghost and you'll believe in God's power,
[1:59:12] you'll believe every word God says.
[1:59:13] You'll punctuate it with an amen to
[1:59:15] everything he talks to you. And then
[1:59:17] people don't sit there and say, "Well,
[1:59:18] Simon, I suppose I I guess it's all
[1:59:21] right, brother." When they got that,
[1:59:22] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:59:24] began to stagger like drunk men come and
[1:59:27] remember you Catholic person. The
[1:59:29] blessed virgin Mary was right there. And
[1:59:32] if God wouldn't let her come to heaven
[1:59:35] without she took the same prescription.
[1:59:37] How are you going to get there anything
[1:59:39] less? Some of you cold starch Pentecost
[1:59:42] or you cold starchy Baptist, you cold
[1:59:44] starchy Methodist. How are you going to
[1:59:46] get there? Anything less than that when
[1:59:49] even the mother of Jesus Christ had to
[1:59:52] go up there and get the same thing and
[1:59:54] stagger and I got you drunk. If that
[1:59:56] ain't the Bible, I ask any professor to
[1:59:58] come disprove it. That every time in the
[2:00:01] Bible they ever got the Holy Ghost, they
[2:00:04] acted exactly the same way they did
[2:00:06] there. that a prescription will take the
[2:00:10] same effect every time.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Now, so again, the Holy Ghost is not a
[2:00:20] sensation.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Let's get that proved down. It is not a
[2:00:24] feeling.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; It's not a chill.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; It's not a jump. It's not a shout. It's
[2:00:31] not goosebumps. It's not excitement.
[2:00:34] But when it comes, he brings a definite
[2:00:38] experience that you know.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:00:46] you want to talk about revelation for
[2:00:48] the last day. This is going to be the
[2:00:51] primary revelation
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; that you know.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Now, let's just look at this for a
[2:00:59] moment. Jesus Jesus said you shall
[2:01:03] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[2:01:06] has come on you. So now when the Holy
[2:01:09] Ghost comes we have overcoming power
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; overcoming life.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; We have power in the church because of
[2:01:17] the Holy Ghost.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; And Paul said the spirit itself beareth
[2:01:22] witness with our spirit that we are
[2:01:25] children of God.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Does that sound like something you don't
[2:01:28] know?
[2:01:30] Uh the spirit bears witness
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; that you're children of God.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Seeing you have purified
[2:01:39] your soul in obeying the truth through
[2:01:41] the spirit, it not only it not only that
[2:01:45] bears witness and gives power, but it
[2:01:48] purifies the soul."
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, here's key. At that day,
[2:01:54] you shall know that I'm in the Father
[2:01:56] and I am you and you and me.
[2:01:59] So you see he said you will know.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; He did not say you will guess it.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; He said at that day you will know that
[2:02:14] I'm in the father and I and you and you
[2:02:17] and ye in me and I in you. Now that is
[2:02:20] not uncertainty. That's revelation.
[2:02:23] When the Holy Ghost comes, he brings a
[2:02:26] knowledge that Christ himself has taken
[2:02:29] his place in you. Now, this scripture
[2:02:32] alone
[2:02:34] destroys the lie of an unconscious
[2:02:37] receiving of the spirit.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; If you if you can have the Holy Ghost
[2:02:41] and not know it, then Jesus words would
[2:02:43] fail. But his words cannot fail. He
[2:02:45] said, "You shall know." That's right.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; And the spirit's witness is not a
[2:02:51] passing emotion. It's the very certainty
[2:02:54] of God's indwelling.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; So hereby, he says, we know, look at
[2:03:00] this last verse, we know.
[2:03:03] Is everybody reading with me? We know
[2:03:06] that we dwell in him and he in us
[2:03:08] because he hath given us of his spirit.
[2:03:11] Yes.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; So you see it is something that we know.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; This is where he says ye shall know that
[2:03:20] I'm in the father and you in me and I in
[2:03:22] you. You see when
[2:03:26] so he says you will know that I am in my
[2:03:29] father. Let me break this down. This is
[2:03:32] teaching. This is Sunday school.
[2:03:35] When scripture calls God the father, it
[2:03:39] doesn't picture this fleshly father
[2:03:42] that's separate from the spirit.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; It reveals the eternal spirit, the
[2:03:48] father manifesting himself in the son
[2:03:52] and poured out as the holy ghost. Amen.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; So now the Holy Ghost brings us into
[2:04:00] union with the father through the son
[2:04:04] because you see you cannot come to the
[2:04:07] father except through the son.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; That's the only approach to the spirit
[2:04:14] God is through the man Christ Jesus
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; who where the spirit became flesh and
[2:04:21] dwelt among us.
[2:04:23] So Christ in the father, the eternal
[2:04:26] deity, he said, "Believest not that I am
[2:04:29] in the father
[2:04:32] and the father in me." Watch now he
[2:04:36] talks about a complete union. I am in
[2:04:38] the father and the father in me. The
[2:04:41] words I speak, I speak not of myself,
[2:04:45] but the father that dwelleth in me, he
[2:04:47] doeth the works. Believe me that I am in
[2:04:50] the father and the father in me.
[2:04:54] So now here again you see Christ in the
[2:04:58] father that's the eternal deity the
[2:05:00] spirit of God working through the flesh
[2:05:03] of his son
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; using the body the humanity of Christ in
[2:05:09] you the indwelling spirit you and Christ
[2:05:12] your life hidden in Christ
[2:05:16] that is the restored mystery of the new
[2:05:18] birth that Paul proclaimed Christ and
[2:05:20] you the hope of glory Now, you know, I I
[2:05:25] want to go on here just for a moment.
[2:05:27] Let's talk about the spirit of your
[2:05:28] father because I want you to understand
[2:05:31] the Holy Ghost is
[2:05:34] the spirit of the father.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; There are not three persons in the
[2:05:40] Godhead.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; There's one person.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; And God was manifested in Christ.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; He was revealed in Christ. So I want you
[2:05:49] to see for it is not Matthew 10:20. For
[2:05:53] it is not ye that speak, but the spirit
[2:05:55] of your father which speaketh in you.
[2:06:00] Watch now. The Holy Ghost spirit of the
[2:06:02] father. For the Holy Ghost shall teach
[2:06:05] you in that same hour what you ought to
[2:06:07] say.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; What he calls it here the spirit of the
[2:06:11] father. And then he calls it the Holy
[2:06:14] Ghost.
[2:06:16] And he will teach you in the same hour
[2:06:17] what you should say. The spirit of
[2:06:19] father speaketh in you. Watch now as we
[2:06:23] as we look at this. Jesus equates the
[2:06:27] spirit of your father with empower and
[2:06:29] presence speaking through his disciples.
[2:06:32] The father is the spirit. And and he
[2:06:35] says the holy ghost shall teach you in
[2:06:38] the same hour what you ought to say. So
[2:06:40] the the Holy Ghost is the spirit of the
[2:06:43] father is Christ in you is the spirit of
[2:06:46] God. Watch now. But you are not in the
[2:06:49] flesh but in the spirit is so that the
[2:06:51] spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any
[2:06:54] man have not the spirit of
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Christ
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; who?
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Christ. He's none of his.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:05] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[2:07:06] Jesus from the dead dwell in you,
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; it'll also quicken your mortal body.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; So he freely interchanges the spirit of
[2:07:15] God, spirit of Christ, spirit of him
[2:07:17] that raised up Jesus. It's the Holy
[2:07:19] Ghost is all the same. One spirit,
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one
[2:07:25] God, one father of us all.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; One spirit,
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; you can't divide him into three people.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:36] So
[2:07:38] it's I'm in the father, the father is in
[2:07:42] me, and I in you.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Can I say it this way? The same eternal
[2:07:47] spirit that was that Uh the father was
[2:07:51] in me and now he's coming in you.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:08:00] brother Brandham teaches us in Christ
[2:08:03] the mystery
[2:08:05] and he's and I'm going to
[2:08:08] catch it a little bit of this
[2:08:11] because it'll go with the subject.
[2:08:14] So many people get the wrong conception
[2:08:17] to convert people to Christianity and to
[2:08:20] his government is not God's thought at
[2:08:23] all.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; You say we make converts to Christianity
[2:08:28] by his governments. That's not it. Well,
[2:08:30] they're not supposed to drink. They're
[2:08:32] not supposed to lie. You know, that's
[2:08:33] often what we do. We tell people what
[2:08:35] they're not to do.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Don't do this. Don't do that. You know,
[2:08:38] we are trying to win them by the
[2:08:41] government, by the rules.
[2:08:43] Amen.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Real Christianity is not keeping rules.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's legislated by preacher or church
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; even if it's from the Bible.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Real Christianity is Christ in you.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Living himself out.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; His life living out in you.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Now notice God making himself known.
[2:09:11] Now, we're not supposed to make converts
[2:09:13] to Christianity by government, but by
[2:09:15] the revelation, the Christ in you as God
[2:09:18] was in Christ. As God was in Christ,
[2:09:21] Christ in you. When what God did in
[2:09:24] Christ, Christ does in you. What signs
[2:09:26] God did in Christ, Christ does in you.
[2:09:28] Oh, isn't that beautiful?
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; I like that. Now, watch this.
[2:09:36] Jesus said
[2:09:38] at that day
[2:09:41] that this day
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; why? Because we come back to restored
[2:09:49] gospel again.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; We come out from the law and his
[2:09:53] priesthood.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Out from substitutes, back to the
[2:09:57] reality again. Amen.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; And when we do, we come back to the
[2:10:02] scripture.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; And that day, that's this day.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Is the same as that day at Pentecost,
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; you will know I'm in the Father, the
[2:10:13] Father, and me, and I in you.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; At this day, when this revelation is
[2:10:21] made known, you will know I'm in the
[2:10:22] Father, the Father, and me, and I, and
[2:10:24] you, and you and me. And when the
[2:10:26] revelation is manifest at that day, you
[2:10:28] shall know that I'm the father one. I'm
[2:10:30] in the father and the father is in me.
[2:10:32] That when the revelation comes forth,
[2:10:34] then it's I and you and you in me.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; So
[2:10:42] we have the token the literal life of
[2:10:45] Christ
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; restored back again.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Not a substitute.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:10:52] And that's why that was a highlight of
[2:10:55] brother Brandham's ministry.
[2:10:58] He said, "My end time ministry is all
[2:11:00] wrapped up into this one thing
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; because it brings us back to the full
[2:11:06] new birth." You see, not a portion, not
[2:11:09] a substitute,
[2:11:11] but the spirit in its fullness bringing
[2:11:14] back the literal life of Christ into the
[2:11:17] believer. And of course, this will bring
[2:11:20] our full glorification, the change of
[2:11:23] our body. I I want you to catch the
[2:11:25] scripture because this is the mystery,
[2:11:30] the mystery of the new birth,
[2:11:33] the mystery of the token
[2:11:37] is what Paul is preaching here.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; And he says, and and I want to get it.
[2:11:44] It's this mystery that has been
[2:11:46] restored.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Even the mystery that's been hid from
[2:11:53] the ages. Now we can say the church ages
[2:11:56] now
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; and from generations but is now made
[2:12:00] manifest to saints to whom God would
[2:12:03] make known what is the riches of the
[2:12:06] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[2:12:08] which is Christ in you.
[2:12:14] Don't mention the hope of glory.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; So when the church returns back to the
[2:12:24] token of the literal life of Christ
[2:12:27] being back in the believer, not a
[2:12:29] portion, not a substitute, then that
[2:12:32] returns us to having the hope of glory.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; What glory? What's that talking about?
[2:12:40] Well, the hope of glory that the
[2:12:43] glorious condition of the blessedness
[2:12:45] into which is appointed and promised
[2:12:47] that true Christians enter after their
[2:12:50] savior's return from heaven. So again,
[2:12:53] Paul reveals the heart of the mystery
[2:12:56] for the ages. This is the heart of the
[2:13:00] mystery. This is the climax of brother
[2:13:03] Brandon's ministry.
[2:13:07] Every thing pointing to this one thing,
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; you must have the token, the literal
[2:13:14] life of Christ.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; This mystery which has been hid from the
[2:13:19] ages and from generation. But now
[2:13:24] evening like tabernacle has been
[2:13:26] manifested, revealed, made known again
[2:13:30] to you in this last day
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; where you can have more than a portion
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; of the word and a portion of the spirit
[2:13:39] to go with it. But the fullness of the
[2:13:41] word and the fullness of its power,
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost itself, the person
[2:13:47] returning to live in the believer.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that ought to make up every
[2:13:52] one of you.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; And this is not just a doctrine. It's
[2:14:00] not a moral influence. It is Christ
[2:14:03] himself indwelling the believer.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; It is a guarantee
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; of the future glory.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; The phrase the hope of glory means more
[2:14:16] than simply going to heaven. That's
[2:14:18] right.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; It points to the glorious state of
[2:14:21] transformation promised to every true
[2:14:23] believer. The body change at Christ's
[2:14:26] return.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Christ in you gives you hope for the
[2:14:33] body change.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Without Christ in you, you have no hope.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; For the body change.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I've got a portion of the spirit
[2:14:44] is not hope for the change. It'll get
[2:14:47] you in the tribulation.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; It'll get you in the white throne
[2:14:52] judgment.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll be granted life there and
[2:14:56] be led to fountains of living water.
[2:15:00] But watch
[2:15:02] only the token
[2:15:04] gives you the hope
[2:15:07] of glory.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Now watch.
[2:15:13] See what I did? Put it somewhere. There
[2:15:16] it is.
[2:15:20] If I'm lost, I'm lost in the spirit.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Watch now. Who shall change our vile
[2:15:26] body
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; that it may be fashioned like his
[2:15:30] glorious body?
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; What? We're going to be glorified
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; with what glory? A body like his. Amen.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; A body that never smoked, never drank,
[2:15:44] never lied, never cussed, never come on.
[2:15:46] Can't have a heartache.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is timeless, eternal.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. And when he
[2:15:54] shall appear, we shall be like him.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; For we shall see him as he is.
[2:16:02] This future glorification is guaranteed
[2:16:05] because the earnest the down payment is
[2:16:09] already
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; in us.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; So the token is like purchasing a a
[2:16:17] ticket to go on airplane.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is a guarantee.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That I'm going I have a right to
[2:16:26] get on that plane.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; My purchase is paid.
[2:16:31] I have a seat reserved.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, DI can leave you behind, but
[2:16:37] this plane can't leave a one of his
[2:16:40] behind.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Because when he comes, he seals you to
[2:16:44] the day of redemption, which is the day
[2:16:47] of your body changed.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; There is nothing can happen between you
[2:16:52] and there that can keep you out of the
[2:16:54] rapture. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:05] After you believed, you were sealed with
[2:17:07] that Holy Spirit of promise, which is
[2:17:10] the earnest of our inheritance until the
[2:17:13] redemption
[2:17:14] of the purchased possession. And you are
[2:17:16] the purchased possession,
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; not fully redeemed yet, because your
[2:17:21] body still needs redemption.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; But you have a down payment.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; And that means that your soul is already
[2:17:31] glorified,
[2:17:33] but you're about to receive a body that
[2:17:35] matches your soul.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And our hope of
[2:17:41] glorification, the rapture rest on this
[2:17:44] fact. The token, the literal life of
[2:17:47] Christ has been restored. Not a
[2:17:50] substitute, not a ritual, but the person
[2:17:53] of Christ living in the believer.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. Not just a jumpish shout
[2:17:57] or tongue,
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; but Christ in you.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Just as Israel's doorpost bore the blood
[2:18:05] of the lamb as a token in Egypt, the
[2:18:07] believer's heart bears the spirit of the
[2:18:11] lamb as a token. It's the proof the
[2:18:12] blood has been applied and the judgment
[2:18:14] will pass over. You're going to escape
[2:18:16] the tribulation.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; And this is no longer a shadow, friends.
[2:18:23] It's available.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's the reality now. The very
[2:18:27] life that will quicken your mortal body
[2:18:29] at the rapture is already in you. It's
[2:18:33] already in you. It's working.
[2:18:34] Sanctification, transformation, and
[2:18:36] power because Christ lives in you. The
[2:18:40] glorification of your body is not a
[2:18:42] wish. It's a certainty.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that raised up Jesus
[2:18:47] from the dead now dwells in you. Amen.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; And it will also at that day quicken or
[2:18:53] make alive your mortal body.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; This is your hope of glory.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; And friends, it's not just a merely a
[2:19:04] future promise. It's the present
[2:19:06] possession of the life that one day will
[2:19:09] burst forth.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Into immortality.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Christ in you. Not Christ with you.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not Christ's promise to you, but
[2:19:19] Christ in you.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; That's the hope of glory. The token
[2:19:22] restored. That's not a ritual. It's not
[2:19:24] a shadow. It's not not a substitute.
[2:19:27] It's the very life of Christ indwelling
[2:19:29] his bride. Guaranteeing her body change
[2:19:32] when he returns.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't you see? With the fullness
[2:19:36] of the word comes the fullness of the
[2:19:39] birth. And with the fullness of the
[2:19:40] birth comes of the fullness of
[2:19:42] redemption.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; You are in the day of redemption.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; We have something about it. The day of
[2:19:51] redemption is near. We can say now it's
[2:19:53] here.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; I've been bought with the blood.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have the token.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; It ain't a jump. It ain't a shout. It's
[2:20:04] the life of Christ.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; It ain't a knowledge. It ain't It ain't
[2:20:08] knowing mysteries. It is knowing him.
[2:20:11] and to knowing him is life.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; That's our assurance.
[2:20:21] It's the very life of Christ indwelling
[2:20:24] his bride guaranteeing a body change.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; You
[2:20:33] who have received Christ and receive
[2:20:36] this message, you are guaranteed
[2:20:41] a body change.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I am the resurrection.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; I am the life."
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I am the rapture."
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm afraid I'll be left behind. No,
[2:20:59] I can't be left behind. I am the
[2:21:02] rapture.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because I've already been
[2:21:08] quickened. So you see the mystery hidden
[2:21:11] is now revealed and and for centuries
[2:21:15] the reformers of the churches spoke of
[2:21:18] it but they couldn't see the fullness.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; They could you see they couldn't see
[2:21:23] God's own life not only with his people
[2:21:26] but in his people but now the token has
[2:21:30] returned
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; the literal life of Christ. And when it
[2:21:34] does it does away with the substitutes.
[2:21:38] If you listen to the token message,
[2:21:40] brother Brandon preached in September 63
[2:21:43] and he and he and he tells you there he
[2:21:45] said you know other stages that were
[2:21:48] examined they were gathering a lamb they
[2:21:50] were examined in the land and you know
[2:21:52] there were days that it was kept up and
[2:21:54] examined which is all process of it but
[2:21:59] he said today is not that day we are
[2:22:03] come though it was lamb time in Luther
[2:22:06] and he says it's lamb time in ly they
[2:22:09] were keeping up the lamb. They were
[2:22:11] examining the lamb. He's without
[2:22:13] blemish. Here's what it ought to do for
[2:22:15] you. All these things that they were
[2:22:17] doing, understand.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; But now he said it's not just lamb time
[2:22:22] anymore. It's token time where the
[2:22:25] lamb's blood, his life must be in the
[2:22:30] believer on display.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. not only on the believer but he
[2:22:38] said on the church displayed.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; So therefore signs, wonders, miracles,
[2:22:42] healings, deliverance, tongues,
[2:22:44] interpretation, tongues, prophecy, every
[2:22:46] gift of the spirit has to be manifested
[2:22:49] in that bride church
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; because why
[2:22:54] we come back to the token again
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; the blood and it must be on display.
[2:23:02] Amen.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Now, this is why Paul can say,
[2:23:08] "Christ liveth in me."
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; Right? Galatians 2:20. Christ liveth in
[2:23:14] me.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; I thought it was the Holy Ghost. It's
[2:23:17] Christ.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Ghost.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; It is the spirit of Jesus.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; It is the spirit of the father.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; It is the one eternal father. It is
[2:23:27] immortal life. It is eternal life.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Ghost. Whatever, whatever
[2:23:32] you want to say, it is Jehovah Gyra. It
[2:23:34] is Jehovah and I say it. It is the Lord
[2:23:37] I that health. It is the It is the Lord.
[2:23:40] It's him living in his people.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; And to think of it today, you can have
[2:23:45] him, not just a substitute.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; But you can have the very person, the
[2:23:52] literal life of Christ living in you,
[2:23:54] controlling your nature, causing you to
[2:23:56] overcome.
[2:24:02] Because Christ is now living in you,
[2:24:05] your future glorification is guaranteed.
[2:24:10] Because Paul ties that directly to the
[2:24:13] transformation
[2:24:14] where he said if the spirit of him that
[2:24:17] raised Jesus from the dead, if it dwell
[2:24:19] in you,
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; there you go again, is still the spirit
[2:24:24] of my father dwelling in you.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it dwells in you, if he that
[2:24:30] raised up Christ from the dead dwell in
[2:24:32] you, it shall also what?
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Make alive,
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; quicken
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; your mortal bodies
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; by the spirit that dwelleth in you.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; That's our hope of glory.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; It's not just going to heaven someday,
[2:24:45] but a but a literal body change
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; when Christ returns. No more substitutes
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; down to the ages. God gave portions of
[2:24:58] himself,
[2:25:00] portions of truth, anointings, and they
[2:25:04] were substitutes until the fullness
[2:25:06] could be restored. But now the fullness
[2:25:09] of the word brings the fullness of the
[2:25:12] spirit.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; And the token has been restored. Not a
[2:25:16] partial light, not a shadow,
[2:25:22] you know, it's the token restored. It's
[2:25:24] the fullness of the spirit with the
[2:25:26] fullness of the word. So, so because the
[2:25:30] token is of Christ's literal life,
[2:25:33] you're no longer hoping in a church.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're you're not tied to my
[2:25:40] coattails.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; If I don't go, you're going without me.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; And if I'm going, I can't pull you with
[2:25:50] me.
[2:25:51] Every person must have it for
[2:25:53] themselves.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is Christ literal life a restored
[2:25:58] believer. And you're no longer hoping in
[2:26:01] a church, a priest, a substitute or a
[2:26:04] preacher or a priest or a portion of the
[2:26:06] spirit. You have the person himself. It
[2:26:09] dwell in you.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; And the same spirit. Oh hallelujah. The
[2:26:14] same spirit and not another spirit. The
[2:26:16] same spirit Jesus had. If it dwells in
[2:26:19] you, it will also make alive your mortal
[2:26:22] body
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; even now. It'll make it alive. It'll
[2:26:25] cause you to come subject to the word of
[2:26:27] God.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; So the token restored again means more
[2:26:32] than gifts. It means more than tongues,
[2:26:35] more than a feeding, a feeling. I mean
[2:26:38] it's Christ himself inside the bride.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; It's not a substitute.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; It's the person. It's not a promise on
[2:26:47] paper.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; It's not words on a tape.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; It's not printed on a book.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; It's not a collection of message
[2:26:55] paraphernalia.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; It's not pictures
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; of a of a of a great man. It's not it.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's It's not at all. It's the
[2:27:06] spirit himself
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; which is more than a picture. Which is
[2:27:12] more than a tape. which is more than
[2:27:14] words on a book.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; It is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; It is the earnest of our inheritance.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; So let us be clear. The Holy Ghost is
[2:27:26] not a silent guest who slips in
[2:27:30] unnoticed.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; He is Christ returning to Jacob, his
[2:27:35] dwelling and his bride. And when he
[2:27:38] comes, you know it.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Because the word said you will.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And at that day you shall know,
[2:27:46] not hope, not wonder, not assume. You
[2:27:48] shall know.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; For when the Holy Ghost come, I'll tell
[2:27:52] you what happened. Heaven moves in and
[2:27:54] hell moves out
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; and you are never ever ever the same.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can testify today? You
[2:28:04] were there. You know it happened in your
[2:28:06] life. Hell moved out when heaven moved
[2:28:09] in.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. A new king came on the throne.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; You're not subject to sin anymore.
[2:28:16] You're not slaves to Satan any longer.
[2:28:18] You're not a part of some denominational
[2:28:21] system. You don't have a substitute. You
[2:28:23] have the real.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have a substitute blood
[2:28:28] that'll get you over in the tribulation.
[2:28:30] You have the blood of Christ which
[2:28:32] cleanses you from every sin and does
[2:28:35] more than cleanse it. He comes to
[2:28:36] indwell you and fill you with his
[2:28:38] presence and empower you to live an
[2:28:41] overcoming life.
[2:28:45] Let me tell you, every scripture s shows
[2:28:47] the Holy Ghost is not silent, not
[2:28:50] unnoticed, not a vague assumption
[2:28:54] assumption. He's a power. He's a
[2:28:56] witness. He is a fire. Yeah.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what. Ever since I
[2:29:00] received the Holy Ghost, let me tell you
[2:29:02] something. It's been a fire.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; A fire shut up in my bones.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That if I would hold it back or
[2:29:09] try to be quiet, I have to express it.
[2:29:12] Why? Because why? The Holy Ghost is on
[2:29:14] the inside burning. It's a burning fire.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; It's a passion. It's a drive.
[2:29:27] It's not le oysia
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; lukewarm cold indifferent
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; far more powerless
[2:29:35] a powerless religion but it's a religion
[2:29:38] of power.
[2:29:52] Let me just see. I need to find a place
[2:29:55] to stop.
[2:30:00] In case you're curious,
[2:30:02] I'm on page 35 of 84.
[2:30:13] Heaven help us
[2:30:20] now.
[2:30:25] Let me just see
[2:30:28] as I wind this up just for a moment.
[2:30:32] Brother Brandham and I I'm I'm just
[2:30:34] going to skip a couple of slides here
[2:30:36] just for a moment
[2:30:39] where brother Brandham talks about this.
[2:30:43] He talks about the nickelan age and he
[2:30:46] said we take the Methodist form but then
[2:30:49] he said it brings it down where you know
[2:30:52] there's substitute you know when the day
[2:30:53] of Pentecost was fully come they were
[2:30:56] all in one place one accord and the
[2:30:59] pastor came down preached the fine
[2:31:00] sermon said give me the right hand the
[2:31:02] fellowship we'll put your name on the
[2:31:03] book so joining the church became the
[2:31:06] new birth
[2:31:08] saying whatever the priest preacher told
[2:31:10] you to say so he put words in your
[2:31:13] mouth.
[2:31:15] I believe Jesus Christ to be the son of
[2:31:17] God and savior of the world. You're
[2:31:19] saved.
[2:31:22] It all put it back
[2:31:25] upon a preacher
[2:31:27] or a Zuza street. It turned out where
[2:31:32] they couldn't get everybody to speak in
[2:31:34] tongues. So they shake a jaw and quiver
[2:31:38] get them to say a word that they put in
[2:31:40] your mouth.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Say Jesus. Jesus. Glory to God. Glory to
[2:31:44] God. Until you get a confusion of
[2:31:46] tongues.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Again, it's imparted by a priesthood.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; So, what caused it? The nickel bringing
[2:31:56] in a bunch of men to twist up the
[2:31:58] scriptures and make that denomination
[2:32:00] that can't let God move in it. And it
[2:32:04] dies right there. You're dead. You got
[2:32:05] to name your living. You're dead.
[2:32:08] Many of them dead and don't know it. Now
[2:32:10] I want you to watch this. This is the
[2:32:12] indictment.
[2:32:14] Brother Brandham would indict a
[2:32:16] generation for crucifying Christ the
[2:32:18] second time.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; And in doing this when the church world
[2:32:23] would turn him down by rejecting the
[2:32:27] Jesus of their day,
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; the word for their day,
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; they crucified the effects of the
[2:32:36] gospel.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. And when it did, I want
[2:32:39] you to understand it's like
[2:32:42] it's like that Israel that day when
[2:32:45] Jesus hung on the cross and it opened
[2:32:48] the veil of the temple. What happened
[2:32:52] there when the veil was written too? It
[2:32:54] showed there was no God there.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; But he was no longer there. He had
[2:33:00] listen he had he had ordained that
[2:33:04] priesthood down to the ages. He had even
[2:33:07] filled temples with his holy fire
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; and there had been moves of God. But now
[2:33:14] that day at Calvary when Jesus died,
[2:33:18] suddenly
[2:33:20] the substitutes
[2:33:22] would no longer atone
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; and the woolly lamb's blood no matter if
[2:33:31] that's what brother Brandon said in the
[2:33:32] third seal I think it is. He said,
[2:33:34] "You'll find out in the thunders."
[2:33:36] That's when the seals are open. He said,
[2:33:38] "Well, you'll find out when the in those
[2:33:40] thunders." He said, "Where they'll come
[2:33:43] to the altar and scream and cry and get
[2:33:45] nothing
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; because they can come back to the same
[2:33:49] altars
[2:33:51] that saved their grandfathers."
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Now, catch this thought. Now,
[2:34:01] let me break it down to you. Catch this
[2:34:04] thought.
[2:34:07] The moment Jesus died,
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; all of those substitutes now would be
[2:34:16] offered in vain.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Now, but Moses told us, Ezekiel did it
[2:34:26] this way. These others did it. my
[2:34:29] grandfather, my mother, my daddy
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; and they died believing it
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; and they were saved.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; But the day Jesus died,
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; The temple veil was ri open.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; And it showed God ain't there no more.
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; Where is he? He's the one you rejected
[2:34:56] and is hanging on the cross.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:01] And from that moment,
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; that substitute blood was no longer
[2:35:08] effective.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm excited. Brother Tim, Israel's
[2:35:12] going to get the red heer and she's
[2:35:14] going to It's of no effect.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; There's only one blood. There's only
[2:35:19] salvation in one name.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when Peter stood up on
[2:35:26] the day of Pentecost and preached, he
[2:35:28] said, "You got to be you got to be
[2:35:30] baptized in this name.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; There's only in this name is their
[2:35:34] salvation. There's no longer salvation
[2:35:37] in any other lamb."
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; All the other lambs are they're cap,
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; They may be coming sincerely.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; They may be coming with
[2:35:49] same way their grandfathers did and get
[2:35:52] nothing. That's right.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; And so does this age come to it when
[2:35:56] they when a prophet indicted this
[2:36:00] generation
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; for doing what? Rejection Jesus. Oh,
[2:36:04] they believe in Jesus. Yeah. They
[2:36:06] believe in Jesus of a portion of the
[2:36:09] word
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; but not the revealed word of the day
[2:36:14] which is the Jesus for our day.
[2:36:19] And the and the moment the church turned
[2:36:21] down the word, you know, God called out
[2:36:24] a bride, he opened the seals, he broke
[2:36:27] the veil, he showed he showed the
[2:36:30] antichrist and the working of
[2:36:31] Antichrist. And there is no salvation
[2:36:34] there that'll get you in a rapture.
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach now.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; Because the only place there is hope of
[2:36:46] glory
[2:36:47] is when the word has been restored
[2:36:51] back to Paul's gospel. Amen.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; So now we come to this indictment
[2:37:00] and brother Brandham's indicting a
[2:37:02] generation. Now the seals have been open
[2:37:04] and the word is rejected. Even in in the
[2:37:07] invisible union when brother Brandham
[2:37:09] spoke there in shreport he said the the
[2:37:12] church cannot fulfill the great
[2:37:14] commission.
[2:37:15] They cannot finish what Jesus said to
[2:37:18] do.
[2:37:20] They cannot, he said, they can't even
[2:37:22] agree on one word of the Bible hardly,
[2:37:24] much less all of it.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; And he said, they cannot receive these
[2:37:29] seven seals that have been revealed and
[2:37:31] the word that's been opened. Therefore,
[2:37:34] they cannot finish the great commission.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; Now, so something happened. And let me
[2:37:44] tell you, when the seals are open,
[2:37:46] something happened. There was a shift.
[2:37:49] The veil was opened. What did he reveal?
[2:37:52] God had left the denominational system
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; and was now in the revealed word.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Now, where is their mercy for a rapture?
[2:38:06] Only there.
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; Now, look down to the tribulations of of
[2:38:14] the Jews in the 2,000 years. There were
[2:38:17] people saved even though they did not
[2:38:21] receive Christ
[2:38:23] under come coming to God by faith under
[2:38:27] the Old Testament law of understanding.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. Under the under the fifth seal,
[2:38:35] there was souls under the altar
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; who had never received Jesus Christ but
[2:38:40] were given white robes
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; because of the testimony which they
[2:38:46] held.
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; You see, they had believed in God, but
[2:38:51] they had failed to see the progression.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; And there will be those in the
[2:38:57] tribulation and there will wind up the
[2:38:59] great white throne judgment.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? because they believe
[2:39:04] for the testimony which they held
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; but they didn't go into all the revealed
[2:39:11] word for the hour because it's only the
[2:39:14] revealed word the hour that has the hope
[2:39:17] of glory
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; so Peter on the day of Pentecost said
[2:39:25] you men that dwell in Jerusalem or Judea
[2:39:27] you hearken to my words these are not
[2:39:29] drunken if you'll stand still I'll show
[2:39:31] you what is and he goes ahead and
[2:39:33] explains to him and when their hearts
[2:39:35] were pricricked they said what can we do
[2:39:37] to be saved and what what can we do to
[2:39:40] receive this we're convinced your word
[2:39:41] is right he said repent every one of you
[2:39:43] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:39:46] Christ who was Jehovah revealed for that
[2:39:50] age and time
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; Jehovah had been revealed in other ages
[2:39:55] but now he's revealed in fullness
[2:39:58] &gt;&gt; we're convinced your word's right be
[2:40:00] baptized at one in the name Jesus Christ
[2:40:02] remission from sin. You shall receive to
[2:40:04] give the Holy Ghost. For this is to you
[2:40:05] and your children, them that are far
[2:40:07] off, even as many as the Lord our God
[2:40:08] shall call. That's what they got to do.
[2:40:10] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:40:12] Jesus Christ. And today the Roman
[2:40:14] church, Catholic church, adopted father,
[2:40:16] son, and the holy ghost to take its
[2:40:18] place. That instead of that a communion,
[2:40:20] lick out a tongue and take the wafer and
[2:40:22] drink the wine and you're one together.
[2:40:24] The communion instead of being the Holy
[2:40:27] Ghost called Holy Eucharist and a
[2:40:29] father, son, holy ghost or trinitarian
[2:40:31] baptism when it's not even spoke of in
[2:40:33] the Bible, the name of father, son, and
[2:40:35] holy ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[2:40:39] he said, "When you show that to this
[2:40:40] onward generation,"
[2:40:43] watch this, this onward generation. As
[2:40:47] Peter said, "Save yourselves from this
[2:40:49] onward generation." Unto perverse
[2:40:52] crooked, wicked generation. That's what
[2:40:55] it means. Untored.
[2:40:57] When and when you show it to them, what
[2:40:59] they do, they make fun of it and say,
[2:41:01] "Our church don't teach it that way."
[2:41:04] Then you're guilty. Right?
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; You're guilty of crucifixion
[2:41:10] of Jesus Christ by taking the power of
[2:41:14] God away from the people.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; You crucify the very word to them and
[2:41:19] you condemn yourself with your
[2:41:21] congregation and lead them into a death
[2:41:24] trap.
[2:41:30] And friends,
[2:41:32] just as there going to be millions
[2:41:35] that will be saved, there will be
[2:41:36] millions that will be counted as
[2:41:38] counterfod cannon fodder for the atomic
[2:41:41] age.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[2:41:50] I'm gonna cover this so I don't have to
[2:41:52] do it. Let me
[2:42:00] So we come
[2:42:03] Jesus gave the last supper.
[2:42:07] He gave both the elements
[2:42:11] and you wonder what brother Brandham is
[2:42:13] talking about. He said you know they
[2:42:14] lick out a tongue take a wafer and the
[2:42:17] priest drink the wine.
[2:42:20] Let me just cover that for a moment.
[2:42:23] At the last supper, Jesus gave both
[2:42:26] elements
[2:42:29] to his disciples. Paul taught us to do
[2:42:31] the same.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Drink you all of the cup.
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; Eat this. Eat this bread."
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; And he not only spoke of the ley then
[2:42:41] eating the bread, but drinking this cup.
[2:42:43] Let me go back to that right quick where
[2:42:46] brother Brandon was talking about this.
[2:42:49] And he's talking about crucifying,
[2:42:51] guilty of crucifying. And he said the
[2:42:54] communion.
[2:42:55] So why is it that the Catholic priest
[2:42:58] drinks the wine and only the congregants
[2:43:02] eat the bread?
[2:43:07] I don't know, Sister Debbie, you was a
[2:43:10] Catholic one time, probably took
[2:43:12] communion. Did you get to take the wine?
[2:43:15] No.
[2:43:19] No. Was you a cattle? Uhhuh. Do you ever
[2:43:22] have the wine? No. Who had the wine?
[2:43:27] Who? The priest. Now, here's two former
[2:43:31] Catholics. Thank God they're real
[2:43:33] Catholics.
[2:43:37] You know why? Why did the Catholic
[2:43:39] priest drink the wine and the
[2:43:41] congregants only get the bread?
[2:43:44] because concern
[2:43:47] that the congregants
[2:43:49] might spill the wine, the precious blood
[2:43:52] of Christ.
[2:43:54] So you can't handle the wine.
[2:43:59] And the council of Constants in 1415,
[2:44:03] it formerly decreed communion under one
[2:44:06] kind for the leoty, reserving
[2:44:10] the cup for the priest.
[2:44:12] Now in practice what this did it
[2:44:14] separated the leoty from the visible
[2:44:18] sign of the blood and it reinforced the
[2:44:21] image of a special priesthood.
[2:44:24] And that symbolism said in effect the
[2:44:28] life is only reserved for the
[2:44:30] priesthood.
[2:44:34] It's not for the people.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; Only the preachers can live it.
[2:44:40] The congregation is not holy. There's a
[2:44:42] holy priesthood.
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; And that symbolizes symbolization or
[2:44:48] symbolism said the life is reserved for
[2:44:51] the priesthood. The practice of leoty
[2:44:54] receiving only the host which is the
[2:44:56] bread while the priest alone drink from
[2:44:59] the chalice has historically implied a
[2:45:03] special class entitled to Christ's
[2:45:05] blood.
[2:45:07] But the scripture,
[2:45:10] it shows every believer shares equally
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; in Christ's body and blood.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; So the new covenant does not have a
[2:45:21] priestly elite dispensing grace, but one
[2:45:25] mediator
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; between God and man, Christ himself who
[2:45:29] give his life for all people. And at
[2:45:31] Calvary, the veil was torn. And the life
[2:45:35] of Christ, his very blood was not poured
[2:45:38] out just for the clergy class, but for
[2:45:41] every believer.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "Drinking all of it."
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; That you know what that means? Every one
[2:45:49] of you
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; can get the Holy Ghost.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; Every one of you can be filled with the
[2:45:55] wine of God. Every one of you can have
[2:45:58] the spirit of God dwelling on the inside
[2:46:00] of you. It's not reserved
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; to a holy priesthood.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; You are that holy priesthood.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's not just for
[2:46:14] priests. It's not just for apostles, not
[2:46:16] but it's for all his disciples. Every
[2:46:18] believer has a access to the blood and
[2:46:21] the body of the Lord. So he says, "Save
[2:46:24] yourself from this unto generation,
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; untoward generation, this perverse,
[2:46:30] crooked, wicked." You show it to them.
[2:46:32] What do they do? Make fun of it. Our
[2:46:35] church don't teach it that way. Then
[2:46:36] you're guilty of the crucifixion of the
[2:46:39] Jesus Christ by taking the power of God
[2:46:42] away from this people. And when you take
[2:46:44] away from the people the spirit having
[2:46:47] its way, the spirit moving among the
[2:46:50] congregation, the shout of the king from
[2:46:52] in their midst, the worship of the
[2:46:54] priesthood,
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; worshiping in the pew as well as in the
[2:46:58] pulpit. Are you with me?
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; When you take that away from them, you
[2:47:02] are guilty of crucifying Jesus Christ
[2:47:06] again
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; and put him to an open shape.
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; That's where we are.
[2:47:13] Christ is being crucified
[2:47:16] once more.
[2:47:18] Let's stand together.
[2:47:23] But let me tell you,
[2:47:25] when he's crucified,
[2:47:29] when he's rejected,
[2:47:31] when he's unwanted,
[2:47:33] when he's hung on the cross,
[2:47:36] when he's put to open shame, when he's
[2:47:39] mocked. Haha, look at them dancing in
[2:47:43] the spirit. Haha, look at them shouting.
[2:47:46] Haha, look at them. They still believe
[2:47:48] in speaking in tongues and gifts of the
[2:47:50] spirit. Haha. When he's mocked and he's
[2:47:53] scorned and he's spit on
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; and he's crucified,
[2:47:58] it brings the word into full effect.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; To you, the people.
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me, church?
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a day of the outpouring of
[2:48:10] his spirit,
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; not in portion, not a little bit of it,
[2:48:14] but all that he is poured out into a
[2:48:16] bright body.
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; It's rapture time. It's the hour of your
[2:48:21] glorification.
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, let us be glad and rejoice because
[2:48:26] we no longer have a substitute. We have
[2:48:28] the word in his fullness.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; Can we praise the Lord together this
[2:48:32] morning?
[2:48:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:34] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God.
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:44] Power

[2:59:37] Oh, rise up.
[2:59:40] Rising up.
[2:59:43] And the New Testament church is rising
[2:59:46] up.
[2:59:48] As the Bible plainly tells how the Holy
[2:59:52] Ghost fell, how signs it once were done
[2:59:55] by the apostles.
[2:59:59] Demon spirits were cast out in the
[3:00:02] cherry they sang a shout while
[3:00:04] surrounded by God's holy angel man.
[3:00:09] If you think it's all long gone and the
[3:00:13] miracles are done. I have some good news
[3:00:17] to bring to you.
[3:00:20] For in the last days you pour out your
[3:00:23] spirit more and more like mighty angels.
[3:00:33] Oh my god.
[3:00:38] My God.
[3:00:40] Oh my God.
[3:00:44] My God.
[3:00:47] Newest.
[3:00:48] Oh my god. Right.
[3:00:54] Right.
[3:00:57] the New Testament church right here.
[3:01:02] If you think it's all long gone and the
[3:01:05] miracles are done, I have some good news
[3:01:09] to bring for you.
[3:01:12] Oh, in the last days
[3:01:15] [Music]
[3:01:18] like a mighty angel of strength
[3:01:23] to God.
[3:01:25] Oh, rise to God.
[3:01:29] There's a New Testament church.
[3:01:32] Oh, rising up.
[3:01:36] Rising up.
[3:01:39] It's a New Testament church. Oh, rising
[3:01:43] up. Rising up.
[3:01:46] Riseing up.
[3:01:49] &gt;&gt; Let the New Testament church rise up.
[3:01:54] Oh, rise up.
[3:01:56] &gt;&gt; Rise up.
[3:01:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, rise up.
[3:02:00] Hallelujah. God bless you dismissed in
[3:02:02] Jesus name. Oh rise up
[3:02:07] rising up.
[3:02:10] There's a new testament church.
[3:02:28] Holy God will
[3:02:32] come
[3:02:37] down
[3:02:42] my holy
[3:02:46] This is all
[3:02:51] my heart.
[3:02:53] [Music]
