your situation is no matter how big the storm no matter how high the sea gets around us we know he's in our boat sometimes he needs to be awakened that's right or maybe he's not in your boat and he needs to be invited there cuz you sure can't sail these stormy seas without him you got to have Jesus I wouldn't know what to do without him today we have many many many that are sick not able to be in service with us they're streaming today they would love to be here and I send my greetings out to them in our new year service today first service that I will speak this month and to you of course the seen audience kind of takes me back to maybe the early 90s or something as far as our congregation size but you know it really doesn't matter how many that there are is this two or three he said I'll be there in the midst and I tell you what I promised him a long time ago that I'd do my best no matter what kind of what size audience it was I remember preaching over Mississippi to a group of I think there were eight of us and I was one of the eight my wife was is also present and so I guess I was preaching to six you know cuz we as far as someone knew but anyway I preach just like I'd preach too a thousand cuz I figured if God couldn't trust me to do my best with eight he sure couldn't trust me to do my best with a thousand see you know the numbers doesn't matter what matters is this he's present and he's able to meet your need I'm speaking to people today around the world and some of them are just little family units some of them are you know large family units are single people some of them are in situations their churches and such a terrible shape they can't go there no more they got despotic par pastors that are abusive and they can't go preaching false doctrines I hear from them and they said brother Tim you know we receive strength from what you preach you know I I'm sorry they're in that condition I I'm sorry that there are trouble like that in the world but all we're wanting to do today is come in by the Holy Spirit and bring them a word of encouragement to lift them up to encourage enourage the bride of Christ wherever they are to just get in Step just get in Step God's moving he's doing wonderful things I've got a couple of prayer requests or actually prayer clo one's I'm going to be sending to sister a sister in Trinidad sister CA she has a need her foot won't heal she listens to our services there from Trinidad and there's there's another a little sister Maria that you heard from Finland a mother her husband and her have both desperately reached out to her for to us for her she's got a fighting anxiety and can't sleep at night and an awful oppression of the enemy the children of God shouldn't have to go through those kind of things not when we got a Healer like we do a deliver like we have and I believe we can believe the prayer of faith today that when these prayer cloths are laid on them that they will be healed I'm going to say the same thing to you our church family that is listening in that can't be here today and you're sick in your body maybe a loved one can just lay hands on you or someone nearby or maybe you're by yourself whatever may God lay his hand on you and today May healing virtues flow from the throne of grace father in the name of Jesus thou knowest every need that would be among us we're just asking Lord that you would just come today and show yourself alive after your passion your suffering that you did for us on the cross for we know Lord that you paid for this foot condition when those nails were put in your feet we know Lord when you were beaten and a crown of thorns put on your head that all of the fear and anxiety problems and everything else you paid for it Lord we know oh God when you took the stripes upon your body that you paid for every need that there could be whether it be from cancer to covid to flu to RSV to weakness whatever it is and we bind the power of the enemy today in the name of Jesus Christ and as we send out these paraca to this these ones in Trinidad and Finland Lord may we hear back from them by his Tripes I have been healed the evil spirit that has tormented me has left my body and I am well Lord we know you're the same yesterday today and forever that you never fail to keep your word and your promise and we're here Lord today in 2024 in our first service Lord to proclaim the name of Jesus and to lift it high and to encourage the saints of God to press on in this stage of the journey may we take another step forward I ask it in the name of Jesus we love you Lord now anoint Us by your spirit in Jesus name amen praise God Amen God bless you if you'll turn to Psalms chapter 62 I'm going to read some verses there in the scripture you're going to be seeing on the screen to King James I'm using a little different version but you know it's the word of God the word of God is the word of God no matter if we say it or paraphrase it or or whatever you know it's the word of God is still prevails it's the truth that we're looking there in the word amen so if you will turn with me to Psalms chapter 62 we're going to read from verse one there and um we uh trust the Lord will bless us today amen we want to welcome each one of you in the name of the Lord and glad to have brother William Smith here with us today and and uh he and Sister Abigail plan a marriage this this year over in March so may God bless them with their future and I know that the year 2024 holds a lot of great joys for us all we don't know what all we will face in it but we just know who holds our hand amen asking God's blessings amen upon you all amen um let's turn to Psalms 62 and verse one and it says I will wait quietly before God for my victory comes from him can you say Amen to that he alone is my Rock in my salvation my Fortress where I Will Never Be Shaken amen that reminds me of Psalms 27 where brother Brandon pulled the Rapture sermon from and you know of of there being our Fortress and our rock verse three so many enemies against one man all of them trying to kill me to them I'm just a broken down wall or a tottering fence now that's what they think but our Fortress is the Lord they plan to topple me from my high position they Delight in telling lies about me they praise me to their face but curse me in their hearts let all that I am wait quietly before God for my hope is in him he alone is my rock and my salvation my Fortress where I will not be shaken my Victory and Honor come from God Alone he is my refuge a rock where no enemy can reach me oh my people trust in him at all times pour out your hearts to him for God is our refuge verse 11 God has spoken plainly and I've heard it many times power oh God belongs to you unfailing love oh Lord is yours surely you repay all people according to what they have done amen God bless you you can be seated for my New Year's message this morning I would like to address you as a part of the bride of Christ those of you that are assembled here today and those of you that are watching online our church local our church online and those around the world those that are viewing this service today and you know when we I will speak I I kind of like to do this sometimes on the first of the year much like um in our country we have the State of the Union Address and there will be an address from our president that will tell us the the State of the Union as he sees it and I think of that many times as I approach um a New Year's message like I have today is not not so much a state of the union of the United States but of course um the the state of where we are in the journey you know as a calendar would turn we we'll often look at it and we we kind of like to know what just lies ahead you know I uh have had opportunity a lot of times to sit down with Elders um and and here try to get wisdom from them and say what do you expect what do we look for and today I'm going to be speaking to you on this present state stage of the journey and I I want to just picture this as if we are traveling along and like many times with my family that we would do and the kids were little and all be in the car and you know the journey would get long and it would be wearisome and uh you know everybody was ready to get to where we were going and we would hear the the I would hear the children pipe up someone in the back and say Daddy how much farther or maybe another and say are we there yet and you know we as we look at this today I think that is naturally some of our questions as we come upon this journey and of course you could say say in one way we have been journeying as a people since Eden and another way is chrisom we have been journeying since Pentecost and and um and of course and as us as message Believers we can look at different landmarks and places of where we have been in the journey maybe where maybe where you joined in as it were a bus going down and you got on it a certain stop and of course we know along some of those stops some got off and some went on to their reward and others went off and found a place back out in the world that suited them better and you know but anyway nevertheless we have a Destiny and there is an end to the journey and that end is coming up and and of course we are looking to know where are we in this Journey just how much further do we have to go and I look over and see some of you that are past 70 and and and you've reached your three scoring 10 and um you know you you know there's not much time left in your journey here upon the Earth and um and of course as we look here we know also you could be just a young person maybe a teenager or whatever that you know we have been along long long enough to know that it's not just the old that goes on but teenagers and sometimes children and sometimes um you know young mothers or dads or whatever you know there there's there's there's trouble and strife and things that happens along life's journey and of course part of that is just being human because we are should I say Mortal because of the IM mortality that was forced upon us because of Adam's decision now as far as a world that we live in you can certainly see the bills are coming due in 2024 a lot of bills are coming du the debts are high and they have put them off as far as they can and we have spent until the death ceiling has reached limits that is UN imaginable and the debts that we have made in society uh two will have to be paid and many of them will be paid this year experts are predicting um bank failures and a great reset um that you know that your money will be more devalued and will buy less and all the time uh causing hardships upon you housing experts are predicting a housing crash that it can't continue to keep going higher and higher and higher that at some point there has to be a correction and comes things come back to more of a re more realistic um figure and and of course when we look at at the world that we live in um with uh the the the world conditions we have a weak America we have a China that is ready to pounce on Taiwan and and claim it for their own and then we have Israel right now in the Middle East that is that is clawing through another attempted Holocaust and trying to root out an enemy that they had turned a blind eye to in in hopes of achieving a peace but it was a false hope and then we have Iran that is um poised to finish uh its Atomic weaponry and has proxy Fighters employed everywhere and um you have um them with their proxy Fighters the the hooes and whatever sending their bombs and sending their drones and stopping ships and the and and commerce and and uh threatening World Peace then we have Russia that is angry about America's proxy war used in Ukraine and and um they're they're angry and and they're they're making their moves and they also uh there will be M much much debt to be paid coming up in this year 2024 is another election year and America is so divided that no matter who win there will be the chance of a Civil War I don't know how big or how small but you know there's going to be somebody unhappy no matter who wins and and to do there will be disruption when this day the right is vilified by the left and the left has gained dominance and you have you know the the the stoking of racial fires until the blacks threaten the whites and the whites threaten the blacks and no and and nobody likes the Asians and then you have the the gays who threaten those who are straight and Sodom has become embolden and transgenders announc that they're coming after your kids and so you know it's um it's a very treacherous time in this journey you know it's kind of like um in the journey you're passing through a bad neighborhood and and you're you're you're everywhere that you look there is Calamity from hijackings and threats of of rioting on the streets or boycotts or this or that or the other and you know it's all that's going on as we look around and and we wonder sometimes you know that we can't help but breathe where are we at in this journey and I think in Isaiah 21 And1 um there was there was the prophet Isaiah who said the burden of Duma he calleth me out of sear Watchman what of the night Watchman what of the night and the Watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if you will inquire inquire return come and of course as we're looking around it's getting darker and darker as there is approaching danger and hell itself is coming here upon the Earth getting ready for the actual coming of its king which will be cast out of Heaven amen and come down to the Earth knowing that it has but a short time you know here again brother brandham saw it in the vision coming um as uh he saw it um visualized in that Vision materialized in a giant mamba snake and the whole world was shaking under its influence and even here in America that was once the beacon of Christianity and freedom is now dying and and it has been bitten by the snake as it were and the whole world is shaking and and the civilization that you live in is crumbling around you because it's dying and and and of course we long for the day that somebody might see its head finally crushed and that the dead in Christ will rise for their bodies are still even today held under the curse and Decay and we long to be among those as we sigh oh to be among those who are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord so you see we could go on our after hour painting this picture and knowing that all the prophets prophesied to this day and and we we hear the it screamed out Watchmen what the night and yet the Pentagon doesn't have an answer the United States and our government has no answer uh no matter who you get in or who you elect they cannot they cannot find the solution to the world's trouble that we're in we whether it's our allies in Germany or our perceived enemies in Russia none of them have the answer science does not have the answer they have even in in in our days released from their Laboratories their experiments that has has brought to us horrible diseases of covid that killed millions and wrecked economies and they don't have the answer and and but I want you to know there the real true Watchman is the Holy Spirit and he has the answer and we we can cry out to him Watchman what of the night and I want you to know the Watchman on the wall says it is time to go up we are nearing the end of the journey and you as a people are under an eagle anointing and it is time that you leave the nest that you get out of your comfort zone and you fly and spread your wings and fly into into the Realms of the Blessed where all things are possible where the Supernatural is real to you and you experience it yourself and a people that know their God do exploits of course we know as an eagle that an eagle flies higher than most other birds he's built for the heights he's special built for the altitude that he flies in and I want you to know that God has equipped you as we walk on this journey and seemingly in snail Pace that we're about to take an astronaut ride and leave the real that we are in because the end of this road you know ends all of the walkingspree muching dangers and today God still has Eagles we can we can go back and re we can reference and we will of course the great prophet before us of brother brandham for our age and we will also reference some great men like Isaiah or Jeremiah or the different ones you know because they are they were Eagles and they had spiritual eyes and they prophesied of the day that we're living in to kind of give us an idea of where we are in time that's right and today God still has Eagles Messengers men on the tower who climb up to the spirit that is far above where atomic bombs can go or scientific researches a man that is specially designed for a purpose amen men of God anointed men who can climb the ramp parts of Calvary in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and stand back on the top of the Cross and can send back a message God has said this this is his word here is his promise amen that there is a rock that we can stand on when all the trouble is all around us that we can have a consolation that he has not left us but he is with us for he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world I can hear brother bradam say oh listen listen to thus sayith the Lord if you consider me to be his servant it's just before the day of bre break of day and that is why the horrible Gloom is over the Earth it's just before the coming of the Lord Jesus and there's no more hope left in nothing but his coming nations are against Nations they have fooled with God's laboratory till they got power to break below one another into Atomic ashes and they're Wicked they're unreligious they're un Christlike and the only motive they have and the only objective is to destroy and they're inspired by the destroying angel that was sent down from heaven to inspire these men and let me say in the name of the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit has sent as a Watchman on the tower and as the people cry what of the night are you weary of this life are you weary of sin are you weary of funeral sessions and are you weary of sickness and ungodliness on every hand has the night been long and weary what of the night Watchman and he says the morning cometh see the Comfort the night also what is the night Watchman what are the night what's going to happen here it is total Annihilation is coming to the whole world but before that Annihilation takes place the church of Jesus Christ will go in the Rapture to meet our Lord what a promise that is what a consolation I think I'm preaching to a people today that we are weary we are weary of burying loved ones we're weary of the toil we're weary of the long night we're weary of of of church ages and and just uh you know that God send a messenger and they fall away and go back and the cycle of Revival and death so you don't continue on we're weary of it all we're tired of it we're saying God where are we at this journey how much further that we got to go how much longer Lord I think it must be that way I think there must be a people that are crying out in their hearts even so come Lord Jesus Hallelujah now Daniel looked at his prophecy too and as he pondered the present stage of his journey if you'll turn with me to Daniel chapter 9 and verse 2 we used Daniel as a reference in the first re year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books now I want you to notice he didn't get a love story magazine I want you to notice it's not a fiction story he wasn't he wasn't into Zang Grant or whoever I don't know what their names are but anyway he went into none of them he says you know I Daniel understood my books what was he looking at he was looking at the word of the Prophet look where unto the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek my prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and Isis now Daniel was among the Hebrews that were taken down to Babylon you know Daniel had not done evil you can see from his life he was a sincere believer in Jehovah early on he would refuse to eat the king's meat to pollute himself with the Pok the pork and the uncleanliness of the meats that they were forbidden to and meat that would not been uh that was not Kosher and and so you you know from early on you can see his life and his testimony he had been a Believer all that time but he too was taken captive he too his hands were tied behind his back and stripped and taken down to Babylon he too would would see the atrocities of relatives and friends and loved ones slaughtered and killed and and and and Friends brothers sisters taken prisoner and taken down to Babylon now Babylon had a a way of doing things they they the way that they would control a region is they would upright the population and would move them here and move them there and whatever so that they would not be in their Homeland because in their Homeland they would have strength they would have courage and would fight for their Homeland but if you take them out that they're part of Babylon and it's here down in Babylon that they would actually wouldn't have a temple and they would start their synagogues and their Pharisee worship and all the other things that would come as they would adapt to Babylonian culture and it would be that many of them would go down into Chala into Babylon and would never return they would always live down there and they they would say I can serve Jehovah there I don't have to go back to the Homeland that becomes the attitude of a lot of people today we can serve the Lord where we at we don't have to go back to the homeland of the Bible we don't have to return to the book of Acts we we don't have to go back to to the worship uh you know where God chose to put his name we can worship anywhere we can do our own thing yes but when I think about Daniel a man who had not sinned a man who had not done evil a man who was righteous but he had to suffer with the wicked sometimes things seems unfair why is it Lord I've tried so hard I've done everything I can you know I served you here I am a prisoner down in Babylon here I am taken from my home here I am and he determines and as heart I'm going to serve God no matter where I'm at this nation we will suffer in this nation Christians will suffer because of the unrighteousness and politics and it'll make the whole nation suffer and this was from nothing he did but rather judgment was upon the nation of Israel and because of their sins righteous men like Daniel Hebrew children Shadrach mesach and Abednego was bound taken down into Babylon here he was separated from his people separated from his church think about that not one church service to go to maybe like some of you sitting there in your home today and there's no place to go no hymns to be sang but what he's saying to himself yet he still held on to what the prophet said While others were worshiping foreign Gods you know he held on and he said I I I want to search the message I want to go back and look and see what the prophet said let's see what Jeremiah said you know we're nearing the time and I tell you if there was ever a time that we ought to be into the word of God and seeking it out it's right now in this hour it's the hour of more consecration of Mer dedication because we know we're at a junction being taken away from his home now nearly 70 years remember 70 years was approaching if he was if he was 14 when he was taken away he was now 84 years old or there about you know here here he was and he goes and he looks having into the book he want to see what is it how many days will it be before all this is accomplished and the same is true today we are looking back we're searching the books I don't know I don't know about you but you know it's kind of like my kids my children along the journey daddy where are we how much more time how how many more miles of course we didn't have je GPS you know with an ETA so we look at the road mapap and said well it looks like if if I can read the figures right on this map we got we got another hour and I you know and there could be delays and there could be situations rise we don't know exactly what minute it'll be but we're headed that way just just hold on children we're going to get there after a while and so you know again that today we're we're looking back we're searching the books we're reading the road map we and we see we are now approaching a great Junction like I said there's a lot of deaths that has to be paid Daniel made himself ready he was starting a fast he was sanctifying himself and he sought the Lord knowing the Fulfillment of the promise through near and he didn't want to miss it he's saying God what must I do next for we're now at end time and that's what I say today God where are we where where do we go next we're nearing the shore the day that we're living in shows every sign is pointing to the coming of the Lord oh I can go back and consult the books Let's go and let's turn as it were uh turning the book and and and of course this is not in the Bible it's in the sermon desperation oh church he screams out rise and Shake Yourself and pinch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish there is coming forth something from the Lord and I know it is dust say the Lord there's coming for something and we better get desperate it's between life and death it'll pass through us and we won't see it it's very important we note the signpost along the road some of the signpost that identifies where we're at as we see the cooling off among Christians we see the Church of the Living God becoming indifferent becoming infatuated with the world and losing its love for Christ we we see even among Mage Believers becoming so denominational minded and drawing up its barriers until you know it ought to be seen as Milestones to let us know we're getting close to the end of the road when we see even our message becoming more and more denominational eyes with with little Jerusalem's here or there where you got to come because this is where that you must be to make the Rapture in this certain church or this certain group of people I I want you to know you know I want you to know as we look into that for a moment it's a Milestones to tell you that that even the movement that we have been in as what we call the message is a dying movement now I know that'll make a lot of people angry but it's a dying movement the throws of death is upon it and see moves more and more toward denominational mindedness you know the and and I want to I want to deal with this for a moment because here we are I want to just point out some of the signs as we pass by see this sign here says we are at this place and so from here you know from here we got to go go further from here and and and we don't want to stop here so you know if you look in Revelation chap 3 314 and I and and read of the leoan age and we're not going to actually read it but I want you to remember this as we look at this Milestone this Milestone says that the church would become lukewarm that it would deal with with horrible situations thinking it's rich and increased goods and having a need of nothing and yet would not know his spiritual poverty it would give to the point that it would actually put Christ on the outside where he would actually be be um uh standing on the outside of the church knocking trying to get in you know again we we look back and we can say yes the Methodist did it yes the nazarenes did it yes the bilol did it yes the isusa street movement did it but you realize the last rejection of Christ will be among those who claim this messag I want that to sink in the Bible declares that before he's coming there will be a great fall in the way well yeah there's certainly been a great fall the Virgin that started out has defiled herself with other lovers and she is called in the Bible the Great and if that's not b bad enough she's influenced her daughters and her daughters are who came out of Catholicism are called harlots and yeah that's a terrible fall amen but yet I want to say you can still even though that is true you can still expect to fall in the way not just the fall of those who have now denounced the message and have went out into the world or joined themselves with the Harlot system or maybe got re-baptized into titles to their shame amen but but but those but those who still cling to the prophet of Malachi 4 will actually reject Christ they will be ashamed of the Holy Ghost they will become ashamed and embarrassed of Holy Ghost meetings they will be embarrassed to see the word bring forth acts 238 tongu speaking youngans of course the bride won't fall away but the mixed multitude among her will they will make captains to go back to Egypt I you know I've read I've read in the books and I'm telling you from what I've read in the books as Daniel read of Jeremiah I read of the prophet of the last day and one of the last sermons that he preaches to us is ashamed of him and I read in the books that many will become ashamed of him that many will scorn a church filled with the spirit they will reject the gifts of God even to the point of not just the nine spiritual gifts but even reject the ministerial Gifts of Ephesians 4 they will not want the moving of the spirit they will preach against it and will crucify Christ from their pulpits they will call the Revival he sends a false Revival they will mock with scorn those who receive the word with joy as David did uh in his day and then they will be like the daughter of Saul maau as she as she she looked upon David as he danced before the Lord and he was dancing not just out of an emotion or just some little Joy or just cuz he was happy that day but because the word was returning amen and it was not because of his dancing and shouting that Aza died the reason Aza died was because because David had brought it on the oxcart like the Philistines had done not in God's provided way on the Levites the shoulders of the Levites and because it was not brought by God's ordained way because he failed to consult the word before trying to bring the word back the ark back and me death struck and it always will the word has to be carried on the shoulders of the Levites and as David danced before the Lord because the word was now returning because there was a restoration taking place then is the daughter of Saul looked upon her upon him saying David you're too childish you're too immature you're too Pentecostal it's only babies that wants the gifts of the Spirit you know you're not dignified enough to be king but David was not walking that day with a dignified robe and the air of a king you know all proud and exalted he realized that the Ark of the Covenant symbolizing the true and great king was now being put back into his proper place and when he did he forgot all about his dignity amen and he made great the name of the Lord while he based himself amen humbled himself are you with me and because of that Mel was struck with the curse of bareness she would not bring forth children of the king amen David David was able to put aside who he was to make great the King of Kings I hope where we are in this journey I hope if we've learned anything that we have learned you know to put away our pride oh that we we're the great people and we're the great ones and that we welcome and make great the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and we exalt his word over our opinion over what we think there so many will look even at what the prophet of God say and shrug you know and say well that's just his opinion well I tell you his opinion is a lot better than yours amen he met an angel he was in the presence of God he was Vindicated I'll take his opinion any day over yours or over mine amen you see but again David was able to put aside who he was to make great the king of kings and Lord of lords that's what real men do they will welcome and receive the word and when doing so they'll throw out their garments of Pride throw out their dignity and they'll humble themselves and rejoice liftting up the name of Jesus hallelujah oh yes they will read their quotes that fit their narrative leaving out what they don't want and it'll be a word without power mechanics without Dynamics religion without emotion that is dead lectures without anointing dead sermons that kill and that can only bring forth stillborn children without emotion or life I'm not speaking these things today as a novice I'm not speaking this as a young preacher or a young convert I'm speaking to this as a man of experience as I've stood preaching to this congregation as it started out in Little Home meetings and would start out with with a little small handful of people and build up and up to now to now 54 years of ministry on February the 1st I don't say that I don't say this you know as a novice I say this as one who's been there who's come through it who's dealt with situations who's traveled the world who's put my thumb up the pulse of the people among churches and see the problems that are there and I just want to say dead sermons kill and lectures without anointing are of no value I don't care how many quotes that you use the devil uses quotes Satan would use quotes to have tried to defeat Jesus amen but he didn't know how to place them in right order he did not have the the ability to use it in the correct way and it was not anointed and it didn't bring life and to obey it would to bring death the message movement is going through the same cycle of Revival and death that every movement before them did that's right and I'm going to say thus this church will either have a Revival or a funeral sa pause and think on this thank you Lord we'll either have a Revival or a funeral and we get to decide which one did you hear me we get to decide which one we can decide whether to have a Revival within our being where the spirit of God saturate your soul or we can have a funeral and bury your old dead emotionless religion bear you with it but I just want to say not all will go down into death let me read again from the books not all will go down into the into death let me quote from from even first Thessalonians 4 we which are alive and remain there's somebody that's going to be remaining there's somebody going to be still alive I want to be among those that not just have got breath in my body but I'm alive and my soul within me there's life that is breathing out hallelujah holy spirit life so let me read from the books I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she's sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there yeah they're waiting for the Dynamics to take her off the Earth into glory in the Rapture I believe it with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is a Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting watching for that how many's looking for his love gifts I am amen I'm looking for his love gifts come on church amen is not going to be it's not going to be another sermon it's not going to be another word it's not going to be a new revelation you know but it's love gifts amen things that he's going to endow on his church that he is endowing that he wants to do with every one of you this morning amen I you know again in the in as I read from the books back in the message Oneness the church is now engaged like a man engaged to his wife what does he do while they they're engaged he just been doing all kinds of things sending her presence making her feel good well that's what Christ is doing to his church he's sending us Gifts of his Spirit how can you be engaged then when you're denying these gifts exist it's the very love tokens it's God's token to the church Jesus said so these signs shall follow them that believe you know anything about those signs Amen in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with tongues if they they hands on the sick they shall recover and he says The Church Must Believe every word every promise every Iota and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in if I was engaged to a girl and I was a single man and I'd send her something an engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it then that shows she doesn't believe me she doesn't want to be my bride amen well I'll tell you what I've been there done that back 1975 I asked the sweetheart of mine where you married me and she nodded her head yes nodded her head she's really shy I said what I didn't hear you I said I didn't hear you say anything she nodded her head more vigorously I said a vow has to be spoken and she said said yes we went down I got the best ring I could we were both poor there'd be times I didn't even have a car to drive I went and bought her ring we paid $98 for it my father-in-law would say where'd you get that from a gum machine but it was the best I have she wored with pride she believed me she believed in me she wanted to be my bride she took my ring and there she wore it and showed it everywhere others say it's cheap it's from a gun machine others would make maybe a light of it or whatever you know how in the world is this guy ever going to mount to anything she she she B on the the bobtail nag and won am amen you see D I've been there I've done that but what if she would say oh no you know it's kind of like Billy Graham one time was courting a girl she a beautiful girl nice girl and he asked her would she he marry her and she said no no I I'm I'm not going to marry a preacher like you said I I want to marry somebody that'll be famous she didn't know what she was throwing away she didn't know what she was thinking was cheap yeah that didn't look like would amount to anything and brother Brandon said if Christ sends his church the gifts that he promised and they refuse them and say they're not so that they don't want to be the bride of Christ they are espoused to some other lover and not to Christ the bridegroom so the real Church keeps the promise and keeps all and accepts the gifts that God sends them amen yes sir amen hallelujah now the last Church age is Leo DEA and he's shown on the outside of his church knocking to get back in they have put him out again thinking of this Paul said and I will quote from the book this book I will quote from this know this in the last days perilous times will come men will be hey and high-minded and lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God and Truce Breakers false accusers and continent despiser those that are good and brother Bram comments on that and said call you a Holy Roller anything they can having an a form of godliness but denying the power thereof he said there you are fundamental in dark now get this church fundamental in Doctrine but powerless in power they deny the existence of Divine Healing they deny the power of the gift having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof that is the state that the message Community has become his word testifies in the last day that would come of Fallen away and there will come up a cold form of powerless churches that we're living in a church that has no power having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away he gave the sign that there would be times when men man would sit in the temple of God showing himself he is God and he would come ruling the Nations how perfectly all these things how God's word has been perfect and how close are we how far are we I I I will tell you this we've run out of Ages I don't know you noticed or not but where this is the last one and it's been a long journey for the church since the day of Pentecost and as we passed one of the last mile markers I see a sign let me read it to you oh no I I don't I don't know if you can take this or not it says Jesus has been put out of the message Church are you sure did you read that right brother Tim well let's see let me look a little harder at the sign oh wait a minute I seem there but outside with dirty feet some of you are wishing I have stayed home today I could at least change the channel but let me just tell you every Revival and I'm quoting the books every Revival down through here the churches every Revival is always been brought sight of out outside of organization any man that ever started Revival was outside the organization and every time a Revival started they had signs and miracles and speaking in tongues and healings and so forth and taking place like that and as soon as that founder died then they organized it it made an organization out of it and it went right dead and God never fooled with it no more that's exactly right and here he is at the last Church AG standing outside the door God Almighty that breaks my heart right standing outside of the door of his own church after being pushed out by whirl and coldness and denomination and difference and standing outside the door knocking trying to get back in and brother Bram said when I thought that a while ago I just leaned over my table and started crying now by the way he's preaching to the leoan church AG here the Elijah anointing is on him and he is able to show us the journey where we've been lay out the road map and say now we're in the seventh age and here he he looks and he sees Jesus with dirty feet and this is part of his sermon as Hey listen Church turn give me give me the scripture Revelation 3:14 and and I want you to I want you to see this re ration 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of Le oia write these things sayith the amen this is the final say stop here a minute look here to the angel of the church to the messenger of the Church of Le oia what church age are we in so Christ Jesus Christ himself gave a message of what would be in this last age what would be the the condition what would be the situation where we would be what would be happening in this last age now so again you see here here again I want you to see this so as brother Bram is preaching the message message of the leoan age he's not doing as John Wesley or Benjamin Franklin or some Statesman he doing it as the seventh angel who has received the message from Christ himself amen and he's the messenger and he he stands there in his church and he says it's Jesus outside with dirty feet amen and he says I often dealt with Jesus standing in that Pharisees house nobody paid any attention to him when he had Dirty Feet they didn't meet him at the door and wash his feet in anointing taking the manure and stuff where he had been walking His Garment sweeping around and brought brought that old stink off the road where horses and things had travel and got that stink on them they'd always wash the feet that was the custom and a footwash flunky stayed at the door and when a man come would wash his feet and raise up get a little pair of sandals and put on they anointed his head made him feel good and to burn on his neck from the rise of the sun comb back his hair and he will go in and then this poor old Harlot down the street who come up there she only had a little bit of money in a sack and she looked over and seen Jesus staying sitting there with dirty feet now why is brother Brandon preaching this because this would be what happened in this church age amen that that here he would see Christ the the woman he forgive that other woman of her sins you know I I know he's the man I've heard that done these things you know but but look at him why why isn't anybody inviting him in how come nobody wants him and he said that's the way we do we invite him to come to our meetings but when when he comes we're ashamed of him oh I wouldn't stay now listen I'm I'm quoting to oh I wouldn't stay up there and say praise the Lord oh oh no there sister Jones say that think I was a Holy Roller you you hypocrite that's right I'm afraid I'd speak in tongues they call me a tongues man you miserable wretch now remember this is going in you're miserable wretched poor naked blind and don't know about it you know and and and get to the point we become so legalistic and so rigid in our Pharisee order that somebody was so worried that somebody might get out of order well they ought to get out of order long enough to get saved amen again you know hear this this little woman elbowing away through the crowd I I tell you I wish that's the way where every one of us would accept Jesus elbow in our ways as the crowd not worrying about what everybody else saw or thought about or how they saw I was or my pastor the way I've been but but realize Jesus needs to be worshiped and he deserves our worship amen and his feet must be washed and the stink of the world washed off of come on somebody amen I may welcome the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and anoint him you can't anoint him with dead singing and dead preaching you have to anoint him with life something that has a fragrance something has a has a a beauty about it brother bradam said she got there regardless of how vow she was he said oh I know it was out of order oh sure God help us to get out of order once in a while the trouble of it is you got too much order get out of order I hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved I remember when Jesus saved me how many remembers when he saved you he said oh I'll never forget it this little old Kentucky heart of mine was jumping 90 miles another an hour I wept I cried I shouted I didn't care who was standing around I wasn't paying attention to order I was in the presence of Jesus and I left [Applause] it that's right she wasn't so much noticing about how much order she was in or how much she was out the main thing was to get to Jesus amen that's the way I'm feeling amen I don't care what people have to do come on somebody amen you you realize we can get to the point we get so rigid in our ways and but but I tell you if you want to make it all legalistic better have your church bail and you all the other things that you're supposed to do two just don't have one that's we going to make it law make it all law that's right amen remember those things were Church order was given to as a guideline and sometimes you got to get out of the guideline amen you got to get out of the guideline set there the of the order in order for somebody to get saved to break through to the holy spirit amen notice she wasn't noticing about how much order she was in or how much she was out the main thing was get to Jesus that's the old thing about our youth camp I I really don't care about what Pharisee is looking in what's in our services amen it really don't matter what they think as long as young people are getting to Jes Jesus Hallelujah I don't care if they have to get out of order if they get out of order whatever it's always in order when a soul comes to Christ that'll be the main goal of every church amen is to see our altars full of the people seeking God having a greater experience with him she didn't care about all of that he said he sat without being kissed he wasn't welcome and she wanted him to be welcomed she didn't care about their old Pharisee orders about their old tradition she was pressing her way through to get to Jesus God help us to have a Revival like that where men and women will elbow their way through the crowds and denominations and the bearers till they get in the presence of Jesus yeah Jesus sitting there with unwashed feet I don't want that happening in this church every time he comes I want to make him welcome make him welcome with our tears with our rejoicing with our glories to God with our shouts with our receptiveness to the word of God Jesus with dirty feet leot to and churches and nobody paying any attention and today he packs a dirty name as Holy Roller of course we've changed that and call it Pentecostal or something another like that and Men ain't got the goal to stand up for him let me put up a slide today with Jesus standing outside the door of the Pentecostal organizations Baptist organizations Methodist organizations trying to get back in with Pentecost again and the people are passing him by after your world and and things have pushed him out of the church he's standing trying crying to get back in look what he said he's trying he I'm not talking about some Zeus or something I'm talking about this age look if you see the caption the Leo Dean Church age his brother BR preach it receive him the message from Jesus to you and he's trying to get back in the church with Pentecost again not isusa Street the original outpouring of the Holy Ghost and it's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen in my life had no need of him outside knocking trying to get in that's the same thing that he's trying to do today he was outside we'll take the next slide they never throwed him out they still sang of him no notice this having a form of godliness but denying the power so I want you to get the picture they didn't throw him out no they still sang about him that's right you see but they still preached about him but they they had never missed him in their presence they were going right on they were nearsighted they were looking at their big buildings look how God's blessed us you know we used to be in our our little bitty Shany of but church or storefront and here we are now and God's given us look at his blessings I I thank God for this building God gave us God gave us this building you look around this campus and everything has been paid for we don't owe a dime on none of it that's phenomenal that was a miracle that was a blessing from God but I'd rather be back in the old church I'm talking about the old old church with broken window panes and with wood heaters there and a few people that love the Lord than to have a thousand people who didn't really come there with the same intent to make Jesus welcome amen I say we can do it right here in this building it ain't the building and it ain't the number amen it's the hearts that surrendered to God but they didn't miss him no no they didn't miss speaking in tongues they didn't miss the great powerful messages of God who cuts down to the heart and circumcises the heart and tears off the things of the world and Shucks you like a piece of corn there was too worried about order and they had to order but not Jesus that's right give me the next slide If You Preach like that in their church that OU you out and that's the way the Holy Ghost preached you know I had been Ed out but I've been preached out many times afterwards the next four or five sermon they ate me for lunch breakfast and supper but I preached it anyway if you preach like that in their church that ask you out and that's the way the Holy Ghost preach Jesus said you Generation of Vipers you Snakes in the Grass and John did do great anointed men I always tore the hide off of them but they didn't miss him cuz they didn't have that so they went they had a little flowery something patting them on the back and said just join put your name here and we'll take you in our membership and you just go get your paper from other church and we'll receive you and so forth now your pledge will be how much each year you see that's it rich have need of nothing but you have need of the greatest thing and haven't got it again this is to our church age Jesus standing outside trying to get back in with Pentecost what would you think next slide what would you think would happen tonight in the Methodist Church I don't want to change the prophet but I'm going to say what would you think would happen in a message church if the Holy Ghost fell upon the church and they began sh jumping shouting jumping speaking in tongues and acting like a bunch of drunk people why the conference would throw that message Methodist Church out of the conference you know that the same thing would happen Baptist Church did that happen same thing Pentecostals why there's many of it happened the same thing sure yes sir they wouldn't put up without that nonsense they'd say well they even spoiled our new carpets uhhuh My my what a miserable Bunch they are your the messenger is describing the miserable condition that people will get to in this age now so again you see again if he's outside of the Pentecostal church now how are we going going to get him back in this is a question he was asking then and he said here it is if any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come in and I will s with him and he with me amen he won't deal with them no more because they're dead and gone gone to begin with he hates it he's always hated he's always hated that spirit amen of divisiveness and inclusiveness and and and and pushing everybody else out amen listen church sometimes I might I might scream out at some of these brothers and it's not to condemn them and this message isn't to condemn it's to say listen there's a promise in the word and you can have it it can be in your church you say well brother Tim youall think the Revival comes from evening like Tabernacle listen this bride's Revival started because the book was open seven angels came and opened the book and revealed the mystery to a prophet of God and because of that it is started a bride's Revival and I just happen to be a part of it and I want everybody around the world who's the bride to be a recipient of that Revival I didn't start it and you can't stop it Hallelujah but here it is If any man next slide If any man any Methodist man any Baptist any Presbyterian any Catholic man any Church of God man any nazarine man any Pentecostal man or let me just say any message Man any man that hear my voice and will open the door I will come in and suck with him and he with me and that's the message to the Pentecostal church not to try to revive the Pentecostal organization but revive the Pentecostal blessing in the individual's heart yes sir but we don't want this Pentecostal blessing no no no we we got another lover we don't want that in our church no sir we we have our forms and our ways and we do this and that we have our orders get out of order long enough to get saved that's what needs to happen in the Easter seal brother Bram said oh they say you can't have these oldfashioned Pentecostal revivals he said yes we can you can have it in yourself do you know what that means if your church don't have it you can have it you get to choose you get to choose Revival or funeral come on Revival and death is going on and you get to choose and so you they say you can't have it but yes you can the prophet said you can have it in yourself Hallelujah if all of even the light Tabernacle goes dead in 2024 I don't have to go dead I can have a Revival on the inside of myself Hallelujah I am the Revival you can't separate me from this revival I am this [Music] [Applause] revival well we don't need or want a Pentecostal blessing well let me read from the books cuz the Bible said they would get that way that would be their sign of a protest that they would wave come on not anti-semitic ISM but anti- word anti moving of the spirit and they'll wave that around and he says this brother Bram had to deal with in his age he said Paul is ordaining these gifts in the church this is 1965 in Easter seal ordaining these gifts into the church 30 years later and then Galatians 1: 18 if an angel from heaven preaches you in other gospel than this that that already received see already been preached let him be a curse I believe that Pentecost began without ending sounds like to me then we ought to still be in Pentecost until the day we leave after all it's the Jubilee and the Rapture is the Jubilee It's the final setting free from the old flesh hallelujah amen oh he said I believe it's every creature all times all places Pentecost should always remain the Pentecostal blessing should always be upon the people I just say God give me the Pentecostal blessings I'm not going to deny any of your gifts that's right I hear Brother brandham crying out and this should be your cry in this year coming God created me a Revival let me be the Revival Let each of us be the Revival the Revival of me make me the hunger Lord Make Me The Thirst from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed more of you more able more humbler more Kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive forgetting the things that are in the past and the negative and let me press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling so now I don't want to throw you for a loop here here but with him rejection with him rejected then watch the crucifixion brother Tim we pass that on this journey 2,000 years ago didn't we I mean crucifixion was way back there aren't we near the resurrection what are you talking about a crucifixion for because before there can be a res Resurrection there has to be a crucifixion first so if you're looking for a resurrection before the Resurrection comes there's a crucifixion first so he's been crucified and he's been put out of the denominational system but the last place that he will be pushed out is in the message Community his power will be killed his Miracles will be scorned and spit upon oh oh no oh no brother Tim that's only the denominational known many let me tell you let me just get this clear many around the message is under an indictment for crucifying Christ aresh just be sure you're not one of them in the in the indictment message brother Bram preached he said to base this indict he he said he used that four four um letters from the scripture he looked into the book and the book said There They Crucified him and he used that to base his indictment against thisgeneration and I want you to hear what he said in the opening of it he said I'm bringing an indictment to the denominational churches that exempts us praise God hallelujah we're not no denomination no we left that long time ago praise God we're not one of them we we we and also many of The Independents for crucifying Christ AR fresh so you don't even have to belong to denomination you can be independent from them and still crucify him aresh Amen in the token message there is some of the independence just as bad as the denominational sometimes worse I I'm looking at people here today that have sat in Cults that was worse more denominated more tighter more more tighter than any denomination you could have be Freer being a Baptist there's Cults this message those around the fanaticism around this message has could produced Cults men who rise up and say you can only be make it in the Rapture by listening to me if you don't go to my church you're not going in the Rapture all kinds of things it is horrific and the tragedies along the road I I you know I'm I'm a world traveler and I I hear from people around the world I deal with people who who are struggling in situations like that that's right who who who come to me with questions and and said brother Tim you know all of these things are happening in our church you know our our pastor is left his wife and he went and got him another one and now you know she wasn't a virgin according to what the prophet taught and and he he makes up these rules and and these others and we got all kinds of sin and things that are happening in our churches I don't know what to do and I want to go to church I want to obey the word but I can't go what do I do some of the worst Cults there ours call themselves message and like so many others have made themselves a Jerusalem the place you must come to worship they don't know that our Jerusalem is from above and it's the true place of worship the true place is in Christ they don't know that they think it's in a certain place a certain headquarters but in their Jerusalem now if youd studi the indictment message you brother brother brandham said each one of them have made their little movement a Jerusalem the place where you must come to worship and he said but but he went on and preached he said but in their Jerusalem the word is crucified the life is taken out of it and all is left is a dead Creed and he said the new Calvary is the church socalled many holy places most holy places great Pulpit there he receives his heartest pierces a new Calvary where is it found at in the most holy place there in the most holy place they the Jews the most holy people crucified most shameful death him the most wonderful person of life amen where did he he get his Spears at in his side where did he get his pierces on Calvary where does he get it today in the Pulpit where do they come from Jerusalem where do they come from the denomination and I just say just because you don't have papers for one some of the churches are so tightened up until God couldn't move in many Methodist churches acts two would not be welcome but would be rejected they won't welcome the Holy Ghost and especially not if you can't speak in his language they don't want that language from Heaven the ones who claim to love him that's who crucified him today his second Calvary where he receives his pierces against the word who is he he is the word where is he pierced the hardest from the pulpits in the holy places just like it was then amen so this is what happens in the journey Christ will be crucified from message pulpits oh well now brother Tim but we welcome and receive the word it's true you welcome and you welcome and receive the knowledge of the word but if it's true that you welcome his word then you welcome his spirit because his spirit is word in life amen his word is spirit and life amen so so look children as we're driving along I I just want to say we're passing another signpost uh brother Tim I hope this ain't as bad as that last one well let's just look at it Romans 11:25 we're going to read from the books Romans 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be watch eyes and your own conceits that blindness has happened in part to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles come in so now stop leod is prophesied to be what blind okay so that means we now are reaching our fullness remember here it says and all Israel shall be saved is written they that come out of Zion that the there shall come out of Zion the deliver and shall turn away ungodliness sh from Jacob so this is promise so we know that laying right ahead of us all Israel we're talking about the elect shall be saved but in the meantime the Gentiles their age is coming to the fullness now the Gentile is dispensation is represented by seven Church ages so the this the seven Church ages is the fullness of the Gentiles if we're still in in the Gentile dispensation we are still in the leoan age and which is the seventh age under the seventh age messenger now this sign of course means that our road will end at the Rapture so it's telling us there is an end of the road right ahead and that's as far as Gentiles can go because the rest of them have to go in a Rapture because they're coming to the fullness of the Gentiles but in doing so now Israel is still spiritually blind and but their eyes are about to be open however Gentiles see but very little and their eyes are becoming dimmer and dimmer by the minute as their light goes out right now in the blinding of the Gentile of the Jews when they were blinded in that Darkness under cover you know it takes light to for your eyes to see and under the darkness it came and enveloped them a spiritual Darkness on the Jews they killed their messiah in that Darkness amen and in the blinding of the Gentiles they will crucify the word taking the life the anointing and the power out of it that's it now after World War Two we know that the United States had a national Revival with both Billy Graham and brother bradam and the Divine Healing movement and of course there was also all Roberts and the charismatic Pentecostal movement it all sprung up right at the same time do you know why because as we looked at the the sign going along the journey I want you to notice trees have put forth their buds you know here Israel now the Bible says of her and as it prophesies when you see the victory but if you notice it also says and all the other trees right so it's not just Israel putting for their butts but all the other trees so just as just as the angel of God is coming to a prophet for restoration of the Bride tree so Israel the Fig Tree begins to put forth its buds but that wasn't all the charismatic the Pentecostal would put forth their buds the Baptists with a million more than 44 would put forth their buds and all of them would begin to leave out now every one of them is coming to fruit every one of them their debt has to be paid comes a harvest time now so there was in that cycle in that sign there was a for formation of the nation of Israel the Revival of a nation that placed her back in their Homeland and that nation has now been built and it's a modern yet is a sinful place has a powerful Army nuclear weapons you know I I I read there many of the accounts of the the survivors of that Holocaust and seen pictures of them and whatever you know uh ungodly people shall I say it you know uh my uh you know my girlfriend and I were living together and our child you know open fornication all kinds of things and and there they are their eyes are blinded the light is not dawned on them are you with me amen so she is a great nation but she's also a sinful Nation amen and the nation has has got now a powerful Army and nuclear weapons and she's leading the world in science and many fields and she's built an agricultural infrastructure in modern city she's the Envy of the world as a democracy and she's largely though secular almost Godless and she also is a democracy rif with crooked politicians however they had a joke just happened and it's part of our journey on October the 7th things change forever and they'll never be the same again and and and I'm just going to make a prediction what I predict to see from this coming out of this rubble and out of this ashes and these horrible things that has happened to them as a nation that there will be a national Revival within Israel which then they will fulfill their Destiny I won't say all will have Revival and you say well why do you believe this because with a religious fervor the temple will be rebuilt with religious fervor two prophets will raise up and 144,000 will be called out if you would live this why if you would stay here and don't go into Rapture this will happen you will see it God help you that you don't see it the question is though this is the question what about her counterpart what about the bride of Christ will we the Gentile bride remain the same status quo or will we too seek the Lord and turn to him since the World War II Israel uh Israel's spiritual counterpart I'm talking about us the Gentile bride has received a message now listen to me carefully we received a message we have built moves we have made kingdoms we have made fine churches we have political systems and as the World falls apart around us will we seek God with all our heart and consummate the resurrection and the Rapture and fulfill our destiny something must happen right a Revival of some sort must happen to Israel in order to build a new Temple I don't know that the secular Jew will repent nor that there would be a re National Revival there in Israel who knows the outcome of that spiritually she's called Sodom and gomorah they will so vehemently reject the two prophets and kill them and parade their bodies like a bunch of heathens up and down the city for for three or four days the Bible says in the Book of Revelation are you with me so maybe they w't all turn to God but there's going to be a Remnant there's going to be a group of them that will have a hunger in their heart we must find God and I'm saying if this is happening in Israel in the natural counterpart what about the spiritual counterpart I don't say they will all repent I don't say they'll all come back but I say oh God let those of us whose Hearts can be turned let me oh God be stirred in this hour to realize there must be an Awakening a realization of the Fulfillment of the promises but the Gentiles have rejected their Revival and even many in the message Community will do the same they will think the bride's Revival is only mechanics just word we got it it's the word and in doing so they'll condemn prayer lines oh of course unless they're having one if it's them and they sanction it well it's okay listen you don't know I have been to churches priest in their pulpits where the altar was moved to the basement they wasn't going to have nobody snotting around their altar others condemn any sensation or emotion upon receiving the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the status it's hard to believe I know I know some of you think I'm making this up but I'm not listen I'm going to be very vague about this because I don't want to hurt anybody but I was in a message church just some years back walking down the hallway with one of the pastors and there was a sign board they used for witnessing and it lists the Mysteries that have been restored and one of them was listed was the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without Sensations and I stopped the pastor in the hallway cuz I it was incredulous I said you you do know that isn't right don't you that's a misuse of a quote and and by only taking part part of it and it's wrong what you're teaching there is wrong and why do you insist on keeping that of course he knew how how I believe and he just Pat me on the shoulder I know I know I know and on down to The Minister's office I went with him I just want to show you listen I've been through the message they have their one quote I have over a hundred and I picked out a few Choice ones to show you because I want you to fully understand what comes with the Holy Ghost we're going to go to God hiding himself in Simplicity this slide and this is as the seals were being opened the Methodist said when we shouted we had it but they didn't the nazarin said when they lived holy they had it but they didn't the Pentecostal said we speak in tongues we got it but they didn't see God unfolded himself not in Sensations no that's Sensations yet with it see he's not unfolding a sensation he's giv you the person of Christ but there's a sensation that comes with sensation is a feeling it's an awareness that's what it is if I feel a sensation I'm aware something is touching my hand I'm aware something is crawling on my face it's a sensation right and when Christ comes in your life you are aware he's entered let's go to The Sixth Seal to see if if I if I'm right as he says in the Sixth Seal here it all is it isn't emotion let me tell you let's make sure we understand the Holy Ghost is not a jump that's right it's not a shout it's not a feeling it's not chills going down your back it's not speaking tongues speaking in tongues is a gift of the spirit it's not the spirit amen it isn't a motion though a motion accomp it well let's go further into 63 now I could have went prior 63 and got a bunch more and I could actually bring out more from here but I'm just bringing you a few because because I hear people say brother Tim you're only preaching your narrative this is my story it is the whole message so watch this there is a only there's only one way provided by god notice ju July of 63 if the Holy Ghost is on you this word is Vindicated to you because Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe to all the world to Every Creature amen God's provided way what are those signs in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we could go on quoting but you get it let's go to the next one and this is paradox and he preaches a paradox which means a miracle so he could easily title this a miracle so he said for me to live as Christ Hallelujah I believe that the same God that fell on the day of Pentecost upon his churches a pillar of fire and divid himself with clothing tongues among his people is here tonight it is the same God he was then he is today with the same Holy Ghost I know it's a miracle a paradox it cannot be explained emotions screaming crying and so forth cannot be explained but it's a miracle a paradox how God does it it's the what is all of this it's the Unseen God dwelling in the human heart making himself visible by vindicating his word that he's a same yesterday today and forever well if that in enough lless Journey over to spport and let's see this one you people standing here now look don't you rely upon some emotion although it has emotion in it I thought it was without feeling your Prophet didn't teach that that is not a restored mystery that's a lie from Satan by the misuse of the word of God he did it to Jesus he used the word to try to get him to fall I'm not falling for it that's right let's go a little further 64 let's traveling to 64 here any birth is a mess I don't care where it's at if it's in the p pin or a hospital a birth is a mess so is the new birth it'll make you do things you didn't think you would it'll make you get down at the altar and cry and scream wash the pain off your face yeah that's needed in message churches too raise your hands praise God speak in tongues and all kinds of things the new birth will do that because it's a Zeus Street's way of doing it I didn't read that I Miss that's way you've been reading it I'm I'm not pointing at you I'm pointing at you the new birth will do that because it's God's provided way to be born again is that not enough what about the seed coming to maturity brother brandom starts and he said you know like the seed that is planted must come back to the grain again so and mighty God unveiled he said and now it's rip here we are in that time of ESS to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning this is what to expect at this journey his say Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that came down on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost is manifested today from glory to glory to glory and is back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation it's from Glory unto glory and the next will be changed from this Glory into a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him so brother brandom tells us here it'll have the same sensation well brother Tim we need deep teaching got to have it from the depths well you can't get more deeper of a sermon than future home you know when a man receives a baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around here they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that that's too deep for too many go ahead let's go to why it had to be Shepherds I'm Consulting the books I've seen jumping spells and joy spells but there was nobody hurt the mountains rung out and the sun went down and everything took place but there was nobody hurt I've seen meetings where the power God was revealed to the people and they were free from the world and the things of the world and the joy of the Lord filled the congregation and they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of God I never did see anything disorderly they was always right in order because they had recognized that their name had been written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen when you see your name in the book when you see your part of the promise but brother Tim you missed it I mean you're way off on the deep end it this is is a word Revival it's just word word it's just word only man well okay let's just see what the word does let's go to Broken sist 65 we're coming close to the end of the prophet's warnings education can never bring life so you can't educate them into this message that's it takes the spirit of God to bring life and the life must not come out of an intellectual Revival but it's got to come out of the Bible word Revival is everybody on page all right word Revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results he did in Acts two exactly it always has it always will be because the spirit of God conditions the atmosphere well brother Tim the atmosphere just a right in my church for there to be Revival in it well I tell you you got a job job that's right you got a job to do change the atmosphere until the holy spirit is welcome again and I didn't even bring for you the one from invisible Union which the only kind the word can bring forth is those acts 238 screaming yelling youngans miserable creatures that they think they are but our Prophet called you miserable for refusing to wash jesus' feet so what will cause the Gentiles to be cut off I want you to see this this was taught in the leodan age by the leoan messenger your message let's turn to Romans 11:19 if you go listen to this you'll hear what brother brandham says and he says Thou will say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in now what he types Paul is using and he's talking about Israel has not received the gospel and it's turned to the Gentiles and he said what has happened is that there has been the Olive Tree that the branches were cut off that a wild Branch a wild Olive Branch would be would be um grafted in all right and he said you Gentiles are the Wild Olive Branch that has been grafted onto the tree and he said so you will say the branches broken off that I might be grafted in well he said it's because of unbelief they were broken off this is why they were broken off they were broken off because of unbelief and thou standest by faith but be not high minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branches take heed that he spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fail severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise Thou shalt be cut off so if the Gentiles are coming to their fullness to their end what's going to happen to them they are going to reject Christ just like Israel did 2,000 years ago and will be cut off and the original Olive Branch will be put back in and the finishing up will be the gospel turned into the Jews so here we are I'm reading you the road sign there's a saw out a pruning shear and God is about to cut off the Gentiles now let me take you to the leodan age brother bradam says in there he said we're closing the church ages Paul said if God Spar not the olive original Olive Branch but cut it off because of unbelief is that right what caused them to be cut off because they rejected Pentecost is that right on the day of Pentecost they made fun and blasphemed the Holy Ghost when Jesus was here they called him B above he was a devil he a fortune teller he said I forgive you for that but when the Holy ghost has come don't you speak against it because if you speak against it it'll never be forgiven you watch out amen remember this comes right back the cycle right to the Gentiles and remember when Jesus commissioned his disciples not to go to the Gentiles is that right but go to the lost sheep of Israel how did they condemn themselves by blaspheming the Holy Ghost calling the spirit of God an unclean thing making fun of him when they were dancing in the spirit and so forth on the day of Pentecost the same city they made fun of it Titus killed them in there and their blood run out of the gatesway and they eat their own children and everything in that same Century that's right and one of the greatest nations in the world became the lowest and Scattered to the Four Winds of the Earth because why unbelief and that was the original stump the original tree and he said now at the first tree was holy it Branch was holy the original tree and because they disbelieved the Pentecostal Mage that Paul was preaching God cut him off and took a wild Olive Tree which is the Gentiles us and grafted Us in that we might live off the substance of that tree now how much more in this day when we're rejecting the Pentecostal message that come down to the church ages how much more is God going to able to take off that old wild tree off of it anyhow and let some other come in because he will reject it because of their unbelief so a sign that we are close to the end of the Gentile ages and the Rapture will be a rejection of Christ which is the rejection of Pentecost because that's where what is Pentecost is the Holy Spirit the spirit of Christ poured out oh yes but I got some good news oh yeah amen I have some good news it ain't all bad news yeah been a rough Journey come through some bad neighborhoods been a lot of warning signs but let me tell you something when you see these things come to pass what were you instructed to do by the book look up the road ends here hallelujah but it goes up there look up for your Redemption BR n because guess what after the crucifixion after the crucifixion after he's totally crucified and death comes the resurrection and I already see men and women and boys and girls coming out of the tomb of formalism of Resurrection out of do denominationalism out of Creeds of man I see a men and women rising up amen skin coming on the body amen what is it a bunch of bones that have been laying there bearing for many many years and life is coming to the body which is a Vindication the Rapture is in hand God putting skin on a people that'll bring the gospel to the last days with the signs and wonders of it to the world watch man what of the night I've told you about the night been some morbid horrible scenes ain't nothing like what's fixing to come the spirit the spirit that attacked the Jews the other day can only attack Us in the ecclesiastical manner I'm talking about whel there'll be persecution here there others but when the bride leaves from here you think they are just after the Jews and want to exterminate them they want to destroy all Christianity and guess what the spirit within this nation will join with them already you see laws changing already you see things happening in our universities taking over by absolutely crazies leftist ping into the youth until they don't know right from wrong they're like a Muslim child in Gaza who's Tau from the day he's born to hate a Jew and there're nothing but dogs and should be exterminated and Destroy everyone you can and and got their little coloring books and everything else you know and and they they do practice runs and everything thing else killing the Jews destroying them but listen they're not just after the Jews they want to all this the true Seed of Abraham they're going to be after the church when the bride leaves and they would get you but the Bible said you should pray always to escape the things that are coming on the earth and be counted worthy to stand before the son of man but let me tell you friends you see that they may hang him on a Roman Tree they may come and every kind of way and crucify him and the big denominational stones to try to keep Christ in the Tomb but there will be an Easter for he said I'll bring back a church in the same power I'll bring back that bride like she was there in the beginning with the same signs the same fruit the same things that he did I'll bring her back I will restore sayeth the Lord I'll tell you what church look from this time on not to go down but to go up hallelujah look from this moment on to go forward not backwards look for this moment Hallelujah not to not to go down into death like every other Revival has done but be among those alive and remain at the coming of the Lord the world groans for manifested Sons but if there was ever time to shine oh yes it's like the Morning Star the morning cometh why because the Morning Star is shining look at it every other ones have been dimmed out and the only ones still reflecting the light is the morning stars and who is the morning Stars they're sons of the morning they're Brothers of the Messiah that's what morning Stars said when he when he said the morning Stars shouted for Joy it literally means the brothers of the Messiah shouted for Joy oh brother and sister this morning this time if ever to let the son of the light of God shine on you and you reflect the glory of God and morning stars shine and Shout out it may be dark it may be evil it may be a horrible day but morning's coming I can see the rising of the sun peace Shalom is breaking over the Earth this is the stage of the journey it's time to go home stand together with me God bless you God bless you I pushed two hours today brother Peter gayy God bless him he's there at home sick with covid been very ill pray for him the many others and he said to me this morning brother Tim we're going to have to make up for this have two services in one I said we do it every Sunday we don't come back for Sunday night we put it right in the morning service we're here but I want you to make Jesus welcome if there's any place that will wash his feet there's any place that will love him when they talk to him and said give us a law what we want to know is just tell us what to do just jealous and he said Thou shalt Thou shalt not Thou shalt Thou shalt not and then when it was all over he said oh if somebody would just love me with all their heart and with all their soul and with all that's in me that's what he wants today he does want your rules and regulations he don't want the message to be more BN like a yoke around your neck and you're miserable he just wants you to love him with all your heart with all your soul let's sing it I love him because he first loved me I love him I love him because he first love me and deeper just my sound would you like to love him with a new fervency you start out this new year fervent for the Lord just like a new convert remember the feeling to get that back in again to the sweetness of the Holy Spirit just bathe down smoothes at you love because he first me and just my [Music] Sal on sing it one more time to him just me it from your heart this is what I'm going to do in the new year to
