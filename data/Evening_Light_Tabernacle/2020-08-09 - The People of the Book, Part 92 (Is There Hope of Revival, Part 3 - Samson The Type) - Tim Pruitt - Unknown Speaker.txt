hear my man since i rejoice with you lord oh god may he not just rejoice in the word but the power of the holy ghost illuminating his faith today to believe the word of promise for himself as we agree together as a body of believers for his deliverance satan you've got to take your hands off of god's property we're the children of the most high god and we call for you to leave god's people everywhere as we stand there on the promise of the word and and we have been commissioned to cast you out so therefore today on the wings of this prayer we send it right here in this building every person to those that are listening in and streaming around the world in jesus name for the glory of god amen and amen god bless you turn with me to judges chapter 16 and we'll read from the 16th verse amen god has been so good to us and we so appreciate him good to see each one of you that has assembled with us today amen see brother kirkman sister amanda back there god bless you amen and the master's family over here god bless you amen so i'm glad to have you y'all in the service with us and those of you that hadn't been here for a while well we're glad you're here too amen genesis 16 16 and it came to pass when she meaning delilah pressed him daily with her words and urged him meaning samson so that his soul was vexed unto death that he told her all his heart and said unto her they hath not come a razor upon mine head for i have been a nice right unto god from my mother's womb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i will become weak and be like any other man and when delilah saw that he had told her all his hearts he sent and called the for the lords of the philistines saying come up at this once for he has shown me all his heart then the lords of the philistines came unto her and brought money in their hand and she made him sleep upon her knees and called for a man and she caused him to shave off all seven locks from his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him then she said the philistines be upon the samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wished not the lord had departed from him but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven then the lords of the philistines gathered themselves them together to offer a great sacrifice unto digging their god and to rejoice for they said our god had delivered samson our enemy and our hand and when the people saw him they praised their god for they said our god hath delivered into our hands our enemies and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass when their hearts was merry and they said call for samson that he may make a sport and then he called samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillars and samson said unto the lad that led him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women that beheld why samson made sport and samson called into the lord and said o lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once oh god that i may be at once amends to the philistines for my two eyes and samson took a hold of the two metal pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of the one on his right hand and the other on his left and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon the people therein so that the dead which he slew at his death was more than they which he slew in his life amen may god bless you you can be seated excuse me now today we're going to be speaking on again from the the little subject that we're holding dear to our heart of us being in the land of promise and um but this portion of it today is we're going to be speaking on is their hope of revival and we're going to be speaking of samson the type and brother bradham told us and god hiding himself in simplicity he said now you hear me if you believe me to be a messenger sent from christ to you you you believe me if not if you're not in the kingdom of god you better press right quick it will not get better it will grow worse all the time and certainly we can see the effects of that right now today said just mark it down just remember see whether it's right or wrong so you see if it's going to be right or wrong it's not going to get better it's going to get worse it's going to get harder all the time the revival is gone you're only cleaning in the field she's over now you say i disagree with that fine it's okay if you do that's all right but that's my conviction and that's my hearing from heaven i believe that laodicean age is the pentecostal age where she comes to the place of lukewarm and god spews her from her mouth from his mouth and there she's come right now the pentecostal movement has come down to that place lukewarm not red hot not ice cold you're not cold and formal neither are you hot you're spewing and you're in the spewing stage and you're going now of course as we um approach this subject here this morning and look into this thought is there hope a revival i would like to say sadly message churches are not exactly immune to this people are getting so hard and are not too tender and sensitive to the holy spirit but are lukewarm about it um you know as brother branham spoke about this in the message of shame this was july before he would depart from the from the earth in december and he said i told my wife and brother wood when i got here and some friends i met yesterday that i've had five years have hardly known what to do and it's nervous see that revival itself amongst the churches has died and everyone knows that you feel it in this tabernacle i want you to know it didn't just affect denominational churches but he was he was dealing with this in his own church and assembly he said that you feel it in this tabernacle you feel it everywhere there's a thump a dead feeling there's just something isn't right and it's because the revival enthusiasm has gone away from the people and they said you go into the churches and sit them see them sitting over there and this pastor is stumbling around for a message or something another and the first thing you know he's turned off to some kind of a party that they're going to have or something and it seems to be a dead thump everywhere and this was a condition that brother branham was finding in his church and in everywhere in the whole whole movement everywhere in that time in that era of time even um even as he would speak um in freeport and and would plead with god once more to send a revival to that place and he would he would remark in that in in like tabernacle he said but the church sits spiritually dead gone and the hour has passed them they're in a slump and hardly know what to do one running this way one running another way and hear every promise that god made in the bible every one of them is laying there just as good as they ever was it's the hour what makes a church like this we're in the age of laodicea when she has to come this way this is our fault now but you know we we also know that god is a god that likes to display his power amen you know not that he has to but he just has to it's like brother branham said in one place he said god loves to show his muscles to his children that i'm god and that i changed not and so it pleases him in his omnipotence to do this to just to let his subjects know who he is amen and um and we ought to be rejoicing about that this morning because he has shown us his power we have seen him in his power and i'll tell you i don't think we've seen all of it yet i think we're just on the cusp of some of the greatest things that's ever happened upon the face of the earth and we're seeing the precursor of it now as if god begins to move in his church and i was just i was just remarking today of um to michael about what a miracle even my wife is because i said i don't think we wrap our minds around what a miracle that we've just seen take place and and and doctors are testifying nurses are testifying it hardly ever happens and it is a miracle that has taken place that just in just in weeks time that she's back again in church and and and all body functions working because god is a god of miracles and he loves to display his power among us and so it what does this do it prepares our hearts amen it makes us ready it makes us brace up and ready to take a whole a new hold amen to say you know if god can will do that what else will he do he can do this for every situation my forever problem now of course brother branham said that the people who don't believe in divine healing and performing miracles no wonder our church has died no wonder they're withering up to bloodless cults and this describes those who say oh the lamb has left the mercy seat and you know they've become a bloodless cult when you deny the bloody the blood or the word that's the hour that you die and so no wonder that just a social gospel is predominating today it's because you know we're we're taking the the phenomenal away from god and hey if there ever was a time that we need the phenomenal in the supernatural it is now and and brother brandon said god himself is a phenomenal he is a creator being he is jehovah he's the great reality he's the great substance of everything that was made on the earth was made by him and he displays his power by raising the sun every morning by sending forth the rain by setting his rainbows but and comes down to his subjects and healing their sickness and saving their sins amen so wonderful how wonderful this is to think of that this god loves to show the phenomena to show the supernatural the message conference he said notice if the church if it's the church then when they obeyed what god said originally and it's the word of god look at the miracles and signs and so forth that they had speaking of the early church a church there he said and you you don't have them at all today it's an evidence that god is not with you so when we don't see the miraculous when we don't see god move among us come on that is an evidence god is not with us now again an uncertain sign brother branham says this and and this is a 1960s quote but listen it's very good uncertain sound he said now what kind of signs is going to follow them these signs well on some of them it'll follow perhaps they will maybe it will these signs shall follow them they will believe in healing they will believe in casting out devils they will believe in speaking with tongues or they'll believe in the supernatural works of god the resurrected jesus working with them is that the truth is that god's last word he's referring to mark 16 the last things that jesus said go into all the world preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe so he said then cursed is he that tries to add to or take away from that it's just the way it is once the pentecostal church a noisy church back at the beginning when the holy ghost fell the virgin mary like she was drunk staggering under the power of god and all of them like that and the people said they're full of new wine that's such way the church was ordained and that's the way that every church is ordained and every time god has a church it'll be that same kind of a church hallelujah amen i'm just going to share some of these before we go into the message this morning second-handed robe brother branham said brother and sister the same thing has been done in the realms of the supernatural when they said divine healing cannot work the days of miracles has passed if the days of miracles has passed the days of god is passed the church that don't believe in the supernatural will finally die and god will leave that church amen and god gave the promise and god's promises is eternal so we must be a people that believes in the supernatural and believes the signs shall follow them that believe but as he said again he said it seemed like there's a dying out of the churches harder you can find a church anymore that's alive with the word and the spirit of god and great things taking place like it was not long ago now as i told you last sunday there are two thoughts that brother branham wove back and forth especially right after the seals back and forth as he just went into that and from 63 into 64 especially and i'm coming through 65 right now but it it just it there are two thoughts that he interwove back and forth one was a thought that contained um that was contained and preached over and again and be not afraid and testimony on the sea go away jesus and others that dealt with the disciples were between revivals and understand that's where we're at we are between revivals we are between the revival of the divine healing movement and then the the final quickening of the rapture amen which that will be again another great move of the spirit the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone has come down to unite with the body but when it comes down it'll come down he said with the full power and razor up that even the dead in christ will be raised so so again these these are these are things that are promised and we are in the last day revival and it will crescendo into the chains of our body and the rapture of the church amen so we are you know we're not looking for it to get less we're looking for into crescendo that the things that we begin to see among us of god working in the miraculous that he will continue working that miraculous until our bodies are changed and that is the ultimate of ultimate miraculous amen now so you again there was then the other thought was samson crying out once more lord and brother branham would use him as a type of what had happened to the church and for what us for what for us to expect in this last day are you with me now so he preached a sermon on samson as as the present state of the church this is the present state and he showed where the church was in a condition a deceived church by the world of being blinded and defeated and even coming down to where it would be afraid of the new birth now let me stop there just for a moment and remember brother brandon said it it would turn us into a it would turn us into a bloodless cult and remember a bloodless cult is one who has no blood the holy ghost isn't there the power and the life of jesus isn't there and there is one thing that makes us different between will make us difference between the church and the bride is the token which is the blood which is the holy ghost which is the power of god and all that it contains are you with me now so the church will will never will never overcome they'll wind up in the tribulation but there's a new crop that is going to avenge oh hallelujah that is going to put vengeance upon the devil and offends the blood of the saints by resurrection of all the saints coming forth hallelujah those that went down in the fire and burnt to ashes and those that were were were persecuted and tormented and all of that will be raised you are living in the most exciting times that there's ever been and you must not be lukewarm about it because that dams you to the tribulation as we look at this let's look at this soberly and sincerely and nothing nobody looked at us was pride of we the people we're this we're this you make your own call in an election sure do not think for a moment that any of us can rest on the laurels of our past let's see what are we now where are we walking now what's our level of of of of um of fervency and zeal now now as we come to this these two thoughts that brother branham would talk about he would first preach it at his own tabernacle and this would begin in 1959 when he would preach it for the first time a deceived church by the world and in this he would speak directly to his own church now this is different than speaking out here to the denominational world and telling them where they're an era this is starting right there in the very in the very heart of the bride movement where that he would where he would put out a warning of a deceived church by the world and he would use samson as the type um and let me just and i've shared this quote before and i hope i haven't worn it out to you but let's look at it a little deeper today as we go in here in a deceived church by the world but he said the reason people go and join organizations and substitute a handshake instead of the new birth they're trying to bypass the new birth they don't want the new birth and they know we teach it in the bible so they want to substitute something for it and the pentecostal people are just as bad trying to substitute something they want it in class it must be so classy i wonder if that's what we've done with it when we make the new birth today just saying we believe brother bran i'm a prophet and we believe the message and oh you've got it we wanted it classy we shake hands and join the church and be a sprinkle or baptized or something they're afraid of the new birth and he said i sometimes believe that branham tabernacle's getting afraid of it so he could identify it already the spirit of it right in the movement you see because every time there's a move of god there's also an antichrist spirit that tries to move in there with it to make the church lukewarm and formal and powerless and we must by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit somebody with me now now i mean i i know because we've had we've had great churches even maine mainstream i'm talking about not fanatical this way or that way mainstream message churches where you know in meetings that were where people were invited to receive the holy ghost and people would come and you know have some would have an experience with god and at the end man get up and minister get up and say well now how many got the holy ghost and how many don't think you did and now i'm going to show you where you did you see if you believe the message you've already got it and that man today has turned against the message and is blaspheming the truth of god are you with me that same man is right back into his easy believism you know dressing and looking and behaving in different ways it should never be to administer the gospel are you with me i mean it hadn't worked in fact to the matter is this it's really blasphemy to say i believe the message i got the holy ghost amen you know again you know believing the message is not your salvation it's an experience of personal experience with jesus christ now again he says in there i believe that branham tabernacle is god getting afraid of it and he said now we all know that a birth i don't care where it is so where or whereabouts it's a mess if a baby's born on a shuck pile or a hard floor or pink decorated hospital room it's a mess anyhow a birth of a cow birth of anything is a else is a mess and brother brad is using the analogy of the natural birth water blood spirit right and he said it's a mess now yeah and i know there'd be those who said well but that was a 59 and brother bradham changed well in 1965 he's still using that analogy and he said the new birds is nothing less than a mess but people are so starchy we're going to get some starch out some collards today amen we'll go over there where they'll shake hands we'll go over there where they don't bawl and cry and beat on the altar and cry out and you hear people say whoa we're so glad to have them kind of meetings you know where there's no nobody crying and nobody balling out at the altar and whatever but you know something that just made everybody feel good he said you want to be too human what we need is a is a birth to dine out to bring forth a life he said don't sleep of seed and all potatoes seed potatoes you gotta take that potato and put it in the ground until you can have new potatoes natto potato has to rot a corn cannot produce new life until it's rotten and a man or a woman cannot never have a new birth until their intellectuals and their own self is dead and rotten and die out at the altar and scream and get all messed up to a place that the formality or the starches get out of your collar that's formality inadequate and orders and church orders come on and he said and you're born again by the spirit of god he said i don't care if you squall speak in tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with his head off you're bringing forth new life but we substituted something for it we want the classical way i'm getting at the root of the problem why we're lacking revival because people have never been revived they've never had their own revival 1964 who is jesus he talks about zacchaeus you remember his story of zacchaeus you know getting the garbage can and and getting himself all dirty getting up in the tree and and all that and he's talking about a mess garbage all over me secluded site and he said sometimes god just has to let you get that i heard somebody say you know their new way now here's brother branham concerned about this new way i hope it never gets in our pentecostal realms and it's all over the message realms now though i see it leaking in shake hands i take jesus as my personal savior i like to see them get down there at the altar and die beat and squall and slobber come on you know we used to have some horses when we fed them clover that real pretty sweet clover honey in it it made them slobber when you get close enough to canaan you'll slobber a little too you know eating that honey out of canaan amen i i like to see preaching like that where we preach it in such a way people get to slobber i'm going to confess something right here i'm going to confess something you know i i i rebuked myself for it a whole lot a lot of times but it's got to worry anymore that i i look at my plate of food that we usually fix a plate and set it at the table and we sit down to eat and i look at that plate of food and then i go to praying and my juices start running and i'm wiping my chin before i can quit praying wouldn't it be wonderful amen if we got here in the church and people started eating the good word of god and the juices just start running all over you begin to saliva trade and desire and say give me some more of this i can't wait lord pour it out fill me with your spirit invigorate me energize me get this food on the inside of me you know their new way just say i believe the message i believe brother bannon was a prophet oh yeah yeah you got the revelation you you're you're in you oh i believe the thunders i believe this i believe the perugia oh yeah yeah you're in you're good boy come on just you you'll get over that pornography one day you know what we're criticizing most about youth camp our altar calls say it's only a motion in time evangelism brother branham said it this way he said the scientific theory of the modern so-called religious groups has tried to prove that this blessed thing we have called the holy spirit his only emotion see it just don't stand up according to their scientific theory but i'd like to ask them what makes them change what makes the drunkard stop drinking what makes a prostitute cease her evil life what makes the cancer and diseases depart from the people and the deaf dumb and blind and the dead to raise up explain that is that emotion it has emotion with it certainly anything that's alive has emotion and anything that doesn't have emotion is dead excuse the expression but i think we ought to bury some of our emotionless religion then because because that is dead it has no emotion to it any religion that has not emotion should be buried you see because it is emotional jesus when he entered the city and the the children and them and all the friends crying hosanna him that cometh in the name of the lord and those religionists of that day couldn't stand it it was too emotional said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out see something must cry out because there's life in it but you say brother tell me you know we've got the word today the word the word but when david saw the word the ark returning he danced before the lord is that right amen he rejoiced because the word was coming back and there his wife got embarrassed of his dancing and shouting and rejoicing in front of all israel said you didn't look dignified like a king you know you you disgrace the king's office acting the way you're doing and you you've cut up like that and misbehaved in a presence and she just scolded him real good because she was embarrassed and god cursed that woman with a curse [Applause] you know what the curse was no children that's right that was a cursing that day today oh it's the end thing to do but in that day it was a curse not to have children amen you died you're you're we you know you you had no progeny to go on and they realized the value of life and that that lineage died right there because why a woman left and stormed the rejoicing because the ark was returning and the penalty is somebody with me the penalty for storming and laughing at holy ghost singing and holy ghost rejoicing will mean you'll have no children it'll be a barren church [Applause] that's a curse because we're to bring forth sons and daughters to god amen oh my think of that god hates the powerless religion brother branham kept saying that all the way down past the way past the seals their religion has no power so what he must do in this day every time the bible got outside of the outside this side the bible every time there come a reformation revival it was backed with great signs and powers when luther came forth when wesley came forth when all the reformers thank you finn and knox calvin whoever when they come forth there was power demonstrated where god is he's supernatural where god displays itself there's got to be supernatural amen so my question is today does the true church have this truth to produce the atmosphere where souls can be born in the kingdom remember the days of hezekiah ii king 19 3 and he saw that day as a day of blasphemy and he said they said to him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and a rebuke and a blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there's not enough strength to bring forth amen give us a little more air up here timothy yes no strength no atmosphere churches can be so ice-cold ah you're a little cool this morning you're gonna make me fight for this sermon i'll fight every devil in hell for this one amen now as we think of this atmosphere atmosphere is going to be so important for revival without atmosphere there's no healing got to be an atmosphere of faith without atmosphere there's no salvation there's got to be an atmosphere of faith of believing are you with me amen so so again it's the atmosphere that does it even even brother bowser said you know it's not the hen he said it's the atmosphere he said you can put that that under a pup and the atmosphere would hatch an egg you put it in an incubator and the atmosphere if you got the humidity right and the temperature right it'll it'll hatch those eggs right amen you but again what we need is a holy ghost atmosphere amen an atmosphere where the power of god is moving hey my word we're in one one accord come on together under that atmosphere what kind of accord brother jim expecting god to do things and do signs and wonders amen moving up into that bracket and stepping up in that page where we're where that we get into the dimensions where all things are possible now but you know it'll never happen like that or it's more difficult to happen you get people that are resenting this and that you know i remember and i'm not rebuking you i'm just making you observe something but when we first had our first services back we had to we had to be told where to sit and out of space and you know spacing out and through this building and people we were americans we didn't like it it was all strange and different and whatever it took about three or four services to get a good atmosphere again to get rid of the resentment because god will not bless a resenting audience are you with me amen but when we get in one accord amen the more that we can get in the one accord the more that we can see the spirit move you know you get one of them there now it's time to go we got one i hope you don't preach on that today you got one i don't like what he said there i remember if you get people in one accord where everybody is pulling the same way god speak to us today am i don't leave me behind whatever you do i want to be blessed too if you're blessing this when i'm not scorned and i'm i'm saying god bless me dude don't pass me back cut my way jesus [Applause] amen well you s where you just look and you say i'm expecting great things amen and that expectancy will get that unity among the people that's what happened on the day of pentecost that's what brought the holy ghost down the first place they went up there in 10 days and nights and until they were all in one place and with one accord blessing god for something they didn't have don't hang up on me i want you to get this real loud and clear they were blessing god not for the miracles they've seen but for what they didn't have [Applause] it's one thing for you to bless god hallelujah sister karen's well and healthy but what about what you don't have yet what about that prodigal that's coming home what about the sick that needs healing come on now amen will you begin to bless god for what you don't have yet but what you haven't seen yet and you begin to call down heaven i'm expecting more you gave me a taste of it but i'm gonna have more of it [Applause] that's when god begins to move and when you begin to thank him for what you don't have sister lana got up and run around this place thanking god for what she didn't have there was nothing evident yet in her body and even still weak and bad feelings on the day of the test but hallelujah the test of no cancer why because somebody began to believe in extreme things that god's doing extreme things you might as well get with me i'm going to preach a happier preacher sad amen but i'm going to preach anyway [Applause] amen that's what happened on the day of pentecost they were thanking god for the holy ghost that had not come yet they only had it in seed form what is the seed for promise i've got a promise laying here i've got a promise he'll restore my family i've got this promise here he'll restore my wife he'll restore my children he'll restore my husband come on i've got a promise i've got a promise you'll heal all diseases it's only a seed yet but i'm gonna water the seed hallelujah you ask god for something and he gives you an acorn he said but i wanted an oak tree well i gave you one you water it and take care of it and it'll grow to be one amen you ask for healing god gave you a promise it's a seed so i wanted healing i gave you healing where did you give it i gave it to your calvary my blood paid for it don't just stain my blood in the purchase of my blood i paid for your healing now go to rejoicing wiring that promise believe in that promise until you see it manifested they were blessing god for the holy ghost which had not come yet but they believed it they believed god was going to keep his promise and when they kept blessing god they kept blessing them till the atmosphere got right oh brother 10. do you know you can take a good seed plant it in good ground but for that seed different seeds takes different atmospheres right so you know you plant some things and say and out of season sometimes they won't even germinate until the temperature gets right till the atmosphere gets right come on somebody now we got promises in the word and you say well why don't they work i planted them well did you get the atmosphere right is faith there predominating the atmosphere to change that seed from a promise to fulfillment [Music] hallelujah i said hallelujah can anybody else say hallelujah about that then let's say god help me today to create an atmosphere say brother jim you're trying to work us up i'm trying to get you to elevate your faith to rise another bracket so that there could be an atmosphere in this place where all things are possible to them that believe and it happens when you start praising god for what has not yet happened hallelujah i'm praising god for baron to give birth i'm praising god for prodigals to return i'm praising god for cancers to be healed come on i'm praising god for a good report this week as we come up to the week of tests in august for brother ron spencer i'm praising god for keyless and firemen over covenant virus praising god for your children and your children's children and your mother and your daddy or whoever's a far off as many as the lord i got some call i'm praising him for it and when the atmosphere got right there came a sound from heaven like a rusty mighty wind and it filled the house and all them were sitting got visited by a pillar of fire [Music] are you ready for your visitation this analogy brother branham uses of a birth being a mess he uses it to explain the new birth all the way up till his departure from from from the early years all the way up into 1965. before the seals and after the seals notice this quotation i read from from a deceived church by the world brother branham mentioned the altar two times you know he mentioned there about die out at the altar and scream get all messed up to places to till the starts gets out of your collar he said we'll go over where they don't ball and cry and beat on the altar and cry out those are the two times that it refers to the altar my question has been does the church does it the church have the strength to bring forth do we have strength in this age to push back the lukewarmness and the coldness of this age and become the church that jesus said would be an invincible army that the gates of hell would not prevail against do we have it can the church do it twice he mentions the altar in branham tabernacle sadly to say there hasn't been an altered call in the branham tabernacle for years now literally for years and man the branham tabernacle the voice of god is not a representation of this message that's right their light has gone out well we don't believe in altars that's just a methodist tradition yeah i know i've been in message churches where the altar was taken out of the church set in the basement or just like brother branham said it would be or out in the back room somewhere when i built this church i said i want an altar to go from here to there and i want tears on this altar amen you know what sure brother branham was against using sentimental reasons to come remember your mother died and and she would want you to go to the altar and get saved and oh mama wants you to be a good boy once you go down and give your heart to christ you know and you do it for mama or you do it because some other reason sentimental you and i've been friends a long time why not go down to altar with me and get saved it never works but it can please god some time to have an altar call brother branham said in 1964 i believe god's going to do some great things tomorrow i'm hoping he is that's the reason i make altar calls do everything i can to find favor with him so an altar called be done brings favor with god oh yeah you know you say but it's a tradition there's a lot of things that are traditions we come to church on sunday and wednesday that's a tradition that's a custom of ours to come and honor the resurrection it's a tradition but it's a good one right yes amen we break into midweek it's our tradition to break in the midweek to come to church and break into midweek to to fear get on something spiritual and face the the weekend right well then we have sunday to face the rest of the the week coming up and honor the resurrection a tradition but he said in testimony on the sea in 64 we've gone off without the old-time prayer meetings and the baptism of the holy ghost coming back until the fire burnt low you can cry out and try to get people to they all turn they'll just walk up like they were dead a dread to come and then ask ministers to come pray with them and oh he said what do you call me for and they get down there and you can hardly get them and they stand there just a few minutes and look up at you and go back and sit down in the seat he said to me the fire is going out something has happened listen what we need is revival that sinners looking upon christ repent run to the altar with their hands up screaming for mercy and the whole church is a flame of fire with the glory of god he says in 63 he said what the world needs today is a good old time saint paul's revival and the bible the holy ghost back again where the spirit of god falls among the people and signs and wonders appear like sparks off of an anvil yes sir we need it that's what we have to have it hold together now nowadays we got the new way we're just born by natural birth into the message and you know we want to help them out of the shell and so on and you can't help with the way you're living you know you just live in this whole flesh and you can't overcome the flesh and we try to help them help them out make it a little easier on it's like picking a chick out of the shell we kill them somebody with me amen what we need is an old-fashioned prayer altar where they pray through i'm quoting your prophet until using themselves to come in god's provided way they free themselves from the world that's exactly right you know even eagle has to say we're eagles by the time we're not a chick we're an eagle well even eagle has to pip his way out that's right you know again there he is as he tries to to pick to pimp his way out and beat his way out of that old shell you know what happens we hear well days and miracles are passed you don't have to do that anymore you know we we we we got a more dignified way of coming today but but again the nature within it says peck a hole in it it might knock a hole in it and he begins to knock until he gets a little bit of that atmosphere in the shell and he says i know there's a better world out there because i got some of that atmosphere coming down in my shell and begins to beat on that until it it finally breaks out of the shelf amen and he practically on that cell as hard as he can satan get away from here amen i'm coming out here i'm not laying in this whole shell anymore amen i'm pimping my way out because i'm an eagle [Applause] amen how do you pick your way out thus saith the lord god saith the lord god said the lord you've made me a promised lord the devil's over here saying i'll give up you know you'll never get the holy ghost and you knock a little harder [Music] come on you say brother tim but that ain't the way it happens it is the way it happened brother branham said when i got saved he said i began to cry said god save me somehow save me what have you got to do save me and he said the devil said to me you have already sinned away your day of grace and he said i used it against him and i said oh god i know i may have send away my day of grace but i'm coming on anyhow and he said i pecked my way into the baptism of the holy ghost amen let me get to my subject all of that's preview how to view things get off my chest get you ready in an atmosphere there was samson samson was raised up to destroy the enemy and we're raised up to cast satan out and a rule from the supernatural to tear down the gates of hell is that right that's what the church is to do the gates of hell will not prevail against it so we must be tearing it down amen we're raised up to cast out devils that's what salvation is that's what healing is is casting out devils amen we are to rule from the supernatural that means we are to rule over the supernatural realms of satan's kingdom he minds us we now mind him no more has to do what we say we don't do what he says amen here samson was predestinated how many is predestinated predestinated ordained by god is his mother the church gonna say it that way visited by an angel telling my i'm going to bring forth an offspring out of out of here out of the church and it's going to have it's going to have seven locks it's going to be covenanted with god he's going to have seven locks representing seven church ages and and his covenant with god in every age represents a nazirite vow that i surrendered to god and i'm dedicated to god consecrated that's what a nazarite vow was it was to consecrate them and set them apart and made them peculiar and we as a church must never lose our peculiarity we are to be different we are to dare to be different see young people young people say i want to be like them no that's not the way it's supposed to be you are not to lose your identity as a christian amen and there you know the the man knew the power of god why you know sometimes he would be caught up by out in the open and no weapon and a thousand philistines you know would be be surrounded him and a new jawbone that's what the bible said a new jawbone of a of an ass was laying there and he picks that thing up well a new one you know is a little different from a hardened one it's still soft and it don't look like it would absolutely would go through the helmets of those philistines it it it looked like it could never overcome against the enemy and the the innumerable army that was around them are you with me yeah a thousand of them but that's innumerable when you're just one are you with me amen it's a big army and here you won but yet you just pick up a fresh promise said i've never tried this one before hey there's all kinds of promises in this world you've never tried before amen but in a defeat oh it's the word it'll defeat the devil anywhere any place anytime under any conditions so the devil's got him surrounded he looks around for something to fight with there's a jawbone of an ice you know sometimes your promise looks mighty weak you you mean this promise if i believe this it's really going to defeat this big old devil that's really coming against me well no it won't lay in there on the dirt it won't defeat nothing laying here in the scripture it's not dirt but see my analogy laying here covered up in all the other promises it'll not defeat an enemy lay it over there on somebody's sick it'll not defeat him but if you will take that promise into a hand of faith and realize you have been called and ordained to cascade out as the bride of jesus christ is somebody with me and you begin to smite that enemy oh brother demons are going to start falling everywhere and all samson had to do was feel right back here and he said but i've got a covenant with god amen amen thy seed shall possess the gates of thine enemy and as long as he can reach back there and feel those seven locks that was representative of god's covenant there was nothing going to bother him as long as he remembered that covenant promise and nothing can bother the church of the living god as long as we can feel the holy ghost the covenant of god's word and our heart and the pentecostal blessing by the way that was taken from a 63 quote amen fill that holy ghost the covenant of god's word in our heart the pentecostal blessing most message folks today don't know what a pentecostal blessing is amen but these these that are being scorned as these peculiar ones they still got seven locks they hadn't went beyond the prophet's message to an eighth age come on but they're there with the fullness of the word from paul's gospel to paul's gospel again in the last church age are you with me amen from alpha to omega and they feel right back here and say yeah he's the same yesterday today and forever and this promise is just as good today as it ever was pick it up in your hands and use it against your enemy the works that i do so you do also the life that i have in me will be in you as the father has sent me so send i you how did the father send him this father that sent him within him somebody with me amen jesus sins of man goes in the man it isn't the man it's jesus amen it wasn't it wasn't him it wasn't samson brother branham would describe him as a puny little runt amen a like boy amen but he had it he had a hidden power on the inside of him and when the spirit of the lord would come upon him huh there wasn't a job too big there wasn't an army too big there wasn't gates too big there was nothing too big for samson that early church cast out devils raised the dead healed the sick they wouldn't even get in the shadow of peter just let the shadow pass over them that's all it took amen delilah samson had a fatal attraction he had a fatal attraction to harlots so has the church had a fatal attraction to harlots and they've joined themselves with roman catholic and methodist and baptist and pentecostal and message denominations because he had an attraction to harlots who is this delilah who shaved the power delilah isn't a person not today delilah is a spirit and spirits never die amen it's in that communicable spirit we're all one and everybody and everything is acceptable it's people's rights just lay down and go to sleep just sleep on my lap then the next day you know a cancel culture you know also known as group shaming where you're shamed by the world for not letting gays have their sweethearts that they don't have a heart attack they don't care what i say out there daniel listen anyway i said brother tim you got hate in your heart no i got love i got the greatest love for gay people much love for gays as i do for harlots and and prostitutes we love them and we want them cease them saved and delivered we want to see them filled with the holy ghost and make heaven their home we don't want anybody lost amen the worldly group changed you for not accepting sin you know for not accepting can i go down this line just a minute the black lighter the black lives matters in their lgbt movement and their objection to the nuclear family a mother and a dad in a family a worldly group changed me for not accepting that for not accepting the exploiting of our women and pushing them out into careers when they were made by god to nurture children can i quote you the bible to be keepers at home amen we don't want that we don't want that red today brother tim that's not one even in message churches we don't want that said today listen before you misunderstand me i have nothing against a young girl going to get my education and getting a you know getting something that could help her family in future times but her goal should be to get married to have children and nurture them to raise them for god and not be swept away in this idolatry of women worship today i hope you understand that we're not criticizing somebody that's unmarried because they got a they got education went and got them a job god bless you and man you know when you get when you do get married you can be a homemaker and raise your children the time comes and the children are gone you help your husband or do whatever you know there can be be things that you can use we're not condemning that but we are condemning this feminist move today that pulls the woman out of the home and out of position where she's no longer subject to your husband i just saw some eyes roll and say get off that soapbox maybe i ought to get on it a little more rub a little more soap in a man delilah and you lay down in her lap and the first thing you know your power is cut off again we're not condemning someone that's got to help their husband and situation some summer merit that but i'm talking about i'm just talking about the general goal the church's chipped her cup of her fornications that that worldliness of the council culture their communicable we're all one the people's rights we're all to be alike and the same and you know you you can't be different and they've drank out of it that's right they they deface memorials because really the memorial that they're really trying to face deface we see it in america where they want to wipe away and deface and get rid of the men who wrote the constitution and stood for the godliness as they knew it and made this a christian nation and they want to they want to deface the monuments that's right stop right there for a minute how many members me i can't remember when it was 10 15 could have been 20 years ago preaching on the defacing of a monument anybody remember that brother daryl you do okay there's one you got a good memory god bless you where's the rest of you karen do you remember that i meant she's had a brain bleed what's your problem the facing of a monument and what they want to do is deface the original writers of the bible and say the days of miracles are past and turn us into a bloodless religion where the power of god don't work in the people it's all happening right here we see it on what front is happening right in the other front and i'm protesting i'm saying it's wrong amen i'm saying the word of god is true and the book of acts should be our goal to write another book of acts in this day come on amen to put forth another branch brother branham said it tripped a cup of her fornication to the mouth of god's church that's been raised up to show his last signs and wonders as jesus last commandment was to do in mark 16 and has left them stripped standing strip denying the power thereof denying the holy spirit denying the power to speak with tongues denying the power of the holy spirit to raise the dead and heal the sick and cast out devils and he said now the church is weak and the philistines are on you now sampson stripped him of the power trying to find out what strength he had where did your strength lie it lay in the word not not theology the word a person your covenant with him your experience with him and and they say and and they shaved off the locks by saying it don't mean that and the days of miracles have passed and and there's no such thing as as this or that you know we actually get the holy ghost different than they did in the book of acts but you know again i just want to ask today who is the crop of new hair you see the end of samson was not just being blinded and grinding at the devil's wheel round and around and around and let me just tell you my friend you go around and you play with the devil man or woman i tell you what he'll do he'll blind your eyes and he'll put you around at the devil's will and you'll just go around and around serving the devil that you were raised up to destroy but who is that crop i'm seeing something different than a blind church i'm seeing something different than a weak church that's in prison come on a man that's grinding at the devil's will using one little street he has to work for the devil i'm seeing something different i'm seeing a new crop of hair i'm seeing faith begin to rise i mean i'm seeing the power of god coming back in the church i'm seeing a level of expectancy begin to happen amen i'm seeing an atmosphere that says oh my the devil hadn't noticed but we're here we have arrived amen the people who are now back in covenant with god again who believe that word of god just take me to those two posts because satan's kingdom's about to come down because we're leaving out of here amen in the most glorious shout [Applause] amen with a greater victory than ever the church ever had in all the ages brother branham said samson began to think wonder if there's a possibility i know my hair has grown out but i'm blind there could be a possibility of another revival and he says there is a possibility amen and he shows it there of this little boy that he had to lead him up to the two post just put my hands on this post let me let me lean on this post and there is he's leading on the post you know he began to think god is still god the church may have failed him and went into the dark ages and we might have got down here the end time and people made two lords out of him and they made a perugia and then they made a seven thunder cults and they made this and that come on but god is still god one went over in formalism the other went over to emotionalism but god's still god amen i put him to the trust i know he remains god it's me that's been wrong i wonder if we could if we could be like samson where they didn't notice the tears was coming down his face they even noticed and pray in a prayer like brother branham prayed for himself god created me a revival i wonder if there could be a people today that could pray that prayer like brother branham did and recognize in your day and his message god created me a revival let me be the revival let each of us be the revival the revival in me lord make me to hunger how many can say lord make me to hunger again i see you young boys there playing with your video games i wonder how many tapes have you listened to amen god put a hunger in our young man then video games is the worst a waste of your time get in the message get in the word hear what god said in this day when long ago we had a youth camp and the holy spirit moved and demons were cast out everywhere we had 10 manifestations of demonic powers and god brought deliverance in young men and here in the next thing you know piles of game boys and man and videos and video games all this was piled up worth thousands of dollars and we had a burning hallelujah don't let it come back [Applause] don't flirt with it realize we're in the last time realize we got a message we're responsible for realize there's something better to do with your time i'll bring rotten eggs next service by the town well i'll have timothy preach he can dodge better than i can drew you heard him sing said to me last week papa how come you walk like a penguin so i pulled him and william in there i've got this little thing full of pins that's stuck in my toes and stuck in my feet and stuck in my heel and stuck this way in six surgeries that it took when the doctor said son you'd be better off with a without a foot than that foot we're going to work on it but you only have 50 chance of keeping it i laid in the hospital nine days i split the cast open the doctor said his heart was going like this i come out of that hospital graduated from there into a walking cast i would go up into arkansas some of the arkansas boys remember me wayne lawson said i was four or five years old and said all i remember about you brother tim you had this something on your foot i said it was a walking cast and i preached with this walking cast we had a revival blue devil you ain't gonna keep us down no matter what happens pull that cast off of there six weeks later or eight weeks later there in front of that doctor that doctor threw his hands up in the air and tears rolled out of his out of his face and he said son don't you ever thank me for this god brought you through this nothing else but god [Music] and i've used these feet to preach all over the world because the devil can't keep us down he can't stop us [Applause] drew saw me the other day at the at the camp he looked at my feet and he said papa can i look at them toes again i said yep he pulled my shoes off and then he pulled my socks off they pulled some of my toes and pulled and played with them some of them that don't have bones in them and he said papa do veterinarians do they take the bones out of penguins feet so they walk that way but where should we be in this day and hour in this time where we've seen what god has brought us through and what he's done created me lord what's needed in me sometimes you know god has allowed things to be a harness to keep you in the mode that he wants you in make me be a more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are possible forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives let me press to the mark of the high calling in christ now simpson knew what was going to happen he knew what it was going to cost him he knew it would cost him his life but who wants to live in a depraved sorry godless condition are you with me samson began to cry out he knew what it began was going to cost him it would cost him his life he knew that he would die yes and we ought to know too we'll have to die to some of our creeds our own ideas and our own ways and our own ambitions and our own sinful past come on in our and there's gonna have to be a real crucifixion of the old man in order to have this revival but i wonder if we're willing to pay the price i wonder if there's a people that even like tabernacle that are willing to pay the price of a renewed walk with god of a more dedicated and more consecrated more surrendered life i wonder if there's a people that's willing to sell out and brother brad was saying oh god if the body of jesus christ could stand as one and every fiber and every member begin to vibrate with the literal baptism of the holy ghost again not with new members and shaking hands or some creeds but with the power of god and that was sensing he began there and he began to vibrate as he laid hands there upon those two pillars and something began to surge through him and he began to press maybe he didn't move much at first but he pressed some more maybe it didn't move very much at that time but he pressed some more and he he said oh god just once more whatever you have to do lord let it vibrate through me let it empower me let it set me free let me be on fire for god let me shake off this lukewarmness let me get my whole life to you i want to be a sold out son or daughter of god and he began to vibrate under the power of god and those posts begin to buckle and i see them begin to buckle cancer's healed brain bleeds healed and sinners weeping their way to calvary i see satan's kingdom coming down and i see a triumphant bride that's going to leave out of here crucified to the flesh death their own ideals love with jesus and him having the preeminence somebody that loves them with all their heart with all their soul with everything that's within them stripped stripped but raised up to show signs and wonders most of them stripped us speaking in tongues a divine healing stripped to the atmosphere of the holy ghost sometimes not even an amen the other on the other hand just a bunch of fanaticism jumping up and down idolatry in idol worship yet we cry for revival how many wants revival how many would say i want revival in my soul would that be your prayer this morning i want it yeah we we cry for revival but when he comes we treat him like they did then and let him sit with unwashed feet somebody raise up in the spirit of god and holler a man or scream or something like that when jesus happens to pass by they put him out of the church they think it's awful ashamed to disgrace the church to people when it's jesus himself passing by amen oh my you know when you get a blind bartimaeus somebody that realizes their need and they hear that jesus is passing by you can't keep them quiet they began to say oh god have mercy on me don't pass me by i've got to have you i can't i can't let you go you'll be like that woman get a hold of his of his garment i want him but they'd rather leave him with a dirty name saying something against it days of miracles has passed there's no such thing as that it's just emotion when the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever instead of watching him with tears of joy so glad that he's here i'm going to just tell you church i said it today we don't realize what a miracle we have but i'm gonna bring it down to you you don't realize what a miracle you have to have anointed preaching to have anointed singing to have anointing in the pews to have the holy spirit moving to have divine healing among us to see people filled with the holy ghost you don't realize what a miracle that is whether we've got a world that is dying [Applause] and passing out in the laodicea and you've got a chance at revival for your own life i'll tell you if i were you this morning i wouldn't let him pass me by i'd be crying out jesus have mercy on me have mercy upon me because i tell you when you recognize his presence when you really realize that's him among us amen it makes you hysterically amen brother baby said i got hysterical and anyone that gets in his presence that believes him and has faith in him it'll make you hysterically on the day of pentecost when he comes in the form of the holy ghost they got hysterically and when you really believe and recognize it's your opportunity and your pres in your in his presence and you're sure of it he said you'll be like her you'll even get out of order hallelujah i remember sister atlanta getting out of order getting out of her pew and making laps around that bell of this building she got out of order amen but if you want to do something you know for he lets you do it it may be out of order but he'll let you do it anyhow [Music] you get to worship in him praising him come on amen and realize and realizing that i'm in his presence and because i'm in his presence he can heal my my sick body he can save my sick soul he can deliver god's people it isn't that god failed the church as the church has failed him we ought to be standing in a condition instead of letting daejeon have the victory and our enemy's celebrating and calling on their god worshiping him it ought to be us doward victor victorious o jehovah you're our victory having you in our life is our victory you are our joy and we must have you we must have you in our life we must have you we must be the church that's that is the last commission amen the last thing he said unto the church go into all the world and preach the gospel make disciples of all nations he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not to be damned and these signs this ties it together these signs shall follow them that believe how many is the followers of him today and the signs will follow let's bow our heads together let the musicians come oh yeah it burned out his eyes i wondered today at the church what kind of eyesight did this have wonder about the message believers around the world today what kind of eyesight do they have can they see he's still the same can he see that they see that he's still god that he's still the same yesterday today and forever to realize that we were church we were church and brother branham was here we cast out devils we raised the dead we did the things jesus did sin couldn't dwell among us because the holy spirit would call it out i wonder today if we could return to that kind of a church [Music] brother branham told us in 1965 that instead of tearing for the baptism of the holy ghost we let science prove to us the holy ghost was only for the disciples well we got something different today yeah it's different all right but it's strangely so similar to what they got out into nomination it's a powerless cult you've turned to [Music] instead of raising the keeping the divine healing going which he ought to be now somebody said well you know you're sure it's not just a tradition what what we're supposed to be you ought to be now raising the dead and doing great miracles you let satan under your leadership of religious men take the word of god and say it was for another age i hear our prophet saying there ought to be a holy power surrounding in the church that make demons flee instead of that has become a laughingstock he said why is it it's all mechanics and no dynamics [Music] why he said the church ought to be the most in its most glorious stage right now the power of his resurrection great signs and wonders [Music] i wonder if you look in your life today and you say i'm lacking that real dedication and consecration why don't you come back to him now [Music] what's it going to require you that's going to require for you to die [Music] it's going to require you make a full surrender it's going to require that you become sold out and dedicated and consecrated [Music] even brother branham would say they say they have nerve to say wonder what happened to the god of the bible where is that god he said why you choked him out by your creeds and your traditions he said he's still the same god of history he's waiting for his people to call him up out of history but that god remains god he's god forever but our traditions we've taught it away from the people i wonder if that's our condition today around the world isn't it time to come back to god any time to make a full surrender [Music] in the time to say god i really need you i really want to sell out i want to really consecrate i want to be that dedicated son or daughter [Music] can you surrender up some of your pride some of the starchiness get it out of your collar enough just to really worship god could there really be some real tears that comes down and that you wash his feet and you just make him welcome and you say lord here i am remember me remember me would there be somebody here today say remember me lord i i want that real dedication that real consecration i want to make that full surrender i want to be yours lord would you just raise a hand to god and say lord that's me that's me i want it lord i want it with all my heart just hear my humble cry [Music] amen he sees you he knows your heart he knows what's what you're dealing with in your soul that he knows what you need how about your young people about your middle age how about your dads are you ready to really have a prayer altar at your home and really begin to be a a real son of god and lead your family is there something in you that says i gotta have more of jesus i want to make that full surrender father you see every heart lord today [Music] lord we stand in here today and it's not it's not just out there just once more lord but it's right here we're saying just once more once more lord made this new crop this new crop that now who knows who delilah is that knows who that antichrist spirit is that knows that spirit of false doctrine may it be lord those people those people has come to realization i know who delilah is i know what stripped me of my power bring a renewing of the holy ghost today in jesus name i ask you father a new dedication for your glory thank you lord thank you jesus how many would stand together with me say that's me save yourself [Music] enough to really call out to him [Music] i call me won't say [Music] say [Music] all [Music] do not pass [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wow to the past oh [Music]
