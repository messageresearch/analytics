[26:32] they're desiring from you that you would
[26:34] meet that need. May healing come, Lord,
[26:38] oh God, on the wings of this prayer, may
[26:40] it just sweep right into the room where
[26:42] they're at and sickness be rebuked by
[26:46] the mighty name of Jesus. Oh God, those
[26:49] that are here in this congregation and
[26:52] they are lifting up holy hands and
[26:54] worship to you, may it be tonight that
[26:58] they are endued a new with power from on
[27:00] high. That heaven opens to them, Lord,
[27:03] and the blessings flow down into their
[27:06] lives and you lift them up into heavenly
[27:09] places and you cause them to believe for
[27:12] things, Lord, that they even struggled

[27:17] comes, the impossible happens. So may it
[27:20] happen tonight that faith come in lives

[37:20] Amen. And I trust you came expecting
[37:21] tonight,
[37:23] expecting him to be God and to move as
[37:26] only God can move. Amen. Let's just go
[37:30] to him in prayer this evening. Father,
[37:32] Lord, we just come to you, Lord, with
[37:34] our hearts open to you, Lord. Just
[37:37] asking, Lord, that you will indeed move,
[37:39] Lord, in our midst.
[37:41] Touch hearts and lives, Father, and
[37:43] speak, Lord, as only you can do. We ask
[37:48] Lord that you would come and be the
[37:49] discerner, the thoughts and intents of
[37:51] the heart. Lord, you know our needs. You
[37:53] know our situations.
[37:55] You know our struggles, Father. You know
[37:58] things, Lord, we lack, where we lack in
[38:00] our lives. And we just ask, Lord, that
[38:02] you would make up for our lack today,
[38:04] Lord. And let your blood just surround
[38:07] us today. And let your spirit surround
[38:10] us, but not just surround us, but fill
[38:12] us, Lord. And fill every fiber of our
[38:15] being. We pray. We commit this service
[38:17] to you for your glory and for your honor
[38:20] in Jesus name. Amen.
[38:24] Amen. You turn to second Kings if you
[38:26] would in your Bibles chapter 3.
[38:29] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[38:32] the Lord. Had a good time away there in
[38:36] Florida with
[38:39] Adriana and brother Ben and our little
[38:41] grandson. and also was able to minister
[38:44] there at the church there in Sarasota,
[38:45] bring back greetings from brother Danny
[38:48] and the saints there and just had a
[38:50] wonderful time in the Lord and amen. I'm
[38:53] just thankful that God's the same
[38:55] yesterday, today and forever and he
[38:57] moves in his people and he touches lives
[39:00] and you're thankful for that. But here
[39:02] tonight we want to take a thought again
[39:04] on unclogging the faith lines. So we
[39:07] just look at the scripture in chapter 3
[39:09] and verse 6 says, "And king Jehoram went
[39:12] out of Samaria the same time and
[39:15] numbered all Israel. And he went and
[39:18] sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah,
[39:20] saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled
[39:23] against me. Wil thou go up against go up
[39:26] with me against Moab to battle." And he
[39:28] said, "I will go up, and I am as thou
[39:30] art, my people, as thy people, and my
[39:32] horses as thy horses." And he said,
[39:35] 'Which way shall we go up?' And he
[39:36] answered the way through the wilderness
[39:39] of Edom. And the king of Israel went and
[39:41] the king of Judah and the king of Edom
[39:43] and they fetched a compass of seven days
[39:45] journey. And there was no water for the
[39:48] host and for the cattle that followed
[39:50] them. And the king of Israel said, "Alas
[39:52] that the Lord hath called these three
[39:54] kings together to deliver them into the
[39:56] hand of Moab." Amen. His faith didn't
[39:59] last very long, did it? But Jehoshaphat
[40:02] said, "Is there not here a prophet of
[40:04] the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord
[40:07] by him? And of and of one of the king of
[40:09] the Israel's servants answered that here
[40:11] is Elisha which poured water out of the
[40:14] hands of Elijah." And Jehoshaphat said,
[40:16] "The word of the Lord is with him." So
[40:18] the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and
[40:20] the king of Edom went down to him. And
[40:22] Elisha said unto the king of Israel,
[40:25] "What have I to do with thee? get thee
[40:28] to the prophets of thy father, and to
[40:30] the prophets of thy mother. And the king
[40:32] of Israel said unto him, Nay, for the
[40:35] Lord had called these three kings
[40:36] together to deliver them unto the hand
[40:38] of Moab. And Elisha said, as the Lord of
[40:41] the hosts liveth before whom I stand,
[40:43] surely were it not that I regard the
[40:46] presence of Jehoshaphat, the king of
[40:49] Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor
[40:51] see thee. But now bring me a minstrel.
[40:54] When it came to pass when the minstrel
[40:56] played that the hand of the Lord came
[40:58] upon him and he said, "Thus sayaeth the
[41:00] Lord, make this valley full of ditches.
[41:03] For thus sayeth the Lord, you shall not
[41:05] see wind, nor shall you see rain, yet
[41:08] valley shall be filled with water that
[41:10] you may drink, both ye and your cattle
[41:12] and your beast. And this is but a light
[41:16] thing in the sight of the Lord. And he
[41:19] will deliver the Moabites also into your
[41:22] hand." Amen. and God bless you. Be
[41:25] seated this evening.
[41:28] We spoke um last time here on unclogging
[41:32] the faith lines just to bring it back is
[41:35] means to remove the barrier or obstacle
[41:39] that is standing in your way or
[41:41] disconnect or the disconnect or that has
[41:44] disconnected the connection of your
[41:46] faith to God. is to clear out anything
[41:49] that hinders the flow of faith to bring
[41:53] the word to life. And I brought it from
[41:55] this thought where this this thought
[41:57] what brother Brandon talks about. He
[41:58] said the only thing that hinders the
[42:00] human race today from being superior and
[42:03] controlling like he did or they did Adam
[42:07] did in the beginning is because that the
[42:09] power lines or the outlets of God made
[42:12] in the human being has been clogged up.
[42:16] Sometimes theology, sometimes church
[42:18] doctrines, he would say other things,
[42:20] time, things of life have clogged up
[42:23] your faith lines, clogged up your lines
[42:26] till you have been taught that these
[42:28] things can't be. And that puts a block
[42:31] in the way. It also things that'll clog
[42:34] up the faith line is of course to allow
[42:36] doubt and unbelief to come in and hinder
[42:39] your faith. And this is where we saw in
[42:42] our reading, Amen. And as they would
[42:44] walk and come to a a bit of a hard time,
[42:46] they automatically they the king, he was
[42:50] ready to return and go back. We see why
[42:52] because he wasn't really depending upon
[42:54] the true and living God, but he had
[42:56] raised up false idols and false gods and
[42:59] and had a lot of doubt and unbelief in
[43:01] his life. And and you know, and and also
[43:04] another thing that can clog up is to
[43:05] become complacent or stagnant in your in
[43:09] your spiritual walk. Amen. where where
[43:11] you don't pri prioritize spiritual
[43:14] growth and and you seek comfort over
[43:16] growth or you fail to self-evaluate
[43:19] evaluate which can lead to a blocked or
[43:22] stagnant faith. Now looking at this word
[43:25] stagnant it means it's not flowing or
[43:28] without inflow or out and and outflow
[43:32] because you can have an inflow but if
[43:33] there's no outflow you it's still
[43:35] stagnant waters or you know of course if
[43:38] you have just outflow then you're going
[43:39] to just dry up. You can actually go down
[43:42] we we we was there at the Dead Sea and
[43:45] the Dead Sea is a got a lot of minerals
[43:47] and things there underneath it but
[43:49] there's no life on the inside of it. No,
[43:51] no fish, nothing that can live in it
[43:53] because it's all salt because it just
[43:55] has inflow coming out or coming in, but
[43:58] there's nothing going out of it to keep
[44:00] the water pure and to keep it clean. But
[44:03] we know as Christians, we have not been
[44:05] planted in the Dead Sea or in a stagnant
[44:07] water, but we have been planted by the
[44:09] rivers of living water. This is what
[44:12] David would would say in Psalms 1 as as
[44:14] he would say, "Blessed is a man that
[44:16] would not, you know, I just paraphrase
[44:18] it would not join up with the scoffers
[44:20] or or the ungodly people." Amen. Not
[44:23] connect with them, not sit in the seat
[44:25] with them. You know, scoffers that say
[44:27] the days of miracles are passed or or
[44:29] the baptism of the Holy Spirit is just a
[44:31] makebelieve. He said, "Blessed is the
[44:33] man that'll not do that. Blessed is the
[44:36] man that'll not stand in such a place."
[44:38] They you can't mix two those two
[44:40] together. You can't mix those things.
[44:42] Blessed is the man who won't assemble
[44:44] himself into one of those things that
[44:46] deny the power of God. Amen. The Bible
[44:49] says, "Come out from among those, for
[44:51] the day will come when they'll be heady,
[44:53] high-minded, lovers of pleasures more
[44:55] than lovers of God, having a form of
[44:57] godliness, but denying the power
[44:58] thereof. From such turn away. But
[45:00] blessed is the man that'll not assemble
[45:02] himself with scoffers or those that make
[45:05] fun or those that are calling the church
[45:07] true church of the living God a bunch of
[45:09] fanatics. But that man, he shall be like
[45:12] a tree that is planted by the rivers of
[45:16] waters. In other words, God has put him
[45:18] in a choice spot. I want you to
[45:21] understand this evening, you have been
[45:22] placed in a choice spot. Amen. To be
[45:25] placed in the message of the hour. to be
[45:27] placed, amen, where the rivers of water
[45:30] have flowed, amen, and can come and flow
[45:32] through your life and and clean out
[45:34] unbelief and clean out sin and clean out
[45:37] doubt and and clean out all these things
[45:39] as Satan wants to put blockages in your
[45:41] life. But you have been planted in a
[45:43] place, amen, a choice spot. And
[45:46] therefore, you can bring forth leaves
[45:48] and and you can bring forth fruit in
[45:50] this season. Now, watch how David worded
[45:52] that. He said, "This man is blessed. He
[45:54] has been planted." In other words, he's
[45:56] not just set out somewhere, but he has
[45:59] actually been planted. And I I want you
[46:01] to understand, we have been planted in
[46:03] good ground. Amen. In the ground of the
[46:06] word of God that can bring forth life
[46:08] and life abundant. Amen. Not and and
[46:11] it's rivers of water. It's not just a
[46:13] little trickle that we're dealing with
[46:15] here tonight. There's enough water to go
[46:17] around for everyone tonight. There's
[46:19] enough water that can wash through your
[46:21] life tonight and cleanse all the doubt
[46:24] and cleanse all the unbelief and cleanse
[46:26] it that faith can operate once again as
[46:29] it did in the beginning. But you know,
[46:31] he said a man that's a Christian that
[46:33] rests his eternal destination upon some
[46:36] denominational creed. He's not in his
[46:39] right place. And let me let me bring
[46:41] this on down because a lot of times we
[46:42] look at denominational creeds and we put
[46:45] it in Methodist or we put it in Baptist
[46:47] or even Pentecostal. But let me tell you
[46:49] there's a lot of denominational creed
[46:51] that's even under the opice of the
[46:53] message. Amen. That men have lifted up
[46:56] their own ideas and their own
[46:58] understandings over what the word of God
[47:00] says. Amen. And so this is where he says
[47:03] you're you're not not but when you rest
[47:06] your eternal destination upon the word.
[47:08] Amen. and not on some denominational
[47:10] creed because if it's in some creed it's
[47:13] not in the right place but we have been
[47:15] born to be free we have been born to be
[47:18] children of God to worship God but we've
[47:20] come under crees and we where we can't
[47:23] bring forth fruit except something
[47:25] inside of us is longing to do it he said
[47:27] but he shall be like a tree that's
[47:30] planted by the rivers of water rivers
[47:32] plural water singular many rivers coming
[47:36] in through one channel. Many rivers
[47:39] coming through one channel. Amen. You
[47:42] You could look at it in another light.
[47:44] Amen. We have been planted, Amen. in an
[47:46] inexhaustible fountain of God. Amen.
[47:49] It's not a trickle. It's not just a
[47:51] little drip drop. It's not just a little
[47:54] barely happening or barely water here
[47:57] enough to do anything. But God has
[47:59] placed us in a place where the fountains
[48:02] of life can flow through us and change
[48:05] us and wash out all the creeds and
[48:08] dogmas of men. Wash out scientific ideas
[48:11] that we put above the word of God. Wash
[48:14] it all out and let the waters of his
[48:16] spirit flow through our lives. I don't
[48:18] know about you, but that's what I want.
[48:19] I I want his clean waters flowing
[48:22] through me. I don't want to be in some
[48:24] stagnant place where I haven't seen
[48:26] growth or I got a lot of wiggle tails as
[48:28] it were. A lot of you know you you set
[48:30] out a bucket of water and ain't too
[48:32] long. Amen. You can go back over there
[48:34] and there'll be some little wiggle tails
[48:36] or little mosquito lava in there. How
[48:38] many ever looked at that and said, "Boy,
[48:40] I want a drink of that." No. Not one
[48:42] person in his right minds ever looked at
[48:44] that. I guess if you got thirsty enough,
[48:45] you might, but listen, we ain't We're
[48:47] not afforded, Amen. some bucket of water
[48:49] set over there. Amen. and it's just a
[48:51] stagnant p stagnant pool and there's no
[48:54] light no life in it no more and it's
[48:56] full of dirt and unbelief and things.
[48:59] Amen. That's not what we're drinking
[49:00] from this morning or this evening. We
[49:02] are drinking from the inexhaustible
[49:38] Here's
[49:50] my analysis of Christ Jesus. He's the
[49:53] inexhaustible fountain of life. And
[49:55] every man that's planted in him can
[49:57] drink and drink and push out, push out
[50:00] to every redemptive blessing that God
[50:03] has promised. It belongs to you and it's
[50:06] your personal property. Amen. Amen. Push
[50:09] out. That's the way a Christian is.
[50:11] We're planted together in Christ Jesus
[50:13] in a who is an inexhaustible fountain of
[50:16] life. We're planted in Christ. We just
[50:18] drink and drink and drink and push out
[50:20] everything we have need of for this
[50:22] earthly journey. Divine healing. Drink
[50:24] in and push out. Amen. You What is it?
[50:28] You drink in the scripture. You drink in
[50:30] the word. You drink in the presence of
[50:32] God. And it washes you and it washes
[50:35] that infection out of your body. washes
[50:37] that cancer out of your body. Amen.
[50:39] That's what you're doing. You're
[50:41] drinking in and you're pushing out.
[50:43] Amen. Divine healing, baptism. He said,
[50:46] "Here, you've received the baptism of
[50:47] the Holy Ghost. You're planted in
[50:49] Christ." The Holy Ghost baptism,
[50:52] everything you have need of for this
[50:54] life journey, even the rapture is right
[50:57] in you then.
[51:00] Hallelujah. Amen. So, what are you
[51:02] doing? You're going to drink in and
[51:04] you're going to push out a new body.
[51:06] Amen. That's why you can't ever get
[51:08] through drinking. Can't get enough of
[51:10] him. You can't get enough of his
[51:12] presence. You can't get enough of his
[51:13] word. You can't get enough of of him
[51:16] moving in your heart and life. If you
[51:18] find yourself in that, you're in a
[51:20] stagnant place right now. But he's an
[51:23] inexhaustible fountain here tonight to
[51:26] make manifest any divine promise of God
[51:28] to anybody that'll believe it. Yes, sir.
[51:30] Only thing you do is drink. Come to the
[51:32] fountain and drink. Drink until you're
[51:34] satisfied. You cannot exhaust him.
[51:39] Hallelujah. Amen. The saying goes, you
[51:42] can lead a horse to water, but you can't
[51:44] make him drink, right? Well, I mean, we
[51:45] can bring water to you tonight, but you
[51:47] got we can't make you drink it.
[51:50] Amen. It's got to be to you that says, I
[51:52] need a drink. I need a fresh I need a
[51:55] fresh drink of that Pentecostal water. I
[51:58] I need a fresh drink of the Holy Ghost
[52:00] tonight. I need a fresh drink of his
[52:03] word that can come and and energize my
[52:06] life again.
[52:09] Amen. You know, you can drink in your
[52:11] healing. You can drink in your
[52:12] salvation. Let him that's thirsty come
[52:15] and drink. But many times too many
[52:17] people have got their thirst quenched on
[52:19] other things.
[52:21] And they're not thirsty enough when they
[52:22] come to church.
[52:24] Come on. We thirsty enough to have a few
[52:27] songs. Thirsty enough to have a few
[52:29] moments, you know, and but but but we we
[52:32] ought to be ready to just drink in
[52:34] because he's inexhaustible.
[52:36] He ain't ran out. He ain't ran out of
[52:38] his spirit. He ain't ran out of his
[52:40] power. He ain't ran out of his abilities
[52:42] to heal and deliver. He's not run out.
[52:44] You cannot exhaust him. You might be
[52:47] exhausted tonight, but you cannot
[52:49] exhaust him.
[52:53] You know, I I hope y'all got those
[52:55] pictures. I sent them. I was just this
[52:57] week, you know, I said with u brother
[53:00] Danny Steamman and we went on a couple
[53:02] times we went on a kayak, went fishing,
[53:05] and uh he wanted to take me to this
[53:07] place and and I didn't know it, but he
[53:10] kind of been studying along some of
[53:11] these lines, too. And but uh we went
[53:14] into this this uh place right here. Go
[53:16] back go back to that first picture. And
[53:18] it's it it's a place that um was at one
[53:23] time a very beautiful beautiful area.
[53:25] It's a little inlet and and go go now
[53:28] you go to the next picture and you can
[53:29] see how how right there that little
[53:32] water that's the same picture but
[53:34] there's a little water there line. And
[53:35] so we was out there going in these
[53:38] kayaks and we were going down this inlet
[53:40] and he said I like to go out to where
[53:42] this he said I understand some
[53:43] hurricanes come through and it opened up
[53:45] this midnight pass they called it they
[53:48] call it and he said you still he said
[53:50] when I was a kid my dad would actually
[53:51] bring me to the spot and we'd fish he
[53:53] said but you know he said we're just
[53:55] paddling along talking he said you know
[53:56] what happened he said he said there was
[53:58] a couple of guys that owned that land
[54:00] right next to that pass on either side
[54:02] and the and the and that water coming
[54:04] out was starting to mess up their
[54:06] property. So, they got permission to
[54:08] fill it up as long as they opened up
[54:10] another spot, but they never did keep
[54:13] the other spot open. And so, as they
[54:15] filled up this path, go back to that
[54:16] other picture. And this is what it was
[54:18] just a few years ago was uh this looked
[54:21] like this. And so, just in the last
[54:22] couple years, these hurricanes have come
[54:24] through and it opened it up. And so,
[54:26] they saved their property. They saved,
[54:28] you know, what they wanted and what they
[54:30] desired, but they didn't care about
[54:31] anybody else. He said, "And we watched a
[54:33] a piece of water that used to be teeming
[54:36] with wildlife and and and and fish and
[54:40] everything. It become stagnant and it
[54:42] become full of dead leaves and and and
[54:44] dead matter everywhere and and you could
[54:46] just tell it just you couldn't even see
[54:48] the bottom no more. It was so dark and
[54:50] it just wasn't even worth fishing in
[54:52] anymore." He said, "But here along comes
[54:54] a storm and it opens out that pass
[54:56] again. Go to the next one." And so we
[54:58] got around the corner and we come around
[55:00] that that far bend and come up this way
[55:02] towards that inlet and and all the way
[55:04] back even all the way back into that far
[55:06] area was now clear water. You could see
[55:08] all the way down. I was just marveling
[55:10] at his beauty and I I'd been in those
[55:12] areas before and I never saw in the
[55:14] inlets this beautiful water like this.
[55:16] And I was like I was like this is
[55:17] amazing. You can see the bottom. You can
[55:19] see fish swimming everywhere. You we saw
[55:21] sea turtles. We saw all kinds of
[55:23] wildlife because of a of a place that
[55:26] had been opened up that was supposed to
[55:28] be there that nature had opened up years
[55:31] and years ago and water could come in
[55:33] and exchange and come in and go out and
[55:36] come in. What was it doing? It was
[55:37] bringing healing and deliverance.
[55:40] It's bringing clear waters again and new
[55:43] life was coming in and out. But men by
[55:45] their own ideas and trying to save their
[55:48] own little properties, they wasn't
[55:49] concerned about anybody around them. All
[55:51] they was concerned about themselves
[55:53] because they didn't keep their promise
[55:54] and open up something else somewhere
[55:56] else. They tried with their little
[55:58] little man-made deals. I read about it
[56:00] little they didn't even use the right
[56:01] equipment and they barely opened up a
[56:03] little trickle and and but it didn't do
[56:05] what that nature had done. And so here
[56:08] comes along a hurricane and it kind of
[56:10] pushes in and it makes a little entrance
[56:12] and along another one in the same year,
[56:14] I think this was last year, it came
[56:16] another one right down that same place
[56:18] and it blew open the doors and now fresh
[56:20] water can come back and forth and it can
[56:23] exchange it. And now you can see
[56:25] turtles, you can see fish, you can see
[56:27] the bottom and it ain't full of dead
[56:29] matter no more, but it's clear and it's
[56:32] wet and it's just lovely and it makes
[56:34] you want to shout to be honest with you
[56:35] when you look at it. Amen. I thought
[56:37] about that. Ain't that amazing? Amen.
[56:39] Sometimes that we we we've allowed
[56:41] blockages to come up in our lives and
[56:43] and we thought, well, well, we'll open
[56:45] it up over here. And if that don't work
[56:46] out, but the main thing, the devil has
[56:49] stopped the flow of the spirit of God
[56:51] into our lives.
[56:53] Amen. He'll stop it in the churches.
[56:57] Come on, somebody. Cuz somebody's
[56:59] concerned about the way they feel or how
[57:01] they want God to operate. But God ascend
[57:03] along a storm.
[57:06] Amen. Storms ain't always bad. Amen.
[57:09] Storms, Amen, are ways that God works
[57:11] many times. And he'll send along a
[57:13] storm. He'll open up that channel again.
[57:16] What is the idea? Not to destroy you,
[57:19] but to open a channel that he can
[57:21] orchestrate and he can work through
[57:23] again.
[57:25] Hallelujah. Amen. That's what he did
[57:27] with the disciples when they were out on
[57:28] the ocean. A storm come up. It wasn't
[57:31] for their destruction. It's so they
[57:33] could see the glory of God.
[57:35] Come on, somebody. Amen. You might have
[57:38] allowed Satan to damn something up in
[57:40] your life and you don't know how to
[57:41] unclog it. You just wait a little bit.
[57:43] God open it back up if it's
[57:45] predestinated to be open. Amen. If
[57:47] there's a seed of God on the inside of
[57:49] you, Amen. The waters are going to come
[57:52] somehow. Amen.
[57:54] Wonderful.
[57:58] In other words, this man in in Psalms
[58:00] one would be like a man that believes
[58:03] all the word of God
[58:05] where the power of God can flow. And and
[58:08] he said the nine spiritual gifts can
[58:10] flow through one God into into his
[58:12] innermost being. Many rivers, one water.
[58:17] People don't believe in shouting. He
[58:19] said, "The thing of it is they haven't
[58:21] got spiritual joy. The joy of the waters
[58:24] of life that can flow through." Hey, I
[58:27] can understand if you look like what
[58:29] that did look like before. You don't
[58:31] want to shout.
[58:33] You don't feel like I understand. I I'm
[58:35] in good lands. You can't even see the
[58:37] bottom. It looks It looks impossible.
[58:39] There ain't no life around you. I I can
[58:41] understand the doldrrons. I can
[58:42] understand. But if you can get those
[58:44] blockages out,
[58:47] Amen. And you say, "Well, I'm in a
[58:48] season of life." Well, listen. I
[58:50] understand there's seasons you go
[58:51] through and things, but there's also
[58:53] things that you do or can do to prolong
[58:56] your season
[58:57] or don't do. You can prolong your
[58:59] season. Amen. You You can allow things
[59:02] that sits there and cause you to go
[59:04] through dry times or or dark times or
[59:07] hard times, but you've allowed it to
[59:09] block up the flow of God. And it can't
[59:12] bring you that water that can clear out
[59:14] that that that spot in your life. and
[59:17] wash you again so you can feel once
[59:20] again the freedom of his spirit and the
[59:22] joy of God. He said that's what's the
[59:24] matter with Brandham Tabernacle because
[59:26] that unbelief or the cares of the world
[59:28] has bound people until it cannot produce
[59:31] spiritual growth. That's what's the
[59:33] matter with our nation. That's what's
[59:34] the matter with our churches. They have
[59:36] no joy. The joy of the Lord has
[59:38] departed. Amen. Come on now. Amen.
[59:43] That's direct quotes. Amen. They said
[59:45] and he said what happens? He says
[59:47] written one time the scripture kabad
[59:51] the presence of the Lord has departed.
[59:56] It's all that's over our churches
[59:58] because we've left off the original
[1:00:00] foundation and placed ourselves onto
[1:00:03] some creed or denomination and permitted
[1:00:05] the things of the world to dry up our
[1:00:08] experience with God.
[1:00:11] Come on somebody. dry up our experience
[1:00:14] to where the joy of the Lord is gone. We
[1:00:16] can't hardly clap our hands no more. We
[1:00:18] can't lift our hands no more. We sit in
[1:00:20] church with a sigh face. We go about
[1:00:22] life with a sigh face. Well, brother
[1:00:24] Timothy, you don't know what I'm going
[1:00:26] through. No, I don't know what you're
[1:00:27] going through, but I know what God did
[1:00:29] for you.
[1:00:31] I know what God has done for you. I know
[1:00:33] what God has touched your life. And I
[1:00:35] I've seen and witnessed the thing. I've
[1:00:37] seen how Listen, some people have to
[1:00:39] make choices. You have to make choices
[1:00:41] many times.
[1:00:43] Are you going to serve God or you not
[1:00:45] going to serve God?
[1:00:48] There's people that had to make choices
[1:00:50] over their children. Come on. Whether my
[1:00:54] child ain't going to serve God, well, as
[1:00:55] far as me in my house, I'm going to
[1:00:57] serve the Lord. Doesn't matter. I'm
[1:01:00] going to go forward with God. I'm going
[1:01:02] to I'm going to move on into his
[1:01:04] presence. I'm not going to let that
[1:01:05] thing put a dam in my in my experience
[1:01:08] and and dry it up. I'm going to allow
[1:01:10] God to move through my life and change
[1:01:12] me and and open up channels that I can
[1:01:15] go deeper in Jesus Christ.
[1:01:19] This is what happened. Brother Brandham
[1:01:21] brings it right down. And I don't mean
[1:01:22] to hurt anybody feeling, but he goes
[1:01:24] right straight to Arizona. He talks
[1:01:26] about the dry desert.
[1:01:29] He said, "Everything in the desert has a
[1:01:30] sticker on it. Little plant you come
[1:01:33] to." He said, "Don't get near any of
[1:01:35] them. It'll stick you. It always gots
[1:01:37] the stickers right out." out. He said,
[1:01:39] "What is it? What made it a sticker?"
[1:01:41] Because it's got no water. It dried up.
[1:01:44] That sticker is a leaf rolled up for the
[1:01:46] lack of water became a sticker. Thus, it
[1:01:49] is with the church today that when the
[1:01:51] church gets away from the foundation
[1:01:53] fountain of life, when the individual
[1:01:55] gets away from the fountain of life,
[1:01:57] when it gets away from the joys of
[1:01:59] salvation, when it gets away from the
[1:02:01] Lord God, then that person becomes a
[1:02:04] sticker and begins to always find fault.
[1:02:08] always find failure. Always find things
[1:02:10] and lift it up above the word of God.
[1:02:13] Amen. I don't know about I don't want to
[1:02:14] be a person that's just a sticker.
[1:02:18] Come on. I don't want to be that person
[1:02:20] that's stickly and prickly and and
[1:02:22] because I hadn't been in the waters of
[1:02:24] fountains of life.
[1:02:28] No sinner. You come up. I'm well I you
[1:02:31] know I'm tell you who I am. I'm a
[1:02:32] Presbyterian. I'm a Methodist. I'm a
[1:02:34] message believer. Don't talk to me about
[1:02:36] that stuff. Sticker has no fruits. She
[1:02:40] take that plant cactus, put it in the
[1:02:42] land for a few generation where it has
[1:02:43] plenty of water, that sticker will
[1:02:44] unfold, become a soft leaf. What's the
[1:02:48] matter with the church today? It's been
[1:02:50] set into a denomination that's been
[1:02:52] that's put denominational creeds and
[1:02:54] bind bound it. No joy, just a sprinkle
[1:02:57] of it now and then for a revival, a
[1:02:58] little revival here to hold it in. He
[1:03:00] said, "What what it needs to be is to
[1:03:02] come out from among the scoffers and
[1:03:04] unbelievers and be planted by the rivers
[1:03:06] of waters. For there is a fountain
[1:03:08] filled with filled with blood drawn from
[1:03:10] Emanuel's vein where sinners and
[1:03:12] unbelievers can plunge beneath the flood
[1:03:14] and lose all their guilty stain." David
[1:03:16] said that tree as planted by rivers of
[1:03:19] waters. God cannot flow himself through
[1:03:23] a cactus.
[1:03:27] No water. No. Now water represents life.
[1:03:30] We know in Moses the water wilderness he
[1:03:32] smoked the rock and it brought forth
[1:03:34] waters of life to a perishing people.
[1:03:36] And Jesus said as Moses smoke the rock
[1:03:38] in the wilderness so much must the sun
[1:03:40] be lifted up. And he was smitten. Well,
[1:03:43] why was he smitten? So his life could
[1:03:46] flow to the to the believer to make an
[1:03:49] unbeliever a believer.
[1:03:52] This is what he was doing. This is what
[1:03:54] he was showing there in the rock that
[1:03:56] followed him in the wilderness. and he
[1:03:58] smoteed him. And then the next time he
[1:04:00] was to speak to him. Amen. What was it
[1:04:02] though? It was to bring water. It was to
[1:04:04] bring life in a desert. Ain't that
[1:04:06] amazing that God would choose the
[1:04:08] hardest, most unbelievable place to get
[1:04:10] water from?
[1:04:13] That would go beyond any scientific idea
[1:04:15] or maybe even rational thinking that God
[1:04:18] would take a old rock and smite it with
[1:04:21] a rod and gushers of water would listen.
[1:04:24] That was not a trickle.
[1:04:27] It was 2 million people that got water
[1:04:29] from that rock. If it was a water,
[1:04:31] little water fountain like we got out
[1:04:33] there, a little trickle shooting up, how
[1:04:34] long would that take?
[1:04:36] And all their animals watered as well,
[1:04:38] how long would that take? It was not
[1:04:40] just a trickle.
[1:04:42] It was a gusher of a of a power coming
[1:04:45] out of that rock. What a miracle. And he
[1:04:48] said that rock followed them all the way
[1:04:50] through the wilderness.
[1:04:52] And he said he said that rock is Jesus
[1:04:54] Christ. It was showing he never runs out
[1:04:58] of water.
[1:05:00] But in this time, he's already been
[1:05:02] smitten on the cross and his blood has
[1:05:04] flowed. So it's not for us to smite him
[1:05:07] again. It's for you to speak to the rock
[1:05:10] and you speak from to it and from it
[1:05:12] flows rivers of waters.
[1:05:15] And it won't be just a trickle.
[1:05:22] We see
[1:05:24] we see though he said he he said he came
[1:05:27] that he could be planted and he was
[1:05:30] planted and his water his life broke out
[1:05:32] the blood cell and there came forth a
[1:05:35] vine with his roots in glory with his
[1:05:38] branches on earth to produce a church of
[1:05:40] the living God that would show forth his
[1:05:42] resurrection and power. Who is these men
[1:05:45] and women that would deny that church,
[1:05:46] the vine of the living God, and never
[1:05:48] the never failing presence of the Lord
[1:05:50] Jesus with his church to live and show
[1:05:52] forth his predestinated branches that he
[1:05:54] caught before the foundation of the
[1:05:56] world and swore by an oath that he had
[1:05:57] raised them up. His church today with
[1:05:59] the glory of his resurrection living in
[1:06:01] her. I am the vine, you are the
[1:06:03] branches. Every time the heartbeat of
[1:06:05] God beats,
[1:06:08] oh my, the blood flows to the members.
[1:06:13] Every time that loyal heart of God
[1:06:15] beats, it pulsates through the name of
[1:06:18] Jesus Christ to the church. It beats
[1:06:20] whatever you ask in my name. It beats
[1:06:23] and said, "I'm with you always." It
[1:06:26] beats. What is it doing? It's pulsating
[1:06:28] life to the believer. This is why we
[1:06:31] can't allow some blockage to come and
[1:06:34] block off the miracles of God, block off
[1:06:36] the signs of God, block off the gifts of
[1:06:39] God. All right. It's rivers flowing down
[1:06:43] waters to water the church of the living
[1:06:46] God.
[1:06:50] He says,
[1:06:53] he says, he says, "Brother, there is a
[1:06:56] vine growing." There's a wild vine
[1:06:59] growing. He ties it back to the death
[1:07:00] and the pot and all that. I ain't got
[1:07:02] time to go into all that, but he said it
[1:07:04] grows in creeds and denominations
[1:07:06] and when it gets in there, it shuts off
[1:07:09] all the spiritual joy.
[1:07:14] So if you ain't got spiritual joy, now
[1:07:17] I'm talking about a joy that the world
[1:07:18] can't give. I ain't talking about a
[1:07:20] human joy. I'm talking about spiritual
[1:07:22] joy. Amen. Something that ain't tied to
[1:07:25] natural things. Hallelujah. Oh, we can
[1:07:28] get all joyful about, you know, a new
[1:07:30] car, a new house, or new job. That ain't
[1:07:32] the joy I'm talking about. I'm talking
[1:07:35] about spiritual joy. That you can have
[1:07:37] it in spite of what's going on around
[1:07:40] you. That you can have joy in spite of
[1:07:43] whether anybody's serving God or anybody
[1:07:45] ain't serving God. Whether your family
[1:07:47] serving God or whether you're not
[1:07:49] serving God, whether things are going
[1:07:51] right or they're going wrong, whether
[1:07:52] you're sick or you're healed, whether
[1:07:54] you're bound or you're delivered, or
[1:07:55] whether you feel like you're in a prison
[1:07:57] or whatever, you can still have joy.
[1:08:02] It's in the scripture. Paul and Silas
[1:08:03] was in a prison one time and at midnight
[1:08:06] they begin to well, my Bible says, pray
[1:08:09] and sing psalms.
[1:08:11] They didn't begin to moan and groan and
[1:08:14] all they had, all they had done, they
[1:08:16] didn't steal nothing. They didn't rob
[1:08:18] nobody. They didn't kill nobody. They
[1:08:19] just cast out a devil. That's all they
[1:08:21] did. And of course, that messed up the
[1:08:24] people's gang, you know, is getting
[1:08:25] money from that because she was divining
[1:08:28] stuff and doing stuff and and and and
[1:08:30] she was aggravating Paul. And he just
[1:08:32] turned around and said, "Come out of
[1:08:33] her."
[1:08:35] And they lost their gain. So they got
[1:08:37] angry and they throwed them in jail and
[1:08:38] beat them. beat the, as we'd say, the
[1:08:41] fool out of them or the snot out of
[1:08:44] them. However you want to say it, I
[1:08:45] don't care.
[1:08:46] Just beat them to the pulp. And there
[1:08:48] they are bleeding in and stripes. But
[1:08:50] they didn't sit there and moan and groan
[1:08:52] and
[1:08:53] no, they had chains, but they was
[1:08:55] clapping.
[1:08:58] They were bound, but they had their
[1:08:59] hands raised.
[1:09:01] Why? Because their joy was not based
[1:09:03] upon their place where they were at upon
[1:09:06] this earth or some temporary thing.
[1:09:09] Everything that you're going through in
[1:09:10] this life is temporary.
[1:09:14] If you're in a trial, it's temporary. If
[1:09:16] you're in sickness, it's a temporary
[1:09:18] thing.
[1:09:20] So don't get all bound up over temporary
[1:09:22] stuff when you got something to be
[1:09:24] joyful about that God saw you
[1:09:28] and he didn't leave you where he found
[1:09:30] you, but he picked you up out of the mud
[1:09:32] and he washed you and he filled you with
[1:09:34] his spirit and said, "This is my son."
[1:09:37] Amen. That's something to be joyful
[1:09:40] about.
[1:09:43] But blockages come along.
[1:09:46] Things happen.
[1:09:49] Something kills the lifeline.
[1:09:52] You see people wreck today because one
[1:09:55] day they they might have had a little
[1:09:57] joy in church. And I want you to
[1:09:59] understand, I'm not even talking about
[1:10:01] just a jump in a shout. I'm talking
[1:10:04] about being able to praise God with all
[1:10:05] your heart. in spite of the storm.
[1:10:09] Because you know in the storm, he's
[1:10:10] doing nothing but opening up a channel.
[1:10:17] He's opening up a place that he can
[1:10:19] minister to you in a greater way and a
[1:10:22] deeper way. That's what he did the three
[1:10:24] Hebrew children. The fire was nothing
[1:10:26] but a storm to open up a channel.
[1:10:30] The lion's den was nothing but a storm
[1:10:32] to open up a channel.
[1:10:37] I ain't felling bump my head, have I?
[1:10:39] It's the truth, right? Amen. You
[1:10:41] couldn't have had the fourth man without
[1:10:42] the fire.
[1:10:45] We all glory on the fourth man. And we
[1:10:47] do. I love the fourth man, and I want
[1:10:48] the fourth man, but you'll not get him
[1:10:50] unless you go through a fire.
[1:10:53] Amen. We all glory in the angels of God,
[1:10:55] but it's the lines that are around you
[1:10:57] that brings them near. It opens up a
[1:11:00] channel. All
[1:11:02] right. This is what he's trying to do in
[1:11:04] in these services time after time. He's
[1:11:07] trying to open up a channel to show you
[1:11:09] it's more than just living in Leodysia.
[1:11:13] He's trying to blow that that lukewarm
[1:11:15] spirit that wants to permeate our lives
[1:11:18] and permeate our thoughts. I mean, it's
[1:11:20] permeated people's thoughts so they
[1:11:21] can't even think rationally no more.
[1:11:25] We talked about it last Sunday how
[1:11:27] people have got so permeated with the
[1:11:29] smoke and of Leo of the of the pit and
[1:11:31] the and the lukewarmness of Leo. Look,
[1:11:34] just read it. I mean, they're blind,
[1:11:36] naked, and they don't even know it.
[1:11:37] Wretched. They don't even know it.
[1:11:40] That's an insane person.
[1:11:43] Is it not insane person that doesn't
[1:11:45] know they're naked?
[1:11:47] Doesn't know they're blind. Doesn't know
[1:11:49] they're wretched. That's an insane
[1:11:50] person.
[1:11:52] But thank God the story did not end
[1:11:54] right there.
[1:11:56] But he said, "I got something that'll
[1:11:58] open up a channel. I got an eyes that
[1:12:01] you can have. I got true gold that you
[1:12:03] can buy me out of the fire. I I I got a
[1:12:06] overcomer that's going to overcome and
[1:12:09] sit with me in my throne as I overcame
[1:12:11] and sit with my father in his throne."
[1:12:14] It's opening up a channel.
[1:12:18] We talked about this last time about the
[1:12:20] car. Brother Brandom, he said, "Our
[1:12:22] educational systems and our
[1:12:23] denominational systems has taken the
[1:12:25] place of the Holy Spirit leading in the
[1:12:28] church. Our great fine training of
[1:12:30] ministers and things have taken the
[1:12:31] place of all night prayer meetings and
[1:12:34] oldtime wave. We used to get to God. Now
[1:12:36] instead of having preachers, we got
[1:12:38] lectures. Men who knows the word just as
[1:12:41] well. They can sit there and put it
[1:12:43] together in such a way that it's
[1:12:44] astounding how they can do it. They know
[1:12:46] the mechanics, but they don't know the
[1:12:48] dynamics. We want the dynamics. I don't
[1:12:52] care about the mechanics. That's what he
[1:12:54] said. I don't care about the mechanics.
[1:12:56] I want the I know the dynamics. I don't
[1:12:59] know how the car runs out there. I got
[1:13:01] piss got pistons and and cylinders and I
[1:13:04] don't know how much pressure it has to
[1:13:05] have or what has to work just exactly
[1:13:07] right. I'm with him. I That's one thing
[1:13:09] I ain't as a mechanic. I can't stand
[1:13:11] doing it. No sir. I don't know nothing
[1:13:14] about it. I don't know how it operates.
[1:13:16] I've tried till it turned blue in my
[1:13:18] face. said, 'Forget it. Find somebody
[1:13:20] who knows something about it. He said,
[1:13:22] 'But I don't need to know all about
[1:13:23] that. Only thing I want to know is when
[1:13:25] I put the key in there and turn it, it's
[1:13:27] going to start. There's dynamics. You
[1:13:30] put it in there and she'll drive. That's
[1:13:31] the way we know God made the promise.
[1:13:33] I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:13:36] Your sons and daughters shall prophesy.
[1:13:38] How's he going to do it? I can't tell
[1:13:40] you. I just want to know the dynamics of
[1:13:42] God's system. That's the main thing.
[1:13:44] Today we've studied the mechanics until
[1:13:47] it's all mechanical.
[1:13:50] This is where we're at. We've studied
[1:13:52] all the things. It's all mechanical. We
[1:13:54] know all the quotes. We know all the
[1:13:55] scriptures. But we got to have a life
[1:13:57] that'll make that scripture live. It'll
[1:14:00] make it become flesh and stand there and
[1:14:03] cast out demons and speak the winds and
[1:14:05] waves of this life.
[1:14:10] What good is an automobile without
[1:14:12] something in it to drive? What good is
[1:14:14] all these light fixtures that ain't no
[1:14:16] current to make them light up? We got
[1:14:19] all the mechanics. We got schools and
[1:14:21] educators and so forth that can train a
[1:14:23] man till he can stand in the pull pit
[1:14:24] with such manners till he's an eloquent
[1:14:26] person that still don't bring the power
[1:14:28] of God. Where is the power of God that
[1:14:30] used to be in the church? Where is that
[1:14:32] Pentecostal blessing that used to flow
[1:14:34] through the churches? That's the reason
[1:14:35] our world is falling apart because we
[1:14:38] got away from the real principles of
[1:14:40] God.
[1:14:42] That's a key right there. Write it down
[1:14:45] and nail it on the wall or put it on
[1:14:46] your fridge. If your world is falling
[1:14:49] apart, you've got away from the
[1:14:51] principles of God.
[1:14:54] Well, brother Tim, I tell Timothy, my
[1:14:55] world is just falling apart. Well, you
[1:14:56] need to see what's blocking your
[1:14:58] channel.
[1:15:02] Where is the blockage at? And if you can
[1:15:05] get it and you find it, you need to get
[1:15:06] it out. Whether it be bitterness or
[1:15:09] unforgiveness or some complex.
[1:15:16] Well, I tell you what, if I was just
[1:15:17] somewhere else, I could do so much
[1:15:18] better. No, what you need to do is get
[1:15:20] in the word of God.
[1:15:23] Get in his presence, get in his spirit.
[1:15:26] But too many times we follow after other
[1:15:28] things so hard. I was just thinking
[1:15:30] today, you know, just a random thought
[1:15:32] is having. And I said, "People got so
[1:15:33] tore up over mask or no mask, didn't
[1:15:37] they?" Do y'all remember that? Just tore
[1:15:39] up and silly about it. But they didn't
[1:15:42] they don't get near tore up about sin or
[1:15:44] no sin.
[1:15:49] That's that rings pretty good, don't it?
[1:15:52] Well, I mean, we just got all tore up.
[1:15:54] Wouldn't even come to church because
[1:15:55] we're going to not wear mask or not wear
[1:15:56] mask. But boy, we'll no sin. Sin sin. No
[1:15:59] sin. It don't matter.
[1:16:02] Walking around with bitterness, no
[1:16:03] bitterness, don't matter. Unforgiveness,
[1:16:06] no forgiveness, unforgiven, it don't
[1:16:08] matter. Come on. There's things that are
[1:16:10] ch the devil is plugged up that we got
[1:16:14] to get open.
[1:16:16] We got to get it open. If you got some
[1:16:18] against your brother, get it open.
[1:16:22] What brother Brandham talked about. He
[1:16:23] said, "Don't delay. Go right to him
[1:16:25] right now and talk about it. Ask for
[1:16:28] forgiveness. Move on.
[1:16:34] I I just tell you personal testimony.
[1:16:36] It's kind of ironic today. I drove right
[1:16:38] by this house. It was several years ago,
[1:16:41] you know, that I I
[1:16:44] seen they was building a little shed in
[1:16:46] the back of his house and I seen they
[1:16:47] had some people out and I wanted to I
[1:16:49] think brother Joseph Lelay was with me
[1:16:51] and and I just wanted to talk with this
[1:16:53] guy and see who he got to build and what
[1:16:54] you know try because I was wanting to
[1:16:56] build a barn and or something we was
[1:16:58] doing. And so I I just whipped down in
[1:17:00] there and I saw where they drove right
[1:17:01] down to that barn. So I drove right in
[1:17:03] their same tracks. But I got out and I
[1:17:05] got myself a fussing. Uh sure enough
[1:17:08] chewing. What do you think you are
[1:17:10] driving on my grass and just went off
[1:17:12] and I you know I said sorry about your
[1:17:13] day. I get back my truck and I left. But
[1:17:17] you know I'd ride by that house like
[1:17:19] that. Sorry joker.
[1:17:24] What in the world is his problem? I I
[1:17:27] ought to just go talk to him about this.
[1:17:28] It's burning me up. But you know, today
[1:17:31] when I drove by there, I thought, you
[1:17:33] know what? I'm tired of worrying about
[1:17:34] this guy. I said, "Lord, forgive me
[1:17:37] about that." And just forgive him, too.
[1:17:38] If he needs forgiven, let it just let it
[1:17:40] all go.
[1:17:43] Why? Why are we worried about it? Why
[1:17:46] let it run your day or your years or
[1:17:48] your weeks, whatever? And people have
[1:17:50] carried things for so long and it's
[1:17:52] blockages that has sat there and sat
[1:17:54] there and all it is is withering
[1:17:56] themselves up.
[1:17:58] It's choking the very life of God to
[1:18:01] where it can't come down and wash them
[1:18:03] out again.
[1:18:06] People carry things and and sometimes
[1:18:08] it's their own personalities are
[1:18:10] channeled that way. Some people are real
[1:18:11] easy to let things go. Some people are
[1:18:13] ain't.
[1:18:14] But if you ain't, you know what brother
[1:18:16] said? you got a complex. He said, "Do
[1:18:17] exactly the opposite."
[1:18:20] So, what do you do? You're just going to
[1:18:21] start letting it go. I'm done with it.
[1:18:23] I'm finished. I'm going to go over
[1:18:25] there. I make that right. I'm going go
[1:18:26] over here. Open the channels up. Amen.
[1:18:29] So, that clean water can come through
[1:18:31] again. And you can see the bottom again.
[1:18:33] You can see life again. You can see God
[1:18:35] moving in your life again. You can see
[1:18:37] God orchestrating again. But you're
[1:18:40] never going to see it if your waters are
[1:18:42] all muddy and tore up, full of dead
[1:18:44] stuff. Yeah.
[1:18:49] This is where we read our scripture.
[1:18:54] Prophet of God sitting there and I like
[1:18:56] how brother was talking about. He said
[1:18:58] he kind of got his righteous indignation
[1:18:59] up. Looked out there and seen this king.
[1:19:02] He wouldn't listen wouldn't listen to
[1:19:04] him before. So why is he coming to him
[1:19:06] now?
[1:19:09] Yeah. Yeah. He's a man. You know,
[1:19:12] pastors are men too sometimes.
[1:19:17] We get tore up sometimes, you know,
[1:19:19] people. I I was talking to one today. Uh
[1:19:22] you I told him, I said, you know, you
[1:19:23] can't make everybody live right. It
[1:19:25] ain't possible. You can't make nobody
[1:19:27] live right. You can't make nobody
[1:19:29] believe it. I don't care how much you
[1:19:31] preach. You preach to your blue in the
[1:19:32] face. You can't make nobody do it. Is
[1:19:35] they have to make the choice. Amen. But
[1:19:38] he gets so tore up and he's worried
[1:19:40] about this situation that was wanting to
[1:19:42] throw in the towel.
[1:19:44] I just happened to send him a little
[1:19:46] text today. Just had him come on my
[1:19:48] heart. Sent him. He said, 'You don't
[1:19:49] know what this is right now. He said,
[1:19:50] 'If I I'd call you right now.' He said,
[1:19:52] 'But I just prayed I'd just break apart
[1:19:54] and tear tear up. Few minutes later,
[1:19:56] he'd call me and we'd talk about it. You
[1:19:59] know, people people, you know, they they
[1:20:02] they want your advice and they get it
[1:20:04] sometimes and then they go do exactly
[1:20:06] the opposite and it tears everything up
[1:20:07] and they and they come back and they
[1:20:09] want you to fix it all. What they tore
[1:20:10] up in five minutes, you know, and it
[1:20:12] don't work all and it's where the
[1:20:13] prophet was. He's like, "If that man
[1:20:15] Jehoshaphat wasn't here, I wouldn't even
[1:20:17] speak to you."
[1:20:20] He said, "But if you'll just bring me a
[1:20:22] minstrel and they brought him an
[1:20:23] instrument and begin to play the
[1:20:25] minstrel and the atmosphere changed.
[1:20:27] There was a channel that opened. This is
[1:20:30] why it's important to have singing and
[1:20:32] songs and worship. Amen. And why it's
[1:20:34] important for you to join in because it
[1:20:36] opens up a channel.
[1:20:38] Amen. You might come here in a tiff.
[1:20:42] Anybody ever in a tiff when they come to
[1:20:44] church? Oh yeah. Get in a tiff. That's
[1:20:47] that's exactly when the devil's going to
[1:20:49] stir some stuff up on your way to church
[1:20:51] and you start in an argument and you
[1:20:53] come in. I'm going to tell you what I
[1:20:54] ain't going to do.
[1:20:58] But that's why we have it. That's why we
[1:21:00] That's why we want the spirit in the
[1:21:02] songs. That's why we want the anointing
[1:21:04] in the worship. That's That's why we
[1:21:06] fight for it. That's why we will fight
[1:21:08] for it.
[1:21:10] Amen. That's why we'll fight for the
[1:21:11] presence of God to come down. Why?
[1:21:13] Because we know there has to be a
[1:21:15] channel to be opened up that God can
[1:21:17] flow down through.
[1:21:19] If there ain't that channel opened up,
[1:21:21] there ain't no sense in us sitting here.
[1:21:24] But I believe by the presence of God and
[1:21:26] the worship and you just move into the
[1:21:28] other place like Elisha did and said,
[1:21:30] "You know what? Bring me something." And
[1:21:31] brother Rabbit said, "You may not know
[1:21:33] how to play the piano. You may not be
[1:21:35] one of the singers." He said, "But be so
[1:21:37] do something to bring the spirit of God
[1:21:39] down." Amen.
[1:21:44] He said he got up in that other channel
[1:21:47] and he saw a vision.
[1:21:49] He tells him, he says, "Go out in the
[1:21:52] desert and start digging some ditches."
[1:21:54] Now, that was crazy.
[1:21:57] And then water's going to come. Said,
[1:21:59] "Not going to see no wind, no rain, but
[1:22:01] water's going." To the human mind,
[1:22:04] that's don't make sense, right? But this
[1:22:07] ain't about the human mind. It's about
[1:22:09] God's mind. And here he is and he speaks
[1:22:12] to him and he sends them out there and
[1:22:15] they start digging it out. And brother
[1:22:17] Brandon said, "That's the vision today.
[1:22:20] Don't start a new organization. Don't
[1:22:23] start a new idea. Dig out the things
[1:22:27] that are stopping up the blessings of
[1:22:29] God,
[1:22:30] stopping up the the power of God,
[1:22:33] stopping up God from moving in your
[1:22:35] life. Dig it out. It's when those things
[1:22:37] come in and it stops up the flow of
[1:22:39] water. Elijah's vision showed him that
[1:22:41] out in the wilderness where all the
[1:22:43] fruits were dried up in that desert. God
[1:22:46] was going to open up a channel that
[1:22:48] water could come in. And he said, "What
[1:22:50] happened?" He said, "Rocks got over that
[1:22:52] and sand got over that and it built over
[1:22:54] over that bedrock that was laying down
[1:22:56] there in the earth." And he said that
[1:22:58] rock was the same rock that followed
[1:23:00] them through the wilderness.
[1:23:02] Come on, somebody. But it had been
[1:23:04] covered over by unbelief. Sands of
[1:23:07] doctrines had blowed through and it
[1:23:09] covered it all up. And it took somebody
[1:23:11] that would dig down enough and dig down
[1:23:13] all the doubt and past all the unbelief,
[1:23:16] past all the all the old ideas and say,
[1:23:19] you know what? Tonight, I'm digging back
[1:23:21] down to that rock. Because if I know I
[1:23:23] can get to that rock, I can quench thy
[1:23:25] thirst that's going on inside of me.
[1:23:32] He said, "But those lo logs get in the
[1:23:34] channels,
[1:23:36] all kinds of dirt hits up against the
[1:23:38] log and first thing you know, it's
[1:23:40] backed up." He said, "Just like beavers
[1:23:42] do. They they build dams. You know, it's
[1:23:44] how they make them. They bring mud and
[1:23:46] sticks and they they can build a dam
[1:23:48] quicker than anybody. It's incredible."
[1:23:51] But he says, "And there'd be nothing go
[1:23:53] through it." He said, "That's the
[1:23:54] problem. We got too many beaver
[1:23:56] preachers today
[1:23:58] trying to dam up all the water and say,
[1:24:00] "Well, this only here and this is just
[1:24:02] over here and this belongs to us."
[1:24:03] Sounds like them two guys, right? We we
[1:24:06] want to protect what we got. We want to
[1:24:08] we don't need that. We we want this over
[1:24:10] here. He said, "What is it?" He said,
[1:24:11] "And then and then all of a sudden, days
[1:24:13] of miracles are passed. There's no such
[1:24:15] a thing as divine healing. Can't sit
[1:24:17] still five minutes in a meeting."
[1:24:18] Goodness, stagnated water, beaver dam.
[1:24:21] Blow it out. Amen. Blow it out. What am
[1:24:26] I going to blow it out with? With the
[1:24:27] dynamics of the word.
[1:24:30] Amen. There's some dynamite that's been
[1:24:32] afforded us in this day to place against
[1:24:34] those dams. It can place against that
[1:24:36] dam of bitterness and blow it out.
[1:24:39] It can place against that complex and
[1:24:42] blow it out.
[1:24:47] Dig out all those logs.
[1:24:50] Dig out all those feelings.
[1:24:53] Dig out all those hurts.
[1:24:56] Dig out all those fanaticisms and
[1:24:59] everything else that's in the church.
[1:25:00] Clean it out. The rocks already been
[1:25:02] smitten. The water's down there. It's
[1:25:05] fresh and running. But our
[1:25:07] ecclesiastical systems has damned up the
[1:25:09] streams. He said, "Clean those things
[1:25:11] out. You won't hear rushing wind. You
[1:25:14] won't hear neither wind nor see rain,
[1:25:16] but there'll be water." Not a new
[1:25:18] system. Not a new system. We need we
[1:25:19] need a what we need is to clean out the
[1:25:22] system we got.
[1:25:25] Not make another assembly of God or
[1:25:26] another oneness or another brand of the
[1:25:28] message.
[1:25:31] Just clean out what we got. Get all the
[1:25:33] logs out, all the indifferences and
[1:25:35] differences that we have with each
[1:25:36] other, fussing and stewing and things
[1:25:38] like that and get back the waters to
[1:25:40] flowing again. Then there'll be love and
[1:25:42] joy. Joy like a river flowing all over
[1:25:45] body. Just love one another. We're not
[1:25:47] divided. We're one body.
[1:25:49] One in hope, one in doctrine, one in
[1:25:51] charity. That's the way we must do it.
[1:25:54] That is the idea. That is the vision of
[1:25:56] today.
[1:26:01] And he said any true prophet got the
[1:26:04] same vision.
[1:26:06] Not a new organization, not make another
[1:26:09] group.
[1:26:10] You'll just fuss it out and organize it.
[1:26:12] Get just like the rest of it. You'll
[1:26:14] throw logs in there. Also,
[1:26:17] you know, he said when I started out, he
[1:26:18] said they he told me, he said, "You
[1:26:20] ought to start up an organization." I
[1:26:21] said, "Organization?" He said, "That's
[1:26:23] what I'm against. What we need is not
[1:26:25] organization. We need to clean up what
[1:26:27] we got. Clean it up. We need a revival.
[1:26:30] But to get that, you're going to have to
[1:26:32] dig.
[1:26:36] Digging ain't real easy.
[1:26:40] No, you got to do it yourself. Can't go
[1:26:41] get you excavator.
[1:26:43] Got to get your hands dirty. Got to get
[1:26:46] down there with a shovel of the word of
[1:26:48] God. Start digging out those things that
[1:26:50] if you have allowed to cover up your
[1:26:52] life. You know, I I may not know, but
[1:26:55] preachers may not know, but you know
[1:26:58] what it is that is keeping the flow of
[1:27:00] water, keeping God's power from flowing
[1:27:02] through your life. Dig out all the
[1:27:04] ditches. Get down here in the valley. He
[1:27:06] said, he said, "You've been trying to
[1:27:07] just live on the housetop up there some,
[1:27:09] you know, shouting and jumping, freezing
[1:27:11] and frying, everything else. Don't do
[1:27:12] that. Get down here and dig out these
[1:27:14] ditches low here and get some fresh
[1:27:16] water. That's what we need. Get down
[1:27:18] here and get a hold of water. What we
[1:27:20] need tonight is the water of God. The
[1:27:22] vision absolutely interpreted God's will
[1:27:24] to that dying, perishing people. Dig out
[1:27:27] all your faultf finding. Dig out all
[1:27:30] your backbiting. Dig out that stiff neck
[1:27:32] and all those superstition and unbelief
[1:27:35] and complexes. Pull it out.
[1:27:42] He said, "It's either dig or die." He
[1:27:46] said, "But when you dig down and you hit
[1:27:48] that rock, you'll see water flowing
[1:27:50] again. You'll see God moving like he did
[1:27:53] before. You'll see signs and wonders.
[1:27:55] You'll see miracles and the power of God
[1:27:57] returning to the church in a real
[1:27:59] flowing Pentecostal water just coming
[1:28:01] down." Yes, sir. The spirit's message
[1:28:03] was start digging or start perishing.
[1:28:05] They were already perishing. They had to
[1:28:07] dig out. Those things had to come up,
[1:28:09] but they'd hit a log. Well, I tell you
[1:28:11] what, I the doctor said that, "Dig that
[1:28:12] old log out." Well, I got this sickness.
[1:28:14] Dig that log out. Well, I got this
[1:28:16] unbelief. Dig it out.
[1:28:19] Next morning,
[1:28:21] they looked up and there was water
[1:28:23] filled up all of those ditches.
[1:28:27] The enemy looked at it and saw blood.
[1:28:30] Got all scared and worried. Brother
[1:28:33] Brandham said what they did is they got
[1:28:34] those rocks, that rock, and drank of
[1:28:38] that water and gained strength and they
[1:28:40] took that rock and they ran to where
[1:28:42] that enemies were and they drove them
[1:28:44] back in their cities and they destroyed
[1:28:46] their wells and they destroyed them. He
[1:28:48] said, "What did they do?" They took that
[1:28:49] living water, that rock down from that
[1:28:52] place down in the depths of down way
[1:28:54] down there and they got him a rock of
[1:28:56] testimony.
[1:29:00] Come on, somebody. If you dig down
[1:29:03] enough, you'll get a testimony. You'll
[1:29:06] get something that God has done for you,
[1:29:07] and you'll get changed in your mind and
[1:29:09] your thoughts and everything about you,
[1:29:11] and you'll grab a rock of testimony. He
[1:29:13] said, "What did they do?" He said, "They
[1:29:14] went back and they stopped up those
[1:29:16] whales of their enemy."
[1:29:18] Come on, church of the living God. It's
[1:29:20] time we take our digging and dig and dig
[1:29:23] until we get the channels of God opened
[1:29:24] up enough that his power can rain
[1:29:26] through every life, rain through every
[1:29:28] heart. And you can grab a rock of
[1:29:30] testimony and you can go stop up that
[1:29:32] well of that lying devil. That devil
[1:29:34] that says you're not going to make it.
[1:29:36] Stop it up. That devil has said the
[1:29:38] message ain't for you. Stop it up. That
[1:29:40] me that devil that says you're never
[1:29:42] going to get well. Stop it up.
[1:29:44] Stop up them old for old dog whales and
[1:29:47] fill it with the power of almighty God.
[1:29:57] But whatever you do, get to the rock.
[1:30:00] Get to the place where water can flow
[1:30:02] through your life. Get to the place
[1:30:04] where you can see. Again,
[1:30:07] you see past your complexes. It's a
[1:30:10] problem with a lot of people. They can't
[1:30:11] see past complexes and they can't see
[1:30:14] past things and happened in their life
[1:30:17] and they judge everything by the past.
[1:30:20] Get all get rid of it. dig it up, throw
[1:30:25] it out so God can fill it back up with
[1:30:26] fresh water.
[1:30:28] He can come bring that picture back up
[1:30:30] with that water. He can bring it back up
[1:30:33] and he can open up a channel in your
[1:30:35] life. The next one open up a channel in
[1:30:38] your life to where that clear you can
[1:30:41] see all the way down there. You can see
[1:30:42] the sand down there in that picture. All
[1:30:44] the way up, you can see it. Amen.
[1:30:46] Animals flowing through there. There's a
[1:30:48] one just taken recently of that water
[1:30:50] purifying that bay again and bringing
[1:30:53] new life. This is what God's wanting to
[1:30:56] do to you.
[1:31:00] Brother Brandon would bring it like
[1:31:01] this. He said, he said, you know, he
[1:31:03] said like an old, like I said to a
[1:31:04] person one time, he said, it's like an
[1:31:06] old stopped up pipe. You but you got to
[1:31:09] run a little wire through it and you get
[1:31:11] a hold of a wire and you zig it a little
[1:31:13] bit. You ever done that? get something
[1:31:16] stopped up, maybe a drain or something.
[1:31:18] You start zigging in there, you know,
[1:31:19] jagging it back and forth till you can
[1:31:21] grab a hold of that old hair ball,
[1:31:25] that old hair ball, and pull it out. How
[1:31:28] many's ever done that? I know we got
[1:31:30] some plumbers here's done it. That's
[1:31:32] nasty.
[1:31:35] But that ain't near as nasty as what's
[1:31:36] so in some of our drains.
[1:31:39] Things we've allowed to sit there and
[1:31:41] clog up and and we can't even hardly
[1:31:44] worship God no more. We can't hardly
[1:31:45] praise him no more. We can't even hardly
[1:31:47] live lift our heads no more. Situations
[1:31:50] that we've allowed through the past
[1:31:51] years to haunt us and haunt us and haunt
[1:31:54] us. It's time to grab a wire.
[1:31:57] Start zigging a little bit. Start moving
[1:31:59] back and forth. It's time to start
[1:32:01] lifting your hand up.
[1:32:03] This is what you're doing when you're
[1:32:04] praising God. It ain't just, well, I
[1:32:06] tell you what, I ain't going to lift my
[1:32:07] hand when they say lift my hand. Well,
[1:32:08] you need to need to get past that
[1:32:11] complex. Amen. It ain't all about a man
[1:32:14] telling you what to do. It's about him
[1:32:16] encouraging you to get past yourself and
[1:32:18] lift your hand up anyhow. Whether you
[1:32:21] feel like lifting it up or not, whether
[1:32:22] you want to or not, I'm going to praise
[1:32:24] God. I'm not praising because somebody
[1:32:26] said, "I'm going to praise in spite of
[1:32:28] it all."
[1:32:32] Start zigging a little bit. There's a
[1:32:34] great flow of water trying to get
[1:32:35] through, but you zig and you zig and you
[1:32:37] can't get get through it, but you know
[1:32:39] there's something in there. You can feel
[1:32:41] it. It's something on the other end.
[1:32:43] Then after a while, you get a hold of
[1:32:44] something. You give it a great big pull
[1:32:46] and woo goes the water through the pipe,
[1:32:49] blows out the B blockages and
[1:32:50] everything, cleans it all out. He said,
[1:32:52] "That's the way the Holy Spirit is. Sin
[1:32:55] will stop pipes. Cares of life will stop
[1:32:57] it up." And you'll sit back and say,
[1:32:58] "Well, I'm timid. You know, I can't say
[1:33:00] that. I'm afraid people will think that
[1:33:02] I'm a holy road. I can't do that." But
[1:33:04] you feel that little tugging of the
[1:33:06] spirit. You want more than life. You
[1:33:08] want it more than life. You want it more
[1:33:10] than your own life. It means more to
[1:33:12] you. I got to have it or I'm going to
[1:33:14] die.
[1:33:16] He said, "That's it." You pull that cork
[1:33:18] out and woo, here she come free as it
[1:33:21] can be. He said, "I don't care what
[1:33:22] president sitting here, who's sitting
[1:33:24] here." He'll shout out, "Glory to God."
[1:33:27] And just like Peter on them on the back
[1:33:29] there behind the Pentecost hide and look
[1:33:31] out the door real easy and see if them
[1:33:33] Jews are out there. No one was there,
[1:33:35] but they were scared to death. But all
[1:33:36] of a sudden they got in one mind and one
[1:33:39] accord and they started jigging in the
[1:33:41] right spot
[1:33:43] and up opened a channel and the winds of
[1:33:46] the Holy Ghost filled that place and it
[1:33:48] filled their lives and they walked out
[1:33:50] of there screaming and shouting and
[1:33:52] speaking in tongues.
[1:33:55] He said, "When that cork was pulled and
[1:33:56] the spirit of God be to flow through
[1:33:58] them," he said into Peter, he said, "You
[1:34:00] men of Judea and you that dwell in
[1:34:02] Jerusalem, let it be known unto you and
[1:34:04] hearken to me. This that this be known
[1:34:07] unto you. These are not drunk as you
[1:34:09] suppose, for it's just a third hour
[1:34:11] today." But this is that the prophet
[1:34:13] Joel. This is the channel that was
[1:34:15] promised.
[1:34:17] And that channel is still afforded to us
[1:34:19] today. Amen.
[1:34:24] I will pour out my spirit upon all
[1:34:26] flesh. What difference does it make what
[1:34:29] anybody thinks? It matters what he says.
[1:34:33] I just need to open the channel and let
[1:34:36] him through and let Christ have the
[1:34:38] right away in my life.
[1:34:42] Is that your desire tonight? Do you want
[1:34:44] to bring that picture back up? Do you
[1:34:46] want to be like that first picture? Just
[1:34:49] stagnant, nasty water. I I wish you
[1:34:52] could really see.
[1:34:54] That picture don't even really do it
[1:34:56] justice to what those those areas can
[1:34:59] look like. Just you can't two foot deep
[1:35:02] or less and you can't even see it.
[1:35:04] Stagnant. And right on the other side of
[1:35:06] that barrier, beautiful clear water.
[1:35:10] Right on the other side of that is life.
[1:35:13] right on the other side of that. But
[1:35:16] then all of a sudden things can be
[1:35:18] opened up and it can change and life can
[1:35:22] flow down through the body. That's what
[1:35:25] I want. It's what I desire for this
[1:35:28] church. That's what I know the ministry
[1:35:29] desires of this church. It's not about
[1:35:31] us or who we are. It's about him. And
[1:35:33] it's about his heartbeat pulsating and
[1:35:36] the blood flowing through every fiber of
[1:35:38] every person and every body.
[1:35:41] No, we can't make you drink, but I
[1:35:43] invite you to.
[1:35:45] I invite you to drink from the waters of
[1:35:47] life tonight. You say, "Well, I've had a
[1:35:49] drink." Well, there's more.
[1:35:52] There's more. Let's bow our hearts
[1:35:54] tonight.
[1:35:58] Midnight pass.
[1:36:02] There's been a midnight cry.
[1:36:13] How many sees yourself maybe been
[1:36:15] chasing after the wrong thing?
[1:36:20] I ain't even talking about sinful
[1:36:21] things.
[1:36:25] Hope we're past that. But if it is that,
[1:36:28] repent.
[1:36:30] But just things of life,
[1:36:32] chasing after careers or chasing after
[1:36:36] a mate, chasing after whatever
[1:36:40] little things happen, it dams up.
[1:36:46] Where used to be free,
[1:36:50] free to worship and praise him and
[1:36:52] glorify his name, there's a little
[1:36:54] squeeze that comes in to choke it off.
[1:37:01] begins to pull down and you feel like
[1:37:03] sometimes it's just choking you out.
[1:37:07] That's what it's trying to do.
[1:37:11] Like when them pythons gets around a a
[1:37:14] life and it just starts squeezing. Take
[1:37:17] a breath, it squeezes harder. Take a
[1:37:19] breath, they squeeze hard till it
[1:37:20] squeezes the very life out.
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:32] But there's a power here to clean out
[1:37:35] the channels,
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:40] to clean out that spot.
[1:37:45] Brother Timothy, I just want to tonight
[1:37:48] I just want to renew my love with to the
[1:37:50] Lord. I just want to start there. here.
[1:37:53] I I want to just say, Lord, I
[1:37:56] I want to just open up that channel
[1:37:58] again.
[1:38:00] That place, Lord, where I used to have
[1:38:02] that real love affair with you and
[1:38:05] commune with you and talk with you.
[1:38:08] That time when you first put your arms
[1:38:10] around me and I found out I'm not a
[1:38:12] sinner. I'm a son or I'm a daughter of
[1:38:14] God. But Satan's come and he's tried to
[1:38:17] choke out that joy.
[1:38:20] I just need a renewing in my life.
[1:38:23] I need a renewing in my spirit.
[1:38:27] I need a renewing.
[1:38:31] He's here to do that for you.
[1:38:35] He's here to open up the channels, but
[1:38:37] you're going to have to zigg a little
[1:38:39] bit.
[1:38:41] But to zigg,
[1:38:46] you know what the blockage is. You know
[1:38:47] what
[1:38:49] causes it. What? What is Maybe it's
[1:38:51] self-reliance. Maybe you've been relying
[1:38:53] on yourself so much and
[1:38:55] well, I'll figure it out. I
[1:38:59] maybe it's something that's been passed
[1:39:01] down through generations and just that
[1:39:04] thing that wants to sit on your life and
[1:39:06] control you and rises up and it just
[1:39:10] chokes you again and pulls you down
[1:39:12] again.
[1:39:14] God wants to open a channel tonight in
[1:39:16] your heart.
[1:39:18] lift you back up. Let those waters flow
[1:39:21] through where the life and the joy of
[1:39:24] God can come down and move in that place
[1:39:27] again and waves, ripples, and
[1:39:34] fresh sand and
[1:39:36] fresh anointing and fresh spirit of God
[1:39:39] pouring down in your life. That's what
[1:39:42] he wants to do.
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:39:47] Well, I may just be be honest between
[1:39:51] you and God. Not to me, but to God. And
[1:39:53] just, Lord, I need to open up some
[1:39:55] channels. I I need to open them up
[1:39:58] tonight. I help me, Lord.
[1:40:02] Help me.
[1:40:06] Grant it, Father.
[1:40:08] Lord Jesus.
[1:40:12] Maybe not exactly the way I thought
[1:40:14] things would go tonight, but Lord, it's
[1:40:16] not how I think or how I want or desire.
[1:40:18] It's what you want.
[1:40:23] Lord Jesus, I just ask Father that Lord
[1:40:26] if there be any backbiting among us,
[1:40:31] gossip among us, hurtful things among
[1:40:34] us, Lord, that those things would be
[1:40:36] made right and channels be opened up,
[1:40:40] clogs come out,
[1:40:43] Lord, if there be hurts,
[1:40:45] they can be resolved tonight by the
[1:40:47] presence of Almighty God.
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:54] Lord that they can be just maybe Lord
[1:40:56] I'm sorry go up or Father sorry to
[1:41:00] apologize to the person that been hurt
[1:41:02] or whatever Lord but God may we just
[1:41:05] open up those channels that that fresh
[1:41:07] water of your spirit can move through
[1:41:09] again.
[1:41:12] God grant it. I pray.
[1:41:16] Sometimes Satan gets us to thinking,
[1:41:18] Lord, that we're just
[1:41:21] we're not in the right place. We're not
[1:41:23] in the right spot. We're not But Lord,
[1:41:25] you planted us by the fountains of
[1:41:28] living waters.
[1:41:32] Lord, you planted us, Lord, that we can
[1:41:34] grow and bloom and blossom.
[1:41:37] You planted us, Lord, where we could
[1:41:39] seek first ye first the kingdom of God
[1:41:41] and all these other things to be added
[1:41:43] to us, Lord.
[1:41:46] Oh God, may we see, Lord, there's
[1:41:48] potential laying there. If we just drink
[1:41:50] in the presence of God and drink in your
[1:41:53] word and drink in, Lord, what you have
[1:41:56] for us, every promise of God for this
[1:41:58] time, and this hour,
[1:42:00] bless the hands that were lifted all
[1:42:02] over this building, honest hearts, Lord.
[1:42:05] Lord, my hand lifted as well. Lord, see
[1:42:08] channels in my life I need to open up.
[1:42:11] I've allowed other things to clog them
[1:42:13] up and I've allowed it to sit there and
[1:42:16] Lord, I don't want no stagnant waters,
[1:42:19] but Lord, I want the freshness of your
[1:42:21] spirit, Lord, moving,
[1:42:24] the freshness of your anointing moving,
[1:42:26] Lord, and my life, Father, my home, my
[1:42:30] family.
[1:42:32] Grant it, Lord. I pray.
[1:42:35] May you just move now in every heart.
[1:42:37] May they just begin to zigg
[1:42:40] Lord. Whatever they do, may they not
[1:42:41] leave another moment, Lord, with that
[1:42:43] clog there and damn up the presence of
[1:42:46] God in their life.
[1:42:49] Allow that hurt to sit there and be pre
[1:42:52] take prereeminence over you, Lord, in
[1:42:54] your word.
[1:42:56] Lord, may it be removed tonight by the
[1:42:58] presence of God.
[1:43:01] I pray in Jesus name.
[1:43:07] Amen.
[1:43:11] Amen.
[1:43:14] I need you, Lord.
