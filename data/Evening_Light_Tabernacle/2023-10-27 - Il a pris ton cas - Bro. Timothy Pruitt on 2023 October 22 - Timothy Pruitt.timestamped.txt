[1:22:40] of
[1:22:44] United if you have a
[1:22:51] need
[1:22:54] just give you a personal
[1:22:56] testimony just this
[1:22:58] year I was in a real real crunch
[1:23:05] financially I'll back up a few
[1:23:08] years I you know I I started
[1:23:12] ministering around year
[1:23:15] 2000 and uh honestly I didn't want to be
[1:23:18] a
[1:23:20] preacher I actually fought against it
[1:23:24] my poor wife had to deal with it for a
[1:23:28] while didn't want to read the
[1:23:31] Bible because I read the Bible then I
[1:23:33] saw
[1:23:38] something close it put it
[1:23:41] back my dad you know he would he
[1:23:44] wouldn't never let anybody ask me if I
[1:23:45] would be a
[1:23:49] preacher he said don't ask him that
[1:23:53] he said because it ain't man that makes
[1:23:55] a
[1:24:00] preacher he said because of man
[1:24:03] call then man has to take care of
[1:24:06] it but he said if God
[1:24:09] call God take
[1:24:11] care amen and so you know a few years
[1:24:16] ago I was looking to maybe get into some
[1:24:21] business try to make some extra
[1:24:25] money because beyond what some people
[1:24:30] think you don't get rich being a
[1:24:34] preacher amen so I I I was looking to do
[1:24:40] that and so I had these
[1:24:43] plans went to brother Ron Spencer for a
[1:24:47] meeting ate lunch with him one
[1:24:51] day night I would come

[1:25:07] shoulder say it's going to be a
[1:25:09] wonderful
[1:25:10] weekend especially for
[1:25:13] you I like wow wow yeah so I preach that
[1:25:19] night the next day we would go up on the
[1:25:21] mountain

[1:25:27] word about this thought of being in
[1:25:29] business with
