[39:52] shall prosper and you may be seated this
[39:55] evening i like i said sunday i'm just a
[39:57] simple preacher so i have a a simple
[39:59] subject tonight my subject would be the
[40:02] contrast
[40:03] and i just want to start off by saying
[40:05] that i believe every son and daughter of
[40:07] god is born with a purpose you're not
[40:10] here just by accident you're not here
[40:12] just for just for any reason but you're
[40:15] here for a purpose and god has a purpose
[40:17] for your life that nobody else can
[40:19] fulfill brother branham would say we are
[40:21] made for a purpose this church was built
[40:23] for a purpose the foundation was not dug
[40:26] the cornerstone laid the blocks laid in
[40:28] the building the roof and the interior
[40:30] was not put here just to see if it could
[40:32] be done but it was pit here for a
[40:34] purpose for by a purpose for a purpose
[40:37] your home that you live in was not just
[40:39] accidentally put there or somebody just
[40:41] wasting time your home was made for a
[40:44] purpose to serve a purpose and i started
[40:47] to think about it this building was
[40:49] prettier for a purpose how much more are
[40:51] you and i put here for a purpose the
[40:53] devil would like to come in and tell
[40:55] young people tell adults to say you know
[40:58] you're here by accident mom and dad
[40:59] didn't really they don't love you this
[41:01] one don't love you you're here you've
[41:03] got no purpose on the earth but i'm here
[41:05] to tell you that you want to be here
[41:07] unless you have a purpose brother
[41:08] branham goes on to say that the car we
[41:10] drive was made for a purpose it wasn't
[41:13] just made to see if it could be done but
[41:15] it was made for a purpose the materials
[41:17] wasn't made by man our mother wasn't
[41:19] made by men just to see if it could be
[41:21] done but it was made for a purpose and
[41:23] he says we're not here just to eat food
[41:26] that god has grown we're not here just
[41:28] to drive cars that man has made i live
[41:31] in a house that man has made but he says
[41:33] we're here
[41:34] for a specific purpose and nobody else
[41:37] can fulfill the purpose that god has
[41:39] placed on each one of our lives brother
[41:42] branham says that nature has a purpose
[41:44] nature is just expressing what god is
[41:47] doing in the believer's life he says
[41:49] does that the tree dies the plant dies
[41:51] he says as easter comes around they come
[41:54] back again that's expressing what god is
[41:57] doing in the believer's heart when we
[41:59] pass away we're going to rise up again
[42:01] that is just it's just a type of us so
[42:04] if that has a purpose for them just
[42:06] being a type of us how much more do we
[42:09] have a purpose being here on earth
[42:12] brother branham would say no matter how
[42:14] little you are how big you are how
[42:15] important you are how unimportant you
[42:18] are you are here to serve a purpose just
[42:20] as my finger is here for a purpose my
[42:23] nail or my finger is for a purpose my
[42:25] eye every part of our body is to serve a
[42:28] purpose it was not just put here to see
[42:30] what it would look like but it was put
[42:32] here to serve its purpose it was god's
[42:35] divine plan to do so and i like how he
[42:38] puts that no matter how big you are how
[42:40] little you are how important you are how
[42:43] unimportant you are so it don't matter
[42:45] if you feel the lowest of the lowest
[42:46] you've got a purpose or if you feel like
[42:48] you're the greatest of the greatest
[42:50] you've got a purpose and just bear with
[42:52] me as i lay a little foundation here but
[42:54] nothing happens by accident brother
[42:56] branham would say you were all
[42:58] pre-planned by god nothing happens by
[43:00] chance with god he knows all about it
[43:02] it's all pre-play and planned from many
[43:05] generations back so that you can be here
[43:08] tonight did you know that my that
[43:10] distract me he says god has been working
[43:13] for or for for your life for your
[43:15] purpose for your nature for many
[43:18] generations back so nothing happens by
[43:21] accident you may say well my mom and
[43:23] daddy got divorced or or this happened
[43:25] and that happened it all happened for a
[43:27] purpose so that you can be here you know
[43:29] brother branham would say that he his
[43:32] mama and dad was put together for a
[43:34] purpose his grandparents were put
[43:36] together so that he would have the
[43:38] nature that he would have and i don't
[43:40] believe that's just for the prophet but
[43:42] god has been working on your purpose on
[43:45] your nature for many generations back
[43:48] and let me say this the devil cannot
[43:50] does not have enough power enough
[43:53] ability to destroy the purpose that god
[43:56] has on your life you know brother
[43:58] branham would say that god knew your
[44:00] hair color he would knew the stature
[44:02] that you would have he knew the makeup
[44:04] he knew if you would have freckles he
[44:06] knew if you would have red hair god
[44:07] knows everything about us and then we
[44:10] limit god to our circumstances we limit
[44:13] god to what we go through we limit god
[44:16] to our trials but let me say this
[44:18] evening if we take the limits of god
[44:20] just watch what god will do in our lives
[44:23] the trial ain't too big for god the
[44:25] circumstance ain't too big for god the
[44:27] lies that the devil is telling you ain't
[44:29] too big for god but take the limits off
[44:32] of god and know that no matter what you
[44:35] go through god knew you would be going
[44:38] through it brother branham would say god
[44:40] knows the end from the beginning
[44:42] therefore he could plan everything that
[44:43] would work out for his glory that gives
[44:46] us courage to know no matter what comes
[44:49] or what goes god is making everything
[44:52] the time is or the clunk is ticking just
[44:54] exactly on time but then he says
[44:56] sometimes we get weary upset we get
[44:58] hastily we think oh we must do that or
[45:01] we must do this but remember god's clock
[45:04] will be just exactly on time therefore
[45:07] he can make everything work according to
[45:10] his big time clock that is ticking away
[45:12] he could foretell the yen from the
[45:14] beginning therefore he know we will live
[45:16] in this day he knew this would be our
[45:18] day and he's got plans for this day he's
[45:21] got planned plans for every day and
[45:23] nothing ever has one of his plans ever
[45:26] failed he's always on time oh that place
[45:29] is the courage of my heart if i'm in the
[45:31] valley of the shadow of death that don't
[45:34] destroy the purpose if i'm in the lion's
[45:36] den that don't destroy the purpose if
[45:38] i'm in a fiery furnace that don't
[45:40] destroy the purpose and when we're on
[45:42] the mountaintop that doesn't mean we've
[45:45] got a greater purpose our purpose never
[45:48] changes no matter how high we are how
[45:50] low we are the purpose of god never
[45:53] changes and we go we don't go a day
[45:55] without him knowing about it
[45:58] isaiah 46 and 9 remember the former
[46:00] things of ode for i am god and there was
[46:03] none else i am god and there was none
[46:05] like me declaring the end from the
[46:08] beginning from ancient times to things
[46:10] that are not yet done saying my counsel
[46:13] shall stand and i will do all my
[46:15] pleasure like i said we put limits on
[46:17] god he knows the end from the beginning
[46:20] he knew you'd be sitting in this
[46:22] building you know why he knew you'd be
[46:24] sitting in this building because he
[46:26] knows the end from the beginning so the
[46:28] devil thinks that he can pull one on god
[46:31] and put you through trials and put you
[46:32] through circumstances but god knew
[46:35] exactly what the devil would put you
[46:37] through he didn't just know it but he
[46:39] allowed the devil to put you through
[46:41] hard times
[46:43] he allows he thinks the devil thinks
[46:45] he's bigger than what he really is and
[46:47] we think the devil is bigger than what
[46:49] he really is but he can't do nothing to
[46:52] your life unless he asks god
[46:54] permission oh my and if he asks god's
[46:57] permission then he knows you've got the
[47:00] strength to make you through it
[47:02] oh come on somebody he knows you've got
[47:04] enough strength to make it through it or
[47:06] what's the bible say you don't put more
[47:08] on us than what we can bear
[47:10] you may see brother josh you don't know
[47:11] where i'm at this morning i don't but i
[47:14] know the same god that was with the
[47:16] three hebrew boys he's in the fiery
[47:18] furnace with you
[47:20] take the limits off god receive them
[47:22] take the limits of god in your life and
[47:25] watch what god would do
[47:27] oh my the bible says in isaiah 58 or 55
[47:31] and 8 for i know that
[47:33] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[47:35] neither my ways your ways saith the lord
[47:39] and oh my that place is the courage in
[47:41] my heart because sometimes i wake up and
[47:43] i don't feel like a son of god i wake up
[47:46] i don't feel like i'm going to make a
[47:47] rapture i wake up and i feel like i'm
[47:50] backslidden though my thoughts change
[47:52] concerning me god's thoughts never
[47:55] change concerning me
[47:57] oh my the thoughts of god are eternal so
[48:00] if god's thoughts towards you is eternal
[48:03] that means no matter what comes against
[48:05] you your purpose will never be destroyed
[48:09] the next verse for as the heavens are
[48:11] higher than the earth so are my ways
[48:13] higher than your ways my thoughts higher
[48:16] than your thoughts so that means i might
[48:19] not understand everything but i know one
[48:21] thing his ways are higher than my ways
[48:24] and his thoughts are higher than my
[48:27] parts but i like my opening scripture
[48:30] behold i have created the the one that
[48:32] bringeth forth the instrument but i've
[48:34] also created the waster to destroy so
[48:37] he's talking about the contrast but then
[48:40] he stops and he says no weapon that is
[48:43] formed against you is going to prosper
[48:46] you know i never put two and two
[48:48] together i've read about the contrast
[48:50] and i read about that next scripture but
[48:53] that just stood out to me he's given the
[48:55] devil permission to destroy the world
[48:58] he's given the devil permission to
[49:00] destroy this life to destroy that life
[49:02] but once it comes to my instruments no
[49:05] weapon that you're gonna form against my
[49:08] instrument ain't gonna prosper i don't
[49:11] care what you put them through i've got
[49:13] a purpose in their life
[49:15] and i'm going to give you some things
[49:17] i'm going to i'm going to let you touch
[49:18] job's life you can take his family away
[49:21] you can take his livelihood stalk away
[49:23] you can you can i'm going to give you
[49:25] permission to touch his body but once it
[49:28] comes to his purpose
[49:31] when it comes to his life you cannot
[49:33] touch his life
[49:35] oh even his wife turned against job this
[49:38] greatest companion turned against him
[49:40] but god says that's as far as you're
[49:42] going to go you can't touch his purpose
[49:45] your friends may have turned against you
[49:47] your family members may have turned
[49:49] against you your parents may have turned
[49:51] against you your wife may have turned
[49:53] against you your husband may have turned
[49:55] against you but he cannot touch the
[49:58] purpose that is on your life
[50:01] come on somebody get a courage about
[50:03] yourself and say devil no weapon that's
[50:06] your formula this my life is going to
[50:09] prosper because i've got a purpose
[50:13] i'm not here by accident i'm here to
[50:16] destroy the gates of hell i'm here to
[50:19] bring down every stronghold i'm here to
[50:22] bring down the enemy
[50:23] and devil i don't care what you put me
[50:26] through it's not touching my purpose
[50:29] hallelujah that's a revelation that we
[50:32] can grab a hold of and say devil back up
[50:35] oh you remember the story but i brought
[50:37] the brand we had a vision i believe and
[50:38] there was a little devil
[50:40] that come up to him and he would say boo
[50:42] and brother branham jumped back and the
[50:44] devil got bigger
[50:46] and he says it again boo brother branham
[50:48] jumped back and that devil got bigger
[50:50] and kept getting bigger and bigger and
[50:52] all of a sudden brother branham
[50:54] came to himself and something struck and
[50:57] he stopped and he says boo back to the
[51:00] devil the devil got bigger got smaller
[51:02] and brother branham got bigger
[51:05] he realized that no weapon that was
[51:08] formed against him was going to prosper
[51:11] and this evening no weapon
[51:13] get some courage about yourself in the
[51:16] midst of the contrast in the midst of
[51:18] the hard times don't back up against the
[51:20] devil turn to the devil and say boo i've
[51:23] got a purpose boo i'm predestinated boo
[51:27] i'm elected now watch that devil have to
[51:29] go back to hell where he belongs
[51:33] the devil don't belong in your mind that
[51:35] devil don't belong in your thoughts that
[51:37] devil don't belong in your body that
[51:40] devil belongs in hell
[51:42] and let me say you've got the power to
[51:44] send that devil back to where he belongs
[51:47] you don't get to listen to that lie any
[51:49] longer
[51:51] come on somebody you don't gotta listen
[51:53] to those spots any longer
[51:55] for greater is he that is in you than he
[51:59] that is in the world
[52:01] oh glory to god
[52:03] you see both are taking place
[52:05] god is building up the devil is
[52:07] destroying
[52:08] but i don't matter how strong the waster
[52:11] is
[52:11] he can't destroy the purpose on your
[52:14] life and this is a scripture that we've
[52:16] all memorized but too many times we read
[52:19] scripture time and time and time again
[52:22] and we fail to see the true meaning
[52:24] behind scripture romans 8 29 says for
[52:27] whom he did for no he also did
[52:30] predestinate so he's saying here you're
[52:32] not here by accident you've got a
[52:34] purpose you mean therefore no he also
[52:37] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[52:40] image of the son that he might be the
[52:42] firstborn among many brothers moreover
[52:45] whom he did predestinate then me also
[52:48] called whom he called then he also
[52:50] justified whom he justified he also
[52:53] glorified so he sees he's making a
[52:56] statement here he's making this clear
[52:58] you've got a purpose you're not here by
[53:01] accident then he says what shall we say
[53:03] to these things if god before us if
[53:06] we've got a purpose if you're elected if
[53:09] you're predestinated if you're chosen
[53:12] for this moment what waster
[53:15] can be against you and i say this even
[53:18] if god before you if you've got a
[53:20] purpose i don't care what the waster is
[53:22] sending your way
[53:24] nothing could destroy the purpose oh my
[53:28] the 35th verse who shall separate us
[53:31] from the love of god
[53:33] oh my nothing's going to separate me
[53:35] from the love of god or tribulation or
[53:38] distress persecution famine necklace
[53:41] pearl sword as it is written for thy
[53:43] sake we are killed all the day long we
[53:45] are counted as sheep for the slaughter
[53:48] nay and all of these things in the midst
[53:50] of the contrast
[53:51] in the midst of the waster and they and
[53:54] all of these things we are more than
[53:56] conquerors through him that loved us
[53:59] for i am persuaded we need to get some
[54:01] people that's persuaded
[54:03] not just guessing not just not not just
[54:06] thinking about it but persuading i'm
[54:09] persuaded that neither death nor life
[54:12] nor angel principalities powers nor
[54:14] things present
[54:16] uh the circumstance i'm in or the
[54:18] circumstance that i'm going to go in
[54:20] will never be able to destroy the
[54:23] purpose that god has in my life
[54:26] oh my well more than conquerors brother
[54:28] branham would say now we want to draw
[54:30] this first into our minds that there is
[54:33] not one thing that can destroy us until
[54:36] the purpose of he who created us
[54:40] he who created us has been fulfilled but
[54:43] that would then create you
[54:46] come on somebody the waster didn't
[54:49] create you
[54:50] they the god created you and that means
[54:53] no matter what you go through it can
[54:55] never destroy the purpose you may see
[54:57] what about those ones that are die that
[54:59] is with the way of the grave their
[55:01] purpose was fulfilled
[55:04] oh my oh grave where was your sting
[55:07] death where was your victory this was
[55:09] somebody their purpose on earth was
[55:11] fulfilled but now they've got a greater
[55:13] purpose
[55:14] they've got a greater purpose so death
[55:16] thinks he pulls one on god but god says
[55:18] oh no their purpose on earth is
[55:20] fulfilled now i'm calling them up to a
[55:23] higher purpose
[55:24] oh hallelujah you see the contrast ain't
[55:28] meant to destroy the purpose it's meant
[55:30] to magnify the purpose you know in our
[55:33] laundry room loretta painted three of
[55:35] the walls white and one of the wall is a
[55:37] dark blue and what that does it creates
[55:40] a contrast and that dark wall pops
[55:44] but in this case there's more darkness
[55:47] than there is light
[55:48] there's sin there's perversions there's
[55:51] this and there's that but all that is
[55:52] doing is making the bride of christ pop
[55:56] in the midst of the contrast in the
[55:58] midst of the perversion there's a
[56:00] privacy not going down she's going up
[56:03] there's a bride that's not being
[56:04] defeated but she's overcoming
[56:07] oh my so what the devil is doing he
[56:10] don't realize that i'm gonna pull a
[56:11] timothy prince dumbo devil
[56:13] he thinks he's destroying the purpose
[56:16] but all he is doing is magnifying the
[56:19] purpose so every trial you go through
[56:21] says thank you devil you're just
[56:23] magnifying my purpose on earth
[56:26] thank you waster you're just magnifying
[56:29] what god has called me to do
[56:31] how could you fight devils if no devils
[56:34] come against you
[56:35] how could you overcome sicknesses if you
[56:38] was never sick
[56:39] how could you die how could you break
[56:41] the shackles if you was never bound but
[56:43] it takes the contrast to reveal greater
[56:47] is he that is in you
[56:49] don't curse god in the hard times don't
[56:51] curse god in the trial don't curse god
[56:54] but look to god and say thank you for
[56:57] having confidence in me
[57:00] oh it was god i told the devil asked him
[57:02] what are you up to
[57:04] oh just roaming to and fro
[57:07] seeking one i may desire seeking who i'm
[57:09] going to destroy then god says you know
[57:11] what
[57:12] i'm going to allow a contrast
[57:15] there's somebody on earth that has a
[57:18] purpose and i want to show the devil his
[57:21] true purpose
[57:22] come on now i want to show the devil his
[57:25] true purpose so we asked him have you
[57:28] considered my servant job
[57:30] have you ever have you considered him he
[57:32] goes oh yeah but you've got a hedge
[57:34] around me he goes you know what fine
[57:36] fine
[57:37] i'm gonna make you a deal i'm going to
[57:39] take the hedge off of him
[57:41] i'm going to take the hedge off of him
[57:43] you try to destroy him he goes oh yeah
[57:45] you just watch i'm going to make him
[57:47] curse him curse you to your face and god
[57:50] says oh no
[57:51] in the back of his mind he knew the
[57:53] purpose was greater than the waster
[57:57] god knows you're not going to curse god
[58:00] this let me turn away that one may turn
[58:02] away this one may blaspheme but god
[58:04] knows there's something inside of you
[58:06] that can't turn away from the message
[58:08] can't turn away from his grace can't
[58:10] turn away from his love and the only
[58:13] thing that the devil is doing is showing
[58:15] that the purpose can never be destroyed
[58:18] but you notice you notice what job said
[58:20] after the trial the lord giveth and the
[58:23] lord taketh away blessed be thy holy
[58:27] name the contrast never took his praise
[58:30] away
[58:31] the contrast never took his worship away
[58:36] he lost his lively stock
[58:38] he lost his he lost his children he lost
[58:40] his wife and we stubbed our toe when we
[58:42] lose our worship
[58:44] i'm preaching now we stubbed our toe
[58:47] where we our co-worker gets an attitude
[58:49] and we lose our worship we need to grow
[58:52] up
[58:53] and realize our purpose ain't to be
[58:55] defeated our person our purpose is to
[58:59] rise above every circumstance rise above
[59:01] every child rise above everything we go
[59:04] through and give god the glory in the
[59:07] midst of it all the lord giveth and the
[59:09] lord taketh away but waster you're not
[59:12] taking my praise
[59:15] come on somebody you're not taking my
[59:18] praise you're not taking my worship
[59:20] it may be the midnight hour i may be in
[59:22] a jail cell but i'm still going to
[59:24] praise god
[59:27] then what did he say
[59:28] i have heard of god by the hearing of
[59:31] the year but now my eye seethy
[59:34] so it took the contrast
[59:37] to get job from just hearing about god
[59:40] now to seeing god
[59:42] it took the hard times for job to
[59:45] realize this ain't just the god of moses
[59:48] it ain't the god of elijah it ain't the
[59:51] god of abraham but this is the god of
[59:54] job but how did he realize that because
[59:57] of the contrast
[59:59] oh
[1:00:00] my
[1:00:01] how like i said earlier how would you
[1:00:02] know god could heal if he was never sick
[1:00:06] but it takes the contrast to magnify the
[1:00:09] beauty of the power of god
[1:00:11] there's been many times when he was
[1:00:13] first married there was times we didn't
[1:00:15] have money for our bills
[1:00:16] and we called to be called the bank to
[1:00:18] see if we could push our loan back a few
[1:00:20] weeks and to get us some so we can get
[1:00:22] some more money and uh and we call the
[1:00:25] bank and the bank says what do you mean
[1:00:26] the loan's paid for for the month
[1:00:29] oh my what we didn't pay it
[1:00:31] we didn't have the money for it but that
[1:00:34] took the contrast the show no matter
[1:00:37] what we go through
[1:00:38] everything is in his control
[1:00:40] another time we knew we had a certain
[1:00:42] amount in the bank we called the bank to
[1:00:44] make sure it was doubled it was the
[1:00:46] contrast that revealed to us that no
[1:00:50] matter what we go through
[1:00:52] what we go through god is always in the
[1:00:54] midst of the contrast
[1:00:57] but how could i tell those testimonies
[1:00:59] if we didn't go through it
[1:01:00] at the time we thought those were going
[1:01:02] to destroy us
[1:01:03] we didn't know how was going to make it
[1:01:05] through it but you notice what the
[1:01:06] contrast did it drove us to our knees
[1:01:10] hey
[1:01:12] it takes the circumstances to get us on
[1:01:14] our knees too many times
[1:01:17] it's the truth anyhow but it was this
[1:01:20] contrast that caused us to get to our
[1:01:22] knees and say god i don't know what
[1:01:24] we're going to do i got laid off from my
[1:01:25] job it was the winter time so i couldn't
[1:01:27] go i do landscape in the summer times so
[1:01:30] i couldn't go and do landscape i felt
[1:01:32] helpless as a man it's not always
[1:01:35] there's not a worse feeling than knowing
[1:01:37] you can't provide for your family
[1:01:39] but they took that to get me to the
[1:01:41] lowest of the lowest where i couldn't
[1:01:43] look down anymore the only way i can
[1:01:45] lower the only direction i can look was
[1:01:48] up
[1:01:48] it took the contrast to get me to look
[1:01:51] up
[1:01:52] don't curse god in the hard times he's
[1:01:54] wanting to reveal himself to you in a
[1:01:57] greater way
[1:01:59] you know brother branham says that
[1:02:00] before the world was created
[1:02:02] the god inside of god was attributes
[1:02:05] attributes to be a healer a deliverer a
[1:02:07] savior a father but he was god alone he
[1:02:10] was
[1:02:12] elohim i believe and since he was god
[1:02:14] alone there was nobody to reveal those
[1:02:17] attributes to
[1:02:18] and so what happened when god allowed
[1:02:21] the devil to come into the garden and
[1:02:23] cause the contrast
[1:02:25] and now that they're sin their sickness
[1:02:28] because there's sin there's bondage
[1:02:31] because there's sin there's this and
[1:02:33] there's that now god
[1:02:35] can show himself as a deliverer
[1:02:37] he can reveal himself as a healer so god
[1:02:40] allowed the devil to come in the garden
[1:02:42] so that he can reveal himself
[1:02:45] the devil can't do nothing without god
[1:02:47] knowing about it
[1:02:48] oh my and so now that the devil caused
[1:02:52] eve to fall there's man that's going to
[1:02:54] hell so now god said yes i can reveal
[1:02:57] myself as a redeemer
[1:02:59] there's man with the with the fallen
[1:03:01] nature now i can show myself as a savior
[1:03:04] but it took the contrast oh this is okay
[1:03:07] this evening it took the contrast for
[1:03:10] god to reveal himself you look at romans
[1:03:12] 9 and 17 for the scripture saith unto
[1:03:14] pharaoh even for this same purpose have
[1:03:17] i raised thee up that i might show my
[1:03:19] power in thee
[1:03:22] inside of pharaoh
[1:03:23] how's this even possible god was
[1:03:26] allowing pharaoh
[1:03:28] to harden his heart so that god can
[1:03:31] reveal himself through the children of
[1:03:33] israel that i might show my power in
[1:03:35] thee that my name might be declared
[1:03:37] throughout all of the earth
[1:03:40] you notice you notice when the spies got
[1:03:42] in the jericho what did we have the
[1:03:44] harlot say
[1:03:46] we have heard what y'all did to the
[1:03:48] egyptians and the men's hearts have
[1:03:51] become fainted
[1:03:53] how did that take place because of the
[1:03:55] contrast
[1:03:58] how come the devil's afraid of this
[1:04:00] pride because of the contrast
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:03] hey it's the truth anyhow how come he
[1:04:06] knows that no weapon formed against you
[1:04:08] is going to prosper because of the
[1:04:10] contrast but at the same time this is
[1:04:13] going on exodus 9 and 12 and the lord
[1:04:16] heart in the heart of pharaoh and he
[1:04:18] hearken not unto them as the lord hath
[1:04:20] spoken to moses and the lord said unto
[1:04:23] moses so as his heart was being hardened
[1:04:26] he didn't leave moses by himself
[1:04:30] oh my your circumstances may be getting
[1:04:32] hard but god hasn't left you by yourself
[1:04:35] he's still there the lord said unto
[1:04:37] moses rise up early in the morning stand
[1:04:40] before pharaoh and say unto him thus
[1:04:42] saith the lord god of the hebrews let my
[1:04:45] people go that they may serve me
[1:04:49] so at the same time pharaoh was saying
[1:04:51] no god was given moses a visitation
[1:04:56] god can still visit you in the hard
[1:04:57] times
[1:04:59] dawkins still speak to you in the fiery
[1:05:01] furnace
[1:05:02] oh my god you know you notice
[1:05:05] oh this is okay
[1:05:06] nebuchadnezzar looked down
[1:05:08] and i believe it was nebuchadnezzar i
[1:05:10] hope i got the right person look down in
[1:05:12] the fiery furnace it says i thought we
[1:05:14] threw three in there
[1:05:16] how come there's a fourth one in there
[1:05:18] that looks like the son of god even the
[1:05:20] waster knows there's a god on earth
[1:05:24] because of the contrast
[1:05:26] i know it's simple but it's good
[1:05:28] preaching
[1:05:29] it was because of the contrast that the
[1:05:32] waster knew
[1:05:34] that he couldn't destroy the purpose
[1:05:36] but you think the devil will learn that
[1:05:38] he can't destroy the purpose
[1:05:41] oh my you notice the definition of
[1:05:44] waster this just stood out to me to
[1:05:46] destroy to corrupt to ruin to decay to
[1:05:49] pervert
[1:05:50] that definition stood out to me waster
[1:05:52] is too perverted brother branham says
[1:05:55] that the devil can't create he can only
[1:05:57] pervert so he takes what god has created
[1:06:00] and perverts it for his own gain brother
[1:06:03] branham says satan's only power he's god
[1:06:06] is the perverted power of god it isn't a
[1:06:09] real power
[1:06:10] oh my it isn't a real power it's a
[1:06:13] perversion of god's power everything
[1:06:16] that satan has death is only a perverted
[1:06:19] life a lie is only the truth mistoad
[1:06:22] adultery is an act misused a righteous
[1:06:25] act misused see everything that satan
[1:06:28] has god is something that is perverted
[1:06:30] but it's a power and here we are today
[1:06:33] sitting here one or the other power is
[1:06:35] going to control us so let us cast out
[1:06:38] the evil one let's take our position
[1:06:41] like the stars of the heavens
[1:06:43] oh my so the power that the devil's got
[1:06:46] is only a perversion
[1:06:48] so that means it don't got the authority
[1:06:51] that the original is god
[1:06:53] so why would we want to come under the
[1:06:56] power of a knockoff when we can come
[1:06:58] under the authority of the genuine
[1:07:01] like i said sunday there's there there's
[1:07:03] many counterfeits out there but there's
[1:07:05] no counterfeit 44 bill
[1:07:07] because there's not a genuine out there
[1:07:09] but you notice the five counterfeit five
[1:07:11] dollar bill don't got the purchasing
[1:07:14] power that a real five dollar bill's got
[1:07:17] so the devil may thinks he's got you
[1:07:20] but he's got no power to hold you
[1:07:23] until you realize that he's a fake
[1:07:27] the only way you can realize the only
[1:07:30] way that you come to a realization that
[1:07:32] you're that you've got a counterfeit is
[1:07:34] to match the two together
[1:07:36] then you realize i've got a counterfeit
[1:07:38] i've got no power
[1:07:39] then you got to get the genuine because
[1:07:42] the one you've got that's no power
[1:07:45] and that's the way it is with the
[1:07:46] perverted power of the devil you've got
[1:07:48] to realize this is a perversion there's
[1:07:51] an original out there somewhere that can
[1:07:54] pull me out of this trial that could
[1:07:56] pull me out of this hard time oh my you
[1:07:59] look at the the disciples was on the on
[1:08:01] the sea fearing for their lives the
[1:08:04] waves were starting to roar and now the
[1:08:06] boats were starting to rock back and
[1:08:08] forth but you notice before the waves or
[1:08:11] before the storm was the water
[1:08:14] before the storm was that was the rain
[1:08:17] before the storm was the wind so the
[1:08:19] devil took what god had created and
[1:08:22] created the va and took that and
[1:08:24] perverted it
[1:08:25] you see the water wasn't created to
[1:08:27] destroy the boat
[1:08:29] the wind wasn't created to destroy the
[1:08:31] boat the water wasn't created to destroy
[1:08:34] the boat but the perverter took what god
[1:08:37] created the original and perverted it
[1:08:41] but it didn't matter how big thou storm
[1:08:44] was brother branham says there was
[1:08:46] thousands of demons now swore to take
[1:08:49] that boat to the bottom of the ocean
[1:08:51] but they couldn't you know why because
[1:08:54] jesus says let us go to the other side
[1:08:57] he gave a command he gave them a purpose
[1:09:00] we're not going across the ocean by
[1:09:02] accident we're not just going to see
[1:09:04] what's on the other side but i'm giving
[1:09:06] you a purpose let us go to the other
[1:09:09] side
[1:09:11] and what happened as long as the
[1:09:13] disciples was looking up the perversion
[1:09:16] jesus remained
[1:09:18] asleep as long as you're looking at the
[1:09:21] perversion jesus is going to remain
[1:09:23] asleep
[1:09:25] you need to quit looking at the trials
[1:09:28] quit looking out the circumstances quit
[1:09:31] looking at the perverter and wake up the
[1:09:33] creator
[1:09:34] [Applause]
[1:09:36] what happened they woke up jesus it says
[1:09:38] do you care that we perish he got up and
[1:09:40] he says where's your faith
[1:09:42] don't you know who i am
[1:09:44] but since they didn't know who he really
[1:09:46] was they were focused on the perverter
[1:09:49] too many people lack an experience with
[1:09:52] god
[1:09:53] so every trial they go through their
[1:09:55] backslide
[1:09:57] every circumstance they go through their
[1:09:59] backside that curse god but you'll get
[1:10:01] an experience
[1:10:02] not of a perverted power but of the
[1:10:05] original power it anchors something on
[1:10:07] the inside that god's never going to
[1:10:10] leave me he's never going to forsake me
[1:10:12] but he's going to be with me to the end
[1:10:14] of the world what happened jesus got up
[1:10:17] and he says peace be still and what
[1:10:19] happened
[1:10:20] the perversion went back to its original
[1:10:22] state
[1:10:24] the water went back to the way it was
[1:10:26] before the perversion
[1:10:28] oh i hope you're catching it this
[1:10:30] evening the creators in the building
[1:10:33] look away from the perversion and let
[1:10:35] the original creator take the perversion
[1:10:38] and restore it back to the original
[1:10:41] the trial ain't meant to destroy you the
[1:10:43] circumstances meant to destroy you but
[1:10:46] let the creator take the contrast what
[1:10:48] do the disciples say what manner about
[1:10:50] man is this that the winds and the waves
[1:10:53] obey him
[1:10:54] it was the contrast that revealed to
[1:10:57] them that he was god
[1:11:00] it took the hard times to reveal to them
[1:11:03] that he was god
[1:11:05] oh my but you notice what was on the
[1:11:07] other side of that storm on the other
[1:11:09] side of that storm was the man that
[1:11:11] needed to get in front of jesus
[1:11:14] what if they wouldn't have pressed
[1:11:15] through that storm what if god was like
[1:11:17] us too many times says oh it ain't worth
[1:11:19] it
[1:11:20] i'm not going to go to church
[1:11:23] oh i'm not going to read my bible i'm
[1:11:25] not going to pray
[1:11:26] i'm not going to do this if god had the
[1:11:28] same attitude that we had too many times
[1:11:31] where would we be tonight
[1:11:36] oh this is okay
[1:11:37] but there was a man on the other side of
[1:11:39] the storm that was in a perversion
[1:11:42] that needed to be restored to the
[1:11:44] original
[1:11:45] so that means they had to press many
[1:11:48] times we got to press we got to press
[1:11:50] through the storm we got to press
[1:11:52] through the winds we gotta press through
[1:11:54] the waves so that we can get in front of
[1:11:56] the creator you know brother branham
[1:11:58] says the legion had a wife and some
[1:12:00] children
[1:12:02] so what happened once he got in front of
[1:12:04] god and got in front of christ he was
[1:12:06] set free and brother brandon says he
[1:12:08] went back to his wife and children
[1:12:11] so he went back to the state that he was
[1:12:14] in before the perversion
[1:12:16] that's what happens when you left the
[1:12:19] creator to deal with the perversion
[1:12:22] we're not meant to deal with the
[1:12:23] perversion god is meant to deal with the
[1:12:26] perversion
[1:12:28] as long as the disciples was trying to
[1:12:31] keep the boat afloat
[1:12:32] yeah always get that mixed up as long as
[1:12:34] they were trying to do it themselves the
[1:12:37] creator couldn't take the perversion but
[1:12:40] that when they stopped and says god we
[1:12:42] can't do this that's when the creator
[1:12:45] came on the scene
[1:12:46] we need to stop trying to whip up on the
[1:12:48] devil in iron ability it's not going to
[1:12:51] happen you're not going to do it you're
[1:12:53] not smarter than the devil you're not
[1:12:55] stronger than the devil but there's the
[1:12:56] creator that can take every circumstance
[1:12:59] and turn it for your good
[1:13:01] take every trial and turn it for your
[1:13:03] good take everything you go through and
[1:13:06] turn it for your good
[1:13:08] we're looking up the perversion and look
[1:13:10] to the creator
[1:13:13] oh hallelujah look to the creator so i'm
[1:13:16] gonna move on and make it a little more
[1:13:18] personal what's a complex
[1:13:21] a complex is the original thoughts of
[1:13:23] god that the devil has perverted
[1:13:26] and now we're so focused on the
[1:13:28] perversion we can't come to church no
[1:13:30] more
[1:13:32] hope this is okay brother joe
[1:13:34] we're so focused on the perversion we
[1:13:36] can't go to youth gatherings no more
[1:13:38] we're so focused on the perversion we
[1:13:41] can't listen to the pastor no more
[1:13:43] because he's got something against me
[1:13:45] you know it's like the story
[1:13:47] in the bible in the old testament i
[1:13:49] believe it was the syrians
[1:13:51] had sieged samaria
[1:13:53] and they had cut off their water supply
[1:13:55] they had surrounded the city and they
[1:13:58] were inside of a wall city that they had
[1:14:00] created to defend themselves
[1:14:03] they didn't want to get hurt so they
[1:14:05] created a wall city
[1:14:07] to defend themselves and that's what a
[1:14:09] complex is
[1:14:11] you don't want to get hurt so you build
[1:14:13] up walled city
[1:14:16] but what happened on the inside of the
[1:14:18] wall city the bible says a famine took
[1:14:20] place a drought took place it got so bad
[1:14:24] that women were starting to eat their
[1:14:26] babies they were eating their own
[1:14:29] children because of the walled city
[1:14:32] and what happens though in a complex the
[1:14:35] ones you love the most get hurt
[1:14:39] your family members get hurt
[1:14:41] your parents get hurt your children gets
[1:14:44] hurt because of a walled city that you
[1:14:46] built up to protect yourself
[1:14:50] while everybody was stuck inside of this
[1:14:52] city there was some lepers that sit at
[1:14:55] the gate that says you know what are we
[1:14:57] going to sit here till we die
[1:14:59] are we just going to sit here in this
[1:15:01] perversion
[1:15:03] are we going to let this complex take
[1:15:05] every bit of christ out of us
[1:15:08] are we going to let their sickness take
[1:15:09] every bit of faith out of me or we going
[1:15:12] to fight this thing
[1:15:13] we need to quit giving in to the devil
[1:15:16] and get some grit about us and say i'm
[1:15:18] not backing down i'm not laying down but
[1:15:21] i'm going to fight for every inch of
[1:15:23] ground i'm going to press my way to
[1:15:26] christ
[1:15:27] so that the creator can take the
[1:15:29] perversion and turn it back to the
[1:15:32] original what happened so these lepers
[1:15:35] says are we going to sit here till we
[1:15:37] die they walked out of the city and
[1:15:39] there was nobody there
[1:15:42] that's what a complex is
[1:15:44] you build up a wall because your friends
[1:15:47] don't like you
[1:15:48] you build up a wall because the pastor
[1:15:50] don't like you you build up a wall
[1:15:52] because brother joe don't like you but
[1:15:54] in reality there's nothing even there
[1:15:58] just walk out of the walls
[1:16:00] walk out of the city
[1:16:02] walk out of those complexes
[1:16:05] walk out of that perversion because
[1:16:07] outside of the wall is water
[1:16:09] inside of that complex you're thirsting
[1:16:11] for fellowship at the inside of that
[1:16:13] complex you're hungering for the move of
[1:16:16] god but you can't have it inside of that
[1:16:19] wall city but walk out of the wall city
[1:16:21] there's food there's water there's
[1:16:24] fellowship there's a renewing for you
[1:16:26] there's the holy ghost for you there's
[1:16:28] deliverance for you there's salvation
[1:16:30] for you walk out of that wall city are
[1:16:33] we going to sit here until we die
[1:16:36] walk out of the perversion
[1:16:39] and get some food this evening god loves
[1:16:41] you the pastor loves you mama loves you
[1:16:44] walk out of that
[1:16:46] perversion and let the creator take the
[1:16:49] perversion and turn it back to the
[1:16:52] original
[1:16:54] oh my no weapon that has formed against
[1:16:57] you that includes complexes is going to
[1:17:00] prosper
[1:17:03] i don't care what those thoughts are
[1:17:05] that says you're not good enough you're
[1:17:06] too ugly you're too fat you're too
[1:17:08] skinny i'm sure there's some complexes
[1:17:11] that says you're too purty a complex is
[1:17:14] going to turn anything you can against
[1:17:16] you
[1:17:17] but walk out of the perversion
[1:17:21] walk out of the perversion god made you
[1:17:23] exactly the way he wanted you
[1:17:27] what happens when you're in a complex
[1:17:30] you can't fulfill the purpose that god
[1:17:32] has for you
[1:17:33] that's the devil knows he can't destroy
[1:17:35] the purpose so he puts you in a
[1:17:38] situation where you can't fulfill your
[1:17:40] purpose
[1:17:42] hey that's pretty good he can't destroy
[1:17:44] it
[1:17:45] but he allows a perversion to create
[1:17:48] around your mind
[1:17:49] you build up you're working for the
[1:17:51] devil
[1:17:52] you're working for the devil he's
[1:17:54] handing you the brick and you're piling
[1:17:56] up there you're getting some mortar
[1:17:57] you're piling it on there and the devil
[1:17:59] was right behind you laughing at you
[1:18:02] i got him now
[1:18:04] he's building his own prison cell
[1:18:06] he's proved he's building his own prison
[1:18:08] wall but they're seeing the devil we're
[1:18:11] walking out of the city
[1:18:14] the creator has opened up the prison
[1:18:16] cell opened up the walls so that we can
[1:18:19] walk out of the perversion
[1:18:22] oh my jeremiah 29 and 11 for i know the
[1:18:25] thoughts that i think towards you
[1:18:28] saith the lord fonts of peace
[1:18:31] not of evil to give you an expected end
[1:18:35] not thoughts of evil water complexes
[1:18:38] fonts of evil but that's not the
[1:18:41] original thoughts of god
[1:18:43] that's a perversion that the devilish
[1:18:46] took off of the original
[1:18:49] oh my but the branham says there has
[1:18:51] been so much mockery in the name of
[1:18:53] divine healing there's been so much
[1:18:55] mockery in the phrase of religion but
[1:18:58] there's a real power of the holy spirit
[1:19:01] that delivers the human being
[1:19:04] glory to god that delivers the human
[1:19:06] being from the bondage of sin there's a
[1:19:09] real power of the holy spirit that
[1:19:12] delivers the sufferer from his suffering
[1:19:16] the devil's got a perverted power but
[1:19:19] there is the real power that can take
[1:19:21] you from complexes take you from anxiety
[1:19:25] let's deal with anxiety
[1:19:28] what's the anxiety it's the peace the
[1:19:30] pathophile understanding that's been
[1:19:33] perverted
[1:19:34] now you're scared to even drive
[1:19:36] you're scared to walk out of your home
[1:19:38] you're scared to go here you're you're
[1:19:40] scared to get close to somebody because
[1:19:42] you're afraid they're going to hurt you
[1:19:45] you're afraid of this and afraid of that
[1:19:47] that's a perversion that wasn't myth for
[1:19:49] you
[1:19:50] you're meant to have a peace a sound
[1:19:52] mind a power
[1:19:54] oh come on somebody i'm saying this
[1:19:57] evening you don't got to stay in the
[1:19:59] perversion walk out of the perversion
[1:20:02] and start to manifest the purpose that
[1:20:05] god has for you
[1:20:06] oh hallelujah ii timothy 1 7 for god has
[1:20:10] not given us a spirit of fear but a
[1:20:13] power of love and of a sound mind
[1:20:17] that's the real spirit i'm talking about
[1:20:19] of power
[1:20:21] of love you know you don't know what
[1:20:22] that person done to me you know what we
[1:20:24] did to christ
[1:20:26] we're the ones that put him on the cross
[1:20:30] and so what happens bitterness starts to
[1:20:31] come in i hope this is okay tonight
[1:20:33] bitterness starts to come in because
[1:20:35] that one did you wrong
[1:20:37] and so what that is doing is a
[1:20:39] perversion that's perverting your life
[1:20:42] it's starting to corrupt you from the
[1:20:44] inside like a cancer you can't see
[1:20:47] cancer from the outside but on the
[1:20:49] inside it's eating away
[1:20:50] that's what bitterness does
[1:20:53] you don't know what so-and-so did to me
[1:20:55] 20 years ago i don't care what so-and-so
[1:20:58] did i know what god did
[1:21:00] god paid the price so bitterness can be
[1:21:03] destroyed christ paid the price so that
[1:21:07] hatred toward your loved one towards
[1:21:09] your family member whoever it is can be
[1:21:12] dealt with
[1:21:13] it's a perversion that's not meant for
[1:21:15] you
[1:21:16] let the creator take you to the original
[1:21:21] oh my let the creator
[1:21:24] take it back to the original
[1:21:26] you're saying we don't got no choice
[1:21:29] to go through trials we don't got a
[1:21:31] choice to go through perversions but we
[1:21:34] do have a choice to let the perversion
[1:21:36] comes on the inside
[1:21:39] what's the devil after he's after your
[1:21:40] faith the trials that you go through
[1:21:43] it's him trying to destroy your
[1:21:45] confidence in god
[1:21:47] it's him trying to destroy your
[1:21:49] confidence in his work so when you go
[1:21:51] through trials you don't get a choice
[1:21:54] but you do have a choice to let that
[1:21:56] come on the inside and disrupt your
[1:21:58] faith and start to pervert your faith
[1:22:01] oh what's the bible say in first peter 1
[1:22:03] 5 who were kept by the power of god
[1:22:06] through faith
[1:22:08] you are kept by faith so if the devil
[1:22:11] can disrupt your faith there's nothing
[1:22:14] to anchor you no more
[1:22:16] oh my but as long as you don't let the
[1:22:18] perversion affect your faith you're
[1:22:21] anchored you're solid and nothing can
[1:22:24] move you nothing can shake you
[1:22:27] under salvation ready to be revealed in
[1:22:29] the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice
[1:22:31] lord now for our season if need be
[1:22:34] you're in heaviness through manifold
[1:22:35] temptation the trial of your faith being
[1:22:38] much more precious than of god that
[1:22:41] perished though it betrayed with fire
[1:22:44] might be found in a praise and honor and
[1:22:46] glory at the appearing of jesus christ
[1:22:48] the trying of your faith is worth more
[1:22:51] than goals we don't realize the
[1:22:54] necessity of faith too many times we
[1:22:56] can't be healed without faith we're not
[1:22:58] going to see a body change without faith
[1:23:00] we're not going to see a rapture without
[1:23:02] faith we can't take the message off of
[1:23:05] the tape players and manifested without
[1:23:07] faith
[1:23:08] and so the trials is trying to destroy
[1:23:10] your faith are you catching me this
[1:23:12] evening but we don't gotta we don't
[1:23:14] gotta allow the devil to destroy our
[1:23:17] faith
[1:23:18] oh my brother branham says you see we're
[1:23:21] either going to let the trial build up
[1:23:23] our faith or destroy our faith you look
[1:23:26] at brother branham and his trainer his
[1:23:28] boxing trainer he was going through
[1:23:30] trial after trial of the tribal that
[1:23:31] branham says his trainer would beat up
[1:23:34] on him hit him knock him out of the ring
[1:23:36] and brother branham says he got up one
[1:23:37] time and says are you trying to kill me
[1:23:40] what is it what are you trying to do he
[1:23:42] says i'm equipping your body
[1:23:44] he says the big blows stops the blood
[1:23:47] and he says once your blood stops you're
[1:23:49] going to pass out but i'm equipping your
[1:23:51] body right now with these big blows so
[1:23:54] that when you're on the ring you can
[1:23:56] take big blows and while the other ones
[1:23:58] are falling down for the count you can
[1:24:00] get back up
[1:24:02] so brother branham could have seen you
[1:24:04] know i'm not made for this and walked
[1:24:06] out of the ring
[1:24:08] or he could say you know what i'm going
[1:24:09] to allow the trials to build up my
[1:24:12] purpose
[1:24:13] we can either quit in the trial and walk
[1:24:16] away or we could say i'm going to keep
[1:24:18] pressing on and let the trial build up
[1:24:21] my faith you see the trainer wasn't
[1:24:23] trying to destroy his purpose he was
[1:24:26] trying to equip him for his purpose
[1:24:29] oh my god ain't trying to destroy the
[1:24:32] purpose he's allowing the devil to put
[1:24:34] you through hard times to equip you for
[1:24:37] your purpose so now brother branham he
[1:24:39] was undefeated he won the championship
[1:24:42] he could gum street got knocked down
[1:24:43] many times but because of his training
[1:24:46] he could get back up the other ones will
[1:24:48] lay down and walk away and the other one
[1:24:51] your friends may be walking away your
[1:24:53] loved ones may be walking away but
[1:24:55] because of your training you're still
[1:24:57] here
[1:24:58] because of the trials you're still
[1:25:01] standing strong on your faith
[1:25:04] oh my you look at the shooting my woman
[1:25:06] the street of my woman wasn't able to
[1:25:08] have a child she wasn't able to look
[1:25:10] like god was punishing her it looked
[1:25:12] like god was
[1:25:14] was sending her through hard times for
[1:25:16] no reason but it was that trial that
[1:25:18] created the faith for another trial
[1:25:22] you know what i'm talking about she
[1:25:23] wasn't able to have a child so the
[1:25:25] prophet gave her a child she was barren
[1:25:27] she couldn't have no children but the
[1:25:29] prophet gave her a child and later on in
[1:25:31] the story the child dies
[1:25:34] but since god gave her a child when she
[1:25:36] wasn't able to have one she knew that
[1:25:39] child created the faith
[1:25:41] if god gave me a trial if god brought me
[1:25:44] through that one he can take me through
[1:25:46] this one so what happens she goes to the
[1:25:48] prophet the prophet says all is well
[1:25:50] with you all is well all is well with
[1:25:53] your husband all his will all is well
[1:25:55] with your baby all is well i know if i
[1:25:59] can just get in front of the prophet
[1:26:02] come on somebody if i can just get in
[1:26:04] front of the one that gave me the
[1:26:06] promise
[1:26:07] god gave you a promise he's never going
[1:26:10] to leave you he's never going to forsake
[1:26:11] you but he's going to be with you if you
[1:26:14] can just get in front of the creator
[1:26:16] this evening the perversion can be re
[1:26:19] returned back to the original
[1:26:21] but it took the training to equip her
[1:26:24] faith
[1:26:25] it was that trial that built up a faith
[1:26:29] you see it was in the midst of her
[1:26:30] brokenness too many times we allow the
[1:26:33] devil to work in our brokenness
[1:26:35] we're at our lowest of the lowest the
[1:26:37] weakest of the weakest and right there
[1:26:39] we're at a vulnerable point the devil's
[1:26:41] going to come in and whisper lies to us
[1:26:43] and he's going to take advantage of our
[1:26:45] brokenness but god wants to take
[1:26:47] advantage of your brokenness
[1:26:49] you may say you don't know where i'm at
[1:26:51] my heart's crushed i'm this i'm that
[1:26:53] god's right there to bring you through
[1:26:55] it
[1:26:56] but he's waiting for somebody to look to
[1:26:58] him
[1:26:59] oh my you see it was jonah's brokenness
[1:27:02] that god used to win a city you know
[1:27:06] brother branham says whenever he went to
[1:27:07] nineveh he says that
[1:27:09] nineveh worshiped the sea gods and so
[1:27:12] whenever that well came up and brother
[1:27:13] branham says he wrote his tongue on the
[1:27:15] sea or on his hand and jonah came
[1:27:17] walking off the tongue and he says
[1:27:18] repent or perish brother branham says
[1:27:21] they seen their sea god spit out a
[1:27:23] prophet that says repent or perish it
[1:27:27] was it was jonah's brokenness
[1:27:29] that god used to win a city
[1:27:32] i could just imagine it was just
[1:27:33] dramatizing for a second jonah's walking
[1:27:36] out and these men come walking up to him
[1:27:38] what are you doing
[1:27:40] why are you here he says repent or
[1:27:42] perish why
[1:27:43] well why why does god care about us
[1:27:46] why is he why did he send you here to
[1:27:48] save us then he could tell his testimony
[1:27:51] and say you know what i was running from
[1:27:52] god i was running for my purpose i was
[1:27:55] running for my calling but the same god
[1:27:58] that gave me a second chance he's here
[1:28:00] to give you a second chance it was his
[1:28:02] brokenness
[1:28:04] that god used to win a city and god can
[1:28:07] use your brokenness to win somebody to
[1:28:10] christ god can use your brokenness to
[1:28:13] win your neighbor to win a family member
[1:28:16] so instead of letting the devil take the
[1:28:18] brokenness let god take the brokenness
[1:28:22] the woman up the well used her
[1:28:24] brokenness to win many souls
[1:28:26] she ran into the city and says come see
[1:28:28] a man who told me all that i ever done
[1:28:31] the bible says in john 4 39 many of the
[1:28:33] samaritans of the city believed on him
[1:28:36] for the saying of the woman he told me
[1:28:38] all i ever done it was her brokenness
[1:28:41] that god used to win a city
[1:28:45] you notice christ never went inside of
[1:28:47] the city
[1:28:48] but he won somebody through their
[1:28:50] brokenness and they went into the city
[1:28:53] don't ever be ashamed of your testimony
[1:28:56] don't be ashamed of what god did for you
[1:28:58] you know too many people think well i'm
[1:29:00] not a preacher god can't use me i'm not
[1:29:02] a singer god can't use me gifts and
[1:29:04] callings are without repentance each one
[1:29:07] of us is here with a calling
[1:29:09] you may not have any gifts that you can
[1:29:11] point to but you're still called
[1:29:14] he separates the two gifts and callings
[1:29:18] you may say i don't play music i don't
[1:29:19] sing i don't preach i don't do this that
[1:29:22] doesn't mean you're not called god's
[1:29:24] called you for a purpose that the ones
[1:29:26] with gifts can't fulfill
[1:29:29] me as the preacher don't get your
[1:29:30] testimony me as a preacher don't get
[1:29:32] your testimony but god has given you a
[1:29:35] calling that i can do
[1:29:38] hey my brother my brother caleb's not a
[1:29:40] preacher mean quote we are preachers
[1:29:42] we're singers we're song leaders we're
[1:29:43] playing music caleb sometimes feels left
[1:29:45] out but i told him you've got a
[1:29:47] testimony i don't got
[1:29:50] so me as a preacher can't fulfill a
[1:29:52] purpose that you've got because you've
[1:29:54] got another calling we need to quit
[1:29:56] comparing ourselves to this one quit
[1:29:59] comparing yourselves to that one we're
[1:30:01] comparing yourselves to each other
[1:30:03] you've got a calling that you can't only
[1:30:06] you can fulfill
[1:30:09] so now when somebody's in drugs i've
[1:30:11] never been bound to drugs so i can't
[1:30:14] tell them how god delivered me but caleb
[1:30:15] can
[1:30:17] no one ever whenever somebody's bound by
[1:30:19] drinking i've never been bound by
[1:30:20] drinking but kayla passed
[1:30:22] so now he's got something through his
[1:30:24] brokenness that god can use to save
[1:30:27] somebody
[1:30:29] you've got something through your
[1:30:30] brokenness
[1:30:31] that god can use for your purpose
[1:30:35] all things work together for the good
[1:30:37] according to his purpose
[1:30:40] so a purpose is never destroyed
[1:30:43] oh my so we can let that pervert our
[1:30:45] faith but the brandon says there's a
[1:30:47] certain amount of faith that goes with
[1:30:49] satan in order to accept satan you've
[1:30:52] got to believe satan so there's a
[1:30:54] perverted faith to a perverted faith so
[1:30:58] in order for bitterness to set in
[1:31:00] complex is the set in these other things
[1:31:02] to set in you've got to accept it
[1:31:05] you've got no choice to go through it
[1:31:07] but you do got a choice to let it come
[1:31:09] in and pervert your faith you know
[1:31:11] brother branham says in order to believe
[1:31:13] a lie you've got to reject the truth so
[1:31:16] in order to believe those complexes you
[1:31:18] gotta reject what god thinks towards you
[1:31:22] oh
[1:31:23] come on somebody in order to accept that
[1:31:25] anxiety you gotta reject the peace that
[1:31:28] god's got for you and let me tell you
[1:31:31] this the complexes are taking you down
[1:31:33] but god's peace will take you up
[1:31:35] that faith is going to take you up
[1:31:38] don't don't let the devil take that away
[1:31:40] from you what do paul say i've ran my
[1:31:43] course i finished the race and i've kept
[1:31:45] my faith he went through shipwreck he
[1:31:48] was beaten he was scorched he was stoned
[1:31:51] but none of the perversions took his
[1:31:53] faith away and he could stand at the end
[1:31:56] of the day and say devil you tried to
[1:31:58] destroy me you tried to pervert me but
[1:32:01] i'm not allowing the perversion to come
[1:32:03] on the inside
[1:32:05] i'm going to keep my faith in the word
[1:32:07] of god i'm going to keep my faith in
[1:32:10] sight of the word of god inside of my
[1:32:12] purpose
[1:32:13] brother branham says
[1:32:15] he says salvation lasts as long as faith
[1:32:18] lasts divine healing lasts as long as
[1:32:21] faith lasts oh my he says your
[1:32:23] experience 40 years ago forgot you ever
[1:32:26] had an experience and go out here
[1:32:28] tonight and say i don't believe in it
[1:32:30] i'm not god's servant now more watch how
[1:32:32] long your experience lasts certainly
[1:32:35] your experience lasts as long as your
[1:32:37] faith lasts
[1:32:38] so if you allow the devil to pervert
[1:32:40] your faith brother branham says a
[1:32:42] perverted faith is unbelief
[1:32:44] so whenever your faith starts to be
[1:32:46] perverted unbelief's coming in and now
[1:32:49] you're losing your salvation
[1:32:51] you're losing your joy you're losing
[1:32:53] your peace you're losing your happiness
[1:32:56] but you don't got to leave the same way
[1:32:58] the creators in the building
[1:33:00] that they restore your peace restore the
[1:33:03] joy restore the long suffering and give
[1:33:06] you a revival like never before give
[1:33:09] your renewing like never before
[1:33:11] hey too many times we have more
[1:33:13] expectation for the building cover
[1:33:15] revival than we do for us to have a
[1:33:17] revival
[1:33:19] hey it's something i've been thinking we
[1:33:20] have a revival this weekend and i
[1:33:21] started thinking about it we get all
[1:33:23] prepared i hope it's okay we get all
[1:33:26] prepared we get food cooked we get a
[1:33:29] building we get our building set up and
[1:33:31] everything and we get more expectation
[1:33:33] for the building than we do for us
[1:33:36] we have more expectations for this one
[1:33:39] to be healed this one will be set free
[1:33:40] than we do we come to church just
[1:33:43] expecting to hear a good sermon
[1:33:46] but let's put our expectations a little
[1:33:48] more personal i don't want just to hear
[1:33:50] a good sermon i want the god of the
[1:33:52] sermon to touch me one more time i want
[1:33:55] the guard of the sermon to renew me
[1:33:57] revive the fire
[1:33:59] hey the fire's still there i made us got
[1:34:01] a little dim but you just need a wind
[1:34:03] but then brandon says what's the revival
[1:34:05] he says it's not bringing new converts
[1:34:07] in it's not fellowshipping he says those
[1:34:09] things come with them our revival is to
[1:34:11] revive what you already got
[1:34:14] so that fire may be a little dim ashamed
[1:34:16] you look at in the beginning the bible
[1:34:18] says the spirit of the lord moved on the
[1:34:20] face of the waters so the spirit of the
[1:34:23] lord took chaos and made paradise
[1:34:26] just like we was in chaos and the spirit
[1:34:28] of the lord took chaos and made paradise
[1:34:31] for god to live in but you notice the
[1:34:33] devil came into the garden and because
[1:34:36] of sin paradise started to be perverted
[1:34:39] but god ain't going to allow the earth
[1:34:41] just to pervert away brother branham
[1:34:43] says the fire that's going to burn the
[1:34:45] earth is a baptism of fire so it's going
[1:34:48] to get a renewing
[1:34:50] even though the spirit of the lord moved
[1:34:52] in the beginning
[1:34:53] because of sin his needs are renewing
[1:34:56] you may have got a touch 30 years ago
[1:34:59] you may have gone to touch 50 years ago
[1:35:01] but if the perverter has perverted your
[1:35:03] faith you need another touch and you're
[1:35:06] not too old for another touch
[1:35:09] you're not too young for a touch oh we
[1:35:11] get in our minds well i've been in the
[1:35:13] message for 50 years i can't get nothing
[1:35:15] else from god you're perverted
[1:35:19] you're perverting oh my i i haven't felt
[1:35:22] the presence of the lord in 20 years
[1:35:24] you're perverted but the shame that the
[1:35:26] creators in the building to take the
[1:35:28] perversion that you're in and restore
[1:35:31] the joy of your salvation rekindle the
[1:35:34] flame that you had 30 years ago
[1:35:38] rekindle the flame that you had back
[1:35:40] whenever you first give your heart to
[1:35:42] god
[1:35:42] [Applause]
[1:35:44] brother brandon i i don't got the quote
[1:35:46] in front of me he says you may say i got
[1:35:49] touched 30 years ago but he says what
[1:35:51] about today
[1:35:52] he says that experience got wiggletails
[1:35:54] in it
[1:35:55] oh my that means it's starting to rot
[1:35:58] it's starting to be perverted so we
[1:36:00] can't rely on an experience that we got
[1:36:02] 30 years ago because it's going to start
[1:36:04] to pervert itself
[1:36:06] but you need experience today you need
[1:36:08] one sunday you need one next week
[1:36:12] oh my it's an experience that god can
[1:36:14] give us on a daily
[1:36:16] basis
[1:36:17] too many times we put our period on we
[1:36:20] put a period on our experience
[1:36:23] we're not meant to put a period in our
[1:36:25] experience our experience is still going
[1:36:27] to be going when we're on the rapture
[1:36:30] we're going to experience things we've
[1:36:31] never experienced before
[1:36:33] so if we're putting our putting a period
[1:36:36] on our experience as the musicians come
[1:36:38] if we're putting an experience or a
[1:36:40] period in our experience that means god
[1:36:42] can't do nothing for us anymore
[1:36:44] but let's take the limits off god
[1:36:46] let's take the period off and say you
[1:36:49] know what god
[1:36:50] there are some things in my life i'm not
[1:36:52] happy with
[1:36:53] the perverter has come and perverted
[1:36:55] some things but tonight i recognize your
[1:36:57] presence i may not even i may not be
[1:37:00] able to feel your presence tonight lord

[1:37:21] brother branham says that david didn't
[1:37:23] lose his salvation he lost the joy of
[1:37:26] his salvation
[1:37:28] you may have not lost the holy ghost you
[1:37:30] may have lost the joy of it
[1:37:32] what's the mean to lose the joy of the
[1:37:33] holy ghost you're not proud to be a
