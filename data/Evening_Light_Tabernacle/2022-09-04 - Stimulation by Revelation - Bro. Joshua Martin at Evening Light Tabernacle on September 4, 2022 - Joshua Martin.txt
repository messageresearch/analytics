a period on the relationship with god but we need to have an experience every day amen if you have your bibles let's turn to revelation six and six i'm just a i'm a simple preacher so i pray something can be said this morning to be a blessing amen amen it's good to see another oaky this morning sister alex and we're we're fighting hard feelings back home y'all are taking her from us but we're excited to see what god has in store for their lives amen before we read can we bow our heads dear heavenly father lord we want to thank you for your grace and your mercy god you've been so good to us lord you brought us to your house safely god give us this opportunity to come into your presence lord you place a desire in our hearts to come into your house lord not everybody has that desire and we want to stop and say thank you for it father lord as we enter to this part of the service i ask that you would anoint me god as i lay myself aside i've studied for today lord i ask that you would speak to these lips of clay father may the words that you have for this service be spoken we ask these things in your precious name amen revelation 6 and 6 and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see the heart not the oil and the wine you may be seated this this morning and got a simple subject could be stimulation by revelation brother branham i know with a lot of these things we all know i know y'all are well taught here so i'm not bringing nothing new this morning but i ask that you would just enter in with me and see what the lord has in store but the brand themselves now oil templify spirit wine symbolizes stimulation of revelation boy i like to run all over the place it's a wonder i didn't wake up the neighborhood when the lord showed me that stimulation of revelation and i'm so glad that brother branham wasn't too prideful to get excited about revelation brother branham wasn't too st too stuck up or too big of a name to get excited about what the lord is doing in his life and i don't believe we got to be ashamed of what the lord is doing in our life if god's done something for you we've got a right to express our feelings you know i'm just going to preach this morning but there's too many people going around saying we can't praise the lord we can't worship the lord we can't lift our hands but i believe if you're born again and god has done something for you you've got every right to lift up your hands and praise the lord you've got every right to say god you healed my body and i'm going to praise you for it you know we get we get labeled pentecostal but i started thinking about it that pentecostal is just mimicking what the bride's got what's a counterfeit you've never seen a counterfeit four to four dollar bill because there's not one out there but there are counterfeit one dollar bills five dollar bills ten dollar bills they're taking a genuine and mimicking it so if the pentecostals can praise the lord and they're just amendment oh come on somebody they're just a counterfeit what can the bride of christ do when they got the revealed word in their midst we got a right to praise the lord we got a right to shout and rejoice because not everybody can see what god is doing in this day but you've got a desire you've got something in your heart to see the word of god oh my in that same quote he says old and wine and the bible is associated together always i got the concordance out and looked and there's a string of them like that where wine and oil goes together all the time see so oil symbolizes spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of revelation and these two work together you can't have revelation without have the holy ghost and you can't have the holy ghost without it leading you to a revelation but you got to have the spirit and the truth to produce a revelation too many people thinks we're going to have all word but no spirit all that's going to do is produce an intellectual conception then you got the other side that believes it's all spirits and no word we don't need the deep things of god all that's going to do is produce an emotion produce this sensation but when spirit and truth comes together it's going to produce what god has for this last day what did jesus say they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth but you notice how he said that must worship me he didn't say if you feel like it or if you want to but you must worship in spirit the holy ghost and in truth the things of the word and my produces a stimulation by revelation you see brother branham says that the only thing that you're ever going the only way you're ever going to get it a revelation has to come from god it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual endowment you can even memorize the scripture so we're saying here you can take the intellectual side of it and memorize scripture and though that's wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from god it says in the word that no man can say that jesus is the christ except by the holy ghost you have to receive the holy ghost then and only then can the spirit give you the revelation that jesus is the christ so you can't even say jesus is the christ without the holy ghost oh my so you see the importance of the holy ghost you look at second uh corinthians 3 and 6 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so you can't have all word without the spirit and what you can't have all spirit without the word there's the middle line and i believe the holy ghost is to guide us into the message of the hour you look at john 16 and 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth not portions of the truth but he's to guide you into all truth you see brother branham says the methodists have portions of truth the pentecostals have portions of truth about this have portions of truth but they're taking a portion of truth and denominating around it instead of moving on into all truth and we can do the same thing in the message we can take our favorite quotes and say i got truth but push away the rest of the message that's going to produce a powerless life that's going to produce a powerless hope but you want a powerful home you want a powerful family you want a powerful church stick with the message of the hour not portions of the message but be led into all truth all of the message you see the holy ghost is to take away all of your thinking so that the headship of the word can take preeminence into your life so no longer are you thinking your own thoughts and what you think is right but now you're thinking god's thoughts which is the message of the hour what are prophets a prophet is a mouthpiece of god what is the word expressed it's first a thought so before you before i'm speaking these words it's a thought in my head so before we got the message of the hour it was spots in the thought in the mind of god so he sent those thoughts to a prophet and as that prophet began to speak the message speak those thoughts it became word form and now there's a bride on earth that's under the spirit of truth and no longer leaving out her own thoughts but she's coming under the message of the hour which is the thoughts of god and now we're making the word manifest on earth just like jesus made the word manifested when he was on earth i don't believe that we got the message in this last day to puff up our head knowledge we didn't get the message in this last day just to show how smart we are but we got the message in this day so that the word can walk on earth just like it did when jesus was on earth with the same signs the same wonders i believe we can lay hands on the and they shall be covered we can we can die god walk on serpents that shall not harm us what is it we are coming under the headship of the word of god and it's producing the same signs oh my but branham says that's exactly when the church and the word has to be won just like god jesus and god was one just exactly god was in christ reconciling the world to himself so will christ have to be in the church the anointed word to make everything fulfilled so in order to fulfill the word for this day the anointed word has to take preeminence in a body oh my i'm gonna say it again in order for the thoughts of god to be fulfilled in this last day somebody has to accept the thoughts of god and say god i'm pushing away my thinking and embracing your thinking [Applause] man's thoughts ain't going to produce a rapture man's thoughts ain't gonna produce a body change man's parts ain't gonna bring that's the future home but the thoughts of god will produce a body change in everybody that's coming under the headship of the message oh my too many people is hanging on to their own thoughts but are refusing to come under the thoughts of god hey hope this is okay this morning refusing to come under the thoughts of god well that's just his opinion is that really thus saith the lord right there you're embracing your thoughts and pushing away god's thoughts oh i believe god anointed i'm a firm believer in the message i know some of you some of you y'all might not know me but let me just introduce myself i'm a firm believer in the message so if you come to hear the message of the hour this morning you're going to hear it and so i believe god anointed a prophet and gave us a message not his ideas but god's thoughts to get a bride ready for a rapture to get a bride ready for the future home and it's only through the message of the hour is there going to be a rapture oh what's the bible say faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god not the word and man's ideas not the word of man's opinions not the word of what you think is right but faith only comes by the word of god and that's why we needed a message because the bible got scrupled up throughout the church ages that's why there's some believing in three gods some say you got to be sprinkled some say this and some say that all reading out of the same bible all reading out of the same bible but are coming up with different interpretations coming up with different ideas but the message comes to do away with man's interpretation and give god's interpretation with god's interpretation comes an authority to make the message live with god's interpretation comes the power to take the message off of the ipads take the message off of the tape player take the message off of the computers and make it live but it's only through god's interpretation oh my what's the bible say the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride so the spirit that anointed brother branham to say something the bride has come under the same anointing the same inspiration and they're picking up the same thought pattern oh now the same thought proud of brother branham wasn't his thought pattern it was god's thought pattern so when we come under the same inspiration we're getting the same thought pattern come on somebody just like brother branham have the third pull in action i believe the bride of christ has the same authority on the inside of your life under the headship of the message oh you look at hattie wright brother branham was telling the stories of the telling the story of the three squirrels that he spoke into existence he was telling them about the inspiration about the third pool then what happened there was a little young lady there was a little mama that might not have been important but the brandon says she barely made any money at all but she came under the same inspiration she was hearing the word come forth she was hearing the thoughts of god come forth and she says that's nothing but the truth she come under the same inspiration that the prophet was under and what happened it produced the same signs it produced the same actions oh my brother branham stop and he says you speak the word what do you have needed you speak the word of god and god will give it to you he says if you win a million dollars god will give it to you you want your sister to be healed god will give it to you and what does she say she says i want my boys to be saved and brother branham says those boys were over on the corner laughing and snickering and making fun of what was going on let me say this you want your children safe get in the message i don't care how far they're gone how lost they are you want your loved ones to get under the inspiration of this message oh brother josh you don't know how far she's gone you don't know how far he's gone i don't care i know of the grace of god and under the inspiration of the message is the power to speak the word and things has to materialize now i know there's some that's taking it as a prosperity gospel saying yeah i want to speak for a call i'm going to speak for that that's not the way it works but i believe you can speak over a loved one sister kimberly where are you in the building system this morning you're a witness of what god can do through a young person under the inspiration of the message that's not for sister kimbers just for sister kimberly that's for everybody that's under the inspiration of the message [Applause] oh i hope this is okay this morning but hattie wright says i want my boy saved and brother says god gives them to you and what happens the boys fall over her lap crying weeping their way to calvary god filled them with the holy ghost it was a mama that pushed away what she thought was right pushed away her thinking and embraced god's thinking then the thinking of god started to materialize in her life oh my that's what revelation does it takes something that we couldn't understand before and starts to reveal itself you see how come this bride is being stimulated how come she's happy how come she's got joy and peace in the midst of the trial is because the word that was twisted up by man's ideas has been revealed with the same power and same authority it's same anointing you see this message has enlightened our eyes of our understanding we're no longer looking for man's interpretation but now we're looking through god's interpretation you see well you see you see through human interpretation we will never know what the book says brother branham says that revelations is a book of symbols how would we know what the book of symbols said if god didn't give us the interpretation of the book of symbols i know where i know this is all you know you've heard all this before but this is something that's become a reality to me we needed a message so that we can understand what god has in this day you see but the brandon didn't come to do away with the scriptures he come to give an interpretation of the scriptures jesus would say in matthew 5 and 17 think not that i come to destroy the law all the prophets have not come to destroy but i come to fulfill but the brandon says the christ was magnifying the law he was taking what was written in the past and magnifying it and bringing the true interpretation jesus says you have heard of them saying of all time thou shalt not kill whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but i say unto you whosoever is angry with thy brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment he was saying they say of old but i'm bringing the interpretation of what they are saying oh my you have heard him said uh them of those that shall not commit adultery but i say unto you whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her have committed adultery he wasn't doing away with the law he was bringing the true interpretation of the law and this message ain't doing away with the scriptures it's bringing the true interpretation of the scriptures brother branham would say moses had a scriptural sign he was that great prophet of god that went down there to deliver them they recognized it they recognized the sign he was the exact scriptural sign promised vindicated and jesus was the promise of the scripture vindicated to the woman at the well or he was the interpretation jesus was the interpretation of scripture his own life interpreted the scripture then he stops and he says don't you see the message don't you see the message of the hour can you recognize where we are at the message itself from scripture interprets to you the hour that we're living in so it takes scripture prophecies for this day and says hey this seems something in the future this is something right now you show your hands on this sick and then shall recover that ain't something in the past that ain't something in the future but that is right now repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that ain't something for just the past that ain't something in the future but that's something right now he brought an interpretation and says this is the time the hour the moment for scripture to be fulfilled oh my i'm so grateful for that that the message brought the interpretation brother branhammer says have you ever thought how great this is what what could you give in exchange for this day of confusion he says this is a day of confusion but what could we give to what can we get to give up the day of confusion this day when people don't know what to do which way to go the bible says these things would come that there would be a famine in the land not for bread or for water but for hearing get this part but for hearing the true word of god the true word of god not what this one says mixed with the word of god but the true word of god and the people would go from east to west from north to south seeking to hear the true word of god and here we are privileged tonight to see the message of god don't take for granted the sherman message church come on somebody don't take for granted that you can understand the message because not everybody can understand it oh jesus the disciples asked jesus why he spoke in parables and he says it has not given them to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to you it is given the disciples asked him how come you're speaking in a parable how come you're speaking in a mysterious way because he was saying this ain't for them it's for you oh and the same thing is happening in this last day the message came forth but the but the denominations can't understand it it's not given for them to understand it's given for you to understand this day this scripture is fulfilled in front of your eyes in your life oh my they couldn't understand him he was speaking in a mysterious way you see there was many in brother branham's day that says he was a great man of god he's seen he's seen visions he could read people's lives he could lay hands on the sick and they would recover then they stopped and they said but when it came to his teaching when it came to his doctrine he was off they could see the signs but whenever it came to the mysterious voice they couldn't understand it but we're not looking at a mystery we're not looking at a parable we're looking at the interpretation of the mystery we're looking at the interpretation of the parable oh matthew 11 25 says and at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee your father lord of heaven and earth because thou must hit these things from the wise uh from the eyes of the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes oh my i'm so glad he revealed this message in my life you see what did the prophet do to the prophet spoke in isaiah that there was going to be a virgin conceived that there was going to be somebody bear the life of god and that didn't happen until 400 years later but that didn't matter how long it took the word of god came forth that there was going to be a virgin conceived and then there came another prophet or another angel on earth that came to mary he didn't bring something new but he came and he told mary that this is the time for that scripture to be fulfilled [Applause] hope you're following me this morning gabriel didn't bring something new he says yeah i did a little study on it there was scripture after scripture after scripture that he was quoting to her whenever he was talking to her says you're blessed and highly favored he was quoting many scriptures what was he doing he wasn't bringing a new message but his message was to let mary know that this is the time for scriptures to be fulfilled oh my he was letting her know brother josh this is the time for the message to be fulfilled in your life but branham says the reason why isaiah didn't say a mary shall conceive is because all the girls would have been named mary he didn't say the name but whenever he spoke the word in the back part of god's mind he knew there was a chosen vessel on earth that was going to take the message take the word and manifest it your your physical name might not be in the bible you can't find josh martin you can't find these other names but by revelation i can say my name is in the book because of the message oh come on somebody the message didn't bring nothing new it opened my eyes and says you're more than a conqueror through christ jesus who strengthens you you shall lay hands on the and they shall recover these things they and all these things are more than controversial these are promises for you but the message comes and opens your eyes and says this is the time for a rapture this is the time for body change this is the time and you're the one to fulfill scripture you're the one to take prophecies for this day and manifest it that's why the bride can get excited because god chose me to manifest his thoughts oh my god chose the need to manifest what he has in this last day oh it was promised that the seals would be open in this day and underneath the seals was what god had for this day underneath the seals was the book of redemption your name was in the book of redemption your inheritance was in the book of redemption your authority was in the book of redemption but under the seals when the seals were still on it you couldn't see your name you was just guessing that it was there he was just guessing that you were going to see a body change but once the seals came open you could see your name and realize it's going to be revealed through me [Applause] oh my but random says he breaks the seals and reveals it gives us his inheritance to the people gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsmen redeever and he freely gives it to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it for himself he gives it back to the people my when adam sinned in the garden the book of the power of the spoken word went back to god so god never lost the spoken word god never lost eternal life man lost eternal life so in order for the spoken word to be redeemed back it's got to come back to who lost it so when the seals came open god wasn't going to keep the book of redemption he never lost it man lost the book of redemption man lost the spoken word man lost authority man lost a minion but once the seals came open once the seals came off the book god says i'm not going to keep it i've had it for all of these years i'm going to give it back to a young person i'm going to give it back to a mama i'm going to give it back to a daddy i'm going to give it back to somebody who thinks they're the lowest of the lowest they might not think they're anybody special but you're blessed and a highly favored you may say brother josh i'm a nobody nobody even knows my name they don't even know i'm here this morning god knows you're here this morning and the reason you're here is because god has something for you the reason you're here is because there's a drawing power on the inside of your heart to be here oh man let me just say this yeah before that drawing power was on the inside of your heart there was somebody on the other side drowning you now let me say this the devil ain't going to draw you to church oh come on somebody the devil don't want you to come to church so if there's a drawing power on the inside to be closer to god that means there's a god in this building that wants to give you something if there's something on the inside that wants to get a revelation of this message that means there's a revelation for you [Applause] if you want healing in your body that means there's healing for you oh it's a deep calling to the deep what a brother branham saying before there was a squirrel there was a tree for the squirrel to be in before there was a fish there was water for that fish to be in and before there was a desire there was something to satisfy that desire oh my but underneath the seals was my inheritance and then brother branham came with that book and he started to speak the word spring forth the message and now we're come under the message and are manifesting the thoughts for this last day you know brother branham says when moses was under inspiration he said let there be flies let there be lives let there be frogs he says if it was moses's own thoughts that wouldn't have come to pass but it was god's thoughts so god was obligated to manifest his word so whenever he said left there'd be frogs there had to be frogs because that wasn't his thoughts that was god's own thoughts and oh my but that didn't just you see that the power of moses's message wasn't just for moses but it was for everybody under the message i could just i can imagine miriam can see the flies come into existence see the frogs come into existence see the water turned in the blood and she's mine that's that's wonderful and all but i'm still in bondage the message hasn't done nothing for me it's working in the prophet oh yeah it's working in the preacher aaron but what about me but then there come a time where revelation just wasn't for the prophet revelation this wasn't for the preacher it wasn't just for them but then all of a sudden she was on the other side of the red sea she turned around and seen the message in action not just for the prophet not just for the preacher but the message was an action for her life oh the taskmasters for aaron never did that's all fired the taskmasters for the prophet was dead that's all fine but my task masters are dead this morning the message ain't just for the prophet ain't just for the preacher ain't just for the deacons but it's for a young person your task masters can be dead this morning those complexes can't be destroyed this morning that anxiety can't be destroyed this morning the message the authority of the message ain't just for the preachers but it's for every person under the inspiration of the message glory to god it's a young person that's recognized his day her day and says you know what devil this is my time but the brandon says the god allotted a portions of word throughout the church ages mary had a portion of where luther had a portion of word wesley had a portion of work but in this day we don't just got a portion of earth we got the fullness of the word what's that mean by the josh all that was in god was in the christ all that was in christ is then the bride of christ you've got the same power to say devil get out of my hole get out of my life oh remember the disciples and jesus walked by the fig tree and he cursed the fig tree and they walked right by the walk by it again and the disciples were marveled and says master the fig tree that you cursed is withered it's dead but then he didn't just keep that power with him but he says you're saying to this mountain oh you notice he didn't go to the scribes and the pharisees and give them the authority to speak to the mountain they wasn't coming under the message oh but the ones under the message oh what a peter say where will we go for thou hast the words of eternal life with that revelation brought a power brought in authority the denominations might not have the third pole in action but there's a bride here in louisiana that has the third pull in action in her life under the message of the hour oh my but you look at miriam her revelation brought stimulation how come she got so excited she grabbed her tambourine and started to dance because the message was an action for her life oh my the message is an action in our life this evening or this morning and we got a right to rejoice brother branham says that john must have seen his name in the book because he started to sing a song the book became a new book because before he didn't know if his name was there or not but then the seals came off and that book came came with a total new meaning no longer was it a sealed book and i'm guessing what it is but now it's an open book and i know what it is the bible says in revelations 5 13 and every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth such as in the sea and all that are in them hurt i say this is somebody that seemed their name in the open book heard i sing blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that set up on the throne unto the lamb forever and ever he wasn't worried about what they were thinking he wasn't worried about what they said about it he was excited because he seen his name with the revelation oh my you see if i never knew if i had never seen a reflection of myself i wouldn't know if i had blue eyes or brown eyes i wouldn't know if i blonde hair a black hair so i would just be relying on what my parents are telling me they would come up and i would ask him dad what killer eyes do i got he would say son you got brown eyes but i still don't know with the revelation i'm just taking his word for it come on somebody i can say dad what color hair do i got you got black hair but i'm just taking his word for it so somebody could come up to me and say no you don't got brown eyes you got blue eyes and i would say well my dad says i got brown eyes you catching my drift this morning i'm taking somebody else's opinion of who i am because i've never seen myself before but once i see a reflection i can go to that critic and say hey buddy i don't got blue eyes i've got brown eyes and they would say how do you know because i've seen myself in the mirror oh man without seeing yourself in the book you're just taking what the preacher says what mama says what daddy says so the devil can come and say your serpent's need and since you really don't know you're gonna believe it but once you see your name in the book you can say devil i'm not serpent seed i'm not a tribulation saint but i'm the virtuous blood washed bride of jesus christ come on somebody that's why we can rejoice that's why we can shout that's why we can place god not with an emotion but with the revelation of who i am i'm not a wannabe i'm not a castaway but i'm somebody that god has predestinated for this last day my wife didn't choose me i chose her we didn't choose god god chose us to rise in power and cast down every imagination god chose you and gave you an authority to say devil get behind me complexes get behind me anxiety get behind me and every critic that don't want me to praise get behind me hey i'm going to worship the lord this morning because i know who i am [Applause] this is the time for worship how come everybody is worshiping more even the baptists are worshiping but the bride can't worship how come the denominations are allowed to worship and they don't even know who they are and the bride knows who they are but as soon as you say glory somebody says hey be quiet we're not pentecostal who are you have you seen yourself in the book because i've seen myself in the book and i'm getting a little excited because while the tribulation's going on i'm out of here while the earth's on fire i'm out of here that's why i can't help but get excited oh my you may lose your mind in the tribulation but i'm not losing my mind you may lose your family in the tribulation but i'm not losing mine you may lose your parents in the tribulation but i'm not losing mine i know who i am and with my identity comes in authority oh my when my wife married me i don't got much of my bank account but what is in my bank account is hers so whenever i got under the headship of this message i'm no longer myself but i'm now missing jesus christ and with that identity comes in authority with that identity comes the dominion everything that's god brother branham says god will bankrupt heaven before one of his words will fall to the ground i challenge your faith this morning if you need help in your body god's willing to bankrupt heaven this morning to give you your inheritance it's the children's bread oh my what's the bible say if if i have a son would ask for bread would a father give him a stone he says if an earthly father won't do that how much more will the heavenly father not do that is somebody who knows who they are oh my look look at luke 10 and 19 behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and all the power of the enemy all the power of the enemy then he says nothing shall by any means hurt you then he stops and he says that's all great and all that's wonderful notwithstanding in this the next verse notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven how did they know their names was written because jesus just revealed it to him how do we know oh my how do we know where names is written in heaven because christ the word the message has revealed it to us and now the disciples could go on and say you know what my name's in heaven and somebody could say no it's not oh yes it is no it's not yes it is that man over there the supreme one the anointed word the anointed christ not just a christ but the christ there was many anointed men in that day but there was only one the christ that was the anointed word for that day he's the one that told me my name is in heaven he's the one that told me i'm engraved in the palm of his hand oh and this evening oh this and this last day there's the many anointed men but there was only one the anointed christ that's the message of the hour and that's the one who told you he's never going to leave you he's never going to forsake you but he'll be with you to the end of the world your name is engraved in the palm of his hand y'all started to think about that so in order for him to lose your name he's got to lose his hand and worse has power in his hands where's the man's strength in his arm so in order for him to lose your name in order for him to lose your purpose he has to lose his strength he has to lose his power come on somebody and let me give you a secret he's never going to lose his power he's never going to lose his authority so that means he's never going to lose you he's never going to lose your name for your engraved in the palm of his hand we've got something to rejoice about you know we've been commissioned to praise god revelations 19 and 5 and a voice came out of the throne out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants ye that fear him both great and small you praise god i don't care if you're great i don't care if you're small you praise god oh my how come david got a little excited when the ark of the covenant was being returned because the word had been lost the word was taken away and told you the authority of the word but how come the word was taken away how come the word was taken away because the preachers of that day started to put their ideas with the word the sons of eli were sinning they were doing away with the word and because of that the bible says that god sent a prophet to eli and says he's going to strike judgment on his house and there was going to be death on the house of eli how come because they started to mix their ideas with the words but you notice eli's tribe god had hand-picked to be the priests god had hand-picked them but it was the next generations that started to do away with the word just like wesley came with a message but the next generation started to denominate and they died the baptist the methodist they're all dead then there rose up another one with the word of god but the next generations started to denominate and so the word has been lost in creeds and in dogmas but you notice the word hasn't lost its power it just lost its power in their life what happened the philistines came into the camp of israel and started slaying all the men slang the warriors and it was the eli sons that says let us get the ark of the covenant and it will save us man they thought the word had authority they thought it had power and it did but not in their life because they took their own ideas oh we got too many message people coming to church and saying why ain't god working for me how come this message ain't working for me are you mixing your ideas with the message come on somebody are you mixing what you think is right with the message that's not gonna produce an authority but the fullness of the word the pure unadulterated word is going to produce an authority and we know what happened they got the ark of the covenant and the philistines came and destroyed them they wrote dead and they took the ark of the covenant back to their camp but the word of the lord didn't lose his authority because what happened they put it before the god dakin the next morning they got up and that god was falling down before the ark of the uh before the ark of the covenant so the word of the lord did not lose its authority it still had its power what happened they stood it back up the next morning they got out and they are the palms were cut off the head was cut off it was nothing but a stop laying there that's what the word will do when you give a full preeminence in your life [Applause] oh come on somebody that's what the word will do when you push out what you think is right and embrace what god knows is right then every devil that comes against you will be a stump his head will be cut off his hands will be cut off it will be crushed that's what the authority of the word will do in your life so what happened the rock of the lord was being returned it was time for the walk to be restored and david looked down the road and he sent me art coming he goes my this is the one i heard about this is the one i heard mama tell me stories about with moses and joshua and this one and that one i heard these stories of old but is that coming down the road what is then all of a sudden revelation kicked in this is the one i heard about not just for the ones in the past but it's for me today and he started to rejoice he started to shout because the word the authority was restored in his life and we know what happened his wife started to criticize him and what happened her womb was shut up there was no life she was barren you better watch out when you start to criticize life once you start criticizing life you may lose life come on somebody but when david knew that that wasn't death coming down the road that was life coming down the road and the shame that this morning we don't got death the denominations are in death you notice eli's tribe was still dead they were still dead but david wasn't dead he was alive because the earth was being restored to the camp of israel and in this last day the denominations are dead but the earth the word of god has been restored to the camp of the bride you can rise up in authority and say no devil i've got a power i've got an authority the possessor has been equated with me but random says you know god looked down out of heaven and said david you're a man after mine own hearts you know god looked down out of heaven and said you're a man after mine our hearts see why he done lost all of his pride lost all of us yet he was married to a king's daughter but he wasn't even considering it then he knowed that he was equated with the possessor of the heavens and earth what brought them together what acquainted him with the possessor of heavens and earth the ark of the covenant come on somebody that's why he could rejoice because he was brought back to the world to the lord because of the ark and why can we rejoice because we've been equated back with the possessor of heavens and earth because of this message [Applause] oh my and now it's being produced in our life you know the scribes and the pharisees asked for a sign and jesus said i'll give you a sign for as jonah was in the belly of the well for three days so will the son of man be in the earth for three days so whenever he died and was in the grave we know that his body had died but his spirit was alive so in order for the world to know that the spirit was alive the body had to raise up i'm preaching this morning amen because we know the spirit of the bible brother branham says that his spirit went to hell and preached the souls he went to paradise so god was alive still but the body was dead so in order to manifest his power on earth the body had to raise up so the spirit of god has been on the earth but in order for the world to know that he's on earth the body has to rise up to the occasion and say i'm going to produce the word for this thing did you notice how powerful the spirit was in the body of christ that even the ones that killed the body of christ how to realize he rose from the dead the ones that crucified him how to realize hey prophecy is being fulfilled i put this man in the grave but now he's alive because they came and they told the soldiers hey tell a fear you tell them that the disciples come and stole their body why would they say that if they didn't know he was alive even the critics know there's the god on earth the devil knows that there's a god on earth the demon knows there's a god on earth how come the body's alive the body is producing the words you notice when the body died it died with power when it rose up it came up with power the book of the first church went down with power the first bride went down with power but this last bride has rose up with the same power promote somebody the miracles ain't just for the book of acts the day the signs and wonders just for the book of acts but it's for the bride in this last day and the devil knows something supernatural is taking place how come he's fighting you and not the denominations because he knows something's going on it's out of the tomb you may have been dead in your sins but he wanted to keep you dead in your sins but this morning let me announce to the devil the stone has been rolled away the bride of christ is out of the tomb with the same power the same authority the same dominion and i say this morning devil be careful there's a powerhouse on earth that's destroying every stronghold destroying every chain destroying everything that comes against her not only is she destroying the devil but she's dancing over your head come on somebody the devil knows that he can't keep you from destroying him but what he would do was keep you hack take away your joy while destroying him now you come to church and you're like yeah come on devil let's fight i got the message of the hour and you look defeated you look dead that's why the devil wants you that way but when there's somebody that's coming to church and they're saying glory to god i'm in the house of the lord devil where are you at sickness where are you at that's harming spirit where are you at the joy of the lord is my strength i don't care what you've been telling me throughout the week you're not taking my praise away you notice too many times our praise get taken away i miss preaching this more hope this is okay paul and silas was in the biggest trial of their life but they didn't let that trial take their praise away but they left a trial magnify the power that was on the inside of their life they started praising god that authority didn't leave them in the trial oh they needed the offen they needed the trial to express the authority because as they started to praise god the prison bar started to break the wall started to fall down those bars started to break what was it they knew there was a power on the inside and that power wasn't going to be taken away because of the trial and they started to praise god and this prison was started to fall out and i challenge you this morning don't lose your praise in the trial don't lose your joy in the hard time but praise god and watch god take that circumstance and turn it for a testimony hey we like the testimonies but we don't like the test that comes to the testimony but it takes the test to give the testimony oh my i hope this is okay this morning but the brandon says when truth is revealed truth is vindicated oh my we got the truth revealed in this last day and now it's being vindicated in our lives we're no longer looking for something to come but we know it's here you look at the woman at the well she was looking for something to come she was looking for one to come and express this authority what happened jesus came directly at the well started to read her life and she stopped and she says i perceive you a prophet i perceive when the messiah comes he will do these things and he stopped and he says this is somebody that knows something's going to come she's expecting the word to be here and he stopped and he said i am he she no longer was looking for him to come she knew he was here but you notice what she said what her testimony was she ran away and said come see a man who told me all i ever done ain't this the messiah ain't this the christ so the anointed one she was waiting on she was waiting for these signs waiting for these wonders the signs and wonders she was waiting on was being manifested through her life did you catch that because she said come see a man who told me so the things we're waiting on is being revealed through me the message that we've been waiting on is here and the authority is being revealed through the bride the bible says that many of the men believed on christ because of her testimony oh my and brother branham would say but the men couldn't even be around her what made the difference the influence of christ changed her where no longer was the men the women running from her there was something that she had that they wanted oh my you want to get your family member saved give them the message and let the message come on the inside and start to influencing you they're no longer human gloom all the time no longer you in the dumps all the time but you've got something bubbling up now it's a it's a well it's a spring of living water that the world wants hey the word wants something genuine they don't want to put on they want they don't want something fake the world is looking for a living god and this message has brought a living god in our midst not just in our midst but on the inside we're producing the living god you know brother branham would say that them in the upper room the reason they got excited was because the prophecy for that day was being revealed through them that's why they came out staggering like drunk men because the prophecies for that day was being revealed through them but the brandon was saved here it is god's vindicated revelation made plain to them they was happy about it god promised it here it was revealed to them and vindicated to them amen here is a man saying they're saying this is that this is that and there it was being vindicated by the same signs their stimulation by revelation they really had it then the reason why they were so excited because the revelation kicked in that this is the day for prophecy to be fulfilled you know brother branham would say that revelation brings satisfaction so once you get sadder once you to see a revelation of this message you're no look you're no longer looking for something to come but now you're satisfied with what god has right here with us you see too many people is not satisfied with what god has given that's why they're constantly looking they're constantly looking for something more that's why that's why many many girls put on makeup [Applause] because they're not satisfied with what's been given they think they're going to change their identity oh my here we go that's why many boys think they got to fit in with the world they're not satisfied with the identity that the message has brought i'm preaching this morning they're constantly looking for something to fulfill them because their curse hasn't been satisfied but you ever get a revelation of this a message you're no longer looking for an identity but you have found an identity oh am i in order in order for you to accept another identity you got to push away your identity oh so in order for you you girls to put on pants and put on makeup and cut your hair and go out into the world you got to push away the identity that the message brought and embrace an identity that the devil wants to give you but this morning your identity and serpentine your identity is the bride of jesus christ [Applause] that was free brother branham says it brought such a positive to them that nearly every one of them sealed their testimonies talking about the 120 in the upper room silver testimony with their blood no matter what came along as long as they lived they never got over it it stayed there because it was the true word of promise vindicated the revelation become vindicated they died stealing their testimony with their own blood now look look at the promise of this last day here we see it vindicated right before us the present coming of the holy spirit and the works he was supposed to do is right among us oh my now can you hear it something is taking place i tell you friend when a true sincere predestinated believer when light strikes upon that seed something bursts forth to a new life something's taken place something is happening on the inside of the bride it's a revelation she's realizing that there's a body on earth and on that body that's proclaiming the actions of jesus christ what did what did jesus tell the john's disciples when he came they came up to him and says are we to are you the christ are we to look for one to come and he said he said go tell john what you see and what you hear the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the death are raised the dead are raised the poor have the gospel preached to them so the man or the the the vindication to john the christ was on earth was his signs was the body proclaiming that he was alive and the revelation of the vindication that god is on earth is the bride manifesting the signs but brother branham would say when the bride would get back to a word pride she will produce the very works that jesus produced that there is somebody that is the body of christ producing the same actions john 14 to 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and the works and greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father brother branham would say there's always a witness on earth there's always a body that's witnessed the power of christ so christ is saying here i'm a witness of the power of god i'm going off the scene but the power is not leaving you're not going to be my witnesses you're not going to proclaim that god is alive and well i believe god is still online in action in this last day but the brandon would say in action god in action oh i love that not some idol not some mythical thought of rubbing a statue but a real living god in action not something that was but something that is right now that's what god wants to do is take fallen humanity and whip up on the devil with him when it looks like you're defeated when it looks like the devil's got the upper hand that's when god likes to display his power oh my you know you look at the when when jesus took the little boy's lunch this was jesus the one that spoke let there be light that spoke the the creative word he could have spoke fish and bread right there to feed the thousands of people but he wanted to take a little boy who had nothing and manifest his power through oh the dead god can be here today whipping up on the devil like he did back when christ was on earth but he wants to take somebody that can't do it in themselves and reveal this power through oh my you know i know there's some sports players in here you know it drives a sports player nuts when you got the better team you know that you got the better players you got the better ball handling skills the better shooters and these little dweebs comes and beats you and you're like oh geez that just that just like that takes your man card away you're like man how did that even happen that's what's happening in this last day the devil's got the upper hand you can't beat him in your own but god is taking some nobodies that's got no ability god no power got no authority and expressing that he's the same yesterday today and forever through your life and the devil's setting they're speechless saying i've done all that i can do and i can't get them defeated that's right devil that's because the bride of christ has the power of christ through her oh let me let me tell the devil something he can try and try and try but brother branham says the first he failed but the second even is not going fall that's a prophecy that you're gonna fulfill in your life he may try to come with doubts come with skeptics cometh unbelief but there's something on the inside that's embraced the message of the hour and now it's being manifested through your life i believe god has power to hold young people i believe god's got power to keep our marriage together i believe god's got power to rise up a daddy and a mama that's not wishy washy but it's on fire with the holy ghost i believe that power is on earth we don't got to be make believers we don't got to be lukewarm christians we don't got to be formal but i believe that the bride of christ is to be on fire to be with power and demonstration and the message has brought that down so that you can manifest it oh that's why there's a group of young people when the other one's around smoking they're out and drinking they're in pornography there's some young people that's not out defiling their life because something's taken place on the inside and now we're manifesting the word but the branham says but we've done everything else besides that go ye into all the world and preach the gospel what what what's the gospel not word only but through power and demonstration of the holy ghost making the word of god manifest is the gospel oh my brother branham would say that the greatest sermon ever preached is the life being lived is the life being lived something's taken place and now you're showing the world you may not got something but i do got something how come david had confidence to come against goliath hope this is okay this morning david had a back he had a he was anointed with oil number one we know what happened the prophet came and anointed him with oil which is a type of a holy ghost so that's the type of the holy ghost but that they didn't just stop there then the prophet told him he was going to be king so now he got a message telling him what he was going to do and then that produced the produce of vindica his life started to produce a vindication of what he had the bear came against him the lion came against him but they couldn't destroy him because he was anointed with oil he had the wine he had the oil and then he had a message the toading he was the reign as king so it didn't matter what come against him his life was just vindicating the message that he got so whenever he came against goliath he wasn't afraid he was bold he was fearless how come his brothers were hiding in the caves hiding behind the rocks hiding in their tents because they didn't know if they were going to die or not they didn't know they didn't have a message come and tell them they were going to be king but david knew he couldn't die because he had something to fulfill you can't be destroyed this morning because you've got something to fulfill you've got a rapture to make you've got prophecies in this last day to make manifest oh my so when david came up against goliath he said you may got a sword you may got a shield you come in the name of a philistine but i come in the name of the lord i'm anointed with loyal i had a message tell me my future and i don't care what the present state is i know my future and whenever you know you're present or whenever you know your future the present circumstances don't bother you when you know what's going to happen tomorrow your present circumstances don't bother you but if you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow today's going to worry oh but we got a message that took us back in the back in the future before time is through the thoughts of god into the mind of god the same message brought us to present day but that message didn't just stop at present day but that message went into the future we know our future this morning that's why we don't got to be in the dumps hey i heard a story one time hope this is okay heard a story mark lowry anybody knows the comedian mark lowry oh boy that's probably a good thing but anyways he was telling a story and said it has got my attention he says i survived the tornado he says i was in a houseboat i hope i get the story right he was in a houseboat on the lake and all of a sudden the wind started to blow the turmoil started to go on his his ship was going back and forth and he was scared to death he thought he was going to die and by the time it was over he comes walking out those boats upside down it was it's a wreck and these there's some other guys down the docks that say whoa that was great we survived another one and he stopped and he's like how come y'all are so happy we just about died they're like oh you're new around here this is tornado alley he says this happens all the time and he made a statement he says if i knew i was going to survive it would have been fun for me too we know we're going to survive this last day so rejoice in the child rejoice in the hard times we're stimulated by the revelation of our future you're not going down you're going up little david's you're not going to be defeated but you're going to rise up in power and turn off goliath's head destroy the bear destroy that lion your future has been known to you you know what your future holds so the present trials don't bother me hey i was in england me and brother andrew was in england over easter and in the airport they're in birmingham i'm looking at all these screens and this one's going to egypt this one's going this way that one's going to that way like my it can get overwhelming because there's tons of screens tons of different destinations but i was only looking for one destination i didn't care who was going to egypt that wasn't for me i don't care who was going to hong kong that didn't bother me i was coming back to where i came from and since i was here before i was there there was something drawing me to come back where i came from and i was going to find a way to get back here oh my but we didn't we didn't find the way to get back to the mind of god god gave us a way to get back to where we came from the tribulation ain't concerning us it's not for me helling for me these other things ain't for me there's only one plane that's for me that's a rapture that's a body change so i don't care what this one's doing what that one's doing my future is already in concrete i'm going back to where i came from oh you notice before i was ever in england i already had a ticket back here and before we ever came from the mind of god to this present day god already gave a ticket come on somebody god already gave a ticket for you to go back [Applause] his thoughts are eternal so before the earth was ever created his thoughts were now let me tell you something his thoughts never change so whenever you was in sin you was in addictions you was in pornography his thoughts towards you never changed and i don't care what you go through his thoughts are never going to change oh you noticed david david was chased by saul but that still didn't change his future he was chased by a lion and a bear that still didn't change his future the goliath came against him but that still to change his future and let me say this what david did himself never changed his future and i don't care what you go through what you may do it's never going to change your future oh you look how you see god's so determined to make sure that your future ain't going to be messed up you notice uh samuel whenever he was going to anoint david he went up to all his other brothers he said oh this is the king this is the predestinator this is the one and god will say oh no not even the prophet can mess up his future [Applause] i don't think you caught it not even the prophet could mess up david's future and let me say our prophet tried killing himself try shooting himself trying to grab that wire but not even our prophet could mess up your future come on somebody god wanted to make sure that there was a bride with the spot with that wrinkle without any such blemish make a rapture and the only way that was to happen was for there to be a message so god got a messenger brother branham says that god got the perfect man with the perfect nature to match the perfect message for you oh my we think we think that the message is too important for us oh my i'm a young person and the message is only for the preachers only for the parents that's not true the message is for young people just like it is for the adults but not even the prophet can mess up your future and so what makes you think you can mess up your future now now many people take predestination as a crutch as a license to sin that's not what i'm talking about predestination need to push you away from god predestination draws you to god hallelujah so whenever you know whenever you know your future you know what's not your future when you know your identity you know what's not your identity so whenever the devil comes and says oh no you're not going to make a rapture you say oh no i know my future oh no i know who i am and god's not going to leave us here all by yourself he's going to make sure our future comes to pass you see i was in poland with uncle jonathan one time and our airline went on strike that's a terrible feeling whenever you're all the way across the ocean you're ready to go home it's the last day the next morning you're getting on a plane to come home and you get an alert that the airline went on strike you got no plane ticket you're stuck there that's a terrible feeling but that's not a feeling the bride's got god's not going to say oh no this is too hard i'm cancelling your ticket now he's got enough power to make sure he don't care if the devil's against you if circumstances against you trials is against you he's going to make sure that your ticket is good and valid and you're going to step into that body change one day and laugh at the devil and say devil you thought you had me but my future is greater than the present circumstances hallelujah our future is greater as the musicians come our future is greater than the than the present circumstances and i don't care what i go through devil you can't do it you can't destroy me oh my brother branham would say when the truth when the truth of a promised word of god has been truly revealed to his saints that's filled with oil they get all stimulated wine of stimulation glory i feel it right now stimulated with joy with shouts when it does it has the same effect upon them that the natural wine does because when revelation has been given has been given of a truth of god and the true believer filled with oil the revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that makes him beside himself unnormally that's why the world thinks you're crazy because the normal to them is something completely different than what god's normal is but this bride is producing god's norm amen can you just play something can you play that can't you see why i'm happy let's just bow our heads tonight this morning dear heavenly father lord we want to thank you for your for the
