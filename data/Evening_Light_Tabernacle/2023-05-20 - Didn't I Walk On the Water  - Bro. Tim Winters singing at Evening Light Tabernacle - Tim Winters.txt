foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] at how far you come and every time you've asked me didn't I deliver you why would you be thinking think that I wouldn't see you through Didn't I Walk On The Water I calm the rage and seams I spoke to the way in the house and I gave you peace didn't I run to your rescue didn't I [Music] leave all of Heaven There I died for you I searched until I found you and I'll do it all again now you're talking to the father as you kneel down on the floor Trials of this life Lord they've taken away my joy but then a voice so still and low said I moved on you before if only you'd surrender I would give you so much more Didn't I Walk on the waters I calm the Regency I spoke to the house [Music] [Music] didn't I leave all of Heaven there I died for your sins I searched until I found you and I'll do it all again I searched until I found you and I'll do it all again [Music] [Applause]
