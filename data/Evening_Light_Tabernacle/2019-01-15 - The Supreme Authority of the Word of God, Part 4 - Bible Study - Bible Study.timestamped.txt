[0:00] just ask father that you'd bless our
[0:01] efforts bless our hearts and God write
[0:04] these words upon the tables of our
[0:07] hearts make us written epistles read and
[0:09] known of all man
[0:10] we love you and we thank you we ask that
[0:12] you bless our efforts now in Jesus
[0:15] Christ's name we pray amen amen
[0:19] well it's really really good to see
[0:21] everybody it's been several months and
[0:25] it just went like this over the holidays
[0:27] but I've been real encouraged by all the
[0:30] support and so forth everybody's
[0:32] excitement about Bible studies I I kind
[0:36] of came into the ministry with Bible
[0:38] studies and someday I'll tell my
[0:40] testimony of how how I came to the Lord
[0:43] and how a revival started and it it
[0:47] that's how I came into the ministry but
[0:49] it we started with Bible studies and it
[0:51] just grew and it went for four years and
[0:54] about 40 souls were brought to the Lord
[0:57] and some churches ended up being birthed
[0:59] out of it over time and so I love Bible
[1:03] studies and I trust that maybe being in
[1:06] the Bible and so forth and taking these
[1:08] things scripture by scripture precept
[1:10] upon precept line upon line will be a
[1:13] help to everybody as well and I was
[1:16] talking to brother Tim last night and
[1:18] our last evening and brother Tim said
[1:21] that he as he and I talked that it would
[1:24] be a good idea that if you've got family
[1:29] members or coworkers or friends that
[1:32] show interest in the Bible then welcome
[1:36] them to come on Tuesday nights just
[1:39] bring them with you I'll be very very
[1:41] careful and and when I say careful we're
[1:44] not ashamed of the message but we do
[1:45] understand that we have terminology that
[1:48] people would not understand or
[1:50] revelation that people would not
[1:52] understand
[1:53] and so my hungers for souls and if we
[1:58] get new people in I'll be very careful
[2:00] to base everything from the Bible
[2:03] because the message is the Bible
[2:05] revealed that's what the message is
[2:06] there's nothing there's no fear in that
[2:09] challenge at all everything than all
[2:12] revelation of the message
[2:13] comes back to the scriptures and so they
[2:17] don't understand maybe what a prophet is
[2:19] that a prophet has visited this
[2:20] generation and and so forth but I'll be
[2:24] very careful to make things
[2:26] understandable and then if you see light
[2:29] breaking then what will happen is we'll
[2:31] work with them one-on-one and then
[2:33] answer personal questions that are on
[2:35] their heart maybe Bible questions that
[2:37] are on their heart and I've seen the
[2:39] gospel it goes from person to person it
[2:42] just keeps like a chain reaction it'll
[2:44] go from this one to this one to this one
[2:45] and it's exciting so brother Tim said
[2:49] let's open up the Bible studies once
[2:51] again if they show interest co-workers
[2:55] family members rank sinners if they show
[2:57] interest bring him on we just don't know
[3:00] what's laying there and I think it would
[3:02] be good little outreach for us all and
[3:04] so I was really encouraged by that I'm I
[3:09] got a subject on my heart tonight if you
[3:13] just want to take your Bibles we the
[3:16] first Bible study that we did was on the
[3:18] Godhead and I had a real good response
[3:22] to that everyone's really interested in
[3:24] the Godhead and I'm sure more questions
[3:26] will continue to unfold as time goes but
[3:29] it'll get clearer and clearer then we
[3:32] went into a Bible study as the supreme
[3:35] authority of the word of God part one
[3:37] the supreme authority of the word of God
[3:40] part two the supreme authority of the
[3:42] word of God part three we're doing the
[3:45] supreme authority of the word of God
[3:46] part four tonight and more likely we'll
[3:49] do five next week and we've covered the
[3:53] absolute we've covered searching the
[3:55] scriptures and and those things but
[3:58] tonight we're gonna get into one of the
[4:01] most important parts of this subject and
[4:04] next week as well so every part is
[4:07] important but I think that our hearts
[4:10] are going to be blessed this evening so
[4:12] if we'll just turn to Matthew chapter 16
[4:16] and we'll start with verse 13 and if
[4:23] you're not too uncomfortable we'll
[4:25] probably have further David have a mic
[4:27] and
[4:27] we're gonna have some participation here
[4:33] Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 when Jesus
[4:40] came into the coasts of Caesarea
[4:42] Philippi he asked his disciples saying
[4:45] who do men say that I the Son of Man am
[4:49] and they said some say thou art John the
[4:54] Baptist some Elijah and others Jeremiah
[4:57] or one of the prophets and he said unto
[5:01] them but who do you say that I am and
[5:04] Simon Peter answered and said thou art
[5:07] the Christ the Son of the Living God and
[5:10] jesus answered and said unto Him blessed
[5:13] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[5:17] blood has not revealed it unto thee but
[5:19] my father which is in heaven and I say
[5:23] also unto thee that thou art Peter which
[5:25] means little rock or stone and upon this
[5:29] rock I'll build my church and the gates
[5:33] of Hell shall not prevail against it
[5:37] this scripture is very familiar to us
[5:40] brother Branham took this scripture and
[5:42] it became actually one of the key
[5:44] emphasis of his entire message and it's
[5:48] actually something that you don't hear
[5:50] out in the denominational world you
[5:52] don't hear it among Christianity but
[5:55] brother Branham labored upon this
[5:57] scripture and I believe that our hearts
[5:59] gonna be blessed by it the Word of God
[6:01] should be a part of every Christians
[6:03] life as Jesus said man shall not live by
[6:06] bread alone but by every word that
[6:08] proceeds out of the mouth of God brother
[6:11] Branham said we should study the Bible
[6:13] every day he said just like we would eat
[6:16] every day if we didn't eat we would grow
[6:18] weaker we'd get shaky dating later we'll
[6:22] get weaker brother Branham said the word
[6:24] is the bread for our souls and
[6:27] spiritually we'll grow weaker if we
[6:29] don't feed upon the Word of God every
[6:30] day brother random said study the word
[6:33] every day
[6:34] which is amazing he said some people
[6:36] pick up the Bible once a year he said
[6:39] but we should study the Bible every day
[6:42] and I think what he meant by that is we
[6:44] don't read it like a newspaper but we
[6:46] ought to pray and be sincere if we read
[6:48] a chapter we ought to really pour
[6:50] ourselves over that chapter and just say
[6:53] Lord show me what you're speaking of
[6:55] please reveal it to me give me something
[6:57] that will help me today and brother
[6:59] Branham said I never want to get tied
[7:01] down he was speaking with jobs and so
[7:04] forth he said that I can't study the
[7:06] Scriptures that was remarkable to me
[7:09] because the Bible said seek ye first the
[7:12] kingdom and the rest is added he said I
[7:14] never want to get tied down but what I
[7:16] can't study the Bible and I think that
[7:19] would it be good for all of us whether
[7:21] we're busy in our work busy with our
[7:23] school busy as a housewife with kids
[7:27] none of us are too busy but what we
[7:29] can't pick up the Bible and feed upon
[7:32] the Bible on us on any given day can you
[7:35] say men so we want to make sure we give
[7:38] God first place and brother Branham said
[7:41] you know he said how many you study the
[7:44] Word of God he said you go to a house
[7:47] and you search the scriptures he said
[7:50] the elect in their day they studied the
[7:53] day that they were living how many noes
[7:55] were living in the last days if there
[7:57] and there's false prophets there's false
[7:59] teaching even within the framework of
[8:01] this message if there's ever a time that
[8:03] we need to know whom we have believed
[8:05] not what we believe but whom we believe
[8:08] if there's ever a time that we ought to
[8:11] know what we need what we believe by the
[8:14] message and by the Word of God it is now
[8:16] and so we want to make sure that our
[8:18] Bibles are nice and worn isn't that
[8:21] right and we want to cultivate our love
[8:26] for the scriptures turn with me if you
[8:27] would to Psalms 112 we'll just start out
[8:31] with a few scriptures and to start kind
[8:34] of digging in here Psalms 112 and we'll
[8:39] read verse 1
[8:43] you got it okay why don't we start here
[8:48] go ahead and read verses one through
[8:50] three his seed shall be mighty upon the
[9:00] earth the generation of the upright
[9:03] shall be blessed wealth and riches shall
[9:06] be in his house and his righteousness
[9:09] endures forever
[9:11] blessed is the man that fears the Lord
[9:13] and delighteth greatly in his
[9:14] Commandments we cultivate a love for the
[9:18] scriptures it's an attitude we cultivate
[9:21] it's it's our attitudes toward the Word
[9:24] of God it's just like if we came to
[9:26] church with a bad attitude chances are
[9:28] we're not gonna get anything out of it
[9:29] or if you have a bad attitude towards
[9:31] your wife chances are you're gonna have
[9:33] a bad day you know so it's all about our
[9:36] attitude and what we look at the Word of
[9:39] God as if we look at it just as just a
[9:42] book or just a something that we got to
[9:44] do we'll never get anything out of it
[9:46] but notice the the psalmist attitude he
[9:50] said he said he delights greatly in the
[9:53] commandments how many have a love for
[9:54] the Word of God that there's they could
[9:56] be ever so down but they come to church
[9:58] and they hear the word of God and your
[10:00] heart just starts beating for it or just
[10:03] something about the word it does
[10:04] something to us let's turn to 1:19
[10:07] Psalms 119 verse 47 and 48
[10:24] verses 47 and 48 and I will delight
[10:29] myself in that commandments which I have
[10:31] loved my hands also while I lift up unto
[10:34] my unto thy commandments which I have
[10:36] loved and I will meditate in thy
[10:38] statutes ain't that wonderful I've loved
[10:43] his word God put a love in our hearts
[10:46] tonight for the word of God amen the
[10:49] word deserves first place 165 turn to
[10:52] verse 165 of 119 chapter 119 verse 165
[11:10] great peace have they which love thy law
[11:13] and nothing shall offend them
[11:16] wonderful wonderful go to verse 1 of 119
[11:20] and I'll let you read 1 through 6
[11:30] blessed are the undefiled in the way who
[11:33] walk in the law of the Lord blessed are
[11:35] they that keep his testimonies and that
[11:38] seek him with a whole with the whole
[11:40] heart they also do no iniquity they walk
[11:43] in his ways thou has commanded us to
[11:46] keep thy precepts diligently oh that my
[11:49] ways were directed to keep thy statutes
[11:52] then shall I not be ashamed when I have
[11:55] respect unto all thy Commandments amen I
[11:58] have respect unto all thy Commandments
[12:00] and we could we could spend a long time
[12:04] on respect towards God's Word but our
[12:07] attitude towards the word is everything
[12:10] brother Branham I'll read you a quote
[12:12] brother Branham said may I stop here
[12:15] just a moment and say this and it'll go
[12:17] on record because the recorders are
[12:19] going that any divine promise in the
[12:22] word of God if you take the right mental
[12:24] attitude toward any of God's divine
[12:28] promises it'll bring it to pass
[12:29] regardless of what it is if God promised
[12:33] it and you show the right
[12:34] mental attitude God will fulfill his
[12:37] promise to you that promise is good to
[12:40] anyone that will look at it in that
[12:43] respect so here he's saying I respect
[12:46] your word and I don't think the Word of
[12:48] God is something that any of us should
[12:51] ever joke about because we devalue the
[12:53] word like that brother Branham Moyes had
[12:55] the people stand at the reading of the
[12:57] word because he was showing respect to
[13:00] it as God in letter form and brother
[13:03] Branham had a great reverence for the
[13:05] words he regarded it as life and it's
[13:09] only life to those that regarded his
[13:11] life I want to read this to you too it
[13:14] was remarkable to me brother Branham
[13:16] said now remember this dear Christian
[13:19] friend I wouldn't stand here deceive her
[13:21] I'd rather he said be up in the
[13:23] mountains he said but you've got to know
[13:26] what truth is like a man just handed me
[13:30] a book a while ago and he said and when
[13:34] I took that book I laid it down on top
[13:37] of the Word of God and the angel of the
[13:39] Lord stood right there by my side and
[13:41] said you take that off of there
[13:43] it is not right he didn't want the book
[13:47] was air and the angel did not want that
[13:50] book associated with the Word of God and
[13:52] he said he said now we will meet at
[13:56] judgement and know that the angel the
[13:58] Lord stood right there by my chair a few
[14:00] minutes ago brother Neville's office
[14:02] there and made me take the thing away
[14:04] from his word because it's not right he
[14:07] said that's right he said that's all I
[14:09] knowed about it the Holy Spirit knew it
[14:11] wasn't right see he said here is God's
[14:14] Word outside of this our faith is built
[14:18] right here ain't that remarkable the
[14:22] angel the Lord told brother man take
[14:23] that thing away from the Bible
[14:25] whoo god help us to cherish it and to
[14:30] respect it and to love it so we can get
[14:32] every divine promise we'll be ours if we
[14:35] can approach God with the right attitude
[14:37] oh this one is awesome Psalms 119 verse
[14:41] 161 where's the mic who has the mic okay
[14:46] would you pass it over there
[14:49] 161 Prince's have persecuted me without
[14:55] a calls but my heart stands in all of
[14:58] your word in other words I have high
[15:00] regard for your word Lord a holy
[15:03] reverence for the Word of God and then
[15:06] he says I will rejoice at thy word as
[15:08] one that finds great spoil or great
[15:11] treasures ain't that wonderful the word
[15:14] we stand in all at the word brother
[15:16] Branham said now he said when we come to
[15:20] service were sincere he said and God
[15:22] will bless the word because we know that
[15:25] God's Word will not return void that the
[15:28] word is not the words of a man in the
[15:30] words of God
[15:31] let's turn if you would to st. John 666
[15:45] and this is where Jesus was saying
[15:48] except to eat my flesh and drink my
[15:50] blood you have no life in you so on and
[15:52] so forth and sister where were you read
[15:55] 66 through 69 from that time many of his
[16:03] disciples went back and walked no more
[16:06] with him
[16:07] then said Jesus to the twelve will you
[16:10] also go away then Simon Peter answered
[16:12] him Lord to whom shall we go you have
[16:15] the words of eternal life and we believe
[16:18] and are sure that you are that Christ
[16:20] the Son of the Living God amen now
[16:23] notice Peter says only you have the
[16:25] words of eternal life so the word is
[16:30] life to those that regarded his life now
[16:33] here was the word made flesh in front of
[16:35] them and they did not understand except
[16:37] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[16:39] have no life in you but it didn't matter
[16:41] because the Bible said in verse 69 we
[16:44] believe and we are sure we are sure
[16:48] you're the Messiah we are sure you're
[16:50] the Word made flesh and it was he said
[16:53] only you have the words of life this
[16:56] word is not just a doctrine it is God in
[17:00] letter four
[17:01] it is life to us that regarded is life
[17:03] that's why we're here
[17:05] amen this is why we love it this is why
[17:08] we reverence it now notice that I love
[17:11] this scripture Acts chapter 5 verse 17
[17:22] Acts chapter 5 verse 17 for the Micra
[17:26] jury seventeen through twenty then the
[17:30] high priest rose up in all they that
[17:32] were with him which is the sect of the
[17:34] Sadducees and were filled with
[17:36] indignation and laid their hands on the
[17:38] Apostles and put them in the common
[17:40] prison but the angel of the Lord by
[17:43] night opened the prison doors and
[17:44] brought them forth and said go stand and
[17:47] speak in the temple to the people all of
[17:49] the words of this life gay man you see
[17:53] taught that the angel released Peter and
[17:56] he said he said you go out there and you
[17:59] preach to the people all the words of
[18:01] this life and Boyd was life followed
[18:04] just the chapter before his shadow was
[18:06] raised and sick people up signs and
[18:10] wonders were done by the apostles they
[18:12] were packing the gospel of life the Word
[18:14] of Life it wasn't just embodied in
[18:17] Christ but it actually went over on the
[18:20] day of Pentecost right in to the
[18:22] believer since the itself turn with me
[18:25] if you would to Acts chapter 11 verse 12
[18:29] if you want to go ahead and pass that
[18:30] mic down and this is when Peter same 1
[18:37] Peter goes to Cornelius house and he's
[18:42] given witness and in Acts chapter 11 but
[18:44] if you'll start in verse 12 through 14
[18:46] and the spirit bade me go with them
[18:50] nothing doubting moreover these six
[18:53] brother and accompanied me and we
[18:55] entered into the man's house and he
[18:58] showed us how he had been an angel in
[19:00] his house who stood and said before him
[19:03] send men to Joppa and call for Simon
[19:07] whose surname is Peter
[19:10] verse 8:14 who shall tell these tell the
[19:14] words but which thou and all thy house
[19:17] shall be saved
[19:19] verse 15 and as I begin to speak the
[19:23] Holy Spirit fell on them as on us in the
[19:27] beginning he shall tell you the words
[19:31] whereby you and your house will be saved
[19:34] and as he's speaking the Holy Ghost
[19:36] falls on them that belief if you read
[19:40] Peters sermon it's not rocket science it
[19:45] was simply the gospel just in its purest
[19:48] form but while he was speaking the
[19:50] Gentiles received eternal life they
[19:53] receive salvation they receive
[19:55] forgiveness of sins how many believe
[19:58] that this word is life how many believe
[20:00] this message is life absolutely right
[20:03] and if we regard it in that way and
[20:05] respect it in that way then it will
[20:07] bring life to us as well do you love the
[20:10] Lord that's why Jesus said if you're
[20:13] just writing it down in John 5:24 he
[20:16] said verily verily I say unto thee he he
[20:18] that heareth my word and believeth on
[20:21] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[20:24] and he won't come into condemnation but
[20:26] he's passed from death unto life brother
[20:29] Branham said in the church age book that
[20:31] every true revival that has ever
[20:33] happened in history is because men came
[20:36] to the Word of God he said in every age
[20:41] man fell because he fell from the Word
[20:44] of God he said but in every revival
[20:47] anyone that ever came was because men
[20:49] got back to the Word of God and it
[20:52] brought forth signs and wonders and
[20:54] healing and salvation to whole nations
[20:56] all at once because this word is life
[21:00] it's all about the attitude towards it
[21:03] notice this in John chapter 6 verse 63
[21:15] verse 63 it is the spirit that
[21:20] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[21:22] the words that I speak unto you they are
[21:25] spirit in their life they men wonderful
[21:28] what is life the word living in you the
[21:32] word living in me if you will turn with
[21:35] me to to Genesis 111 now death cannot
[21:48] come by the word only life can come by
[21:52] the word death only comes when we are
[21:56] hybrid it when we mix it with man's
[21:59] ideas that's why the Bible tells us
[22:01] anyone adds one word or takes one word
[22:03] will lose his part from the book of life
[22:06] so we lose life by adding or taking away
[22:09] from the word but death cannot come by
[22:13] the word because the word is spirit and
[22:15] the word is life so in the in Genesis
[22:18] 111 he said let the earth bring forth
[22:22] grass and herb yielding seed and fruit
[22:25] tree yielding fruit after his kind whose
[22:28] seed is in itself and in the beginning
[22:31] God spoke his word and he created every
[22:36] tree and every fruit and every vegetable
[22:38] and what that means is he said every
[22:41] thing that God spoke whether it was a
[22:44] pumpkin would reproduce another pumpkin
[22:47] and another pumpkin or or a tomato or
[22:50] whatever it was every one of God's words
[22:53] that was original had life in it and had
[22:57] the power to reproduce itself isn't that
[23:00] right because God's Word is eternal and
[23:03] if it was good for a day going by it's
[23:05] good for today but every word of God has
[23:09] the power of creation behind it every
[23:12] promise of the Bible has the same power
[23:15] of creation as what God spoke in the
[23:17] beginning because God's eternal purpose
[23:20] is behind his word how many knows that
[23:23] that God has a
[23:25] his will for your life he has a purpose
[23:28] for our life and it's found in the word
[23:30] of life now every genuine seed must
[23:35] bring forth of its kind that's God's
[23:37] command but you have to watch because
[23:42] jesus said the word is the seed that the
[23:46] sower sowed your heart is a field and
[23:49] you've got to watch what is planted in
[23:52] your heart because if you take a false
[23:55] doctrine into your harder to bring forth
[23:57] death
[23:57] if you take the Word of God into your
[23:59] heart it will bring forth life
[24:01] ain't that right and brother Branham
[24:03] said now there was a sowing that took
[24:06] place in the 40s and 50s he said Oral
[24:08] Roberts Billy Graham and he said and the
[24:11] word has been sown he said now the Word
[24:14] of God that has been sown which is the
[24:16] message of the hour he said God is going
[24:18] to live in his people God is going to
[24:21] live in his church he said but there's
[24:24] also been denominational seeds that have
[24:26] planted he said that it's going to
[24:28] produce the World Council of Churches
[24:29] then he said you be careful what you
[24:32] allow in your heart and I'll say the
[24:36] same for the message there's a lot of
[24:39] things that surround the message that is
[24:41] not even remotely close to what brother
[24:44] Branham preached see this message is the
[24:47] perfect interpretation with divine
[24:49] vindication it is God this message was
[24:53] sent to restore hearts we don't need an
[24:55] interpretation of the message what we
[24:57] need to do is believe the message
[24:58] receive the message and become the Word
[25:01] made flesh can you say Ben now there
[25:04] were four kinds of ground in the Bible
[25:06] there was stony ground and there was
[25:08] thorny ground and there was the wayside
[25:11] and there was good ground nothing is
[25:14] wrong with the seed nothing say nothing
[25:18] nothing is wrong with the message only
[25:21] the ground that it's sowed in and so the
[25:25] incorruptible Word of God could fall in
[25:28] many different places and never have an
[25:30] effect but with the right heart and the
[25:33] right atmosphere and the right idea it
[25:35] can come right in and man
[25:37] fest itself and bring forth healing and
[25:39] bringing forth victory and it can
[25:40] reproduce itself how many to say Lord
[25:43] let me have a right atmosphere amen so
[25:47] we want the seat and good ground brother
[25:51] branham said when the rain falls that
[25:52] are bringing forth the crop but it's got
[25:54] to have the right kind of environment
[25:56] the right kind of atmosphere and it's an
[25:59] atmosphere faith every one of us got to
[26:02] create an atmosphere of faith brother
[26:04] Branham preached a message called wisdom
[26:07] versus faith and he said there are two
[26:10] different kinds of atmospheres in this
[26:12] world he said there's only two sources
[26:15] there's wisdom and there's faith and he
[26:20] said now if you follow those atmospheres
[26:23] he said you'll find out did you ever go
[26:27] to a church where the pastor is real
[26:29] starchy
[26:30] he said the congregation will be the
[26:32] same way he said it's an atmosphere that
[26:35] brought it he said but if you ever
[26:38] he said if you it they might not believe
[26:40] in divine healing and so on and so forth
[26:43] he said but if you go to a church where
[26:45] faith is taught there will be an
[26:47] atmosphere in that church and you'll be
[26:50] seeing healings take place automatically
[26:52] you'll just be seeing supernatural
[26:55] things automatically because preaching
[26:58] brings an atmosphere and brother Branham
[27:01] said now preaching the word creates an
[27:05] atmosphere one church will live and one
[27:09] church will die just by the atmosphere
[27:13] where the word is falling Wow so it
[27:17] isn't just the preacher that's preaching
[27:19] it's the it's the ground that it's
[27:22] falling on and that's why I'm preaching
[27:26] us tonight is because it's important not
[27:29] just the letter of the word but that we
[27:31] have an atmosphere in our own lives in
[27:34] our own homes in our own churches an
[27:36] atmosphere where God can deal with us
[27:39] they were teachable that were humble
[27:43] that we're ready and expecting to
[27:45] receive how many to say Lord start right
[27:48] now
[27:49] let me have an atmosphere because I want
[27:52] the word to have an effect brother
[27:54] Branham said the word of life cannot
[27:57] grow in an atmosphere of wisdom Wow the
[28:03] it's contrary to God God does not grow
[28:05] in an atmosphere of intellectualism and
[28:09] it just don't happen he said that it
[28:12] must be an atmosphere faith now there
[28:16] remember when brother Branham and I'll
[28:19] be getting to the heart of what I'm
[28:20] going so just bear with me brother
[28:22] Branham preaches when he when he opens
[28:24] up the revelation series he preaches
[28:28] that when God is speaking to the church
[28:30] he's speaking to two churches he said
[28:34] now we have thought previously that when
[28:36] God spoke to the church he was only
[28:38] sleep speaking to the ecclesia or the
[28:41] elected body or Bride of Christ he said
[28:45] that is not so he said in the book of
[28:48] Revelation God is condemning one group
[28:51] and he's praising another group he said
[28:55] these are two churches that he's
[28:57] speaking to which is Church natural or
[29:00] Church carnal and then he called the
[29:03] other church spiritual or the elected or
[29:06] the bride you'll find brother Branham
[29:08] said all the way from the beginning to
[29:10] end there has been two vines there was
[29:14] Cain and Abel Esau and Jacob Isaac and
[29:18] Ishmael Judas and Jesus a weed in a tear
[29:23] a and a virgin all the way through
[29:25] the Bible we see two churches and the
[29:27] book of Revelation shows that there is a
[29:30] of Revelations and a virgin bride
[29:32] and so brother Branham says now he's
[29:35] looking at this he said God why would
[29:38] God call the false church that a church
[29:43] and he said because the false church is
[29:46] claiming that they are Christians that
[29:50] they are believers of the word he said
[29:53] just as Islam or a Muslim would actually
[29:57] follow the teachings of Muhammad so does
[30:00] Christians follow the teaching of
[30:02] Christian
[30:03] he said the difference is one is nominal
[30:07] one is spirit-filled he said that's the
[30:12] difference between the false church and
[30:14] the true Church that one is nominal and
[30:18] one is spiritual anybody with me this
[30:24] isn't this is incredible because if we
[30:26] want to be a part of the true church
[30:28] then we want to make sure that we're in
[30:30] the in the second category Bible says
[30:33] ever learning but never coming to the
[30:37] knowledge of the truth studying their
[30:40] Bible memorizing the quotes ever
[30:43] learning but never know God that's
[30:47] shaking ever learning never coming
[30:52] brother Branham said a form of godliness
[30:54] if you're writing it down second Timothy
[30:57] chapter 3 1 through 9 we won't turn
[30:59] there but he says having a form of
[31:02] godliness but denying the power thereof
[31:05] from such turn away because the letter
[31:09] killeth but the Spirit gives life
[31:14] without the spirit we're a lost hope
[31:17] without the Spirit of God to quicken
[31:20] this word to life were wasting our time
[31:22] and I'm gonna read a quote that brother
[31:26] Tim was laboring on this weekend he said
[31:29] the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[31:31] today is just the same as it was back in
[31:34] the days of our Lord it is receiving the
[31:38] word of truth for the day that you live
[31:41] jesus never stressed the importance of
[31:44] works as he did the word he knew that if
[31:48] the people got the word that the works
[31:50] are going to follow
[31:51] he said now he knew the way the
[31:54] originally man got away from God
[31:57] was by leaving the word and when you
[31:59] leave the word you leave God he said
[32:03] thus he is presenting Jesus as
[32:05] presenting himself to the Church of
[32:07] Pergamos
[32:08] and indeed to all the churches that I am
[32:12] the word and if you want deity in your
[32:15] midst welcome
[32:17] and receive the word he meant how many
[32:20] went deity in their midst and then he
[32:22] said if we want deity then we welcome
[32:25] that word into our midst
[32:27] don't ever let anyone or anything get
[32:30] between you and that word he said this
[32:34] is what I'm giving you the word a
[32:36] revelation of myself I am the word
[32:39] remember that and he says now we are he
[32:44] said I'm sorry there it is
[32:46] Jesus again is the word then this word
[32:51] he is left behind on the printed page is
[32:54] a part of him when you accept it by
[32:58] faith into a spirit-filled life because
[33:02] he said the word is life I am the truth
[33:05] the life on the way there it is his
[33:09] spirit he is life that's what the word
[33:13] is he is the word so when a spirit born
[33:17] spirit filled man in faith takes the
[33:20] word into his heart places and upon his
[33:22] lips it's the same as deity speaking and
[33:25] every mountain has got to go and Satan
[33:28] cannot stand before that man who amen
[33:33] and he said right today when the church
[33:36] returns to the word in faith we can say
[33:39] without a doubt that the glory of God
[33:41] and the wonderful acts of God will be
[33:43] right in our midst again ain't that
[33:46] wonderful there is a church natural and
[33:49] there is a church spiritual and this is
[33:52] why I come out of this scripture upon
[33:54] this rock I'll build my church and the
[33:57] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[34:00] it because the church is not built of a
[34:03] just a steeple and I was in Bruges and
[34:06] I've seen the Catholic steeples you feel
[34:09] like like the Catholic Church could just
[34:11] stomp you into a greasy spot I mean you
[34:14] feel so little and I believe that they
[34:16] intended it that way is to create these
[34:19] massive beautiful buildings so big to
[34:22] make you feel we can squash you if you
[34:24] resist us but you know that ain't a
[34:27] church at all that's a morgue God's
[34:29] church is his
[34:31] it's not mortar it's not brick it's not
[34:34] steeples it's not it's not you know
[34:37] superficial but God's churches his
[34:40] people and he said he said who do men
[34:43] say that I am
[34:44] some say the Prophet some say Elijah
[34:47] some say this or that he said but who do
[34:49] you say that I am brother Branham said
[34:51] this was an ignorant and unlearned man
[34:53] that he could not even write while the
[34:56] priest looked at him and called him a
[34:58] devil and people looked at him and just
[34:59] saw him as nothing
[35:01] somehow this unlearned man with a greasy
[35:04] fish apron looked at the Ministry of
[35:07] Jesus Christ and no sinner and Jesus
[35:09] said who do you say he said that the
[35:13] Christ the Son of the Living God who
[35:15] that moved Jesus he said flesh and blood
[35:19] has not revealed this to you there's no
[35:21] school there's no preacher there's no
[35:23] tract flesh and blood has not done it
[35:25] they're not responsible for it but my
[35:27] father and haven't revealed this to you
[35:29] Peter and upon this rock of Revelation
[35:32] I'll build my church and no devil in
[35:34] Hell can take it from my people amen
[35:38] because it's revealed personally to
[35:41] Peter and salvation was never meant to
[35:45] come in a group in a church but it was
[35:49] to come to individuals that had the
[35:51] revelation of the word for their day
[35:54] ain't that beautiful brother Brennan
[35:57] said built upon spiritual revelation
[36:00] spiritual revelation of the Lord Jesus
[36:02] Christ when God has made him known to
[36:05] you as a person as a savior as a
[36:08] redeemer as a healer as a king upon this
[36:12] rock I'll build my church that you got
[36:15] to know in yourself it's not good enough
[36:18] to be around message ranks it's not good
[36:21] enough
[36:21] to have the kind of pastor that we have
[36:24] but you've got to know him for yourself
[36:26] and you can know him for yourself they
[36:30] did wonderful I want to talk tonight on
[36:35] the rock of Revelation because this is
[36:38] what made brother Brent a major Don no
[36:39] matter how much we know the scriptures
[36:42] men that men could actually memorize the
[36:45] Bible men in prison do it they memorized
[36:48] every verse of the Bible and can quote
[36:50] any verse in the Bible and can and not
[36:53] even see serpent seed and look at the
[36:57] message and reject it altogether it has
[36:59] much more than the letter of the word
[37:02] but it's actually the revelation of the
[37:05] word that this message intended to get
[37:08] to the people and revelation only comes
[37:12] from God and that's the only place we
[37:13] can get it can you say men brother
[37:17] Brennan said now and you're familiar
[37:19] with this but I wanted to drive home
[37:22] rather Venom said the importance of
[37:24] revelation by the spirit to a true
[37:26] believer can never be overemphasized
[37:30] revelation means more than perhaps you
[37:33] realize and I'm not talking about the
[37:36] book of Revelation and you I'm talking
[37:38] about all revelation it is tremendously
[37:41] important to the church he said and then
[37:46] he goes through upon this rock I'll
[37:48] build my church and he said the church
[37:51] is built upon thus saith the Lord and he
[37:55] said how did Abel know how to offer the
[37:58] proper sacrifice and he goes all the way
[38:01] back to Cain and Abel and he begins to
[38:04] show revelation from the very beginning
[38:06] to worshipers both coming to an altar
[38:10] both offering worship to God one was
[38:12] received and one was rejected one was
[38:15] vindicated and one was marked by the
[38:17] Beast we could take a lot of time on
[38:20] that but the difference between the true
[38:23] and the false is the revelation of the
[38:26] word it's not the word it is the
[38:29] revelation of the word that makes the
[38:32] difference between the two turn with me
[38:36] if you would to first Corinthians
[38:37] chapter 12
[38:47] first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 3
[38:59] wherefore I give you to understand that
[39:03] no man speaking by the Spirit of God
[39:07] call us Jesus accursed and that no man
[39:11] can say that jesus is the lord but by
[39:13] the holy ghost amen the Bible said no
[39:18] man can say Jesus is Lord
[39:21] but by the Holy Ghost now you could
[39:25] brother branham use this example you
[39:27] could pull a drunk off the street you
[39:28] say you believe Jesus is Lord oh yeah
[39:31] yeah
[39:33] he said that ain't what he's talking
[39:34] about but to to declare that that he's
[39:38] your Savior and to declare that Jesus is
[39:43] Lord takes the Holy Spirit to do it this
[39:47] is the separating factor between
[39:48] denominations and the message brother
[39:51] Branham said I didn't come to build a
[39:53] new nomination I wish I would have had
[39:55] put the quote down he said I did not
[39:57] come to build a denomination he said I
[40:00] come to build individuals as power
[40:02] houses into the stature of a perfect man
[40:05] what was the stature of a perfect man
[40:08] the dwelling place of Almighty God
[40:10] brother Branham came to take individuals
[40:13] and set them apart so God could fill
[40:17] them and use them in his kingdom
[40:18] we are there's only one church by God's
[40:22] grace when I went up to New Hampshire to
[40:24] drive that truck back from a
[40:26] mother-in-law I got into a truck a fella
[40:29] picked me up at the car place and we
[40:31] were going to pick up the truck and it
[40:33] was a it wasn't five minutes and we were
[40:35] in religious discussion and this fella
[40:38] was studied and we were just going back
[40:40] and forth back and forth and and I I
[40:42] really liked him and he was talking
[40:46] about churches and all of his discontent
[40:48] and I said there's only one church
[40:49] according to the Bible and he kind of
[40:52] looked at me I said Jesus only spoke of
[40:55] one redeemed Church
[40:57] I said there's 40,000 denominations I
[40:59] said that's the work of man not the work
[41:02] of God and he smiled and he started
[41:04] opening his spirit to me and he and he
[41:07] was discontent you can see why people
[41:09] are so confused I mean you're saying
[41:12] that you know the Baptist's are ride or
[41:14] the Methodists to ride or the
[41:15] Pentecostals are right or the Catholics
[41:17] are right or the armature right which
[41:18] Amish the Mennonites old order which one
[41:20] I mean it just goes and goes and goes it
[41:24] would give you a headache God ain't
[41:26] interested in it at all God has one
[41:29] church from one people and the only way
[41:31] to be a part of that church is not to
[41:34] embrace the doctrine but to be baptized
[41:37] into the body of Christ and be baptized
[41:39] be born again which brother Brenham said
[41:42] it's the same thing to be born again is
[41:44] to be baptized by the Spirit he did
[41:47] right and only then when you have a
[41:49] spiritual revelation of Christ as your
[41:52] Savior how many been saved for 20 years
[41:55] here raise your hand go ahead race it
[41:58] residence sister Linda I want you to
[42:02] think back of where you were and your
[42:05] life that you lived before you receive
[42:09] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[42:11] think about where he brought you from
[42:13] and the drastic change how it changed
[42:16] the projectory of your life all together
[42:19] we thank God I thank God I can raise my
[42:22] children under this endtime message but
[42:25] every one of our children need baptized
[42:27] with the Holy Spirit and this message
[42:30] was sent to bring us into an intimate
[42:32] relationship with God Almighty that we
[42:35] could have communion one-on-one with him
[42:37] ain't that wonderful not to embrace a
[42:40] doctrine thank God for the doctrine and
[42:42] that's what we're doing here in these
[42:43] Bible studies is teaching the doctrine
[42:45] but we want the revelation of Jesus
[42:47] Christ to be in our midst breaking these
[42:50] things to our hearts can you say men now
[42:54] the Holy Spirit is the author of this
[42:56] word the Bible said the scriptures was
[42:58] written by men moved by the Holy Spirit
[43:01] they wrote it by the inspiration of the
[43:04] Holy Spirit so if the Holy Spirit wrote
[43:06] the word the Holy Spirit is the only one
[43:08] that can interpret the word
[43:10] and the Bible tells us that it's not of
[43:13] any private interpretation men have
[43:15] tried to do it but brother Branham said
[43:17] the Bible is written in mysteries and
[43:20] only the knowledge of God can reveal it
[43:22] to us beautiful and the Holy Spirit
[43:26] remember no man in heaven or earth could
[43:30] even look at the book there was not a
[43:33] man worthy in heaven and earth even John
[43:35] wept and John was in the inner circle
[43:37] John wet John was not nobody only the
[43:41] lamb could open that book only the Holy
[43:44] Spirit only God Himself can reveal the
[43:46] book to us hey man as individuals do you
[43:49] believe that brother Branham said this
[43:52] an indictment he said you're guilty with
[43:55] wicked hands you've took the prints of
[43:57] life the word of life and crucified it
[43:59] to the people
[44:00] now what did they do they didn't know it
[44:03] today people walk ignorant Lee they
[44:06] don't know that it's the truth they
[44:08] think it's an ism speaking of the
[44:10] message they don't dig deep enough to
[44:14] get into the spirit of Revelation they
[44:19] don't pray enough they don't call on God
[44:22] enough they just say oh well I believe
[44:25] there's a god devil believes the same
[44:27] thing devil believes more than some
[44:30] people that claim to believe he trembles
[44:33] people just believe it and go but the
[44:35] devil trembles knowing that judgment is
[44:37] coming and the people believe it and
[44:40] don't pay attention to the judgment
[44:42] that's coming he said guilty of
[44:44] crucifying I indict the generation he
[44:48] said and find them guilty by the same
[44:50] word that found them guilty at the
[44:52] beginning amen
[44:56] Wow he said the people good people don't
[45:02] dig deep enough in the spirit of
[45:04] Revelation they looked at the message
[45:08] and they just it's another ISM just shut
[45:11] the computer and then brother Brennan
[45:14] said I'm in dining the world for it
[45:16] they did the same thing to Jesus they
[45:18] looked right at it said no pastor said
[45:20] it was false
[45:22] and did not dig into the spirit of
[45:24] revelation didn't pray did not consider
[45:26] and will answer for it so this word is
[45:32] not to be handled superficially it
[45:34] should be everything to us can you say
[45:37] men season now you recall I mentioned at
[45:42] the beginning of the message the book
[45:44] that we're studying is actually the
[45:46] revelation of Jesus himself in the
[45:48] church and this work in the future ages
[45:50] then I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[45:53] Ghost the Holy Spirit to give us
[45:56] revelation or we fail to get it bringing
[46:00] these two thoughts together that you'll
[46:02] see that it won't just take an ordinary
[46:04] study of thinking to make the book real
[46:08] it's going to take the operation of the
[46:10] Holy Ghost it means the book can't be
[46:13] revealed to anyone but a special class
[46:15] of people it'll take one with prophetic
[46:19] insight it'll require the ability to
[46:21] hear from God it'll require supernatural
[46:24] instruction not just a student comparing
[46:27] verse by verse though that's good but a
[46:30] mystery requires the teaching of those
[46:33] of the Spirit in order for it to become
[46:36] clear he said how we need to hear from
[46:39] God and lay ourselves open and become
[46:42] yielded to the spirit to hear amen amen
[46:49] so we want to approach the message
[46:50] spiritually we want to pray and say Lord
[46:53] how many understand what Calvary done
[46:56] for us you know I I appreciate it
[47:00] just recently I think within the last
[47:03] two weeks I am the same as you I
[47:06] appreciate what Calvary done for us but
[47:08] I said Lord give me a revelation of
[47:10] Calvary like I've never seen it before
[47:12] in all of the deep mysteries of God
[47:15] brother branham never got away from
[47:17] Calvary never because we depend on it
[47:21] it was Calvary that we were saved every
[47:24] man on earth was saved at Calvary every
[47:27] man on earth was healed at Calvary it's
[47:29] a finished work and that and
[47:33] we were included in redemption there at
[47:36] Calvary how many said Lord give me a
[47:38] clear view vision of Calvary and that's
[47:41] only one place and we thank God but we
[47:44] don't want it to stay intellectual we
[47:45] wanted to become a divine revelation and
[47:48] that's the Godhead how many appreciate
[47:51] the Godhead but you know that's
[47:53] something that we say Lord I want a
[47:55] clear revelation of the Godhead
[47:57] I want a revelation to the scripts are
[47:59] being my absolute I want a revelation
[48:01] the message of the hour there's so much
[48:03] rather random said we ought to pray for
[48:05] revelation more than anything else and I
[48:10] know that's shaking to us all because
[48:12] how many times do we not pray for
[48:14] revelation and I'm not trying to condemn
[48:17] but I'm saying that that God is inviting
[48:20] us into a revelation of the word like
[48:24] we've never had before
[48:26] can you say man turn with me if you
[48:32] would John 16 verse 12
[48:45] John 16
[48:48] let's read 12 through 15 verses yeah 12
[49:00] through 15 I have yet many things to say
[49:12] and to you but you cannot bear them now
[49:14] howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has
[49:17] come he will guide you into all truth
[49:18] for he shall not speak of himself but
[49:21] whatsoever he shall hear that she that
[49:23] shall he speak and will show you things
[49:26] to come he shall glorify me for he shall
[49:29] receive of minds and shall show it unto
[49:31] you all things that the father hath um
[49:34] hath I'm on there first that I that he
[49:38] shall take of mine and shall shout unto
[49:40] you
[49:41] amen so Jesus said in his own words that
[49:44] the Holy Spirit would actually bring
[49:46] revelation to the church that the holy
[49:48] s--t the operation of the Holy Spirit is
[49:50] what would bring truth to the people and
[49:54] it was not just called truth but the
[49:56] Spirit of Truth and that that's what the
[49:58] Holy Spirit would do after he left turn
[50:02] with me if you would to Galatians
[50:04] chapter 1 verse 11 Galatians 1 verse 11
[50:19] and we'll read 11 and 12 but I certify
[50:23] you brethren that the gospel which was
[50:25] preached to me is not after man for I
[50:27] neither received it of man neither was I
[50:29] taught it but by the revelation of Jesus
[50:31] Christ this is years after Pentecost and
[50:35] Paul who was a messenger to the church
[50:37] age never went to Peter to figure out
[50:40] now what did the Lord say about this and
[50:41] what did he teach how long is the skirts
[50:43] supposed to be and what did he say about
[50:44] hair he never went to Peter but he
[50:48] actually went to Arabia and brother
[50:49] Branham said there is where he searched
[50:51] his experience with the word and God
[50:54] began to reveal
[50:55] himself to Paul and brother Brennan said
[50:57] years later when he met Peter
[50:59] he said they saw eye-to-eye on doctrine
[51:02] that only the Holy Spirit can make a man
[51:07] see eye to eye and doctrine but notice
[51:10] this it was the revelation of Jesus
[51:12] Christ and if you watch the gates of
[51:15] Hell was against Paul he was shipwrecked
[51:19] he was beat three times he was stoned he
[51:22] was persecuted by his own man his own
[51:25] his own countrymen rather and he said I
[51:28] am persuaded high third death famine
[51:32] nakedness cold whatever nothing will
[51:35] separate me from the love that is in
[51:36] Christ the gates of hell was against it
[51:39] but it never moved him he said none of
[51:42] these things move me see he had a
[51:45] revelation of Jesus Christ he had a
[51:46] revelation of the message for the hour
[51:48] listen what brother Branham said here in
[51:51] the power of God he said Moses write
[51:53] down he said when he was born they tried
[51:56] to kill all the children they were
[51:58] trying to cut off God's servant God's
[52:00] chosen vessel he said how they done the
[52:04] same thing to Abel the righteous seed
[52:06] how Seth took his place and over there
[52:10] in the Chronicles and the book of
[52:12] Matthew how they killed all the children
[52:14] the devil was trying to stop the program
[52:16] of God he said but they'll never stop it
[52:19] they'll never do it God's church will go
[52:22] on assures the world they tried they fed
[52:25] him to lions they burned him at the
[52:26] stake God's church moved on just the
[52:28] same the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[52:31] against it he said they'll be against it
[52:34] but it'll never prevail they tried to
[52:36] stop it they tried to burn it out they
[52:38] tried to feed him the lions say they
[52:40] said they tried a lot of things to stop
[52:42] out this old-time religion but it'll
[52:44] keep going till Jesus come there's no
[52:46] stopping it any man they'd that
[52:49] wonderful brother RAM said when the
[52:52] church disbeliefs Satan and believes the
[52:55] revelation of the word the gates of Hell
[52:57] will not prevail against her see they
[53:01] ain't just believing the word it's
[53:02] disbelieving the devil he ever fought
[53:05] him yeah we all do come in your mind
[53:08] you're
[53:09] seed you're just a mental believer you
[53:11] don't have a chance you know but when
[53:13] you disbelieve him and take God's Word
[53:15] into your heart the gates of Hell will
[53:17] not move you amen how many want that
[53:21] kind of stand Luke chapter 10 verse 21
[53:29] Luke 10 who do we have okay let's read
[53:42] 21 down through 24 in that hour Jesus
[53:45] rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee
[53:48] O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[53:50] thou has hid these things from the wise
[53:52] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[53:53] babes even so father for so it seemed
[53:56] good in thy sight all things so
[54:00] delivered to me of my father
[54:01] and no man knoweth who the son is but
[54:03] the father and who the father is but the
[54:06] Son and he to whom the son will reveal
[54:08] him and he turned him unto his disciples
[54:11] and said privately blessed are the eyes
[54:15] which see the things that you see for I
[54:19] tell you that many prophets and Kings
[54:21] have desired to see those things which
[54:23] ye see and have not seen them and to
[54:25] hear those things which he hear and have
[54:27] not heard that
[54:27] amen amen so if the world had had
[54:32] created a political system to burn every
[54:35] Bible in the world and to shut the
[54:38] gospel down off the internet and to do
[54:41] like they did North Korea try to keep
[54:43] the gospel from getting to the people it
[54:47] would never stop the gospel because God
[54:51] reveals himself to individuals just like
[54:54] he did Abraham brother Branham said
[54:56] Abraham was a root worshipper worship
[54:59] and roots and he said and God came and
[55:01] appeared to him one day and this is this
[55:04] is not about a church or a doctrine it's
[55:07] all about you and Jesus Christ and
[55:09] fulfilling the word for your day ain't
[55:12] that wonderful that you could have a
[55:13] personal relationship with him because
[55:16] he said no man knows the father and whom
[55:19] the son will reveal him
[55:21] how many say Lord I want a full
[55:22] revelation Amen brother branham said the
[55:26] way up is down that we got to humble
[55:27] ourselves in order to receive I want to
[55:30] read this to you
[55:32] he said now he said the book of
[55:37] Revelation shows the Antichrist Spirit
[55:40] would come into the church and defile it
[55:42] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[55:45] and he said it exposes Satan reveals
[55:49] this works and the attempted destruction
[55:52] on God's people and the discrediting of
[55:54] his word he fights it he cannot stand it
[55:58] because he knows if the people get a
[56:01] true revelation of the true church and
[56:03] what she stands for and what she is and
[56:08] that she can do the greater work she'll
[56:10] be an invincible army if they get a true
[56:13] revelation of the two spirits within the
[56:15] framework of the Christian Church and by
[56:18] God's Spirit discern it and withstand
[56:20] the Antichrist spirit Satan will be
[56:23] powerless before and he will be
[56:25] authoritative a as when Christ was stood
[56:29] as every effort to gain power over him
[56:30] in the desert Satan hates revelation but
[56:35] we love it we're the true revelation in
[56:39] our lives the gates of Hell cannot
[56:41] prevail against us but we will prevail
[56:44] over them we love revelation
[56:46] I love the Word of God I love to see
[56:51] every revelation go from Genesis to
[56:53] revelations I love the Godhead
[56:55] I love serpent seed you know I'd talk to
[56:59] I talked to sinners off the streets and
[57:01] show them serpent seed by the Bible
[57:03] there's no problems it's normally with
[57:05] church folk that can't see it but
[57:08] normally a sinner right off the street
[57:10] they'll look and go well it's right
[57:12] there I mean I said I've had them do it
[57:16] they're like it's right there I say
[57:18] you're right it's right there but
[57:20] they've not been indoctrinated to keep
[57:22] them from seeing it you know there's
[57:25] nothing to prove and and so I mean with
[57:28] that with the sinner you know there's
[57:30] not Masood we love it I don't care what
[57:32] it is Lord corrected me by
[57:34] the word I want to be right I want to
[57:36] see it right how many want to see it
[57:38] right you know it don't quit I mean I've
[57:41] been serving the Lord almost 21 years
[57:43] and I can't I always find something
[57:45] where I was wrong and I want to be
[57:48] correct and so so it's good to be
[57:50] teachable it's good to be corrected as
[57:53] many as I love I taste it and rebuke as
[57:55] long as we keep ourselves humble where
[57:58] God can deal with us amen
[58:01] now here here let's turn to Deuteronomy
[58:04] chapter 32 so upon this rock I'll build
[58:09] my church and I just love the message
[58:12] because brother branham brings the
[58:13] symbol of rock out and how God hides
[58:17] himself in symbols and so on and so
[58:19] forth and I want to look at this just
[58:21] for a minute
[58:27] Deuteronomy 31
[58:29] I'm sorry 32 1 through 4 this is the
[58:32] song of Moses if you go ahead and read
[58:40] chapter 32 1 through 4 give you give ear
[58:48] o ye heavens and I will speak and hear o
[58:52] earth the words of my mouth my doctrine
[58:55] shall drop as the ring my speech shall
[58:57] to still does the do as the small rain
[59:01] upon the tender herb and as the showers
[59:04] upon the grass because I will publish
[59:06] the name of the Lord
[59:07] ascribe a greatness unto you our God
[59:12] first of all he is the rock his work is
[59:17] perfect for all his ways or judgment a
[59:20] God of truth and without iniquity just
[59:24] and right is he amen he's describing to
[59:27] the greatness of God and he refers to
[59:30] God as his rock now this is a song of
[59:34] Moses and this is the first time that
[59:36] God is described as a rock and without
[59:41] the message you just would never see
[59:43] what we see in this
[59:45] now we know that God revealed himself in
[59:47] Iraq in the days of Moses when the
[59:50] people were in a desert place Horeb
[59:52] which him in a dry place
[59:53] they were thirsting for water and they
[59:55] were getting angry and Moses went to God
[59:58] and said Lord what do I do
[59:59] and he said smite the rock and it'll
[1:00:03] give forth his waters so he took the
[1:00:05] judgment rod the same Rob that he
[1:00:07] brought judgment upon Egypt with he
[1:00:10] should have smited the people because
[1:00:12] the people were murmuring but instead of
[1:00:14] smiting the people he smote the rock and
[1:00:17] when he smote the rock it began to give
[1:00:19] water and saved a perishing people
[1:00:22] brother Branham said that was a direct
[1:00:24] type of the rock of our Lord Jesus
[1:00:26] Christ when God could have smote us
[1:00:28] because of sin instead of smiting us he
[1:00:31] smoked Christ and Christ gave forth his
[1:00:35] waters on the day of Pentecost and it
[1:00:37] brought forth life to a perishing people
[1:00:40] amen amen
[1:00:42] so we see God was revealing himself in
[1:00:44] Iraq and it was a type of Calvary's
[1:00:48] fountain and the Bible said that rock
[1:00:51] was Christ and that rock followed them
[1:00:54] all through the wilderness so Moses was
[1:00:56] singing about a rock but that rock
[1:01:00] represents revelation now watch this
[1:01:03] turn with me if you would to Psalms 18
[1:01:07] verse 1 Psalms 18 verse 1 through 3 give
[1:01:16] brother Tony I will love the Lord my
[1:01:19] strength the Lord is my rock and my
[1:01:21] fortress and my deliverer my God my
[1:01:24] strength in whom I will trust my buckler
[1:01:27] and the horn of my salvation and my high
[1:01:30] tower I will call upon the Lord who is
[1:01:33] worthy to be praised so shall I be saved
[1:01:36] from all mine enemies amen
[1:01:39] now here's David now referring to God as
[1:01:42] a rock and he says the Lord is my rock
[1:01:47] now now he's making it personal and
[1:01:49] brother branham says this in Shalom 1964
[1:01:53] god is my rock he said how many knows
[1:01:56] what a rock represents in the by
[1:01:57] a rock in the Bible represents the
[1:02:00] revelation of God he said God is my
[1:02:03] revelation the revelation of the word is
[1:02:06] the rock he said now David is speaking
[1:02:09] God as our rock got us my rock and he
[1:02:13] said when God has been revealed he
[1:02:17] becomes a rock all right there now I'm
[1:02:21] getting into the heart of where I want
[1:02:23] to go see we need revelation in our
[1:02:25] lives but when we get revelation then
[1:02:29] you become unmovable and that's what
[1:02:31] rock stands for unmovable unchangable
[1:02:35] unshakable amen and when you have a
[1:02:38] revelation then that revelation from God
[1:02:41] becomes your rock amen how wonderful
[1:02:47] brother Branham said this he said that's
[1:02:50] what the church needs is not so much
[1:02:53] study in theology but get down to the
[1:02:56] altar till we pray and have an
[1:02:58] experience that burns into the human
[1:03:00] heart burns out all the dullness and get
[1:03:04] a new vision he said that's the way the
[1:03:07] Holy Spirit come on the Apostle such as
[1:03:09] I have give IV if anything the church
[1:03:12] needs tonight he said is to bring a
[1:03:15] fresh vision from the presence of God
[1:03:18] and let the people see that God still
[1:03:20] lives he's still in his church and
[1:03:22] Christ is returning what a revelation
[1:03:25] how many knows that we're in the second
[1:03:28] coming of Christ if you have a
[1:03:30] revelation of that then we're not
[1:03:32] ashamed the Bible said my people shall
[1:03:34] never be ashamed if we really have a
[1:03:37] revelation of the Godhead we're not
[1:03:39] afraid to stand in front of Trinitarian
[1:03:40] and say our God is one because you have
[1:03:44] a revelation from God if you have a
[1:03:46] revelation that this message was sent
[1:03:48] from God
[1:03:49] there's not a machine gun that can take
[1:03:51] it away from you there's not a lion's
[1:03:54] den' there's not a fiery furnace
[1:03:55] they had a revelation in that revelation
[1:03:58] became the rock man is unstable
[1:04:01] I can feel one way one day and feel a
[1:04:04] different way than the next I mean you
[1:04:07] young people going to college
[1:04:09] to be a rocket scientist next day I'll
[1:04:13] be unemployed how do we just have ups
[1:04:17] and downs I mean we you it can change
[1:04:20] from one day to the next because man is
[1:04:22] unstable but God is stable we need a
[1:04:25] rock we need something that we can
[1:04:28] anchor to that will hold us in our
[1:04:31] position can you say man now watch this
[1:04:36] this this is wonderful turn with me to
[1:04:40] Psalms 31
[1:04:48] Psalms 31 verse 1 and we'll read 1
[1:04:53] through 3 now remember these are the
[1:04:56] Psalms of David and in the times that
[1:04:59] David had wrote these Psalms
[1:05:01] Saul was chastening and God had told
[1:05:05] David that he would be the king of
[1:05:07] Israel from the time that he was
[1:05:09] anointed king to the time he became King
[1:05:12] was about 10 years of hellish agony do
[1:05:16] you think he needed a rock in that time
[1:05:18] do you think sometimes the devil get in
[1:05:21] his head when he's living in the caves
[1:05:22] of the earth and he's running for his
[1:05:24] life you think sometimes he might have
[1:05:26] doubted what happened or questioned what
[1:05:29] happened he needed a rock that he could
[1:05:32] hold to in a time of trial and these
[1:05:34] Psalms is where we pick up the
[1:05:36] revelation of God he needed a revelation
[1:05:38] I know whom I have believed I know that
[1:05:42] God's Word will not return void
[1:05:44] go ahead says in the Oh Lord do I put my
[1:05:48] trust let me never be ashamed deliver me
[1:05:51] in thy righteousness bow down thine ear
[1:05:54] to me deliver me speedily be thou my
[1:05:57] strong rock for an house of defense to
[1:06:00] save me a man for thou art my rock and
[1:06:03] my fortress man therefore thine name's
[1:06:05] sake lead me and guide me hey man how
[1:06:08] many can say Lord be my rock the world's
[1:06:11] falling apart be my rock be my fortress
[1:06:13] that's what David was saying the Lord is
[1:06:15] my rock
[1:06:15] he is my protection he's my strong place
[1:06:18] go with me 26262
[1:06:23] verse 1 and 2

[1:06:37] Lord from him come with my salvation he
[1:06:39] is my rock and my salvation he is my
[1:06:41] defense i shall not be greatly moved a
[1:06:44] man a man it gives you it gives you
[1:06:47] somewhere to stand even in the trials
[1:06:50] and you're stripped when you have
[1:06:52] nothing left there's a rock that you're
[1:06:55] holding - that's the revelation that God
[1:06:58] gives ain't that beautiful
[1:07:00] next next psalm 71 we'll read 1 through
[1:07:08] 5 India Lord put my trust let me never
[1:07:16] be put to confucian delivering deliver
[1:07:21] me in thy righteousness and cause me to
[1:07:23] escape incline thine ear unto me and
[1:07:27] save me be thou my strong habitation we
[1:07:31] run - I'm a continually resort thou hast
[1:07:34] given commandment to save me for thou
[1:07:36] art my rock and fortress deliver me oh
[1:07:39] my god out of the hand of the wicked out
[1:07:41] of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel
[1:07:43] man for thou thou art my hope Oh Lord
[1:07:47] God thou art my trust from my youth amen
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:52] he didn't run to xbox he didn't run to
[1:07:54] any other comfort he ran to the word his
[1:07:57] revelation and that's where he found
[1:07:59] peace and stability amen
[1:08:02] Psalms 69 verse 1 save me O God for the
[1:08:12] waters are come in unto my soul and read
[1:08:17] verse 2 I think in deep mire where there
[1:08:21] is no standing I own come unto deep
[1:08:23] waters where the floods overflow me so
[1:08:26] here David is saying where there is no
[1:08:29] standing I can't touch the bottom floods
[1:08:32] are coming in and I can't reach the
[1:08:34] bottom now go to chapter 40 verse 1
[1:08:40] I waited patiently for the Lord and he
[1:08:50] inclined unto me and heard my cry
[1:08:53] through 43 I'm sorry for it through
[1:08:55] verse 3 he brought me up also out of it
[1:08:58] and horrible pit out of the miry clay
[1:09:01] and set my feet upon a rock and
[1:09:03] established my goings a man and he has
[1:09:06] put a new song in my mouth even praise
[1:09:08] into our God many shall see it and fear
[1:09:11] in shall trusted no less the Lord he
[1:09:14] took me out of the miry clay and he sent
[1:09:16] me on a rock he put something under my
[1:09:20] feet he gave me something to live for
[1:09:21] something to die for us something
[1:09:23] something standing something solid ain't
[1:09:27] that beautiful see that was the same
[1:09:30] rock that rock is the same rock that
[1:09:33] Abraham found that Isaac and Jacob found
[1:09:37] that Moses found it's the same rock
[1:09:40] tonight and that's that's Christ brother
[1:09:44] branham said that Moses when he was
[1:09:46] dying he said he looked off into the
[1:09:48] Promised Land and he said he waved to
[1:09:50] Israel and he said and all of a sudden
[1:09:53] he disappeared and he said that Satan
[1:09:56] argued with Michael the Archangel over
[1:09:58] the body of Moses and he said O God let
[1:10:02] me die on the same rock that Moses died
[1:10:05] on brother Branham quoted up a song that
[1:10:08] they used to sing he said if I could I
[1:10:11] surely would stand on the rock where
[1:10:13] Moses stood he said oh that's the rock I
[1:10:16] want to stand on to by faith I want to
[1:10:18] stand there that's the rock of
[1:10:21] Revelation the revelation of God made
[1:10:23] known to you ain't that beautiful that
[1:10:26] is your strength that is your shelter
[1:10:29] you'll like this one
[1:10:31] Isaiah 26 I love this one
[1:10:42] Isaiah 26 verse 3 and for God will keep
[1:10:51] him in perfect peace whose mind is
[1:10:53] stayed on thee because he trusted in
[1:10:55] thee trust ye in the Lord forever for in
[1:10:59] the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength
[1:11:01] in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting
[1:11:03] strength does anyone have a margin
[1:11:05] reading on there does anybody have in
[1:11:08] their margins what does it was it say
[1:11:11] say it again so that's exactly correct
[1:11:16] it says trust in the Lord forever for in
[1:11:20] the Lord Jehovah is the rock of ages'
[1:11:23] that's where that comes from and so God
[1:11:27] is declaring himself as the rock of
[1:11:29] ages' because brother Branham said your
[1:11:32] faith must have a resting place it must
[1:11:36] have a place where you're fake because
[1:11:38] you're gonna move but you gotta have
[1:11:40] something that will hold you still an
[1:11:43] anchor of the soul and that anchor of
[1:11:46] the soul is not in a doctrine or not in
[1:11:49] a church that changes or bodies of
[1:11:51] people that evolve but it is in
[1:11:53] something that is unchanging unmovable
[1:11:55] it is the Rock of Ages ain't that
[1:11:59] wonderful eternal unmovable turn with me
[1:12:03] to Isaiah 32 verse 1 behold a king shall
[1:12:14] reign and righteousness and princes
[1:12:16] shall rule in judgment verse 2 and a man
[1:12:19] shall be as in a hiding place from the
[1:12:22] wind and a culvert from the tempest as
[1:12:26] rivers of water in a dry place as the
[1:12:29] shadow of a great rock in a weary land
[1:12:31] how many knows Jesus is this rock and
[1:12:34] the weary land and how many knows this
[1:12:36] is prophecy brother Branham said the
[1:12:39] weary land he's speaking of he's right
[1:12:43] where we're at in this world that we
[1:12:46] live in right now the end time
[1:12:48] conditions it is the weary land he said
[1:12:51] but Jesus is the rock in our weary land
[1:12:54] he said he's our rest
[1:12:56] he said all these denominations but yet
[1:13:00] Christ is our shelter in the time of a
[1:13:03] storm you know he's our cleft in the
[1:13:05] rock brother branham said you never want
[1:13:09] to answer to God for your wrong
[1:13:12] you don't want God's justice none of us
[1:13:15] want God's justice
[1:13:17] you know just our thoughts alone would
[1:13:20] be enough to pay for let alone our
[1:13:22] actions we would not want to stand
[1:13:26] before God naked without blood and many
[1:13:29] people will go to the judgment brother
[1:13:31] made him scream
[1:13:32] he actually said cut me open he said
[1:13:35] pour hot sulfur in me but don't let me
[1:13:38] go to the white throne judgment he said
[1:13:41] tear me apart by inches but don't let me
[1:13:45] go to the white throne judgment that's
[1:13:48] the kind of descriptions that he made
[1:13:50] but let me tell you you don't have to
[1:13:52] because we have a rock in the weary land
[1:13:54] and brother Branham said there is a
[1:13:56] cleft in the rock that hides his people
[1:13:59] and so that's what we want tonight is we
[1:14:02] want that cleft in the rock brother
[1:14:05] Branham said now Isaiah described him as
[1:14:07] a rock and a weary land that's this land
[1:14:11] a weary land a weary time he said
[1:14:14] there's no escape get up and go away
[1:14:17] from it
[1:14:17] he said go down and confess your sins
[1:14:21] believe on the Lord Jesus be buried with
[1:14:23] him in Baptism rise in his resurrection
[1:14:25] with the Holy Spirit it lifts you above
[1:14:28] the cares and worries of unbelief in
[1:14:30] this world and the name of the Lord is a
[1:14:32] strong tower that we run into and are
[1:14:35] safe and he said what do we run into
[1:14:37] he said we run into his word the rock
[1:14:40] the revelation of the hour the message
[1:14:43] of the hour how many believe that that
[1:14:45] it's actually a protection from the
[1:14:47] judgments upon the earth turneth if you
[1:14:50] would psalm 61 verse 1
[1:15:01] hear my cry oh God attend unto my prayer
[1:15:05] from the end of the earth will I cry
[1:15:07] unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed
[1:15:09] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[1:15:11] I for thou husband a shelter for me and
[1:15:14] a strong tower from the enemy I will
[1:15:17] ballad in that temple in that Tabernacle
[1:15:19] forever I would trust in the covert of
[1:15:22] thy wings Sayla a man all of us has had
[1:15:26] a time where we just think dear Lord I'm
[1:15:29] I just can't describe to anybody what
[1:15:32] I'm feeling on the inside the burden
[1:15:34] that I'm carrying you know every one of
[1:15:37] us you know we work out our own
[1:15:39] salvation with fear and trembling there
[1:15:41] sometimes we become overwhelmed a lot
[1:15:43] like David in the Psalms like Lord you
[1:15:46] know what will I do I want to see my
[1:15:48] momma saved my family saved my whatever
[1:15:50] it may be but you know the scripture
[1:15:54] said that from the end of the earth he
[1:15:55] cried and he said when my heart is
[1:15:58] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[1:16:00] higher than I Amen lead me right to the
[1:16:04] revelation that I need Lord we need him
[1:16:07] we need the Spirit of God it's more than
[1:16:09] doctrine god help us psalms 125 verse 1
[1:16:29] they that trust in the Lord shall be as
[1:16:32] Mount Zion which cannot be removed but
[1:16:34] abide as forever hmm
[1:16:35] verse 2 as the mountains are round about
[1:16:38] Jerusalem so the Lord is round about his
[1:16:41] people from henceforth even forever how
[1:16:44] many believe it
[1:16:45] glory how is it that there's a church so
[1:16:49] unmovable there founded on the rock amen
[1:16:53] turn with me to John first John chapter
[1:16:59] 2 15 through 17
[1:17:21] love not the world neither the things
[1:17:23] that are in the world
[1:17:24] If any man love the world the love of
[1:17:26] the father is not in him
[1:17:28] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:17:31] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[1:17:33] the pride of life is not of the Father
[1:17:35] but is of the world and the world
[1:17:37] passeth away in the lust thereof but he
[1:17:40] that doeth the will of God abideth
[1:17:42] forever amen that's pretty solid Matthew
[1:17:47] 7:24
[1:18:02] we'll read 24 through 27 therefore
[1:18:13] whosoever hears these sayings of mine
[1:18:14] and doeth them I will like him liken him
[1:18:17] unto a wise man which built his house
[1:18:19] upon a rock and the rain descended and
[1:18:22] the floods came and the winds blew and
[1:18:24] beat upon that house and it fell not for
[1:18:26] it was founded upon a rock and every one
[1:18:29] that heareth these sayings of mine and
[1:18:30] doeth them not shall be likened unto a
[1:18:33] foolish man which built his house upon
[1:18:35] the sand and the rain descended and the
[1:18:37] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[1:18:39] upon that house and it fell and great
[1:18:41] was the fall of it a man great was the
[1:18:44] fall of it would be a many a church's
[1:18:47] fall many a ministries fall many
[1:18:50] personal people fall because they were
[1:18:53] not built upon the Word of God upon
[1:18:56] divine revelation of the word I really
[1:19:00] really like this one turn to job chapter
[1:19:01] 39
[1:19:16] 39 verse 27 through 30 29 2013 ein
[1:19:37] chapter 39 27 through 30 death Diego
[1:19:43] mount up that command at that command
[1:19:46] and make her nest don't have she
[1:19:50] dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon
[1:19:55] the Kreg of the rock in the strong place
[1:19:59] from thence she seeketh to pray and her
[1:20:02] eyes behold afar off her young ones also
[1:20:07] soak up blood and wear the slain or
[1:20:11] there she is
[1:20:12] Amanda where the Eagles dwell on the
[1:20:17] rock I above the devil far above all the
[1:20:21] hurts of the earth
[1:20:22] ain't that wonderful I like verse 28
[1:20:30] that word crag is where my name come
[1:20:33] from that one's free everybody loved the
[1:20:42] Lord John chapter 3 verse 1
[1:20:55] John chapter 3 will read 1 through 7
[1:21:03] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[1:21:07] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews this the
[1:21:12] same came to Jesus by by night and said
[1:21:15] unto them unto Him rabbi we know that
[1:21:18] thou art a teacher come from God for no
[1:21:22] man can do these miracles that thou does
[1:21:26] except God be with him jesus answered
[1:21:29] and said unto Him verily verily I say
[1:21:32] unto thee except a man be born again he
[1:21:35] cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:21:37] Nicodemus said unto Him how can i how
[1:21:42] can a man be born when he is old can he
[1:21:47] enter the second time into his mother's
[1:21:49] womb and be born jesus answered verily
[1:21:52] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[1:21:56] born of water of the spirit he cannot
[1:21:59] enter into the kingdom of God that which
[1:22:03] is born of the flesh is flesh and the
[1:22:06] and that which is born of the Spirit is
[1:22:08] spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee
[1:22:11] you must be born again amen thank you
[1:22:15] that word CE means understand he says
[1:22:19] first except a man be born again he
[1:22:21] cannot see the kingdom and then in verse
[1:22:25] 5 he says except he's born again he
[1:22:26] cannot enter into the kingdom and that
[1:22:29] word CE means understand and brother
[1:22:32] branham said in order for us to
[1:22:33] understand the kingdom of God then God
[1:22:36] has to come into us to reveal it because
[1:22:39] it's all by divine revelation and
[1:22:41] brother Branham quoted this I want to
[1:22:44] read this to you out of the church ages
[1:22:46] he said he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:22:48] what the Spirit says under the churches
[1:22:51] he said it's evident from the scriptures
[1:22:54] that no man of himself can can hear God
[1:22:58] that the ability has to be given him of
[1:23:02] God
[1:23:03] that in other words the carnal mind is
[1:23:06] enmity with God our thoughts our ways
[1:23:08] are not his ways our thinking is not his
[1:23:11] thinking and every one of us here if we
[1:23:14] studied the Scriptures or any given
[1:23:16] verse we would all have a different idea
[1:23:19] of what the verse meant and the only one
[1:23:22] that could tell us what it meant was him
[1:23:25] that wrote it does that make sense
[1:23:27] and so God has to come on the inside to
[1:23:30] give us understanding no man can see the
[1:23:32] kingdom except he's born again and
[1:23:35] brother Branham continues and he says
[1:23:39] that all of God's children will be
[1:23:42] taught of him he said the evidence is
[1:23:45] hearing what the Spirit says the Spirit
[1:23:49] is talking the Spirit is teaching and
[1:23:52] Jesus said he would do it when he came
[1:23:54] he will teach you all things and bring
[1:23:57] these things to your remembrance he told
[1:24:00] us that the evidence or what would
[1:24:03] happen after being baptized with the
[1:24:05] Holy Ghost that we that the teacher
[1:24:08] would come and teach us truth and that
[1:24:11] teacher was an inside teacher not an
[1:24:13] outside teacher if the spirit wasn't
[1:24:16] inside you you wouldn't hear the truth
[1:24:19] and receive it by revelation if you
[1:24:21] heard it every moment of the day see
[1:24:25] that is the sign of the indwelling of
[1:24:28] the Spirit in the days of Paul those who
[1:24:31] were filled with the Holy Ghost heard
[1:24:32] the word received it and lifted those
[1:24:36] who did not have the spirit heard it his
[1:24:38] only carnal man and put the wrong
[1:24:42] interpretation into it and went into sin
[1:24:45] in every age it is the age of the Holy
[1:24:50] Spirit to the believer in every age the
[1:24:53] evidence is the same those who have the
[1:24:56] spirit the teacher heard the word took
[1:24:59] the word and taught it the spirit
[1:25:02] revealed it to them and they were the
[1:25:05] group that heard the messenger for the
[1:25:06] Aged took it and lived it that ought to
[1:25:09] make you shout
[1:25:11] because you're able to see the things
[1:25:13] that you see and understand the things
[1:25:15] that you understand turn with me if you
[1:25:18] would revelations chapter 3 verse 15
[1:25:34] and let's read 15 through 20
[1:25:38] you've got the I know I know that works
[1:25:45] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[1:25:48] would thou wert cold or hot so then
[1:25:53] because thou art lukewarm neither cold
[1:25:56] nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:25:59] because thou hast I'm rich and increased
[1:26:04] with Goods and have need of nothing and
[1:26:06] knowest not that thou wretched and
[1:26:09] miserable and poor and blind and naked I
[1:26:14] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:26:18] the fire that thou must be rich and
[1:26:21] white raiment that thou mayst be clothed
[1:26:24] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:26:28] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:26:30] eyesalve that thou may us see as many as
[1:26:35] I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous
[1:26:38] therefore and repent behold I stand at
[1:26:42] the door and knock If any man hear my
[1:26:45] voice and open the door I will come in
[1:26:47] to him and will sup with him and he with
[1:26:52] me amen amen
[1:26:53] I want to look at verse 18 which is
[1:26:57] which is specific to our age he says
[1:27:01] anoint your eyes with eyesalve that thou
[1:27:03] may have see and the eye salve is the
[1:27:06] holy spirit and he's speaking directly
[1:27:09] to an endtime people and brother Branham
[1:27:12] said that without the baptism of the
[1:27:15] Holy Ghost your eyes will never be
[1:27:17] opened he said to the truce revelation
[1:27:20] of the word and he said when we were
[1:27:22] little kids he said we'd sleep up in a
[1:27:24] in a cold cabin he said there was cracks
[1:27:27] and the in the shingles and so forth and
[1:27:30] he said the snow would come in on the
[1:27:32] bed and they would be up on a straw Tech
[1:27:34] and he said the wind would blow through
[1:27:36] and I know I mean it used to happen back
[1:27:38] when I was little I know there's some
[1:27:40] people that experienced that where your
[1:27:42] eyes would swell shut from the
[1:27:44] old and and they had grease some of
[1:27:47] you heard brother BAM say this he says
[1:27:49] it a number of times and he said his mom
[1:27:51] would heat up the grease which was
[1:27:52] a cure-all in the family and they say
[1:27:55] mama mama my eyes are shut their eyes
[1:27:57] would seal shut with a matter and so
[1:28:00] she'd come and take two grease and
[1:28:02] start massaging their eyes and it would
[1:28:05] start breaking up that matter and so
[1:28:07] they could see and brother Branham
[1:28:09] actually used that simple illustration
[1:28:11] and said there's been some cold drafts
[1:28:13] blowing through the church in this day
[1:28:16] all kinds of false doctrine that is
[1:28:18] blinded the people and let me tell you
[1:28:21] there's a spirit of truth but there's a
[1:28:22] spirit of error too and when you're
[1:28:25] dealing with error you're dealing with
[1:28:28] spirits and it ain't nothing to play
[1:28:29] with
[1:28:30] just like websites disbelieve the sign
[1:28:34] and all of those things there's spirits
[1:28:36] with it and if you go give it an ear to
[1:28:39] it or given your heart to it it'll
[1:28:41] actually plant unbelief in your life you
[1:28:44] know brother Branham said Eve made her
[1:28:46] mistake when she stopped to listen so if
[1:28:50] you have your own revelation you search
[1:28:52] the Scriptures not unbelieving websites
[1:28:56] did you know brother Branham said the
[1:28:58] minute that a question mark comes over
[1:29:01] the Word of God death sets in the moment
[1:29:04] not a denial of the scriptures or God
[1:29:07] the minute he can put a question mark in
[1:29:10] your heart on God death will sit in
[1:29:14] right there that's why if you've ever
[1:29:16] been into things you shouldn't be into
[1:29:18] you'll feel that darkness or dark
[1:29:20] heaviness and it can be just a little
[1:29:22] unbelief get away from it right away
[1:29:25] remember when brother Branham told the
[1:29:27] story of the little girl that was
[1:29:28] walking by the dance place she had been
[1:29:30] delivered of dancing real famous dancer
[1:29:33] and she was real real popular for her
[1:29:38] dancing she came to Christ and she was
[1:29:40] led to the Lord and she told brother
[1:29:42] branham's when hope was alive she said
[1:29:45] hope looks so clean and I've got so many
[1:29:47] scars brother Branham was like just just
[1:29:49] believe on the Lord you know well one
[1:29:51] day she was going to get a dress and get
[1:29:54] some goods to make a dress and she was
[1:29:56] walking by a dance
[1:29:57] place and she stopped there just for a
[1:30:00] moment and she looked in she started
[1:30:02] listening to the music and it started
[1:30:04] sounding good and she said maybe I'll go
[1:30:08] in and witness that's what she said
[1:30:10] maybe I'll go in and witness to him and
[1:30:13] she said I stepped in and next thing she
[1:30:15] knew she was in the arms of a man and
[1:30:17] they were on the dance floor brother
[1:30:19] branham was at his mom's house I believe
[1:30:23] it was and and not come at the door and
[1:30:28] brother branham said he had picked up a
[1:30:30] drunk along the road he brought this
[1:30:33] drunk to his house and he said that he
[1:30:36] put him in his bed and brother Brandon
[1:30:38] was sleeping on the other side of the
[1:30:39] room brother Ram said aren't you ashamed
[1:30:41] of yourself
[1:30:42] doing this to yourself and he's like
[1:30:44] listen you don't talk to me that way he
[1:30:46] said he heard like that
[1:30:48] he said something must be wrong there
[1:30:51] brother Brandon put on his clothes and
[1:30:52] opened the door she's an old brother
[1:30:54] branham I'm lost I'm lost Allah he said
[1:30:56] sister what's what's wrong talk to me
[1:30:58] what's going on and then she told him
[1:31:00] the story she said I was just walking by
[1:31:03] the place and I thought I'm just a
[1:31:05] witness and she said all of a sudden I
[1:31:07] went in and now I'm lost
[1:31:08] he said sister dear settle down he said
[1:31:12] all I know is the Bible says in my name
[1:31:16] you'll cast out devils and he started
[1:31:19] praying dear Lord we pray for our sister
[1:31:22] and all sudden the cupboard door started
[1:31:25] glowing
[1:31:25] and and shaken she goes what was that he
[1:31:30] goes I don't know
[1:31:31] and he kept praying for and he said all
[1:31:34] of a sudden this bat-like creature with
[1:31:36] hair hanging off its wings rose up
[1:31:39] behind him like this and he said took
[1:31:42] off flying through the room he said that
[1:31:43] drunk was setting up in bed and that
[1:31:45] just took and he cast the day it was the
[1:31:50] first devil brother Branham ever cast
[1:31:51] out of anyone and this demon attached
[1:31:55] itself to a woman just for stopping for
[1:31:59] a minute and just went in for a minute
[1:32:02] and opened a door to a demon let me tell
[1:32:06] you it is a spirit of error and devils
[1:32:09] get on you and unbelief get on
[1:32:11] you you don't want those kind of Devils
[1:32:13] on you the way to find truth is on your
[1:32:18] knees
[1:32:19] not by unbelieving websites to people
[1:32:22] that can't live a life can you say men
[1:32:26] you will find truth by the revelation of
[1:32:30] the word and you've got to have it for
[1:32:33] yourself do you love the Lord brother
[1:32:37] Branham said now there's been some cold
[1:32:39] drafts blowing through the church and
[1:32:41] this generation are you tired can we go
[1:32:43] just a few more minutes everybody okay
[1:32:46] he said now there's been some cold
[1:32:48] drafts blowing in this generation and
[1:32:50] I'm afraid that their eyes are frozen
[1:32:53] shot and are blind for what God has for
[1:32:55] and we need the oil of God's Spirit to
[1:33:00] open the church's eyes unless she
[1:33:04] receives the Spirit of God she will go
[1:33:06] on substituting program for power and
[1:33:10] Creed for word and she will count
[1:33:14] numbers for success rather than look for
[1:33:17] fruit and he said the doctors of
[1:33:21] theology have shut the door of faith and
[1:33:23] forbade all to enter neither will they
[1:33:26] go in or let anyone else in he said we
[1:33:28] don't need psychology what we need is
[1:33:31] the Bible you don't need any doctor to
[1:33:33] explain it to you you need the Holy
[1:33:35] Ghost to let him in and let him do the
[1:33:38] explaining to you so he says here in the
[1:33:41] book of Revelation If any man open I
[1:33:44] will come into him and I will sup with
[1:33:46] him and he with me do you remember those
[1:33:48] on the road to Emmaus when Jesus walked
[1:33:51] with them their eyes were closed they
[1:33:53] had no clue who he was they had no idea
[1:33:56] who he was but when he got into the room
[1:33:59] with them and sat down all sudden he
[1:34:01] broke bread and their eyes were open it
[1:34:04] was him all the time
[1:34:05] but now their understanding was open and
[1:34:08] the Bible said he opened their
[1:34:11] understanding of the scriptures so many
[1:34:14] of people have the Bible's memorized but
[1:34:17] don't have the understanding of what God
[1:34:19] is saying do you love the Lord amen so
[1:34:23] we want God to Oh
[1:34:24] our understanding just like he did with
[1:34:26] Gaza remember gays a house get hazed
[1:34:29] awoke up in the morning and he looked
[1:34:31] and he saw all the Syrians he said
[1:34:32] master master they got us surrounded
[1:34:35] Elisha looked I said there's more of us
[1:34:37] and there is them now they were always
[1:34:40] there but he couldn't see him so he
[1:34:44] prayed Lord open this guy's eyes and
[1:34:47] when he opened his eyes he saw there was
[1:34:49] more of us than there is them Amen see
[1:34:54] it takes our eye sight we see with her
[1:34:57] heart and not her eyes but by faith
[1:35:01] Abraham saw Isaac coming encountered and
[1:35:06] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:35:07] he saw that by faith because God opened
[1:35:11] his eyes it was a revelation that Isaac
[1:35:13] was coming can you say men Moses by
[1:35:17] faith saw him who is invisible it was by
[1:35:22] faith that Abel offered a more excellent
[1:35:25] sacrifice it was my revelation he
[1:35:27] offered a more excellent sacrifice it
[1:35:31] was by faith that the walls of Jericho
[1:35:33] came down you could actually go into the
[1:35:35] book of Revelation and by faith by faith
[1:35:37] you can put by revelation by revelation
[1:35:40] because brother Branham said faith and a
[1:35:42] revelation is the same thing you can't
[1:35:44] have faith without a revealed to you
[1:35:46] ain't that right and so just like your
[1:35:50] salvation it must it must be open to you
[1:35:54] it must be revealed to you that there is
[1:35:56] a door of salvation a door of healing
[1:35:59] there's the holy spirit for you or
[1:36:01] whatever divine promise God has for us
[1:36:03] it takes faith God to open our eyes to
[1:36:06] see it ain't that right so brother
[1:36:08] Branham said we see with our heart we
[1:36:11] see with understanding and faith is a
[1:36:13] revelation from God and then brother
[1:36:16] Branham said faith he said faith is
[1:36:20] something that's revealed to you that is
[1:36:22] not yet faith is a revelation of the
[1:36:25] will of God for your life by and he says
[1:36:29] he talked to a man and said we refuse
[1:36:32] all revelations and brother Branham said
[1:36:35] then you've got to refuse cry
[1:36:37] he said because Christ is the revelation
[1:36:40] of God and the Spirit of God revealed in
[1:36:45] human form everybody with me and so we
[1:36:51] want a revelation of our part in this
[1:36:55] message we have gifts in our lives and
[1:36:58] every one of us play a part and don't
[1:37:00] think that you don't if God opened your
[1:37:03] eyes to this message then you have a
[1:37:05] part to play maybe you're a musician
[1:37:08] maybe you're a preacher maybe maybe
[1:37:11] you're a witness whatever it may be God
[1:37:14] knows what it is but every one of us
[1:37:16] need a revelation of our purpose here on
[1:37:18] earth if you've got breath in your lungs
[1:37:19] then there's a purpose for you being
[1:37:21] here can you say Amen
[1:37:24] there's a reason why we're here and
[1:37:26] that'll take divine revelation can you
[1:37:29] say man I would wrap this up I think you
[1:37:32] might be getting a little tired I wonder
[1:37:34] I want to read this to you turn with me
[1:37:36] to Ephesians chapter one verse fifteen
[1:37:45] Fijians one
[1:37:48] let's read 15 through 18 where's the
[1:37:51] microphone where we at oh I know you can
[1:37:57] read 15 through 18 wherefore I also
[1:38:01] after I heard of your faith in in the
[1:38:05] Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints
[1:38:09] cease not to give thanks for you making
[1:38:13] mention of you and you're in my prayers
[1:38:16] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:21] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:38:24] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:38:26] the in the knowledge of him the eyes of
[1:38:30] your understanding being enlightened
[1:38:32] that you may know that what is the hope
[1:38:36] of his calling and what the riches of
[1:38:40] the glory of his inheritance and the
[1:38:45] Saints beautiful so Paul's praying now
[1:38:48] for the church that the eyes of their
[1:38:49] understanding would be in lie
[1:38:51] this is very familiar to us but how many
[1:38:54] here want revelation from God I'm gonna
[1:38:58] read this to you brother Bram said if
[1:38:59] revelation is beyond you look up and
[1:39:03] seek God for it that is the only way
[1:39:07] you're ever going to get it a revelation
[1:39:12] has to come from God it never comes by
[1:39:17] human natural endowment but by spiritual
[1:39:20] endowment you can even memorize the
[1:39:23] scripture and that's wonderful but that
[1:39:25] won't do it it has to be a revelation
[1:39:29] from God it says in the word that no man
[1:39:31] can say Jesus is the Christ but by the
[1:39:34] Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy
[1:39:36] Ghost and then only then can the Spirit
[1:39:39] give you a revelation that Jesus is the
[1:39:41] Christ the Anointed One no man knows the
[1:39:45] things of God saved the Spirit of God
[1:39:47] and to whom the Spirit of God will
[1:39:49] reveal him we need to call on God for
[1:39:52] revelation more than anything else in
[1:39:55] the world we have accepted the Bible we
[1:39:58] have accepted the great truths of it but
[1:40:01] still it's not real for most people
[1:40:03] because the revelation of the Spirit is
[1:40:05] not there the word has not been
[1:40:08] quickened he said now in 1st Corinthians
[1:40:12] 5:21 that we would become the
[1:40:15] righteousness of God by our union with
[1:40:18] Jesus Christ did you get it it says we
[1:40:21] are the righteousness of God himself by
[1:40:24] being in Christ it says that Jesus
[1:40:28] became sin for us and it does not say he
[1:40:31] became sinful but that he became sin
[1:40:34] that by our union with him we might
[1:40:38] become the righteousness of God if we
[1:40:41] accept the fact and we must that Jesus
[1:40:44] became sin for us then we must also
[1:40:48] accept the fact that by our union with
[1:40:51] him we have become the very
[1:40:53] righteousness of God watch this to
[1:40:57] reject the one is to reject the other to
[1:41:01] accept the one is to accept
[1:41:04] the other now we know the Bible says
[1:41:07] that it can't be denied but the
[1:41:10] revelation is missing
[1:41:12] it's not real to the majority of God's
[1:41:16] children it's just a good verse in the
[1:41:18] Bible but we need to have it it made a
[1:41:21] life to us and that will take Revelation
[1:41:25] brother Branham said she is the sinless
[1:41:27] spotless bride of Jesus Christ now every
[1:41:32] one of us know our own lives and our own
[1:41:33] heart and we look in the mirror every
[1:41:35] day and how many can say I am the
[1:41:38] righteousness of God you know that's
[1:41:47] amazing how Hollywood how they portray
[1:41:50] Moses you know Charleston Heston hero
[1:41:55] like you know muscles it ya know he had
[1:42:00] a stutter God uses simplicity people
[1:42:03] like you and I honestly how many can
[1:42:06] stand up say I am the righteousness of
[1:42:08] God but the Bible says we are and that
[1:42:14] will take Revelation why are you talking
[1:42:16] about Revelation because we need it
[1:42:18] tonight we believe that he became sin
[1:42:21] right that part is easy but the part
[1:42:25] that applies to us that we are the
[1:42:27] righteousness of God that's where we say
[1:42:30] God help us me you absolutely we must
[1:42:35] believe it because God's only taking a
[1:42:37] bride without spot into the rapture
[1:42:39] ain't that wonderful now watch what he
[1:42:43] says
[1:42:44] cuz I've bear with me a few more minutes
[1:42:46] I won't hold you much longer no one can
[1:42:50] doubt that the scribes and the Pharisees
[1:42:51] and the great scholars the nineteen I'm
[1:42:54] sorry in a t-33 knew the exact laws of
[1:42:57] grammar and exact meanings of the words
[1:42:59] in the Old Testament but all their
[1:43:03] superb knowledge they miss the
[1:43:05] revelation of God's promised Word and
[1:43:08] manifested son there he was set forth
[1:43:12] from Genesis to Malachi with all the
[1:43:15] chapters devoted to him and his ministry
[1:43:17] and
[1:43:18] only a few was illuminated by the spirit
[1:43:20] they missed him entirely now he said we
[1:43:24] come to the conclusion that we have
[1:43:26] already found in the word as we believe
[1:43:30] and are trying to find the oldest
[1:43:32] manuscripts and get the best records of
[1:43:34] the word possible we will never get the
[1:43:37] true meaning of the study in comparison
[1:43:40] of scriptures as sincere as we may be it
[1:43:43] will take the revelation from God to
[1:43:46] bring it out that's exactly what Paul
[1:43:48] said things which we speak not in words
[1:43:51] which man's wisdom teaches but what the
[1:43:54] Holy Spirit teaches now he said don't
[1:43:57] let be misled I believe in the accuracy
[1:43:59] of the Scriptures he says but we need
[1:44:02] the Spirit to teach it to us how we need
[1:44:05] a revelation of the Spirit we don't need
[1:44:08] a new Bible we don't need a new
[1:44:10] translation though some are good I'm not
[1:44:12] against it
[1:44:13] we need a revelation of the Spirit and
[1:44:16] thank God we can have what we need for
[1:44:19] God wants to reveal his word to us by
[1:44:24] the spirit and may God by his Spirit
[1:44:27] give us continuous life-giving say
[1:44:32] life-giving continuous progressive never
[1:44:39] stopping continuous life-giving and
[1:44:43] prevailing revelation oh if the church
[1:44:46] could only get a fresh revelation and
[1:44:49] become it the Living Word manifested we
[1:44:53] would do the greater works and glorify
[1:44:55] God in heaven I'm just going to stop
[1:44:59] there
[1:45:00] how many want to do the greater works
[1:45:03] how many say Lord I want to be a
[1:45:05] spiritual believer I want to be a
[1:45:07] spiritual church Oh what I need a
[1:45:09] revelation from God I want to go deeper
[1:45:12] in Christ how many feel that way I do I
[1:45:16] want to go deeper we've looked at he is
[1:45:19] our rock he was David's rock he was
[1:45:21] Moses Rock he was Abraham's Rock he's
[1:45:24] got to be your rock tonight he's got to
[1:45:26] be my rock we thank God for a good
[1:45:29] pastor that he has a rock but
[1:45:31] I need a rock you need a rock we need a
[1:45:34] personal experience we thank God for the
[1:45:36] prophet and the Prophet had a rock but
[1:45:39] we can have the same Rock he had how
[1:45:42] many say yes Lord tonight
