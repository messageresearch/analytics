and be with you today and there's no no place like home amen with our loved ones and our friends and but I'm looking forward to a time that it won't matter how far away we are that we'll be able to just travel like a thought and be there and travel and be together I believe that day is coming very soon amen bring you greetings from Brother David mayor and the church there and also Brother David Iverson and their church we ministered there in Switzerland France border there on the first weekend we were gone and had four services and amen the Lord just really moved and touched a lot of hearts and a lot of testimonies have come out of that then me and my family would go from there spend a few days in Paris and then going to Belgium and Minister there that weekend and amen God's still the same no matter where you are amen he's still moving in his people it's things are happening all over this world and sometimes we don't realize just how much God is doing and how much God is moving but he's moving and he's healing he's delivering he's bringing prodal home he's saving amen just witnessed uh people being filled with the Holy Ghost and prodal coming back to the Lord and and the healings taking place and we just want to thank the Lord for all of that and amen but again it's good to be home God bless you tonight let's look at Lamentations 3 and verse 55 said I called upon thy name oh Lord out of the low dust dungeon and thou has heard my voice hide not thine ear to my breathing at My Cry thou drwest near in the day that I called upon thee and thou said us fear not oh Lord thou has pleaded the causes of my soul and thou Hast redeemed my life I want to read that verse in the Amplified it says oh Lord you have pleaded my soul's cause you have guided my way and protected me and you have rescued and redeemed my life life oh Lord thou H has seen my wrong judge thou my cause thou has seen all their Vengeance and all their imaginations against me thou has heard their reproach oh Lord and all their imaginations against me the lips of those that rose up against me and their device against me all the day behold their sitting down and their rising up I am their music I want read that also in the Amplified says look at their sitting and their Rising their actions and secret counsels I am their mocking song or the subject of their ridicule but Render unto them a recompense oh Lord according to the works of their hands give them sorrow of heart and thy curse unto them persecute and Destroy them in Anger from under the heavens of the Lord also John chap 14 and verse 16 said I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you you forever even the spirit of Truth in the world world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you amen well let you be seated um kind of kind of still in between here in Europe somewhere I haven't caught up with myself so uh just got in last night about midnight and bed about 1:00 and got up this morning but we're here to serve the Lord and we're thankful to be in his service amen this time that we're living in we're living in a crazy time but it's also a wonderful time amen I like how brother Brandon put it he said we're living in a very terrible time and he said but a terrible time for the unbeliever he said but it's the most wonderful time for a Believer because we're right at the coming of the Lord and I I believe that with all my heart I I actually spoke this for the first time with at those tent meetings at brother Matt Morris's and the Lord put this on my heart so you kind of get in the reverse side of things normally you speak things at your home church and go out and minister to uh Minister there but I I would like to speak to you on he has taken your case he has taken your case I I was looking at the scripture in John chapter 14 and he says I'll give you another comforter this comforter in the King James Bible it means helper or Advocate it means someone who is summoned and called to one side in order to help you someone who pleads another cause before a judge it's a counsel for defense for the defense or a legal assistant an advocate or intercessor job would find this and he would speak about him in Job chapter 16 and verse 19 it said even now behold my wit witness that is in heaven and my Advocate who vouches and testifies for me on high 1 John 2 and verse one would say it like this my little children these things write unto you that you sin not if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous he is the propit for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world you know I I was looking at this thought upon the advocate and how God is taken our case and and I'm I'm thankful today that he's taken our case that he's not just allowed it to just go on and and the time to just T it's for a reason and for a purpose and but God is actually advocating or uh standing on our side and on our behalf even now amen before the father and so I I I was looking at a quote brother Brown said God took me in and now I'm his child and he and look what he's done for us look what he is is for us in his riches he in his riches he became poor that in his poverty we might become rich and in his immortality he became flesh that he might take on our sickness that is his sickness might that in his sickness we might have health and all my sins he was sinless and but he took my sins that I might become sinless he became me that I might become him in heaven and he stands at mine and your representative then God doesn't look to us or look at us he looks at our representative Christ that is standing there in our stad representing us before the father he said you know if you ever had a court trial you would get a representative and he would stand before you as an attorney and he would plead your cause who knows how to do it any better than he does when he was the very son of the father standing in the presence of God to plead the sinner's case if we we confess being rich yet he became poor that through his poverty we might become rich rich in what money no rich in Heavenly blessings rich in spiritual things we who are once poor now become rich through his poverty he stripped himself he IM he he humiliated himself he came down the Great Divine one from above in humiliation came down and brought himself down humbled himself into a body of Flesh to walk among men hearing the cursing and the swearing of men feeling the Pains of sickness and of death and upon himself that through it all that not because he had to but because love brought him to it and he done all of that and became sick and had trouble you say he was sick certainly he was sick didn't he make his own thing in himself when he made a statement he said won't they say to me physician heal yourself sure he bore our sicknesses he bore our griefs and he bore our sorrows and he bore our sins amen why because he is now standing as our advocate he knows what it's like to be sick he knows what it's like to have griefs he he knows what it's like to have uh to come against sin and different thoughts and sorrows and all of that and but so therefore he would if he didn't know what it was like he wouldn't know how to represent you he wouldn't know how to be an advocate for you he wouldn't know how to how to stand there and plead your case and to plead your cause cuz if somebody's never been through what you've been through they can't tell you what it's like to go what you go through what you're went going through amen but somebody that's been there somebody that's walk in those same places and those same footsteps they know how to be an advocate for you they know how to stand for you they and if somebody's got really you you and their you and their best interest or or or you know you on their heart they'll stand there and they'll plead their your cause they'll they'll hold you before whatever they're going through and plead the cause you know if you had committed a crime and you were going to be tried in a court you know that you would F that you if you were found guilty you were going to die you're going to an electric chair or to a gas chamber or some public educa execution and you were going to have be hung or something lynched whatever the penalty was and you knew you were guilty you knew you must die but if you don't get some good attorney to represent you you was not there was not going to be a way out of it but so you would want the best that you could get amen you wouldn't want somebody didn't know a lick about nothing that never want a case that never never got anybody you want the best that you could get and you would be willing to pay all that you could to get that person and so you'd want somebody that could stand there and could plead your case and he could look at the laws and he could dissect it and he could find a way that you would not have to die but he could find a way with a judge or find a way with a jury somehow that you you could live and you would want the very best that you could get and if you would even find this person you could get the most money somebody give you a great big donation to get the best and the best one that hardly maybe never lost a case or or been there and got people out of worst trouble that you had been in it would still be a question in your mind there would still be something there that wondering if he could really do what he says he could do if he he could really change the jury's mind or or the judge judge's idea about you and through his speaking and knowing all the laws and if he could change it if he could really plead it if he could really prove it that you would live and yet and all of his great Authority and his great speech that he can make and The Impressions he could put upon the jury and upon the judge and and you know maybe maybe you could relax a few minutes but still there would be a question in your mind can he do it can he do it can he can he really change the judge's mind can he can he move the jury just enough to that I don't have to go to a to an electric chair or to a hanging or but in but in this case but in this case tonight amen the judge is is himself is also your attorney amen God became man he took your place amen and he came down so he could stand there and know what it's like to go through sickness and know what it's like to go through sin and know what it's like to go through trouble amen and and you don't have to pay for this judge you don't have to pay for this attorney it's already been paid for and it's the best amen listen if you if you got cancer you'd want the best doctors amen if you got some kind of thing in your life or some kind of sickness you wouldn't want some Fly by Night guy that said I tell you what we're going to do we're going to get grab a a dewal drill and we're going to come in here and we're going to open this up with a sawsa and we no you would want somebody that had a little education somebody that knew knew exactly where they was going and how they was going to attack it how they was going to remove it what they was going to do you would want somebody who had been there before amen when I you know when I got laser surgery done on my eyes I used to have uh I don't know if brother Philip I don't see him here tonight but brother Philip used he saw me one time in my glasses and he said you got glasses so thick you ought to be able to see in the future with I had some bad eyes and so I went and found me brother Tim was getting some surgery and found out this guy could fix it and correct it but you know what I didn't want somebody that never done it before I didn't want somebody that had never operated on eyeballs before I wanted the best so you know what we found we found the guy who was teaching other people how to do it amen I don't want just anybody messing with my eyes and I just I didn't want just anybody say well I got out of school yesterday and I'm ready to do something today no I wanted the best that I could find amen and I when you got cancer you want the best that you could find the best doctor if you're you're you're in trouble with the law you want the best that you can find well I'm here to tell you church we have the best he's never lost a case hallelujah amen he's the best Advocate he's the best stand between he'll stand between you and your sickness he'll stand between you and your sin he'll stand between you and your trouble he'll stand between you and your issues and yay though I walk through a valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me amen the judge that is standing there is not against you the judge is for you amen he becomes both judge jury and attorney he's pleaded our case and he's standing there he took it upon himself and he died and he paid the price and he shed his own blood and he gave back his own life for you why we're standing here perfectly the case is dismissed Hallelujah the case is dismissed there's no more case to it hallelujah amen maybe you've done all the wrong you could do and you sinned all the sin you can sin but all you got to do is say father forgive me and he'll dismiss your case and he'll lay it aside and it'll never be remembered no more the token has been applied and death be when death begins to Smite against the door it has no control come on somebody I'm here to tell you death has no control death is only a doorway to step into another dimension death does not control Our Lives death has already been defeated hallelujah amen our our Advocate our judge came and took on death himself and he put it under his feet therefore death has no fear fear in it to a Believer death has no control over us death does not determine the day that we die Hallelujah the token is applied it has no control the token is Recon recognized he he did that so the token would come he gave his own life God's life was given out God came down and he says he says he he came down to take on our sins he came to become one of us that's a real lamb that would become one of us it's his purpose he had in his mind that's the reason the lamb was identified Amen in the Garden of Eden knowing that that that sooner or later many thousands of years later there was going to be the Lamb of God that would come amen and so he put that lamb and he ripped off that skin and he throwed it on Adam and Eve why because it was their stand between or their go between between the there's sin and between God but we know the Bible teaches and the and the prophet of God teaches that the life of that lamb could not come back upon the believer therefore David he would plead his case and Lord I've sinned against you create in me a clean heart renew a right spirit in me but and God would forgive him but he would still have that desire he would still have that that want that lust or whatever it was in his life but when this lamb came this judge became our attorney and he wiped away the case and he said it is finished it is over with death has no more power sin has no more power amen sickness has no more power amen sickness does not determine the day you die it has no it has no control it has no power in it Hallelujah when we can realize our enemy has lost his power it it has no power to determine if I breathe another breath or I Live Another Day it has no power it has lost its power I'm here to tell you cancer has lost its power every disease has lost his power every sin has lost his power it has it cannot control your life any longer it cannot control your ways no longer he cannot determine how long you live he cannot determine nothing about you the one in control the judge has become your attorney and he's standing there pleading your [Applause] cause Hallelujah the holy spirit is our Advocate as a token that's over the door saying the price has been paid that when the death angel comes it looks and sees the blood and says I can't enter in there Hallelujah therefore when you receive the Holy Ghost you've passed from Death To Life come on now you passed from Death to life that's what the token is showing you're This Old Man Died death you're too late I've already died amen this old man died and a new man lives that cannot die oh you can put in a grave somewhere but what's on the inside of me cannot die Hallelujah but on that Resurrection morning it's going to come up out of that grave come on somebody therefore death does not decree how long you live amen sickness does not decree how long you can live it has no control takes the fear out of it when you realize it has no control it has nothing no power to do anything amen the Lord determines what day I live and what day I die amen he's the one in control a token is a sign the price has been paid it's over with it's finished he said like the railroad company or bus company you go in want to ride it you have to have a token you have to purchase your fair you pay for it you give your token that your fair has already been paid that's what you have to give to a street car railroad bring it on up in our language a airplane amen you know when I when I we flew over over there and flew back you know i' never had to worry about that if I had a seed or not cuz I had a token I paid the price it was already done we took nine people with us and every one of us didn't have to none of us had to worry about a seat we all had it we showed us what seat we assigned to where we was going to sit how we how whether what class his in this that and the other and so you know it was there showing us so we walked up we just scanned our ticket there wasn't an ounce of fear they said wow I wonder if I don't have a seat I wonder if I'm going to I'm going to be able to get on this plane now there was no fear I never fear feared that at all I just went up there and scanned my ticket cuz I knew the price had been paid so that ought to when you realize the price has been paid amen for you for you a seat on the train to Glory it's already done it's already already paid for it's already finished there's no fear about it there's no fear worrying are you going to have a seat or you're not going to have a seat no I have a seat all right it's at a table a th000 miles long and ain't nobody can take my seat ain't nobody else can feel my seat ain't nobody else can sit there it has been predestinated by almighty God and it has my name on it hallelujah amen and I'm not worried about it the price has already been paid this is what the token does for you it's what the Holy Ghost does for you it shows you that it's over with that it's finished that is done that is complete and the devil can't do nothing about it am man that you they may cancel a airplane flight you may not get to go for a few days but I can tell you right now the devil will not cancel this flight amen he cannot delay it one moment he cannot delay it one hour he can't delay it a day it's when it's time to go this plane is going to take off and those that have been ordained to a seat will be on there hallelujah hallelujah the life came from the sacrifice and now the blood was a token and orders his orders had been carried out the blood so it was showing that when I see the blood I know the death price has been made and I'll pass over you the believing worshipper was identified with his Sacrifice by the token that it was done the worshipper who believed Jehovah had met Jehovah's requirements had identified himself by applying the token to himself and to his house that was the worshipper that believed it's a perfect T type of Christ today the blood was a token of identification that this believer has already made and met Jehovah's requirement I'm sure the death angel will have to pass from my house because I've met Jehovah's token I've met his requirement a lamb has in has died instead of me and he died for my family and for my loved ones that's under this blood and there is a token that the lamb is dead it is finish and then is so he said when I think of that my heart jumps for Joy now that animal life could not come back upon the believer so the therefore the blood had to stand for the token the blood wrapped up in the animal which started with a single sell and is shed when that animal's blood was shed but that life could not come back so the blood had to stand for a token of death he said but now we have a token in this day that was a natural now we have a supernatural Supreme token and it's the holy spirit that stands over our life that's our Advocate that stands for us that comes Upon Our need that comes upon our behalf and when we call he will answer yes inde it's a token it's identification that is finished that it's over with that is done and he so goes on he says therefore we also have to identify ourself with our sacrifice we have to identify in his death when the Jews placed his hand upon the sacrifice he was identify himself transfering his sins to his sacrifice now we place our hands by faith upon the Lord Jesus Christ and are identifi and are identified with him in his death not only in his death but we're identified in his death but also in his resurrection by the life that was in him is now coming to the believer as a token a memorial that we have passed from Death unto life he said I know it works I know it's true I've tried it Hallelujah there is no other ISM no other workup no other schemes no gimmicks no nothing it's the word of God Amen that God requires and there's nothing we can do to save ourselves it's only what he has already done and if the lamb is accepted we are also accepted so the lamb laying upon the altar was an advocate it was a goete it was a a answer between a sin that it taking place and God was not looking at the worshipper God was looking at the lamb and if the lamb was perfect and accepted then if the lamb was accepted then the worshipper was also accepted Hallelujah and we know our lamb was accepted he laid himself down and he said it is finished sir it is over with it is done what was he saying the price is paid when he said that stat and it is finished I want you to understand when he said finished that means sin was finished sickness was finished death was finished every sin that could ever be imputed to man was finished all they had to accept was The Works been done and I accept the life over me and in me to guide me and to Lead Me There is the gospel amen it wasn't just a chemical blood but but the spirit of that blood to come back you know we was actually in where was that in brouge Belgium and they have a cath you know Catholics everywhere over there but anyway try to get you to pay for everything you know they say they literally have a in this certain church I I didn't pay to go in there and see it cuz Frank Frankly I don't believe it but anyway they said they have a actual a little vessel of the actual blood of Jesus Christ and they charge you to look at it thought well ain't that ain't that a a paradox or what is it what's the word I'm looking for a different word oxymoron that sounds about right bunch of morons Lord help me I told you I told somebody I'm not responsible for tonight I'm somewhere about over Iceland I think but anyway they had this they had this this little Cruise they said and they they actually March up and down the streets with it and people bowing and kneeling and over this little bit of ounce of blood paying money to to go look at it and look put the and and who knows it might be Lamb's blood it it might be Dogs blood I don't know what kind of blood it is but I know the blood that was shed for me was without price it was the price it paid the price it paid it all it paid for every sin it paid for every doubt it paid for every mind battle it paid for for every disease it paid for cancer it paid for sugar diabetes high blood pressure you want to name it it paid for it all and it didn't cost me nothing but it cost him everything but he he freely gives us if you'll freely receive it and then no devil no sickness no death no sorrow nothing can bother you as long as you hold that token amen your unchanging face pulsating through that it forms a form of Jesus Christ the image that you're walking in today when I see the token I'll pass over you it's a sign it's a sign the price has been paid Jesus Paid It All holding the token in your hand you having the Assurance of the Resurrection you have the Assurance of everything you have need of in this journey you have the assurance of healing you have the Assurance of Deliverance you have the Assurance of Peace you have the Assurance of joy you have the Assurance of it all there's no devil can stand before it there's nothing that can stand in between cuz God has accepted it and as long as you're holding it in your hand the price has been paid Hallelujah was standing about right there just the other night on that prayer line putting people putting oil on people's head foreheads you know why we do that it's not just out of a formality or some Hocus Pocus no it's out of the Bible for one thing and the Bible said anoint them with oil you know what that an that oil is representing the token the holy ghost that the price is already P been paid and that that oil is representing the Holy Spirit and when we put that oil upon you if you're sick or you need Deliverance you need something in your life it is standing there as an advocate as a goet as a standing in in between you and whatever you're dealing with so if you get cancer is standing between you and your cancer Hallelujah if you got issues in your life it'll stand between you and plead your case and plead your cuse and say hey he's not guilty of it anymore it's done with it's finished it's over with he's healed he's delivered it's doneall yeah yes I got a phone call today that about sent me over the moon from Sister jeie Camp so there in the office getting ready for this already had these things on my heart and she said that she's now had what two treatments about to have your third next week she went to the doctor and he said you want some good news and he told her about her numbers her cancer numbers have been cut in half hallelujah amen what was it it's the oil it's the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of God that is standing there between her and that disease Hallelujah and I want to say this with all my heart sister Jeanie he has taken your case hallelujah hallelujah amen you can we can have the best doctors and thank God for it and the best verses and thank God for it but if he says I'll take it if he says I'll take it right now it's finished it's over with it's done hallelujah and we're not talking about a Doctor Who's lost half of his patients or lost half of his cases we're talking about a God who has not lost one Hallelujah but if he takes your case it's overwhelmed it's finished it's done woo Hallelujah I can't tell you how many times this Advocate has canceled the devil's plans W amen sister Atlanta he canceled the plans of the enemy over your [Applause] life he said if I knew my life was at stake at stake I would hire the best attorney I could find every person would it's only the sensible thing to do but in this case to know that you're going to electric chair you're going to be separated from your family you die whatever but this attorney is trying to plead your case now the attorney may think that he has it all put down just perfect but you see the judge is going to decide the case whether the attorney can make it clear to him that you're Justified the attorney has got to make it so clear to the judge that the judge will see the justice of your act he said oh God if the people could only see this our judge is our attorney Hallelujah if the people can only see this I say God open our eyes tonight our judge is our attorney the case is settled it's all over with the same one is Judge as our attorney the case is Saddle we have the token it's already been paid for it's done the case is settled the Holy Ghost is here for a token that we've already passed from here into the Lands Beyond we're free from sin not of sin no more not of the world no more little children you're not of the world our judge and our attorney the same person so the case is settled the case was so great against us the case that we had seen was so great against us that not even an archangel could plead it he couldn't do it he could there wasn't enough Lambs there wasn't enough enough animals in the whole earth that could take away our sin he could not meet the requirement No Angel no cheram no sarpam nothing can meet the price the only thing that could be done to save the Jud the human race was the judge come and take their place and become their eternity and that's exactly what he's done it is finished Hallelujah that's exactly what happened that was the judge that spoke there on the cross and said it is finished it's done it's over I've shed the blood Satan you lost again you're lost again if Satan would have knew what the shedding of that blood would do he would not let him fall down and scrape his knee he'd have moved every Rock he'd have put padding down everywhere cuz if that blood is shed it's over with but that dumb devil didn't realize he thought surely if this would be God he could do this and that be dumb devil if it was God he would have come come out of the heavens and he would had a trumpet salute he's going to but he had a trumpet salute and he would come down roll the red carpet walk right down into Caiaphas Temple there and say here I am but I just can't believe cuz he knew how great this God was he' been before him he knew what he been he worshiped him for millions and millions of years he knew what the greatness of this God how could a God so great become that about it but if he had have known he would not have let that blood not he wouldn't have let him have a split nail nothing he' have tried to preserve it tried to hold it try to keep it as long as he could but he was so fooled I can't be him you got to be just like Elijah or one of them others I took them down I'll take him down too but that bee be to whirl around that cross it stung Elijah and and done his job it has stung all the prophets and done his job but here he comes around this one and he says it is finished be was laughing I did it again why can't I get loose I got more and it ripped a stinger out Christ's death did just change you it changed the devil forever he lost his power he lost his ability he lost his his Mo his his moments of Fame he lost it all right there and the judge said it's finished why did he say it then so you would never have to hear it now you don't want him to look at you and say it's finished going to hell forever what you don't want that judgment so he made that judgment then but it wasn't against you it was against your enemy ain't that amazing what could you imagine a guy that would have such a case that he thought man I'm going to win this and I'm going to win millions of dollars and I'm going to I'm going to S suit and it's going to be over with and he had such a case that was so well built and so done and thought man I got it wrapped up it's over with it's fin they're going like they're going to hell like the rest of them but all of a sudden the judge takes off his coat and he steps down and becomes the attorney and he begins to plead the case and he begins to plead the cause and he said is done it's finished it's over with there's no more case to [Music] it Hallelujah you owe Millions you couldn't pay it all it was impossible to pay for your sin it was impossible to add it all up and to have enough to pay for it but you didn't have to he came and he wrote over it it is done it's finished so what is there to fear I'll take a drink of water on that one what what is there to fear cancer no it's finished on sins nope finished sickness nope finished death nope finished Satan himself nope finished what is it what you dealing with it ain't nothing to fear what is there to fear the judgment that should have been yours fell upon him at the cross and at the grave when he descended was for us everything he done was for he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin there is now for therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus for shity our attorney is our judge he's both attorney and judge the judge as judge the case is settled it is finished therefore there is now no condemnation man if we can strip the condemnation over off of people's lives and they realize the price is already paid you don't have to carry that no more you don't have to carry that past stuff and that nonsense of your life if you've asked for forgiveness it's over with it's finished so kick it off quit caring it quit walking away around with past mistakes and past failures and past unbelief and past the it's all done it's finished it's over with what kind of fathers would we have here today if there was no condemnation what kind of sisters would we have and mothers would we have if there was no condemnation well let's deal with it it is finished it is over with it is done your past is [Applause] Forgiven why should the church fear why should we fear cancer what is finished death it's done it's over with it's it's finished the thing you've been worrying about all week is finished it's done we sing it it's already done it's already well believe it sing it like you believe it it's finished he's already paid the price he's already gave me the rights he's already done it so I can have what he said I can have I can be what he said I can be I can rise above where I am what you need to do is to start using that stuff that's holding you down and throw it down and use it something to step on to get up higher not push you down but pick you up higher amen rise above it he said why what should why should it fear punishment punishment it's hard to get punished if you ain't done nothing we're not talking about somebody that don't know any everything you know I understand sure yeah I'm sure there's children in here that took took a whooping that you didn't actually deserve but I can promise you you got a lot of things you did deserve more for that you didn't get but we're not talking about parents that don't know all everything and exactly how it all happened they're trying by the goodness of their mind and heart and trying to decipher what's really true what's really wrong and decide whether you need a whooping or not but most time you needed it regardless anyhow sir but we're talking about a God who knows all things we're talking about a God who knows every blink of every Nat's eye he knows everything so but why should we feel punish fear punishment when we ain't done anything in his sight when you ask for forgiveness it's over with so leave it there at the altar don't pick it up again don't pick up your past mistakes don't pick up your past failures and your past this quit quit worrying about the past too many people let the future be run by the past that was good amen preach it yeah I'm going do that brother somebody does preach it too many people let the past they let the past failures and the past mistakes ruin so much of their present and their future they allow things that happen back there to become such a thing right now and they care it and care it and you're not careful you're going to pass it from one generation to another generation to another generation but somebody got to break the cycle somebody got to realize I ain't got to fear this no more it's finished my past is over with my past sins have been paid for and in the blood of the Lamb it's not that you want your debt cleared so you can go make more debt no the life has been changed I love how brother Tim uses that analogy about a rich man come and pay off all your debt so that's all fine and dandy but you can go out make new debts and this man here he knows how to how to operate with money and save money and do things and he comes and he out of the goodness of his heart pays off everything you can go make more debts this is what happens with people they do come and they ask for forgiveness but they don't get the life of the man who paid off his debts you got to have his life and then you'll have his you'll have his ways Hallelujah you have you you'll have his ability to balance your checkbook and to keep it in the positive come on somebody amen too many people are always in the red in the negative I'm talking about another thing more than your natural checkbook right now I'm talking about your life yes sir always in the negative it's always negative this that and the other amen it's time that you get the life of Jesus Christ he'll move you from the negative into the positive Hallelujah so why should we fear punishment or death it's all been overcome here's the one who came been conquered both World seen and unseen Hallelujah so everything you can see with these natural eyes is conquered it's finished it's done it's over with amen everything that you cannot see with these eyes but you can see with some spiritual eyesight it's conquered it's done it's finished he said not like Napoleon who conquered all of Europe but was finally defeated at waterl and he only only to find himself conquered he was banished to a prison himself I actually visited his tomb he's dead yep he's dead killed a lot of people but he died too tried to conquer the world got all caught up in his arrogance lost got banished to jail a defeated person and I looked at his Shrine it was huge taller than this place just Beauty Beyond imagination and this big old huge casket sitting down in this hole I was looking at I like yep you're dead what good did all that do for you I bet you would come back and want to rewrite some things I was having a conversation whether he was listening or not I bet you'd want to redo a few things in your life all this monuments built to you probably ain't worth what you're dealing with right now all this Museum about what you done and what I've walked through and all your history and how great you were and all that I bet You' try to come back and change some things right now if you could that was that a guy Alexander another guy conquered the world the known world but lost but nothing can conquer Christ he that descended has now ascended above all and unto him has been given a name that's above every name he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave and as the keys thereof what he looses is loose and what he binds is bound and there's no changing of it there's no conquer before him and there's none beside him he alone is savior Redeemer and he's the only God in the Lord Jesus Christ is his name don't fear Little Flock don't fear Little Flock all that I am you are air to all my power is yours my nipp is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability and all power is given unto me and it's yours to use hallelujah it's yours to use you speak the word and I'll perform it that is my Covenant and it will never fail Hall oh praise the name of the Lord do you realize what you're dealing with here this evening you have a token that's in your your hand and he has unlimited power unlimited ability it'll still heal every sick person what you say so and so die it doesn't matter it'll still heal every sick person I tell you what I just going to drop this in right here your pastor went up there and spoke at sister Erica's funeral it be well worth listening to answer your questions of why and this and the faith and she had so much Faith listen it was her faith that took her there I love that it was her fa she didn't lose Faith no it was her faith that took her there and I can promise you right now she has no regrets be a little different conversation than her her gravestone right now if I was there versus when I was at napoleons I could say you had no regrets I could say you don't want to come back here I know he said how he know that well I know a man that went beyond the curtain of time and he felt him his body going back to himself he's got a loving wife laying right next to him in the bed he's got children right there in every door and he said these words do I have to go back do I have to go back to that body they don't want to come back they don't want to be here hallelujah but they are coming back and they're going to take up these Earthly bodies that's going to be transformed those theop is going to meet with these bodies and be moved into another realm and we're going to go home with them Hallelujah but do you understand what we have here today I we're not we don't have a checkbook that has limited abilities that can only pay so much it can only pay so much debt I don't care if it's the richest person in the world it can only pay so much much debt it can only do so much it can only buy so much it can only produce so much happiness and so much joy but I'm here to tell you we don't have that checkbook but we have a checkbook of unlimited resources of unlimited abilities it has enough power to heal every sick to save every loss to bring every prodical home Hallelujah it has the power right now to bring you out of your doldrums and back into the joy of the Holy Ghost it has the power to right now to raise you up out of your Affliction and it be over in a moment in a twinkling of an eye it's the word you speak it and he'll perform it it's done it's already done but no matter how great it is excuse me if you have a a checkbook if you don't ever write out a check how you figure you're ever going to get anything out of it if you don't have faith in it now my checkbook has limited Faith you're going to do just a few little things but I ain't talking about my checkbook or even brother Joe's checkbook he do a lot more but name brother brother Joe's checkbook or the richest person in here's checkbook I'm not talking about your checkbook I'm talking about the checkbook that's been given us by God if you won't write something out you don't have to sign your name it's already been signed you just got to fill it out and say God here it is take it up to the bank and see if it won't cash we know we know the the story of Abraham Lincoln that wrote out a pardon for a man that was doomed to a firing squad and his friend coming interceded and on his behalf and said my friend he didn't mean to do what he did and Abraham Lincoln was moved and he wrote out a pardon just on a little piece of paper and wrote his name on Abraham Lincoln this friend came back to the place where his where his b buddy was in the jail and he said look I got you pardon it's finished it's over with is done the man refused it because it wasn't maybe on the right kind of paper he thought or couldn't be a possible and refused a written out pardon by Abraham Lincoln and he goes and dies at a fire and Squad and they come out of the the with a judgment that said a pardon is only a pardon if it's accepted as a pardon the checkbook is only a checkbook if you act like it's a checkbook if you're willing to look into it and say God I have a need it's done it's finished cuz you have unlimited resources I don't have to fear this because you're here with me I don't have to worry about it because you're in control I don't have to look at it and worry how it's all going to work out I just know it's going to work out because you said it would and you accept it of How It's been done many times people look at things and say Well it don't come the way I thought it would come it well if it comes just accept it it can come in a little little package you know a little little man of short statue or tall statue or big statue or whatever but when God speaks something if you look at and say hey that's for me and you accept it as a pardon or as a need being fulfilled or or a desire then God will fulfill it it'll be done he he said tonight I read that God gives us all things he gives us a pardon it's a pardon to those who wants to accept God's word as a pardon just to read it doesn't mean you're pardon just to look at it does not mean you're pardon it means you have to accept it as your pardon that God had gave his son to die in your stad then it's a pardon then it's finished then you're released from the guilt a pardon from God is a release from the guilt not the Turning Away by psychology a PS psychological doctrine of some sort is to give you or give you a little feeling that you don't have what's right by joining a church or taking a c it's a release from your guilt by the power of Calvary something has released you there's no more guilt there's no more condemnation there's no more sin it is finished it is done it is over God has extended us so much Grace unmar Grace musicians
