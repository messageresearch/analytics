[13:22] hey man is that how you feel tonight
[13:24] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[13:26] there will be a standard raised you know
[13:29] I was thinking as you were singing that
[13:31] about turning up your praise and how
[13:33] often the devil likes to come to us
[13:36] especially young people but all of us
[13:37] and if we've had a bad week or a bad
[13:40] month or we've been struggling he wants
[13:42] to make us feel like we can't praise
[13:43] because that would be hypocritical but
[13:46] that's not the truth what he recognizes
[13:48] is that your praise is a weapon and he
[13:51] will try to hinder you from using that
[13:53] weapon and breaking forth in Praise
[13:55] anytime you're struggling break out your
[13:57] praise raise up that standard Don't Be
[14:00] Afraid don't don't be shy about it your
[14:02] God will receive it amen amen we thank
[14:05] you for coming out on this Friday
[14:07] evening thank you musicians appreciate
[14:09] it and the support means the world to us
[14:12] we we're super thankful for all the
[14:13] adults that come to support the youth
[14:15] tonight and
[14:16] and more importantly we're happy that he
[14:19] promised to be with us amen he said
[14:21] we're two or three are gathered and
[14:23] before we get straight into it before we
[14:26] go
[14:26] there are a couple of quick
[14:27] announcements I'd like to make before we
[14:30] read the word
[14:31] um
[14:31] they have a wedding shower here tomorrow

[15:13] brother Matt McGarry or one there about
[15:15] lodging if you need help reaching out to
[15:17] him I'll be glad to put you in touch so
[15:21] that's our announcements we just want to
[15:23] turn our attention now to to the church
[15:25] age study but let's let's start with
[15:27] with prayer
[15:28] father we love you and we thank you Lord
[15:30] for your goodness Lord for these youths
[15:32] Lord and all that are gathered here
[15:35] tonight Lord that have a hunger for you
[15:37] and a hunger for your word that so many
[15:39] things are going on in the world tonight
[15:41] on this Friday night maybe riotus living
[15:43] and different things parties and and
[15:46] things of the world and yet here's a
[15:47] group that said I want to hear from the
[15:49] Lord tonight Lord I thank you for that
[15:51] hunger and that desire because your word
[15:53] tells us that those that hunger and
[15:55] thirst shall be filled so Lord we come
[15:58] with that promise in Our Minds tonight
[15:59] knowing Lord that as we look at this
[16:01] it's not just history Lord but it's your
[16:03] word spoken Lord down through each and
[16:05] every age I pray you'll reveal it to us
[16:07] you'll open it up to us Lord that it'll
[16:09] speak to the hearts of your children
[16:10] tonight in the name of Jesus we pray
[16:12] amen
[16:14] amen if you do happen to have your
[16:17] Bibles with you tonight
[16:19] we're going to turn to the Book of
[16:20] Revelation 2 and we're going to read
[16:22] verses 8 through 11 Revelation 2 8
[16:24] through 11 and I want to reiterate what
[16:26] I've reiterated all along is that these
[16:29] Church age studies really are just
[16:31] supposed to be something extra to go
[16:34] along with your reading our desire is
[16:36] that you are reading the church age book
[16:38] yourself and I know life's busy I know
[16:41] we have a lot of things to do but we're
[16:42] doing these once a month and only
[16:44] covering about 20 pages I don't think
[16:46] it's too much to ask to get through 20
[16:47] pages in a month
[16:49] hopefully that's doable so we've kind of
[16:52] spread it out that way and hopefully
[16:53] it's allowed you to keep up and do the
[16:55] reading and then what we're doing is
[16:56] just trying to break it down and open it
[16:58] so the Lord can open it up to you so
[17:01] maybe you can have a greater
[17:02] understanding of what you're reading and
[17:03] as we as we read here
[17:07] and we go into this understand that
[17:10] these things are historical fact it is
[17:13] history but don't look at it just as
[17:16] history understand that that the devil
[17:20] never does away with those Spirits the
[17:22] spirits that attacked in these ages it
[17:25] may come in different forms but those
[17:26] same spirits still attack today the same
[17:29] thing still come against people today
[17:31] and so as you read the church age book
[17:33] as we talk about these things and you
[17:35] recognize those spirits and how they
[17:37] operated you can apply it even to today
[17:39] and how they're coming against the
[17:41] church today and how they're attacking
[17:43] in This Day verse 8 says and unto the
[17:46] angel of the church in Smyrna right
[17:49] these things saith the first and the
[17:51] last which was dead and is alive I Know
[17:55] Thy works and tribulation and poverty
[17:57] but Thou Art rich and I know the
[18:00] blasphemy of them which say they are
[18:02] Jews and are not but are the synagogue
[18:05] of Satan fear none of those things which
[18:07] thou shall suffer behold the devil shall
[18:11] cast some of you into prison that you
[18:13] may be tried you shall have tribulation
[18:15] 10 days be thou faithful unto death and
[18:19] I will give thee a Crown of Life he that
[18:21] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[18:24] saith unto the churches he that
[18:27] overcometh shall not be hurt of the
[18:30] second death amen I pray the Lord will
[18:32] add his Blessing to the reading as you
[18:34] have your seats this evening
[18:38] so we're going into
[18:41] this morning age or the or the second
[18:43] age the second of the seven
[18:45] and one thing we've learned about as
[18:47] we've gone down Through the Ages is a
[18:49] scriptural pattern and how brother
[18:51] Branham talked about there's a
[18:53] scriptural pattern that you can use to
[18:55] determine who who the messenger in each
[18:58] age was and he says using a history as
[19:02] our source we can find what men in each
[19:05] age were the closest to the original
[19:08] pattern and we know that we learned in
[19:11] the first age that the original pattern
[19:13] the original messenger was Apostle Paul
[19:15] and we learned that every messenger from
[19:18] that time on would be the ones at the
[19:20] most closely resembled the Apostle Paul
[19:23] and their teachings and in their beliefs
[19:25] in the way the spirit would move and
[19:27] things of that nature he is the pattern
[19:30] and so brother Branham says you we can
[19:32] use the histories to examine the
[19:35] ministries of those that God used to
[19:38] restore truth in other words it wouldn't
[19:41] just be one in each age that was
[19:43] preaching truth he says you use the
[19:46] pattern to examine all the ministries of
[19:48] those that God is using to restore
[19:50] restore truth he says and then out of
[19:53] those there would be one for every age
[19:57] who would stand out the clearest as the
[20:00] closest in word pattern and power that
[20:04] one would be the messenger now notice he
[20:07] doesn't just say in word pattern
[20:10] he says word pattern and Power
[20:13] there's things that you're going to have
[20:15] in every age where there's got to be a
[20:17] word pattern and power and that goes not
[20:19] only for the messenger but for the True
[20:21] Vine which ones when you look at the
[20:24] churches not only line up in word but
[20:27] also in power which church most closely
[20:30] resembles the one on the day of
[20:32] Pentecost in word and power and one
[20:37] thing the spirit likes to come in and do
[20:38] today that the spirit of the false Vine
[20:40] is try to get you to focus on just one
[20:42] of them
[20:43] the word or come in and just focus on
[20:46] the power we don't want to lean too
[20:48] heavy on either one of them you got to
[20:50] have two wings to fly is that right we
[20:52] got to have the word and we got to have
[20:54] the power and he says that one would be
[20:57] the messenger so not only can we find
[21:00] The Messengers in history but we also
[21:03] find the ages themselves down through
[21:05] history God would foretell in Revelation
[21:08] like we just read that was him
[21:09] foretelling about the Smyrna age he
[21:12] would foretell of each age in Revelation
[21:14] and he would tell us the condition of
[21:17] that age and since God cannot lie we
[21:20] know that to be the truth God cannot lie
[21:22] his word is the truth then what you will
[21:24] find is that the history of those ages
[21:27] will match up perfectly with the Bible
[21:30] description of that age you read in the
[21:33] Book of Revelation and describes an age
[21:35] and then go study the history of that
[21:37] age and it will match up perfectly
[21:39] because this is a prophecy God's saying
[21:41] this is how it's going to be and since
[21:43] he cannot lie it matches up perfectly
[21:46] brother Branham says it is that simple
[21:49] but then Simplicity is the key to the
[21:53] word
[21:55] now hear that sometimes oh it's so deep
[21:57] it's so this that brother Branham says
[21:59] Simplicity is the key to the word and so
[22:03] as we go through that we want to keep
[22:04] that in mind it is simplistic there is a
[22:07] pattern which one is it and as brother
[22:08] Branham looks through this
[22:10] he says using our god-given rule of
[22:13] choosing the messenger for each Age We
[22:16] unhesitatingly declare that irenius was
[22:20] exalted by the Lord to that position I'm
[22:25] so thankful tonight to know that that we
[22:27] can declare truth
[22:29] unhesitatingly this isn't something that
[22:32] we're guessing about this isn't
[22:33] something that well maybe this is true
[22:35] maybe this is right they talk about in
[22:37] the scripture as looking at it through a
[22:39] glass Darkly age after age after age
[22:42] people didn't know and they guessed and
[22:44] they probed and that was okay they were
[22:45] searching for truth but in this day a
[22:48] message came that made it to a weekend
[22:50] declare truth
[22:52] unhesitatingly it isn't guesswork it
[22:55] isn't I think this should be we have a
[22:58] restored truth it is a clear glass
[23:00] you're looking through it looking at it
[23:02] right in the face I think it's awesome
[23:05] that today we're studying about ages
[23:08] past and their Messengers and it's all
[23:12] and it's all possible because we have
[23:14] recognized and received the message in
[23:16] this day why can we even study that the
[23:19] ages past because of the message today
[23:20] why can we study what went on in that
[23:23] day and who the messenger was and what
[23:25] the condition was we wouldn't be able to
[23:27] do that but today there was a message
[23:29] today there was a messenger and because
[23:32] you've recognized your day and your
[23:34] message you can look back at the truths
[23:37] of past ages amen
[23:41] irenius was a disciple of one known as
[23:44] as polycarp and polycarp was actually a
[23:48] student of John the Revelator John that
[23:51] wrote the Book of Revelation and and
[23:54] polycarp himself was a great warrior of
[23:58] the faith and he even gave his life as a
[24:00] martyr
[24:02] the histories would declare that when
[24:04] irenius was led to the state to be
[24:06] burned
[24:07] he told them don't tie me to the stake
[24:10] leave my hands Unbound
[24:12] and he stood there Unbound and as they
[24:14] lit the Flames the fires rose up all
[24:17] around him but instead of coming and
[24:18] burning him it said the Flames all
[24:21] turned and went the other way they bent
[24:23] away from him and the Flames wouldn't
[24:24] touch him and then they became so
[24:26] irritated and angry about it that they
[24:28] ran up and actually stabbed him with a
[24:30] sword and when they did water gushed
[24:32] forth from his body and put out all the
[24:34] Flames that had been lit
[24:37] this man was a great Saint he was a
[24:40] great witness of the gospel and he was
[24:42] Gallant he was a Christian but brother
[24:44] Branham says it couldn't be polycarp he
[24:48] couldn't be the messenger because he
[24:50] actually leaned towards organization
[24:54] he wasn't brother Branham uses the term
[24:56] militant against it he actually leaned
[24:59] towards organization and so because of
[25:03] this he says he looks further he says
[25:05] irenius was militant against any form of
[25:08] organization he says Irene is stood
[25:11] solidly for a unified
[25:14] Spirit-filled gift manifesting local
[25:17] church and God honored him for the power
[25:21] of God manifested among the saints I
[25:25] love that God honored him because he
[25:27] stood for let's hear it again he stood
[25:30] for unified Spirit-filled gift
[25:33] manifested local church and God honored
[25:37] him I say I hope God will honor Us in
[25:40] this day as somebody that stands for a
[25:42] unified Spirit-filled Gift manifesting
[25:45] Church that still says if God honored it
[25:47] then God will honor it now if that's
[25:49] what God was looking for then that's
[25:51] what God is looking for now and we ought
[25:54] to be a church that matches that amen
[25:57] he says his churches in France were
[25:59] known to have the gifts of the Spirit
[26:02] among them notice how he's choosing who
[26:05] the messenger is
[26:06] how he's notice how he's he's showing
[26:09] what the true vine is
[26:11] gifts of the Spirit among them for the
[26:14] Saints spoke in tongues prophesied raise
[26:17] the dead and healed the Sick by the
[26:20] prayer of faith if time were to tarry
[26:23] and I know we believe this is the last
[26:24] age but I hope that they could look back
[26:26] and say in that day there was a church
[26:28] an evening like Tabernacle where the
[26:31] Saints spoke in tongues the gifts of the
[26:33] Spirit manifested among them they
[26:35] prophesied raised the dead and healed
[26:37] the Sick by the prayer of faith because
[26:39] every time down through the church age
[26:41] book this is how he identifies the
[26:43] messenger and the True Vine
[26:45] the word and the power
[26:48] every single time he says thus with his
[26:51] strict adherence to the word his
[26:53] wonderful understanding of scripture and
[26:56] so there's the word part
[26:58] and the attendance of the power of God
[27:02] upon that Ministry he is the right
[27:06] choice for the age
[27:10] so irenius
[27:11] is the right choice for the age of
[27:14] Smyrna
[27:15] now here I listed it once again we have
[27:17] all seven of the churches there
[27:20] that were in Asia Minor but we're
[27:22] talking about Smyrna if you'll look at
[27:23] it it's just north of Ephesus straight
[27:26] south from pergamum
[27:28] and you can see it's right there in a
[27:30] very nice Port protected from the
[27:32] weather tucked in and because of that it
[27:35] was known for its exports
[27:37] it was located you know right there on
[27:40] the sea in a nice Port it was known for
[27:42] its main expert of myrrh
[27:45] which was a bitter herb used in
[27:48] embalming
[27:50] and using embalming and it was also
[27:53] bitter myrrh was very very bitter as we
[27:55] said in its name Smyrna actually comes
[27:58] from myrrh and so therefore the the the
[28:02] age means bitter
[28:06] here you see pictures of it today it was
[28:08] known for its schools of rhetoric
[28:10] philosophy Medicine Science architecture
[28:15] but the people there as advanced as they
[28:17] were in these worldly things the
[28:19] population there uh Smyrna was
[28:22] vehemently opposed to Christianity
[28:25] Smyrna as we said means bitter and
[28:27] brother Branham tells us that it was a
[28:29] bitter age filled with death
[28:31] and during this time the two vines that
[28:34] we've been speaking of since the very
[28:35] beginning the vines that we took all the
[28:37] way back to the Book of Genesis last
[28:39] time they began to drift further and
[28:41] further apart and it began to make the
[28:43] hatred and the bitterness
[28:45] towards the True Vine grow more and more
[28:48] the false Vine began to hate the True
[28:51] Vine with more passion and more Venom
[28:54] and it was also in this time even that
[28:57] the True Vine even though it was true it
[29:00] was experience a little bit of what
[29:01] brother Branham called paralysis
[29:03] he says for the True Vine began to drift
[29:06] further and further away from the
[29:09] unadulterated truths of Pentecost
[29:13] and see that's why even in this age that
[29:15] we had to have a restoration
[29:17] we had to have a restoration of truth
[29:19] because even the True Vine even though
[29:21] they were holding on to as much truth as
[29:23] they possibly could with each age it
[29:26] drifted a little bit further away and
[29:28] more Darkness came in and then a little
[29:30] bit further away and more Darkness came
[29:32] in and even though they were true the
[29:34] things that were lost down Through the
[29:36] Ages wasn't known to them even though
[29:38] they were holding on with all that they
[29:40] knew so much had been lost that there
[29:41] had to be a restoration in this day
[29:45] and in this age here this morning age
[29:47] organization was growing fast as man
[29:50] began to follow after Creeds they began
[29:53] to follow after the ideas of man and
[29:55] Holy Ghost leadership began to be pushed
[29:58] aside
[29:58] Holy Ghost leadership began to be done
[30:01] away with at a very rapid pace and
[30:04] man-made rituals now stood there in its
[30:07] place
[30:14] the salutation
[30:16] Revelation 2 and 8 and unto the angel of
[30:19] the church in Smyrna right
[30:22] these things saith the first and the
[30:25] last now notice which was dead
[30:29] and is alive we want to focus in on that
[30:31] little part there for just a second
[30:33] which was dead
[30:35] and is alive brother Branham keys in on
[30:37] this and he says it makes it very
[30:39] obvious that this isn't a mortal man
[30:41] that is speaking to the church here
[30:43] he says it makes it very obvious because
[30:45] not only does he say I am the first and
[30:47] the last but this very thing speaks of
[30:50] the Resurrection it speaks of the
[30:53] resurrection of Christ because the order
[30:54] of events of a regular human being would
[30:57] say I was alive
[31:00] but am now dead
[31:02] and they would have to be speaking from
[31:04] the grave but he says this one here is
[31:06] speaking of of a man that is resurrected
[31:10] it's speaking of deity because he says I
[31:13] once went into the grave I once was dead
[31:16] but now I'm Alive forevermore aren't you
[31:19] glad the day that we serve a risen
[31:21] savior that we're not serving a dead God
[31:23] it's not just a dead religion but he
[31:25] says I once was dead why was he dead for
[31:28] you why did he shed his blood for you
[31:30] but he didn't stay there he said no sir
[31:33] I'm going to rise again that I can send
[31:35] my spirit back that not only did I
[31:37] overcome but you can overcome by The
[31:39] Same Spirit that I overcame with I once
[31:42] was dead but now I'm alive and there's
[31:44] young people sitting here today that can
[31:46] say the exact same thing I once was dead
[31:49] but praise God because of that because
[31:51] of his Spirit coming back now I'm Alive
[31:54] forevermore amen
[31:57] so I went to the grave but now I'm alive
[32:00] so who are who's speaking this is the
[32:02] second Adam
[32:03] this is deity
[32:06] this is the one that's come the Lord
[32:08] Jesus to restore everything that Adam
[32:11] lost
[32:12] where Adam brought death this Adam
[32:15] brings life
[32:17] where Adam took a wonderful paradise and
[32:20] turned it into a Wilderness this Adam
[32:22] the second Adam comes and he's taking us
[32:24] back to Eden again this is the restorer
[32:27] of all things the fall may be sentenced
[32:30] us to death Adam's mistakes Adam's false
[32:33] sentences to death but by this Adam's
[32:35] death we have been granted eternal life
[32:37] and life forevermore amen this is deity
[32:41] speaking here in this age
[32:52] Mike can you come help me real quick
[32:54] please sir
[32:56] amen which was dead
[33:00] and is alive
[33:05] just making sure Mike's awake with us
[33:07] tonight no I'm kidding
[33:14] if you take the first stage the
[33:16] salutation from the first age
[33:18] and we're going back to what we studied
[33:20] last time he said these things say it he
[33:22] that holds the Seven Stars in his right
[33:25] hands now not to embarrass him put you
[33:28] on the spot but I just want to see we
[33:29] can do it as a group if you remember
[33:31] what did the Seven stars represent they
[33:34] were the seven
[33:36] very good they are the seven Messengers
[33:39] Seven Stars in his right hand it says
[33:42] and he walks in the midst of the
[33:44] churches and this showed us that he
[33:46] hasn't left the church alone he's
[33:48] walking through every age the the same
[33:50] Jesus that was there in the first age is
[33:52] with us in the last age and he's walking
[33:54] in the midst
[33:56] of his churches this is one in the same
[33:59] person and he's showing us that this is
[34:01] his church and he is in the midst of it
[34:04] but if we take that and we combine the
[34:06] salutation with the second age it would
[34:08] read like this
[34:10] these things saith he that holds the
[34:12] Seven Stars in his right hand and walks
[34:14] in the midst of the churches these
[34:16] things saith the first and the last
[34:18] which was dead and is alive this is the
[34:21] same person speaking to both ages and
[34:24] he's showing that he's in the midst of
[34:26] the second age just like he was in the
[34:27] midst of the first age and brother
[34:30] Brandon would say this is just like the
[34:32] seed that is in the midst of the fruit
[34:33] he said the seed that has the life in it
[34:36] is in the middle of the fruit and he
[34:38] said here the one with life in him is in
[34:40] the middle of the church he's there in
[34:42] the midst of the church bringing forth
[34:44] life Just Like a Shepherd watches over A
[34:47] Flock here is the chief Shepherd
[34:49] watching over his own it was his blood
[34:53] that paid the price and and that bought
[34:55] this church it was his blood that bought
[34:57] you and now he's the one who cares for
[35:00] his church and watches over his church
[35:03] why why is he so interested in you why
[35:06] is he so interested in the church
[35:07] because he paid a great price for it
[35:09] because he bought you because you were
[35:12] his and you belonged to him and he
[35:15] doesn't like it when a man or anybody
[35:17] comes in and tries to manhandle his
[35:19] church he doesn't like it when people
[35:22] come in and try to take control
[35:24] you know with with the great price that
[35:28] he paid with all that he gave for the
[35:30] church even though he knew and his
[35:32] foreknowledge is so great and perfect
[35:33] you know as he sees the church begin to
[35:36] to fall away and pull away it must be
[35:38] heartbreaking for him
[35:40] the ones that that he sent his Spirit
[35:42] back for on the day of Pentecost and now
[35:44] only an age later and they're beginning
[35:46] to reject that Spirit the very reason
[35:48] for the death burial and Resurrection so
[35:50] that that Spirit could come and end
[35:52] dwell men and now slowly they're
[35:54] starting to turn that down they're
[35:56] starting to turn away and go after other
[35:57] things just like Israel had always done
[35:59] throughout the Old Testament you know
[36:01] this has to to hurt him and it's and
[36:03] it's displeasing and hurtful falling
[36:06] away just as Israel always did
[36:09] but in every age he comes and introduces
[36:12] himself and makes himself known as deity
[36:16] each and every time and brother Brown
[36:19] says this is a dual purpose because it
[36:22] comes to comfort his church don't worry
[36:25] I'm deity I'm almighty God I'm walking
[36:28] with you I'm taking care of it I'm
[36:31] supplying your need but not only is it a
[36:33] comfort to the True Vine it is a warning
[36:36] to the false Vine I am God I am deeded
[36:40] deity don't think you're getting away
[36:41] with one thing everything you do to the
[36:44] True Vine will be recompensed everything
[36:46] will be paid back and poured out upon
[36:48] your head yes I'm here to comfort you
[36:50] but I'm here to warn the false Vine keep
[36:53] your hands off the True Vine
[36:55] I'm he's there it's it's a warning I am
[36:58] the one and true
[37:00] almighty God
[37:04] conditions of the age
[37:07] Revelation 2 and 9.
[37:10] it says I Know Thy Works in that
[37:12] tribulation and poverty but Thou Art
[37:15] rich
[37:17] and I know the blasphemy of them which
[37:19] say they are Jews and are not but are of
[37:22] the synagogue of Satan
[37:26] this age is marked by tribulation
[37:30] he says I Know Thy works and thy
[37:32] tribulation
[37:34] and the Lord says
[37:36] I know
[37:38] once again there's a reference back to
[37:40] I'm in the midst of the church I'm not
[37:42] off somewhere not paying attention I
[37:45] know exactly what it is you're going
[37:46] through
[37:47] I know the blasphemy I know the
[37:50] tribulation I know and he constantly
[37:52] says I know
[37:54] but does he stop it
[37:56] does he stop the tribulation
[37:59] does he stop him from being thrown into
[38:01] prison
[38:02] does he stop him from being fed the
[38:04] Lions
[38:06] no
[38:08] he just says I know
[38:11] I know that's what's happening
[38:13] I know that's what's going on I'm not
[38:16] unaware and this is often something that
[38:18] people struggle with
[38:20] how can God be a loving God and Stand By
[38:24] and Watch all this suffering
[38:25] how can he claim to be a loving God and
[38:28] stand by and watch me going through what
[38:29] I'm going through and not do anything
[38:31] how come he didn't heal this one how
[38:34] come he didn't stop this trial how come
[38:37] you're letting this go on and and you
[38:39] see my pain you see my suffering and you
[38:41] see my death
[38:43] and then people even begin to say does
[38:45] God even love me
[38:47] look at all that I've gone through look
[38:50] at my pain look at my suffering look at
[38:52] my lonely nights look at my hurts does
[38:54] God even love me
[38:59] brother Branham said
[39:01] this quote comes right after he said
[39:03] people believe that God's love is like a
[39:05] parent protecting a baby that won't let
[39:07] anything happen to that baby he says but
[39:10] God said that his love was elective love
[39:14] the proof that God loves you or the
[39:17] proof of his love is election no matter
[39:20] what happened his love was proven truly
[39:24] by the fact that they were chosen unto
[39:27] salvation
[39:28] it doesn't matter what happens to you
[39:30] today what happened to you yesterday or
[39:33] what you go through next week you have
[39:35] been chosen for salvation that is the
[39:38] proof of his Love This Love This Love of
[39:40] God doesn't mean no suffering but the
[39:43] proof of God stands in election he chose
[39:47] you he died for you he saved you
[39:50] therefore he loves you
[39:53] it doesn't matter what all you go
[39:56] through
[39:56] brother Branham says he may commit you
[39:58] to death as he did Paul
[40:01] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[40:04] job that is his prerogative
[40:08] he is Sovereign but it is all with a
[40:12] purpose at the end of the day this is
[40:14] the shortest amount of time you're going
[40:16] to live anywhere
[40:18] and the things that you go through here
[40:20] on this Earth as the word tells us they
[40:22] don't even they're not even worthy to be
[40:24] compared to the glory that awaits you
[40:26] they're not even worthy to be compared
[40:28] to the eternity that awaits you let's
[40:31] stop taking every day little things or
[40:34] big things whatever it may be and saying
[40:36] does God love me
[40:38] when he was willing to leave all of
[40:39] heaven and come down and shed his blood
[40:42] that you could be with him forever there
[40:46] is no greater proof of God's love than
[40:48] his election on your life
[40:54] he says
[40:57] the last one ended with I want to go
[40:59] back to it ended with
[41:01] that I read he is Sovereign but it is
[41:03] all with a purpose
[41:05] if he did not have a purpose
[41:08] then he would be the author of
[41:10] frustration and not of Peace his purpose
[41:14] now listen close because we'll be here
[41:16] for just a second
[41:17] is that after we have suffered a while
[41:20] we would be made perfect
[41:24] be established
[41:25] strengthened
[41:27] and settled Hebrews 5 8 9 says though he
[41:31] were a son now he's talking about Jesus
[41:33] the one that we say was the perfect one
[41:35] without sin
[41:37] perfect and it says though he were a son
[41:40] yet learned he obedience
[41:45] learned he obedience by the things which
[41:49] he suffered
[41:50] and being made perfect he became the
[41:54] author of Eternal salvation unto all
[41:57] them that obey him what's he saying here
[42:00] the very character of Jesus Christ was
[42:04] perfected by suffering
[42:07] and yet we wonder why am I going through
[42:09] this Lord
[42:11] if Jesus Christ if his character had to
[42:14] be perfected by suffering you think
[42:16] you're going to get there with anything
[42:18] less
[42:20] he said his very character was perfected
[42:23] by suffering the things that we go
[42:25] through ART to break us but they are to
[42:27] mold us and make us into the image that
[42:30] he wants you to be in
[42:33] Paul suffered
[42:35] great things go read the life of Paul
[42:38] he goes through so many things over and
[42:40] over and over and over and then he says
[42:42] but nothing can separate me from the
[42:43] love of God
[42:45] job suffered
[42:47] Jesus suffered there's going to be
[42:51] suffering but it is with a purpose
[42:54] James 1 2 through 4 says my brethren
[42:56] count it all joy when you fall into
[43:00] diverse Temptations
[43:02] it's hard to do
[43:04] it is the worst day of my life thank you
[43:06] Lord
[43:08] this is awesome
[43:11] I have fallen short if that's how you're
[43:13] supposed to respond to it
[43:15] but it says count it all joy
[43:18] and then it says knowing this that the
[43:21] trying of your faith worketh patience
[43:25] but he says it's not just to work
[43:27] patients there's more to it then let
[43:29] patients have her perfect work that ye
[43:32] may be perfect an entire wanting nothing
[43:38] why am I going through this why doesn't
[43:40] he step in and stop it because he has a
[43:43] vision of what you're going to be when
[43:44] you get through it on the other side
[43:46] there's something he's molding you into
[43:48] there's something he's making you into
[43:50] why does he stand by
[43:52] why do we suffer
[43:55] because it's for our molding that our
[43:57] character will come to a place that our
[44:00] character is fit to reign
[44:02] he doesn't just want you to remain down
[44:04] here forever he wants you to reign with
[44:08] him but in order to reign with him your
[44:10] character must be fit
[44:13] to Reign Romans 8
[44:17] 17-18 says and if children then heirs
[44:20] Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ
[44:23] if so be that we suffer with him
[44:27] that we may that we may be also
[44:30] glorified together for I reckon that the
[44:32] sufferings of this present time are not
[44:35] worthy to be compared with the glory
[44:37] which shall be revealed in us why do we
[44:41] suffer with him because he wants us to
[44:44] reign with him
[44:45] there is a purpose in it brother Brown
[44:47] says unless we suffer with him we cannot
[44:51] reign with him you have to suffer to
[44:55] reign
[44:56] when you're suffering when you're
[44:57] struggling when you're battling just
[44:59] recognize I'm gonna rain I'm gonna rain
[45:01] there's a purpose for this there's a
[45:03] purpose for this attack there's a
[45:04] purpose for this trial and the thing is
[45:07] to make sure that we find the purpose in
[45:08] our trial don't let the trial be
[45:11] meaningless and come out angry and
[45:13] bitter therefore you got to go through
[45:14] another trial to fix the anger in the
[45:16] bidder
[45:18] let the trial have its purpose let
[45:21] patience do its work
[45:23] let it serve its purpose let everything
[45:26] that I go through have its perfect
[45:28] perfect work that way it's not in vain I
[45:30] don't want to go through things in vain
[45:34] but I want to come through them as gold
[45:37] tried in the fire with all the
[45:39] imperfections and the things on the
[45:41] other side burn out of my life all the
[45:43] impurities and things worked out of my
[45:46] life amen there's a reason for the
[45:48] suffering
[45:49] because character is a victory
[45:53] prophet of God says the reason for this
[45:55] is that character simply is never made
[45:57] without suffering
[46:00] listen I know it can happen this is sort
[46:02] of a blanket statement but in general
[46:03] you find somebody that was raised with a
[46:06] silver spoon in their mouth given
[46:08] everything never had to work in a day in
[46:10] their life never went through anything
[46:11] raised up with everything just given
[46:13] giving giving giving giving and they
[46:16] usually have pretty terrible character
[46:19] because they never went through anything
[46:21] to allow that character to be developed
[46:23] in their life
[46:25] he wants to share his throne with you
[46:28] that's why first Peter 4 12 says beloved
[46:30] think it's not strange concerning the
[46:33] fiery trial which is to try you
[46:37] it's not strange that he wants you to
[46:39] reign with him and in order to get there
[46:41] you're going to have to overcome some
[46:43] things
[46:44] in order to Reign you must first
[46:46] overcome think about it how did Jesus
[46:49] get his throne
[46:53] how did he get his throne
[46:55] Revelation 3 21 says to him that
[46:58] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[46:59] in my throne even as I also overcame in
[47:04] him sat down with my father in his
[47:05] throne he got it by overcoming
[47:09] he says and I want you to sit on a
[47:11] throne and you're going to overcome in
[47:13] order to get that Throne you're gonna go
[47:16] through things you're gonna fight things
[47:17] you're gonna come up against things that
[47:19] you don't know how I'm gonna make it
[47:20] through how I'm gonna get through this
[47:21] you're going to have days where you
[47:23] think you're gonna quit but you're not
[47:25] you're going to push through you're
[47:26] going to battle through you're gonna
[47:27] come out as gold you're gonna come out
[47:29] perfected you're going to come out as
[47:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ because the
[47:33] marriage of the Lamb has come in his
[47:35] bride hath made herself ready and then
[47:38] you're going to sit down in his throne
[47:40] and reign with him
[47:43] God wants Christ like character and
[47:47] christ-like character comes through
[47:49] suffering and trials
[47:51] and none of us like to hear that
[47:54] but it's the truth
[47:56] and that's what brother Brown is doing
[47:58] here is he's placing this he says the
[48:00] church now listen to this
[48:02] this is good because we go through
[48:04] battles
[48:05] he says the church that is not suffering
[48:09] and is not being tried hasn't got it
[48:13] the church that is not suffering and is
[48:16] not being tried hasn't got it it isn't
[48:21] of God
[48:23] that's pretty straightforward
[48:25] Hebrews 12 and 6 says for whom the Lord
[48:28] loveth
[48:29] he chasteneth
[48:31] Lord don't love me I'm going through
[48:33] this is no it's proof that he does
[48:37] whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[48:40] scourgeth
[48:42] discouraging is not fun it hurts it's
[48:44] painful but if God loves you
[48:46] he chasteneth and scourgeth every son
[48:50] whom he receiveth
[48:54] don't let the devil come to you because
[48:56] it's something that he does to all of us
[48:59] and when you go through trial after
[49:00] trial and hardship after hardship he'll
[49:02] begin to come to you and say you've done
[49:04] things wrong
[49:05] that's why you're going through this you
[49:07] stumbled you messed up and so because of
[49:10] this God is punishing you and because of
[49:13] this you're going through that he loves
[49:14] to beat us up on that kind of stuff but
[49:16] Peter says no think it's not strange
[49:19] that you're going through these trials
[49:20] there's quit giving it so many quick
[49:22] you're thinking too much
[49:24] you're thinking about too much you're
[49:26] worrying about it too much God is using
[49:28] this trial to mold character that is
[49:32] worthy to rule church that's what I want
[49:34] I want to rule with him I want to live
[49:36] eternally with him I want to be in
[49:37] heaven with him so whatever I have to go
[49:40] through here Lord whatever it takes to
[49:42] get me ready for that I'm ready for it
[49:44] I'm ready to go through it I may not
[49:46] like it it may hurt I may not see it
[49:48] coming it may destroy this flesh but if
[49:50] that's what it takes to get me over
[49:52] there then I will take it Lord because
[49:54] I'm not worried about things here near
[49:57] as much as I'm worried about things
[49:59] there I want to be there I want my
[50:02] character right to be raptured I want my
[50:04] character right to grab a body change I
[50:06] want my character right that if I go by
[50:08] the way of the Grave I come up in a
[50:10] resurrection and whatever it takes Lord
[50:13] just let me be ready
[50:15] just let my character match your
[50:18] character
[50:20] brother Branham goes on and says right
[50:22] here
[50:24] the Cloudy Skies
[50:26] and storms of life are no sign of God's
[50:30] disapproval
[50:31] wow
[50:33] the devil sure won't tell you that
[50:36] he'll beat you all over the place with
[50:38] the trials and things you're going
[50:39] through he said it's not a sign of God's
[50:40] disapproval otherwise God was this
[50:43] disapproving of job
[50:46] think about that not only did God allow
[50:49] what happened to job
[50:50] God suggested it
[50:54] so it has nothing to do with his
[50:56] approval
[50:58] but then here's the other side
[51:00] don't get so caught up in people's
[51:01] success or your own success or your own
[51:04] perfect life
[51:06] because things can change like that
[51:09] because he says neither are bright skies
[51:11] and Still Waters signs of his love and
[51:14] approval
[51:15] his approval of any of us is only in the
[51:19] Beloved
[51:20] he approves you because he approved the
[51:22] sacrifice
[51:23] he approves you because he's looking at
[51:25] you through the blood he approves you
[51:27] because of election
[51:29] he says his love is elective which he
[51:32] had for us before the foundation of the
[51:34] world does he love us oh yes but how
[51:37] shall we know
[51:39] we shall know because he said so
[51:46] and manifested that he did love us for
[51:48] he brought us to himself and gave us of
[51:51] his Spirit placing us
[51:53] as Sons
[51:55] am I accepted yes you're accepted was it
[51:57] because I did this and after the Youth
[52:00] Camp I hadn't messed up for a month and
[52:01] I've been lip
[52:04] you're accepted because the sacrifice
[52:06] was accepted
[52:07] you're accepted because it's under the
[52:09] blood
[52:10] you're accepted because he loves you how
[52:14] do I know that he loves me because he
[52:15] because he said he did
[52:18] how do I know that it's all going to
[52:19] work out because he said it would
[52:22] but how do I know because his word
[52:24] declares it and in the heart of a
[52:26] believer that settles it
[52:29] look and I've heard a lot of testimonies
[52:31] from young and old Delight where people
[52:32] get to the place where they say things
[52:34] like I was wondering does God even love
[52:37] me
[52:39] listen if God never answers another one
[52:42] of your prayers
[52:44] if he turns his back on you today and
[52:46] never speaks to you again
[52:49] to where you can literally say like
[52:50] Jesus did why hath you forsaken me
[52:54] then you have no right even then to
[52:57] question his love for you
[52:59] he's done enough through election
[53:02] he's done enough in that he has saved
[53:05] you he's done enough and that he's
[53:07] coming for you he's done enough and that
[53:09] he's going to change your body and that
[53:11] you're going to overcome and you're
[53:13] going to sit on the throne with him we
[53:14] don't got to have something special
[53:16] every week every other day we ain't got
[53:18] to have voices rain down from heaven we
[53:20] ain't got to feel chills We Ain't Gotta
[53:21] Have Nothing although I sure love it
[53:23] when those things happen
[53:25] Lord speak to me right now and our voice
[53:27] from Heaven I want those things I want
[53:29] chills
[53:30] I know that's just a bump on yourself I
[53:32] like it I'm all about it I want to see
[53:35] rejoicing and Shout I want to feel him
[53:37] near but if he never does another thing
[53:39] for me I know he loves me I know he
[53:42] cares for me I know that I'm going to be
[53:45] there how do you know his word declares
[53:47] it he said it and that settles it he
[53:51] loves you amen
[53:58] see he knows what it is we need
[54:02] young people old people alike but we
[54:05] used to have this big debate every year
[54:07] when I would teach Civics to middle
[54:08] schoolers about needs and wants
[54:11] and I would put columns up there and say
[54:13] needs and wants and go up there and
[54:14] write things you need
[54:17] they never get it right
[54:19] let me tell you one that blows your mind
[54:21] none of us need a phone
[54:25] it's not a need
[54:27] none of us
[54:29] this is hard to say need
[54:33] a car
[54:35] because the definition of needs is
[54:38] essential to life
[54:39] food clothing shelter that's literally
[54:42] the only three needs there are
[54:43] physically anything else is they want
[54:45] now if you want a decent life with some
[54:48] comfortable then there's lots of things
[54:50] I want
[54:52] okay and there's nothing wrong with
[54:54] wants wants are fine but understand this
[54:57] God never said he was there to fulfill
[54:59] all your wants
[55:03] he's there to take care of your needs
[55:06] uh he's and he understands what it is we
[55:09] need more than we understand what we
[55:12] need so even though it seems harsh that
[55:14] God would stand there and look upon his
[55:16] children in a time of need and not just
[55:18] stop it he knows what you need more than
[55:21] you know what you need for your
[55:25] Eternal benefits
[55:26] we've covered this before but there's
[55:28] times where you look at the scripture
[55:29] Romans 8 28 and it says that all things
[55:31] work together for good and you have no
[55:33] idea how it's possible
[55:36] that this horrible thing that just
[55:38] happened
[55:39] or this trial or this run of bad luck is
[55:43] working out for your good
[55:45] but it's because we look at it through
[55:47] Earthly eyes and we're thinking about
[55:48] our Earthly good he isn't concerned
[55:51] about that
[55:52] when he says he's going to work it out
[55:53] for your goodies talking about eternally
[55:56] it is for your Eternal good it is
[56:00] working to make sure that no matter what
[56:01] happens here you make it there
[56:04] it is for your good
[56:08] brother Brown says see him walking up
[56:09] and down in the midst of his church like
[56:12] a father he is looking down upon his
[56:14] family
[56:15] and he's the provider
[56:17] and he's the protector and yet all this
[56:20] stuff's happening what kind of Provider
[56:22] what kind of protector he knows what
[56:24] they need
[56:26] not what they want
[56:29] brother Brown says these physical things
[56:31] are not the true basic necessities of
[56:35] your life
[56:36] for a man's life consisted consists not
[56:40] of the things he possesses
[56:43] a man's life hear this clear
[56:47] because if there's one thing that I I
[56:49] started to be too harsh let's not be too
[56:52] harsh if there's one thing that irks me
[56:55] that I have a hard time tolerating is
[56:58] materialistic people
[57:00] that gets so high and low off of
[57:03] material things
[57:05] your material things should never change
[57:09] the plane of your attitude or your joy
[57:11] or your happiness or your joy and your
[57:14] happiness is based in the wrong things
[57:18] but Aaron
[57:19] period
[57:22] that's not debatable if your material
[57:25] things affect your joy and happiness
[57:27] then your Treasures are not laid up in
[57:28] the right place
[57:29] that doesn't mean let me come back
[57:32] because some people can't balance it
[57:33] themselves that doesn't mean you can't
[57:35] have a horrible month and be down about
[57:37] it okay I'm talking about that you're
[57:39] not on a roller coaster of emotion all
[57:41] the time based off of
[57:43] material things
[57:46] sure if my car breaks down tomorrow I'm
[57:48] not gonna be excited
[57:50] yes I'm gonna wish that hadn't happened
[57:52] you understand what I'm saying but if it
[57:54] affects your joy to the point that you
[57:56] can't come to the house of God and
[57:57] worship and praise and look on things
[57:59] knowing he's going to take care of you
[58:01] because he's the provider then your
[58:03] trust and Faith and Hope and Joy's in
[58:05] the wrong place okay maybe that brought
[58:07] it a little clearer because it's not
[58:09] about material wealth and material
[58:12] things brother Brown says that God's
[58:14] people are not Material minded
[58:17] they're not Material reminded because
[58:19] they recognize that to be rich in the
[58:22] spirit and to be rich in the things of
[58:24] God is true treasure and true wealth he
[58:29] said it is not Material it is within us
[58:33] a rich man is rich in God not in worldly
[58:38] things so the spirit if we go back to
[58:41] our original scripture he's talking to
[58:43] me he says I see thy poverty and in
[58:46] parentheses he says but thou are rich
[58:49] one is material
[58:51] one is spiritual I see your poverty but
[58:55] you're rich
[58:56] now a carnal man might would choose the
[58:58] wrong one there but if I have to place
[58:59] myself in one of those two I say Lord I
[59:02] will be materially poor every day of my
[59:04] life as long as I can be rich in the
[59:06] spirit as long as I can have more of you
[59:08] as long as I know that my treasures are
[59:10] waiting for me in heaven as long as
[59:12] listen I don't want to be poor in the
[59:13] spirit I don't want to be poor and dried
[59:16] up and carnal and formal and have no
[59:18] Spirit about Lord I want you to pour it
[59:20] out on me I don't care about the
[59:22] material aspect now Lord if you want to
[59:23] give me a few things that's okay I'll
[59:25] take it
[59:27] but that's not where our focus is to be
[59:29] is to be rich spirit this in the spirit
[59:33] the spirit says I see
[59:35] what you were being put through I see
[59:38] that you have no possessions I see
[59:40] you're being made fun of I see you're
[59:41] being cast out but in spite of all that
[59:44] you are rich
[59:47] he says you have Treasures laid up in
[59:49] eternity you have Eternal Treasures that
[59:51] far exceed any material blessing you
[59:54] could ever have here on Earth because
[59:56] this stuff right here will burn but the
[1:00:00] victory of your character is eternal the
[1:00:03] victory of your character Will Roll On
[1:00:05] Through the Ages after ages after ages
[1:00:07] while everything you ever earned and
[1:00:09] worked for and built and accumulated
[1:00:12] burns your character will live on
[1:00:14] forever and ever and ever you make sure
[1:00:16] you're rich in the character of the Lord
[1:00:19] Jesus Christ
[1:00:22] synagogue of Satan
[1:00:25] brother Branham tells us to pay close
[1:00:27] attention to this verse not only just
[1:00:29] for the contents of it he says he says
[1:00:31] but also because it's repeated in
[1:00:34] another age over a thousand years later
[1:00:36] so it'll come back around he says
[1:00:38] Revelation 2 and 9. I know the blasphemy
[1:00:41] of him
[1:00:42] which say they are Jews and are not but
[1:00:46] are the synagogue
[1:00:48] of Satan now Jews here does not refer to
[1:00:52] the religion
[1:00:53] and for some reason I put the word but
[1:00:55] twice
[1:00:56] but but
[1:00:59] to the people of Judah
[1:01:01] in other words Jews by birth not Jews
[1:01:04] because of of the religion he tells us
[1:01:07] that there are people in this age that
[1:01:10] are claiming to be Jewish claiming to be
[1:01:13] Jews and yet they're Liars
[1:01:16] he says I know the blasphemy of them
[1:01:18] which say they are Jews and are not
[1:01:21] he says they're Liars they're not Jews
[1:01:24] they're not Jews by birth brother
[1:01:25] Branham says and they're not Jews by
[1:01:27] religion he says they are the synagogue
[1:01:31] of Satan so who are they why would they
[1:01:35] lie about being a Jew
[1:01:38] well one thing we know is that the early
[1:01:40] the early church was consisted mainly of
[1:01:43] of Jews we know that the the false Vine
[1:01:49] we know that the the false Vine
[1:01:52] we know that they are of the false Vine
[1:01:54] because that brother Branham says they
[1:01:56] are the synagogue of Satan but why lie
[1:01:59] what do they gain
[1:02:00] and as I said because the early church
[1:02:02] was mostly Jews Jews were the original
[1:02:04] members the apostles were Jews so why
[1:02:08] are they lying about being Jews because
[1:02:10] it gives them Prestige because it
[1:02:13] connects them to the original
[1:02:15] they don't want the original life
[1:02:18] they don't want that Holy Ghost coming
[1:02:20] in and changing them and making them all
[1:02:21] act fanatical but they want to tie
[1:02:24] themselves in claim to be the original
[1:02:27] and so they claim to be Jews it's the
[1:02:30] exact same tactic brother Brown says
[1:02:31] that the Catholic Church would use tell
[1:02:34] a lie and stick to it no matter what the
[1:02:36] history book says no matter if if people
[1:02:38] know it's not true just claim we're the
[1:02:40] original we're the original we're the
[1:02:43] original and just repeat that lie over
[1:02:45] and over and over and stick to it
[1:02:48] they claim that to have the keys to the
[1:02:50] kingdom because Peter was the first pope
[1:02:52] they claim to be the mouse piece of
[1:02:54] mouth peace of God
[1:02:56] and he says
[1:02:58] I know the blasphemy
[1:03:00] I know what they claim and they are not
[1:03:04] I know what they're claiming to be but
[1:03:06] they're not
[1:03:07] he says he says it here again I know the
[1:03:10] blasphemy of them would say they are
[1:03:12] Jews and are not but are of the
[1:03:14] synagogue of Satan so what we see in
[1:03:17] this age is the Antichrist spirit is
[1:03:19] growing
[1:03:20] and we've been following that false Vine
[1:03:22] all the way back since the garden
[1:03:25] but now this same group that claims to
[1:03:27] be to be of the Jews the false Vine is
[1:03:29] infiltrating it's granting more hold in
[1:03:32] the church and it's claiming to be the
[1:03:34] original is claiming to be Jews but God
[1:03:36] says you're Liars
[1:03:39] and they're seeking the the they're
[1:03:42] seeking the power and The Prestige of
[1:03:44] the church
[1:03:45] they want that power but they don't have
[1:03:47] any desire for the life
[1:03:49] they want the prestige but they don't
[1:03:51] want to change they don't want the
[1:03:53] spirit of Christ
[1:03:55] in this spirit this false Vine begins to
[1:03:57] inch its way in and it came in by the
[1:04:00] Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:04:02] but now it's no longer hiding
[1:04:04] now it's no longer so subtle now that
[1:04:07] they've come out and they've gotten bold
[1:04:09] and brother Brown says they've begun to
[1:04:10] organize in this age and they're
[1:04:12] standing there in the face of the True
[1:04:14] Vine look in the truth in the eyes and
[1:04:17] saying we're the truth we're the
[1:04:20] original we're the ones your Heretics
[1:04:23] your man followers
[1:04:26] that's a cult
[1:04:27] and they stand there with all their
[1:04:29] false Traditions with all their false
[1:04:32] doctrines and they point out the true
[1:04:34] and call it the false
[1:04:36] and it's no longer hidden but it's right
[1:04:39] there in the open openly defying the
[1:04:43] True Vine
[1:04:45] but don't think now I know we're
[1:04:47] studying the church ages and we begin to
[1:04:49] talk about the false Vine
[1:04:51] but that doesn't didn't just start in
[1:04:53] the church ages we took that all the way
[1:04:54] back to the Garden the Antichrist Spirit
[1:04:56] has been here all along we saw it in in
[1:04:59] the children of Israel as it manifested
[1:05:01] itself in the wilderness
[1:05:04] because the Antichrist Spirit Wars
[1:05:06] against God it tries to take over the
[1:05:08] church brother Branham says here just as
[1:05:10] the early church started out under the
[1:05:12] pure Ministry now notice we're going to
[1:05:13] go back to where we started every time
[1:05:16] that he points to the True Vine
[1:05:18] he takes it back to Pentecost
[1:05:21] he says just as the early church started
[1:05:24] out under the pure Ministry of the Holy
[1:05:26] Spirit
[1:05:27] with its pure Ministry of the Holy
[1:05:28] Spirit what's going to follow it with
[1:05:30] signs and wonders and manifestations
[1:05:32] such as prophecy tongues and
[1:05:35] interpretation wisdom knowledge and
[1:05:38] healing so in the days of Israel when
[1:05:40] they left Egypt they were under the
[1:05:42] leadership of the spirit of God
[1:05:45] manifesting in
[1:05:47] gifts
[1:05:50] now notice what this is this is what you
[1:05:52] see when God is the leader of a church
[1:05:54] right here
[1:05:56] when there's Holy Spirit leadership this
[1:05:58] is what you see this is how a church
[1:06:01] moves that isn't bound down by man-made
[1:06:04] ideas and Creeds and dogmas
[1:06:06] listen Israel had just been freed from
[1:06:09] bondage and that's how it operated
[1:06:12] they had just come out from underneath
[1:06:14] the nomination and that's how they
[1:06:16] operated they operated in Freedom just
[1:06:18] as the first church did in the book of
[1:06:20] Acts while they were yet still free
[1:06:25] and notice anything
[1:06:27] that takes this away or try to minimize
[1:06:30] it is trying to return you to bondage
[1:06:34] think about it even on the journey in
[1:06:36] the wilderness what they say let's let's
[1:06:37] captain
[1:06:39] return to Egypt
[1:06:41] Egypt so make note
[1:06:42] this may sound harsh but there are those
[1:06:45] who will come out under the ministry of
[1:06:46] the prophet and will follow the pillar
[1:06:49] of fire for so long and then they will
[1:06:51] come to a place that they say let's go
[1:06:53] back
[1:06:55] and they may not say it boldly like that
[1:06:58] but they'll say we don't need that stuff
[1:07:00] anymore
[1:07:01] we don't need the freedom anymore well
[1:07:03] if you don't want freedom what is it
[1:07:04] you're asking for you're asking for the
[1:07:06] bondage of Egypt
[1:07:07] we don't need the moving of the spirit
[1:07:09] we don't need your dance Miriam
[1:07:11] we don't need the tongues and
[1:07:13] interpretation we don't need the freedom
[1:07:15] to worship those things are in the past
[1:07:16] all we need is the word all we need is
[1:07:19] the word and let's make a captain and go
[1:07:21] back to where there wasn't freedom I say
[1:07:23] we will never go back we can't go back
[1:07:25] we come too far to turn back I will have
[1:07:28] freedom of worship in the house of God I
[1:07:30] will have the moving of the spirit I
[1:07:32] will have lives set free we've come too
[1:07:34] far to go back now I choose to stay free
[1:07:38] I choose to stay out from underneath
[1:07:40] bondage I choose to err on the power
[1:07:42] side
[1:07:44] I'm not going back to that
[1:07:46] but there will be those that want
[1:07:49] to go back
[1:07:53] brother branham's talking here about
[1:07:55] Israel
[1:07:58] because Satan hates Liberty
[1:08:01] he hates your Liberty
[1:08:03] he hates your freedom
[1:08:05] and he hates the Holy Spirit leadership
[1:08:07] and he's always going to try to assert
[1:08:10] the leadership and authority of man into
[1:08:12] the church
[1:08:14] and he's talking here about Israel how
[1:08:16] they begin to notice that other nations
[1:08:18] had Kings
[1:08:21] Mike
[1:08:24] he says it caught their eyes and they
[1:08:27] decided they ought to humanize their
[1:08:29] leadership now this quote was very
[1:08:31] powerful to me
[1:08:32] so they wanted a king
[1:08:35] now God was going to humanize the
[1:08:37] leadership himself in the person of the
[1:08:40] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:42] but they got ahead of him
[1:08:46] how many times do we have a desire that
[1:08:49] isn't necessarily a wrong desire but we
[1:08:51] get out in front of God
[1:08:53] we can't wait on the timing of God and
[1:08:56] we want it now and it's got to happen
[1:08:58] now but you don't understand it's got to
[1:08:59] happen now and he's got it waiting on
[1:09:01] you
[1:09:03] he's got it waiting on you but you just
[1:09:04] need to sit back and relax into him and
[1:09:07] let him lead let him take you
[1:09:10] look you you learned through trials
[1:09:12] there's times where sick I want to be
[1:09:13] healed now and he's going I've got that
[1:09:14] taken care of just keep walking
[1:09:18] well I'm getting old I want to get
[1:09:19] married now he's got it taken care of
[1:09:22] just keep walking because the last thing
[1:09:25] you want to do is get out in front of
[1:09:26] him and do something that you ain't
[1:09:27] supposed to do
[1:09:28] you'd be way better off waiting and
[1:09:30] doing what he wants
[1:09:33] he says Satan knew the plan of God so he
[1:09:35] put it in the hearts of the people to
[1:09:37] get ahead of God
[1:09:39] or the word
[1:09:42] like I said that struck me God was going
[1:09:43] to humanize the leadership himself
[1:09:46] but they got ahead of God and I just
[1:09:49] want to encourage you let God move don't
[1:09:52] force God to move
[1:09:54] sometimes we get in a hurry just let God
[1:09:56] have his way
[1:09:57] even even in the services we have be
[1:10:02] EP you know I
[1:10:03] you're not guilty I've been guilty of
[1:10:05] before sitting through the majority of a
[1:10:07] service and having thoughts like
[1:10:10] dead in here
[1:10:12] instead of having thoughts like Lord
[1:10:14] you said you'd be here where two or
[1:10:16] three are gathered
[1:10:18] Lord why ain't this happening yet
[1:10:20] something Lord you said you'd be here
[1:10:23] and we begin to try to force things to
[1:10:25] happen
[1:10:27] just worship God
[1:10:29] just worshiping let God move how he
[1:10:31] wants to move
[1:10:32] and then there's times you're sitting
[1:10:34] there thinking it's dead next thing you
[1:10:35] know right at the end of service also
[1:10:37] there's some great out I have had to
[1:10:39] repent
[1:10:42] sometimes I might be too real with y'all
[1:10:44] but I believe in being transparent
[1:10:47] Micah in here Now's the Time there have
[1:10:50] been times where I was standing back
[1:10:51] there going Mike it's time to go
[1:10:59] not out loud
[1:11:02] in my heart or Timothy whoever it is
[1:11:05] time
[1:11:07] ain't nothing happening it's time you're
[1:11:11] saying they're going man you can feel it
[1:11:12] anybody can feel it it's time to
[1:11:14] and then he moves
[1:11:16] and there's people at the altar and
[1:11:18] there's deliverance and if my carnality
[1:11:21] had had my way
[1:11:23] that wouldn't happen
[1:11:25] get out of God's way and let him operate
[1:11:29] let him move when he wants to move how
[1:11:31] he wants to move through whom he wants
[1:11:33] to move through
[1:11:35] but they began to say we want to do it
[1:11:37] the way other people are doing it
[1:11:39] we want a king who is one of us to lead
[1:11:41] us
[1:11:43] and Samuel feels terrible about this
[1:11:44] because he's the prophet and God says to
[1:11:47] him listen Samuel they haven't rejected
[1:11:49] you
[1:11:50] they've rejected me
[1:11:53] and when people are like we don't want
[1:11:54] that stuff in our church
[1:11:56] God says it's okay they're not rejecting
[1:11:58] you
[1:11:59] they're rejecting me
[1:12:02] they're rejecting me
[1:12:06] because they're giving in to the
[1:12:08] rulership of a man their own flesh
[1:12:11] see sometimes we think about the
[1:12:13] rulership of man we're putting it off on
[1:12:14] other people coming in and ruling no
[1:12:16] when you allow your flesh to rule that's
[1:12:18] the rulership of a man
[1:12:22] and so they let the rulership of a man
[1:12:24] rule in what they think and what they
[1:12:26] want and what's comfortable to them and
[1:12:27] how they think it should operate and he
[1:12:29] says they're rejecting me
[1:12:33] so they wanted a king to lead them into
[1:12:34] battle
[1:12:37] here they are asking God to let them be
[1:12:39] like the rest of the Nations
[1:12:42] let us be like them
[1:12:45] and not recognizing that the whole point
[1:12:47] of Israel is that they were his people
[1:12:49] the whole point of Israel is that you're
[1:12:51] not them
[1:12:53] even like Tabernacle the whole point is
[1:12:55] we're not like the world quit trying to
[1:12:57] be like the world
[1:12:58] quit saying that one's cool and that's
[1:13:00] cool no I like how that looks and why
[1:13:01] can't we and why can't we because you're
[1:13:03] not them you're not called to be them
[1:13:05] the whole point of it is be ye separate
[1:13:07] saith the Lord
[1:13:08] that's the point of all this they are
[1:13:11] called out people for his name
[1:13:13] but they wanted to be like the world
[1:13:15] not recognizing they were different from
[1:13:17] the world on purpose they were not of
[1:13:19] the world on purpose so don't look like
[1:13:22] the world
[1:13:23] listen you can't look like the world act
[1:13:25] like the world talk like the world feet
[1:13:26] on what the world feeds on and then say
[1:13:27] they're going to hell
[1:13:31] You misspelled they it spelled why oh
[1:13:36] you apostrophe r e
[1:13:39] if you're eating and feeding and living
[1:13:41] just like them what makes you think
[1:13:43] you're going somewhere they're not
[1:13:48] the difference is though you're called
[1:13:51] to be separate
[1:13:52] now don't let that come and beat you
[1:13:54] over the head we all go through things
[1:13:56] man I went many many many many years
[1:13:57] looking acting talking like the world
[1:14:00] but there was a seed on the inside of me
[1:14:01] just like there is on the inside of you
[1:14:03] and when that light hits and that and
[1:14:04] that seed begins to Quicken there ain't
[1:14:06] nothing that'll that'll hold you in the
[1:14:08] world anymore there ain't nothing for
[1:14:10] you to go back to the the ships are
[1:14:11] burned there's no reason to go back
[1:14:14] you've been quick into life so if we're
[1:14:16] quick into life let's look like it let's
[1:14:17] act like it let's talk like it let's
[1:14:19] worship like it like we're quick into
[1:14:21] something different
[1:14:23] we can never forget that we're called to
[1:14:26] be separate what makes the difference
[1:14:28] brother Aaron let's read this first
[1:14:31] this is this is what we're called to
[1:14:32] First Corinth second Corinthians 6 17
[1:14:35] 18. wherefore come out from among them
[1:14:38] and be ye separate saith the Lord and
[1:14:40] touch not the unclean things don't touch
[1:14:43] what they touch
[1:14:44] and I will receive you and will be a
[1:14:47] father unto you and you shall be my sons
[1:14:48] and daughters saith the Lord Almighty
[1:14:53] what makes the difference brother Brown
[1:14:55] would say put God to one side and Israel
[1:14:57] was like any other Nation
[1:14:59] when Samson cut off his hair he was like
[1:15:01] any other man put the leadership of the
[1:15:04] Holy Ghost aside and the church is
[1:15:06] nothing but the world with God's name
[1:15:09] attached to it
[1:15:11] oh my let's not be that let's not just
[1:15:13] be another church with message attached
[1:15:16] to it
[1:15:16] may we never get to the place that we
[1:15:18] can do it without his spirit
[1:15:20] that we can do it like everybody else
[1:15:22] can do it he says the world and the
[1:15:25] church are all of the same lump
[1:15:27] just like eat Jacob and Esau were of the
[1:15:30] same parents but the spirit of God makes
[1:15:33] the difference
[1:15:34] well I promise you I'm gonna welcome it
[1:15:37] I'm not going to reject the one thing
[1:15:39] that makes the difference if it's the
[1:15:40] spirit that makes the difference I say
[1:15:42] let the spirit have preeminence if it's
[1:15:44] the spirit that makes a difference I say
[1:15:46] Lord pour out your spirit tonight and
[1:15:49] the next time we're together in every
[1:15:50] day of my life I want what makes the
[1:15:53] difference if we're of the same look
[1:15:55] what makes a difference in heaven and
[1:15:56] hell the spirit brother Branham says
[1:15:59] it's the holy ghost or perish
[1:16:01] Lord we gotta have it Lord we accept it
[1:16:04] we will not reject it we will not turn
[1:16:06] it down the word of God says that's what
[1:16:08] makes the difference then we've got to
[1:16:10] have it we got to be desperate for it we
[1:16:13] gotta call for it we gotta want it then
[1:16:15] when it moves however it moves we got to
[1:16:17] accept it
[1:16:18] church that's why we preach it
[1:16:20] that's why we believe for that's why we
[1:16:23] welcome it that's why we long for more
[1:16:24] of it we don't just call ourselves
[1:16:27] Christians we're born of the very spirit
[1:16:30] of God
[1:16:32] we don't just call ourselves that
[1:16:35] to us it is the Holy Ghost
[1:16:38] or perish
[1:16:40] the Nicolaitans had gotten in
[1:16:43] the church began to drift
[1:16:46] well how much did they drift brother
[1:16:48] Aaron doesn't matter
[1:16:50] it doesn't matter because
[1:16:52] Hey Brother Brown says they drifted away
[1:16:54] from the pattern of the word and then he
[1:16:55] says Eve drifted one word off
[1:16:59] it only takes one word
[1:17:01] the serpent just changed one word and he
[1:17:03] believed it
[1:17:04] but more and more things began to drift
[1:17:06] in that were not in the original pattern
[1:17:09] listen it doesn't matter how good it is
[1:17:11] how sound it seems how awesome it may
[1:17:14] send to these ears if it's not in the
[1:17:15] original pattern we don't want it
[1:17:18] but he says more things began to come in
[1:17:20] that were not of the original pattern he
[1:17:22] says that not only will it affect this
[1:17:24] age but it's going to affect every age
[1:17:25] actor because of what they let in
[1:17:28] they begin to hate and fight the True
[1:17:30] Vine
[1:17:31] and he says notice how organization
[1:17:33] breeds hatred it destroys Fellowship it
[1:17:37] makes
[1:17:38] bitterness
[1:17:41] more and more things were coming in
[1:17:43] a root of bitterness began to grow in
[1:17:45] the false Vine towards the True Vine why
[1:17:49] what did they do wrong
[1:17:51] what did Abel do wrong
[1:17:53] except be accepted
[1:17:56] and the false Vine hates the acceptance
[1:17:59] of the True Vine
[1:18:00] and it causes bitterness to begin to
[1:18:03] grow and hatred began to magnify more
[1:18:07] and more than it was ever before
[1:18:10] he said the smyrnian church drifted away
[1:18:12] from far from the original it had become
[1:18:15] a hybrid it had hybridized itself the
[1:18:19] way Eve did and what this means is it
[1:18:21] was no longer pure it was mixed it was
[1:18:23] the word of God partial mixed with the
[1:18:27] ideas of man and then the church had
[1:18:29] began to mix in Creeds and mix in ideas
[1:18:32] of those that were not her husband the
[1:18:34] Lord Jesus and that's why he Compares it
[1:18:36] to Eve he says instead of the straight
[1:18:40] word of God instead of Spirit-filled men
[1:18:43] in the church who were led by the spirit
[1:18:45] given Revelation Spirit given Revelation
[1:18:48] there are now Creeds and bylaws and the
[1:18:51] educated guesses of educated men
[1:18:54] learning has taken the place of
[1:18:56] Revelation reason has replaced Faith
[1:18:58] program has replaced spontaneous praise
[1:19:02] in the Holy Ghost it wasn't so from the
[1:19:06] beginning
[1:19:08] oh my if we read this here we can say it
[1:19:10] like this in the beginning the church
[1:19:12] was spirit-led
[1:19:13] in the original it was not educated into
[1:19:16] you it wasn't fine lectures with some
[1:19:19] little bit of two songs here and then
[1:19:21] two songs after and then let's go home
[1:19:22] and say we did our duty he says it
[1:19:25] replaced spontaneous praise in the Holy
[1:19:29] Ghost listen I love spontaneous praise I
[1:19:33] love spontaneous worship we're just all
[1:19:35] of a sudden
[1:19:36] all of a sudden I don't care if it's the
[1:19:39] beginning of a song or something all of
[1:19:40] a sudden it's like this and all of a
[1:19:41] sudden whoa
[1:19:43] and it's spontaneous I say let's keep it
[1:19:45] original I say let's keep it spontaneous
[1:19:48] let's keep it the way it was on the day
[1:19:49] of Pentecost it wasn't some workup where
[1:19:52] they sang One song long enough till
[1:19:53] finally somebody got a side all of a
[1:19:55] sudden Pillar of Fire came in there and
[1:19:57] it was spontaneous and it combusted and
[1:19:59] it blew apart listen I want it in this
[1:20:01] church to where we don't know when we
[1:20:03] don't know who we don't know how but at
[1:20:05] any moment spontaneous praise can break
[1:20:08] out across this congregation I say let's
[1:20:10] keep it that way let's keep it free I
[1:20:13] don't care who shouts I don't care who
[1:20:15] gets free just let it be spontaneous
[1:20:17] praise in the Holy Spirit
[1:20:20] because the other wasn't so from the
[1:20:23] beginning
[1:20:25] that's not how it was
[1:20:32] the hybrid hates the truth
[1:20:36] and because of this the true begins to
[1:20:38] be pushed out
[1:20:39] they began to be pushed out of the
[1:20:41] organizations
[1:20:42] pushed out of the churches
[1:20:45] the true were poor
[1:20:47] they were outcast
[1:20:49] but they were rich in the spirit
[1:20:52] and they would worship wherever the
[1:20:54] spirit was given Liberty that's how it
[1:20:56] is today the true will worship where the
[1:20:59] spirit is given Liberty Street Corners
[1:21:01] caves storefronts it didn't matter where
[1:21:05] but the bitterness was growing
[1:21:08] and brother Branham says that for all
[1:21:09] the good the people of God do
[1:21:12] they are still put to public shame and
[1:21:14] death
[1:21:16] surely there must be some Sinister force
[1:21:19] behind a people
[1:21:21] who would be so void of conscious that
[1:21:24] they would return evil to those who did
[1:21:27] them
[1:21:28] good
[1:21:29] what would drive somebody to kill
[1:21:32] and to persecute those that only wanted
[1:21:35] to speak truth
[1:21:36] to kill and persecute those that are
[1:21:38] doing good in the community
[1:21:40] to kill and persecute those that whose
[1:21:42] lives had been changed for the better
[1:21:44] they had a testimony of living right
[1:21:47] and it would be the same thing as we
[1:21:49] said that drove Cain to kill Abel it's
[1:21:51] Satan
[1:21:53] it's Satan back behind this group
[1:21:55] pushing it's safe in that so against the
[1:21:58] True Vine it's Satan that's doing these
[1:22:00] things although it's manifested in the
[1:22:02] lives of people
[1:22:04] it's no different than they're in the
[1:22:06] Book of Genesis where he says when he
[1:22:09] says that that thy seed you know that
[1:22:11] would see the woman will crush the head
[1:22:12] of the serpent and and not see shall
[1:22:14] bruise his heel what Calvary did was
[1:22:16] there a bunch of snakes there trying to
[1:22:18] bite Jesus
[1:22:19] no but it was manifested in people it
[1:22:22] was an anointing of Satan and it's Satan
[1:22:26] that's driving this persecution
[1:22:28] and brother Branham makes such an
[1:22:30] awesome comparison here and we'll get to
[1:22:32] it in just a minute
[1:22:35] hybrid religion is death
[1:22:38] and we're about to be wrapping this up
[1:22:40] in just a minute but I want to focus on
[1:22:41] that we just said it it don't matter how
[1:22:43] good it is young people If It Don't Fit
[1:22:45] the original pattern do away with it
[1:22:48] don't mix it in because a hybrid cannot
[1:22:51] produce original Christians that's why
[1:22:54] when you ask somebody are you a
[1:22:56] Christian they'll respond with
[1:22:57] I'm a Baptist
[1:23:00] or I'm a Methodist
[1:23:02] instead of yes I'm a Christian
[1:23:05] because there's something mixed in that
[1:23:07] makes them
[1:23:08] a Baptist or makes them a Methodist
[1:23:12] there's something there that's been
[1:23:13] hybrid the life that brings Christians
[1:23:17] forth isn't there to bring forth
[1:23:19] Christians it can only produce what it
[1:23:21] is
[1:23:22] listen to mule brother Brown talks about
[1:23:24] it is a hybrid it's a mix between a
[1:23:26] horse and a donkey
[1:23:28] and it can never reproduce
[1:23:31] and neither can a church that is mixed
[1:23:33] with Creeds and dogmas and the ideas of
[1:23:36] man ever mixed with truth even bring
[1:23:39] forth original Christians
[1:23:42] it can't it can't bring forth original
[1:23:44] Christians he says when the church
[1:23:46] allowed herself to move away from the
[1:23:48] original
[1:23:49] like Adam and Eve then death
[1:23:52] set in brother Brown says there's no
[1:23:55] strength in her she's become a
[1:23:57] monstrosity the minute the church moved
[1:23:59] towards form and ceremony and towards
[1:24:01] priesthood by organization
[1:24:03] the minister the organization that
[1:24:05] ministers into a group that decided
[1:24:07] leadership apart from the holy spirit in
[1:24:09] his word that very moment death entered
[1:24:12] in and she started to get sick and as
[1:24:15] she got sick she changed to a powerless
[1:24:17] group of people whose only weapon was
[1:24:21] argument
[1:24:24] don't get to the place where you can out
[1:24:27] quote people and out argue people but
[1:24:29] there's no life there
[1:24:31] I don't care if you know one verse or
[1:24:33] one quote if you got that Holy Ghost
[1:24:35] burned on the inside of you you better
[1:24:36] off than some educated Theologian in the
[1:24:39] message
[1:24:41] there was a time where it wasn't about
[1:24:43] you know it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:24:45] that we got up and just gave pretty
[1:24:46] lectures
[1:24:47] and became educated in the message but
[1:24:50] there was a life that was birthed into
[1:24:52] people that's what we're longing for
[1:24:54] that's what we're not just a people with
[1:24:55] an argument not just people that well I
[1:24:57] can show you in the scripture this and I
[1:24:58] can show you that let your life testify
[1:25:00] to the world let the Holy Spirit living
[1:25:03] out from you testify to the world
[1:25:05] do everything that you can to feed that
[1:25:08] fire every single day because brother
[1:25:10] Branham tells us that no age ever comes
[1:25:13] back after the Revival dies
[1:25:16] no age ever comes back
[1:25:19] after the Revival dies because the cycle
[1:25:22] of Revival and death has never failed
[1:25:25] there would be a Revival in that age
[1:25:26] would go into death there'd be a Revival
[1:25:28] and then that age would go into death
[1:25:30] and then a Revival and then that age
[1:25:32] would go into death but this word
[1:25:34] Revival that we're a part of wasn't sent
[1:25:36] that we could go into the ground
[1:25:39] this word Revival was sent that there
[1:25:42] would be a people that makes themselves
[1:25:43] ready and dresses themselves in the word
[1:25:45] that can go into the Garner it was sent
[1:25:47] to produce a Rapture it was sent to
[1:25:50] produce people that say I can't ever go
[1:25:52] back again and they keep the fire
[1:25:54] burning day after day after day all the
[1:25:58] way until that bright morning when he
[1:26:00] comes to take us home that's what I want
[1:26:02] to be I want to be one that breaks the
[1:26:05] cycle of Revival and death
[1:26:08] coming down to the last few sections one
[1:26:11] of them was entitled 10 years of
[1:26:13] tribulation
[1:26:15] verse 10. fear none of those things
[1:26:17] which Thou shalt suffer
[1:26:19] behold the devil shall cast some of you
[1:26:21] into prison that ye may be tried and you
[1:26:24] shall have tribulation 10 days
[1:26:27] be thou faithful unto death and I will
[1:26:30] give thee a Crown of Life he starts off
[1:26:34] by telling them straight out
[1:26:36] don't fear these things that are coming
[1:26:40] in other words he said he says
[1:26:42] trials tribulation even that these
[1:26:46] things are coming Satan's going to throw
[1:26:48] you in the devil's going to cast you
[1:26:49] into prison you shall have tribulation
[1:26:51] 10 days but be faithful unto death
[1:26:54] hardships are coming young people
[1:26:57] trials are coming
[1:26:59] but he's telling them I'm going to be
[1:27:00] with you
[1:27:01] that don't mean I'm going to stop it but
[1:27:02] I'm going to be with you you be faithful
[1:27:05] you be true
[1:27:07] you be strong because there's a promise
[1:27:10] at the end of that I will give thee a
[1:27:13] Crown of Life
[1:27:14] the 10 years tribulation this is
[1:27:16] actually
[1:27:18] being done to them by Jews
[1:27:21] it's being done to them by Pagan priest
[1:27:24] it's being done to them by Governors
[1:27:26] trying to find favor with the people and
[1:27:28] they were enduring great persecution by
[1:27:31] the thousands Christians were being
[1:27:32] imprisoned they were being killed by
[1:27:35] lines thrown in there with Gladiators
[1:27:37] there would be tortured they were being
[1:27:39] burned
[1:27:40] but notice what the scripture says this
[1:27:42] is about what we just talked about
[1:27:44] the blame doesn't go on the people
[1:27:47] he says the devil will cast some of you
[1:27:50] into prison that you may be tried he's
[1:27:52] addressing the spirit behind it
[1:27:55] he's addressing the motivation and the
[1:27:58] Bible says it's Satan that's doing it
[1:28:00] it's his hatred of the True Vine behind
[1:28:03] all of it he's behind all of this
[1:28:05] because he hates God and what God has
[1:28:07] set is hard on Satan is bound to try to
[1:28:11] destroy
[1:28:12] I want you to notice the connection that
[1:28:14] brother Brownell makes right here
[1:28:16] he says but watch
[1:28:18] here is some illumination if Satan is
[1:28:21] behind the Jews who are hailing the
[1:28:23] Christians in the court then the Jews
[1:28:26] are not of God's religion but they're
[1:28:28] the Devils their Gathering is also of
[1:28:30] the synagogue of Satan now he says if
[1:28:33] that's what he called the Jews that did
[1:28:35] this that persecuted the church and
[1:28:37] killed all these he says and if the
[1:28:39] Roman Catholic Church killed the
[1:28:41] multitudes of Believers in the Dark Ages
[1:28:44] yes and in all ages then they are of the
[1:28:48] devil and belong to Satan also
[1:28:52] in other words what he's saying is if
[1:28:55] because the Jews of this time did this
[1:28:58] and God placed them as being of the
[1:29:00] devil then anyone who carries out these
[1:29:02] same actions down through history as the
[1:29:05] Roman Catholic Church did are also of
[1:29:08] the synagogue of Satan and they are of
[1:29:11] the devil
[1:29:14] the persecution
[1:29:15] that they're putting on the people who
[1:29:17] further exposes the true and the false
[1:29:19] Vine
[1:29:20] and their deeds began to expose them and
[1:29:22] the vines are going in almost total
[1:29:24] opposite directions and
[1:29:26] all this persecution this is what I want
[1:29:28] you to understand as we come down I have
[1:29:30] two slides left
[1:29:32] it wasn't done because they hated
[1:29:35] religion
[1:29:37] remember Cain was very religious the
[1:29:39] Pharisees were very religious
[1:29:42] it was done in the name of religion
[1:29:45] it was done by the false Vine who were
[1:29:47] very religious calling the truevine
[1:29:50] Heretics
[1:29:51] and saying that the church needed to be
[1:29:53] purged and we need to get that
[1:29:55] fanaticism out of here and and they were
[1:29:57] literally killing them in the name of
[1:30:00] religion claiming to be the true
[1:30:03] brother Branham says let them organize
[1:30:05] and repudiate the little flock they but
[1:30:07] further reveal to all that they are of
[1:30:09] the devil they are the false Vine the
[1:30:13] vine that murders their hatred proves
[1:30:15] who they are the nicolaitan Antichrist
[1:30:18] church is who they are
[1:30:23] it said tribulation 10 days
[1:30:26] this is actually a prophecy
[1:30:29] during this time the persecution was so
[1:30:32] strong and terrible and bloody brother
[1:30:34] Brown says that if it wasn't for the
[1:30:36] grace of God every believer would have
[1:30:38] been wiped out
[1:30:40] every believer
[1:30:42] he says Thou shalt have tribulation ten
[1:30:44] days and the reason it's a prophecy is
[1:30:46] this was a 10-year Reign of Terror from
[1:30:48] 302 to 312.
[1:30:51] it's where they launched this and for 10
[1:30:53] years they slaughtered and killed and
[1:30:55] massacred every True Believer
[1:30:59] but he tells them
[1:31:01] he says be faithful unto death
[1:31:04] many of them sealed their life
[1:31:07] sealed their testimony I mean with their
[1:31:08] life
[1:31:09] thousands brother Branham says yay
[1:31:11] Millions have died during all the ages
[1:31:15] I want you to listen in for just a
[1:31:17] minute as we wrap this up
[1:31:18] he says they died in the faith like
[1:31:20] Antipas the faithful martyr they held
[1:31:23] not their lives dear unto the death
[1:31:25] often we think that it would be almost
[1:31:28] impossible to be a martyr think about
[1:31:31] how many of you think about those days
[1:31:32] ago there's no way I could I mean
[1:31:35] imagine just walking out there willingly
[1:31:37] going to the stake to be burned going
[1:31:39] out to be eaten by lines I couldn't
[1:31:42] no I couldn't how'd they do it how'd
[1:31:45] they do it I could never and brother
[1:31:47] Branham says but dare to recall that the
[1:31:50] faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ
[1:31:53] Jesus is the same faith that upholds the
[1:31:56] polycarps and all the martyrs the
[1:31:59] Supreme Faith this sentence right here
[1:32:01] just blessed me the Supreme faith will
[1:32:03] give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour
[1:32:06] blessed be God forever he says the faith
[1:32:10] that you use every single day is the
[1:32:13] exact same faith that let them face the
[1:32:15] lines the faith that you overcome
[1:32:18] laodicea with is the exact same faith
[1:32:20] that they have it's the faith for the
[1:32:23] hour he says it will rise to the
[1:32:24] occasion the faith that you have is
[1:32:27] strong enough for what you're going to
[1:32:28] face is what he's saying I don't know if
[1:32:30] I'm going to make it brother Aaron the
[1:32:31] faith you have is the Supreme faith for
[1:32:34] the Supreme hour you're gonna make it I
[1:32:36] don't know if I can Rapture the faith
[1:32:38] that let them go to the Coliseum and
[1:32:40] stand there and be eaten by lions it's
[1:32:42] the same Faith you come over come with
[1:32:44] today and tomorrow
[1:32:46] it's the same Jesus it's the same Faith
[1:32:49] that's going to Rapture you it's the
[1:32:51] same faith that heals you it's the same
[1:32:53] faith and I say had you stood then you
[1:32:55] could have done it and if they stood now
[1:32:57] they could do it because it's the faith
[1:32:59] of the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be God
[1:33:03] forever
[1:33:05] it's the same faith that faith will not
[1:33:08] let you down when the Trials come but
[1:33:11] that faith will rise to the occasion
[1:33:14] he says
[1:33:16] a Crown of Life
[1:33:19] and I will give thee
[1:33:21] a Crown of Life
[1:33:24] but Brown says but the crowd spoken of
[1:33:25] here in the Revelation given to a martyr
[1:33:28] is the crown of royalty
[1:33:30] Jesus calls it the Crown of Life
[1:33:33] the one Crown is for those who have
[1:33:35] striven
[1:33:36] and the other is for those
[1:33:40] who have given
[1:33:42] he says this Crown is an Incorruptible
[1:33:44] crown
[1:33:45] and I believe that's all what we're
[1:33:46] fighting for I'm going to close this out
[1:33:49] and I'm going to pull up if I can
[1:33:52] my table lap because the last quote that
[1:33:54] I put in there wasn't there here it is
[1:33:57] and it may not come up on the screen and
[1:33:58] that's fine I just want to read it to
[1:34:00] you
[1:34:02] he says one Crown is for those who have
[1:34:04] striven the other is for those who have
[1:34:07] given both crowns are incorruptible
[1:34:10] they will not perish the winners of the
[1:34:13] worldly race
[1:34:14] the ones who are out there with the best
[1:34:16] job the best career the best houses the
[1:34:18] best cars the best the best those are
[1:34:20] winners of the worldly race
[1:34:24] he says those will all perish
[1:34:28] why did that just happen
[1:34:33] he says
[1:34:34] they will soon lose the joy of the
[1:34:37] plaudits of the world their Glory will
[1:34:39] fail but those who give their lives for
[1:34:42] God oh brother Aaron I didn't give my
[1:34:44] life for God I no no he makes it very
[1:34:46] clear those who give their lives for God
[1:34:49] either by daily striving
[1:34:52] or by shedding their blood as the
[1:34:55] crowning sacrifice of their lives will
[1:34:56] be given the Crown of Life how do we
[1:34:59] give our lives by daily striving by
[1:35:03] taking that same faith and applying it
[1:35:04] to our day by day applying it to our
[1:35:07] trials applying it to where we overcome
[1:35:09] that is daily striving and you will be
[1:35:11] given the same Crown of Life an
[1:35:13] Incorruptible Crown brother Brown says
[1:35:15] all too little time is spent on laboring
[1:35:19] for the Eternal rewards of God
[1:35:22] and I want to ask you this is our
[1:35:24] closing thought we're done
[1:35:27] what are you striving the most for
[1:35:30] understand that we must strive for
[1:35:34] certain things here on Earth
[1:35:36] we can't take this all the way so we're
[1:35:37] not supposed to worry about getting a
[1:35:38] good job we're not supposed to worry
[1:35:39] about no that's not the truth at all
[1:35:41] don't don't run that way with it but
[1:35:42] what are you striving the most for
[1:35:45] where are you laying up your Rewards
[1:35:48] where are your Treasures laid up all too
[1:35:52] little time is spent on laboring for the
[1:35:54] Eternal rewards of God the recompense of
[1:35:57] God is too lightly esteemed
[1:36:00] he says if we believe in the reality of
[1:36:03] the resurrection of the body and an
[1:36:06] eternal Kingdom of substance then we
[1:36:09] ought to lay up in heaven those good
[1:36:11] Treasures that are available to the
[1:36:14] faithful Saints
[1:36:16] I want to lay my treasures up there
[1:36:19] I want to be rich in him
[1:36:21] I want to be rich in eternity I know
[1:36:24] there's things I have to take care of
[1:36:25] here but what are you striving the most
[1:36:27] for
[1:36:28] are you wanting to be rich here are you
[1:36:31] striving to be rich there
[1:36:33] are you striving to where on that day he
[1:36:36] says well done my good and faithful
[1:36:39] servant because there was a lot in that
[1:36:41] day that applied the faith they were
[1:36:43] given and gave their lives through the
[1:36:46] shedding of blood
[1:36:47] but he's just asking you to give your
[1:36:50] life on a day by day basis he says and
[1:36:53] you'll get a crown of life too
[1:36:55] you'll receive a Crown of Life
[1:36:57] remember Church
[1:36:59] the spirits never die
[1:37:01] the same spirits that came to try to Rob
[1:37:03] them and make them cold and formal it
[1:37:06] wasn't so in the beginning
[1:37:08] let's not let him Rob us let evening
[1:37:10] light Tabernacle let your life let's
[1:37:12] quit generalizing it let your life be a
[1:37:15] testimony of how an original believer
[1:37:18] worships how an original believer lives
[1:37:21] how an original believer overcomes the
[1:37:24] kindness and the Brotherly Love of
[1:37:25] original Believers let your life be a
[1:37:28] testimony that he's a living God and
[1:37:30] that the faith of Jesus Christ in your
[1:37:32] life will always rise to the challenge
[1:37:35] to meet the challenge of the hour and
[1:37:37] give you Supreme Grace to overcome can
[1:37:39] we pray together
[1:37:42] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord what a
[1:37:44] wonderful group of young people a
[1:37:45] wonderful group Lord of people that have
[1:37:48] gathered here this evening Lord just to

[1:37:53] you'll just get it down in our heart
[1:37:56] Lord to recognize that we have to give
[1:37:58] our lives for you and it may not be in
[1:38:00] the shedding of blood but in every day
[1:38:02] just surrendering our flesh and not
[1:38:05] letting man rule over us but
[1:38:07] surrendering to the spirit
[1:38:09] surrendering to your leadership Lord and
[1:38:12] recognizing Lord that your love is
[1:38:13] elective
[1:38:14] Lord it doesn't matter what we go
[1:38:17] through what battles we face what trials
[1:38:19] we come up against
[1:38:21] the Proof of Your Love Is that you
[1:38:23] called us
[1:38:24] the Proof of Your Love Is that you died
[1:38:26] for us
[1:38:27] Lord let us walk in that and never
[1:38:28] question that love again
[1:38:30] and Lord may we rise to the occasion as
[1:38:33] they did in that day because the Faith
