[0:00] he said I'll tell you what I'll take
[0:01] I'll take your spirit
[0:03] because that was a I believe it was a
[0:05] spear amen it was a tribal ceremony
[0:07] spear that all the tribes in the area
[0:10] knew belonged to that King
[0:12] so he said I'll take that
[0:14] and the prophet of God explains it he
[0:16] said what is what his thoughts was is it
[0:18] seemed like he could have greater things
[0:20] but he knew that that would be life to
[0:23] him see see I'm paraphrasing but that
[0:25] would be life to him in other words if
[0:27] he had that spear whenever he come
[0:30] toward a tribe and they started running
[0:32] at him all he had to do was hold up that
[0:34] Spear and they would have to back away
[0:36] all you had to do was hold it up and
[0:38] they would recognize he's got the king's
[0:40] message he's representing somebody
[0:43] greater than him and you hear me and
[0:46] today God has put a message in our hands
[0:48] amen that here we are amen is Satan's
[0:51] Eden and the devil's like a roaring line
[0:54] he ain't lost none of his power he's as
[0:57] powerful as he ever was but God has put
[0:59] something in your hand he's put
[1:02] something in your hand that Satan has to
[1:04] power every time he hears the name of
[1:08] Jesus Christ
[1:11] in Daniel chapter 10 when the Bible
[1:14] tells us that the Prince of Persia had
[1:18] blocked and he tried to stop the angel
[1:20] from getting and Daniel had prayed for
[1:23] 21 days and the Angel's word says I am
[1:27] come for thy words
[1:31] he's coming for the words of Tim Pruitt
[1:34] he's coming for the words of Ron Spitzer
[1:37] he's coming for the word of the body of
[1:40] Jesus Christ it is not a time to set
[1:43] back it's a time to speak
[1:45] speak to that mountain speak to that
[1:48] situation speak to that circumstance
[1:52] come for thy words
[1:54] hear us maybe some people just here for
[1:56] the first time getting among this kind
[1:58] of worship and power and they're saying
[2:00] I wonder what all this is
[2:03] I'll tell you what this is
[2:05] this
[2:07] is that
[2:12] your whole life wondered what that is
[2:16] this
[2:17] is that
[2:22] you like that when it's in the Bible but
[2:25] how do you like this
[2:28] I love it brother
[2:31] what is it it's the it's the Revival
[2:35] of the Bride
[2:38] people say it's coming for years
[2:42] but here it is
[2:45] don't miss it
[2:47] don't miss your opportunity don't miss
[2:50] the greatest days of your life

[3:16] find it very interesting that
[3:18] she's writing that song
[3:21] same time
[3:22] I'm getting this message
[3:27] I think God's speaking to us
[3:33] if if he could have
[3:36] he would have stopped us
