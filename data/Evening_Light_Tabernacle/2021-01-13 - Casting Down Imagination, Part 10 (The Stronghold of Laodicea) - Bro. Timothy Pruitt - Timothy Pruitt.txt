we just commit this service to your hands everything that be said and done would be lord for your will and your glory and your honor we ask father you just anoint us we pray in jesus name amen amen let's turn to second corinthians 10. amen verse 4 says for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ sounds quite opposite of the world that we're living in amen but this is what the scripture tells us to do here is we read it i also want to read in uh revelations believers chapter 3 and it says unto the angel of the uh of the church of laodicea wright for these things saith a the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know that works that thou are neither cold nor hot i would thou were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked now could you imagine or the imaginations of someone who would make the statement that i'm rich increase with goods and have need of nothing yet god would come back and say thou thou knowest not that thou art and know it not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked that's quite a problem if you have that kind of problem in your mind amen to where you don't know the condition that you're truly in he said i counseled thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment and thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salve that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me and to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and have set down in my father's and with my father in his throne he that hath and hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen we'll let you be seated as we read here in this scripture as we know is speaking directly to the time that we're living in and and the age that we're living in the situations that we're seeing even unfold very quickly before our eyes and we're seeing a world very quickly turn very much towards complete darkness until our minds are our minds of men are on evil continually and their minds are being taken over by uh you know they can think well i just think this way or just my own thoughts but we know thoughts are are activated or are operated by spirit and we see spirits that have been uh being brought to the forefront and bodies of women men and women today that we're we're seeing around us and you know it's an age of apparently an age of imaginations to where people can be caught up in imaginations to where they think they're rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing but really they're wretched miserable poor blind and naked now they may have money that this world gives but they don't have the things that god godly values they may have things of houses and lands but amen what about eternal values amen you know somebody was saying the other day you know people wants to be a millionaire you know and it's not that shouldn't that's not our goal and that's not our our destination really to be a man of mighty wealth here upon this earth but i want to be rich in the goodness of god amen i want to be an eternal heir amen an eternal heir amen he said you know in their imaginations or in their thinking they're rich and creatures of goods and have need of nothing from god and the scripture was to go on to say in another place that they have become vain in their imaginations and we're living in an age that's going into complete and total darkness into complete and total chaos there is a total rejection of christ all over again as they rejected him there in the body of jesus christ they're rejecting him again amen and crucified him again the word that has been sent in this age in this hour that we're living in until we see them completely reject him from their lives completely reject him from schools from jobs and from government and we see leo laodicea has been set up in the atmosphere to be satan's eden or satan's stronghold and we see here and that's what i want to minister on this evening as we would look into this is casting down in that imaginations amen laodicea the stronghold of laodicea and we are living in a stronghold as a strong age it's a strong time and it's got very many many ways of of coming coming at you as a as it would try and we we've seen very quickly how men in this age have given up their their their godliness and their holiness and their and their thinking has been being completely flipped over to the other side and we see very quickly amen how the god of this age as we know would be satan he has set up his rulership and his domain and this age will end up going into complete destruction so therefore there's no hope in this time that we're living in and we see it very quickly ending very quickly right here in front of us and we know he has set it up to be his eid and or his stronghold you know brother branham would speak and it's a very good sermon to go listen to the god of this evil age he would he would start out and he said the bible has the answer for every age it's already written in the bible for the believer of that age i believe that everything we have need of is written right here it don't need to be interpreted it just needs to be interpreted by the holy spirit he said i don't believe that any man on earth has a right to put his own interpretation to the word god doesn't need anybody to interpret his word he's his own interpreter how does he interpret it by bringing it to pass amen he said i've said many times he said a virgin shall conceive he spoke it through the lips of the prophet and she did no one had to interpret that in the beginning he said let there be light and there was no one had to interpret that and he said in the last days he will pour out his spirit upon flesh and he did it don't need any type of interpretation but he said notice how we closely as we study the word the god of this evil age that we're now living in he said it may seem strange a very strange thing that in this age this evil age it's also an age of grace hallelujah he said because in the middle of this chaos in the middle of all these things are going on god is taking a people for his name's sake and that is the bride in this evil age that can be called the most evil age there's ever been in this very age god is calling out a people for his name's sake by grace and calling them out of this evil time now we prove that by the bible that this is the age that he's speaking of very strange to think that in this time god is calling out a people amen you notice he said a people not a church it's called it's called the church but he would call a people he said a church is a gathering of many people of different makeups but god is calling one he said he didn't say i'll call the methodist or the baptists or the pentecostals he will call a people a bride for his namesake right in the middle of this dark age and when this bride leaves she'll go into dark complete darkness amen he said but we're seeing a people for his name that receives his name engaged in his name going to a waiting to be married to him to become part of him by a predestination just as a man that chooses a right wi the right wife in his life ordained to be part of his body so the bride of christ will be now and from old ordained by god to be part of that body he said notice not what someone has said or what someone called but what god chose before the foundation of the world me and you a people for his name's sake in the middle of this age in this evil age right in the middle of it he said it's the most deceiving age of all ages it's got the most deception of all ages all the ages of deceit from the garden of eden all the way down never has there ever been an age so deceptive as this age that we're living in to where it was it would say false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders if possible they would deceive the very leg but now just a cold now we see now in this age just cold formal starchy churches and so forth a man's theology he said but the elect won't pay no attention to that they're just going to keep going on with the word with the promise of the word and they're going to keep living the word for their hour right here in the middle of this dark age but we see satan is setting up his kingdom we find why why is god doing this why has god allowed all the things that are taking place and all the chaos and all the all the problems in the world and the situations and the sicknesses and the plagues and satan having seemingly having his way time after time after time he said what god is doing he's bringing a people here so she can be made manifest so she can be tried be proved and prove to satan that she won't fall like the first eve did hallelujah so he's allowed it to become where it is today laodicea a stronghold satan's eden amen an evil age to prove to satan this bride is not like eve amen eve fell in god's eating but this bridal stand and satan's eating amen this bride will stand no matter how bad the situation gets but we see laodicea and we see it it's amazing as you would which do a study of the you know as reading revelations it was cities there in the area of the greek and and this particular one named laodicea which means people's rights more it's very very fitting for the age that we live in people's rights you know they had they had a lot of very it was very flourishing city a lot of money a lot of wealth uh you know very financially seemingly stable much property and you know great medical schools and and and been this you know they were distinguished in the hearts and the sciences and you know they their worship to god whose name was zeus you know how fitting were the characteristics of this city to represent the age that we now live in but as we go on to this don't forget god has called a people out of this amen that's not going to go into destruction but she's going to go in a rapture amen and but see they said they worship one god zeus who was the chief and the father of gods and this forecast into the 20th century one god the fathers of us all and and to have a religious premise that sets forth the brotherhood of men even now bringing together protestants and catholics and jews and hindus with the intent that a mutual form of worship will increase our love we'll increase our understanding we'll increase our care for each other see how slick that devil is amen let's just bring it all together no one's right no one's wrong we're all serving one god we're we're all we all read the bible we all believe the bible but in their hearts they really don't believe what the word said amen in their hearts is far from him amen amen but they want to say they want to put this out that you know all of us were you know i just saw an article the other day we need an all-inclusive religion and we see it being set up that that we're the world that we're living in is all-inclusive everybody's right there's no wrong there's there and you go down that highway you're going down to a wreck somewhere amen because there is good there is evil there is right there is wrong amen amen but they want us to get in our ideas and our imagination there's nothing wrong and there's nothing right everything's right and nothing's wrong confusion and we're seeing a world that's being brought right into this confusion and to where you know or it says organizations with world leaders refuse to recognize any one individual concept of spiritual worship but recommend putting aside all the separate concepts with hopes that all religions become leveled into one for all desire the same goals all have the same purposes and all are basically right it's a lie of the devil amen the laodicea people's rights you know everybody wants their rights they want their rights to live without a god they want the rights to live as as how they want to live and do as they want to do and and and act how they want to act we we got to have our rights and how dare anybody raise up and say the word of god says this and the word of god says that we have our rights amen and they won't if we see their nations rising up and demanding equality socially and financially this is the age of the communists where all men are supposedly equal though it's not so in theory this is the age of political parties that calls themselves christian democrats christian socialists i don't even know if there's christian republicans anymore christian commonwealth federation according to our liberal theologians they want to say jesus was even a socialist and an early church on the guidance of spirits practice socialism and thus we also do so today do you see where the world is going one world one government one head satan the god of this evil age you know it's pretty crazy world you're living in when the roman catholic becomes the voice of the conservative it's unbelievable the harlot the becomes the voice of the conservative murdering babies and you know you you read about the history of rome you see what who they really are and what's really behind them it's it's not too hard to look into but people are being brought right into it how by capturing their minds you know he says he says when the ancients called laodicea the metropolis it was looking forward to a one world government that we are now setting up this is in the laodicean church age book as we think of that city being the location of a great church council we see foreshadowed the ecumenical move taking place today we're in very soon we'll see all the so-called christians come together indeed this church and the state religion and politics are coming together the tares are being bound well if the tares are being bound the wheat is also being brought together amen it was a city of earthquake such earthquake that it was finally destroyed by it this is the age will end in god shaking the whole world that has gone off to make love with the old the harlot not only will the world systems crumble but every the very earth will be shaken and that to such a point that it will be renovated again for a millennial reign of christ hallelujah but the city was rich endowed with wealth full of culture science abound so much like today you know rich you know churches you know rich worship in beautiful formal and formal formalities but cold and dead cultures and education has taken the place of spirit given word and faith has been superseded by science so that man is a victim of materialism amen in every attribute ancient laodicea is found reborn in the 20th century's laodicean age it is the only the mercy of god that may those who have an ear to hear come out of her and not be partakers of her sins and the consequent judgment and here laodicea here's a message to laodicea in revelations 3 verse 15 it says i know thou works that thou are neither cold nor hot i would that work cold or hot so then because i want lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayeth something rich thou says isn't god saying they're saying this i'm rich increase with goods and have need of nothing no it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and the white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes out that thou mayest see he said i would that thou were cold or hot but because our lukewarm i'm going to spew you out of my mouth listen right here i'm going to tell you there's something i'm a lot more afraid of than the coveted that's the lukewarm flu that's going around it's a stronghold that's trying to take over people's lives amen the devil used covet to bring lukewarmness right into people's lives i've talked to ministers and pastors all over and they say we've not seen people a lot of people since coveted why it wasn't covered they kept them out the truth be known it was the lukewarmness of laodicea the stronghold of satan that's trying to come take over people's minds lukewarmness demands a penalty from god so therefore i don't want to be lukewarm i said god keep me from that let me let me have the inoculation you know people are so happy about this vaccine for the coven amen it's a man-made vaccine it does good and it's going to do evil it's off the tree of good and of good and neat knowledge of good and evil it can't help it it can only do what it's been made to do as i ever other vaccines there's a lot of good in them but there was also a lot of bad this is not going to be no different amen but i i'm here to tell you there's another vaccine this vaccine to protect you in the time of storms it'll protect you when all the world is going insane amen it ain't a man-made vaccine that has been built in less than a year it's a vaccine that's been proven over thousands of years and has not lost a case but people want to refuse it we'll get into that later and then they allow lukewarmness to come in as he would say pretty soon people start doing things they used to wouldn't do and they stopped doing things they used to do prayers out satan has designed this age that we're living in to take every bit of time you got and he's trying to destroy you and try to bring you down with the rest of the world and and and trying to bring luke warmness upon people to the point amen you can't hardly pipe them you can't hardly pump an amen out of them anymore if you can even get them to come to church and what is it this lukewarmness let's just get to the bones of it you say it was my it's my personality no it's lukewarmness because a seed of god cannot help but respond to the word of god it may not be a shout and dance up in the aisle but something on the inside of you being so lit up by the word of god that you can't help but hold and you can't hold it back it's there it's coming out of you why but why is people allowing things in their home they used to wouldn't allow lukewarmness why are people why are women putting stuff on their face they used to wouldn't do look warmness people like i said people are rejoicing about a vaccine over a covet that's you you've got about a 99 whatever percent chance of surviving on this right here if it takes you you have zero percent of surviving i'd be a lot more afraid of something that's got zero percent than 99 percent come on now but people will go they just live like it's going like it's just another day as usual you know just like they were in jesus day just another day things are but things are happening and things are being put it's just another day nothing really going on you know how people's minds have been so clouded up listen what we're seeing in our government is not about whether you agree with democrats or republicans what we're seeing in our government is satan coming into fulfillment it doesn't matter what side you feel you're on it's all the work of the s of the devil amen but people are and all these this age that we're living in it's a lukewarm age it don't really matter god didn't really don't really think that no more and people become lukewarm about scriptures that they used to hold very dear to their heart people become very lukewarm about gathering together which they used to hold very dear to their hearts people become very lukewarm about amen about their family life and things around that they used to hold dear to their heart people have become lukewarm about a lot of things it's creeping in it's a stronghold to try to hold you here listen the rapture the day of the rapture to many is going to be another day as usual but to some it's going to be the greatest day ever oh he cried out he's crying out in this last age you have the word you have the bible more bibles than ever but yet you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want you're not interested in living it you're interested in debating it i would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected if you were cold and rejected it i could i could stand there if you would get white hot and know it's the truth and live it i would praise you for it but when you simply take my word and don't honor it oh that's a sign of lukewarmness don't honor it how many people don't honor the presence of god no more it's a holy thing it's a it's a wonderful thing to be able to come into the presence of god but people don't honor it you know you walk into a a courtroom and the judge comes in my understanding is right you honor him by standing but you can see the presence of god sweep the sweep this audience and people just still sit in their seats and look around like nothing's going on what is it lukewarmness i'm not trying to say that you ought to be on your feet 100 of the time but when he comes in the room and it's very very obvious and very vivid when he comes in the room you realize something different is taking place that's the time to honor him lay aside the things that you're thinking about and the situations of tomorrow and yesterday and say i'm in the presence i'm not just some earthly judge i'm in the presence of the king of kings and the lord of lords therefore i'm going to honor him and worship him when he comes he says anybody knows that lukewarm water makes you sick to the stomach he says if you need something to cause you to vomit lukewarm water is about the best thing to drink a lukewarm church has made god sick and he's declared he would spew it out he said oh to god the church were cold or hot best of all she should be fervent if there's ever an hour to be fervent this is the hour if there's ever an hour to be sincere this is the hour if there's ever an hour to be looking for something to happen on a in a spiritual realm this is the hour if there was ever an hour to take advantage of every church service this is an hour if this is an hour if there's ever been an hour to be listening to tapes and reading your bible and praying this is the hour it says because thou sayest people may not say anything with their words about their lives but our lives speak volumes he said well i'm not trying to say i'm a christian well it's obvious when the white life you're living you're not amen because you can hear the word of god you can hear the the offer given for inoculation and you won't take it we see we see it here let me go back to where i was so because thou says they were talking as the mouthpiece of god they were trying to say things when god what god they were trying to say things that god wasn't saying you know the catholic church even says she speaks for god god help us if that's god's voice saying she has assured the voice of the lord how how any people can be so spiritually wicked is more than i know but they produce according to the seed which is in them the label to see in churches say it i am rich increased with goods and have need of nothing that was her self estimate that was not what god thought about her she looked at herself and what she saw and she said i'm rich which means she's wealthy in the things of this world thou says i'm increased with good which means i have which literally means i have spiritual wit riches that sounds like the millennium a street of gold and presence of god but there was very lacking in spiritual things you know it says brother branham puts us here he says if the church is truly spiritual rich its influence will be felt upon the community life wow we're here right now at the last calls go out into the highways and the byways beg them to come so that my table may be filled we're seeing it happen if there ever ought to be a time our church is felt in our community it ought to be this time right now this is why you're seeing people show up off the streets you're seeing people stop for no reason seemingly and just say i felt they came come here why because there's something that we have here that the world didn't give and the world can't take away amen you know he said exactly what kind of lives are these so-called spiritual influential men in the community living out in suburbia out in better class districts said let me tell you what kind of lives there wife swapping prostitution bands of children crashing parties exacting a terrible toll on property damage hello immorality has reached an all-time high in promiscuous sex acts narcotic addictions gambling stealing and all kinds of evil and the church goes on claiming how fine this generation is how full our churches are how responsive amen the mission fields are the church has turned to the people over to doctors especially psychiatrists amen how how he can parade about being spiritually rich is more than i know it isn't true they're bankrupt and they don't know it he said take a good look examine the people as you walk by in the multitudes can you pick out those who have a appearance of christians it's almost gotten possible you don't know the christians from the atheist anymore out in the world but yet apparently some supposedly dress don't matter watch how they dress watch how they act hear what they say see where they go surely there ought to be some real evidence of the new birth amongst all those who see we see go by but few there be and it's getting fewer and fewer and fewer yet the fundamental churches are crying out saying we've had millions saved this year and spirit filled and they call spirit filled those who frizz bobbed hair and shorts and slacks and painted up like jezebels hello message churches are calling women's spirit filled and they got pain all over their you're not spirit filled not by the holy spirit your spirit filled but by a different spirit it's still the word whether you want it or whether you don't want it what's problem lukewarmness likes a days ago daddies are out worried about money more than they're worried about their family got to have a job got to have this lukewarmness is taking over minds it's a stronghold it's taking over families he said he's gotten to such a point he said i would hate to even witness have to witness a display of in modesty what's called a display of miss he said it's so immodest i'd hate to know what a real display of modesty is because it's called morality and good people and everything's okay but if we see this world that we're living in they're saying i have need of nothing what they're saying is i have needed no need of god oh they want stuff they want more money they want more items they want more objects they want more lands they want more houses they're saying i don't need god and this is the world that we're living in amen i have need of nothing i have everything i want hello somebody i have everything i want you can spread express this any way you want and all it adds up to the fact that the church is complacent she's satisfied with what she has i don't want to be satisfied with what i have i don't want to be satisfied with the experience i have i want more of god i don't want to be satisfied with one good church service i want more good church service i don't want to be satisfied with one time the holy ghost falls in in the building we're all happy and we go oh no i wanted every service i don't want to be a halfway half-living nominal christian that's not who i'm called to be i'm not called to be a baptist message believer i'm not called to be a methodist message believer i mean i'm not called to be none of that i'm called to be his and live with for him with all my heart but lukewarmness is settling hearts well we're not a baptist but we act like one we dress like one we live like one you know we bring things in our homes maybe this is my new year service we bring stuff in our home sometimes we allow it to take preeminence why lukewarmness things that i'm talking about is not of god but actually angels angel god would warn the prophet about it tvs things that we put there before amen ourselves and and we feast upon them and feed upon them and we got it there i know today it may not be a tv it's hulu or something else my wife was actually telling him a man and his wife about the about the situation that when the devil talked about the tv there at youth camp trying to hear they had the tv on their wall and just trying to witness to them about what god is doing and we need to be more sincere more fervent not so caught up in these things and he just dismissed it as well i can understand if you really had a problem with it that was his answer that was his cop-out that the devil would call it out if you had a problem with it what is it lukewarmness people were drying up even before coven pastors were talking about they couldn't hardly get people to come on a wednesday night anymore sundays was but you know more about the ball game they had to go to or this that and the other whatever some other thing they had to go through too let's be honest people in this age is the age of easy living so we can become professional vacation goers and it's all about our pleasures and what we have and it's nothing no more about the kingdom of god and his righteousness and the fervent desire that we once used to have this is what happened in ephesus they lost their first love what happened luke warmness came in this is where we want to guard ourselves against it and realize satan is trying to do everything he can to steal the joy of god away from us to steal the joy of his presence and being in his presence and living for him satan's doing everything he can to destroy it make us complacent but god saw entirely different from what they saw they said they were rich spiritually wealthy they had arrived they had need of nothing but god said you're wretched miserable poor blind and naked and when a people are that way especially naked and don't know it there's something wrong somewhere surely something must be happening god also calls the church of laodicean age wretched he says the word comes from two greek words which means endure and trial it has nothing to do with trials that come to a true christian for god describes a christian trial as blessed and his attitude one of joy whereas he does this description his phrase phrase wretched and miserable and how how strange and the age of plenty miserable in an age of progress wretched and miserable in an age of abundance wretched and miserable how can there be trials in such a time it's strange but in the age of plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there's so much more to be had what with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as such to alarm a nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pep pills in the morning rushing to doctors in an institution trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol this age boasts of his tremendous stores of worldly goods but this people are less happier than ever so it tells me there's nothing in this age you're gonna find happiness in amen this age boasts of his spiritual attainments but most more people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boasts a better morals but is more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about knowledge and science but it's losing a battle in all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend and keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth in one generation we've gone from a horse and buggy to a space age and we're proud and boasting about it but inside it's dark void caverns that's crying out and torment without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear the world is darkening and to where it could be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it can't back it up it cries peace but there'll be no peace did you hear that it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with a desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace says my god to the wicked they're miserable which means they're objects to be pitied they scorn pity they're full of pride they bought what they have but what they have will not stand the test of time they built upon the quicksand rather the rock of the revelation of god's word soon cometh the earthquake soon there will become storms of the wrath of god and judgment then comes sudden destruction in spite of all their carnal preparation they will still be unprepared for what's coming upon the earth they are those who spite of all their worldly efforts are actually opposing themselves and don't know it objects of pity are they indeed pity the poor people in the last economic medical move for they call it the move of god when it indeed is the move of satan pity don't envy them pity them they're poor this is what god is saying they're poor well i've never seen such wealth look at mr jeff bezos or whatever his name is wealthiest man wow such wealth never been such a wealthy man but indeed he's poor could you imagine the richest man on earth be the poorest man at the same time we see we see also he said they're blind and naked now this is really desperate how can anyone be blind and naked and don't know it what is it they can't perceive it they can't understand they've been blinded by the glare of an age and their eyes have caught the wrong thing you know brother danny steeman brought out in our one of our youth banquets here a couple of years ago about the sea turtles and how you know they're born on the beach and they've had to actually go and and change things the way they we they have built through the years because you know it would it would be the the sea that would catch the eye of the turtle the glistening of it at night as it would maybe catch the moon or or the stars that when they'd come out and they'd be born in the darkness that they would catch that and they would go that away he said well what happened with cities being built lights were put up and they would catch the light of the city and they would go the wrong way and we're seeing people heading the wrong way i'm going to take it a little down a little further i'm not even talking about the world we know where it's going i'm talking about people in our churches headed the wrong way their families are headed the wrong direction what is it they've caught the wrong light and he said those turtles instead of finding their life in the sea and growing up they they actually become smashed under a tire somewhere because they caught the wrong light and people are being caught up with the light of laodicea and this glare the frizzles and the boom and the shouts and oh this problem over here and that over there and they're being blinded by it blindness has taken in we see as we're going down read this here he said they have become blind because they refused the word of god these are they who have stripped themselves naked by leaving god's care and protection and sought to build their own way of salvation their own tower of babel oh how lovely and beautifully dressed they appear in their own eyes as they form their general assemblies and their councils but now god is stripping it all the way and they're naked for their organizations have led them into the camp of the antichrist into the field of tares right to the binding and burning objects of pity indeed they are yes pity them warn them beseech them still they go their way headlong to destruction wrathfully turning away any and all attempts to save them as brands from the burning miserable indeed they are yet they know it ought not callous and beyond hope they glory in what is actually their shame define against the word yet one day they'll be judged by that same word and pay the price of its indictments as we talked about it people are all caught up in this new vaccine and i'm not going to say whether you should take it or you shouldn't take it they think it's the savior curing all problems the world pro listen this is only the beginning if you felt unrest during this time you don't want to be here when the bride leaves if you felt anxiety during this time you don't want to be here when the bride leaves amen they're thinking it'll cure the worry and the anxiety yet there's a vaccine that's available that if you don't take it there's zero survival rate if you don't take it there's a zero percent of a rapture rate you will go into destruction and wake the judgment and this vaccine is not a man-made vaccine it's a god-made vaccine it's been tested it's been tried and it's shown over thousands of years to hold true amen it held through the dark ages some of the darkest times even when women would watch their kids but brains be bashed out it held it was they took the vaccine they took price they took the answer and it held and you're seeing a little bit of a sickness come by with 99.7 and people are falling away why they haven't taken the vaccine because this vaccine holds when you see these signs coming you're not going to fall away you're going to go further in to christ say man you know brother brown would talk about a vaccine he says you know a man dying on the doorsteps of a doctor's office when the doctor in the building has a cure for his disease but he refuses to take it if a man has a disease and the doctor has a cure for it the man may lay on the doctor's doorsteps but if he refuses to take the medicine he'll die and we're not talking about a vaccine that may we're talking about a cure amen we're talking a cure a man may lay on the doctor's doorsteps but if he refuses it he'll die you can't blame the doctor the doctor tried to give it to him if he'd only come and take it but it isn't the doctor's fault he's got the remedy but men is too stubborn to take it then whose fault is it he said oh praise the lord thank you so what about this he says people die in the front of churches on steps in pews they die in their sins because they refuse the cure there is a cure for laodicea there is a cure for this lukewarmness there is something that will break the stronghold of laodicea for lives i know it's going to break strongholds off of lies because he promised it would he said to him that overcometh they die in their sins because they refuse it not because there wasn't any there is cure there is a a vaccine there is a serum there is a remedy however you want to word it but you got to take it we have a few brother tim's use this analogy it's really good but we have a few cows left and we're planning to get rid of this spring we're looking out there and we see some of them that's sowing signs of being wormy weights falling off and they're getting what they call bottle jaw and they they they're appetiting there and so we know they need a medicine in a few days lord well i'm gonna go out there and i'm gonna put them in a pen and i'm gonna sort them out and i'm gonna put them through a chute they're not gonna like it they're not going to want to be there they're going to hate it they're going to fight every step of the way but they ain't got a choice because i have a system designed that's going to get them to where i need them to be to administer what i need to administer but people can come to a church the man of god can pour his heart out the medicine that is needed for the cure of sin the medicine that is needed to take the pain off your face the medicine are needed that'll give you joy unspeakable and full of glory the medicine that is needed that'll heal families the medicine that is needed to put them all back together again amen he'll deliver it but the difference is you have a choice but if you die it won't be the preacher's fault because he'd been preaching the word of god if you go into destruction it won't be this pulpit's fault because you've heard the war how he's heard the warnings i mean he's heard the word priests over this pulpit without fear of favor amen so if somebody goes there it's not because it hasn't been given or a way out it's because they choose it he said they die sitting right on a pew he said it wasn't because there wasn't done there it was there but men and women just refuse to take it they die right there in the church sitting in meetings listen night after night to inspired prophets of god who take the world word fearlessly and lay it out ye must be born again men and women set in the pew and die and sink into utter despair annihilated from god not because there wasn't grace and salvation but it was because they refused to receive it and this is what he said is there no bomb in gilead then why is the daughter of my people so sick isn't there a physician there to sure there is isn't there prophet sure there is isn't there preachers sure there is isn't there a word of god that's true and infallible sure there is why are they sick because they won't take the medicine they refuse it now we know medicine has been tested they find a what we might call a toxin they put some kind of other stuff with it try it on a guinea pig and and that you know after they work with it for for a time they shoot it into this pig to watch the reaction and if it doesn't hurt him they try to use it on humans but medicine is a chance to take let's just be honest the vaccine at his best is a chance to take that's why i we've always prayed you know when you take vaccine vaccinations lord let this thing do what it's supposed to do and don't let no harm come from it brother tim was talking about it there they shall drink no deadly drink drink it if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them it's very applicable to this age there's people with cancer having to take some deadly stuff but i pray that that stuff goes and kills the cancer medicine is a chance to take medicines will help one human being and might kill another one you know mercy you're hearing advertisements of medicine don't listen to that fast talking if you catch that you won't take any medicine man there's all kinds of stuff that stuff can possibly do sometimes you might must be sure that you know what you're doing let a doctor that knows how to give it someone you got confidence in he said we hear so much today about heart disease heart troubles the number one killer in america heart trouble sin is the number one he said heart trouble is not the number one killer sin is the number one killer sin is what does the kid killing you might be able to pat your body up for a little while but the body's going to die anyhow and go into the dust but the soul will live somewhere you under that's the killer is sins of the soul that's the number one killer in america so if we know what the number one killer which by the way it's come out that we have set a record this year this past year for cancer deaths it's the lowest ever how's that food for thought i'll leave you with it covet ain't the number one killer cancer is not the number one killer heart trouble is not the one number one killer and people get all worked up about it sin is the number one killer and sin is trying to permeate your lives and come in day after day laodicea is kind of like sandpaper is constantly there rubbing against you you can take a sandpaper light as it can be and you rub it long enough it'll rub this wood completely out of existence it's the truth and laodicea we've watched it on people's lives it is totally amen it went right down to the baptist baptist or today not what they used to be pentecostals today are not what they used to be why lukewarmness of laodicea there i say message people many of them are not what they used to be what is it laodicea is constantly against your convictions against your god against everything that's godly trying to rub it all out we are seeing the world that's trying to rub out anything to do with god sin is the number one killer so why wouldn't you take that vaccine he said the man just lay there and just die why don't you just go in and get the medicine he said you can talk to them about their soul and the sin and their life yet people won't go in it's their unbelief if you believe god you'd rush to calvary just as quick as you could god has a remedy for unbelief god has a remedy for anxiety god has a remedy for fear god has a remedy for every sickness god has a remedy for everything the devil could ever do to you or put upon you god has a remedy for it you talked about when they had diphtheria and there was no toxin many people died it was a time there was no toxin for typhoid fever they got toxins there were vaccines today for those things he said there was a time when there was no bomb in gilead for your sin but that's not today for in the day in the house of david the house of god is a fountain open for you to be washed and cleaned again and made new and though your sins be as scarlet they can be made white as snow amen men and women who's been made in the image of god stand and say that god's word's not right they doubt this they doubt whether it's so or not there is a fountain to take care of that there is a fountain that will take care of your doubts and your fears and your anxiety there is a fountain for that but you got to drink it we can go a long time in that right there but for time's sake i'm gonna move on brother timothy this is a terrible age yeah this is a dark age dark your darkest ever yes spiritually black yes is anyone going to overcome this age is anyone ever really going to make it he said so to him that overcometh oh how many overcomers do we have will i grant to sit with me in my throne oh my back you got that verse could you pull it up for me amen sit with me in my throne even as i also overcome and have set down in my father's throne he that hath and hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now go back about three uh maybe three verses let me look at it i'll just go back i think this is where i want to be i counsel thee to buy me gold strident of fire that thou mayest be rich now you're noticing he's given the vaccine white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes out that thou mayest see there is a people that's going to accept this vaccine that's going to tear down the strongholds of laodicea there will not be a laodicean lukewarm and ungodly and without god will but will be on fire with the fire of almighty god there is a people who will be on fire with the holy ghost in the darkest ages there ever been next verse as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent next verse behold i stand at the door and knock but you got something to do service after service after service he knocks and you hear his voice but you've got to open the door be honest i wonder how many has heard his voice but they failed to open the door because if you open the door i will come into you and i will sup i will have fellowship i'll i will reveal myself with you to you just like he did to those that was on the road to emmaus as he begged him they they held him they said no no no don't leave come on in and he come in and he began to reveal who he really was the way he broke bread he broke bread and there was another piece there he broke bread and there was another piece there they knew who he was because they seen him do it before hallelujah to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne so he could not make this statement unless there was going to be an overcomer amen i will grant to sit with me in my throne even as i'm also overcome and have set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches listen we got we got hebrews 11 they can tell you people that listen to the voice of god not only listen but they received it and they acted upon it they just didn't allow it to go in one ear and out the other no but they'd heard it they received it and they acted upon it and there's also a people here in this hour that's hearing the word receiving the word and acting upon the word hallelujah amen this is why paul would say hey we've got a great cloud of witnesses that this power works that there this god works he's not going to leave us alone he's not going to leave us by herself he's with enoch he was with noah he was with moses there's all kind of testimonies god has never left any one of his and he's not going to start now amen we've got a cloud of witnesses and so therefore if we've got this cloud of witnesses and saying god's going to do what he said he would do then let's lay aside every week let's lay aside the lukewarmness of laodicea let's lay aside our bitterness just say something right there there's people in this church that's carried bitterness too long it's time to lay it down i don't care who it's against or who it's about lay it down this ain't the time for that this is a time to lay aside every weight amen it's time to get real and get right with god lay aside every way and the sin that was though so easily beset us and run with patience the race that has set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who is the joy who for the joy was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endures such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and feign in your minds this laodicea takes over your mind jesus what an example he didn't he he didn't put it in he didn't put this vaccine or this serum in a guinea pig he came down and he tried it in himself that's when you know a man's got confidence in what he's got god had confidence therefore he came down he said i'll take it and i'll show you it works and he took it at the river jordan and it kept him in the trials of life and the mocking and all the problems that came his way it kept him i'm thankful we're not dependent upon some man-made vaccine but we're dependent upon a god-made word that's going to take us out of here i don't know about you but that makes me very happy to think about that that i'm not staying here this world is not my home could you imagine not having a hope and you're wondering what's happening right now and what's going on disturbed there's a lot of disturbed people right now worried people anxiety to this fullness men's hearts are failing for fear why because laodicea and his lukewarmness has put their eyes out and they can't see but thank god for myself you know i went through the different times i believe it was about three times he mentioned it as far as mentioning the vision but i believe he told it about three times what i found so far of the bride the church and the bride the preview but in the masterpiece he says one thing that caught my attention he said that that last time as that bride came through he said there was a few in the back he said it started to get out of step he said what was they was not looking at the right thing he said they was looking at the church going in chaos we've got to keep our eyes on jesus he's the one who started the work he's the one who's going to finish the work he's not going to get to this age and say i quit we're only at the beginning it's going home time it's time to take a body change god bless you tonight liz bowery heads you need a determination i'm not going down in defeat that's not who i am i'm determined to see jesus when you come with that determination god will make a way for you to see he will show himself to you how many tonight just examine your lives say god i've allowed lukewarmness to come in i need that fervor lord a fervent desire that first love coldness laodicea is wearing upon people and people are falling away what about you i wanted me to just say lord i want another drink of the fountain i want another drink from you lord i want you more than
