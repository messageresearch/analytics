as a medical sales rep for several cranial orthopedic and spinal implant companies living in california oklahoma and louisiana he later became foreman for sure tree service where he enjoyed the challenges both physically and mentally of taking trees down safely and efficiently he had the same skills and mechanical ingenuity as his father and he loved challenges being very goal oriented his greatest joy though was undeniably his boys he loved being with them taking them fishing camping playing with them and spending time with them he was so looking forward to making more memories with them and we with him you know we're all here today because we had the opportunity and the privilege to know nathan in some way many of you knew him as a marine brave and courageous who gave so much for this country many of us knew him in the years before that and after his his military service nathan was such a a brilliant kid as we were coming up and as mentioned in his obituary he was he was full of ingenuity and determination if he didn't know how to do something he was going to find out he was going to do everything he could within his power to figure it out because he didn't accept defeat very well he was sharp he was quick-witted and he was driven nathan was blessed to be part of a wonderful family and he came from a very strong family heritage his great grandfather carl williams was the president of the chapter of full gospel businessmen in phoenix arizona his grandfather earl williams was a wonderful man who himself was involved in missions work he a wonderful he has a wonderful christian grandmother sister helen williams his uncle daniel was a minister who touched lives around the world his dad brother jerry as i knew him served in the air force and was a deacon here in this church and one of the hardest working men i've ever known his mom sister rachel a wonderful example of what a christian mother is to be nathan was raised with an incredible support group an incredible support structure around him he was raised by a family of leaders and in turn he became a leader and those of you here today that served with him or worked with him or interacted with him in any way would say that it showed that the structure he had in the life that he had he was raised by salt of the earth hard working good people there was something about him that wanted to be the best something that wanted to work something that wanted to excel in everything that he did he was driven just like his dad nathan show was my friend many of the memories in my life from the fourth grade up until he left for the naval academy include nathan i have memories from waterman i have memories from the a-frame house there on sugar creek road have memories from the house on drew lane i even have memories from the house there on hartwell he moved a lot but the phone number never changed i dialed 377725 many times the memories start early riding to school with anna and jessica and nathan in the green nova man that was a cool car we were so dumb we thought it was we hated that car you get older you're like man we were going to school in a nova thing was awesome jumping out of the tree house at waterman jessica and nathan they would jump out like they were some kind of gymnasts and land and do something really acrobatic and neat and then i'd trampoline would send me wherever it decided to spend a lot of time being the un-athletic pers an athletic person in my groups riding bikes 100 miles an hour down that hill that seemed to go on forever and you got to the bottom and regretted it because then you had to find a way back up i was too out of shape to ride my bike back up so i'd always have to walk it back camping at mount nebo strapping a canoe to the top of his mom's ford taurus and taking it down to door cheek to go fishing same fort taurus that somehow i let him convince me one night to wait till everybody was asleep and we pushed it out of the carport until he pushed it down the road a little bit drove it around the block if you were just kids drove around the block a few times just because he wanted to see if we could do it we did it stopped about a quarter mile away and pushed it back to the house swimming in the bar pits there at the camp on highway 371 for hours by ourselves either too young to realize it was full of alligators or too stupid to care was a natural runner and like everything that he did when he found out he was good at it or found out he wanted to do it he went out at full force he won all kind of awards around here locally and even became the state champion of louisiana at a sibley high school in distance running once again he excelled i remember the excitement of your appointment to the u.s naval academy i vividly remember the morning you left the breakfast at denny's before you got on the plane off to annapolis in a career in the marines and once again you excelled many of you could come up here and have story after story to tell about nathan memories that you have of him our memories that you created together and i want to challenge everyone gathered here today to let that be what we remember most about nathan the family the friends the memories the hours spent together whether it was car trips to church breakfast before school a camping trip thanksgiving dinner or shoulder to shoulder in the middle east remember the excellence that he strove to achieve i'm not going to let the tragedy that took nathan away from us define him in my memory there's no room in my memory for the negative it's full of positive good memories of a man who excelled at everything he did there's awesome memories success a driven person the tragedy and a and maybe even what we would call the closing scenes of his life here on earth the final days or the final months do not define a lifetime they do not define a lifetime of excellence a lifetime of so much to be proud of in his life nathan spent much more time exhale excelling than he ever did failing he spent much more time winning than he ever did losing he spent more time leading from the front than he ever did standing in the bat his actions in iraq and afghanistan i'm told gave other men the opportunity to be successful the opportunity to return home and today he has given us all an opportunity an opportunity to examine ourselves and our lives nathan's opportunities here on this earth they may be over but for you here today opportunity still remains opportunity to better yourself opportunity for relationships opportunity for making special moments with your family an opportunity to have a relationship with god and as a leader of men one i believe that was respected and loved by all those who fought alongside him i believe that nathan would want each of us today to find value where true value lies he would say no matter how hard the battle is today push forward no matter the heartaches and struggles have your hug your loved ones tight today and treasure every moment don't waste a moment on things that don't matter but turn your attention to those things those people that truly matter to those things which are worth fighting for look to eternal things for they will last forever i believe he would exhort each of us to do that because nathan was a leader one who you could count on when it was danger close rest easy friend that brother aaron at this time we're going to ask nathan's niece and nephew to come and sing josiah and rebecca to sing beulah land uh [Music] for a country to which i've never been before no sad goodbyes oh there will be spoken for time won't matter [Music] anymore [Music] and someday [Music] my [Music] [Music] be [Music] i'm looking now across the river [Music] [Applause] just [Music] is [Music] heavenly [Music] someday [Music] shall be [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] shall be [Music] amen amen as you can see this today we have quite a few of nathan's comrades that are here with us to support the family and support us during this time and and on the behalf of the family we would really like to thank you all for for coming and being a part and also for your service to our country it's much appreciated and and we want to thank you from the bottom of our heart at this time we have gunnery sergeant michael jeremy united states marine corps retired he is here with us today he has a few words to speak he was nathan's gunnery sergeant in his first battalion so we're going to invite him to come and and just say what's up on his heart thank you i hope y'all can understand me because i live uh five hours down the road by you country and i'm not i don't know if i can speak to english y'all do nate and i had a very special relationship what you see right now is very rare you will never see a staff non-commissioned officer talk about one of their junior officers the way i do when nate found out i was from louisiana he automatically became my best friend uh he called he outranked me technically but i was the gunnery sergeant i'm the gunny nate walked into office one day said how's it going mike the marines know about that almost had a heart attack i said excuse me he goes michael i said have you lost your mind and that was basically our relationship and how it started off uh he would eat stuff off of my desk like if i had cookies if i had potato chips something like that nate would eat them and later on be like hey gunny they were good i'm like thank you uh nate was a pain in my butt a lot of times but the thing that i saw nate was he always took a chance and he always pushed himself over the edge and having the experience i had i knew that's exactly the kind of lieutenant he needed to be especially in the infantry because he would have to make quick decisions he would have to take that chance when the time come down to it and when the time came down to it nate was a lion in combat that big smiley face he had oh man i thought that used to drive me crazy i was like why you always smiling but anyway when he got to combat and nate was put to the test nate was an absolute lion he was exactly what the marine corps wanted out of a young officer nate called in danger close a10 strikes within 70 yards of positions and i was bringing up a relief column and he inadvertently actually helped me i'm standing here today more likely because of nate and he didn't even know he was calling in to support what i was trying to support him uh my wife loved nate he uh i lived like i said i live five hours from here nate would show up at dinner time and i would get a phone call gunny what nate hey i'm i'm in your driveway okay nate come on in and he would do stuff but uh it's really hard for me to talk about him because um if i ever had a son nate's the closest thing to a son i would ever have he is exactly what i would want out of the sun he was he'd get in a little bit of trouble had that dariness and give 110 and it is absolutely i tried i was going to write a big speech i opened my bible and i had my notepad and every time i tried to write something these guys would call and ask me it was like the old days i could get nothing done so it's all i had guidance i had guidance just get up here and speak from the heart instead of writing something out and it's the biggest honor of my life to have served with nate and these guys he was absolutely like i said if i ever had a son that would be nate and it's a privilege and an honor y'all allowing me to come up here and uh speak about nate today and um we're gonna missionate we're gonna miss you you uh you pulled out a little bit too early i thought you would be speaking for me i never thought i'd be out speaking for one of my boys and uh we love you nate and that's a chaplain that cash i'd like to bring you up here this is our old battalion chaplain and uh he's going to speak a full a few words thanks kenny thank you i do have a few notes uh my name is chaplain cash and i was nate's uh chaplain and the chaplain to most of these men here in iraq gosh 16 to 19 years ago and first let me just say to rachel and to jessica and anna and boys uh it's an honor for us to be here to support you and to tell a larger story and to represent the greater marine corps family of which nathan was such a significant part pastor pruitt it is an honor to be here and i want to thank you i want to thank evening light tabernacle for your faithfulness to christ for your example uh in this community for your love for the show family and for your allowing us to come and be here with you today on on this important day of seeking the lord in matthew 21 jesus tells the parable of a father and his two sons we're told a father goes to his first son and he asks him to work in the field to which the son responds i will not but after much regret the son goes and he does the thing the father has asked the father then goes to the second son with the same question go work in the field today to which the son responds yes father i will but in the end this son does not go and do the thing the father has asked jesus asks which of the two sons did the will of the father it's a rhetorical question for we all know that the one who did the will of the father was the one who felt regret for his actions but finally did the thing that was asked of him i have always found great comfort in this parable for it teaches us that in the end a life is not measured by the things we regret for we all have them but rather by what we've actually done in response to the father's will you see god sees the whole story of our lives he sees it all he knows the challenges we faced as children and young adults the battles that we fought that no one else could know about he knows the deep regrets with which we have wrestled in dark and difficult hours the trauma that lay beneath the surface that we may not even be able to articulate he knows those inner triumphs those victories that we won that were not apparent to other people those efforts where we tried to make things right he knows the dark night of the soul where we cried out to god for help in pain and distress he sees the whole story and knowing the whole story he loves us let me mention two triumphs in nathan's story represented by these men who served with him first nathan loved and served his nation at a time when our nation was at war when others were were talking about freedom and talking about courage and defending a cherished way of life nate actually did it he did the thing that god had called him to do he raised his right hand to serve as an officer in the united states marine corps and that service took him to war there's an iconic photo of of nathan that the gun he just alluded to where he's calling in an airstrike in baghdad his eyes are zeroed in on the enemy his face is steeled to make that dangerous decision that would ultimately save lives what an embodiment of that courage and courageous service to our nation that nathan performed and this kind of service pleases the lord i think of the apostle paul in romans 13 who talks about the man under arms who confronts evil and defends the innocent this man we are told does not bear the sword in vain but in fact is god's minister in a sense bringing about justice and the fruits of peace and freedom to others nathan as well as so many others many of whom are here today did just that they loved and served their nation at a time when service would mean danger and devotion and we all know sacrifice i've often thought this is why god had such a love has such a love for soldiers and centurions in the bible he understood them their duty their discipline their sacrifice that greater love whereby a man is willing to lay down his life for his friends in fact whenever you open the pages of the new testament you always see them there like like nathan soldiers and men under arms near to jesus or the apostles at the gaining edge of the kingdom of god they're there it was a group of soldiers who were among the first to go to the jordan river and hear john the baptist preach it was a centurion about whom jesus said not in all israel have i seen such great faith it was a centurion who looked up at jesus on the cross and declared surely this was the son of god soldiers centurions guards sailors were there as the church grew to become a light to the nations we think of cornelius a commander of many to whom peter was sent to preach the gospel in acts the ship's guard who conducted the apostle paul to safe passage that he might stand before kings with the message of christ nathan was one of these very men near to the heart of the lord and one who heard the father's call to serve a greater purpose than himself and he did the thing his father had asked him to do he loved and served his nation but even more and i think all these men would agree he loved and he served as men time would not permit me to speak of all the ways that nate loved his brothers but their presence demonstrates that he loved them and he loved them to the very end he took care of their needs to see that their needs were met and not just their physical and logistical needs as a good leader does but i would venture to say their spiritual needs as well in 2002 when it became clear that we were going to to war in iraq general mattis who went on to become the secretary of defense called a meeting of all of his battalion commanders in first marine division to discuss the coming operation and their responsibility as leaders to ensure that their men were ready one of the points general mattis made was a charge to his commanders to ensure that before their marines went into harm's way that all of their marines had an opportunity to make their peace with god that came from the commanding general he told them with everything you are as you prepare you meant your men make sure they have access to their chaplain that they have the moment and the opportunity to pray before we go into battle well alpha company took this to heart and these men know the men i'm talking about captain sokol first sergeant james green nate shaw and many others look for every opportunity they could find to get chaplains to their men and i was fortunate to be one of those chaplains whether it camp pendleton in yuma in the mojave desert at 29 palms or in iraq we spent a lot of time seeking the lord together and drawing strength for the difficult hours that lay ahead and the drill was pretty simple i would roll up in a humvee and we would let the tailgate down which would serve as our makeshift altar and there we would do church we prayed together we strengthened each other by fellowship we opened our bibles and we heard the lord we took communion together we laid hands on each other and the lord was there and that was 16 years ago i will tell you i don't know that i've ever sensed the presence of god like i did in those services i still say that today and nate was a part of all of that he made it happen one of my clearest memories of nate leading in this way was in the fall of 2002 and 29 palms at our combined arms exercise better known as cats in the mojave desert we were coming to the end of that 30-day operation and i had determined on that last day or two that if i could find alpha company before the sun went down i would provide a worship service for them well i tried i looked my rp and i who's my assistant drove uh as as best we could we could not find them before night fell and so the sun went down darkness descended and i went into my tent about an hour later i heard a voice and it was nate's a voice in the dark chaplin has anyone seen the chaplain where is the chaplain i leaned out my head from the tent and all i could see was the red lens flashlight waving around and his voice yelling as loud as he could while maintaining noise discipline chaplain where is the chaplain i went out i said nate i'm here he said sir alpha company's assembled we're ready follow me so i got my red lens flashlight i got in my humvee with my assistant and we followed nate through the dark and dust of that mountainous terrain where he led me to alpha company 1-5 and there 130 marines on the side of a hill were waiting to worship the lord under the brightest stars i've ever seen my text that night was very simple second timothy 1 7 for god has not given you a spirit of fear but power love and a sound mind brothers and sisters i think in a very real way nate is leading us once again to that place i don't see a red lens flashlight waving right now but i do see through his life and his death nate calling us with some urgency to consider that great promise for god has not given you a spirit of fear but power and love and a sound mind to the shoal family to rachel to anna and jessica boys god has not given you a spirit of fear for he walks with you he walks with you you can trust him to give you the power and the strength you need to walk in love for each other and find his peace amidst great loss for the lord is good a strong hold in the day of trouble and he knows those who trust in him to the marines of first battalion fifth marines and alpha company and others who served with nate god has not given us a spirit of fear but power love and a sound mind the challenges difficulties and battles you have all faced the small steps of faithfulness and victories that no one sees the lord knows all about it he sees the whole story of your life and my life and he loves you and the lord doesn't speak in tones of fear and judgment for that is not why he came but rather grace and mercy and forgiveness and love and power to follow him if we will turn our eyes upon the lord and follow nate's lead we will know his presence and a sound mind no matter what battles we have fought no matter what wounds we have felt for he will keep them in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon him thanks be to god for the life of nathan shaw thanks be to god for the promise of the holy spirit who binds our wounds and strengthens our hearts and thanks be to god for his most indescribable gift in his son jesus christ amen amen thank you very much both of you for your service and for these words of encouragement today let's sing this song amazing grace my chains are gone right after this ask brother philip to come and sing for us amazing grace how sweet [Music] [Music] was [Music] through many dangers [Music] i am [Music] and grace will lead [Music] i've been set free my god my stay [Music] his mercy raised [Music] amazing grace the lord has promised good to me his word my face [Music] my chains are [Music] been gone free [Music] [Music] peace [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] me [Music] amazing [Music] and my heart bleeds i will not question the way he leads [Music] i will not question this broken heart and we'll talk [Music] we'll talk it over my lord and um [Music] and [Music] a smile and wait for reasons [Music] to he tried me i'll know i'll find [Music] that all my birds [Music] and we'll talk it over [Music] my lord [Music] the reason [Music] you tell me why [Music] he's got it all in control he's got it all in control [Music] he's got it all hand controlled well i'm so glad he's got it all in control amen because when our life seems out of control we need an anchor we need someone for strength and we have almighty god for that i'd like to read from the word of god this afternoon from john chapter 3 verse 14 which says as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life so for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the worlds who condemned the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not on him not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god the salt family here has been really faithful members of eden and light tabernacle for nearly four decades and brother jerry shells served as one as our deacons here in this church for nearly almost that long as well and we want to express our love to sister rachel brother joe's sister jessica and family and brother craig and sister anna booer and their family today as we share um in this moment as we tribute give tribute to their loved one nathan that we all loved the awful news of nathan's passing reached all of us as we were intending an old-fashioned tent revival in virginia and god had just divinely orchestrated it that sister rachel would receive this news and she would be surrounded there by her daughters and some very dear friends of hers and and each day the family was ministered to and was supported by the word of god and the love and the prayers of many saints and all of this reminds us of how mindful that god is in our time of need and we've read today of a wonderful savior our god who is a loving god who is not willing that any should perish in fact god so loved the world that he left all of heaven to come to earth and he took on flesh to be one of us to fight the same human battles that we fight and he did it all for the purpose of redemption and jesus did not come to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and i'm so glad today as we stand here that today is not a day of judgment and times like these do not require us to make a decision of anyone's destiny except that of our own and today though is a day of mercy it is a day of grace it is a time where love is held out to all who will accept god's pardon and grace and mercies the book of james says there will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others but if you have been merciful god will be merciful when he judges you so instead of passing judgment we are here today to show mercy love and give comfort and this is the day we can put our loved ones into the hands of a just and merciful god who understands the heart of man and who was unwilling that any man should perish but wants to give life more than he wants to give death so we're here today to commit nathan into the hands of a god who knows the heart and a god who is so rich in mercy today is a day that we must trust where we have to trust in a god knowing that there is no one more kinder more gentle more loving more understanding who judges the heart and not just the actions of man proverbs 3 and 5 tells us to trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to thy known understanding but in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct that path so we are here today to trust in the lord and to acknowledge him so he can do that direct our path the question that we often ponder is why would god take the life of the ones we love but let me tell you today that's not the god that i know and it's not the god of the bible this is something though that many people misunderstand about god they think of him as a heartless being that would rip a person from the earth as nathan was in this horrible incident but this is not god's doing god is not the cause of death rather he is the cause and the giver of life so how is this that this happens we would have to go back in the beginning and see what the bible says that in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he brought forth the light upon the earth and he saw the light and said it is good and then he separated the land from the seas and god saw that and he said it was good and then god planted the earth with grass and trees and god saw that it was good and then god placed life into the oceans upon dry ground and god saw it was good and finally the scripture sums it all up and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good so god made everything on earth good and perfect just like heaven will be in fact earth was like an extension of heaven eden was a paradise of perfection it was literally heaven on the earth in god's eden there was no death so there were no graves there we were never to experience a heartache or separation yet there was this potential that life could be turned into death and the earth turned to satan's rule where death would reign but this responsible and loving father of ours warned his son adam that there was a tree that they were not to partake of for by taking of the fruit of knowledge they would come to know death and dying and by acting upon this knowledge it would cause very heart-wrenching pain and the partaking of this knowledge would be the reason that we would need hospitals and doctors and medicines to try to alleviate some of the suffering that mankind experiences this fruit of knowledge would cause the sorrow that we feel today it would cause every grave that would come on the earth and the tears of sorrow where we would lay down our loved ones but god was diligent to warn man of this tree of death because god didn't want us to experience this heartache because by taking this tree of this tree and the fruit of this knowledge man would come by this knowledge to know every kind of sin pain suffering mortality and death but god did not want man to die it was not his will he did not want man to experience pain and suffering but yet he didn't force his will upon man but rather left it to his choice and for a time man would enjoy heaven on earth in god's eden where everything was good but then they chose knowledge and they partook of the tree of death rather than the tree of life and now every human would be born in bodies that would be mortal and because they were mortal they would get sick and die or become injured and leave the earth our first parents then experienced the pain of separation by death when jealousy turned to hate and produced the first murder were one brother killed another and their son abel died and these were the first tears at a gravesite the first funeral the first separation this was the first of a long line of dying and death so in the garden of eden there were two trees one of them was a tree of life the other the tree of death or the tree of knowledge and then when man left the tree of life to eat from the tree of knowledge the first bite he took he separated himself from his maker and every time he bites on that tree of science and knowledge he kills himself and he just drives himself further away why don't he just simply come back to the tree the tree of life that's our only solution come back to the way that god made it at the first time but yet man is to his knowledge insist on trying to bring health and happiness and peace to man mankind that comes from a tree that has evil in it and with knowledge comes both good and evil so we try to help man with every medicine and it comes with its side effects we make travel with cars and trucks make life easier there but it comes with this poisonous gases that pollutes the air that we breathe in horrible accidents that leave so many broken hearts men broke bit off of the tree of knowledge and he bit off gunpowder and he kills his fellow man he bites off the tree of knowledge and he's made the nuclear bomb by which he threatens to end all life upon the earth but however there was another tree in the garden and it was not a tree of death but it was a tree of life and jesus came to us as the very fruit from the tree of life so he is he was life and the giver of life he said i am the bread of life that came from god out of heaven for he said he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life this is a bread which cometh down from heaven that if a man may eat thereof and will not die i am that living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat this bread he shall live forever and the bread which i will give is my flesh for i give for the life which i will give for the life of the world so as a man jesus would come to be one of us to fight human battles just like we fight he would face every trial and ever hurt that is known to man he came to bear the penalty of sin he did this in order to make a path back to life again and as the promised seed he like a corn of wheat was bruised and ground and made in the bread so that we could eat or partake of the fruit of the tree of life and live and jesus came to make the way for man to live eternally and he came back to make a life to make a life of heaven but when man brought sin to the earth and defiled his purity god didn't just give up on his creation he went immediately to work to bring reconciliation to man and all this time since the fall of man from life god has been working to bring heaven back down to man in the very same instance of the fall god revealed his plan that he would come of us as a seed the seed of the woman who would bruise the head of the serpent and would deliver man from the fear of death now it would be this clear path back to life and from death that jesus made available for all of us this is why jesus came to bring us back to the path of life for when man could not bring heaven upon the earth god came down the earth and brought heaven down and while upon the earth jesus showed his plan of reconciliation and everything that he did when he attended funerals he raised the dead he opened the eyes of the blind to show he restores sight he healed the leper to show he is lord over the most dreaded diseases and as a man he would face every trial ever hurt known you see he came to make everything good again so he is not the bringer of death he is the giver of life and jesus came to bear the penalty of sin and he did this to make this pathway back to heaven where he could say i am the way the truth and the life and no one can come back and be reconciled with god except by me so he came back to make a way for man to live eternally came to make the way back to life a life of heaven and so it's this clear path to life from death that jesus made and is available to us all to everyone who will accept his grace and his pardon and even in this difficult hour he offers that grace and love and mercy and i know this is a difficult time and a dark hour for many i can think of job when as the bible gives him as an example of a man who the extreme happened to him probably no one has ever suffered as he did in the calamities of life where he would experience loss of wealth loss of children loss of health loss of respect many horrible and tragic events happened to job and it was much of it was all on the same day it tested the limits of his human strength but i want you to remember what job did job arose and he rent his mantle he shaved his head and he fell down on the ground and he worshipped and then the bible said he worshipped he blessed the name of the lord he looked right at the calamity and instead of blaming god instead of questioning the lord he worshipped and in all of this job sent not nor charged god foolishly you see he didn't choose charge god with wrongdoing or and speak against god or he didn't entertain dishonorable thoughts of god as as if god had done something unworthy of his infinite wisdom or justice or goodness he worshipped this is what we do as believers in moments like these in our hardest trials in our greatest test it calls for us to worship god to fall on our knees and say lord your god over all and you're my god and you understand things that i could never comprehend that one day as a song was beautifully saying we'll talk it over and you'll wipe out all tears away from our eyes and we'll have perfect understanding as you understand these dark moments there's been many of them i think of a thief on the cross he was guilty he was dying but it wasn't too late for in that moment he turned and looked upon jesus in his very last moments of life and said remember me and he heard these words back to him this day you that will be with me in paradise you know we don't know a person's last moments it is never our job to decide someone's destiny because jesus said in john 5 22 that the father judgeth no man but he's committed all judgment unto the son so if the father committed all judgment to the son then what do we have to do today but to give our loved one over to jesus and i want to ask you who is more compassionate than jesus when he could turn to a thief and rather than giving him a scolding for his behavior in life and his misdeeds that he'd done and the horrible deeds that he has committed rather than condemning him as others had done he pardoned him this is why we can trust in the lord with all our heart and instead of leaning on our own understanding because in truth we don't understand and we don't know the heart of man and we don't know a man's or woman's last moments so instead of trying to understand then let's trust we trust in the lord with all our heart we then allow him to direct us to a path of healing to righteousness and to living our lives for others as that's what real christianity is when we hear of some of the heartaches in the bible in the dark hours there we remember the friend of jesus lazarus had died and his sisters martha and mary came to him and and of course you know their their grief was great and when martha had heard that jesus had come he said she said these words to to to mary the master has come and he calleth for thee and you may feel that today is a very dark hour but let me tell you the master has come and he calls he calls for you that he to give you comfort to give you strength and you must allow him to give you that comfort as blind bartimaeus whose cry stopped the master you must call out to him for the bible said he that calls on the name of the lord shall be saved this moment is a moment when our hearts are tendered when we can look upon the frailty of our humanity and he offers mercy and grace and you must take it he comes to heal the wounded and the brokenhearted and let me just say don't allow the hurts and the wounds that you have received in life become the chains upon your spirit and imprison you don't allow your grief to turn you into a bitter person but rather let the healer heal your wounded in your broken spirit and bring his joy into your life the master comes and calls for you what to restore you to give you strength for this hour for he is the one who has the power to bring life out of death god wastes no opportunity he is the healer he can take a life that is ridden with the disease of sin and rid that life of sin he can take a life that is dead and sins trespasses and free them from the bondage and the chains because he is the chain breaker he is able to break the chains of alcohol and drugs and immorality and free you from the bondage that will hold you down and yeah he can even cause dry bones to live again the prophet isaiah would see the redeemer coming and he would say of him the spirit of the lord is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the me he has sent me to break bind up the brokenhearted and proclaim liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison to them that are bound and to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god and to comfort all that mourn to appoint to them that mourn in zion to give them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the pre the garment of praise for the spirit of heavens that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified this bible tells us that today is the day of mercy it's the year of god's favor and today we are anointed to declare good tidings that there is one present to heal the brokenhearted to set at liberty those that are bound to comfort all that mourn to give beauty for ashes to give the joy doyle of joy for those that mourn and to lighten the load by removing the spirit of heaviness and exchanging it for garment of praise you may ask well how can i have joy and praise in a moment like this well i can praise him because he's a god that's a god of love i can praise him that he's a god of mercy i can praise him that he's a god of truth and a god of deliverance and he's a god that can change and turn life or death into life and sadness into joy and sickness into health yeah without a doubt there's a coming the day of judgment but that's not today we're not here today to judge the life of another we're here to consider our own way to consider our path where are we in this life's journey and where do we go from here nathan precedes us as he leaves life's journey i felt like at 43 years old he checked out a little too soon but he leads the way and he says that all of us must leave this life nathan's sudden death forces us to realize our own humanity he left us way too quickly he but he'll never leave our hearts and the hearts of his mother or his sisters you'll never leave our memories there'll always be a love and a special place in our heart for the young man that we knew but looking up on this crowd today the many who are gathered here and i want to thank you for coming and supporting the family at this time and all of you that are here and showing your love at this moment but we're here because we're shocked we're shocked at how sudden our life can come to an end here in this world and it forces us to have to face the fact that we're mortal but while we're considering our mortality we should also consider that through jesus we can experience immortality eternal life as far as this life because of the fall of mankind into sin we each one of us have a terminal disease and that disease is called mortality the current death rate is 100 unless jesus comes soon we're all going to die we don't like to think about it but nathan forces us today to think about our own mortality you know this means that worldwide three people die every second 180 die every minute nearly 11 000 every hour and since the bible is right about what happens to us after death it means that more than 250 000 people every day either go to heaven or they're reserved to the judgment and life is short it is short whether we are 43 as nathan was or whether we're 99 life is but a vapor james would say you don't know the least thing about what may happen tomorrow and what is the nature of your life you are really but a wisp of vapor a puff of smoke a mist that is visible for a little while and then disappears as it went into thin air the book of psalms says you have made my days a mere hand breath the span of my years there's nothing before you each man's life is but a breath again in the book of psalms it says remember how short my life is how empty and futile this human existence no one can live forever all will die no one can escape the power of the grave and the frailty of our life reminds us that life passes by all too quickly and since you can't go back and delete what you don't like about your life or rewind your life so you can live it differently the best you can do from this moment on is to make every day count so you start today knowing that each moment slips quickly into the past and that should inspire us to make the most of out of every second limiting regrets and should haves and could haves and woodhouse gives me courage to get the best of every day so begin today begin today to love goodness goodness gracious we got enough hate in the world but you can't love without forgiveness so start forgiving you cannot take drudges and bitterness and other expressions of hate to heaven but your anger and bitterness and grudges and hate can separate you from god forever the life and the power of this gospel makes it possible to love your enemies and to do good to them that despitefully uses you as william branham said hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end love has no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love never did begin and it will never end see it's eternal so today we are reminded that life here is too short to hold on to things that separate us there will not be walls that will separate us in heaven so tell me why should we build up walls that separate us here on the earth heaven extends its borders to include others for the gates of heaven are open day and night but hell is walled and enclosed you know we need to stop and to realize that this all-too-brief life of nathan really screams screams out today that says tear down the walls that divide us for though heaven has walls and the gates are always open even so let us spread a little heaven down here on the earth and may god open our hearts with love and kindness and compassion as paul would say be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another for as even as christ god for christ's sake hath forgiven you these are the trademarks of a christian life compassion sympathetic pity and concern for the misfortunes of others as we come down to the end today we're to show mercy to reach out a helping hand make every moment count because we're here because life is but a short moment but there is an eternity and life does not have to come to an end because there is an eternal life offered us all and finally today we want to submit to god's will the book of john first john said the world and his desires passes away but the man who does the will of god lives forever so today let's put nathan into the hands of jesus today let us put our lives into the hands of jesus and as we have sung the songs today of the power that will break every chain let him break the chains of our grief and our sorrows and release to us the joy of the lord for truly the joy of the lord is our strength and also i want to say to you today if you have chains of sin of addictions or chains of hate or anger or unforgiveness in this moment turn to god who's the chain breaker trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding and then in all your ways acknowledge him so he will direct your path we're going to have prayer at this moment and as we just bow our heads just a moment let us not waste an opportunity here would there be one here in this place that would just like to lift a hand to god and say lord let me acknowledge you today where i quit leaning on my own understanding so that in all my ways you can direct my path i need your leadership today will you give me that guidance god bless you as you raise a hand toward him father we bless your name today we want to thank you lord for the blessings of life upon us for the grace that has been given us yes lord and we thank you for nathan we hear of the tributes that were paid to him today the memories of his childhood the memories of his service to our country the men who have come to support the family and to honor him at this moment this time the church evening like tabernacle has gathered as a body and the friends and the host of friends that have come and they're here today lord you extend a hand of mercy and grace and love and compassion and lord we just pray that you'll envelop sister rachel in the family in your great arms of compassion and love today and lord that you'll be the comfort that they need in this hour we need the strength giver and we believe that you are el shaddai the strength giver so may they draw from the promises of the word today to receive that strength bring healing to our wounded souls lord in the broken hearts and father may we reflect on you throughout this day and may this life not be a wasted life because it causes us to stop and remember our own need our own eat of god our own need of a savior for we ask it in jesus name amen timothy we are often tossed and driven on the restless sea of time somber skies and howling tempest off succeed the bright sunshine in that land a perfect day when the mists have rolled away we will understand it better bye [Music] comes with
