[16:04] they had to change some medications and
[16:05] he's not able to hold anything down on

[17:30] put bones
[17:31] in the place they should be or to put
[17:33] skin in the place it should be
[17:34] it's god that does the healing to bind
[17:36] it together and we're certainly thankful
[17:38] for the many
[17:39] praise reports that we've heard this
[17:41] evening amen if you have a knee just

[17:57] how many you brought your shoebox
[17:58] tonight remember when he came with his
[18:01] shoebox
[18:02] he came with an expectation but he left
[18:04] with a miracle
[18:06] so i trust you come with an expectation
[18:08] tonight you'll leave with a miracle
[18:10] because we serve a miracle working god
[18:11] so let's just bow before him in prayer
[18:14] father how we thank you tonight that we
[18:15] can approach your throne of mercy lord

[18:20] to be your children lord when we
[18:22] we see ourselves right now father today
[18:25] stepping into the vision clearly god
[18:29] our eyes have been open and we can see
[18:30] what you promised for this hour
[18:33] but not only what you promised for this
[18:35] hour but father you
[18:36] predestinated the people to be here to
[18:39] withstand the onslaught of the enemy
[18:42] in the darkest of hours amidst all the
[18:45] chaos
[18:45] you said you'd raise up a bride father
[18:48] she will not fall
[18:49] like that first bride fell so we're here
[18:51] lord tonight is our post of duty
[18:54] representing that oh that multi-member
[18:56] body called the bride of christ
[18:58] and we're so thankful lord that you have
[19:00] called us you have placed us
[19:02] you have chosen us and you have anointed

[19:08] shine forth the
[19:10] gospel light may we not miss our moment
[19:12] to be complacent and laodicea but god
[19:14] may we rise
[19:15] from our complacencies father and may we
[19:18] come on the scene lord as a miraculous
[19:20] body that you've called us to be

[19:24] were mentioned
[19:25] god we know that our prayers don't fall
[19:27] on deaf ears
[19:29] oh many times sometimes the devil would
[19:30] make us think that they don't
[19:32] our prayers are not heard they don't go
[19:34] past the ceiling but father there's not
[19:36] a prayer that's ever uttered or
[19:37] mentioned
[19:38] but what you know about it and not only
[19:40] that you know about it but you already
[19:42] are interceding on behalf

[19:46] will and position
[19:48] to provide the miracle that we're in
[19:49] need of lord it may be a physical

[43:53] said for the weapons of our warfare are
[43:55] not carnal
[43:57] but mighty through god to the pulling
[43:59] down of strongholds
[44:01] casting down imaginations and every
[44:05] high thing that exalted itself against
[44:07] the knowledge of god
[44:09] and bringing into captivity every
[44:12] thought
[44:13] to the obedience of christ amen you can
[44:16] be seated
[44:20] i just speak to you get on casting down
[44:22] imaginations
[44:24] but to hone in or to talk about
[44:27] the stronghold of complacency
[44:30] you know complacency and is really a
[44:34] sister if you want to say or a brother
[44:36] to lukewarmness
[44:38] you know we was reading last wednesday
[44:40] in revelations 3
[44:42] and verse 15 he said i know thy works
[44:45] that thou art neither cold nor hot
[44:47] i would that thou art cold or hot so
[44:49] then because thou art lukewarm
[44:52] and neither cold nor hot i will spew
[44:55] thee
[44:55] out of my mouth and we notice he said
[44:58] they are neither cold nor hot they were
[45:00] lukewarm
[45:01] and lukewarm meaning to have a lack of
[45:04] enthusiasm
[45:06] or a lack of passion or a lack of
[45:09] fervency
[45:10] in other words it means to be without
[45:13] earnest interest or interested in
[45:16] something very
[45:17] passionately it is it's more or less a
[45:20] take it or
[45:20] leave it attitude and we see in this
[45:23] time that people
[45:25] in this age have become very very
[45:26] careless and very relaxed
[45:28] and very indifferent towards the things
[45:30] of god
[45:32] you know a great man of god through the
[45:34] ages there
[45:36] mr brother spurgeon made this statement
[45:38] i thought it was quite interesting
[45:40] as i was looking at this today said it's
[45:43] harder
[45:43] a great deal to work for jesus with a
[45:46] church which is lukewarm
[45:48] than it would be to begin without a
[45:50] church
[45:52] he says give me a dozen earnest spirits
[45:55] and put me down anywhere in london and
[45:57] by god's help
[45:58] we will soon cause the wilderness and
[46:00] the solitary places to rejoice
[46:03] he said but give me the whole lot of a
[46:06] lot
[46:06] half-hearted half undecide undecided
[46:09] unconcerned
[46:10] what can i do he said only drag upon a
[46:13] man's zeal
[46:14] in a man's earnestness he said 5 000
[46:17] members of a church all lukewarm
[46:19] will be 5 000 impediments but a dozen
[46:23] earnest passionate spirits determined
[46:25] that christ
[46:26] shall be glorified souls shall be won
[46:30] we must be more than conquerors and
[46:32] every weakness and fewness will res
[46:34] in their very weakness and fewness will
[46:36] reside capacities
[46:38] for being more largely blessed of god he
[46:41] said it's better
[46:42] nothing than lukewarmness
[46:45] you know and i believe that's the way
[46:47] our our heart ought to be i'd rather be
[46:49] nothing than be
[46:50] lukewarm amen but instead of you know
[46:53] being lukewarm i believe that we can be
[46:55] fervent about the things of god and
[46:57] passion and about the things of god you
[46:59] know and he would read on
[47:00] you read on in revelations 3 as we begin
[47:03] to dissect this church
[47:05] this laodicean church he said because i
[47:07] sayest
[47:08] i'm rich and increased with goods and
[47:10] have needham nothing
[47:11] and knoweth not that thou art wretched
[47:13] miserable poor
[47:15] blind and naked and he said i counseled
[47:18] thee to buy
[47:18] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[47:20] mayest be rich
[47:22] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[47:24] clothed that the shame of thy nakedness
[47:26] do not appear
[47:27] and anoint thine eyes with i salve that
[47:29] thou mayest see
[47:31] you know brother branham would say he
[47:32] said you know the the scripture says i
[47:34] have need of nothing he says
[47:36] when anybody says i have need of nothing
[47:39] they very well be
[47:40] might as well be saying i have
[47:42] everything or be saying i don't want any
[47:44] more i'm
[47:45] full he said see you can express this
[47:48] any way you want to
[47:49] but it all adds up to the fact that the
[47:52] church is complacent
[47:54] she's satisfied with what she has she
[47:57] either figures she has it all
[47:59] or has enough and he said that's exactly
[48:02] what we find today
[48:04] complacency is a self-satisfied state
[48:07] of negligence or carelessness especially
[48:11] in relation to one personal situation
[48:14] you know the bible and proverbs would
[48:15] say for the simple or killed
[48:17] by their turning away and the
[48:19] complacency of fools
[48:21] destroy them notice it talks about it
[48:24] equates
[48:25] the complacency with fools or simples or
[48:28] someone that's naive and throughout the
[48:30] whole book of proverbs it would refer to
[48:33] these these terms of simple and fools or
[48:35] naive people
[48:37] to describe people who don't give
[48:39] thoughts to their lives or who
[48:41] are people who aren't intentional about
[48:44] honoring god
[48:45] and walking in his ways i believe when
[48:48] we're going to walk in his ways we ought
[48:50] to be intentional about it
[48:52] amen when we come to those church we
[48:53] ought to be intentional about it amen
[48:56] amen we worship him it ought to be
[48:57] something that we are
[48:59] have a fervency a desire to give all
[49:01] that we have to him
[49:03] amen a naive one or a fool lives only
[49:07] to please themselves you know they do
[49:10] what feels good regardless of whether it
[49:12] is good
[49:14] amen regardless of even if it's god's
[49:16] will or not
[49:17] the bible says their complacency will
[49:19] destroy them
[49:20] and we consider the definition again
[49:23] self-satisfaction
[49:24] especially when accompanied with by
[49:26] awareness
[49:27] of actual dangers or deficiencies
[49:31] and in other words to be complacent is
[49:33] to feel
[49:34] comfortable when you should be concerned
[49:38] did you get that complacent is to become
[49:40] feel comfortable
[49:42] when you should be concerned amen it's
[49:44] willfully ignoring
[49:46] the fact that you're not where you
[49:48] should be or neglecting what you ought
[49:50] to be doing
[49:51] amen it's the thing james talked about
[49:53] when he says remember
[49:54] it is a sin to know what you ought to do
[49:57] and then not do
[49:58] it amen you know there's a fine line you
[50:01] know
[50:02] people say well i'm not complacent i'm
[50:04] content there's a fine line between
[50:06] contentment and complacency
[50:08] you know actually you could take the
[50:10] thought you know as a man described it
[50:12] in this way he says
[50:13] you know there's a certain snake is a
[50:15] coral snake and you
[50:16] it's also another snake that's not that
[50:18] coral snake's very deadly and very
[50:20] poisonous
[50:21] and and can kill you in just a few
[50:23] moments but there's another state that
[50:25] looks just like it
[50:26] but it has a maybe a few different
[50:28] characteristics about it
[50:30] but it's very it's a call it's a
[50:31] harmless king snake
[50:33] and it does a lot of good and it keeps
[50:35] you know passed away
[50:37] and but knowing the difference between
[50:40] them could be the matter of life and
[50:42] death
[50:43] and knowing the difference between a
[50:45] contentment and complacency
[50:47] amen is the matter between life and
[50:50] death
[50:51] because contentment has more to do with
[50:53] trusting god
[50:54] you know when you've reached your limits
[50:56] or when you're not the most
[50:57] in a comfortable place but you're still
[51:00] trusting god
[51:01] and you know it doesn't doesn't mean
[51:04] that you don't have joy or
[51:05] satisfaction in your life or or you have
[51:08] to be uncomfortable all the time
[51:09] but when you're content your
[51:11] satisfaction
[51:12] is focused on god amen when you're in
[51:16] contentment
[51:17] amen your gratitude you're you're in
[51:19] gratitude for what he's done for you and
[51:21] everything
[51:22] around you amen is is circling around
[51:26] him and what he's done for you
[51:28] amen your accompli your knowledge your
[51:30] limitations
[51:31] and but you'll be intentional about
[51:34] following the lord's lead
[51:36] where he leads me i will follow on the
[51:39] other hand being complacent
[51:40] is about being satisfied with yourself
[51:43] with your own pleasures
[51:45] when you know god has more important
[51:47] things
[51:48] and he wants to lead you into it's a
[51:51] state of stubborn
[51:52] man one man said it like this he said
[51:54] it's a state of stubborn stillness
[51:57] when god is actually wanting you to get
[51:59] up and move
[52:01] that's what complacency is and before
[52:03] long though complacency
[52:05] will lead to apathy and then to unbelief
[52:09] it may feel good now but the end the
[52:11] road is not pleasant
[52:14] you know contentment is being satisfied
[52:16] where
[52:17] god has placed you complacency is
[52:20] settling for the place
[52:21] god is telling you to leave amen god is
[52:25] telling you to get out of that
[52:27] doldrum get out of that situation get
[52:29] out of that thing and what we're
[52:31] we call it contentment just be content
[52:33] that's not being content
[52:34] god is telling you there's another step
[52:36] to take there's more land to possess
[52:39] there's no more promises to be fulfilled
[52:42] amen this
[52:42] year as we said you know we're looking
[52:44] at the fulfillment of prophecy
[52:46] it ought to drive back every every bit
[52:48] of lukewarmness out of our lives as
[52:51] as we see the time is ticking down and
[52:53] prophecies are being fulfilled
[52:55] so very fast there will not be
[52:57] complacency in our lives
[52:59] but there is complacency in people's
[53:01] lives
[53:06] you know it's amazing when you realize
[53:09] the complacency that led to apathy and
[53:12] belief
[53:13] you start seeing people who led and left
[53:15] them that left this message and left
[53:17] this truth
[53:18] it started with complacency
[53:22] you know it started with just allowing
[53:25] things to be
[53:26] and and not dealing with situations in
[53:28] their lives and
[53:29] and allowing bitterness to take place or
[53:32] allowing something to have preeminence
[53:34] in their lives
[53:35] instead of man being being active or
[53:38] fervent in the things of god
[53:40] amen a coldness started setting in and
[53:42] before you know it
[53:43] apathy took over until where unbelief
[53:45] has now taken them
[53:47] you know uh you know maybe some of you
[53:50] have seen it has been sent to me several
[53:52] times today about the
[53:53] inauguration of the new president and
[53:56] the vice president and i thought it was
[53:57] quite
[53:58] astounding when the vice president got
[54:00] out in the
[54:01] and what the media is saying royal
[54:03] purple
[54:04] dressed in royal purple and if you go
[54:06] back and look at what brother branham
[54:07] talked about it
[54:08] he described that he called out that
[54:10] very color
[54:11] you know and but even already people
[54:14] that has left the messages
[54:15] ah that's not purple that's blue
[54:19] you know complacency is taken over just
[54:22] complete unbelief they can see things
[54:24] right before them
[54:25] and willfully blind it started off with
[54:28] complacency
[54:30] it started out with settling for a place
[54:32] instead of
[54:33] leaving there and moving forward with
[54:35] god and saying god i need more of
[54:38] you amen sure they might have had an
[54:40] experience
[54:41] at a place sometime where god may have
[54:42] done something for them
[54:44] but they stayed there instead of moving
[54:46] on with god
[54:47] that's why we have to be very careful in
[54:49] our experience it needs to be a fresh
[54:51] and up-to-date experience come on
[54:55] somebody
[54:55] amen we need to be every day looking for
[54:58] more of god
[54:58] i want more in my life i want him in my
[55:01] everyday life i want him in my car
[55:03] i want him in my word i want him on my
[55:05] study i want him everywhere
[55:11] amen it ought not be just the happiness
[55:13] of uh even just
[55:14] you know have our christian duty to come
[55:16] to church while i fulfilled it no it's
[55:18] every day i'm a christian
[55:20] it's every moment i'm a christian it's
[55:22] every moment i'm living for him
[55:24] i'm looking for his appearing.
[55:28] hallelujah listen these signs that we're
[55:30] seeing
[55:31] should not bring sadness to your heart
[55:33] it ought to bring a rejoicing
[55:35] because these are the days we've been
[55:37] longing for many
[55:38] many prophets and and priests and kings
[55:41] there many wise people
[55:42] long for this day that we're living in
[55:45] and we're seeing prophecy being
[55:47] fulfilled
[55:48] it ought to put a joy in our heart any
[55:50] moment the dead in christ is going to
[55:52] rise
[55:53] any moment our god is going to return
[55:56] [Applause]
[56:00] but we see complacency at the very
[56:02] beginning there in the church ages
[56:05] we can see it there and we can read
[56:08] about the
[56:09] ephesus church there in the book of
[56:12] revelation it says these things saith he
[56:15] that holdeth the seven stars in his
[56:17] right hand
[56:18] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[56:20] golden candlesticks
[56:22] my that gives me peace right there
[56:25] because those seven golden
[56:26] candlesticks represents seven ages and
[56:29] he's walking in every age
[56:32] so even in this time we're living in
[56:33] he's still here among us
[56:35] amen and then he said i know thou works
[56:37] in thy labor and our patience
[56:39] how the death cannot bear them which are
[56:41] evil that has tried them will say their
[56:43] apostles and are not as found them liars
[56:46] and as born and has patience and for my
[56:48] name's sake have labored
[56:50] and hath not faith and nevertheless i am
[56:52] somewhat against thee because i have
[56:54] left
[56:55] thy first love remember therefore from
[56:58] whence thou art fallen and repent
[57:00] and do the first works or else i will
[57:02] come to thee quickly
[57:03] and remove that candlesticks out of this
[57:05] place except i repent
[57:07] but this is thou this thou hast that
[57:10] thou
[57:10] hatest the deeds of the nickelodeons
[57:12] which are also hate
[57:14] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[57:16] the spirit saith unto the churches
[57:18] amen the very name ephesus has a meaning
[57:22] aimed at but relaxed
[57:27] it's a high aspirations of this age that
[57:29] had
[57:30] begun with the fullness of the spirit on
[57:32] the day of pentecost
[57:33] even the god came and broke out upon men
[57:37] and men did in amazing amen feats of the
[57:40] supernatural were taking place
[57:43] and it was started out like that but it
[57:45] didn't end like that
[57:47] amen to where there was such a depth of
[57:50] god
[57:50] they were aiming at the high calling of
[57:52] god but it begin to give way
[57:55] to a less watchful attitude unless art
[57:58] and following of jesus christ
[58:00] begin to manifest manifest itself as an
[58:04] omen that with the in the future ages
[58:06] the physical
[58:07] vehicle called the church would all sink
[58:10] way
[58:10] down into the awfulness of the depths of
[58:13] satan
[58:14] it had become relaxed and it was
[58:16] drifting
[58:19] that's why we need to make sure we're
[58:21] not being just drifters
[58:24] drift into one service and drift out and
[58:26] drift out three with rift that back in
[58:28] three you're just drifting
[58:30] amen the the love of god you know you
[58:33] know what it's like to have that
[58:34] fervency
[58:37] amen that desire that passion to know
[58:39] his word
[58:40] and and and that we don't want to be
[58:42] like leo to see it says i have need of
[58:44] nothing
[58:46] listen we don't want to be a people that
[58:48] can't ought take a a few moments of the
[58:50] word or even a few hours of the word
[58:54] and get tired of it come on now
[58:58] we want to be somebody that can soak in
[59:00] the word of god
[59:01] and eat upon the word of life because
[59:03] there's life to us
[59:05] it's more than just a do-good religion
[59:08] it's more than just
[59:10] doing my christian duty it's life to us
[59:16] but this tiny seed
[59:19] left his first love
[59:23] and this tiny seed planted in that
[59:25] ephesian age would one day grow
[59:28] into the spirit of air unto all foul
[59:31] birds of the air would roost in his
[59:32] branches
[59:34] so inoffensive to human reason was that
[59:37] little plant
[59:38] appear in that new eve the new church
[59:40] that again she would be deceived by
[59:42] satan and the ephesian age had presented
[59:45] her the opportunity
[59:47] to be god's best
[59:50] come on now we want to be god's best
[59:55] listen there are phenomenal people
[59:56] trying to be the devil's best
[59:58] they're impersonating spirits and
[1:00:00] spirits are coming out all over them but
[1:00:02] there's a people that are
[1:00:03] god's best hallelujah
[1:00:07] amen but while she prevailed for a
[1:00:09] moment but then she relaxed
[1:00:11] in an unguarded moment satan planted the
[1:00:14] seed
[1:00:15] of complete ruination he said i have
[1:00:18] somewhat against thee because
[1:00:20] thou hast left thy first love
[1:00:24] to understand this you must must realize
[1:00:27] that the spirit
[1:00:28] is not speaking to the original saints
[1:00:30] of ephesus alone
[1:00:33] this message is to the entire age it
[1:00:36] went 120 years
[1:00:37] it's a message is to all the gentile
[1:00:40] generations in that span but
[1:00:42] history is now it keeps repeating itself
[1:00:47] in the generations of israel we'll see a
[1:00:49] revival in one
[1:00:51] only to see the fires fade in the next
[1:00:54] listen it was complacency that led that
[1:00:57] brought it that when israel got into
[1:00:59] egypt they began to realize how good it
[1:01:01] was in egypt
[1:01:02] and that boy they know it that
[1:01:03] complacency was as a frog
[1:01:05] in a little pot of water and the heat
[1:01:08] began to turn up and up and up
[1:01:09] until all of a sudden there was a
[1:01:11] pharaoh that didn't know joseph
[1:01:13] and the next thing you know there wasn't
[1:01:15] honored citizens of egypt
[1:01:17] they become slaves it was complacency
[1:01:21] that brought them there
[1:01:23] to that place in that moment of slavery
[1:01:30] and he says you see until where
[1:01:33] it goes up and it goes down it goes up
[1:01:35] and it goes down
[1:01:37] until now there's no vest vested
[1:01:39] whatsoever that original flame
[1:01:41] but then god will light the fire again
[1:01:44] and the same process is repeating
[1:01:46] he said it's simply the manifestation of
[1:01:48] the truth that god has no grandchildren
[1:01:51] salvation is not passed on by natural
[1:01:54] birth any more than there's any truth to
[1:01:56] apostolic succession
[1:01:57] it isn't the word you start out with
[1:02:00] truly born again believers
[1:02:02] but then the next generation comes along
[1:02:04] and they're no longer just christians
[1:02:06] they've taken on a denominational name
[1:02:10] that's why our young people have to have
[1:02:11] their own experience
[1:02:14] that's why the old people's got to have
[1:02:15] enough christianity about them
[1:02:17] and enough fervency about them to create
[1:02:19] the atmosphere so they can
[1:02:21] have that experience it ain't all just
[1:02:24] on one group of people
[1:02:26] it's on all of us working together
[1:02:29] amen i've told people you wonder why
[1:02:31] your kids don't worship god
[1:02:33] and they don't put god in their life you
[1:02:34] ought to start looking at your own life
[1:02:36] [Applause]
[1:02:38] and all excuses that you made and you're
[1:02:40] done listen no excuse works in this age
[1:02:44] we're coming to the end of excuses
[1:02:50] you start out with truly born again but
[1:02:52] the next generation comes along and
[1:02:54] is plain christians you know they're no
[1:02:56] longer just christians they have to take
[1:02:57] on some name baptist methodist
[1:03:00] that's exactly what they are they're not
[1:03:02] christians you have to be born of the
[1:03:04] will of god not the will of man to be
[1:03:05] saved
[1:03:07] but these are now coming together by the
[1:03:08] will of man
[1:03:11] but he says but he says but see what
[1:03:13] happens is he says the fervent
[1:03:15] desire to please god the passion to know
[1:03:19] his word
[1:03:21] the cry for reaching out on the spirit
[1:03:25] all begins to fade and instead of that
[1:03:28] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:03:30] god
[1:03:31] it has cooled off and become formal
[1:03:35] maybe we need to change that a little
[1:03:36] bit the fervent desire to please god
[1:03:39] the passion to know his word the cry for
[1:03:41] the reaching and the spirit
[1:03:43] all begins to fade and instead of that
[1:03:46] person
[1:03:46] amen being on fire for god
[1:03:50] it'll be he begins to cool off and
[1:03:52] becomes a bit formal in his worship and
[1:03:55] formal in his attitude towards god and
[1:03:57] formal in the things of god and
[1:04:01] come on now the abandonment to god has
[1:04:04] died out
[1:04:06] and people were beginning to be more
[1:04:08] careful about the what the world thought
[1:04:10] about them
[1:04:11] instead of what god thought about them
[1:04:15] listen it's the truth i mean you see it
[1:04:16] even in message ranks
[1:04:18] when women start putting on paint on
[1:04:20] their faces that ain't to me god that's
[1:04:22] to meet men
[1:04:25] come on listen when jezebel put the
[1:04:27] paint on her face
[1:04:28] it wasn't to meet god it was to meet a
[1:04:30] man
[1:04:33] and people begin to work you can tell
[1:04:35] people are worried about what the world
[1:04:37] thinks about them we gotta have the new
[1:04:38] clothes we gotta have this
[1:04:40] we gotta have our style we gotta have it
[1:04:42] all instead of what god
[1:04:44] thinks about you what's on the inside of
[1:04:47] your heart
[1:04:48] that's what counts not about our dress
[1:04:51] and
[1:04:52] how much money we got in our closet and
[1:04:54] none of that matters
[1:05:02] second generation coming on
[1:05:06] just like israel they demanded the king
[1:05:08] to be the net be like
[1:05:09] a king to be like other nations when
[1:05:11] they did they rejected god
[1:05:13] that is the history of the church when
[1:05:16] it thinks more of conforming to the
[1:05:17] world instead of conforming to god
[1:05:20] it isn't long until you see them stop
[1:05:22] doing things they used to do
[1:05:23] and start doing things they wouldn't do
[1:05:25] initially
[1:05:27] they change their manner of dress their
[1:05:30] attitudes
[1:05:31] their behavior they get lacks that's
[1:05:34] what ephesus means
[1:05:35] relax drifting listen you can go right
[1:05:39] back to the pentecostal ranks
[1:05:41] amen you can you can see when the when
[1:05:43] the holy ghost began to fall and the
[1:05:45] gifts were restored
[1:05:46] what did it do it restored holiness it
[1:05:49] restored dress it restored
[1:05:51] amen a woman back to her position it did
[1:05:53] all of those things
[1:05:55] but go find one now
[1:05:58] they look back at that and says a bunch
[1:06:00] of old folkiness what caused that
[1:06:02] the presence of god falling down
[1:06:05] hallelujah amen if the presence of god
[1:06:08] causes
[1:06:09] a man a woman to dress right look right
[1:06:12] amen a man to do right
[1:06:13] what does what what causes the other
[1:06:16] thing
[1:06:19] relaxed drifting
[1:06:23] the cycle of revival and death has never
[1:06:26] failed it's come right into the ranks of
[1:06:29] the message
[1:06:32] amen all you have to do is recall there
[1:06:34] he goes the last move of god
[1:06:35] in the spirit when men and women dressed
[1:06:38] like christians
[1:06:39] went to church prayed all night took to
[1:06:41] the street corners
[1:06:42] wouldn't ashamed the manifestation of
[1:06:44] the spirit
[1:06:48] mercy sounds like he's calling out us
[1:06:50] message believers
[1:06:53] at this time he's talking about a
[1:06:54] pentecostal race
[1:06:57] they left their old dead churches
[1:06:58] worshiped in home and old store
[1:07:00] buildings they had a reality
[1:07:01] but it wasn't long until they began to
[1:07:03] get enough money to build find new
[1:07:05] churches they put a choir instead of
[1:07:07] singing in the god for themselves
[1:07:08] they put gowns on they organized the
[1:07:10] movement soon began to read books that
[1:07:12] wasn't fit to read
[1:07:14] they let down the bars and the goats
[1:07:15] come in and took over
[1:07:17] the cry of joy was gone the freedom of
[1:07:19] the spirit's gone
[1:07:20] and they kept on with a form but the
[1:07:23] fire
[1:07:24] has died down and the blackness of ashes
[1:07:27] is all that's about
[1:07:28] left
[1:07:32] but he said he that hath an ear let him
[1:07:34] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:07:37] churches
[1:07:39] amen we need to take heed to him and we
[1:07:42] do not know
[1:07:42] but he will lend his ear and want to
[1:07:45] know the words of the truth will feel
[1:07:47] the spirit of god enlighten him
[1:07:49] if your ears open to the word the spirit
[1:07:51] of god will reveal
[1:07:53] something to you amen it's a work of the
[1:07:56] spirit it'll teach you
[1:07:57] but notice in this in this one in this
[1:07:59] ephesian church age he said
[1:08:01] there's something brother branham keys
[1:08:02] in on he said notice
[1:08:04] it says that the spirit is speaking to
[1:08:07] the churches
[1:08:10] not just the ephesus church not just for
[1:08:13] the first age holy
[1:08:14] but this is for all church ages
[1:08:19] don't be drifting
[1:08:30] we can look through scriptures
[1:08:34] we'll go through some here as we go here
[1:08:37] deuteronomy 4
[1:08:38] 9 says take heed to thyself
[1:08:44] in other words don't come to church
[1:08:48] and say well that was for somebody else
[1:08:52] they you know that i whoa i know where
[1:08:54] that hit take heed to yourself
[1:08:57] and keep thy soul diligently
[1:09:03] he didn't they come to church and make
[1:09:04] sure everybody else's soul is right
[1:09:06] he said keep thy soul lest thou
[1:09:10] forget the things which sign eyes have
[1:09:11] seen unless
[1:09:13] they depart from their heart all the
[1:09:15] days of the
[1:09:16] thy life and luke 21 34 says take heed
[1:09:20] to yourself lest any time your hearts be
[1:09:22] overcharged
[1:09:24] with sophiety and drunkenness and cares
[1:09:26] of this life
[1:09:27] and that day come upon you unaware
[1:09:32] for it as a snare shall it come upon all
[1:09:35] them
[1:09:35] that dwell on the face of the whole
[1:09:37] earth
[1:09:39] amen when person sets a snare for a bird
[1:09:42] or for a bear
[1:09:43] whatever animal he's trying to catch
[1:09:45] he's not got signs pointing to it he's
[1:09:47] not
[1:09:47] you know what i mean it's not all out in
[1:09:49] the open it's the skies a lot of ways
[1:09:51] amen but what does a snare do when that
[1:09:53] animal steps into that point
[1:09:55] it slaps shut and before he knows it
[1:09:59] he's caught
[1:10:00] and this is exactly what the rapture is
[1:10:02] fixing to do to a lot of people
[1:10:05] that door that's been opened is about to
[1:10:07] shut
[1:10:09] amen he that is holy will be holy still
[1:10:12] amen he that is ungodly will be ungodly
[1:10:14] still
[1:10:16] amen we see people that are just going
[1:10:18] on like it's just any other day
[1:10:20] this is not just any other day isn't a
[1:10:23] time to have sincerity
[1:10:24] this is the time to have fervency this
[1:10:27] is a time to say god
[1:10:28] whatever is wrong in my life i want to
[1:10:30] make it right
[1:10:32] it's a time to let down let go of old
[1:10:34] family squabbles
[1:10:36] and things that has held you back it's
[1:10:38] the time to put it all in the blood
[1:10:40] and say god i don't want to be caught in
[1:10:42] the trap of laodicea
[1:10:51] ii peter says 1 says 19 says we have
[1:10:54] also a more sure word of prophecy
[1:10:58] wherein you do well that you take heed
[1:11:02] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[1:11:04] place
[1:11:05] until the day dawn and the day star
[1:11:08] arrives in your hearts
[1:11:09] ii peter 1 1 says simon peter a servant
[1:11:12] of the apostle of jesus christ
[1:11:14] to them that obtained like precious
[1:11:17] faith
[1:11:18] with us through the righteousness of god
[1:11:20] and our savior jesus christ grace be
[1:11:22] unto you
[1:11:23] and grace and peace be multiplied unto
[1:11:25] you through the knowledge of god and of
[1:11:26] jesus our lord
[1:11:27] according as his divine power hath given
[1:11:31] us all things that pertain unto life and
[1:11:33] godliness
[1:11:34] through the knowledge of him that has
[1:11:35] called us to glory and virtue
[1:11:38] whereby are given unto us exceedingly
[1:11:41] great and precious promises oh
[1:11:42] hallelujah
[1:11:43] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:11:46] divine nature
[1:11:47] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:11:49] this world through lust
[1:11:50] and besides that beside this giving all
[1:11:54] diligence all diligence
[1:11:58] add to your faith virtue virtue
[1:12:00] knowledge knowledge tempers tempers
[1:12:02] patience patience godliness
[1:12:03] god and his brother kindness brother
[1:12:05] kindness charity for if these things be
[1:12:07] in you impound
[1:12:08] they make that you neither be barren nor
[1:12:10] and fruitful in the knowledge of our
[1:12:11] lord jesus christ
[1:12:13] but he that lacketh these things is
[1:12:15] blind and cannot see afar off
[1:12:17] and has forgotten that he was purged
[1:12:19] from his own sins wherefore the brethren
[1:12:21] brother give
[1:12:22] diligence give diligence
[1:12:26] to make your calling and election sure
[1:12:34] for if you do these things you will not
[1:12:38] fail hallelujah
[1:12:41] if you do these things you will take a
[1:12:44] body change
[1:12:46] if you do these things
[1:12:55] oh but i i got this to do brother
[1:12:57] timothy i i got
[1:12:59] if you do these things
[1:13:08] kind of like brother brown i'm talking
[1:13:09] about you know our body being worth
[1:13:13] so many cents and today that sense has
[1:13:16] went
[1:13:16] probably who knows how far into the
[1:13:18] dollars
[1:13:19] with inflation and everything else
[1:13:22] but he said somebody will worry about
[1:13:24] what they put on and
[1:13:27] you know and he said talks about going
[1:13:29] to a restaurant and said
[1:13:30] how if you dare find a spider in your
[1:13:32] soup you'll throw a fit
[1:13:34] you don't get all out of sorts because
[1:13:36] you've got some maybe what it is hair or
[1:13:38] whatever it is just get out all the
[1:13:39] sorts
[1:13:40] he said but then i'm saying people gone
[1:13:42] down everything the devil has
[1:13:46] amen just take whatever all his lies and
[1:13:49] all the things just
[1:13:50] take it right in as though amen listen
[1:13:54] it's time we give diligence to the
[1:13:57] things of god
[1:14:01] first corinthians 10 1 says moreover
[1:14:03] brethren i would not that you should be
[1:14:05] ignorant
[1:14:06] how that all our fathers were under the
[1:14:08] cloud and all past through the sea
[1:14:10] and we're all baptized unto moses and
[1:14:12] the cloud and the sea and did all eat
[1:14:14] the same spiritual meat
[1:14:16] they'd all drink the same spiritual
[1:14:17] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[1:14:20] rock that
[1:14:20] followed them and that rock was christ
[1:14:24] but with many of them god was not well
[1:14:26] pleased
[1:14:27] for they were overthrown in the
[1:14:28] wilderness now these things were our
[1:14:31] examples to the intent we should not
[1:14:32] lust
[1:14:33] after evil things as they also lusted
[1:14:36] neither be
[1:14:37] idolaters idolaters or some of them as
[1:14:39] is written
[1:14:40] the people sat down to eat drink and
[1:14:43] rose up to play
[1:14:45] amen neither let us commit fornication
[1:14:47] and some of them committed
[1:14:48] and failed one day three and twenty
[1:14:50] thousand
[1:14:52] neither let us tempt christ as some of
[1:14:53] them also tempted and were destroyed as
[1:14:56] serpents neither murmur you
[1:14:57] as some of them also murmured and were
[1:14:59] destroyed of the destroyer
[1:15:01] now all these things happen to them for
[1:15:04] examples
[1:15:05] and they are written for our monastery
[1:15:08] upon whom the end of the world will come
[1:15:11] wherefore
[1:15:12] let him that thinketh he stand take heed
[1:15:16] lest he fall
[1:15:21] it's only as an example
[1:15:30] you know people
[1:15:34] apparently are not convinced therefore
[1:15:37] they're not concerned
[1:15:41] if you was convinced this was the truth
[1:15:44] you would be concerned with having your
[1:15:46] house in order
[1:15:48] if you was convinced in the time that
[1:15:50] we're living in you'd be concerned about
[1:15:52] where you are as a father and a mother
[1:15:54] and daughters and sons
[1:15:56] if he was convinced amen
[1:16:00] matthew 24 37 says but as the days
[1:16:04] as the days of noah were so shall be
[1:16:06] also the coming of the son of man be
[1:16:09] for as in the days where both were
[1:16:11] before the flood
[1:16:13] they were eating drinking marrying
[1:16:16] and giving in marriage until the day
[1:16:18] that noah entered into the
[1:16:20] ark and all of a sudden bam
[1:16:23] door closed
[1:16:27] brother aaron preached a wonderful
[1:16:29] sermon on the fence is empty
[1:16:31] if you hadn't listened to it you ought
[1:16:32] to go listen to it i'm pretty sure it's
[1:16:33] in the archives today we'll get it to
[1:16:35] you

[1:16:37] again

[1:17:03] day for these critics and people making

[1:17:47] early church

[1:19:45] she found him
[1:19:46] she did something about it she fell at
[1:19:49] his feet and she worshiped

[1:20:44] suffered his house to be broken up
[1:20:47] therefore be you also ready for in such
[1:20:50] an hour as you think not
[1:20:52] the son of man cometh blessed is that
[1:20:55] servant whom is lord
[1:20:56] when he cometh shall find so doing
[1:20:59] verily i say unto you that he shall make
[1:21:01] him ruler over all his goods
[1:21:03] but and if that evil servant shall say
[1:21:05] in his heart my lord delayeth his
[1:21:07] servant
[1:21:07] his coming and shall begin to smite his
[1:21:10] fellow servants to eat and drink with
[1:21:12] the drunken
[1:21:12] the lord of that servant shall come in
[1:21:15] the day that he looketh not for him
[1:21:17] in an hour that he is not aware of and
[1:21:19] shall cut him a sunnah
[1:21:20] sunder and appoint him his portion with
[1:21:22] his with his portion with your
[1:21:24] hypocrites
[1:21:25] and there shall be weeping and gnashing
[1:21:27] of teeth
[1:21:28] luke 12 35 says let your loins be girded
[1:21:32] about
[1:21:32] and your lights burning amen
[1:21:36] oh hallelujah and ye yourselves like
[1:21:39] unto men
[1:21:40] that wait for their lord
[1:21:44] hallelujah when he will return from the
[1:21:47] wedding that when he cometh and knocking
[1:21:49] they may open to him immediately
[1:21:53] that's the kind of people we want to be
[1:21:55] amen that we're fervent and when we're
[1:21:57] here is not
[1:21:58] we open the door
[1:22:01] you know brother brahm talked about that
[1:22:02] guy that was criticizing an artist
[1:22:04] about the picture of jesus on the
[1:22:06] outside knocking the man on the inside
[1:22:08] and he said the guy the critic said well
[1:22:10] you forgot something
[1:22:11] how can he open the door when there's no
[1:22:13] lights for him to open the door and he
[1:22:15] said well that's the whole mystery of
[1:22:16] this
[1:22:17] he said the latch was actually on the
[1:22:19] inside
[1:22:20] you have to take the latch and open the
[1:22:22] door amen you got to get beyond the
[1:22:25] complacency
[1:22:26] that's just another service or i got
[1:22:28] been this way all my life
[1:22:30] you know you got to open the door and
[1:22:31] say god i see you
[1:22:33] and i want you to do something for me
[1:22:35] come in unto me lord
[1:22:37] and he said if you open the door i'll
[1:22:39] come in
[1:22:43] and it should come to pass and if it
[1:22:46] shall come to pass
[1:22:49] let me go back up verse 37 blessed are
[1:22:51] those servants
[1:22:52] whom the lord when he cometh shall find
[1:22:55] watching
[1:22:56] same word an action
[1:22:59] amen not not lacks not lazy about the
[1:23:03] things of god
[1:23:05] but watching it's more than just looking
[1:23:09] it's an action it's kind of about like
[1:23:12] the word the
[1:23:13] your manner of conversation or it's your
[1:23:15] manner of living
[1:23:17] this watch is more than just two
[1:23:18] eyeballs looking at a piece of paper or
[1:23:20] a wall
[1:23:21] somewhere no it's an action you're in
[1:23:23] anticipation
[1:23:25] any time he's coming back
[1:23:30] when he comes in to se and if you come
[1:23:32] in the second watcher come in the third
[1:23:33] watch
[1:23:34] find them so blessed are these servants
[1:23:36] and to know that if the good man of the
[1:23:37] house had known what hour the thief
[1:23:39] would come he'd have watched
[1:23:40] and not have suffered his house to be
[1:23:42] broken that through
[1:23:43] so be be therefore ready also for the
[1:23:47] son of man
[1:23:48] cometh and an hour when you think not
[1:23:52] first corinthians 16 13 says watch ye

[1:23:56] watch ye be on guard stand firm in your
[1:24:00] faith

[1:24:06] given to you stand fast in the faith
[1:24:08] and quit ye like men or in other words
[1:24:10] be mature and be courageous and be
[1:24:13] strong
[1:24:14] be like god called men
[1:24:18] watching first thessalonians 5
[1:24:21] 6 says therefore let us not sleep as do
[1:24:24] others
[1:24:25] but let us watch and be sober for they
[1:24:29] that sleep sleep
[1:24:30] in the night and they'd be drunk and are
[1:24:31] drunken in the night but let us
[1:24:33] who are of the day be sober put it on
[1:24:35] the breastplate of faith and love
[1:24:37] for a helmet the hope of salvation for
[1:24:39] god has not appointed us to wrath oh
[1:24:41] hallelujah
[1:24:42] but to obtain salvation by our lord
[1:24:45] jesus christ
[1:24:46] who died for us that whether we wake or
[1:24:48] sleep we shall live together with him
[1:24:50] first peter 5 8 says be sober be
[1:24:53] vigilant
[1:24:54] because your adversary the devil is a
[1:24:56] roaring lion
[1:24:57] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[1:25:01] and he's desired of many
[1:25:05] write off message pews
[1:25:11] zephaniah would say it like this
[1:25:15] the word of the lord came to zephaniah
[1:25:19] this is about the end time he said i
[1:25:21] will completely consume
[1:25:23] and sweep away all things from the face
[1:25:26] of the earth and judgment says the lord
[1:25:29] i will consume and sweep away this

[1:25:42] i will cut off and destroy man from the
[1:25:45] face of the earth declares the lord
[1:25:47] i will stretch out my hand in judgment
[1:25:49] against judah and against all the
[1:25:51] inhabitants of jerusalem
[1:25:52] i will cut off and destroy the remnant
[1:25:54] of baal from its place
[1:25:56] and the names and remember remembrances
[1:25:58] of the idolatrous priests along with the
[1:26:01] false priests
[1:26:02] and those who bow down and worship the
[1:26:03] host of heaven the sun the moon and the
[1:26:06] stars on the
[1:26:07] housetop those who bow down and swear
[1:26:09] oats and pretend to worship the lord
[1:26:12] did you hear that those who bow down
[1:26:15] and swear oaths and pretend to worship
[1:26:18] the lord
[1:26:19] and yet also swear by the pagan god
[1:26:21] called

[1:26:24] who have turned back from following the
[1:26:26] lord

[1:26:29] their most
[1:26:30] important need or inquired of him
[1:26:34] hush be silent before the lord god
[1:26:38] in other words there's no acceptable
[1:26:40] excuse to offer now
[1:26:42] for the day of vengeance of the lord is
[1:26:44] here
[1:26:45] for the lord has prepared a sacrifice he
[1:26:47] has set apart for his use those
[1:26:50] that have accepted his invitation then
[1:26:52] it will come about on the day of the
[1:26:54] lord's sacrifice
[1:26:55] that i will punish the princes and the
[1:26:57] king's sons
[1:26:58] and all who are clothed and lavished for
[1:27:01] and upheld
[1:27:02] reflecting their paganism mercy
[1:27:06] on that day i will also punish all those
[1:27:09] who leap over the temple threshold who
[1:27:12] fill their pagan lord's temple with
[1:27:14] violence in the sea
[1:27:15] on that day declares the lord there will
[1:27:17] be sound of crying from the fish gate
[1:27:20] and the northern wall of jerusalem where
[1:27:21] invaders enter and the wailing from the
[1:27:24] second quarter of the city
[1:27:25] and loud crashes from the hill well you
[1:27:28] inhabitants of morta
[1:27:29] and the merchants of canaan will be
[1:27:31] silenced and destroyed
[1:27:33] it'll come about at that time that i
[1:27:35] will search jerusalem
[1:27:37] with lamps and i will punish the men
[1:27:40] who are like old wine stagnant in spirit
[1:27:45] another one another translation says
[1:27:47] that are actually
[1:27:51] happy-go-lucky
[1:27:54] the same word complacent
[1:28:00] so complacent who say in their hearts
[1:28:02] the lord will not do
[1:28:04] good nor will he do evil
[1:28:08] the same ones that won't give honor to
[1:28:10] god when he heals sick
[1:28:14] give it all to the doctors the same one
[1:28:20] furthermore their wealth will become
[1:28:23] plunder
[1:28:24] their houses desolation they will build
[1:28:27] houses but not live in them plant
[1:28:29] vineyards but not drink their wine
[1:28:31] the great judgment day of the lord is
[1:28:33] here

[1:28:37] listen
[1:28:38] the day of the lord the warrior cries

[1:28:44] the wrath of god
[1:28:45] it is a day of trouble and distress it
[1:28:48] is a day of destruction and devastation
[1:28:50] a day of darkness and gloom a day of
[1:28:53] clouds and thick darkness a day of
[1:28:55] trumpet and battle cries
[1:28:56] of invaders against fortified cities
[1:28:59] against the high
[1:29:00] corner towers i will bring distress on
[1:29:02] men
[1:29:03] so that they will walk like blind men
[1:29:06] unable to find a way of escape
[1:29:08] because they have sinned against the
[1:29:10] lord and their blood will be poured out
[1:29:12] like dust
[1:29:13] and trampled under foot and their flesh
[1:29:15] like dung
[1:29:16] neither their silver nor their gold will
[1:29:19] be able to rescue them
[1:29:20] on the day of the lord's indignation and
[1:29:22] wrath and the whole earth will be
[1:29:24] consumed
[1:29:25] in a fire of his jealous wrath for he
[1:29:28] shall make
[1:29:28] full and complete in indeed an
[1:29:31] unterrifying one
[1:29:33] for all the inhabitants of the earth

[1:29:50] to get us out of this problem
[1:29:51] it ain't going to work this nation is
[1:29:54] following the path of prophecy

[1:36:38] business and he left and went

[1:36:49] girl
[1:36:50] she was making herself ready she was
[1:36:53] doing everything she could to earn
[1:36:54] whatever dollar she could get
[1:36:56] to go and buy her a gown to put on it

[1:37:11] promise that he was coming back
[1:37:13] she was concerned enough to get herself
[1:37:15] ready

[1:58:14] blemish
[1:58:16] without a spot what what a wonderful god
[1:58:20] and when i think

[2:00:12] vision
[2:00:14] just before the fire falls

[2:00:21] a woman who brother branham said was in
[2:00:24] royal high purple
[2:00:28] i saw her dress that's why he thought it
[2:00:30] was a roman catholic church
[2:00:32] because that's her colors is purple in
[2:00:35] scarlet
[2:00:38] but he said she'd be a vice president or

[2:00:48] we're here we're here
[2:00:51] we're right here in repeat
[2:00:55] as brother branham told us mr kennedy
[2:00:57] would make his
[2:00:59] make a good president no doubt but he'd
[2:01:02] just make a way
[2:01:03] for catholicism to warm its way all in
[2:01:06] through
[2:01:07] and now it's in our supreme court now
[2:01:09] it's everywhere it's now holding the
[2:01:11] nation
[2:01:11] it doesn't matter if you're conservative
[2:01:13] or you're liberal
[2:01:16] they got their fingers on both sides
[2:01:22] do you realize what we're standing do

[2:01:48] opportunity
[2:01:49] to come in amen because
[2:01:52] his table's gonna be full he's never
[2:01:55] named on the book

[2:02:00] not

[2:02:19] that's why the delay is
[2:02:21] [Music]
[2:02:31] but made know it's an evil sermon that
[2:02:33] keeps saying
[2:02:35] oh nothing's happening
[2:02:38] that still allows that complacency to
[2:02:41] rule their lives
[2:02:44] the fervency must be there
[2:02:49] a people that loves god like he
[2:02:53] loves them
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:58] a people that he could say when he would
[2:03:01] write a scripture when he write in the
[2:03:03] laws
[2:03:04] thou shalt not shall not now and then he
[2:03:07] would say
[2:03:08] that's not what i want if i can just get
[2:03:12] somebody to love me
[2:03:14] with all their heart with all their soul
[2:03:16] with all that's within them
[2:03:18] that's what i want i want somebody to
[2:03:21] love me
[2:03:23] a bride a people
[2:03:26] called for his namesake and when christ
