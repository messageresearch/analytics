[12:08] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise
[12:13] be the name of the Lord the Lord is
[12:16] worthy of our praise and all our honor a
[12:19] man I believe he deserves in this
[12:21] morning he meant we've seen him heal
[12:23] diseases we've seen him save the loss
[12:25] we've seen him move miraculously among
[12:28] us he deserves our praise this morning a
[12:30] man in our glory oh thank you Jesus
[12:34] let's just stand together as we take
[12:37] some knees before the Lord brother Joe
[12:38] if you could just get ready to open our
[12:40] service in prayer amen we just want to
[12:43] remember all the shut-ins this morning
[12:46] those in the nursing homes I was unable
[12:48] to make it today elderly brother sister
[12:52] Hollis different ones a man they would
[12:55] love to be here no doubt man we just had
[12:59] some more
[13:00] with him today also remember the Tim
[13:03] winters he's been really having some
[13:04] issues with his back and so it's really
[13:07] been giving him a lot of issues as far
[13:09] as working things even I believe that
[13:12] God is big enough for back problems he
[13:14] took those stripes he knows what back
[13:16] problems are he knows what it's like for
[13:18] his back to hurt and have issues they're
[13:21] not better to carry the weight so we
[13:24] want to just remember our brother in
[13:26] prayer also definitely want to continue
[13:28] to member brother on on Friday he had
[13:31] brain surgery to remove the tumors and
[13:33] the doctors were very pleased with how
[13:36] it went and said that they were they
[13:38] were just looking for a full recovery in
[13:40] that in that area and so but he still
[13:43] having of course some bad headaches from
[13:47] it and also some blood pressure issues
[13:49] there at 2 o'clock today which I guess
[13:52] would be one o'clock hour time they're
[13:53] gonna have an MRI just to go back and
[13:56] check things make sure everything is ok
[13:58] so we're just believing that it's all ok
[14:01] amen and so is his pain levels been
[14:06] about eight he says but just as
[14:09] yesterday it went down to around five
[14:11] but I believe in a God that can make it
[14:13] zero a man and so that's what we're
[14:17] looking for him and put his blood
[14:20] pressure to become normal and also he's
[14:23] still having issues with his peripheral
[14:25] vision but as we've been testified or
[14:29] the Darrell Ward talked about you know
[14:31] how his daughter was in that accident
[14:33] and lost her vision but it began to come
[14:37] back and the peripheral vision was one
[14:39] of the last things returned but there
[14:41] was a lamb for her
[14:43] and also testified from about my mother
[14:46] and her vision that she lost but there
[14:48] was a lamb for her and I believe the
[14:51] lamb is still on the throne he's still
[14:53] the intercessor for this need and and I
[14:56] believe if he did it once he'll do it
[14:57] again a man and he's just that kind of
[15:00] God and so we want to just go together
[15:02] as believers let's pray together amen
[15:05] lift you in your voice any man is
[15:08] brother Joe comes he comes to lead in
[15:10] prayer but they each and every one
[15:12] prayed to the morning ask God to move
[15:14] for these situations today if you have a
[15:16] need you want to make it known to him
[15:18] you can definitely lift your hand and
[15:21] say Lord I have a need today come by my
[15:23] way Amen let's just pray together man
[15:27] before we bow for prayer just want to
[15:29] share report as many of you know I was
[15:31] out last week there in Tucson
[15:32] ministering for brother Matt Watkins
[15:34] brother Matt sent a message to brother
[15:36] Tim he just said I wanted to tell you
[15:38] that the Lord used brother Joe Adams in
[15:40] a very special way in Tucson I never
[15:42] received so many reports from a single
[15:44] service both were good but the morning
[15:46] service broke out into an altar call
[15:48] many came back to the Lord to gave their
[15:50] hearts to the Lord many were delivered
[15:52] from spirits of anxiety depression joy
[15:55] was restored to set free from addictions
[15:57] from demon spirits even two young men
[15:59] requested to stay in the sanctuary
[16:01] between the two services to pray and
[16:03] they stayed there at the at the altar
[16:05] until the evening service because I'm
[16:07] still receiving texts concerning how the
[16:09] Lord used brother Joe in a special way
[16:11] and I was just remarking to brother
[16:14] brother Matt by the Matthew and he said
[16:18] well you know you mentioned in there
[16:20] that you felt the presence of the Lord I
[16:22] mentioned to him I said I was about five
[16:24] people into the prayer line and I felt
[16:26] an anointing just come and stand right
[16:28] beside me as I began to pray and there's
[16:30] just a presence that you don't always
[16:32] feel but you know he's there but this in
[16:35] particular service he was there I felt
[16:37] that he was there and not only did I
[16:39] feel that he was there the people I was
[16:41] praying for begin to step into that
[16:42] presence and you know they were able to
[16:45] get the deliverance that they needed and
[16:47] I administered
[16:48] administered on God will meet your
[16:50] expectations and brother Branham
[16:52] preached expectations in 1961 in that
[16:55] same Tabernacle behind the same pulpit
[16:57] before it became Tucson tabernacle and I
[17:00] believe he's still God today he's here
[17:02] this morning to meet your expectations
[17:04] the Bible says he would do exceeding
[17:06] abundantly above all that we can even
[17:09] ask or think
[17:10] think about your greatest thought your
[17:12] greatest desire your greatest prayer
[17:14] your greatest ambition the God that we
[17:16] serve will super abundantly meet and
[17:19] exceed what you can eat them fathom so
[17:21] if you've got a need here today I
[17:22] believe we have a God that'll meet that
[17:24] need I believe we serve a God I surpass
[17:27] that need so let's just take our knees
[17:28] to the Lord in prayer father how we
[17:30] thank you for your grace this morning
[17:32] how we thank you Lord that you don't
[17:34] leave us here in laodicea drifting
[17:36] through fighting through Lourdes trying
[17:38] to get by on our own but we serve a
[17:40] living God a present help in our times
[17:43] of trouble and we believe today father
[17:45] that you're the same yesterday today and
[17:48] forever that's not a cliche that's not
[17:50] just terminology of a message but Lord
[17:53] for the believer we trust in that we
[17:55] believe that the same God that we relied
[17:57] on yesterday is gonna be the same God
[17:59] that's gonna meet us this morning he's
[18:01] gonna be the same God that a carry us
[18:02] through tomorrow when we face trials and
[18:05] afflictions ahead and we believe today
[18:07] father you're still a healer you're
[18:09] still a deliverer and we're asking blow
[18:11] it on the wings of our prayer this
[18:12] morning that you'll go to those that are
[18:14] in need today father you Lord your work
[18:16] declares and by your stripes we are
[18:18] already healed father may we reach up on
[18:20] the pulsation of the word this morning
[18:22] and grab hold to that promise well if
[18:24] there's those in need in their body this
[18:26] morning father may they just grab hold
[18:28] of that pulsation and claim that healing
[18:30] and claim that deliverance dear God we
[18:33] pray Lord for the Hollis's that are shut
[18:34] in and the others that are shut in this
[18:36] morning God may you just touch them
[18:38] continue to give strength to their
[18:40] bodies Lord we pray for brother Tim
[18:42] winters father down in this back truly
[18:44] Lord anybody that's ever hurt their back
[18:46] understands the affliction and the pain
[18:48] and the agony but Lord we believe in
[18:50] that God that heals today we believe in
[18:52] a God that can restore the back problem
[18:55] Lord God and
[18:55] get away completely and we're asking
[18:58] that you'll move on my scene this
[18:59] morning father
[19:00] and when we pray for brother Ron
[19:01] continue to lift our brother up in
[19:03] prayer we believe in a supernatural we
[19:05] believe we're gonna see miracles not
[19:07] only we're gonna see miracles Lord but
[19:09] we believe this morning that we are
[19:11] miracles everyone here this morning look
[19:13] that's been changed by the blood of
[19:15] Jesus they're a miracle and this our
[19:17] Father now may your Holy Spirit just
[19:19] flood into that hospital room this
[19:21] morning Lord and when he goes in for it
[19:23] in my ride father may not find anything
[19:25] there but may the God that restores may
[19:28] he begin to move right now father
[19:30] and making the restore his eyesight
[19:31] begin to restore his body to perfect
[19:34] health God we believe it therefore we
[19:35] speak it and we accept it in the mighty
[19:37] name of Jesus Christ and what I believe
[19:40] you're to hear today to not only meet
[19:43] our expectations but take see them Lord
[19:46] to do super abundantly father more than
[19:49] we can fathom may this service this
[19:52] morning not just be another service but

[19:56] people come under an expectation to see
[19:59] God to feel God to experience the
[20:02] supernatural Lord you promised another
[20:04] outpouring of the Holy Spirit may we be
[20:07] the recipients of that outpouring this

[46:51] house of the Lord and amen have the
[46:54] privilege of serving him we want to
[46:56] welcome each one of you today and those
[46:59] that are with us that aren't normally
[47:02] here but you're gathered with us this
[47:05] morning we're just really they're happy
[47:08] to have each one of you that has
[47:09] assembled with us if you'll turn with me
[47:12] to Revelation chapter 5 we're going to
[47:15] read from the first verse and as you're
[47:18] turning just reminding you we have the
[47:21] two services today and we try to come
[47:25] back for the second service about 4:30
[47:29] and between that we're going to be
[47:31] having a little bit of a business
[47:33] meeting and just discussing some of the
[47:35] things on the church if you're your if
[47:40] you tend to hear regularly and pay your
[47:42] tithes here you're welcome to come to
[47:43] that meeting
[47:45] and we're going to try that about four
[47:48] o'clock and we'll see how it works out
[47:50] anyway revelations five and verse one
[47:53] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[47:56] sat on the throne a book written within
[47:59] and on the backside sealed with seven
[48:02] seals and I saw a strong angel
[48:04] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[48:06] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[48:08] seals thereof and no man in heaven nor
[48:12] in earth neither under the earth was
[48:14] able to open the book neither to look
[48:16] thereon and I wept much because no man
[48:20] was found worthy to open and to read the
[48:22] book neither to look thereon and one of
[48:26] the elders said unto me weep not behold
[48:28] the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[48:30] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[48:32] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[48:37] I beheld and lo in the midst of the
[48:39] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[48:41] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[48:43] had been slain having seven horns and
[48:47] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[48:49] of God sent forth into all the earth and
[48:52] he came and took the book out of the
[48:55] right hand of him that sat upon the
[48:57] throne and god bless his word you can be
[49:00] seated this morning we're going to be
[49:05] continuing our thought about the
[49:07] abstract and we'll be getting into some
[49:10] other portions of this as we go along I
[49:14] want to speak about this because you
[49:19] know because it deals with art legal
[49:22] rights and what God has promised for RJ
[49:25] and so we're going to be speaking on the
[49:29] abstract to the open book as we're
[49:31] looking this because we're living in the
[49:34] day with the book is no longer closed
[49:37] but God has opened the book and brought
[49:41] us back to Paul's gospel were that we
[49:44] can preach exactly what Paul preached
[49:47] and we're looking at the scene and we
[49:50] see the one on the throne is the creator
[49:52] of the universe and of course he holds
[49:55] the title in his hand and
[49:57] it's a book and that book is a title to
[50:01] everything that man lost and this book
[50:05] of course is the believer because it
[50:08] represents every believer and I believe
[50:11] that every one of our names are in this
[50:14] book and I'm glad to say that we have
[50:17] seen our names in the book of redemption
[50:19] every one that has been redeemed and
[50:21] saved he lets you know I've chosen you
[50:25] before the world began a man and so the
[50:29] book is a title to all that man lost
[50:31] represents every believer but it must be
[50:35] claimed or all hope for a resurrection
[50:39] of the New Testament Saints is lost and
[50:42] the call goes out for a worthy man and
[50:47] the book of Courts has held it in the
[50:51] hands of God on the throne but but the
[50:53] possession must move from God's hands
[50:58] back to man's hands and and of course we
[51:03] can look back in the historical records
[51:06] of the scripture and we can see that
[51:09] Matthew taught us and told us gave us a
[51:13] real clue of what happened at the
[51:15] resurrection when we learned that Jesus
[51:18] paid the debt of all mankind that the
[51:22] Old Testament Saints before us
[51:24] they have already obtained what Adam
[51:27] lost in the sense that they were
[51:30] resurrected from the from spoonful of
[51:34] ashes and they are now in immortal
[51:37] bodies Paul told us of Abel and Enoch
[51:42] and Noah Abraham Sarah Isaac Jacob
[51:46] Joseph Moses and Rahab and then in
[51:50] hebrews 11:32 he he just says and what
[51:54] shall i say more for the time would fail
[51:57] me to tell of gideon of ab a rock and of
[52:00] samson objecting and david also and
[52:04] samuel the prophets and who through
[52:07] faith subdued kingdoms
[52:10] and wrought righteousness and obtained
[52:12] promises and stopped the mouth of the
[52:15] Lions and quinces the violence of the
[52:17] fire and escaped the edge of the sword
[52:20] and out of weakness were made strong and
[52:23] waxed valiant in fight and turn to
[52:26] flight the armies of the aliens women
[52:29] received their dead raised to life again
[52:31] and others were tortured not accepting
[52:34] deliverance that they might obtain a
[52:37] better resurrection and others that
[52:40] cruel trial of cruel mockings and
[52:42] scourgings jaya moreover of bonds and
[52:46] imprisonment they were stoned and that
[52:48] was sawn asunder and they were tempted
[52:50] and were slain with the sword and that
[52:53] wandered about in sheepskins and
[52:54] goatskins being destitute and afflicted
[52:58] and tormented of whom this world was not
[53:02] worthy they wandered in in deserts and
[53:05] and mountains and dens and caves of the
[53:08] earth and these all having obtained a
[53:11] good report through faith received not
[53:14] the promise but God having provided some
[53:17] better thing for us that they without us
[53:20] should not be made perfect they won't be
[53:23] complete without us so even though that
[53:27] they are in redeemed bodies and wait in
[53:30] heaven
[53:30] there that the earth has not been
[53:34] returned back to man again it is still
[53:37] under the power of the Prince of the
[53:39] power of the air which is Satan
[53:42] but at Calvary we know jesus paid
[53:45] redemptive price and there the Old
[53:48] Testament Saints race and doing corpora
[53:51] and corruptible bodies and ascended with
[53:54] Jesus in the heaven because Jesus
[53:57] cleared their debt now so he gave them
[54:02] the church and abstract are a cleared
[54:06] deed so understand this when Jesus paid
[54:11] the price at Calvary he provided an
[54:15] abstract and cleared the deed of all the
[54:19] records against the Old Testament Saints
[54:22] and not only the Old Testament Saints in
[54:25] that that he cleared the deed of where
[54:28] they failure to keep the law under
[54:30] failure to walk perfect and then he
[54:32] would he would redeem them and to set
[54:35] them free from from the place called
[54:38] paradise and they would come back to the
[54:40] earth and they would resurrect and there
[54:43] they would a sin with him and so you can
[54:47] see their death was completely cleared
[54:51] but then Jesus would send back an
[54:54] abstract on the day of Pentecost which
[54:57] is a clear deed so if you look let me
[55:01] just share it with you a little quote
[55:03] turn from brother Branham and God's
[55:05] provided places of worship he said let's
[55:08] take a look at those faithful ones at
[55:10] Pentecost they were all in the upper
[55:13] room there and they were all scared they
[55:16] had the title alright but they were
[55:18] afraid and all at once that came a sound
[55:22] from heaven the abstract was sent down
[55:25] to them like a rushing mighty wind and
[55:29] it filled all the house where they were
[55:31] sitting and they were so quickened by
[55:33] that to all their cloudiness and one of
[55:37] them was even afraid that even denied he
[55:39] wasn't even a Pharisee yet or a
[55:41] Sadducees yet but when the Holy Ghost
[55:43] fell and baptized him into Jesus Christ
[55:46] he became flesh of his flesh and bone of
[55:49] his bone and word of his word
[55:51] he was a new creation he was a new
[55:53] person it quickened his body so the
[55:57] early church we know could have been
[55:59] raptured had they not been planted as a
[56:04] seed because God had more names in the
[56:09] book beside them so you see he had to
[56:13] wait until every name on the book was
[56:17] manifested on the earth and their deed
[56:21] cleared so you see now again the court
[56:26] of wheat would have been would have to
[56:27] be planted it would come up again as a
[56:29] blade at aussolas shop until it comes
[56:33] back again for a
[56:36] harvest time and I'd like to report this
[56:39] morning we are back at a harvest season
[56:42] we are actually at another Pentecost and
[56:47] we have come down to the last stage we
[56:49] have had a week of ages and we are here
[56:52] now at the end of the seventh eighth the
[56:56] word Pentecost means 50 it occurred um
[56:59] it occurred seven weeks after the
[57:03] Passover the Passover would begin with a
[57:06] lamb without blemish and then the lamb
[57:09] was slain and then it would be serviced
[57:12] with unleavened bread and this Passover
[57:15] Feast was the beginning of the feast of
[57:18] unleavened bread and that feast of
[57:20] unleavened bread would go for seven days
[57:23] at which would also again represent
[57:26] seven church ages because we were are
[57:30] supposed to have been fed unleavened
[57:34] bread for the past seven church ages and
[57:37] so brother Branham would tell us in the
[57:40] rapture message he says as I was
[57:43] speaking in the communion when they kill
[57:45] that sacrificial lamb there was to be no
[57:48] leaven among them through the entire
[57:51] seven days no leaven no leavened bread
[57:54] everything had to be unleavened that
[57:57] represented the seven churches that we
[58:00] just get that we get in the book here
[58:02] and there's no leaven it is what it is
[58:06] something mixed with it and we mixed
[58:08] Creed and denomination everything else
[58:11] with the word and still try to call it
[58:13] the word no leaven shall be the entire
[58:17] seven days again and things are to be he
[58:21] would say similar common the southern
[58:24] Church ages in no no 11 no creed no
[58:28] nothing added it had to be absolutely
[58:32] unleavened bread no leaven shall be
[58:35] found among you at all just eleventh
[58:38] unleavened the word itself that only and
[58:41] that's the Word of God
[58:42] so you see this this whole feast of
[58:45] unleavened bread but also represent
[58:48] seven church ages and and this is where
[58:52] the real true bride of every age must
[58:56] eat the word only a man so let you know
[59:00] again we come down here to the end it's
[59:02] really important we keep the message
[59:04] pure man Lebanon and the bread will get
[59:09] you rejected we don't want to put our
[59:10] own ideas to the message also in the
[59:14] types is the Jubilee year and in action
[59:18] Israel ever 7 years was a Sabbath year
[59:21] and then after seven seventh years which
[59:25] would be seven times seven came at
[59:27] Jubilee and the Jubilee was a time where
[59:30] every man went back to his own
[59:32] possession it was a time of where every
[59:36] ever slave of Israel would receive
[59:39] personal freedom and the canceling of
[59:42] death and the restoration of poor a
[59:45] property so you know this is a very
[59:49] important time but you believe a time
[59:53] where slaves feel free and man of time
[59:57] where property is restored a time where
[1:00:01] again you get an abstract or the
[1:00:03] cancelling of debt and ever lien against
[1:00:06] the property is taken off this is really
[1:00:10] important because we are now in another
[1:00:13] Jubilee we have reached the seventh age
[1:00:16] of seven weeks of years and again is
[1:00:20] typed out we're at another Jubilee hey
[1:00:24] man it's illegal for Satan to make any
[1:00:28] of us slaves
[1:00:30] I'm and it's illegal the freedom bell
[1:00:33] rings the ram horn blows hey man it
[1:00:39] involved it blowing of the ram's horn
[1:00:42] the trumpet and the hole represents the
[1:00:45] Rams power I'm Manning through the round
[1:00:49] and the sounding of his trumpet every
[1:00:51] man went back to his possession and
[1:00:54] every slave of Israel was free oh I
[1:00:58] think of that here was that we are right
[1:01:01] back to the beginning again were that we
[1:01:04] go back to what was lost at Pentecost
[1:01:06] amen in the first stage and the death of
[1:01:10] every age has been canceled and every
[1:01:13] slave a denomination has now been set
[1:01:16] free and we can walk as children of God
[1:01:20] and the glorious liberty of Jesus Christ
[1:01:22] amen now so all of these were types and
[1:01:27] and on the and of course the 50th day
[1:01:29] after Passover was now after seven weeks
[1:01:33] had transpired would come the day of
[1:01:36] Pentecost and the fiftieth day is is
[1:01:40] really a representative of the Jubilee
[1:01:43] the 50th year and in the Old Testament
[1:01:46] each of the seven Sabbath represented a
[1:01:50] land rest and and of that would be
[1:01:53] followed by the fiftieth day and then
[1:01:57] and then on Pentecost that law was given
[1:02:01] in Exodus 19 and and the Ten
[1:02:04] Commandments were given and on Pentecost
[1:02:07] and again in the New Testament the Holy
[1:02:10] Spirit was given and that's to I think
[1:02:13] it's wonderful when we just compare it
[1:02:16] as the Holy Spirit would bring it down
[1:02:19] to the types in the Bible here after the
[1:02:22] Passover lamb was slain in the Exodus
[1:02:25] they would journey through the
[1:02:28] wilderness to finally Mount Sinai and
[1:02:31] they would come to the Mount of God and
[1:02:34] it would be seven weeks after the
[1:02:37] Passover and on the day of Pentecost the
[1:02:40] first Pentecost it would be the
[1:02:43] upon the mountain God would give the law
[1:02:46] his covenant to Israel hallelujah and so
[1:02:52] he would give that called that covenant
[1:02:54] the law to Israel and and and it would
[1:02:58] be there that God would take Israel for
[1:03:01] a bride are you with me and he would
[1:03:06] covenant with him but immediately we
[1:03:09] remember as soon as the law is given
[1:03:11] there they could wait for even the law
[1:03:15] to come down from the mountain without
[1:03:17] them breaking the Word of God and man
[1:03:21] and what happened there that word
[1:03:23] Arabelle and begin to worship a golden
[1:03:26] calf and with after worshiping the
[1:03:29] golden calf then the gold from it would
[1:03:32] be taken and ground up in powder and
[1:03:34] sewed into the waters and the people
[1:03:36] would drink of that water and then there
[1:03:39] would be 3000 of them died now but I
[1:03:46] want you to notice in the New Testament
[1:03:49] it would begin also with something
[1:03:53] happening it would be with again 50 days
[1:03:57] after the Passover after Jesus would die
[1:04:03] the true Lamb of God and there the law
[1:04:07] the Word of God would be given again and
[1:04:11] it would be written by the finger of God
[1:04:13] like the first law because they're on
[1:04:17] the Mount Sinai the finger of God would
[1:04:19] write the law in tablets of stone but
[1:04:23] now on the day of Pentecost God would
[1:04:26] take his finger and he would write not
[1:04:29] in tablets of stone but in the heart and
[1:04:31] he would change the very nature of man
[1:04:34] and put the Word of God as something is
[1:04:37] not external but something now internal
[1:04:41] whether you're not you're not obeying
[1:04:44] the word from a laws of sound and thou
[1:04:47] shalt not
[1:04:49] but now the word is living in you a man
[1:04:52] that has kept because it's the divine
[1:04:55] nature that is written in the life are
[1:04:59] you with me now and there on the day of
[1:05:02] Pentecost is somebody with me on the day
[1:05:04] of Pentecost the Holy Spirit would come
[1:05:07] down right in the word into the heart of
[1:05:11] the believer the fire of glob coming
[1:05:13] down like tongues of fire and carving
[1:05:16] out within the nature of matter put it
[1:05:19] in there the Word of God writing it in
[1:05:21] his nature
[1:05:24] hallelujah a mound and immediately as
[1:05:29] the news broke instead of three thousand
[1:05:33] died and three thousands were added to
[1:05:35] the church because the Old Testament was
[1:05:39] a covenant of death but this is a
[1:05:41] covenant of life now it's very
[1:05:49] interesting that at the beginning of the
[1:05:51] countdown from the Passover to Pentecost
[1:05:55] that after at the very beginning of the
[1:05:59] Passover and the countdown begins when
[1:06:03] they when the there is a barley wave
[1:06:07] offering this was the first fruit of the
[1:06:12] harvest season the barley would ripen
[1:06:15] before the wheat which would actually be
[1:06:18] 50 days later so there would be a span
[1:06:21] of seven weeks between the two harvest
[1:06:24] and so that the day after the Passover
[1:06:30] there under the first day of the week it
[1:06:34] would be that the priest would take the
[1:06:38] the the first of the barley and he would
[1:06:42] take him and impress it and he would
[1:06:45] make enormous of OMERS that he would
[1:06:48] hold of this barley and he would wave it
[1:06:53] before the Lord and it was saying in
[1:06:57] that that though it was given a thanks
[1:07:01] offering to God for
[1:07:02] the harvests but it was saying all while
[1:07:06] so it was thanking God for the rest
[1:07:08] that would be harvested hey man so now
[1:07:13] it is striking to know that when Jesus
[1:07:16] arose from the dead early in the morning
[1:07:20] and he makes his appearing to Mary
[1:07:23] Magdalene and to those at the tomb that
[1:07:28] in that moment in that time at that same
[1:07:32] time the high priest is in the temple
[1:07:35] and he has taken the first of the
[1:07:38] harvest and he is waving it before the
[1:07:41] Lord amen and at the same time Jesus
[1:07:46] raised from the dead as the firstfruits
[1:07:50] of the Resurrection and all the Old
[1:07:55] Testament Saints rise with him
[1:07:58] hallelujah a man and a percentage of
[1:08:02] Jehovah has a representative of the
[1:08:05] Saints that are yet to come
[1:08:08] hallelujah God is already Smith
[1:08:11] he has already been praised and thanked
[1:08:13] him for the great harvest here in this
[1:08:16] end time that he'll have a bride without
[1:08:19] spot or wrinkle it was identified in
[1:08:22] Jesus Christ the Bible said it in first
[1:08:26] Corinthians 15:20 that Jesus had become
[1:08:28] the firstfruits of them that slept a man
[1:08:33] now it was concluded that after that at
[1:08:38] the end of the countdown to Pentecost
[1:08:42] was when there would be a wheat harvest
[1:08:47] wave offering now notice two wave
[1:08:51] offerings one for the barri and one for
[1:08:56] the wheat and so it would be 50 days
[1:09:00] after the barley has been waved and it
[1:09:04] would be
[1:09:04] now the wheats turn to be weighed and of
[1:09:08] course it represents those Saints at the
[1:09:12] end of the age that would also be
[1:09:14] up from the grave here at this last day
[1:09:18] at this Pentecost because we are here in
[1:09:23] a Pentecost
[1:09:24] you see Jesus died the Passover lamb and
[1:09:28] he was the first fruit and the fever's
[1:09:31] the first fruit of the resurrection two
[1:09:33] ones are the Old Testament this was a
[1:09:35] barley harvest he was a sheaf wave he
[1:09:38] was the abstract holder he had cleared
[1:09:41] the deed and with him came up Abraham
[1:09:44] Isaac and Jacob and all the righteous
[1:09:47] dead of the Old Testament and all the
[1:09:49] paradises emptied that holding place
[1:09:52] where they were waiting for the one
[1:09:54] worthy the worthy Lamb that can pay
[1:09:58] redemption price but I want you to know
[1:10:03] that we are now in the seventh week or
[1:10:06] seven Church ages later in the harvest
[1:10:11] season in the week harvest season are
[1:10:17] you with me two thousand years ago was
[1:10:20] the barley the Old Testament they raised
[1:10:23] from the dead
[1:10:24] a man but now we are advanced to two
[1:10:28] thousand years forward seven Church ages
[1:10:31] later a man to wear that it's now a time
[1:10:35] for the for the the day of Pentecost for
[1:10:40] the very Holy Spirit to raise up a bride
[1:10:43] in this in time that it will wave before
[1:10:47] the world to say all of them will be
[1:10:49] raised just like this one has raised
[1:10:52] from the dead of the tombs of
[1:10:54] denomination all the dead and Christ
[1:10:56] were raised just like they have raised
[1:11:03] do we harvest the first ripened grains
[1:11:06] of the wheat their ground and baked
[1:11:09] until the two loaves of bread Norway
[1:11:11] before the Lord for there's to be
[1:11:14] another resurrection in this end time of
[1:11:17] the New Testament believers I believe
[1:11:20] we're in the hour of the resurrection I
[1:11:22] keep saying and I'll tell you again 1st
[1:11:26] Thessalonians 4 is not the funeral
[1:11:28] scripture and man if you know first
[1:11:31] Corinthians 15 is not just a funeral
[1:11:34] scripture and Manny it is a scripture it
[1:11:39] is a word that has been left to be
[1:11:41] fulfilled here in the end time we must
[1:11:44] keep our level of expectancy for the
[1:11:48] Word of God to be manifest among us
[1:11:51] until even the dead in Christ rise and
[1:11:54] appear among us who were changed in a
[1:11:57] moment in a twinkling of an eye now
[1:12:01] notice here the coming of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:04] was at the same time on the day of
[1:12:08] Pentecost it was at the same time the
[1:12:10] priests were waving the wheat loaves in
[1:12:14] the temple so just as it was 50 days
[1:12:17] before it after the Passover and Jesus
[1:12:20] raised from the dead on the first day of
[1:12:21] the week the priests were waving the
[1:12:23] OMERS of the barley and saying you know
[1:12:27] this is the firstfruits and pronouncing
[1:12:29] the blessing on the harvest that at the
[1:12:32] same time now on the day of Pentecost
[1:12:35] there when they were gathered in the
[1:12:37] upper room over here in the temple there
[1:12:40] were the priests and they were holding
[1:12:43] up the wave loads of Pentecost of the
[1:12:46] bread of the wheat bread and was waving
[1:12:50] them before the Lord and at the same
[1:12:53] time that they are they're waving out
[1:12:56] the type over here in the upper room
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:02] hallelujah amen where the Passover Feast
[1:13:05] was had been served in the upper room
[1:13:08] now on the day of Pentecost here comes a
[1:13:12] sound from heaven and it's not it's not
[1:13:17] just a type that is happening but the
[1:13:20] Holy Spirit Himself is coming down and
[1:13:23] begins to wave like a rushing mighty
[1:13:27] wind as the promise of the word has
[1:13:31] comes down and is being waved over the
[1:13:33] people hallelujah what was God doing by
[1:13:38] this waving of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:13:40] upper room
[1:13:40] his tongues of fire came down like a
[1:13:43] rushing mighty wind he was sending an
[1:13:47] abstract of title suing that the lamb
[1:13:51] was accepted in heaven come out and his
[1:13:56] blood - had a tone and sin debt was paid
[1:13:59] and the harvest was beginning Alleluia
[1:14:06] brother Branham told us and it is the
[1:14:08] rising of the Sun and bear with me as I
[1:14:11] read this quotations here but he said
[1:14:14] notice it was the first corn of God's
[1:14:16] wheat that it raised from the dead God's
[1:14:20] first quart of wheat you see they were
[1:14:23] dead and since trespasses but now they
[1:14:27] were raising up into life a man by God's
[1:14:31] quickening power got it quick in his
[1:14:33] life and raised him of them to death and
[1:14:36] he was the firstfruits of those who
[1:14:37] slept the first fruit he was that chief
[1:14:40] that's why they had to wave that chief
[1:14:43] it was the first one they come to
[1:14:44] maturity and it was waves as a memorial
[1:14:48] Thanksgiving that God believing that the
[1:14:50] rest of them would come it was a sign
[1:14:53] and today because he is the first son of
[1:14:57] God to come to maturity to be in God he
[1:15:00] was plucked up from the earth and is
[1:15:02] waved over the people oh what a glorious
[1:15:05] lesson by the quickening power the first
[1:15:08] one although he had been tight many
[1:15:11] times but this was really the first
[1:15:13] fruits of them that slept he was waved
[1:15:16] over the promised seed that had promise
[1:15:20] of life and he was waved at the day of
[1:15:23] Pentecost when there came a sound from
[1:15:25] heaven like a waving mighty Russian wind
[1:15:29] and was waved over the people the
[1:15:32] Pentecostal people that were at
[1:15:34] Pentecost waiting for the blessing to
[1:15:36] come now watch and then he carries it
[1:15:39] over to our day and in order for this to
[1:15:42] happen there has to be another Pentecost
[1:15:45] and he said it is to be
[1:15:48] waived again we realize in the last day
[1:15:52] according to Luke 1730 in the Sunday
[1:15:56] again in the day that the CSO in a man
[1:16:00] will be revealed or waived over the
[1:16:04] people amen
[1:16:06] now who is the son of man in the
[1:16:08] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:16:10] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:16:13] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:16:15] and if all the teaching that we have and
[1:16:17] confirmation of the Word of God by word
[1:16:21] of god by signs by wonders and we see
[1:16:24] today in the Book of Luke here's a 70
[1:16:27] chapter xxx verse and Malik had formed
[1:16:29] the different scriptures that we were
[1:16:31] acquainted with that that word is a
[1:16:33] camera wave over the people that the
[1:16:37] dead traditions of man is dead and the
[1:16:41] son of God is alive again with the
[1:16:44] baptism of the Holy Spirit right among
[1:16:47] us giving us life hallelujah brother
[1:16:52] Branham was telling us that the word the
[1:16:54] coming of the word the restoration of
[1:16:57] the word in this day was bringing
[1:16:59] another Pentecost a man another waving
[1:17:03] of the sheaf and it was the word this
[1:17:06] time not not the person Jesus come on
[1:17:09] but now the person of the word being way
[1:17:12] back over the people what was it doing
[1:17:16] it was announcing we are in a harvest
[1:17:19] season and every son and daughter of God
[1:17:22] is going to be the word just like he's
[1:17:24] the word a man as a Christ was the first
[1:17:28] one to raise from all the prophets and
[1:17:31] so forth
[1:17:31] although type 2 many places he was the
[1:17:34] firstfruits of those who slept in the
[1:17:38] bright command of Christ what sis now we
[1:17:40] know 2,000 years ago he came as the
[1:17:44] groom but somebody help me now in this
[1:17:48] day yeah we're going to meet him in
[1:17:51] there the right will be the body form of
[1:17:56] Jesus Christ we will meet the physical
[1:17:58] body of Jesus Christ in the air
[1:18:01] that's what believers believe a man but
[1:18:05] in order for there to be a rapture there
[1:18:08] has to be a manifestation of Christ on
[1:18:11] the earth but this time not in grim form
[1:18:15] but in bribe form Alleluia so in the
[1:18:20] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[1:18:23] church don't have to be a sheaf waved
[1:18:26] again in the last days hallelujah

[1:18:32] scene the first one that come to mature

[1:18:38] proved it was a sheaf hallelujah I'm
[1:18:42] sure you see what I'm talking about
[1:18:44] it was waved over the people

[1:22:04] and that the full maturity of the word
[1:22:06] has turned back again in full power and

[1:22:19] speaking to his wife because I live you
[1:22:23] shall live also what a resurrection that
[1:22:26] was
[1:22:28] oh my we got churches around the world
[1:22:31] today honoring the resurrection -
[1:22:33] meeting them Sunday they're talking
[1:22:35] about Jesus roads in which the glad he
[1:22:40] did because without that resurrection we
[1:22:43] would be lost is that right
[1:22:46] man but I'll tell you what a
[1:22:48] resurrection that was but what
[1:22:51] resurrection this is I'm going to be
[1:22:55] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[1:22:57] by in Christ Jesus by God's quickening
[1:23:01] power you see it ain't enough for Jesus

[1:23:14] the bride is gonna live hallelujah the
[1:23:18] same works that he did so you knew also
[1:23:21] and greater than these rock go to my
[1:23:23] father because the bride is not to be a
[1:23:27] dead church cxeh be a living vibrant
[1:23:30] church he was waved to them the word
[1:23:37] which he was waved to them back to them
[1:23:40] on the day of Pentecost the word made
[1:23:42] manifest and he said and as I say it's
[1:23:45] to be waved again in the last day I'm
[1:23:49] just telling you get ready your own
[1:23:52] display a man in your own display a man
[1:24:01] it's a sign - it's a it's a waving unto
[1:24:04] God your bride is bone of your bone and
[1:24:07] flesh is fresh but it's also waving to
[1:24:10] our enemies to Satan itself that Satan
[1:24:15] is not triumphant
[1:24:17] that with the raising of this bride will
[1:24:21] come as the firstfruits of the
[1:24:23] resurrection will come all the dead in
[1:24:25] Christ and the halt of the Oh new
[1:24:27] testament church so what a day that
[1:24:30] we're living in now the descending of
[1:24:37] the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
[1:24:39] was the giving of an abstract to the
[1:24:43] believers to every believer that
[1:24:46] received it that their sin that was paid
[1:24:49] I'm gonna tell you they got a Jubilee
[1:24:53] this is why they came out of the Upper
[1:24:56] Room like did yet because they got a
[1:24:58] revelation my sins and paid my debt is
[1:25:02] over even I care will not be a slave to
[1:25:05] Satan any longer man I can return back
[1:25:09] to the property and then everything that
[1:25:12] Jesus paid for his mind hallelujah
[1:25:15] because he cancelled the debt a man so
[1:25:19] you see that that the sending of the
[1:25:21] Holy Spirit on that day of Pentecost was
[1:25:24] given an abstract of title to those
[1:25:28] believers now we come to the last days
[1:25:33] seven Church ages now after the Passover
[1:25:37] let's just go back and there's been the
[1:25:39] Passover where Jesus died at Calvary and
[1:25:43] we've marked now seven Church ages and
[1:25:46] it brings us to another day of Pentecost
[1:25:51] and we need once again the clearing of
[1:25:55] the deed because of the unbelief of the
[1:25:59] ages I'm gonna I'm gonna deal with this
[1:26:03] just for a little bit because I want you
[1:26:06] to understand why we need a clear deed
[1:26:10] we need the clearing of the deed because
[1:26:13] of the unbelief and the sins of the ages
[1:26:17] this is why that when you look in the
[1:26:20] book of Revelation which is a book
[1:26:23] allotted to the last day remember it was
[1:26:27] not even for their time was that even
[1:26:31] written when Paul was here upon the
[1:26:33] earth it would be written after Paul it
[1:26:35] would be the last book and it would be
[1:26:38] written in symbols because it would be
[1:26:41] reserved for last day people so I want
[1:26:46] you when you think about the book of
[1:26:48] Revelation is actually the apocalypse or
[1:26:52] the unveiling the unveiling of Jesus
[1:26:56] Christ it is showing his plan of
[1:26:58] redemption so now again when we look at
[1:27:04] it we see in this book of Revelation
[1:27:07] that there's the book that Jesus paid
[1:27:10] for but yet the book is closed it is
[1:27:16] held in the hands of God and it can only
[1:27:20] be taken by a worthy man to step forth
[1:27:24] from eternity and to take the book and
[1:27:27] to open its seals want you to get that I
[1:27:31] want you to get a visual here now when
[1:27:33] when we see it open in Revelation 5 it's
[1:27:36] a closed book but it ends with an open
[1:27:42] book and it concludes that chapter with
[1:27:46] all creation worshiping God so it is a
[1:27:49] process
[1:27:50] I mean the seals on the book keep it
[1:27:55] closed and it is closed but no man is
[1:27:59] worthy to look on the book it isn't you
[1:28:05] know it isn't we just can't take the
[1:28:07] book we can't even look at it
[1:28:11] now we went through it last week on how
[1:28:14] the seals were put on the book we know
[1:28:17] it was done by the Antichrist and it was
[1:28:20] kept and it has kept the rapture from
[1:28:23] the church for the past 2,000 years
[1:28:27] until and and and God has been waiting
[1:28:32] year after year until every name is
[1:28:37] manifested on earth whose names are in
[1:28:40] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:28:44] now men throughout the ages wanted to
[1:28:47] enforce a claim for the book for example
[1:28:52] as we will look we'll talk about the
[1:28:55] different ones and even the ages prior
[1:28:59] to this but there was no man worthy
[1:29:02] there was no prophet there was no priest
[1:29:04] there was no Moses it was no Elijah
[1:29:06] there was no messenger the ages that was
[1:29:09] worthy and it could only be done until
[1:29:14] the worthy man is found and only until
[1:29:18] he claims the book now 2,000 years ago
[1:29:24] we had the purchasing and then and then
[1:29:29] of course we have had the an accessory
[1:29:32] work now for 2,000 years while Jesus has
[1:29:36] interceded waiting for every name in the
[1:29:40] book to be called and it manifests it on
[1:29:44] the earth as huh as hurry as I am for
[1:29:46] the rapture I can't go until your name
[1:29:50] is revealed in the book and map that
[1:29:58] means I'm waiting on you wherever you
[1:30:02] are around the world and man I'm waiting
[1:30:05] for your name to be revealed
[1:30:08] amen I pray it'll be this morning that
[1:30:12] you'll see your name in the book
[1:30:14] hallelujah amen brother Branham talked
[1:30:17] about he said John muster saw his name
[1:30:20] in the book that's why he was rejoicing
[1:30:22] I'll tell you what when you get to see
[1:30:24] your name in the book it'll make you
[1:30:28] start rejoicing to you start shouting a
[1:30:31] man until all the heavens hear you shout
[1:30:34] amen because you see your name and the
[1:30:36] book of Redemption
[1:30:38] I know what he did to me I know whether
[1:30:42] to do for you hallelujah - no ha ha was
[1:30:47] in his thoughts
[1:30:50] and he could never leave me out but now
[1:30:57] there would be men like Luther let's
[1:31:00] just imagine loser would probe into the
[1:31:02] book he wanted to understand the
[1:31:05] mysteries and you know he he understood
[1:31:08] what he could he probed into it enough
[1:31:10] and in the end would try and try to look
[1:31:14] you know on an unworthy man trying to
[1:31:17] understand what what was in the book
[1:31:22] redemption how to be redeemed want to
[1:31:26] understand the mysteries Luther wanted a
[1:31:29] rapture he wanted a body changed - he
[1:31:35] wanted to be the age that delivers all
[1:31:37] nature I let's just imagine and the
[1:31:41] loser spits up to claim the book and he
[1:31:44] says you know I probed in there and as
[1:31:46] I've seen - just shall live by faith
[1:31:50] but the accuser of the Brethren secret
[1:31:53] stem cells but I still got a claim on
[1:31:56] Luther you see we got a deed but we need
[1:32:02] an abstract and the abstract pays the
[1:32:07] debt that is against the man to take
[1:32:10] possession and so he said I've got a
[1:32:14] claim on Luther he only has
[1:32:16] justification all the revelation he's
[1:32:19] glad of the new birth is there just
[1:32:22] shall live by faith and he still got my
[1:32:24] my Trinitarian baptism you know the
[1:32:27] Trinitarian baptism is not gods it's
[1:32:30] Satan's a man and he's got you get there
[1:32:35] again he's it's got my my Trinitarian
[1:32:38] baptism in fact of the matter is if you
[1:32:41] want to go back to it for a moment the
[1:32:43] Roman Catholic Church will tell you it's
[1:32:45] their baptism and said anyone baptized
[1:32:49] in the titles of Father Son and Holy
[1:32:51] Ghost is baptized into the Catholic
[1:32:53] Church because it's their baptism
[1:33:00] the Trinity formula was not even
[1:33:02] developed as 300 and some years after
[1:33:04] after the disciples everywhere in the
[1:33:08] Bible everybody used the name of Jesus
[1:33:10] Christ cuz it's the only name given
[1:33:13] among men whereby we must be safe there
[1:33:17] is no salvation and any other name but
[1:33:23] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:25] what are you doing word or deed you got
[1:33:27] to do it in the name of Jesus like I
[1:33:30] said and the water baptism is a part of
[1:33:33] salvation he that believeth and they're
[1:33:35] baptized shall be saved that's a part of
[1:33:37] salvation and the Bible said that his
[1:33:40] name is the only name given among men
[1:33:42] whereby we must be saved
[1:33:47] that right so you can say but he still
[1:33:51] has my baptism and he hasn't come to a
[1:33:55] full birth he's still just a child there
[1:34:00] is there is Ayaka
[1:34:02] you know you can't hand him the
[1:34:04] possession of the land because he's not
[1:34:07] an age wesley would long to look to
[1:34:13] deliver all nature and he longed for a
[1:34:16] rapture in his age Wesley had he tried
[1:34:19] to claim the book the accuser would have
[1:34:22] also said well I also got a claim on
[1:34:25] Wesley though he is sanctified and more
[1:34:29] qualified than Lutzer and a little more
[1:34:31] grown-up than Luther he still he's still
[1:34:36] not a full born son he's not a beige to
[1:34:39] claim it besides he still sprinkles and
[1:34:43] he's got my false baptism and he's he's
[1:34:46] not the the fullness of the word and
[1:34:49] it's not not even time yet to deliver
[1:34:52] all nature he's not of age so you know
[1:34:56] here we come down to this last age and
[1:34:58] the call goes out who is worthy and John
[1:35:02] saw no man was worthy so all of the all
[1:35:08] the efforts of all the ages had not
[1:35:11] produced and worthy man but then the
[1:35:15] hour arrives the lamb the one who
[1:35:18] started the process of redemption he
[1:35:21] steps Lord from eternity and he takes
[1:35:24] the book he is worthy amen Satan has no
[1:35:30] claim on him Amen well this is why he
[1:35:37] would say we've not the Lion of the
[1:35:40] tribe of Judah has prevailed what the
[1:35:45] lion the king has prevailed how did the
[1:35:50] king do this and then the one on the
[1:35:53] throne became a man for the purpose of
[1:35:58] redemption to be the Lamb of God to take
[1:36:02] away the sin of the world and so the
[1:36:04] lion became the lamb were you with me
[1:36:08] now hey man another words he became the
[1:36:11] all his own sacrifice he became the
[1:36:15] attorney a man and he became the
[1:36:20] atonement himself and he would bear in
[1:36:25] his body the sins of the world he would
[1:36:28] bear your sins he would bear my sins he
[1:36:33] would also be wounded and stripes given
[1:36:37] to him for your healing man if you're
[1:36:41] wondering about your healing this
[1:36:42] morning all you have to do is look at
[1:36:44] the atonement and there is healing and
[1:36:47] salvation it's a dual atonement hey man
[1:36:52] yeah I know I know that healing is
[1:36:54] Amanar not a major the major is to get
[1:36:57] people saved
[1:36:58] but 86% of Jesus ministry was divine
[1:37:03] healing so it's not too minor is it it
[1:37:08] was still a major thrust
[1:37:10] of his ministry to see that not only was
[1:37:13] the body healed but the soul was saved
[1:37:18] it's all in the atonement how many's
[1:37:21] with me
[1:37:21] a man he was wounded for your
[1:37:24] transgressions he was bruised for your
[1:37:27] iniquities the chastisement of your
[1:37:29] peace was upon him and with His stripes
[1:37:32] you were healed remember it is a
[1:37:36] finished work Jesus has to do nothing
[1:37:40] more he has finished the work is that
[1:37:44] right amen all you got to do is claim it
[1:37:50] now so again he hears a cry
[1:37:53] we've not Jonathan euro beer we because
[1:37:56] no man is worthy but look the lion the
[1:37:59] king hath prevailed to take the book and
[1:38:04] he goes to look to see what the king is
[1:38:07] doing and he sees a lamb Alleluia now
[1:38:13] the lamb takes the book he does it as
[1:38:19] kinsman redeemer God become kinfolk to
[1:38:24] you it's in the hands of a man again not
[1:38:27] no woolly lamb but a man Jesus John
[1:38:32] hears that the line is prevailed
[1:38:34] remember the line is a symbol of the
[1:38:37] king and he looks and he sees around
[1:38:40] which the lamb is is a symbol of the
[1:38:44] sacrifice atonement the priesthood hey
[1:38:48] man now Jesus was he's not only the
[1:38:51] lament he is the high priest and man he
[1:38:55] is the blood all of what was represented
[1:38:57] for the atonement Jesus is so wrapped up
[1:39:01] are encapsulated in him as high priest
[1:39:03] it is it is the sacrifice it is the
[1:39:08] blood for the atonement it is
[1:39:10] appeasement for sin now listen what
[1:39:13] happened I'll judge the King on the
[1:39:16] throne became our attorney
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:20] hallelujah someone wanted someone to say

[1:39:25] the lamb who took the book he didn't do
[1:39:29] it as a line he didn't salaam he didn't
[1:39:33] do it as the king of glory he did it as
[1:39:35] the sacrifice so he it was a lamb who
[1:39:41] opened the seals it was the lamb as
[1:39:45] intercessor who is interceding as a man
[1:39:48] with God upon the throne hey man this is
[1:39:55] Melchizedek Melchizedek Melchizedek was

[1:42:53] priest he is an Assessor an attorney to
[1:42:57] represent our case as king upon the
[1:43:00] throne he rules on our behalf and he
[1:43:03] hands the book back to man Christ the
[1:43:07] Redeemer
[1:43:08] not another God the same God yet the
[1:43:15] accuser of the Brethren the prosecutor
[1:43:17] says you're a sinner you're worthless
[1:43:20] you're guilty of death and let me tell
[1:43:24] you that's what the accuser says amen
[1:43:27] because he's trying to say that you're
[1:43:31] not worthy
[1:43:31] he can say that but he can't say it
[1:43:35] about this man a man this man he has no
[1:43:42] claim on him
[1:43:43] there's never come on somebody there was
[1:43:47] there is no claim there is no accusation
[1:43:50] that he could bring against this lamb
[1:43:52] he's without blemish even Pilate would
[1:43:56] have to say I've handled falls in him
[1:43:59] come on and then because he was a lamb
[1:44:02] without blemish
[1:44:06] now the Antichrist spirit has kept a
[1:44:12] rupture from the church for nearly 2,000
[1:44:16] years but sealing away it's true the
[1:44:21] truth from us but I want to announce to
[1:44:25] you that just as there was a sound from
[1:44:28] heaven back on the first Pentecost and
[1:44:32] the second Pentecost that heaven has
[1:44:37] moved on her behalf because it's now
[1:44:42] time for God to bring redemption
[1:44:44] purposes down to earth if I can say it
[1:44:48] like this it's adoption time word that
[1:44:53] there is a maturing elect bride who is
[1:44:55] able to receive the book as shown in
[1:44:58] Revelation 10 8 and have been told go
[1:45:01] and take the little book and there have
[1:45:06] been the unit which is open in the hand
[1:45:08] of the angel would spend of the pond the
[1:45:10] sea and upon the earth so it shows you
[1:45:14] that there comes a time where that that
[1:45:18] the unworthy man John now can go now
[1:45:24] he's representing the bride he's
[1:45:26] representing the elect somebody help me
[1:45:29] revelation 4 he represents the entire
[1:45:33] churches each caught up into heaven at
[1:45:35] the end of the age that right so
[1:45:38] revelation 10 a he represents the entire
[1:45:41] bride as he
[1:45:42] it's this word say go and take the
[1:45:44] little buck that is open in the hand of
[1:45:49] the angel now again the only way that
[1:45:53] that could be that we arrived at that
[1:45:56] time is that there has to come the age
[1:45:59] again on maturity someone who that's not
[1:46:04] a child not as below the age but it's
[1:46:07] our beige that can take the inheritance
[1:46:10] a man where there is a maturing like
[1:46:14] bride who is able to receive the book so
[1:46:17] this is angel adoption where the air
[1:46:19] rise at the stage of maturity we are not
[1:46:24] the immature Lutheran Church we are not
[1:46:28] even the Commons with me we're not even
[1:46:31] that the immature Methodist Church we're
[1:46:36] not even the immature Pentecostal Church
[1:46:41] they were not a book of Acts church they
[1:46:45] were a Corinthian church one has a
[1:46:48] tongue and one as a prophecy and what is
[1:46:51] this and what is that all while sinners
[1:46:53] in the midst but we've got that kind of
[1:46:56] a church hallelujah it is a it is an
[1:47:01] Ephesian Church to where he could say
[1:47:04] you are chosen before the foundation of
[1:47:07] the world
[1:47:08] you have been electric you have been
[1:47:11] called you and the dispensation of the
[1:47:14] fullness of time were that all the times
[1:47:17] are now being wrapped up and finished
[1:47:20] and you are now arrived at an age where
[1:47:24] there is a mature bride on earth a man
[1:47:28] who can take the inheritance now at a
[1:47:36] mature age when childhood was passed the
[1:47:39] Romans who Paul would use this custom
[1:47:42] they had an adult they had a custom
[1:47:45] dedup a mature son or mature man as a
[1:47:50] son that means his adoption meant a son
[1:47:55] was now given power and authority we
[1:48:00] Westerners think of adoption is when we
[1:48:02] adopt a child is not her own but that's
[1:48:06] not what happened
[1:48:07] the Romans had a custom of adoption
[1:48:09] where he adopted his own son and placed
[1:48:13] him in power and authority so adoption
[1:48:18] in the Roman custom was or was to place
[1:48:21] a son born in the house into a place of
[1:48:25] power and authority over his business
[1:48:28] a man so when his son was adopted he was
[1:48:32] given legal rights to act in his
[1:48:36] father's name a man who he hai was hired
[1:48:41] who he fired was fired this and this is
[1:48:45] the age of adoption were sons of God are
[1:48:48] to be revealed and step into their
[1:48:52] rights and this is what you are seeing
[1:48:56] in revelation 10 8 after the transfer
[1:48:59] come on
[1:49:00] from the hand of God to the Lamb who
[1:49:03] sends it down the word down by the Holy
[1:49:06] Spirit a man and the days of the voice
[1:49:10] of the seventh angel when he begins to
[1:49:12] sound his message finish the mysteries
[1:49:14] but it's not enough it's not enough to
[1:49:18] come down with the mysteries it's not
[1:49:20] enough to hand it to a prophet a man for
[1:49:23] him the sound that you must also take it
[1:49:27] become one with it digest it
[1:49:31] let it come on the inside of you or get
[1:49:34] written on the inside of the nature oh
[1:49:37] man it's the coming of the abstract
[1:49:42] where that all the sins of the ages who
[1:49:45] worked out but in order to do that there
[1:49:55] must be a mature elect people to take it
[1:50:01] now and here you him brother branham
[1:50:05] said this I want to take these last
[1:50:06] three words for text here you him and he
[1:50:11] says if we can have obedience to those
[1:50:14] three words you'll see a repeat of
[1:50:17] Pentecost and man if we can get the
[1:50:23] bride just not listening and trying to
[1:50:27] do like Peter a good man
[1:50:29] we'll build a we'll build a tabernacle
[1:50:32] for Moses and we'll build a a tabernacle
[1:50:36] for Elijah we'll build one for you and
[1:50:39] we'll get our eyes off a kingdom
[1:50:41] building for this one in that one and
[1:50:44] we'll go back to hearing him where the
[1:50:49] word has preeminence then he said we'll
[1:50:53] have will see another Pentecost now you
[1:50:57] know why because if we come back to
[1:50:58] adopted sons and here you him it'll be
[1:51:01] receiving the abstract again in other
[1:51:04] words the clear deed and this is why the
[1:51:08] same angel of the Covenant remembers
[1:51:10] this promise and says there will be no
[1:51:12] more delay no more holding back of the
[1:51:16] inheritance the time has come to deliver
[1:51:19] all nature I might give me revelations
[1:51:23] in 6 let's just look at this let me just
[1:51:26] bring it and just go back 1 verse and
[1:51:30] we'll come back to 6 and the angel which
[1:51:33] I so stand upon the sea of all the earth
[1:51:36] lifted up his hand to heaven now this is
[1:51:40] a sworn oath this is God declared with
[1:51:47] an oath they did this favour ham so I
[1:51:52] give this land to you and you're seeing
[1:51:54] and I swam with an out he confirmed it
[1:51:58] with an elf
[1:52:00] come on this is what he was there doing
[1:52:03] on the day of Pentecost he was
[1:52:05] confirming the resurrection and the
[1:52:07] power of God well with the weather no
[1:52:10] the Holy Ghost coming down into
[1:52:13] individuals but I want you to know here
[1:52:16] in Revelation 10 and 5 that he swears
[1:52:19] with an oath are you with me now here
[1:52:25] again is an oath that God cannot go back
[1:52:29] home
[1:52:30] he cannot laugh he cannot back up on his
[1:52:34] promise somebody help me preach them I
[1:52:38] might give me the next verse so let's
[1:52:40] see what it's about
[1:52:41] he swam by him that liveth forever and
[1:52:43] ever that's not a man that there should
[1:52:46] be time no longer this is what he swore
[1:52:53] there will be time no longer now what it
[1:52:56] had been referring to there was a time
[1:52:58] of silence because he said seal up the
[1:53:04] things of the seven bettors uttered this
[1:53:06] in the verses before and he told me
[1:53:09] there's a time was going to be silence
[1:53:12] it's going to be sealed you're not going
[1:53:16] to know it but in the days of the voice
[1:53:20] of the seventh angel verse 7 when he
[1:53:23] said being began the sound the mystery
[1:53:26] of God should be finished by man as he
[1:53:31] had declared to his servants the
[1:53:33] prophets I want you to get this thought
[1:53:34] God has sworn with an oath that time
[1:53:40] will be no longer what time time to hold
[1:53:44] the mysteries back time to keep the book
[1:53:48] seal there's a time of its sealant and
[1:53:52] there's a time of its opening
[1:53:54] but yet he swears I will not leave it
[1:53:58] closed forever but I'm gonna open it hey
[1:54:03] man and I'm going to do it in the days
[1:54:05] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:54:07] the last messenger when there comes
[1:54:10] another Pentecost a man and it'll be a
[1:54:14] trumpet angels sounded out a message are
[1:54:18] you with me it's a ram's horn that is
[1:54:20] being blowed and it's a jubilee and it
[1:54:24] says we can return every man back to our
[1:54:26] possession we can go back to the book of
[1:54:29] Acts we can go back to what the Turks
[1:54:32] lost we can go back to total restoration
[1:54:35] and I'm given you in this age of promise
[1:54:39] but no matter how long it carries and
[1:54:42] how long it waits that delay is over
[1:54:50] hallelujah I want to get into your heart
[1:54:53] this morning that delay is over the time
[1:54:57] for holding back is over the time for
[1:55:01] you to be out of your possession is over
[1:55:04] the time for you to be a slave to some
[1:55:08] system of man is over hallelujah the
[1:55:13] delay is over we've waited for years and
[1:55:16] years and years and years and seven
[1:55:19] Church ages since the Passover at
[1:55:22] Calvary but now the day of Pentecost had
[1:55:25] fully come and the delay is over you
[1:55:36] don't have to wait any more
[1:55:39] we're not in a time of waiting we're in
[1:55:42] a time of fulfillment even you and your

[1:58:38] glorious coming back come on man we got
[1:58:44] a sign here among us of a little girl
[1:58:46] who was who was bald and lost all her
[1:58:50] hair and her glory was Kagome but God
[1:58:54] has given you a foretaste hey man it's a
[1:58:57] witness usually brother Tim you're
[1:58:59] grasping at straws well what are you
[1:59:02] grasping at a man you think it's just
[1:59:05] straws
[1:59:05] he wasn't just a straw it was a whole
[1:59:08] head full of hair not straws and the
[1:59:13] glory returned
[1:59:15] hallelujah I believe the glory is
[1:59:17] returning to the bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:59:20] believe there's a Samson owner who's
[1:59:23] who's gluing a new crop of hair amen the
[1:59:26] people who are now about to display the
[1:59:29] very power of God hallelujah sometimes
[1:59:42] you know we don't know where our paths
[1:59:44] will take us but brother rod was talking
[1:59:51] to me about the other day about the
[1:59:54] peripheral vision being gone and doctors
[1:59:57] doing an operation maybe losing his
[2:00:03] sight well he didn't lose the sight but
[2:00:10] nevertheless he was talking to me about
[2:00:12] it and I said hey okay if you lose your
[2:00:17] sight yeah that would be awful but let
[2:00:20] me just tell you that doesn't take away
[2:00:23] from our God who is the restorer of
[2:00:26] sight and there's nothing too hard for
[2:00:30] the Lord a man you say well brother Tim
[2:00:35] you're really trying hard to believe I I
[2:00:37] don't find it hard to believe sorry I
[2:00:41] don't find it hard to believe that God
[2:00:43] is God and he's still the healer and it
[2:00:47] shows with infallible proofs over and
[2:00:49] over again that he's alive a man that he
[2:00:54] is not dead but he's alive are you with
[2:00:57] me
[2:00:57] a man soul so again again you know the
[2:01:00] time has come to deliver all nature
[2:01:04] we're right here in the our part the
[2:01:07] message here you him brother branham
[2:01:10] gives example of that he said his son
[2:01:12] became a certain age he took the son out
[2:01:16] and adopted him our positionally placed
[2:01:19] him said that word adopt gets you
[2:01:22] confused just think positionally placed
[2:01:24] so you had a son born in the canada in
[2:01:27] his household
[2:01:28] but when he come on age he's
[2:01:30] positionally placed he's a age to handle
[2:01:35] the father's business and operate in the
[2:01:38] father's name and of course he was there
[2:01:43] but he was tutored from through time
[2:01:47] until he comes of age and then he
[2:01:51] reversed he says this Pentecostal church
[2:01:53] has had 51 years of growth and then he
[2:02:00] says why aren't we of age and then I'm
[2:02:04] gonna say as we're standing here on 54
[2:02:09] years since the seventh angel finished
[2:02:11] sounding his message
[2:02:12] why aren't we of age because the Holy
[2:02:19] Spirit is to bring the message that we
[2:02:22] broke our selves up in denomination and
[2:02:25] drawed fences across it cutting in with
[2:02:28] the world and living like the world
[2:02:30] prayer meetin is gone and old-fashioned
[2:02:33] services is gone that's why we're not
[2:02:36] where we should be and that's exactly
[2:02:39] why the people won't stay placed and I'm
[2:02:45] just going to say this is this is
[2:02:47] exactly his message and the greatest
[2:02:50] battle ever fought what he built his
[2:02:53] whole sermon on was the backdrop of the
[2:02:56] universe as he looked into the heavens
[2:02:59] and he says that stars are those stars
[2:03:04] have stayed in orbit since God hung them
[2:03:08] in the sky and they're God's army and
[2:03:11] they're you know again the moon moves
[2:03:15] and the tide comes in and out the Sun
[2:03:17] comes and gives us energy upon the earth
[2:03:20] he said all that the sons of God that
[2:03:25] they are represented will stay steady
[2:03:28] like the heavens when we see trouble
[2:03:33] coming we see problems upon the earth we
[2:03:37] see sickness we see trials
[2:03:40] are you with me it's that time you've
[2:03:42] got to stand steady be still and know
[2:03:48] that I'm God but don't don't go run
[2:03:52] around cast a bow
[2:03:54] don't let your faith drop and hain't
[2:03:57] worry and all this just stay steady now
[2:04:02] but without castigated reminder a triple
[2:04:06] minded or blaming anyone I don't believe
[2:04:10] we have yet realize the full potential
[2:04:13] of what this message is to bring the
[2:04:18] book was open what was it to bring it
[2:04:21] was to open up the full inheritance I've
[2:04:27] seen a you know some camping down on
[2:04:29] parts and the neglecting of other parts
[2:04:32] we've learned mechanics of theology and
[2:04:35] we know it in theory but we're often
[2:04:37] lacking the dynamics of the fire of it
[2:04:40] we have a Church's set in order we got
[2:04:43] nice buildings we have educated people
[2:04:46] to understand doctrine we've had great
[2:04:49] teaching but we need an igniting of this
[2:04:52] truth in our lives now that ought to be
[2:04:57] the cry of every believer this morning
[2:04:59] Lord you packed me full of the word but
[2:05:03] I'd need an igniting of its truths in my
[2:05:07] life a man now of course when this when
[2:05:11] this would be a ceremony that that they
[2:05:15] would have in the Roman days of son
[2:05:17] after that ceremony he would have the
[2:05:20] same authority to write a check as his
[2:05:23] dad did if he fired a man he was fired
[2:05:26] to be hired a man he was hired Jesus
[2:05:29] said whosoever sins Yoram it is
[2:05:31] permitted and whatever you bind on earth
[2:05:33] i bind in heaven what you loose on earth
[2:05:36] i loosed in heaven remember in the
[2:05:39] church is the power of binding and
[2:05:42] loosing the right that's the power of
[2:05:45] God's church how do we remit sin don't
[2:05:49] come by magic one of a preacher comes by
[2:05:52] you repenting
[2:05:53] and then being baptized in the name of
[2:05:56] Jesus Christ and your sins are a minute
[2:05:58] so you can receive the Holy Ghost but he
[2:06:01] said we we say this the same face we're
[2:06:03] sort of that because the church has
[2:06:05] drawn division and lines and so forth
[2:06:08] and except for other things instead of
[2:06:10] staying with God's love and the Holy
[2:06:13] Spirit and the Bible he said look he has
[2:06:17] predestinated us on to disinheritance I
[2:06:20] want you to know you have been our
[2:06:23] dangers like more decay I told Esther he
[2:06:27] says he said that you know you have come
[2:06:30] into the kingdom for this time and I
[2:06:36] want you to know you have been
[2:06:37] predestinated for this age God show you
[2:06:42] before the world and he chose you for
[2:06:45] this time you could have been born in
[2:06:48] Luther's time you've gotta been born in
[2:06:51] Wesley's time but God saw to that you
[2:06:54] would come in this day of this hour that
[2:06:57] this is your time are you with me cuz he
[2:07:01] has predestinated you to inheritance
[2:07:07] others have remained like a child but
[2:07:10] your people in predestined to an
[2:07:13] inheritance a man he said if I'm right a
[2:07:17] heritance is something God knocking at
[2:07:20] my heart saying William Branham I called
[2:07:22] you a long time before the foundational
[2:07:24] world had preached the gospel I have an
[2:07:26] inheritance and inheritance of eternal
[2:07:29] life now Jesus to make that inheritance
[2:07:32] real to me because there was nothing I
[2:07:33] could do to inherit it it was blank it
[2:07:35] was valid there's nothing I could do but
[2:07:37] in the fullness of time God sin in his
[2:07:40] own good time Jesus a lamb slain before
[2:07:42] the foundation of the world his blood
[2:07:45] was shed that I might go to my
[2:07:46] inheritance to be what what inheritance
[2:07:50] to sonship to be a son of God now we're
[2:07:55] not we're not ordained to be a prophet
[2:07:57] or the seventh angel but we are your
[2:08:01] danger in inheritance and that is
[2:08:04] inheritance of sonship
[2:08:06] and he said now this may choke you to
[2:08:09] death but do you know that men are sons
[2:08:11] of God or amateur gods how many never
[2:08:15] knew that how many of you know Jesus
[2:08:17] said so the Bible said Jesus said
[2:08:20] they're not your law see itself that you
[2:08:22] are gods and if you call them gods which
[2:08:24] God said in Genesis 2 that they were
[2:08:26] gods and because they had full dominion
[2:08:29] over the Dominion of the world he gave
[2:08:31] him dominion over all things and he lost
[2:08:34] his God ship
[2:08:35] he lost his sonship he lost his domain
[2:08:38] Satan took it over but brother we are
[2:08:43] waiting for the manifestations of the
[2:08:45] sons of God who will come back and take
[2:08:48] it over again waiting for the fullness
[2:08:50] of time when the pyramid gets up to the
[2:08:52] top were this when the sons of God will
[2:08:56] be when the full sons of God will be
[2:08:59] manifested and the power of God will
[2:09:01] walk out hallelujah and take every power
[2:09:04] that Satan's got away from him
[2:09:08] hallelujah now when we hear brother let
[2:09:12] him talk about the pyramid as he said we
[2:09:15] don't believe in some pyramid doctrine
[2:09:17] some mystic spiritualism that's
[2:09:20] associated with the priam pyramid
[2:09:22] he was just illustrating the workings of
[2:09:25] the gospel from the first stage to now
[2:09:27] starting at the base working upward with
[2:09:30] each age getting narrower so we're in
[2:09:33] the seventh age and now we're beyond the
[2:09:35] Xu's of street with nothing left but the
[2:09:40] capstone to come which is Jesus Christ
[2:09:43] now that capstone can come to you
[2:09:46] individually as the Holy Ghost
[2:09:48] see you to the day of redemption oh man
[2:09:51] the capstone revelation comes were the
[2:09:54] prandtl revelations our attitude to
[2:09:56] church finishing the mysteries of God
[2:09:58] and we have received that remember we as
[2:10:02] of all the body of believers are coming
[2:10:05] to another headstone are you with me and
[2:10:09] that headstone is the coming of Jesus
[2:10:11] Christ Himself to unite with his church
[2:10:16] and take that church in a rapture amen
[2:10:19] so even so there has to be a bride or
[2:10:22] people on earth to match the coming
[2:10:26] capstone or body of believers to take
[2:10:29] ever power that Satan has away from them
[2:10:33] this Christ did and he waits Jesus waits
[2:10:36] expectantly for every enemy to be made
[2:10:39] his footstool hallelujah he did that in
[2:10:43] Christ but now it must be done in his
[2:10:46] body come on hey man listen this is what
[2:10:51] Jesus is expect the Bible said he sits
[2:10:53] in the heavens and he waits for every
[2:10:57] enemy to be brought under his feet I
[2:11:01] wonder what trophy when you bring this
[2:11:03] morning
[2:11:04] oh man every one of you who ought to be
[2:11:07] bringing Maria a trophy
[2:11:09] here's another demon then I'm bringing
[2:11:13] laying at your feet because you said
[2:11:16] every enemy what happened be brought
[2:11:18] under your feet come on here's a here's
[2:11:22] alopecia we bring that under your feet
[2:11:25] here's cancer we bring it under your
[2:11:27] feet a man hears this situation we bring
[2:11:30] it under your feet here's a lost
[2:11:32] childhood we bring it under your feet
[2:11:34] everything has to be brought under his
[2:11:37] feet and he is very expecting you to do
[2:11:42] it the Bride of Christ
[2:11:47] a man who will come bringing their enemy
[2:11:53] put him there before you for his feet
[2:11:56] here's another one here's another trophy
[2:11:59] of the blood a man here's another trophy
[2:12:03] of the but what's now Romans 8:15 we'll
[2:12:07] bring it to a close here in a moment but
[2:12:09] in Romans 8:15 for you have not received
[2:12:11] a spirit of adoption again to fear but
[2:12:15] you have received the spirit or the
[2:12:19] spirit about a bondage again to fear but
[2:12:21] you received a spirit of adoption and
[2:12:23] that is the spirit of adult son
[2:12:26] you have received the spirit that is to
[2:12:31] bring you into a adult sonship whereby
[2:12:35] we cry Abba Father which that's a term
[2:12:38] of endearment my daddy
[2:12:42] halleluiah received the spirit of
[2:12:44] adoption the spirit of adult sonship
[2:12:49] whereby we called him father a man what
[2:12:54] verse 16 and the spirit itself bears
[2:12:56] witness with our spirit that we are the
[2:12:59] children of God
[2:13:01] verse 17 what's now and if we're
[2:13:04] children then heirs and we're heirs of
[2:13:07] God and joint-heirs with Christ if so
[2:13:10] that we suffer with him that we may be
[2:13:13] also glorified together and somebody
[2:13:17] with me there so we're a child we're now
[2:13:19] and if we ran and we're heir of God and
[2:13:23] we're enjoying our with Christ and then
[2:13:27] this is what he's doing he's sharing he
[2:13:30] is sharing the book man he has given you
[2:13:34] the inheritance as a child of God
[2:13:37] because we have received the spirit of
[2:13:40] sonship bringing us into maturity now I
[2:13:44] want to I want to look at this verse a
[2:13:45] little closer because we need to look at
[2:13:48] this verse a little little closer
[2:13:51] yeah we're to suffer - oh yeah we live
[2:13:57] in this life and we know we suffer
[2:14:00] because of it and I would you to think
[2:14:04] you get blow after blow after blow but I
[2:14:08] don't mean that in every bow he doesn't
[2:14:10] come back and bring a way of escape
[2:14:12] don't provide healing come on
[2:14:16] a man and we suffer and then suffering
[2:14:20] we know we develop character that we we
[2:14:23] need in order to reign right amen but I
[2:14:27] want you to look at this a little closer
[2:14:30] because not only do we suffer in that
[2:14:32] manner but we have our suffering
[2:14:35] vicariously in Christ
[2:14:38] so the reason we can reign with him is
[2:14:42] because he suffered for our sins the
[2:14:46] reason we can walk in freedom and and
[2:14:48] healing this morning is because he
[2:14:50] suffered by our healing so if we
[2:14:54] acknowledge we suffer with him a man
[2:14:58] that he paid our price we can have
[2:15:01] salvation or we can have healing
[2:15:04] salvation for the body or sub-basin for
[2:15:07] the soul because if we suffer with him
[2:15:10] we reign with him hallelujah how many
[2:15:14] can look in Christ and say I was in him
[2:15:17] a man I was in him and he separate from
[2:15:21] me and I suffer with him therefore I
[2:15:24] reign with him and because he
[2:15:26] resurrected and resurrected hallelujah a
[2:15:31] man because he rose I raised with him so
[2:15:35] I can raise fry up and over sin over
[2:15:38] sickness over any problem because if I
[2:15:41] suffer with that I reign with him now
[2:15:45] and since we are his through children we
[2:15:48] qualify to share in all his treasures
[2:15:54] and when we were heirs of God himself
[2:15:57] don't let this go over your head because
[2:16:00] we are his true children how many is a
[2:16:03] true child of God a man then we are
[2:16:06] qualified to share in his treasures and
[2:16:11] if we're we are heirs of God himself
[2:16:15] and since we're joined to Christ we are
[2:16:19] also inherent all that he is and all
[2:16:22] that he has and so we experience being
[2:16:27] Co glorified with him provided we accept
[2:16:31] his sufferance as our own so when you
[2:16:36] when you there again when you accept his
[2:16:40] sufferance as your own and you say he
[2:16:44] suffered for my sins then you receive
[2:16:47] his glory of the Holy Ghost that glory
[2:16:51] five European hallelujah and quickens
[2:16:54] you to the Word of God and the same
[2:16:57] thing happens for your healing when you
[2:16:59] realize I suffered with him I don't have
[2:17:03] to suffer anymore he paid the price my
[2:17:08] suffering is over I can stand it be
[2:17:10] filled
[2:17:12] hallelujah why because by I am glorified
[2:17:15] with him that is he raised I raised just
[2:17:20] as he raised then triumph over sin I can
[2:17:23] triumph over soon as he triumph over
[2:17:25] sickness I can triumph over sickness so
[2:17:29] my soul is saved when I realize that
[2:17:31] except that he paid for my sin that I
[2:17:35] don't need to suffer for my sin I accept
[2:17:40] his death for my own I accept his
[2:17:43] suffering for my own for my sins and for
[2:17:48] my sickness now look at verse 18 for I
[2:17:52] reckon the sufferings of this present
[2:17:54] time are not compared to be worthy to be
[2:17:59] compared with the glory which shall be
[2:18:00] revealed in us for the earnest
[2:18:02] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[2:18:05] the manifestation of the sons of God for
[2:18:07] the creature was made subject to vanity
[2:18:10] not willingly but by reason of him who
[2:18:13] subjected the same as in Hope because
[2:18:16] the creature itself also should be
[2:18:18] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[2:18:20] into the glorious liberty of the
[2:18:23] children of God but we know that the
[2:18:25] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[2:18:26] in pain together under now and not only
[2:18:30] they but ourselves also which how they

[2:22:09] creation as it were in the contractions
[2:22:13] of Labor for childbirth and it's not

[2:26:47] positionally placed in the kingdom of
[2:26:50] God before those horrible plagues strike
[2:26:53] oh how good the dispensation of the
[2:26:56] fullness of time we've obtained them
[2:26:58] inheritance being predestinated now

[2:27:15] you we're seeing pre-tribulation plagues
[2:27:17] already striking the earth look what has
[2:27:21] happened and look at the scare that's in
[2:27:23] our nation you say well it's real it's
[2:27:28] not real its fake news it's real news we
[2:27:30] don't know - because right honest we
[2:27:34] don't have we we don't have a good
[2:27:36] handle on our news stop markets going
[2:27:39] crazy losing thousands of dollars
[2:27:41] crashing you know almost twenty thirty
[2:27:45] thousand dollars on couple hundred
[2:27:47] thousand a dollar portfolio just
[2:27:50] crashing down lose
[2:27:51] money here again losing value at least
[2:27:55] here again fierce all kinds of things
[2:28:00] that are coming here above the earth
[2:28:02] weary in the end time is that right amen
[2:28:06] but let me tell you something there is a
[2:28:08] seal of God that God promised to put
[2:28:13] upon his people and also a power that is
[2:28:16] within them to cast Satan out that when
[2:28:20] he attacks and it must be a people in
[2:28:22] this last day that know their God who
[2:28:25] does exploits are you with me here
[2:28:28] listen brother Branham in accepting
[2:28:30] God's plan provided way at the end time
[2:28:32] and he said some of them said well now
[2:28:35] to bleed false we'll just go in the
[2:28:37] hospital if the black happens of all you
[2:28:39] know what we'll do we'll go get dr.
[2:28:41] Jones he'll know how to take care of it
[2:28:43] it didn't work there was smart well if
[2:28:46] the plague falls we just go down beneath
[2:28:47] the ground and a cave shut the door that
[2:28:50] won't do one bit of good we'll stay at
[2:28:52] home put a mask over our face and put
[2:28:55] some disinfectant it didn't do a bit of
[2:28:57] good god made a provided way yes and it
[2:29:01] was what the blood God provided it as
[2:29:05] simple as it seemed to take the blood of
[2:29:07] the Lamb and sprinkled the door yet God
[2:29:10] said he his way that was his way and he
[2:29:13] honored it and all that was out from
[2:29:15] under the blood dad the first boy are
[2:29:19] you with me now Church it is time now
[2:29:22] that we realize we've got to be under
[2:29:25] the blood and that's the Holy Ghost and
[2:29:28] the blood death cancels all the sin
[2:29:31] death and gives you an abstract that
[2:29:34] your debt is paid and that you got a
[2:29:38] free pass and that you can take your
[2:29:40] token and display it and wave it in the
[2:29:44] face of the devil
[2:29:46] and say you can't cross over that's
[2:29:49] token you can't cross over that's black
[2:29:53] because he said when I see the blood
[2:29:55] I'll pass over you it's time like never
[2:30:02] before we put stress on the dynamics and
[2:30:05] not just the mechanics because mechanics
[2:30:10] is not gonna work
[2:30:11] it's going to take the dynamic power of
[2:30:14] the Holy Ghost working in the church or
[2:30:17] people who is a mature church who knows
[2:30:19] how to take that word and use that soul
[2:30:21] and bring it against the enemy
[2:30:27] that's what brother Branham said we put
[2:30:31] too much stress on mechanics we hadn't
[2:30:34] put enough stress on the dynamics people
[2:30:38] are worried it gets the same brother Tim
[2:30:41] aren't you putting too much stress on
[2:30:43] the dynamics I'm gonna tell you friends
[2:30:47] it's time to put stress on it we need
[2:30:51] the life of the resurrection not just to
[2:30:53] talk of the resurrection car can be full
[2:31:03] of the best gasoline in the world and
[2:31:06] without a spark it'll never leave the
[2:31:08] drive we can be chock-full of all the
[2:31:12] word know the Bible inside not be a
[2:31:15] walking quote book but without the
[2:31:18] dynamics to make it work it might as
[2:31:21] well be water
[2:31:28] we can have all the professions of faith
[2:31:31] might even be in a gasoline can might be
[2:31:34] in a collection of tapes or books it
[2:31:38] might all be right on the label but
[2:31:41] unless there's some dynamics to make it
[2:31:43] work in your life it might as well be
[2:31:45] water we have an abstract of title
[2:31:50] that's been given us it's an open book
[2:31:55] what was closed what was hidden what was
[2:31:57] veiled another ages is now open to you
[2:32:02] the land is yours the Covenant is the
[2:32:06] deed to the land but the enemy that
[2:32:09] possesses it and claims it must be
[2:32:13] struck off today you're getting your
[2:32:18] getting a reminder we're in a Jubilee
[2:32:20] you get a reminder this is a day of
[2:32:23] freedom you're getting a reminder you
[2:32:27] don't have to be a slave any longer you
[2:32:30] got a reminder this is a day that we can
[2:32:33] receive the Holy Ghost just like they
[2:32:35] did 2,000 years ago not a portion not a
[2:32:38] part not just a justification or
[2:32:40] sanctification or a tongue of it but the
[2:32:43] person himself to come and feel your
[2:32:45] life and write his nature in your life
[2:32:53] power has some musicians come
[2:33:01] I want you to think on this it's more
[2:33:07] than a deed it's more than just having a
[2:33:14] promise it's knowing that everything
[2:33:17] against you has been struck off I
[2:33:22] believe that God sent a prophet in this
[2:33:24] day an hour with a message to turn our
[2:33:28] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[2:33:31] strikes and cancels the debts of the
[2:33:34] past ages there's no claim on us his
[2:33:43] rapture hour is wrapped her time he just
[2:33:49] say waiting for each one of you to
[2:33:50] personally receive that abstract in your
[2:33:53] life not just a promise I got the
[2:33:56] message but an abstract that ever sin
[2:34:02] has been struck off then unbelief is
[2:34:05] gone I want you to just look at your
[2:34:09] life this morning we've got an abstract
[2:34:12] of title where the deed has been
[2:34:14] searched claims against it is settled
[2:34:18] what about your personal property what
[2:34:21] about your personal inheritance what
[2:34:27] about in revealing your name in the book
[2:34:29] is every claim against you been wiped
[2:34:32] off has ever sin been put in the blood
[2:34:37] are you standing before him justified
[2:34:41] that when he sees your name
[2:34:43] there's not even a smudge against it
[2:34:49] [Music]
[2:35:03] why don't you just ask the Lord today
[2:35:05] the Lord come searching my record I
[2:35:12] don't want to stand up there come down
[2:35:16] to the end time and there's a claim on
[2:35:18] my life
[2:35:19] and I got to go through the tribulation
[2:35:21] for more purging but I won't ever claim
[2:35:27] that the devil has on my life taken off
[2:35:30] I want a full surrender I want to be
[2:35:37] able to reach and take every promise I
[2:35:40] don't want to be disqualified by being
[2:35:43] an immature brat I want to be a
[2:35:48] full-fledged born-again child of God who
[2:35:53] I can walk up and say it's my book I can
[2:35:58] walk up and take the book from the hand
[2:36:00] of the angel and then that word will
[2:36:04] become spoken out of my life
[2:36:06] [Music]
[2:36:10] once you ask god there's got to be a
[2:36:13] clear another deed we're gonna take
[2:36:16] communion here in a little bit you can't
[2:36:19] take it with sin in your life and
[2:36:21] unbelief
[2:36:23] [Music]
[2:36:28] if you were just for a moment consider
[2:36:32] your own self view just for a moment
[2:36:37] stand in his presence save Lord wipe
[2:36:41] every sin out of my life every bit of
[2:36:45] unbelief everything that disqualifies me
[2:36:49] if the Bible said if our hearts condemn
[2:36:51] us not we can receive what we ask of him
[2:36:56] that's not a condition that you want to
[2:36:59] be just on the occasion that's the
[2:37:02] condition you want to walk in no
[2:37:05] condemnation you can say there's no
[2:37:08] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[2:37:11] Jesus I'm freed from my past freed from
[2:37:18] my sin and I've got proof
[2:37:22] Who I am as a child of God
[2:37:27] we took him with labour this put it out
[2:37:30] an abstract God's clearing deeds he
[2:37:36] wipes out the false doctrines of the
[2:37:38] past ages to give you a message that is
[2:37:42] pure so there can be a rapture even
[2:37:45] there would be a claim in sobriety he
[2:37:48] wants to take your life and he wants to
[2:37:50] purge you take care of sand and darkness
[2:37:54] every shadow of it he wants to take his
[2:37:57] word and just write it in your heart in
[2:37:59] your nature or that you and the word is
[2:38:03] to say this same pitchers in Revelation
[2:38:07] 10 take the word take it in prophesy let
[2:38:13] it be a life lived out Acts chapter 2
[2:38:18] all his spirit coming down writing into
[2:38:22] the very nature of man changing him in
[2:38:25] his presence would you just say Lord at
[2:38:32] this moment at this moment I look at
[2:38:39] your sufferance and I realize if I
[2:38:43] suffer with you if I count your
[2:38:46] suffering as my own I'll be glorified
[2:38:50] with you resurrected out of death into
[2:38:55] life would you look back and you look at
[2:38:58] him and say
[2:39:01] was his blood sufficient did he pay your
[2:39:05] price can you say the year identified in
[2:39:11] his suffering then be identified in his
[2:39:15] resurrection or you cease from dead
