[23:01] harveing the service for us as he comes.
[23:04] want to ask you to remember to continue
[23:07] to pray for brother Ben Coleman. He's
[23:09] still at the rehab institute and
[23:13] uh the plan is I believe to have him
[23:15] discharged this week on Thursday. So
[23:18] praying that that'll happen and he'll
[23:20] just continue to receive strength in his
[23:22] body and relief from the pain that he's
[23:24] been having. Also, we have a prayer
[23:26] request from uh brother Paul Burgess who
[23:28] wanted us to remember a friend of
[23:30] theirs,
[23:30] Melissa, who just found out that she has
[23:33] stage four breast cancer and they don't
[23:35] believe that there's any cure that they
[23:37] can treat her with. So, wanted us to
[23:40] pray for not only that need, but also
[23:42] her
[23:44] salvation. We also have a prayer request
[23:46] that we just uh received for Sister
[23:48] Melissa Winters. She and Brother Brandon
[23:50] are on the way to the hospital to check
[23:52] on the baby. She's having some issues
[23:54] with her heart rate, uh, not feeling
[23:57] well, and she's asking us to pray for
[23:59] her as well as the
[24:00] baby. Amen. So, we want to continue to
[24:04] remember each one that's battling
[24:06] cancer, those that are unable to be here
[24:08] for health reasons, those that are
[24:10] traveling away this weekend. Amen. That
[24:12] God would be with them.
[24:16] Brother, God bless you this morning.
[24:18] It's good to be in the house of the
[24:20] Lord. How many would have a need on
[24:22] their heart? You know, I have a need.
[24:26] Our God knows what what that hand was
[24:28] lifted for. He there's nothing he
[24:31] doesn't know about us. So when that hand
[24:34] goes up, I know it's there's faith
[24:36] behind it. And that's what he looks for
[24:38] this morning is your faith. So let's go
[24:40] to him right now. Take these needs
[24:42] before him. Take your need, the one
[24:44] beside you's need. Let's just go to him
[24:47] and ask him to
[24:50] come. Dear Lord Jesus, we come this
[24:53] morning,
[24:55] Father. Lord, we're so grateful that we
[24:58] can come together, Lord, as your people
[25:01] and gather with those of precious like
[25:04] faith, Lord. And Father, to come to
[25:07] hear, Lord, the truth today, Father. How
[25:11] privileged we are, Lord. So we don't
[25:14] take that lightly, Father. But Lord, we
[25:18] come this morning inviting you, Lord.
[25:21] Father, if if you don't come, it would
[25:23] just be another meeting, Lord. And it
[25:25] wouldn't mean anything, Father. But if
[25:27] you come, it changes everything. So we
[25:30] come this morning, Lord. Father, our
[25:34] faith united together. Believe in your
[25:37] word. Whether two or three are gathered,
[25:39] there you'll be in their midst, Father.
[25:43] Lord, we know you're the discerner of
[25:45] the thoughts and
[25:46] hearts. Lord, you saw the hands that
[25:49] were lifted before you. Lord, before
[25:52] there was ever even a speck of dust
[25:54] created, a grain of sand, you knew the
[25:58] hand that was lifted and what the need
[25:59] was. And not only did you know, Father,
[26:03] but you provided for us. So Lord, we
[26:06] come thanking you this morning, Father,
[26:10] that we can have faith in your word,
[26:11] Lord, and believe you, Father. And how
[26:15] grateful we are, Lord, to have a God
[26:17] like that today, Lord, that can meet the
[26:20] needs of these that were read, Lord.
[26:22] Sister Melissa gone to the doctor today,
[26:26] Lord, because of this problem. But
[26:28] Father, you took stripes for her. So we
[26:31] claim that in the name of Jesus right
[26:33] now, Father, that you would come by that
[26:36] room where she is, and you would touch
[26:38] her, Lord. You'd be with our brother
[26:41] Ben, Lord, been in the hospital all this
[26:43] time, Father, the need in his body,
[26:46] Lord. I pray that you would touch him.
[26:49] Lord, that he could go home and all
[26:51] would be well. Lord, you would bring
[26:52] healing, Lord. The doctors can perform
[26:55] surgery and they can do what they can
[26:57] do, Father, but you're the healer. So we
[27:00] look to you for his need this morning,
[27:02] Lord. This one, Brother Paul Burgess,
[27:05] the friend, Lord. Melissa with with a
[27:08] need in her body, Lord. Ne for
[27:11] salvation, Lord. Oh God, we lift her up
[27:14] before you, asking that you would come
[27:16] on the scene, Lord. You would introduce
[27:19] yourself, Lord, as healer to her, not
[27:21] only of her body, but of her soul.
[27:23] Father, we pray. Oh God, come by our way
[27:26] now. We pray. Lord, may you anoint the
[27:29] ministry this morning, Brother Michael,
[27:32] Lord, as he leads us in worship to
[27:34] invite your presence. And then when
[27:36] Brother Tim would come, Lord, use him as
[27:39] an oracle of God to speak to hearts,
[27:41] Lord. We're here, Lord, because we're
[27:44] needy and we need you, Father. We're not
[27:46] like Leodysia saying that we have need
[27:48] of nothing, but we realize our need of
[27:50] you, Lord. And we come this morning,
[27:52] Lord, pouring our hearts out to you,
[27:55] worshiping you, Lord, with all of our
[27:57] heart. May you be welcome in our
[27:59] presence. We pray that you would come by
[28:02] now in Jesus name. Thank you,
[28:06] [Music]
[28:09] Lord.
[28:12] Amen.
[28:14] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Dur was
[28:17] praying for that need for salvation. I
[28:20] thought of many. Amen. That he's just
[28:22] pray that he'll send his spirit down to
[28:24] many that lost loved ones, weward sons
[28:28] and
[28:29] daughters. Amen. I believe that there's
[28:32] a blood that
[28:34] reaches to the
[28:38] highest mountain.
[28:40] [Applause]
[28:43] Oh, and it
[28:45] flows to the
[28:48] lowest
[28:52] valley. And the
[28:55] blood that gives me
[28:58] strength. From
[29:01] day to day, I know we'll
[29:06] never lose.

[29:13] reaches. Oh, it
[29:16] reaches to the
[29:19] highest
[29:24] mountain and it
[29:26] flows to the
[29:30] lowest
[29:32] [Music]
[29:34] valley and the blood.
[29:39] Oh, from
[29:42] day to
[29:44] day, it will
[29:48] never
[29:50] lose its power.
[29:53] [Music]
[29:56] lost or
[29:58] s brothers could take up the offering,
[30:00] find their
[30:01] [Music]

[36:56] Far
[36:58] away stood an
[37:00] [Music]
[37:01] old rugged
[37:05] cross. It's an
[37:08] air of
[37:10] [Music]
[37:12] suffering. Oh, but I could say I love
[37:15] that cross.
[37:17] Oh, I love that old
[37:22] cross where the

[38:13] exchange some
[38:16] of a crown.
[38:19] [Music]
[38:21] And all that
[38:23] old rugged
[38:26] cross so
[38:29] despised by the
[38:32] world has a
[38:35] wondous
[38:37] attraction for me.
[38:43] For the
[38:45] dear lamb of God, he left his
[38:50] glory
[38:52] above. Oh, to bear it to dark
[38:59] [Music]
[39:02] calary. Then I'll
[39:06] carry the old broken cross.
[39:14] Oh, to my
[39:16] throne is at last I lay
[39:24] down. And I will
[39:27] cling to the
[39:30] broken cross.
[39:35] Oh, and
[39:36] exchange it
[39:39] someday for a
[39:44] crown. And get that
[39:48] old rugged
[39:50] cross stained with
[39:53] blood so divine.
[39:57] There's a
[39:58] wonder of
[40:01] spiring I
[40:05] see. For it was
[40:08] on that old cross that Jesus
[40:14] suffered and
[40:17] died to
[40:19] pardon and
[40:21] [Applause]
[40:23] sanctify me.
[40:27] Oh, so I
[40:30] cherish your
[40:33] rough cross.
[40:39] Like
[40:42] trophies that I lay
[40:47] down, I will
[40:50] bring to
[40:53] your rug
[40:58] cross and
[41:00] exchange it
[41:03] some for a crown.
[41:07] [Music]
[41:09] So I'll
[41:10] [Music]
[41:12] clearish the
[41:16] [Music]
[41:23] old at last.
[41:28] [Music]
[41:53] Oh, I
[41:55] love you, Lord.
[42:01] And I
[42:03] live my
[42:08] life
[42:10] to
[42:15] worship you, oh my
[42:22] soul. Oh, take joy. Take joy.
[42:39] Oh, let it be a
[42:49] sweet. Lord, tell him again, I
[42:54] love I
[43:00] love and I lift my
[43:08] voice to worship.
[43:11] [Music]
[43:18] Oh my
[43:19] soul,
[43:22] rejoice and take
[43:26] joy. All taste
[43:30] for what you
[43:35] hear and may be a sweet.
[43:40] [Music]
[43:48] Just before we came out to sing, I was
[43:52] watching a video of a lady with a
[43:55] tracheosttomy and she has a speaking
[43:58] valve. Sounds very
[44:00] mechanical, a digital voice. She was
[44:03] singing this
[44:04] song. And I don't think it's just the
[44:07] voice itself
[44:08] that the Lord wants to hear this
[44:11] morning, but a heart singing I love you
[44:13] Lord. I believe it was I love you Lord
[44:15] that started the Welsh revival of
[44:18] somebody with all of their heart just
[44:19] lifting their voice to them and saying I
[44:21] love you
[44:23] Lord. You may not feel like you have
[44:26] much of a voice this morning but can you
[44:28] just take a moment to give them your
[44:31] heart? Say I love you
[44:34] Lord. Just truly just tell them that.
[44:38] And I lift my
[44:44] voice
[44:46] to worship.
[44:49] [Music]
[44:55] Oh
[44:58] yes. Can you just tell him, Lord, just
[45:01] take joy in the praise I give you.
[45:05] Oh yes,
[45:08] Father.
[45:09] In what you
[45:15] hear, then may it be a
[45:19] sweet,
[45:21] sweet
[45:24] [Music]
[45:25] sound. Oh yes, Lord. Say, "I love you,
[45:29] Lord."
[45:31] hand I
[45:36] love.
[45:39] Oh Lord, I lift my voice.
[45:44] Oh yes father to worship
[45:47] [Music]
[45:50] you. Oh yes father.
[45:54] [Music]
[45:56] Oh my
[45:57] soul
[46:00] rejoice and
[46:03] take
[46:04] [Music]
[46:06] my
[46:11] Oh. Yes.
[46:13] Oh, it may be a
[46:19] sweet. Oh, a sweet sound.
[46:24] I just want to tell you again, Father, I
[46:26] love you, Lord.
[46:29] Oh, I
[46:31] love you,
[46:34] Lord. Yes,
[46:37] Father, I live
[46:40] [Music]
[46:44] my
[46:49] word. Yes.
[46:51] [Music]
[46:53] Oh my
[46:55] soul
[46:57] rejoice and take
[47:00] your
[47:08] [Music]
[47:11] name. Let it be a sweet.
[47:17] Say, "Let it be a
[47:22] sweet." Oh, sing it again now. Say, "Let
[47:26] it be a
[47:29] sweet." Oh yes, Father. Oh, let it be a
[47:34] sweet.
[47:36] [Music]
[47:46] I serve
[47:48] him. The
[47:51] sweeter you
[47:54] grow, the
[47:57] more I love
[47:59] you, the more
[48:04] love. Oh, and each
[48:08] day is like him.
[48:12] My
[48:14] heart
[48:17] overflows the Lord.
[48:21] I
[48:23] serve the
[48:27] sweet.
[48:28] Oh, with the Lord.
[48:34] Can we just all stand together again and
[48:36] sing that song that he
[48:39] grows the
[48:45] more
[48:47] love he
[48:49] bestows and each
[48:53] day is like heaven.
[48:57] My
[48:58] heart
[49:01] overflows and the
[49:04] longer I serve him the
[49:10] sweet. Oh, each
[49:15] day is like heaven.
[49:19] My
[49:20] heart
[49:23] overflows the
[49:27] longer I serve him. The
[49:34] sweeter he gives grace.
[49:38] [Music]
[49:41] Grace,
[49:44] God's
[49:51] grace. Oh, it will
[49:54] cleanse
[49:57] within. Oh,
[50:00] grace,
[50:03] grace,
[50:05] God. Hallelujah. is greater than all my
[50:09] sin.
[50:11] That is
[50:13] greater than
[50:15] all. Oh,
[50:18] give him his
[50:23] praise. Oh, can you just tell them
[50:25] again, I love you, Lord. I lift my
[50:27] voice. I thank you for that grace,
[50:30] Father. It's grace
[50:32] that will
[50:35] pardon and
[50:38] cleans
[50:40] within grace.
[50:43] [Music]
[50:48] God's
[50:52] grace that is
[50:56] greater than
[50:58] all my
[51:02] Lord. We thank you for grace.
[51:05] Grace that is absolutely
[51:08] amazing. the favor on our lives. And you
[51:12] promise, Lord, even grace upon
[51:16] grace, favor upon
[51:18] favor, love upon love, oh God, even an
[51:23] increase of divine love of heaven's
[51:27] atmosphere. Lord, we pray today you will
[51:30] bless us with your presence that you
[51:33] will anoint the word, Lord, as it goes
[51:35] forth. Anoint hearts to receive, oh God.
[51:39] Speak to us Lord. Open our hearts Lord
[51:42] as we come humbly before you Lord. If
[51:46] there is a key to a heart, let us find
[51:51] it so that it can be open.
[51:54] Lord, if there's a need in a life, I
[51:57] pray that there will be a reaching out
[51:58] to you today and saying, Jesus, I need
[52:02] you as you pass by.
[52:05] Lord, we love you and we thank you for
[52:07] your goodness. Asking, Lord, for
[52:10] traveling mercies and grace, Lord, on
[52:12] those that will be traveling home from
[52:14] different places, those who are
[52:17] different away at different places. I
[52:19] pray you'll be with them. But we are,
[52:21] while we are here, Lord, in your
[52:23] presence, I pray, oh God, you'll bless
[52:26] us from heaven. Open up the windows of
[52:30] heaven. Pour out more than what we're
[52:32] able to receive, Father. Lord, let it
[52:35] overflow until it overflows to all
[52:38] around us. Lord, that there would be
[52:41] healing in the church, healing in our
[52:43] midst. God, you know the needs of your
[52:46] children and there are many. But we
[52:49] believe, Lord, not even cancer can stand
[52:51] before our prayers. We believe, Lord,
[52:54] that you are triumphant over every
[52:56] enemy. And we're looking to you today to
[53:00] do exceed and abundantly above that
[53:02] which we're even able to think much
[53:05] longer ask Lord by that which we're able
[53:08] to even think or ask according to the
[53:11] power that works within us. I pray Lord
[53:14] let that power work richly within us
[53:18] today in the name of Jesus. Bring forth
[53:21] exceeding
[53:22] abundantly. I ask it. Father, speak to
[53:25] your children, Lord. Our hearts are laid
[53:28] bare before you. Father, we have looked
[53:32] at passages of scripture today. We've
[53:35] looking at prophecy that is being
[53:38] fulfilled in our midst. I pray, Lord,
[53:40] that today divine uncction will come,
[53:44] Lord, that the spirit will
[53:46] speak to hearing ears and hearts that
[53:50] are able to receive. I ask God that
[53:53] those that come in empty will go away
[53:55] full. Lord, those that came needy will
[53:59] go away with their needs supply. Lord,
[54:02] those that came in sick, may they go out
[54:05] healed, Lord. Those that came out
[54:08] lacking your spirit, go out filled,
[54:11] overflowing. I just give this service to
[54:13] you myself, Lord, as I report for duty.
[54:17] In the name of Jesus, I ask it. Amen.
[54:21] Amen. God bless you. Thank you. God
[54:23] bless you. We so appreciate the Lord and
[54:26] his goodness to us. Amen. Good to see
[54:29] each one of you. And we want to welcome
[54:31] each of you and the wonderful name of
[54:33] the Lord Jesus Christ. And I want you to
[54:36] be turning with me to Matthew chapter 13
[54:39] because it's from there we will read the
[54:41] scripture today as
[54:45] um and u while
[54:47] we're turning there and just thinking um
[54:51] just been getting some reports of the
[54:53] meetings in in um Kentucky and where the
[54:57] spirit of God has just been pouring out
[54:59] floods of his blessings and his glory
[55:02] coming down and we're so thankful for
[55:05] that also I I got a wonderful video clip
[55:09] today. I wish I could show it to you
[55:10] without without um it broadcast around
[55:14] the world because it's of the Chinese
[55:16] believers there and and as the work
[55:20] continues and grows on that we even went
[55:23] here and others did and we blew upon the
[55:26] flames and seeing it is continuing to
[55:29] burn brighter and um the glory of God
[55:32] just coming down. Amen. Uh the meetings
[55:36] there just tremendous is the Lord moving
[55:39] and by his spirit. And you know a lot of
[55:42] times we think about places like China
[55:44] and and Russia and oh our our country
[55:48] here would our government would say well
[55:50] those are our enemies and our rivals and
[55:54] whatever. But I want you to know even in
[55:56] nations like Iran, uh, where maybe we're
[56:00] we look there and consider them as
[56:03] enemies as a nation, I want you to know
[56:06] there are genuine believers there. Amen.
[56:09] And there there are believers there that
[56:12] are suffering even in Ukraine and and uh
[56:15] other different places around the world.
[56:17] And God's got his people. And so you
[56:20] know behind some of those systems that
[56:23] you see and remember there is a horrible
[56:25] system rising up out of America which is
[56:28] a beast according to the scripture and
[56:33] and and it it it's satanic because it'll
[56:36] speak as a dragon. But I want you. But
[56:39] of course, right here underneath all of
[56:42] that or in the midst of all of that, I
[56:44] should say, there is a bride of Jesus
[56:46] Christ as well because God's got a
[56:49] people around the world. So when you
[56:51] think about those places, don't think of
[56:53] them as our enemies. You think of them.
[56:55] There's our precious brothers and
[56:57] sisters that are in need, great need
[57:00] there this morning. And we want to
[57:02] remember them as we as we think of the
[57:05] of the great things that God is doing
[57:07] and the blessings that he has shared
[57:09] with people around the world. I'm glad
[57:12] we're not the only ones going to be in
[57:14] heaven. I'm glad it's going to be filled
[57:17] with people just like us from every
[57:19] nation, kindred, tongue, and people. I'm
[57:21] glad it's not just for the whites or the
[57:23] blacks or, you know, the Europeans or
[57:25] the Asians or what. I'm glad it's for
[57:28] whosoever will. Amen. And God has
[57:31] blessed us together. Matthew chapter 13
[57:34] 24. And as you turn there, um, we're
[57:37] going to be speaking on another great
[57:39] headstone this morning, a great climax
[57:42] in this day. And, of course, it goes
[57:44] with our theme from Zachchariah. Who art
[57:47] thou, oh great mountain? Thou shalt
[57:49] become a plain. and the headstone, the
[57:52] capstone, the finishing stone, the
[57:54] finishing work shall be brought forth
[57:56] with shoutings, crying the favor of God,
[58:01] grace, grace unto it. Matthew
[58:04] 13:24. Another parable putting forth
[58:07] unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
[58:09] is likened unto a man which sowed good
[58:12] seed in his field. And while men slept,
[58:16] his enemy came and swed tears among the
[58:18] wheat and went his way. But when the
[58:21] blade was sprung up and brought forth
[58:23] fruit, there appeared the tears also. So
[58:28] the servants of the householder came and
[58:30] said unto him, "Sir, did thou not sow
[58:33] good seed in thy field? For whence then
[58:35] hath it tears?" And he said unto them,
[58:38] "An enemy has done this?" And the
[58:41] servant said unto him, "Wilt thou then
[58:43] that we go and gather them up?" But he
[58:46] said, "Nay, lest while you gather up the
[58:49] tears, you root up also the wheat with
[58:52] them. Let both grow together." What's
[58:56] these key words? Let both grow together
[59:00] until the harvest. And in the time of
[59:03] the harvest, I will say to the reapers,
[59:06] gather ye together first the tears, and
[59:09] bind them in bundles to burn them, but
[59:12] gather the wheat into my barn. Skip down
[59:15] to verse 36. Then Jesus sent the
[59:18] multitude away, and went into the house.
[59:21] And his disciples came unto him, saying,
[59:24] Declare unto us the parable of the tears
[59:27] of the field. And he answered and said
[59:29] unto them, he that sweth the good seed
[59:32] is the Son of Man. The field is the
[59:36] world, the good seed are the children of
[59:39] the kingdom, but the tears are the
[59:42] children of the wicked one. The enemy
[59:45] that swed them is the devil. The harvest
[59:48] is the end of the world, and the reapers
[59:50] are the angels. As therefore the tears
[59:54] are gathered and burned in the fire, so
[59:58] shall it be in the end of this world.
[1:00:01] Then skip over to all the way to the
[1:00:04] last of the Bible to Revelation chapter
[1:00:06] 14. We'll read a couple of three verses
[1:00:09] there. And I looked, and behold, a white
[1:00:13] cloud, and upon the cloud
[1:00:16] one sat like unto the Son of Man, having
[1:00:20] on his head a golden crown, and his hand
[1:00:24] a sharp
[1:00:25] sickle. And another angel came out of
[1:00:28] the temple, crying with a loud voice to
[1:00:30] him that sat on the cloud, "Thrust in
[1:00:34] thy sickle, and reap, for the time has
[1:00:37] come for thee to reap. For the harvest
[1:00:40] of the earth is ripe. And he that sat on
[1:00:44] the cloud thrust in his sickle on earth
[1:00:49] and the earth was was reaped. God bless
[1:00:53] you. Can be
[1:00:54] seated. We're going to be speaking today
[1:00:56] on completing the harvest cycle. Now,
[1:01:01] the parable of the seed and the swer is
[1:01:04] more than a teaching. It's actually a
[1:01:07] prophecy that stretches from the first
[1:01:10] church age all the way down to the end
[1:01:13] time. And we're no longer in the season
[1:01:16] of planting, but we are now in the time
[1:01:20] of harvest. The rapture anointing is
[1:01:23] already here. It is the call to thrust
[1:01:25] in the sickle and the fields are ripe.
[1:01:28] For we're living in the very hour when
[1:01:31] the tears will be separated and where
[1:01:33] the grain must be gathered in with the
[1:01:37] stalk left behind and the chaff blowed
[1:01:40] away. Now, in order to be a part of the
[1:01:43] rapture and of the first resurrection,
[1:01:46] you must have the quickening power of
[1:01:48] the Holy Ghost dwelling within you
[1:01:51] because no one will be caught away or
[1:01:53] raptured up without it. Romans 8:11
[1:01:56] declares, "But if the spirit of him that
[1:02:00] raised uh up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:02:03] in you, he that raised up Christ from
[1:02:06] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[1:02:09] body by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:02:11] you." And that quickening life is the
[1:02:14] resurrection power. And it alone will
[1:02:17] lift the bride from this earth. Now
[1:02:21] during the long dark seven ages of
[1:02:25] spiritual decline, the original
[1:02:27] Pentecostal experience which was the
[1:02:30] fullness of the Holy Ghost was lost
[1:02:33] beneath centuries of tradition and
[1:02:37] creeds of man. But the true Pentecostal
[1:02:41] experience, the one that fell in the
[1:02:43] upper room, is reserved for the mature
[1:02:46] bride. The saints of the early church
[1:02:49] had it. They were rapture ready. They
[1:02:53] were fully ripened. They were like
[1:02:55] mature wheat in the field and they were
[1:02:57] prepared for harvest. But instead of
[1:03:00] being taken, they were planted. They
[1:03:03] were buried as a seed in the ground. And
[1:03:07] uh so that at the end of the age when
[1:03:10] the gross cycle of the church would come
[1:03:13] its full circle the the same life in
[1:03:16] them would rise again in the end time
[1:03:20] bride. And now in this final hour the
[1:03:24] seed has come to
[1:03:26] maturity and the harvest is now ready.
[1:03:30] Now there are things that are laid in
[1:03:32] the scripture which were you know in
[1:03:35] times past were traditions
[1:03:38] um of of Israel. They were feasts that
[1:03:41] were be kept and they didn't realize
[1:03:43] that they were prophetical in nature.
[1:03:46] But in the Levitical law Moses spoke to
[1:03:50] God spoke to Moses and and everything
[1:03:52] there is a type and a shadow of what was
[1:03:55] to come. And in Leviticus
[1:03:59] 23:9-11, he tells us that as the Lord
[1:04:03] spake to Moses saying, speaking to the
[1:04:05] children of of Israel and say unto them,
[1:04:08] when you've come into the land that I
[1:04:11] have given you. Now notice uh these
[1:04:14] these are very important parts that we
[1:04:17] want to see. That is when you reach the
[1:04:20] place that I promise. When you come to
[1:04:23] the land that I swore to give you, when
[1:04:25] you arrive there, now this is speaking
[1:04:28] at that time naturally, but it is
[1:04:31] pointing to something greater, something
[1:04:33] that is spiritual. And and to the church
[1:04:38] has been on a long journey coming down
[1:04:42] to seven church ages. And just like
[1:04:45] Israel, we also are returning to the
[1:04:49] land of our forefathers. Abraham, Isaac
[1:04:52] and Jacob and of course Peter, James,
[1:04:56] John and Paul. So when you come into the
[1:04:59] land and I want to say we have arrived,
[1:05:02] we are here. Amen. That is fulfillment
[1:05:05] to come into the land for us means we
[1:05:08] have returned back to Paul's gospel
[1:05:11] again. The land represents the Holy
[1:05:14] Ghost. It means we fully possess what
[1:05:18] other ages only had in portion. You see,
[1:05:21] not just in truth or in doctrine, but
[1:05:24] the original experience of the Holy
[1:05:27] Ghost that goes along with the
[1:05:29] restoration of the word. Now, this is
[1:05:33] the land of the Holy Ghost that we have
[1:05:35] arrived at. After 2,000 years of of
[1:05:40] wandering through the wilderness of
[1:05:42] tradition and denominational bondage and
[1:05:46] spiritual drought, we have finally
[1:05:48] crossed over. You see, the seals opened
[1:05:52] it up for us. With the opening of the
[1:05:55] seals, it opened up the lamb of promise
[1:05:59] and the fullness of the Holy Ghost. We
[1:06:02] have journeyed from the upper room at
[1:06:04] Pentecost through the dark valleys of
[1:06:07] the ages. And now we're standing on the
[1:06:10] other side. We are here in the land of
[1:06:14] promise, the land of fulfillment, the
[1:06:17] land where the Holy Ghost reigns without
[1:06:20] measure. Amen. God said when you come in
[1:06:23] the land I that I swore to give you when
[1:06:26] you stand in your inheritance and I want
[1:06:29] to say this is that hour. And if you'll
[1:06:31] keep that scripture up for a little bit,
[1:06:33] you know that this is your hour when you
[1:06:35] come in this land which I give you when
[1:06:38] you stand in your inheritance. And I
[1:06:40] want to say again, this is that hour.
[1:06:43] We're no longer walking by shadows and
[1:06:46] types. This, you see, the book is open.
[1:06:50] The seals have been broken. The mystery
[1:06:53] hidden for seven ages have now been
[1:06:56] revealed. And now it is time. It is time
[1:07:00] to reap the harvest of the land. Amen.
[1:07:04] And I want to say this, this is not just
[1:07:06] another revival. Oh yeah. It is the
[1:07:09] bride's revival, but it's more than a
[1:07:11] revival. This is the end of the world.
[1:07:14] This is the final harvest. The seed that
[1:07:17] was sown at Pentecost has come to its
[1:07:20] full circle. It passed through the blade
[1:07:23] stage in the reformation with Luther's
[1:07:26] message of justification. And then the
[1:07:28] pollen stay and flowering stage of
[1:07:31] Wesley sanctification move and and into
[1:07:34] the husk uh shell stage and the theuza
[1:07:38] Pentecostal age with gifts and
[1:07:41] manifestation. But even as the husk
[1:07:45] wraps around the grain, it is not the
[1:07:47] grain. It looks like it's the real
[1:07:51] thing, but it's not. And that's why
[1:07:54] Jesus warned in Matthew 24:24 that this
[1:07:57] age would be so deceptive that it would
[1:08:01] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:08:04] possible. Amen. Now the Pentecostal age,
[1:08:08] the the
[1:08:10] the age was the shuck stage. It was the
[1:08:14] dry papery and lifeless compared to the
[1:08:18] to the grain. It had form. It had
[1:08:21] feeling. But it didn't have the life of
[1:08:23] the seed in it. It was the protective
[1:08:26] shell, but it wasn't the kernel itself.
[1:08:30] It's important to understand where we
[1:08:32] have come and and the difference of what
[1:08:35] they were and what we are. Because now
[1:08:38] in this final moment, the seed has
[1:08:41] emerged. It's not an imitation. It's not
[1:08:45] the husk, but it's the original grain
[1:08:48] again. The word bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:52] restored to the faith of the valders and
[1:08:54] it's ready for the sickle of the harvest
[1:08:58] to be thrust in.
[1:09:00] We have arrived. We are here. Now in
[1:09:04] this
[1:09:04] stage the shuck or the chaff was thought
[1:09:08] to be the
[1:09:09] grain ends as much as it was actually
[1:09:14] misidentified as return to the original
[1:09:17] Pentecost.
[1:09:20] It was not Pentecost because Pentecost
[1:09:23] and the fullness of the word with the
[1:09:26] fullness of the spirit could only come
[1:09:29] when the prophet messenger of Malachi 4
[1:09:32] came to turn the hearts back to the
[1:09:35] faith of the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:09:37] Nothing else could do it. Amen. Gifts
[1:09:40] and signs and wonders could not turn our
[1:09:42] hearts back to the original faith. It
[1:09:44] would take it would take a an Elijah
[1:09:47] prophet, a prophetic ministry. And but
[1:09:50] you see what seemed to be the answer
[1:09:53] then came as many began to speak in
[1:09:56] tongues and manifest gifts of the
[1:09:58] spirit. And it was then believed this
[1:10:00] was indeed the long awaited restoration.
[1:10:04] And I'm quoting from the church age
[1:10:05] book. It was not for the latter rain can
[1:10:08] only come after the former rain which is
[1:10:11] the spring or teaching rain. The latter
[1:10:14] rain then is the harvest rain. And how
[1:10:18] could this be the real thing when the
[1:10:20] teaching rain had not come? The the
[1:10:22] prophet messenger who was sent to teach
[1:10:25] the people and turn the hearts of the
[1:10:28] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:10:30] had not come. Thus, what was thought to
[1:10:33] be the restoration and the final
[1:10:36] quickening under the rapture had not
[1:10:39] come. But here now we have arrived. It's
[1:10:43] a different stage. It's no longer the
[1:10:46] shock stage. It is now the time for the
[1:10:49] full grain to be ripened and gathered.
[1:10:53] Now, John the Baptist declared that
[1:10:56] after the forerunner delivered his
[1:10:58] message, the Messiah would come
[1:11:01] baptizing not just with water like he
[1:11:04] was doing, but with the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:06] with fire. And this baptism would not be
[1:11:09] a passive experience. It would bring
[1:11:12] separation and purification and
[1:11:15] judgment. He said in Luke 3 and verse
[1:11:18] 16, "He shall baptize you with the Holy
[1:11:22] Ghost and with fire, whose fan is in his
[1:11:25] hand, and he will thoroughly purge his
[1:11:28] floor and will gather the weed into the
[1:11:31] garner, but the chaff he will burn with
[1:11:34] unquenchable
[1:11:35] fire." Now, this is the prophetic
[1:11:39] language of the threshing
[1:11:41] floor. In the ancient time, you see the
[1:11:45] the grain harvest required
[1:11:48] threshing. It was a violent but
[1:11:51] necessary process where the grain was
[1:11:54] beaten or crushed to break it free from
[1:11:57] the stalk. And once it was thrust, the
[1:12:01] grain and the chaff were then thrown
[1:12:03] into the air. And this is called the
[1:12:07] winnowing, allowing the wind to blow
[1:12:10] away the worthless chaff while the
[1:12:12] heavier true grain would fall back down
[1:12:16] the floor and be gathered in into the
[1:12:18] barn.
[1:12:20] And that's where we are in this hour. We
[1:12:23] are on God's threshing floor.
[1:12:26] Hear me now. Amen. And the wind of the
[1:12:29] Holy Ghost is moving and the fan is in
[1:12:32] his hand. And the winds of the spirit
[1:12:35] are blowing through the church. Amen.
[1:12:38] And it's blowing through the nations and
[1:12:40] blowing through every heart. And it's a
[1:12:43] time of the Holy Ghost is winnowing.
[1:12:46] Amen. Where where the real is being
[1:12:48] separated from the false and the genuine
[1:12:51] from the imitation and the grain from
[1:12:54] the husk.
[1:12:56] So it's a great hour that we're in. is a
[1:12:59] very important time and I want you to
[1:13:02] really get a vision and an understanding
[1:13:05] of where we are in the harvest
[1:13:07] cycle because it's prophetical. Just as
[1:13:11] I placed you last Sunday in uh
[1:13:13] Revelation chapter 12 and placed the
[1:13:16] Israel and and the bride and what Satan
[1:13:18] is doing and the beast system and all of
[1:13:20] this, I want you to see your place in
[1:13:23] the harvest cycle where we're at because
[1:13:27] this again is modern events fulfilled by
[1:13:31] prophecy. Amen. Our pro prophecy now
[1:13:36] being fulfilled in these modern events.
[1:13:39] So the chaff everything that has no
[1:13:42] life, no substance, no part of the sea
[1:13:45] will be burned with unquenchable fire.
[1:13:48] Now this can mean and in some for some
[1:13:52] the tribulation period, some others will
[1:13:54] be burnt literally there. They will they
[1:13:57] will go to hell. But the true grain, the
[1:14:01] word bride is being gathered now into
[1:14:05] his garner. They are being made ready
[1:14:08] for the coming of the Lord. This is
[1:14:10] rapture hour. This is the time of
[1:14:12] harvest. This is exactly where we are in
[1:14:16] the time of
[1:14:18] separation. The grain is being separated
[1:14:20] from the stock and the chaff. It's the
[1:14:24] fan in the hand. The movement of the
[1:14:26] spirit that's that's that is doing this
[1:14:30] work. I I want you to understand the
[1:14:32] spirit has to move. Amen. And he said he
[1:14:35] would come after this forerunner and he
[1:14:38] would have a fan in his hand that would
[1:14:41] be of the winds of the spirit moving and
[1:14:44] it would blow through the church in its
[1:14:46] final hour and everything that is not
[1:14:50] true seed will be exposed and blown away
[1:14:54] while the true grain is being gathered
[1:14:56] into the gardener of God.
[1:14:59] What an hour we're living in. Now that
[1:15:02] was the purpose of the seals being
[1:15:04] opened wasn't just to give you some
[1:15:06] knowledge. It was to separate the grain
[1:15:09] from the chaff.
[1:15:12] What was truth from era? You see that
[1:15:15] means to remove the harvestable part.
[1:15:18] Those who are selected from all the
[1:15:20] world to be gathered into the grainery
[1:15:23] and to the garner and to the barn. Now
[1:15:26] this is this age then is the age of
[1:15:30] fullness completion where the Holy Ghost
[1:15:34] is poured out in his fullness. Not a not
[1:15:37] a portion of the spirit release but the
[1:15:41] entire breath of God. The wind of the
[1:15:44] spirit blowing in its fullness bringing
[1:15:48] about a time of separation. It'll
[1:15:50] separate you from sin. It'll separate
[1:15:54] you from religious creeds.
[1:15:57] It will separate you and pull you out of
[1:15:59] denominational systems. Amen. It will it
[1:16:02] will leave you there wi without chap
[1:16:06] around you a pure grain.
[1:16:10] That's where we are now. So that it's
[1:16:13] the age of fullness. And once you reap
[1:16:16] the harvest, once the promise begins to
[1:16:19] manifest, you take the first sheath. Now
[1:16:23] I want you to see this. Ye shall bring a
[1:16:26] sheep. Take the first sheath. The sheath
[1:16:29] was the first
[1:16:31] portion to reach full maturity.
[1:16:36] Now
[1:16:37] watch verse 10 right here tells us when
[1:16:40] you come to this land which I give to
[1:16:43] you and shall reap the harvest thereof
[1:16:45] when you receive what I promise you when
[1:16:48] the seals are open when the mysteries
[1:16:51] are revealed then you shall bring a
[1:16:54] sheath of the first fruits of your
[1:16:56] harvest to the priest and he shall wave
[1:17:00] the sheath before the Lord to be
[1:17:04] accepted for you on the tomorrow after
[1:17:07] the Sabbath, the priest shall wave
[1:17:10] it. Now watch, you will cut down the
[1:17:15] sheath. You will bring it to the priest.
[1:17:18] He waves it before the Lord is a
[1:17:21] sign. The sign is it is signifying the
[1:17:25] rest of the harvest is on its way.
[1:17:29] Hallelujah. And I want you to understand
[1:17:31] in our case, this harvest is going to
[1:17:34] include seven ages for even the dead
[1:17:36] will rise in this harvest.
[1:17:38] Are you with me now? Because you see,
[1:17:41] this is resurrection language.
[1:17:44] It's a resurrection prophesied for the
[1:17:46] wheat that was planted has now come back
[1:17:49] to full maturity again. Amen. And it's
[1:17:52] now the grain. And we have completed a
[1:17:55] cycle. This is true restoration.
[1:18:00] Amen. Pentecost was our origin and
[1:18:03] Pentecost is our destiny. And once we
[1:18:06] res return to the fullness of Pentecost
[1:18:08] in the final outpouring of the spirit,
[1:18:10] we go in a
[1:18:12] rapture.
[1:18:14] Amen. So now I want to step back just
[1:18:17] for a moment. I want to step back and I
[1:18:20] want to look at the big
[1:18:22] picture of the harvest. Not just in our
[1:18:26] time, but let's go back in time of a
[1:18:30] harvest that took place 2,000 years
[1:18:34] ago. And I want you to remember in that
[1:18:36] harvest cycle, there
[1:18:38] was a one to come to maturity. And not
[1:18:42] only that, there was also a resurrection
[1:18:46] of all the saints
[1:18:48] for all the past ages all the way back
[1:18:51] to Eden.
[1:18:53] So now as we look at this picture of
[1:18:55] 2,000 years ago when the first covenant,
[1:18:59] the old covenant came to his full
[1:19:02] completion, that entire covenant, every
[1:19:06] shadow, every promise, every prophet was
[1:19:11] a planting season or part of the growing
[1:19:14] cycle. And it all began as a seed.
[1:19:18] It was first spoken in Eden when God
[1:19:20] promised the seed of the woman would
[1:19:23] crush the serpent's head.
[1:19:26] And that promise took root in the faith
[1:19:29] of Abraham. And it grew through the
[1:19:31] lineage of the patriarchs. It was
[1:19:34] watered in by the law. And it was
[1:19:37] nurtured by the voices of the
[1:19:40] prophets. And where did it all lead? It
[1:19:44] came to a head.
[1:19:46] It all wound up in the harvest of one.
[1:19:52] I want you to get this because that's
[1:19:54] where we come back to the harvest of
[1:19:56] one. One bride.
[1:19:59] One church, one bride.
[1:20:02] And here he was one. The harvest of one
[1:20:04] in the person of Jesus Christ. All of
[1:20:07] the Old Testament headed up in him. He
[1:20:12] was a headstone coming crying grace,
[1:20:14] grace.
[1:20:17] Now he was the fullness of the law and
[1:20:20] the prophets. He was the very embodiment
[1:20:23] of everything in the Old Testament. He
[1:20:27] he was the word made flesh. Literally
[1:20:31] those men, the words, the portions of
[1:20:34] the word that they were living out was
[1:20:36] now embodied and made flesh in Jesus
[1:20:39] Christ.
[1:20:40] So it was not just a part or not just a
[1:20:43] piece but it was the fullness of
[1:20:47] God's revealed word in one man Jesus
[1:20:52] Christ. And I want you to understand the
[1:20:54] same thing happens in the last day. The
[1:20:56] fullness of the word gets made flesh in
[1:20:59] one body. The body of Jesus Christ the
[1:21:02] bride.
[1:21:03] Now Jesus was the first matured ripened
[1:21:08] grain, the finished product of the Old
[1:21:12] Testament harvest. If you listen brother
[1:21:14] Brandham in Christ the mystery he goes
[1:21:17] through this explicitly over and again
[1:21:19] as he as he says he was the prophets he
[1:21:22] was the law he was the song of Solomon
[1:21:24] he was he was the wisdom of Solomon he
[1:21:28] was the psalms of David he was all
[1:21:30] encapsulated in that one man
[1:21:34] so that he was the fullness of the
[1:21:37] godhead in a body
[1:21:40] God's full word now remember this he
[1:21:43] what has done in the groom is gets done
[1:21:44] in the bride. So keep keep the parallel
[1:21:48] going as we as we go along. So he was
[1:21:51] the word made flesh. He was not just a
[1:21:54] part. He was not just a piece, but he
[1:21:57] was the fullness of God's word in a
[1:22:02] man. He was the first matured ripened
[1:22:09] grain. Everyone else was immature.
[1:22:15] Everyone else was only a portion of him,
[1:22:19] but he was the fullness of them all. He
[1:22:22] was the finished product of the Old
[1:22:25] Testament harvest. And according to the
[1:22:28] law, the first fruits had to be waved
[1:22:32] before the Lord as a sign there's more
[1:22:35] coming.
[1:22:37] Hallelujah. And Jesus was that chief
[1:22:40] way. He was lifted up by resurrection
[1:22:44] power as a testimony that a whole field
[1:22:47] of grain just like him would follow.
[1:22:51] Hallelujah. He was not only prophesying
[1:22:54] that they would come from the past, but
[1:22:56] also the future. That there would be a
[1:22:59] grain that would be just like him that
[1:23:01] would follow. His life was the proof.
[1:23:05] His resurrection was the way. And and we
[1:23:09] are the continuation of that harvest, a
[1:23:12] people born of the same seed.
[1:23:16] Amen. We're ripen into the same image
[1:23:18] and we're filled with the same spirit
[1:23:20] and we're ready for the final end
[1:23:23] gathering. So what an hour we're living
[1:23:25] in.
[1:23:27] Tremendous moment we're here. Remember
[1:23:30] now the sheath was symbolic.
[1:23:34] It was a prophetic act for it
[1:23:36] represented Jesus. It was he was the
[1:23:39] first of God's wheat to raise from the
[1:23:42] dead. He was God's first cord of
[1:23:45] wheat. And by God's quickening power, he
[1:23:48] was raised up and waved before the
[1:23:51] people as the first fruits of those that
[1:23:54] slept. Let's look at that. 1 Corinthians
[1:23:56] 15 and 20. But now is Christ risen from
[1:24:00] the dead and become the first fruits of
[1:24:03] them that
[1:24:05] slept. So now the Bible declares him.
[1:24:09] Paul picks up on this and he sees him.
[1:24:12] He's the first
[1:24:13] fruits. We've been waiting for
[1:24:16] centuries ever since Eden for it to come
[1:24:20] back to the seed again.
[1:24:24] Adam was the seed, but he went down into
[1:24:26] the ground and died and it come up down
[1:24:30] and it's grown now through through the
[1:24:32] Old Testament and through the prophets
[1:24:35] and by the law. But now Christ is risen
[1:24:39] from the dead and he is the first fruit
[1:24:43] of all of them.
[1:24:47] Amen. Now this waving of the sheath was
[1:24:51] was an act of faith. It was a
[1:24:53] thanksgiving to God. It was a sign that
[1:24:56] the rest of the harvest would follow.
[1:25:00] And because he came to full maturity, he
[1:25:03] was waved as a guarantee that the rest
[1:25:07] of the seed would come. That just as he
[1:25:09] rose from the dead, there would be a
[1:25:12] resurrection for us. And just as that
[1:25:15] sheep was waved in thanksgiving, it
[1:25:18] believed the rest would come. know that
[1:25:20] Christ was waved over us as a sign that
[1:25:24] the whole harvest is accepted.
[1:25:30] Amen. All the grain is accepted because
[1:25:34] he was accepted. Are you with me,
[1:25:37] church? And as he ascended, it was
[1:25:40] though he waved goodbye. You'll find
[1:25:43] this uh this in it is the rising of the
[1:25:45] sun, you know. As he ascended, it was as
[1:25:48] though he waved goodbye, ascending on
[1:25:50] high, signifying that the rest of the
[1:25:53] harvest, the resurrection of his people
[1:25:55] would follow.
[1:25:57] It was a sign, the harvest is coming. My
[1:26:01] resurrection is just the beginning.
[1:26:06] Hallelujah.
[1:26:08] Amen. And as he ascended and he waved
[1:26:11] goodbye, he was announcing the harvest
[1:26:14] is coming. And then came
[1:26:18] Pentecost. 50 days later, the first the
[1:26:21] feast of first fruits
[1:26:23] continued. It didn't stop with Jesus
[1:26:26] resurrection,
[1:26:28] but the feast of first fruits continued.
[1:26:30] And the Bible said in Acts 2 and2, "And
[1:26:33] suddenly there came a sound like a from
[1:26:37] heaven as a rushing mighty wind." What
[1:26:40] was that? That was quickening power. He
[1:26:42] was coming down and but it wasn't on
[1:26:44] Jesus this time but upon his body the
[1:26:48] church and the chief was now being waved
[1:26:51] again in resurrection power
[1:26:55] and this time over a people and when it
[1:26:59] did dead men came alive.
[1:27:02] Hallelujah. men and women who were dead
[1:27:05] in sins and trespasses came alive,
[1:27:09] resurrected to life, and were filled
[1:27:11] with the breath of God.
[1:27:14] Amen. And I tell you what, friends, it's
[1:27:16] not over because it's promised to be
[1:27:19] waved once more in the last day as Jesus
[1:27:21] said in St. Luke 17:30 when the son of
[1:27:25] man is revealed.
[1:27:28] He was waved again at Pentecost when the
[1:27:30] sound came from heaven like a rushing
[1:27:32] mighty wind. The word was waved over the
[1:27:36] people. Think of that. And and according
[1:27:40] to Luke 17:30 to be waved once more in
[1:27:44] the last day in the day when the son of
[1:27:47] man is revealed. And you might ask who
[1:27:49] is the son of man? It's the word made
[1:27:53] flesh.
[1:27:54] The word dwelling among us. John 1 and1
[1:27:58] declares in the beginning was the word
[1:28:00] and the word was with God and the word
[1:28:03] was God and the word was made flesh and
[1:28:05] dwelt among us. Now let me tell you that
[1:28:08] word was not just a
[1:28:10] concept. It was a person.
[1:28:14] Amen. I'll tell you with you. If you
[1:28:16] don't have the person, you don't have
[1:28:18] the word. You have theology but not the
[1:28:19] word. But when you get the person, you
[1:28:21] have the word.
[1:28:23] And he'll reveal to you the truth.
[1:28:26] Amen. So again, that word wasn't just a
[1:28:29] concept. It was a person. And if the son
[1:28:32] of man is being revealed in this final
[1:28:34] age, then it must be the word made flesh
[1:28:37] again. This time, not in one man, but in
[1:28:41] a many membered bride.
[1:28:46] Amen. That's where Armenia and the
[1:28:48] message got mi got mistaken. You know,
[1:28:50] they thought brother Brandham was the
[1:28:52] son of man. They thought that was the
[1:28:54] only place that was being revealed. But
[1:28:56] brother Brandham in the trial said, "I
[1:28:58] challenge you to believe that Jesus
[1:29:00] Christ is revealed in the son form of
[1:29:03] son of man in human flesh through the
[1:29:07] bride's body."
[1:29:10] Amen. So here's where he's been
[1:29:12] revealed. This is where Christ is being
[1:29:14] revealed. Sure, we saw him revealed in a
[1:29:16] prophet. But that was only one
[1:29:18] manifestation.
[1:29:20] Amen. But here he's now being revealed
[1:29:22] through the bride's body. And if the son
[1:29:25] of man is being revealed again, then he
[1:29:27] is the word. And he's being revealed
[1:29:30] today in flesh once again.
[1:29:33] Not in tradition, not in dead systems,
[1:29:36] but in a people, in his bride. Are you
[1:29:39] with me now? How many following me now?
[1:29:43] That's why the traditions of men are
[1:29:45] dead.
[1:29:47] And the spirit of God is alive and he's
[1:29:49] waving the sheep through a people that
[1:29:50] are baptized with the Holy Ghost and has
[1:29:53] given life to his people.
[1:29:56] It's not a tradition, not not some dead
[1:29:58] denominational system, but in a living
[1:30:02] people, a people so filled with the Holy
[1:30:04] Ghost that the same life that was in
[1:30:08] Christ is now being expressed in them.
[1:30:11] And that's why the traditions of man is
[1:30:13] powerless.
[1:30:15] They're dead. They're lifeless. They're
[1:30:17] empty. But if the spirit the spirit is
[1:30:20] alive again, it's waving the sheath.
[1:30:23] It's bringing resurrection life through
[1:30:26] a wordborn bride that that is baptized
[1:30:29] with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:30:32] Amen. So Christ was the first to raise
[1:30:36] from the dead, the first fruits. But the
[1:30:40] harvest
[1:30:41] demands another sheath in the end time.
[1:30:45] If we're having an end time, and that's
[1:30:47] where the Bible said the harvest would
[1:30:50] be, there has to be another sheep
[1:30:55] when we come back to the land again.
[1:31:00] Now, a sheep just like the ones in the
[1:31:04] upper room.
[1:31:06] They were the first from among the dead.
[1:31:09] Those early saints who came out of dead
[1:31:13] religious systems and rose in
[1:31:16] resurrection life. We too we have come
[1:31:19] out of the tombs of lifeless creeds. We
[1:31:22] are risen with him. No, not to return to
[1:31:25] the bondage of some religion. Come on.
[1:31:28] But to walk in resurrection power alive
[1:31:31] forever more.
[1:31:34] Amen. What is the sheath? It's the first
[1:31:38] one to mature.
[1:31:41] It is the proof the harvest is ready.
[1:31:45] And in this bride age, we have received
[1:31:48] the good news.
[1:31:50] It's the message that the full maturity
[1:31:53] of the word coming to the power and
[1:31:55] manifestation again in a people is waved
[1:31:58] with the same signs and wonders. The
[1:32:00] same spirit that Jesus had. Christ now
[1:32:04] revealed in his
[1:32:06] body. Jesus has come again. I don't see
[1:32:10] him. Well, look around. He is here in
[1:32:12] the bride body of his church.
[1:32:16] Amen. Before we meet him in the air,
[1:32:18] before we see the groom, he's got to
[1:32:20] manifest manifest himself fully in bride
[1:32:24] form on earth.
[1:32:26] Now when the priest waved the sheath in
[1:32:31] the Old Testament, it was a sign of
[1:32:33] action and acceptance and of
[1:32:36] power. And what was
[1:32:39] waved? I want to ask you what what Jesus
[1:32:43] that first sheath on that resurrection
[1:32:45] morning. It was the power of the
[1:32:47] resurrection.
[1:32:49] It was the spirit of God. Amen. And now
[1:32:53] in this final harvest, there is a
[1:32:55] another sheath that must be waved. A
[1:32:58] people brought to full maturity once
[1:33:01] again, bearing witness that the same
[1:33:04] Jesus
[1:33:06] lives again in bright form.
[1:33:13] You see, that's really your seventh
[1:33:15] seal. Seventh seal is a break in the
[1:33:18] silence. It is a revelation of his
[1:33:20] coming.
[1:33:22] The seventh seal is his coming and it's
[1:33:24] revealing where he is and what he's
[1:33:27] doing and where he's being revealed.
[1:33:32] Amen. Now, the harvest is here. The
[1:33:36] sheep is waving. The resurrection, as I
[1:33:38] said, is not just an event. It's a
[1:33:40] person. We celebrate it as an event
[1:33:43] called Easter, but it's not. It's a
[1:33:45] person. And he's alive in his people
[1:33:48] today. Amen. What is that, chief? It's
[1:33:51] it's the first message, the first life,
[1:33:53] the first people to come to full
[1:33:55] maturity in this age. You say, is it the
[1:33:58] message or is the people? The people are
[1:34:00] the message.
[1:34:03] Amen. Unless there is a people, there is
[1:34:05] no message. And if without the message,
[1:34:07] there wouldn't be a people. So in this,
[1:34:10] it's the first message, the first life,
[1:34:13] the first people to come to full
[1:34:15] maturity in this age. It's a bride who
[1:34:19] don't just have the word in theory, but
[1:34:22] has the life of the word flowing through
[1:34:25] her as he said, "Because I live, you
[1:34:28] shall live also." Now, friends, that's
[1:34:31] more than just a poetic
[1:34:33] language. This is resurrection reality.
[1:34:37] You got to get it. He He was waved in
[1:34:40] the early reign. Amen. In the former
[1:34:42] rain, called the early reign. He must be
[1:34:44] waved again in the latter rain. 2,000
[1:34:47] years ago, brother Brandham would type
[1:34:49] it different ways, but in one of the
[1:34:51] types, he would type it. That was the
[1:34:53] early rain and we are the latter rain.
[1:34:58] So you see, he must be waved again. And
[1:35:00] it's a sign that the harvest is
[1:35:05] ready. Because I live, you shall live
[1:35:08] also. That's what he said to his bride.
[1:35:10] What a resurrection that was. What a
[1:35:14] resurrection this is to be made alive in
[1:35:17] Christ by the same quickening power.
[1:35:21] Think of that.
[1:35:23] Having the same Holy Ghost poured out.
[1:35:27] Jesus Christ was the first to raise from
[1:35:29] the dead. He was the first of all the
[1:35:33] law and the prophets. He was the
[1:35:36] seed. He was the first of the Old
[1:35:39] Testament that came to full maturity.
[1:35:42] And in the last days, just like the
[1:35:44] original harvest, there must be a sheath
[1:35:47] waved again, a message, a matured word
[1:35:51] vindicated by the same signs and wonders
[1:35:54] that he performed. For once again, we
[1:35:56] have come back to the seed.
[1:36:00] the we're the first I want to say it the
[1:36:04] first of all the New
[1:36:07] Testament since Pentecost
[1:36:11] to come back to maturity
[1:36:16] immature in Wesley immature in Luther
[1:36:19] immature in Isuza but here we come back
[1:36:22] to maturity again
[1:36:24] the ripen grain because I live you shall
[1:36:27] live also you see That's resurrection.
[1:36:31] That's quickening. That's what
[1:36:32] restoration time really is. And he was
[1:36:35] waved before them at Pentecost. He was
[1:36:37] the word made manifest. And he'll be
[1:36:40] waved again at the end. Now hear me.
[1:36:44] Everything don't go to the garner.
[1:36:47] Everything ain't going in the rapture.
[1:36:51] Brother Brandon preached it. The seed
[1:36:52] will not be air with the young.
[1:36:55] So the whole field might grow together,
[1:36:59] but not everything is gathered together.
[1:37:02] We see tears bundled one way and we see
[1:37:06] straw bundled another. We see heads of
[1:37:08] grain carried to another. We see chap
[1:37:11] blowed
[1:37:15] away. Only the grain though is brought
[1:37:18] in the storehouse.
[1:37:21] the stock, the chaff, the husk that's
[1:37:26] left
[1:37:27] behind. And it'll either be burned or
[1:37:30] used as bedding for
[1:37:31] beast. Right? Amen. It's the grain that
[1:37:35] matters to God. You see, it's the part
[1:37:38] that carries life, the part that bears
[1:37:40] fruit, the part that's useful in his
[1:37:43] hands.
[1:37:45] And watch this. I I I want to get this
[1:37:48] picture to you of the harvest and this
[1:37:50] sheath waving because we get the wrong
[1:37:53] picture here.
[1:37:55] You see the wave offering didn't involve
[1:38:00] the whole plant.
[1:38:05] I want that to sink in because you get a
[1:38:07] lot of pictures a lot of times of this
[1:38:09] big bundle of of stalk with some heads
[1:38:13] of grain and the priest waving. That's
[1:38:16] not the way it
[1:38:19] was. What was it, Brother Tim? You see,
[1:38:23] God didn't ask for the stocks and the
[1:38:26] leaves or the husk to be lifted up
[1:38:28] before him.
[1:38:30] No, the priest didn't wave a a bundle of
[1:38:33] of of raw wheat or barley. He he w we w
[1:38:37] we w we w we w we w we w we w we w we w
[1:38:37] we w we wave thresh grain.
[1:38:42] Get it now. Only the grain is weighed,
[1:38:49] not the rest of the wheat plant.
[1:38:53] Only the
[1:38:55] grain. He waved threshed
[1:38:59] grain. Not just grain, but grain that
[1:39:03] had been crushed and sifted and ground
[1:39:06] into fine flour, refined, useful, and
[1:39:10] acceptable.
[1:39:15] Now, get the picture. Because grinding
[1:39:18] is violent, it's a process of being
[1:39:21] crushed, beaten, and processed.
[1:39:25] I don't know. I don't know sometimes why
[1:39:28] we go through the crushing.
[1:39:31] I don't know why sometimes some of us go
[1:39:35] through horrible, horrible tribulations
[1:39:37] and crushings and difficult
[1:39:40] times. But you even look at brother
[1:39:42] Brandham's life. In order for him to
[1:39:44] become something useful to God, he had
[1:39:47] to be crushed first.
[1:39:51] Come on. He had to go through the
[1:39:54] crushing and the purging and the
[1:39:56] learning not to listen to a
[1:39:57] mother-in-law and
[1:39:59] let family matters rule his and dictate
[1:40:02] it what he was to do. Are you with me?
[1:40:05] Amen. It's a process of being crushed
[1:40:07] and beaten and pressed and
[1:40:10] yet glory to God somehow out of that
[1:40:14] suffering comes transformation.
[1:40:17] What was once raw and coarse becomes
[1:40:20] something God can use. For that grain
[1:40:24] becomes flour and that flour becomes
[1:40:27] bread.
[1:40:30] Oh, let me preach this for a moment.
[1:40:32] Jesus Christ is our sheath offering.
[1:40:36] He was the first fruits from the dead.
[1:40:39] But before he was waved, he was wounded.
[1:40:43] Before he was lifted, he was beaten.
[1:40:47] Before resurrection, there was crushing.
[1:40:51] He was wounded for our transgression. He
[1:40:54] was bruised for our iniquities.
[1:41:00] You see, the stalks didn't take the
[1:41:02] stripes. The grain did.
[1:41:05] The husk didn't hang on the tree. The
[1:41:07] grain did.
[1:41:09] And after the beating, the scorgging,
[1:41:11] the nail piercing, and the blood
[1:41:13] shedding, God raised him up with
[1:41:15] resurrection power. And he said, "Here's
[1:41:18] my offering. Here is the bread of life.
[1:41:21] Here is the nourishment for the souls of
[1:41:23] mankind."
[1:41:26] You see, no wonder Jesus declared, "I'm
[1:41:28] the bread of life which came down from
[1:41:31] heaven." He wasn't raw grain. He was
[1:41:34] refined, beaten, baked by the fire of
[1:41:38] suffering. And he served to the world as
[1:41:41] living bread.
[1:41:44] And as a church, as a people of God,
[1:41:47] we're to be bread also.
[1:41:51] No, not raw grain. We get it. We get the
[1:41:53] idea a little bit wrong. In this wave
[1:41:56] offering, it's it's beaten
[1:41:59] grain in the fine flour.
[1:42:03] So now we come into this end time waving
[1:42:06] just as a waving of the first sheath.
[1:42:09] There'll be a waving of a people, a
[1:42:11] prepared people going to a prepared
[1:42:15] place.
[1:42:17] Remember, but listen, God will not wave
[1:42:20] the chaff of dead religion.
[1:42:25] He will not lift up stalks that are
[1:42:27] still rooted in tradition
[1:42:30] or husks that are puffed up with form
[1:42:32] and have no real substance to them. No,
[1:42:36] no nourishment, no nutrients. He's
[1:42:38] waving grain. He's waving people who
[1:42:42] have been separated from the chaff,
[1:42:45] threshed by the truth, ground by trials,
[1:42:49] refined by the fire, sanctified by the
[1:42:52] spirit, transformed from raw potential
[1:42:55] into a holy purpose.
[1:42:58] I'm talking about the grain, the
[1:43:00] sheepwave offering.
[1:43:02] They are the ones that God will wave in
[1:43:04] resurrection power. Oh yeah. You may
[1:43:07] wonder, why am I going through the
[1:43:09] beatings? Why am I going through the
[1:43:10] trials? How come the How come I never
[1:43:13] get a break?
[1:43:15] Because he's refining you.
[1:43:19] He's getting ready to pick you up and
[1:43:21] wave you before the world and say,
[1:43:23] "Here, this is my son. This is my
[1:43:26] daughter."
[1:43:28] Amen. These are the ones that God will
[1:43:30] raise will will wave with resurrection
[1:43:33] power, living sacrifices, living grain
[1:43:36] offerings. As he said in Romans 12:1,
[1:43:39] "Present your bodies as a living
[1:43:41] sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God. This
[1:43:44] is your reasonable service."
[1:43:48] And once again, the grain is being
[1:43:51] ground. I hope you can say hallelujah.
[1:43:55] Amen. Because when it's ground, it loses
[1:43:59] its individuality
[1:44:03] and becomes one substance.
[1:44:06] All those grain become one substance.
[1:44:10] Flour, fine flour, one
[1:44:14] people, one purpose, one body.
[1:44:20] Amen.
[1:44:22] 1 Corinthians 10:17. For we being many
[1:44:25] are one bread.
[1:44:30] I'm going to take off my coat
[1:44:33] and I want your full attention.
[1:44:36] Don't stare around. Look here or there.
[1:44:38] You look right here. I'm the one
[1:44:40] speaking to you through the Holy Spirit.
[1:44:43] Hear what the spirit is saying. Focus
[1:44:45] in.
[1:44:47] We being many are one bread. We are one
[1:44:51] body. We are all partakers or part of
[1:44:56] that one loaf.
[1:45:01] Are you with me now?
[1:45:04] Now, so I'm just saying to you, let God
[1:45:08] grind you.
[1:45:12] Say, why? Maybe your faith needs a
[1:45:15] little more refining.
[1:45:19] Maybe your persistence and your patience
[1:45:21] needs to be increased.
[1:45:24] Maybe you need to be ground a little
[1:45:26] more till you fit his image.
[1:45:31] Don't curse the
[1:45:33] crushing. That's how the grain becomes
[1:45:36] bread. That's how your life becomes
[1:45:38] useful in the hand of God. And when the
[1:45:41] grinding is done and the refining is
[1:45:43] complete, then God will wave you as part
[1:45:47] of his harvest, not as a stock, not as
[1:45:50] chaff, but as resurrected grain filled
[1:45:53] with the life of the risen Christ
[1:45:56] prepared for his glory.
[1:45:59] So let me recap it. Once the grain is
[1:46:03] ground, it loses its individuality.
[1:46:07] It becomes a single
[1:46:09] unified substance
[1:46:12] flower. This is symbolic to the body of
[1:46:15] Christ. Many members becoming one bread,
[1:46:20] one
[1:46:21] offering. Amen. For we being many are
[1:46:23] one bread, one body. For we're all
[1:46:25] partakers of one bread. This, you see,
[1:46:28] there's there's remembrance of this.
[1:46:30] Every time we do communion,
[1:46:32] we share the broken bread.
[1:46:36] And yet yet it does represent the broken
[1:46:39] body of the Lord. Although none of his
[1:46:42] bones were broken, but his body was
[1:46:45] bruised and beaten and
[1:46:47] pierced. But as bread is broken and
[1:46:50] shared it, it signifies also the oneness
[1:46:55] of
[1:46:56] believers in Christ's body, the church.
[1:46:58] We're all part of that one loaf. So you
[1:47:01] come by in the communion line and you
[1:47:03] get your little one piece
[1:47:06] because all together we make one loaf.
[1:47:10] Not everything goes in the garner
[1:47:12] though. But those yielded to the
[1:47:15] process, those will be waved and and
[1:47:18] gathered and offered in the power of his
[1:47:21] resurrection. So I say today, let the
[1:47:24] harvest begin. Let the wheat be
[1:47:27] threshed. Let the chaff be burned. Let
[1:47:29] the grain be refined. And let the grain
[1:47:32] then be waved before the Lord because
[1:47:34] he's going to take a bride up in the
[1:47:36] rapture and said this is her way over
[1:47:38] there with her.
[1:47:42] In his sermon, it is the rising of the
[1:47:45] sun. And if I recap this again because I
[1:47:47] bring it often, you know, many times and
[1:47:49] I'll have I'll actually hit a couple of
[1:47:51] more points just to reemphasize them to
[1:47:54] you because I I want you to get it.
[1:47:58] But in the rising of the sun, brother
[1:47:59] Bradom illustrated the difference
[1:48:02] between the chaff left behind and the
[1:48:05] grain that is raptured. And he did
[1:48:09] it with this
[1:48:12] illustration. He's told us to picture
[1:48:15] two brand new
[1:48:18] Cadillacs side by side.
[1:48:22] Perfect
[1:48:23] mechanics, beautiful dokin leather,
[1:48:27] chrome wheels, powerful engines, boat
[1:48:30] filled up with gasoline. They're ready
[1:48:32] to
[1:48:33] run, but one won't
[1:48:37] start.
[1:48:38] Why? Because no
[1:48:43] spark. Now remember, he's typing, he's
[1:48:46] using this illustration. And he's been
[1:48:48] talking about the sheath waving and the
[1:48:50] difference the chaff left
[1:48:52] behind. And I tell you
[1:48:55] what, with it in this condition, and I
[1:48:58] want to say with the word
[1:49:01] revealed, the only thing that matters
[1:49:03] now is the spark.
[1:49:07] Gasoline by itself won't run the car.
[1:49:11] And that's what's wrong with too many
[1:49:13] people and and even too many churches.
[1:49:16] We we have the word, but often we're
[1:49:19] lacking the star the the spark. We we
[1:49:22] have the farm. We have the beautiful
[1:49:24] car. We have the structure. But we deny
[1:49:26] the power thereof.
[1:49:29] And the spark is what ignites the gas.
[1:49:31] It confirms it as real thing. If there's
[1:49:34] no spark, there's no movement. It might
[1:49:36] as well be water.
[1:49:39] You see, that's where many churches go
[1:49:41] wrong. They focus only on the mechanics.
[1:49:46] And I say at church, we have focused on
[1:49:48] the mechanics. And rightly so. We got to
[1:49:51] have the word, the word, the word, the
[1:49:53] word, the word, the word.
[1:49:56] It must be. We must have the word
[1:49:58] correctly placed.
[1:50:00] It must be preached. Without the word,
[1:50:03] we're not going anywhere.
[1:50:05] There's power in that word.
[1:50:08] Amen. But but you see they focus on the
[1:50:10] mechanics, the doctrine, the theology,
[1:50:12] and even tradition. But without the
[1:50:15] dynamics, the Holy Spirit, they're
[1:50:17] lifeless.
[1:50:20] The word is true. That's the gas. But
[1:50:23] without the spirit, the spark, it
[1:50:25] doesn't move. And brother Bradam told
[1:50:28] us, we have focused too much on the
[1:50:30] mechanics and not enough on the
[1:50:33] dynamics,
[1:50:35] the power of the Holy Ghost to quicken
[1:50:37] the word. We got churches with the
[1:50:40] mechanics. We have doctrines. We have
[1:50:41] programs. We have beautiful buildings.
[1:50:43] We, you know, have structure of church
[1:50:45] orders and and beautiful singing and
[1:50:47] worship and whatever. But no
[1:50:51] dynamics. No Holy Ghost and fire to
[1:50:54] ignite the word is really important,
[1:50:57] church. Amen. Because this is what makes
[1:51:00] the difference between the chaff and the
[1:51:02] grain. Because one goes up, it has life
[1:51:05] in it. The other does not.
[1:51:08] So, so the Bible said that this would be
[1:51:11] in the end time that would have a form
[1:51:12] of godliness, but deny the power
[1:51:15] thereof. You see, you can have the word,
[1:51:17] you can have the gasoline in the tank,
[1:51:19] but if there's no spark, it just won't
[1:51:21] move. It, as we said, it might as well
[1:51:23] be water because you just can't have the
[1:51:27] word.
[1:51:29] You see, the gasoline by itself won't
[1:51:31] fire. You you need the spark to prove
[1:51:34] it's really gasoline.
[1:51:40] You say, "Brother Tim, well, you know,
[1:51:42] you people there, you just you you know,
[1:51:44] you just got this steam and you go blow
[1:51:46] it out the whistle. You know, you're
[1:51:48] blowing it out the whistle. That's all
[1:51:49] you're doing. Shout it." Listen, let me
[1:51:51] tell you
[1:51:53] something. It takes
[1:51:55] fire to get enough steam to blow out the
[1:51:58] whistle.
[1:52:02] So, the whistling is only proven there's
[1:52:04] fire in the engine.
[1:52:07] But we want more than a whistle.
[1:52:10] We want it to move down the track.
[1:52:14] Amen. We want to pull you down to
[1:52:16] holiness. We want to pull you down to
[1:52:18] godly life. We want to pull you down to
[1:52:20] divine healing. We want to chug right
[1:52:22] down to every promise of God.
[1:52:28] So the spark proves the gas is real. The
[1:52:31] spirit confirms the word is
[1:52:34] alive. That's the resurrection life.
[1:52:37] That's the quickening power. That's the
[1:52:39] spark that sets the whole church into
[1:52:41] motion. But too many have focused on the
[1:52:44] chrome paint in the body. Running test
[1:52:48] on the engines. Oh, haven't we done
[1:52:50] that?
[1:52:53] Oh yeah. You know, but I'm here to tell
[1:52:55] you, it won't run without fire.
[1:52:59] You need the Holy Ghost. We need fire.
[1:53:03] I believe we got the word. Don't you? I
[1:53:06] believe Malachi 4 restored the word.
[1:53:08] Don't you? Amen. Well, what we need is
[1:53:10] the fire of the Holy Ghost to hit that
[1:53:12] word on the inside of you and raise you
[1:53:15] up to live the
[1:53:17] gospel. Amen.
[1:53:19] Quoting the prophet, you believe the
[1:53:22] message of the day just to believe is
[1:53:24] not enough. To walk around where it's at
[1:53:27] isn't enough. You get all these things
[1:53:29] from the token. See, that's to make
[1:53:31] yourself worse. For he that knoweth to
[1:53:34] good do good and doeth it not to him is
[1:53:36] sin. In other words, he that knoweth you
[1:53:37] should get the Holy Ghost and don't do
[1:53:39] it is sin to you. You say, "I believe
[1:53:41] the message." That's all right. But
[1:53:43] that's good and but you must have the
[1:53:46] token. Do you hear Brandham Tabernacle?
[1:53:48] You must have the token displayed.
[1:53:52] So, well, we got the token, brother Jim.
[1:53:54] It must be displayed. It must be
[1:53:57] displayed with signs, with wonders,
[1:54:00] with a life that is lived, with fruits
[1:54:03] of the spirit. It has to be on display.
[1:54:07] We heard on Wednesday night of of one of
[1:54:09] the displays of the token at work, the
[1:54:13] love of God living out your life.
[1:54:15] Without it, all you're believing in is
[1:54:18] in vain. I'm quoting the prophet. You'll
[1:54:20] live a good life. You'll listen to what
[1:54:22] the word says. You'll go to church.
[1:54:23] You'll try to live right. That's fine.
[1:54:25] But that's not it. When I see the blood,
[1:54:28] that's the token. God's looking for the
[1:54:31] Holy Ghost. So, he said, "Don't just
[1:54:34] come this far and say, I believe the
[1:54:36] message. You obey the messenger. Come
[1:54:40] into Christ." You say, "Well, I believe
[1:54:42] every word said, Brother Brandham,
[1:54:43] that's good, but that's just being able
[1:54:45] to read." Take the message, take it in
[1:54:49] your heart that you must have the token,
[1:54:51] the very life that was in Christ being
[1:54:53] you. When I see that, I'll pass over
[1:54:56] you. Amen. Now when the token you see
[1:55:03] when the when the token the Holy Spirit
[1:55:06] fire ignites the 10,000 octane word of
[1:55:10] God residing in a man or a woman a
[1:55:14] church it will move in the power of God.
[1:55:18] And that's what happened at Pentecost.
[1:55:20] That's what happens again. The
[1:55:22] resurrection power of God moves the
[1:55:25] church forward.
[1:55:27] Now the first sheath which was the son
[1:55:30] of God was weighed and since then many
[1:55:34] churches have come many
[1:55:37] brides but there must be one real bride.
[1:55:41] That's what brother Brandham said. There
[1:55:42] have been church and churches bride
[1:55:43] brides church and churches but there
[1:55:45] must come a real one. Not just with the
[1:55:48] word but he said with a power to bring
[1:55:50] it to life. Not just mechanics but
[1:55:52] dynamics. A church that doesn't just
[1:55:54] look the part.
[1:55:57] but moves in the resurrection power of
[1:56:00] the Holy Ghost. For Paul said in 1
[1:56:03] Corinthians 2 and4, "My speech and my
[1:56:06] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:56:09] man's wisdom, but in demonstration of
[1:56:12] the spirit and of power." You see, you
[1:56:15] can polish the chrome all day long, but
[1:56:17] it won't drive without the power. You
[1:56:19] need both mechanics and dynamics.
[1:56:23] You see, he wasn't just the word. He was
[1:56:25] the life of that word.
[1:56:28] The dynamics of God entered the word and
[1:56:31] it shook his body laying in the tomb and
[1:56:34] it raised him up again and he said, "I
[1:56:37] am he that was
[1:56:39] dead." And even nature testified he was.
[1:56:43] But now the whole world must see he's
[1:56:46] alive.
[1:56:47] The word was not just truth. It was
[1:56:51] alive. And the bride is of that same
[1:56:54] life.
[1:56:56] Oh, get this. He that believeth on me,
[1:56:58] the works that I do shall you do also.
[1:57:01] He gives the bride, you see, the same
[1:57:03] charge, the same power, the same life,
[1:57:06] dynamics in the mechanics. Didn't he do
[1:57:09] it? He said, "The works that I do, shall
[1:57:13] you do also." So, one church sits still.
[1:57:16] It'll be left behind for the junkyard of
[1:57:19] the tribulation. The other rises in
[1:57:22] resurrection power.
[1:57:24] Now, both claim to be the bride, but
[1:57:27] only one has the life to move.
[1:57:30] You see, it's not the gasoline alone.
[1:57:33] It's the spark.
[1:57:35] We've got to have the spark. We got to
[1:57:38] have the Holy Spirit because he said,
[1:57:40] "You can do nothing without me, but with
[1:57:44] me all things are possible."
[1:57:46] Isn't that the truth?
[1:57:49] Amen. And as Paul said, it didn't come
[1:57:50] in word only. It came in power. And I
[1:57:54] want you to know this message didn't
[1:57:55] come in word only. It came in power. And
[1:57:58] if it's the word, it'll still be here in
[1:58:00] power.
[1:58:02] And if he's the groom, then the bride
[1:58:04] must be the
[1:58:05] same. You see, she must be flesh of his
[1:58:08] flesh and bone of his bone and spirit of
[1:58:11] his p spirit and power of his power. And
[1:58:13] together it makes the full union of
[1:58:16] mechanics and
[1:58:17] dynamics
[1:58:19] together. And that's why the church and
[1:58:22] I want you to get this because this is
[1:58:25] very
[1:58:26] important. I want you to understand the
[1:58:28] fullness of the spirit has not returned
[1:58:30] until our day.
[1:58:33] And that's why the church must receive
[1:58:36] the same spirit that moved Christ.
[1:58:41] Amen. That's the spark in the engine
[1:58:43] because he said the works that I do
[1:58:46] shall you do
[1:58:47] also. You see, there's power in the
[1:58:50] word. That's resurrection. That's the
[1:58:52] resurrection message. And that's why
[1:58:55] that's what they received in the upper
[1:58:56] room. They and that's what we got to
[1:58:58] have right now. Amen. The very same
[1:59:01] thing you you just can't have the form,
[1:59:03] the teaching, the structure. But the
[1:59:06] spirit doesn't move. It's dead.
[1:59:09] It must come together. And one church
[1:59:13] will sit still and the other will rise.
[1:59:18] I ask you what church you want to be a
[1:59:20] part of. Both may look
[1:59:23] alike. Both may claim to be bride but
[1:59:26] only one will have the spark.
[1:59:29] And it takes that combustion, that
[1:59:31] explosion of the spirit, uniting with
[1:59:34] the word to move it. That that's
[1:59:35] resurrection life. That's the real power
[1:59:37] of God. The word and the spirit
[1:59:39] together. For it's the spirit that
[1:59:41] quickenth.
[1:59:44] The word is a gasoline, the Holy Spirit
[1:59:47] the
[1:59:49] spark. So he said, "As the father has
[1:59:51] sent me, so send you." So as he sent
[1:59:55] him, how did he send him? He went in
[1:59:57] him. And he is sending forth the people
[2:00:00] in this day. How's he how's he sending
[2:00:02] us? By going in us. These signs shall
[2:00:05] follow them that believe.
[2:00:08] They are the proof of the dynamics and
[2:00:10] the
[2:00:12] mechanics. Now, so Romans 8:11
[2:00:17] says, excuse me, Romans 8:11, but if the
[2:00:21] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[2:00:24] dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[2:00:27] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[2:00:30] your mortal body by his spirit that
[2:00:32] dwelleth in you.
[2:00:35] Now, brother Brandham emphasized this.
[2:00:38] He emphasized in this scripture the word
[2:00:41] if.
[2:00:43] See it there. If that's the key word.
[2:00:48] If the same spirit that raised up Christ
[2:00:51] is in you. You see what was in him must
[2:00:54] dwell in the bride. If that's the
[2:00:57] dividing line. That's what separates the
[2:01:00] real bride from the imitation.
[2:01:04] The real bride will not stay in the
[2:01:07] garage
[2:01:09] and it will not be something just
[2:01:11] abandoned on the roadside.
[2:01:14] Amen. For she will not settle for empty
[2:01:16] tradition.
[2:01:18] No. No. She will move because she has
[2:01:21] mechanics and dynamics, the spirit and
[2:01:24] the word united.
[2:01:28] And when that union comes together, we
[2:01:30] fulfill the prophecy that is written in
[2:01:34] in Isaiah 60 and verse one that speaks
[2:01:37] of us. Arise, shine, for thy light has
[2:01:41] come. And the glory of the Lord is risen
[2:01:44] upon thee. Amen. The headstone coming
[2:01:47] down upon a people crying, "Grace,
[2:01:50] grace." You see, let's go back in a
[2:01:54] moment and let's look at God's first
[2:01:57] bridegroom, which was
[2:01:59] Adam. He had both male and female in
[2:02:02] spirit form, right? And when God created
[2:02:06] Eve, he didn't go get some new
[2:02:09] dirt. He took Eve from
[2:02:13] Adam. Same flesh, same spirit, same
[2:02:17] life. Took her from Adam's side. Not a
[2:02:21] new creation, but a part of that same
[2:02:23] word.
[2:02:26] And the bride must also be flesh of his
[2:02:29] flesh and bone of his bone and spirit of
[2:02:32] his spirit. Mechanics and dynamics
[2:02:35] united together.
[2:02:37] So it must be both. And when it does,
[2:02:40] it'll move just like he did. As brother
[2:02:42] Brandon said, if it if it hit on 16
[2:02:45] cylinders, so will the bride. They'll be
[2:02:48] just like Jesus. And until the church
[2:02:51] becomes both mechanics and dynamics,
[2:02:54] word and spirit, she'll never move in
[2:02:56] resurrection power.
[2:03:02] So don't criticize seeing a little bit
[2:03:04] of steam coming out the whistle.
[2:03:09] Amen. Don't criticize. It's fire
[2:03:12] that has already started uniting,
[2:03:15] igniting the word.
[2:03:17] Come on. That's quickening power already
[2:03:19] at work. That's resurrection life.
[2:03:22] That's the real message. The real
[2:03:25] message is not just word but his spirit.
[2:03:28] Not just truth but
[2:03:34] life. And unless it has both the
[2:03:38] active both of them active as prevailent
[2:03:41] power then it's really not the real
[2:03:45] message. The real message has both.
[2:03:49] That brings us into raptured condition.
[2:03:55] Now, Brother Brandham preached this in
[2:03:56] the Easter Seal and he he showed you
[2:03:59] what it does to you as an individual.
[2:04:02] When resurrection power hits
[2:04:05] you, the old things, what does it
[2:04:09] do to our moral body? It turns our
[2:04:12] opinions.
[2:04:15] Oh, we got we got a world today trying
[2:04:18] to turn your opinion.
[2:04:21] But God's wanting you to to turn your
[2:04:23] opinion. And so what does this
[2:04:26] quickening power do? Our mortal body, it
[2:04:28] turns our opinion. It changes our
[2:04:30] notions.
[2:04:31] It sets our affections on things above.
[2:04:36] And the smoking, the drinking, the
[2:04:38] gambling, the things that you used to do
[2:04:39] is dead. It's beneath you.
[2:04:45] And what does it do? Now listen so
[2:04:46] you'll know. And this Easter, I want it
[2:04:48] to mean more to you than any Easter ever
[2:04:50] did. I want you to see it. We know what
[2:04:53] it done for him. But I want you to see
[2:04:56] it not will. It has done the same for
[2:04:58] you. What does it do? It quickens the
[2:05:01] mortal body.
[2:05:05] This mortal body that we live in, it
[2:05:07] quickens it. In other words, it brings
[2:05:09] it to life. Now once you who walked
[2:05:13] alone with a great big cigar in your
[2:05:19] mouth or a bunch of cigarettes and you
[2:05:22] women who once had short hair and
[2:05:24] painted and carried on wore shorts and
[2:05:26] things like that all at once something
[2:05:30] screamed and you looked down and it was
[2:05:32] the word. It quickened your you said no
[2:05:35] more shorts for me, no more liquor for
[2:05:37] me. No more lying. No more stealing. No
[2:05:40] more this or that. The spirit that
[2:05:42] raised him from the dead dwelling in you
[2:05:45] will bring your mortal bodies subjective
[2:05:48] to what? Christ. And who is Christ? The
[2:05:52] word. Not theology, but the word. Didn't
[2:05:53] you say these things? Oh, I think it's
[2:05:56] all right for women to wear slacks. When
[2:05:58] the word says no. See, it quickens you
[2:06:00] to that. You are drawn to it.
[2:06:04] See, it's you then you become part of
[2:06:09] the word.
[2:06:13] Hallelujah.
[2:06:15] Amen. I'm looking at I'm looking at men
[2:06:18] and women today. Quickening power is
[2:06:20] already at work in you.
[2:06:24] It's already turned you heavenly.
[2:06:28] It's already working in your mortal
[2:06:30] body.
[2:06:32] You used to smoke, drink, dope, carry
[2:06:34] on, fornicate, everything else. What
[2:06:36] happened? Quickening power
[2:06:40] got a hold of you, changed your opinion,
[2:06:43] changed your desires, lifted you
[2:06:46] up, resurrected you from dead works
[2:06:52] to serve the living God.
[2:06:55] That's the Holy Ghost that did that.
[2:06:59] I've been looking for him, brother Tim.
[2:07:01] That's him that did that.
[2:07:04] And he that started a good work in you
[2:07:06] is going to finish it.
[2:07:12] Look what you were and look what you
[2:07:14] are.
[2:07:17] You came from somewhere.
[2:07:19] Something happened. There was a change
[2:07:22] took place. Transformation power took
[2:07:26] work. The things you used to do, you do
[2:07:29] them no more. The desires you used to
[2:07:31] have, you have them no more. Your
[2:07:34] opinions is now changed. Your thoughts
[2:07:37] are on him.
[2:07:41] Oh, that's greater than speaking in
[2:07:44] tongues and running up and down the
[2:07:45] aisle.
[2:07:50] Come on, church. Amen. This change that
[2:07:53] has happened in you is a permanent
[2:07:55] change.
[2:07:57] And you see your atmosphere is changed.
[2:08:02] You've turned heavenly. You're caught up
[2:08:04] into it. When you're filled with the
[2:08:06] spirit, this is what brother Brandham
[2:08:08] said that happened at Pentecost. So
[2:08:10] rapturing up, raised into a, and I'm
[2:08:13] quoting him, raising up into a different
[2:08:15] atmosphere than they'd ever lived in.
[2:08:19] Even their language was quickened to a
[2:08:21] heavenly language.
[2:08:24] Say, "Not mind, brother Tim. I've never
[2:08:26] spoke in tongues. Listen. Listen. You've
[2:08:28] spoke heavenly language. That's right.
[2:08:31] You no longer speak the language of
[2:08:33] defeat,
[2:08:35] the language of darkness, the language
[2:08:37] of unbelief, the language of doubt, the
[2:08:40] language of sin. Hallelujah. You now
[2:08:43] speak the language of heaven.
[2:08:49] That's better than unknown tongues that
[2:08:51] nobody understands. That's something the
[2:08:53] world can see.
[2:09:01] Oh yeah. I believe in speaking in
[2:09:02] tongues and I encourage it. I say
[2:09:04] everybody ought to have that experience.
[2:09:08] But without this, it's nothing. That's
[2:09:10] right.
[2:09:14] Now,
[2:09:15] church, I'm 70 years
[2:09:18] old, and I know you
[2:09:22] are wondering when I'm going into mental
[2:09:29] decline. And when I'll start repeating
[2:09:32] myself and preaching the same sermons
[2:09:35] over again, I know what I'm doing here.
[2:09:41] I'm fully cognant of what I'm doing.
[2:09:44] This is not some forgetful old man.
[2:09:48] I'm bringing back to your memory,
[2:09:52] back to remembrance,
[2:09:55] emphasizing again some very important
[2:09:58] parts.
[2:10:01] Now, it's in this atmosphere, I'm
[2:10:04] covering it again. It's in this
[2:10:06] atmosphere, this Holy Ghost atmosphere,
[2:10:09] that we will meet him. Yeah.
[2:10:12] Not just a moment of joy and ecstasy,
[2:10:15] but a realm where faith and godly works
[2:10:17] converge in a holy
[2:10:21] harmony. This this isn't just emotional
[2:10:24] elation. It's a divine collusion of
[2:10:28] belief and obedience, a spirit and
[2:10:30] truth. It's the revelation of a people
[2:10:32] who didn't just say they knew him,
[2:10:36] but they actually live like they did.
[2:10:40] It's not enough to shout about being in
[2:10:43] the message and being rapture ready with
[2:10:46] a bold claim, well, I'm predestinated.
[2:10:50] But we must be spiritfilled and
[2:10:52] fruitbearing.
[2:10:56] For he's not coming back with a tree for
[2:10:58] a tree, a bride tree with with just
[2:11:00] leaves only, but one that is heavy with
[2:11:03] fruit,
[2:11:04] that has love and holiness and obedience
[2:11:07] and faithfulness and
[2:11:09] power. It won't be empty claims that
[2:11:13] rise to meet him. It will be lives that
[2:11:15] are full of his life.
[2:11:18] Lives that have abided in him, that have
[2:11:20] walked in him, that are now being caught
[2:11:22] up to meet with him.
[2:11:26] The rapture is going to be more than
[2:11:28] just a celebration. Oh, it'll be that.
[2:11:30] All right. But it is a culmination of a
[2:11:35] life that didn't just profess Christ,
[2:11:39] but manifested him. They didn't just
[2:11:42] say, "I'm in the message."
[2:11:44] And wear a message label.
[2:11:48] Come on. Amen. But actually manifesting
[2:11:53] Christ is more than a a pin that you get
[2:11:56] from voice of God.
[2:12:00] Amen. It's not just claiming to be
[2:12:02] connected to the vine, but it's bearing
[2:12:06] the fruit that we are the branches.
[2:12:09] Living extensions of his own life. That
[2:12:12] we're alive with his life. We're flowing
[2:12:14] with his nature. We're producing what
[2:12:17] only the vine can produce. Amen.
[2:12:21] In that atmosphere, it won't be empty
[2:12:25] words that rise to meet him. It'll be
[2:12:28] lives that are full of the spirit.
[2:12:31] Amen. It'll be full of his nature. For
[2:12:34] the bride is not only spiritfilled. She
[2:12:37] is fruitbearing. And it is that living,
[2:12:39] breathing, producing union with Christ
[2:12:42] that were caught up to meet him in
[2:12:47] glory. And listen to me.
[2:12:50] In that
[2:12:51] moment, he will not be meeting a church
[2:12:54] full of empty
[2:12:56] profession, but a bride made ready that
[2:12:59] is clothed in righteousness, whose wits
[2:13:02] are trimmed and are filled with oil and
[2:13:05] radiant with the spirit and have the
[2:13:07] fruit of the Holy Ghost.
[2:13:12] And this is more than
[2:13:15] professing than being than just
[2:13:17] professing. I'm connected to the vine. I
[2:13:20] have his life. Making that profession is
[2:13:23] bearing the fruit that proves we are
[2:13:26] branches.
[2:13:28] Brother Brandham said this in the
[2:13:29] message investments. Now listen, this
[2:13:32] goes along with brother Aaron's message
[2:13:34] Wednesday night.
[2:13:37] The world is wanting to seek
[2:13:40] Christ. Jesus said, "I'm the vine.
[2:13:42] You're the branches." And the branch
[2:13:44] bears record of the vine because it
[2:13:46] draws his energy and life from the vine.
[2:13:50] Well, the first vine, the first branch
[2:13:52] that came forth from this vine, they
[2:13:54] wrote a book of acts behind that branch.
[2:13:58] We see the way the spirit acted in the
[2:14:00] first church, that church of Pentecost.
[2:14:02] And then when we believe that if this
[2:14:05] original vine ever puts forth another
[2:14:07] branch, they will write another book of
[2:14:10] Acts behind it because it's the same
[2:14:12] life that's in the
[2:14:15] vine. And if the first branch put forth
[2:14:18] a bunch of grapes and then we find a
[2:14:21] bunch out here that's got watermelons
[2:14:23] growing on it or pumpkins or cucumbers,
[2:14:27] we know that it isn't the life that's in
[2:14:31] the vine.
[2:14:32] Therefore, I think, now listen close,
[2:14:35] that we who call ourselves
[2:14:38] Pentecostals has failed to represent the
[2:14:41] real thing that Christ has set forth for
[2:14:44] us to represent, the Holy Ghost and the
[2:14:47] life of the
[2:14:50] spirit. We sometimes represent
[2:14:54] sensations and we represent joy and
[2:14:57] that's
[2:14:59] good. Nothing wrong with that.
[2:15:02] But there's more to it than that. There
[2:15:05] is a fruit that goes with it. And the
[2:15:07] hungry man is looking for this fruit of
[2:15:10] the spirit. And that was the quality
[2:15:12] that was in Jesus.
[2:15:16] Amen. So it's the atmosphere where faith
[2:15:21] has real works, where love is expressed
[2:15:24] and projects from the inner atmosphere
[2:15:28] of our souls in both goodness and mercy.
[2:15:30] I want to read you a scripture. It's
[2:15:33] found in Micah 6
[2:15:36] and8. He has shown thee, oh man, what is
[2:15:39] good and what the Lord doth require of
[2:15:42] thee, but to do justly and to love mercy
[2:15:45] and walk humbly before our God. Hold
[2:15:49] that scripture up for a minute. Let me
[2:15:50] read it in the amplified. He has told
[2:15:53] you, oh man, what is good. And what does
[2:15:56] the Lord require of you except to be
[2:16:00] just and to love and to diligently
[2:16:04] practice kindness, compassion, and to
[2:16:07] walk humbly with your God, setting aside
[2:16:11] any overblown sense of importance or
[2:16:18] selfrighteousness. So this is what God
[2:16:20] wants expressed.
[2:16:23] So, let me tell you, the rapture that
[2:16:26] we're looking for is not coming to get
[2:16:30] those who are lifeless and void of the
[2:16:33] spirit.
[2:16:35] And it won't be merely an event. It will
[2:16:37] be an
[2:16:39] atmosphere. The rapture is an
[2:16:43] atmosphere. The very word means
[2:16:46] ecstasy. Overjoyed is a atmosphere of
[2:16:52] great joy of
[2:16:55] expressions and it's an atmosphere that
[2:16:58] is saturated with a dynamic overwhelming
[2:17:02] infusion of
[2:17:04] love. Amen. That divine love which is
[2:17:07] the Holy
[2:17:08] Ghost. It will be so charged with glory.
[2:17:12] I'm talking about the atmosphere of the
[2:17:14] rapture. so saturated with the very
[2:17:17] voice of God, the very spirit of God,
[2:17:20] the very breath of God, until sickness
[2:17:23] will vanish, the lame will leap, limbs
[2:17:26] will be restored.
[2:17:29] Not through the laying on of hands. Come
[2:17:32] on, church. But by the very presence and
[2:17:35] power of his spirit. And in that sacred
[2:17:39] moment, we're going to be caught up.
[2:17:41] Yes. Not just lifted up into the skies,
[2:17:44] but into a dimension of glory that where
[2:17:48] heaven touches the earth. In that
[2:17:50] atmosphere, we'll caught up not just
[2:17:53] upward, but inward into a realm where
[2:17:56] heaven, as I said, touches the earth and
[2:18:00] the divine feels the
[2:18:02] natural. Yeah, I know. The word said
[2:18:04] we'll meet him in the air. That's the
[2:18:07] Bible. And truly we we may certainly
[2:18:11] rise like Jesus did and take it in the
[2:18:13] clouds and receive out of the sight. I'm
[2:18:15] not even going to argue that
[2:18:18] point and neither would I belittle that
[2:18:20] point.
[2:18:22] But the air speaks of something that is
[2:18:25] that is deeper. It's more more than
[2:18:27] oxygen and
[2:18:28] altitude. Is not just atmosphere sky. Is
[2:18:32] a spiritual realm
[2:18:35] that you ought to be praying this
[2:18:36] morning. Lord, lift me up above the
[2:18:39] shadows.
[2:18:42] Lift me up and let me stand.
[2:18:45] Bring me up on the mountaintop. Take me
[2:18:48] out of the doldrums to lift me up in the
[2:18:51] Holy Ghost.
[2:18:53] It's a spiritual realm, a heavenly
[2:18:55] atmosphere. It's a place of divine
[2:18:58] encounter. The space where the temporal
[2:19:01] gives way to the eternal. A divine
[2:19:04] intersection where the the natural gives
[2:19:06] way
[2:19:09] to the
[2:19:12] supernatural. The Bible said we'll be
[2:19:14] caught up to meet him in the air. And
[2:19:17] that air signifies and
[2:19:21] symbolizes that sacred in between that
[2:19:25] threshold between heaven and
[2:19:27] earth between mortality and
[2:19:30] immortality is where the the veil tears
[2:19:35] and eternity meets the
[2:19:38] soul. And it's the same kind of air that
[2:19:42] was in the upper
[2:19:43] room. Hear me church. There was a sound.
[2:19:48] A sound like a rushing mighty wind. Why?
[2:19:51] The atmosphere was shifting.
[2:19:55] Amen. Heaven was invading. The spirit of
[2:19:58] God didn't just sin. God breathed.
[2:20:04] Come on, church. Just as God breathed
[2:20:07] life into Adam, forming man out of dust,
[2:20:10] making him a living soul. So even at
[2:20:13] Pentecost in the upper room, God
[2:20:15] breathed life
[2:20:18] into the church and she became a moving,
[2:20:22] living, spiritfilled bride, alive with
[2:20:25] power and alive with purpose, alive with
[2:20:28] his presence.
[2:20:31] A people that were filled with heaven's
[2:20:33] atmosphere where the divine love
[2:20:35] permeates all and prevails.
[2:20:41] Wind is a symbol. Breath is a substance.
[2:20:45] The Holy Ghost is
[2:20:47] both. Wind and spirit in the scriptures
[2:20:50] always point to the spirit of
[2:20:53] God. And like the wind, the spirit moves
[2:20:56] how he
[2:20:57] wills. You don't always know where he
[2:21:01] comes from
[2:21:03] or where he's going
[2:21:05] or when it's going to blow.
[2:21:09] Come on, church. Oh, we're we're ripe
[2:21:12] for the blowing. It may be a little bit
[2:21:14] still in the building this morning,
[2:21:17] but it's time for the spirit to blow.
[2:21:20] Amen. And we don't always know where
[2:21:22] it'll come from, what side it'll even
[2:21:25] start on.
[2:21:27] How it will feel when it will come down.
[2:21:30] But you'll hear the sound. You'll feel
[2:21:32] the change. You'll see the evidence.
[2:21:34] You'll know it's there.
[2:21:38] You may not see a pillar of fire, but
[2:21:41] it'll be here.
[2:21:44] And you'll see like the wind blowing,
[2:21:46] leaves begin to move.
[2:21:50] Amen. The trees clap their hand. Amen.
[2:21:53] People waving in the spirit of God.
[2:21:56] Amen. The enemy being blown away. The
[2:22:00] spirit of God moving through the church.
[2:22:03] the dynamics of the Holy Ghost falling
[2:22:06] in the building.
[2:22:08] Hallelujah. You'll see the evidence.
[2:22:11] You'll know it's there. That's the
[2:22:13] spirit of the living God. He moves
[2:22:15] suddenly
[2:22:17] unexpectedly. And when he does,
[2:22:19] everything changes.
[2:22:21] Everything changes when he arrives.
[2:22:26] So I say, let him blow this morning.
[2:22:29] Even so, the bride being filled with the
[2:22:32] spirit, we have been made
[2:22:35] alive. We're not some cold, lifeless
[2:22:38] institution. We're not some dead formal
[2:22:41] shell of religion. We're a living,
[2:22:44] breathing, moving spirit anointed body.
[2:22:48] Hallelujah. We're breathing, worshiping,
[2:22:51] interceding, fruitbearing bride. That's
[2:22:54] who we are because we're alive.
[2:22:57] The breath of God is in us.
[2:23:01] Hallelujah. And where there is breath,
[2:23:03] there is sound.
[2:23:06] And it's the voice of the resurrection.
[2:23:08] It's the voice of the resurrection one
[2:23:11] lives through your life and blows
[2:23:14] through your being
[2:23:17] and it proves the spirit is
[2:23:19] there. Where there's sound, there's
[2:23:22] voice. And with that voice, the bride
[2:23:25] declares resurrection life.
[2:23:29] She has a
[2:23:31] voice. She has a voice. It's the voice
[2:23:34] of the
[2:23:35] resurrection. Is a voice, a power, a
[2:23:39] voice that declares the spirit in the
[2:23:43] bride say, "Come."
[2:23:51] See, we're not just waiting for a quiet
[2:23:53] escape. We're being prepared for a
[2:23:56] glorious eruption of life and glory and
[2:23:59] divine transformation.
[2:24:02] The rapture itself is the climax of a
[2:24:04] spiritfilled union when the when the
[2:24:07] wind of God catches a living bride and
[2:24:11] like a mighty eagle, she soarses into
[2:24:13] his presence forever. I don't know about
[2:24:16] you this morning, but I'm getting ready
[2:24:18] to leave this world.
[2:24:21] I tell you, you may be sitting down on a
[2:24:23] limb this morning. You may be resting
[2:24:26] from a trial. You may have went through
[2:24:28] persecution and a storm. You may have
[2:24:30] been blown down where you're just
[2:24:32] hanging there on a tree and just by a
[2:24:35] thread like it was. But let me tell you
[2:24:37] something this morning. If you can feel
[2:24:39] the wind,
[2:24:41] hallelujah. If you can feel the spirit
[2:24:43] moving, if you can feel it coming and
[2:24:46] ruffling up your feathers, if you can
[2:24:48] feel it moving, I tell you, set your
[2:24:51] wings. Lift your wings. Rise up. Take a
[2:24:55] jump off of that low limb. Get out of
[2:24:58] that depression. Get out of that
[2:25:00] unbelief. Get out of that spirit of
[2:25:02] darkness and rise.
[2:25:06] Let the wind lift you up. Let the Holy
[2:25:09] Ghost lift you up into a rapture
[2:25:12] atmosphere where all things are
[2:25:14] possible. Where the sick are healed,
[2:25:16] where cancers are gone, and where the
[2:25:19] body of Christ rises in power.
[2:25:23] Hallelujah. God's one to take you who
[2:25:26] have been ground. God's one to take you
[2:25:29] have been bruised. those of you that
[2:25:31] have been wounded and ground in the fine
[2:25:34] flower and wave you with resurrection
[2:25:36] life and say this is my people. Amen.
[2:25:40] She overcomes death, hell, and the
[2:25:42] grave. She's more than a conqueror.
[2:25:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:25:51] Until we say the same thing as the
[2:25:55] spirit.
[2:25:57] The spirit and the bride say come.
[2:26:05] Do you know what the trumpet
[2:26:07] says? Does anybody know what the trumpet
[2:26:11] will
[2:26:12] say?
[2:26:14] Oh
[2:26:16] no, that's not what it'll say.
[2:26:22] At the end of the seven
[2:26:25] ages, a door, an
[2:26:27] entrance was made into
[2:26:29] heaven. Revelation chapter 4.
[2:26:35] As the
[2:26:36] bride goes
[2:26:38] up at the end of the Leodysian
[2:26:41] age and heaven opens
[2:26:45] far, I heard as it was of the voice of a
[2:26:49] trumpet that said, "Come up, hither."
[2:26:57] Hallelujah.
[2:26:58] Hallelujah. That's what the trumpet
[2:27:00] said. It says, "Come up."
[2:27:03] Oh, if you can hear the trumpet gospel
[2:27:05] this morning, it's saying, "Come up.
[2:27:09] Come up. Rise a little higher. Come up
[2:27:13] from the doldrums. Come out of
[2:27:15] lukewarmness. Come out of unbelief.
[2:27:19] Come up hither.
[2:27:21] Move into the atmosphere.
[2:27:24] Let it feel your wings. Let it feel your
[2:27:27] lungs until you speak the voice of the
[2:27:30] spirit.
[2:27:32] until you also say, "Even so, come Lord
[2:27:36] Jesus, come."
[2:27:39] And you're gathered home to meet him.
[2:27:41] Stand together with
[2:27:44] me.
[2:27:47] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[2:27:50] Lord. Blessed be the name of my
[2:27:53] rock. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:27:56] We'll be caught up in an atmosphere that
[2:27:59] feels like the upper room, but even
[2:28:01] greater. It'll be glory upon glory,
[2:28:04] breath upon breath, spirit calling the
[2:28:07] spirit, the spirit, the Holy Spirit in
[2:28:10] us calling to the Holy Spirit coming
[2:28:12] down. And in that sacred moment, we will
[2:28:16] be changed and caught
[2:28:18] up forever with the
[2:28:21] Lord. Yeah, it's harvest time.
[2:28:25] And the Lord of the harvest is here.
[2:28:29] Come here, brother Jerry. Come right
[2:28:32] here. Get this microphone and sing. It's
[2:28:35] harvest time. And I can hear the
[2:28:37] combines coming. You're going to gather
[2:28:40] in the grain and take it home. Amen. The
[2:28:43] tears will all be burned because God's
[2:28:47] word. But I'm so glad. Aren't you glad
