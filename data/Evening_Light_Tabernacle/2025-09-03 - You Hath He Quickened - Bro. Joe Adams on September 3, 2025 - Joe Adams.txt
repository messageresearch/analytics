He said, "No one can come unto the father unless I draw him." &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing to be drawn by him. Amen. Amen. Just want to say we had a wonderful time there in brother Ron's meetings at the Full Gospel Lighthouse. I don't know if you've had an opportunity to listen to the services yet, but I would highly recommend it. Wonderful services that we had there. I believe you'd be really blessed. It's on YouTube. You can look up Full Gospel Lighthouse if you don't know. So, amen. We Amen. actually made a few different arrangements. Brother Tim was going to ride back with us, but we made arrangements for him to fly home later. And so, he uh today's his birthday, and he's been enjoying a good day there. So, Amen. We're thankful for that. And we have some prayer requests we want to bring tonight before the Lord. We have a prayer request for Sister Sarah Field's dad. It's also Sister Amy Mitchell's dad was diagnosed with uh bone cancer. He's been having to receive blood transfusions. He's very weak in body physically having a difficult time. So, just want to ask the Lord to remember him. Brother Larry, he actually used to attend this church and so just want to remember him that the Lord would be merciful to him. Also, brother Jason Tagert asked us to remember little Hunter Tagert for his complete healing. And I believe that he's that kind of God. Amen. That it doesn't matter. There's nothing too hard for the Lord and thankful to serve a God like that. So, let's just go to prayer. Father, we just come to you today, Lord, just so thankful we can bow our heads before a living God and a God who can answer and a God who can move on our needs. And sometimes, Lord, in our human abilities and our human eyes, we cannot we can't see things happening. But Lord, we do know that you're working even when we don't see you working. And Lord, we just ask, Father, that you would come and minister to every heart and every need that's here tonight. We ask, Father, you meet, Lord, this need for Brother Larry. Father, you need see the need in his body. And Lord, not only his body, but his spirit and soul, Father, that you can just touch him, Lord, in this time. Lord, draw close to him and draw him close to you. We pray, Lord, for little Hunter. Lord, we ask, God, that you'd bring a complete healing to that little body. Lord, I'm so thankful to be able to call out upon you in confidence, knowing that there's nothing too hard for you. But Lord, we can ask anything in your name and it can be done. And Lord, we're asking today because we believe you're that kind of God. And you can answer, Lord, every need that's on our hearts. And every need that we have, no matter how big or how small or how insignificant we may think it is, Lord God, you're mindful of every part of it.

Lord, you would tell us when you departed that I'll send a a comforter. Lord, one that would be with us even to the very end. And Lord, here we are at the waning of time, Lord, the ending of the Gentile dispensation. And you're just as real today as you were then. Your word is just as true and effectual as it was, Lord, when you first spoke those words. Thank you for sending us a comfort. Thank you, God, for the message of the hour. Lord, our hearts have been, Lord, enthralled and enthrilled and enraptured with your presence, God. Thank you for the truth that you have given us, Lord. Thank you for hearts, a bedding ground that can receive the word. We just ask that you'd come by once again this evening, Lord, as you had visited us many times, Lord, service after service. Lord, we know it's not about a man standing before your people, Lord, lecturing with his intellect, but Father, it's you coming anointing that word, that gift that you've placed there, anointing the people to receive from it, to pull what they have need of. And we invite you and ask that you would do that tonight. May there be such an atmosphere, such a charge of the spirit, God, you would direct the service however you would choose, Lord, tonight. And your people will be blessed and you will receive all the honor. For we ask it now in Jesus name. Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, we're going to look here in Romans 8. Going to pick back up kind of a little bit on where we were preaching on Sunday. We spoke on predestinated to quickening power. Tonight, I want to speak to you on you hath he quickened. &gt;&gt; So when we look at this, I want you to make sure you put your name into that scripture. &gt;&gt; You hath he quickened. Not your neighbor, not the ministry, not the deacons and different ones that we hold in high esteem. But I want you to put yourself there tonight. And we find here in Romans 8 and verse 9 says, "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit. If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, and he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you. Let's look also in Ephesians 2 and verse one. Ephesians 2 and verse one and we'll have you be seated. It says, "And you hath he quickened you." &gt;&gt; You mean me? No, I mean you. &gt;&gt; Not me. You. And sometimes we look at ourselves, you mean me? Yes, I mean you. You hath he quickened who were dead in sins and trespasses. God bless you. You can have your seats tonight. Just want to without a show of hands just how many of you have ever really struggled about your your your eternal destination or maybe struggle with your salvation, struggle with your past, constantly coming up and reminding you of the things that you've done. I dare to say probably all of us at some point through our journey maybe even within the week the day we struggle with these kind of things but we find here Paul he's saying and you had he quickened who were &gt;&gt; notice that's past tense that's not what you are tonight that's past tense that's what you were you were dead that word dead there means destitute of lifeless no spiritual life in you at all you were down in sins and trespasses Then he says, "Where in times past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all." So notice, you're not alone. &gt;&gt; Misery loves company. Come on, somebody. You're not alone in that. We all were sinners. We all walked according to the the desires of the flesh and had our conversations in time past in the lust of the flesh. fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others. Notice this is what you were. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody stake that claim down. That's what I was. That's not what I am tonight. &gt;&gt; Don't let your past dictate your future. &gt;&gt; Don't let your past dictate who you are tonight. Look at the word and what the word says about you. You may have been in sin. You may have been dead. You may have done these things, but that's not who you are tonight. &gt;&gt; You got a promise laying in the scripture. You had him quickened. &gt;&gt; Make it personal tonight. I've been quickened. I've been made alive. &gt;&gt; Not by some man's idea, not by some church denomination, not some some system, but you have been made alive by the quickening power of almighty God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even when we were dead, listen, when we were dead in sins, verse five, hath he quickened us together with Christ. &gt;&gt; And by grace you are saved, and hath raised us up together, and made us sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, let me just state the obvious. If you're sitting in heavenly places, then why are you dwelling on your failures? &gt;&gt; That's right. I mean, if you're sitting in heavenly places, why you dwelling on your past? &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; No, but you've been quickened. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You've been made alive by the power of God. Somebody needs this tonight. &gt;&gt; Somebody, the devil's been reminding you of your failures. Maybe you had a bad past, a bad childhood, a bad upbringing, and everything's been horrible in your life. Everything's been wrong, and you wonder, "How did I make it here?" You made it here because God had predestinated you to be quickened by the power of the word. And he's going to remind you tonight that I am here. I'm still God. I'm still on the scene. And I come to quicken you tonight to quicken the word to you. &gt;&gt; That you quit dwelling in the past and dwell in heavenly places &gt;&gt; cuz that's the believer's position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Notice we look here in Colossians 2 and verse 13. Colossians 2 verse 13 it says and you here it goes again you know Paul has a way of making things personal &gt;&gt; oh you know it's all wait let me get my pitchfork and pitch it to brother Timothy he needs this no you tonight &gt;&gt; Paul ain't dressing Timothy he's already addressed Timothy in another book &gt;&gt; but he's addressing you tonight he's saying and you being dead &gt;&gt; in your sins and uncircumcision visions of your flesh. Hath he quickened? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hath he made alive? Is anybody alive tonight? &gt;&gt; Oh, that was a week, &gt;&gt; man. And if you just only recall, if you can just be in the intensity of when you was a sinner and be thankful for what God had brought you from the life that he brought you from the things that you used to do, the desires that you used to crave. But God, rich in mercy, came by your way and he brought you a word and he quickened. What did he do? He quickened that predestinated seed that laid on the inside of you and he brought it to life. You never was alive until you've been quickened by the power of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Notice what it says. And you hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven all of your trespasses. [Music] &gt;&gt; All of them. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Notice what it says in verse 14, blotting out the handwriting of ordinance that was against you, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. So we have a common theme here in Colossians and in Ephesians. We find Paul telling us that without the spirit of God, you are not his. You're dead. &gt;&gt; But he don't leave you in a dead state. Somebody, he don't leave you the way he found you. But he quickens you. He makes you alive to believe the word, to respond to the word. Oh, you may be a good person, morally clean, attend church regularly, live godly, but without God's spirit, the Bible says you're none of his. &gt;&gt; So, we find Paul reminds us, he tells us, look what God has done for you. Some of y'all tonight need to look back and see what God's done for you. &gt;&gt; Look what he's done for you. Hath quickened you together with him, having forgiven. How many of you have ever had a debt forgiven? &gt;&gt; Oh, a handful of them, man. I bet you just like, "Oh, well, you know what? &gt;&gt; I appreciate that." &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. You get a debt forgiven. You jumping around like some idiot, &gt;&gt; man. You all on the black. Yeah. You calling people on the phone. Guess what? So and so just forgave me. I I can't believe in myself. Come on. &gt;&gt; And we come to the house of God. God done changed your life. God done forgave you of your sins. He done erased your past. And we sit there. We got a reason to shout. &gt;&gt; He blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that were against you. &gt;&gt; Blooding out means he obliterated. &gt;&gt; He erased it. He wiped it out. &gt;&gt; How'd he do it, brother? He put a blood on top of your sins and said, "No more &gt;&gt; no more &gt;&gt; will I be reminded of their sins. No more will I be reminded of the trespasses." &gt;&gt; The handwriting, that word there, it means a legal document &gt;&gt; that you signed. &gt;&gt; I accept this debt. And you know they say in the eastern custom that that debt whether it be worked off or paid for it was in effect until it was either canceled or forgiven. &gt;&gt; And look what Jesus did. The Bible says that he obliterated. He obliterated the handwriting. that binding document that had you bound by sin, bound by lust, bound by this and bound by that that that that family strain or that whatever that generational curse or that habit you were bound by. You couldn't break away from it. But the Bible says he forgave you. &gt;&gt; He forgave you. How did he do it? He nailed it to the cross. &gt;&gt; That's right. And in the Eastern custom for their name to be written off, it had to be struck off. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, somebody had to take something to write through it or they took a nail and nailed it through the name. &gt;&gt; Oh, church, we Gentiles, we were bound with a sin debt that we couldn't pay. &gt;&gt; We were headed to a devil's hell and a sinner's grave. But Jesus stepped in. Come on. What did it? He took your sins upon himself and he nailed it to the cross. &gt;&gt; So you didn't have to bear it. And tonight you don't have to bear it. You don't have to bear the memory of it. You don't have to bury or or or carry the scar of it. You don't have to carry any a part of it because it's been nailed. It's been struck off. It's been obliterated. All the handwriting, all the ordinance, every accusation, every charge against you. He said, "I dropped the charges tonight. &gt;&gt; I took the charges on myself and I nailed it to my cross. &gt;&gt; You had he quickened." &gt;&gt; So, how did he nail it to the cross? By his son. By the death. By the blood of the lamb. And by doing that, he quickens you. strikes that accusation against you off and makes you alive in Christ. &gt;&gt; Notice here, you had he quickened. What did he do? He destroyed your past. &gt;&gt; That's all you get out of that. &gt;&gt; He destroyed your past. You got, oh yeah, praise God. Oh, come on. Maybe you wonder why I shout so much. &gt;&gt; Cuz I got a bad past. &gt;&gt; And I ain't saying you got to be like me. You shout as much as you want to, but let me just tell you, if you just can remember, if you can just remind your Satan's done enough to remind you, but think about the grace of God to stepped in &gt;&gt; and blotted out everything against you. &gt;&gt; Some of you were going the wrong way. Some of you young people within even the last year were going the wrong way. But God stepped in, &gt;&gt; turned your life around. Some of you hoes, God stepped in and completely turned your families around. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God doesn't make mistakes. God is here to do what? To obliterate every ordinance, everything against you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He paid the debt. He obliterated the ordinances against us by nailing them to the cross. And today, notice, we are guiltless. Hear the words. &gt;&gt; You are guiltless. &gt;&gt; You are sinless. &gt;&gt; You are free. Come on, somebody. Enjoy your freedom tonight. You are free tonight. There are no binding agreements against you. There are no charges against you tonight. You have he quickened. &gt;&gt; What sin? &gt;&gt; Ask yourself, what sin? Oh, brother Joe, I woke up this morning. That's all I see. Well, can I tell you? You're looking through the wrong set of eyes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz when you look at yourself, you see, oh, poor old me. I make mistakes. I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have acted that way. &gt;&gt; Come on. Am I alone tonight? &gt;&gt; No. But when he looks at you, he looks at you through the blood of his son. And red through red is white. &gt;&gt; Let me just share what the prophet of God said about it. He said the Holy Ghost will always point to the word. If it points to a creed or denomination, it is not the Holy Ghost. He couldn't do that. Point away from the word when he died to confirm that word and make that word positive. And I want you to know evening light tabernacle that the word is as much positive tonight in 2025 as it was on the day he went to the cross. &gt;&gt; He is the quickening life that makes that word live again. &gt;&gt; He is not a man, not a thought, not an idea, but he is the quickly life that makes that word live again. That was his purpose of dying. that he could still project himself through his church. &gt;&gt; Why did he send a message? So that he could project himself in a body. &gt;&gt; See, he is the dynamics of the mechanics, the mechanics of the church. What is it? Apostles, prophets, preachers, teachers. He said he is the dynamics that works that. He said he is the fire that fires off the gas. He is the fire that's in the combustion chamber. Notice the gas, the word is poured over the combustion chamber. He's the one that sets her a fire. He's the one that confirms it. He's the power of the resurrection. He is God. He He is the fire. That's what he is. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't like all that fire. &gt;&gt; But he is fire. &gt;&gt; You better take that up with him. See, the Bible tells us in 1 Peter 4 and verse one, "For so much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind. For he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased, excuse me, from sin, that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of We're going to pick this up here. that he should no longer live the rest of his life in the flesh to the lust of men, but to the will of God. Remember the word will. Now, remember we spoke on that on Sunday. It's the purpose. It's the desire or it's the pleasure of God. Then we find in Romans 8, we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose, for whom he did forno. &gt;&gt; Notice those that were in his thinking, those that he forneew. &gt;&gt; He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. And to whom he called, he also justified. Whom he justified them, he also glorified. So we find again predestination looks back to fornowledge. But fornowledge looks to your destiny. God knows the seed that he placed in you. God knew the right place to put you. He knew the right age to put you in. He knew the right church to set you in. He knew the right family to place you in. God knows all this. And that's why you're here tonight. an even like tabernacle is so that that seed that predestined seging of God can be quickened by the word. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 and verse 12. Therefore, brother Oh, man. These T-Rex arms. Sorry about that. I ain't complaining. &gt;&gt; Long as I can hold a mic, we can preach. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we find here in Romans 8:12, therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh. &gt;&gt; To live after the flesh. For if we live after the flesh, we shall die. But if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live. For as many are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; And see, that's what the the theme of our preaching is to get you to realize, I am a son of God. I am a daughter of God. What we're telling you, you are the offspring of an eternal being tonight. You always was in God's thinking. Therefore, you always will be in God's thinking. &gt;&gt; You didn't just happen. You didn't just exist. You your parents didn't make a mistake. God predestinated you to be here. &gt;&gt; You have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear. &gt;&gt; I mean, what's the point of coming out of the world if you're going to still live a Christian life in fear? &gt;&gt; But you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Aba, Father. Oh my father, my father. See, the spirit itself, the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit &gt;&gt; that we are his children. &gt;&gt; And notice the next verse. And if children, then we're hes of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together. You know, you hear people they people that receive an inheritance. &gt;&gt; I don't have any rich relatives. I don't really understand all of this, but I'm just taking everybody else's example that has rich relatives. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, one day, Uncle Johnny's, no offense, it just slipped out. So, we're going to go with it. Rich, let's go. Let's go ahead and add adjectize it a little bit. That's not even a word, is it? I'm preaching. We're going to work with it tonight. Put that in Webster's dictionary. Agitize. Rich Uncle Johnny. Rich, goodlooking, swole Uncle Johnny. But Uncle Johnny passes away and he ain't he don't have any sons. He don't have any daughters. But what he has is nephew Joe. And there came a time that Uncle Johnny's will. It was time for the reading of the will. And guess who showed up? Cousin Joe or nephew Joe showed up for the reading of the wheel. I didn't know if I had anything in there. But when the wheel became open, when it the book became open and they began to read all that Uncle Johnny left to this one and to that one, I wasn't worried about who got this and who got that. I was only worried is my name in the wheel. And I want you to know tonight, Uncle Johnny put your name in the wheel tonight. It's in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. I went into that will reading with nothing. But I came out of there. &gt;&gt; I came out with riches. I came out with everything Uncle Johnny possessed. And he said, "I made you a joint air with Christ. &gt;&gt; You came into this world with nothing. But he yokeked you with Jesus Christ." And all of eternity belongs to you tonight. &gt;&gt; Because somebody read the wheel. &gt;&gt; Man, I walked out of that wheel reading. I didn't drag out. Man, I'm thinking I about to go buy something. I got money. I ain't never had money like this. Our father is rich with houses and lands. &gt;&gt; He owns the world. Oh my. Oh, you know the song Silver and Gold. We have riches untold. &gt;&gt; A cattle on a thousand heels. Come on. Recognize. recognize he's quickening this word to you &gt;&gt; to make you a part of it. &gt;&gt; If he didn't think about you, if Uncle Johnny didn't love little nephew Joe, he would have never wrote my name down. &gt;&gt; But he thought of you. &gt;&gt; He thought of you before you came to the altar. He thought of you before you made your first mistake. He thought of you and he put your name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. And all we ready to do, church, is read the will. Read the purpose of God. What is his purpose? To quicken that seed, to quicken that life. To call sons and daughters to himself. But many times we look at ourselves. We look through the veil of this humanity and we got mistakes. We don't measure up. Satan's there to remind us of our failures, our shortcomings. Well, you shouldn't have said this. Well, duh. Or you shouldn't have acted that way. I know. I'm not a dummy. And we just constantly berate oursel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to preach to the wall cuz I me and the wall have an understanding. &gt;&gt; You know the way that I take you, right? Sometimes it's not the right way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we have to come back to the word of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; How many times we're reminded of our mistakes? Satan is there to constantly remind you you're a sinner. You failed here. You failed there. You did this here. You did that there. &gt;&gt; But no matter how you see yourself, if you can only see yourself through the eyes that he sees, you &gt;&gt; see, he sees the thought that he had of you before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that once those sins that we have that they're confessed into the blood of Jesus Christ, God don't even see them, nor does he know anything about it. &gt;&gt; The God that we serve, church, is so big. He's omniresent, omnisient, all knowing. But when you confess your sins into that blood, he don't even know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; That's a God. You remember, you're reminded and it comes up every day and you look at this or you hear a song or you you smell a fragrance, it reminds you of something that you shouldn't have done, but to God, he don't know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; He said, "He, the bridegroom, took away your shame." Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Took away your shame, put it in the sea of forgiveness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life. your first husband that you were married to the world, the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water. The church now listen, he says that don't sound right. You might not find that in an almanac, but not in God's Bible. By the washing of the water of the word in the word, not the church. &gt;&gt; Well, I belong to even like tabernacle, not the church. I go to Tim Pruis church. He's my pastor. Not the church. You got to be washed by the washing of the water of the word. &gt;&gt; And not just this word, but the anointed word for this hour. &gt;&gt; Notice what he says in invisible union. And I was getting to this on Sunday. You are standing completely justified as though you never did it in the beginning. This is my message to the church now. You're standing complete, justified like you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Oh, some of y'all need to hear that. &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Where? When I was five, when I was four, when this happened to me, when that happened to me, when I was 13 and 14, or when I got married, or when I when I went to that bar? No. The first place &gt;&gt; was in God's thinking. See, and God's thinking you're perfect. And God's thinking you're pure. And God's thinking you're sinless. And God's thinking you're free. This is what a pro. This is a prophet. He's coming down. Now, remember, I I told you this past Sunday that he tapped into the back part of God's mind to bring out God's purpose and will to us. But he's also telling us how God feels about you. &gt;&gt; And here we find he says, "You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born are quickened of the spirit of God. Now, I put that word there. The quote doesn't have that, but just so we don't get it all sniffed on the internet and somebody sent it around the world that I added something to it. This ain't the Bible. We ain't adding to this, but we are adding to the quote here just a little bit. And he said, "Now the spirit of God washed in the blood of Jesus and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned in the first place. You are perfect." I know you're like, "Oh, I'm shocked." &gt;&gt; Yeah, we all shocked. &gt;&gt; Not because you're perfect, but because we're perfect. &gt;&gt; Notice what he goes on. You're standing completely. You never sin at the first place. God don't even know nothing. It's in the sea of forgiveness. You never did it. You were accused of it by the accuser. But really, from the beginning, you were the predestinated to be a son and daughter of God. And you're standing there washed. Your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead. Absolutely out of existence. &gt;&gt; Come on. Everything, brother Joe, that I ever done, everything that you ever done is out of existence tonight. Not even in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Not even God don't even know about it. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he says, "We're hes of God, joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we also may be glorified together." So an heir is a person legally entitled &gt;&gt; to property. Thank you, Uncle Johnny. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm legally entitled because I'm a part of my father. So don't get mad at me if I pass off the scene and I leave my kids an inheritance. &gt;&gt; They're my kids. &gt;&gt; Nor should you get mad if God choose to bless somebody else in your church. &gt;&gt; They're an heir. &gt;&gt; Rejoice with them. &gt;&gt; Say hallelujah. Bless God. He's still in the blessing business tonight. &gt;&gt; And somebody needs to recognize it's your season. You've gone through the winters. You've gone through the falls. You've gone through those hard times. But now it's your season to be blessed by the word, to be quickened by the spirit of God. It's your season to rise up from that calamity and be that son and that daughter that God always chose you to be. &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Bam says here. God can no more deny you than he can deny himself. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody get nasty with the devil tonight. God can't deny you tonight &gt;&gt; cuz he can't deny himself. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I feel like preaching tonight. Woo. &gt;&gt; When you say, "Oh, brother Joe, the devil got me." Listen what your prophet said about that. He says, "For you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God." &gt;&gt; You are dead. Dead people don't argue. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna say that again. &gt;&gt; Dead people don't argue. Dead people don't criticize &gt;&gt; dead people they do sleep &gt;&gt; right in church dead people they don't argue they don't criticize they don't complain they don't fuss they don't backbite dead people don't there ain't no life in a dead person &gt;&gt; he said and you were dead &gt;&gt; I want you to understand Paul's teaching here Paul is not saying yet you're still dead. Paul is constantly saying were past tense, past tense, past tense. &gt;&gt; But your life is hid, concealed, kept secret in God through Christ or with Christ in God. You say, "Brother Brandom, the devil got me." No, the devil didn't. You went out to the devil. That's right. &gt;&gt; You see young people, they know they they come up and they make a move or people make a move and they constantly make a move and they go back and the devil got me. &gt;&gt; Said, "No, you went out to the devil. The devil can't get you for you are dead." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What is he saying? That this humanity is dead to the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Dead people won't argue and fuss and backbite. You're dead and your life is hidden God through Christ and you're sealed there by the Holy Ghost. How can the devil get you &gt;&gt; if you're hid in God through Christ? How can the devil get you? Quit blaming God for your mistakes. Quit blaming the devil when you keep going out to him. It's time that you die to this humanity and be quickened. &gt;&gt; Made a lie by the power of God. &gt;&gt; See, the devil can't get you as long as you're in Christ. You're sheltered by the blood. The blood hides you. It conceals you. Psalms 32:7 it says, "Thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance." In Psalms 119 and verse 14, "Thou art my hiding place, my shield. I hope in thy word." So a hiding place is a shelter. &gt;&gt; It's where the enemy can't get. It's a city of refuge that the avenger of blood has no access. He can only pierce over the wall. &gt;&gt; He can only peep through the hole of the door, but he is not granted access &gt;&gt; because you're in a city of refuge. And Christ is our hiding place. He is our refuge. How do you get in there? The Bible tells us by one spirit. He says, not by one letter are we joined into that body. Not by one denomination are we brought into that body, but by one spirit are we baptized by the Holy Spirit baptism into that body. &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to turn a corner here. Leviticus 23 and verse 9. We're going to we're going to turn a corner. We're going to come back. We're going to try to crash land this thing in about 35 minutes. Y'all don't hold me to that. That's just wishful thinking. But he says now, "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, when you have come into the land which I give unto you, that you shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheep of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest, and he shall wave the sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you on the tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it." So the land that they were given was a natural land &gt;&gt; is a land that flowed with milk and honey. And milk and honey was the diet of kings. So God had already pre-ordained pre pre-planned their land. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where to place him. He could have put them anywhere in the not the United States, but he could have put them there too. But he could have put them anywhere in the world. And he carved out a little bitty land called Israel. &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is your land. I have predetermined you to stay in this land. It's a great land. It's a land that flows with milk and honey. And he says, when you get into that land and you grow your harvest, I want you to pull the very first ones from that harvest, take it to the high priest, and let them wave it as a a wave offering or a sheep offering. What was it representing? That there was going to be more to come out of that harvest. And what has God done in this day? He's given you and I as the believer, we're coming into our homeland, our promised land. It ain't the land of denominations. It's the land of the opening of the word where all the miracles are there. All the Holy Ghost is there. All the healing is there. Everything that we have need of is in that land. &gt;&gt; But take it to the priest. Take it to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Oh, let him open it up. Take it to him. Let him wave it. Notice, not on the Sabbath, but on the day after the Sabbath, which is the Sunday, &gt;&gt; the su n day. And brother Rab says it's no longer the su n day. It's a dual sun rising. It's the s o n day. &gt;&gt; Oh, he says just in the beginning in Genesis there when the s so o n rose and it brought botney life. Everything that ever lived had to live by that life. He says the same way for us. We don't live here without the s in life rising again. Church, I'm here to tell you, it's the rising of the sun. He has risen in this hour. He has come in this age to to quicken a bride to quicken up people to have eternal life. &gt;&gt; But a wave offering, a sheath offering, what was he doing? But notice, brother B would tell us not only the su n rising, it's the s o n rising to bring eternal life to all of God's promised seed that by fornowledge he had seen laying upon the earth. Said he waved over the promised seed that had promise of life, not just any seed. So the sun rose, brother Timothy, and we know how it is in Louisiana. It gets hot. It gets nasty hot. But that sun doesn't ride to quicken the dirt. &gt;&gt; That sun doesn't rise to quicken the rocks. But the sun rises to quicken the seed. And the rocks will cry, "Oh, this is too hot. This is too I'm leaving Louisiana." The dirt will cry, "Oh, I'm so sick of this humidity. My goodness, I hate Louisiana." But that predestinated seed said, "That's just what I'm looking for. I need the word. I need the sun. I need the ministry. I need it. I don't care if it's the only thing in Louisiana. Let me have more of it. It's the rising of the sun to quicken that predestinated seed." &gt;&gt; And some of you moved in here just so that seed can be quickened. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that you wasn't in good ground. But you wasn't in where he wanted you to blossom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But notice, I love what he says here. Ephesians 1 and verse three. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places, according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy without blame before him in love. So God, it's God's choosing. So don't get upset. God chooses &gt;&gt; and God gives who he wants. &gt;&gt; See, God picks out. God chooses. God doesn't choose. Brother Timothy, like man chooses. I've told y'all my story in my kickball years. Little fat roly pololy. Little kickball Joe don't get picked first. They don't pick fat slow people. I'm not picking on fat slow people tonight. But you don't get picked first in a kickball game. Or remember y'all y'all ever played dodgeball? &gt;&gt; Yeah, you got to move quick. &gt;&gt; Look, I'm here to tell you, I wasn't the fastest thing on the block, but I nailed a few guys in my day. &gt;&gt; But I was picked last. But God don't choose us the way we choose us. &gt;&gt; See, we look at tall, dark, and handsome. Not everybody can be brother Johnny. &gt;&gt; Goodlook man. Tall, dark, and handsome. Some of us are short, balding. Come on, Brother Tom. Give me an amen. Cute. Oh, yeah. We'll throw that on in there. But see, you put me and Brother Johnny together, y'all going to choose him. He's bowed up. He's big and bad. And hey, I'm choosing him over me myself. &gt;&gt; But see, God don't choose that way. &gt;&gt; See, God looks at the heart of a man. He's looking for that predestinated seed that he placed there. Is that the one? And if it is, he's going to quicken it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If it ain't the one, he's going to move on by, &gt;&gt; but he's going to quicken. And the Bible says, "All that the father has given me shall come, and I will in no wise lose one." &gt;&gt; So don't worry. God ain't losing. &gt;&gt; Notice, man, we look on our outward stature. How tall, how strong, how smart, how good-looking. But God looks on the heart. And before there was a world, you were in God's stalls to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew that you would be wanting it. I say, "Thanks be to God today. That's why I'm here. That's why I'm in Louisiana. That's why I'm part of Elite Tabernacle. Because I want the Holy Ghost. I want the quickening power. I want the anointed word. I want everything that God has for me. If it means I got to come to this place, I'm going to stay here and get everything that God has predestinated for me to have. And God doesn't choose you to lose you. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to write that down. &gt;&gt; That popped in my head today. I said, "That's for somebody." &gt;&gt; God don't choose you to lose you. &gt;&gt; He don't quicken you, make you alive only to let you die. That's right. &gt;&gt; In John 15 and verse 16, he said, "You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask the father in my name that he may give it." So God doesn't choose us to lose us and we don't choose him. &gt;&gt; It's all God's doing. Therefore, no man can get all puffed up and say, "I did this." &gt;&gt; No man can say, "This is my ministry. Look at me and my gift and my min." It's not yours. &gt;&gt; It's God's. &gt;&gt; And God placed it there. &gt;&gt; Brother saying Jehovah Gyro number one, he says, "So you're He goes, you're chosen chosen at all." &gt;&gt; But what about my past? I don't care about your past. You were chosen before the foundation of the world or you wasn't chosen at all. &gt;&gt; So why are you here? &gt;&gt; I want you to ask yourself that question. Why am I here? Not just at evening like tabernacle, but why are you here? Why are you in this hour? Why are you in this age? Why are you in Louisiana? Why are you here? &gt;&gt; Because God chose you to be here. Therefore, that means that God has something for you. Not just to live in your past, not just to live in defeat, not just to live in your failures, but God chose you to quicken you and make you alive by the word. &gt;&gt; He chose you before the foundation of the world or you wasn't chosen at all. And he just come to redeem that name. All those names that are that are not on the lamb's book of life. He says, "But before the foundation world is the only ones, I think he meant to say all those names who are on the lamb's book of life before the foundation world are the only ones that's going to be there." Anyhow, &gt;&gt; only those question answers 1959. You'll love this. He says, "Isn't it wonderful that he loved you?" &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; He loved you. He loved you before there was a world. He knows your nature, Justin. &gt;&gt; He knew all about it. He knows your weaknesses, David. There's probably a few of them. He knows your habits, Joseph. Notice, he knowed all about you, what you was going to be. And then when he looked over all the great universe as it was, he says, "I choose you. I choose you. &gt;&gt; He could have chose the morally perfect. He could have chose the high and mighty, the wise and prudent. But he looked at your weaknesses. He looked at your failures. He looked at your past or the things that you would do. And he says, "I choose you anyway. &gt;&gt; I choose you despite your past." Oh, when you receive the Holy Ghost, then you become eternal because you're with God. You're part of God. You can see what I mean. See, you're as eternal as God is because you are. And then he tells us here in 1 John 5 and verse 10, he says, "He that believeth on me or on the Son of God hath the witness in himself. He that believeth not God had made him out a liar because he believeth not the record that God give his son." And this is the record that God has given us eternal life. And this life is in the Son. And he that hath the son hath life. And he that hath not the son hath not life. And in the church age, brother B tells us this is the record. God has given us eternal life. And the life is in his son. He that hath the son hath life eternal. He that hath not the son hath not life eternal. And those who that are he says and those who had that life were in him before the foundation of the world. They were the chosen in before the foundation of the world. The great royal seed Jesus Christ was planted. He died and that that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in a multitude of other wheat seeds &gt;&gt; having the same life in them. So all that the father has given us or given him will come. And the Bible tells us in revelations 3 and verse 5, he that overcomemeth the same shall be clothed in white raignnt. And I will not blot his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my father and his holy angels. So he will blot out the handwritings and the ordinance against you, but he will not blot your name out of that book. &gt;&gt; But he will blot out all the accusations against you. &gt;&gt; See, what a God we serve. all the charges, &gt;&gt; all the sins, all the mistakes, all the ordinances, all the binding agreements &gt;&gt; that you put your hand to, he blotss it out. But he will not blot your name out of that book to him that overcomemeth. And he says, "And I will confess his name before my father and for his angels." That word confess there means he will celebrate. So God's not ashamed of you. He's not ashamed of your past. He's not ashamed to call you son. He's not ashamed to call you redeemed. He's not ashamed to call you his child. See all those that he's chosen. God's not ashamed of that seed. He's not ashamed of the chosen. He's not ashamed of those that are elected. That's why he come is to quicken that and raise up a bride in the midst of Satan's Eden. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will openly and joyfully celebrate your name &gt;&gt; in front of your enemy. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Somebody need to get your dancing shoes on. &gt;&gt; Polish them up a little bit. &gt;&gt; He will openly and joyfully confess your name before your enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us here in Revelations 20:15, look what it says about those whose names are not written in the book of life. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; So not everybody has their name pinned in this book. And then Jesus tells them in Luke 10 and verse 19, he says, "Behold, I give you power to dread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy. And nothing shall by any means hurt you. Not withstanding in this. Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven." &gt;&gt; Don't rejoice because you can do this and you can do that. Oh, I've done this and I've done this in your name. He says, don't rejoice in those things. Don't rejoice that you can do all the supernatural and you got speaking in tongues and healing and all that, but rejoice because your name is written in the lamb's book of life. And if your name was written inside that book, there ain't enough devils in hell that can take your name off of that book. There ain't enough trials, ain't enough past, ain't enough mistakes that can ever blot your name off of it. But almighty God has pinned your name there with the indelible ink of the blood of Jesus Christ. And nothing can take it off. He said he was waved. He was waved at the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a wave, like a wave in mighty rushing wind. He was waved over the people, the Pentecostal people that was up there at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and notice and to be waved again. We realize in the last day according to Luke 17:30 in the son of in the in the sun day again in the day that the sen man will be revealed are waved again he said the word lith for this day fulfilling this promise when the son of man shall be revealed the days of Sodom all these things promised here it is the word of God being revealed it's the word itself discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart what is it it's the word of God what we've seen in this hour was the waving of that sheath that there was one that went into that land of the Holy Ghost, that land of the token promise where the indwelling, the presence, the person of Jesus Christ himself came and tabernacled one. What was it saying? There's going to be more that receive that message and they're going to produce the very same life. &gt;&gt; It ain't just for one man ministry. It ain't just for the preachers. It ain't just for the deacons. It's for whosoever will. I'm waving the word, the opening of the word over the people, over that predestinated seed that was predestinated for life. &gt;&gt; That's why the message came is to quicken. &gt;&gt; You hath he quickened. &gt;&gt; He's declaring that there's more coming. &gt;&gt; Look around. There's empty seats, but there's more coming. &gt;&gt; Why couldn't he come in Paul's day? Because your name was in the book. &gt;&gt; Why couldn't he come at year 2000 when we thought, "Oh, Y 2K, it's all going to end." Because some of your names were in the book. &gt;&gt; Every name in that book will be quickened. That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me start bringing this down. My my my This is should have preached this on Sunday. Y'all ain't got to agree with me so loud. He said Christ was the first one to rise or to raise from all the prophets and so forth. Although typed in many places, he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church. There will be a sheath waved again in the last days. The first time there came forth the bride age for the resurrection out of dark denominations will be a message that for the full maturity of the word has turned back again to full power being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there. &gt;&gt; And people don't want the supernatural. People don't want the the miraculous in their church. Well, you don't want the wave sheath waving over because what he did then, he's doing it again today. And I'm not talking he is in William Brown. I'm talking about he is in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's being waved over the people in the supernatural. Romans 8 and verse 19, it says, "For the earnest expectation of the creature waitth for the manifestation of the sons of God." Verse 22. And we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which had the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves, we grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to the change or the redemption of our bodies. He said the messenger of Malachi 4 will appear at God's appointed time. We are looking for him. We believe he will come. This is according to his word. It will be at the end time, which is the time now for to see it. He will be correctly dedicated to the word as they have always been dedicated or indicated by God's word and vindicated. God will vindicate what he preaches to be the truth as he did Elijah. For is Elijah coming making ready the Mount Zion rapture. So he says Jesus said in the last days it will be like it was in last time his preaching will be with the spirit and strength of the line of God's word because so much has been called God's truth. Many are misunderstanding the true messenger. But the first forerunner came from the widows and he cried, "Behold the lamb." The second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word bride. &gt;&gt; Notice church, this ministry, this message was never about William Brandon, but it's always been about a word bride. Get me a bride. Come on. Go Elijah and get me a bride for my my my son Isaac. Go get her a wife. Get her one. Don't just get her from anywhere, but get her from the family. Get her from one that's got representation from eternal life. Get her one that was in my thoughts before the foundation of the world. Get my son a bride. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't trust his plan just to anybody. So, he had to vindicate a prophet. Musicians, if you would come, I'm going to start closing down. Galatians 4. Y'all hanging on with me? You good? &gt;&gt; All right. Good. Now, I say Ephesians or Galatians, excuse me, Galatians 4 and verse one. Y'all live enough. Just give me about 10 minutes. We're going to parachute out. And I know I'm not brother Juel, but we're going to parachute anyway. &gt;&gt; Now I say that the heir, how many is there? &gt;&gt; I want to see a show of hands. &gt;&gt; All right, that's good. Y'all participation 100%. Now I say that the heir, &gt;&gt; nephew Johnny, nephew Joe, has a long as he is a child differ from a servant, though he be lord of all. Notice what he says. Now the heir, as long as he is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all, though he's entitled, &gt;&gt; but there's got to have something, something's got to transfer. &gt;&gt; So he says, now buddies under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. For even so, when we were children, we were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that that he might or that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, aba, father. Wherefore thou no more a servant, but a son? And if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. And we're going to pick this up here out of verse five. Just start playing something if you would, something soft maybe, however you feel led. But he says, notice, to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons. And that phrase there, adoption of son, means it's the placing of sons. It's placing them into a position of authority. It means that your name on the check is just as good as a father's name. &gt;&gt; That means you can sign it without worrying about it being rejected. &gt;&gt; Joseph and I share the same name. Joseph Marian Adams. Joseph Marian Adams. His name better never write a check in my checkbook, but his name is just as good as mine. So we find here this phrase adoption, the placing of sons. And when God quickens you with the baptism of the Holy Spirit, what is he doing? He's placing you &gt;&gt; placing you into a position of authority &gt;&gt; that your name that what you say he's going to back it &gt;&gt; your name whatever you ask the father in my name &gt;&gt; I'll give it to you so we find here I did a little research on adoption. And there is a term out there called disownment. This term disownment is a term used when a parent when they renounce or no longer accept accept the responsibility to care for a child. Disownment is the act of formally renouncing, denying, or refusing to acknowledge a connection with someone or something, ceasing to be responsible for them, or no longer accepting them as one's own. To disown someone means to formally and definitely severize with them, renouncing any connection, any responsibility, or any association with them. So you as a parent tonight, you can disown your child. Maybe they're bad. Maybe they've done something. Maybe they shamed a family name. You can disown them. Oh, but it works differently for an adopted child. See, an adopted child, that's a legal binding agreement. &gt;&gt; And what does that adoption do? See the word here, the adoption creates a permanent legal parent child relationship. And once finalized, adoption grants the adoptive parents the same legal rights and responsibilities as a biological parent. And this relationship is intended to be permanent. And though you can disown that natural child, there is no legal no way that you can disown an adopted child. There's no legal process that you can go through once you've been adopted. You can never Hallelujah. You can never be unadopted. You can never be unadopted. There's not enough legal red tape. There's not a great enough lawyer out there that can sign the pardon to unadopt you. &gt;&gt; There's no legal process. And if that is true in the natural, I said, if that's true in the natural, &gt;&gt; what about the spiritual tonight? Can I tell you tonight, you've been quickened. You've been adopted. And if you've ever been adopted, church, tonight, I don't care what kind of past you have. It don't matter what your past is. If you've been adopted, he will not unadopt you tonight. He's chosen you. He's called you. He's elected you. And he's quickened you. And he's quickened you. You belong to him tonight. You belong to him. You have to quicken. See, there's a term that they call rehome. See, Satan tries to rehome an adopted child, &gt;&gt; but that's illegal. [Music] See, you can't rehome. Some of you here, I know some of you been adopted. You've gone through the legal process, but you can't be rehomed. It's illegal. &gt;&gt; There's a there's a permanent binding agreement with you and that adopted family. And I'm here to tell you, Satan don't have enough rights to rehome you tonight. &gt;&gt; He don't have enough authority to rehome you tonight. You belong to none other than almighty God. He's quickened you, placed you in the family. And he says, I will not lose one all that the father has given to me. I've placed them in my family. I quicken them with power. I'll anoint them with healing. I will anoint them with deliverance. I anoint them with the opening of the word. I will give them power. &gt;&gt; I tread on serpents and nothing by any means will harm them. You, Sister Jenny, you hath he quickened. Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; Think about it. You, Caleb, quickened. Some of you've wrestled and wrestled and wrestled for years. But I'm here to tell you, he told me to tell you tonight, you had to quickened. quickened, &gt;&gt; made alive, brought to life, who were who was dead in sins and trespasses. God bless you tonight, church. Remember, you had he quickened. Quit looking at your past. Look to what he's done for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have come in, you may have been a drunk, you may have been a prostitute, you may have done all these things, but look what he's done for you, changed your nature, changed your dress, changed your attitude, changed your appearance, quickening power. God bless you. Come on, brother Timothy. Let's lead us in some songs of worship tonight. You make it personal. You have he quickened. I'm alive tonight. I'm not dead in sins anymore. I'm not going to be reminded of my past anymore. I'm going to rejoice in what God has done for me. I'm going to sing praises to his name. I'm going to shout hallelujah to his name. If he wants me to dance, I'll dance. If he wants me to worship, I'm going to worship. If he wants me to shout, I'm going to shout. I'm no longer dead. But there's life in my lungs. There's joy in my spirit. There's hallelujah in my body. I believe, Lord, I've been quickened for this moment. I'll be changed. You has equened church, bride of Jesus Christ, rise up and take your position as adopted sons of God. Going to turn up my praise and drown out the dark. Holding my shield of faith and I feel no alarm. When the enemy comes in like a flood, I will raise up my standard and overcome. Oh s, can you hear me? This light is for you.

His light will shine. God is good. Well, God is good all the time. and we were sinners and so unworthy. Still for us, he chose to die. He filled us with his holy spirit.
