amen amen he be turned into psalms chapter 42 if you would amen just like to say it's good to be in the house of the lord amen we uh have something here is very wonderful as a a book that's been printed by brother john lay and some of his family sister marie and different ones is the messiah if you'd like to have that to look at it to read it's very wonderful message one i've listened to actually a couple of times in the last few months and and uh but they've uh printed it and i believe it's there on the library counter if you'd like to have one he's bought a printer to do some outreach and things and and if anyone's interested in helping with that he would be sure be sure and talk to him and speak to him about it amen also would like you to remember me and brother tim in prayer we'll be leaving in the morning to go to canada to edmonton and do the memorial service for brother hildebrandt our i mean as for his family there in the church church body there and also minister there on sunday and then take a few days and go through the mountains and over to vancouver so we're going to be gone a few weeks and so we just ask that you would remember us in prayer amen yes the cloverdale bible way for their 50th it happens to be same year as ours but their 50th anniversary as well and ministering there at that meeting amen commemorating amen that great milestone for that church so amen we've got a we got a lot to be thankful for in the time that we're living in and and i'm thankful that we can move around again and go to different places and and minister to hearts and needs of god's people and so amen god bless you tonight let's look at this uh this scripture reading here psalms chapter 42 and verse 7 says deep calleth unto the deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy waves and thy billows are going over me yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto god unto the god of my life i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy as with a sword in my bones my enemies reproach me while they say dale unto me where is thy god why art thou cast down on my soul why art thou disquieting within me hope thou and god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god amen we let you be seated we know this is a scripture reading that brother branham would pull deep calleth to the deep from and i would like to speak to you tonight on a thought a kind of a more or less a continuation of where we was last wednesday but the light has brought you to where you are amen the light has brought you to where you are amen so we we see here brother brown would talk about the deep that call us into the deep there has to be a deep to respond or there's something that draw there's a drawing power there's something that's pulling and and he would he would bring out the the man simeon there that sat in the temple and he had been given a revelation of god that to into his heart that he would not see death until he saw the christ and so he was there looking for that and he said he said he had that there laying there that promise that was in his heart and he said the holy spirit now we know the holy spirit is the the pillar of fire is the the logos the the the light of god the holy spirit has promised you something he says then you must expect him to back up what he said and to bring it to pass he says it's up to the holy spirit to see that you're led to it it's up to the holy spirit to see that you're led to it he says how many is expecting a revival he said well maybe this is the time he's led you to that you couldn't have that desire for revival unless there was revival to be had amen so and then and then if there's a promise of that a promise to you then the holy spirit is going to make sure that you're led to that place and to that spot amen he says how many have been expecting healing he says all right well there has to be a fountain open for your healing amen and then the holy spirit is there to make sure that you're led to where you need to be he says look david said when the deep calleth in the deep he said if there's a deep calling on the inside there's got to be a deep somewhere to respond to that call see what i mean he says how he says you know you said before there was a fish or a fin on a fish back there had to be water first for him to swim in or he would never had a fin before there would be a tree to grow in the earth there had to be earth first or there never would have been a tree to grow in it he said you know he talks about that little boy and we've heard the story about gnawing off the erasers and and school of his pencils and and he'd even gnaw off the pedals on his bicycle and they took him to doctors and clinics and blood tests and things and to check him out and they found out that there was something lacking in his body that his body was craving sulfur and and indians and there had there had been a sulfur a deficiency in his body and so that crave caused that caused the deep to call and he said only way that could be there there had to be sulfur to fulfill that call in other words there had there before there was a creation there had to be a creator to create the creation he said now if you're thirsting for more of god he says how many would like to have more of god he said this shows you there's more of god for you to have hallelujah amen so and so looking at that the light will lead you to the place that you need to be amen it says you so just as sure as you believe that there's that god is a healer there's a fountain open somewhere for that healing or you would never have that desire oh what a promise amen amen i cannot have a desire for healing unless there's a healing to be had and we know the promises of god are laying there in the bible for that therefore that bible is a fountain that's been opened amen a stream of life has been available for us and the holy spirit will make sure you're at the right place at the right time to receive that promise if that's what you're expecting to receive just like simon you know he no doubt maybe in his mind he thought well i'll just go back up there to the temple and thought it was just another day as usual but this was not just another day as usual this was the day that the messiah was going to come into the temple and so the light was making sure he was there to receive the promise hallelujah amen i i got to thinking about that as a as just one man but now there's a bride body here on the earth that's also looking for the return of the messiah amen you think it might be just another day as usual and things are going on and all kind of stuff is happening all stuff around us has fallen apart but the light is preparing you to receive the messiah the light is preparing you to receive amen the coming of the lord jesus christ otherwise if you we couldn't have that desire for the coming of the lord if there wasn't a coming of the lord amen there's something in us that's pulsating and pulling us to the place where we need to be amen he said the holy spirit is obligated it was obligated to lead simon to that place to that fountain he said if you're expecting it the holy spirit is obligated to lead you to the same place it's got to open up somewhere he said if you've got a burning desire in your heart the holy spirit is obligated to lead you to it right to the fount and filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath the flood and lose all their unbelief and their guilty state you want to be a place where you can surpass any doubt of your mind don't you don't want to be that way well there's a fountain somewhere that'll do it you're searching for it you're searching for it but there is a place that will fulfill that desire he said every promise in the book belongs to us so you're searching for it that if it was close to you and it was close to simeon it but it was the holy spirit's obligation to lead him to the place where christ was that's the holy spirit's obligation hallelujah so you're desiring something for god well the holy spirit's got a job also he's got an obligation he's going to make sure that desire does not go unfulfilled he's going to make sure that desire is fulfilled whether it be a revival whether it be a holy ghost whether it be a healing whether it be a deliverance whatever it is you have need of the holy ghost is obligated to lead you to the place the light of almighty god to lead you to the place where you can receive from the fountain of god he said if you believe in healing it's the holy spirit's obligation to lead you to that fountain you don't have to he said you don't have to get him but he will lead you up show you but if you're seeking it you'll get in if you're seeking the holy spirit and the holy spirit will lead you right up to the place where you can receive the holy ghost if you'll just let him lead you he said i can hear the holy ghost in the room that morning with simeon say stand up where you want me to go lord not for you to know just keep walking and here he come don't know where he's going he's just walking walks out of the room he said just keep walking simeon just keep walking simeon what's this about lord just keep walking what must i do just keep walking i'm leading you i'm leading you to the place to where you can receive your promise hallelujah are you willing to let him do that amen to take your mind to take your heart to take everything you have amen let the mind that was in christ be in you don't criticize if you can't understand it look it up in scriptures and see if it's right or not but just keep walking just keep going on with god he is leading you amen i want you to understand we give too much credit to the devil he's not led you anywhere the light has led you to where you are he has led you to the place that you can receive something from god amen he's led you to the place to where you can receive the truth of this hour amen your complex didn't lead you your doubts didn't lead you your fears didn't lead you the light of the holy ghost has led you to the place where you are [Applause] amen he says he walks over to this line of women he said it might have been two or three hundred standing there and i can see him walking the line and he was saying his heart lord you told me one day the holy ghost came upon me and made known many things you've never felt me i don't know what you want with me this morning but you just keep telling me to walk and i'm walking and after a while as soon as his eyes fell upon that little woman all them standing back like borderline believers you know standing back on the side days of miracles are passed and so forth you know to to a hungry heart that's been led by god you know where it's at when you find it you know they've arrived somewhere so simeon when he got up close to where that baby was i can just see that old sage and those big glistening tears start coming down his bearded cheeks and reach over and grab that baby in his arms and said oh what a feeling this is this morning lord now let that servant depart in peace according thy words for my eyes have seen thy salvation the very thing that everybody else was criticizing and making fun that's thy salvation let thy servant now depart in peace according to your word i'm ready to go now for my eyes have seen what you have brought me to see oh my way back over in the corner was another woman another little woman another woman a little woman named and and i believe it was and the spirit of the lord fell upon her blind as she can be but the light of god led her to where she could receive the promise hallelujah raise up and here she came through the temple blind physically but she could see a lot further than many of them standing there with good eyes hallelujah she could see greater things in them that could see with eyes they could see the walls they could see the floor they could see everything around it but that's not what she was looking at she was looking at that whirling ball of fire that was leading her to the promise hallelujah she came straight to where the baby was and she raised her up in her hands and blessed god and blessed mary and prophesied there before them that child would be for a fallen arising many in israel and the sword that would pierce the heart and how the prophets had said it take place and that old blind man could be a that old blind woman could be led to that spot without natural eyes that's what the holy ghost can do he can lead you to where you need to be hallelujah i remember another blind woman in our day there was a little blind black girl that was caught in a big crowd and she was crying out i want to see the healer i need my father crying out and crying out hey man brother branham had just come from a real miracle that taken place and he hears her cry and he said you know what i just kind of got over there and i stepped in her way on purpose i love that god knows how to get in your way on purpose he knows how to lead you to where you need to be you might be heading the wrong direction but he knows how to get in your way i saw he knew about it he was going the wrong way all the way down damascus gonna go persecute and pray and put him people in jail that was preaching the lord jesus christ and he was going the wrong direction but a light led him to where he needed to be hallelujah and this is where she was this little blind girl and she comes to a place she bumps up against the prophet and she begins to say something to him and he begins to talk to her and we know the story amen he begins to tell her who he is and she grabs a hold of him and she says i'm not going to let you go there was something in her that desired something and now she was at the place to where she would receive it and she wasn't going to miss her opportunity and she grabbed a hold of it and she said if you'll give me to the healer i'll find my daddy what was it it was the light and led her to this place a blind person a blind woman can be led to that spot without natural eyes to see that fountain filled with blood how much more ought to he ought he to be able to lead you tonight that's good got good sight to the cross that can see with your spiritual eyes don't look for the applause of the world you won't have it but be willing to sacrifice your precious everything to yours sacrifice it to the kingdom of god sacrifice your time for prayer sacrifice your life sacrifice your old card game sacrifice you put whatever you want to put there sacrifice all things of the world give it over to the devil i love that give it over to let him have it it belongs to him let's walk with jesus let's walk with the pillar of fire we are a people that are led by the pillar of fire listen it wasn't it wasn't moses's idea that was leading the children of israel down to the red sea it happened to be a pillar of fire that led them there and the pillar of fire never was lost he never took a wrong turn he never had to use his voice recalculating he was making every turn on purpose he was moving in every direction he moved on purpose he said i'm doing it for a reason because i want pharaoh to heart by his heart to harden i want him to say the children of israel entangled in the wilderness and he's going to come after you but it was the light that led them into the valley it was a light that led them to the place of pharaoh's destruction it was the light that led them there it wasn't their feelings amen if they went on their own feelings that it went back to egypt but they were following the light amen anyway you wonder why david think about this i was thinking about this other day as this thought began to come on my heart after i preached wednesday night on thursday began to think some of these thoughts actually texted them to a few friends and i said you know david got up that morning and he thought it was just another day thought there was nothing really maybe he knew there was a battle going on but he'd been tending father's sheep and his father got up and all of a sudden he had something come on his heart and said you know what get david and make a few things for his brother send him down there to the battle so they'll make sure they got something to eat on his mind it was nothing but just something to eat but if you'd have looked a little deeper than that and looked with some spiritual eyes there would have been a challenge that had been going on by the devil and listen now god hears every enemy's challenge he hears every enemy's challenge and he's willing to accept the challenge amen amen there was a pillar of fire that had been leaked listen they got into the promised land but that didn't mean the pillar of fire left it showed up many times through the bible amen it was there with manoa at the altar it was there with elijah it was there through many of the prophets and all the many judges you can read about the pillar of fire that was there amen i'm going to tell you it was there in that battle saw me and not a saw it his army apparently didn't see it amen but it began to draw it was standing there listening to that glass challenge and saying i got somebody here that's going to accept that challenge and it began to pull and it began to pull and it began to pull until they pulled a man out of bed and he said you know what i need to make some sandwiches i need to get some grapes together i need to get some milk put them in this david come over here take them down to your brothers but meanwhile david's thinking he's going down to just give some food but the light's pulling him to the valley the vow the light is pulling him to the place of death of goliath's destruction hallelujah amen don't you understand what has happened in this hour even the light visited this generation and it showed up and it has not left it's still among us it's still moving it's still healing it's still delivering it's still satisfied it's still filling with the holy ghost it has not left and it's whirling in the greatest darkest day there's ever been and it's saying i know i got somebody here that's gonna accept the challenge of this laodicean spirit and defy that thing and say i'm not bowing down to you we ought to have some idea tonight he said what the holy spirit is in operation what it should look like jesus described to us what the church of the living god would look like he said in my name they'll cast out devils check how many are witnesses amen they shall speak with new tongues check they shall take up serpents and drink anything it will not harm them check they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover check the things that i do shall you do also check amen you'll know the thoughts of the heart and describe and discern and so forth check the word is still the discern of the thoughts and intents of the heart so when the deep call it's in the deep there's a deep call so there has to be a response it has to be something on the inside it has to be something there you wouldn't have that desire the creator has created it for you to be able to have that desire amen another place he says again about the fish he said god put a fin on him so he could swim in water but god had to there had to be water before they had ever put a fin on him before there could ever be a tree to grow there had to be earth amen it was a deep that has to be a deep call to the deep there has to be a light to lead the holy spirit he said he said you know divine healing let me go i think i doubled it here hold on a minute go on down but we see jesus coming to this moment and we find him at this place and simeon could have missed his moment anna could have missed a moment but the light wasn't going to let them and neither will he ever let his children miss their moment never he said i've seen he said i've seen wonderful things this is brother brad i'm against i've seen wonderful things of the light leading we know many of the stories i'm going to just go through a few of them so there's a woman present here that i wish to speak to it was in fort wayne indiana a great revival with paul raider and another man and many of those gallup men brother bosworth was sitting he was at a meeting speaking i got up to the indiana hotel and he said the usher came and a bellhawk came told me brother adam you can't even get down there there's so many people so they took me out there was a place where this man with multiple sclerosis was healed they sent the word to king george of england for me too and king george of england sent word back to have prayer for him for multiple sclerosis which god healed the man had been in bed patient for 10 years paralyzed from his waist down he was sitting there couldn't even get in in the line twisting brother bosworth sitting there witnesses picked him up and said how many read we the people you received the article my meetings were represented from a blind girl and so forth in fort wayne anyway he goes on down he says there he was going to the platform this man some business picked him up he hadn't walked for 10 years been in bed multiple sclerosis tried to lay him there people walking over him we just had called a fast line and and the fellow they pulled him off for the platform and he was about dead and he was sitting in his wheelchair again and he looked up like that and i turned and i felt faith pulling i felt faith pulling looked down and there he was set and i said oh he said oh brother branham if i could only touch your trouser leg i'd i i'll get well trying to touch my trouser leg to get well i said god bless you brother and i looked again and i seen a vision of him going walking away i knew it had to happen then i said brother you've been patient for 10 years he said that right jesus christ has made you whole and up from that wheelchair like that away he went and there was an old man laying there and said well if i could only touch your clothes brother branham i'd get well he was paralyzed had arthritis and i passed down to him he put his old crippled hand over me said thank you lord thank you lord that's what i want to do see his anticipation according to your faith be it unto you and about i got a letter about six months later a man that had multiple sclerosis was driving down the road a man that was paralyzed was out in this field plowing with a tractor once seen the other buddy set all through the meetings talking to one another and this was the last night and there that man would have been crippled for years with arthritis up drawn up bed patients seen the man coming down the road had been a multiple sclerosis patient and that man jumped out of the car and ran to the field and the other jumped off the tractor and they ran to one of the gray grabbing each other saying amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me hallelujah what was it like led them to their place because they were desiring something from god as i remember going out one morning my wife and i mrs morgan and mrs morgan mayo's nurse that's been healed with cancer they give up on her with it and everything just cancer through and through she weighed somewhere around seemed like 40 something pounds looking a lot worse than miss florence nightingale nightingale did lots worse than she was

down the street and had my coat up and i was holding little becky sitting in my arms we're going down the street and all at once the holy spirit said don't go over to the title house go down this way for breakfast and i turned down that way not knowing where i was going i walked on and the women followed me i heard his voice and i looked before the place to miller's cafeteria and said turn in and i went in i got some prunes and a cup of coffee and i sat down mercy and i just asked a blessing about that time somebody said glory to god miss morgan said buddy your brother brandon you're caught

the street and stood there this happens all the time stood there on the corner a little bit i didn't know what was going to happen stood there about 10 minutes people kept coming and going coming and going coming and going after a while big irish cop blowed his whistle and some more press pedestrians crossing and look here come a little lady with a little tam on and with a checkered like suit holding a pocketbook in her arms she crossed the street went right by me and he said draw close to her draw close to her and i did and it went she went on by and i thought well that's strange why did he want me to go by her and i stood there a little bit and all of a sudden she whirled around she said oh brother brown i said yes ma'am oh how i feel like i'm going to faint so what's the matter i'm from canada i'm only allowed 150 a year down here spent all my money i have five cents for coffee i slept in the open hotel lobby last night in chair where he let me sleep and she said i had five cents for coffee this morning i was gonna hitchhike my way back to canada i was about two or three squares below here crying saying i have to go back the way i come and he said turn to your right not just speaking to a prophet turn to your rights then said i got in the spirit i didn't know where i was until i seen you standing here hallelujah have you ever been in that place you didn't know where you was until you saw him standing there you didn't know what was going on and all of a sudden god came down on the scene and reveal to you what was happening in the moment hallelujah said what's the matter with sister said my arm's been crippled i was riding the dog when i was a little girl and i hurt my hand i said stretch forth your hand jesus christ has healed you and that little bit that big old cop said i know who you are brother bran i'm like that and talk about a prayer line we had there on the street for about an hour there until someone someone had to come and get me many many things that took place one just after one and just a few moments he knows where to lead you to your deliverance he knows where to pull you to he knows exactly what you have need of this woman thought well i'm just walking to nowhere even after she heard a voice she said i didn't even know where i was at until i saw you remember the story this is of course a very familiar one of him flying over memphis the storm come up grounded the plane that's just a storm god has he knows how to use storms he knows exactly how to use storms so we'll call you in the morning he's talking to airlines and we'll call you in the morning said i went to the peabody hotel they stayed all night there little neck next morning they called me early and said now be ready at eight o'clock i said all right that's a mail to mail somewhere so i walked out early and went down the post office put the mail in listening close now to this how the holy spirit leads i went down to the post office going down the street i was going down singing that little pentecostal song people saying they're telling now both far and wide his power is yet the same i'm glad to say i'm one of them i was going down singing i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them going across the street something said stop i felt the angel of the lord come near and i got back up against one of the big pillars i said heavenly father what would you have me do he said turn and go back and just keep going i turned and i walked back down the street and i walked on and on and on and on seemed like two to three maybe four miles eight o'clock come nine o'clock the plane no doubt was gone gone i just kept walking after a while i was in the colored district and i walked down this little white hot washed house down there roses blooming around the door and i looked hanging over the gate and there hung a very typical aunt jemama she had a man's shirt pinned around her head like this and she was hanging over the gate i'd seen her over 100 yards away and i'm watching i was singing on only believe only believe all things are possible only believe walking on down and i quit singing i started by and looked over and she said howdy parson and i said well how'd he do amy down south they called a preacher of parsons i said how you doing annie she look i looked at her and them tears were rolling down them big old fat cheeks she looked at me and she said i said well how do you know i'm a person she said i knew you was coming well how do you know i was a person she said did you ever hear about the shoot of my woman in the bible that had a baby i said yes well i'm one of them kind of women i was barren and i promised the lord if he'd give me a child i'd raise him for him i'd done the best that i could and i said first thing you know my boy took the wrong road and he took a horrible disease and he's laying in there dying doctors can't do nothing he's been unconscious now for two days doctors give him all kinds of shots and nothing will stop it it's down to the marrow of his bone nothing will drive it about he's been unconscious but he him's a backslider and i prayed all day and all night lord please send me somebody and so the lord this morning about four o'clock told me to go out and i'll see a man with a brown suit on a small man with dark hair would come down the street and this would be the parson and she said i've been standing here ever since that time hallelujah i seen that brown suit coming to around that corner and i said i know that's the person right there oh hallelujah what am i speaking of the same holy ghost said let simeon it's the same holy ghost leading the church tonight hallelujah it's the same holy ghost he'll lead you to the same place where you can receive the messiah if you desire the holy ghost he'll lead you to that place if your desire healer he'll lead you to that place if you design victory he'll lead you to that place he has not left you he has not forsaken you you are not alone [Applause] the same holy ghost that led simeon is leading the church he said and she said he said ain't he my name is branham did you ever hear of me no sir never heard of you parson branham will you come in and see my boy i don't want him to die a backslider i want him to be saved parson listen to her desire wasn't i wanted him healed i want him saved and i said yes ma'am said amy i pray for the sick never heard about my meetings no sir parson branham the only thing i know is the lord told me you'd be a small man with dark hair and you'd have a brown suit and you'd be coming this way that's the only thing i know oh that same holy spirit that lived in simeon's day is the same holy ghost tonight he's ready to come when the deep calls to the deeds hallelujah he says i've been in kings palaces i've been in the aristocrats homes i've been where there's worth maybe 28 million dollars or more i've been in the poorest of the poor but i was never i never was any more welcome than i was in that little old white wash cabin that morning when the sun come across that hill kissing away the sweetness of the fragrance of the roses that were blooming and that old chain hanging down the gate and that plow horn hanging hanging down the end of it for away i walked in that little house and there was this little brass poster bed standing in the corner straw tick in the mat for a mattress and up on the door we said god bless our home an old wash tub sitting in the kitchen but it was home i looked laying on that bed was a great big colored boy strong love strong looking with a blanket going it's so dark i said what's the matter with him parson i think he's gone out of his mind he's lost it the last two days he thinks he's out on the ocean somewhere or something he i said andy let's pray the boy said it's so cold out here she knelt down and that old saint prayed a prayer brother i'm telling you i just felt the foot of the bed and tears began to splat on the floor she raised up she took that old apron and wiped her eyes and said lord don't let him die till i hear his mom this little boy tell his mammy i'm saved oh hallelujah i felt his feet and they were cold sticky death was upon him had syphilis went through him nothing they could do had given mercury giving penicillin god god he got in her wrong crowd but i knelt down and said hey let's pray i said heavenly father that plains hour passed now and no more but you said turn and come this way you said they that are sons of god are led by the spirit of god i don't know father why you sent me down here that'll be explained another day but somehow i believe this is the place you were leading me away it's been brought around you showed her i was coming and me coming this away i said the only thing i know lord is i lay hands upon this dying man in the name of your son christ jesus please spare his life oh man it's getting light in the room now in a few minutes he was sitting on the side of his bed talking to us in his right mind about six months later i passed down on the train going down to arizona got out of memphis going to buy me a couple of hamburgers and i heard somebody hollering oh parson branner and i looked in here calling him he's one of them red calves there and he came running grabbed my hand jumping up and down and all around parson brown you remember me i said i'm sorry i don't believe i do he said one morning the holy spirit led you to my mammy's cabin where i was dying but parson branham not only am i well i'm saved hallelujah i'm saved i was a christian brother hallelujah i believe there's still a holy ghost in the church of the living god that i need every wayward one home to where they can one day begin to shout and say i'm saved i'm saved i'm saved amazing grace how sweet the sound hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord it's a deepness calling to the deep i have a desire to see prodigals come home it must be fulfilled [Applause] i have a desire to see holy ghost filled young people holy ghost-filled families and it must be fulfilled i have a desire to see healing in the body deliverance in the body do you have that same desire it must be fulfilled [Applause] the light will lead us to the place [Applause] hallelujah i can see a little woman get on a camel load her goods on a camera and cross a desert through thieves across a desert through all kinds of problems and situations but there was a deep that called unto the deep it was a desire in her to see a living god it was a desire her to see something and he said there was something in her heart calling her what was it it was the light pulling her and bringing her to the place she could receive the promise there was a living god in action somewhere and she wanted to find it hallelujah david said when the deep calleth in the deep that the noise of our of your water spouts so there's any part of god in man the supernatural god begins to move something moves with him did you hear that it'll take him to it it can't help it david said as the heart longs for the water brooks so my soul thirsts us after thee o god the heart the deer has got to find the water brook or perish and if a man's got god in his heart he knows there's an open fountain somewhere he has to find it or perish he'll deny any creed any form anything else to find a drink of a true living god that's what starts real things moving the deep they call us in the deep now we know the story of a man who set an egg one time didn't have enough eggs under it for a setting so grabs them a duck egg she throw me a curve ball i thought you were going to say eagle egg well this is a duck egg story the duck egg when that little old duck hatched out he was the funniest looking thing them chickens had ever looked at his beak didn't look the same his feet didn't look the same his feathers didn't look the same his squeaker squawk or talk didn't wasn't the same they barked and he quack quack one of them picking on and said well he must be a holy roller with that long bill is the prophet's word i'm just quoting the prophet he must be a holy roller with that long bill what's that for why does he waddle when he walks he's a funny-looking thing no time to any age as any man or woman rose up in methodist baptist present presbyterian or anything else that really loved god and was on fire for god but what he was called an ugly duckling amongst a bunch of chickens the other thing that little duck out in the barnyard couldn't stand the scratch and then manure piles like them chickens dig did ducks got duck food chickens has chicken food you could teach that old dead theology we want to brother but something on the inside is beating for a true living god there's nothing else will satisfy it till that's quenched oh hen she would look at him clucking of the hen fold the little duck for a little bit but he got to realizing something's different here sounds different she'd go cluck cluck cluck and he'd go quack quack quack he didn't know that language he said a believer don't know that kind of language don't know the language of you know just shake hands and easy believism and just put your name on the book you have a ticket to heaven doug knows better than that a duck knows he's got to be born again he knows there's got to be something real but that little duck couldn't understand that they have a little soup supper you know and say well you come down there's going to be a good spiritual meeting tonight and go down there boil up some old rooster and sell them for 50 cents a plate to pay the preacher real duck don't get that that's still scratching in the manure pile like chickens do but the duck didn't eat like that first thing you know the old hen wandered off one day catching grass grasshoppers out behind the barn and field was hot it was hot it's about to be hot it was hot now you keep keep you keep you gave them some charge now you keep away from those holy roller meetings i'll take your name off of this book if you cooperate with that our church has nothing to do with that that ain't going to stop a duck first thing you know this little fella got up on the hillside and right down below that hill was a running stream of water and he heard something down there going quack quack quack he said wow that sounds like what i like that sounds pretty good and he raised up his little honker and he smelled that water brother it was born in him to love the water the whole whole hen cluck cluck cluck come back here and stuck up his little bill honk honk honk right straight to the water he went just as hard as he could go why he was a duck by nature and a man is a christian boy been been born in the spirit of god if he has been he hungers for the supernatural and the power of a living god as david said in days gone by when the deep call unto the deep there has to be a deep to respond amen there has to be something to quench that thirst or you will never you'll be so unsatisfied because there's nothing out there that's going to satisfy that thirst stagnant pool wouldn't really satisfy he wanted some living waters as long as a human being is searching and hungering and thirsting and calling for the power of god there's got to be a power of god to respond to it there's a deep that calls to the deep there's a light that has brought you to where you are many times we think the devil has done many things but god as i said god knows how to use storms the devil is never in control [Music] never can you say that with me never he's never in control so if he's doing something in your life it's god allowing it to happen to bring you to a certain part because he knows what it takes he knows exactly what it takes he knows exactly how to get you to the place he knows exactly if you're stubborn if you're hard headed if there's something in you if you've got a sweet nature a harder nature he knows all about you therefore he knows exactly what tool to use to get you to the place where you can receive something from him the light has brought you to where you are quit giving depression the credit quit giving sin the credit quit giving anything in this world to credit there's only one thing that's brought you to the place you are right now and that's the light now we see the world they're being pulled by darkness and i might i don't i purposely have left darkness out of this because i'm not interested in darkness i'm only interested in the light because dark he said the prince of this world has come but he has no place in me he has no pull over my life he has no he can fulfill no desire in me because there's a light that has brought me to where i'm at then don't you know if the light has brought you to where you're at there's nothing that can stop you there's nothing that can stop you i i've just this i flipped my bible over in the back and i just want to bring this because i preached on this before but this resonated it because this light is drawing us not just to laodicea that's not his fulfillment not just to your death or to a casket that's not the fulfillment the light is drawing a body to a body change and the light is going to draw bodies out of the earth to stand back up again in the resurrection david one time was surrounded by a bunch of philistines and it seemed like the philistines was going to beat him and this in first chronicles 14 and verse 15 or verse 14 it says therefore david inquired again of the lord and god said go not up after them turn away from them and come over upon them under against the mulberry tree and thou shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of a going what was it it was the pillar of fire that began to whirl in the mulberry tree it began to whirl i said i you know that ain't the way to go if you go that way you're going to be destroyed but i got a way that you can come and you're going to defeat your enemy i'm going to bring you to a place and when you hear this sound i want you to get up and go after them and he said the sound will go in the top of the mulberry trees then thou shalt go out to battle for the lord god has gone before thee to smite the host of the philistines and david therefore did as god commanded them and they smoked the hosts of the philistines from geboin unto gazir and the fame of david went out into all the lands and the lord brought the fear of him upon all the nations hallelujah this is why it's important we don't move unless the pillar of fire moves but when the pillar of fire is moving we better move we better follow after that pillar of fire with everything this guy we got in it it might seem like it took her down a dirt road and down an off-beaten path but it has never been lost it's never been turned around it's never made a wrong choice it's never went a wrong direction it's never had to turn around say i was wrong it never had to say whoops i didn't know that they'd moved to that address oops i didn't know they didn't have that anymore oops i didn't know that though the holy spirit is up to date and current and he knows your situation he knows your struggles he knows exactly where you're at you just keep walking you keep following the pillar of fire because this pillar of fire is not there for your defeat it is there for your victory and it's going to lead us out of this whole world into a new body can you hear the sound of it going the pinna fire is not here to stay and to keep us here is to lead us out of here and we're going to defeat every enemy on the way let's stand our feet and rejoice in the things of the lord the light has brought you here the light has brought you here i mean tonight said lord i want more of you i mean it's asking for revival i mean he's asking for healing i mean he's asking for the holy ghost how many is asking just ask and you shall receive blessed be the name of the lord i'll take every promise i don't want to leave one of them out every promise in the book is mine from every from the cover front cover to the back cover amen i want to be like that shooting my woman i want to be waiting for that promise to be fulfilled i want to be looking for that promise to be fulfilled i don't want the coming of the lord to surprise me amen i'd be surprised what i mean by that is i missed it that woman when she got that news be out of the gate she didn't waste a minute she went and she stood there for hours and hours and she wasn't gonna let any hinder and take her out no no i'm not missing he could come by any moment he told me he would he told me he'd be here and i'm not missing it he told me i was going to get it and i'm not missing it he told me i was going to receive it and i'm not going to miss it he told me i could have it and i'm not going to turn around i'm going to grab a hold of it it's going to be fulfilled in my life i'm gonna press toward tomorrow i'm gonna put everything i have into it hallelujah's powerheads there's a deep that calleth unto the deep there's a light that has led you to this place when a man longs to see god there's got to be a god where's god somewhere to be seen when a man longs to receive something from god there has to be something there to receive don't ever lose that desire [Music] don't ever give up on it hang on just any day now [Music] don't ever give up on your loved one returning don't ever give up don't ever give up on your healing not don't ever give up on your salvation and your holy ghost experience don't ever give up don't ever give up on that revival don't give up a promise could be just coming over that last hill been waiting a long time but all of a sudden you see a little hat popping over the horizon and that dusk darkness you can see all of a sudden you make out a body a man walking and you can see him walking down the road matches his description just what he told me matches exactly what he said in the word matches exactly don't give up don't ever give up on a promise lord jesus father we just want to say how much we love you lord thank you thank you lord you're here for us today and the needs and the situations lord it's so comforting to know lord so comforting to know that in the middle of our darkness and things there's that deep that calleth unto the deep so we may not can see it we may not concede the fulfillment of it but the desire is there so if the desire is there the answer has to be there lord may we not give up before the answer comes but hold on with everything that's in us may we look and challenge ourselves say why are you cast down why are you disquieted disquieted within me hope thou and god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my confidence my countenance and he's my god he's my god is he your god tonight that he will never fail you he promised he wouldn't he will never leave you because he promised he wouldn't he promised he would be there every step of the way lord we love you and we thank you thank you for your spirit that's been here today lord holy spirit moving in our hearts and our lives lord with expectation lord believing that the promises are being fulfilled desires of hearts are being fulfilled lives are being changed darkness is being driven away heart hurts are being solved there is a bomb in gilead lord there is a hurt lord for a wounded spirit or a help for a wounded spirit there is a bomb lord that can touch and heal and deliver because lord we couldn't ever have that desire if it wasn't so we thank you for that may we realize the importance of a true desire i
