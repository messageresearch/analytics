brother Craig and sister annab here from all the way up from Connecticut we're happy to have them their family and amen that message and song we heard by Brother Josiah a few moments ago was a blessing amen isin't it good to be a Christian looking across the audience and seeing the different ones that are here today and and fellowshipping with us I pray God's special blessing will be upon your life today and that he'll Minister you in a very special way amen we have Christmas right upon us where the world is set aside from um from Pagan actually pagan origins way back when a day that um they would celebrate the Su God's birthday and and um you know Constantine made it where that Christians would worship and and celebrate the the Lord's birthday on on the 25th and it's about that same time of year and we know it's not the Lord's birthday Thanksgiving isn't the day that they that they killed turkeys and ate him and had Thanksgiving and Christmas not the day Jesus was born we wasn't told to to to set set aside any day to honor his birth but nevertheless the world has done this and we as Christians uh Shining Light in the time of Darkness we hold forth the fact that God did send the gift into the world and because of that we do not celebrate as they do with drunken ories and given gifts that would dishonor him but we honor him by worshiping him even as we share with others expressions of love in the form of gifts and and and other ways greetings um you know we do that so you know it's it's so what we do as Christians is trying to shine forth the Light of Christ we know we're not coming with you know Santa Clauses and and whatever because that has nothing to do with it we're coming together with just one one thing in mind we are Christians and we love the Lord and we want to honor him may your life always honor him in everything we do amen we'll turn to Zechariah 4 and verse 6 brother Josiah is singing about this morning we'll read this a couple of verses and then I will go to Revelation chap 5 and we will read from verse one if you will Zechariah 4 and 6 then he answered spake to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstones thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it then Revelation 5 and verse 1 a scripture that is so so relevant to us in the day that we're living as God has has shown the light of of the of his glorious gospel upon it Revelation 5 and verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld in loow in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayer of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the numbers of of them was 10,000 times 10, thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea all that are in there in that are in them heard I say in blessing and honor and Glory G and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and to the lamb forever and ever and the four Beast said amen and the 4 and2 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever God bless you can be seated today we're speaking on the Lost inheritance restored and I think of this God's great plan of Redemption how marvelous it is and there just something about this book that was held in the hands of God and this book is not so much a physical thing in the heavens but it's a it's symbolic representing every believer every child of God and there were names that were written in it and Revelation 178 said that these were WR written there before the foundation of the world and it is a book of life and man had lost the title to life because of the sin and Disobedience to God's word we know our first parents Adam and Eve were commanded then that they would have to leave the garden because of sin you see Eden was an extension of Heaven it was Heaven on Earth and sin just cannot abide in heaven and here here is The Impossible Mountain as we're speaking on the mountain movers you know here's the impossible mountain in man's way he could not go up to heaven he was barred out he was banned now from God's presence now you see before the world began before the first word came out of God that would begin creation way back in the eternals God dwelt alone and thoughts and he thought of a family I I as he made his great plans and and sat there as I sometimes Express him as the lonely God sitting alone and by himself there was no light even though he was light yet you know here again there it was all it was just in a place of seemingly nothingless you see before the world began before the the first words he sits there alone with his thought and he's thinking he's thinking of you amen he's thinking of a family that he wouldn't dwell Alone by himself forever and so he desired a counterpart because he wanted of of of wonderful family and every one of his children would of course come from him himself there would not be from somebody else that he would adopt and somebody some stranger's child or some Devil's Child but they would be his own himself and they would be an expression of himself there would be in fact an extension of himself and the Bible tells us this that in Ephesians 4:1 and4 that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world World think about that so there in his great wisdom in his great thinking he he even prepared for them a kingdom that they would inherit and enjoy amen for Matthew 25 and verse 34 that he he said that he would say Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world so he prepared a kingdom for you before the world began amen not only that he prepared a body it was all in his great thinking now it had not yet become physical or tangible but he prepared for you a body a body that would be perfect a body without sin without a blemish amen a body that you would dwell in and and he he prepared this he prepared in his great thinking but now in order to do all of that that he wanted to do the eternal spirit you know was who was not yet a father nor yet was he a son and he began to change forms and began to bring forth something we will say an extension of himself and being that a spirit and God is invisible the Bible tells you this that God is invisible and intangible and not only that but God is a spirit and this spirit is invisible and in that form intangible and so he began to move towards his great plan of coming flesh I want to I you know I I want sons and I want daughters I want a family and I want to dwell with them they'll I'll be their God and they'll be my people I'll be their father and they'll be my children and so he began to he began to move toward his great plan of becoming flesh and he become and he move from Spirit into a theophonic form that could appear and disappear uh of theophonic theophany is a visible manifestation of God to humankind so the and so this form called we call theophany would be known in the Greek as logos and in and and we call it the word so again you know here he would move from Spirit to word and so and to put it in terms where mankind could sort of wrap his mind around it and try to comprehend this great God whose being is so great we cannot even begin to imagine or even describe his greatness and so he but yet human terms would be used to describe these events and the those terms are Father and Son now the eternal spirit become a father in the sense that life came from him but it was an extension of his own self it was his own self as he was unfolding his great plan and moving toward becoming flesh and so we use the human term of son to describe that which came from him a son again is an expression put in terms that we could sort of kind of comprehend God and describe now how God is changing forms and yet it is not another person of God nor is another spirit of God but it is the same eternal spirit now in another form as brother Brandon was told when he met in that great rainbow uh colors that come out as the spirit of God was expressing himself there in Sportsman Hollow and the spirit of the Lord came in and said Jesus of the New Testament is the Jehovah of the old he only changed his mind ask from Spirit to man and after eons of Eternity where God as the eternal spirit dwell alone in Silence with his thoughts he spoke and when he spoke he released the word now before it was only attributes within him it was only genes of himself it was only thoughts that that that that he had but these thoughts thoughts were Eternal amen and and so now he releases it and it becomes the word for the for the first time God spoke and when God spoke you know there and you know from him came the word and so to begin creation God to in order to bring anything into being God released from him the word and God spoke so we can say as John would you know he doesn't talk about the births of Jesus being on this wise and with his mother Mary da d da that's not what he says he goes all the way back in the eternals and he traces the very beginning of Jesus Christ and he says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made because it would be by the word amen by the word that God would frame the Earth Hebrews 112 says that he through him he made the universe that through him the earth was formed it is said of him in 1 Corinthians 8 and6 if you bring that up Katie that it speaks of him that there is but there is one Lord Jesus Christ through whom all things came and through whom we exist so as we read it here but to us and this is the way it is with us this morning to us there is but one God the Father the source amen The Source the Father the source right of whom are all things and we in him and there's one Lord amen one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him so another translation would say it this for like this yet for us there is is but one God the father from whom all things came and for whom we exist and there is but one Lord Jesus Christ through whom all things came and through whom we exist so according to the Bible the word that became flesh in Jesus Christ became I that became flesh in Jesus Christ created the world he created he was started in the small small things and like an evolution bringing up plant life and animal life and then the man which would be the very image of God God made Man In His Image he was his he was Body Spirit and soul now when he made man he made him different from the animal life for the animal has no soul amen but you see the soul is a we could call it a choice chamber it's where decisions are made and it was made there for God to reside within man because he wanted a body through which he would operate on the earth amen but he wanted that body that human being to be willing to allow him to do that amen so you see there would God would operate through that man and he would multiply and he would bring forth God's family Adam came by the way of the spoken word a created spirit and a body formed by God Adam came from the direct from the hand of God created as a spirit God created his very human spirit in Genesis 1 and then and then God create formed a body and put a spirit put that spirit in it and that was not God's spirit but a human spirit because man had a soul and that Soul was put there for a purpose it was where that God would come and dwell within man because this is what God wanted he he wanted to be in his creation and a part of his creation and this was God's design and purpose not to be an external God but to be an internal God for he says in 2 Corinthians 6:16 you are the Temple of the Living God as God said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they will be my people so this is God's plan this is what God want you say does God want of me this morning for you to be his Temple amen but it has to be a holy Temple it cannot be a defiled Temple it must be a purged Temple a body prepared by God to dwell in so before God could come and live in Adam's Temple you see Adam sold himself and when when he did he sold all his offspring to sin and to sin's Nature's Rule and he lost Heaven he lost the kingdom he lost his sunship and when you see Adam chose or when Eve fell to the Temptation Of The Serpent he chose for his serpent uh for his children rather to come through sex desire as animals and the instead of God's way of the spoken word then every man woman boy and girl that is ever born were born in sin shaping in iniquity came in here speaking lies with sin nature ruling their lives this would be the condition of every sexual born man or woman because every sexual birth produces Mortals that will die and only a New Birth by the spoken word produces Immortals so thus instead of men being born now as sons of God and Daughters of God they were his enemy sons and daughters and his possession to dwell in think of that now Satan could not create so he perverted and this perverted form now of where that we come in Mortal life to die Satan now is the author of that death so he's the source yeah and so all of us come born in sin shap in iniquity and his brother Brandon would take three or four scriptures and put them together come to this world speaking lies thus the serpent called the devil Tabernacles every man woman boy and girl from their first moment of breath for we were all born like this Ephesians 4:18 having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who be in past feeling have given themselves over to unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanliness and greediness and as Colossians 1:22 says and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked works every one of us come in here needing a savior every one of us come here needing Redemption but he says in Ephesians 2 and you hath he quickened hath he made of Life who were dead in sins and trespasses where in time pass you walked according to the court of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children children of Disobedience we also had that spirit in US amen among whom we also had our manner of life our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath like everybody else oh my this is the Dilemma we were born wrong we came here with the wrong birth and because of it it burn B birth us into death into sin into sorrow and all that sin brings you talk about a mountain it's the mountain and it's immovable by man all the theology will not move it all the psychology will not remove it the only thing that can remove Pro it is not by man's might nor by his power but the spirit of God there's the only thing that will move that mountain let's look at the next verse Katie look at this here but you see here it looked all Bleak for a moment but but God oh my here's something enters into the equation here we were in this decrepit sinful condition but God Amen who is rich in Mercy amen for his great love where if he loved us amen next verse now amen even when we were dead in sins he have made us alive together with Christ for by Grace you are [Music] saved beautiful amen but let me tell you let's get it straight originally you did not belong to the devil Hallelujah in fact he didn't just go to seek and save everybody he went to seek and save that which were lost and because you were his before the world began he could leave you in a lost condition but he come to seek and save that which was lost he came looking for you because I cannot be complete without my family I'll never have the celebration I want there cannot be a marriage supper There cannot be heaven without you heaven without you will not be heaven I want my people reconciled to me they were lost but they needed a savior now he knew when he created Adam when he put when he put him here he knew he put him here with a wheel and a choice amen had he done it let's say I don't know this has a fact but it seems that some of the Angels perhaps some of the seraphim their only job is just to you know wave their wings and say holy holy holy to the Lord perhaps they were created that way and that's all that they can ever do but you know God wanted more than just something that was robotic that was just programmed God wanted somebody that would willingly choose him amen that would accept him that would want him that would love him back he didn't want to just put love upon something and they had no ability to love back so he gave them choices and he put in them a soul a choice change Amber put within him something self-will it's a choice and he knew he knew when he did this he knew in his great thinking that man would choose the wrong and sell himself over to the devil so he plann ahead of time to redeem them amen you see he knew they would fall and he and he said I I'll make them this way and yet they will they will have choices not have a choice they will have to have there there will have to be something that is brought to them where where they have to choose between knowledge which has evil in it or life and I know what they'll do they'll choose the wrong but he says I know what I'll do now this is all in his thinking and I wanted you to understand this was not a reaction to man's sin this was God's plan all the time but he couldn't come along and make you fall and then then say okay now I can show myself a savor and healer and deliverer and so make you fall and say okay now I'll Pat you up now teach you see I'm the big God he'd let you make the wrong decisions and this was not as I said a reaction to man's sin it was a God's plan all the time let me read it from verse Peter 1:18 for you as you know we were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers now bear in mind conversation always there means your manner of life that so let me read it this way you are not as you know you were not redeemed with corruptible things of silver and gold like you were you know when you served idols and and and worshiped other gods and youve received by tradition from your fathers but you were bought with the precious blood of Christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot who verely was foreordained from the found before the foundation of the world but manifested in these last times for you so he says here this was for ordained of God to be the Redeemer yeah and in he in Revelation 13 and8 he speak speaks of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so long before Calvary long before the time on the earth there was there was God in his great plan and he was the lamb slain in his great thinking already producing the remedy so let me ask you this morning who is first sin or the savior before sin ever came amen the antidote for sin was already provided it was already in his great thinking in his great plan oh yeah I know I know they'll choose the wrong thing but I'll tell you what I'm going to woo them I'm going to chase after them my Mercy will overtake them and I will call on them time on time again and woo them till they just fall in love with me because that's what I want I want somebody to love me as he said to Moses I'm not wanting laws I'm not want dos and don't I don't want a bunch of legalism what I really want is somebody to love me with all their heart with all their soul with all their being that's what I want this one who come from the foundation of the world was to be become the lamb slain he was the word the eternal spirit so John will carry this story on and say the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and this is what this is what John the Apostle said this is what I'm seeing I I am seeing the word that was in the beginning has now come flesh among us and we beheld his glory this the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and John bear witness of him and cried and said this was he of whom I spake that he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me the word the logos that went forth out of God he needed a body to do his will a body which his will would be done on Earth it wasn't the death of bulls and goats that God wanted he wanted a body in which his will would be perfectly done and so you see there was nobody that could do his will you know as as the I think it's the book of Hebrews it says it's touching the law it's concerning the law to just offend in one point you're guilty of all the rest of it so you see you see no matter you might have kept this perfectly and done that perfectly but just to find one little flaw you might as well offended in all the rest because you're guilty you stand guilty before God so now man was worthy so the God who formed Adam Out of the Dust of the earth through a created blood cell formed a body in the dust of Mary's Earth and wrapped dust around the blood cell that he had created and Jesus became the prepared body oh yeah that the will of God could be done completely in and thus even bear the sins of men many a perfect lamb without blemish no fault so Hebrews 10 and5 says wherefore when he comes into the world he said sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not I'm not wanting endless bulls and goats and little little um little Cales and Lambs to be slaughtered that's not what I want want but a body what I want is a body that has been prepared for me to dwell in really now that's what he wants of you but he couldn't get that yet hello amen he couldn't get that yet because none of us could be prepared yet for the Holy Spirit was not yet given and the blood was not shed yet to purge us right come on so he says in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou Hast no pleasure then it said I lo I come in the volume of the book is written so let me read it again lo I come to do thy will oh God now this was a very purpose of Jesus coming was to fulfill the will of God to be the perfect man to be the worthy lamb so he says above when he said sacrifice and offering and burn offerings and offerings of sin thou would is not neither Hast th pleasure and and then he explained it which were offered by the law then he said lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the verse the law that he may establish the second amen by which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the blood of Jesus Christ once and for all amen so now let's look for a moment and let's go back in time and let's remember Adam didn't do God's will let's look at a mighty prophets Moses Moses oh he would he would be almost perfect in so many respects that he would his life would reflect Christ in as much he said I raise up a prophet like unto Moses but Moses when it come down in a moment in a moment in a fit of rage and anger amen he took and he smoked the rock instead of speaking The Rock therefore glorified himself and so Moses didn't do the will of God and it kept him out of the promised land Elijah didn't he would run from the face of Jezebel and go places God didn't tell him to go amen until God would find him and say what are you doing here Elijah I didn't send you here why are you here well he said you know I was afraid and you know I I I got in this Melancholy situation after the Spirit came down upon me and and the power of God helped me to kill those 400 priest of bail or whatever or whoever it was there you know and I I destroyed all of them and I ran before ahab's chariots and and and led him into the City by the power of God and then I heard Jezebel was after me and God said okay it's all right you're tired weary come on home I got a chariot ride for you but you see man couldn't great prophets couldn't our first father Adam couldn't do God's will we were all born with the same problem in sin shapen in a iniquity looks pretty bad it looks very Bleak but here the word comes again and says but I'm going to reveal part of my plan so in in Isaiah 7:14 he said therefore the Lord shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel and that word Emmanuel lit means god with us hallelujah amen it it would be God himself with us in a child a child would be born a son would be given and the rule the rule of government would be upon his shoulder amen and would be a virgin conceiving she wouldn't been born of sex ual birth like all the rest of us he would come in a different way he would come by the spoken word you know in your second birth you're born by the spoken word you said oh brother Tim I wish I was hady right's child you know where they were born of of the of the spoken word let me tell you all of us are that are born again are born of the spoken word amen you know Peter said being born again not of corruptible seed but of the word of God that liveth and abideth forever so you who are born again this morning are spoken word seed Hallelujah original seed so Isaiah would further expound us and he would say in Isaiah 9 and6 For unto us a child is born and as a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders and this is what he will be called he will be called wonderful he will be called counselor he will be called Mighty God he will be called Everlasting father he will be called Prince of Peace these will all be descriptive names of this God and Matthew Chapter 1:18 says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was spoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost notice it didn't say God the Father it said the Holy Ghost the spirit gave birth to a son and that's why he's father notice she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then then Joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately and while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is seed in her is of the Holy Ghost amen now so the eternal spirit that we talked about who dwelt alone and by himself he needed a body in which to accomplish his work because he's the invisible God as a spirit and God is a spirit and he is the invisible God he's untable he's Untouchable he's unseeable he's not he's not you know we cannot know him by any kind of physical contact and God wanted to become one of us he wanted to dwell with his family so as Hebrews said he needed a body to do his will and and so his will of course would be the lamb slain before the foundational world to get us out of the decrepit condition that Adam his soul is into because we wasn't made for sin we were made for heaven we were made for heaven to be on earth we were made to dwell eternally and we were not made to be Mortals and even you today are crying out for mortality everything within us chres I want to be free free from the chains of death that works in my members the eternal spirit needed a body to dwell in to accomplish his work now I want you to get this Jesus now is created he the body is formed in the womb of Mary and Jesus I want you to get this clear he never preaches a sermon he never heals a sick he never performs one Miracle until he's filled with the spirit but because though he was formed though he was formed there in the womb of Mary and came by this spoken he's right back on the basis of Adam in the sense that he has a choice to make and he can continue walking as a man on the earth and have an Earthly family and procreate like everybody else or he can forfeit the the whole realm of sexuality in order to bring forth children like un to the father so he never preaches a sermon until he's filled with the spirit he never performs a miracle until he's filled with the spirit we see he was conceived of the spirit and it was for the spirit to indwell as I have been saying John 4:24 says God is a spirit and the spirit the Holy Spirit fathered a body amen Luke 1 and verse 35 and the angel said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God God created the egg and God created The Germ and then taken that United embryo of the spoken word he by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit placed it in a virgin womb and Jesus would be the first born without sexual birth he would be in this the head of a new race so that's what happened for Redemption the Holy Ghost Came Upon Mary and she b a son and she called Jesus which means Jehovah savior Jehovah now this same Jehovah that was in the Old Testament would become Jesus in the new and but now he would come in the capacity of Savior here would be his purpose the Creator himself I want you to get that the creator of all things of whom nothing was made but what he made it the Creator himself came down and became a sacrifice for our sins his blood was the blood of God for God created the blood cell amen and that blood that was shed uh was shed and the spirit left him as he died in agony and then that same life the Holy Spirit came back to dwell the repentant Sinner and set him free amen that sinner didn't didn't have to come back year after year after year and sacrifice after sacrifice for now there was no need amen by one sacrifice once and for all has he been set free from the Dominion of sin and has received the Life of Christ where he reigns in victory over sin the World the Flesh and the devil Hallelujah God did it all he did it all amen he cried out out to a world C World in sin I said I'll give you a sign a virgin shall be with child a virgin shall conceive and bring forth the son and this will be your sign it'll be an everlasting sign what she brings forth will be nothing less than God With Us the same God who created the same God that walked with the prophets the same God that was over Israel in the pillar of our that same God would become flesh and become God With Us God came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the Holy Ghost and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built now notice what I said a tabernacle for the purpose of death because God said I would be the lamb slain and he can't do this as God so he has to make a body and that body has to be willing that man has to be willing to go do everything all the way to death leave his beloved disciples leave the chance of romance leave the chance of of a married life leave the chance of having physical children but in his death he would see his seed and be glorified Hallelujah because that's what he said in Isaiah 53 said he will see his seed amen through his death through his dying he would bring forth other children that God could dwell in I want you to know your purpose you say what is my purpose in life brother him it is for God to walk and God to talk in for you to give your body as a Living Sacrifice unto God holy and acceptable unto him and that seed of the woman came in order that he could be bruised to bring us salvation the Holy Ghost Came Upon Mary and he created within her the womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of our Lord and that cell would multiply and if I could say it this way not only that you see the Earth had been cursed when when Adam's Body was made it was not made of cursed Earth but when Adam sin the king of the Earth and the Earth was cursed with it you know not only out here out of vegetation comes thorns and thistles but out of the out the Earth of your soil comes thorns and thistles these creepers will come upon on you till you go back into the earth now we want you to think of this God created in the womb a cell that would multiply and he wrapped now the Earth's not redeemed the Earth's Fallen the Earth's under a curse so he wraps cursed Earth around it flesh that is Mortal amen I want you to think Adam came and he had a body and there was no mortality in it but here the here Jesus comes he's got a body and it has mortality in it he can die for the purpose of man he can suffer for the purpose of man he can be wounded for the purpose of man he can bear your infirmity and feel your sickness and experience what you experience and be tempted in every manner like you're temp it and yet do the will of God yes when the Holy G ghost Came Upon Mary he created her in a womb that would a cell now that would multiply and from the food the things that Mary ate Here Comes things in a body forms around now and that cell was created and this it was the beginning of the creation of God that's who Jesus is that Holy One was filled with Holy Blood even the blood of God that Tabernacle came to birth he grew to may be a man he went to the Jordan and there that sacrifice was was washed of John in the river called Jordan I want you to know here he comes obedient as a lamb surrendering to the will of the father now this was not just done in order to be fed all the rest of his days he would be doing one thing I have come to do thy will oh God which is actually what every newborn child of God is here far now when that acceptable sacrifice row out of the water God came and indwell him filling him with the spirit without measure and when he died and shed his blood the perfect life of God was liberated to come back upon us the The Sinner who would accept Christ as a savior think about how striking that is I know there's many Christmas messages that are being preached across the world but I would just say this morning this is my Christmas message Jehova born crying over a a manure pile Jehovah born in a manger of straw amen there's your Everlasting sign to the proud to the puffed up to the false sense of intellectual who have who have evolved their own Theology and denied the truth of god Jehovah God crying as a baby in a stinking barn and yet we think we have the right to be proud and the Stick of our nose and criticize and AC in as wor somebody here's what God did he showed greatness through humility amen Jehovah playing as a boy Jehovah working in a carpenter shop amen Jehovah washing the feet of fisherman I'll give you a sign it won't be the sign of a white colored priesthood not the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you want or think suitable but it's an everlasting sign it's a greatest sign of all Jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised mocked set it not spit upon despised rejected hanging naked on a cross while Hypocrites Jered and dared him to come off the cross Jehovah dying Jehovah praying and nothing happening then Jehovah died that's a sign for all men there isn't another like it it's a great one then Darkness came on the earth they put him in a tomb there he lay there three days in night until an earthquake shattered the Gloom of night and he came forth Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended on high then Jehovah returned I want you to get it amen the same Jesus returned again in in a mighty Russian wh flames of fire Jesus came to walk in the midst of his church and Empower his people once more Jehovah came and this time to stay in his people did you hear me this time to stay abide and again Jehovah heals the sick he raises the dead he manifests himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation Jehovah came and he raised The Prostitute to sin no more he came down to the drunkard with fly bows and his face as he lay unconscience in the gutter yeah Jehovah came to manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh Jehovah came God in us the hope of glory yes Jesus came he shed his blood and set the captives free he came and redeemed the lost sheep he came to give them eternal life and they shall never perish he will not lose one of them he will raise them up at the last day I want to get it some of you today on this on this eve of Christmas as it were you you've got lost loved ones out there let me tell you he will not lose one of them
