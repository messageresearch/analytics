[48:09] it's a wonderful thing to be able to
[48:11] gather together and to worship together
[48:13] and sing songs of Zion and Let Your
[48:17] Presence just fall Among Us Lord and
[48:20] begin to move and touch hearts and lives
[48:24] give us strength Lord for the journey
[48:26] ahead Lord God
[48:28] father we just ask that you would come
[48:30] and you'd speak to our hearts tonight
[48:33] or encourage us the Lord in this season
[48:35] as we're about ready to change another
[48:37] year the calendar is about to change and
[48:40] move into another year or truly we could
[48:43] say once again you've led us safely this
[48:47] far
[48:48] and Lord we're going to put our trust in
[48:50] you no matter what year may come up what
[48:53] day may come up what situation may arise
[48:56] Lord we can trust you
[48:58] we just ask father you just moved to dot
[49:01] tonight in our hearts Lord there be
[49:03] anything we've done or said that would
[49:04] be pleasing to you father that you'd
[49:07] wash Us by your blood that you would
[49:09] just come and mend our hearts Lord
[49:11] tonight we pray we commit this service
[49:14] to your hands in Jesus name
[49:18] let's turn to Psalms chapter
[49:20] 23 and verse 1.
[49:33] also on that last Sunday of the month at
[49:36] that business meeting there'll be
[49:39] dinner and communion as well
[49:41] in January the last last Sunday in
[49:44] January so
[49:46] we probably put something up on the
[49:48] slide for that as well
[49:49] looking forward to our New Year's
[49:51] meetings it's going to be a wonderful
[49:53] time of the Lord
[49:54] amen and I really love these three young
[49:57] brothers that are coming to share their
[49:59] hearts with us and I believe we'll all
[50:01] be blessed amen and uh and uh so uh
[50:06] brother Ronnie and brother Nathan and
[50:08] brother Isaac just find young men in the
[50:11] gospel and found them to be faithful men
[50:13] and we're looking forward to What the
[50:15] Lord Has for us also remember next
[50:18] Wednesday there will be no service it'll
[50:20] be moved to to the Friday night so just
[50:23] put that on your calendar as well amen
[50:26] Psalms chapter 23 and verse 1. amen
[50:30] probably one of the most familiar
[50:32] scriptures that there is and and one of
[50:34] the most uh memorized scriptures that
[50:37] there is and and the one the most read
[50:39] scriptures and it's a wonderful
[50:41] scripture and it's uh More Than Just
[50:43] Words but I believe that they're
[50:45] inspired words and and is very pertinent
[50:48] to the day that we're living in Psalms
[50:50] chapter 23 and verse 1 says the Lord is
[50:54] my shepherd I shall not want he maketh
[50:57] me to lie down in Green Pastures he
[51:00] leadeth me beside the Still Waters he
[51:03] restoreth my soul
[51:05] he leadeth me in the past of
[51:08] righteousness for his name's sake yea
[51:11] though I walk through the valley of the
[51:13] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[51:16] thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
[51:20] they comfort me thou preparest a table
[51:23] before me in the presence of my enemy
[51:26] thou anointest my head with all my cup
[51:29] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[51:32] shall follow me all the days of my life
[51:35] and I will dwell in the house of the
[51:38] Lord forever amen will let you be seated
[51:42] today
[51:43] I'd like to speak to you on the light
[51:46] the shepherd
[51:48] Amen to be even a lot to do with what we
[51:51] spoke on the guide because a Shepherd is
[51:54] a guide as we've read here in our
[51:57] scripture he speaks about he leadeth me
[51:59] beside the Still Waters he leadeth me in
[52:02] pass of righteousness a pass of
[52:05] righteousness for his namesake and I I
[52:08] thought this is part of this has always
[52:10] spoke to me because it in verse 4 it
[52:13] says though I'll walk through the valley
[52:14] of the shadow of death to for there to
[52:17] be a shadow there has to be a light
[52:20] is not the valley of complete darkness
[52:22] is not the valley of complete loss is
[52:25] not the valley of of complete
[52:27] destruction but there's something there
[52:29] amen that giveth hope and we find he
[52:32] said and in this in the shadow of death
[52:34] I'll fear no evil for thou art with me
[52:37] amen thy rod or Thy word and thy staff
[52:40] they comfort me you know David presents
[52:43] God as a shepherd and in doing so he
[52:46] also Compares us to being sheep uh the
[52:50] intent was to highlight the total
[52:52] devotion Christians are meant to have
[52:54] towards their lord and and savior and
[52:57] not only that but his devotion towards
[52:59] his people amen because we are under his
[53:03] care and we're under his care amen we'll
[53:05] find security we'll have safety amen you
[53:09] know it's it's in a Shepherd the
[53:12] qualifications are sheep are completely
[53:15] dependent on their Shepherd they receive
[53:18] safety they receive food they receive
[53:21] guidance from the shepherd they follow
[53:24] and obey the shepherd on Instinct you
[53:26] know some Scholars look at this
[53:28] scripture and I've done a lot of reading
[53:30] and researching on what different ones
[53:32] would say about it but a lot of them
[53:34] look at the scripture about preparing a
[53:36] table of how that they used to take a
[53:39] trough and they would put a raised table
[53:41] and and they would put feet in it and
[53:43] they'd use oil to keep the flowers away
[53:45] but others would look at that more of a
[53:47] a a say in how how soldiers are being
[53:51] prepared for battles with a feast and
[53:54] and an anointing of all to be put upon
[53:56] them and I believe that's what is
[53:59] speaking about us say man it's not that
[54:00] God is a has built some table somewhere
[54:03] or someplace or or some certain building
[54:06] but God is preparing a feast Amen to
[54:09] give for we to get strength but not to
[54:11] just have a feast to gain strength but
[54:13] anoint him that will take us through a
[54:15] man that will give us the victory over
[54:17] our enemies but the main theme through
[54:20] this whole scripture if you read it
[54:21] again and you Ponder and you look on it
[54:24] is the main theme of The Psalm is you
[54:26] are with me God Is With Us amen he's
[54:31] always close in every moment and and
[54:33] when you take a hold of that truth and
[54:35] and you begin to look at that and you
[54:37] realize I'm never alone we're we're
[54:39] always looked after and therefore we
[54:42] never have a reason to lose hope because
[54:45] God is walking with us and he's tending
[54:48] to his flock amen and we can read
[54:50] scriptures there's tons of them about
[54:51] referring to him as a Shepherd in
[54:54] Genesis 48 it says God who has been my
[54:57] shepherd All My Life To This Day Psalms
[55:00] 28 would say savior people and bless
[55:03] your inheritance be their Shepherd and
[55:06] carry them forever amen Isaiah 40 verse
[55:10] 11 said he tends his flock Like a
[55:12] Shepherd he he gathers the Lambs in his
[55:15] arms and he carries them close to his
[55:17] heart he gently leads those that have
[55:20] young John 10 and verse 14 says I am the
[55:23] Good Shepherd I know my sheep and my
[55:26] sheep know me just as the father knows
[55:29] me and I know the father and I lay down
[55:31] my life for the sheep first Peter would
[55:33] say it like this when the chief Shepherd
[55:35] appears we shall receive a Crown of
[55:38] Glory that will never fade away but
[55:41] looking at this scripture different
[55:43] translations of Psalms 23 and verse 1.
[55:46] as we just kind of expand upon these
[55:48] things things the the one version would
[55:51] say it one translation would say Jehovah
[55:53] is my shepherd I shall not want the
[55:56] Amplified would say it the Lord is my
[55:59] shepherd to feed and to guide me and to
[56:02] Shield me and I shall not want another
[56:05] translation says You Lord are my
[56:07] shepherd and I will never be in need
[56:10] another translation says the Lord is my
[56:13] shepherd and I have everything I ever
[56:16] needed amen what a Shepherd that we can
[56:19] depend upon amen one a Shepherd who is
[56:22] Dependable that is with us that leads us
[56:25] that guides us that is with us every
[56:27] step of the way and in this in this
[56:29] knowing of how Dependable that he is we
[56:33] can be at rest to know God is looking
[56:35] after each situation that we go through
[56:38] God is there guiding God is there
[56:41] directing God is there moving God is
[56:43] there amen amen in every situation if
[56:46] you're in the Valley of Death the light
[56:48] is still there if you're in the valley
[56:50] of trouble God is still there amen and
[56:53] so we can look at these as the different
[56:55] things that has brought out one I like
[56:58] nothing so there can be a contentment
[57:00] there that God will provide All I Ever
[57:03] Need so I can relax and stop striving I
[57:07] can relax and let him take control I can
[57:10] relax and let him provide and him meet
[57:13] my needs another one is rest he makes me
[57:16] lie down in green pastors or or God
[57:19] invites us into moments of Stillness so
[57:22] we can rest amidst our busyness that's a
[57:26] good one right there because the age
[57:28] that we live in is a very busy age amen
[57:31] we got more advancements than ever but
[57:33] we're more busy than busier than ever
[57:35] amen you go to a kitchen nowadays used
[57:37] to the man would have to prepare they
[57:40] might have to go out and kill their food
[57:41] and then progress their food or
[57:44] reflector or vegetables that they was
[57:46] going to clean them and all of this but
[57:48] now today normally you go to a shopping
[57:50] center and you you know you find
[57:52] something that you want to eat you take
[57:54] it home and you put it in a God forbid
[57:56] in the microwave or an oven or whatever
[57:58] it is a lot of things that go along a
[58:00] lot faster but we're more busier than we
[58:02] ever been amen Satan has devised it to
[58:05] be this way but God invites us into
[58:08] moments of Stillness in the moments that
[58:11] we can just stop for a moment I mean I
[58:13] believe that's what it is on a Wednesday
[58:15] night just to stop for a moment and
[58:17] realize us the goodness of God just to
[58:20] stop for a moment and realize you know
[58:21] what God has brought me safely this far
[58:24] God has brought me to this place Amen to
[58:27] where I'm at he's watched over my life
[58:29] he's took me out of trouble he brought
[58:31] me out of sin he brought me out of the
[58:33] myory clay he set my feet upon the rock
[58:35] why should I get down to 2023 and
[58:39] realize or think that God has can't he
[58:41] can't do no more or he ain't got enough
[58:43] but God has showed over and over and
[58:46] over that I am more than enough amen and
[58:49] so as also in this scripture there's
[58:52] peace he leads me beside Quiet Waters
[58:55] God calms Us in challenging times amen
[58:59] there's a calmness to a Believer why
[59:01] because you're not listening to the
[59:03] voices of this world you're not
[59:05] listening the voices of Fox News or CNN
[59:08] that's not where you get your calmness
[59:10] from no sir you get your calmness from
[59:13] listening to the voice of God and the
[59:15] voice of God is calling and unto you and
[59:18] saying whosoever will come and let him
[59:21] drink whosoever will come and I'll take
[59:23] your burdens off of you whosoever will
[59:25] there is a voice that is speaking Amen
[59:28] to the Sheep of almighty God also
[59:30] there's a restoration in here it's a he
[59:33] refreshes my soul God promises in this
[59:36] that he will renew our Spirits so we
[59:38] will be strengthened and continue to go
[59:41] forward see God is interested in a
[59:44] journey he he didn't bring the children
[59:45] of Israel out amen I think it's uh he
[59:48] shows himself to be the light the
[59:50] shepherd to them because it wasn't God
[59:52] driving them it was God leading them
[59:54] they followed the light they followed
[59:56] the pillar of cloud there by night and
[59:59] or the fire by night in the cloud by day
[1:00:01] amen what was it it was the great
[1:00:03] shepherd He was leading them and he led
[1:00:06] them to some very difficult places he
[1:00:08] led them to the Red Sea he led them to
[1:00:10] Bitter Waters he led them to places
[1:00:12] there was no water he led them to places
[1:00:14] there was no food he led them over over
[1:00:17] and over showing he is a shepherd and
[1:00:20] each moment he was able to provide for
[1:00:23] them and that gives me great strength
[1:00:25] and courage to know and look back to
[1:00:27] what he was then I know he is today that
[1:00:30] he's still leading the Church of the
[1:00:31] Living God by the pillar of fire amen
[1:00:34] the shepherd is still pushed moving and
[1:00:37] when he moves the church moves and when
[1:00:39] he goes the church goes amen he's still
[1:00:42] the shepherd and we may go through some
[1:00:45] dark places we may go through some
[1:00:47] difficult times we have come through
[1:00:50] would come through difficult sicknesses
[1:00:52] we come through difficult deaths we come
[1:00:55] through difficult years amen and things
[1:00:59] begin to turn upside down and backwards
[1:01:01] but each step of the way the shepherd
[1:01:04] has showed over and over I'm the one
[1:01:06] that's leading I'm the one that's guided
[1:01:08] and I still have the answer for whatever
[1:01:11] date you're facing for whatever trouble
[1:01:14] you're facing for whatever thing you're
[1:01:16] facing I still have the answer so we can
[1:01:20] have I am strength in these times that
[1:01:22] we live in also there's wisdom amen as
[1:01:25] it guides me along the right path for
[1:01:28] his namesake God wants to reveal himself
[1:01:31] and his ways to us so he so we can know
[1:01:34] him better
[1:01:35] and so he'll lead us down certain paths
[1:01:38] to show himself certain attributes of
[1:01:42] himself to you
[1:01:44] sometimes he'll lead you down a path of
[1:01:46] sickness to show himself as a Healer to
[1:01:49] you or otherwise if you was always well
[1:01:51] you would never know he could be a
[1:01:53] Healer sure you might have somebody
[1:01:55] else's testimony but God wants to have
[1:01:58] your you to have your testimony and so
[1:02:00] you go through darkness and you go
[1:02:02] through things amen why God is going to
[1:02:05] show himself you who he really is David
[1:02:08] goes on with this with this as we read
[1:02:11] down even though I walk to the darkest
[1:02:13] Valley I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:02:16] with me you know as a as a warrior in
[1:02:18] the King David often face danger he
[1:02:22] always faced danger there was lines
[1:02:24] there was Bears there were giants there
[1:02:26] was the enemy that was always there was
[1:02:27] another king that was trying to kill him
[1:02:29] but he never forgot the lessons he
[1:02:31] learned about God as a young Shepherd
[1:02:33] the rest of his life though most of us
[1:02:36] don't have to have to deal with the same
[1:02:38] things maybe David dealt with I doubt
[1:02:40] very seriously many of you have ever
[1:02:41] been in a fight with a bear or with a
[1:02:43] lion and amen but there's all other
[1:02:45] things that we have to deal with we have
[1:02:47] to deal with challenges every day we
[1:02:49] have some of them are very painful some
[1:02:51] trials go and job loss or medical issues
[1:02:54] or relationship troubles but there's
[1:02:56] nothing that is a is a match for our
[1:02:59] almighty God for the Shepherd that is
[1:03:02] watching over us God is leading you he
[1:03:05] is guiding you and he's with you every
[1:03:08] step of the journey
[1:03:10] and when we look to him we find strength
[1:03:13] to walk confidently through the hardest
[1:03:15] of struggles
[1:03:16] amen you prepare a table for me in the
[1:03:20] presence of my enemies you anoint my
[1:03:22] head with oil my cup overflowing as you
[1:03:25] know David he loved to Worship the Lord
[1:03:29] amen his songs were abounding with
[1:03:31] Thanksgiving and praise and honor unto
[1:03:34] Jehovah amen when he was in the valley
[1:03:36] he would find strength in a song when he
[1:03:38] was on top of a mountain he would find
[1:03:40] strength in the song David was always
[1:03:43] aware of both his own lack but also of
[1:03:46] the greatness of his God you know you
[1:03:48] can read about it he talks about his
[1:03:50] lack and and what he like but also in
[1:03:52] that he would show God is greater than
[1:03:55] my lack God is greater than the
[1:03:58] situation that I'm going you know it's
[1:04:00] important that you remember in your life
[1:04:03] he's still Jehovah Jireh
[1:04:06] amen he's still the provider he'll still
[1:04:09] meet your needs the more we celebrate
[1:04:12] His blessings and we're in time we're in
[1:04:14] a time of Celebration so let's just
[1:04:16] celebrate tonight maybe we celebrate His
[1:04:18] blessings and others around us the more
[1:04:22] we'll have faith and what he's going to
[1:04:24] do for us going forward
[1:04:28] when you begin to lift him up and praise
[1:04:30] him for what he's already done for you
[1:04:33] then faith will begin to resonate in
[1:04:36] your heart that the same God that took
[1:04:38] care of you there is the same God that
[1:04:41] takes care of you now the same one that
[1:04:43] walked through that Valley with me he'll
[1:04:45] walk to the next Valley with me
[1:04:49] Hallelujah
[1:04:51] throughout his lifetime David found
[1:04:54] himself in a lot of different places he
[1:04:56] found himself working in fields hiding
[1:04:58] in caves ruling in the palace Leading
[1:05:01] Armies into battle running from armies
[1:05:04] amen trying to kill him he truly
[1:05:06] believed though that always God remained
[1:05:09] close to him
[1:05:11] wherever he wherever he was that did not
[1:05:13] change nothing about where God was
[1:05:17] if they can just anchor in somebody's
[1:05:20] heart tonight that no matter where you
[1:05:22] are that does not change where God is
[1:05:25] amen God is with you God is leading you
[1:05:28] God is guiding you he's a Shepherd amen
[1:05:31] you might be through some of the darkest
[1:05:33] times of your life but the light is
[1:05:35] still with you
[1:05:39] we go through things in our daily lives
[1:05:41] we may end up in a place or a day that
[1:05:45] we didn't expect
[1:05:46] but knowing that our Lord will always go
[1:05:49] with us
[1:05:50] not only with us but before us should
[1:05:53] bring a sense of of of of rest a sense
[1:05:58] of even boldness in our steps
[1:06:01] amen
[1:06:03] so we know he is the shepherd we know uh
[1:06:06] that he leads and guides let's look at
[1:06:08] John chapter 10 and verse 7.
[1:06:11] then Jesus said unto them again verily
[1:06:14] verily I say unto you I am the door of
[1:06:18] the Sheep
[1:06:20] and all that ever came before me are
[1:06:22] thieves and robbers but the Sheep did
[1:06:25] not hear them I am the door by me if any
[1:06:28] man enter in he shall be saved and shall
[1:06:31] go in and out and find Pastor the thief
[1:06:33] cometh not but for to steal and to kill
[1:06:35] and destroy I am come that they might
[1:06:38] have life that they might have it more
[1:06:40] abundantly I am the Good Shepherd the
[1:06:43] Good Shepherd giveth his life for his
[1:06:45] sheep but he that is a hireling and not
[1:06:48] the shepherd who's on the sheep or not
[1:06:50] see it the wolf coming and leaveth the
[1:06:52] Sheep that's not a real Shepherd a real
[1:06:55] Shepherd when a wolf comes he's going to
[1:06:57] run the wolf away
[1:06:59] amen but they're hireling when he sees a
[1:07:02] wolf coming he's going to run and leave
[1:07:03] the shepherd or leave the Sheep to be
[1:07:05] eight to be devired but this is this is
[1:07:08] not God when God sees your battle coming
[1:07:10] he's not going to run away
[1:07:14] amen let me tell you he sees it coming a
[1:07:16] lot further he could have had a lot
[1:07:18] further hurt than you ever thought about
[1:07:20] having because he sees it coming a long
[1:07:22] ways off but he's not running from your
[1:07:24] battles he's not running from your
[1:07:27] sicknesses he's not running from your
[1:07:29] trouble but he's leading you and he's
[1:07:31] guiding you and he's staying with you
[1:07:33] every step of the way
[1:07:37] Hallelujah
[1:07:40] he says leave it the sheep and fleeth
[1:07:42] and the Wolf catches them and scattereth
[1:07:45] the Sheep the hireling fleas because
[1:07:48] he's a hireling and cares not for the
[1:07:50] Sheep but I am the Good Shepherd
[1:07:53] and no my sheep
[1:07:57] Hallelujah listen it ain't important
[1:08:00] that the president of the United States
[1:08:01] knows you it ain't important if the if
[1:08:04] the mayor and Minden knows you it ain't
[1:08:07] important if anybody else knows you as
[1:08:09] long as he knows you
[1:08:12] [Applause]
[1:08:13] um
[1:08:14] because if he knows you he's known you
[1:08:17] before the foundation of the world and
[1:08:20] he's called you by name my sheep know my
[1:08:23] voice
[1:08:25] amen and I said I know my sheep but I'm
[1:08:30] also known of mine my sheep knows me
[1:08:34] I know my sheep and my sheep knows me
[1:08:38] has anybody ever I'm sure it went around
[1:08:40] pretty much viral that of that Shepherd
[1:08:43] that was standing there looking over
[1:08:44] that little Valley of sheep and there
[1:08:46] was others that was hollering at them
[1:08:48] and they had their head in the grass
[1:08:49] they wasn't paying no attention and the
[1:08:51] shepherd just kind of saying some things
[1:08:52] I maybe was in a different language I
[1:08:54] don't remember but the gist of it was
[1:08:56] they were hollering they were screaming
[1:08:58] they were trying to get their attention
[1:08:59] but the Sheep just kept on eating grass
[1:09:01] but as soon as the shepherd spoke and he
[1:09:04] began to call for them and the heads
[1:09:06] came up and they began to look around
[1:09:08] they found him and when they found them
[1:09:10] they began to run make a beeline towards
[1:09:12] the shepherd because they knew his voice
[1:09:16] hallelujah amen real sheep that knows
[1:09:19] the voice of the shepherd they're not
[1:09:21] concerned when false doctrines arise and
[1:09:23] Devils of every kind starts to speak and
[1:09:25] howl and say all kinds of things and
[1:09:27] make threats and not worried about that
[1:09:29] that ain't the voice I'm listening to
[1:09:31] The Voice I'm listening to is the voice
[1:09:33] of the Good Shepherd
[1:09:39] I'm not listening to the voice that says
[1:09:42] I'm not his I'm listening to the voice
[1:09:44] that says you're mine
[1:09:48] I'm not listening to the voice it says
[1:09:51] I'm going to destroy you I'm listening
[1:09:53] to the voice that says he can't destroy
[1:09:56] you you're mine
[1:10:00] as a father knoweth me even so no other
[1:10:03] father and I lay down my life for the
[1:10:06] Sheep another sheep another sheep I have
[1:10:09] which are not of this fold them also I
[1:10:12] must bring and they shall hear my voice
[1:10:14] and there shall be one fold and one
[1:10:18] Shepherd I believe he's talking about us
[1:10:19] right there amen therefore doth my
[1:10:22] father love me because I lay down my
[1:10:24] life that I may take it again no man
[1:10:27] taketh it from me but I lay it down I
[1:10:29] have power to lay it down and I have
[1:10:31] power to take it again this commandment
[1:10:33] have I received to my father so this
[1:10:35] word Shepherd it's it's what it means to
[1:10:38] feed it means to tend to flock it means
[1:10:40] to keep the Sheep to furnish pasture for
[1:10:43] food to nurse to cherish one's body to
[1:10:46] serve the body to supply the request the
[1:10:49] needs for the soul amen but you know the
[1:10:52] task is this is written here the task of
[1:10:55] the Eastern Shepherd were the one watch
[1:10:57] for enemies they were trying to attack
[1:10:59] the Sheep and when they did defend the
[1:11:03] sheep from the attackers
[1:11:05] Hallelujah so listen when Satan comes to
[1:11:08] attack you he's not just attacking some
[1:11:10] wimpy sheep he's also attacking the
[1:11:13] shepherd
[1:11:14] the shepherd is watching for his attack
[1:11:17] but not only is he watching for his tag
[1:11:19] he's there to defend you when it happens
[1:11:25] it's also to heal the wounded and the
[1:11:28] sick sheep it's also to find the set and
[1:11:30] save the lost or trap sheep oh praise
[1:11:33] the lord it's also to love them and
[1:11:36] share their lives and so earning their
[1:11:39] trust
[1:11:41] so that's why he had to come down and be
[1:11:43] made a sheep himself
[1:11:46] where in the season he came down and the
[1:11:48] Angels Came To Who Shepherds why because
[1:11:51] there was a lamb that was being born
[1:11:53] amen he came to the Shepherds to begin
[1:11:56] to to say I am to declare that God
[1:11:59] Emmanuel was being born Emmanuel God and
[1:12:03] they go said yeah go find him he's in a
[1:12:05] stable and they go go to look for him
[1:12:07] and maybe they was expecting a lot
[1:12:09] different I don't know what that was
[1:12:10] expected but what they saw was a little
[1:12:12] baby crying in a Manger amen why because
[1:12:16] he was coming as a lamb why because he
[1:12:19] had to share our lives
[1:12:22] he had to know what it was like to be a
[1:12:24] weak sheep he had to know what it was
[1:12:27] like to get sick he had to know what it
[1:12:29] was like to have mind vitals and
[1:12:31] Troubles of every kind he had to know
[1:12:33] what it was like to feel the nervousness
[1:12:35] of the attack on coming storms and
[1:12:38] attacks and things he had to know what
[1:12:40] it was like for Satan to call me after
[1:12:43] him moment after moment after moment
[1:12:45] after moment he came to share your life
[1:12:49] so he could earn your trust
[1:12:55] Hallelujah
[1:13:01] he's a great Shepherd
[1:13:03] he's in control of every situation
[1:13:08] he knows your battles before you get
[1:13:10] there
[1:13:12] I I know what I'm talking about because
[1:13:13] just this weekend he knew my battles
[1:13:16] before I got there
[1:13:19] I went to Brother Jason Jackson's and
[1:13:21] was ministering there this past Sunday
[1:13:23] Lord had laid it on my heart when he
[1:13:25] asked me to come what to speak on I was
[1:13:26] going to speak on the light the chain
[1:13:27] breaker
[1:13:30] and I knew every time I preached that
[1:13:32] there's been a resistance there's been
[1:13:34] something trying to keep something to
[1:13:37] keep Freedom or deliverances from
[1:13:39] happening
[1:13:40] almost a physical Force when it was up
[1:13:43] there at that Youth Camp there when I
[1:13:45] first time I ever preached it it was
[1:13:46] like a physical thing trying to stop
[1:13:48] something
[1:13:49] and before the service it even started
[1:13:51] we're in the back office and brother
[1:13:53] they started singing the song actually
[1:13:55] started singing a song brother Jason
[1:13:56] went out we'd prayed he went out to the
[1:13:58] platform and I'm sitting there and the
[1:14:00] big knock comes on the door and I I
[1:14:02] don't know whether I said because they
[1:14:03] had just talked about some issues they
[1:14:05] was having they've been kind of on a
[1:14:07] high alert for a situation and so I
[1:14:09] didn't know if I was supposed to open
[1:14:10] that door or not open that door I don't
[1:14:12] think God help me he told me where a gun
[1:14:14] was so I thought well if I had you know
[1:14:16] all these things are going through your
[1:14:17] mind
[1:14:18] and I thought well if somebody really
[1:14:20] needs something they'll knock again a
[1:14:22] little harder so sort of Bam Bam he
[1:14:25] knocks on the door and say well okay I
[1:14:26] walk up the door and I open it and his
[1:14:28] brother uh Joe Van slack and he said I
[1:14:30] need brother Jason his wife's in trouble
[1:14:33] I thought wow okay and so he runs on the
[1:14:35] platform they come running back brother
[1:14:36] Jack brother Joe tells brother Jason
[1:14:38] look your wife's heartbeat rate went up
[1:14:41] to like 160 or 150 160 where they're
[1:14:43] just sitting there her watch she had on
[1:14:45] it alerted her to that and they've taken
[1:14:48] her back there was an EMT there that was
[1:14:49] checking her blood pressure it was like
[1:14:51] 220 over 110 and it was just nuts and
[1:14:54] he's like come on Timothy come with me
[1:14:56] and he said he told me later he said I
[1:14:58] want you to come because I knew you had
[1:15:00] been in that battle before
[1:15:02] amen and so I I went back there to where
[1:15:05] he was at and where she was at and we we
[1:15:07] seen it she seemed to be fine as far as
[1:15:09] it's just looking at her and things and
[1:15:11] it didn't seem to be in much stress but
[1:15:13] they finally got her her heart rate
[1:15:15] ready to start at leveling just a little
[1:15:17] bit still over a hundred we laid hands
[1:15:19] on her and began to pray and it began to
[1:15:22] come down and the blood pressure began
[1:15:24] to come down although wow this is
[1:15:26] amazing found out later another sister
[1:15:28] and that same service about the same
[1:15:30] time her heart goes crazy and she runs
[1:15:33] out and checks her blood pressure and
[1:15:34] has to go take blood pressure medicine
[1:15:36] the devil was trying to stop something
[1:15:39] and so I began to come back I go back
[1:15:42] and I get ready and they call me out and
[1:15:43] begin to preach about 30 40 minutes
[1:15:45] maybe into my sermon I'm preaching along
[1:15:47] and there's a sister about 90 years old
[1:15:49] they come to service for the first time
[1:15:51] since covert and she she had gotten sick
[1:15:54] and had a lot of issues and wasn't able
[1:15:56] to come because of her hearts and the
[1:15:58] heart issues and things and but she just
[1:16:00] I want to be in church I want to be in
[1:16:02] church and so that morning she just told
[1:16:04] her husband said honey I want to be in
[1:16:06] church he said well let's go to church
[1:16:07] so for a first service she's back and
[1:16:10] while I'm preaching she just goes
[1:16:11] lifeless
[1:16:13] just folds down and I've watched
[1:16:15] Brothers come running up and and there's
[1:16:17] a commotion going on and I stopped and I
[1:16:19] said I see what's happening here
[1:16:20] darkness is trying to put out the light
[1:16:22] but the light is going to stand against
[1:16:25] the darkness
[1:16:27] and I said let's bow our heads and pray
[1:16:30] and we bowed our heads and prayed and
[1:16:33] they got her into a wheelchair and they
[1:16:34] started willing her out and I said I
[1:16:36] don't know what what's going to happen I
[1:16:38] said it's not up to me it's up to him
[1:16:40] all I know is we prayed and we asked God
[1:16:42] to spare our life I said but if she did
[1:16:45] go it's a wonderful way to go
[1:16:47] in the house of the Lord but I said I
[1:16:50] believe the light is here to show who he
[1:16:53] is
[1:16:55] amen when about 10 minutes brother Jason
[1:16:58] came back on the platform because he had
[1:17:00] went down and prayed with her out in the
[1:17:01] audience and went out the back came back
[1:17:03] with a note and said sister Decker is
[1:17:05] back to normal she's going home with her
[1:17:08] husband
[1:17:09] amen what was it the light came and
[1:17:12] drove the darkness
[1:17:14] he don't always know you don't always
[1:17:16] know what battle you're going to be in
[1:17:18] but the light will always be there
[1:17:23] Hallelujah this bride will never walk in
[1:17:27] complete darkness
[1:17:29] there'll always be light
[1:17:36] Hallelujah
[1:17:40] God knows what we have need of
[1:17:43] the shepherd
[1:17:44] has a fold he drives a sheep in there
[1:17:47] leads them in there and after the Sheep
[1:17:49] is in he lays down in the door no sheep
[1:17:53] can go out and no wolf can come in
[1:17:57] Hallelujah unless it goes over the
[1:18:00] shepherd think how safe you are
[1:18:05] you know brother Brandon would talk he
[1:18:07] said if you know he said a few nights
[1:18:09] ago I woke up and I had a sermon on my
[1:18:10] heart of resting I didn't have an
[1:18:12] audience so I had one woman audience my
[1:18:14] wife woke her up said honey I got to
[1:18:17] preach to you about about this rest for
[1:18:19] a moment and I did it about three hours
[1:18:21] ain't that a paradox
[1:18:23] preach about rest when you're trying to
[1:18:25] sleep
[1:18:27] laughs
[1:18:28] but here he said it was just burning on
[1:18:31] my heart and I had to I had to talk to
[1:18:32] somebody he said the Christian
[1:18:34] experience is based solemnly and holy
[1:18:38] upon rest
[1:18:40] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[1:18:43] heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:18:47] we're tossed about with everything until
[1:18:49] the shepherd comes and when Christ comes
[1:18:52] the Holy Ghost comes it's finished
[1:18:56] then you're resting in Christ no matter
[1:18:59] what comes or what goes nothing can
[1:19:02] touch you unless it comes through the
[1:19:04] shepherd
[1:19:07] um he has to permit it therefore the
[1:19:10] Bible said all things work together for
[1:19:11] the good of them that love the Lord and
[1:19:13] are thee called according to his purpose
[1:19:15] it has to come over the shepherd first I
[1:19:19] am the door no man can come in without
[1:19:21] me accepting it
[1:19:24] he said let me tell you when that when
[1:19:26] God permits anything it's working for
[1:19:29] your good so would sickness be the same
[1:19:32] thing certainly God might heal you so
[1:19:35] that God can heal you to show a great
[1:19:37] testimony and give you a little
[1:19:39] something to move on for all things work
[1:19:42] together for the good
[1:19:47] notice how beautiful the shepherd laid
[1:19:51] himself at the door
[1:19:54] he didn't just pile a bunch of sheep up
[1:19:56] there he he laid himself
[1:19:58] at the door
[1:20:00] he says all of Christians who will fall
[1:20:02] away and run back and run out and run in
[1:20:04] and run out that well I can't make it
[1:20:07] you couldn't make it in the first place
[1:20:13] did you hear me
[1:20:15] before the first tug on your heart you
[1:20:18] couldn't make it
[1:20:20] so it doesn't matter if you've been in
[1:20:22] and out and in and out well I can't make
[1:20:24] it you couldn't make it in the first
[1:20:25] place it's not your place to make it
[1:20:30] God already made it for you
[1:20:33] God already made the way the price is
[1:20:36] already paid
[1:20:38] it's not our place to make it it's the
[1:20:41] shepherd's place to make it
[1:20:46] the only thing you have to do is accept
[1:20:48] God's provided way and stand in it no
[1:20:51] matter what take don't move no matter
[1:20:53] what takes place don't move rest
[1:20:56] the Shepherds watching over his sheep
[1:20:58] he knows even a sparrow when it falls
[1:21:03] so how much more does he know about you
[1:21:06] think about that little bitty bird and
[1:21:09] he knows each one that falls
[1:21:11] not one can fall to the ground and he
[1:21:13] don't know about it
[1:21:14] and you don't think he don't know about
[1:21:16] your situation and your needs and your
[1:21:19] troubles and
[1:21:20] where we're at
[1:21:22] he don't know about the political
[1:21:23] climate and the world situation he knows
[1:21:28] he knows he's a shepherd
[1:21:32] he's I noticed another thing in thinking
[1:21:34] about Shepherds
[1:21:36] you know Shepherds of Eastern countries
[1:21:38] have more respect than anybody else
[1:21:40] going down through the streets all at
[1:21:42] once the whistling the cars and stuff he
[1:21:44] said one time I was going down old an
[1:21:46] old British Jeep and first thing you
[1:21:47] know it was a Shepherd crossing the
[1:21:49] street and all the traffic was held up
[1:21:52] and gave him the right-of-way
[1:21:55] he said that's the way our Shepherd is
[1:21:58] he gets the right away
[1:22:02] do you hear that in Services he gets the
[1:22:05] right away
[1:22:07] in every situation he gets the right
[1:22:09] away he decides the path he signed he
[1:22:12] decides the direction it's up to him how
[1:22:14] it goes
[1:22:17] amen I saw as a song leader I'm not
[1:22:19] trying to make it my way or he's got to
[1:22:21] be this song of that song I pray Lord
[1:22:23] this is your service this is your people
[1:22:26] and I want you to do the directing I
[1:22:28] want you to do the leading amen if
[1:22:30] there's a song you want me to sing I'll
[1:22:32] sing it whatever God it is your service
[1:22:36] he deserves the right away
[1:22:41] I know there's a lot of churches don't
[1:22:42] want to give him the right of way they
[1:22:44] want to put up caution signs and this
[1:22:46] sign and stop signs and this and
[1:22:47] nonsense amen the shepherd deserves the
[1:22:49] right of way
[1:22:51] however he wants to go with it let him
[1:22:53] go because he knows better than any
[1:22:54] sheep does
[1:22:57] amen
[1:23:01] he said there was some he said I noticed
[1:23:04] some Shepherds up on a hill one time had
[1:23:06] all kind of different animals
[1:23:08] he's and I thought well I thought
[1:23:10] Shepherds uh Heritage was a herder of
[1:23:13] sheep he said that's right but the
[1:23:16] brother said yes right that's right
[1:23:17] brother Brad I'm a Shepherd is a herder
[1:23:19] or gravesman he says he said so there's
[1:23:22] a lot of different animals they watch
[1:23:24] after he said you know the strange thing
[1:23:26] is the shepherd is attached more to the
[1:23:28] Sheep than anything else they both eat
[1:23:30] the same food the same grass when the
[1:23:32] night time comes the mules the goats
[1:23:34] talking about the animals they're eating
[1:23:35] all the same doing this but the goats
[1:23:37] and the mules are left outside and the
[1:23:40] shepherd causes sheep into the fold I
[1:23:43] thought oh God that's what I want to be
[1:23:44] I want to be a sheep
[1:23:48] amen that's what I want to be I want to
[1:23:50] be a sheep I'm not interested in just
[1:23:52] eating the same grass and just having
[1:23:55] the same food I want to be with the
[1:23:57] shepherd
[1:23:58] I want to be with him because
[1:24:00] nighttime's coming and nighttime is
[1:24:02] going to fall one of these days and just
[1:24:04] to see just the Sheep is the only one
[1:24:06] that's going to go in
[1:24:09] Hallelujah it ain't just about church
[1:24:11] joining and this that and other you you
[1:24:13] don't know Christ by that you know him
[1:24:16] by an experience
[1:24:18] a change of nature
[1:24:22] maybe you find yourself to be a little
[1:24:24] stubborn mule but there is a power that
[1:24:27] can change that nature
[1:24:29] maybe you find yourself to just be a hog
[1:24:32] Waller and out in the world there is a
[1:24:34] power that can change that nature
[1:24:36] hey man that's what it does it don't
[1:24:38] just take a pig and dress him up and
[1:24:40] make him look like a part and put a
[1:24:42] little wool on him and make him look
[1:24:44] kind of like a sheep no this power that
[1:24:46] we're talking about will take up worldly
[1:24:48] Pig and take him out of that old sinful
[1:24:51] thing and bring him out of all that muck
[1:24:53] and all that World stuff and clean him
[1:24:56] up and change him to such a place you
[1:24:58] would never know he was ever a pig
[1:25:02] come on I'm looking at a lot of used to
[1:25:04] be pigs I'm looking at a lot of used to
[1:25:07] be lost Sinners and was out there in the
[1:25:09] world a lot of drunks a lot of dope
[1:25:10] heads a lot of this that and the other
[1:25:12] but God rich and mercy he reached down
[1:25:15] and he picked you up and he brought you
[1:25:17] out and today you would never know you
[1:25:20] never you wouldn't always a sheep
[1:25:24] Hallelujah a lot of people who first
[1:25:27] come in they look around like wow look
[1:25:28] at all this holy Bunch well let me tell
[1:25:30] you something it wasn't always holy at
[1:25:32] one time
[1:25:33] come on we weren't always holy we had a
[1:25:36] lot of things in our lives amen but God
[1:25:39] came down and it began to paint a
[1:25:41] different picture he meant to make us
[1:25:43] over a new and the Creator changed the
[1:25:46] creature
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:56] most of the ones who think they've
[1:25:58] always been holies those are still
[1:25:59] dressed up and ain't nothing but pigs
[1:26:04] amen you said well
[1:26:07] I I got I got I'm part of this church it
[1:26:11] ain't it ain't a Creed it ain't a
[1:26:12] catechism it ain't a church
[1:26:14] it isn't to know the catechism that
[1:26:16] ain't life it's the no Christ
[1:26:18] know the shepherd not to know your
[1:26:20] Creeds not to know the doctrines but to
[1:26:22] know him him alone his life to know him
[1:26:26] another thing is amazing
[1:26:30] the shepherd would come right down to
[1:26:32] the streets
[1:26:33] and on the side men with their produce
[1:26:35] laying out there with all kinds of
[1:26:37] appetizing things for the Sheep
[1:26:40] but the fellow that was driving me in
[1:26:41] the little Jeep he pulled over to one
[1:26:43] side and he said brother Brian watch
[1:26:45] this see that Shepard entering that
[1:26:47] Market Street there and I said yes sir
[1:26:48] now watch him for a few minutes he
[1:26:51] walked down to the street with about 50
[1:26:53] sheep following him right right down
[1:26:54] through there with all them Fine Things
[1:26:56] pears and vegetables laying there which
[1:26:59] would be very tempting to a sheep but
[1:27:01] don't sheep follow the shepherd they
[1:27:03] didn't look right or left
[1:27:05] they just went right through it with the
[1:27:07] shepherd the shepherd could step out of
[1:27:10] out this way and move over this way and
[1:27:12] the every sheep would walk the same line
[1:27:15] the shepherd walks
[1:27:17] I said brother you're gonna have to
[1:27:19] excuse me for a minute I got to jump out
[1:27:21] and praise the Lord
[1:27:23] following the footsteps of the shepherd
[1:27:26] my sheep know my voice and a stranger
[1:27:29] there not followed just move where he
[1:27:31] moves step where he steps amen there's
[1:27:35] all kind of enticing things along life's
[1:27:37] journey it looks all bright and shiny on
[1:27:39] this side and the other but if you are a
[1:27:41] real sheep following the shepherd you're
[1:27:43] not looking to the right you're not
[1:27:45] looking to the left you're looking at
[1:27:47] the shepherd
[1:27:50] and you're watching where he steps and
[1:27:53] you're stepping same footprints

[1:28:12] Sheep of one fold the other sheep have I
[1:28:14] so forth likening people unto sheep

[1:28:21] did you ever how many has ever fooled
[1:28:23] with sheep anybody ever raised sheep or
[1:28:25] had a sheep not very many
[1:28:27] not many Shepherds here

[1:28:39] world
[1:28:45] well I got this education and I got well
[1:28:48] if you're a sheep

[1:28:55] I'm not talking about you know what I'm
[1:28:56] talking about you're smart by his
[1:28:58] standards
[1:29:00] because you're following his oh
[1:29:02] certainly get educational Divine
[1:29:04] education to learn to shoot he said I
[1:29:06] raised them I Shepherd around the little
[1:29:08] fella when the Sheep is lost he's
[1:29:09] absolutely helpless
[1:29:12] helpless
[1:29:16] when you was lost you was absolutely
[1:29:19] helpless
[1:29:21] you couldn't make yourself better if you
[1:29:23] wanted to
[1:29:26] no no
[1:29:27] I picked up a sheep not standing maybe
[1:29:29] 300 yards from the sheepfolding oh where
[1:29:32] all the other sheep was and that sheep
[1:29:34] when he's lost he can't help himself he
[1:29:36] just stands there and bleats and bleats
[1:29:38] and bleats and bleats until the wolf
[1:29:39] gets him or something takes place he
[1:29:41] just can will never find his own way
[1:29:44] back he's totally helpless without a
[1:29:46] Shepherd that's the way human race is we
[1:29:48] were absolutely totally helpless without
[1:29:51] The Shepherd of the fold we can't find
[1:29:54] our way back
[1:29:56] amen we will never on our own strength
[1:29:59] find our way back to Eden
[1:30:01] we'll never find our way back to a body
[1:30:04] change yeah you can try to we've tried
[1:30:06] to educate our way back we try to reform
[1:30:08] our way back it'll never happen
[1:30:10] education will never do it Reformation
[1:30:12] will never do it we're not reformers
[1:30:14] policemen out there they're reform but
[1:30:16] we are preachers of the Gospel
[1:30:18] he said not to try to put people on
[1:30:20] penalty and call on your knees and so
[1:30:22] forth but to preach the Gospel of Jesus
[1:30:25] Christ Deliverance to the people
[1:30:30] Hallelujah
[1:30:32] that's what sheep needs they need some
[1:30:35] sheep food
[1:30:37] you know what the best food sheep food I
[1:30:39] know for is if for you six sheep and all
[1:30:42] kinds of sheep here it is the great big
[1:30:44] bad bread basket of God man shall not
[1:30:47] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:30:49] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:30:50] that's what the Holy Spirit lives on
[1:30:53] that's what lives in you that lives on
[1:30:55] the word of God that is the connection
[1:30:57] of the shepherd and the Sheep
[1:31:04] foreign
[1:31:05] time he was over in the Orient
[1:31:08] learned a great lesson I'd seen it in
[1:31:10] Saint John I'm the Gate of the Sheepfold
[1:31:12] or the door of the Sheepfold often
[1:31:14] wondered how could he be in a man be a
[1:31:16] door
[1:31:17] but then when I was over there I learned
[1:31:18] what it meant Shepherds lead their sheep
[1:31:21] into the Sheepfold and they got an arch
[1:31:23] that goes over it like that and when he
[1:31:26] drives them all in and after all in he
[1:31:28] counts them and if there's one lacking
[1:31:32] it's worth going after
[1:31:35] oh my God if there's one light he'll
[1:31:38] leave the 90 and nine
[1:31:40] and go after that one lost lamb
[1:31:45] Hallelujah don't you don't that give you
[1:31:47] something to know you are important
[1:31:51] it doesn't matter what number you are
[1:31:53] every number is important
[1:32:00] he gives account for the shepherd ever
[1:32:03] or for the Sheep every hour of the day
[1:32:04] no matter where you're at he knows where
[1:32:07] you're at he knows all about you that's
[1:32:08] the reason he can stand on this platform
[1:32:10] through yielded people and reveal and
[1:32:12] tell and talk he knows he knows where
[1:32:15] you where you are was that a year ago he
[1:32:17] knows where you was all the time he has
[1:32:20] to give an account for his sheep
[1:32:21] especially they're all renumbered again
[1:32:24] after they gathered in the foe I thought
[1:32:25] what a beautiful picture Gathering them
[1:32:27] into the fold and numbering them and
[1:32:29] after he gets them all numbered and
[1:32:31] they're all bedded down the Shepherd
[1:32:32] that goes down and lays himself across
[1:32:35] the hole and no wealth can come in and
[1:32:37] no Thief can come in no harm can come in
[1:32:40] unless it comes through the shepherd
[1:32:43] first
[1:32:44] what a picture of Christ laid himself
[1:32:46] for us nothing can harm us unless it
[1:32:49] comes over him he's over the Bride of
[1:32:51] sickness crossed over him but it was for
[1:32:54] the glory of God he wants to give you a
[1:32:57] testimony
[1:33:03] he said I've seen a Shepherd one time
[1:33:04] with a leg all banged up and bandaged up
[1:33:07] so what happened he fell off a cliff he
[1:33:10] said no I broke his leg
[1:33:13] he said oh you must the man said oh you
[1:33:16] must be a cruel Shepherd to break your
[1:33:18] own sheep's leg he said no
[1:33:20] the Sheep wouldn't mind me
[1:33:22] so I broke his leg in order to hold her
[1:33:25] and to pet her and to love her and to
[1:33:28] give her some little special food in
[1:33:31] turn she would love me and follow me
[1:33:35] so sometimes God has to do that to us
[1:33:41] let the doctor say it's over nothing can
[1:33:43] be done
[1:33:49] he just comes over there and he starts
[1:33:51] putting them back together
[1:33:53] amend you and he picks you up
[1:33:57] and he starts Whispering promises and
[1:33:59] you're here
[1:34:01] doctor said it's over but my word said
[1:34:04] I'm the Healer
[1:34:07] the doctor says you're finished and
[1:34:09] you'll never be no better but I paid
[1:34:11] some stripes for you
[1:34:14] he's holding you and he's caring for you
[1:34:16] child of mine don't you know I love you
[1:34:20] don't you know I'm the Lord that healeth
[1:34:22] all that diseases
[1:34:24] but Lord I was taught that the days of
[1:34:26] marriage I know you was
[1:34:28] I just had to let this happen so I could
[1:34:30] show you a little special favor
[1:34:33] now don't you love me just a little more
[1:34:35] now I'm going to let you get well
[1:34:38] did you ever have that just come to you
[1:34:40] I have many times let something happen
[1:34:42] just to check me down a little
[1:34:46] just to check me or check up a little
[1:34:48] however you want to say it check me down
[1:34:50] a little so he can express his love to
[1:34:54] me
[1:34:59] another thing you'll notice to a
[1:35:01] shepherd
[1:35:04] oh
[1:35:07] I'm trying to stay calm here it's a
[1:35:10] disgrace
[1:35:11] for a Shepherd to lose one sheep
[1:35:16] it's a reproach
[1:35:19] it's a disgrace it's a mar on his
[1:35:22] reputation to lose one sheep
[1:35:26] therefore he said all that the father
[1:35:28] hath given me will come
[1:35:33] and I'll not lose one of them
[1:35:37] Hallelujah he faced his own reputation
[1:35:41] on that one promise
[1:35:45] I'm not going to lose one sheep I'm not
[1:35:48] going to lose one son I'm not going to
[1:35:50] lose one daughter but I haven't yet
[1:35:52] could I could a mother forget her
[1:35:54] suckling child yet but how could I ever
[1:35:57] forget you
[1:35:59] oh I'm getting down somewhere now
[1:36:01] because your names are engraved in the
[1:36:05] palm of my hand
[1:36:10] so he's not going to come down to now
[1:36:13] and say well I had 50 but only 25 made
[1:36:17] it no no if you had 50 at the beginning
[1:36:20] there's going to be 50 at the end
[1:36:23] if you had a million at the beginning
[1:36:25] there's going to be a million at the end
[1:36:29] he's not he's his reputation is standing
[1:36:32] upon this amen the shepherd cannot
[1:36:35] afford to lose a sheep that's the reason
[1:36:38] you backslaughter tonight he's still
[1:36:40] hanging around your heart
[1:36:42] he's still trying to draw you back into
[1:36:45] his fold because once he kissed you and
[1:36:48] you kissed him and he told you you loved
[1:36:50] him and you told him you loved him and
[1:36:52] he raised your hands and you praised him
[1:36:54] but then you're back slid and you went
[1:36:56] out and got all butchered up and wounded
[1:36:58] in your spirit but he's still hanging
[1:37:00] around he's still saying come on back
[1:37:03] wondering Chief I can't afford to let
[1:37:06] you be lost
[1:37:08] Hallelujah he's a man who owns a cattle
[1:37:11] on a thousand hills he's got riches
[1:37:13] Untold but he cannot afford to lose one
[1:37:17] shake
[1:37:19] he can't afford to lose one backslider
[1:37:22] he can't afford to lose one of his
[1:37:24] because it's his reputation
[1:37:30] come on back
[1:37:32] maybe the little sheep that had to go
[1:37:34] way out in the mountain to find all
[1:37:36] through the place maybe you're that
[1:37:37] sheep tonight laying out here wounded
[1:37:40] somewhere but the shepherd will not lose
[1:37:42] one of his
[1:37:46] you know how the shepherd knows his
[1:37:49] sheep from other sheep
[1:37:51] because his sheep are branded they're
[1:37:54] marked you know what they carry what
[1:37:56] Mark they carry they carry the mark of
[1:37:58] the shepherd
[1:38:00] all right amen the Sheep was marked he
[1:38:03] said oh that's like you say well that's
[1:38:06] all right preacher but how you know all
[1:38:07] these marks in all right everybody was
[1:38:09] marked one marked this weight one marked
[1:38:11] that one at the Orthodox one
[1:38:12] Episcopalian this and the other but wait
[1:38:14] a minute the shepherd bore the mark of
[1:38:16] his sheep in his hand if you want to
[1:38:18] know what the sheep that the shepherd
[1:38:20] got the mark in his hand how appropriate
[1:38:22] that is tonight of our great Shepherd
[1:38:24] this marked he said a woman might forget
[1:38:26] her mother her child forget her little
[1:38:28] suck them babe but I'll never forget you
[1:38:31] because your names are written in my
[1:38:32] hand marked the shepherd carries the
[1:38:35] mark of a sheath I know my sheep and my
[1:38:38] sheep know me why the mark they marked
[1:38:41] the same mark
[1:38:43] so they are marked with the same Mark
[1:38:45] he's marked with
[1:38:47] and he's marked with the same Mark damn
[1:38:49] marked with that his church has got the
[1:38:53] same mark
[1:38:55] what kind of Mark did he have
[1:38:56] spiritually speaking he was despised he
[1:38:59] was rejected he was a man of sorrow he
[1:39:01] was acquainted with grief he was called
[1:39:03] all kind of ungodly days amen but God
[1:39:06] was with him
[1:39:08] you want to hear about his marks God was
[1:39:10] with him signs and wonders was with him
[1:39:12] everywhere he went he could design the
[1:39:14] thoughts of the intents that are he said
[1:39:16] I do as a father show me the secret Hill
[1:39:19] the dead were raised the poor had the
[1:39:21] gospel priest and tonight the Church of
[1:39:24] the Living God bears that same Mark of
[1:39:27] the Living God on the inside of her
[1:39:30] well therefore amen they may be despised
[1:39:34] they may be rejected they may go through
[1:39:36] all kinds of things about the sick are
[1:39:38] healed and the dead are raised and the
[1:39:41] poor has the gospel preached to them and
[1:39:43] signs and wonders are following them why
[1:39:45] because they bear the same Mark that the
[1:39:48] shepherd bore
[1:39:52] might be called a fanatic he was too
[1:39:55] you might be called a Holy Roller he was
[1:39:57] too
[1:39:59] you might be called all kinds of things
[1:40:01] he was too he was people hated him you
[1:40:05] will be hated too
[1:40:07] foreign
[1:40:09] because he did right because he did good
[1:40:11] Stephen the first martyr died because he
[1:40:14] told them they were stiff-necked
[1:40:16] uncircumcised in heart and ears and they
[1:40:19] were resisting the Holy Ghost
[1:40:22] hello somebody
[1:40:26] but he was branded with the same brand
[1:40:28] the shepherd was branded with
[1:40:36] how happy we ought to be
[1:40:38] two thousand years later to see the same
[1:40:41] Holy Ghost
[1:40:42] working in the same kind of people
[1:40:45] causing the same results from the
[1:40:48] outside the point of scornful finger and
[1:40:50] also the same results on the inside for
[1:40:52] a resurrected Jesus Christ stretching
[1:40:55] forth his hands to do the same signs and
[1:40:58] wonders he did at the beginning
[1:40:59] Shepherds and sheep I'm so glad to Bear
[1:41:03] the same mark
[1:41:07] he's a sovereign God
[1:41:09] buys on Council he purposed to plan a
[1:41:13] Salvation of his own elect which he
[1:41:15] foreknew
[1:41:16] the son died upon the cross to establish
[1:41:19] the means of Salvation and the Holy
[1:41:21] Spirit carefully now executes the will
[1:41:23] of the father he is working all things
[1:41:26] at this moment according to the purpose
[1:41:29] of his will he's right in the midst of
[1:41:31] it all he's right in the midst of his
[1:41:33] church this great Creator this savior
[1:41:36] God is Faithfully working among his own
[1:41:39] right now as the great Shepherd of the
[1:41:41] Sheep
[1:41:43] his very existence is for his own
[1:41:50] he loves him and he cares for them his
[1:41:53] eyes ever upon them when the word says
[1:41:56] that your lives are HID with Christ and
[1:41:58] God it means exactly what it says I'm so
[1:42:01] glad that my God abides faith for he is
[1:42:04] true to himself he won't lie he's true
[1:42:06] to his word he will back it up he's true
[1:42:08] to us he will not lose one of us
[1:42:12] amen we need to tell the devil that
[1:42:14] he'll not lose one of us we're not
[1:42:16] leaving a hook behind
[1:42:22] I'm glad I can rest in that kind of
[1:42:26] faithfulness
[1:42:28] as we close let's look at Ezekiel 34 and
[1:42:30] verse 11.
[1:42:40] he says for thus saith the Lord God
[1:42:44] behold I
[1:42:46] even I will both search for my sheep
[1:42:50] and seek them out
[1:42:52] as a Shepherd seeketh out his flock in
[1:42:54] the day that he is among his sheep that
[1:42:57] are scattered so will I seek out my
[1:43:00] sheep and we'll deliver them out of all
[1:43:03] the places where they've been scattered
[1:43:05] in the Cloudy and dark day
[1:43:09] and I will bring them out from the
[1:43:10] people and gather them from the
[1:43:12] countries and we'll bring them to their
[1:43:14] own land and feed them upon the
[1:43:16] mountains of Israel by the rivers and
[1:43:18] all the inhabited places of the country
[1:43:20] I will feed them in the good pasture and
[1:43:23] upon high places of Israel's
[1:43:26] of Israel Shadow Phoebe there shall they
[1:43:29] lie in a good fold and in a fat pasture
[1:43:32] so they feed upon the mountains of
[1:43:33] Israel I will feed my flock and I will
[1:43:37] cause them to lie down saith the Lord
[1:43:38] God I will seek that which was lost and
[1:43:42] bring again that which was driven away
[1:43:44] and will bind up that which was broken
[1:43:47] and will strengthen that which was sick
[1:43:51] but I will destroy the fat and the
[1:43:54] strong the world and I will feed them
[1:43:58] with judgment
