[51:39] it is their Lord that we approach and we
[51:42] approach with boldness
[51:44] because Lord you bid us to come
[51:48] you made the way that we could freely
[51:50] come
[51:52] between the door of
[51:54] mortal and immortality between the door
[51:58] of the natural Realms and into the
[52:01] supernatural
[52:03] we walk through that door
[52:06] we kneel at the throne
[52:08] we come boldly there knowing that our
[52:11] requests will be met
[52:14] Lord knowing that you're The God Who
[52:18] actually became man so that we could
[52:21] make this approach
[52:24] that you would be the intercessor
[52:27] that would make the way for us and open
[52:30] the door to heaven where that we could
[52:33] come before the throne
[52:35] and find Grace and help in our time of
[52:39] need
[52:40] Lord there are those that are needy
[52:42] today and are needing a touch from you

[52:59] you'll meet with them today

[53:04] situations that we are in agreement with

[53:12] join their faith together
[53:14] that all of hell has to give way and
[53:18] move back

[53:21] spoken

[53:24] something spectacular and wonderful in
[53:27] this day
[53:28] I'm glad to be a part of the moving of
[53:31] your Holy Spirit
[53:32] knowing Lord that you'll never take any
[53:34] of your word back but Lord that you will
[53:38] fulfill every Divine promise that you
[53:40] made and I'm looking to you today Lord
[53:43] to come on the scene for your children

[54:03] are the people o God that have been
[54:05] called for this day for this hour and we
[54:08] know our position in the word and we
[54:10] take authority today over every demon
[54:13] Spirit or wherever it's every Spirit of
[54:15] hell that would want to come against
[54:18] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[54:22] certainly
[54:23] Lord heaven is moving today things are
[54:27] changing Lord they can't remain the same
[54:31] because Lord you're in control of this
[54:33] situation and when you move Lord things
[54:36] happen and I pray oh God that you'll

[55:33] believing today for brother Ron Spencer

[55:54] been said in order in place and the
[55:57] trigger is being pulled and something is
[56:00] happening as the as you wind up and you

[56:50] to give you the desires of your heart

[56:55] assembled with us I pray that the Lord
[56:58] will
[56:59] um just be with you in a mighty mighty
[57:02] way and
[57:03] and uh so if you'll turn with me to
[57:06] Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9 we're
[57:09] just going to get right into the word
[57:10] I've got a lot of things that I'd like
[57:13] to minister on today a lot of places I'd
[57:15] like to go
[57:16] um in the sermon that as we will look
[57:20] into
[57:21] the manifold wisdom of God and what he's
[57:24] doing in this last day and and with the
[57:27] full Assurance of this promise I'm going
[57:30] to speak to you today on God remembers
[57:34] God remembers
[57:36] Genesis 18 and 9 and they said unto him
[57:39] where is Sarah thy wife and he said
[57:41] behold in the tent
[57:43] and he said I will certainly return unto
[57:46] thee according to the time of life and
[57:48] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son then
[57:50] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[57:52] was behind him now Sarah Abraham and
[57:55] Sarah were old and well-stricken in age
[57:59] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[58:01] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[58:04] within herself saying after I am waxed
[58:07] old shall I have pleasure my Lord being
[58:10] old also God bless you you can be seated
[58:15] but Sarah had long forgotten the
[58:18] promises that God had given to to God to
[58:22] Abraham
[58:24] and she she felt as if she had solved
[58:27] this issue many years ago when she
[58:30] concluded that she was not the one to
[58:33] fulfill the promise and had given Hagar
[58:37] to Abraham to fulfill it
[58:40] but you know when God gives a word he
[58:43] has a plan and he's got a purpose
[58:46] and if he's got a plan for your life
[58:48] there's nothing going to stop that
[58:51] and I believe that we are people of a
[58:53] purpose today that are called and
[58:56] ordained for a reason in this hour
[58:59] and I believe that you know where we're
[59:01] living in we are living in also a
[59:04] fulfillment of promise
[59:07] and this fulfillment of Promise is
[59:09] almost a forgotten promise
[59:12] by the people like Sarah in that day
[59:16] and this is a promise I want to go to is
[59:18] revelation 22 and verse 20 is actually
[59:22] the the last things that concludes our
[59:25] Book of Revelation the unveiling of God
[59:28] and and um and and it says here as he
[59:32] the spirit concludes our book he says he
[59:36] which testifieth these things or gives
[59:39] witness to these things saith surely I
[59:43] come quickly amen even so come Lord
[59:47] Jesus
[59:49] I think this is a very
[59:51] um
[59:52] great and wonderful thought as we look
[59:55] into the Fulfillment of the the New
[59:59] Testament
[1:00:00] we we would have to conclude that this
[1:00:03] was speaking to us because I believe we
[1:00:06] are the Fulfillment
[1:00:07] of the of the word of God that we're
[1:00:10] here in the day and hour we're feeling
[1:00:12] fulfilling everything that was spoken of
[1:00:16] a bride people
[1:00:17] and of course this is 2 000 years go for
[1:00:21] us but with God a thousand years is by
[1:00:24] the day so this is only yesterday that
[1:00:26] he said this
[1:00:27] but I believe that this is said
[1:00:30] specifically to the generation that to
[1:00:35] this generation and this was actually
[1:00:37] written to us
[1:00:38] the last generation and he said he that
[1:00:42] testified these things saith surely I
[1:00:46] come quickly and to that John says amen
[1:00:51] now John has typed the bride all the way
[1:00:54] through remember the Book of Revelation
[1:00:55] is a symbolic book
[1:00:57] and John will actually represent
[1:01:02] um us as he looks into the things that
[1:01:06] are going to be about the end time and
[1:01:08] and so many many of these scriptures
[1:01:11] John is actually representing the entire
[1:01:14] bride of Christ
[1:01:16] and so John says Amen to these things
[1:01:19] when he says surely I come quickly and
[1:01:23] John says amen and of course he's typed
[1:01:25] the bride the redeemed of the Lord all
[1:01:28] the way through and and of course as
[1:01:31] John does this you can see then the
[1:01:34] bride to fulfill this must get an
[1:01:37] agreement with this word When God Says
[1:01:41] behold I come quickly
[1:01:43] to a generation to an age and I want to
[1:01:47] say again I believe it's to our age that
[1:01:49] he is saying this
[1:01:51] not just to them of 2000 years ago or
[1:01:54] them of of the mid um the church ages
[1:01:57] but right here at the last age was
[1:01:59] really to this to this people that it
[1:02:02] was written and he is saying to you
[1:02:04] behold I come quickly because we are in
[1:02:08] the age in the day of his coming
[1:02:12] and being in the day of his coming
[1:02:14] you're going to have to get in agreement
[1:02:17] with it when he says behold I come
[1:02:19] quickly John representing the bride and
[1:02:22] to be the bride you're going to have to
[1:02:24] say the same thing amen
[1:02:27] and then you you see he says I come
[1:02:30] quickly amen he got in agreement with it
[1:02:33] immediately
[1:02:35] so we're gonna have to have a people
[1:02:37] that are in agreement of his of his
[1:02:41] coming
[1:02:42] that they they are not they're not just
[1:02:45] laying back and and unbelief but now
[1:02:49] they're in agreement with him this is
[1:02:51] what he's trying to do with Sarah in the
[1:02:53] scripture trying to get her in agreement
[1:02:56] but of course she has these objections
[1:02:59] as to why it can't happen for her in her
[1:03:02] day and and maybe how this is somehow
[1:03:04] another uh for somebody else for for
[1:03:07] something that's already happened and
[1:03:09] and it's a about a god of yesterday not
[1:03:13] a god of today
[1:03:15] and he has to bring it clear to her that
[1:03:18] there's nothing too hard for him
[1:03:20] and so we're gonna too have to get an
[1:03:23] agreement with what the spirit is saying
[1:03:27] I've I've given Witness
[1:03:29] and I want you to know that we are in an
[1:03:32] age in a time where God has given more
[1:03:36] Witness
[1:03:37] to the promises of his word then
[1:03:40] actually any age that there's ever been
[1:03:44] God has left no excuse for our unbelief
[1:03:48] in this hour
[1:03:49] he has made every way where that you
[1:03:51] would have a firm and constant faith in
[1:03:55] the promises of God he showed you I can
[1:03:57] heal anything I can deliver anything I
[1:04:01] can restore I am I am God there is
[1:04:04] nothing too hard for me and so there has
[1:04:08] to be a people then come in agreement
[1:04:11] with it and then begin to pray the last
[1:04:16] prayer of the Bible which says even so
[1:04:20] come Lord Jesus
[1:04:24] this must become the bride's prayer
[1:04:28] in agreement with his coming
[1:04:31] and the prayer for his coming
[1:04:33] now as we look at this as I said it has
[1:04:38] to become I prayer and I believe that
[1:04:41] this is why the evil of the last days
[1:04:44] becomes Sodom was before the burning so
[1:04:49] sinful that God could not tolerate it
[1:04:52] anymore
[1:04:53] I want you to understand you know maybe
[1:04:56] your level of Toleration has already
[1:04:58] reached its limit but God God comes a
[1:05:02] point that he cannot tolerate it any
[1:05:04] longer
[1:05:06] and this is got to become our prayer it
[1:05:09] must become the driving force behind
[1:05:13] behind every decision we make by every
[1:05:16] action that we take
[1:05:18] amen it must be our focus in this day of
[1:05:22] behold I come quickly
[1:05:25] now here is with Sarah God had given a
[1:05:28] promise he had not forgotten it
[1:05:30] ishmael's birth did not annul it
[1:05:33] but God remembered his promise
[1:05:37] but not as though he had forgotten
[1:05:40] I wanted to understand that God doesn't
[1:05:43] forget God bless you Sister Genie hadn't
[1:05:45] forgotten you either amen good to have
[1:05:47] you in service today but you say but
[1:05:51] again he is not forgotten us to say that
[1:05:55] God remembers us to say he is doing
[1:05:57] exactly what he has promised God that
[1:06:02] never forgets so again I want to cover
[1:06:05] it again to say that God remembers is to
[1:06:08] say that God is doing exactly what he
[1:06:12] had promised it may not be what we
[1:06:14] thought he would do or how he we thought
[1:06:17] he would bring it to pass but God is a
[1:06:20] plan and God has a purpose
[1:06:22] even for your suffering God has a
[1:06:25] purpose because he said otherwise God
[1:06:28] would be the author of confusion instead
[1:06:31] of the author of Peace so God has a
[1:06:34] purpose and a plan for everything that
[1:06:36] we are going through
[1:06:38] and in every instance of God remembering
[1:06:41] we we see it as always includes action
[1:06:45] when God remembers he has become the ACT
[1:06:49] God never forgets his promises or his
[1:06:52] people he is Alpha and Omega the
[1:06:55] beginning and the end the creator of the
[1:06:58] universe and he doesn't suffer memory
[1:07:00] lapses
[1:07:01] in every instance if God remembering
[1:07:04] that we see in the Old Testament that it
[1:07:06] always includes an action for example
[1:07:09] God remembered Noah and made the waters
[1:07:12] recede and years later after hearing the
[1:07:15] Hebrews
[1:07:17] cry down in Egypt God remembered his
[1:07:21] Covenant with their ancestors and and he
[1:07:24] rescued them or delivered them out of
[1:07:26] that sin of prophet with a pillar of
[1:07:28] Fire
[1:07:29] and and so that but there are times that
[1:07:32] we feel like as human that God forgets
[1:07:35] us even as Israel they for they got to
[1:07:38] the point of God has forgotten us Zion
[1:07:41] said the Lord has forsaken me God has
[1:07:44] forgotten us but he said Can a mother
[1:07:47] forget the baby at her breast and have
[1:07:50] no compassion on the child she is born
[1:07:53] those she may forget
[1:07:55] I will not forget you you see I have
[1:07:59] engraved you on the palms of my hands so
[1:08:03] God is not one that forgets but God is
[1:08:07] one who remembers and when he remembers
[1:08:11] a promise he puts his word into action
[1:08:15] so we're in the day and hour where that
[1:08:19] the word is being activated to fulfill
[1:08:23] the promises of his word so we're living
[1:08:26] in the film the days of the fulfill
[1:08:29] woman of the word of God God is
[1:08:32] remembered his promise and his appearing
[1:08:34] in his age to fulfill it after a long
[1:08:37] delay of 2 000 years
[1:08:40] and of course you know even some of the
[1:08:42] events that happened made men like Jack
[1:08:45] Moore and Gordon Lindsay write in their
[1:08:46] book you know Bible days are here again
[1:08:49] because they could see that God had
[1:08:52] remembered his promise and now the word
[1:08:55] was coming into action Sarah and Abraham
[1:08:59] their promise had been delayed for two
[1:09:02] for 25 years but when God called Abraham
[1:09:05] and gave him the promise of his son and
[1:09:08] becoming a nation you know maybe it was
[1:09:12] plausible then it was possible then even
[1:09:15] though it was still unlikely he was 75
[1:09:17] Sarah was 65 but you know even when the
[1:09:21] promise given seemed impossible and
[1:09:25] Satan delayed it anymore God had not
[1:09:28] forgotten it
[1:09:29] and with God he's never too late and
[1:09:33] there's nothing ever that is too hard
[1:09:35] for God
[1:09:36] so when things even get more difficult
[1:09:39] seems like it's less possible less
[1:09:42] possible all reasoning is all against it
[1:09:46] that's when God is moving
[1:09:49] and I want you to understand that in
[1:09:51] your situation God will not forget you
[1:09:54] he will remember you in your situation
[1:09:58] because he said I cannot forget you
[1:10:01] you know you may forget to pray for me I
[1:10:04] may forget to pray for you but God
[1:10:07] cannot look at his hands without
[1:10:08] remembering you
[1:10:10] so in the days of Noah while the ark Was
[1:10:13] preparing when the once the last one is
[1:10:16] in the ark the Deluge begins
[1:10:19] there has been a delay of 120 years
[1:10:23] it was a long time general you know a
[1:10:26] whole generation of people were born
[1:10:28] maybe others died the long suffering of
[1:10:31] God every day seemed like just another
[1:10:34] day
[1:10:35] and there was no rain there was no
[1:10:38] clouds there was no Thunders there was
[1:10:41] no warning other than a prophet's Voice
[1:10:43] who warned about the coming judgment
[1:10:47] and the day the Deluge began it probably
[1:10:50] began with another bright shining
[1:10:52] morning
[1:10:54] now and of course when when uh when this
[1:10:57] happens like this and there seems like
[1:11:00] God is forgot and the word of the
[1:11:03] Prophet is not going to come to pass you
[1:11:05] know then the promises and the prophet
[1:11:08] is mocked
[1:11:09] amen so it is today it is as the Bible
[1:11:12] prophesied at the end time it it speaks
[1:11:15] of the coming of the Lord and and the
[1:11:18] time of the process of fulfillment that
[1:11:21] and it and sometimes it looks like that
[1:11:24] God has forgotten you know that in this
[1:11:27] delay uh nothing is happening but things
[1:11:30] were Contin you know and that things are
[1:11:33] just continuing on like it's always done
[1:11:37] I want just to say to you that I believe
[1:11:40] the Rapture Day that day where when the
[1:11:43] the change comes when the dead in Christ
[1:11:47] rise it will be another day just as
[1:11:50] usual
[1:11:51] the sun will come up just like it always
[1:11:54] was you see the Morning News will be the
[1:11:58] same with politics and rapes and murders
[1:12:01] and bombings and troubles and and strife
[1:12:05] everywhere life will be going on as
[1:12:09] usual
[1:12:10] yet it'll be a very unusual day because
[1:12:14] it'll also be a supernatural morning the
[1:12:18] dead in Christ will suddenly appear and
[1:12:20] the change will be on
[1:12:25] but think of it for most it'll be a day
[1:12:29] just the same
[1:12:31] nothing unusual no changes everything
[1:12:35] the same nothing's happening
[1:12:38] and there's something very Supernatural
[1:12:42] is happening
[1:12:45] and yet
[1:12:46] but the world left behind
[1:12:49] things will swiftly change
[1:12:52] and it'll change for the worst his light
[1:12:54] will be gone
[1:12:55] the holy spirit will lift from the earth
[1:12:57] the mighty Angel who holds down the evil
[1:13:01] beastly powers of upon the land and the
[1:13:04] Sea will lift his feet and the bride of
[1:13:06] Christ will lead from here and once he
[1:13:09] leaves all restraints will be lifted
[1:13:11] from Satan and he'll become the full
[1:13:14] King of the Earth
[1:13:15] and hell will take full residence upon
[1:13:18] the Earth and Satan's kingdom will be
[1:13:21] here in full force
[1:13:25] it might not but he's going to have his
[1:13:27] kingdom upon the Earth and guess what
[1:13:29] during that time as I explained last
[1:13:31] Sunday God gets revenge
[1:13:34] he don't get to enjoy his kingdom
[1:13:36] without a torment or two
[1:13:38] because God will torment in him by
[1:13:41] pouring out the plagues and bringing him
[1:13:43] into chains and and chain him for a
[1:13:46] thousand years are you with me now and
[1:13:49] of course the Bible tells us though it's
[1:13:52] going to be a terrible time for those
[1:13:53] that are left behind that he says woe to
[1:13:57] the inhabitors of the Earth for the
[1:13:59] devil has come down to you
[1:14:02] but he says to those who have been
[1:14:04] raptured to those who are now in the
[1:14:07] Heavenly Dimensions Rejoice O heavens
[1:14:09] and you who dwell with them but woe to
[1:14:12] them on the earth and the Sea and for
[1:14:14] the devil has come down to you in great
[1:14:16] wrath because he knows his time is short
[1:14:19] and then he immediately pursues the
[1:14:22] woman Israel and the remnant of her seed
[1:14:26] now
[1:14:27] we read last Sunday
[1:14:29] from Peter's Second Epistle he tells you
[1:14:33] what happens
[1:14:34] when men begin to say in their heart the
[1:14:37] Lord's delayed is coming
[1:14:39] when it looks like that God has
[1:14:41] forgotten and things will remain the
[1:14:44] same
[1:14:45] people's attitude will turn to scoffing
[1:14:49] and that men who once walked with God
[1:14:52] will begin to walk in their own lust
[1:14:55] and I believe we're in the time where
[1:14:58] when most of Christendom has given up on
[1:15:02] the coming of the promised son they've
[1:15:05] just settled down to church joining and
[1:15:07] Holiness people like the methodists for
[1:15:10] example who were thought of as Holiness
[1:15:12] people some years ago many of now have
[1:15:14] joined with the sodomites others are now
[1:15:17] pulling away from a new denomination and
[1:15:21] there's there's much upheaval that is
[1:15:24] going on
[1:15:25] and you might ask me where are we in
[1:15:28] time oh well this is nearly to 2023
[1:15:32] brother Tim no where are we in Bible
[1:15:35] prophecy
[1:15:36] where are we in the scripture
[1:15:40] and I want to press upon you today by
[1:15:42] the scripture that where we are we we
[1:15:45] are now in a time where the prevailing
[1:15:49] attitude of many is that the Lord has
[1:15:53] forgotten his original objective
[1:15:56] and they are saying that the Lord has
[1:16:00] delayed his coming and so they have just
[1:16:02] pushed it away it's no longer in the
[1:16:05] Forefront of their thinking it's no
[1:16:08] longer the attitude of living every day
[1:16:11] as if he's coming today so they come
[1:16:14] into a LAX attitude and this becomes
[1:16:17] even more prevalent here as a laodicean
[1:16:20] spirit comes and anoints people and if
[1:16:23] you're not careful that attitude will
[1:16:25] show up and nearly everything you do or
[1:16:28] say
[1:16:29] and you know and it's not necessarily
[1:16:32] something that will be verbalized but
[1:16:35] it'll be an attitude
[1:16:37] that attitude will be shown in church
[1:16:40] attendance where you were urged and told
[1:16:43] well you know that as we see that day
[1:16:46] approaching make sure you assemble
[1:16:48] together
[1:16:49] you're going to need strength from one
[1:16:51] another you're going to have to hear the
[1:16:54] word of God to be fortified you're going
[1:16:56] to have to gather together in his name
[1:16:58] even more but you know men use every
[1:17:02] kind of excuses when you know again this
[1:17:05] is no longer in the Forefront of their
[1:17:08] mind or their thinking you know they
[1:17:10] become into the time of delay words and
[1:17:14] their attitude I just say it this way
[1:17:17] their attitude really stinks you know
[1:17:19] because they act as if they're gonna
[1:17:22] things are just gonna always remain the
[1:17:25] same as they've always been but I want
[1:17:28] to infer to you today that we are here
[1:17:31] at the moment of change
[1:17:34] we are here at a moment where that that
[1:17:37] is suddenly things can begin to happen
[1:17:40] and I want to and I I don't want to
[1:17:43] diminish what is happening looking for
[1:17:46] what's going to happen because God is
[1:17:48] actually moving behind the scenes
[1:17:52] already working but sometimes we get so
[1:17:55] caught up with the news and the world
[1:17:57] and what it's doing and our daily lives
[1:18:00] until it becomes oblivious to us what
[1:18:03] God is really doing
[1:18:05] but I want you to begin to realize and
[1:18:08] be conscious that in this age God has
[1:18:11] been doing and is doing spectacular
[1:18:14] things as he winds up the end time
[1:18:18] events
[1:18:19] you're special people
[1:18:22] to be a part of this age
[1:18:26] but also there are those that are also a
[1:18:29] special people that are so specially
[1:18:31] evil
[1:18:34] yeah
[1:18:35] because the Bible tells you
[1:18:38] very clearly he said understand this
[1:18:41] in the last days terrible days are
[1:18:44] coming
[1:18:45] for men will be lovers of their own
[1:18:47] selves
[1:18:49] lovers of money and boastful and
[1:18:51] arrogant abusive and disobedient to
[1:18:53] parents and ungrateful Unholy unloving
[1:18:56] unforgiving Slanders without
[1:18:58] self-control brutal without love of good
[1:19:01] and uh and traitors and Reckless and
[1:19:04] conceited and lovers of Pleasures more
[1:19:06] than lovers of God having a form of
[1:19:09] godliness but denied his power and he
[1:19:12] said turn away from these
[1:19:13] you turn away from them you avoid that
[1:19:18] amen and then and he said these are the
[1:19:21] kind who wormed away in the households
[1:19:23] and Captivate vulnerable women which
[1:19:25] brother Brandon said her churches who
[1:19:27] are weighed down with sins and led
[1:19:29] astray by various passions who are
[1:19:31] always learning but never able to come
[1:19:34] to the knowledge of the truth and just
[1:19:36] as Janice and jambres oppose Moses so do
[1:19:40] these men oppose the truth
[1:19:45] so again it speaks of this anointing in
[1:19:47] this last day
[1:19:49] opposing the truth
[1:19:51] the truth will be opposed
[1:19:57] might as well get used to it
[1:20:00] might as well be prepared for might as
[1:20:03] well not be shocked by it the truth will
[1:20:06] be opposed
[1:20:09] I wanted to say even even right down to
[1:20:12] the end to the last message even within
[1:20:15] the last followers of the message the
[1:20:18] truth will be opposed
[1:20:21] because the last place to reject him is
[1:20:24] those who call theirselves message
[1:20:31] so truth will be opposed
[1:20:34] but I want to just impress upon you
[1:20:36] today God is right on time
[1:20:40] nothing is out of order
[1:20:42] God at an appointed time and and the
[1:20:45] wheels of God's cogs of Prophecy of
[1:20:48] Brethren would say it you know grind
[1:20:50] slow but sure and I want to reassure you
[1:20:53] today God has not forgotten one of his
[1:20:56] promise
[1:20:57] amen and and I I'd like to step back
[1:21:00] today and look at the age that we're not
[1:21:03] living in
[1:21:04] where that God has been doing great and
[1:21:08] mighty things in our generation
[1:21:11] preparing you trying to do everything
[1:21:14] you can to get a faith within your heart
[1:21:17] to believe
[1:21:18] and there are many things that has
[1:21:21] already happened to show us that God has
[1:21:24] not forgotten us
[1:21:26] you know all the types in the Bible
[1:21:28] whether whether of women such as Sarah
[1:21:32] or Rebecca or Ruth or Rahab or Esther
[1:21:35] the Virgin Mary or men such as Enoch or
[1:21:39] Abraham or Moses with the Exodus or
[1:21:41] Joshua with the placing into the
[1:21:44] inheritance every one of these every one
[1:21:46] of them was speaking of and prophesying
[1:21:50] and pointing to you people in this hour
[1:21:54] amen there are more than stories in the
[1:21:57] Bible there are Prophecies of the last
[1:21:59] day
[1:22:00] and Jesus Christ himself was the
[1:22:02] Fulfillment of the Old Testament so the
[1:22:05] bride which is Christ in feminine form
[1:22:09] his body must be the Fulfillment of all
[1:22:14] the scripture but both of the old and
[1:22:17] the New Testament and since he was a
[1:22:19] groomed the bride has to come forth
[1:22:23] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:22:26] the bride will will have to be on on the
[1:22:30] display of the fulfilling of all the
[1:22:33] revelations that the biblical Patriarchs
[1:22:36] have spoken and prophesied with their
[1:22:39] lives
[1:22:41] so if the Bible's if the bride rather
[1:22:43] says and or does something different
[1:22:46] from the groom you know it isn't the
[1:22:48] bride
[1:22:49] amen because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:22:52] and bone of his bone in life of his life
[1:22:55] and power of his power she is him and as
[1:22:59] a man and a woman becomes one at the
[1:23:02] wedding so must Christ and his bride
[1:23:05] become one
[1:23:08] one in signs one it works one in faith
[1:23:12] one in Doctrine
[1:23:14] Now Eve was taken from Adam's side and
[1:23:18] The Feminine Spirit was taken from him
[1:23:20] in place within her so much the life and
[1:23:23] the spirit of Christ
[1:23:25] be in the bride
[1:23:28] and that man will make of the Bride both
[1:23:31] mechanics and Dynamics the word
[1:23:34] empowered by the spirit
[1:23:37] I want you to say we are anointed with
[1:23:40] the same spirit that made Jesus the
[1:23:42] Messiah
[1:23:43] and that makes us anointed Messiahs to
[1:23:47] shine forth the resurrection of Jesus
[1:23:50] Christ to show that he is not dead
[1:23:54] but he is here in bright form by the
[1:23:58] Holy Ghost
[1:23:59] God the in his people
[1:24:01] so Jesus the bridegroom is here he is
[1:24:04] here in his people and he is moving
[1:24:07] among his pride with a love affair
[1:24:10] pouring out into her himself
[1:24:14] I want to assert to you today that we
[1:24:16] are still in the days of the pouring out
[1:24:19] of God's spirit and there is still more
[1:24:22] of the spirit of God for you to receive
[1:24:25] D amen the bride becoming one with him
[1:24:28] for the wedding supper and the same
[1:24:31] signs that are spoken the word that
[1:24:33] spoke of Jesus is now to be displayed by
[1:24:36] the same manifestations that Jesus had
[1:24:39] and when we believe that it creates a
[1:24:42] perfect faith that would and that and
[1:24:45] it's that perfect faith that it takes
[1:24:47] for a Rapture if the groom said the work
[1:24:50] said I do shall you do also you know it
[1:24:54] must not be dismissed
[1:24:56] it must not just say well that was for
[1:24:58] brother Branham it must be it must be
[1:25:02] that we realize the works that I do
[1:25:05] shall you do also and it must be
[1:25:08] displayed in the bride
[1:25:11] a minute the word spoken by Joel says in
[1:25:14] the last days I will pour out my spirit
[1:25:16] upon All Flesh then the bride must be
[1:25:19] the vessel it is poured out into
[1:25:22] somebody is going to be the recipient of
[1:25:25] that
[1:25:27] Hallelujah at Mark 16 says these signs
[1:25:30] shall follow them that believe they will
[1:25:32] speak with new tongues they shall lay
[1:25:34] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:25:37] then it has to happen
[1:25:40] she must be like the groom
[1:25:42] the fullness of the word the godhead
[1:25:45] bodily
[1:25:46] she must fulfill Isaiah's prophecy of
[1:25:49] the Horizon sign for thy light has come
[1:25:52] she must fulfill the word spoken of the
[1:25:55] with the spoken of the groom because she
[1:25:57] is one with him and that is the spirit
[1:26:00] the Lord is upon me because he has
[1:26:02] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:26:06] poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:26:08] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:26:10] the captive and recovering of the sight
[1:26:13] to the blind to seventh Liberty that
[1:26:15] were of them that were bruised amen this
[1:26:19] is this is the anointing that is among
[1:26:22] the bride in the last day she must have
[1:26:25] the spirit upon her to preach the gospel
[1:26:28] to the poor to preach Deliverance to the
[1:26:31] captives terrific to preach the
[1:26:34] recovering of the sight to the Blind and
[1:26:37] to set at Liberty I want you to know it
[1:26:41] it's not just preaching but it's also
[1:26:44] setting at Liberty them that are bound
[1:26:47] amen so you see and then to preach the
[1:26:51] acceptable year of the Lord and I just
[1:26:54] want you to know we are still in the
[1:26:57] acceptable year of the Lord
[1:26:59] this is the Fallen the Fulfillment of
[1:27:03] the true Pentecost of The Seven Ages of
[1:27:06] the of the seven weeks of where where
[1:27:10] that it comes and then on the 50th day
[1:27:12] the day of Pentecost fully comes so
[1:27:15] we're in the day of the Lord's
[1:27:17] acceptance
[1:27:18] God is setting or is accepting a bride
[1:27:21] taking her into rapture
[1:27:23] amen we are here in a day of acceptance
[1:27:28] you are not a rejected people you are an
[1:27:31] accepted people
[1:27:33] and you see God cannot forget his
[1:27:36] promises if God was prophesied through
[1:27:39] all of these in the Bible God cannot let
[1:27:41] one word of that prophecy fail it must
[1:27:45] come to pass God cannot forget it God
[1:27:49] cannot go back on his word God must
[1:27:52] fulfill it
[1:27:54] now Sarah certainly was prophesying to
[1:27:56] this age
[1:27:57] it was a time where the church had given
[1:28:00] up on the Promises of the coming of
[1:28:02] Jesus
[1:28:03] and it just had sunk down in unbelief
[1:28:07] satisfied that Ishmael the child of the
[1:28:11] denominational bombs woman is the error
[1:28:15] the delay has taken a toll
[1:28:18] on her faith
[1:28:20] instead of her getting stronger
[1:28:23] she has gotten weaker
[1:28:26] and and so it is with many today
[1:28:30] but I I just want to want you to
[1:28:33] understand and don't don't become
[1:28:36] discouraged in this hour
[1:28:38] don't just settle back and think it's
[1:28:41] all just going to remain the same the
[1:28:44] way it's always been
[1:28:46] because regardless of how much you
[1:28:48] perceive it as God's no longer working
[1:28:51] or God's no more no longer moving or it
[1:28:54] seems to be a delay that that even in
[1:28:57] our day there has been a rapid I just
[1:29:01] wanna you know pound it in a rapid
[1:29:04] fulfillment of scriptures
[1:29:06] I want you to know that even in our day
[1:29:09] time after time things suddenly changed
[1:29:14] amen and I want you to realize that
[1:29:17] you're in a moment of Sudden Change
[1:29:22] things are happening
[1:29:24] things are right at the point where the
[1:29:27] triggers have not pulled
[1:29:28] the sights are aimed you know it's all
[1:29:32] inside us the scriptures are all lined
[1:29:34] up but in one moment the trigger can be
[1:29:37] pulled
[1:29:38] after a delay of 2000 years
[1:29:42] this generation has seen scriptures come
[1:29:45] alive
[1:29:46] amen there's been actually a rapid
[1:29:48] fulfillment of Prophecy and and today we
[1:29:52] can actually say about much of the
[1:29:54] scripture and declare without hesitation
[1:29:57] this day
[1:29:58] this scripture has been fulfilled
[1:30:03] and the endless every Divine promise it
[1:30:06] that spoke of a bride is is now in the
[1:30:10] process of being fulfilled
[1:30:15] there are things that are that are in
[1:30:17] action that are moving no matter whether
[1:30:20] it's in our economy whether it's in our
[1:30:22] the White House whether it's in World
[1:30:24] politics whether it's in the church
[1:30:26] whether it's in the sodomites and
[1:30:28] whatever no matter what it is listen if
[1:30:30] you can see movement out there
[1:30:34] you've got to know that God's doing
[1:30:37] something
[1:30:38] in his bride
[1:30:40] if you can see things happening and
[1:30:43] lining up there
[1:30:45] how much more are we being searching the
[1:30:47] scripture today to see what's lining up
[1:30:50] for the hour that we're living in
[1:30:54] now God has done many mighty things in
[1:30:57] this age already
[1:30:59] but don't keep it all in the past
[1:31:01] amen because because we're still in the
[1:31:06] hour of his coming
[1:31:08] scripture is being fulfilled as I speak
[1:31:12] you see
[1:31:14] this parallels to his first coming
[1:31:17] as Jesus of Galilee were the scripture
[1:31:19] suddenly became fulfilled rapid events
[1:31:23] after delays were actually from Malachi
[1:31:27] to
[1:31:28] um to to the opening of the first
[1:31:30] testament Matthew
[1:31:32] that that there was
[1:31:35] hundreds of years
[1:31:38] where that it was just seem like silence
[1:31:42] seemed like nothing was happening
[1:31:44] seemed like God had forgot or God it is
[1:31:48] given up
[1:31:49] or he had went in the heavens and was
[1:31:53] busy about something else but he was no
[1:31:55] longer interested in the Affairs of man
[1:31:58] but I want you to understand God had not
[1:32:01] forgotten
[1:32:03] he had he had to wait until certain
[1:32:06] things were lined up in his plan
[1:32:09] because God has a plan
[1:32:12] there had to be certain things here in
[1:32:15] the Book of Daniel would tell of the
[1:32:17] rise and Falls of Kingdoms
[1:32:20] and it would show you that Rome would
[1:32:22] come into being it would come into place
[1:32:24] and and hear it you know it would come
[1:32:27] with its with its iron ways and begin to
[1:32:31] bring persecution upon the Israelites
[1:32:34] and the Jewish people that would rise up
[1:32:37] with resistance like The Maccabees and
[1:32:40] whatever but they couldn't throw it off
[1:32:42] because it was prophesied
[1:32:45] I want you to understand the same thing
[1:32:48] today you can do all the prepping you
[1:32:50] want to you can organize all the rallies
[1:32:53] you want to you can get people to go and
[1:32:57] March in Washington D.C it'll never
[1:32:59] change anything
[1:33:01] I want you to understand that prophecy
[1:33:04] is there for these things to be as they
[1:33:07] are
[1:33:08] and they are in their place I just want
[1:33:12] to make sure that you understand as the
[1:33:15] bride of Christ you too must be in your
[1:33:17] place
[1:33:18] [Applause]
[1:33:20] Sarah's out of sort Sarah's out of her
[1:33:23] place Sarah is unbelieving
[1:33:28] and she's got to get in place
[1:33:31] I want to remind you all the unbelief
[1:33:34] all the doubt all of even the scoffing
[1:33:38] the laughing in her heart never changed
[1:33:41] who she was
[1:33:44] and never change God's promise
[1:33:52] you see God didn't just give up on his
[1:33:55] pride does not give up on his promise
[1:33:57] God didn't give up on the air of the
[1:33:59] promise
[1:34:00] and God's not going to give up on you
[1:34:04] no matter how much you have stumbled
[1:34:06] how long you have fallen how deep you
[1:34:09] have gone how impossible your situation
[1:34:12] looks
[1:34:13] God doesn't give up
[1:34:17] in fact he declares looking at your
[1:34:19] situation there's nothing too hard
[1:34:26] but my brother my sister my friend my my
[1:34:29] children my this this oh it's it's
[1:34:33] impossible brother Tim it's not
[1:34:34] impossible
[1:34:36] it's not
[1:34:40] but God sometimes Waits until it looks
[1:34:43] impossible
[1:34:44] before he moves
[1:34:49] and he does this for a purpose
[1:34:52] he has a reason maybe I don't understand
[1:34:54] the reason
[1:34:55] but God's got a reason and a purpose
[1:34:58] and so you know you know even though
[1:35:02] from Malachi to John the Baptist
[1:35:05] there's hardly anything that God spent
[1:35:07] we don't even have a
[1:35:08] recorded scripture
[1:35:11] of anything that God said we don't have
[1:35:14] another prophecy we don't have another
[1:35:17] Prophet we don't have another word from
[1:35:19] God to write it 500 years and then
[1:35:22] suddenly
[1:35:24] I don't know how it kicks in
[1:35:27] but all of a sudden
[1:35:30] even when righteous people such as Sarah
[1:35:32] has given up
[1:35:34] even when Israel was in such despair
[1:35:37] that it looked impossible
[1:35:39] God Appears Angels start appearing
[1:35:42] things starts changing
[1:35:47] like I said I don't know the key I don't
[1:35:50] know how to make it happen
[1:35:52] I don't know if you can make it happen
[1:35:56] I think of the Pentecostals who have
[1:35:58] prayer who have prayed and passed it and
[1:36:00] everything you know for 117 years for
[1:36:03] there to be another Azusa Street and
[1:36:06] it's never happened
[1:36:10] and yet they would fast and pray and try
[1:36:13] to call it down and it didn't happen
[1:36:16] but it's going to happen anyway
[1:36:19] and I'm just going to say things as
[1:36:21] something this morning even sometimes
[1:36:23] when you don't believe
[1:36:26] God is hasn't given up
[1:36:29] and your unbelief ain't gonna hinder him
[1:36:32] and back to the matter he's going to
[1:36:34] start doing things to get you to believe
[1:36:37] it again
[1:36:40] and maybe in your heart today your faith
[1:36:43] has died maybe it's at the lowest moment
[1:36:46] maybe you can't hardly hold on anymore
[1:36:49] that's what God Specializes in things
[1:36:52] that are thought impossible and he
[1:36:54] certainly shows up
[1:36:56] to produce the faith in your heart when
[1:36:59] you have given up God doesn't give up
[1:37:04] in fact God remembers
[1:37:09] suddenly
[1:37:12] in the days
[1:37:14] of the New Testament as it opens
[1:37:16] nothing's happened for 500 years
[1:37:20] suddenly like I said I don't know how it
[1:37:23] kicks in
[1:37:25] I don't know that I don't know you know
[1:37:27] sometimes you think oh you know what
[1:37:30] could I do
[1:37:31] what could I do or how could I make this
[1:37:33] happen
[1:37:35] God's Got A Time God has a purpose God
[1:37:37] has a plan but it's going to happen
[1:37:40] suddenly an angel appears first to
[1:37:43] Zechariah
[1:37:45] he is a man that is chosen for by lot
[1:37:48] and you know as a priest and for the
[1:37:50] first time in his life
[1:37:52] he is now chosen to bring incense into
[1:37:55] the holy place and and this has been
[1:37:59] done now for thousands of years this way
[1:38:01] it was a ritual that was instituted by
[1:38:05] Moses and thousands of times before this
[1:38:08] the incense just like this day had been
[1:38:13] taken into the holy place
[1:38:15] and it seemed just like another usual
[1:38:18] day
[1:38:20] but today was somehow different
[1:38:23] that even though it was usual there was
[1:38:26] a supernatural element
[1:38:28] that was beginning to happen
[1:38:30] and today his answers was put up on the
[1:38:33] fire which represented the prayers of
[1:38:36] Israel today his prayers would be mixed
[1:38:40] with the incense and suddenly there
[1:38:43] would appear Gabriel where he says
[1:38:46] where he says to Zechariah your prayers
[1:38:50] have been heard
[1:38:52] I want you to say I want to submit this
[1:38:55] this was not the first time he had
[1:38:57] prayed
[1:39:00] he was now about 65 years old
[1:39:03] he had been praying he had been praying
[1:39:06] for a promised son
[1:39:08] he had been praying for Israel to be
[1:39:10] delivered
[1:39:11] he had many prayers that he had prayed
[1:39:14] this was not the first time he had
[1:39:16] prayed but today his prayers were
[1:39:20] answered
[1:39:22] today God was moving on the scene I
[1:39:26] showed you last Sunday in my closing of
[1:39:29] the seventh seal that holds a bowl of
[1:39:32] prayers that are held up
[1:39:34] maybe you have prayed for things and you
[1:39:37] have prayed for things and you have
[1:39:39] prayed for things and maybe it hasn't
[1:39:42] come to pass yet
[1:39:44] but there there Comes a Day
[1:39:48] there comes a day when there comes not
[1:39:51] just a prayer but a supernatural element
[1:39:54] begins to move in
[1:39:56] and God says your prayers have been
[1:40:00] heard
[1:40:03] today I want you to know your prayers
[1:40:06] have been hurt they you know no doubt
[1:40:09] they've been heard for a long time and
[1:40:11] but they've been held up they're not
[1:40:13] been answered
[1:40:15] but not only that but the old woman
[1:40:18] Israel
[1:40:19] who is she too was the barren woman
[1:40:22] waiting now for thousands of years
[1:40:26] the word that came was thy that there
[1:40:30] will come a seed through the woman that
[1:40:33] will bruise the head of the serpent
[1:40:35] and it looked impossible
[1:40:38] and they were all under in bondage now
[1:40:40] by the Romans who were brutal
[1:40:43] there was all kinds of suffering that
[1:40:45] was going on
[1:40:47] it was an evil day or as taxations by
[1:40:51] Herod that would require every man to go
[1:40:53] to his hometown to be taxed and babies
[1:40:56] were killed by ruthless tyrants
[1:41:01] they were held captive and you know
[1:41:03] brutally cruel men
[1:41:06] doing things to them ravishing their
[1:41:09] women destroying their economy doing
[1:41:12] everything enslaving them and keeping
[1:41:14] them in bondage
[1:41:16] but on this day it's the same
[1:41:19] yet it's very different
[1:41:22] on this day it's zachariah's turn
[1:41:26] to offer the incense this is what the
[1:41:29] thing that as a son of Aaron of the
[1:41:32] tribe from and a descendant rather of of
[1:41:35] Aaron that he would because there was
[1:41:37] the Levites you know and so they also
[1:41:40] were were had different uh various
[1:41:42] things in the temple but only the sons
[1:41:44] of Aaron
[1:41:46] could operate within the inner framework
[1:41:49] of the Temple
[1:41:50] and today was his turn to offer the
[1:41:55] incense this had never happened
[1:41:57] this happened only one time in his life
[1:42:00] and he would be chosen by lot to offer
[1:42:04] the incense in other words if I could
[1:42:07] say it I don't know how they did it but
[1:42:08] it's like drawing your name out of the
[1:42:10] heart and every time that the Hat was
[1:42:13] passed his name got overlooked
[1:42:17] every time that it looked like that he
[1:42:20] would be the one today to offer the
[1:42:22] incense
[1:42:24] that that he could have a chance at it
[1:42:26] it went day after day after day after
[1:42:30] day and now he's 65 years old it looks
[1:42:34] like he will get old enough
[1:42:36] because you know when I say old enough
[1:42:39] I'm talking about decrepit enough that
[1:42:41] he could no longer perform in the temple
[1:42:44] it looks like
[1:42:46] he'll never have the opportunity
[1:42:51] and and yet today he's chosen by lot
[1:42:56] to do the most solemn sad part of the
[1:43:00] the day ceremony
[1:43:02] and that that was to offer the incense
[1:43:05] and it would symbolize Israel's prayers
[1:43:08] were being accepted by God
[1:43:11] he would choose two of his relatives
[1:43:13] which are his friends no doubt because
[1:43:17] they too had to be of the sons of Aaron
[1:43:20] to go in with him to prepare at the
[1:43:23] offer of incense
[1:43:25] if you can see it for a moment the first
[1:43:28] helper that he had would remove what had
[1:43:31] been left on the altar of emphasis from
[1:43:33] the previous evening service
[1:43:36] and then in prayer he would walk
[1:43:37] backwards away from that from The Altar
[1:43:40] and then the second helper now came
[1:43:42] forward and he would spread live coals
[1:43:45] that were taken from that morning's
[1:43:47] burnt offered and then he would to
[1:43:49] worship and back away
[1:43:52] and that's the people and the priest
[1:43:54] waited outside
[1:43:56] Zechariah now stood alone in the Holy
[1:43:59] place
[1:44:00] it was lighted it was lit only by the
[1:44:04] seven golden candlesticks I hope you get
[1:44:06] the picture
[1:44:08] and here is all of the the candle lid
[1:44:11] that had been lit and you know the other
[1:44:13] priests had done their duties of
[1:44:15] refilling the vessels with oil and
[1:44:18] trimming the Wicks on the LA on the
[1:44:21] seven golden candlesticks and it was
[1:44:24] shining brightly
[1:44:25] and that as he would as he would move
[1:44:30] toward that heavy that heavy Veil that
[1:44:33] that hum between the holiest of holies
[1:44:37] there would be the ultra of incense on
[1:44:40] which Now red coals were glowing
[1:44:43] it was as near to the holiest of holies
[1:44:47] as it could get to his right would be
[1:44:49] the table of showbread to his left the
[1:44:52] seven golden candlesticks
[1:44:54] and there he would wait until a special
[1:44:57] signal indicated the moment had come
[1:45:03] and then he would walk forward and he
[1:45:05] would spread his incense him on the
[1:45:07] altar and the priests and the people
[1:45:10] had reverently moved back from the altar
[1:45:13] in the courtyard and now they were
[1:45:15] prostrate before the Lord because they
[1:45:18] were offering prayers and Thanksgiving
[1:45:20] for God's mercies provision Deliverance
[1:45:22] along with blessings and asking God for
[1:45:25] deliverance
[1:45:27] asking God to send that Messiah
[1:45:30] I'm a cloud of smoke from the incense
[1:45:33] was beginning to form and begin to move
[1:45:36] upward in the Holy place
[1:45:38] Zachariah would wait until he was sure
[1:45:41] that the incense was burning well and
[1:45:43] then he would bow down in prayer himself
[1:45:45] and reverently leave the holy place
[1:45:48] except
[1:45:49] today was different
[1:45:52] there was a Wonder sight that it met his
[1:45:55] ice
[1:45:56] an angel stood there
[1:45:58] and he said fear not Zechariah your
[1:46:02] prayers have been heard
[1:46:05] and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son
[1:46:10] you see week two are at an end time
[1:46:13] and Angels appear in the end time all
[1:46:17] the prophets and the signposts are
[1:46:19] saying that this day that angels will
[1:46:21] appear the prophets will arise signs and
[1:46:24] wonders and if God did that for those
[1:46:26] little Junctions right there what will
[1:46:29] he do when all hell is turned loose
[1:46:31] you can expect God to be moving
[1:46:34] amen Angels appearing in signs and
[1:46:38] wonders on the earth and counterfeits
[1:46:40] arising and God have proven who's right
[1:46:44] and who's wrong
[1:46:46] prayers that have been prayed
[1:46:48] and God says to him your prayers have
[1:46:51] been answered your prayers have been
[1:46:52] heard
[1:46:53] we're right now in the cycle where
[1:46:56] there's something fits in the great
[1:46:58] fixing the house
[1:46:59] well Zachariah says the angel how can I
[1:47:02] be certain of this
[1:47:04] I'm an old man my wife is is advancing
[1:47:08] age and he says well I am Gabriel
[1:47:11] and I stand in the presence of God I've
[1:47:14] been sent to to tell you this good news
[1:47:17] but because you have disbelief
[1:47:21] because you have questioned
[1:47:24] because you have expressed doubt and
[1:47:27] wondered how can I be sure of this
[1:47:31] when you have stood in the presence of
[1:47:33] the angel of God
[1:47:35] when the voice of God is spoken to you
[1:47:38] and said I your prayers have been heard
[1:47:41] and you are now questioning and
[1:47:43] wondering and asking out loud and
[1:47:45] verbalizing how can I be sure this in
[1:47:49] other words how do I know you're not
[1:47:50] lying
[1:47:57] because you did not believe my words
[1:48:00] you will be silent
[1:48:03] and not able to speak until the day this
[1:48:05] happens
[1:48:07] in other words if you're going to
[1:48:09] question this I'm going to shut your
[1:48:10] mouth
[1:48:12] amen I'm not going to tolerate another
[1:48:15] word of doubt
[1:48:17] another word of unbelief and if you want
[1:48:20] God to shut up your mouth
[1:48:23] you just start questioning what God's
[1:48:25] doing in this end time
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:28] amen because God is not going to
[1:48:30] tolerate unbelief
[1:48:32] coming out of the mouth of his people
[1:48:35] he will cause you to be silent but it's
[1:48:38] still going to come to pass
[1:48:39] I want you to know what a contrast it
[1:48:42] was when the with Mary you know who when
[1:48:44] the birth of Jesus said now she didn't
[1:48:46] know she doesn't question the angel and
[1:48:49] how can I be sure of this you know how
[1:48:51] do I know this is true and it offers
[1:48:54] reasons why it can't happen but you know
[1:48:57] my wife and I are old and yet he's got
[1:49:00] examples of Sarah past 90 of Hannah the
[1:49:04] mother of Samuel other Rebecca who who
[1:49:07] uh Isaac interceded for and she brought
[1:49:10] for twins and all these things she got
[1:49:12] all kinds of examples in the scripture
[1:49:14] and and Mary did not have one example
[1:49:18] of ever being a woman who would conceive
[1:49:22] without knowing a man
[1:49:24] and and she she didn't ask how can this
[1:49:27] be true but she but she said how will
[1:49:31] this happen how will this happen no God
[1:49:34] doesn't care
[1:49:35] to answer that question he won't shut
[1:49:39] you up for asking how will this happen
[1:49:41] the angel said I'll tell you how it's
[1:49:43] going to happen the holy spirit will
[1:49:45] overshadow you
[1:49:49] you wonder how it's going to happen
[1:49:54] it happened to you the same way
[1:49:57] the holy spirit will overshadow you I'm
[1:50:01] telling you Church get ready for the
[1:50:04] other Saturday of the Holy Ghost to come
[1:50:07] after you Shadow to walk in his life
[1:50:13] because it's not going to come by your
[1:50:15] ability
[1:50:18] and maybe even your faith won't produce
[1:50:21] it but I tell you it'll come by the Holy
[1:50:24] Ghost
[1:50:25] because God remembers his promise and
[1:50:29] it's going to come to pass and it
[1:50:31] doesn't matter how much unbelief is in
[1:50:33] this age God's going to do it anyhow
[1:50:40] how amazing
[1:50:44] what difference
[1:50:46] what did Mary do
[1:50:48] she immediately responded here's the
[1:50:50] handmaiden of the Lord hear my God
[1:50:52] if you're going to overshadow me here
[1:50:54] that's me
[1:50:57] that ought to be the prayer of every
[1:50:58] person today when you hear that the Lord
[1:51:01] is going to overshadow his people in
[1:51:04] this last day that you ought to say be
[1:51:06] it unto me according to Thy word Here I
[1:51:09] Am Lord
[1:51:10] let this happen to me it's written it's
[1:51:13] it's written in the word behold the
[1:51:15] Virgin shall conceive let that word be
[1:51:17] manifest in my life
[1:51:19] how amazing it is but so true to life
[1:51:23] that upright moral church-going people
[1:51:26] even Minister yep even bride people can
[1:51:29] be so filled with unbelief
[1:51:31] so immersed in a secular scientific
[1:51:35] world view
[1:51:38] that they are unable to bring themselves
[1:51:40] to believe that God can work miracles
[1:51:43] today
[1:51:45] some can even con construct elaborate
[1:51:49] theologies
[1:51:52] to explain why God can't
[1:51:55] why God won't
[1:51:57] or why God shouldn't perform a miracle
[1:52:00] today
[1:52:02] they'll even prepare sermons
[1:52:05] oh that which is perfect has come we
[1:52:07] don't need that
[1:52:09] you may not need a miracle but I do
[1:52:13] come on brother Brandon preach the
[1:52:15] sermon called the paradox paradox is a
[1:52:18] miracle
[1:52:19] amen it'll be a paradox a miracle to get
[1:52:22] a bride and a Rapture but he's going to
[1:52:24] do it
[1:52:25] it's going to be a miracle to change
[1:52:27] your body but God's going to do it it's
[1:52:29] going to be a miracle to get the bride
[1:52:31] of Christ all of us collectively
[1:52:33] believing
[1:52:34] sometimes you can get this from
[1:52:36] believing in that one believing but
[1:52:37] collectively to get us all believing
[1:52:39] it's going to take a miracle
[1:52:44] of the holy spirit amen when people
[1:52:47] begin to take an attitude toward the
[1:52:50] promise be it unto me according to Thy
[1:52:52] Word
[1:52:57] you see God went away went around
[1:53:00] zechariah's unbelief and said I'm going
[1:53:02] to do it anyway
[1:53:05] it's been a delay and you think it's
[1:53:06] impossible
[1:53:07] and you've expressed saying how do I
[1:53:10] know this is true how do I know you're
[1:53:11] not lying I wonder sometimes how our
[1:53:14] unbelief flies in the face of God
[1:53:21] we're living in a Time
[1:53:24] where the fervent fires of Faith have
[1:53:26] cooled off
[1:53:29] even the fires of Azusa Street have died
[1:53:31] down
[1:53:33] this Supernatural gospel that brother
[1:53:35] branovic stole of a pillar of fire of an
[1:53:38] angel of a Divine gift of a restoration
[1:53:40] now becomes a forgotten dream
[1:53:46] God says shut up Zechariah
[1:53:49] I don't want to hear your unbelief
[1:53:52] people
[1:53:56] I wanted people like Mary
[1:54:00] who says I I don't know how I can do
[1:54:03] this I don't know a man
[1:54:06] well it's not going to be you doing it
[1:54:07] it's going to be me doing it
[1:54:09] it won't be my man's might or my man's
[1:54:13] power but it'd be my spirit the Holy
[1:54:15] Ghost is going to overshadow you that's
[1:54:17] the way it's going to happen
[1:54:20] Hallelujah
[1:54:25] the angel appears to Mary
[1:54:28] 's visitation went a lot different from
[1:54:32] the old priest
[1:54:33] because she ready he accepted the word
[1:54:35] of the angel
[1:54:37] but that wasn't all
[1:54:39] the coming of the Angel to Zachariah
[1:54:42] and and then to marry it set off a chain
[1:54:47] of events
[1:54:49] I want to say the time of Silence was
[1:54:53] now over
[1:54:57] the time of holding back the promise was
[1:55:01] now over
[1:55:04] for now he appears to Joseph in a dream
[1:55:08] and then the shepherds in the field
[1:55:10] to wise men
[1:55:14] and then amazingly seemingly nothing
[1:55:16] happens
[1:55:19] for 30 long years
[1:55:24] I mean think of it the angel comes the
[1:55:28] messenger speaks the baby John is born
[1:55:31] the baby Jesus is born
[1:55:34] Shepherds have come they've given
[1:55:37] witness and nothing happens
[1:55:39] for 30 long years
[1:55:42] you seek in the time of fulfillment
[1:55:44] there can be times where it seemed like
[1:55:47] nothing is happening
[1:55:49] but things are getting into place
[1:55:55] and I want to just say to you in your
[1:55:57] times of Silence just realize God is
[1:56:00] working getting the right things in
[1:56:03] place
[1:56:09] the only Glimpse that we even have of
[1:56:11] God even moving
[1:56:12] was a glimpse in the life of Jesus at
[1:56:15] the age of 12 in the temple
[1:56:18] where he says I must be about my
[1:56:20] father's business
[1:56:22] and then he goes back becomes subject to
[1:56:25] his mom
[1:56:30] and then suddenly
[1:56:34] I said then suddenly
[1:56:36] there comes John out of the wilderness
[1:56:39] he comes out and preaches his first
[1:56:41] sermon
[1:56:43] and then things begin to happen
[1:56:45] as he begins to preach and people begin
[1:56:48] to gather and Faith begins to rise and
[1:56:51] hope comes in the hearts of people and
[1:56:53] and then enough the space of three and a
[1:56:56] half years more or less there's actually
[1:56:58] hundreds
[1:57:00] of scriptures that are suddenly and
[1:57:03] rapidly fulfilled
[1:57:06] you see there there can be in the very
[1:57:08] time of fulfillment moments where it
[1:57:11] looks like God went back Asylum again
[1:57:13] but he isn't
[1:57:18] even when you don't think it he's
[1:57:21] working
[1:57:23] he's getting things in place
[1:57:25] you know John couldn't go out and preach
[1:57:28] as a baby he had to wait until he was
[1:57:30] grown hey Jesus could not wait he could
[1:57:33] not do it until the age of 30 and then
[1:57:35] he would go into the minute there was
[1:57:37] these 30 years
[1:57:39] of Silence
[1:57:41] we look like God wasn't moving God
[1:57:43] wasn't do anything God had did all this
[1:57:46] miraculous stuff but nothing come of it
[1:57:50] and all of a sudden there's a voice
[1:57:54] of one that's crying in the wilderness
[1:57:57] and then hundreds of scripture start
[1:57:59] being fulfilled
[1:58:01] I'm trying to Empire impart upon you
[1:58:04] today when God starts doing something
[1:58:06] maybe nothing looks like there's
[1:58:08] nothing's happening listen you know with
[1:58:12] Sarah and Abraham if Sarah and them
[1:58:13] hadn't went down there to um to career
[1:58:16] and and went there in the abimelech the
[1:58:19] king see her if we didn't have that
[1:58:20] story in the Bible we would never know
[1:58:23] that Sarah had been changed to a young
[1:58:25] woman
[1:58:29] but things were happening even though
[1:58:32] the baby wasn't here yet
[1:58:37] come on Church
[1:58:38] I meant things were already taking place
[1:58:41] there were changes that were happened
[1:58:43] some of them were subtle changes maybe
[1:58:45] that didn't happen in a day
[1:58:49] you want your miracle to happen right
[1:58:51] now
[1:58:52] a microwave miracle
[1:58:56] you want everything right now
[1:59:01] and God makes you wait for it
[1:59:07] and John steps into this role
[1:59:10] of one kind in the wilderness
[1:59:13] and Isaiah 40 begins to be fulfilled
[1:59:15] scripture
[1:59:17] begins to be fulfilled as he prepares
[1:59:19] the way of the Messiah and suddenly
[1:59:20] light begins to shine on scripture that
[1:59:23] was once dormant that it laid in the
[1:59:26] Bible for hundreds of years
[1:59:28] and and now a scripture an ancient
[1:59:31] scripture 500 years before that do you
[1:59:34] realize how long ago that was that's for
[1:59:36] America become a nation twice as long
[1:59:41] and and now a scripture that has been
[1:59:44] given and it lays dormant all of these
[1:59:47] years
[1:59:48] and it says that Malachi of Malachi 3
[1:59:51] but oh that's in my messenger before my
[1:59:53] face
[1:59:54] and he laid there unlaid there and laid
[1:59:56] there and laid there and generations
[1:59:58] hoped and generation believed in
[2:00:01] generations and it'll be our take and it
[2:00:03] didn't happen in others it's a hard day
[2:00:06] it's gonna this man surely he's the one
[2:00:08] and another and now light comes on it
[2:00:12] and it's quick
[2:00:14] suddenly suddenly the Lord you're
[2:00:17] seeking come to his Temple the messenger
[2:00:19] of the Covenant whom you desire will
[2:00:22] come says the Lord Almighty
[2:00:25] and then the end time from that point on
[2:00:29] kicked in the full gear
[2:00:31] come on
[2:00:33] yeah it was the end time
[2:00:36] I wanted to say to you you're a million
[2:00:39] time but there's been many end times
[2:00:43] it was the beginning of the end of the
[2:00:47] Old Testament it was the beginning of
[2:00:49] the New Testament
[2:00:50] there was an usern out going on and the
[2:00:53] Nostrand end
[2:00:56] you know scripture that had been silent
[2:00:58] and was in obscurity for years suddenly
[2:01:01] become the life
[2:01:03] and I say again that in this day we have
[2:01:06] seen scripture come alive at rapid
[2:01:10] fulfillment of Prophecy in our day and
[2:01:13] we can say about much of this word that
[2:01:16] you have been privileged and blessed are
[2:01:18] your eyes for they saw them they have
[2:01:21] seen us come to pass that much of this
[2:01:24] scripture has now been fulfilled
[2:01:27] are in the process of being fulfilled
[2:01:31] it is in this generation that God has
[2:01:33] done and is doing Mighty things as he
[2:01:35] winds up all events
[2:01:38] events that have to do with his coming
[2:01:40] things that has to be in order
[2:01:42] this would make men scream out uh 70
[2:01:46] years ago saying you know the Bible days
[2:01:49] are here again it's our restoration
[2:01:53] they would declare there's a man sent
[2:01:55] from God
[2:01:57] this was taken from the scripture uh
[2:01:59] spoke of John the Baptist in John 1 and
[2:02:02] 6 there was a man's who sent from God
[2:02:04] whose name was John and now in the last
[2:02:07] Church age in the Gentile dispensation
[2:02:10] as it finishes out once again they
[2:02:13] declare a man has been sent from God
[2:02:16] whose name is William Branham
[2:02:19] he comes like John the Baptist
[2:02:22] to forerun the second coming of Christ
[2:02:25] and the pillar of fire was there present
[2:02:28] in his birth which made it prompted
[2:02:31] unreligious parents to take him to
[2:02:34] church as a baby and this boy would then
[2:02:36] have a voice called from a whirlwind
[2:02:38] says don't drink or smoke or defile your
[2:02:41] body in any way for I have a work for
[2:02:43] you to do
[2:02:45] that nearly 90 years ago now a voice
[2:02:48] cries out on the Ohio River as John the
[2:02:51] Baptist would sitable run the first
[2:02:54] coming of Christ your message will
[2:02:56] forerun his second coming
[2:02:58] as it was said of John he will be great
[2:03:00] in the sight of the Lord he will never
[2:03:02] take wine or strong drink he will be
[2:03:04] filled with the Holy Spirit from his
[2:03:06] mother's womb many of the sons of Israel
[2:03:09] he will turn back to the Lord their God
[2:03:11] and he will go on before the Lord and
[2:03:13] the spirit and the power of Elijah to
[2:03:15] turn the hearts of the fathers to their
[2:03:17] children and the Disobedience to the
[2:03:19] wisdom of the righteous to make ready
[2:03:23] a people
[2:03:24] prepared for the Lord
[2:03:28] I want you to know God didn't remember
[2:03:30] didn't forget you he remembered you he
[2:03:34] sent Elijah
[2:03:36] to make ready a people prepared for the
[2:03:40] Lord
[2:03:41] God sends you a message of preparation
[2:03:44] behold I send you a light to the prophet
[2:03:47] before the coming of the Great and the
[2:03:50] Dreadful day of the Lord and as John
[2:03:52] turned to Harps of the Orthodox Jewish
[2:03:54] fathers to the children men such as
[2:03:56] Peter James and John that this Elijah
[2:03:59] would turn the hearts of their children
[2:04:00] to the Pentecostal fathers otherwise
[2:04:05] others will have to let the curse come
[2:04:08] I just have to let it all be destroyed
[2:04:11] because it's going to happen
[2:04:14] and if we breathe we're now in the
[2:04:16] phases
[2:04:17] of the coming of the Lord
[2:04:19] for the Lord does three things as he
[2:04:22] descends he does a shout a voice and a
[2:04:26] trumpet
[2:04:27] we've arrived at a time
[2:04:30] where the Lord has descended with the
[2:04:32] mighty Shout
[2:04:34] a mighty message
[2:04:36] it's the presence of Christ in word form
[2:04:40] and that's been sounded and it continues
[2:04:42] to sound echo in this day to every
[2:04:45] corner of the world
[2:04:46] and now Elijah has come and gone
[2:04:50] and although men have tried to
[2:04:51] denominate this message or make it a
[2:04:55] personality cult this message does not
[2:04:57] stop progressing
[2:04:59] it is not stop reaching out into the
[2:05:02] dark corners of the Earth
[2:05:04] amen as we speak it still reaches a
[2:05:07] predestinated seed of God to bring that
[2:05:10] elect that was foreknown of God before
[2:05:12] the foundation of the world let me tell
[2:05:14] you it is a quick short work that is
[2:05:17] being done as loud as she is the age of
[2:05:20] the quick work down in Russia over in
[2:05:24] Ukraine over in China down in cave
[2:05:27] churches amen over in Japan over in
[2:05:31] Africa down in Egypt over in Asia you
[2:05:34] know everywhere the gospel is going out
[2:05:38] I want you to understand it's the gospel
[2:05:40] that Paul preached
[2:05:43] I want you to understand it's the Gospel
[2:05:45] of Jesus Christ I want you to understand
[2:05:48] it's the pure and unadulterated word of
[2:05:52] God I'm tempered by denominations
[2:05:56] am I not hybrid with men's word the word
[2:05:59] is going forward to get a bride in this
[2:06:03] age
[2:06:04] do you realize where we're at
[2:06:06] do you realize that we are in right now
[2:06:10] approaching 2023
[2:06:12] so what what does that have to do with
[2:06:14] it do you realize Ephesian age began in
[2:06:18] in in
[2:06:19] 1853 it ends in 170 that's 117 years do
[2:06:24] you realize 2023 at this age for Max
[2:06:27] Ephesus
[2:06:31] do you realize that this age will be as
[2:06:34] old as the Ephesian Church
[2:06:39] that's the first the Alpha and Omega
[2:06:41] churches
[2:06:42] will now be the same length of time
[2:06:48] and all you can say as you look around
[2:06:51] the different ones that put to hear in
[2:06:53] this building today and those around the
[2:06:55] world it's been the long suffering of
[2:06:57] God
[2:07:01] it's because God had a plan for you and
[2:07:04] you and you and you and you and you and
[2:07:06] you and you and you and you and you and
[2:07:07] you and you and you and you and you
[2:07:10] who wasn't even born then
[2:07:14] forgot to wait until this time
[2:07:18] to finish his work
[2:07:20] to bring you to a place so that where
[2:07:24] you could be have a part in the
[2:07:26] predestined plan and God has waited on
[2:07:29] you all of these years to get here and
[2:07:32] things to reach in their position
[2:07:35] so he could finish his work
[2:07:40] Revelation chapter 4 brother Bradham
[2:07:43] says this he said
[2:07:45] you see we got these six days the world
[2:07:48] is labored in we're up close to this
[2:07:50] seventh day now
[2:07:51] and I I want to get the point
[2:07:54] because here again is another type
[2:07:58] God created the world in six days
[2:08:01] on the seventh day he rested
[2:08:04] we have had now had six days six
[2:08:07] thousand years
[2:08:08] upon the Earth of man and the and sin
[2:08:11] raging reigning upon the Earth and Satan
[2:08:14] comes to his climax in this last day
[2:08:20] but then the seventh day will die
[2:08:23] that seventh day is a day of rest
[2:08:26] God says the world is going to rest
[2:08:29] listen we're we're entering into the
[2:08:31] rest why do you think you received the
[2:08:33] Holy Ghost it's the rest
[2:08:36] it is also the sign that you're about
[2:08:38] that God's about taking his people into
[2:08:41] arrest
[2:08:42] you're going to rest from your labors
[2:08:45] you're going to rest from the hardships
[2:08:47] you're going to rest from being sick and
[2:08:51] weary and tired in old age there's a
[2:08:53] rest coming upon the Earth
[2:08:55] and you're right here on the cusp of it
[2:09:00] because the day of sin is about over and
[2:09:03] he said now it won't run all the way out
[2:09:05] he said I'll have to cut the word short
[2:09:07] if I don't the atomic bomb Will Will
[2:09:10] Destroy All Flesh and here we are
[2:09:16] in the in the in the church age he says
[2:09:19] the seventh age a very short one gathers
[2:09:23] up into itself for one quick work all
[2:09:25] the evil have ever aged stop it for a
[2:09:27] minute all the evil of every age keeps
[2:09:31] up into this one
[2:09:34] you see like a domino effect it has been
[2:09:37] building
[2:09:39] it is man it is man increasing
[2:09:42] increasing things are happening today
[2:09:44] that would have never been thought of to
[2:09:47] been done
[2:09:49] and now here here again the evil of
[2:09:52] every age where it comes to its height
[2:09:55] and yet he said if the short work grind
[2:09:58] this the seventh age a very short age
[2:10:01] gathers up itself into one quick work
[2:10:03] all the evil of every age and yet
[2:10:06] of the reality of Pentecost
[2:10:09] what's the Philadelphia needs just run
[2:10:12] its course the laodicea and age quickly
[2:10:15] comes in bringing both the tares and the
[2:10:18] wheat to harvest first bind the tares to
[2:10:20] burn them but gather my wheat into my
[2:10:23] barn
[2:10:24] so there's a gathering going on
[2:10:27] so we have been a we have arrived now at
[2:10:30] the hour
[2:10:31] where we are presently witnessing the
[2:10:34] fulfilling of first Thessalonians 4.
[2:10:36] God's doing it exactly as he promised
[2:10:39] Paul believed this was for his age he
[2:10:43] would declare we with your life and
[2:10:45] remain
[2:10:46] God didn't let him see seven churches
[2:10:50] even when he sows it to John he shows
[2:10:53] him seven angels and seven Seven Cities
[2:10:56] but he he don't tell him you know he's
[2:10:58] going to be seven Gentile ages
[2:11:02] he didn't he didn't line the whole thing
[2:11:04] out he didn't want him to be discouraged
[2:11:07] he wants every age going down believing
[2:11:11] amen some of you know Paul would believe
[2:11:13] it for his age but but again but again
[2:11:16] you know it would be for 2 000 years
[2:11:20] of a gentile dispensation of seven
[2:11:23] churches but at the end of time
[2:11:26] he promised to bring a bride
[2:11:29] the people who was out without spot or
[2:11:33] wrinkle or blemish or any such thing
[2:11:36] a virtuous sinless bride of Christ
[2:11:39] that he would bring forth of people like
[2:11:42] that yeah the Saints of other Ages were
[2:11:44] bribe but but I'm talking about a people
[2:11:46] who are alive and remain
[2:11:48] at the Covenant of the Lord
[2:11:51] a people of that bright age the elect
[2:11:54] lady who's the Fulfillment and the
[2:11:56] embodiment of the Divine Promises of God
[2:12:00] and by the way
[2:12:03] that vessel that God used
[2:12:04] single-handedly
[2:12:07] as the messenger this age now I'm
[2:12:09] talking about brother Branham
[2:12:11] he lived on the earth 56 years
[2:12:15] here in just a few days
[2:12:17] he will have been gone 57 years
[2:12:23] he will be gone longer than he was here
[2:12:29] but I want to say to you
[2:12:32] the spirit of the of Elijah is still
[2:12:35] here
[2:12:40] so how could brother brother Brandon be
[2:12:43] gone and he was Elijah he was he was not
[2:12:45] Elijah he was anointed with the spirit
[2:12:47] of Elijah
[2:12:48] and the spirit of Elijah is Christ
[2:12:53] amen and the spirit of Christ is here
[2:12:57] and let me just say to you Elisha is
[2:13:00] here in the devil portion
[2:13:04] is not here in a single portion is
[2:13:06] actually here in a double portion
[2:13:09] you see this is it it is God's crown and
[2:13:12] achievement that is coming in of you the
[2:13:15] marriage of the Lamb a spotless bride
[2:13:17] dressed in the righteousness of the word
[2:13:20] of the hour and after thousands of years
[2:13:23] of delay remember Paul was looking for
[2:13:25] the Fulfillment of his age he wasn't
[2:13:27] thinking of us he didn't even know we
[2:13:29] were to be here
[2:13:30] amen but he said that including himself
[2:13:33] we which are alive and remain he
[2:13:34] believed it was for him but it was
[2:13:36] hidden for him amen so that's whether
[2:13:39] for the purpose of election God had you
[2:13:42] in mind
[2:13:44] so therefore he delayed this fulfillment
[2:13:47] for seven churches because he had no
[2:13:50] more names on the book that had to be
[2:13:52] manifested on the Earth
[2:13:56] and God would write all this
[2:13:58] mysteriously and symbolically it is the
[2:14:01] Book of Revelation
[2:14:03] giving us messages to the Seven Cities
[2:14:07] of Asia that would represent seven
[2:14:09] churches and here we are today
[2:14:12] that's the last one
[2:14:14] and here we are today it's about run out
[2:14:18] here we are next year it'll be the same
[2:14:21] it won't be the shortest age it'll be
[2:14:23] the same age as Ephesians 8.
[2:14:28] we're here where scripture is now being
[2:14:30] fulfilled
[2:14:32] first Thessalonians be fulfilled I want
[2:14:34] you to understand
[2:14:36] don't look at the Bible the scripture of
[2:14:39] the past
[2:14:41] look at the Bible as scripture of the
[2:14:43] present
[2:14:47] this is not a funeral's text
[2:14:50] it's not just a word of comfort though
[2:14:52] it's been used out for years and they
[2:14:54] were instructed to uncomfort one another
[2:14:56] with these words
[2:14:58] but I want you to understand it's a
[2:15:00] prophecy
[2:15:02] and I also want you to understand you
[2:15:05] are the object of that prophecy
[2:15:08] amen where that where that we are now
[2:15:11] seeing in the hour the Fulfillment of
[2:15:14] the presence of Christ it's bringing
[2:15:15] about a bride and bringing the word from
[2:15:18] book form to Fresh form for the flesh
[2:15:20] form from prophecy to fulfillment
[2:15:24] now let's think about it
[2:15:29] let's think about how the church
[2:15:31] has drug along now for many years
[2:15:35] through the Dark Ages
[2:15:37] yet all the while God has been moving
[2:15:40] and no age has God forgot his church
[2:15:45] he's working all along
[2:15:48] in this Kingdom it would come and Stage
[2:15:51] us
[2:15:52] it would advance from its original
[2:15:55] planting to harvest I'd like you to turn
[2:15:57] with me to Mark chapter 4 and verse 26
[2:16:00] and let's just look at the scripture how
[2:16:02] Jesus said the kingdom of God would come
[2:16:07] and remember this is his kingdom
[2:16:10] so the gospel this is this is the news
[2:16:12] of his kingdom
[2:16:15] and so he said so is the kingdom of God
[2:16:17] as if a man should cast seed into the
[2:16:20] ground
[2:16:21] and should sleep and Rise day and night
[2:16:24] and the seeds will spring up and grow he
[2:16:26] knoweth not how
[2:16:28] for the Earth bringeth forth the fruit
[2:16:30] of yourself first the blade then the ear
[2:16:32] and after that the full corn in the ear
[2:16:37] but when the fruit is brought forth
[2:16:39] immediately he putteth in the sickle
[2:16:41] because the Harvest has come so Jesus
[2:16:44] said this kingdom is going to be like a
[2:16:47] man planting a seed
[2:16:50] and then you know when the seed is
[2:16:52] planted the seed will will actually
[2:16:54] Decay and out of that will come alive
[2:16:57] and then that life will come ablade and
[2:17:00] that blade will not look nothing like
[2:17:01] the seed
[2:17:04] so you'll look at that and say that
[2:17:06] ain't grain
[2:17:08] that don't look like the seed
[2:17:11] looks nothing like what I planted
[2:17:13] and that's the way the church would
[2:17:15] become it would actually become through
[2:17:17] the Dark Ages nothing like the original
[2:17:20] Pentecost
[2:17:22] it would lose his true baptism it would
[2:17:25] lose the truth of godhead it would lose
[2:17:28] the truth of predestination it would
[2:17:30] lose the original sin and what took
[2:17:32] place in the garden it would lose all of
[2:17:35] the truths of the Bible
[2:17:37] and it would come up as a little puny
[2:17:39] little green blade Jesus said this is
[2:17:43] the way my kingdom will come it will
[2:17:45] progress from seed to seed from grain to
[2:17:50] grain and in between that would be a
[2:17:53] time that it looks nothing like the seed
[2:17:55] I planted
[2:17:56] but the life will be in it but it will
[2:17:59] not be the grain
[2:18:01] but it's going to come to the grain but
[2:18:04] before it comes to the grain there will
[2:18:06] come an ear and when it comes from the
[2:18:09] ear it will move from that to the full
[2:18:11] ear
[2:18:12] now I wanted to say to you we are in the
[2:18:15] day and the hour word that it changes
[2:18:18] from the grain or the the the cut the
[2:18:22] ear to the full colored in the ear
[2:18:28] now you notice Jesus speaks that way
[2:18:31] again I want to emphasize it the ear and
[2:18:34] then the full corn in the ear that's
[2:18:36] what's going to be in the end time
[2:18:38] that in other words before the full ear
[2:18:41] comes
[2:18:43] there's going to be a move of God that
[2:18:46] will actually look like the grain
[2:18:50] but it won't be the green
[2:18:53] it has to come into its fullness and
[2:18:57] when it reaches its fullness then the
[2:19:00] Rapture will take place the Harvest Time
[2:19:02] this is our age it is the Harvest age it
[2:19:06] is it is when that the church that when
[2:19:10] the ear first comes and the church
[2:19:12] begins this that dramatic change from
[2:19:15] looking nothing like an ear of grain to
[2:19:19] be coming to ear
[2:19:21] all of a sudden we start having things
[2:19:23] happen that looks like
[2:19:26] it's the real full year
[2:19:30] and it's the air it's the move of God
[2:19:33] don't denounce it
[2:19:36] but it ain't what I'm going to harvest
[2:19:40] I'm going to wait until the fullness
[2:19:43] you see I want to get something because
[2:19:46] it will come in power
[2:19:49] it will come with anointings it will
[2:19:52] come with miraculous and with healings
[2:19:54] it will come in the spirit but not have
[2:19:57] the word
[2:20:00] but I'm going to bring it to the full
[2:20:02] ear and I'm going to restore back the
[2:20:04] word but with that word it shall come to
[2:20:08] the full year it's going to have to be
[2:20:10] both word and spirit
[2:20:13] it cannot be one or the other it has to
[2:20:17] be both
[2:20:18] it cannot be word only
[2:20:21] it must come in power and great
[2:20:23] assurance
[2:20:25] it cannot be a word and no faith it
[2:20:30] cannot be the word and no manifestations
[2:20:33] of the spirit of God of healings and
[2:20:36] miracles of tongues of gifts of signs
[2:20:38] and wonders it cannot be that the word
[2:20:40] has to be accompanied with Spirit to be
[2:20:45] the full ear
[2:20:48] now brother Branham tells us in the
[2:20:50] resume of the ages he said now it came
[2:20:53] to this it came to the ear he said at
[2:20:57] this age started around the turn of the
[2:20:59] 20th century as it was to be the age in
[2:21:02] which the true church would return to be
[2:21:04] in the bride she was at Pentecost we
[2:21:06] know there must of necessity be a return
[2:21:09] of dynamic power
[2:21:11] and the Believers sensed this in their
[2:21:14] spirits and they begin to cry to God for
[2:21:17] new outpouring as such as was in the
[2:21:19] first century and what seemed to be the
[2:21:22] answer came as many began to speak in
[2:21:25] tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit
[2:21:27] and it believed that it was indeed the
[2:21:30] long-awaited restoration it was not
[2:21:34] it wasn't a full year
[2:21:36] it was a move of God and it was
[2:21:39] advancement
[2:21:41] but it wasn't all that God promised
[2:21:44] and he said the reason for this the
[2:21:47] lattering can only come after the farmer
[2:21:50] Ray
[2:21:51] which is the spring or the teaching rain
[2:21:54] the latter rain then is the hardest Lane
[2:21:56] now how could this be the real thing
[2:21:58] when the teaching Reign did not come the
[2:22:01] prophet messenger who was sent to teach
[2:22:04] the people and to Eternal hearts of the
[2:22:07] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[2:22:10] had not yet come so here we have 1906
[2:22:13] and we have the move of the spirit and
[2:22:16] they think it's a long-awaited
[2:22:17] restoration and yet God is restoring but
[2:22:20] it isn't for restoration
[2:22:23] and he said they're calling it the
[2:22:24] latter rain and he said how can it be
[2:22:26] the latter Ray was the former Reign the
[2:22:29] early rain has not happened
[2:22:31] because you see it would take a profit
[2:22:35] to come somebody with me Amen to teach
[2:22:38] the people to turn our hearts back to
[2:22:41] the original Faith again
[2:22:45] Hallelujah
[2:22:48] now that's what was thought to be the
[2:22:52] restoration
[2:22:54] and the final quickening the Rapture had
[2:22:56] not come
[2:22:58] it was a mixture of the unrighteous I
[2:23:01] want you to watch this
[2:23:03] it was a mixture of the unrighteous
[2:23:05] partaking of spiritual blessings and
[2:23:07] manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we kept
[2:23:10] pointing out to you it was also devil
[2:23:12] power as men were under control the
[2:23:14] devils and no one seemed to realize it
[2:23:17] and then to prove it was not real these
[2:23:19] people even before the second generation
[2:23:21] had appeared and organ they organized
[2:23:24] and wrote their unscriptural doctrines
[2:23:26] and built their own fences as every
[2:23:28] other group ahead of this of them did
[2:23:31] and brother Bradham called this fungus
[2:23:35] on the air
[2:23:39] and I just want to say
[2:23:40] when we look back and we point fingers
[2:23:43] at Azusa Street
[2:23:45] and we look at the mistakes that they
[2:23:47] made I just want to say we've not been
[2:23:50] squeaky clean either
[2:23:54] we've had our share of fungus
[2:23:58] there have been men preachers another
[2:24:00] message under the control of devil power
[2:24:04] who organized and made personality calls
[2:24:07] there have been adulterers in the pulpit
[2:24:11] polygamist who took the very words of
[2:24:14] the prophet of God to try and and and
[2:24:17] use it for their own lustful purpose
[2:24:20] there have been homosexuals and
[2:24:22] adulterers
[2:24:24] in the pulpit
[2:24:25] there have been personality Cults that
[2:24:27] have built their fences and organized so
[2:24:29] tightly around true such as Thunder or
[2:24:33] the perus of the presence or the return
[2:24:35] Ministry of the tape only cult all of
[2:24:38] these have risen up Focus
[2:24:42] on the ear
[2:24:46] the Pentecostal denominations was the
[2:24:49] fungus on the ear
[2:24:51] organizing over initial evidence among
[2:24:54] other things that was fungus
[2:24:57] that was not the ear
[2:24:59] I want to go back for a moment I want
[2:25:01] you to understand you've got to look at
[2:25:03] the difference you're looking at the
[2:25:06] seed and you're looking at the ear and
[2:25:08] you're seeing the fungus I want you to
[2:25:10] see the fungus was not the ear
[2:25:15] the Pentecostal organization was the
[2:25:18] fungus it was not the ear
[2:25:21] and when you're looking at back there
[2:25:23] you know sometimes all you see is the
[2:25:26] wrong I want you to see Godless moving
[2:25:29] and God was remembering
[2:25:33] and God Was preparing
[2:25:38] I want you to begin to see it as a move
[2:25:41] of God
[2:25:43] not just as a move of the devil yeah
[2:25:45] there was fungus on the air
[2:25:46] yeah they organized over initial
[2:25:49] evidence among other things
[2:25:52] but you know the leaders of the Zeus of
[2:25:54] movement they understood this too FF
[2:25:56] Bosworth do you know brother Bosworth he
[2:25:58] was an early Azusa Street revivalist and
[2:26:02] he debated at the Assembly of God
[2:26:04] conference at Thomas was not the
[2:26:06] evidence do you know the that man got
[2:26:08] thrown out of the organization because
[2:26:10] of it
[2:26:11] there were men of God that was right
[2:26:13] there through Pentecostals who was
[2:26:17] standing for the truth and calling it
[2:26:19] what it was
[2:26:21] you know that was William Seymour that
[2:26:25] said now don't go from this meeting he
[2:26:27] even William Seymour was uh was the man
[2:26:30] the pastor of Azusa Mission there and he
[2:26:32] said don't go from this meeting and talk
[2:26:34] about tongues but try to get people
[2:26:37] saved he counseled them against all in
[2:26:40] believing and fleshly demonstration
[2:26:42] everything was that was not truly of the
[2:26:45] spirit there were there very leaders
[2:26:47] recognized this is fungus
[2:26:50] this is wrong and they cried out against
[2:26:53] it
[2:26:54] brother Seymour constantly exalted the
[2:26:57] atoning work of Christ the word of God
[2:27:00] and very earnestly he insisted on
[2:27:02] thorough conversion Holiness of heart
[2:27:05] and life and the fullness of the spirit
[2:27:08] another leader of theirs sabji Lake you
[2:27:11] know he would talk about the same thing
[2:27:12] and I quoted this to you before but John
[2:27:15] G Lake was called the Apostle of South
[2:27:17] Africa he was a man who was sent out by
[2:27:20] the Holy Spirit from Azusa Street to
[2:27:22] take the gospel over to South Africa
[2:27:24] and he said that marvelous wave of God
[2:27:27] came over the country from 1900 to 1906
[2:27:30] with hundreds of thousands of people
[2:27:32] were baptized in the Holy Ghost and
[2:27:35] spoke in tongues but listen oh John
[2:27:37] Alexander Riot doubly he he writing on
[2:27:40] the wave of that wonderful manifestation
[2:27:42] of healing power he wanted to build a
[2:27:45] church and stamp it with healing only
[2:27:47] and his church practically did that and
[2:27:50] died
[2:27:51] and other churches branded theirs with
[2:27:53] Holiness only and they died he's talking
[2:27:56] about Pilgrim Holiness nazarenes all of
[2:27:58] them they died others with an anointing
[2:28:01] of the Holy Ghost called baptism they
[2:28:03] died in power also later on we wanted to
[2:28:06] build a great structure and step it with
[2:28:09] tongues and after a while tongues got
[2:28:11] dry somehow the glory and the glow had
[2:28:13] gone out of them they become raply and
[2:28:16] did not sound right what was the matter
[2:28:17] nothing was wrong with the experience
[2:28:21] God had not departed from the life but
[2:28:24] was hidden from our view and we were
[2:28:27] absorbed in the phenomenon of God and
[2:28:30] not God himself
[2:28:34] but don't be against Pentecost
[2:28:36] I wanted to say it is the experience you
[2:28:40] must have
[2:28:43] without the Dynamics of Pentecost the
[2:28:46] Holy Ghost you will not go in the
[2:28:50] rapture
[2:28:53] brother Madam told us and the message
[2:28:55] took it he promised Malachi for he would
[2:28:57] do this and manifest his word to turn
[2:29:00] the hearts of their children back to the
[2:29:02] fathers back to the original Pentecostal
[2:29:04] word the real Bible word the Pentecostal
[2:29:08] they claimed Pentecostals organization
[2:29:10] there's no such a thing
[2:29:14] Pentecost is an experience not an
[2:29:18] organization they tried to organize it
[2:29:21] but you can't it doesn't organize
[2:29:23] Pentecost is an experience listen it is
[2:29:27] the Seal of God the holy spirit that
[2:29:31] came on the day of Pentecost
[2:29:34] notice what he said it's not an
[2:29:37] organization
[2:29:38] it is an experience
[2:29:40] and it is the Seal of God that came on
[2:29:44] the day of Pentecost brother Branham
[2:29:47] tells us in Jehovah Jireh he said I know
[2:29:50] they say Pentecost they organize
[2:29:51] Pentecost that's wrong Pentecost is an
[2:29:54] experience the methodists get it the
[2:29:57] Baptists get it all of them get it
[2:29:59] Pentecost is not organized it's an
[2:30:02] experience and if you hadn't received
[2:30:04] the experience of Pentecost come receive
[2:30:07] it now remember if you believe me to be
[2:30:10] his servant as Prophet remember there is
[2:30:13] a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:30:15] right in the midst of all the fanaticism
[2:30:19] there is still a genuine Holy Ghost
[2:30:22] birth a genuine born of God and he said
[2:30:25] you come believe it now
[2:30:29] but nevertheless
[2:30:33] though the ensusa movement was not the
[2:30:36] long-awaited restoration
[2:30:38] it was so close
[2:30:43] it was so close Jesus said it would come
[2:30:47] and bring
[2:30:49] the ear
[2:30:51] and then the foliar
[2:30:54] I want you to get it a stage where you
[2:30:57] would have both the ear
[2:30:59] and the Folia
[2:31:02] watch now this Souza Street movement was
[2:31:05] not dealing with long-awaited
[2:31:07] restoration but was so close
[2:31:10] it looked so much like the greens
[2:31:13] that the prophet of God over and over
[2:31:16] through the 50s the early 60s brother
[2:31:19] Bradham taught he actually thought that
[2:31:23] what happened on Azusa Street was the
[2:31:25] original Green
[2:31:28] he actually taught this is a seed it's
[2:31:32] the original Green again it was so close
[2:31:38] I mean you know people in this message
[2:31:40] don't want to be nothing like Azusa
[2:31:42] Street but let me tell you again it was
[2:31:45] so close
[2:31:48] to being the real thing
[2:31:50] that brother Branham said over and over
[2:31:53] again I know I've got collections of
[2:31:57] growth he said over and over again that
[2:32:00] the Pentecostal movement of this day was
[2:32:02] the original Grace
[2:32:09] and he would come later and said it's so
[2:32:11] close it would have deceived the elect
[2:32:13] if it were possible
[2:32:18] that's how close it would come
[2:32:22] so at first
[2:32:24] he declared fervently and passionately
[2:32:29] and asserted that the Azusa Revival was
[2:32:32] the return to the original
[2:32:34] it was not and if you become a message
[2:32:37] student you'll learn it was not until
[2:32:39] the seals was open
[2:32:41] that he realized it was not the grain
[2:32:44] but the shock
[2:32:46] it was still a part that we planned it
[2:32:48] was indeed a move of God it even had
[2:32:50] elements of restoration and it had
[2:32:52] Dynamics but it lacked the mechanics
[2:32:56] it lacked the word being revealed
[2:32:59] the Holy Ghost was falling upon these
[2:33:02] people that he is saying his original
[2:33:04] grain and they're trinitarians
[2:33:08] they're baptizing and father Son and
[2:33:10] Holy Ghost
[2:33:11] they've got every all kinds of truths
[2:33:15] wrong they're trying to build a
[2:33:16] denomination out of it they do
[2:33:20] and yet brother Branham is looking at it
[2:33:22] and he's declaring that's the grave
[2:33:24] that's the grain that's the grain it's
[2:33:26] the original grave it may have some
[2:33:28] fungus on it but it's the grain
[2:33:34] I know that's shocking to a lot of
[2:33:36] people
[2:33:38] but the grain would not just be the
[2:33:40] Dynamics of the spirit movement I want I
[2:33:43] want to get to I want you to understand
[2:33:44] the spirit moving onto Azusa Street was
[2:33:48] the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[2:33:51] the Holy Ghost was moving that was the
[2:33:54] power of God
[2:33:55] it was a demonstration of the things
[2:33:59] that had happened in the book of Acts
[2:34:00] were now happening again
[2:34:03] but they lacked the word
[2:34:11] now
[2:34:13] they lacked
[2:34:15] the original doctrines that Paul
[2:34:17] preached
[2:34:19] now let me just say
[2:34:21] if it's all mechanics word and no
[2:34:23] Dynamics it's not the foliar either
[2:34:28] if it's all Dynamics and not the
[2:34:30] fullness of the word it's not the full
[2:34:32] ear either
[2:34:36] the only way to be the full ear is to
[2:34:39] have mechanics and Dynamics word and
[2:34:43] spirit
[2:34:44] your religion without emotion is dead
[2:34:51] but remember I want you to know though
[2:34:53] it'll look like the whole the the grain
[2:34:56] until brother Branham called it the
[2:34:58] grain all the way past the seal when he
[2:35:00] when he finally realizes what he's
[2:35:02] looking at is not the grain after all
[2:35:05] it's not the full ear
[2:35:07] and he says
[2:35:09] like I said I know this I've thoroughly
[2:35:11] researched it he said the Azusa Street
[2:35:13] was so much like the grain
[2:35:17] he said it is the grain let me just read
[2:35:20] this from master from the Masterpiece
[2:35:22] the stock doesn't look like the seed
[2:35:25] neither does a tonsil now Pentecostal
[2:35:28] Brethren throughout the nation I want
[2:35:29] you to listen if this is the last
[2:35:31] message I'll ever preach this is my
[2:35:33] masterpiece do you realize when the
[2:35:35] wheat the corner wheat falls on the
[2:35:37] ground when it begins to form back to
[2:35:38] its green again what's nature nature
[2:35:41] exactly is God God's working in nature
[2:35:43] is all he can but from that original
[2:35:46] Revival Pentacles Revival they think was
[2:35:49] a seed it wasn't now watch something
[2:35:53] came forth just like the seed now watch
[2:35:56] Jesus said in Saint Matthew 24 24 that
[2:36:00] two spirits in the last day would be so
[2:36:03] close together it would deceive the
[2:36:06] elected if possible now stop don't look
[2:36:08] nothing like a seed neither does a
[2:36:10] tassel look like a seed but notice nod
[2:36:13] in Luther's day but in the last day the
[2:36:16] first day there's a Farmers wheat
[2:36:18] Farmers sitting here the first thing
[2:36:20] comes from a wheat seed you would think
[2:36:22] is what it was the seed but what it's
[2:36:24] it's the husk it forms a little outside
[2:36:27] thing to hold the seed it forms a husk
[2:36:29] but the husk is not the sea no more than
[2:36:32] that tousle that this stock was it's
[2:36:34] only a carrier of the light the corn of
[2:36:37] wheat see then Saint John 12 see Jesus
[2:36:40] speaking the the wheat out to the tassel
[2:36:43] at the Wesley puts forth the husk which
[2:36:46] is the foremost like the grain than
[2:36:48] anything else the husk is more like the
[2:36:52] grain it's coming more like the green
[2:36:54] all the time the one that went into the
[2:36:57] ground but when it and when it comes
[2:36:59] forth the stock has got the life in it
[2:37:01] but sure it isn't the green comes forth
[2:37:04] the tassel the pollen still isn't the
[2:37:06] Grain and then it comes forth the husk
[2:37:08] it is in the sheep of the wheat just
[2:37:11] exactly like a grain of wheat but yet it
[2:37:13] isn't to eat just exactly in the same
[2:37:16] shape perfectly
[2:37:17] Pentecostals come out just like the
[2:37:20] wheatwood each one coming out the other
[2:37:23] coming out of the other but they're only
[2:37:24] a carrier they go into denomination and
[2:37:27] what did Pentecostals do when it come
[2:37:30] out just like the grain it went back
[2:37:32] like in Revelation 17 to one of the
[2:37:34] sister denominations that's exactly what
[2:37:37] what Jesus said now what's the gospel is
[2:37:40] going to come out through Luther through
[2:37:42] Wesley in the Pentecost in the last days
[2:37:44] it'll see the very elected if possible
[2:37:46] the elected old Pentecostal Brethren
[2:37:49] can't you see it the wheat in its first
[2:37:51] beginning is just like the sea when it
[2:37:54] begins to form like the sea but it's the
[2:37:57] husk watch now
[2:38:00] Azusa Street was just like the seed
[2:38:05] but it was the husk
[2:38:09] notice the life he said
[2:38:13] he said the grain seed in the original
[2:38:15] fell at nicaea if it was the first
[2:38:18] denomination now here the light was in
[2:38:21] the stock that tassel all ends up in the
[2:38:24] sea the light that comes out of the
[2:38:26] original Sea comes through the different
[2:38:27] processes three different processes then
[2:38:30] turns back to its original condition he
[2:38:32] said hallelujah oh my I'm the happiest
[2:38:35] person in the world that God has let me
[2:38:38] see this he saw that there was something
[2:38:41] that was more pure
[2:38:43] devil Souza Street
[2:38:46] that it would have more than just spirit
[2:38:50] but it would have the word to accompany
[2:38:53] the spirit and become the full year of
[2:38:57] Grace
[2:38:59] hold on now
[2:39:01] this is the street movement was not a
[2:39:04] full year
[2:39:05] let me just say this neither is a lot of
[2:39:08] this stuff we call message
[2:39:11] Pentecost is not a denomination
[2:39:13] Pentecost is an experience you must have
[2:39:17] remember Pentecost is an experience it's
[2:39:20] the Seal of God
[2:39:22] we've done been through that and brother
[2:39:24] Branham tells us Pentecost is the only
[2:39:28] thing
[2:39:29] that was going to prove Christianity
[2:39:31] you can't prove it by silence you can't
[2:39:33] prove it by nothing but a Pentecostal
[2:39:36] experience I want just to say though
[2:39:38] they're they're uh though their Doctrine
[2:39:42] was wrong the experience was right
[2:39:47] it was the Holy Ghost movie
[2:39:50] it was the spirit of God let me just say
[2:39:53] to you the New Testament is not a record
[2:39:57] of what happened in one generation is
[2:40:00] the blueprint
[2:40:01] of what should happen in every
[2:40:03] generation
[2:40:05] until Jesus comes every generation must
[2:40:10] be regenerated by the Holy Ghost
[2:40:14] let's look at this for a moment brother
[2:40:16] Bradham tells us the church that was at
[2:40:18] Pentecost is the standard
[2:40:21] that is the pattern they didn't just
[2:40:24] have the word they had the spirit they
[2:40:26] didn't just have the spirit they had the
[2:40:28] word somebody helped me preach they had
[2:40:31] the original Gospel of Jesus Christ plus
[2:40:35] the Holy Spirit
[2:40:37] amen they did not have mechanics and no
[2:40:40] Dynamics they had Dynamics and mechanics
[2:40:44] they had it all now again I want you to
[2:40:47] understand we are in the apostolic age
[2:40:51] as long as God is still calling the
[2:40:55] apostolic age is still on
[2:40:58] so you just as much as an Apostolic age
[2:41:02] as it were in on the day of Pentecost
[2:41:06] where God is now fulfilling his word
[2:41:08] just like he promised you know because
[2:41:11] this this is what brother Brandon said
[2:41:13] until he stops calling the Pentecostal
[2:41:16] message and power will not cease
[2:41:21] so you can know that we are in an
[2:41:23] Apostolic age we're an Apostolic
[2:41:26] fulfillment because God will not forget
[2:41:30] his promise he will consummate the
[2:41:33] outpouring of the Holy Spirit now
[2:41:35] brother Madam tells us he said now what
[2:41:38] Satan did he got in it to make it all
[2:41:41] mechanics and no Dynamics or back all
[2:41:45] Dynamics and no mechanics we've got to
[2:41:47] have it together so Satan will get in
[2:41:50] the church
[2:41:51] here's where the fungus comes
[2:41:54] I want you to get it clear here's where
[2:41:56] the fungus go to make it all Dynamics
[2:42:00] and no mechanics in the word
[2:42:02] are all word and no spirit
[2:42:07] and both of them are the fungus on the
[2:42:10] planet
[2:42:12] and they distort the seed to make it
[2:42:14] look like nothing like the original
[2:42:18] because of how the word without Spirit
[2:42:20] you don't look like the original to have
[2:42:23] the spirit without the word you don't
[2:42:26] look like the original
[2:42:28] but God promised he's going to bring it
[2:42:30] back to his original planting
[2:42:33] amen because God does not forget
[2:42:35] remember the Dynamics is the holy spirit
[2:42:38] Paul would say Our Gospel didn't come to
[2:42:41] you in word only but in power and in
[2:42:45] Holy Ghost and in much assurance
[2:42:47] and when you have a church when you have
[2:42:50] a movement when you have a group of
[2:42:52] people that they're all aware and no
[2:42:54] Spirit are all spirit and no word you
[2:42:57] have a you have a people who are full of
[2:43:00] fungus
[2:43:03] great
[2:43:05] now
[2:43:07] it'll take the Dynamics
[2:43:10] and I I don't have time to go on it but
[2:43:13] I just want you to understand
[2:43:14] I want you to understand something God
[2:43:17] is not through pouring out his spirit
[2:43:23] he has started it in the first day I
[2:43:25] mean the first of this age laodicea and
[2:43:28] he's going to bring it all the way into
[2:43:29] fruition
[2:43:31] amen come on he has not quit calling
[2:43:37] and the promises unto you to your
[2:43:39] children as many as the Lord thy God
[2:43:41] shall call and as long as God's calling
[2:43:44] the apostolic age is still in
[2:43:48] and the full year will have both power
[2:43:51] and word
[2:43:53] they will not be void of the spirit of
[2:43:56] God not bullied on the word of God
[2:44:00] now let's get this clear what the church
[2:44:02] will be because I just want to say how
[2:44:05] come
[2:44:07] how come
[2:44:09] has the church now
[2:44:12] backslid into the Campbell light
[2:44:15] Alexander dowie
[2:44:18] Church of Christ mentality and thinking
[2:44:21] saying like they did
[2:44:23] because they said we now we now we have
[2:44:26] the perfect Canon of the New Testament
[2:44:29] it's all it's all available the Bible is
[2:44:32] complete that which is perfect has come
[2:44:34] and it's a more perfect way so God does
[2:44:38] not heal anymore God does not deliver
[2:44:40] anymore God does not do any of these
[2:44:43] things anymore it's all over with you
[2:44:46] know Miracles are ceased because we now
[2:44:48] have the perfect word
[2:44:50] but I want to assert the perfect word
[2:44:52] brings the power
[2:44:55] the perfect word brings Deliverance the
[2:44:58] more perfect way has signs and wonders
[2:45:01] and faith and gifts of the Spirit and
[2:45:04] the power of God and you can have a
[2:45:06] perfect way and a full year and not have
[2:45:09] it
[2:45:13] now
[2:45:15] brother Brandon said about them early
[2:45:16] Pentecostals
[2:45:18] that he thought was Green
[2:45:20] or the full ear
[2:45:22] he said if you took a microscope
[2:45:25] I wanted to say that's a prophetic guy
[2:45:28] that's a microscope
[2:45:30] he said you would see there was a little
[2:45:33] tiny grain
[2:45:37] so you go all the way back
[2:45:40] to Azusa Street
[2:45:42] and you put the prophetic eye on it
[2:45:45] you see more than just husk
[2:45:48] you see a little tiny immature grain
[2:45:52] starting there
[2:45:55] because they would get the spirit
[2:45:57] without having the word returned or
[2:46:01] restored
[2:46:03] but God said I'm gonna remember my
[2:46:05] promise I hadn't forgot it
[2:46:07] I'm going to bring forth for the bride
[2:46:10] who will have the fullness of the word
[2:46:12] who the Mysteries will be revealed to
[2:46:15] who will understand what the Thunder
[2:46:17] said somebody help me preach about who
[2:46:20] the mysteries of God had been manifest
[2:46:22] to who baptized right who understand
[2:46:25] they were chosen before the foundation
[2:46:27] of the world who preach the gospel that
[2:46:29] Paul preached and they also have the
[2:46:31] power of the Apostles
[2:46:34] thank you
[2:46:36] way back under the microscope you can
[2:46:40] see a little bud then comes the grain
[2:46:44] the seed not air with the shuck he said
[2:46:47] when sanctification moved over the
[2:46:49] pilgrim Holiness and so forth all the
[2:46:51] pilgrim Holiness organizations nazarenes
[2:46:54] and so forth it moved from there right
[2:46:56] out in this Pentecostal age and look at
[2:46:58] that little grain now of wheat it looks
[2:47:01] a million times more like the original
[2:47:04] wheat wait a minute
[2:47:06] Azusa Street looked a million times more
[2:47:09] like it
[2:47:10] like the grain than the methodists
[2:47:13] then the Baptists
[2:47:16] million times more like the original
[2:47:19] wheat that went to the ground than the
[2:47:21] stock did or the pollen did but if you
[2:47:23] sit down and you pull it put it under
[2:47:25] glass and you open up these little
[2:47:27] Chucks they're just carriers also the
[2:47:30] grain hadn't started yet it's a little
[2:47:32] bitty Bud oil right in the back with the
[2:47:35] big high-powered glass you can see that
[2:47:37] little tip like a little like a pinpoint
[2:47:40] and then comes the sea and then then
[2:47:43] here this here shop that looks just
[2:47:46] exactly like the real thing it isn't the
[2:47:48] real thing it's only a womb
[2:47:53] foreign
[2:47:56] I just want to say don't hate your
[2:47:58] mother
[2:48:04] don't look like come on
[2:48:06] don't despise your mother she was the
[2:48:09] womb you were to be born out of
[2:48:11] out of the womb of the Azusa movement
[2:48:13] came a prophet
[2:48:16] out of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[2:48:18] came the word revealed
[2:48:21] now those are early Pentecostals
[2:48:25] they believed that the Lord healed today
[2:48:28] just as abode
[2:48:31] and many of them had marvelous healings
[2:48:33] themselves
[2:48:34] they were one and all they were eagerly
[2:48:37] looking for the Covenant of the Lord
[2:48:40] they were every one of them honored the
[2:48:42] word of God believing in every part of
[2:48:44] it they were seeking not the not to be
[2:48:47] just hearers of the word that wanted to
[2:48:49] be doers of the word
[2:48:51] they believed that indeed they were now
[2:48:53] living in the last days and and they
[2:48:55] would quote the scripture of Joel it
[2:48:57] should come to pass in the last days say
[2:49:00] of God I will pour out my spirit upon
[2:49:02] All Flesh and the Lord Jesus himself had
[2:49:05] exalted at the right hand of the father
[2:49:08] was the one who had set forth this light
[2:49:10] that you now see and hear they believed
[2:49:13] that God was pouring out his spirit
[2:49:16] we ought to believe that
[2:49:19] to be the true come on we ought to
[2:49:22] believe God is pouring out his spirit
[2:49:25] and we must have his Spirit we cannot be
[2:49:30] dissatisfied with having the message and
[2:49:34] City backslow you know smugly and so
[2:49:37] well we've got all of the word and we've
[2:49:39] got all the message and you have no
[2:49:41] spirit
[2:49:48] in those days there were Baptist
[2:49:50] Methodist Presbyterian congregationalist
[2:49:52] Episcopalian Holiness people Christians
[2:49:55] from every denomination from nor from no
[2:49:57] denomination who had received the
[2:49:59] experience these Spirit-filled ones were
[2:50:02] made very much of the precious blood of
[2:50:04] Jesus and that the Cross of Christ had
[2:50:07] been made real to them to the power of
[2:50:09] the Holy Ghost they believed that the
[2:50:10] Lord healed today just as of old
[2:50:13] many of them had marvelous healings that
[2:50:16] looked for his coming they expected it
[2:50:19] God started pouring out his spirit in
[2:50:21] 1906. I said I want to say at the
[2:50:24] Turning of the century you'll find out
[2:50:26] in 1900 God began to pour out his Spirit
[2:50:29] it actually would begin at Topeka Kansas
[2:50:33] as the day dawned
[2:50:35] in that early day of January the 1st
[2:50:38] 1900 in Topeka Kansas
[2:50:41] there was a group of people that were
[2:50:44] gathered together studying the scripture
[2:50:46] and they were looking at when you and
[2:50:49] they were saying we want to be like the
[2:50:52] book of Acts we want to see the power of
[2:50:56] God we must have the experience that
[2:50:59] they had on the day of Pentecost they
[2:51:02] were hungry they were thirsted they were
[2:51:04] calling on God and they were studying
[2:51:06] the scripture earnestly
[2:51:08] to see that there would be an outpouring
[2:51:11] of the Holy Ghost for they their day and
[2:51:13] time and they were believing you know
[2:51:15] that it was it's our day it's our time
[2:51:18] it's our hour for this to happen
[2:51:21] let's talk about the shelter moment that
[2:51:24] husk that looks so much like the gray
[2:51:27] I want to get it back to you it looks so
[2:51:30] much like the real
[2:51:32] till brother Branham called it the real
[2:51:40] I want you to understand
[2:51:42] that move of God looked like the grain
[2:51:48] let me reverse it then this move of God
[2:51:51] the grain has to look like that
[2:51:58] within that Chuck
[2:52:01] prophetic eye
[2:52:03] looked upon it discerned this little
[2:52:05] bird of Grace
[2:52:08] coming up there it wasn't mature it was
[2:52:10] still in its infancy still had
[2:52:12] trinitarian views it still was confused
[2:52:15] on a lot of truths the seals hadn't been
[2:52:18] taken off the book it was more Dynamics
[2:52:20] than it was doctrinal word they made
[2:52:23] doctrinal word out of things that wasn't
[2:52:25] even scriptural and the shock
[2:52:29] but out of that shock or that chuck
[2:52:32] would be come the womb that the grain
[2:52:34] would be born out of
[2:52:37] but God had remembered his promise
[2:52:40] and his promise I want you to get it God
[2:52:43] remembers
[2:52:44] and he remembers his promise that says
[2:52:47] in the last days
[2:52:50] I'm going to pour out my spirit
[2:52:53] Acts 2 17 it's come to pass in that day
[2:52:56] saith God I will pour out my spirit upon
[2:52:59] All Flesh and your sons and daughters
[2:53:02] shall prophesy this is what happens when
[2:53:04] God pours out of the spirit that
[2:53:07] prophesied young men see visions
[2:53:09] all men dream dreams all my servants my
[2:53:13] handmaids I'm pour out my spirits in
[2:53:15] those days and they shall prophesy and I
[2:53:19] shall show wonders in heavens above and
[2:53:21] signs of the earth beneath
[2:53:23] Isaiah would prophesy these are
[2:53:26] scriptures that have to be fulfilled and
[2:53:28] anointed in our day for he said in
[2:53:30] Isaiah 28 11 for his stampered lips and
[2:53:34] another tongue will he speak to this
[2:53:36] people to whom he said this is the rest
[2:53:39] wherein you may cause the weary to rest
[2:53:42] and this isn't refreshing yet they would
[2:53:45] not hear
[2:53:47] and by the way like I said
[2:53:49] it didn't even started Azusa Street
[2:53:51] that's where it received notoriety but
[2:53:54] that's not where it started
[2:53:56] it started in Topeka Kansas six years
[2:53:58] before that January the first
[2:54:02] first day of the year of the new century
[2:54:06] something began to happen
[2:54:08] a young girl named Agnes
[2:54:10] in Topeka Kansas
[2:54:12] was one of the first to receive the
[2:54:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:54:18] she testified
[2:54:20] that it was 11 o'clock on this first of
[2:54:24] January that it came in her heart
[2:54:26] she'd been studying in the Bible with
[2:54:28] all the other students in a b Simpson
[2:54:31] School
[2:54:33] and she saw there that many times the
[2:54:36] Holy Ghost would come when someone was
[2:54:37] laid on with hands
[2:54:40] and Handler she asked she asked that
[2:54:43] hands would be laid on her and and
[2:54:45] uploading her head whether they'd laid
[2:54:49] their hands and and they were just
[2:54:51] they're just saying God you know just do
[2:54:53] what you said and fulfill your promise
[2:54:55] and you know and said his hands was laid
[2:54:58] upon her head the Holy Spirit began to
[2:55:00] fall upon her and she began glorifying
[2:55:03] God she spoke in several languages that
[2:55:06] day
[2:55:07] and you know it was she said it was
[2:55:10] those rivers of Living Water were
[2:55:13] proceeding from my innermost being
[2:55:16] and I wanted to say these Living Waters
[2:55:19] were not gibberish
[2:55:22] they were not manufactured
[2:55:25] hey you know there was nobody jiggling
[2:55:28] her chin saying Jesus Jesus to she had a
[2:55:30] confusion of language
[2:55:32] these were real
[2:55:34] in fact they were so real the next day
[2:55:37] she prayed for a man in English and then
[2:55:40] began to speak in tongues again and the
[2:55:42] man was from Bohemia the western part of
[2:55:44] what is now Czech Republic and she spoke
[2:55:47] his language and he he understood what
[2:55:51] she said
[2:55:52] so you see what happened there was not a
[2:55:55] confusion of tongues it was not unknown
[2:55:58] tongues it was not gibberish it was
[2:56:01] languages
[2:56:02] amen now news of this outpouring began
[2:56:05] to be heard everywhere and from there it
[2:56:08] spread from Kansas and the news that God
[2:56:11] was pouring out his Spirit it reached a
[2:56:13] reached down to a Bible school that held
[2:56:16] down in Houston Texas there was a man
[2:56:19] that was sitting out in the hallway
[2:56:21] you know he was a black man this was a
[2:56:25] white school laws were there where they
[2:56:27] wouldn't let this black man mixed with
[2:56:29] the whites so he's sitting out in the
[2:56:32] hallway listening and something strikes
[2:56:35] his heart when he hears about the holy
[2:56:38] spirit being poured out like on the day
[2:56:40] of Pentecost and this man begins to seek
[2:56:43] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:56:46] begin to preach you know that this can
[2:56:48] happen in our day and this is the word
[2:56:51] of the Lord and this is what happened
[2:56:53] then we can see Bible days again and we
[2:56:56] can add the book of Acts working Upon Us
[2:56:58] by the way when is this made this if
[2:57:01] this tree ever puts forth another Branch
[2:57:04] what kind of Branch would it put out
[2:57:06] amen another book of Acts somebody help
[2:57:09] me preach that's what's promised when
[2:57:12] God remembers I'm going to bring it to
[2:57:15] fruition look what he said look what he
[2:57:17] happens you know again he began to be
[2:57:20] convinced this is that I haven't
[2:57:23] received it I don't know how it feels
[2:57:25] but I believe that and he began to pray
[2:57:28] for it and he began to preach that and
[2:57:31] and you know somebody uh there are many
[2:57:34] men there and said you know there's a
[2:57:35] church and Los Angeles California that
[2:57:39] is looking for a pastor
[2:57:42] and and so again he packed up and he
[2:57:46] moved all the way to Los Angeles feeling
[2:57:48] it was the call of God he got up and he
[2:57:51] preached just what we're talking about
[2:57:52] you know I'll pour out my spirit upon
[2:57:55] All Flesh they spoke with other tongues
[2:57:57] we can have what they had in the book of
[2:58:00] Acts this Disturbed that church so much
[2:58:02] they locked the doors on him and turned
[2:58:05] him out a Baptist couple invited him to
[2:58:08] come to a prayer meeting in their home
[2:58:10] and they began to pray for an outpouring
[2:58:13] of the holy spirit this was on 214 North
[2:58:16] Bonnie Bray Street and here people begin
[2:58:19] to gather and they begin to pray they
[2:58:21] begin to ask God for now pouring look
[2:58:24] Lord look you know again you promised to
[2:58:28] come you promised that you would reveal
[2:58:30] yourself you said you would pour out
[2:58:32] your spirit I want that Holy Spirit and
[2:58:35] they were calling out to God for it and
[2:58:37] God remembered his promise
[2:58:40] and things begin to happen it would
[2:58:43] actually be on you know there that
[2:58:46] Miracles were taking place healings and
[2:58:48] miracles and things happening but yet
[2:58:50] you know at the same time of these
[2:58:52] Miracles happening uh they still did not
[2:58:55] received that outpouring that they were
[2:58:57] looking for so they were still calling
[2:59:00] out to God on April the 9th 1906
[2:59:03] Seymour was about to leave for a prayer
[2:59:06] meeting because they had to leave the
[2:59:08] house on Bonnie Bray and move over to an
[2:59:11] old barn on Azusa Street and and there
[2:59:15] in this old barn they were meeting for a
[2:59:18] prayer meeting because there's so many
[2:59:20] people had become and there there was a
[2:59:23] man by the name of Edward Lee he walked
[2:59:26] out and he asked for prayer to receive
[2:59:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost said he
[2:59:31] had heard preached about it had never
[2:59:34] happened there Seymour had never
[2:59:36] received it you know it had not broke
[2:59:39] out yet but at the meeting you know when
[2:59:43] when he uh when he asked for that he
[2:59:46] prayed for him laid hands on him and Lee
[2:59:48] suddenly began to give glory to God in
[2:59:52] other tongues as at the meeting that
[2:59:54] night this surprise Seymour you know he
[2:59:57] he was so surprised by then he told what
[3:00:00] had happened time of earnest prayer
[3:00:02] broke out at the end of the meeting
[3:00:03] seven people we're now speaking in other
[3:00:07] tongues other languages languages they
[3:00:10] had never studied one woman a maid who
[3:00:13] worked at a home across the street she
[3:00:16] had come to the prayer meeting she she
[3:00:19] uh went to the piano so moved by the
[3:00:22] spirit and began to play you know
[3:00:24] beautifully never having a lesson in her
[3:00:27] life her gift proved to be permanent it
[3:00:30] never left her hey man you know and then
[3:00:33] from there there were great men that
[3:00:36] rose up in the power of the spirit men
[3:00:38] like Charles price John G Lake F
[3:00:41] Bosworth Smith Wigglesworth I want you
[3:00:43] to understand these were men of God this
[3:00:46] was a move of God this was the Dynamics
[3:00:49] this was the Holy Ghost falling amen the
[3:00:53] word hadn't come but the power of it was
[3:00:56] already falling
[3:01:00] I want you to get it God was remembering
[3:01:03] his promise
[3:01:04] I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[3:01:08] and their people now responding
[3:01:15] men would rise up
[3:01:17] it was spark of faith in their heart
[3:01:20] that would believe in God doing the
[3:01:22] impossible
[3:01:25] let me tell you
[3:01:28] one day there was this 15 year old boy
[3:01:31] his name was Kenneth Ware one of your
[3:01:33] kitten folks from there
[3:01:35] Kenneth Ware Was Heard down the street
[3:01:39] he heard a man's voice ring out come
[3:01:42] here boy
[3:01:45] put out your tongue he'd never seen the
[3:01:47] man before
[3:01:49] this man had never even introduced
[3:01:51] himself
[3:01:52] Kenneth didn't have the nerve to run off
[3:01:55] he did what the man ordered
[3:01:58] real one reason he couldn't say a word
[3:02:01] because he knew if he tried he'd only
[3:02:03] stutter his speech impediment had such a
[3:02:06] serious drawback to him as long as long
[3:02:08] as he could remember
[3:02:09] but before he knew what happened what
[3:02:12] had happened this audacious man reached
[3:02:15] out and grabbed his tongue
[3:02:17] and he said lad this tongue will preach
[3:02:20] the gospel
[3:02:21] and then he walked away
[3:02:24] from that moment forward Kenneth never
[3:02:27] stuttered again
[3:02:28] he preached his first sermon at age 17
[3:02:31] became a lifelong missionary especially
[3:02:34] to the Jewish refugees in France and
[3:02:37] that stranger who had stopped him on the
[3:02:39] street was none other than the Bold
[3:02:41] British evangelist Smith Wigglesworth
[3:02:47] I'm trying to tell you
[3:02:49] I'm trying to tell you it looked like
[3:02:51] the grain
[3:02:55] I'm trying to tell you life was in it
[3:02:59] and that life was the Holy Ghost I'm
[3:03:02] trying to tell you it had Dynamics in it
[3:03:06] amen they didn't have the mechanics yet
[3:03:08] but the Dynamics was already there
[3:03:12] God was already moving
[3:03:14] Smith Wigglesworth I mean I know we got
[3:03:17] great things that we could Acclaim about
[3:03:19] the prophet of this day but I want to
[3:03:21] just save Smith Wigglesworth he was
[3:03:23] stand with an assistant to to him as us
[3:03:27] he was staying in a home that was an
[3:03:29] assistant priest
[3:03:31] and this this man had had
[3:03:34] amputation of both legs below the knee
[3:03:39] in those days
[3:03:41] Prosthetics was weren't available to
[3:03:43] help people like that
[3:03:46] and after dinner
[3:03:47] Wiggles words
[3:03:49] Smith Wigglesworth blurted out to the
[3:03:51] men go
[3:03:53] and get a new pair of shoes in the
[3:03:55] morning
[3:03:58] is this a kind of a cruel joke what was
[3:04:00] it
[3:04:02] he hardly knew how to take this
[3:04:03] directive
[3:04:05] but during the night he sensed that God
[3:04:07] was saying something to him
[3:04:09] he could get no sleep the rest of the
[3:04:11] night the next morning found him
[3:04:13] in his wheelchair in front of the shoe
[3:04:16] shop
[3:04:18] when the shoe shop all opened he rolled
[3:04:21] in and said to the clerk
[3:04:24] would you get me a pair of shoes and the
[3:04:25] clerk said well what color what what
[3:04:27] size what color
[3:04:29] and then he looked down and saw no feet
[3:04:31] and he said sir I can't help you
[3:04:33] he said it's all right young man so just
[3:04:35] just I do want a pair of shoes I want
[3:04:38] size eight and I want color black
[3:04:42] well the clerk couldn't think of what
[3:04:43] else to do so he just went and got the
[3:04:45] requested juice
[3:04:47] and when he returned
[3:04:50] the this man
[3:04:53] stuck out one foot
[3:04:55] for the shoe to be put on
[3:04:58] and a leg grew out of that stump with a
[3:05:01] foot
[3:05:03] and the next thing you know he stuck out
[3:05:06] the other leg and out of that leg grew
[3:05:09] another foot
[3:05:12] and it went out wearing a size eight
[3:05:16] black pair of shoes
[3:05:19] because a man of God was operating as
[3:05:23] they did in the book of Acts
[3:05:28] because God hath not forgot his promise
[3:05:32] and God was doing the impossible
[3:05:37] hallelujah amen while Smith Wigglesworth
[3:05:41] wasn't surprised at all he said God
[3:05:43] could God can you know if God can heal a
[3:05:46] bone and put it back together God can
[3:05:48] make new feet listen it is Promised by
[3:05:51] the spoken word in this day under the
[3:05:54] Seven Seals the prophet of God said we
[3:05:57] are looking for the time we're missing
[3:05:59] limbs will be restored again
[3:06:03] again I'm here to tell you that Dynamics
[3:06:06] is not over the Dynamics has not stopped
[3:06:09] and the Dynamics will never stop in fact
[3:06:13] for the matter you can expect it more
[3:06:17] because we are now in the full year
[3:06:27] we are now in the full year
[3:06:32] it's not husk anymore
[3:06:35] Dynamics and no word
[3:06:38] neither is it some kind of stop with
[3:06:41] well you know theories and words and
[3:06:44] doctrines
[3:06:46] and no power
[3:06:49] and I want you to know that God began
[3:06:51] doing that
[3:06:53] because God remembered
[3:07:01] during Smith Wigglesworth Ministry
[3:07:05] 14. different people were raised from
[3:07:09] the dead
[3:07:11] I'm telling you
[3:07:13] this is what happened in our generation
[3:07:18] I'm telling you this is what happens
[3:07:19] when the Holy Spirit overshadows
[3:07:22] I'm telling you you are in the day of
[3:07:25] the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit I'm
[3:07:28] telling you God has not stopped
[3:07:30] doing his work but God has now just
[3:07:33] begun his work
[3:07:35] we are now in the harvest season and
[3:07:37] that means there is a mature bride a
[3:07:40] mature grain coming into view
[3:07:44] amen I'm telling you this morning don't
[3:07:47] expect Less in the coming year I'm
[3:07:50] telling you we're winding up the age
[3:07:54] Hallelujah and as they say is the
[3:07:57] fullness of Pentecost again the book of
[3:08:01] Acts restores of people with the word
[3:08:03] and the power
[3:08:11] and I'm telling you
[3:08:13] I'm telling you you need to be a people
[3:08:15] just exactly like they were
[3:08:18] crying out to God on the outside that
[3:08:21] day when the angel appeared
[3:08:23] a people under expectancy
[3:08:26] of people under
[3:08:28] who are believing
[3:08:30] a people who are looking for that Sudden
[3:08:33] Change
[3:08:34] because I want you to understand
[3:08:35] suddenly
[3:08:41] suddenly
[3:08:43] suddenly
[3:08:45] brother Ron tells about a man suddenly
[3:08:48] an angel suddenly
[3:08:50] coming into his room laying sitting down
[3:08:53] on his bed putting his hand on his leg
[3:08:57] God let him know you're not in this
[3:08:58] alone
[3:09:03] when my wife was passing away
[3:09:05] suddenly
[3:09:06] one morning an angel
[3:09:08] walked into the room a brother Derek
[3:09:11] Paris a man who don't make things up
[3:09:15] holding an official document
[3:09:18] and saying Karen Pruitt
[3:09:22] it is this is to certify that Karen
[3:09:25] Pruitt has been ushered to the other
[3:09:27] side
[3:09:30] because God don't forget
[3:09:37] I don't have permission to tell this
[3:09:40] just one of my fellow ministers the
[3:09:42] other day
[3:09:43] wrote me he said brother to me said
[3:09:45] something tremendous has happened
[3:09:48] he said I was here in a meeting
[3:09:50] he's a young man
[3:09:52] he's a young man you know that that the
[3:09:55] Holy Spirit has moved on before
[3:09:58] but he said I was getting ready for a
[3:10:00] meeting I was sitting in the study
[3:10:02] and suddenly a whirlwind came in my room
[3:10:05] and a being sat down in a chair right
[3:10:08] beside me
[3:10:10] and that presence of God so overwhelmed
[3:10:13] me I went out and preached with such
[3:10:15] Authority and power and now sick has
[3:10:18] been healed and people were delivered of
[3:10:21] every kind of thing and I want you to
[3:10:23] know
[3:10:23] suddenly
[3:10:26] it may be when you're offering the the
[3:10:29] prayer today
[3:10:32] that the angel will show up
[3:10:38] that suddenly
[3:10:41] things will change
[3:10:45] I am telling you as your pastor is your
[3:10:49] brother
[3:10:51] get ready for sudden changes
[3:10:55] in a moment of discouragement
[3:10:59] in a moment where that you know where
[3:11:02] things were happening that he didn't
[3:11:03] want to even happen
[3:11:05] suddenly
[3:11:07] the angel of God stepped into
[3:11:10] an old cabin
[3:11:13] and met with a man who would become a
[3:11:16] prophet of God
[3:11:17] and tell him from here on
[3:11:21] from here on you are gifted
[3:11:24] and I'm sending you out
[3:11:27] with signs
[3:11:31] and he said it's because
[3:11:33] the near coming the coming of the Lord
[3:11:36] is near
[3:11:39] oh
[3:11:40] but I was 76 77 years ago
[3:11:46] oh but that was a long time ago
[3:11:51] oh but
[3:11:52] seemed like there's been nothing
[3:11:54] happening
[3:11:56] oh but
[3:11:57] everybody's given up
[3:12:01] oh we just settled down and think the
[3:12:04] message just turned into another
[3:12:05] organization we had headquarters in
[3:12:07] Jeffersonville and everybody just sits
[3:12:10] down and does what the prophet says or
[3:12:12] the headquarters says
[3:12:17] oh we're just going to have an Israel
[3:12:20] you'll stand in another denomination
[3:12:23] it won't
[3:12:27] I want to tell you Seven Angels Came
[3:12:29] From Another Dimension
[3:12:33] to bring the opening of The Seven Seals
[3:12:36] because God had wrote it in his book and
[3:12:39] he swore by him that liveth forever and
[3:12:41] ever
[3:12:42] that there all won't always be a delay
[3:12:46] that time shall be no more that the
[3:12:49] delay will one day be over
[3:12:51] and I'm here to tell you we are here
[3:12:54] where things are rapidly happening
[3:12:59] and I'm here to say don't give up on
[3:13:02] your promise
[3:13:07] I'm here to say
[3:13:11] how it will be

[3:13:58] are you going to say
[3:14:00] behold the handmaiden of the Lord
[3:14:03] you said it would happen
[3:14:05] pour out your spirit on me

[3:14:13] and before I uh before I honor any more
[3:14:16] unbelief shut my mouth
[3:14:22] but Lord let mine be a profession of
[3:14:24] faith
