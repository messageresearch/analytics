[11:18] people Lord that elevate their faith
[11:21] tonight to believe and as brother

[12:20] over this meeting tonight in Jesus name
[12:22] Amen if you have your Bibles tonight
[12:24] we're gonna look here in first
[12:26] Corinthians chapter 2
[12:46] you love the Lord tonight amen
[12:54] just want to share something I had
[12:57] spoken several several weeks back to our
[12:59] young people in the message that I'd
[13:01] called God will meet your expectations
[13:04] and tonight I want to carry that on I
[13:06] know we haven't had any youth meetings
[13:08] but we're here tonight when brother
[13:12] Timothy had called me and asked me if I
[13:13] would take the service this was the
[13:14] first thought that came to my heart and
[13:16] I just felt that this is exactly what
[13:18] the Lord wants us to hear in this
[13:20] certain time that we're living in with
[13:22] the conditions or around us that we're
[13:24] being inundated with I want to speak
[13:27] tonight on God will meet your
[13:29] expectations part 2 and we look here in
[13:31] first Corinthians 2 and verse 9 the
[13:34] Bible says but as it is written eye has
[13:37] not seen nor ear heard neither have
[13:41] entered into the heart of man the things
[13:43] which God had prepared for them that
[13:46] love him think about that your eye has
[13:50] not seen your ear has never heard and
[13:52] it's never even perceived in the heart
[13:55] of man the things that God have in store
[13:57] for us and we look here in Ephesians 3
[14:00] and verse 20 and this is what we're
[14:01] going to draw our context tonight now
[14:03] into him that is able to do exceeding
[14:05] abundantly above all that we can ask or
[14:08] think according to the power that word
[14:10] power there is Dunamis according to the
[14:13] power that worketh in us unto Him be
[14:16] glory in the church notice now unto Him
[14:19] be glory we're in the church by Jesus
[14:22] Christ are by Christ Jesus throughout
[14:24] all the ages without end amen you can be
[14:27] seated tonight we just pray the Lord
[14:28] will bless the reading of his word and
[14:31] we just want to continue to lift those
[14:32] up in prayer brother Ron brother Jul
[14:36] brother Mickey brother Vernon sister
[14:38] Shalom many other ones that are shut-in
[14:39] and just trust God I have the
[14:41] preeminence and I've trusted your
[14:43] streaming tonight and you'll be
[14:44] encouraged this word exceeding
[14:46] abundantly here means a super abundant
[14:50] super abundant in quantity are superior
[14:53] in quality exceeding abundantly above
[14:57] more more abundant advanced
[15:00] it's exceedingly very high beyond
[15:02] measure
[15:03] now we're finite people we measure
[15:05] things by whether it be a ruler or
[15:07] yardstick or maybe by money whether it
[15:10] be by success whether it be by this out
[15:12] on the other but yet God is saying it's
[15:14] beyond measure you can't even measure
[15:16] what God has in store for the believer
[15:19] it's more superfluous it's supremely
[15:22] much more than all more plainly superior
[15:26] extraordinary surpassing and it's
[15:29] uncommon aren't you glad to be a
[15:32] believer because your benefits are
[15:35] uncommon to this world because God pours
[15:37] it out on you it means preeminence
[15:40] superiority advantage more imminent more
[15:44] remarkable more excellent I'm so glad to
[15:48] be a child of God to know that God said
[15:51] that he will do exceeding abundantly
[15:53] above all that I can ask all that I can
[15:57] think according to the Dunamis power
[15:59] that were pedina Mystere means the power
[16:02] to perform miracles it's the power is
[16:05] strength it's violence it's mighty it's
[16:08] wonderful oh let me tell you God there's
[16:10] a power that lays in a believer tonight
[16:12] because we're not resting on their own
[16:14] ability they're not resting on their own
[16:17] merits they're resting on what God has
[16:19] done for them he saved him he redeemed
[16:22] him there was an Easter that resurrected
[16:24] in their life and now they serve a
[16:26] living God and because their trust is
[16:28] not in their own selves for the sin that
[16:30] God God says I will do exceedingly for
[16:33] you tonight I will do more abundantly
[16:35] for you tonight I will do more
[16:37] superfluous for you tonight
[16:38] you got a need tonight I'm the God that
[16:41] I meet that need
[16:42] you got a desire on your heart tonight
[16:43] I'm God Elohim el Shelly on the breast
[16:46] of God tonight and he's here to meet
[16:48] that need whether you're in the service
[16:51] tonight her on the stream on the other
[16:52] end God is still God and he's able
[16:55] tonight and he's willing tonight and
[16:57] he's here tonight service at the sir
[17:00] he's ready to meet the need and his
[17:03] expectations other believers do you
[17:05] believe that now let's just think about
[17:08] this think about your greatest thought
[17:12] brother George your greatest Epiphany
[17:19] your greatest thought the thing that you
[17:22] imagine sometimes we imagine being up
[17:25] maybe a character in the Bible or maybe
[17:30] sometimes we imagine being super rich I
[17:32] don't know what your imaginations are
[17:34] but we can think we can imagine we can
[17:36] just think about the blessings what it
[17:38] would be like to walk on the streets of
[17:41] gold and different things of that nature
[17:43] and your greatest imagination your
[17:46] greatest understanding of God God says
[17:50] right here in this one scripture he will
[17:53] go beyond human perception he will go
[17:56] beyond human descriptions the God that
[17:59] we serve tonight is able to far succeed
[18:02] your greatest imagination your greatest
[18:05] fantasy your greatest desire he wants to
[18:08] do more for you than you can even
[18:10] conjure up in your mind think about that
[18:13] God tonight
[18:14] think about your greatest desire that
[18:17] you need from God or that you want from
[18:19] God and God is here to tell you I will
[18:21] far succeed that I will meet your
[18:23] expectations but not only meaning how go
[18:26] way beyond your expectations tonight we
[18:32] can imagine more and the most of that
[18:35] what God could possibly do ahead after
[18:37] all of our great imaginations like all
[18:39] of our great thoughts God was able to do
[18:41] more for us than we can even ask he's
[18:45] willing to do more for us than we can
[18:47] even think and here's the thing about it
[18:50] God knows what you have need of before
[18:52] you even ask and we find that play out
[18:56] in Solomon's life God knew exactly what
[18:59] Solomon had need us before we even asked
[19:03] he needed wisdom he need a direction oh
[19:06] and God what did he do he not only did
[19:09] he blessed him with wisdom into
[19:10] Bechet he blessed him with wealth and
[19:12] finances and things of that nature so
[19:14] god knows what we had need of before we
[19:17] asked hearing the message when their
[19:19] eyes rope and I just want to read this
[19:21] clip here is in a prayer line brother
[19:24] BAM speaking to as soon as he goes now
[19:26] if the Lord will reveal to me what your
[19:29] trouble you believe me to be his prophet
[19:32] or a servant you believe it's him the
[19:37] sister says yes yes I know it you you
[19:41] will I thank you sister sure now I
[19:43] believe that's kidney trouble you've
[19:46] been suffering with will leave you do
[19:48] you believe that too he goes you got a
[19:51] request notice now he goes you got a
[19:53] request in your heart you want to ask me
[19:56] how I love this next part what if I
[20:00] reveal your request before you ask me
[20:02] would it make you believe more she said
[20:05] sure you want me to pray for your
[20:07] daughter she's not here that's right you
[20:10] want me to you want me to reveal what's
[20:12] her trouble it's a real nervousness you
[20:14] now believe and she got well see God
[20:17] bless you sister so God knew what her
[20:20] need was before she even spoke it out
[20:23] and God knows your needs before you even
[20:28] speak it he knows what we have need of
[20:30] in John 16 of verse 23 if you'd go there
[20:34] brother if you'd cut me down just a
[20:35] little bit you don't mind John 16 and
[20:38] verse 23 if we drop into the scripture
[20:40] it says whatsoever you ask the Father in
[20:43] my name he may give it you know he's
[20:49] gonna pray about it and he's gonna think
[20:52] about how good you are
[20:53] and he you know we gonna get back to you
[20:56] no whatsoever you ask the Father in my
[21:01] name he will give it to you Oh Church
[21:07] then why are we fearful why are we
[21:09] Freddy notice here in John 16 and 24
[21:13] here there to that word that word here
[21:15] there to means now at this time have you
[21:17] asked me nothing in my name then he's
[21:21] saying he's encouraging
[21:23] and you shall receive that your joy may
[21:26] be full God wants us to ask but many
[21:29] times were profitable we don't want to
[21:31] ask God anything always feel like we're
[21:35] we're bothering God how many you had to
[21:36] go ask the brother for something you
[21:38] needed a hand a favor come on and you
[21:41] just felt kind of shy about it you
[21:43] didn't know what the response is gonna
[21:45] be and maybe they'll say yeah I knew
[21:47] you're praying they'll say you and you
[21:48] got some butterflies you know because
[21:50] maybe you need to borrow a lot of money
[21:52] or maybe need to borrow their truck or
[21:53] whatever it may be but this is not who
[21:56] we're approaching we're approaching God
[21:58] and God wants to give you the very
[22:01] desires of your heart
[22:02] he had many times we were reluctant to
[22:04] to petition God because we treat God
[22:07] like a man we treat God like a brother
[22:10] that maybe his answers gonna be no his
[22:12] answer may be no but his hedge was gonna
[22:14] be the right answer every time he God
[22:17] knows what you have need of well before
[22:20] you ask so he wants us to ask him ask
[22:24] that your choice may be fooled and he's
[22:26] ready and willing to provide everything
[22:29] you ask here in the messes where is he
[22:34] King of the Jews
[22:36] but map says now we believe that you are
[22:39] here this morning can we believe that
[22:40] he's here tonight omnipresent and is
[22:44] more than willing to do the exceeding
[22:46] abundantly above all that we can ask or
[22:49] think imagine if we came to every
[22:52] service believing God was going to move
[22:57] what brother Joe we're quarantined that
[23:00] don't stop God he's omnipresent he's
[23:05] omniscient he's all-knowing all-powerful
[23:08] he's everywhere what are we worried
[23:10] about if we came and approached every
[23:13] service believing that God was going to
[23:15] move maybe you don't have a need but
[23:17] maybe your brother has a need maybe your
[23:19] sister has a need maybe a parent has a
[23:22] need or a sibling hasn't he
[23:24] but what have we approached every
[23:25] service under the expectation that God
[23:28] is gonna meet that need
[23:30] oh what kind of church would we be with
[23:33] Church on fire for God will be a church
[23:35] seeing the miraculous take place in our
[23:38] midst and I say we're that kind of
[23:40] church but I also say God is willing to
[23:43] pour it out more and more and more do
[23:47] you believe that tonight Church so
[23:50] everything that we have neither of the
[23:52] property God will tell us it's in you
[23:54] when you receive the baptism of Holy
[23:55] Ghost you believe that so we find many
[23:59] people have been desiring the Holy Ghost
[24:03] you know a lot of times we think it's
[24:05] gonna be some great big supernatural
[24:07] event you're gonna be at the altar and
[24:09] all of a sudden you're gonna be baptized
[24:11] in the Holy Ghost and you're gonna speak
[24:12] in tones you're gonna run around and
[24:14] you're gonna do something supernatural
[24:15] and the church is gonna push it up on
[24:18] the sign outside and Fox News is gonna
[24:20] call you and get your report seeing in
[24:22] is gonna write an article about it and
[24:24] you're going to be on the headline how I
[24:25] got the Holy Ghost that's not how God
[24:28] moves a lot of times has seen your own
[24:30] personal prayer closet but God comes
[24:32] down just as we heard this past week
[24:34] with one of our sisters how God came
[24:37] down through a course of prayer and she
[24:39] had a desire she needed to know what God
[24:42] had really done for her and she really
[24:44] had the Holy Ghost and her answers were
[24:46] met before she laid on the bed that
[24:48] night that's the God we serve he's a God
[24:51] that's willing to meet your need and
[24:53] meet your expectations
[24:54] I just believe him the thing that we
[24:59] need to do church is to quit waiting and
[25:01] expecting some supernatural event for
[25:03] the infilling of the Holy Ghost and just
[25:05] take God at His Word
[25:07] he says I'll fill you with the Holy
[25:09] Ghost
[25:10] just accept it he promised you the Holy
[25:14] Ghost now begin to take God at His Word
[25:16] but see a lot of times we have a part to
[25:20] play in this you know we find that when
[25:24] you're tempted you have a part to play
[25:25] in temptation whether you yield to it or
[25:28] whether you turn away and resist it we
[25:32] find that the enemy comes in his own
[25:33] slot and he comes and he comes and he
[25:35] comes in the Bible would tell us to
[25:36] resist the devil and he shall flee and
[25:41] the brother branham would tell us in
[25:43] marriage of the Lamb he said if the Lord
[25:44] will take this EVO he goes
[25:46] so mean he says excuse me somebody says
[25:48] if the Lord will take his evil spirit
[25:50] from me from drinking or from gambling
[25:53] or from lying or stealing I'll serve him
[25:56] notice his replies but that's up to you
[26:01] now I want you to pie this same
[26:03] principle not just for sin but for your
[26:06] need tonight there's some things you go
[26:09] we got needs in our life and you know
[26:11] maybe we're we got the Holy Ghost and
[26:13] yet we we're doing things that we may
[26:14] not should do and it's hindering the
[26:16] moving of the Spirit are moving up of us
[26:18] getting our needs met but God is saying
[26:20] right here we got a part to play in that
[26:23] he says now they that overcome him shall
[26:26] inherit all things day that overcome he
[26:29] goes you have a power to do it but you
[26:32] must be willing to lay it down see God
[26:36] cannot push you through a little pipe
[26:39] pull us out on the other end and then
[26:42] say blessed is he that overcometh he
[26:44] says you had nothing to know overcome he
[26:46] just pushed you through but you got to
[26:48] make decisions yourself I have to make
[26:50] decisions myself in doing that we show
[26:53] our faith in our respect to God and they
[26:56] would we find this in Israel they were
[26:58] promised a promised land but they had to
[27:01] fight for every inch and if you want the
[27:03] blessings of God if you want the
[27:05] promises of God you're gonna have to
[27:07] fight for every inch you got the scrap
[27:09] you're gonna have to fight tooth and
[27:10] nail and in toga line with the enemy
[27:12] because he's relentless and we find many
[27:15] people are running in fear over Koba 19
[27:18] cope with 19 is nothing to be fearful
[27:20] about we serve a living God we serve a
[27:23] mighty God if it was something that the
[27:25] bride should fear don't you think he
[27:27] would have put in a Prophet's mind and a
[27:29] profitable revealed it and said beware
[27:31] of what's coming but no we understand as
[27:34] a believer today that the planes may be
[27:36] all around us we know that hey we may
[27:38] get it but who care because we serve a
[27:41] living God he's able to deliver he's
[27:43] willing to deliver he's here to set free
[27:46] he's a God that's greater than Koba 19
[27:48] and he's greater than eating disease and
[27:50] I come out in 2020
[27:53] but we got a fight to hold our Christian
[27:57] example we got a fight and not let fear
[28:00] dictate our lives and anxieties and
[28:02] worries hone us and attack us the land
[28:06] is ours the promise belongs to us
[28:09] everywhere the soles of your feet shall
[28:11] tread upon that is given to you
[28:13] andrew is given to you tonight as a
[28:16] young man that you can serve God with a
[28:18] heart full of passion see God but man
[28:23] will say God has a power to heal you if
[28:25] you got the courage to accept it God has
[28:29] the power to heal let me just say like
[28:32] as God has the power tonight to give you
[28:35] every promise if you got the heart of
[28:37] faith if you got courage tonight to
[28:40] withstand the enemy and take God and His
[28:43] Word God has the power to heal you God
[28:45] has the power to bless you God has a
[28:48] power to meet your need but do you got
[28:50] the curse on a bride that stand up
[28:52] against the enemy and claim your healing
[28:55] and claim your deliverance ain't claim
[28:57] whatever you have me of whatever I
[28:58] promise that God is giving you you've
[29:00] got to fight for it ain't claiming as
[29:02] your own see this holds true for every
[29:07] promise God has a power to meet our
[29:10] expectations but do we have the courage
[29:13] and the faith to accept it and you're
[29:17] gonna have to fight well man we'll make
[29:20] a statement in the message expectations
[29:22] whatever you expect you usually give let
[29:29] us apply that to church I understand we
[29:33] only have a handful of people tonight
[29:34] but he says now in regards to your
[29:37] expectations whatever you expect is what
[29:41] you usually get and you find some people
[29:45] come on they sleep they find some people
[29:49] to drag in 15 minutes after the
[29:51] preaching starts where's the expectation
[29:57] where is the belief that God is gonna
[30:00] move
[30:02] where is the expectations God is going
[30:04] to save my lost loved ones how he's
[30:07] going to heal those that are in need or
[30:09] whatever the need may be when we drag in
[30:13] on God and we expect God to do wondrous
[30:15] works but yet we usually give what we
[30:19] expect
[30:20] remember till he says now you heard
[30:22] about the lady that prayed for the
[30:25] mountain to be moved and she got up the
[30:26] next morning she looked out the window
[30:28] she said just as I expected
[30:30] still there now she prayed for it to
[30:34] move but she expected when she woke up
[30:36] it was still going to be there how many
[30:39] of us pray the same way how many of us
[30:43] pray and believe that God with God we
[30:45] want you to do something but in our
[30:46] heart our expectation is we're gonna
[30:48] face that same problem we're gonna face
[30:51] that same demon we're gonna face that
[30:52] same depression we're gonna face that
[30:54] same fear the next morning it's just
[30:57] going to reciprocate we're gonna go
[30:58] through the same day the same life day
[31:00] after day sarch we gotta believe that
[31:03] God's going to keep his word oh we just
[31:04] need to walk away from it but I'm gonna
[31:07] tell you God will keep his word if
[31:09] you've got the courage tonight to say
[31:11] yes Lord I believe yes what I accept the
[31:13] promises of God maybe you come to the
[31:17] service and you know we find here do you
[31:19] get what you expect and brotherman would
[31:21] say no if you expect that's what you
[31:23] receive if you come to this meeting
[31:25] saying well I'm gonna go down there I'm
[31:28] going to just find some some flowers or
[31:30] the meeting I'm gonna find some flaws of
[31:32] that preacher I bet you can you want to
[31:36] come here tonight and you want to find
[31:37] flaws and brother Joe Adams you can find
[31:39] flaws I'm not perfect I don't claim to
[31:43] be perfect none of us claim to be
[31:45] perfect but are we here to find flaws
[31:47] already here to find Christ but he says
[31:51] if you come with the desire her
[31:53] expectation of find flaws he says you'll
[31:55] find flaws of that preacher I bet you
[31:57] can't don't worry you'll get it the
[31:59] devil will show you plenty of them yes
[32:01] sir he goes you go back there you said
[32:04] just as I expected that's just to what
[32:06] it is you know he said it was the same
[32:08] group that found fault with Jesus
[32:11] noticed us the Pharisees and the
[32:14] Sadducees walked right by
[32:16] and turned her nose up at a but a harlot
[32:20] to give her life to God because she saw
[32:23] something that they didn't see because
[32:27] she was expecting to be changed she
[32:29] needed to be changed but if you don't
[32:32] know you have a desire or a need to be
[32:33] changed what can he change you from the
[32:35] road Ram says now just as you expect
[32:37] that's what you get because you come to
[32:40] this meeting expecting to see the glory
[32:43] of God moving the power of God sinners
[32:45] being sane filled with the holy ghost
[32:47] sickness being healed then watch what
[32:50] God shows you if you cope with that
[32:56] expectation evening light when we get
[32:59] together back again what will our
[33:03] expectations be he won't be six seven
[33:07] eight people in the church this size not
[33:10] to be 300 280 whatever the congregation
[33:14] whatever size the people feel here but
[33:16] what if we came with an expectation of
[33:19] seeing the sick healed what if we came
[33:21] with an expectation seen the power God
[33:23] release sinners from their bondage in
[33:25] their prison bars what if we had an
[33:27] expectation that God will come down and
[33:29] fill all our young people who've yet to
[33:32] be filled he says watch what God will
[33:34] show you will see a church in action
[33:37] with a seal supernatural on the move
[33:40] will see God's feeling will see God
[33:42] healing if we come with the next
[33:44] vacation God is able and God ah ah maybe
[33:48] God set this whole thing aside just to
[33:51] get us where we're more consecrated more
[33:53] dedicated and when we come back our
[33:55] expectations are through the roof maybe
[33:58] there'll be the end of the sleeping
[34:00] people on the pews and the ones dragging
[34:02] in late
[34:02] maybe they'll realize churches are
[34:04] blessing churches and honor only ever go
[34:08] to the house of God and hear the word
[34:09] preached with power and anointing and
[34:12] revelation and demonstration
[34:15] oh we're not some take charts and I
[34:18] don't wanna throw up on the tape Church
[34:19] oh but God has called us under a
[34:21] fivefold ministry forsake not the 'silly
[34:25] the together as those have come
[34:27] accustomed to because of the
[34:29] surroundings of the government or this
[34:31] pushed or that pushed or this idea or
[34:33] that idea we come to meet not with just
[34:36] one another but we come to meet with God
[34:38] and each of us here tonight we begin to
[34:41] create an atmosphere that the Holy
[34:44] Spirit can move and the Holy Spirit can
[34:46] work and if we come with an expectation
[34:48] oh say poured out Lord let the Holy
[34:51] Ghost fall let the unknown he come down
[34:53] like the supernatural take over the
[34:55] service oh I just think about it I
[35:01] wonder what this service would be
[35:03] tonight if right now right now 15
[35:11] minutes eight
[35:12] please start believing we start
[35:16] believing co19 is gonna be pushed back
[35:18] look out start believing we're gonna
[35:20] start we're gonna begin to meet again
[35:21] here very soon and gather together and
[35:24] draw strength from one another I wonder
[35:26] if we can just tonight begins I've set
[35:28] our minds I wanted to be like when we're
[35:30] able to come back in the house of God
[35:32] and hear the music being played Holy
[35:34] Ghost field music and the anointing
[35:36] begin to flow forth from the preacher's
[35:38] mouth oh I wonder what kind of revival
[35:40] would take place I wanted there be one
[35:43] somebody maybe you're out on the
[35:45] internet tonight and you're streaming
[35:46] you say brother don't we're quarantined
[35:47] we can't feel what you're feeling we
[35:50] don't feel that anointing I'm gonna tell
[35:51] you God ain't bound by just these four
[35:54] walls God's able to move right there in
[35:56] your room God is able to heal right
[35:58] there in your room quarantine has
[36:00] nothing to do with God
[36:01] I wonder right there in your living room
[36:06] in your bedroom in your closet wherever
[36:08] you are your study if you can believe
[36:12] and begin to expect God to do what he
[36:17] said you do what would happen tonight
[36:24] well what happened sister Shalom in
[36:27] India
[36:28] you're believing for that cancer to
[36:31] leave what would happen brother Ron
[36:35] tonight is we're all behind you
[36:37] believing for your faith to be elevated
[36:40] and the supernatural just take place
[36:43] what I happen tonight
[36:46] for the jewel this demon trying to take
[36:49] your life to an early grave what would
[36:51] happen if we would just expect the
[36:53] supernatural God promised another Church
[36:57] God promised another book of Acts
[37:00] we're they're gonna fit that book
[37:02] because we're not grafted in limbs
[37:04] however we're born again of the same
[37:06] bond the same spirit the same anointing
[37:10] the same Holy Ghost that poured out on
[37:13] the book of Acts church is the same Holy
[37:16] Ghost is here so what would happen
[37:21] evening like Tabernacle and bride around
[37:24] the world if we can put our doubts aside
[37:28] and start believing start expecting I'm
[37:32] talking more than just believing a lot
[37:34] of times we believe God can do something
[37:36] but we don't expect it to happen in my
[37:39] life we believe for somebody else but
[37:41] what about for me what about expecting
[37:45] for yourself he said that he would heal
[37:48] our sick he said that we could have
[37:49] whatsoever things we desire I believe
[37:54] tonight as the Bible would tell us in
[37:57] Luke 10 and 19 I give you power to tread
[38:01] on serpents and scorpions and over all
[38:03] the power of the enemy he's giving you
[38:06] power tonight to tread on serpents
[38:09] scorpions and over all the power of the
[38:14] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[38:16] harm you or hurt you so that doesn't
[38:20] mean you're not going to be prone from
[38:21] diseases sickness flu whatever they
[38:23] everything else is going on but what it
[38:25] does mean is it's not going to hurt you
[38:28] the God that we serve is greater
[38:31] mightier stronger more powerful more
[38:35] dominant what would happen tonight if we
[38:39] would begin to believe that God sent us
[38:42] all thing in order because it's not this
[38:46] didn't take God by surprise
[38:48] God knew about Cova 19 and to be honest
[38:53] with you the devil had to get permission
[38:54] before he could pour it out but what
[38:57] would happen tonight if God sent all
[38:59] this aside to shut everybody down
[39:02] so you're not looking at this sporting
[39:04] event you're not going over here
[39:06] you're not visiting with somebody every
[39:07] night of the week and you know your
[39:09] quarantine your shutting with your
[39:10] family so God could begin to move on the
[39:12] heart of a prodigal what will begin to
[39:18] have done if we would begin to believe
[39:20] and pray and expect God to move on our
[39:22] prodigal we see brother Justin we're
[39:27] here we know the story of brother Justin
[39:28] how his little sister came up for prayer
[39:30] and within 20 minutes God came down in a
[39:33] bedroom and began to deal with a young
[39:35] man who was way without in the world
[39:37] doing god knows what and yet he
[39:40] staggered into the house of God made his
[39:43] way to the altar gave his heart to God
[39:45] and he's never been the same if God can
[39:50] do that for one certainly he can do for
[39:52] your prodigal certainly he's the same
[39:55] God tonight certainly God didn't expense
[39:58] all his energy on Justin and now nobody
[40:01] else can be saved let's think about
[40:03] brother Phillip Roncalli I think about
[40:05] that testimony I believe that testimony
[40:07] is not so much about brother Phillip
[40:08] pull more about sister Mandy and the
[40:11] kids and how they prayed and how they
[40:13] come I mean every service they were
[40:14] getting a prayer cloth and brother
[40:16] Phillip sit when he finally got saved he
[40:17] looked under his mattress and he had a
[40:19] mound of prayer cloth but you see a wife
[40:22] of children they begin to pray and begin
[40:25] to believe and they begin to expect
[40:27] God's move and they seen the ups and
[40:29] they seen her down they seen the dips in
[40:31] the valleys they've been through hard
[40:32] time but yet God remained faithful and
[40:35] God came down on a Wednesday night
[40:37] service in an unexpected way and God
[40:40] began to move on a man's heart and he
[40:42] surrendered his heart to God and now
[40:44] he's one of the greatest blessings
[40:46] that evening light has ever had I'm
[40:47] gonna take God and still able and
[40:49] willing to move on
[40:51] and maybe we should expect it tonight
[40:53] maybe we should have steak why do we
[40:55] build that mezzanine he wasn't just to
[40:57] look at it wasn't just to say well we
[40:59] got enough room to sit so so we've built
[41:01] it to fill it up and I believe God is
[41:03] able tonight to do just that I believe
[41:05] what we called an expectation gotta fill
[41:08] his church but more importantly God will
[41:11] feel the heart God will fill the heart
[41:14] of the believer
[41:15] so that prodigal who's been wavered
[41:19] do you eat though tonight in the you on
[41:23] the stream that you re creator you look
[41:28] at yourself I don't look like much short
[41:35] dumpy losing my hair I'm a crater
[41:38] absolutely because you're a part of God
[41:43] but LEM said do you know each of you is
[41:46] a creator you're a part of God your sons
[41:49] of God an offspring of God a daughter of
[41:52] God is that right then you are a creator
[41:56] and I'll say tonight it's time that we
[42:00] start using that created a power that's
[42:03] inside of us to create an atmosphere to
[42:06] create an atmosphere that's conducive
[42:10] through the moving of the Spirit of God
[42:14] to create an atmosphere suppose yo we're
[42:17] quarantined but your Creator right there
[42:23] in that little room watching that
[42:25] television screen there's a monitor for
[42:27] whatever you want to call it your
[42:29] computer screen you can begin to create
[42:31] an atmosphere and you can aim and
[42:35] respond to the word there just as you
[42:36] are in a church pew and that same
[42:40] anointing will still feel that room as
[42:42] he's filling this room tonight both of
[42:46] em said you just put one or two good
[42:48] members in a church
[42:50] how many Church good church members do I
[42:53] have here tonight I got two that was a
[42:58] joke I got you all on that one now we're
[43:01] delayed brother Timothy you know you're
[43:02] delayed you got to be the first one
[43:04] no program says now you put one or two
[43:07] good members in a church that's really
[43:10] on fire for God introduce something for
[43:13] that church more than 40 row files
[43:16] think about it more than 40 you camps
[43:20] we've had 34 years of this would have
[43:22] been our 34th year if you kept
[43:25] supernatural weekends and yet the
[43:27] prophet of God let's say you give me one
[43:29] or two
[43:30] give me one on this side give me one on
[43:32] that side
[43:33] give me one out there on internet and
[43:35] you put them in the church and they
[43:37] begin to create an atmosphere it'll do
[43:39] more for that church and 40 revivals oh
[43:42] I'll say come on somebody it's time we
[43:45] get on fire for God it's time we get
[43:48] illuminated and regulated and let me
[43:50] tell you quit worrying about the
[43:51] mechanic and say God fill me with the
[43:54] dynamic fill me with the power I believe
[43:59] church were living in Bible days I
[44:01] believe the Bible signs are here we've
[44:03] seen it we've witnesses here sister
[44:05] Atlanta and little drew and different
[44:08] ones brother David Esther I mean there's
[44:10] a list goes oh no sister Karen it I mean
[44:12] how many we see we we have seen the
[44:15] miraculous take place but God said I
[44:20] will do exceeding abundantly don't limit
[44:25] the moving of the Spirit but even like a
[44:27] vertical justice sister Atlanta or just
[44:30] to this one just to Mariah or just that
[44:33] one what about you and your needs what
[44:35] about your expectation what about the
[44:37] fulfilling of the problems of God to you
[44:39] tonight yes God he says I will do
[44:43] exceeding abundantly above all that you
[44:46] can even ask above all that you can even
[44:48] facile above all that you can even think
[44:50] Oh God and I'm here tonight on the
[44:53] Wednesday night with a handful of people
[44:55] but I'm here to bless you
[44:57] I'm gonna meet your expectations I
[45:04] believe church that God is doing extreme
[45:07] things in a time of darkness he's doing
[45:13] extreme thing
[45:18] well brother Jill was so extreme about
[45:20] it we're all shut in our homes and don't
[45:25] stop God your location doesn't hinder
[45:30] God I've told this testimony once before
[45:36] in regards to brother Jason run collie
[45:39] we all know Jason that he grew up in the
[45:42] church and and he was running from the
[45:44] president the Lord he's tried to serve
[45:46] God through different times of his life
[45:47] and wonderful guys my cousin I love him
[45:51] to death but well you know he was
[45:53] running from the Lord and he's got a
[45:54] faithful wife praying like sister Manny
[45:56] praying that gotta get upon his heart
[45:58] and move upon him and do something for
[46:00] him personally and supernaturally and
[46:02] you know and he was expecting God to do
[46:04] something supernatural - he was gonna be
[46:06] a big thing everybody was gonna know
[46:08] about it one day he was driving his
[46:12] truck or his car he was doing I guess a
[46:13] converter route and he ran a red light
[46:15] and he shouted up cuss word because a
[46:18] whole man this is going south quick but
[46:21] conviction fell upon his heart like that
[46:24] and he began to repent not only for
[46:29] cussing but for the life that he was
[46:31] living and not only when he began to
[46:35] repent and begin to confess God he said
[46:38] the presence of God came into that car
[46:40] that truck and right there in an
[46:43] unexpected place in an unexpected way he
[46:47] met God and he's not been the same since
[46:52] so God understands you maybe quarantine
[46:55] but he can still meet you where you are
[46:59] he is still God he walked through walls
[47:05] when he was hearing on this this earth
[47:07] after the resurrection he can walk
[47:11] through walls today no matter how high
[47:14] you built on how thick you made up your
[47:18] walls will not hinder God from moving if
[47:21] you can believe all things are possible
[47:25] see God is able to do exceeding
[47:30] abundantly he's not concerned about your
[47:33] physical location he's ready for you
[47:36] tonight to take him at his word he's
[47:40] ready for you tonight
[47:42] to doubt your doubts and believe that
[47:46] what he says he will do he will do he's
[47:51] ready tonight for his bride to move do
[47:57] you believe that I believe he's ready to
[48:00] see the bride begin to move in the
[48:03] direction of the supernatural and then
[48:07] we heard a prophet say the move is on
[48:09] for the bride that's does saith the Lord
[48:14] if the move is on why are we moving
[48:21] that's what some will want you to think
[48:24] why aren't we moving because they're
[48:29] stuck in maybe a creed or an idea
[48:31] ideology of what the bride should be or
[48:34] how the bride should work but the move
[48:38] is on for the bride because not only
[48:41] does she possess the mechanics of the
[48:43] word she has the dynamics to go with it
[48:47] and when the mechanics begin to mesh up
[48:51] with the dynamics then he can do it
[48:54] seeding abundantly above all that we can
[48:57] even think you believe that tonight I
[49:00] believe it's time that we begin to take
[49:02] God at His Word and begin to ask God to
[49:06] do extreme things I don't want to bug
[49:10] you're not talking to a man you're
[49:13] talking to your Creator he wants you
[49:16] that's where brother Branham says he
[49:18] wants us to ask and believe that our
[49:22] choice would be full he wants you to ask
[49:27] abundantly I mean sometimes you feel
[49:31] like you where God out know you wearing
[49:34] yourself out God wants you to ask that
[49:40] your joy sister Laurieann will be full
[49:42] notice he says ask for big things and
[49:47] that it's hard for some of us cuz we're
[49:49] simple people we don't want to be big
[49:52] shots we don't want God I want the
[49:55] biggest house God don't know that's not
[49:56] how he's operating but he want you to
[49:58] ask for big things
[49:59] ask for impossible things humanly your
[50:03] situation may be impossible for you but
[50:07] not for the God that you serve so he
[50:09] wants you to ask for big things he said
[50:11] don't limit your faith to some little
[50:13] mustard seed get on out here and some of
[50:17] that other kind of faith move on out
[50:19] there and big things big things is just
[50:23] as easy to receive as little things
[50:28] we've just witnessed at our church a
[50:31] major event you say Rosa what are you
[50:35] talking about a year ago the presence of
[50:38] God met in the back office but 15 years
[50:42] prior a daughter of God and the Son of
[50:45] God had been praying for God to move the
[50:51] Bible would say that Abraham was sterile
[50:54] and his wife Sarah was barren both of
[50:57] them had an issue but he still God and
[51:03] he's able to do extreme things big
[51:05] things and he wants us to ask for big
[51:08] things brother Evan was saying this way
[51:10] in the Misses inspiration he says God
[51:12] wants us to ask for big things see my
[51:15] god he don't run out of blessings up
[51:17] there you can't ask for too much
[51:19] could you imagine a little fish about
[51:21] this song out there in the middle of an
[51:23] ocean saying I better drink of this much
[51:25] water you know it might dry up that's
[51:27] sometimes that's how we think humanly
[51:29] speaking we're gonna wear God out if I
[51:31] keep coming back to the well eventually
[51:33] I'm gonna get to the bottom of it you
[51:34] can exhaust the inexhaustible fountain
[51:37] of life you can't where god out God is
[51:40] the infinite God he's the one who's got
[51:42] bountiful blessings and the Bible say
[51:44] that he daily loaded us with blessings I
[51:47] say pack it up
[51:49] and put it on me God I won't every
[51:51] blessing how much you know poor now give
[51:53] me big things give me impossible things
[51:55] you see my situation but I can't get out
[51:58] of it I can't go through it I can't get
[52:00] around it but God I know that you're my
[52:02] god and I am the apple of your eye maybe
[52:05] you moved from me tonight move this
[52:06] situation back and let me walk on
[52:08] through to dry ground if he can do it
[52:11] for the children Israel with the Orion
[52:13] coming behind them in a red sea in front
[52:15] and mountains on either side they have
[52:17] nowhere to go but God made it way I'm
[52:20] gonna take even like Cameron he's here
[52:22] to make a way for you tonight if you
[52:23] just believe God if you're just ask God
[52:26] and say I'll take you at your word
[52:28] tonight Lord God said we'll heed to do
[52:33] exceeding in abundance notice what he
[52:36] says now see that's just unreasonable as
[52:39] it would be or more so unreasonable than
[52:43] to think that God's blessings would ever
[52:45] be exhausted to a believer to think that
[52:49] a little fish could drink up the whole
[52:50] ocean that's gonna be a big fish when
[52:53] it's all over with and where is all that
[52:55] water going never thought about that one
[52:58] did you
[53:00] he says all heaven
[53:03] belongs to you notice all heaven belongs
[53:10] to you so I say it's time we ask we ask
[53:14] God to begin to repair broken marriages
[53:16] a backbone of a family to structure a
[53:20] solid family husband and wife man and
[53:23] woman raising their kids in the fear and
[53:26] admonition of God supporting each other
[53:28] it's our posted duty at church Wednesday
[53:32] Sunday every time the doors open
[53:34] God begins to repair the marriages ask
[53:37] God to bless your finances this is not
[53:41] some some free loaf and messes or
[53:44] anything like that some get-rich-quick
[53:45] scheme I'm trying to preach to you some
[53:47] you know some prosperity messes no but I
[53:50] believe God knows your heart he knows
[53:52] your situation I don't believe it's too
[53:54] much say God blessed me I'll use it for
[53:56] the glory of God has Gaza begin to heal
[54:00] and restore your body
[54:02] perfect health the doctor says he can't
[54:05] do anymore brother Bram said that's when
[54:07] you jump off that tree a lie or the tree
[54:08] of knowledge of good and evil and you
[54:10] jump on the Tree of Life and keep on
[54:11] going

[54:23] of their age God made you begin to
[54:25] restore their bodies to physicality to
[54:27] him and let them come back to the house
[54:28] of God and begin to experience the
[54:31] services again God asks you to save the
[54:35] lost son the lost daughter says sin has
[54:39] been mounted on them so much scar with
[54:42] tattoos and ptsds and things of that
[54:46] nature all are down through life just
[54:47] made a mockery of their life shame to
[54:50] the parents but God I'm not gonna look
[54:52] at their shame I'm not gonna look at
[54:54] their sin I'm not gonna look at their
[54:55] baggage god I'm asking you tonight to
[54:57] begin to move move on their heart
[55:00] tonight and as we take this time we
[55:03] don't know when we're gonna be open back
[55:05] up to have services but take the
[55:07] opportunities that God reveal yourself
[55:09] to me in a way that you've never done
[55:11] before you made a promise in the book of
[55:14] Joel that you'll pour out your spirit
[55:17] your sons and your daughters will
[55:20] receive a revelation an anointing God

[55:37] world or economics down let me take this
[55:41] time to ask for something big baptize
[55:45] all of my kids with the Holy Ghost that
[55:51] should be our prayer that should be our
[55:53] desire and when we come back and these
[55:57] doors are open
[55:58] probably would be flooding into this
[56:00] place like water just pouring in people
[56:05] on fire for God because moms and dads
[56:08] brothers and sisters begin to pray and
[56:11] expect God to move
[56:15] now mark 11 verse 24 as we begin to
[56:17] start bringing this down start bringing
[56:20] this down and say I was talking to he
[56:23] said what thing soever ye desire when

[56:58] something inside of you you just don't
[57:01] understand what it is but it's a craving
[57:02] so longing there's a desire and it's a
[57:05] righteous desire that's a craving God
[57:08] place it there and he's wanting you to
[57:10] pray that he will feel it he knows what
[57:14] you have need of the word believed there
[57:18] means to be persuaded of if you can
[57:22] believe notice be persuaded take to
[57:26] oneself to procure it to yourself to

[1:00:13] obey the Word of God I believe tonight
[1:00:16] we're gonna see high blood pressure
[1:00:18] brother Timothy defeated because it

[1:00:28] to possess the land and we got to start
[1:00:32] on possessing this land I believe

[1:00:37] brother Aaron we're gonna see diseases
[1:00:39] like that defeated and God rest
[1:00:42] directing testimonies of what he's doing

[1:00:47] we're gonna see and witness again that
[1:00:49] God is still in the demon casting out
[1:00:51] business the Bible was saying Daniel
[1:00:55] 11:32 he says and so and such as do
[1:00:59] wickley against a covenant shall he
[1:01:01] corrupt by flatteries but the people how

[1:02:19] uncertainty brother Timothy he's asking
[1:02:22] you to believe in a resurrection not
[1:02:25] 2000 years ago but tonight tonight he's
[1:02:29] asking to believe in an Eastern that's
[1:02:31] gonna happen tomorrow
[1:02:32] because somebody's gonna meet Jesus and
[1:02:34] the resurrection power is gonna be alive
[1:02:36] in their hearts in their lives he's
[1:02:38] asking you to believe tonight in the
[1:02:40] supernatural when everything is turning
[1:02:43] dark all the hell is against this little
[1:02:45] bra he said there will be alike he
[1:02:48] provided you a light in the end time and
[1:02:51] we got
[1:02:51] just enough light to see the bra through
[1:02:54] to eternity
[1:02:55] oh hell he can't put the light out of
[1:02:58] this bride Oh church the Bible says that
[1:03:01] we're going to do exploits daring feats
[1:03:05] notice we're not just surviving Laodicea
[1:03:09] oh no we're not just getting by hobros
[1:03:13] oh I I'm just you know what I understand
[1:03:16] what it's like to go through trials and
[1:03:17] tribulations Hornaday and what it's like
[1:03:19] to be stressed out and wore out and come
[1:03:21] home
[1:03:21] daily you just have your head your your
[1:03:23] head bowed down because the pressure of
[1:03:25] this world just begins to be so great
[1:03:26] but you know what it don't don't mean
[1:03:29] about three weeks ago during the shut-in
[1:03:31] I needed to shut in because then I'm
[1:03:34] closing right here
[1:03:35] I needed to shut in because I need a God
[1:03:38] to come and speak to me in a personal
[1:03:39] way I face trials I face tribulations I
[1:03:42] face situations on the job hey many of
[1:03:45] you know about I talk to it about a
[1:03:46] little a little bit but it just kept
[1:03:48] getting worse and worse and he just
[1:03:49] coming into work you know and we begin
[1:03:51] to watch the series on the chosen and
[1:03:53] I'm not here to advocate for that but if
[1:03:55] you hadn't seen it I'd encourage you to
[1:03:56] go see it so I guess I am advocating for
[1:03:58] it very good series on the life of
[1:04:01] Christ very good biblical great you know
[1:04:03] when we begin to look at that and you
[1:04:04] know I'm gonna count it and I deal with
[1:04:06] numbers on a daily basis see if for the
[1:04:08] hospital and I begin to hear this guy
[1:04:12] Dallas Jenkins begin to speak and how he
[1:04:14] he sought after one a career path and it
[1:04:18] failed in his face and God had to Humble
[1:04:20] him down and get him on his knees to
[1:04:22] reveal to him what he was going to do
[1:04:23] and he and he begin to start this series
[1:04:26] and writes his series on the chosen but
[1:04:28] God had to humble him he when he got to
[1:04:31] certain places during this series said
[1:04:33] he needed to finances in God the rest of
[1:04:35] his response to to Dallas Chingiz which
[1:04:37] is a biblical responses in the Book of
[1:04:39] Luke and maybe Matthew in a couple other
[1:04:41] chapters there but he says I need you to
[1:04:44] feed the 5,000 they wanted the disciples
[1:04:47] one of the Sydenham away because it was
[1:04:50] getting late and they hadn't been with
[1:04:51] Jesus three days and they had no food to
[1:04:53] feed him Jesus says what are you have he
[1:04:56] says we got a couple of fish in a few
[1:04:58] loaves here he says you bring me the
[1:05:00] fish and you bring me the loaves and
[1:05:02] I'll do the feeding of
[1:05:04] 5,000 let me tell you a church that's
[1:05:06] what I needed to hear
[1:05:07] it's not my responsibility to feed the
[1:05:09] 5,000 it's my responsibility he's your
[1:05:12] responsibility to bring the fishes and
[1:05:14] to bring the load you say brother do
[1:05:16] anything about money it's not about
[1:05:17] money but your fish tonight maybe your
[1:05:20] aim in your mouth tonight maybe your
[1:05:22] witness and your testimony if you'll
[1:05:25] just bring the fishes and you'll just
[1:05:26] bring the load gotta do the feeding of
[1:05:28] the 5,000 gotta pour out the place got a
[1:05:31] response to the heart of a believer how
[1:05:35] could I begin to ponder that thought I
[1:05:37] said God so you're telling me it's not
[1:05:40] my responsibility I got 400 and some
[1:05:45] employees depending on me to make the
[1:05:47] right decisions and I guess I just hear
[1:05:51] just reiterate back you just bring the
[1:05:54] fishes in the luvs you do what you got
[1:05:58] the best that you got you bring it to me
[1:06:01] and you ask and I'll show you what I'll
[1:06:05] do visit can I give you a quick
[1:06:07] testimony ISM you musician to stay there
[1:06:09] because you're all I got
[1:06:10] stay put until we're almost done so we
[1:06:16] find this copán 19 has had a drastic
[1:06:19] impact on hospital why it's Hospital
[1:06:21] cash Hospital revenues hospitals around
[1:06:23] the world right now around the nation
[1:06:26] excuse me in our country hospitals are
[1:06:28] closed and rural hospitals are closing
[1:06:29] like that every day hospital shutting
[1:06:32] the stores because rural hospital
[1:06:34] reimbursement is horrible just it's not
[1:06:36] there because the clientele the patient
[1:06:38] mixes it's just not there and I know I'm
[1:06:40] speaking over everybody's head but just
[1:06:41] let me to speak to this just for a few
[1:06:43] minutes
[1:06:44] and so our hospital is not not carved
[1:06:48] out of that I was thinking you know god
[1:06:49] you're gonna make me to see it for the
[1:06:50] hospital we're gonna be blessed it's
[1:06:52] gonna be great we're gonna be I mean I'm
[1:06:54] just thinking man because I'm there it's
[1:06:55] gonna be wonderful how a sorely
[1:06:59] disappointed God had to teach me a
[1:07:01] lesson and ain't about you but it's
[1:07:05] about you being faithful
[1:07:06] I told my wife I say that God has got to
[1:07:11] be sick and tired of hearing me pray
[1:07:13] about that Hospital but it's
[1:07:16] it's the trial that I've been in because
[1:07:18] I don't look at it is I can lose my job
[1:07:20] that's fine I'll find another one
[1:07:22] but there's $10 an hour $8 an hour
[1:07:25] employees maybe they won't find the job
[1:07:27] as easy as I could in our communities
[1:07:30] 400 of the name are depending on me to
[1:07:32] make the right decision not only that 13
[1:07:37] to 15 thousand people in our community
[1:07:39] are depending on us to make the right
[1:07:41] decision so that we can provide health
[1:07:43] care in this community because what
[1:07:45] happens when you got to get in an
[1:07:46] ambulance
[1:07:47] and you may not make a 45 minute drive a
[1:07:49] Shreveport you need a hospital and so
[1:07:54] the pressure just been looming on me
[1:07:55] Laura and we're gonna know how we're
[1:07:57] gonna pay bills cash is strapped we've
[1:07:59] all this kind of stuff and I was facing
[1:08:02] a payroll a couple weeks ago after
[1:08:06] watching that series at first Sears said
[1:08:08] okay you got this Lord and we prayed
[1:08:11] about it my family and I we prayed about
[1:08:13] it that night and I'm bringing the
[1:08:15] fishes and loaves you feed the 5,000 got
[1:08:20] there on Tuesday morning payrolls got to
[1:08:22] be done by Wednesday Cash's getting I'm
[1:08:24] checking the cash every day I know what
[1:08:25] it's gonna take to make the gross
[1:08:26] payroll the net payroll and would you
[1:08:29] believe we made up by $20,000 some who
[1:08:32] praise the Lord man god is good what God
[1:08:35] was testing my faith last week and we
[1:08:39] prayed again I said man we're we're were
[1:08:42] several hundreds of thousands of dollars
[1:08:44] away from making it god I don't know
[1:08:48] what to do and they just I woke up that
[1:08:51] morning honestly got a woke up that
[1:08:52] morning and I read it my devotion in the
[1:08:55] book of Matthew and he talked about
[1:08:57] bringing the fishes in the loaves you
[1:09:01] bring the fish in the lowest Alfie to
[1:09:03] five thousand I said okay god this was
[1:09:06] on a Tuesday morning got to work my
[1:09:10] controller email me I said what what
[1:09:13] what are we what's the shortfall because
[1:09:16] we were several hundred thousand dollars
[1:09:18] away from the knee before when this
[1:09:20] excuse me this is Wednesday morning and
[1:09:22] so she sent me the message and I was
[1:09:24] like Oh heartbeats
[1:09:26] we're $100,000 off and now honestly so
[1:09:33] god you said you would feed the five
[1:09:35] thousand if I did what was right but we
[1:09:37] prayed to by the committed it to you and
[1:09:40] so I'm scrambling around thing and what
[1:09:42] am I going to do to get this money so
[1:09:43] that people can get their paychecks and
[1:09:46] if anybody on the work is hearing this
[1:09:47] you have to forgive me but this is a
[1:09:49] testimony because God said I'll do it
[1:09:52] seething abundantly all that you can ask
[1:09:54] her thing so now I'm emailing the
[1:10:01] corporate lady the payroll lady I said
[1:10:03] okay this is where we are let me know
[1:10:05] when you get to a number and I know what
[1:10:08] this number normally is and I know where
[1:10:10] I'm sitting in the cash reserves I'm
[1:10:11] thinking this is gonna be a fun
[1:10:13] Wednesday
[1:10:15] my brother Timothy priests kind of be
[1:10:18] certain of God in uncertain times and
[1:10:22] I've listened to that message to be
[1:10:23] certain to God multiple times even when
[1:10:26] he remains silent you still got to
[1:10:28] believe he's God and that he hears so
[1:10:32] him about three o'clock rolled around
[1:10:34] she finally emailed me says here's your
[1:10:37] number and I was like okay so I sent it
[1:10:43] to my controller I said how closer we
[1:10:45] are how far over now here's the final
[1:10:47] number she sent me back she said we made
[1:10:50] payroll by five thousand dollars if he
[1:10:56] can feed the five thousand he can do it
[1:10:59] seeding abundantly above all that we can
[1:11:03] ask and above all that we can think
[1:11:06] because he's still God he knows your
[1:11:10] situation he knows about the quarantine
[1:11:13] he knows the trials that you were facing
[1:11:15] before this but he also knows what you
[1:11:19] have need of and he's just waiting on
[1:11:21] you to ask
[1:11:22] oh that's just very father lord I thank
[1:11:27] you tonight we felt your presence here
[1:11:29] maybe the service went a little bit
[1:11:30] different than I expected but father I
[1:11:34] sure enjoyed being in your presence she
[1:11:37] would joy being under your anointing
[1:11:39] tonight
[1:11:40] and just allowing you to use the vessel
[1:11:43] I just trust Lord that the words would
[1:11:45] fall on fertile ground whoever he may
[1:11:49] just be a handful tonight but I felt
[1:11:51] like his brother Timothy said the first
[1:11:53] night he'd done this he was preaching to
[1:11:54] thousands I know what every time I would
[1:11:57] look into a camera I can just visualize
[1:11:59] faces different individuals brother Ron
[1:12:03] for the jewels sister Shalom brother
[1:12:06] Mickey for the Vernon the Hollis family
[1:12:09] my mother law in the situation she's
[1:12:11] facing my parents in their situation and
[1:12:15] I see these things just come to mind my
[1:12:20] god you said in your word it's not our
[1:12:26] responsibility to bring your word to
[1:12:30] pass it's our responsibility to trust
[1:12:33] you and obey it's how responsibility
[1:12:37] tonight as a believer to take you with
[1:12:39] your word and to believe tonight so all
[1:12:44] hell may be against us darkness is
[1:12:46] looming all around us yet father two
[1:12:50] people that know their God will do
[1:12:52] exploits and they'll be strong I just
[1:12:56] prayed tonight father you'll take the
[1:12:58] message and you'll you just allow it to
[1:13:00] just encourage the believer and elevate
[1:13:03] their faith I pray God for a
[1:13:06] supernatural time now in our homes Lord

[1:13:34] will be open again in our our state and
[1:13:38] our local government and our nation will
[1:13:40] do away with the restrictions kind of
