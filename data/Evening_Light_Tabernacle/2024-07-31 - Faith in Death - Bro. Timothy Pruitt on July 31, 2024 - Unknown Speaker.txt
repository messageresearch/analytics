certainly been heavy on our hearts and brother Tony was a very dear dear brother and we don't weep as those that have no hope but it does leave a hole and it leaves a void and I think one of the first

heart it doesn't matter if you're running the video playing music if you just want to take a few moments we often say turn around and greet your neighbor but out of just some sincerity if you just

today Lord Lord just placing Our Lives in Your Hands father knowing you've called us for these moments of Life closing times of civilization Lord as it's been known for thousands of years lord it's going to break forth from Mortal life into immortality we've been chosen to be the last Runners the the anchor leg on these in this race of life God we want to look back and say I've done my best I gave everything that I could I I I put everything that I had into it to run the race that was set before me Lord we commit this service to you everything to be said and done For Your Glory ask Lord you bring strength to our hearts and lives Lord as we Face the coming days Lord and the situation that we're in Father you know every heart you know every life affected Lord I I've never seen a death Lord that life didn't come from I've never seen a seed planted in the ground that fruit didn't come from it and Lord as we're looking to plant a body in the ground we know there's Life coming from it Lord Hearts that'll be touched Hearts that'll see you Lord in power of the resurrected Jesus Christ we love you now and give you thanks in Jesus name amen amen let's turn to the Book of Psalms chapter 23 we read it last week but just like to read it again I actually had some other things I was looking at today or this week earlier this week but in light of what has happened and then today some other thoughts begin begin to think on things and amen the uh seriousness of life these things begin to well up inside of me so I just like to share some things as as we go into this Psalms 23 and verse one it says the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name sake yeay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen God bless you you can be seated I'd like to speak to you tonight on faith and death brother brandom mentions this passage of scripture and I want to just key in on Psalms 23 and verse4 yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death he says many times I've heard people quoting the 23rd psalm and saying though I walk through the Dark Shadows of the Valley of Death he said if you'll notice it isn't the Dark Shadows is the shadow dark isn't in it the shadow of the valley of death now it could not be dark and yet have a shadow for there has to be a certain percentage of light before there can be a shadow if it's perfectly dark there would be no shadow in it I I can test to that I was in a cave one time and very dark and they turned off the lights there was nothing but Blackness there wasn't a shadow there wasn't a hint of a shadow was nothing but Darkness so if it's perfectly dark there's no shadow in it so yay though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death now there has to be enough light to make a Shadow if it was dark my shadow would not be on this pull pit but being there's a light then it makes a shadow so the death so death is dark in a certain way but it's only a shadow the Valley of the shadow of death there has to be a certain amount of light in death to make a Shadow aren't you happy to that that's so that there's light in the valley amen that's the key to the whole thing there's light in the valley sometime so he says someday we're all coming down to that way friends every one of us are on our road there tonight each time our heart beats is one last time that it'll ever beat again it's just got so many beats as it goes to make this journey it'll make his last beat one of these days so then we got to go down through that shadow of death but we're happy that we have been promised that the Morning Star will meet us there to light up that Valley amen and give us light to cross that River amen and I I'm thankful for that because you know death is it it looks like a a great dark thing and surely it is a veil that is there and and honestly if death wasn't there in the darkness of death we would do everything we could to go over on the other side but there's that thing called Death that is is dark and it's it's scary at times but to a Believer we're not afraid of death because our God has already conquered it he's already came down and gave his life and and showed us that death now no longer has any sting it has no longer any Victory am man he brought death back to life again again and it showed that he has the power of resurrection and but I want to just kind of go down this thought and for a moment says we're mindful of someday when death is going to chill our bodies maybe tonight we're if we're not prepared maybe we're prepared maybe we'll go ahead and prepare to meet that hour when death comes to our room to take us from this life to the one that is beyond maybe we can come to it with joy come on now not with sadness but with joy and faith knowing that we know him who said I am the resurrection and the life amen so a Believer does not come to death and sadness but he comes to death and joy knowing when his last breath is out of this body amen he's entered into a place that we can't hardly describe with human tongue or human intellect amen the Bible says words cannot even say what a Waits we can we we don't we don't have the abilities to be able to speak about what it's like and the body that away you know I thought about I've been thinking about that today as we know brother Tony took his last breath there out there on on a job and and just that last moment coming from breathing this breath and then stepping from this moment in this Mortal body and a in a body that was 55 and speaking to his wife he had the normal aches and pains and things that he was going through but he fell there upon the ground breathing that last breath but his next breath was in a body that knew no pain it was in a body that knew no sin brother Tony at one time had sin in his life and lived a very sinful life and God came on the scene and moved in him but he moved into a place he knew no more sin any longer there there was no more fear any longer there was no more worry no more dread and then I believe that's how we should all look at this as we don't come to this place with with sorrow as those who have no hope but we have a hope that's beyond the grave amen we're not planting the seed this week of brother Tony's body Amen in the grave mour and never to see him again never to know what is what happens never but we know as we plant that seed that seed has a promise upon it that that seed is going to come back to life again because he is the resurrection of the life but you know God knowing and seeing how fragile we are we're very fragile you know you you say well I'm just I'm a teenager I I got big I'm working on my muscles but you're still a very fragile person where humanity is fragile human bodies are fragile knowing that what we're walking while we're walking on this brittle thread of life I like how brother Bram describes that he said we're fragile bodies walking on a brittle thread of life this Mortal life not knowing what time we're going to be summoned to answer on high let us oh Lord lay aside everything in our hearts and that's what you know I think it ought to call us all to a moment cuz never none of us know what our time will be we don't know sure we all have faith to believe that we're going to see a about body change and we're going to be one of those that are alive and remain but we don't know what God has chosen for us but we want to be living our life not carrying around bitterness and fears and and and complexes and things that has no value and allowing them to weigh us down and tear us down and not be ready for that moment when we meet our Lord that moment when we draw our last breath James 4: 13 says like this he says go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue There year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanish away for that you ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that amen if the Lord will that's where we get it Lord willing Lord willing I'll be there amen it comes from this scripture if the Lord will we're going to do that because if he's not willing we're not going to do that amen but if the Lord willing it for us to be there to do this or to do that because we know amen any moment we could draw our last breath any moment we could say our last words and thinking on that thought what would we want our last words to be come on amen I know it's a very serious moment and it's very serious kind of checking up for a moment because you know brother I I would hope it would be said about me that that morning I ate my breakfast and I read this and I read the Bible and I talked about the Lord and I prayed for this one that one amen I wouldn't want it to be that my last breath was a word to my wife that we is in a you know in a bad disagreement or fussing at my children or this that and the other amen we got to be very careful because we don't know the moment God's going to call us home amen so you know it's just like I heard this story this man that was was on his way to town and it was back before cars and he was walking into the town and he come by his friend's house and and his friend says where you going he said I'm going to town he says you mean you're going to the town Lord willing he said I don't care if the Lord's willing or not I'm going to town so along the way he gets down and waves a little bit and he gets he gets he gets beat by some robbers jumps out of the bushes and they beat him half to death and they take everything that he has and he comes back across in front of the neighbor's house and he's dragging one leg and he's all tore to pieces and neighbor sitting there said where you going he said I'm going to the house Lord willing amen we don't know what the Lord Wills but we want to be in his will amen we want him to be directing our lives and and and and directing us our every moment he says it just goes to show that we are here today and tomorrow we're not here we don't know when when the time comes when it's coming but we know it's coming and he said I was thinking about this life is a great thing life is an opportunity yes sir amen it's an opportunity to live the best life and what is the best life it's not millions of dollars in the bank and vacation after vacation and this that oh that's the life no the best life the opportunity that we have is to live a life for Jesus Christ amen to live for him with everything that we have every moment every moment of Our Lives ought to be centered around the Lord Jesus Christ and I believe it's a call in our church and as we face this moment to say Lord if there's something in me that I can tighten up let me tighten it up if it's in your will for me to do this let me do it Lord willing amen that you will guide every part of my life and I will allow you to guide every part of my life because we want to be one of those that have a testimony as we have went through some of the people of Faith there the Believers of faith in Hebrews chap 11 amen it brings it all the way down to Hebrews chap 11 and verse 13 it says these all died in faith see I'll probably ever say it again but I'll say it now death that we have had had to this week is not a new thing it's been going on since the fall as we know death there's not a man yet other than our Lord Jesus Christ and he I and a few others but all the others had to go through death amen they had to come to this place they had to had to have that Reckoning in their life to come to this moment and I want to be have a testimony if God chooses to take me Amen on this side of it without before the Rapture I want to have the testimony that I died in faith amen not having and they they died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them far off and were persuaded of them embrac them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such thing declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from which they come out they may have had opportunity to return but now they desire a better country come on now this is what he's talking about Abraham Abraham left a country and if his desires were still for that country he would have had an opportunity to go back that's right amen you know this is the world that we're living in Satan wants us so so driven by this world and the things of this world and if you have your mind and your desires upon it you will have an opportunity to go back but if your desires is on a better country I believe we live as far as human beings in one of the greatest countries that's ever been on the face of the Earth amen the freedoms we enjoy but I'm I'm telling you there's a better country that's right there's a better land there's a place of real Freedom there's a place of real joy as a place of real happiness a better country that is a Heavenly country wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city amen I I want to be a prepared people for a prepared place yes sir this is what he said in John 14 and verse one he says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and and you know I know the world gets that idea of mansions that it's gold doorknobs and and big buildings and big structures and stuff but the Mansion he's not speaking about is not a mansion a building it's talking about a mansion a body I believe I got a mansion that's about this tall come on you might be 4ot tall want to be 5 foot tall but God wants you to be 4ot tall amen he he got you a body somewhere amen it's so he said I'm going to go prepare a place and and I think think about that brother Tony left here but God had already prepared him a place god listen it may have shocked us but this did not Shock God it may have astounded us when we got the new news and how this happen or what going on what's going you know things turned upside down real quickly but God was never shocked he saw it coming he knew the moment it was going to take place and he already prepared him a body he already prepared him a place and this is why he said let not your heart be troubled I'm going to prepare you place you're going to need a way out of here so I'm going to prepare it for I'm so thankful God's already taking care of it oh yeah Hallelujah he's already got a place for me that when I take my last breath it's going to go into another's place so much better a better country honestly brother Tony I'm a little bit jealous amen because the things that they're experiencing every chance I get every chance I get to talk to someone that's about to cross over I said you go tell them there's a people ready to come amen there's a people that's still believing there's a people that's still yet holding on there's a people that's going to step from this body into another body I go to prepare a place for you and I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am ye may be also red letter words so I don't care what the devil tries to do about it God's going to come back and receive us to himself that where he is we will be also there going to be a people that's going to be believing in God right down to the last moments sure there's going to be millions that walk away and millions deny him and millions Say It Ain't So and millions say it's just a myth but there's going to be somebody that's standing there waiting for him when he returns Hallelujah Faith no matter what we Face even in death we're going to believe amen we're not the first ones to face loss neither will be the will we be the last we're not the first ones to lose a dad or a mom unexpectantly neither will we be the last but we will respond in faith believ yet this Mortal body pass away we have an immortal body that is prepared for us that we can step into and never go back to sin again never go back to fear again never go have another mind battle again never get sick [Applause] again it's not a myth it's a reality he said in Romans 8 and verse 28 it's been quoted already we know that all things work together all things sicknesses that that goes in all things right trials that goes in all things problems that we face yeah that's in all things all is a pretty powerful three-letter word I said it before but it's amazing how how how it encompasses so much three letters all things work together for the good to them that love God to them that are the called according to his purpose death is in all things sure we can't see it that for our own good sometimes and we wonder well did I have faith or did I did did I did I hold did did did I did I pray right did I did I have something wrong somewhere what happened all things I I'm here to say one thing the devil is not greater than God the devil can't touch a hair of our head unless God allows it to happen brother Brandon was dealing with this with a little mother that her baby had died in Germany and her husband was a a a Chaplin and he he could he couldn't get there very quickly but they called him and and asked him to come and and she was declaring I know and they were declaring I know that God's going to raise up my little baby and called brother brother brandom said you know pray for him I know God's going to raise it up he said well let me go pray and I went and prayed prayed all that afternoon that night he said sometimes you think don't doctors don't believe but he said let me show you he said you know she she had already give the doctor my book to read that's called the Propet visits South Africa or visits Africa something like that and she said God will raise my baby up God will raise my baby up and that was their confession and the baby had been dead now four or five hours or so and they got word to the father down at the base where he was stationed he had to fly in and baby had been dead died in the night and the doctor said all right you believe said all right I tell you what I'll do I'll slip over and turn the oxygen back on and he let that baby lay there for two days with oxygen turned on waiting and I was over here praying and they was going to fly me across in the Jet and I could leave here in an army jet and be back the same day to Germany one one morning about daylight I got up and my wife went out of the room and when she went out I just waking up and I was laying there for a little bit and something came into the room I looked up there something moving and I jumped up and I said Lord what would you have your servant know and a voice spoke and saido not rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord so I got her on the phone I said no God has called your baby home and when she come over to see us said what was it brother brandom was my faith weak I thought thought I had faith I said you had great faith you prayed for your baby and your husband prayed for your baby you held on to God to raise that baby but he refused to do it because he knows what is best he knows what is best and still you love him anyway Hallelujah that's real faith that when God said say no y you still love him yes amen this is where brother brandom even came to in his own in his own life with his baby Sharon Rose and his wife dying he said he went down there he like Lord don't take my baby don't take my baby and just my let me let me die and he said a black sheep come down and he said and he said of course the devil came to me and said think about all the things you've done for him and now he's going to turn his back on you and he said here I was in this he said but something down deep rose up in me and said though God slay me yet I will trust him and he said and he there PL many places he talks about it and he said it was to the place if God sends me to hell I'll still love him that's real Faith amen faith when You Face death that When God says no you still love him am you still trust him and you still say God knows best this is where he what he said he said he God knows best still you love him that's real Faith anybody when mountains are moving can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you prove whether you got faith or not many have crossed over the great sea Jordan River is is referred to The Divide he said I've watched them come down to the end of the road and buried many as sure as there's a God in heaven I believe if I will live true to him someday in a better land I'll be with him again so that's the main thing so that's the main thing after all what is life we just don't know how long it's going to last just might be gone this afternoon might might be our last time together do you know that but whether it is or whether it isn't we can't lose that's right Hallelujah whether it is the last time together or whether it isn't we can't lose there's no way for a Christian to lose you just can't lose no matter what there's no loss in Christianity if I live I gain if I die I gain well I say I die I can't die as long as I have eternal life in me I can never die there's no such a thing as death to a Christian it's not one scripture in the Bible that tells you a Christian dies very much contrary they're all alive Jesus said he that believeth on me hath everlasting life how can it have an end if it's got everlasting life he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me ha everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but has passed from Death to life we cannot die we cannot cease to exist we will always be that's right oh but that ain't the same with you Old Devil that's right that ain't the same with you cancer that ain't the same with you any kind of disease you want to name any kind of complex you want to that ain't the same with you you you have an expiration date but as for me I will not cease to exist I am Eternal as God is eternal you as Eternal as God is eternal so when cancer is gone and every disease is gone and problems is gone and heart troubles is gone we will still be shouting the victory over everything including death hallu there'll never be a time let me go back there was a time when you was nothing but there will never be a time but what you'll be something somewhere you're going to be somewhere from this all through his ceaseless ages all eternity so now just think about it sometimes When Trials get hard we hit we hit snags in life like everybody does listen Christians are not the only ones that hit snags in life some hard trials we had to pull hard to get through it he said but when I'm up against it I just think on this what difference does it make the Bible said all things work together for the good that love him is that right so maybe it's for my good I just go right ahead and take it anyhow there's nothing can bother you even death itself can't bother you when death comes the old Apostle when he was building a scaffold out there to cut his head off he looked out there and said death where is thy sting grave where is thy Victory grave said well I'll have you after a while the Apostle said what can you do to me I just cuz I'll point you over to Y to Jesus Christ who broke all the bands and Rose up again how are you going to hold me death said I'll make you squeak I'll make you holler show me where you can do that the only thing I know that God did to death he harnessed it to a buggy the only thing he can do is pull a Believer right into the presence of God hallelujah so what's going what's he going to do he cannot hurt us we haven't got nothing to worry about he said you know the little story I told about death having no Stinger Satan wasn't sure when Jesus was on Earth if he was really the son of God see him standing there Satan come to him said well if you perform these Miracles if you'll do this if you'll do that you you know Bow Down and Worship me or turn this Stone into bread he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God you know and so he took him up and said see all the kingdoms he said he showed him the United States he showed him all the all the kingdoms of the earth he says Bow Down and Worship me and you'll have them Jesus said get behind me Satan cuz he knew he was going to fall air to every one of it anyhow finally when they got him down one day and they took a rag and put around his face he said I imagine it was old dirty scarf pulled it around his head beating bleeding and hurting morning cold wind blowing they already whipped him blood running down his shoulders they threw something around him that blood sticking to his back he's sitting there in the crown of thorns over his face blood and spit from the soldiers all over his face sitting there what an awful sight to look at oh God you say if I'd been there I'd done something about it he said well why don't you do something about it now you've done the same thing that you'll do then now that you'll do then when he was sitting there mocked up and spitting mocked at and spit on there was disciples standing back said oh my could it been could have done this that man could have called a man dead man from the grave and look at him there but he they failed to see what was taking place in scriptures the blood and the spit was on his face and the rag upon his eyes and they you know they tell me he's a spiritual prophet and a discerner let's hit him and let him tell us who hit him they got a stick and hit him on top of the head with it if you're a prophet tell us who hit you he never opened his mouth he just sat there Satan said well you know that can't be God but he was faithful even in death the same thing you know denominations say that bunch of hly rollers that can't be God that can't be God moving there that can't be that's mental telepathy that's fortune tell that's this that and the other so they started up the hill and they put a robe around him the only clothes he ever had I guess when he was a man put it over his back and and there was little spots on his coat but as he went up the hill dragging him bumping that old cross and his little frail body going along whipping him everything else and it bumpy bump bumpy bump and his shoulders rubbing he'd stagger and he'll continue then spots got bigger and bigger to after a while they become one big red spot and old Satan said that couldn't be God how could that be God he's just a man he's just putting on he just put on I I I'll sting him and I just like I did everybody else if he was God he couldn't die so I'll sting him and see about like that I'll give him a try so when he got him on the cross he sucked that stinger in him and when he did he lost his Stinger there was more to that man than what he thought that man was God said and he said that's the reason he said oh death Paul said oh death where is your sting he had lost it that's right he said just as a Bee once stings deep it can't sting no more the bee is finished then he said this bee of death doesn't have no Stinger no more and Paul would scream out oh death where is your sting grave said I'll get you Paul I'll swallow you up I'll canker your body I'll rot you away oh grave where is your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ death has lost his sting I fought a good fight I finished my course I have kept the faith yes sir henceforth as laid up for me a crown of righteousness that the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day and not only me but all who love his appearing chop now on if you want to death you can't hurt me any [Applause] longer you can look in that grave he said go ahead grave destroy that body go ahead grave turn it into dust go ahead your bunch of maggots turn it into dust but Jesus Christ is the resurrection and the life you can take me down to a graveyard you can lay my body down but one of these days going to hear the trumpet sound and what was nothing but a handful of Ashes will take form again in a body but it won't be that same old Tony that we knew won't see be that same old Caren that ragged body we saw where her buried in I didn't even recognize her laying there in the caset death had so destroyed her body it won't be that same it'll be a perfect body Perfect Teeth perfect hair perfect perfect h a perfect house amen yeah it might not be nothing but a spoonful of Ashes but on that day death won't have no hold on that body on that day that body will rise up and we can declare as they did about those they died in faith so is Gerald sha died in faith cam PR died in faith Tony Adams died in faith and one day they're going to raise by the power of almighty God he says Chop on now grave Chop on death if you want to that's the real Christian Spirit that's right look death right in the eyes so you can't hold me even death itself doesn't worry you in when you're in the Lord he rose from the dead we don't worry about that death comes like the little sister was speaking about there if it's time to go let's go what do you do change this old V carcass that we got for an immortal one made like his own glorious body who wouldn't change for that come on now if all you had on you tonight was a bunch of rags and somebody offered you a new suit of clothes for free would you take it well if God offered you a new body would you take it he said who wouldn't make that exchange tell me somebody that would older person young person no matter if you're only 15 years old 12 whatever it is death May lays right at at your door you don't know what time that human heart that beats like this has got to stop someday it might stop when you're 10 years old 12 years old it does it by the thousands every day but in here in this body we're going to exchange it for the blood that don't pulsate it the Holy Spirit Will pulsate it amen it can't die it's Immortal Eternal it'll never die again yes sir the Lord so when death comes to our door and he screams out glory to God well that's kind of a odd deal right I mean when death comes to our door we want to cry and we do we sorrow but here brother brand said when death comes to our door glory to God as long as God's requirement the blood's been placed on the Lin of my heart post what difference does it make it can't bother me if the doctor says you're going to die tomorrow what difference does it make the blood's on the post you got to die anyhow but if the blood's been applied I've got a Resurrection coming amen so I I I was looking at these things second Peter 1 10 says wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall think it's a time that we look at our lives it's a good time to examine just say Lord what about me am I am I where I need to be then when it's written about me if I go be by the grave that he died in faith cuz God is the God of all our days from the first breath to the last breath and all that's in between he is the God of all of it I want to read to you a Psalms i i i this moved me so much today Psalms 139 I'm going to read from the passion translation says Lord you know everything that is to know about me you perceive every moment of my heart and soul and you understand my every thought before it even enters my mind wow you're so intimately aware of me Lord you read my heart like an open book and you know all the words I'm about to speak before I even start a sentence you know every step I take before my journey even begins you've gone into my future to prepare my way Hallelujah amen you've gone into my future to prepare my way and in kindness you follow behind me so he's in your future but he's also behind you amen he in kindness you follow behind me to spare me from the harm of my past so God is Not only concerned about your future he's keeping the past back amen than you Lord he's a goet for your future and a goet for your past listen if I don't make a Methodist shout I don't know what will if it to make somebody like that shout it ought to make us shout tonight that God is not only the god of my future but he's also the God who stands between me and my past that's right my past sins there's a bloodline there that's right you have laid your hand on me this is just too wonderful and deep and incomprehensible your understanding of me brings me wonder and strength where can I go from your spirit where can I run and hide from your face if I go up to heaven you're there if I go down to the Realms of the Dead you're there too if I fly with the wings Into The Shining Dawn you're there if I fly to the r into the radiant Sunshine you're there waiting Wherever I Go your hand will guide me and your strength will Empower me it is impossible to disappear from you or ask the darkness to hide me for your presence is everywhere bringing light into my night there is no such thing as Darkness with you the night to you is as bright as the day there's no difference between the two you form my innermost being shaping my delicate inside and my intricate outside and wo them all together in my mother's womb I thank you God for making me so mysteriously complex everything you do is marvelously breathtaking it simply amazes me to think about it how thorough thoroughly you know me Lord you even formed every bone in my body when you created me in the secret place carefully carefully you shaped me from nothing into something you saw me when you created me to be before I became me before I'd ever seen the light of day the number of days you planned for me and were already recorded in your book every single moment you are thinking of me how precious and wonderful to consider that you cherish me constantly in your ever thought oh God your desires toward me are more than the grains of the sand on every Shore and when I wake each morning you're still with me we're living in the shadows of the coming of the Lord what can you promise yourself what can Any Nation promise there's not a promise left nothing is left there's chaos in everything there is nothing this way you can see or nothing that way you can see that has hope the only thing that has hope is to look this way to look up every promise in the word is true some Glorious Day Jesus is going to come and all these things will be taken away and Christ will reign isn't it a wonderful hope to know that these old frail fragile bodies we're living in and these little brittle threads of life that we're walking on someday will give away and every Mortal will that's turning will stop and we'll take a trip to Zion's Hill to live in the presence of God forever like a new man and a new woman young and a splendor of Youth to be that way forever the young will be old there forever transformed in a moment of time Immortal shall shine in his likeness the stars and the sun to outshine what a glorious Assurance we have of this because God's Eternal Word who has been true to all ages has promised it to every believer so what have we got to worry about not a thing but just be happy about it all cuz he knows us he's numbered our days he knows exactly what we're going through and where we're at he said I know that sitting before me like every Mortal here tonight is a great big black big black door and every time the heart beats you're going one step closer to it it's called death and one time your heart beats that's one time less it'll beat again we're going that way I don't know when it's going to stop but when I enter there I don't want to go like a coward hello somebody I don't want to go like a coward I want to wrap myself in his righteousness and enter into that channel of death knowing this that I'm persuaded I know him in the power of his resurrection for he has resurrected me from a life of sin and he's made me his servant and I know him that way and I know when he calls I will come out of the grave I want that as my testimony you know another place he says when Moses had failed and moved from Moses to Joshua and Joshua sees the pillar of fire move and he says come on children we're on our road he brought them up to the side of Jordan he said when I think of that how beautiful he said now before we cross over we'll get a couple spies to go over know how Rahab and all of that said like the other night talking about the red streak she her red cord she put there and it saved her house hold and all the walls fell but her part because there was that red cord on their door like like the other night we talking about the death angel he said coming through is there a red streak on your door before this great shaking comes he said now once more will I shake the Earth but I will shake the heavens and we but we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken we're living in such a great power he said but I see Joshua the young leader and God meets him and he says don't get scared now my servant Moses is dead but rise and go over this Jordan no man all the days of your life better stand before you as I was with Moses so I'll be with you fear not be strong and very courageous my I can see that old Warrior walking down there little humble fell he called all Israel together and looked over Jordan it was a month of harvest and the Snows were melting and the river was roaring I seen Joshua and now he's standing there how he's going to get across look they didn't have Bridges they didn't have no arches they didn't have material to build anything wood steel nothing in those days they didn't have they didn't have nothing but Joshua looked across that M muddy Jordan and he looked back there and seen those thousands and tens of thousands of Jews waiting and he said God Will Make A Way and if God promis it God will keep his promise and he goes on he says Joshua standing there looking around he says oh my we're going to stand there too one of these days we're going to stand at the end of the road you might be healthy tonight friend there may might be nothing wrong with you but one of these days the doctor will be in your room and say there's nothing else can be done that pulse will be slipping up the sleeve those youthful days are gone something struck the doctor says there's nothing sorry she's a young woman young boy old or young whatever it don't matter there's nothing can be done walking out of the room you'll feel the cold Vapors of death floating down into the room and that old Jordan muddy will look muddy and rough but may you be as Josh UA he looked sitting back there on the hill he looked in there he said there's an ark of Covenant that go between he had something that would go between him and the flood something between him and the trouble and tonight we also have an arc and it's Christ Jesus who stands between us and death some of these days when the last breath is leaving my body I want to run down that River and say give away Jordan I'm going over to see my Lord I believe in the Morning Star will come out and light up the Valley of the shadow of death and a light up the way and the Holy Ghost will stretch two glossy Wings across that Jordan and will bury our weary souls to a better land amen yes Lord hallelujah oh yes he says my brother I'm no boy no more I'm a middle-aged man and one of these days I got to come to the end of the road and if I go like most brandom's Harvey's when they get old they kind of get shaky hope he lets me stay to the end but when I come down to the end of the road I hope an old gray-headed man gray whiskers leaning on the staff and when I hear the old Jordan waves dancing around everywhere I know the time has come I want to beh holding in my hand a sword that's right I want to turn and look down through a lifetime of ministry and see every Brier patch I come through and every Hill I took and when it's done I want to take that old sword and stick it back in the sheath of Eternity and take off the helmet of salvation and kneel on the bank and say God push out the Lifeboat I'm coming home if I'm faithful to my savior to his guiding hand I'll cling he'll guide me over death's r River Heaven's new sweet song I will sing let's byow our hearts faith in death I want to be holding a sword I have fought the good fight I have kept the faith may we all be guilty of that looking back and seeing all the heels we took all the Brier patches we come through the trials and the things we went through the sicknesses we look back then we'll be able to take that sword put it into the sheath of Eternity then we can take our helmets off off then we can take off our breastplates then we can lay our armor down then we can rest but until then let's keep fighting I don't know who all we will have to lay down in the grave but let's keep fighting cuz we know there's a promise that is greater than the grave and one day and I don't think it's going to be very long actually we're some of the lucky ones if you can say it that way we don't have long to wait coming down to the closing of time if I could hear Brother Tony's voice today in the choir he'd be screaming out it's worth it press on I never knew there would be so grander so much grander and so great I never knew could never understand but now I have eyesight real eyesight now I can see things as they really are press on wonder how many just take for a moment these moments say Lord I want to make my call in an election sure Lord if I need to have more sincerity Lord I Want More sincerity I I I just
