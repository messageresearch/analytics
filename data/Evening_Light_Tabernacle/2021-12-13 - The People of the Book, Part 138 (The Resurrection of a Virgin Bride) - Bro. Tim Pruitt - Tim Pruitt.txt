want to see not one person fail to make it your little bride around the world i pray that you'll stir their hearts lord you'll turn them lord back to faith again to believe in lord may our hearts lord burn within us today because you step out and walk with us talk with us reveal yourself as we read the word lord will you just open it to us in our understanding i stand here as just a mere mortal i can do nothing in myself lord with the little education i got i can read this scripture but then it'll take you father to anoint the word lord send it right like an arrow to his mark i pray to your father that you'll do it lord you know the needs that different ones have and situations in their lives there's some needs a real answer from you today i pray oh god that you'll answer that request within their heart you know the needs of your children lord and you care we don't believe father that you just went away and after sending a message so wonderful so perfect so vindicated opened the eyes the blind healed the sick cast out devils raised the dead did all the miraculous to draw our attention just to our hearts and then just go back into heaven and forget it all we believe that you're here lord we see you moving in our midst lord we know god you're breaking chains that you're opening the eyes of the blind and you're setting prisoners free lord that that the spirit of the lord is upon us anointing us oh god to bring words of life to your people that will set them free to serve the living god now i pray father that you'll anoint us today let your word go forth in power lord don't let me get in the flesh i don't want to be in the flesh i want to be in the spirit don't let me say things lord out of my own my own vindictiveness or some way that i i shouldn't have lord but may it be out of love and out of concern and out of out of standing for righteousness in this evil day as i said lord anoint my lips to speak and give us hearing ears lord because somebody's got to hear what the spirit says to the church and i believe lord needs a spirit is speaking expressly lord so speak today oh god may we be like isaiah in the temple and say lord speak my lord here i am i to answer thee take the cold from the altar touch our lips touch our ears touch our understanding purge us lord and cleanse us in your presence meet the needs of your children we ask in jesus name as we commit this service to you now lord before us is the word of god we will read it with reverence with honor respect we will stand lord as we read it as one would honor the flag of the united states and of their country we will stand in honor to the word of god because that's who our allegiance to and today we pledge our allegiance to the word of god to which it stands lord for the body of christ that you've given around the world we surrender ourselves to you father and all that we are in jesus name and father if i fail to tell you i love you i want you to know i love you with all my heart and i'm here lord to serve you today i thank you for the salvation [Music] thank you for caring for me i thank you for your love to your children so minister to our hearts today may it be lord today the bridegroom that speaks to his bride tells her once again that she's chosen ordained called for purpose and lord you define to us what you want us to be we will not be like israel of all and say just tell us and we'll do it because we can't put your holy spirit in us so we can because it's only by the power of the holy ghost that we can live a christian life it's in jesus name we ask it amen amen god bless you good to be in the house of the lord this morning thank you for coming for being here for being a part with us and pray praying the lord will bless you in a special way today and honor his word as we read it together amen thank you amen let's turn to ephesians chapter 5 and verse 22 and i ask for your prayers today i hope you have been praying for me as we approach the services that we can you know find the very mind of god and to speak on some things there's some things here that i have been pondering on and thinking about and actually has been laying in my heart for now for probably the last year or better and um and and actually i could actually go back to the starting of this series on the people of the book and even some of the prayers that i prayed while i was is at israel and at shiloh and i'm praying for the barren women the barren church and um because there's got to be somebody in this day that brings forth jesus christ back to the earth we have perpetuated the ages as it was coming down through seven we can't go any further there's no more and you know some will say well we're now in in the bright age the this laodicean age is the bright age that's what the message produced was a bright age a place where there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish so ephesians 5 22 is where we'll begin reading this morning and um so we will speak some things today and i i don't want to just come across harsh or dogmatic or as you know some vindictive way i want to say a lot some things in the spirit of love but um i i pray that that the love of god will help correct us and keep us on on the straight and narrow path as the body of christ i speak to you as a congregation and i speak to those around the world who are listening in as well and maybe the bride of christ wherever you are be touched today by the word ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the lord for as the husband is ahead of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore is the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as christ also love the church and gave himself for it notice now the purpose of him giving himself his own blood shedding his life dying on the cross was that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so i want men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself god bless you you can be seated i'm going to be speaking today on the resurrection of a virgin bride and we're going to we're going to deal quite a bit with the virginity of the church and what she has been prepared and called for in this age in this time now in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and god had a very special reason and purpose for the earth and that was that he might put his life upon it and in fact the matter is it would be that heaven would come down in the form of a paradise and and there god would reproduce himself in his sonship and was in a son of god which would be in his likeness so we could look upon the earth that god created the earth as a womb where god's seed could be manifested within the earth god by his word he planted seeds of life he commanded let the earth bring forth grass and their herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and he brought up bird life animal life and told each to be fruitful and multiply and and uh and the womb of the earth again brought forth life and then he brooded upon the earth and brought as we said heaven down to earth in as a eden a paradise and god ultimately brought a man in his own image from the dust from the womb of the earth and this man was made to portray god's image and his likeness so you know so then that he would prograde god's image and likeness he god had a a a bigger plan than just adam and eve but he wanted a family these were to be the first of a of a race of a god race and of course we we know in order to do this that uh god would not only want to express himself and and his fatherhood but he would also want to express himself in his sonship and so you know as he did he would make man to portray god's image and his likeness so then and then and portraying his likeness i want to get this thought to you that out of this man would come a woman and and as the earth was to be the womb for seeds of life so was the woman to be the womb for life but there was another suitor as you know in the story of redemption a deceiver a slicker who also he wanted a wound you see he wanted to be god and he wanted to be worshipped also and he wanted to reproduce himself but having no life within himself he could only do this by a perverted life by perverting the life that god had already placed upon the earth and so he doesn't work on me you know go and start working on mars and juniper or um our jupiter or our venus or some metal planet or universes that are billions and billions of light years away as they tell us they are he began to work right here upon the earth because here he was going to work and and tried to get the womb of the earth to bring forth a perverted life his own life and and so sin would enter into the earth by perversion and that would be by perverting the word of god by getting a god's son and daughter to doubt god's promise in god's word now sin or unbelief is the seed of the old serpent it is unbelief unbelief is the word perverted changed into lie and from sin would come every kind of heartache adultery and fornication and cleanliness and lasciviousness and idolatry and witchcraft and hatred and variance and emulation and wrath and strife and seditions and heresies and envy and murders and drunken and rebellions and so you know from and from eve's womb now this this womb that god would give adam to to bring forth a life from which would come by the spoken word and then you know would again what the dust would be formed around it like jesus was in the dust of mary's womb but cain you know from that from um eve's womb would now come not just the the life but a perverted life and that provided life would come from a perverted word and and cain was of that wicked one and then of course from there would also come abel and and then abel would be killed by cain and then south would be raised up in abel's place and out of these two now cane the seed of the serpent the bible said he was of that wicked one and and then seth who was of the lineage of of adam here would come two separate peoples and they would have two very separate genealogies and they would be kept apart by god but then in noah's day these two races identified as cain's children the sons of men and seth's children the sons of god would mix and meld together and this would bring an evil to its heights in the days of noah and it would cause god to destroy the earth with the flood and from there god would he would have to start all over and of course the earth would go through his first stage of redemption which would be a baptism with water and and god would begin to seek a godly seed and he would call a man by the name of abraham and out of abraham of course would come a woman and that would be israel and israel would be the womb from which would bring the man seed jesus christ are you following me are you with me now so because again god would need a womb to bring forth his son he would need an earth as a womb to bring forth life amen he would you know adam would need a womb to bring forth to life to reproduce again again we would see that the serpent would need a womb also and he would come with a perverted seed in order to bring forth a perverted life now so so again now god begins to work because he still has in his mind to bring forth a messiah to bring forth a second adam to bring forth one in his image to again have a god race and that is not mixed up but something that is is pure and sinless and perfect there's somebody with me now and so god would call abraham and out of for the purpose out of abraham that would come a woman and out of that woman israel that would come a messiah now and so a nation would rise now sarah would portray um israel as a because she would be a very old woman when this when this seed would come forth and you know that that um and this old woman israel and and and stay with me just a minute kind of follow my line of thinking this old woman israel who after turning returning from babylon she would be renewed like sarah was of old in order to bring forth the man child the messiah and then out of that seed christ out of that seed christ he would have a woman he would produce a womb that he could reproduce himself the church and this church is to be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and power his power and life of his life now this woman israel was to be a womb that god could bring forth his likeness the second adam now we remember that god chose her for a wife she was to be his womb through the seed would come now david would reflect him and isaiah would reflect him but they were not the seed that he had in mind his seed was to bring forth the sun in his own image now and so he there we but he would marry he would marry israel at 50 days after the passover after they left egypt 50 days at the first pentecost there he would covet himself with the woman israel he would become married to her she was to be a womb from which the seed would come right amen but the devil knows this and the devil's watching everything that he's doing and the devil wants that wound too to bring forth his own perverted life from so he's followed right along to bring his perversion remember the true spirits will be so close in the last day it would deceive the very elect if it were possible that was how they intertwined all the way down we could go down to the twins starting in heaven michael and lucifer the twins on earth which which was the which was the serpent a man like creature and adam then the twins that followed there a cane and an abel the twins that would come forth there in abraham's day two sons you know ishmael a wild seed and the m and isaac the true seed the seed of the promise the seed of faith and then we could go right on down and we could look at a jacob and an esau more twins again and on down and off because every revival produces twins and don't forget that this revival also will produce twins [Applause] because satan is looking for the womb to try to bring forth his own life a perverted life a perverted message a perverted christianity now so god would take this woman israel out of here whom he had called as a nation and he would remind her in and i believe this is in ezekiel 16 where he would remind her yes in ezekiel 16 he would remind israel how he called her from the heathens am i'm saying that birth that nativity of of what was of the land of canaan and that father it was an amorite and a mother a hittite and he tells of of of her how he called her out of the heathens to be a people unto himself to be a virgin woman to be a church that would be a womb to him that he could bring forth his life amen because it had become one the serpent bruiser who would bruise the head of the serpent and it would have to come through a virgin now as an infant nation with starting with abraham isaac and jacob and his twelve sons god would care for her as a he and described her finding her like an abandoned child and whose navel was not cut or none pity dim well and and was rejected it was as a rejected unwanted infant cast into an open field and he said nobody wanted you you know you would have died out there you'd have never survived i called you out of the heathen and you'd have never made it but i come along and i pitied you amen i passed by you ezekiel 16 6 when i passed by you and i saw thee polluted in thine own blood i said unto thee when thou was in thy blood live yea i said unto thee when thou would send thine own blood you see it was the word that came from god that gave them life amen it was that word that protected them it was that word that sustained them when they were an infant nation amen at the end and he gave them life because he breathed upon them when they were when they were an infant dying abandoned unwanted people and god called her out of the of the nations amen out of the heathen remember remember abraham was a gentile remember he was a heathen amen remember he had to be taught about one god he had to be taught how to worship remember he he was and there in their infancy god watched over him god looked after him god carried him he called him out to make him a people for his namesake and they grew into a nation and ezekiel 16 7 said i caused thee to multiply as the blood of the field and thou hast increased in wax and great and our come to excellent ornaments that breast are fastened the hair is grown worrying that was naked and bare in other words i watched you mature i watched you grow up and and and he says where you were naked and bear yeah i swear to thee and i entered into a covenant i entered into a covenant with thee saith the lord and thou became as mine notice what he said i i found you you know and i established you and i called you out of the people to be mine amen and then i waited to you grow up until you matured and i was good won't take you for pride and i entered into a covenant with you i swore to you and i you became mine [Music] why because god wanted her as a womb to bring forth himself to bring forth his own life amen now ezekiel goes on to talk about her how she became rich then and a great nation self-assured and self-independent no longer needed to rely upon god and wanted to be like the other nations and became a horus woman in jeremiah 3 he spoke of her as one who became a polluted woman she played the harlot with many lovers and polluted the line with her whoredoms yet he pleaded with her eternal backsliding children saith the lord for i am married to you and i'll take you one of a city and two of a family and i'll bring you to zion and i i will restore i i'm married to you i i want to restore you she's carried off to babylon and god brought her back why why did god do all of that why would he go and and seemingly waste all the effort on a nation that had been taken away as slaves into a foreign land what not forget about him like all the other philistines disappeared amen all the other nations disappeared they got swallowed up in the sword but but why israel why was israel restored why did god work upon her he needed a worm to blame for this offspring and finally from a remnant of israel within that nation there came a virtuous woman i want to get this to you for a moment a virtuous woman a virtuous church who we could give his seed we know we know the names of some of that virgin church there was simeon anna elizabeth zachariah mary joseph just to name a few and there was others who were waiting for the consolation of israel there was more than them there were unnamed peoples called shepherds in the field to whom god the angels of god could appear to are you with me amen and it would be to this little virgin group of believers that the word would come amen that the message would come amen here again the message would come which would be glory to god in the highest at peace on earth and my good will toward man here i am i found the people hallelujah that has the faith to bring forth the messiah i found a virgin's woman amen more than virgin mary but a virgin church died of her could come and deliver now to this little virgin group of believers came the word to seed a man child that was born of the virgin god took on flesh so that out of christ now really remember he has a purpose of bringing the man forth just like he had a purpose to bring abraham it was so that out of him would come a woman a womb there was adam in the beginning but out of him would come a woman a womb somebody followed me amen so now again he would do the same he would have a church and she would bring forth all what all the scriptures what all the prophecies had prophesied what david had prophesied jeremiah isaiah ezekiel what sarah typed out what esther every one of them was pointing to this messiah jesus would be the fulfillment in the embodiment of every word of promise that would be manifested in a little small virgin group of people who would receive a messiah the man child but his whole purpose of bringing him forth was that out of him would come a womb a woman a church which he could bring forth himself his offspring more of the god race than jesus are you with me now so dare put him in to sleep as he did adam out of christ would come the elements to make a bride water blood and spirit so that a church a womb could be born that could reproduce him and on the day of pentecost in the upper room he coveted in marriage this church she was a virgin untouched by man a pure virtuous church and now i can say she was without a spot or wrinkle amen and paul paul is clear paul is clear about this woman he said she is a virtuous church hey man she is a church listen let me tell you something friends if there wasn't lord to be manifested if god had wanted her just for another womb for more to come are you with me they could have been raptured back then they were a seed church they were mature church hallelujah and paul is clear about what happened with eve in the garden and used it to foretell what would happen in the church he said now he says here we got a virtuous church a spotless church amen she don't have any false doctrines there's nothing sealed to her book her book isn't close the inheritance is open she has the abstract the title she's got the correct baptism amen she don't have creeds of man there's never been a wrong seed ever entered her she has not perverted she is solely belongs to christ but ii corinthians 11 12 but for i am jealous over you i keep guarding you i'm doing everything i can you know here to keep you with jealousy with godly jealousy second corinthians 11 2 amen try to catch these scriptures i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband get this one husband a man that i may present you as what a chaste a pure virgin to christ this is my desire this is what you how you must be presented as a chaste virgin nothing else will work a polluted womb won't work amen i've got to have you as a chase virgin but i fear lest by any means as the serpent be godly through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in christ for he that cometh preaches another jesus oh here's another husband but he's an imposter he's calling himself a savior too he's a beguiler he's a slicker come on whom you is another one that preaches another jesus whom i didn't preach or receive another spirit oh what a spirit amen which you have not received or another gospel oh my goodness another gospel yeah yeah you know it's going to use the same bible he's going to use the same words and say yeah hath god said isn't it written in the bible but a twist just a little turn just just enough to put a doubt there another gospel which you have not accepted you might bear well with him he said i i'm afraid you would give him to him i'm really concerned about you amen now he was jealous of the woman the church trying to keep you pure for he feared she would be corrupted lose her virginity by receiving another gospel a seed from another spirit the and the offspring of this church instead of being from christ would be of that wicked one amen that wicked one would be another jesus oh bear in all similarities to this using the word too coming along talking about the jesus of 2000 years ago but when you pull the mask off of him it's not that jesus you're not the same in works the same in power the same in the holiness he's not there are you with me and the resume of the church agent brother bradham told us with these principles of mind we start to trace the church to the various seven ages the birth of the church was at pentecost the first adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of god and was undefiled for a brief span so was christ the second adam given a bribe pure and fresh at pentecost and she remains separate and undefiled for some time and the rest does no man join to them acts 5-13 and the daily the the lord added daily such would be saved acts 2 and 47. how long this continued we do not know but one day even as eve was tempted and seduced by satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of the antichrist spirit so here she was virgin for a time come on but here comes the entrance now of an antichrist spirit and this is the spirit first john 4 3. this is that spirit of antichrist where have you heard that it should come even now already it is in the world so it's already he said it's made its entrance paul's got a reason to be afraid there's another suitor amen there's one that's one thing before we can consummate it all before we can bring an end to all things before we can hear it there's a suitor coming in and i'm warning you i'm warning you he will have found you just like the serpent defiled eve and you bring forth out of your womb a perverted child now revelation 2 4 and 5 i have somewhat against thee he would say to them because thou has left thy first love look the first age they're already losing their first love remember therefore from once thou art fallen and repent so already before the church gets out of the first aid she's a fallen woman the thing that paul fear is now already on the church and the church is already beginning already falling she's already making the moves now the church brother branham said was in that first stage already a fallen woman as satan had got to eve before adam even now satan seduced the church the bride of christ before the marriage supper of the lamb amen he promised her a marriage supper he promised her a new home in the new heavens and the new earth he promised her a honeymoon of a millennial reign come on somebody he had given her an abstract to the title deed a clear deed a perfect word to wash her by to keep her clean by and my but before the marriage supper she got seduced now what specifically was in the midst it was in her midst that caused the fall revelation 2 6 the deeds of the nicolaitans already that first aids had turned from following the pure word of god they turned from god's demand of a church absolutely depended upon him dependent entirely upon god to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government to nicolaitanism which is organizing a human government within the church which is all the governments do legislate for the people and that's what exactly what they did what israel did and they took the expediency of human government instead of the word in the spirit now so in contrast to this lovely woman the church who is the bride of christ now comes in contrast to her strong contrast is another woman this fallen woman and she's called the great now just as much as there's in the bible a pure spotless virgin church there is a contaminated defiled horus church as white and pure as this one is without spot or wrinkle without a blemish there is another woman and she is filthy lewd a drunkard amen oh yeah a drunkard yet beautifully dressed ornate oh my she's she's affluent she's wealthy she's beautiful to look upon but she's a murderer amen oh brother she's such a murderer she'd cut her husband up in three pieces make him into three gods she's such a murderer she would take that physically and would kill 68 million who would dare to disagree with her she's ruthless speaks of her in revelation 17 as a great and she sits upon many waters and the waters are symbolic of multitudes and nations and people and tongues or languages she she rules many but in the world population there's about three three billion of them if you want to know the truth even islam is one of her daughters amen even brother branham said communism is a product an offspring of the catholic church because of her because of her ways and her doings it causes him to rise up this woman is so lewd and vulgar though she's beautifully dressed and purple and scarlet she's wearing gold and precious stones and pearls but she causes inhabitants of the earth to be drunk with mind-altering wine of abominations and filthiness of fornications upon her forehead was a name written mystery babbling to great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth and then it goes on down and said and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints with the blood of the martyrs of jesus amen now this woman who is this woman she too is a church [Music] i mean just as paul said you know of a church without spot or wrinkle or blemish this woman is a church and she is she is affluent she sits on seven hills she claims she is the first church are you with me amen she sits upon seven hills and claims to be the first church and she's the mother of the rest of the churches on record she's killed more than 68 million of the saints and then in revelation 18 you find an angel declares that this mystery woman who models after an ancient babylon is fallen and she has become the habitation of devils hey man she is the hold of every foul spirit a cage of ever unclean and hateful birds and then the voice would scream out come out of her my people am i my people separate yourself cut out of her amen that's not the unclean thing don't be a part of that don't drink our wine i've got a people even in all of this i'm getting people somewhere that's going to hear my voice amen that will rise up that will be a womb that i can bring my life through my power can be demonstrated through her my glory can be shown upon her but my life will radiate through her revelation 17 18 gives a very sordid picture of this sleazy immoral foul vulgar woman the church the church that would start out like i'll do a virgin and yet she's beautiful now to look home see glorifies in her own self we're the church she said red and purple and scarlet precious stones she's got wealth and affluence in fact the matter she controls a good port of the part of the population of the earth billions and god is marked her as a ho as a harlot as a as mystery babbling the great the chord the great because she has incorporated the the ancient babylonian worship with christianity and as a mother of harlots and the abominations of the earth and her womb out of her womb instead of coming forth christ has come for more harlots not sons and daughters of god but corrupted offspring for who dwells in her or her habitation inner habitation is a habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of uncle ever unclean and hateful bird listen i'm not preaching hate messages this morning i'm preaching the bible i am calling it the way the bible calls it are you with me now get rid of your political correct thinking just for a moment and then look at it from the bible perspective how god looks at it and man i want you to see here she is a she's a cage of every unclean and hateful bird these birds are men and women let me read it from jeremiah 5 25 your iniquities have turned away these things and your sins have withholded good things from you for among my people are found wicked men they lay weight as he that sell the snares they set a trap they catch men and as a cage of under uh full of birds so are their houses full of deceit therefore they have become great and wax and rich so this woman is a false religion a false church who's impersonating making a false claim to be the queen of heaven i said as a queen and the people that are caught in a trap of false religion they true are religious people now we're going to look at ii timothy 3 and 1 and down through those verses for a moment but that this scripture describes her offspring and the condition of these religious people who are drunk on her wine thinking that jesus is going to take them to heaven in their sins that's where that's their the drink they're not real believers they are impersonators the bible were going to say for as janice and jeffrey's withstood moses so they were impersonators that these were impersonators they will corrupt the truth and he so they're not real believers but they're impersonators who withstood moses and so will these corrupt men re resist the truth now claiming to be the bride of christ yet here is the true condition of the these impersonators i want you to see we're going to take the cover off of them let's see if they're without spot or wrinkle or blemish second timothy 3 1 this new also in the last days perilous times to come this is going to be matthew 24 24 it'll be so close to see the elect if it were possible for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boosters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god didn't say they didn't love god said they love pleasures more and they have a because what they're religious next verse they are religious to have a form of godliness they have a pretension amen they they're carrying themselves as i'm a believer in christ i've accepted his pardon i i'm his church i'm a part of his body because we're drinking the wine of a church because they they're drunk on it having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof and then the same thing he says of the mother come out of her my people he says this from sense turn away because these are her offspring now another translation or paraphrase of this says you need to be aware in the final days the culture of society will become extremely fierce haven't we seen that people will be self-centered lovers of themselves obsessed with money that will boast to great things they strut around with arrogant pride mock all things that are right they will ignore their own families it will be ungrateful and ungodly they will be addicted to hateful and malicious slanders that's called news are you with me and they're addicted to hateful and malicious slander amen they're slaves to desire slaves of porn slaves of adultery and filth they will be ferocious but belligerent haters of that which is good and right with brutal treachery that will act without restraint bigoted wrapped in their clouds of their own conceit they will find the light in the places of this world more than the pleasures of the loving god they may pretend to have a respect for god but in reality they want nothing to do with god's power stay away from people like these on such turn away come out of her my people so you see here is the conditions of the end time and its people they will have a form of godliness religious men but deny the power thereof and he says to them as such turn away like was said a great come out of her my people be not partakers with them notice now and the word comes to them oh they read the bible like you do they listen to gospel sermons they listen and they cry with gospel songs amen but the word comes to them but not on good ground not on prepared ground and they have a form of godliness but not deny the power thereof by the way i'm reading from wisdom versus faith and then ii timothy said you know having a form of godliness you know denying the power thereof watch the holy spirit signs of eternal life they deny that people our ought to speak with tongues no no such thing as divine healing baptism of the holy oak that stuff was for the apostles look look where they are amen they deny the power thereof let me read again the signs holy spirit signs of eternal life they deny that people want to speak with tongues no no such thing as divine healing baptism of the holy ghost that stuff was for the apostles having a form paul prophesied in the last days these things would take place not in the in them days but these days the spirit speaks expressly in the last days latter day some will depart from the faith and all these things and here that that there it is having a form of godliness notice religious yet denying the power i want you to hold this thought now because we are to come out from among that they are covetous come on they're not changed boasters proud blasphemers still disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection oh yeah but brother tim we may we now you're gonna but but we have accepted the message and we know it's doctrines and when we we got the holy ghost by believing and yet they're still boasters and proud and blasphemers disobedient to parents and unfaithful and unholy and without natural affections and truths breakers and false accusers and incontinent and fears and despisers of those that are good but a religious having a form of godliness but yet they deny the power of the gospel to cleanse you i'm going to dwell on this for a minute a form of godliness but no power to live it they claim to be the church but they're unclean and hateful birds that condition covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy false accusers how do we wind up here people call themselves christians impersonators as janice and jamboree withstood the words of the true prophet of god they are not offsprings of god come on amen they are offsprings of a religious system or the society of a church amen and they live sorted lives but when it comes to christ they're not loyal to him amen they're harlots with a blatant refusal to be loyal to christ amen now like i said they'll they'll still they'll sit right there hey they'll sit right there and defy you in a message church let me just bring it down to home we can talk about baptist methodist and presbyterian let's bring it right down here defy you defy will stand the vindicated prophet and boys still wearing their shorts defy the prophet of god girls still wearing their makeup [Applause] amen defy what the prophet god said heady high-minded lepers are places more than lovers of god go right on with their unholy filthy dress amen one that they can't get to cover a knee when they're standing or sitting too tight i mean trim their hair paint their nails waves like a harlot because they are mirroring their birth and their mother because if they mirrored the mother of the world they would be holy and without blemish before him in love the way back brother branham said number one killer is sin trouble sin his number the number one killer not heart trouble many say brother branham you say these things too hard we have to sin a little every day we just got to someone said you know brother branham i hear you condemning smoking and i do believe and he says and i do believe men shouldn't smoke i believe in holiness cleanness throughout soul body and spirit and say well we i we gotta i gotta just i just gotta smoke i just gotta smoke a little you know some you know what you know hey don't go throwing eggs at me this morning i have dealt with men who claimed this message and witnessed this message and testified of this message and claimed to be holy ghost field and their anointing came by going out and smoking a joint of marijuana amount so don't don't throw eggs at me i know what i'm talking about i'm not we're not pretending we're not being pretentious this morning we're exposing it amen so many we say i've got to take a little social drink in order to hold my job or others you know i've got a you know it's my self medication my alcohol i gotta have it you know to calm me down you know i i've gotta i gotta have it there to cope with life's trouble don't tell me i just met a girl in the prayer line who was drinking because you know there was trouble in her marriage and adulteries that had taken place and and she had turned to alcohol to calm herself yet she looked like a message person long hair long dress no makeup we hear women say i just got to cut my hair and wear my dresses up to date to keep my social standing in my church if i don't the women will say i look too old i just wonder how many you know are really really thinking about modest apparel but rather trying to look 25 years younger forgive me i'm going to say this this is brother branham forgive me i'm going to say something that's pentecostal prostitution that's right the reason they do it is because they hadn't tried the inoculation they hadn't tried god's serum for sin and these things that's right but now in hebrews it tells us a worshiper once wants purge he has no more conscience or otherwise no more desire to sin the whole thing's come from and he says there's no more you don't have to sin every day you don't have to do these things you do it because you willfully want to and the reason you willfully want to is because you never died to yourself oh brother i know that scorching but it's good when you die to yourself you become a new creature and then those things are gone amen hallelujah amen and if you try to act like you got him before you have it's like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wing and say look i'm a peacock he isn't he's that's something he's stuck in his self it has to grow from the inside out and that's what the holy spirit is it's not something you smear on or something like that it's a new birth you've got to be born again and these virtues of the holy ghost has to come from the inside out listen now and when the world and sin and cutting hair and painting comes out against the word of god it shows the holy spirit is not there that's a direct evidence so what would you call it pentecostal prostitution that's exactly right committing spiritual the fornication with the god of heaven what a shame and disgrace it is prostituting themselves looking at what a prophet of god said in his in the message god's message to this end time and then want to take and twist it how did the church who began as a virgin without spot or wrinkle and was to produce christ bring forth such offspring now brother branham said the church was in that first stage was already a fallen woman as satan had got to eve before adam even now satan seduced the church the bride of christ before the marriage suffered the lamb and what specifically was in her midst that caused the fall what but revelation 2 6 the deeds of the nicolaitan already that first church had turned from following the pure word of god and by the so by the first age the church had already began to lose its first love and the first seal when it opens it exposes the antichrist amen he and and he's writing and notice in his first right he's an impersonator of christ he's on a white horse he has a bow but no arrows he is a bluff amen he starts out as an insidious spirit progressing in a gradual way and as a slicker moving the virtuous woman toward seduction now brother branham in the second seal tells us what happened you know he he recaps what he preached in the first seal and brings it out in the beginning of the second seal and he talks about how that a spirit come out of hell called nicolaitanism a nicoleth spirit which means to conquer the laity to take the power of god out of the church somebody with me now amen and to conquer the laity moving the little virgin church from her simple uncultured uneducated ways just this little humble girl and mover pushing out toward a woman of wealth and power dressed in scarlet purple deck with cold and and and and precious stones and pearls first let me just describe it and i'm going to give you the the references to it in paragraph 122 of the second seal and on down but let me let me just for the sake of not just reading quotes but just to put it in my own words so first this humble virgin girl when the holy ghost fell everybody began with everything in common there was no big ones or little ones there were great signs and wonders among them and there were prophecies and tongues and interpretations healings miracles discernments of spirits amen demons were cast out sins were cleansed they were everyone baptized in the name of jesus christ there were not three gods among them there were not two lords there was no confusion on godhead they served the one true and living god amen they were zealous for god and when they prayed the building joke with the power of god and they were filled with the holy ghost they went about from house to house breaking bread there was no unholiness no uncleanliness among them they were not ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit and then satan started to murmur among them because as they testified of the god's great power their rich masters and men of affluence heard the great work god was doing and they wanted to dress it up soon army captains and centurions and celebrities and dignitaries and men of wealth and affluence begin to join in their members and you know when they embrace christianity you know there it was hard for them rich men to go down to that old dingy dark hall where they clapped their hands where they shouted and speaking in tongues and getting messages now i'm quoting why he could never take his competitor his business associate whatever it is in his business he can you know he'd never believe it like that so he had to dress it up so it begins very subtly first there are and and yet there are those in that age that are actually commended for hating the deeds of the nicolaitans but then it comes in gradually as a doctrine just moving them a little bit at a time and soon joy was gone shouting was gone next darndest prayers were gone people didn't pray no more you know then the gifts of the spirit were gone and there was no more speaking in tongues and divine healing was gone and miracles didn't exist anymore hello this is how it came in that early church nicolaitans began to work and began with doctrine to take away the power of god and experience with god would be would be substituted by accepting a doctrine well i accept the message i believe god sent a prophet they lowered the bars and soon goats come in and took over unchanged the crowd of joy was gone the freedom the spirit was gone oh they kept like they keep on with the form but the fire had died down and the blackness of ashes was about all that was left you see it was a nicolaitan doctrine it was called in the bible antichrist because it was against the original doctrine of christ and his and his apostles so it came against the movement of the spirit it came against shouting it came against speaking in tongues it came again listen wanted to strip the church of power come on somebody and it embraced well the gospel don't have the power to change you so you got the holy ghost and you're still in porn you got the holy ghost and you're still married two or three times amen you've got the holy ghost and you can still cheat business deals you've got the holy ghost and you can still be an alcoholic but you got the holy ghost come on you you've got the holy ghost and you can still smoke a joint or you can do this or you can do that what and first thing you know the power is gone from the church instead of being a virtuous church without spot or wrinkle it becomes a cage of every unclean and hateful bird don't hang up on me i ain't half through nicolaitan means to conquer the laity to remove the power of god from the lay people put it all up on a ministry listen the words of your prophet paul saw it coming he warned him about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with his false doctrines he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit ministry listen a way of worship that excludes the people from any part in a holy spirit ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there's not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can find is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it now watch the spirit today look what it produces look what it wants to do by by educating by somebody help me now my man pray for me really hard right now what's that spirit today we you know comes in hardly an amen in the church youth they can't have a revival amen the gifts or the the you know the the the the spirit of god or the spirit of the naked nicolaitanes don't want the delayed the church to have the gifts of the spirit speaking in tongues is forbidden prophecy is the spice altar calls are forbidden and for that demon somebody listen don't want the seeker to receive an experience with god but instead just receive a knowledge imparted through from a teacher and no you are not allowed to shout only the preacher can do that from the pulpit and only then when he's angry and when you do that you're fast on your way to proving yourself as an offspring of the great you're starting to fit in a different category than the bride of christ balaam you see brother branham said this about and we're just going to speak about balaam in just a minute but let me take you this quote he said you see if you take away the word of god in the movement of the spirit as a means of worship they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth then you have to give people another form of worship as a substitute and that substitution spells balaamism if you take away the word of god and the moving of the spirit as a means of worship they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth then you will have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute and that substitution spells balaamism now balaamism was what was called in the old testament in the new testament it's called nicolaitanism because again balaam his design was to keep the people from the promised land where there's healing miracles signs wonders real deliverance true salvation now in the old testament there was this nation who wanted to keep israel out of her land so balak sent balaam to talk her out of what she had and balaam looked down upon listen now look down upon pentecostal people hello balaam who looks down on pentecostal people today amen yeah pentecostal people because israel had covenant with god and married him at sinai uh at pentecost they were the first pentecostals and a marriage took place 50 days after the passover and balaam looked down upon that woman israel and she's not denominated but she has a pillar of fire with supernatural signs she has a smitten raw she has divine healing and she has a shout of the king amen amen i'll tell you this we had that before the prophet left us [Applause] amen we had that in the 40s we had that in the 50s we had that in the 60s and i'm gonna say that today there's a church that has that right here in this last day right here in the end time hallelujah but you see he didn't want them pentecostal people to get in their promised land and receive their inheritance so he tried cursing them and all he could do was get god to bless them amen you know i've had men come along and try to curse me literally because try to call curses down to heaven and i just laugh at them and mock them and say curse on man curse some because the more you curse the more god's going to bless me amen but again you know here he tried cursing him and god kept blessing them and he said but he finally figured out i know how to get him to fall and what he couldn't do by cursing he did it by telling him oh but we're all one and you really don't need that pillar of fire with signs and wonders and divine healing you see that was for another age and and the shout of the king you don't need that let me dress you up and make you more dignified you see because we we we believe all that too but we're more dignified you know now balaamism is the subjection of the people to their system of creed and worship in order to hold them listen again balaamism is a subjection of the people to their system of creed and worship in order to hold them now in the pergament age brother brandon said moses or moab represented the nicolaitans now just for a minute israel represented the true church balaam was one of the bishops of hopes now we see carnal christianity now we'll notice he was gifted there was no doubt about it many of them are fine speakers and doctors of philosophy and great men you can't deny that but having a form of godliness but denying the power there go back to that original pentecost don't get away from there if you do you are lost stay with that blessing that's the the blesser of the blessing so what he was trying to do was move them away from the spirit moving to man's leadership now let's go back to this lewd woman just for a moment she's a church that's impersonating claiming to be the church she's the queen of heaven pretending to be the bride of christ and remember that's how the antichrist started his ride pretending he was on a white horse impersonating christ a bow with no arrows now in the first seal brother branham tells us this he said he's a bluff this is this is the first seal he's a bluff he has no power you say the power of the church where is it out what do they do they say we're the original church the original church cast out devils healed the sick raised the dead saw visions everything else words of that now see he's a bluff a bow with no arrows you see again he has a form of godliness but he denies the power so don't you see how the antichrist spirit wants to reduce us to a powerless religion because why god hates a powerless religion come on amen are you with me he hates a horus church don't say brother tim he don't hate the horse he hates the horace church and he will burn her with fire read the bible he will stone her with stones like a prostitute come on now we're talking about jesus of the new testament god hates a powerless religion it's got to have power it's got to have power to save a man from sin is a power that can do signs and wonders miracles is jesus promise you see you zero in on the word of god and they zeroed on it back there and believed it hit the target you zero the same way on the word of god it'll hit the target again because it's got to because he's the same yesterday today and forever god don't like a powerless religion god don't want that god wants to perform god wants to show himself alive yeah our hopes is the resurrection is that right our hopes is of life is resurrection the resurrection of jesus christ you see god wants to work in his church jesus said i'll be with you always to the end of the world the works that i do so you do also so he's a bluff but we're not bluffing we're christians come on we're overcoming somebody help me now we are conquering and in the true church devils are cast out hallelujah the sick are healed visions are sown amen our boat has arrows and it'll hit the target if it hit it two thousand years ago he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen and it'll hit the target again and again and again but you can't hit a target with no arrows we're not bluffing as christians we're overcoming and conquering amen our flesh amen wait a minute we're not just talking about on one side supernatural things because many will come to me in that day and say lord lord have i not cast out devils in your name and they're still workers of iniquity so some work iniquities do believe in miracles and other workers iniquity don't neither one uplift are you with me amen but notice in the true church the devil's has to be cast out as i've said this has got to be the number one thing that we do as a body of christ cast satan out [Music] cast him out of lives casts him out come on somebody amen cast every demon of alcohol tobacco drugs come on this is this spirit that wants to come long hair on men and short hair on women cast out the devils out amen the sickness be healed visions must be shown amen our bell has to have arrows but our flesh also has to be made submissive and it's true i want to talk about this for a moment your flesh is unconverted oh yeah and still has sinful tendencies it still can be tempted it wants to doubt amen brother branham would we would would pray every day god forgive me of my sins what was it doubting unbelief of every kind of form coming and warned against you we're in a battle amen we're in a battle amen amen you see when we have a flesh here that that has a tendency that is pulled toward doubting fear fear has torment is the opposite of faith even jesus after receiving the holy ghost was tempted of the devil with all kinds of temptations against his flesh is that right and as long as you have this life as long as you're in this life and i'm quoting brother branham here you are going to have us be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all sin is gone from you hallelujah let me tell you though though the body is weak though the flesh is unconverted the holy ghost is greater than the weakness of your flesh and it will keep you in the hour of temptation and i'm telling you i'm telling you we are not bluffing we are real warriors against the devil hallelujah you cast down imaginations you cast down wrong thoughts you cast down wrong tempers come on church you you you cast down your your wrong passions you cast down your fears you're in a battle and it's a battle but you're not a loser you're a winner [Applause] hallelujah amen now your new creature your desires and ambitions are of heaven you mean you've changed from a cuckle bird to a week your desires are the same as it's saying as it once was and you display the token you don't displace sin you just play the holy ghost amount brother branham said and you say and i believe that and still sin and now you're deceived it can't display nothing but the token the token has to be on display not not not all of these other things that we read about lovers of their own selves and heading and high-minded and treasures lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god your life your new life does not display porn sex abuse filth drinking smoking dope it's a conqueror it can't display nothing but the token amen now if you're just playing the other you need to get born again amen in galatians 2 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me that's the life i now live i live by the faith of the son of god amen flesh here's how it is with those that live by the flesh second peter 2 14 have an eyes full of adultery cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls a heart would save exercise covetous practices curse children which have forsaken the right way and have gone astray following the way of balaam who taught it you know who taught israel to send to fornication and idolatry saying my israel and moab was all the same people serving the same god and could just mix together we're not the same come on church remember we do not have the message of the horror system the horse system says you can't help but be a traitor heady high-minded you can't delay you can't help but live this way why your mother amen you've taken on her spirit instead of the holy spirit so you're a harlot like she's a come on somebody amen but not the church of jesus christ she is a virtuous bloodwatch bride of jesus christ a virgin she is washed by the washing of the water by the word she knows her god and she does exploits hallelujah i'm talking to young people who are doing exploits i mean that the gods are porn they will not bow down to the gods of a fornication of adultery all of these games and everything else that will steal away your time you're not a slave to it hallelujah amen why you don't serve their gods you don't belong to the horror system that's their children that's how they do that's what kind of offspring she has amen but the true offspring of the word of god brings forth the life of jesus christ yes sir amen now the bible said that how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein so why are we why are we advocating living and on in sin the bible said in romans 6 6 knowing our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin there's a people that don't serve sin amen for he that is dead is freed from sin amen romans 6 12 let there let sin therefore let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that it should be obeyed the luster of it goes on to save your sins and i have dominion over you because being made friends free from sin you become the servants of righteousness the desire of sin is gone hallelujah amen you don't want to be like that you want to be more like jesus right amen the message of the gospel is to prove to the world that he's living not 2 000 years ago but living where in bright form in his people hallelujah amen it's the light in the evening time amen where he says i'll prove to my disciples i'm not dead but i'm alive i'm so living in them people they're not slaves to sin anymore they're not slaves to unbelief anymore they're not slaves to fear or doubt come on somebody amen they're free-born their children are the free woman they are not bonds women they are not prostitutes they are not they are not pilots they are virgin to the word of god they prove that his life is in them hallelujah and you can't do that just by word only it comes with power and great assurance amen it's not a make-believe gospel it's not a denomination of fiction oh god's going to take us all in heaven just say jesus i i'm sorry for my sins okay you're you're saved and going to heaven your life's got to be changed you've got to die to sin amen you can't continue on as brother branham told us and i just say it's a problem worldwide it's a problem worldwide i i wanted to say it's a problem even in this church i'm afraid to admit today many of us are not getting the people to christ we're getting them to church to a theory but we must get them to christ he's the only one and the only one that has life he has the he that has the son has life and he said i'm afraid of this and i'll tell you what just just stand with me sometimes in prayer lines with people when when sin becomes exposed and devil's there are being exposed and people realize i need christ i need help and they come up in prayer lines and sins are exposed and troubled and everything else and you'll find out we haven't got him to christ we got to do the church we got them to the theory we got them to believe god sent a prophet maybe maybe but we never got them to christ their lives are still unchanged but it's a life of a dead man be projecting you you'll live the same kind he lived for life of another and if your spirit is wrecking dead and the life of christ comes into you how can you help but live the life of christ so i'm going to say there has to be a virgin bride the people of the resurrection prepared to meet the bridegroom and god left it for this age for there to come a bride without spot somebody with me now not an immature girl like in the days of luther not a preteen like in the days of wesley not a little teeny bopper like the azusa movement infatuated and dazzled with gifts and not together amen but a mature elect lady ready and willing to take on his name and unashamed of anything that he has his name his identity his gifts his miracles his signs his wonders come on one who has his identity you know remember this lewd woman of revelation 17 blasphemes his name by rejecting it as the only name of salvation come on he said he carried me into the spirit into the wilderness i saw a woman sitting on this girl a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns there it was this this one that was full of names of blasphemy these would be a there would be a departure from the faith in these perilous times and these religious men with forms of godliness that be blasphemers by claiming the name of christ and not departing from iniquity name's a blasphemy brother bradham told us he said names mean something he said don't name your child ricky or elvis or something like that he said you know it's a it's a name for this day it goes you know it means something so our name means nothing he said well why did he change abram's name to abraham and why did he change uh saul's name to paul and why did change simon's name to peter why did he change his own name what he changed jacob to israel not until he wrestled with the lord not only overcome but when jesus overcome death hell and the grave the bible said he had a new name amen he was the conqueror and he said if the church can overcome she will stop saying i'm methodist baptist and presbyterian are you with me now if the church can overcome she'll quit trying to identify her as little groups of two souls in perusian seven thunders and this and that and the other i'm methodists i'm baptist and presbyterian you see these are these are defined in the bible it's blasphemous names or names of blasphemy because to be called anything other than the name of your bridegroom is the marking of a headless woman a harlot but she as a virgin bride receives a name change hallelujah this is why when we water baptized we take on his name we are buried in his name we rise in his name everything we do in word of deed we do it in the name of jesus christ amen she's a virgin bride who receives his name notice when she can overcome her creeds and the world that's drawn her in there she'll come back to being the bride of jesus christ miseras jesus christ hallelujah now you see they've taken on names of blasphemy remember we're only to have his name but they take on names of blasphemy like a grafted lemon living in the life of an orange tree it's an on an orange tree but it's barren lemons so but he said every time that tree gets a year older puts forth a new branch it puts forth more oranges if the vine puts forth its branch and what we tried to do is we joined members into him and live under the name of christianity energy because it's a common way of saying we are the citrus fruit the christian church but when the vine itself puts forth the vine it'll be like the first vine it put forth if the first vine had put forth they wrote a book of acts behind it if it if it puts ever puts forth another one it'll write another book of acts behind it right so you're only joining lodges when you're born of the vine you got a fruit and you got a fruit what do you do with it you have a form of godliness denying the power thereof so they deny the fruits you see instead of bringing forth oranges they're bringing forth another life and so he says you deny signs i'm quoting your prophet you deny wonders you deny the holy ghost you deny speaking in tongues you deny visions you deny prophecies you deny healing and yet you call yourself a name no wonder the holy ghost said a power a group of people full of blasphemous names you're calling themselves christian with forms of godliness but denying the power from such what were we commanded turn away come out of her my people amen oh my notice he opens his mouth and blasphemy teaching for doctrines and commandments of man heady high-minded lovers of pleasure having a form of godliness denying the power thereof blasphemes the name of god changing that name to titles refusing to do otherwise amen as delilah a harlot betrayed samson all right let me tell you that spirit will betray you don't lay your head down in her lap are you with me are you hearing me even across the lands today don't lay your head down in her lap no sir it'll convince you that you can't live an overcoming life it will point to your flesh and say well you know but you're still tempted and and you have a temper and you have bad thoughts and and unbelief and and you have to repent sure you do your flesh is not converted but it's no longer your ruler amen for we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit say yeah it's a black dog but it's a defeated black dog and we don't pet it and we don't feed it and every day we crucify it hallelujah don't deny the power of the gospel that you can live and overcome in life you see when you do that that empowers the black dog amen don't don't are you with me now that will empower the black dog let me tell you feed them the right things shun the appearance of evil repent turning from your beastly flesh and given lordship to the one who is filthy and but give the our lordship to the one who is king of kings and lord of lords amen we're not filthy who can't live right we have the power of god under salvation hallelujah he'll have a glorious church without spot or wrinkle delilah's looking for the power to turn us into a powerless people he's always she's always was trying probing here trying there to find the secret of her power i'll tell you what the secret of his power was was his covenant with god it was shown in the sign of seven locks now's the right vowel are you with me a man and when she cut off them locks she cut off his power when you cut off your covenant with god come on amen because you're to be a virgin church and we call when you cut off that covenant with god and you lose your prayer life amen and the holy spirit is absent from the church and there's no side of the king there no more and there's no more glorious to gods and hallelujahs and thank you jesus anymore and there's no more divine healing and miracles and signs and wonders in the church anymore that's the devil that's delilah cutting off your locks separating yourself from your covenant with god that gives you power power over unclean spirits unclean spirits that makes you live a filthy dirty life brother branham said she delight and i just want to say i wonder if it happened hasn't happened again and again and it just keeps repeating she's tipped the cup of her fornication into the mouths of god's church that's been raised up to show his signs and wonders as jesus last commandment was to do in mark 16 and we find she's taking god's little faithful group and organize them together that's exactly like like the way he did herself and she's got them standing stripped denying the power thereof denying the holy spirit denying the power to speak with tongues denying the power of the holy spirit to raise the dead heal the sick cast out devils and now the philistines are on us but in the midst of all of that when israel was rising and there she was coming out of babylon and here she would be such a rude woman she would actually hang her husband on a cross and crucify him but in the midst of all of that god raised up a virgin a zechariah an elizabeth and a mary and a chosen an anna and a simian and shepherds on the hill hallelujah in the midst of all of that god found him a little virgin group of people who would bring forth the messiah who would pray for christ hallelujah and that's what god's looking for today is a worm a womb that he can bring his life in nothing's also bringing out another perverted life but a church without spider-wrinkle think of that the bible said they walk with him in white for they are worthy it's the bride of the book of acts reintroduced this bride has been seen by vision and we're coming if we're not here we're coming if we're not there if we're still some of us come on now amen this out of step we're coming if some of us aren't marching yet to the tune of the gospel we're coming amen we're coming come on church if some of us have got out of step we're coming there's some hope here this evening that vision has placed you in a promise you've been seen in a vision this is greater than bill down going down to the blue border restaurant and seeing shaking brother brown's head and coming to light out from under an oxygen tent well and healthy to live for many more years after that as a 90 year old man this is more than that vision god had a vision of you hallelujah he saw the church as a pure virtuous bride start out in the beginning holy walking instead amen into the tune of the gospel onward christian soldier never backwards always over oh we're downward he saw her degenerate he saw her become and she moved into europe and become the lutheran and the presbyterian and the protestant churches and all of this and saw her there and she become a lewd woman but not as lewd as the last one finally these scenes are coming down and she's naked completely got a little something gray holding in her front dancing to the tune of rock and roll a denier of the power of god led by a witch come on amen and he said and i thought god after all that i've done after all that i preached and this is the best i have to offer you and he said all of a sudden when i was about to faint i heard that same music come again hallelujah and i looked and i saw the same one that was in the beginning
