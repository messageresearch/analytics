[0:01] [Music]
[0:06] I'm not on
[0:10] an ego trip.
[0:13] I'm nothing
[0:16] on my own.
[0:20] I made mistakes
[0:24] and often slipped. I'm just calling
[0:29] for fish and bone.
[0:31] [Music]
[0:33] But I'll prove someday
[0:38] just what I say.
[0:41] I'm of a special kind.
[0:46] [Music]
[0:48] Oh, while he was on the cross,
[0:55] I was on his mind.
[1:05] The look of love
[1:08] was on his face,
[1:12] the thorns
[1:14] on his head.
[1:17] [Music]
[1:18] Wood was on
[1:21] that scarlet robe and it was stained
[1:26] crimson
[1:28] red.
[1:31] Though his eyes were on the ground that
[1:36] day,
[1:38] he looked ahead
[1:41] in time.
[1:44] For while he was on the cross,
[1:51] you were on his mind.
[1:55] [Music]
[1:59] Yet he knew me.
[2:06] Yet he loved
[2:09] me.
[2:11] [Music]
[2:13] [Applause]
[2:14] He whose glory
[2:18] makes
[2:20] the heaven shine.
[2:23] [Music]
[2:25] I'm so unworthy
[2:33] of such mercy.
[2:40] For while he was on the cross,
[2:47] I was on his mind.
[2:52] For while he was on the cross,
[3:00] you were on
[3:03] his mind.
[3:06] [Music]
[3:07] [Applause]
[3:08] And so I'll cherish
[3:13] the old rugy
[3:16] cross
[3:20] until my tr
[3:23] [Applause]
[3:31] I will cling
[3:34] to the old rocky
[3:37] wrong
[3:40] [Music]
[3:42] and exchange
[3:44] it someday
[3:46] for a crown
[3:52] and exchange
[3:55] it someday
[3:57] for her.
[4:02] [Applause]
