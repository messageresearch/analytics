[52:03] good to have you in this service of the
[52:05] Lord today Matthew chap 17 and verse 14
[52:09] we're going to read from and when they
[52:12] had come to the multitude there came to
[52:15] him a certain man kneeling down to him
[52:17] and saying Lord have mercy on my son for
[52:22] he is lunatic and sorely vexed for often
[52:25] time he falleth into the the fire and
[52:27] often to the water and I brought to him
[52:30] th him to thy disciples and they could
[52:33] not cure him then Jesus answered and
[52:37] said oh faithless and perverse
[52:39] generation how long shall I be with you
[52:42] how long shall I suffer you bring him
[52:46] hither to me and Jesus rebuked the devil
[52:51] and he departed out of him and the child
[52:54] was cured from that very hour and then
[52:57] came the disciples to Jesus apart and
[53:00] saidh could we not cast him out and
[53:03] Jesus said unto them because of your
[53:06] unbelief for verily I say unto you if
[53:09] you have faith as a grain of mustard
[53:12] seed you shall say into this mountain
[53:14] remove hence To Yonder place and it
[53:17] shall remove and nothing shall be
[53:20] impossible to you amen God bless you can
[53:24] be seated
[53:27] I'd like
[53:28] you to turn to several more scriptures
[53:32] today um that I want to read that is
[53:35] along this same line of thought and I do
[53:39] this because we do have um you know
[53:42] didn't want you to stand in a long time
[53:44] so let's just go to Mark 11 and we're
[53:48] going to read from verse 12 today as
[53:51] well and then I have one over in Luke
[53:54] and John uh that we'll go to to today as
[53:57] we just kind of read some of these
[53:59] scriptures and prepare our hearts for
[54:02] the communion ahead and verse 12 says
[54:06] and on the tomorrow when they were come
[54:09] from Bethany he was hungry and see in a
[54:12] fig tree of far off having leaves he
[54:14] came if happily he might find anything
[54:17] therein and when he came to it he found
[54:20] nothing but leaves for the time of figs
[54:23] was not yet and
[54:27] and Jesus answered and said unto it no
[54:30] man eat fruit of thee Hereafter
[54:34] forever and his disciples heard it now
[54:37] down to verse 20 and in the morning as
[54:40] they passed by they saw the fig tree
[54:43] dried up from the roots and Peter called
[54:47] remembrance calling to remembrance said
[54:50] un him Master behold the Fig Tree which
[54:53] thou curses is withered away and Jesus
[54:57] answered and said unto them have faith
[55:00] in God for verily I say unto you that
[55:03] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[55:06] be thou removed and be thou cast in the
[55:09] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[55:12] shall believe that those things which he
[55:14] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[55:18] whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto
[55:22] you whatsoever things you desire what
[55:25] things soever you desire When you pray
[55:28] believe that you receive them and ye
[55:30] shall have them and then turn with me to
[55:34] Luke chap 17 and verse 5 and we're going
[55:38] to read from this passage of scripture
[55:41] now we've come from Matthew to Mark now
[55:45] Luke and the apostles said unto the Lord
[55:49] increase our faith and the Lord said if
[55:52] you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed
[55:57] you might say to this s sycamine tree be
[56:01] thou plucked up by the root and be thou
[56:03] planted in the sea and it should obey
[56:07] you and then go with me to John
[56:10] 14:12 and let's read from there very
[56:13] familiar scripture to us as Believers
[56:16] and I have another passage to read from
[56:18] John verely verily I say to you he that
[56:21] believeth on me how many are believers
[56:24] this morning the works that I do shall
[56:27] he do also and Greater Works than these
[56:31] shall he do because I go unto my father
[56:34] and whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[56:37] that will I do that the father may be
[56:40] glorified in the son if you ask anything
[56:44] in my name I will do it and then go with
[56:49] me to chapter 15 and verse 7 and we'll
[56:52] read this this scripture together and
[56:56] then go to the message if you abide in
[57:00] me and my words abide in you you shall
[57:04] ask what you will and it shall be done
[57:07] unto
[57:08] you what what powerful scriptures we
[57:11] have read this
[57:13] morning amen what what wonderful words
[57:17] that have been left for us in this day
[57:21] and this hour and I believe that are
[57:24] really pertinent for this time that
[57:26] we're
[57:27] in and I want to speak today on the
[57:30] mountain movers the Greater Works and
[57:33] maybe I'll speak more than once on this
[57:35] but we're just kind of going to go into
[57:37] some things today as we um consider
[57:41] these
[57:42] scriptures now Jesus as a second Adam of
[57:45] course what he spoke
[57:49] happened and and of course in in one
[57:52] sense Jesus was limited in that he could
[57:55] only do that which the father showed him
[57:57] to
[57:58] do and secondly there were things that
[58:02] he had to work against in his realm that
[58:06] of which he was working because the
[58:08] Earth was upon a curse and so you know
[58:11] he could not at this moment change us
[58:14] all back to young people and take away
[58:16] all trouble from the world because it
[58:19] was not that time of his work of
[58:23] redemption he would start with the soul
[58:25] of man
[58:27] and bring the kingdom of God within and
[58:30] promise you know a greater Kingdom to
[58:33] come but in yet he would walk in this
[58:36] realm of Kingdom Life and walking in
[58:40] this realm he would he would control the
[58:44] Demonic world he control the demons that
[58:47] would would get in winds he would
[58:49] control the winds and the waves uh and
[58:52] he would uh multiply fishes and Loaves
[58:55] and he would do everything like calling
[58:59] back from the dead or Healing The Sick
[59:02] he would show the power of his kingdom
[59:05] as you know as as he immediately began
[59:08] to go out and Minister and the first
[59:11] thing he began to do was cast out Devils
[59:14] showing that there was a kingdom that
[59:17] was coming that was greater than that
[59:20] Kingdom that was presently there and of
[59:24] course the Earth that he lived Liv upon
[59:26] as I said was different from the one
[59:28] that the first Adam lived upon there was
[59:31] no curse in Eden you see as I said the
[59:35] work of Jesus was to lift the soul of
[59:38] man from The Curse of sin and to take
[59:41] men who were born in sin and shapen in
[59:44] iniquity and make them into being sons
[59:47] of God with power and authority against
[59:51] Satanic rulers of this world now brother
[59:55] brandham and the
[59:56] um the great sermon of Christ the
[59:58] mystery shows us the plan of God how
[1:00:02] that God would reveal himself in a
[1:00:05] threefold um Revelation or three-fold
[1:00:08] purpose of his Plan of Redemption and it
[1:00:12] would be first to reveal himself in
[1:00:14] Christ so he would show in Christ what
[1:00:18] men and women were to be in God's
[1:00:21] kingdom and and I I want you to to stop
[1:00:25] for a moment and and bear in mind the
[1:00:27] kingdom is is coming but the kingdom is
[1:00:30] already here the kingdom is here in that
[1:00:34] we are people of that Kingdom in that
[1:00:38] that we have received the Holy Spirit of
[1:00:41] God in our life and the King sits upon
[1:00:44] the throne of our heart his kingdom has
[1:00:46] come within us the kingdom of God is
[1:00:50] within you that is the domain of the
[1:00:53] Holy Ghost and it is birth you into the
[1:00:57] citizenship of Heaven now so you see he
[1:01:01] would first reveal himself in Christ and
[1:01:04] we can see in Christ his attitude toward
[1:01:07] the sick we can see in Christ his
[1:01:10] attitude when he came and and faced
[1:01:13] demonic Powers he cast them out we see
[1:01:17] his attitude toward the lost in that he
[1:01:20] came to seek and to save that which was
[1:01:22] lost so whatever attitude was in Jesus
[1:01:25] Jesus Christ and shown in Jesus would be
[1:01:29] also shown in the other Sons and
[1:01:32] Daughters of his kingdom because
[1:01:34] remember he he did not just come in
[1:01:37] order for us to see God um you know just
[1:01:41] manifested and and then go away but he
[1:01:44] came to birth sons and daughters in his
[1:01:46] kingdom people who would be of his same
[1:01:49] genus of his same seed of his same life
[1:01:53] have his same power reside in within
[1:01:56] them and so you see in this great sermon
[1:02:00] of Christ and mystery he would he he
[1:02:02] explains that we first first he would
[1:02:05] reveal himself in Christ and then he
[1:02:08] would want to get preeminence in the
[1:02:11] people and of course he gets that
[1:02:13] preeminence by us being born again and
[1:02:16] the King sitting upon the throne of our
[1:02:19] hearts and then of course then you take
[1:02:22] them back to Eden
[1:02:26] so you see his three-fold purpose first
[1:02:29] reveal himself in Christ second to
[1:02:31] reveal him to get preeminence into the
[1:02:33] people his bride and then take them back
[1:02:37] to Eden this is God's great plan now
[1:02:40] there's a great misconception today that
[1:02:43] we're not to go back to Pentecost but
[1:02:45] rather we are to go back to Eden and
[1:02:47] when I say Pentecost I want you to
[1:02:49] remember we're talking about the book of
[1:02:51] Acts we're talking about the acts of the
[1:02:54] Holy Spirit we're talking about an Acts
[1:02:57] 2
[1:02:58] experience and so there's a
[1:03:00] misconception that we are not to go back
[1:03:02] to an Acts 2 experience but rather to go
[1:03:05] back to Eden and and yet that is God's
[1:03:10] goal it is true God will have an Eden
[1:03:13] upon the Earth for a great Millennial
[1:03:16] Reign but you see the only way for man
[1:03:20] to get there is by first going to back
[1:03:24] to Acts 2 back to Pentecost where God
[1:03:28] indwells man through the baptism of the
[1:03:31] Holy Ghost everyone will go back to Eden
[1:03:36] and and everyone who will will they can
[1:03:39] only do it by going through that acts
[1:03:42] two experience it is the the door it is
[1:03:46] the the doorway that Peter held the keys
[1:03:49] to to open up the key into the kingdom
[1:03:53] was to repentance through baptism in the
[1:03:56] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:03:59] of sin and receive the gift of the Holy
[1:04:02] Ghost which baptizes you into the
[1:04:06] kingdom of God where you become Kingdom
[1:04:10] hirs and citizens of the Kingdom now
[1:04:14] it's without argument that before the
[1:04:16] world is burned off and cleansed for the
[1:04:17] Millennium that Elijah is to turn the
[1:04:20] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:04:22] of the apostolic fathers this is a job
[1:04:25] job of the message it was to turn our
[1:04:28] hearts back to the faith of the
[1:04:31] apostolic Fathers as he said in birth
[1:04:34] pains read Malachi 4 and see if we're
[1:04:36] not supposed to have a message in the
[1:04:38] last day that had turned the hearts of
[1:04:40] the children back to their fathers back
[1:04:43] to the original Pentecostal message word
[1:04:47] by word and he says Brothers we are here
[1:04:51] this is what the message is about it's
[1:04:53] about turning your heart it's about
[1:04:55] bringing you back to the faith it's
[1:04:58] about restoring you to sunship it's
[1:05:01] about preparing a bride for for uh to to
[1:05:05] meet the bridegroom now but you see
[1:05:08] first he would restore man from his
[1:05:11] Fallen condition and establishing
[1:05:15] himself as the king in our hearts and
[1:05:18] eventually the Millennium and then once
[1:05:22] again the lion were laid down by the
[1:05:25] lamb and nothing shall H or destroy in
[1:05:28] my Holy Mountain but it's a bit
[1:05:30] precautious to say we're already back to
[1:05:34] Eden amen that's a bit precocious to say
[1:05:38] that because we're not there Amen in
[1:05:41] fact it's still a ways
[1:05:43] off amen there's a before there can be a
[1:05:46] millennium there has to be a
[1:05:48] resurrection amen there has to be the
[1:05:50] change of our bodies there has to be a
[1:05:53] Rapture there has to be a married supper
[1:05:56] of the lamb and then you know we come
[1:05:59] back in Revelation 19 to take the world
[1:06:02] over again the righteous walk out on the
[1:06:05] ashes of the wicked so we you see all of
[1:06:08] this has to be before we can get back to
[1:06:11] a full Eden condition but right now we
[1:06:16] operate in the realm of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:19] even though we operate in Fallen bodies
[1:06:24] and we will live in a fallen world and
[1:06:28] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:06:31] but against principalities and powers
[1:06:33] and and and powers of darkness and
[1:06:36] spiritual wickedness in high places and
[1:06:40] and I want you to say to you we don't do
[1:06:42] that without
[1:06:44] victory but there is a Victorious prde
[1:06:47] of Jesus Christ who is an overcomer in
[1:06:50] this day now you know when originally
[1:06:54] before man then the Earth was in an Eden
[1:06:58] condition and as king of the earth Adam
[1:07:01] spoke and he dressed the garden and
[1:07:04] nature obeyed his command God gave him
[1:07:08] dominion over the fish of the sea the
[1:07:10] foul of the air he gave him power to
[1:07:13] dress the garden now he would not do
[1:07:16] this by the sweat of his brow that would
[1:07:18] be a part of the curse that would come
[1:07:21] because of the Fall he would do this as
[1:07:24] Jesus did by the power of the word the
[1:07:27] second itam shows us that Jesus
[1:07:30] controlled you know controlled the the
[1:07:32] winds and the waves they obeyed him they
[1:07:35] obeyed Adam in the
[1:07:37] beginning amen all of that was all
[1:07:40] subject to him because he's a Son of God
[1:07:44] now but when man sinned the Earth fell
[1:07:48] with him and Adam lost dominion and
[1:07:54] Satan then takes his place as the prince
[1:07:58] of the power of
[1:07:59] atmospheres and man sold himself into
[1:08:02] sin and became subservient to the devil
[1:08:06] to sin to disease and
[1:08:09] sickness and and so you see when when
[1:08:12] man sinned it was like he crossed a
[1:08:15] great
[1:08:16] Chasm and and there was um as he crossed
[1:08:21] it there was no way to get back to God
[1:08:24] there was no way for
[1:08:26] Redemption every everything he had put
[1:08:29] himself in death on this side and and
[1:08:32] now he is there on the side he's now
[1:08:36] subject to the elements that he once
[1:08:39] controlled the wind and the waves and
[1:08:42] and the the storms now instead of uh him
[1:08:45] controlling it they controlled
[1:08:49] him just like the weather does today it
[1:08:52] controls you it'll control your mood
[1:08:54] it'll control the atmosphere about you
[1:08:57] it'll control what you do everything
[1:08:59] else is is and storms come and all of
[1:09:02] these things is because man talking
[1:09:05] about Adam gave that
[1:09:07] up and lost dominion and Satan becomes
[1:09:12] The Prince and the power of the air and
[1:09:14] he becomes the prince of this world
[1:09:16] Jesus calls him that he also becomes the
[1:09:19] God of this evil age which becomes
[1:09:22] worshiped by millions millions doing his
[1:09:26] his bidding now so he put himself by you
[1:09:30] know in in death on the side and he left
[1:09:32] himself no way back and so what God did
[1:09:37] because it was not yet time for the
[1:09:42] Messiah to come the Redeemer to come God
[1:09:45] gave them a temporary fix as it was a
[1:09:50] sacrifice a blood that he would receive
[1:09:55] th this because he said the day you eat
[1:09:57] thereof that day you die and so here a
[1:10:00] lamb would die in their
[1:10:03] place and through that Lamb's blood man
[1:10:06] could have fellowship with God but only
[1:10:08] with blood between
[1:10:10] them now I want you to remember there's
[1:10:13] coming A Day friends where we will
[1:10:15] fellowship with god without blood
[1:10:17] between
[1:10:19] us amen there's coming a time in the in
[1:10:23] the in the ages ahead in the Eternal
[1:10:26] ages ahead that there will be no blood
[1:10:29] between us there will there will be no
[1:10:32] veil of blood between us we'll stand
[1:10:36] there face to face with God but right
[1:10:38] now we have to have the blood between
[1:10:43] us now as we as we see this on one side
[1:10:48] you know he's a Son of God he's an
[1:10:50] offspring of God one side of the gasm
[1:10:53] he's a was an offspring of God
[1:10:55] uh in he had inheritance of the earth he
[1:10:58] could control nature he could speak into
[1:11:00] existence he was a Creator himself he
[1:11:03] was he was an offspring of God stop it
[1:11:07] for just a minute let's just go back in
[1:11:09] our thinking you know um dogs give birth
[1:11:12] to dogs cats give birth to cats humans
[1:11:15] give birth to humans
[1:11:19] God when he gives
[1:11:21] birth what does he give birth
[1:11:24] to another
[1:11:26] God Amen a little God a Son of God an
[1:11:31] offspring of
[1:11:34] God Amen God life is
[1:11:39] Multiplied amen so you see this is why
[1:11:42] the Bible said you know even of the
[1:11:45] prophets you are God's because the word
[1:11:48] of the Lord came to them now so you see
[1:11:52] on one side he's he's a Son of God he's
[1:11:54] an all springing from God he his
[1:11:57] inheritance is um of the earth he can
[1:12:01] control nature he can speak into
[1:12:03] existence he's a Creator himself but on
[1:12:06] the other side you know when he crossed
[1:12:09] the chasm and here comes this void
[1:12:13] between him and God he's separated from
[1:12:16] his
[1:12:17] sunship he's a sinner by Nature he's
[1:12:21] under the hands of De and Dominion of
[1:12:24] Satan and God took a sacrifice the
[1:12:28] chemistry of a blood and you know and
[1:12:30] yet the blood of bulls and goats could
[1:12:32] not could not remit sin it would only
[1:12:35] cover sin so the remembrance was there
[1:12:38] it's like if you had a red spot on your
[1:12:41] hand you cover it with wide the red is
[1:12:43] still there but you know it's just
[1:12:46] covered over with something you see
[1:12:48] there's still a a remembrance of it but
[1:12:51] you see here again God did something
[1:12:55] when he came he provided a bleach for
[1:13:01] sin amen his blood was of greater power
[1:13:05] than that of blood of bulls and
[1:13:07] goats you said well brother Tim you know
[1:13:10] under the blood of bulls and goats a
[1:13:12] illegitimate child couldn't come in the
[1:13:14] congregation of the Lord for 10
[1:13:16] Generations you know I I found out you
[1:13:19] know just studying some a little bit on
[1:13:22] genealogy that after 10 after about 10
[1:13:25] Generations they cannot pick up any
[1:13:27] jeans coming from
[1:13:30] there and so for 10
[1:13:33] Generations they can enter into the
[1:13:35] congregation of the Lord think of
[1:13:38] that but it's not so with the blood of
[1:13:43] Jesus the blood of Jesus I don't care if
[1:13:45] it's one generation away it doesn't
[1:13:48] matter if you're illegitimate born you
[1:13:50] don't know who your father is doesn't
[1:13:52] matter amen nothing that's right
[1:13:55] nothing of that is brought in the
[1:13:57] remembrance of God the bleach of God's
[1:14:01] blood so eradicate
[1:14:04] sin and yes you can go in the
[1:14:09] Rapture
[1:14:11] Hallelujah now you said oh brother Tim
[1:14:14] they can't make it in if they wern't
[1:14:15] born under sacred ceremonies of
[1:14:18] matrimony they can't make it in let me
[1:14:20] tell you if the blood of
[1:14:23] Jesus cannot take away that sin that you
[1:14:26] didn't even
[1:14:27] do it does not have the power it's no
[1:14:32] more better than the blood of bulls and
[1:14:33] goats it couldn't take away sin but this
[1:14:37] Blood removes every stain of sin no
[1:14:42] matter whether you did it your
[1:14:43] grandfather did it your mother did it
[1:14:46] doesn't matter the Gen genealogies
[1:14:48] before it's all wiped
[1:14:52] away and you are of a new gen
[1:14:56] amen you your old genus passes
[1:15:00] away you're no longer the son of so and
[1:15:03] so and so and so or daughter of so and
[1:15:05] so and so and so you recognize I am a
[1:15:09] son or daughter of almighty
[1:15:12] God I have been birth into his kingdom
[1:15:16] I'm his
[1:15:18] child and God Don't Make No
[1:15:23] Junk and ain't one of your names he'll
[1:15:26] ever take off The Book of Life the
[1:15:28] Lamb's Book of
[1:15:32] Life nothing read Romans 8 nothing can
[1:15:37] separate you from the love of
[1:15:42] God Amen he he's oh you say well brother
[1:15:45] Tim I've strayed way away from God he's
[1:15:48] going to go out after
[1:15:50] you goodness and Mercy's on your Trail
[1:15:55] he gonna find you somewhere he not g to
[1:15:57] leave you where he found you either he
[1:16:00] gonna lift you up out of that muck and
[1:16:02] restore you as a son or daughter of
[1:16:06] God now so then that sin is like putting
[1:16:12] into a tub of
[1:16:14] bleach and the coloring of sin when
[1:16:17] confessed sin goes into the bleach of
[1:16:20] God's blood the blood of Jesus well you
[1:16:24] know try to find
[1:16:26] it and when the coloring of sin goes
[1:16:29] back through the mediators and down to
[1:16:32] time
[1:16:33] until it hits the
[1:16:37] accuser and it lays on Satan unto the
[1:16:41] day of
[1:16:44] judgment who is he that condemned you
[1:16:47] certainly not God and the one who is
[1:16:50] trying to condemn you the very things
[1:16:53] that he's condemning you of lays back on
[1:16:56] his head and he will burn in hell for it
[1:17:00] and not
[1:17:02] [Applause]
[1:17:08] you that makes you The sinless Virtuous
[1:17:11] bride of Jesus Christ you never did it
[1:17:15] in the first
[1:17:19] place and again what was his first place
[1:17:22] his mind before the world
[1:17:26] began and the good thing about it is he
[1:17:30] can't change his mind about
[1:17:37] you what God thought no matter how low
[1:17:40] you are what God thought of
[1:17:45] you amen he's got to take and bring you
[1:17:48] up to matches what he
[1:17:53] thought and what did he think think just
[1:17:55] look in the word tells you over and over
[1:17:58] what he thinks of you so what happens to
[1:18:01] the sun once your sins are plunged in
[1:18:05] the bleach blood of Christ your sins you
[1:18:09] know lay on the accuser until the day of
[1:18:12] judgment but what happens to you as a
[1:18:15] son you become in perfect fellowship
[1:18:19] with the father
[1:18:23] again I I I want you to get that perfect
[1:18:26] fellowship with the father again
[1:18:29] standing on the other side of the
[1:18:32] chasm and let me just say it the chasms
[1:18:36] even done
[1:18:37] away it's totally
[1:18:39] obliviated and God do ever even remember
[1:18:42] there was a Chasm or you ever was
[1:18:45] separated from it cuz you always were
[1:18:48] his and you are his and you stand there
[1:18:52] not as a son with a past BL BL but a son
[1:18:56] or daughter of God without
[1:19:04] blemish so you come in perfect
[1:19:07] fellowship with no remembrance of sin
[1:19:10] against sh no stain of sin can be found
[1:19:16] anywhere you're
[1:19:18] free just as a Clorox could break up
[1:19:21] that ink until it couldn't be found no
[1:19:24] more and sent back to whatever form it
[1:19:27] was even so your sins once plunged in
[1:19:30] the blood of
[1:19:31] Jesus it breaks up through the blood of
[1:19:35] the
[1:19:37] mediator he so destroys it until there's
[1:19:41] not a shred of evidence against
[1:19:50] you I I know some of you are sitting
[1:19:53] there thinking well uh that that would
[1:19:56] take a a long long
[1:19:58] time sister jeie you were in the prayer
[1:20:01] line and three or four people right in
[1:20:03] front of
[1:20:05] you their sins called
[1:20:08] out you're Desiring a baby but if you'll
[1:20:11] give up that smoking God will give you
[1:20:13] that
[1:20:14] desire and then she comes along after as
[1:20:17] she repents and it can't be
[1:20:21] found no accusation no word
[1:20:26] same Angels there come on same
[1:20:29] discernments there same word is there
[1:20:31] same power is there and it finds
[1:20:33] nothing but just
[1:20:36] blessings just passing on a blessing
[1:20:38] that blessing still on your life
[1:20:41] today Hallelujah for he said I'll never
[1:20:44] leave you or I'll never forsake you and
[1:20:46] the same one that forgave your sins
[1:20:48] healed your
[1:20:52] body Hallelujah
[1:20:55] that's our
[1:20:56] God so it don't take a long time it
[1:21:00] takes one moment of confessing and
[1:21:02] believing sincerely
[1:21:05] say God I've been
[1:21:07] wrong forgive
[1:21:14] me so when sin is confessed and been
[1:21:18] dipped into the blood man or woman has
[1:21:21] been dipped into the blood of Jesus
[1:21:23] Christ we the blood is the Holy
[1:21:26] Ghost let's stop for a minute and
[1:21:28] explain when we talk about the blood
[1:21:30] we're talking about the spirit because
[1:21:33] we do not have a vial we do not have a
[1:21:36] vial of of blood like we have this vial
[1:21:39] of oil here we don't have a vial of
[1:21:42] blood that each one of them gets a touch
[1:21:44] of the
[1:21:46] blood amen but what do we have the Holy
[1:21:49] Spirit which is the life of the blood
[1:21:52] comes back upon you that's what we're
[1:21:55] doing when we anoint you with oil as the
[1:21:57] Bible said we are anointing you as a
[1:22:00] type as a symbol of the Holy
[1:22:03] Spirit and placing that between you and
[1:22:06] the sickness and the trouble that's
[1:22:07] causing that is that is upon you are you
[1:22:10] with me it's it's an action to cause a
[1:22:13] reaction but we don't have a vial of
[1:22:15] blood like I got this bottle of
[1:22:18] oil amen we have the Holy
[1:22:22] Spirit and when he comes into you you he
[1:22:25] annihilates
[1:22:28] sin and he'll even stand between you and
[1:22:35] sickness Hallelujah now so when a man or
[1:22:39] woman is dipped into the blood if once
[1:22:41] they when they when they're baptized
[1:22:44] into the spirit it kills all symptoms of
[1:22:48] sin and every molecule of sin goes back
[1:22:53] to the devil and is laid on him to the
[1:22:55] day of judgment where his eternal
[1:22:58] destination will be thrown into Lake of
[1:23:00] Fire and the chasm is bridged and never
[1:23:03] to come in remembrance
[1:23:06] again and a man stands
[1:23:10] Justified as a Son of
[1:23:12] God Justified means declared
[1:23:19] righteous now
[1:23:22] Moses would come under the the blood of
[1:23:26] the of that temporary blood that was
[1:23:29] given that could never take away sin
[1:23:32] Hebrews tells us the blood of bulls and
[1:23:34] goats could never take away
[1:23:36] sin and yet it is something now and let
[1:23:41] me just stop here and
[1:23:43] explain all of the Old Testament Saints
[1:23:47] would go into place called Abraham's
[1:23:50] bosom it would be a place also called
[1:23:53] Paradise
[1:23:55] and they would go into this place and
[1:23:57] they had to wait there until the
[1:23:59] Redeemer came that could deal with
[1:24:04] sin because the blood of bulls and goats
[1:24:07] only covered sin and only made a way for
[1:24:11] them to enter into this place until the
[1:24:14] real lamb would come now this is why
[1:24:17] John would come and say behold or look
[1:24:20] the Lamb of God that takes away the sin
[1:24:23] of the world
[1:24:25] because the blood of bulls and goats
[1:24:27] couldn't do
[1:24:30] it
[1:24:33] now Moses though standing under that
[1:24:36] blood he's under that Covenant and under
[1:24:39] that blood he can have fellowship with
[1:24:41] God under that blood with that blood
[1:24:43] between him he can operate in
[1:24:48] Realms a as as a as a as as a son of God
[1:24:54] and Moses under the blood of bulls and
[1:24:56] goats his blood can never take away sin
[1:24:59] but covered to the Messiah the Redeemer
[1:25:01] come but with his confession in the word
[1:25:04] of God God could take that simple man
[1:25:08] and put his words in his mouth and he
[1:25:11] proved he was Jehovah's servant for he
[1:25:14] would walk out there and Jehovah spoke
[1:25:16] to him by Vision he walked out stretched
[1:25:18] his arms his hands toward the East and
[1:25:20] and God spoke to him it's God's
[1:25:23] thought God God used this man so God
[1:25:25] spoke to him and he says go stretch out
[1:25:29] your that rod in your hand toward the
[1:25:31] East and say
[1:25:34] flies and Moses under the blood of bulls
[1:25:36] and goats walked out there with and took
[1:25:39] that stick reached toward the East and
[1:25:42] said thus sayith the Lord they come
[1:25:45] flies and walk back now it's already
[1:25:47] been
[1:25:49] spoke now remember when a word is
[1:25:51] released it can't return to God void
[1:25:56] see he walks on back it's already spoke
[1:25:58] it's a thought now it's spoke now it's
[1:26:00] expressed it's a word of God then then
[1:26:03] it it's come into human lips and a
[1:26:06] simple man under the blood of bulls and
[1:26:08] goats now then first thing you know
[1:26:11] maybe there's just a little green fly
[1:26:14] starts buzzing
[1:26:16] around don't look like any change next
[1:26:19] thing you know they're five pounds per
[1:26:22] yard
[1:26:24] amen why what was it was the word of God
[1:26:28] spoken through Moses the Creator because
[1:26:31] of the blood he was standing in the
[1:26:34] presence of God and his words wasn't his
[1:26:37] own
[1:26:39] words and so he's so again that's what
[1:26:43] Jesus said in John 15 if you abide in me
[1:26:48] and my words abide in
[1:26:51] you now stop a minute I want to I want
[1:26:55] to wipe something out of your
[1:26:57] mind because the reformers taught that
[1:27:01] abiding in Christ was spending so much
[1:27:04] time in study and prayer on your knees
[1:27:08] consecrating yourself and you know if
[1:27:10] you did that enough you could ask what
[1:27:12] you will you know and it shall be done
[1:27:15] but that is not what abiding in Christ
[1:27:18] is for him to abide in you and his words
[1:27:22] abide for you to abide in him and his
[1:27:25] words abide in in you is it comes by and
[1:27:29] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[1:27:34] every one of you who are spirit filled
[1:27:38] people today are right here abiding in
[1:27:42] Christ and he abides in you there is a
[1:27:45] Unity takes place you become one with
[1:27:49] God Inseparable from
[1:27:52] God come on nothing can separate you
[1:27:55] from
[1:27:56] him amen read Romans 8 again neither Li
[1:28:00] you know life or death nor
[1:28:02] principalities or powers or things to
[1:28:04] come or things in the past
[1:28:06] nothing can separate
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:13] you so if you abide in me and my words
[1:28:17] abide in you then ask what you
[1:28:22] will and it shall be be given to
[1:28:25] you now brother brandom asked a question
[1:28:29] after saying these kind of things is
[1:28:31] where is the church standing
[1:28:35] at and I want you to think of it a
[1:28:37] moment where where is it you're standing
[1:28:40] at if you've been filled with the spirit
[1:28:43] would you
[1:28:44] have if you have the Holy Ghost within
[1:28:47] you would you do if you are offspring of
[1:28:50] the Creator which you are if you are an
[1:28:54] offspring of God a little God which you
[1:28:57] are then you if you abide in me and my
[1:29:01] words abide in you
[1:29:05] ask what you will and it shall be given
[1:29:08] to you so where is the church standing
[1:29:11] at now you know there again Moses under
[1:29:14] the blood of bulls and goats Let There
[1:29:16] Be
[1:29:17] frogs maybe there wasn't a frog in the
[1:29:19] country in the hour's time they're 10
[1:29:22] foot deep in places
[1:29:26] now what is it it was God the Creator
[1:29:28] hiding himself in a simple
[1:29:31] man now so we asked ourselves a question
[1:29:36] if the blood of bulls and goat which can
[1:29:38] only cover could put a man in position
[1:29:42] to speak the creative word of God and
[1:29:44] bring flies into existence and why would
[1:29:47] we stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ
[1:29:50] blood who could speak a squirrel or
[1:29:52] something to in existence
[1:29:55] you see you see you don't want to

[1:30:41] Rapture it is the hour of
[1:30:44] exploits where the greatest and I want
[1:30:46] to just make this plain the greatest
[1:30:49] massive Divine Healing movement that's

[1:31:10] greatest Divine Healing move that
[1:31:13] there's ever
[1:31:15] been are you with me that is about to
[1:31:18] take place where even those who you
[1:31:22] can't find a a dimes worth of their body
[1:31:26] left is going to to come back together
[1:31:30] again yes sir and stand on their feet
[1:31:34] and the de of The Seven Ages from
[1:31:37] Calvary all the way to now is going to
[1:31:40] rise
[1:31:42] again and not only that but you if
[1:31:45] you're gray-headed you know you got
[1:31:47] artificial joints you got this you got
[1:31:49] that you're going to drop all of that

[1:32:03] sick and you'll get sick and die or
[1:32:05] whatever if you run up your time on the
[1:32:07] Earth but there well in that you it'll
[1:32:10] be a Divine Health that will sweep over
[1:32:12] you and you will be changed you'll never
[1:32:16] have a cold a headache a trouble a
[1:32:22] sorrow amen and we are on the cusp of
[1:32:26] the greatest massive Divine Healing that
[1:32:29] has ever taken place you say it's all
[1:32:33] over I say it hadn't even begun yet
[1:32:39] good now we see this age that we're
[1:32:43] living in and we were told and how can I
[1:32:46] overcome that it's one of the grandest
[1:32:48] of all
[1:32:49] ages this leoan is the grandest of all
[1:32:53] Church ages
[1:32:54] because it's the ending of time and the
[1:32:57] blending of
[1:32:59] Eternity I mean if we went into the
[1:33:01] seventh seal and we see the breaking of
[1:33:03] the silence there which I won't spend a
[1:33:05] lot of times there but just saying you
[1:33:07] know it's there that the incense is
[1:33:09] offered and and and mixed and and goes
[1:33:13] up into the presence of God and prayers
[1:33:15] are answered that have been waiting for
[1:33:18] his coming and his end time plan is all
[1:33:21] set in motion and there ain't enough the
[1:33:23] devil can do to stop
[1:33:26] it once it's open it can't be closed
[1:33:29] back
[1:33:30] up come on so it's the greatest it is
[1:33:34] the greatest age because it's the ending
[1:33:37] of time and the blending of Eternity now
[1:33:40] what what I even saying there is because
[1:33:43] you know if it's
[1:33:45] blending that means that you know that
[1:33:48] we are moving coming more like that
[1:33:52] eternal
[1:33:54] right so rather than less
[1:33:57] Faith less
[1:33:59] healing less
[1:34:02] miraculous the closer we get to it we
[1:34:05] are blending into it becoming more like
[1:34:09] the Eternal so don't expect less expect
[1:34:17] more amen we already see it now so let's
[1:34:21] just expect more
[1:34:26] amen we know as far as the world you
[1:34:29] hadn't seen nothing
[1:34:34] yet the worst is yet to
[1:34:38] come well for you the worst is not yet
[1:34:41] to come The Best Is Yet To
[1:34:44] Come amen we are not going down we're
[1:34:48] going
[1:34:50] up you know read read revelation chapter
[1:34:54] 12 Satan is cast down and as he does a
[1:34:57] people
[1:34:58] ascends so you're not a part of the
[1:35:00] Fallen World you're part of the
[1:35:02] ascending
[1:35:05] world so one blends to the other and
[1:35:07] we're standing on the cusp or the edge
[1:35:09] of Eternity on the cusp of Eden where
[1:35:12] all wrongs will be
[1:35:15] wred where full Sons speak and their
[1:35:17] words are back we full sons are robe
[1:35:21] position adopted with a ring of
[1:35:24] authority that and has that ring of
[1:35:26] authority and take every Power that
[1:35:29] Satan has away from him and that's not
[1:35:32] something just coming that is
[1:35:36] here that's what's been
[1:35:39] released so markk 11:24 says whatsoever
[1:35:42] you whatever you say to this mountain
[1:35:45] move and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:35:47] believe what you said will come to pass
[1:35:49] you can have what you said
[1:35:55] and brother brandham reads that
[1:35:56] scripture and he again asks the question
[1:36:00] where is the Pentecostal church at today
[1:36:04] you don't realize that confess truly
[1:36:07] confess sin amid
[1:36:09] sins it builds a bridge across this
[1:36:12] Chasm that takes a man back in the
[1:36:15] presence of his creator and makes him a
[1:36:17] Son of God Amen he that believeth on me
[1:36:20] the works that I do shall he do also
[1:36:22] there you are barely I say to you if you
[1:36:24] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:36:26] doubt in your heart but believe what
[1:36:27] You' said come to pass you can have what
[1:36:29] you said glory to God it's my God
[1:36:32] revealing himself in humility God taking
[1:36:35] a humble
[1:36:37] Sinner and cleansing him by his blood
[1:36:40] and dropping that confessed sin into the
[1:36:43] Clorox bleach of the blood of the Son of
[1:36:45] God and putting his own life into that
[1:36:48] man by the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:52] Ghost how many believes You' received
[1:36:55] that so he asked the question then if we
[1:36:58] have the genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:37:00] Ghost what's wrong with
[1:37:05] us when Elijah dropped the robe for
[1:37:09] Elija he's got a double portion of it
[1:37:11] Jesus said the works that I do shall you
[1:37:13] do also and greater than less shall you
[1:37:15] do for I go to my father what's wrong
[1:37:18] church and I I just want to
[1:37:21] say you know
[1:37:25] the question is asked at the river where
[1:37:27] is the god of
[1:37:29] Elijah well the answer is he's right
[1:37:32] here in Sons and Daughters of
[1:37:35] God come on I mean you're looking for
[1:37:39] him to come you're looking for a move
[1:37:41] Yonder but he's already here in bright
[1:37:44] form where is he he's
[1:37:47] here now take what has been given to you
[1:37:52] and strike the
[1:37:54] river if there's something uncrossable
[1:37:57] in your life a sickness a trouble a
[1:38:00] trial some child out of the out of the
[1:38:02] way go and take and strike it with that
[1:38:06] mantle the holy spirit that has been
[1:38:09] left to you from Jesus Christ and strike
[1:38:12] that River and walk
[1:38:14] across you're not going to drown in this
[1:38:16] you're not going to fail you're not
[1:38:19] going to have to get a rad booat and get
[1:38:21] across amen you'll walk across cross
[1:38:24] your
[1:38:26] River
[1:38:28] now this is the hour of perfect
[1:38:34] Faith come on why would it be preached
[1:38:37] perfect faith if that's
[1:38:39] unattainable if we couldn't have it or
[1:38:42] if we don't have
[1:38:46] it I thought Malachi 4 was to turn our
[1:38:49] hearts back to
[1:38:50] Faith and why wouldn't it be a perfect
[1:38:52] faith
[1:38:55] well when we get it no we have
[1:38:58] it I'm trying to bring this to for you
[1:39:01] to understand you know it's not
[1:39:03] something just for the for the past it's
[1:39:06] not something for the future it's
[1:39:07] something now yes
[1:39:09] sir now faith gets you into the family
[1:39:13] of God and makes you a literal son or
[1:39:16] daughter of God faith makes it possible
[1:39:19] to please
[1:39:21] God you know when we believe it releases
[1:39:25] God's
[1:39:26] righteousness Abraham believed God and
[1:39:29] it was imputed to him as righteousness
[1:39:31] so when we believe we're
[1:39:35] righteous amen Faith makes it possible
[1:39:38] to please
[1:39:39] God remember Enoch had to please God to
[1:39:43] go in a
[1:39:43] Rapture Faith makes that
[1:39:46] possible amen but but faith gets you
[1:39:49] into the family of God and makes you a
[1:39:51] literal son and daughter of God I want I
[1:39:53] want to take two takeaways from the
[1:39:55] scripture first John 5 And1 whosoever
[1:39:58] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[1:40:01] born of
[1:40:02] God and everyone that loveth him that Lo
[1:40:06] that begat loveth him also that is
[1:40:08] begotten of him so two takeaways I want
[1:40:11] you to get we are born of
[1:40:14] God therefore we're begotten of
[1:40:17] him so you are now a begotten son
[1:40:25] the Bible says now we are the sons of
[1:40:28] God so 1 John 3 And1 says look this is
[1:40:32] the love or look here's the
[1:40:36] love the the love first 1 John 31 but
[1:40:40] what manner of love or here's the love
[1:40:43] that the father has bestowed upon us
[1:40:46] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:40:48] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:40:50] because it knew him not but beloved now
[1:40:55] somebody say now we are the sons of God
[1:40:59] it doesn't appear what we shall be but
[1:41:01] we know that when he shall appear we
[1:41:05] shall be like
[1:41:06] him for we shall see him as he
[1:41:10] is I like that now amen I really like
[1:41:14] that because it places you right now as
[1:41:19] sons of God not
[1:41:21] future right now
[1:41:24] and yet it don't all appear yet what we
[1:41:27] shall
[1:41:29] be and you can look at yourself but I
[1:41:32] got this imperfection and I've got that
[1:41:34] no it's not so much an imperfection it's
[1:41:38] you are
[1:41:39] growing you are
[1:41:42] rising and as you rise there you become
[1:41:46] more like
[1:41:47] him are you with me amen you begin to
[1:41:51] look more like your father every
[1:41:55] day you begin to behave more like your
[1:41:58] father every day but now we are
[1:42:02] Sons amen yet it doesn't appear yet what
[1:42:05] we shall be but we know
[1:42:07] this but we know this though that we
[1:42:11] know this when we see
[1:42:14] him we will be just like
[1:42:18] him amen I may not be complete and
[1:42:21] mature and and everything and image yet
[1:42:24] but I
[1:42:25] will because when I see him I'm going to
[1:42:28] be just like
[1:42:30] him Hallelujah there won't be any
[1:42:32] Misfits in heaven amen will everyone be
[1:42:36] Sons and Daughters of God with
[1:42:38] attributes that look like our
[1:42:41] father
[1:42:43] amen now once you are in the
[1:42:48] family everything that belongs to the
[1:42:51] family is yours
[1:42:58] let me say that again once you're in the
[1:43:01] family then everything that belongs to
[1:43:04] the family is
[1:43:07] yours now it's like in Luke 15:31 he's
[1:43:10] speaking to the brother the prodal here
[1:43:13] and he said to him son thou art ever
[1:43:16] with me and all that I have is
[1:43:20] thine so this is this is sunship
[1:43:24] amen I you're always with me and
[1:43:27] everything I have is
[1:43:29] yours did this this is the order of
[1:43:33] sunship Amen I'm always with you I'll
[1:43:36] never leave you or forsake you amen and
[1:43:39] all that I have is
[1:43:43] yours now you see he could add the fatty
[1:43:47] cap anytime he
[1:43:49] wanted he could add the ni's robe
[1:43:51] anytime he wanted can add the ring on
[1:43:53] his finger anytime he want he can have a
[1:43:56] party in the celebration anytime he want
[1:43:58] all that I have is
[1:44:00] thine every promise in the word is
[1:44:07] yours it's your
[1:44:09] inheritance it belongs to you you're in
[1:44:11] the family the Bible said and I'm
[1:44:14] reading this from the Amplified but in
[1:44:15] Romans 8:17 if we're his children then
[1:44:18] we are his heirs
[1:44:21] also and Heirs of God and fellow HS with
[1:44:24] Christ sharing in his inheritance with
[1:44:26] him only we must share his suffering if
[1:44:29] we're to share his glory so he tells us
[1:44:32] we we're his children and we're also
[1:44:36] HS again everything that God has is
[1:44:40] ours go to Ephesians chapter 1 and three
[1:44:43] and and again I I share this translation
[1:44:46] praise be to God for giving us through
[1:44:48] Christ every possible spiritual benefit
[1:44:51] as citizens of Heaven
[1:44:54] so as a citizen of Heaven amen you have
[1:44:57] every possible spiritual
[1:45:04] benefit amen come on verse three says
[1:45:09] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:45:10] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:45:13] with
[1:45:16] all spiritual
[1:45:18] blessings where in Heavenly places in
[1:45:22] our position in Christ as a son as a
[1:45:26] daughter we have been
[1:45:30] blessed with all spiritual
[1:45:35] blessings Hallelujah you're
[1:45:40] blessed
[1:45:41] amen now that we're in the family we
[1:45:44] must take our place as sons and
[1:45:46] daughters and act like what we are and
[1:45:51] have amen and the moment you received
[1:45:54] God's Sweet Holy Spirit you became a
[1:45:57] possessor of eternal life and everything
[1:46:00] in it are connected with it is
[1:46:04] yours so he says in first John
[1:46:09] 51 he says and this is a record that God
[1:46:13] has given us eternal life and this life
[1:46:17] is in his son so first of all it's his
[1:46:21] it is the life of Jesus Christ chist is
[1:46:23] coming to you that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:46:25] is it is the literal life of Jesus
[1:46:28] Christ it's not a jump it's not a dance
[1:46:31] it's not a run in the aisle it's not a
[1:46:32] tongue is not a gift it is his
[1:46:38] life so he has given us eternal life and
[1:46:41] that life is in his son he that hath his
[1:46:45] son ha
[1:46:47] life and him that ha not the Son of God
[1:46:50] had not not life and these things that
[1:46:53] written to you that you believe on the
[1:46:54] name of the son of God that you might
[1:46:56] know that you have eternal life God's
[1:46:59] own life and that you may believe on the
[1:47:01] name of the son of
[1:47:03] God so a believing one possesses the
[1:47:07] life of God within his soul and makes
[1:47:10] him literally actually a child of God
[1:47:15] we're not going to be children of God
[1:47:18] we're not someday going to be
[1:47:20] offsprings now we are the sons
[1:47:23] and because we are now everything Heaven
[1:47:26] owns is
[1:47:28] ours come on everything the life of
[1:47:32] Jesus is in
[1:47:34] us not a third person the person God
[1:47:39] himself come dwelling in you deity
[1:47:43] tabernacling in your life that's who you
[1:47:46] are that's what sunship
[1:47:49] means now it's not a question of Faith
[1:47:52] it's a question of have taken our
[1:47:55] place
[1:47:57] hello of acting the part of enjoying our
[1:48:00] rights and privileges as Sons and
[1:48:02] Daughters of God living according to
[1:48:05] unseen
[1:48:08] realities where we're walking by faith
[1:48:10] not by sight where we're looking at that
[1:48:13] other dimension not looking at where
[1:48:15] we're at remember we're in the greatest
[1:48:18] sinful age there ever was so it's all
[1:48:21] obvious what's out here but we got to
[1:48:23] walk according to an Unseen World we are
[1:48:26] looking to the
[1:48:29] Unseen and what was seen and the Unseen
[1:48:32] come on the word tells you what was seen
[1:48:35] in the
[1:48:38] Unseen so we we can look in there and we
[1:48:40] can look in the Unseen and we can see
[1:48:43] and that's what brother bradam taught us
[1:48:45] he said you know you set before yourself
[1:48:47] a vision of a perfectly healed person
[1:48:52] and step by step you walk into that what
[1:48:55] is it you're looking at the
[1:48:57] Unseen what does not appear now when we
[1:49:00] look at what we see we're not looking at
[1:49:03] what we see we're looking to the
[1:49:05] Unseen and we're seeing ourselves
[1:49:08] perfectly well healed delivered set
[1:49:15] free now after you're born again you do
[1:49:19] exercise Faith but it's an unconscious
[1:49:21] Faith but brother brandham told us it's
[1:49:23] a faith just like getting in your
[1:49:25] automobile and starting up there and you
[1:49:28] know hitting the button and starting it
[1:49:29] up what is it it's it's you you do do
[1:49:34] that
[1:49:35] unconsciously you expect it to happen
[1:49:39] and when you're a son or daughter of God
[1:49:41] you you you know you just expect it to
[1:49:44] happen you expect miracles CU God is a
[1:49:47] god of Miracles you expect healing
[1:49:51] because it's promised to you as a child
[1:49:53] of God you expect Deliverance you expect
[1:49:57] salvation for your CH children come on
[1:50:00] you expect
[1:50:02] it amen because you it's an unconscious
[1:50:06] faith we know God's going to do this
[1:50:09] this is his word it's already done you
[1:50:12] don't think of your faith or how much
[1:50:17] you do or don't
[1:50:19] have we're not to be occupied this is
[1:50:22] brother brandom's word on a on a Prayer
[1:50:24] card uh you know his prayer letter that
[1:50:27] he sent out prayer CLA with said we're
[1:50:28] not to be occupied with our feelings or
[1:50:32] our symptoms or our faith or our lack of
[1:50:36] faith now here comes it here we come do
[1:50:39] I have enough faith for this we're not
[1:50:42] to be occupied with that that's not that
[1:50:45] that will hinder you where you're at
[1:50:47] don't look to see if your faith is
[1:50:49] strong enough for
[1:50:51] this you don't not like David he didn't
[1:50:54] look to see if his
[1:50:57] slingshot would would would work
[1:51:00] perfectly amen he had faith in almighty
[1:51:03] God Amen he was trusting in the god of
[1:51:07] Israel amen his eye was not on how big
[1:51:10] the giant
[1:51:12] was but on how big his God was and
[1:51:16] that's where your eyes has got to be is
[1:51:18] on how big is my God how able is he to
[1:51:25] save oh my children brother he can reach
[1:51:28] further down than what you can look up
[1:51:31] so look up to him amen from the ends of
[1:51:34] the Earth look up to him and be
[1:51:37] saved amen so we are not to be occupied
[1:51:41] with our
[1:51:43] feelings or our
[1:51:45] symptoms or our faith or our lack of
[1:51:50] faith but only what God Said
[1:51:54] amen the simple way he said is to begin
[1:51:57] calling the things we have prayed for
[1:52:00] ours so you begin right there the things
[1:52:03] you prayed for that's mine I already
[1:52:06] possess
[1:52:06] it it's mine amen and you thank God for
[1:52:11] them before you feel them or see the
[1:52:14] answer so you go right on your
[1:52:17] unconscious there's no thought we oh it
[1:52:20] won't work today
[1:52:23] amen you know I'm Out Of Tune I'm out of
[1:52:27] touch you know my faith isn't big enough
[1:52:29] that's not what you think on you think
[1:52:30] on this one thing my God's big
[1:52:33] enough my God is able my God has said
[1:52:37] this I'm just taking him at his word and
[1:52:40] the Hand of Faith reaches out and takes
[1:52:44] it
[1:52:45] amen amen I don't have to beg for it I
[1:52:49] don't have to plead for it
[1:52:52] you don't have to coers God into giving
[1:52:55] it to
[1:52:56] you amen you don't have like Smith
[1:52:59] Wigglesworth said one time said men have
[1:53:02] become excellent Beggars and poor
[1:53:06] Believers quit begging God and start
[1:53:08] believing
[1:53:09] God and start confessing that and look
[1:53:12] to the
[1:53:13] Unseen not looking at your symptom not
[1:53:16] looking at how you feel but what did God
[1:53:19] say occupy yourself with one thing
[1:53:22] saying my God is able my God gave this
[1:53:27] to me I am his son I am blood wash Blood
[1:53:32] Bought I belong to him this is mine it's
[1:53:36] my inheritance it's my promise and
[1:53:39] that's all I'm looking at I don't care
[1:53:42] I'm not looking to see if symptoms got
[1:53:44] worse or better I'm not looking and see
[1:53:47] if my child's doing better today or
[1:53:49] worse I'm not looking at circumstances
[1:53:52] I'm looking at a Divine
[1:54:00] promise now where you will stagger is
[1:54:03] when you start looking at the
[1:54:06] problem look at God's
[1:54:10] word I'm the Lord God that heals of all
[1:54:13] thy diseases and they shall be there and
[1:54:16] their offsprings with them your children
[1:54:19] will be blessed in the land
[1:54:24] come on all of these promises that lays
[1:54:27] there in the scripture they're
[1:54:30] yours amen he promises the Holy Ghost to
[1:54:33] everyone that ask
[1:54:35] him I won't disappoint you and give you
[1:54:37] a fish you ask for a fish I give you a
[1:54:40] serpent I ask for bread I'll give you a
[1:54:42] stone I won't disappoint you I'm a good
[1:54:46] father I'll give the Holy Ghost to
[1:54:48] everyone that ask
[1:54:49] him so we come to the attitude with God
[1:54:53] you made the
[1:54:54] promise and I'm just going to take
[1:54:57] it I'm just going to reach out and say
[1:55:00] it's mine thank you for it Hallelujah
[1:55:04] those would you know seeking the Holy
[1:55:06] Ghost would just come with that attitude
[1:55:07] and say thank you Jesus thank you Lord
[1:55:10] the promise is mine there's no way you
[1:55:13] will keep it from me my sins are under
[1:55:15] the blood I am a Blood Washed child and
[1:55:18] I am claiming that promise fill me with
[1:55:20] the Holy Ghost God is obligated to his
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:34] word part of your
[1:55:36] repentance is
[1:55:38] repenting of considering your own
[1:55:41] problems bigger than
[1:55:44] God your own
[1:55:46] sins bigger than
[1:55:50] God bigger than Grace
[1:55:53] you don't think of your faith how
[1:55:56] much you do or don't have I don't know
[1:56:00] if I have enough faith for
[1:56:03] this
[1:56:05] no you don't occupy with that you won't
[1:56:09] put your eyes on one thing look into the
[1:56:13] Unseen you have to deny what you're
[1:56:16] seeing here oh yeah it's evident your
[1:56:19] eyes are saying and you know you got
[1:56:21] problems you're
[1:56:22] sick there's there's there's trouble
[1:56:26] amen I mean you know we're not going in
[1:56:28] this fantasy world and saying oh it
[1:56:30] ain't there it's there but we're not
[1:56:33] looking at
[1:56:34] that the Bible said Abraham considered
[1:56:37] not his body now dead nor the deadness
[1:56:40] of Sarah see he didn't consider that he
[1:56:43] didn't put it in the equation he looked
[1:56:45] at one thing God
[1:56:47] said I'm going to have a son
[1:56:52] and I'm just going to walk with him till
[1:56:54] I have
[1:56:55] it I'm going to walk right into it it's
[1:56:58] coming if it ain't today it'll be
[1:57:00] tomorrow if it ain't tomorrow it'll be
[1:57:02] next week if it ain't next week it'll be
[1:57:03] next week but whatever is on the way I'm
[1:57:06] looking at the Unseen God says it's
[1:57:09] already here it's already done it's
[1:57:11] already
[1:57:13] finished now so we're not to be occupied
[1:57:16] with our feelings our symptoms our faith
[1:57:19] or lack of it but only with what God
[1:57:21] Said the simple way is begin to call
[1:57:23] things that we've prayed for hours thank
[1:57:27] God before we feel them or see the
[1:57:28] answer God is faithful he cannot deny
[1:57:32] himself the word of God says when you
[1:57:35] pray
[1:57:38] believe so mark 11:24 tells us that we
[1:57:43] we must believe that we have the answer
[1:57:46] even though we don't see it yet nor feel
[1:57:50] it yet
[1:57:53] 1 John 5:14 whosoever is born of God
[1:57:56] overcometh the world and this is the
[1:57:58] victory that overcometh the world even
[1:58:00] our faith and we know that he hears us
[1:58:05] whatsoever we ask we know we have our
[1:58:08] petitions that we have desired of him
[1:58:10] look at what he's saying he he says when
[1:58:13] we ask we already
[1:58:15] know we got it because he said ask
[1:58:19] anything in my name and I'll do it
[1:58:24] now God said faith
[1:58:30] is not that's Hebrews 11:1 faith
[1:58:34] is not faith shall
[1:58:37] be or that would be only hoping for and
[1:58:41] hope isn't faith hope is an expectation
[1:58:43] but it's not Faith you see is is hoping
[1:58:47] that somehow it'll come to be but faith
[1:58:49] says it's already is
[1:58:52] you see you see so
[1:58:55] faith not shall be for that would be
[1:58:58] only hoping for and not present as
[1:59:00] believing and having faith begins
[1:59:04] now
[1:59:06] now so you think of God's ability his
[1:59:10] provision in you through the new birth
[1:59:12] you think of his faithfulness to make
[1:59:14] his word good to your
[1:59:16] experience but for many of us our focus
[1:59:19] is on our faith or the lack of it rather
[1:59:22] than God's ability in US of his
[1:59:25] Provisions for us through the new birth
[1:59:29] you're not to think of your faith of how
[1:59:31] much you have or don't have in fact the
[1:59:33] matter is if you're weak you are to
[1:59:38] say I'm
[1:59:41] strong exactly right that's what you to
[1:59:44] say you are
[1:59:46] declare in the face of weakness that
[1:59:50] you're strong so you're not to be
[1:59:53] occupied with feelings or symptoms of of
[1:59:56] or faith or lack of it but only what God
[2:00:00] Said So we live by faith but it's an
[2:00:02] unconscious faith when God tells you
[2:00:05] something you don't think of your faith
[2:00:07] like I said you lack of it think of
[2:00:09] God's ability and provision simply take
[2:00:11] him at his word because we know this he
[2:00:15] cannot
[2:00:18] lie if God says something it is
[2:00:24] so it is
[2:00:27] so and if it was provided by the new
[2:00:30] birth you can have it you already have
[2:00:33] it you see again the Bible said in
[2:00:38] Galatians what is Galatians 2:20 that we
[2:00:41] live by the faith of the Son of
[2:00:45] God so I want to ask you when you're
[2:00:48] born again having been crucified with
[2:00:51] Christ never yet I live but not I but
[2:00:54] Christ liveth in me and the life I live
[2:00:57] now in the
[2:00:59] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[2:01:03] God so I am living this life with God's
[2:01:08] faith with the faith of Jesus if you
[2:01:10] have the life of Jesus and the nature of
[2:01:14] Jesus then you have the faith of
[2:01:17] Jesus so again what are you talking
[2:01:20] about your faith
[2:01:23] I got to check and see if my faith is
[2:01:24] good well are you born again well if
[2:01:27] you're born again well what kind of
[2:01:29] faith is that that is the faith of Jesus
[2:01:32] so do you have enough or
[2:01:34] not is the faith of Jesus enough for
[2:01:38] this or
[2:01:42] not now so if it was provided by the new
[2:01:46] birth which it is you have it that's
[2:01:49] right you don't have to
[2:01:52] you know anything provided by the new
[2:01:54] birth whether you know okay let's just
[2:01:57] stop for a minute you say well Divine
[2:01:59] Healing okay Jesus made it clear when
[2:02:02] the sanan woman came to him and asked
[2:02:07] for healing for her daughter now she was
[2:02:09] a woman outside the Covenant she she was
[2:02:13] not under the blood even of bulls and
[2:02:15] goats she was a heathen Pagan woman a
[2:02:17] Grecian
[2:02:18] woman from and and she's Phoenician and
[2:02:23] here she comes and she wants healing for
[2:02:26] her daughter so she's grievously vexed
[2:02:29] with the devil and Jesus said it is not
[2:02:33] right to give the children's bread are
[2:02:36] healing to
[2:02:40] dogs amen all right so he said now
[2:02:44] listen you're you're a gentile and this
[2:02:47] this bread healing belongs to those
[2:02:51] under the blood
[2:02:53] under the Covenant and at that time the
[2:02:55] Covenant was blood of bulls and goats
[2:02:58] that was the approach to God somebody
[2:03:00] with me now amen so healing is the
[2:03:04] children's
[2:03:07] bread so you're not asking for something
[2:03:10] that doesn't belong to you you are
[2:03:13] asking for something that is rightfully
[2:03:16] yours
[2:03:23] it's what the children
[2:03:26] eat the children get bread and if you're
[2:03:29] outside the Covenant and we'll have the
[2:03:31] right attitude and will'll just humble
[2:03:34] down and say like she did well but
[2:03:37] Master even dogs lick the
[2:03:41] crumbs that are under the master's
[2:03:44] table come on Amen I I even dogs get
[2:03:49] crumbs so if the dogs get crumbs that
[2:03:52] dogs get healing
[2:03:53] too so she placed herself in the line of
[2:03:58] receiving through her
[2:04:03] humility but I want you to know it
[2:04:06] rightfully belongs to
[2:04:10] you you can have bread anytime you ask
[2:04:15] it he Saidi a good father if you ask me
[2:04:17] bread you think I'll give you a serpent
[2:04:21] a snake you think I'll give you a
[2:04:24] scorpion you think I'll give you bad
[2:04:27] some something bad now he said if you
[2:04:30] are evil father men and you know how to
[2:04:32] do good for your children you know what
[2:04:35] it means to be a good father what the
[2:04:37] heavenly father give you the Holy Spirit
[2:04:41] won't he give you that healing that
[2:04:44] miracle that desire he wants to do it he
[2:04:48] just says come knock and it'll be given
[2:04:51] to you
[2:04:52] come seek and you're going to find just
[2:04:55] ask me you're going to
[2:04:58] receive now so you simply take him at
[2:05:02] his word knowing he can't
[2:05:07] lie you know it was if it was provided
[2:05:11] by the new birth you have it you don't
[2:05:13] have to claim it by faith you already
[2:05:15] have
[2:05:17] it you
[2:05:20] you even you don't even have a right to
[2:05:23] it you have
[2:05:25] it it it's a it's a spiritual unseen
[2:05:29] reality you you don't have to believe
[2:05:31] for any of it you just need to act on it
[2:05:34] in other words right to check
[2:05:37] out that's all you have to do the
[2:05:39] money's
[2:05:42] there amen it's the posit in the Bank of
[2:05:45] Heaven Jesus Paid It
[2:05:49] All and there's enough
[2:05:53] it'll never run out brother Brandon
[2:05:55] would say you know are you like a little
[2:05:57] mouse eating a grain a day going to
[2:05:59] allow and say I could better not take
[2:06:01] very much why you got a whole Grainery
[2:06:03] full you'll never run out eat till
[2:06:06] you're
[2:06:08] fat amen little fish in the ocean I
[2:06:11] better drink sparingly of this water
[2:06:13] I'll run out water one day you could
[2:06:14] never drink it up in in a million
[2:06:17] billion trillion fish
[2:06:19] lifetimes you cannot EX ex the goodness
[2:06:22] of
[2:06:23] God come on Amen you cannot exhaust his
[2:06:27] mercies cannot exhaust his
[2:06:30] grace I'm talking to you Sons and
[2:06:35] Daughters now so right to check
[2:06:39] out what was wrong with the isua what
[2:06:42] was wrong with the isua
[2:06:43] church they had the Holy Spirit but it
[2:06:46] was on their human spirit and they use
[2:06:49] it maybe just to blow the whistle dance
[2:06:51] around a little bit but I want to remind
[2:06:54] you we are beyond that we have the
[2:06:59] supernatural Supreme
[2:07:02] token now when I say we're beyond that I
[2:07:04] don't mean you can't blow it out the
[2:07:06] whistle no
[2:07:07] more I don't mean you don't dance and
[2:07:10] Shout I don't mean you don't rejoice in
[2:07:13] God but what I'm meaning is is that we
[2:07:16] have even more than that we can we can
[2:07:20] move that tra down the road now you see
[2:07:24] just like I I preached about the hour of
[2:07:26] true worship the other day and G Jesus
[2:07:29] said in John 4 the father is seeking
[2:07:32] such to worship him and to worship Him
[2:07:36] in spirit and in truth now many people
[2:07:38] have the spirit and they have no truth
[2:07:40] the other has truth have no spirit it's
[2:07:43] like a man that that has got money in
[2:07:46] the bank don't know how to write a check
[2:07:48] the other knows how to write a check got
[2:07:50] no money in the bank if you could ever
[2:07:52] get those two
[2:07:54] together and I want you to know this is
[2:07:56] the age this is the day that the two
[2:07:58] comes
[2:08:00] together amen we're not just all spirit
[2:08:03] and no truth all truth and no Spirit it
[2:08:05] comes together we're not just check
[2:08:07] writers and we don't have nothing in the
[2:08:09] bank and we're not just we're not just
[2:08:12] those who who say counts the money looks
[2:08:15] at it on paper man got I mean hey
[2:08:17] interest now I've got a million a
[2:08:20] billion uh you know just keep you rising
[2:08:22] and Rising but you don't know how to
[2:08:23] write a check you can't access it but
[2:08:26] you see it there promises are there
[2:08:29] that's in the word it's there but you
[2:08:30] don't know how to write the check this
[2:08:32] message is to bring it both
[2:08:37] together where that there is those who
[2:08:40] know who they are and what they
[2:08:46] have and know they can write a check if
[2:08:55] anytime now if you could just get them
[2:08:58] to recognize who they are get back to
[2:09:01] the full word of God with the baptism of
[2:09:04] the Holy Ghost it set the world a fire
[2:09:06] with a new Pentecostal
[2:09:08] Revival you see you know one one becomes
[2:09:11] word word word and have no spirit and
[2:09:14] then they they studyed the scripture and
[2:09:17] and and the quotes and the message and
[2:09:19] oh yeah we're sons of God
[2:09:21] they believe that but they don't have
[2:09:23] any faith with it others there got a lot
[2:09:26] of faith but they don't know their
[2:09:28] sons you see one is like one like I said
[2:09:31] one's not like one's got a money in the
[2:09:33] bank and but can't write a check the
[2:09:36] other can write a check got no money in
[2:09:38] the bank and brother Brandon said if you
[2:09:40] could just get the thing together till
[2:09:43] men and women could
[2:09:45] realize you that have been truly
[2:09:47] baptized in the Holy Spirit and you have
[2:09:50] the token to display you have every
[2:09:53] right to every Redemptive blessing that
[2:09:56] God promised everything that he promise
[2:09:59] is yours hold your token that's the Holy
[2:10:02] Ghost over your unwavering Faith as you
[2:10:05] pray and over his word faith in his
[2:10:09] word so then he says he he he he goes on
[2:10:13] and talks about this you know just like
[2:10:15] a Elijah and Elisha here Elisha received
[2:10:19] a double portion and so have we
[2:10:22] amen this is why he said Greater Works
[2:10:25] than these shall you do so you see he
[2:10:28] would draw parallel between Elijah and
[2:10:30] Elisha Jesus Christ and the church
[2:10:33] Elisha received a double portion of
[2:10:35] Elijah's Spirit symbolized by when the
[2:10:38] mantle came down and when the Holy Ghost
[2:10:40] came down on the day of Pentecost it was
[2:10:43] that mantle
[2:10:51] man years ago there was a man by the
[2:10:53] name of Ben Bryant he claimed to have
[2:10:54] the pillar of will the the pillow that
[2:10:58] William Bram slep
[2:11:00] on I don't know what he ever did with
[2:11:03] that pillow but he bragged about it and
[2:11:04] wagged it around and showed it around I
[2:11:06] have this pillow and I just say whoopy
[2:11:11] dooo but you don't have a pillow of some
[2:11:14] man' you have the
[2:11:17] mantle of Jesus Christ
[2:11:24] the Holy
[2:11:25] Ghost and it's not whoopy do it's
[2:11:29] wonderful Hallelujah it makes you
[2:11:31] realize I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter
[2:11:34] of God and now I take this cloak and I
[2:11:37] walked down to my
[2:11:40] River to the thing that's hindering my
[2:11:42] faith that's hindering me from crossing
[2:11:45] over into a promise and I smite it with
[2:11:49] that Holy Ghost here I am I'm a son or
[2:11:52] daughter of God Amen and I'm not afraid
[2:11:55] to ask for and believe in the
[2:11:58] Supernatural now we saw in this day we
[2:12:00] saw the son of man Ministry I we're
[2:12:02] talking about the ministry of Jesus
[2:12:04] Christ God repeated in our day exactly
[2:12:08] right we we've seen it to the point that
[2:12:13] some even thought he was Jesus
[2:12:17] Christ said well brother Tim that would
[2:12:19] be blasphemy of course it's Antichrist
[2:12:22] to deify brother brandham but it shows
[2:12:25] how close to the ministry of Jesus that
[2:12:27] he was it also identifies him as as that
[2:12:31] Elijah that was to come it identifies
[2:12:33] him as as John the Baptist they ask him
[2:12:35] are you the Christ are you the Messiah
[2:12:39] some would mistake
[2:12:41] John amen now the same thing you know
[2:12:44] some mistook him because they saw the
[2:12:48] ministry of Jesus Christ repeat
[2:12:53] now they ask him in question answers
[2:12:55] three and 64 brother brandom now brother
[2:12:59] brandom could look could could Jesus
[2:13:01] look like you or you be Jesus or
[2:13:03] something like that and he said one
[2:13:05] sense the word that's exactly the
[2:13:08] truth and another sense of the word it's
[2:13:13] Antichrist that's a difference between
[2:13:15] right and wrong to make me the person of
[2:13:18] the Lord Jesus Christ would be an anti
[2:13:21] Christ for that person of the Lord Jesus
[2:13:24] Christ is sitting at the right hand of
[2:13:27] the Majesty on high and will come again
[2:13:30] in great power and glory and I don't
[2:13:31] know what people do who say he's not on
[2:13:33] the seat of
[2:13:34] Mercy because brother Brandon places him
[2:13:37] right there the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:13:39] is sitting at the right hand of the
[2:13:41] Majesty on high and will come again in
[2:13:43] great power and Glory but for his life
[2:13:46] that was in him being upon me and upon
[2:13:50] you who have him it's exactly the truth
[2:13:54] and you become
[2:13:56] Christ you remember my message on
[2:13:59] Messiahs the word Messiah means the
[2:14:01] anointed one now if you are if you have
[2:14:04] the Holy Spirit you become the anointed
[2:14:07] one and see then there's all kinds of
[2:14:10] anointed ones so there's not just one
[2:14:12] anointed
[2:14:15] one yeah let me stop here for a minute
[2:14:18] the focus anymore is on false anointed
[2:14:20] ones
[2:14:21] if you're anointed you got to be false
[2:14:25] no the anointing don't make you
[2:14:28] false you were false and false seed and
[2:14:32] even an anointing Came Upon
[2:14:34] you but the anointing is not false it
[2:14:38] was sent for the true the rain is sent
[2:14:42] for the wheat but the tears get it
[2:14:46] too nothing wrong with the rain nothing
[2:14:49] wrong with the anointed
[2:14:52] we are the anointed one of this last
[2:14:58] day just as Jesus was anointed now you
[2:15:02] are anointed just as we saw brother
[2:15:04] brandom anointed now you're anointed and
[2:15:07] this is what he says then there's all
[2:15:09] kinds of anointed one here they are all
[2:15:11] throughout this building anointed one
[2:15:14] standing here on the platform and
[2:15:15] sitting here behind me anointed
[2:15:18] ones you're anointed yes you're placed
[2:15:22] you're
[2:15:23] positioned now so he said it was so
[2:15:26] beautifully typed in Elijah and Elisha
[2:15:29] when Elisha was taken up Elijah the old
[2:15:31] Prophet going home and and um when he
[2:15:34] was tired and weary there was a chariot
[2:15:36] hooked up cross the river there to take
[2:15:38] him home on the horses of fire and you
[2:15:40] notice then when Elijah and Elisha
[2:15:42] crossed the river the school of the
[2:15:43] prophets was up there watching him and
[2:15:45] Elijah Elijah took his mantle struck the
[2:15:49] river what he did it divided he went
[2:15:51] cross and the young prophet he said the
[2:15:53] young Prophet what are you following me
[2:15:55] for what do you wish he said that a
[2:15:57] double portion of your spirit come upon
[2:15:59] me a double portion of that Mighty
[2:16:02] Prophet come upon me and he said you ask
[2:16:05] for a hard thing but if you see me when
[2:16:07] I go away then it'll come upon you so
[2:16:11] you can imagine how he watched that
[2:16:13] prophet and in that now in that day the
[2:16:15] prophet was a word for he was a
[2:16:17] manifestation of the word to the world
[2:16:19] and he knew there had to be a greater
[2:16:21] Ministry come because it required a
[2:16:23] greater thing and when Jesus was here on
[2:16:27] the earth he was Elijah these things
[2:16:29] that I do shall you do also and greater
[2:16:32] than these shall you do because I go to
[2:16:34] my father now what are you going to do
[2:16:36] watch him who is he the word watch him
[2:16:38] and when it comes to creation and things
[2:16:41] is true Jesus never straight out created
[2:16:44] anything and brought into existence he
[2:16:46] took substance first he took water made
[2:16:49] wine took bread and made more bread he
[2:16:51] took fish and made more fish but he
[2:16:54] promised that greater things would be
[2:16:57] done you see it's why it's a more evil
[2:17:01] day than it was when he was here it's
[2:17:04] still him but he's using your
[2:17:09] Tabernacle so right here in a more evil
[2:17:12] day God's doing greater
[2:17:17] things this is the age it's the time of
[2:17:19] the Greater Works
[2:17:21] note that we can do the Greater Works
[2:17:26] now many people thinks well we do the
[2:17:28] Greater Works we we spread we give out
[2:17:30] Bibles we uh we preach the gospel we uh
[2:17:33] we have great meetings and we we well
[2:17:36] you
[2:17:37] know like brother brandham said about it
[2:17:39] somebody said to him brother brandham
[2:17:41] you say greater than these shall we do
[2:17:43] well we preach the gospel that's greater
[2:17:45] he said well then just do the things
[2:17:47] Jesus did
[2:17:51] if you're calling out the greater work
[2:17:52] just do what Jesus did and then we'll
[2:17:55] talk about the Greater Works so you see
[2:17:58] the Greater Works is to continue it's
[2:18:01] it's like players in the symphony you've
[2:18:03] got to know what page you're
[2:18:06] on Amen are you walking in step with the
[2:18:09] Gospel of Jesus Christ or you on the
[2:18:11] right page of the symphony if you're on
[2:18:14] the wrong page days of Miracles are
[2:18:18] passed amen it was only for a certain
[2:18:20] season we're not in the season of it
[2:18:23] well you're on the wrong
[2:18:25] page we are not we're not on that page
[2:18:30] we have passed that there was a time in
[2:18:32] the ages where that was what was being
[2:18:35] preached days of Miracles of B but we're
[2:18:38] not on that page anymore God turned that
[2:18:42] page and he shows us he still heals he
[2:18:46] still delivers he still saves
[2:18:51] amen and this page if you're on the page
[2:18:53] the prophet was come on Amen you're
[2:18:56] going to see the Greater Works the signs
[2:18:59] to follow amen the power to move
[2:19:02] mountains because we are people who are
[2:19:04] mountain movers devil defeaters
[2:19:07] Overcomers in this last days call for
[2:19:11] this time in this dispensation to
[2:19:14] fulfill all the word that was written of
[2:19:17] a bride and it's not coming it's
[2:19:21] here you're on the
[2:19:24] beig
[2:19:26] Hallelujah yeah we got greater
[2:19:28] revelation we got greater knowledge but
[2:19:30] that knowledge just showed us how much
[2:19:33] more money there is in the
[2:19:36] bank amen it just it just let us know
[2:19:40] that there were things left for our age
[2:19:43] that God had in the bank in store that
[2:19:46] we got even
[2:19:47] more than what the other ages had and so

[2:33:33] Savior filled with the spirit you're
[2:33:36] welcome to come and participate with us
[2:33:39] today I just wanted
[2:33:41] to remind you just a little bit about
[2:33:45] what we're going to be doing we're going
[2:33:46] to be
[2:33:47] taking the communion we're going to be
[2:33:50] taking unleavened bread and the wine
[2:33:53] which represents the BL blood and the
[2:33:56] body of the
[2:33:57] Lord and as we
[2:33:59] do we're going to have the the ushers
[2:34:03] bring you row by row
[2:34:06] and um we'll have two lines coming
[2:34:10] through and you'll go out the out the
[2:34:12] center the men will go over here to the
[2:34:15] right the ladies go to the left to go to
[2:34:18] foot washing
[2:34:20] those who do not want to participate in
[2:34:23] foot washing you
[2:34:25] can go just go back to your seat if you
[2:34:28] would like and just wait so as they are
[2:34:33] having foot washing they will be coming
[2:34:35] back in going to be worship and singing
[2:34:38] and so on and um so we're going
[2:34:42] to proceed further with this I want to
[2:34:46] talk about it just for a moment and I've
[2:34:48] explained this
[2:34:50] many times but for those of you that are
[2:34:53] not
[2:34:54] familiar I just want to share with you
[2:34:57] this situation that was in the
[2:35:00] Corinthian
[2:35:03] Church and as they would come together
[2:35:05] on the first day of the week which would
[2:35:07] be Sunday to honor the resurrection
[2:35:11] because that's what Christians
[2:35:13] did the Jewish people would come
[2:35:16] together on the seventh day which is
[2:35:18] Saturday
[2:35:20] and they
[2:35:21] would worship the Christians come
[2:35:24] together and they would Worship On the
[2:35:27] first day of the week and they would
[2:35:29] break
[2:35:32] bread and if you will remember
[2:35:35] originally the communion was a Passover
[2:35:38] meal so it was a full
[2:35:41] meal and they would have lamb that would
[2:35:44] be brought for household every house
[2:35:47] would have it and they would take of the
[2:35:51] unleavened bread and the wine there in
[2:35:54] their time of
[2:35:56] Passover so it would be a meal that they
[2:35:58] would have together as uh families would
[2:36:01] come together have the Passover dinner
[2:36:05] then
[2:36:06] they taking of the bread and the wine
[2:36:09] along with the Passover
[2:36:11] meal but when Jesus was at the last
[2:36:16] passover and he had Passover with his
[2:36:18] disciples
[2:36:20] at the end he would take bread and he
[2:36:23] would break it and he would say this is
[2:36:25] my body which is broken for you now we
[2:36:28] know on the
[2:36:30] cross not one bone of his body was
[2:36:34] broken that was
[2:36:37] prophecy but the way the bread was
[2:36:39] broken was is that his body would
[2:36:43] become broken in that he would come
[2:36:48] into the 120 in the upper room and from
[2:36:51] there others and all together we each
[2:36:55] one being a part of that body would all
[2:36:58] become one loaf we'd make up one
[2:37:02] loaf and so when you come to the
[2:37:05] communion table tonight you are this
[2:37:08] evening you are actually taking that and
[2:37:13] and pronouncing I am a part of the body
[2:37:17] of Christ now not a part of evening life
[2:37:19] light Tabernacle the body of Christ I'm
[2:37:22] a part of the body of
[2:37:25] Christ then Jesus Took the
[2:37:28] blood which he called the blood which
[2:37:31] was the life of the grape it had been
[2:37:34] squeezed
[2:37:36] out and he would take the the blood of
[2:37:39] the grape and he would drink it and he
[2:37:41] would pass it and said this is my
[2:37:44] blood so again the the wine would
[2:37:47] represent the very blood of God which is
[2:37:51] the holy
[2:37:52] spirit so when you take out the cup you
[2:37:56] are remembering not only am I part of
[2:37:58] the body but I have drank or received
[2:38:02] his life into me and you are testifying
[2:38:06] of
[2:38:07] that
[2:38:09] now in the book of Corinthians Paul sets
[2:38:13] all of this in
[2:38:14] order it had been a
[2:38:17] meal and he said
[2:38:20] to them he said now we got a a problem
[2:38:23] he said you know you're bringing your
[2:38:25] food you're all eating together and then
[2:38:28] we're taking the the communion breaking
[2:38:31] bread here but said you know one is
[2:38:36] hungry and the other is drunken and you
[2:38:40] say you know some have and some don't
[2:38:44] and you know you're shaming one another
[2:38:47] because they Rich has abundance and and
[2:38:50] the poor has little and you're shaming
[2:38:53] one another and he said don't you have
[2:38:56] houses to eat in so eat eat at
[2:39:00] home and don't despise the Church of God
[2:39:03] and shame them that have not and he said
[2:39:06] I can't Praise You In This because this
[2:39:10] isn't right what you're doing but I've
[2:39:12] got a solution so he says 1 Corinthians
[2:39:17] 11:23 I have received the Lord L that
[2:39:20] which I've delivered unto you that the
[2:39:23] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[2:39:25] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[2:39:27] given thanks he break it and said take
[2:39:30] eat this is my body which is broken for
[2:39:32] you this do in remembrance of me and
[2:39:35] after the same manner also he took the
[2:39:38] cup and when he had sep sayeth this cup
[2:39:41] is a new testament in my blood this do
[2:39:43] ye as often as you drink it in
[2:39:45] remembrance of me for as often as you
[2:39:49] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[2:39:52] show the Lord's death till he come
[2:39:56] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:39:58] and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:40:00] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:40:03] and blood of the
[2:40:05] Lord but let a man examine himself and
[2:40:08] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[2:40:10] of that cup for he that eateth and
[2:40:12] drinketh
[2:40:13] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[2:40:16] himself not
[2:40:17] Discerning we're not playing church
[2:40:20] here this is for
[2:40:22] Real so if you've been living a double
[2:40:25] life don't come up here without having
[2:40:30] repented and being right with
[2:40:32] God because this has caused many are
[2:40:35] weak and sickly among you and many are
[2:40:37] they sleep they're dead see judgment has
[2:40:40] come upon them because he said if we
[2:40:42] would judge ourselves we wouldn't be
[2:40:44] judged so there would be no no need for
[2:40:47] sickness or death or things to come on
[2:40:49] us because of our double standard life
[2:40:52] if we judge ourselves and realize it
[2:40:54] we're not worthy to take it cuz we have
[2:40:56] not been living right but when we're
[2:40:59] judged we're chasen to the Lord that we
[2:41:02] should not be condemned with the world
[2:41:05] so he said wherefore my brother when you
[2:41:06] come together to eat t or wait one for
[2:41:09] another and if any man hunger let him
[2:41:13] eat at home so this is what Paul said it
[2:41:16] in he changed it from having a meal
[2:41:19] together to a time where they would just
[2:41:22] have the bread and the wine to remember
[2:41:25] the Lord and would be part of their
[2:41:27] worship and that's what we're doing
[2:41:30] today furthermore we believe that
[2:41:33] another ordinance is foot
[2:41:36] washing and we take that from the words
[2:41:39] of Jesus in John Chapter
[2:41:42] 13 where that after the the supper being
[2:41:46] ended Jesus guarded himself with a towel
[2:41:49] and he began to wash the
[2:41:51] feet of the
[2:41:53] disciples and he showed himself to
[2:41:58] be a servant he humbled himself and
[2:42:01] washed the feet of
[2:42:03] fishermen and he he would commission us
[2:42:06] and tell us that now you do this
[2:42:09] too and you
[2:42:12] remember why you are really here is not
[2:42:14] to be served but to serve
[2:42:17] others so when you go to foot washing
[2:42:21] you remember the life of a Christian is
[2:42:23] one of
[2:42:24] humility of humbling to every word and
[2:42:26] promise of God and serving him with all
[2:42:30] your heart and in doing so loving and
[2:42:33] serving one
[2:42:35] another so Peter would say to Jesus said
[2:42:39] well you know you're not washing my
[2:42:42] feet I I'm you're not going to wash mine
[2:42:46] he said well if I don't wash it you'll
[2:42:48] have no part with me well then Peter
[2:42:51] changed his mind he said well I tell you
[2:42:53] wash my Wash Me from head to
[2:42:55] toe I I want to be fully committed and
[2:42:59] Jesus said no he that is
[2:43:02] washed and in that day they already had
[2:43:04] bath houses and everybody would be
[2:43:06] bathed and cleansed went through their
[2:43:08] purification to come to this Passover so
[2:43:11] he said he that's already had a
[2:43:13] bath doesn't need to have their whole
[2:43:16] body washed just their feet
[2:43:20] now there's a reason for this we have
[2:43:23] been washed we have been
[2:43:26] cleansed we have been pure but where we
[2:43:29] walk in the world where we walk in the
[2:43:32] paths of life where the disciples would
[2:43:35] walk from the bath house to the Passover
[2:43:38] room their feet would get
[2:43:41] dirty and when we walk in the paths of
[2:43:44] life we go through
[2:43:48] things troubles come Sorrows comes
[2:43:50] heartache comes but we as Believers are
[2:43:54] here to wash the dirt off of one another
[2:43:56] and encourage one
[2:43:59] another to be fully
[2:44:01] clean so if you've been washed you've
[2:44:04] been
[2:44:05] Sanctified you don't need your whole
[2:44:07] body wash just your feet you've been
[2:44:10] walking through the world let's just
[2:44:11] wash that off things that maybe we
[2:44:14] shouldn't have done or didn't do right
[2:44:16] let's just wash it all off let's just
[2:44:21] start out here a fresh and a new
[2:44:24] Passover or this communion service it's
[2:44:27] kind of like a new
[2:44:31] beginning it's a remembrance he died for
[2:44:35] me I receive his life I'm a part of his
[2:44:39] body I'm here to serve I'm here to be
[2:44:43] washed Wash Me Lord and let me as a
[2:44:47] brother encourage another
[2:44:49] and wash the dirt off of them God bless
[2:44:52] you as we come to the the table of the
[2:44:56] Lord this evening and what will happen
[2:44:59] we we'll have the musicians and Elders
[2:45:02] those that need to go first so we'll
[2:45:05] turn on some music here to start
[2:45:07] [Music]
[2:45:08] this but let me first have prayer over
[2:45:11] the bread the
[2:45:16] wine ask the deacons to join me
[2:45:20] [Music]
[2:45:44] here let's bow our heads together
[2:45:47] father today
[2:45:49] stands before
[2:45:52] me is this
[2:45:54] plate it has upon it the bread un leaven
[2:45:59] leaven is a type of sin in this
[2:46:02] case and it represents the unleavened
[2:46:06] body of the Lord without sin and that we
[2:46:10] are to live a life where that we do not
[2:46:14] habitually and continually sin but where
[2:46:16] that we obey you before me Lord is the
[2:46:20] cup the
[2:46:22] lives that has been squeezed out of the
[2:46:26] out of the grape how is called the blood
[2:46:28] of the grapes it represents your blood
[2:46:32] that was shed for us as we take it I
[2:46:35] pray that you'll sanctify the bread and
[2:46:37] the body and the blood and that you'll
[2:46:40] sanctify the believer as they come
[2:46:42] through today and may they walk in
[2:46:44] newness of Life serving you with all
[2:46:47] their heart in Jesus
[2:46:49] name
[2:46:51] amen amen
