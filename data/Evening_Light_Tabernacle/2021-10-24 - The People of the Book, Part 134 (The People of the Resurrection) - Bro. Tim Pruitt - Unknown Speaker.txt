grace today we find ourselves unworthy in our own merits and the only worth we have is because the blood was shed for us and to think you thought so much of us that you gave your own life on our behalf god so loved the world i want to thank you for loving me lord i'm so glad to be your child today birthed by your spirit washed in your blood filled with your holy spirit it's so precious to us lord and we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts and lord if we've held back anything in our lives from you we want to give that to you too lord because we want to be totally yours sold out holding nothing back fully surrendered and i'm here today lord is just a servant of yours to wash the feet of your children [Music] lord maybe even by the words that i speak that would wash the dirt off their feet where they walk through the world you will you wash them you cleanse them but today may it just be a great foot washing where you just washed all of the things of the world off our lives where we've walked down the dirty paths for we're in this world but we're not of it and so we ask lord for your cleansing today and you're purging by your blood because if we'll be purged now by your blood we won't have to be purged in the tribulation that is coming and we know it's here we feel the hot whims that are already blowing we see the trouble on the horizon the storm is coming oncoming storms of judgment that are laying in wait for this earth but just as soon as your bride leaves from here the vials will be poured out of judgment those who have rejected your word and been left behind will suffer the consequences of their decisions i pray today that you would speak to our hearts lord that you'd anoint us by your spirit god i'm here lord for a new phase in my ministry a greater anointing i'm looking forward to what you have in the future knowing that you've called us for a purpose and we're here to finish the race lord we pray lord for your servants everywhere that are gathered across the world we're not the only ones here in the evening light tabernacle you've got people little churches everywhere across the world there's no big one of us little one of us we're all the same in your sight we're just apart each one like a cell in the body and i pray lord you'll bless each one because if they suffer we suffer if their need we're in need if they're sick we're sick heal your people lord bring deliverance to your children these that we've asked for for the coveted lord a young man with a little wife that's they're crying out today for deliverance heal them i pray father in my hand today is a desperate need lord it represented oh god in this prayer that i'm bringing a little sister from south africa and she's heard how that you heal she's heard how you delivered that you delivered another from third stage cancer and gave the husband a job and put him back on the road to in the perfect will of god oh god this little soul is a prodigal to this trade oh god she's confessed all kinds of things that she didn't need to confess to me but she's a desperate soul [Music] lord makes you turn to you with all her heart i pray lord as we send this prayer cloth to south africa and it reaches its destination i pray o god the evil spirits that has been and bound her down will be removed from her life oh god the sins which are many and she's like the woman at the well she needs a deliverance deliver your people dear god i pray that you'll bless this this scene audience and the unseen lord just before walking out brother william butts just showed me a picture of our our part of our body part of the church here as they're out on a little holiday camping this weekend yet they're all sitting together to take part of the word i pray that the same anointing the same presence of god that is here will be there and that you'll move among them delivering them and providing for their need we're asking these things because we believe we're expecting you to do great things because you promised in jesus name amen and amen praise god god bless you amen god bless you amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen i asked the librarians to come get this handkerchief after church to be sent over to south africa for a need there that we just prayed about and knowing god will answer that need amen i want to send greetings around the world today to with different ones that are joining with us they've already had their services in different places but you know it's uh nighttime over in um south africa and there's believers there brother kaelin his and groups with him and down with brother uh edict and wilson down in another part and then then others that are joining in told me brother buzz bosey from uganda that's uh tuned in today and and uh our folks up in arkansas no they're not backslid it's a good thing amen we love you and we are glad that you was able to get away a little bit just we should have worked on another weekend but anyway we're here and we're thankful to god for his blessings to us in god good to give us so many blessings amen amen i thank you for your attendance of the meetings and everything that you did you know we've not really been able to express a lot of thanksgiving to you for the you being such a wonderful gracious host to the many that came and providing them with meals and places to stay and different things and and uh my what a tremendous services we had just power packed one after another god speaking to us in a wonderful way and i so appreciated the ministry that god sent to us all the way from brother david mayer with his message all the way through brother wayne and brother ron and and brother donnie reagan and then you know god was so gracious to forewarn us about the valley that was coming amen that shows how mindful that god is and he received a word from the from god telling us that that we would come down from this mountaintop and we had had mountaintops experienced well there were those who actually uh are not just fly by night um easily mis misled the people but they actually saw the pillar of fire among us and you know things that were happening like that we know he was here you may not have seen him but we know he was here amen i know he's here this morning the angels of the lord encamp about those that fear him amen and delivers them amen so we're in the moment of great deliverance well we've been down in the valley but we found out that the god of the hills is still the god in the valley that our god is still god no matter where we are and what our situation is amen so it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning thank you for all your prayers that you've had for me since um my little surgery and i'm doing well and i want to thank you for your your prayers and thank the lord for his blessings to us amen john chapter 11 verse 21 is where i want to read from this morning as we just look to the lord amen i don't see anybody here that's really a visitor but anyway uh everybody is is here is just a part of the body so we're just glad to have you here with us today amen look into the lord now as we look into the scripture asking that he would just anoint us by his grace john chapter 11 verse 21 then said martha unto jesus lord if thou had has been here my brother had not died but i know that even now don't you love those words even now whatsoever thou s will ask of god god will give it thee and jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this and she said unto him yay lord i believe that thou art to christ the son of god which should come into the world amen may god bless this word you can be seated in our scripture reading today we are finding that jesus was standing at the tomb of lazarus and he was about to raise a man that you know his body was already had already seen corruption he had been dead for four days and yet as he even looks at death where the body is corrupted he declares that i am the resurrection and the life and and of course you know he's the resurrection and the life and and and he does in that moment what we all yearn to see and that's not just for one man to be raised from the dead but for all the dead in christ of the gentile ages to be raised now jesus makes clear before the resurrection of lazarus and this can this occasion remember if he if he had not said lazarus come forth and just said come forth then all the dead would have obeyed his voice but already before the resurrection of all the dead you know that would come forth that it would that would raise when he rose jesus announces i am the resurrection and the life and i just want to say today that even so before the rapture and the resurrection of the new testament dead there must be a people who can honestly declare that they are the resurrection and the very life of the word of god now because because the two christ and his bride are one so whatever he does she must emulate whatever word he fulfills she must also in feminine form fulfill the word that has been left for her now many people today you know we hear them saying that they have the token uh you know as if it was some type of a lucky charm or a talisman which when it's obvious that they don't have the holy ghost at all the token isn't a a talisman or a lucky charm at all or just a saying that we say all the way or we've applied the token or we have the token what the token is is the literal life of jesus christ and having his life makes us the bride and it has the bride then we are the life of the word so when we look at that not only is christ the word but his bride is a word bride she also is the word and as he would say as the groom fulfilled the old testament so will the bride fulfill the new testament so we have a word that we must fulfill in this day now you might be just a church member but until you have his life that literal life of christ you can never ever be christ's bride i know we use that term kind of loosely i'm the bride of christ or we're the bride of christ or or but but you cannot be the bride of christ until you receive his life it is that which brings you in union with jesus christ making you a part of his bride but instead of that you're just a dead church member a professor without a possession we got too many of those today amen because we are in the hour of impersonation it is the day of janice and jamborees where that many are rising up not just preachers but lay members as well impersonating christianity when they're not real but i want to tell you in spite of all the faults there is a real bride there is a real holy ghost and there are people that has the real token it is the power of god into salvation [Applause] you say well brother tim what we want is we want an axe to church we want miracles and we want signs and we want wonders well what about the miracle of just living a christian life good would all the signs and wonders do without the miracle of a christian life amen the miracle of being a good husband the miracle of being a good wife the miracle of a marriage of no regrets [Applause] amen that's exactly right you know that's what god wants he wants you to emulate him a father to emulate his fatherhood a son to emulate his sonship a husband to emulate him a man a a wife to emulate the bride of christ him in feminine form this is what god wants in this hour he wants more than lip service he wants more than church attendance there's better churches to attend there's bigger churches to attend there's more fluent churches to attend god don't walk church attendance alone what god wants is a heart that is sold out to him a life that is surrendered amen completely where they're dead to the world and they have been made alive in christ that they are the resurrected ones that's what i'm preaching on this morning is the people of the resurrection in ephesians chapter 2 he tells us right and there and you have he quickened you have he resurrected or made alive who were dead in trespasses and sin we were all born dead we needed a resurrection amen if you haven't received christ yet you need a resurrection amen where in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power the heir the spirit that not worketh in the children of disobedience among whom we all had our manner of life amen in times past in the lust of our flesh adriana that's ephesians 3 3 now among whom we had our our manner of life in in times past and the last of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and word by nature look here look what kind of nature we have by nature we were the children of wrath even as others sorry we were all born this way there's none exempt there is none that doeth good no not one there's every one of us came here needing a savior needing a redeemer we need to be safe from our own self we need to be saved from our pride we need to be saved from our selfishness all about me we needed jesus [Applause] we were by nature the children of wrath but that's not the end of the story the never the next verse begins with but but god aren't you glad the story didn't end the the verse before amen here comes the cornerstone right here that changes the whole scene but god i was a sinner but god i was lost but god i was a drunkard but god i wasn't a whoremonger but god i was the worst for the worst but god but god who is rich in mercy for his love wherewith he loved us he didn't love you because you were lovable he loved you when you were unlovable and think of this knowing you would fall and knowing the mess you would get in he loved you before all of that god ain't gonna quit loving his own now so even when we were dead in sins notice our condition dead in sins he hath quickened us or resurrected us or made us alive together with christ by grace are you saved oh thank god for his favor and he has raised us up notice raised us up resurrected us up raised us up with him together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus what words of promise these are colossians 3 1 if you then be risen with christ notice it was not just jesus rose he wanted you to experience the resurrection also you know we all preach about the day he raised from the dead but what about the day you raised from the dead and remember you were in him when he raised hallelujah amen you were in him when he raised from the dead because the bride had not been separated from the body yet come on amen so you died with him and you raised with him and you ascended with him come on church and every devil is under your feet because of him [Applause] hallelujah you say how in the world could this ever be well you know you can look back at calvary and see where you raised with him because you were in him so you know you're going to raise with him now you know brother branham preached a sermon called one in a million it stumbled some people they look and said one in a million how could i ever make it how could i ever make there's one in a million i mean you know then then how in the world could i ever make it if there's only one in a million thinking about that one time i'd begin to think about it you know yeah one in a million i said you know thinking of that when i was born i was one in a million of little seeds little germ lice that was looking for an egg a union somebody with me amen i was one in a million and i was blind i couldn't see i'd never been that way before amen i didn't have hands and feet i had a little wiggle tail that just wiggled along you know in the in the darkness amen but i've already made it once so how can i i made it once if i can make it once come on amen then surely by his grace by his mercy i can make it twice colossians chapter 3 verse 4 says when christ who is our life it's christ in our lives that makes us a christian it's christ in our lives that sets us apart from the world it is christ in our lives is what makes us alive to god and dead to sin it is a resurrection to life and now you're dead to sin and adultery and fornication and drunkenness is all gone the old mean dominating hateful selfish ways are gone you're raised from the grave of sin and and left behind jealousy and envy and hatred and the works of the flesh and raised up with the love of god amen with the power to forgive and to love your enemies amen it'll make a man love his wife and give himself for her amen this will cause a wife to reverence her husband and the results will be a christ-centered home amen with children that will want to have the same kind of life no not religious quacks with religious spirits not super-duper christians with the pretense of being spiritual you know i get sick of people trying to impress me with their talks from god that are obvious impersonations not for real it's time to be real not legalism either or some self-righteousness a self-made manufactured holiness there's your other extreme remember this satan don't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you're born again that's what our prophet told us you see he don't care how religious he don't care how many times you come to church he don't care how good you can sing he don't care how much you jump run down the aisles if you miss that life you have missed everything and every person should seek for one thing let me find that life but as brother branham told us in ephesians church age people live today like this is the only thing there was just live here on the earth that's all i talked to a man in the barbershop the other day you know and we were we were speaking just a moment he asked me who i was and where i come from and whatever he happened to be a former barber in the town and i never went to his shop and he was sitting down and he was talking with me and i just told him i said all of your life will mean nothing unless you meet the lord i said i know you've been a barber and you've probably been witness to everybody in the whole wide world and sat down in your chair but i'm telling you you don't want to meet god in the condition you're in you know people go a long life as if you know and as i explained to him i said you should live every day as though this would be your last one that's the way i preach a sermon as if it's going to be the last sermon i ever preach i want to preach it with everything i got with sincerity with dedication with consecrations now he said you don't realize you got a soul that's going to leave here and go somewhere and you seal your destination right here the way you live and the way you do out holding grudges and mean and everything and then run to church oh mercy what's shame on you you bring a reproach upon the cause of christ he says the bootlegger in the hurting the church it isn't that it isn't the prostitute that's hurting the church it's the people who profess to be christians that's hurting the church and he says we know what the bootlegger is what the prostitute is but when our sisters dress like a prostitute that's different that's what hurts the church when a man drinks like the bootlegger well that's what's hurt the church they're professing to be a christian and they do that and people look for you look for you that name in other words identify you with that name but let every let him that even names the name of christ depart from sin get away from it oh we're so short brothers me you all of us we're sort of what christ wants us to be and right here in this day is time to lay aside every sin that's easily besets us and wrap with patience amen the race that is set before us amen this is the hour this the time is a time to quit pretending and be real pretenders we got a lot of pretenders around pretenders who have pretended that nothing will happen until brother branham comes back i'll tell you you better hope he don't come back you'll get the greatest rebuke of your life we have pretenders as preachers it turns out to be perverts and adulterers and drunkards and living filthy lives oh yeah we have pretenders of being so spiritual they can't be led we are you know but i want to ask you why be a pretender when you can be real amen christ is going to have preeminence in his church amen and he wants to be the lord of your life amen to be to have lordship is to be the ruler to be your guide he listen it's not that he just wants to possess you in order to control you he wants to he wants to take over the lordship of your life to keep you from the rulership of satan because you're going to be under one lord or the other you can't serve god and mammon you can't remain in between you are either of the worshipper of jesus christ or you're a worshipper of satan one or the other now brother branham would say this his unfailing faith put him jesus in position to know he was the perfect born son of god if your faith will put you in position to know that every divine promise of god's bible is for you just as sure as that pertain to him every promise pertains to you your healing the salvation your freedom from sin from selfishness from your indifference from your little turtle shell you pull yourself into christ wants to come in and be the lord and ruler and set you free from these things hallelujah but i'm speaking today to people of the resurrection they're not pretenders they're not imagining things they are not putting themselves on as being spiritual and are not they're for real amen we are the people of the resurrection we have been resurrected out of cold dark denominationalism a people that's been made alive who have more than the mechanics but to have the dynamics with it here brother branham and it is the horizon of the sun he clearly tells us that for the first time there will come forth for the bright age how many knows we're in the bright age amen for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism you see you were in a baptist tomb or a methodist tomb or a pentecostal tomb or a catholic tomb or some of you were even in a message tomb amen but there has been a resurrection out of the tomb hallelujah a people who are the first one of the ages out from among the dead they are the first fruits of the end time resurrection they are emulating and projecting exactly what christ was 2 000 years ago the first from the dead a people who can say i am the resurrection i am the life of this word that's who i am you see now he said they would come forth for the bright age of resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message a lot of people have a lot of different ideas what the message is but here's the message that the full maturity of the word has turned back in full power and being waived on the people by the same signs and wonders he did back there there's the message the message is not a powerless word it's not a bunch of creeds and doubles of man the message is life it is a lie it has power in it it has life-changing power a lot of people are claiming to have the message in their life is not changed but if you get the message it's a message of the full maturity of the word is turned back in its full power by the same signs and wonders and guess what you become the sign and the wonder the greatest miracle you will ever have is your own life surrendered to christ because i live you shall live also these were the words of jesus because i live you shall live because i live you shall live speaking to his wife what a resurrection that was 2 000 years ago but what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power now as we think of this resurrection jesus said i am the resurrection and as i said there has to be a people a bride in this last day that emulate the same thing amen and resurrection means revival that's one word to revive revival if you have a resurrection you have a revival and this bride's revival is the greatest revival that ever struck the earth amen it's greater than the day of pentecost because it's the harvest of the wheat grain and not his planting amen it's rapture time it is bride time so we are living in the greatest revival that there ever was you say brother tim i i don't see any revival well open your eyes take a look around you won't have to look very far just look right here look around and see it in your neighbor next door you are the revival amen i once was dead in sin's trespasses but now i am alive forevermore and i've got the keys of death and hell hallelujah satan's kingdom can't hold me down doctors can't hold me down death can't hold me down there is nothing that can captivate me and hold me captive no sin no habit no complex can bind me and hold me down i am he that was dead but i have risen from the dead of sin and i am alive forevermore and i hold the key brother branham would say an invisible union of the bride and i was there when many walked out as he preached not liking what he was saying as i watched women sit in front of me and poke one another and laugh and point at brother branham as he spoke those things but he said something there in the invisible union the move is on for the bride that's dust saith the lord when god releases a moon it don't stop till it fulfills what he sent it for and this revival didn't just start it began as the sun of righteousness shed forth the rays of the evening light with a divine healing movement let me tell you there the sick were healed and when the dead were raised blind eyes was open the death heard cripples walked and more than that it brought men and women to a spirit-filled life amen this revival produces good marriages wonderful children spirit-filled churches come on i might have saw a picture the other day projected there of what things used to be used to be a man and his wife laying up in bed reading the bible together before they went to sleep now they're there with she's on her phone and he's on his [Music] that's the that is the temptations of this life the snares to get caught up in nonsense who cares if your neighbor burner beans who cares if she was making cupcakes today who cares if she got a new couch we get so caught up and and everybody else and knowing what everybody else is doing instead of what we're supposed to do we use the facebook but we don't face the book it's time we be real we're in the last hour we're in the last days are you with me amen this is where we are this is the time that we're in and we must realize that we cannot be impersonators and put-ons we have pretenders we've got to be for real amen we are children of the resurrection now as i said this this revival caught fire with god doing extreme things and let me tell you it continues with god doing extreme things it brought bible days here again it's like walking in the bible no longer is jesus a god of the past but this revival has brought him present amen no more do we long for the days of elijah these are the days of elijah amen these are the days where the word spoken the message preached makes dry bones live and we're in the days of elijah yeah we saw him taken from us but the spirit of the of elijah that that anointing of christ is still anointing the people here in this end time amen because we are the people of the resurrection not somebody that's dead in sins and trespasses and creeds of men but people of the resurrection we are not dead just because the prophet is gone we are not a powerless group of people whose only weapon is argument come on we are the elisha group amen that follows elijah we're not we're not chasing where he went we are not looking for him to return we are finishing the work that elijah did amen that elijah commissioned us to if you read the bible elisha was left with a double portion to finish the ministry of elijah amen i'm here to finish the ministry i i'm not i'm not no no no i'm not to crow in and say i'm the one that's not it i'm not a part of the great move of god this bride's revival began with vivid proof of the word among us it divided but thunder between the soul and the spirit it revealed the thoughts and intents of heart it continues with god doing the same thing resurrection also is a restoration and that restoration was spoken of and prophesied of in malachi 4 to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers and i just wonder you know a lot of times we we we find people almost uh offensive to that you know i i we we don't want to go back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers but that's what elijah the prophet was said to do over and over and over we were told this is the goal this is the purpose of sending elijah is to sin turn your hearts back to the original faith come on amen turning the heart back to the original faith of the fathers now and that isn't word only because paul was clear the word don't just come in word only it comes with power and much assurance now brother branham would be emphatic he said god ain't going to plant a new church but he's going to bring back his original planting to original seed this is the age of restoration it's the age of the finished cycle we've come and we made a huge circle like eternity is a circle and we come back and been brought back to exactly where the church started to finish the cycle it's the age of the venice cycle it not only brought healing from cancer tuberculosis diabetes and heart trouble it healed us of 2 000 years of false doctrine it brought us back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints amen it it brought us back you know to to truth that healed us from the errors of the past the thing that would kill luther's movement a trinitarian baptism and a triune god and and the organization the things that's killed other movements has been healed we don't suffer with it no more come on amen we have our foot upon it we have been made conquerors amen the false doctrines of the past have been taken away we're back to the same gospel that paul preached back to paul's gospel and you know what peter preached and what paul preached bible days bible doctrine bible truth bible holiness [Applause] it's a restoration of the apostles doctrine but not word only but with power brother branham would talk about this restoration and restoration of the bride tree and he said to restore means to return to the former owner so you had to go come from god you had to be a part of that in order to receive that you see to restore means to bring back to return to the former owner not or bring back to the former estate of condition so bring it back former owner bring it back to the former estate and we can enforce a claim to be restored now webster says the word restore means to bring back the fame former owner to bring back to a former stated condition if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it to make it come back in its right place but the law of the spirit of god is to force satan to give up that which he is unrightfully deceitfully taken from god souls of men he took from god souls of women sickness of the body satan placed upon people where god made him in his image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the bible to take the holy spirit and enforce them it upon them now i'll tell you i can't help but believe in miracles because i am a miracle amen and so is everyone else's born of the spirit you're a greater miracle than the blind eyes open your greater mind you're a greater miracle than than the cripples walk amen but i can't help but believe in miracles because i am a miracle you know why i've i've been through a season now where the devil has tried to convince me that my prayers are and my faith is paralyzed and i just want to say it is not as i just thought about what brother branham said in this enforce you know he said you can force a claim to make a restoration i remember some time ago it was with brother john lay that he was in a condition where that he had a nervous breakdown and his mind was out there in some land somewhere way beyond his body and and there he was just you know you know out of reality and there as we as we talked and uh he got a little bit upset about uh something there and i just took him down to my house and away from others and and we were planting some bushes i said come help me plant some bushes and well you know i got down on my knees with him by by him and here he was you know his wife had taken a break from him that day and because she's having to watch his every move and and was con so concerned about him i was giving her a break and kind of taking care of him that day and you know and and as we knelt down there to plant that and we were packing dirt around the roots of that plant while we were on our knees i put my arm around him and i said god my brother's mind is out there wandering way out yonder somewhere in the in the in the spirit world somewhere i commanded to come back to his body in just hours he was completely and totally sane don't tell me amen now listen if i have to encourage myself in the lord today i'll do it amen if i have to brag on what god has done i'll do it if i have to testify of his goodness i'll do it i got a lot to talk about hallelujah amen the faith of christ within me has cast out devils in america in africa at youth camps at home and in this church [Applause] hallelujah amen it delivers alcoholics one of my first in a home meeting is a lad of about 16 a drunk soldier came leaned on the other side of the pulpit and breathed his liquor breath right in my face as he talked to me and he said preacher he interrupted the sermon that i was preaching and he said preacher could god save a man like me i've killed men in battle while i was in war and i did horrible things and i looked back him and i was only 16. i looked him back in the face and i said yes sir my god will deliver you he will he will save you from your sins we we prayed with him and he was baptized in the name of jesus christ calling on the name of the lord and was completely set free until god called him home and i'll tell you god will do it again [Music] hallelujah he will do it again bound a minute sick lame whatever it is god will do it again because he's the resurrection and the life and we have that life therefore we are the resurrection if you're dead there's life here amen if you're in sins there's life here if you're sick and diseased there's life here there's power it'll deliver women from the demon of prostitution i know it because i saw it happen with a woman who came here from a pentecostal church stacking up with a pentecostal boy had kids by three men and was living with a man she's like the woman at the well and to add to her her misery she had a religious demon too that would hide behind speaking in tongues and she'd speak in tongues and go get another man but one day in her hour of deliverance the demons were cast out she held the christian testimony until the day i buried her let me talk about my god for a moment let me talk about resurrection life that can take a woman of that condition and change her in just a moment no little sister down there in south africa it's not impossible for you we service god and bring possibility we serve a god who brings out of death [Applause] it takes someone to so filthy and low down in sin and raise you up again and make a real daughter of god out of you not with no pretense of holiness but god's own holiness living out of you i had a young woman as i reflected back for a moment i had a young woman with a split personality she was bipolar she drove up to my house she sat for a while in her in her car and i waited for her to come in my wife was home and we waited for her to come in she wouldn't come in she just kept sitting out there in the car so after a bit i went out she's still just sitting in the car she made no no offer to speak to me or nothing just a stare and i opened her door of her car and she said you open one door i'll open the next i got her to come in the house and once inside i saw she was a lunatic she was full of demons she began to growl and the spirit began to speak up out of her blaspheme in the name of jesus christ but by the power of god in the blood of christ using his names those demons had to bow to the name and made her a lovely christian lady until god called her home you know why i'm talking about that because we have resurrection life that they take a woman bipolar split personality demon possessed a lunatic hallelujah and make her a saint of god i'm talking about the power of the resurrection it's because we are people of the resurrection you all know the story it's on me it's actually on video in the prayer line of the youth camp a young girl that was anointed with all the moment i've anointed her with all immediately she crossed down like an animal growling i won't come out i won't come out she was swinging her hands at me trying to hit me you know just see like a beast you know and then her face was grotesque but invited by those demons and speaking out i won't come out and growling at me and swinging at me but she couldn't connect it seemed as though there was an invisible wall between us but i'll tell you the rest of the story that spirit succumbed to the power of the name of jesus [Applause] i'm talking about the name of jesus i'm talking about the resurrection i'm talking about the life-giver i'm talking about people who were dead and sins and trespasses that he quickened that he made alive hallelujah amen prayer delivers the sick you remember karen emmons was about to go to surgery for cancer in the female glands i went to see her the night before surgery and i asked her what do you want me to do with that cancer and she looked back at me and she said cut his head off we prayed with her that night and the next morning the doctors were astounded when they did surgery and what was on their scans was not there at all gum we all know of sister atlanta butts had hodgkin's lymphoma amen look like a hopeless case but one day in the presence of god because he's the resurrection and we're people of the resurrection amen the voice of god declared her enemy dead hallelujah she went back to the next day to a for an exam and got a scant felt no divorce felt just as sick as ever went back in there god got another scan and the doctor comes back out and says you don't have any cancer she said well how often do you see these kind of results never we never have but i'm going to tell you right in the presence of the resurrection life somebody who was dying one moment was alive resurrected back to health again hallelujah i'll never forget one of our deacons brother jerry shaw gasping for breath on oxygen sitting there by the door in the old church there by my study you remember it i was as i preached a sermon that day in the presence of god came down and anointed was there and i walked by him on the way out to my back into the study behind me and as i passed by him i grabbed him and rebuked that thing in the name of the lord and for the next three years he didn't have to have supplemental oxygen why is it is because he's the resurrection and the life and we are the people of the [Applause] resurrection we can remember brother ron spencer brain dead god sent me over there to pray for him amen i didn't leave there with him still brain dead because the resurrection and the life walked into that building and the prayer of faith was prayed and the prayers of all the saints ascended before the throne of god and god heard and god delivered and god raised him up to preach many many more sermons and he'll do it again because he's the resurrection and the life and we are part of that [Applause] august the 10th 2015. she was taken to the icu with a brain bleed i stood there with my children days all gathered together with me my my son my my daughters my son-in-laws and as i spoke i just said just trying to be a father and comfort them i just said some things very in the natural you know children now we are not here i can see look at concern and fear upon their faces and what's happening to our mama and i said we we are believers and we're not going to fear we're going to believe because that's what believers do and when i said that it just came out of my mouth and as it did it said she will be in the icy room tonight she will be in a regular room tomorrow night and the next night she will be at home in her own bed well you know the story she came home with with partial blindness she couldn't see her peripheral vision was gone they talked about big glasses that they could do with somehow refractors that they could do to you know be able to see again get some of that back she was there laying on the bed kind of feeling sorry for herself thinking about life i was having to help her still to the bathroom and help her dress and help her shower and all of that and she was just kind of wondering what life was going to be like and she about that time my daughter bethany brings little drew down sets him down at the end of the bed a child that had been seen in the vision walking but he's 18 months old and he's never walked can't pull up can't crawl he could sit alone she set him at the end of the bed but she walked over to do something for mama and as her mama's kitty begin to turn to praise the spirit of god began to sweep over that bed and her her eyesight came back and at that moment it swept down over the bed somebody listening and a little baby who had never crawled never walked got up out of the floor by itself and ran all over my house oh yeah i know because he's the resurrection and the life i know because we are the people at the resurrection let me just rehearse it following wednesday night god had told me to have a prayer line brother wayne lawson was preaching here that night in that prayer line i waited until i i felt the spirit was right i went and got sister karen she was there in a recliner in my back room back study and i went and got her brought her out we prayed with her the holy spirit come down upon her for the next two hours she stood there and praised god while we were continued with the prayer line and that very night there was a little girl that came up into the prayer line and said i want my brother saved he's living a life of sin i want him saved i want him to return to god and our family is broke apart i've got to have my brother say we prayed for her and in a little bit here comes her brother god has jerked him up out of the bed drug him through the house of god he's still in his uh his night clothes and he staggered down to an altar and gives his heart to god and he's still serving god this morning god bless you justin where stand up right there it's a testimony that i am the resurrection and the life and that we are people at the resurrection hallelujah it's a testimony to every one of you god can go out and get your kid got to get the prodigal god get because he is the resurrection and the life little jed was there in that prayer line one of the last come up seemed like to me warts was all over his little body they burned a hundred of them off that day had so many more and said i can't do any more today we'll have to bring him back and burn a bunch more but one moment in the presence of life death had to go warts had to leave hundreds of them vanished off of the body i'm talking about the resurrection and the life i can remember the time when jude ogles be a baby that was stunted with kidneys that didn't work his his his diaper would be dry every morning but one service you know it only takes one moment amen just one moment in his presence amen one service the spirit of god moved on his mother saying take that baby for prayer and she ran to the altar with her baby and that affliction was cursed and it died that day and life came in the kidneys that were dead are you with me and that affliction was cursed and the next morning that baby diaper was wet she took him back to the doctor and he showed completely healed kidneys no problem hallelujah what about the holy ghost what about that what about the miracle of salvation amen there's aaron oglesby right here cold lukewarm and different church member sports was his idol one service god pricked his heart and he said i'm going to make an appointment with brother tim and i got to talk things over with him but then he got real said i know i won't do that i'm just putting it off and down the aisle that he came and there god changed his life forever and resurrected him out of sin into life and has made a preacher of the gospel out of him hallelujah amen if you'll do that for linda and ross children he'll do it for your children and your children's children it's good for you it's good for them they're sorry even as many as the lord are not your call god hasn't quit saving he's still working miracles you know god speaks i've heard his voice oh yeah i know i heard his voice the devil can't tell me i didn't hear his voice there's kenneth middleton sitting back there a man who could lie better and he could tell the truth a cheater ladies man oh my he was a slicker to the point i turned him over to the devil this church did put him out but god didn't give up on him amen god didn't give up on him he got down on his back lying in the hospital and i went to him said kenneth jesus still saves and there's hope for you hallelujah one moment in his presence the life came oh he had tried church before he had been a faithful member before he had professions before but this time the life giver came in life and the old man died and the kenneth middleton i just talked about don't exist anymore he's dead he dead he'll live anymore amen but there's a new kenneth middleton [Applause] now don't look a little sanctimonious we wouldn't we we weren't all saints we wasn't all natural-born christians ephesians 2 we we read about a while ago that we walked in times past and sins and trespasses when we were dead and sins he made us alive together in christ but let me tell you who made up the new testament church you'll understand who will make up this endtime church the kind of church that was at the beginning god had a church like he wanted it in the end god will again have a church like he wanted and this this here the kind of people that made up the new testament church and they they're the kind that you know god has come to say he's not come to save good people he's come to save his own and listen to his own just center all kinds of jams and messes before they come because satan can see there's something different about that boy girl so he starts working on them early trying to cover them up with every kind of sin and darkness and unbelief the woman at the well was that kind of woman she you know she was a predestinated seed but satan come along and did everything so i just wonder about her so he gets her down into every kind of darkness she had physical darkness of having having six men and you know the one she's living with was not her husband five but she had lived married and one she's living with she wasn't even married to and she just really had some real issues not only that she was a religious sinner it's amazing to me how people can be so black in their soul and so religious so she has all of these questions for jesus you know about word of worship what to do you say this nathan we say this and what do you say and all these other things she was she was ready to argue the gospel defender position a sinner and jesus began to discern her heart and told her what her trouble was because why there was a divine appointment for her life and there they're standing there she met the life-giver one moment in his presence she threw her water pot down and man it wasn't so important anymore and here she runs to go tell come see a man who told me the things i've done isn't this the very messiah first corinthians 6 and 9 know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor feminine or abusers of themselves of mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god none of these shouts looks pretty today i'm pretty hopeless on it but then the next verse says and of such were some of you but you are lost but you are sanctified but you have been declared righteous justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god i'm glad the other wasn't the end of the story i'm glad there was a conjunction that said and that was some of you but you are lost sanctified justified [Applause] kenneth became a lovely christian he's read his bible from cover to cover over 50 times now most of us can't say that i can't he's listening to every sermon that brother branham's now several times over and the devil's tried to kill him with cancer with heart trouble he's crippled him up but he can't stop him from loving and serving jesus all them things and he stopped him amen but having lived such a sinful life one day he was wondering if jesus loved him he said jesus i know you love me but if you could just somehow tell me that you love me he was drinking some tea down to the end of it he's sitting by this telephone there on canvas heist chair stool he could at that time still walk around just a little bit holding on to something holding on to the bar of the house there he decided to go back and get his tea jug filled up again he was walking along sliding his cup along sliding this cup along holding down crippling along jesus you know i love you but if you could just tell me it's somehow another you could just tell me that you love me would you like to hear him say it sometimes he said it means so much to me you wouldn't have to do it lord you've told me in your word you love me and all that but if somehow you could just just make it personal to me at that moment as he walked back around there and he he got back to his chair and and he sat down took a drip a drink of his tea and said hey man and as he finished his prayer the phone ring and i was down in my barn there doing some chores in the morning and the voice of god spoke to me said go call kenneth middleton and tell him these words i love him and on the other end of the line when he answered i said brother kenneth i don't know what's going on but i want you to know god just spoke to me to tell you i he loves you amen that's it you see sometimes we think oh we've done so much and we made so many mistakes and god couldn't love me he's a personal god and a personal savior he'll go to the extreme to get his children [Applause] he'll not lose the one of them so i'll just tell you devil don't you tell me my prayers are ineffective hallelujah you see resurrection is regeneration it means to breathe life into it breathe life into the bible it makes scriptures that lay dormant for centuries come alive amen but it's more than the written word now a lot of people think oh the the message is the word the word to work it you know it's more than a written word it's more than tapes is more than books it is more than the than the logos the written word it's the rhema the word in action and god breathed life into malachi 4. and it became flesh hallelujah amen and god sent elijah but he didn't just send elijah he sent he said i'd send them to you you're in malachi 4. i send it to you a lie to the prophet you see wouldn't do no good to send him if there wasn't somebody going to receive him hallelujah so god breathed a life in that scripture and because of life in that scripture you are here today hearing the message of believing the message of malachi 4 because god sent it personally to you your message god breathed life into luke 17 30 as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man or when the son of man is revealed 10 7 where he says in the day that but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of god should be finished now life is also coming to revelation 10 8 that must prophesy again as we prophesy again and the voice speaks the bride speaks the last prophecy now remember in her voice is life it was the voice of the prophet ezekiel that was commanded you know to say to the dry bones live amen and such this bride is the same she is the final voice to the final age and it will be the voice of god within her that actually calls the dead of the seven ages from the grave now i'm not talking about some who do something of going out and waving a wine over the cemetery you know raising them up i'm talking about when our life matches the promise of the hour and we fulfill the words that is written of us the dead in christ will be called to meet us because we are are the voice of the resurrection the people of the resurrection now this word resurrection means to revitalize to re-energize brother branham would say this in wisdom versus faith that the disciples had it suited to them then the spirit came to energize the word see not by power not by might nor by wisdom nor by understanding not by this not by that but by my spirit i will energize my word my spirit saith the lord it's the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of god and makes it work so how can you preach doubt and energize the word of god that kills the word and it makes it ineffective amen when you preach doubt like he's off the mercy seat that's doubt that's unbelief that's confusion that's darkness it'll never produce faith he is not off the mercy seat he ever liveth to make intercession amen on our behalf he lives to do it he lives to take your need before the father come on church and then when you preach that we're we're we're just not in the season for miracles you're lying to the people you're discrediting the promise of the word when you project it was only for brother branham and not for all believers you're projecting doubt when you say we're waiting on the third pull that's a lie we're not waiting on the third pole we're part of the third polar phase of brother bradley's ministry the third pull was the opening of those seven seals revealing of the mystery that took the seals off the book so every promise could be yours we are living out the third phase of brother bratton's ministry it continues on in the bright people is it work right now resurrection is a reinvigoration it means to put stress strength and life and heart into question answered brother branham said this now i'm going on to the holy spirit when i get here i'm in the holy spirit by baptism is that right what does the holy spirit do it gives me power power to be a preacher what good is preaching without the anointing what good is preaching with just lecture what is it people just getting up you know and they got a dry word say well you know i i'm a teacher a teacher is not somebody with a dry word until the word has got to be anointed or is dead otherwise your letter killeth instead it gives life amen what we preach has to be anointed i've heard ministers in the message big name preachers actually stand up and say uh you know i can i can preach without the anointing i say oh god don't never let me do that i don't ever want to get up and not have your anointing i need nothing to brag about that i can preach without god i gotta have it it gives power to the preacher glory don't stop there gives power to the singer isn't it wonderful to hear anointed singer not just something that makes some pretty noise but where you know the anointing it comes down it bathes over the soul it cleanses it preaches the sermon within itself it brings healing deliverance with anointed singing because he gives power to be a singer it's just power to speak in tongues uh-oh don't hang up on me because it also gives power to interpret tongues it's full of power for the holy ghost holy spirit is the power of god it was the power of god that turned me around it was the power of god that sanctified me now it's the power of god that filled me what does the holy ghost fart brother branham asked he preached the whole sermon about it he said the holy ghost came to give you power power in prayer you take a person that's lived a good life but they're always defeated a good person oh sure i love the lord brother branham but always defeated they never get a prayer answered you feel that little woman with the holy ghost one time watch what takes place when she goes before the throne of god she's not defeated she comes boldly to the throne of god believing she has a right because she is a daughter of god by birth hallelujah amen that's the first thing you do when you go to god is position yourself in the right position i'm not coming a beggar i'm not a stranger i'm not an outcast i'm one of your children god and i'm knocking on your door because i've got a need in my life that's the way you approach god knowing your position take that little man so cowardly boss kick him all over the place wait here a minute something's changed he's got the holy ghost he gives you power your life is full of power and because we're people of the resurrection we have a theophany waiting brother branham would say this the lord jesus it was back there in the days of the apostles is right here now and it's just winding up the end of the gentiles a great move that's going on just supernatural believers because we believe that god is here just think your glorified body is right here in the tabernacle now the presence of the holy spirit which is your glorified condition oh you're glorified in christ right now those who justified he glorified in your own glorified body he's talking about the holy ghost is standing right near you right now in into uh in christ jesus to give you strength like a charge going into a battery and the holy spirit is in you to charge your body to give you new strength to heal you from the sickness you got to make you well i say oh god let

come on right from the holy jokes right into you and empower you hallelujah amen raise you up out of your confusion out of your doubts out of your unbelief make a real child of god out of you resurrection is a renewal it's resuming an activity or a state after an interruption now a renewal let's think about that for a minute you know sometimes an old eagle gets down blowed down from the heights sometimes things happen to you that literally knock the breath out of you i can say not in a million years never that i ever think i'd be standing here today a widower never wasn't my thinking i expected god all along i've seen him do it before i've seen him raise her up before i seen her that low before i've seen god come on the scene before but i felt like the old eagle brother branham saw sitting on a limb blown down by a storm and a little chipmunk of a devil screaming out blasphemies in the ears days of miracles are passed and god don't hear your prayers and all kinds of nonsense days of miracles have passed you know it's a bunch of holy rollers nothing to him it's just about to make believe speaking in tongues make believe chatter chatter chatter all this nonsense it's all just worked up you just getting them enthused you know no such a thing god don't keep his word christ ain't the same yesterday today and forever oh he's chattered in my ears you say brother tim you yeah he's tattered in my ears he got jesus here one day and god didn't try to get him to question if he's the son of god come on let me try to get him to question and prove whether he was and you know and and and you know you could look around and you say yeah god answers prayer but he didn't hear my prayers no more he makes you question did you fail god somewhere did you do something did you make a mistake did is there something you don't know hey he's tried to make me feel sorry for myself but i ain't having none of that because after a while i know the devil is going to be feeling sorry for himself amen he ain't seen nothing to what's coming he's made me feel alone and forsaken but that's impossible because jesus said i'll never leave you or forsake you amen the joshua commission is and that's the ministry that follows moses remember joshua 1 5 there shall not be any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life as i was with moses so will i be with you i will not fail

branham will look there at that old eagle and say well god what do you want me to see in this eagle you know you know here i was shouting around and around around god in his universe and now i see over here there's an old eagle up there on what's about him and he said i noticed one thing about him said he's brave he's not a coward god can't use a coward god can't use you being fearful and afraid either one of the worst things about this whole cove thing has been fear people are afraid they're afraid you've met the devil now you know it's really not nothing to be afraid of right amen and the eagle is brave and he said number two he said he he said he noticed there he kept flexing his wings amen he had confidence in those in those god given wings amen and and then he explained that and he said this is the word and the one who wrote the word is my wings hallelujah amen you say i i i tell you brother jim i'm i can't fly oh yes you can amen if you've got god you can amen because

have another spell just as sure as the world and i've watched him till he became a little black dot way up in the air and i said lord that's it lord it isn't join this or go join that or flap flap here and flop there from one place another is knowing how to set your wings in the power of faith and fly away hallelujah amen that's the way i want to do i want to rise up above all the noise of the chipmunk where i don't even hear it anymore and i'm flying so high they can't even see me in the sky until one day i get so close to there i don't come back here again hallelujah that's the way he did
