[42:34] singing in the house of the Lord there's
[42:37] deliverance in the house of the Lord
[42:38] there's so many wonderful things
[42:41] amen his presence is heaven to us a man
[42:45] a man Matthew 22 in verse 1 and jesus
[42:49] answered and spake unto them again by
[42:51] parables and said the kingdom of heaven
[42:54] is like unto a certain King which made a
[42:57] marriage for his son that was sent forth
[42:59] and sent forth his servants to call them
[43:02] that were bidden to the wedding and they
[43:04] would not come and again he sent forth
[43:07] other servants saying tell them which
[43:09] are bidden behold I have prepared my
[43:12] dinner my ox and my fatlings are killed
[43:14] and all things are ready coming to the
[43:17] marriage
[43:19] but they made light of it and went their
[43:21] way one to his farm another to his
[43:23] merchandise and the rim remnant took his
[43:27] servants and entreated them spitefully
[43:28] and slew them but when the king heard
[43:32] thereof he was wroth and he sent forth
[43:34] his armies and destroyed those murderers
[43:35] and burned up their cities then saith he
[43:39] unto his servants the wedding is ready
[43:42] but they which were bidden were not
[43:43] worthy go ye therefore into the highways
[43:46] and as many as ye shall find bid to the
[43:49] marriage so those servants were sent to
[43:52] the highways and gathered together as
[43:53] many as they found both bad and good and
[43:56] the wedding was furnished with guests
[43:58] when the king came in to see the guests
[44:01] he saw there was a man had not on a
[44:03] wedding garment and he said unto Him
[44:05] friend how come as thou in hither not
[44:08] having a wedding garment and he was
[44:12] speechless then said the King to the
[44:15] servants bind him hand and foot and take
[44:18] him away and cast him into outer
[44:20] darkness and there should be weeping and
[44:23] gnashing of teeth for many are called
[44:26] but few are chosen a men would let you
[44:29] be seated to see this morning I like to
[44:36] speak to you this morning on speechless
[44:40] something that's been on my heart for
[44:42] quite some time and Wednesday we spoke
[44:45] about the voice as of a trumpet and
[44:48] speaking about that voice and you know
[44:51] when that voice sounds and it speaks
[44:53] it's like as a lion roar it everything
[44:56] in the jungle just shuts up him and him
[44:59] and you know I was just reading the
[45:01] scripture of the wedding supper that was
[45:05] given or the wedding invitation it's an
[45:08] invitation to come to a wedding and
[45:10] everyone has received that wedding
[45:13] invitation you know there's the he said
[45:16] you know many that were which were
[45:19] called he was asked and asked them to
[45:21] come they would not come and so they
[45:24] even destroyed the servants and killed
[45:26] the servants that were or sent sent to
[45:29] give them at the invitation and then he
[45:31] tells them then
[45:32] go into the highways and byways and I'm
[45:35] thankful that the that wedding call has
[45:37] went into them highways in the byways
[45:40] and the places and the deep dark places
[45:43] of the earth to find those that are
[45:46] here's a man to be to call them to a
[45:49] place to where they can come and stand
[45:51] by his side but you know there was this
[45:53] one man that had come to the wedding but
[45:57] you know he must have come a different
[45:59] way there was some other way of coming
[46:02] because when you would come to a wedding
[46:03] it was actually showed there in the
[46:05] Orient even today as they do it when you
[46:09] come to and wet and you know you come
[46:10] and you don't you don't just come with
[46:12] the clothes that you wear but they
[46:13] actually will come and put a robe on you
[46:15] and that way everyone that comes to that
[46:18] wedding they all are the same whether
[46:20] they be rich or poor or they have a lot
[46:23] or they don't have much or are they be
[46:26] somebody on the street or they be
[46:28] someone in government when you come
[46:30] through the door and you put on this
[46:32] garment it makes everyone to be the same
[46:34] and and this is what Jesus is speaking
[46:37] of now we know the garment that he's
[46:39] speaking of is not clothes from a
[46:41] factory somewhere but the garment that
[46:43] we're required in this hour is the
[46:46] garment of the Holy Ghost that when you
[46:49] come into that his when you come to his
[46:51] wedding that it won't be one is rich one
[46:54] is poor one is a way of an important
[46:58] person one isn't nobody but everyone
[47:00] will be the same because they'll have
[47:02] that wedding garment on and and you know
[47:05] here this man came no doubt he came
[47:07] thinking that he can do it on his own or
[47:10] you know the voices that he would listen
[47:12] to that that you know well maybe it
[47:15] wasn't important to put that on or
[47:17] whatever but you know when he came and
[47:19] and the voice of God began or the King
[47:22] began to speak to him when that King
[47:24] spoke and said why have you now have you
[47:27] come to the wedding but you don't have a
[47:29] wedding garment and the Bible said he
[47:31] was speechless in other words no excuse
[47:34] could he offer there was nothing he good
[47:37] enough he could come up with to answer
[47:39] the king's question and and you know
[47:42] one has been given that opportunity and
[47:45] what you know in this time that we live
[47:47] in as far as here in this building
[47:49] you've been given opportunities after
[47:51] opportunities to put on the wedding
[47:53] garment and when you go before him you
[47:56] will be without excuse you won't have
[47:59] like that won't be a voice search or
[48:00] anything in your mind or anything that
[48:02] you can say or any voice that you can
[48:05] come up with your way you won't be able
[48:07] to say anything when you stand before
[48:08] that presence of God and you know and he
[48:12] was speechless he couldn't say a word he
[48:14] he couldn't he couldn't say anything and
[48:17] you know and he said that said to him
[48:18] friend he said friend so this man was
[48:21] not a stranger it wasn't somebody that
[48:23] that that you know shouldn't have been
[48:25] there or didn't get the invitation and
[48:27] didn't get the invite but he was he was
[48:30] some a you know a church member or he
[48:32] was somebody that was accustomed to
[48:35] being in the presence of God and you
[48:38] know here he said friend what are you
[48:40] doing here without the garment on why
[48:43] would you think that you could come on
[48:46] your own or why would you think that you
[48:48] could be good enough or why would you
[48:50] think that anything that you could do or
[48:52] you could be that you could manufacture
[48:54] on your own how do you think that you
[48:57] could do it on your own and not do it
[48:59] the way that I have asked you to do it
[49:02] and and this man couldn't come up with
[49:04] anything he was speechless you know now
[49:06] I get to thinking about those that are
[49:08] that will stand before the Judgment Day
[49:10] and and you know and they stand there
[49:12] and God asked the question why and what
[49:16] are they gonna better come up with to
[49:18] say why did you not go to that church or
[49:21] why did you not give yourself to God
[49:23] when I gave you opportunity after
[49:25] opportunity and you know there's gonna
[49:27] be many that's no doubt gonna stand
[49:29] there speechless you know not not have a
[49:33] word to offer not have anything to to
[49:37] give you know or not a nothing that they
[49:40] could come up with it's good enough in
[49:42] that presence and you know and then no
[49:45] doubt in their mind they'll go back to
[49:47] their mind and think about the
[49:48] opportunities and the wasted times and
[49:51] and the times they could have
[49:53] giving a heart to Mordor they could have
[49:56] surrendered they could have believed and
[49:58] they could have and all of that is all
[50:00] gone now and they have nothing but
[50:03] speechless and and you know and and here
[50:06] the time that this man was standing
[50:09] there and he was and brother Bannon was
[50:11] said like this he said was he a
[50:12] Presbyterian was he a Pentecostal why
[50:16] did he have a robe on he was dressed in
[50:18] just ordinary Street garbin and he said
[50:21] so it was one thing sure he hadn't come
[50:24] by the door he hadn't come by the way of
[50:27] Jesus Christ he hadn't hadn't come to
[50:29] get his robe on he maybe went by his own
[50:32] ideas or other voices or I went buys
[50:35] what his church said or what somebody
[50:38] else said or some man man theology or
[50:40] just shake a hand or just be sprinkled
[50:43] or something but it didn't come by the
[50:45] door if he had he would have repented
[50:48] he'd have been baptized in the name of
[50:50] Jesus Christ and received that baptism
[50:53] the Holy Ghost just exactly as everyone
[50:56] else there with a robe on did and he
[50:59] said he here he was he couldn't he
[51:01] didn't come by the door he said that's
[51:03] the door everyone has to go by he said
[51:07] because if he is the door he is the
[51:09] bridegroom he stands there the father
[51:11] given the invitation calling you you
[51:14] come up and he give you a robe and
[51:16] everyone receives it just the same way
[51:18] the baptism of the Holy Spirit come up
[51:21] and receive God except God be baptized
[51:25] calling upon the name of the Lord and
[51:26] the Holy Ghost comes in and feels you
[51:29] just like it did on the day of Pentecost
[51:32] it has to be the same way for every
[51:35] person that has a robe on a man he said
[51:38] but the man must have come in a window
[51:40] he must have slipped in some other way
[51:42] and when the King the bridegroom said
[51:44] friend how did you get in that showed
[51:46] that bent some good old-fashioned Holy
[51:49] Ghost preachers down therefore he stood
[51:51] speechless because he knew he had had
[51:55] the opportunity mercy and he said maybe
[51:59] you know and some meeting he knew better
[52:02] he knew but
[52:03] before God he couldn't say I never heard
[52:07] about it he couldn't say I never had the
[52:10] opportunity because he had been in some
[52:12] Holy Ghost meetings he had seen the lame
[52:15] walk yet seeing the blind see he had
[52:18] seen great miracles of God and there he
[52:21] stood speechless and he said why he said
[52:24] what did God say he said bind him hand
[52:26] and foot and throw him in the out of
[52:28] dark in the darkness and then be weeping
[52:30] and wailing the gnashing of teeth
[52:32] he said suit yourself friend that's the
[52:35] gospel he said that Jesus Christ onwards
[52:38] he said it wasn't just a parable it's a
[52:41] prophecy it'll be that way some day said
[52:44] some debts of the night while the gates
[52:46] are open and the waters are flowing free
[52:49] and everything is ready and the father
[52:51] is knocking at your heart he said son
[52:53] you've been in says son you've been
[52:55] playing Church long enough it's time you
[52:57] to get right he said I advise you to go
[53:00] by that door and get a robe all amen go
[53:05] by the way of repent and be baptized in
[53:07] the name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[53:10] receive the robe amen the righteousness
[53:12] of God see we try to come on our own
[53:15] abilities her own righteousness or all
[53:17] works or what we think our own ideas but
[53:21] you'll not get to the supper unless you
[53:23] come by that door unless you come by
[53:26] that Holy Ghost so what could he say
[53:27] what they come to the moment that
[53:30] whatever he could say was no good
[53:32] anymore he had said many things no doubt
[53:35] in the church service I'll I'll do it
[53:38] another time or I'll beer I'm good
[53:40] enough or I'm okay he'd said all kinds
[53:42] of stuff but when he came before the
[53:45] king he was speechless his words were no
[53:49] good no more his thoughts were no good
[53:51] no more what he could come up with on
[53:53] his own was worthless because he come by
[53:58] some other way beside the door what is
[54:02] the robe his sword the robe of Christ
[54:04] and when you adorn the robe of Christ
[54:07] it's the Spirit of Christ in you it's
[54:10] the Spirit of Christ if you have the
[54:11] Spirit of Christ in you you'll act like
[54:13] Christ it'll do the work
[54:15] oh Christ it'll have the gentleness the
[54:17] long-suffering the goodness of mercy the
[54:19] meekness the patience the Holy Spirit
[54:22] and that's why though his spirit is
[54:24] living within you but this man was
[54:26] speechless leaning maybe you know I
[54:28] thought well wait a minute I I'm a
[54:30] presbyterian I'm a Methodist I'm a
[54:32] Pentecostal I'm a messages believer that
[54:35] has nothing to do with it
[54:37] and that's nothing to do with that we're
[54:39] not interested in just becoming a name
[54:41] of some some creed or some Dogma or
[54:44] something we want the life of Christ we
[54:48] want him on display in our life so he
[54:50] didn't come by the door he he came by
[54:53] another way he came by a Baptist Church
[54:55] or he came by a Pentecostal church or
[54:57] heard maybe just came by methyl assure
[54:59] message Church just to believe or just
[55:02] to understand or just say I believe
[55:03] something but none of that's going to be
[55:06] any good no more when you come to this
[55:07] moment he came up maybe by some man's
[55:12] way or his own way or Church way or some
[55:15] other way but God has a provided way and
[55:18] that way is Jesus amen that way is Jesus
[55:23] and you come by Jesus and you take on
[55:26] the name of Jesus by spiritual baptism
[55:29] he meant when then you're dead and you
[55:31] take on Christ about the new birth and
[55:33] you're born again and you're filled with
[55:36] the spirit see when the Spirit of Christ
[55:38] comes in you it deals with all of your
[55:41] excuses all of your scooters are wiped
[55:44] away and they're no good no more yeah
[55:51] they come by the door then you row by
[55:54] the same spirit have the same kind of
[55:57] life have the same kind of testimony be
[56:00] the same person but the King says fellow
[56:04] friend why are you here without a
[56:07] wedding garment the question was asked
[56:11] why did you come without a wedding
[56:13] garment and the Bible said he was
[56:16] speechless
[56:17] he had no excuse I wonder how long it
[56:21] had been that he listened to the wrong
[56:23] voice the voice has said me know his
[56:27] brother band was saying you know he said
[56:28] I would get
[56:28] heart to the Lord a long time ago he
[56:31] said but there was a voice that said
[56:32] wait a little longer or there's voices
[56:35] that say I'm good enough there's voices
[56:38] that say I I I you know I I believe the
[56:43] message I've made it no it's more than
[56:46] of the word we're looking for more than
[56:47] just a belief system we're looking for
[56:50] more than just rules and regulations and
[56:53] and then man and voices of do's and
[56:56] don'ts we're looking for more than that
[56:58] we want the Spirit of God in our lives a
[57:02] man you know let's turn to proverbs 1
[57:05] and verse 1 and we're gonna go through
[57:07] these chapters here this morning and
[57:09] feel bare with me
[57:10] because Solomon you know as Solomon
[57:13] would come into his kingdom he asked God
[57:16] for wisdom he asked God for more than
[57:19] man's intellect or more than man's
[57:22] abilities or more than his own knowledge
[57:25] or his own ways or whatever he could
[57:28] conjure up as a king he wanted more than
[57:30] that I believe we are as children of God
[57:33] we have that same desire we we want more
[57:35] than what we can think or what we can to
[57:38] come up with our own ways we want God's
[57:41] wisdom amen in the same that's wisdom
[57:44] that Solomon was looking for and asking
[57:46] for was not man's abilities as far as
[57:49] intellectual speaking him and all that
[57:52] only take you so far but what Solomon
[57:55] was asking for was God I want to hear
[57:58] your voice and say what you say and
[58:01] believe what you believe and let it be
[58:04] not Solomon's ideas and Solomon's ways
[58:07] but I want the wisdom of Almighty God
[58:11] and here we read in the first verb the
[58:15] product first verse the Proverbs of
[58:16] Solomon the son of David the king of
[58:19] Israel and I want you to listen to
[58:21] voices here he says to know wisdom so to
[58:24] know when wisdom and instruction speaks
[58:28] to perceive it to have the ability to
[58:31] understand I mean the words of
[58:34] understanding - and it's not
[58:36] understanding of human intellectual
[58:38] ability but to understand
[58:40] amen godly wisdom and godly instruction
[58:44] to discern and comprehend of godly
[58:48] understanding to receive the instruction
[58:52] of wisdom justice and judgment and
[58:55] equity to give subtility to the simple
[58:59] to the young man knowledge and
[59:01] discretion
[59:02] amen our good judgment or our you know
[59:06] to those who are can be easily misled
[59:09] amen to give something on the inside
[59:11] that inner voice they can listen to he
[59:16] said a wise man will hear and will
[59:18] increase learning and the person of
[59:22] understanding will acquire wise go
[59:24] acquire wise counsel and the skill a
[59:27] artist that will to steer his course
[59:30] wisely or to lead others to the truth
[59:33] verse 6 says to understand a proverb and
[59:36] the interpretation the words of the wise
[59:39] and their dark sayings are there their
[59:43] mysteries that are hidden there a man I
[59:45] believe that we have been given the
[59:47] abilities to understand the mysteries
[59:49] that are there and it's not by a man's
[59:52] intellectual ability but by the wisdom
[59:55] of Almighty God hey man to understand a
[59:58] proverb or a figure of speech or the
[1:00:01] words of the wise and their riddles are
[1:00:03] mysteries amen verse 7 the fear of the
[1:00:06] Lord is the beginning of knowledge so if
[1:00:09] you want to understand God you've got to
[1:00:12] start reverence God that what God said
[1:00:15] is dust sayeth the Lord and my excuses
[1:00:18] mean nothing my dears mean nothing I
[1:00:21] know it matters not what I think that's
[1:00:25] hard to say in the Laodicean age that we
[1:00:28] live in everybody's got a thought and
[1:00:30] they got a right to say something
[1:00:31] because it's a age of people's rights
[1:00:34] listen you can't put yourself out there
[1:00:36] and any kind of way on on Facebook or
[1:00:39] any kind of social media without
[1:00:41] somebody having something to say about

[1:00:48] you know you can't even put out a CD
[1:00:51] anymore you know of good gospel music
[1:00:52] without somebody
[1:00:54] having something to say about it it says
[1:01:00] the fear of the Lord is the beginning or
[1:01:03] the reverent fear that is worshiping him
[1:01:07] I love this is amplified the fear of the
[1:01:11] Lord that is worshiping him and
[1:01:13] regarding him as truly awesome he's
[1:01:20] truly awesome what he says matters what
[1:01:23] I think no it doesn't Amen is the
[1:01:25] beginning and the preeminent part of
[1:01:28] knowledge it's the starting place it's
[1:01:31] the basics it's it's where you begin
[1:01:34] when you realize God you're awesome

[1:01:39] you're beyond what I can come up with or
[1:01:42] any excuse I can give god you are
[1:01:44] awesome he said but arrogant fools
[1:01:49] despise godly wisdom and instruction and
[1:01:55] self-discipline the man in the parable
[1:01:58] had an opportunity to get a garment but
[1:02:01] he didn't think it was important he said
[1:02:05] through godly instruction to hear what
[1:02:07] God required service after service after
[1:02:10] service but still refused to hear them
[1:02:13] awesome voice amen in verse 8 said my
[1:02:17] son so to hear the instruction of thy
[1:02:21] father and forsake not the law of thy

[1:03:27] instruction to be get to give heed to

[1:03:31] just these parents that Solomon is
[1:03:33] speaking of they hadn't obeyed the
[1:03:36] instructions of Moses when he's sitting
[1:03:38] Dharana me 6 verse 6 and these words
[1:03:40] which I command thee this day shall be
[1:03:42] in my heart and thou shalt teach them
[1:03:45] diligently until our children and thou
[1:03:49] shalt talk of them without citizen thy
[1:03:51] house and when thou walkest in one way
[1:03:54] when that lies down and when thou rises
[1:03:56] up but what will their children do with
[1:03:59] this teaching verse 9 for they shall be
[1:04:03] an ornament of grace into thy head and
[1:04:07] chains about that neck it's in other
[1:04:11] words they are a garland of grace or
[1:04:15] ornaments of gold these these are these
[1:04:17] are something is very valuable listen
[1:04:21] these services that we're in on Sundays
[1:04:23] Wednesdays or whatever during the day
[1:04:26] and day when the presence of God they
[1:04:27] are very valuable
[1:04:29] I don't think sometimes we we sometimes
[1:04:32] get very you know if you had you know
[1:04:36] gold for pavement or you know gold yeah
[1:04:39] all over your house and you know it
[1:04:41] wouldn't be so valuable to you Khepera
[1:04:43] need be very rich but when somebody that
[1:04:46] really valued something is something
[1:04:48] that's dear to them they they don't just
[1:04:50] let the words come over the desk and
[1:04:52] fall to the ground they grab ahold of
[1:04:53] that's for me it's valuable it's like a
[1:04:57] crown on a king or a necklace on a queen
[1:05:01] Amen this robe that this man refused to
[1:05:03] put on he didn't realize the value of it
[1:05:06] how valuable it truly was and and this
[1:05:10] is a solemn and he said my son he said
[1:05:12] he said boy there's gonna be other
[1:05:14] voices they're going to try to take you
[1:05:16] away from God
[1:05:17] instruction and godly of wit wisdom II
[1:05:19] said my son if sinners enticing consent
[1:05:22] not or in other words don't respond
[1:05:24] don't listen and yours go out as though
[1:05:28] they never spoke if they say come with
[1:05:34] us and let us lay wait for blood let us
[1:05:36] look ply privately if for the innocent
[1:05:39] without cause let us swallow them up
[1:05:41] alive in the grave and hold as though go
[1:05:43] down the pit we shall find all precious
[1:05:45] substance we shall feel our houses with
[1:05:47] full casting that lot among us let us
[1:05:50] have what I have one person other words
[1:05:52] amen don't don't don't listen to what
[1:05:54] your father mother is saying that's not
[1:05:56] truly valuable we can give you true
[1:05:58] riches we can give you something that's
[1:06:01] really valuable he meant what it was
[1:06:03] that they was trying to distill the true
[1:06:06] voice they were trying to deaden the
[1:06:08] true voice that would lead that son or
[1:06:11] lead that daughter to true righteousness
[1:06:13] to true holiness to true purity amen to
[1:06:16] something that was truly valuable and to
[1:06:20] try to cheapen her life listen to this
[1:06:24] he says my son walk not in the way with
[1:06:27] him refrain their foot food that I fruit
[1:06:29] from their path for their feet run to
[1:06:31] evil let me show you where they're
[1:06:32] really going and make haste to shed
[1:06:35] blood surely in vain the net is spread
[1:06:37] inside of any bird and they what they
[1:06:39] that weight they and they lay wait for
[1:06:41] their own blood they lurk privately for
[1:06:43] their own lives so after the ways of
[1:06:47] everyone that is greedy of gain was
[1:06:49] taken away the life of the owners
[1:06:50] thereof so the father is warning his son
[1:06:53] not to yield to the voice of temptation
[1:06:57] but to check the path he's on and don't
[1:07:00] walk everyone was saying Psalms 1 1
[1:07:04] don't walk with the wrong crowd don't
[1:07:08] play with temptation because temptation
[1:07:10] leads to a trap every time he says in
[1:07:15] verse 17 is vain and net it's spread
[1:07:18] inside of a bird in other words birds
[1:07:20] don't take the bait
[1:07:21] when they see the trap and he said
[1:07:24] people ought to be smarter than a bird
[1:07:27] you see the trap that's there listen if
[1:07:30] Satan is talking to you it's leading to
[1:07:32] a trap
[1:07:35] amen he's promising all kinds of things
[1:07:37] but it's leading to destruction verse 19
[1:07:45] it says a greedy of gain they take what
[1:07:48] they want from life but eventually they
[1:07:50] have to pay for it and they pay then the
[1:07:52] price they pay is higher than the value
[1:07:55] they gain and the endlessness and the
[1:07:59] end of sacrificing the permanent for the
[1:08:02] immediate and that's a bad investment
[1:08:07] he's trying to show them this is what
[1:08:09] true riches are it's the voice of God
[1:08:12] godly wisdom this is what's truly and
[1:08:15] and and this is this here is only
[1:08:18] temporary and only for a moment the
[1:08:21] voice of temptation verse 11 through 14
[1:08:23] is anything that leads us away from the
[1:08:26] path of God that isn't the right voice
[1:08:28] the offer may sound exciting but at
[1:08:31] least a destruction people today
[1:08:34] actually find enjoyment and doing evil
[1:08:36] and somehow having fabin fooled I've
[1:08:38] been fooled into thinking those things
[1:08:40] will satisfy and they reject eternal
[1:08:44] treasure with eternal benefits for cheap
[1:08:47] trinkets of the world and are losing
[1:08:49] their soul and what they think is a
[1:08:51] bargain the voice of this world everyone
[1:08:58] has been given a voice we live in a time
[1:09:00] everyone has a voice used to people
[1:09:03] could say something you'd never hear
[1:09:05] from them because they rarely left five
[1:09:06] miles from their house they could scream
[1:09:09] and holler and it only go as far as
[1:09:11] their voice but now you can say
[1:09:12] something to be heard on the other side
[1:09:14] of the world everyone has a voice not
[1:09:17] one can make a move without somebody
[1:09:19] saying something nothing is private
[1:09:21] anymore everyone has a platform they can
[1:09:23] scream for them and that scream don't
[1:09:25] just go through a few trees and die out
[1:09:28] that scream circles the world every
[1:09:30] artist is trying to find a way to get in
[1:09:33] your ears every store is trying to find
[1:09:35] a way to get into your
[1:09:36] ears and your pockets loud voices
[1:09:39] enticing spirits trying to have their
[1:09:42] moment to scream to get your attention
[1:09:46] the voice of wisdom is screaming also
[1:09:49] the voice of salvation is screaming also
[1:09:52] and this is not the voice of man's
[1:09:54] intelligence this is the voice of the
[1:09:57] wisdom of Almighty God says it here in
[1:10:02] Proverbs 1 verse 20 wisdom cries out
[1:10:07] blood is crying out in the middle of all
[1:10:11] this chaos and the devil said I'm gonna
[1:10:12] do this with your life you come with me
[1:10:15] and I offer you this but wisdom is
[1:10:17] crying out and she's crying out her
[1:10:19] voice is honored in the streets in the
[1:10:23] streets all I see is this advertisement
[1:10:25] and as ever listen here
[1:10:27] he said she cries out in the cheap
[1:10:29] places of concourse in the open of the
[1:10:31] gates and the cities she utters her
[1:10:34] words saying how does wisdom speak loud
[1:10:40] it's crying out people I think they're
[1:10:43] walking around as though like they're
[1:10:45] whistling in the graveyard somewhere and
[1:10:47] they're acting like it ain't saying
[1:10:48] God's not speaking no more but God is
[1:10:51] still speaking his voice is still crying
[1:10:55] out his voice is still punctuated and
[1:10:58] her guy are going through and and men
[1:11:01] going down through the alleys and the
[1:11:03] way and calling out to everyone who so
[1:11:06] ever will come and let him drink from
[1:11:08] this fountain his voice is still
[1:11:11] speaking is still calling and seeing
[1:11:14] whosoever come you can have this room
[1:11:16] you can have this life you can have this
[1:11:20] and people are just walking as though
[1:11:22] nothing is going on listen no one really
[1:11:26] has an excuse listen to this right here
[1:11:30] and these let's turn to Romans 10 and
[1:11:32] verse 13 they said for whosoever shall
[1:11:34] call upon the name of the Lord shall be
[1:11:36] saved
[1:11:37] how then shall they call on him in whom
[1:11:40] they have not believed and how shall
[1:11:43] they believe in him whom they have not
[1:11:46] heard and how shall they hear without a
[1:11:49] preacher
[1:11:50] and how shall they preach except they be
[1:11:52] sent and as it is written how beautiful
[1:11:54] are the feet of them that preach the
[1:11:56] gospel of peace and bring good tidings
[1:11:58] of good things
[1:12:00] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[1:12:02] for as I as I says Lord who has believed
[1:12:07] our report so then faith cometh by
[1:12:09] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:12:12] but I say have they not heard yes verily
[1:12:15] their sound went into all the earth and
[1:12:20] their words unto the end of the world
[1:12:23] but I say did not Israel know first
[1:12:25] Moses said I will provoke you to
[1:12:27] jealousy by them that are no people and
[1:12:29] my foolish nation I will anger you but
[1:12:32] as I said it's very bold to say and I
[1:12:33] found of them that sought me not I was
[1:12:36] made manifest unto them that asked not
[1:12:38] for me but the Israel he's saying all
[1:12:41] day long I've stretched forth my hands
[1:12:44] unto the disobedient and gainsaying
[1:12:46] people so his voice is going out it
[1:12:52] doesn't matter if people won't listen it
[1:12:56] doesn't mean that is voicing sounding
[1:13:00] what if they never come to church
[1:13:02] service and here this glorious truth
[1:13:05] listen to Psalms 19 and verse 1 people
[1:13:10] walk away walking down the streets every
[1:13:11] day and say I never hear from God I read
[1:13:16] this early the other mornings I got up
[1:13:18] even before the Sun come up and was
[1:13:21] studying studying I started reading this
[1:13:26] Psalm 19:1 the heavens declare the glory
[1:13:31] of God so a person cannot walk out of
[1:13:36] their house daylight or dark and not
[1:13:40] hear the glory of God and the firmament
[1:13:44] showeth his handiwork day after day in
[1:13:48] uttereth speech and night unto night
[1:13:52] show with knowledge there is no speech
[1:13:55] nor language in other words there's not
[1:13:58] a language and the whole earth where
[1:14:00] their voice is not heard
[1:14:03] their line has gone out through all the
[1:14:06] earth and their words to the end of the
[1:14:08] world in them has he set a tabernacle
[1:14:11] for the Sun which is as a bridegroom
[1:14:14] coming out of his chamber and rejoices
[1:14:17] as a strong man to run a race he goes
[1:14:20] forth in from the end of heaven and his
[1:14:23] circuit unto the ends of it and there is
[1:14:25] nothing hid from the heat thereof so
[1:14:29] when the Sun rise and it is declaring
[1:14:31] the voice of Almighty God let there be
[1:14:36] light and it's so Amen it's showing that
[1:14:39] is a God whether they want to believe it
[1:14:42] or not whether they want to acknowledge
[1:14:45] or not his voice is sounding the statues
[1:14:54] of the Lord are right rejoicing the
[1:14:56] heart the commander of the Lord is pure
[1:14:58] enlightening the eyes of fear the Lord
[1:15:00] is clean enduring forever the judgement
[1:15:02] the Lord is true and righteous
[1:15:03] altogether more to be desired are they
[1:15:06] than gold every go back to that gold
[1:15:08] around the neck or that crown on the
[1:15:10] head is what wisdom of God truly is a
[1:15:13] man yea much fine gold sweeter also than
[1:15:16] honey than the honeycomb moreover by
[1:15:19] them are thy servant worn and keeping of
[1:15:21] them there is great reward wisdom
[1:15:23] salvation has went to the streets to
[1:15:26] declare the glory of the Lord but people
[1:15:29] were so busy going after the day so
[1:15:33] consumed with the voices of the day they
[1:15:35] miss every day the Sun declaring the
[1:15:38] glory of God they missed the trees the
[1:15:41] grass the flowers nature declared the
[1:15:44] glory of God and then wisdom asks in
[1:15:48] verse 22
[1:15:49] how long you simple ones will you love
[1:15:55] simplicity and thus corners delight in
[1:15:58] the scorners scorning and fools hate
[1:16:01] knowledge three classes of sinners
[1:16:05] wisdom and salvation is speaking to
[1:16:07] simple scorners or scholars and fools
[1:16:13] the simple ones are who believe anything
[1:16:16] but
[1:16:16] and nothing they go there gullible and
[1:16:20] let us stray scorners are those who
[1:16:23] think they already know everything and
[1:16:24] when they come here
[1:16:27] what really coming and they coming here
[1:16:29] what's really important they turn away
[1:16:31] and laugh at it fools are they who are
[1:16:35] ignorant of the truth because they're
[1:16:36] dull of hearing and stubborn wisdom is
[1:16:40] asking how long will you be told the way
[1:16:42] but refuse to listen how long will you
[1:16:46] sit service after service and not repent
[1:16:48] they're given an opportunity to turn
[1:16:51] away from it with the voice of God
[1:16:55] sounds whether somebody will hear it or
[1:16:57] not the voice of God a sound where some
[1:17:00] time I do believe it or not but there
[1:17:02] will be somebody that I believe it even
[1:17:07] though there are other voices their
[1:17:09] voices of Hollywood there's voices of
[1:17:11] entertainment their voices of temptation
[1:17:14] their voices of politics their voices of
[1:17:17] demons all these voices does that does
[1:17:19] not mean that the voice of God is not
[1:17:21] sounded and just because the devil is
[1:17:24] trying to drown it out does not mean
[1:17:26] it's going to happen remember God's
[1:17:29] voice will keep on sounding all the way
[1:17:32] down to the judgement when he asks why
[1:17:36] when I gave you day after day China but
[1:17:43] the devil is trying to drown out the
[1:17:45] voice of God drown out the voice of
[1:17:47] godliness drown out the voice of
[1:17:50] holiness but that doesn't mean that the
[1:17:52] voice of God isn't still sounding and
[1:17:54] still true you know the things that we
[1:18:03] teach in holiness and righteousness is
[1:18:07] not just some man's ideas it's in the
[1:18:10] Bible so if it's in the Bible it's
[1:18:13] apparently God's Word that's what I mean
[1:18:17] I don't know that what you believe
[1:18:18] is God's Word and God believes it and
[1:18:21] God's is gonna stand on it no matter
[1:18:23] what we think or what our excuses are
[1:18:27] but he wants to put his robe
[1:18:30] onion too many are trying by their own
[1:18:32] abilities or their own ways or you know
[1:18:35] and really if you look at things in the
[1:18:38] Bible and the way people dress and the
[1:18:41] Payette way people do and and you know
[1:18:43] you follow just for instance make up
[1:18:45] through the Bible and what was it it was
[1:18:48] somebody as a prophet would scream out
[1:18:51] he would say when you do that you're not
[1:18:53] preparing yourself to meet God you're
[1:18:57] preparing yourself to meet man and we
[1:19:00] don't want to prepare ourselves to meet
[1:19:02] man I mean hi what would what would we
[1:19:06] do if we has gonna have an audience with
[1:19:08] the with the president man we would put
[1:19:13] the best clothes on I would think and
[1:19:14] try to come come or whoever some great
[1:19:17] man some hero of yours whatever but yet
[1:19:21] God is calling us to a wedding supper
[1:19:23] and he's telling us this is not
[1:19:25] dependent on what you can provide or
[1:19:28] what you can do or what you can say or
[1:19:30] think I have something for you I want to
[1:19:36] go through a few things here before we
[1:19:38] move on because just because there's
[1:19:41] other voices does not mean that the
[1:19:43] voice of God has still not sounding and

[1:22:56] Holy Spirit to clean
[1:22:57] their lives you know that's right I'm
[1:23:02] just talking to a preacher the other day

[1:23:38] so I preached there not long ago said
[1:23:41] that every woman in this city was guilty
[1:23:43] one way or another of adultery a woman

[1:23:47] until looks like they're poured in he
[1:23:49] said this is my own church this is my
[1:23:52] own church he said I have a right to
[1:23:54] preach what the Holy Spirit tells me to
[1:23:56] let me tell you I'm not criticizing you
[1:23:58] my sister but don't let don't but don't
[1:24:01] the Holy Spirit teach you different if

[1:24:06] Holy Spirit that's right the Holy Spirit
[1:24:10] is not just shouting it's not dancing
[1:24:12] the spirit it's not speaking in tongues
[1:24:14] the Holy Spirit is righteousness God
[1:24:20] gives us the Holy Ghost revival he says
[1:24:22] of God to send back righteousness he
[1:24:25] said did you realize when you dress
[1:24:26] yourself like that and walk down the
[1:24:28] street
[1:24:29] men look at you the wrong way you'll be
[1:24:31] at the judgment bar you may be as pure
[1:24:33] as a lily to your husband but judgment
[1:24:35] and judgment you'll be guilty of
[1:24:36] committing adultery with that guy the
[1:24:38] way you present yourself he said no
[1:24:40] wonder it ought to make a person blush
[1:24:42] what must he do to God when the Bible
[1:24:45] said the beginning it grieved him that
[1:24:47] he made man it grieved the heart of God
[1:24:49] he looked upon the days of the
[1:24:51] hand-tighten delivery instruction that
[1:24:53] he ever made man what happened they
[1:24:55] begin to look at the daughters that they
[1:24:57] were fair there was a perversion that
[1:25:00] was taking place and they were left
[1:25:05] speechless dead
[1:25:08] floating in the flood
[1:25:12] no more lungs in their body all they'd
[1:25:16] said all kinds of things before that
[1:25:17] moment to know all kinds of excuses was
[1:25:21] coming out of their mouth well I just
[1:25:24] don't think it matters I just don't
[1:25:25] think that's just brother Tim that's
[1:25:27] just brother that's just brother branham
[1:25:29] that's just that you might as well say
[1:25:31] that's just God because it's in the
[1:25:34] Bible well I don't think it matters no
[1:25:38] more what you're saying really you don't
[1:25:41] think God matters let's just put it
[1:25:46] where the rubber hits the moat you don't
[1:25:47] think the road you don't think God
[1:25:49] matters when he said if you'll listen
[1:25:52] it'll be as a crown on your head and it
[1:25:57] be as a gold around your neck you'll
[1:26:00] have true riches that a man can't give
[1:26:02] you an a man can't take away he said we
[1:26:09] see today see the church has taken its
[1:26:11] pattern not out of the Bible not from
[1:26:13] Ruth not from the only not from Sarah
[1:26:15] the ones that allow their pattern even
[1:26:18] the women of the church after Hollywood
[1:26:20] and the very dregs of the devil is how
[1:26:22] our people who call them some Christians
[1:26:24] go out there and get this evil wet man's
[1:26:26] ways it was Presley an author Godfrey
[1:26:29] and all those listen that kind of
[1:26:30] nonsense on your radio and refused to
[1:26:32] hear the good gospel sermon being
[1:26:34] preached in the Bible God have mercy on
[1:26:36] you what kind of spirit have we got a
[1:26:38] mungus that's right no wonder the
[1:26:40] prophet of God blush before the Lord he
[1:26:42] knew that was unrighteousness and he
[1:26:44] stood and pleaded a call to said God
[1:26:46] we're unrighteousness and he said we are
[1:26:49] to friends he said listen quit trying to
[1:26:52] put on plasters quit trying to put on
[1:26:54] some sound the healing can't come unless
[1:26:56] the bloodstream gets right he said
[1:26:58] that's the reason people's got diabetes
[1:27:00] if one could ever cut himself probably
[1:27:02] never heal up because the real red blood
[1:27:04] cells is ate up and he said the whole
[1:27:06] church has become diabetic selfishness
[1:27:09] greed and moral a all kinds of wrong
[1:27:12] doings men drinking smoke and well it

[1:27:18] doing all kinda Zee dressing themselves
[1:27:21] and morally and face of people all these
[1:27:23] things are because it's the lack of the
[1:27:25] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:27:27] cleanses us from all righteousness mercy
[1:27:38] but one day somebody's gonna hear the
[1:27:43] word of God somebody's gonna say that's
[1:27:46] nothing but the truth let's go back to

[1:37:14] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[1:37:19] it's a great voice it's a final voice if
[1:37:25] we could ever get in our minds and our
[1:37:27] hearts that the enemy's voice is not the
[1:37:30] final voice he don't have the final say
[1:37:33] on your behalf he don't have the final
[1:37:36] say of your destination he don't have
[1:37:38] the final say of your sickness or
[1:37:40] whatever you're battling this morning he
[1:37:42] is not the final voice but you can hear
[1:37:45] another voice a loud voice or great
[1:37:49] voice as of a trumpet as of a line that
[1:37:52] roars and when he speaks everything else
[1:37:55] goes silent
[1:37:57] I had to go back again and look at some
[1:38:02] more things when God says go get going
[1:38:06] when God says you can do it you can do
[1:38:10] it when God says anything we believe it
[1:38:14] when God says it so that makes it the
[1:38:18] truth when God said healings for you
[1:38:20] then go get it when God says anything
[1:38:24] it's got to be when God says no matter
[1:38:26] what the circumstances it is anyhow when
[1:38:30] God says so it's never failed it can't
[1:38:33] fail because it's God when God says
[1:38:35] anything and commissions it and Center
[1:38:37] to learn all hell might explode it'll
[1:38:40] never change God's Word it'll be anyhow
[1:38:42] cuz God has spoke it and when God says
[1:38:46] he's going to do anything just believe
[1:38:48] it cuz it's going to happen when God
[1:38:50] says I will it's already done when God
[1:38:53] says anything we can say ain't man to it
[1:38:59] hallelujah that is the final voice
[1:39:07] hallelujah the voice of cancer rose up
[1:39:10] in our midst but that wasn't the final
[1:39:12] voice the final wars was I have healed
[1:39:17] you the final voice was Miriam your
[1:39:20] enemy is dead
